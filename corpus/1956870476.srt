<i>This is the formation zone</i>

3
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:30,832
<i>for tropical storm Hazel.
Now, we've got two models.</i>

4
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:33,202
<i>The American model
has Hazel turning north,</i>

5
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:35,670
<i>over Mobile
and the Florida Panhandle</i>

6
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:36,738
<i>and into Georgia.</i>

7
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:38,707
<i>The European model</i>

8
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,742
<i>has her slowing down, heading
northwest,</i>

9
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,913
<i>gaining strength and becoming
a potential hurricane.</i>

10
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:47,582
<i>This could become a major storm
and hit land again anywhere</i>

11
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:49,517
<i>from Gulfport to New Orleans.</i>

12
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,519
<i>Hazel is moving at
approximately</i>

13
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:52,821
<i>ten miles per hour</i>

14
00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:54,823
<i>and should make landfall
late tonight</i>

15
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:56,258
<i>or early tomorrow morning.</i>

16
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:58,294
<i>As Hazel makes landfall,
she's gonna become</i>

17
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,529
<i>a tropical storm once again
and bring plenty of rain</i>

18
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,265
<i>and high winds
to wherever she hits.</i>

19
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,868
<i>Now, folks, I feel that Hazel
is most likely to head towards</i>

20
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:09,038
<i>our friends in Louisiana.</i>

[seagulls crying]

22
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,080
Gorgeous.

23
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:23,953
What's in there?

24
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:25,221
- In that?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:27,089
- Nothing.
- Define nothing.

26
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:28,891
Soft shells.

27
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:32,061
- I thought the molt was over.
- It was. And then it wasn't.

28
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:33,528
But those are for Fryman's.

29
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:36,899
What, so they can be drowned
in garlic and black pepper?

30
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:38,067
You can't even taste them!

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,768
They offered 55 a dozen.

32
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,137
I'll give you 60.

33
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:43,305
Tucker gonna be okay with that?

34
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:44,839
Are you kidding?
He'll be thrilled.

35
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,308
Soft-shells this late?

36
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:50,845
If anyone asks,
you didn't get those from me.

37
00:02:51,113 --> 00:02:53,015
- Get what?
- [Sang chuckles]

38
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:55,918
- Careful out there this weekend.
- Thanks.

[indistinct chatter]

40
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:10,066
Thank you.

41
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,068
Seventeen?
Seventeen right here.

42
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,036
Hi, this is Miranda Wells again.

43
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:17,139
I got an overdraft fee
of $80 on the third.

44
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:19,607
But if the check had gone
through like it was supposed to,

45
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,043
everything would've been fine.

46
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,844
So, that fee
needs to be removed,

47
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:24,779
refunded, rescinded or whatever.

48
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:27,016
Please call back me today,
if possible.

49
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:28,217
Thank you.

50
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:31,353
- Miranda, it's 12:13.
- So?

51
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:32,922
So you told me
to remind you about

52
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:34,990
a dentist appointment at noon.
I forgot.

53
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:37,625
- [sighs]
- [indistinct chatter]

54
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:41,063
- [Tucker] Hey!
- Hey.

55
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,065
[Tucker] Up five percent
from last year.

56
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,200
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

57
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,168
People are spending again,
thank God.

58
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,837
- Where are you off to?
- Uh, a dentist appointment.

59
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,306
Oh, listen, um,

60
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:52,308
- about dinner.
- Oh, I know. With the storm.

61
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:53,876
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,945
The weather guy
says it's gonna miss us, but...

63
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,414
- You can never be too careful.
- So you think I should?

64
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,349
What? Board up?
Absolutely.

65
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:01,884
Look, no matter
how bad things are,

66
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,886
- they can always get worse.
- Oh.

67
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,122
And here I actually got us
in to Shaya.

68
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:08,891
Oh, babe. It's a school night.

69
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:10,326
Thank you.

70
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:12,161
We're fine.

71
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,396
Oh! And, um...

72
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:16,365
I bought soft-shells from Sang,

73
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:18,033
who was going to sell them
to Fryman's,

74
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,002
which I said was bogus,
because their chef sucks,

75
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:21,836
which is why I paid 60 a dozen.

76
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,373
Soft shells this late
in the season?

77
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:26,375
- Right?
- That's my girl.

78
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,743
Bye.

79
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,360
- [man] Thank you.
- [woman] Thank you.

80
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,739
Hi. Sorry.
Can I help you?

81
00:04:57,772 --> 00:04:58,641
Well, I hope so.

82
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,876
I made a reservation
on Hotel Tonight.

83
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:04,413
I've got a cousin in Nashville.

84
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:05,948
Oh, is that so?

85
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,349
Is this your first time
staying with us?

86
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:09,018
Uh, first time in New Orleans.

87
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:12,321
What are you studying?

88
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:16,392
How to get out
from behind this desk.

89
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:21,397
Well, anything is possible
if you really want it.

90
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:23,399
Yeah, I guess.

91
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:26,001
Any chance you have a room
with a view?

92
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,570
No, sorry.

93
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:30,072
All of the rooms overlooking
the Quarter are fully booked.

94
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,241
No problem.
I'll take whatever I can get.

95
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:36,312
Room 1 checked out early,
on account of the storm.

96
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:39,448
Okay, that's so weird.

97
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,483
Room 1 has a view
all the way to the river.

98
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:43,285
Must be my lucky day.

99
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:46,754
[Miranda groans]

100
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:48,357
[Devon] It's not often I get
a grown up in here

101
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,491
with a cavity this bad.

102
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,093
What do you do,
gargle with sugar?

103
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:51,927
[Miranda] Uh...

104
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:55,730
- [mumbling] Saltwater taffy.
- Yep, that would do it.

105
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,001
Devon says I need a root canal.

106
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,270
Well, I think he just misses
your company.

107
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:04,240
Mm, how about a week
from Monday at 9:00?

108
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:07,476
Donna, you're not helping.
Don't you have anything, like...

109
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:09,511
next June?

110
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:11,914
[chuckles]
Who's your provider again?

111
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:13,215
I opted out.

112
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,985
Um, why?
How much is it out of pocket?

113
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:19,221
That's 1,700 for a front,
2,300 for a back.

114
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:22,324
- Is it a front or a back?
- Uh, back.

115
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,061
Well, I'm sure Tucker
wouldn't mind plunking down

116
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,363
that platinum card of his.

117
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,465
That may be so,
but things are...

118
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:32,901
complicated enough what
with him being my boss and all.

119
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:37,805
Look, just stay safe tonight.
Okay? I hear Hazel's gonna turn.

120
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,909
I bet she hangs a left
and pounds us straight on.

121
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:49,952
[birds chirping]

122
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:27,089
[knocking on door]

123
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:45,507
[hisses]

124
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:49,878
[Bray] Oh! Nice cast!

125
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:52,881
I, uh...
I'm looking for Miranda Wells.

126
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:54,416
You from the bank?

127
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,119
Can't say that I am. No.

128
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:58,554
She's at work right now.

129
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:00,356
You can leave it with me.
I'm her son.

130
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:02,925
I kinda figured that.

131
00:08:04,393 --> 00:08:06,128
Well, the thing is...

132
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,566
I'm afraid this comes with
a little bit of an explanation.

133
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,569
Any idea what time
she'll be home?

134
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,304
Usually around four.

135
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,639
That's a cool thing
you've got there.

136
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,509
My dad made it for me,
'cause I wasn't getting my line

137
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,044
to where the big ones
are hiding.

138
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:25,080
He was an inventor.
Sort of.

139
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:26,648
Pretty good one, I bet.

140
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:28,951
Well, my mom says
he never sold much,

141
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:31,553
but that's 'cause
it wasn't his real job.

142
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:34,056
But he sure solved
your casting problem, didn't he?

143
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:36,492
Fish don't seem too impressed.

144
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:41,230
- No school today?
- I have a cold,

145
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:44,133
but my mom gave me
purple Dimetapp, so it's okay.

146
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,202
Well, you chose a beautiful day
to stay home.

147
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,072
Yeah. The storm's not supposed
to hit us until tonight.

148
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:52,941
I checked.
A couple times.

149
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:56,412
Thanks for the help.

150
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,549
Oh, and when you see her,
don't tell her we spoke.

151
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,318
I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

152
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,655
Your secret's safe with me.

Hi.

163
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:37,045
- [Bobby] <i>Miranda, it's Bobby.</i>
- I know. I have Caller ID,

164
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,614
and I can see your face,
sort of.

<i>The leaks.
Did you get 'em fixed?</i>

171
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,596
Bobby,
I can't afford a root canal,

00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,068
<i>and move to higher ground.</i>

175
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:02,170
- So you've said.
- <i>Oh, did I?</i>

176
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,338
Ever since he died.

177
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,340
<i>And it's as true today
as it was then.</i>

178
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,175
- <i>It is not safe.</i>
- [bell ringing]

179
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,211
[kids shouting]

180
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,080
Look, Bobby, um, I gotta run.

181
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:14,182
- I'll call you later?
- [Bobby] <i>Well, you never do.</i>

182
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,251
<i>You're always so busy.</i>

183
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:18,186
It's busy with the kids.
Love you.

184
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:23,492
Hey, gang.
How was the day?

185
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:24,760
Awful.

186
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,395
Terrible.

187
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,063
Bessie, honey, what's wrong?

188
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,232
She told some kid
she has a pony.

189
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:32,200
They called her a liar,
which she is.

190
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,202
I said I wanted a pony.

191
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,337
Since when?

192
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,471
Since always!

193
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:38,807
I told you not to let
her watch <i>Black Stallion.</i>

194
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,649
[Miranda]
You didn't eat your lunch?

195
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:49,351
Nobody brown bags anymore.

196
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:51,286
Why can't I just buy food
at school?

197
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,755
You can every once in a while,
but it adds up.

198
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:55,657
- We've been over this.
- So stupid.

199
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,728
Okay. Talk to me.
What's going on? Hmm?

200
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:01,563
[sighs]

201
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:05,400
Kit Riley's having a party
the same night as me.

202
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,536
They're gonna have freaking
food trucks.

203
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,305
Wow.

204
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:13,408
I don't even want a birthday.
I'm never gonna get

205
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,177
what I want anyway,
so what's the point?

206
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,312
Okay. We can't afford
a computer right now,

207
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:18,714
but it might be something
for Christmas.

208
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:21,283
Right.
We'll be lucky to have a tree.

209
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,318
[phone rings]

210
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:26,555
You're not supposed to be
on the phone while...

211
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:28,490
I wasn't gonna answer it,
I just wanna see who it was.

212
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:29,725
I'm expecting a call
from the bank.

213
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:30,459
It says Carol.

214
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:31,627
- That's the bank.
- [Missy] Oh, my God.

215
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,528
You're on a first name basis
with the bank?

216
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:35,330
- Stop being so dramatic.
- This is why I don't want

217
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:36,899
- a party, we can't afford it!
- Ask if I can call her back.

218
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:37,866
- Please?
- [crashing]

219
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,902
Oh, my God, Mom!

220
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:43,538
You're, like, the worst driver
in the whole world.

221
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:45,807
That's because no one else
in the entire world

222
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,509
has you as a passenger.

223
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,549
I am so sorry.
It was totally my fault.

224
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,251
Are you okay?
Are your kids okay?

225
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:57,819
Other than needing
an attitude adjustment,

226
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:58,787
they're fine.

227
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,224
Well, looks like
you got the brunt of it.

228
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,159
[grunts]

229
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:08,830
There goes my deductible.

230
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:14,403
Hey, hey.

231
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:16,738
Don't waste your insurance
on this.

232
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:20,342
If you just have a little
duct tape and spray foam,

233
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,476
I can fix this.

234
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:23,545
I can't ask you to do that.

235
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,281
You didn't. I offered.

236
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,419
My dad was a mechanic.

237
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:33,622
Hey. Whatever you want.
Totally up to you.

238
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:41,196
Well... I mean,
we're just up the road.

239
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:42,698
I'll follow you.

240
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:44,266
Thanks.

241
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,467
I got it. I got it.

242
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:53,675
- He's not gonna sue us, is he?
- Nope.

243
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:55,577
Why is he taking our bumper?

244
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,579
Because he's offered
to come over to fix it.

245
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,248
You're letting him
follow us home?

246
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,689
[Miranda] Bessie,
don't forget your backpack.

247
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:41,958
[Bessie] Okay, Mommy.

248
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:51,299
You know, I realize I never got
a chance to introduce myself.

249
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:54,036
- Bray Johnson.
- Miranda Wells.

250
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,838
- Miranda, nice to meet you.
- Yeah. No, not really,

251
00:14:56,872 --> 00:14:58,607
but I appreciate the gesture.

252
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,878
This is Missy and Bessie.

253
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,746
- Hi, guys.
- What's the "V" stand for?

254
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,782
The "V"?
Oh, uh, Vanderbilt.

255
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,951
I teach engineering up there.

256
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:10,318
Cool.

257
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:13,755
[exhales] So, you've got
your hands full, huh?

258
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,992
Oh, you have no idea.
And that's Greg.

259
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,761
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Greg.

260
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey. Uh, Mom?
What happened to the bumper?

261
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:25,700
Karma.

262
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:28,570
But Mr. Johnson here
says he can fix it.

263
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,940
Yeah, you wouldn't happen
to have a few screwdrivers

264
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,475
and some wrenches
in your tool shed, would you?

265
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:36,645
- Of course.
- And how about some spray foam?

266
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:39,614
You know, the kind you use
to fill a hole or stop a leak?

267
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,416
Tiger Foam or Great Stuff?

268
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,385
Either will do.

269
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,389
Tiger what or Great what?

270
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,524
Shop talk.

271
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:54,596
Do you want a beer
or a water or a juice box?

272
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:57,033
[chuckles]
Nah, this'll just take a second.

273
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:59,001
Okay, well,
I'll leave my door open.

274
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:00,903
If you need anything,
just holler.

275
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:04,941
[thunder rumbling]

276
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:30,532
[Greg and Bray
speaking indistinctly]

277
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,669
Hey, Mom.
Check it out.

278
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:44,446
There. See? The last honest man.

279
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,982
Now, can you turn on
the Weather Channel

280
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:47,515
and set the table?

281
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:58,160
[weathercaster] <i>...Pensacola
and Morgan City, Louisiana.</i>

282
00:16:58,194 --> 00:17:01,163
<i>So, hurricane warnings
are up as Hazel becomes</i>

283
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:03,698
<i>a Category 1 hurricane
later tonight</i>

284
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,768
<i>or early tomorrow morning,
coming onshore somewhere there</i>

285
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,504
<i>between Mobile, New Orleans,
and Pensacola...</i>

286
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:11,473
Bessie?
Let's not color on the table.

287
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:13,575
Okay? And can you please
take out the garbage?

288
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:14,609
Okay, Mommy.

289
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:16,112
[indistinct chatter on TV]

290
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:19,015
What's for dinner?
Wait. Let me guess.

291
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:23,585
Red beans and rice
or microwaved chicken nuggets

292
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:24,519
and a salad.

293
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:27,522
What would you prefer?
Lobster tails?

294
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:28,757
Wouldn't you?

295
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:32,128
- I want pizza.
- Not tonight, honey.

296
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:42,138
Missy? Come here.

297
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,074
Greg is in geek heaven.

298
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,180
What do you expect? The poor kid
is surrounded by girls.

299
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:53,950
How much are you paying
this guy anyway?

300
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,484
Nothing.

301
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:05,694
You gotta admit. You coming
out here looking for her,

302
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:08,697
then she runs into you?
That's pretty weird.

303
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,101
- Is it?
- Yeah.

304
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:15,071
Because, you know,
what are the odds?

305
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,808
Or maybe she's just
a lousy driver.

306
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,214
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain pattering]

307
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:27,615
Uh-oh. Here comes Hazel.

308
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:34,123
Hey, how's it going?

309
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,193
Well, it's good,
if you let this dry.

310
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,561
It'll outlast the apocalypse.

311
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:42,231
Okay, why don't you come inside,
wash your hands?

312
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:44,833
Much obliged.

313
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:48,938
Greg, come on!

314
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:57,113
I don't want you
missing anymore school.

315
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:02,018
Uh, you'll have
to excuse the mess.

316
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:04,753
I wasn't expecting company
as you can probably tell.

317
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:06,654
The paper towels and dish soap
are right there.

318
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,258
And the beer in the fridge
has your name on it.

319
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,527
- Oh, thank you.
- Mom, Bray's a professor.

320
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:15,131
I heard.
Uh, what brings you down here?

321
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:17,866
Well, it's, uh...

322
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:20,668
kind of a long story, actually.

323
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,173
Oh. I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

324
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:26,942
No, no,
I don't mean it like that.

325
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:28,710
[beeping]

326
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:32,547
- [groans] Mom!
- What?

327
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:34,150
You put the chicken
in the microwave

328
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,618
still in the bag,
and now it's all melted.

329
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,853
Yes, I sure did.

330
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:42,624
I guess it is red beans tonight.

331
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,161
- Pizza!
- [Greg] Yeah!

332
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:49,697
Guys, that's not gonna happen.
Poor people can't afford pizza.

333
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:53,202
We're not poor. We're broke.
There's a difference.

334
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,637
You were saying?

335
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,772
[heavy rain pattering]

336
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,378
One second.

337
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,711
Guys?

338
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,250
Nice, huh?
It's our little version

339
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:10,685
of <i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>
With pots.

340
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,222
[rain dripping into pots]

341
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,897
[wind howling]

342
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:24,266
Wind scares me.

343
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,404
Well, nature can be
very powerful,

344
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,639
- but so are you.
- Me? No way.

345
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:33,242
Oh, yes, you are.

346
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:37,046
But we have to be careful...

347
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:41,083
because we get what we expect.

348
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,819
- Mommy? Is that true?
- What, honey?

349
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,889
What do you call this?

350
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:49,624
A crab riding a bike?

351
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:52,027
What else?

352
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:53,896
A magnet.

353
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:56,999
Which attracts things

354
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:01,703
with a force
that you cannot see,

355
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:05,040
but is definitely real.

356
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:09,211
Your thoughts work the same way.

357
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:12,014
The more you think
about something,

358
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:14,049
the more you draw it to you.

359
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,853
Okay. So, this is me
thinking about pizza.

360
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:20,956
Are you really being serious
right now?

361
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:25,094
I like when the cheese
is all melted and gooey.

362
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:27,029
Mm. And what about you?

363
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:30,099
- Pepperoni and sausage.
- Oh. And stuffed crust.

364
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,368
- That's what makes it.
- [laughter]

365
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:34,436
[knocking at door]

366
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:44,880
Okay. I've got a medium cheese
and medium pepperoni

367
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:47,316
with stuffed crust
for Miranda Wells.

368
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:49,919
Did you do this?

369
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:52,188
Don't look at me.

370
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:59,228
You got the right name,
but we did not order those.

371
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:00,828
A guy named Tucker called it in.

372
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,464
He even left a tip
'cause of the storm.

373
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:05,301
[Miranda] That was so nice.
Thank you.

374
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:07,236
- [man] Stay dry.
- You too.

375
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:08,803
Thanks.

376
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,408
- [car engine revs]
- [Miranda clears throat]

377
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:16,045
Okay, girls.

378
00:22:16,844 --> 00:22:19,048
- Wash your hands.
- [Bessie] Okay, Mom.

379
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,450
[Missy] We got pizza!
How cool is that?

380
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:26,788
Well, um,
I think I should be going.

381
00:22:27,189 --> 00:22:29,291
Oh, yeah. No.

382
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:32,094
Of course. Sorry.

383
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:33,362
Thank you.

384
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:36,398
[Greg] Mom?
You smashed his truck.

385
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:37,865
Ask him to stay.

386
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:41,904
Tucker is hardcore buying
my love right now

387
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:43,405
and it is so working.

388
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,773
His family owns a restaurant
on the water.

389
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:47,876
Middendorf's.
And I run it.

390
00:22:48,877 --> 00:22:51,080
- And him too, I guess.
- Ah.

391
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:53,748
She doesn't like to call him
a boyfriend because he's 43.

392
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:55,017
Eat your pizza.

393
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:58,988
He sounds like a kind man
who recognizes a good person.

394
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:00,990
Are you, like,
a Buddhist or something?

395
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:02,790
Missy,
what kind of question is that?

396
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:05,394
I don't know.
You just seem different.

397
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:07,496
Unlike Mom.
Always stressed.

398
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:10,466
- I'm not always stressed.
- You so are!

399
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:12,234
Bessie,
will you back me up here?

400
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:13,435
Am I always stressed?

401
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:15,571
- Yes.
- Traitor.

402
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,339
You're exhausted the minute
you wake up.

403
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,441
Okay. All right.
I see how it goes.

404
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:22,177
Everybody gang up on Mom,
who works all day

405
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:24,380
and has friends like Tucker.
And if it wasn't for her,

406
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:26,515
you guys would all be
eating microwaved plastic.

407
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:29,418
- Yeah. What he said. Cheers.
- Cheers.

408
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,921
You guys are funny.

409
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:34,890
Okay. Homework time.

410
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:36,458
- Dishes in the sink.
- I should be going.

411
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:38,927
And, no. I'm not a Buddhist.

412
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:42,064
I just...
I'm open to the possibility

413
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:44,466
that whatever happens,
even the bad stuff,

414
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,868
can lead to better things.

415
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:50,339
Not in this house.

416
00:23:57,212 --> 00:23:59,281
[rain pouring]

417
00:23:59,682 --> 00:24:01,550
Oh! Leave it to a hurricane

418
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,218
to ruin a perfectly
good evening.

419
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,988
You're not driving back
to Nashville tonight, are you?

420
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:08,290
No. Not tonight.
No. I got a place downtown.

421
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:10,526
But, uh, listen.

422
00:24:11,193 --> 00:24:13,262
About today.
I just wanna say that everything

423
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:17,333
was... I don't know,
really unexpected.

424
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:18,434
[chuckles]

425
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,437
Yeah.
I never thought I'd say this,

426
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,206
but it was a pleasure
running into you.

427
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:26,375
- [chuckles]
- You have quite a family.

428
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,211
Thanks.

429
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:31,613
They're good kids.

430
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:37,519
I meant to say
something earlier,

431
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:40,155
- but the timing just...
- [Bessie screams]

432
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,958
- [Bessie] <i>Mom! Spider!</i>
- [Greg] <i>I wanna see!</i>

433
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:46,028
And, uh, back to my life.

434
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:48,430
[Missy screams]
<i>Mom, here. Please.</i>

435
00:24:49,498 --> 00:24:51,367
- Good night.
- Good night.

436
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,504
[indistinct chatter]

437
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:25,667
[wind howling]

438
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:36,578
[weathercaster over TV]
<i>This is a triple-threat storm</i>

439
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:38,313
<i>as it heads in.
And it looks like</i>

440
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:40,516
<i>it's gonna make landfall
probably late tonight</i>

441
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:41,950
<i>or early tomorrow morning.</i>

442
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:44,286
<i>As you can see,
the satellite shows it</i>

443
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,188
<i>has a very
circular presentation,</i>

444
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:48,090
<i>indicative of a healthy storm.</i>

445
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:51,126
<i>The good news is,
as Hazel makes landfall,</i>

446
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,495
<i>she should become
a tropical storm once again,</i>

447
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,465
<i>with sustained winds
of 50 to 70 miles an hour,</i>

448
00:25:56,498 --> 00:25:58,600
<i>and could miss Louisiana
altogether.</i>

449
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:02,171
- Yeah, right.
- [phone ringing]

450
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:05,207
[reporter] <i>...expect to see
when the storm actually hits?</i>

451
00:26:05,441 --> 00:26:08,076
[weathercaster] <i>This storm will
have a large amount of rain.</i>

452
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,446
<i>But it will be the wind that
will cause the most damage.</i>

453
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,548
<i>Historically,
wind causes the most damage</i>

454
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:14,583
<i>in this type of storm,
toppling trees</i>

455
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,585
- <i>and downing powerlines...</i>
- [TV turns off]

456
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:42,511
- [glass shatters]
- [Miranda gasps]

457
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,722
[wind howling]

458
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,562
Oh, my God.

459
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,569
We're just gonna go
into the bathroom, okay?

460
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:10,472
Hurry up. Why don't you guys
hop in the tub? It's safe.

461
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:12,074
[Bessie] Why are we getting
in the bathtub?

462
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:14,142
[Miranda] 'Cause it's kind of...
Remember when Daddy

463
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,111
would take us camping and we
all huddled together

464
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:17,479
- like an adventure?
- [rumbling]

465
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:18,680
[kids scream]

466
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:20,616
[rumbling and creaking]

467
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:30,786
[Miranda] Hey, guys.

468
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,321
Watch your feet.
Watch your feet.

469
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,573
Mom, are you okay?

470
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:55,143
Trying to be.

471
00:28:56,645 --> 00:28:58,146
What are we gonna do?

472
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,356
If the cereal is dry,
grab a bowl and eat something

473
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:08,724
before the milk goes bad.

474
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:11,693
But why does this
always happen to us?

475
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,196
We're unlucky, I guess.

476
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:18,734
Come on.
Let's get you some Cheerios.

477
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:21,136
One, two, three!

478
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:22,905
Good girl.

479
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:50,499
Huh.

480
00:30:23,632 --> 00:30:24,833
Are you all okay?

481
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:28,270
[scoffs]

482
00:30:30,338 --> 00:30:31,339
I swear.

483
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,676
My whole life
is like that gut feeling

484
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,745
that something really bad
is going to happen,

485
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:37,880
and then...

486
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:40,248
it does.

487
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:43,719
Coffee?

488
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:45,620
Thanks.

489
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:49,591
What are you doing here?

490
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,029
Well, I couldn't very well
leave without knowing

491
00:30:53,062 --> 00:30:54,262
you all were all right.

492
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:58,366
Do you have
homeowner's insurance?

493
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:00,903
You mean the only one
I could afford,

494
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:03,572
with the $5,000 deductible?
Story of my life.

495
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,775
You know,
things don't have to be a series

496
00:31:06,808 --> 00:31:08,643
of unfortunate events.

497
00:31:08,878 --> 00:31:10,812
Well, it sure as hell
feels that way.

498
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:14,549
I know, but...

499
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,320
I've found that when I think
about what I want

500
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:22,324
instead of what I don't want
my life is just so much better.

501
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,727
You're one of those people
who wakes up happy, aren't you?

502
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:28,597
- Let me help.
- How?

503
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:31,500
With more magic foam?

504
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:35,004
I just renovated this nice
little Tennessee farmhouse.

505
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:38,340
This won't be a problem.
It'll just take time and...

506
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,644
And money.
Both of which I... I don't have.

507
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:44,013
Not as much as you think.

508
00:31:44,713 --> 00:31:46,715
[scoffs]
Yeah.

509
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:49,919
Look, with the price of lumber
being what it is,

510
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:51,653
we might have to improvise
a little.

511
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:55,024
But the main goal is to get you
back into a dry house. Yeah?

512
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:56,926
Yeah,
that would be a good start.

513
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,996
- Let's say $500.
- Five hundred?

514
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:01,363
Materials.

515
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:04,566
A roof costs, like, 10,000.

516
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,436
Like I said, we might have
to improvise a little.

517
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:10,872
But I've got all the tools
in the truck

518
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:12,942
and I don't have to be back
at class for a week.

519
00:32:15,144 --> 00:32:16,645
Why are you helping me?

520
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:19,882
Because I can.

521
00:32:23,718 --> 00:32:24,719
Okay.

522
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:27,789
You're hired.

523
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,899
But only 'cause you
brought me coffee.

524
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:39,035
Thank you.

525
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:56,919
Oh, honey. No, no, no.

526
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,089
- Don't throw those away.
- They're wet.

527
00:33:00,422 --> 00:33:01,523
[Miranda] Yeah,
but they'll dry.

528
00:33:01,556 --> 00:33:04,026
And these are the most
important things in the house.

529
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,493
[Bessie] This one's my favorite.

530
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,029
[Miranda] Hmm, mine too.

531
00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:09,031
Missy's right.

532
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:11,968
I said I had a pony
when I didn't.

533
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:14,536
[Miranda] Okay. Well...

534
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:18,107
this is a pony,
and you have this, right?

535
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,844
[sighs]
Mom?

536
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:25,513
What are we gonna do
about my party?

537
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,848
It's in five days.

538
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:32,787
- We'll figure it out.
- How?

539
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:34,522
Look at this place.

540
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,026
I think we should cancel.

541
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:40,495
No.

542
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:42,397
No.

543
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:43,900
No.

544
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:46,601
I know you think that parents
have all the answers,

545
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,703
but we don't.
Not by the longest shot,

546
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:52,008
but you know what?
You only turn 16 once.

547
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:54,010
And we're gonna have a party.

548
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:55,945
Where'd you get the coffee?

549
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,713
So, it looks like
these two rafters are split.

550
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:00,883
Otherwise, it's a clean hole.

551
00:34:01,783 --> 00:34:02,952
Meaning what, exactly?

552
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:05,087
- Hey, Bray.
- Hey, guys.

553
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:09,225
So, to re-skin this section,
I don't know.

554
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:12,929
It'll be about 150.
And then the two-by-ten's,

555
00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:16,665
a roll of tar paper, some nails,
you're still less than 200.

556
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:19,567
And sheet-rocking the ceiling
and re-insulating.

557
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:21,636
Maybe another 200?

558
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:24,439
What's he doing here?

559
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:30,512
- He's fixing the roof.
- How? We're broke, remember?

560
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:32,114
[sighs]
I don't know.

561
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:34,083
Magnets.

562
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:37,819
[car horn honking]

563
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:41,856
Oh, look! Nana's here.

564
00:34:45,227 --> 00:34:46,528
[Bobby] Oh.

565
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:48,563
Oh!

566
00:34:49,198 --> 00:34:53,501
Oh, my Lord!
Is everybody okay?

567
00:34:53,535 --> 00:34:55,972
- Anybody get hurt?
- We slept in a bathtub!

568
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:56,906
You slept in the bathtub?

569
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,242
- There's a hole in the roof.
- Oh, that is so scary.

570
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:02,278
I have been trying
to call you all night.

571
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,745
Well, cell towers
must have been down.

572
00:35:03,778 --> 00:35:06,182
Mom was so cool.
She didn't panic or nothing.

573
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:07,984
She didn't panic or "anything."

574
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:09,718
Look at this mess.

575
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:12,021
What did I tell you
about that house?

576
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:13,588
And now... Who is that?

577
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:15,857
Oh, that's Bray.

578
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:17,059
He's gonna fix the roof.

579
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:18,560
Just like he fixed Mom's bumper.

580
00:35:18,593 --> 00:35:19,728
He had pizza with us.

581
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:21,931
- What pizza?
- [Miranda] Stuffed crust.

582
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,900
Yes. Bray is going to try
to fix the roof.

583
00:35:25,267 --> 00:35:27,036
- Bray?
- Is he licensed?

584
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,803
He's from Tennessee.

585
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:31,073
Can you say hello
to my mother-in-law, Bobby?

586
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,042
- Bobby, Bray.
- Bobby, Bray.

587
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:34,977
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh-huh. And you.

588
00:35:35,277 --> 00:35:36,946
Mom smashed into him
with the van.

589
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:40,715
I didn't smash into him.
I tapped his bumper.

590
00:35:40,749 --> 00:35:43,152
- And yours fell off.
- [laughter]

591
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:44,552
What's the verdict?

592
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:47,689
I'm gonna swing by the lumber
yard, pick up some materials.

593
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:49,691
Also see if I can snag a blower
or two

594
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:50,893
and get those floors dry.

595
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:53,329
Well, we'll be here.

596
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:56,831
Oh, no, you won't.
These children can't stay here.

597
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:58,300
Why not?
Their bedrooms are dry.

598
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:02,038
Honey, I have two words for you,
black mold.

599
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:04,706
And Greg is sick already
as it is.

600
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:06,909
- Well, what about school?
- The power's out,

601
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:09,611
and the radio said they're
closed today and tomorrow.

602
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:10,645
[kids] Yes!

603
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,916
Why not spend a few nights
with me

604
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:15,850
and just maybe
come up with a plan?

605
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:18,020
Sure. You're right.

606
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,755
Why don't you guys go pack up
some clothes?

607
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:22,024
We're gonna go to Nana's.

608
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,995
Two minutes, you have.
Don't pack everything.

609
00:36:26,028 --> 00:36:27,029
[Bobby] Fun!

610
00:36:27,695 --> 00:36:29,731
- Thank you.
- Thank you, honey.

611
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,168
Um, do you think we could stop
by the restaurant

612
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,936
on the way out?
I wanna check on Tuck.

613
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,038
Who is this complete stranger

614
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:38,573
that you are trusting
your home with?

615
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:41,043
Not everyone
is a serial killer, Bobby.

616
00:36:41,077 --> 00:36:43,711
I mean, he's a college
professor for goodness sake.

617
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:47,283
Well, you can't be too careful
these days.

618
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,752
The only thing of value
in that house are the kids,

619
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:52,354
and they're coming with us.

620
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,857
So, I'm just gonna believe
that he's not gonna screw us

621
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:58,060
and he's gonna do the best job
he can.

622
00:36:58,327 --> 00:36:59,929
Have you met people lately?

623
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,771
So, we'll get out
of your hair then.

624
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,840
She seems worried about you.

625
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:15,710
Well, we're all used to playing
defense around here.

626
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:18,981
But I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

627
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:22,684
- What am I trying to do?
- Give us hope.

628
00:37:23,385 --> 00:37:25,955
But I am trying to raise
my kids to be realistic.

629
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:29,657
Their father was a dreamer,
and apparently that's genetic,

630
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:30,926
especially with Greg.

631
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,895
And I just want to keep
their feet

632
00:37:32,928 --> 00:37:34,662
firmly planted on the ground.

633
00:37:35,097 --> 00:37:36,932
- Roger that.
- And your next question

634
00:37:36,966 --> 00:37:39,101
is about my husband,
but you're too polite to ask.

635
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,904
He died
just over five years ago.

636
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:45,141
I'm sorry, truly.

637
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:49,677
Me too.
He's really missing out.

638
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:53,748
We should exchange our numbers,
right?

639
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:55,417
[Bray] Yes, of course.

640
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:13,202
Oh, Tuck.

641
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:15,171
Nice, huh?

642
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,273
It's a good thing
we boarded it up.

643
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:18,806
But we're all right.

644
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:21,443
- How is everyone?
- Uh, fine.

645
00:38:21,477 --> 00:38:23,245
We had some damage to our roof,

646
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:24,779
but I have someone
working on it.

647
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:26,916
And we're gonna head
to Bobby's for a few days.

648
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:28,250
You all could have stayed
with me.

649
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:29,285
Do you wanna tell her that?

650
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:31,153
Hell no.
She'd never forgive me.

651
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:33,088
And I'm trying to stay
on her good side.

652
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,789
Who's doing your roof?

653
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:36,125
Oh, just a guy.
You don't know him.

654
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,726
- Okay.
- So, I'm gonna get them settled,

655
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,795
and I'll borrow her car,
and I'll come back and help you.

656
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:42,097
No. You take care
of business.

657
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:44,033
- I'll call you later.
- Really?

658
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:45,467
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

659
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:47,002
- Okay.
- See you, Bob!

660
00:38:51,073 --> 00:38:53,342
Has Tucker lost weight?
He looks good.

661
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,077
Uh, nope. I don't think so.

662
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,880
Any developments
I should know about?

663
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,782
- Why rock the boat?
- Cause he's a good man.

664
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:04,486
I know that's a strange thing
for a mother-in-law to say,

665
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,757
but I also know that, you know,
it can be hard to move on.

666
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:13,861
I'm a widow, too, remember?

667
00:39:14,196 --> 00:39:16,098
I just don't see the point
in forcing something

668
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:18,133
that neither one of us
needs or wants.

669
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:39,922
[blower whirring]

670
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,062
[clerk] Sign here.

671
00:40:21,297 --> 00:40:22,331
Thank you.

672
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:26,335
- [clerk] Hi. Hello.
- Hi, I'm Bray Johnson.

673
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,271
Is that his?
Is that that guy's?

674
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:30,939
- Excuse me. Is that yours?
- Oh, my God.

675
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:34,209
- Hey, I'm Matt Wells.
- Bray Johnson. How you doing?

676
00:40:34,243 --> 00:40:36,111
[Matt] <i>Can I get you
a drink or something?</i>

677
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:38,080
[Bray] <i>Okay, I'm just saying,</i>

678
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:41,150
if I could put pressure at six,
six point zero, six three...

679
00:40:42,418 --> 00:40:44,253
Gentlemen, this is Matt,

680
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:45,988
the inventor
I was talking about.

681
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:47,323
[phone ringing]

682
00:40:52,895 --> 00:40:54,630
Hey, I've been meaning
to call you.

683
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:55,531
[Jennifer] <i>How'd it go?</i>

684
00:40:55,964 --> 00:41:00,069
- Did you survive big bad Hazel?
- [Bray] <i>Uh, yes and no.</i>

685
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:02,037
I might have to stick around
a few more days.

686
00:41:02,071 --> 00:41:03,172
Do you mind?

687
00:41:03,205 --> 00:41:05,541
Not at all.
So, what happened?

688
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,510
Huh, I'm not quite sure.

689
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:10,612
I think the universe
is trying to tell me something.

690
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:14,416
What did she say
when you gave it to her?

691
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:18,520
Well, that's the thing. I, uh...

692
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:20,855
I haven't told her yet.

693
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:23,425
Well, why the hell not?

694
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,996
That is what I am trying
to figure out.

695
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:36,038
Where are all the kids?

696
00:41:36,638 --> 00:41:39,575
Well, we're mostly grown-ups
here who've retired.

697
00:41:39,608 --> 00:41:41,076
So, where are they?

698
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,578
They're just sitting
in their houses,

699
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:44,079
watching <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

700
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:48,984
It may not look it, but this is
a very active community.

701
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:53,088
We got golf and swimming
and yoga and...

702
00:41:53,522 --> 00:41:57,326
We just like to keep things
nice and neat and safe and...

703
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,596
Oh, my gosh!
We got a pond and a gazebo.

704
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:02,564
What's a gazebo do?

705
00:42:02,598 --> 00:42:04,400
Just looks pretty.

706
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:07,002
It's where old people sit
and complain about their knees

707
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:08,036
- and stuff.
- Missy.

708
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,306
- What? You said it.
- [Bobby] Let's just go in.

709
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,443
[chainsaw whirring]

710
00:42:29,057 --> 00:42:30,559
That is a big hole!

711
00:42:33,162 --> 00:42:34,296
Sorry, what?

712
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:35,697
[Tucker] They were damn lucky.

713
00:42:37,132 --> 00:42:38,133
You the roof guy?

714
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:41,437
Today I am.
Name's Bray.

715
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,106
Tuck Middendorf.
I own the place on the water.

716
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:45,541
Miranda wanted me to check in.

717
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:47,409
Uh, you're the one
who sent the pizza.

718
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:49,611
- Yeah. How did you...
- [Bray] You scored a bunch

719
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:51,280
of points there, my friend.

720
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,981
Oh, yeah?

721
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,051
How do you know Miranda?

722
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:58,187
Oh, well, I don't, really.

723
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:00,956
Why are you fixing her roof?

724
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:03,325
[chuckles]
That's a very good question.

725
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:06,361
Hey, could you, uh, grab me
that parachute bag there?

726
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:09,965
Yeah.
No, that one, yeah.

727
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:11,533
You can throw it on up here.

728
00:43:22,344 --> 00:43:23,378
There you go.

729
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:24,713
- [Bray] Do you want a hand?
- Yeah.

730
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:26,415
Thanks.

731
00:43:29,585 --> 00:43:31,053
Heck of a view up here.

732
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:32,754
[Bray] Yeah,
that's why guys do roofs.

733
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:38,126
Oh, yeah, this whole section's
gonna have to be replaced.

734
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,363
[Bray] Yeah, I'm gonna re-sheet
and re-paper tomorrow.

735
00:43:41,396 --> 00:43:44,366
Forecast says there's no rain
coming, so it's all good.

736
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:46,168
- But you're not licensed.
- No, no.

737
00:43:46,201 --> 00:43:48,136
I'm just lending a hand.

738
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:50,305
Well, I wish Miranda had
checked with me.

739
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,107
I would have paid to hire
a real roofer.

740
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:53,742
No offense.

741
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:55,611
None taken.

742
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:58,480
She's stubborn that way.

743
00:43:59,748 --> 00:44:01,483
How long have you two
been together?

744
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:04,152
Oh, a few years.

745
00:44:04,954 --> 00:44:08,423
She came to work for me about
a year after her husband died.

746
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:11,593
Good guy too,
from what I hear.

747
00:44:12,728 --> 00:44:14,463
That must have been really
painful.

748
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,199
Widowed. Three kids.

749
00:44:17,232 --> 00:44:19,101
I think it's made her more
cautious.

750
00:44:21,236 --> 00:44:22,070
I'm the same way.

751
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:23,639
Why I haven't
pushed things farther.

752
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:24,706
You know?

753
00:44:25,008 --> 00:44:27,276
Well, things can change
if you want them to.

754
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,245
I just want her to be happy.

755
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:33,815
Can't say I blame you.

756
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,718
- What I want...
- Nice meeting you, Bray.

757
00:44:36,752 --> 00:44:38,120
Oh, yeah. You too, Tucker.

758
00:44:38,153 --> 00:44:39,788
Give me a shout if this
gets to be too much.

759
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:41,290
[Bray] Will do.

760
00:44:43,893 --> 00:44:45,193
[Bobby] Oh.

761
00:44:46,795 --> 00:44:48,196
[chuckles]

762
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:50,532
Why do people like puzzles?

763
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:52,301
They don't.

764
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:54,636
They just need something
to do when they're bored.

765
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,072
Oh! You make this sound
like prison.

766
00:44:57,472 --> 00:44:59,308
[Greg]
Look at all these pieces.

767
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:03,312
- This is gonna take us a week.
- [Missy] Forever.

768
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:06,348
Now, look.
I know you love that house.

769
00:45:06,648 --> 00:45:09,251
- But I think we...
- Can we not do this right now?

770
00:45:09,484 --> 00:45:11,853
I was in real estate
for 40 years.

771
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:14,556
That place could sell in a day.

772
00:45:15,157 --> 00:45:17,292
Or it could take a year
and a half.

773
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:18,827
You don't have that kind
of time.

774
00:45:19,062 --> 00:45:21,898
[sighs] It's too much for me
to think about right now.

775
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:25,601
Well, that's all I'm asking
is, you know,

776
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:27,502
that you think about it.

777
00:45:29,538 --> 00:45:31,740
I mean, y'all
on top of each other.

778
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:35,177
Those girls
need another bedroom.

779
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:39,147
You could get your money out
and then some.

780
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:40,649
Not with a hole in the roof.

781
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:45,654
Oh, honey, you and I both know
that that house is a tear-down.

782
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,269
[phone ringing]

783
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:04,406
- [Miranda] <i>Hi.</i>
- Hey! Hey.

784
00:46:04,439 --> 00:46:06,141
I thought you might like
a status update.

785
00:46:06,441 --> 00:46:07,910
[Miranda]
Only if it's good news.

786
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:11,446
Well, I ran out of daylight,
but once the power comes back on

787
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,215
I should be done
the day after tomorrow.

788
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:16,251
- That's fantastic.
- [Bray] <i>I got rid of that limb,</i>

789
00:46:16,284 --> 00:46:17,853
<i>I did a little triage
on the hole.</i>

790
00:46:18,353 --> 00:46:20,589
The floors seem fine,
but I'll still run the blower

791
00:46:20,622 --> 00:46:22,791
- all night just to make sure.
- [Miranda] <i>I don't care</i>

792
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:24,726
<i>about that just as long
as we're dry.</i>

793
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:27,596
All right. Well,
I'll check back in tomorrow.

794
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,698
Wait, Bray.

795
00:46:36,471 --> 00:46:37,606
Where are you?

796
00:46:38,807 --> 00:46:40,342
What are you doing right now?

797
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:43,980
I'm sitting on your roof,
taking in this gorgeous sunset.

798
00:46:44,013 --> 00:46:44,914
You?

799
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:49,785
Stressing.

800
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:52,654
Is it about the money?

801
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:55,624
No. It's everything. I...

802
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:59,828
My job, kids, Tucker.

803
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:05,434
I think I might actually have
to sell the house.

804
00:47:06,568 --> 00:47:08,004
Ooh, that's a big one.

805
00:47:08,037 --> 00:47:10,439
No kidding. I just know
somebody's going to scoop it up

806
00:47:10,472 --> 00:47:12,975
and tear it down.
And it just breaks my heart.

807
00:47:13,675 --> 00:47:16,645
Look. When the time is right,
you'll know what to do.

808
00:47:17,446 --> 00:47:19,648
Is that another one
of your life lessons?

809
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:22,784
I went through a divorce
ten years ago.

810
00:47:22,818 --> 00:47:24,553
It really knocked me on my ass.

811
00:47:24,987 --> 00:47:26,254
Were there kids?

812
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:27,924
No, no.

813
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:29,624
We wanted to save up
a little money

814
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:31,526
before starting a family
and it turns out

815
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,462
she started one
with somebody else.

816
00:47:34,296 --> 00:47:35,898
Oh, my God.
That...

817
00:47:36,765 --> 00:47:38,500
You must have been...

818
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,602
Devastated. Yeah.

819
00:47:41,269 --> 00:47:43,505
And then I got angry
and started blaming

820
00:47:43,538 --> 00:47:45,340
everything on everybody else.

821
00:47:46,308 --> 00:47:47,609
That doesn't sound like you.

822
00:47:49,478 --> 00:47:51,680
Not anymore.
That was before.

823
00:47:52,215 --> 00:47:53,415
[Miranda] <i>Before?</i>

824
00:47:54,716 --> 00:47:56,518
Before another kind
of wake-up call.

825
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:02,959
Well... I didn't mean to pry.

826
00:48:02,992 --> 00:48:04,726
No, no, no, no, you didn't.

827
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:08,697
It's just that sometimes
the best thing to do is...

828
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:13,602
wait till everything
becomes clear.

829
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,778
Well, that's great news
about the house, Professor.

830
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:24,914
Thank you.

831
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:27,749
You're welcome.
And have a good evening.

832
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,619
- [Miranda] <i>Good night.</i>
- Good night.

833
00:48:33,588 --> 00:48:34,723
[sighs]

834
00:49:00,749 --> 00:49:02,919
- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
- Good morning, Sloane.

835
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:05,922
I heard you extended your stay.

836
00:49:06,255 --> 00:49:08,390
Yeah, I'm just trying to make
myself useful

837
00:49:08,423 --> 00:49:09,926
to a friend up in Madisonville.

838
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:12,694
Which reminds me, I'm expecting
a pretty important package

839
00:49:12,727 --> 00:49:13,762
in the next few days.

840
00:49:13,795 --> 00:49:15,097
Could you keep your eyes
open for it?

841
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:18,100
- Important package. You got it.
- Thanks.

842
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:22,972
[Bobby] Keep holding it
over like that,

843
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,773
'cause you won't spill anything.

844
00:49:24,806 --> 00:49:27,409
Oh! Bobby.
What are you doing here?

845
00:49:27,442 --> 00:49:28,743
We're helping Mommy.

846
00:49:28,777 --> 00:49:31,379
Northshore Food Bank
put out a call,

847
00:49:31,413 --> 00:49:33,748
and Miranda thought
you might be able to help.

848
00:49:33,782 --> 00:49:36,052
There are a lot of people
on this side of the lake

849
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:37,786
without power.
I didn't think you'd mind

850
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:40,589
- putting all this to good use.
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

851
00:49:40,622 --> 00:49:42,858
But I could have asked Manny
or Charmaine to help.

852
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:45,928
- You didn't have to come in.
- Oh, well, it is a workday.

853
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:47,930
Well, maybe
she just missed you.

854
00:49:47,964 --> 00:49:50,765
- You ever think of that?
- You did?

855
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:52,367
What?

856
00:49:52,734 --> 00:49:54,636
Oh, uh, nothing.
[chuckles]

857
00:49:54,669 --> 00:49:56,638
So, after we drop this off,
we're gonna skedaddle.

858
00:49:56,671 --> 00:49:57,572
I'll call you later.

859
00:49:57,606 --> 00:49:59,641
You know, I thought I might
show Miranda

860
00:49:59,674 --> 00:50:02,078
that new housing development
out by me.

861
00:50:02,644 --> 00:50:05,447
You know, 'cause she's thinking
about selling her place.

862
00:50:05,948 --> 00:50:08,516
- You are?
- No.

863
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:12,654
I checked Zillow this morning.
Lots of listings.

864
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:15,624
But after this storm,
yours is gonna stand out.

865
00:50:15,657 --> 00:50:17,126
I'm just saying is all.

866
00:50:17,425 --> 00:50:20,729
If we move, how will Santa know
where to find us?

867
00:50:20,762 --> 00:50:21,998
[Bobby] Oh, honey.

868
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:24,833
When you move,
Mommy will fill out a change

869
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:26,701
of address card.

870
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:28,938
And the post office
will send that

871
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:31,173
straight to the North Pole.

872
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:33,742
What's wrong with our house?

873
00:50:33,775 --> 00:50:35,510
Oh, everything, sweetheart.

874
00:50:35,844 --> 00:50:36,913
Bobby?

875
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:37,880
[sighs]

876
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,151
I gotta go. Payroll doesn't stop
just 'cause the power's out.

877
00:50:43,718 --> 00:50:46,055
- I'll call you later.

Cinnamon Toast Crunch?

Now, that is protein.
That is good for muscles.

00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,129

I'm sorry, honey.

Well, that's because
it's gluten-free.

And when you get to be my age,
you'll thank me.

What's gluten?

927
00:53:52,241 --> 00:53:54,276
It's... That's a thing in food.

[phone beeps]

929
00:53:55,743 --> 00:53:58,780
Mm! "Hi, gang. The power's back
on at the house,

930
00:53:58,813 --> 00:53:59,882
and the roof is fixed."

931
00:53:59,915 --> 00:54:00,950
- Yes.
- Yes.

932
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:02,218
Oh, no, already?

933
00:54:18,033 --> 00:54:20,402
Whoa, cool!
A skylight.

934
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:22,804
It's actually kinda legit.

935
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:26,375
- Whoa! Pretty cool!
- How'd you get that up there?

936
00:54:26,408 --> 00:54:28,743
[Miranda] A new ceiling.
Pretty impressive.

937
00:54:28,776 --> 00:54:31,113
What exactly is that thing
on the roof?

938
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:35,251
Um, weather-proof Band-Aid.

939
00:54:35,284 --> 00:54:38,420
- Where'd it come from?
- It just appeared.

940
00:54:38,621 --> 00:54:40,890
- Like the pizza?
- No. No, no.

941
00:54:40,923 --> 00:54:43,459
That was because of Tucker,
and this is because Bray

942
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:45,995
worked really, really hard
to find something that'd fit.

943
00:54:46,028 --> 00:54:48,130
It was probably floating
around in the bayou

944
00:54:48,164 --> 00:54:50,633
waiting to be useful.
And then it found me.

945
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,002
Or it was just a coincidence.

946
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:57,273
Um, "coincidence is God's way
of remaining anonymous."

947
00:54:57,573 --> 00:54:58,840
Who said that?

948
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:00,876
Einstein.

949
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,444
E equals MC squared guy?

950
00:55:03,078 --> 00:55:06,916
He also said that every person
should ask themselves,

951
00:55:06,949 --> 00:55:08,816
"Is this a friendly universe?"

952
00:55:09,251 --> 00:55:10,052
Why?

953
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:14,789
Well, because your answer
determines your life.

954
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:18,961
Are you sure
you're not from California?

955
00:55:18,994 --> 00:55:21,063
[laughs]
No, ma'am.

956
00:55:21,096 --> 00:55:23,731
So, you're saying the magnet
in your head

957
00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:25,401
connected you to that piece
of fiberglass...

958
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:27,036
Okay, gang.
That's enough questions.

959
00:55:27,069 --> 00:55:29,104
This man has a life.
Say goodbye to Bray.

960
00:55:29,305 --> 00:55:31,440
- Bye. Thank you for the roof.
- Bye, Bray.

961
00:55:31,473 --> 00:55:33,108
Um, let me get my checkbook.

962
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:34,809
Okay.

963
00:55:35,277 --> 00:55:37,213
- Let's go to my room.
- Okay, baby.

964
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,451
Could I ask you a question?

965
00:55:43,919 --> 00:55:45,888
- Shoot.
- What happened to the envelope?

966
00:55:48,224 --> 00:55:50,192
I haven't given it to her yet.

967
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,727
Why not?

968
00:55:53,062 --> 00:55:55,431
Well, I put it in the mailbox
after the pizza,

969
00:55:55,464 --> 00:55:57,166
but it flew away.

970
00:55:57,633 --> 00:56:00,236
So, I had to get a new one.

971
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:01,769
What's in it?

972
00:56:02,438 --> 00:56:03,738
Grown-up stuff.

973
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:06,741
But definitely something good.

974
00:56:15,484 --> 00:56:16,418
Here you go.

975
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:18,988
Five hundred very
grateful dollars.

976
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:21,490
Just do me a favor and don't
cash it until next week.

977
00:56:21,523 --> 00:56:22,790
Understood.

978
00:56:24,126 --> 00:56:25,793
So, you're off to Nashville?

979
00:56:26,996 --> 00:56:28,264
Yeah.
[chuckles]

980
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:30,733
I pretty much got my hands
full until winter break.

981
00:56:31,567 --> 00:56:34,003
I still don't understand why
you helped us.

982
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:37,206
I think you and I collided
for a reason.

983
00:56:37,973 --> 00:56:41,510
And who's to say?
Maybe we helped each other.

984
00:56:41,543 --> 00:56:42,544
[Bobby] Miranda?

985
00:56:44,246 --> 00:56:46,382
Honey? It's Tuck.

986
00:56:46,415 --> 00:56:48,450
Oh! Will you tell him
I'll call him back?

987
00:56:48,484 --> 00:56:49,918
[Bobby] He says it's urgent.

988
00:56:50,419 --> 00:56:51,387
Excuse me.

989
00:56:56,058 --> 00:56:58,494
Hi. Um, can I call you back
in, like, two minutes?

990
00:56:58,694 --> 00:57:00,862
[Tucker] <i>Hold on. Do you
and the kids want to come</i>

991
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:02,498
- <i>to the opening tonight?</i>
- [Miranda] Okay.

992
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:04,099
[Tucker] <i>See if Bobby
wants to come too.</i>

993
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:04,967
Sure. Let me check.

994
00:57:05,301 --> 00:57:08,170
Tucker wants to take us all out
for the re-opening.

995
00:57:08,203 --> 00:57:10,805
Um, and he wants to know
if you wanna come.

996
00:57:11,173 --> 00:57:12,408
I wouldn't miss it.

997
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:15,577
- Great. We'll see you at seven.
- [Tucker] <i>All right. Great.</i>

998
00:57:15,778 --> 00:57:17,379
- <i>See you tonight.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

999
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:21,950
So, you were saying?

1000
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:28,357
Something about us
colliding for a reason?

1001
00:57:29,325 --> 00:57:32,294
Yeah. Well, maybe it was just
a chance for me

1002
00:57:32,328 --> 00:57:34,363
to meet a really cool woman.

1003
00:57:34,697 --> 00:57:37,266
You're doing a hell of a job
raising three kids on your own.

1004
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:39,368
Thank you.

1005
00:57:40,302 --> 00:57:43,605
Although, I think I got
the better end of the deal.

1006
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:49,311
Oh, hey, listen, I still have
the chainsaw for another day

1007
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,480
if you want me to free up
your van.

1008
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,882
I can swing by
on my way out tomorrow.

1009
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,084
I could use the firewood.

1010
00:57:55,117 --> 00:57:57,486
- By all means.
- Oh, honey.

1011
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:59,221
Tucker can do it.

1012
00:58:00,055 --> 00:58:01,856
Tucker with a chainsaw?

1013
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:04,660
Okay.

1014
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:07,496
Um, but I'm making the coffee.

1015
00:58:08,097 --> 00:58:09,098
Deal.

- [tapping glass]

1017
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:16,672
Everybody?
If I could have your attention?

1018
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:20,008
Um, I'd like to take this
opportunity

1019
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:22,678
and thank Manny
and all of his peeps

1020
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:25,147
for working their butts off
to get this place

1021
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,049
up and running again.

1022
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:28,517
- [applause]
- Manny!

1023
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:33,989
Every now and then a storm
comes along

1024
00:58:34,022 --> 00:58:36,258
and it not only rattles
your business,

1025
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:40,262
but it rattles your life
and the choices you've made

1026
00:58:40,295 --> 00:58:41,497
in that life.

1027
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:45,634
I, uh...
I've always wanted a family.

1028
00:58:46,468 --> 00:58:50,272
For whatever reason,
it just wasn't in the cards.

1029
00:58:50,305 --> 00:58:54,176
You know, maybe I... I focused
too much on the business.

1030
00:58:56,044 --> 00:58:57,045
But, uh...

1031
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:02,317
I would like to change that
right here and right now.

1032
00:59:09,158 --> 00:59:11,160
[gasps]

1033
00:59:12,728 --> 00:59:15,697
Miranda Wells,
will you marry me?

1034
00:59:23,405 --> 00:59:25,107
- Yeah.
- Yes!

1035
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,478
All right.

1036
00:59:32,748 --> 00:59:34,249
Here we go.

1037
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:36,652
Oh, sorry.

1038
00:59:36,685 --> 00:59:39,054
You know what?
Let's just put it...

1039
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:40,289
We'll fix that later.

1040
00:59:40,622 --> 00:59:42,624
Whatever!
She said yes!

1041
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:44,393
[applause]

1042
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:48,130
Thank you.

1043
00:59:49,498 --> 00:59:50,934
Thank you.

1044
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:53,235
Woo!

1045
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:55,471
- I love that.
- [Bobby] I'm so excited.

1046
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:58,073
- Okay.
- [Tucker] All right.

1047
00:59:59,174 --> 01:00:01,310
Hey. What happened to your van?

1048
01:00:01,343 --> 01:00:03,312
Oh, it's still stuck
behind a tree.

1049
01:00:03,345 --> 01:00:06,281
But not to worry. Her handyman
is gonna chop it up

1050
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:07,716
first thing in the morning.

1051
01:00:07,749 --> 01:00:09,051
My handyman?

1052
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:13,489
Hey. Why don't I spend
the night at the house

1053
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:17,359
so you two lovebirds
can celebrate your engagement?

1054
01:00:17,626 --> 01:00:19,728
Yeah. That would be terrific.

1055
01:00:20,796 --> 01:00:22,297
Yeah. Um,

1056
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:25,667
you guys don't mind
if Nana stays over? Right?

1057
01:00:26,134 --> 01:00:27,536
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yup.

1058
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:30,506
I'll see you in the morning.

1059
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:32,674
Hey. I'm gonna talk to Doug
for one second.

1060
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:34,643
Kids, do not stay up
all night long.

1061
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:35,444
Hey, Doug!

1062
01:00:35,811 --> 01:00:38,480
- Congratulations, Mom.
- [woman] Congrats, Tucker...

1063
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:39,515
Thank you.

1064
01:00:40,048 --> 01:00:41,750
[Bobby] Well, let's get in
the car.

1065
01:00:41,783 --> 01:00:43,285
Goodnight, sweetie.

1066
01:00:46,788 --> 01:00:48,390
[car doors close]

1067
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:57,466
All right. Here we go.
Keep them closed.

1068
01:00:57,499 --> 01:00:59,535
I got you. I got you.

1069
01:00:59,768 --> 01:01:01,770
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

1070
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:03,272
Almost there.

1071
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:05,741
And...

1072
01:01:07,142 --> 01:01:08,143
open.

1073
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:10,212
[Tucker chuckles]

1074
01:01:12,481 --> 01:01:13,348
I spoke to Doug.

1075
01:01:13,682 --> 01:01:16,285
I told him I wanted it here
first thing this morning.

1076
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:18,287
And boom. Here it is.

1077
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,722
- Tucker?
- I cannot have my fiancée

1078
01:01:20,756 --> 01:01:23,358
driving around
in some old minivan.

1079
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,461
What will the neighbors think?

1080
01:01:27,129 --> 01:01:28,263
Huh!

1081
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,301
Wow.

1082
01:01:33,669 --> 01:01:36,672
It's beautiful. Thank you.

1083
01:01:36,705 --> 01:01:37,773
You like it?

1084
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,309
- It's not, uh, too small?
- [car beeps]

1085
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:41,543
Like the ring?

1086
01:01:42,011 --> 01:01:44,580
[scoffs]
I just need to get that sized.

1087
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:46,448
Well, let's go do that
right now.

1088
01:01:46,481 --> 01:01:49,217
I can't, babe. I have to run
errands before work.

1089
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,419
What errands?

1090
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:52,721
I have to get it together
before Missy's party.

1091
01:01:53,455 --> 01:01:56,425
- Party?
- Her 16th birthday, silly.

1092
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:57,894
She talked about it last night.

1093
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:00,796
Right. Yeah. Sorry,
I was a little distracted.

1094
01:02:01,196 --> 01:02:02,899
Well, she's worried all of her
friends are going

1095
01:02:02,932 --> 01:02:04,766
to another party
that has food trucks.

1096
01:02:05,068 --> 01:02:07,202
Well, I can get a food truck.

1097
01:02:07,235 --> 01:02:09,705
No. She doesn't need
a food truck.

1098
01:02:09,738 --> 01:02:11,273
She needs balloons and a cake.

1099
01:02:11,873 --> 01:02:13,675
Well, what should I get her?

1100
01:02:14,043 --> 01:02:16,311
Oh, nothing. Just a card.

1101
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,414
That says what?

1102
01:02:20,816 --> 01:02:22,784
[chainsaw whirring]

1103
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,735
[Bray] You okay?

1104
01:02:40,836 --> 01:02:42,604
[Greg] I don't wanna talk
about it.

1105
01:02:47,509 --> 01:02:50,212
- Which part?
- What do you mean?

1106
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,682
Which part do you not wanna
talk about?

1107
01:02:53,715 --> 01:02:57,152
The reason you're pissed or
that thing you just threw away?

1108
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,821
Both.

1109
01:03:00,856 --> 01:03:01,857
Okay.

1110
01:03:02,391 --> 01:03:04,726
You wanna talk about
the third thing?

1111
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,728
What third thing?

1112
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:09,798
Well, my guess is the reason
you're upset

1113
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:12,534
has nothing to do
with that thing you threw away.

1114
01:03:12,902 --> 01:03:14,369
How would you know that?

1115
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:17,205
Word is your mom got engaged.

1116
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:21,176
Yeah.

1117
01:03:22,945 --> 01:03:25,547
Which I imagine stirs up
a whole boatload of feelings

1118
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,815
about your dad.

1119
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:31,219
Yeah.

1120
01:03:33,555 --> 01:03:35,791
Which I suspect
you just took out on...

1121
01:03:36,324 --> 01:03:39,461
whatever it is that was in that
box you just threw away.

1122
01:03:41,563 --> 01:03:44,599
[chuckles]
Maybe. Yeah.

1123
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:47,736
Did it deserve it?

1124
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:50,472
It was just a stupid invention.

1125
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,774
You mind showing me?

1126
01:03:54,476 --> 01:03:56,578
<i>It's supposed to be
an automatic chicken feeder</i>

1127
01:03:56,611 --> 01:03:58,814
for science class.
If it worked,

1128
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:00,983
I could sell it,
and we could make some money,

1129
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,452
so Mom wouldn't have
to marry Tucker.

1130
01:04:04,453 --> 01:04:05,821
And why would you say that?

1131
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:09,624
- She doesn't love him.
- You sure about that?

1132
01:04:10,592 --> 01:04:11,827
Not like Dad.

1133
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:17,499
All right. Here's the thing.

1134
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:20,635
I think if you took a couple
links out here.

1135
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,270
Right.

1136
01:04:23,538 --> 01:04:25,307
There. And then...

1137
01:04:25,841 --> 01:04:27,877
you increase the tension here.

1138
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:31,246
That should work.

1139
01:04:31,847 --> 01:04:34,649
[machine whirring]

1140
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:38,787
It works.

1141
01:04:40,355 --> 01:04:42,624
- You still wanna throw it out?
- No way!

1142
01:04:43,192 --> 01:04:44,826
Let me tell you something.

1143
01:04:45,293 --> 01:04:48,597
All your dad ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

1144
01:04:49,397 --> 01:04:50,799
How would you know that?

1145
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:56,038
Well, because dad's
are like that.

1146
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:16,458
Why are you so nice to us?

1147
01:05:17,126 --> 01:05:18,693
You get what you give.

1148
01:05:20,997 --> 01:05:23,532
- See?
- That's not true.

1149
01:05:23,565 --> 01:05:24,699
Not when you're 15.

1150
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:28,070
Ah, come on. I think you're
selling yourself short.

1151
01:05:30,806 --> 01:05:33,642
Kit Riley's having her party
tomorrow, same day as mine.

1152
01:05:33,675 --> 01:05:35,044
And she's having food trucks,

1153
01:05:35,077 --> 01:05:37,013
and she's the most popular girl
in school.

1154
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:39,648
Okay. Let me ask you
a question.

1155
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:42,317
What would you rather have?

1156
01:05:42,717 --> 01:05:45,888
Two hundred Instagram friends
or five real ones?

1157
01:05:47,455 --> 01:05:48,657
Five real.

1158
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:51,560
And are they coming here
tomorrow?

1159
01:05:51,593 --> 01:05:53,963
- Yep.
- Okay. Then focus on having

1160
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,097
a good time with them.

1161
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:59,835
- Doing what?
- I don't know.

1162
01:06:00,735 --> 01:06:04,040
What would make you happy?
Not your friends, you.

1163
01:06:08,643 --> 01:06:10,112
Wait. If you don't know
what you want,

1164
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:11,847
how can you ask for it?

1165
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:16,986
Taffy.

1166
01:06:17,652 --> 01:06:18,620
Hmm?

1167
01:06:19,821 --> 01:06:21,924
We used to make taffy
when I was a kid.

1168
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:24,961
All of us.
Mom loves taffy.

1169
01:06:24,994 --> 01:06:26,561
Well, there you go.

1170
01:06:26,595 --> 01:06:29,731
And now that you've got all
this firewood,

1171
01:06:29,764 --> 01:06:32,801
you could, uh, maybe have
a bonfire down by the water,

1172
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:35,604
roast some hot dogs,
make S'mores.

1173
01:06:35,637 --> 01:06:37,006
How do you know about S'mores?

1174
01:06:37,606 --> 01:06:39,876
You don't get this old
without living.

1175
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:41,776
[car approaching]

1176
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:51,120
Mom? What the heck?

1177
01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:54,123
Tucker.

1178
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,759
Wow. That's lot of firewood.

1179
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:01,496
I hear congratulations
are in order.

1180
01:07:02,131 --> 01:07:03,698
Imagine my surprise.

1181
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:06,501
Mom? Can we make taffy?

1182
01:07:06,534 --> 01:07:09,038
- Taffy?
- Tomorrow. For my party.

1183
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:11,107
There may only be six of us,
but who cares?

1184
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,541
And you're totally coming,
right? You have to.

1185
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:15,677
- Well, I don't...
- Mom? Tell him he has to.

1186
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:17,445
I don't know
what we're talking about.

1187
01:07:17,479 --> 01:07:18,680
You better be there.

1188
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:22,952
What did you do?

1189
01:07:25,254 --> 01:07:26,188
No clue.

1190
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:28,423
Yeah, right.

1191
01:07:29,557 --> 01:07:30,659
[Miranda chuckles]

1192
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:33,695
Well, I'm just going
to finish cleaning up

1193
01:07:33,728 --> 01:07:35,697
and, uh,
I will get out of your hair.

1194
01:07:54,849 --> 01:07:55,817
Bray?

1195
01:08:01,924 --> 01:08:04,492
I don't understand
what's happening here.

1196
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:08,463
What do you mean?

1197
01:08:09,065 --> 01:08:11,466
Well, I'm just... I don't know.
I'm... I'm...

1198
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:17,472
I'm having a hard time believing
that all of this is...

1199
01:08:18,773 --> 01:08:19,774
any better.

1200
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,613
I guess I just have been...

1201
01:08:27,883 --> 01:08:29,952
worried for so long
that maybe I don't know

1202
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:32,154
how to be happy anymore.

1203
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:34,723
- Hey.
- [Miranda] No. It's...

1204
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:36,491
[Bray] Hey, hey, hey.

1205
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:39,228
It's fine. I'm fine. It's...

1206
01:08:39,428 --> 01:08:41,030

1379
01:18:04,626 --> 01:18:07,162
- How creepy is that?
- I didn't steal Matt's idea!

1380
01:18:07,195 --> 01:18:08,363
You need to leave!

1381
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:11,500
Just give me a second.
We met in Vegas.

1382
01:18:11,533 --> 01:18:14,269
I had developed this
Grey Water Reclamation System,

1383
01:18:14,303 --> 01:18:16,471
and he had this sensor,
which was really smart.

1384
01:18:16,505 --> 01:18:18,874
And he showed it to me.
But sometimes it didn't work.

1385
01:18:18,908 --> 01:18:20,609
So he asked me for my advice.

1386
01:18:20,642 --> 01:18:23,111
We started kicking ideas around
and then suddenly,

1387
01:18:23,145 --> 01:18:25,814
out of the blue,
we came up with this energy grid

1388
01:18:25,847 --> 01:18:28,517
- for office buildings that was...
- And then he died!

1389
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:30,452
[sighs]

1390
01:18:31,219 --> 01:18:32,254
Yes.

1391
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:33,522
And where were you?

1392
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:37,793
Sitting right next to him.

1393
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:43,832
You...

1394
01:18:45,902 --> 01:18:47,135
You?

1395
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:52,307
The guy who survived.

1396
01:18:58,513 --> 01:19:01,450
Because of a miracle
that not only saved my life,

1397
01:19:01,483 --> 01:19:03,585
but changed everything about it.

1398
01:19:13,328 --> 01:19:14,830
So, you're the guy they found?

1399
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:18,266
You've got some nerve.

1400
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:22,404
Miranda, the patent
just cleared last month.

1401
01:19:22,437 --> 01:19:24,573
I brought you the papers
as soon as I had them.

1402
01:19:25,741 --> 01:19:28,644
Then the storm came
and you just...

1403
01:19:29,745 --> 01:19:31,313
You seemed so...

1404
01:19:32,748 --> 01:19:36,251
Frail and helpless?
Is that what you think of me?

1405
01:19:36,284 --> 01:19:37,619
No. Far from it.

1406
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:39,855
I don't need anyone to fix me.

1407
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:45,794
I thought that
if I could just show yo...

1408
01:19:45,995 --> 01:19:47,663
You just need to go!

1409
01:19:49,231 --> 01:19:51,299
You just need
to get the hell out!

1410
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:05,915
You heard the woman.
You gotta go.

1411
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:22,965
[indistinct chatter]

1412
01:20:32,674 --> 01:20:34,342
Are you checking out?

1413
01:20:34,743 --> 01:20:35,744
Yep.

1414
01:20:36,511 --> 01:20:38,948
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to charge you for the night.

1415
01:20:38,981 --> 01:20:41,516
Oh, I understand.
Keep it on the same card?

1416
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:42,584
Please.

1417
01:20:42,617 --> 01:20:44,720
Oh, and would you have
a messenger

1418
01:20:44,753 --> 01:20:46,588
deliver that tomorrow morning?

1419
01:20:46,621 --> 01:20:48,991
And you can go ahead
and charge that to my room too?

1420
01:20:49,025 --> 01:20:51,526
- Sure.
- Good luck with the LSAT.

1421
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,528
Thanks. I'll need it.

1422
01:20:59,035 --> 01:21:00,535
Let me ask you something.

1423
01:21:03,538 --> 01:21:05,807
Can you see yourself
being a lawyer?

1424
01:21:10,512 --> 01:21:12,748
Yeah. Definitely.

1425
01:21:13,782 --> 01:21:15,484
Then so can I.

1426
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:32,667
[Greg] <i>Mom!</i>

1427
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:35,303
<i>There's a girl here
with a package!</i>

1428
01:21:36,805 --> 01:21:39,008
He was so nice I figured
why make him pay for a messenger

1429
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:41,543
when I live, like,
five minutes from here.

1430
01:21:43,913 --> 01:21:46,348
- Thank you so much.
- Have a good day.

1431
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,721
That from Bray?

1432
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:54,756
Yeah.

1433
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:56,525
Well, finally.

1434
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,296
- What do you mean?
- He had that with him the day

1435
01:22:01,596 --> 01:22:03,799
I stayed home from school.
I thought he was from the bank.

1436
01:22:03,832 --> 01:22:05,968
Greg,
why didn't you say anything?

1437
01:22:06,002 --> 01:22:08,570
I'm not supposed to talk
to strangers, remember?

1438
01:22:08,837 --> 01:22:10,072
[sighs]

1439
01:22:12,674 --> 01:22:13,608
[sighs]

1440
01:22:47,076 --> 01:22:48,543
[exhales]

1441
01:22:48,978 --> 01:22:50,079
First of all,

1442
01:22:50,712 --> 01:22:54,150
you need to know that
one of your dad's inventions

1443
01:22:54,183 --> 01:22:57,053
sold for a great deal of money.

1444
01:22:57,086 --> 01:22:59,688
Apparently, it could be
the first check of many.

1445
01:22:59,989 --> 01:23:03,558
And I couldn't be
more proud of him.

1446
01:23:03,825 --> 01:23:05,827
Am I getting a pony?

1447
01:23:06,628 --> 01:23:07,629
No, baby.

1448
01:23:08,998 --> 01:23:12,400
But we do need to talk
about the future.

1449
01:23:15,637 --> 01:23:17,439
Okay, um...

1450
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,508
Let me back up a little bit,
um...

1451
01:23:20,809 --> 01:23:22,711
I was caught off guard
the other night

1452
01:23:22,744 --> 01:23:24,113
when Tucker proposed.

1453
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:27,649
Most people prefer that sort
of thing be done in private,

1454
01:23:27,682 --> 01:23:30,186
because it's a big deal
and very intimate.

1455
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:33,755
And I think he was afraid
I might say no,

1456
01:23:33,788 --> 01:23:38,094
and so he hedged his bet
a little by doing it in public.

1457
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,862
But the truth is,
I should've discussed it

1458
01:23:40,897 --> 01:23:43,798
with you guys first,
because it affects everybody.

1459
01:23:43,832 --> 01:23:45,433
It's not just about me.

1460
01:23:46,302 --> 01:23:48,603
You're the one
who has to sleep with him.

1461
01:23:48,905 --> 01:23:51,806
Well, that's not the point,
but thank you for that.

1462
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,841
No.

1463
01:23:53,309 --> 01:23:56,645
The point is,
what do you want, Mom?

1464
01:24:00,782 --> 01:24:02,051
I don't know.

1465
01:24:03,019 --> 01:24:04,753
Well, if you don't know,

1466
01:24:04,786 --> 01:24:06,554
how are you supposed
to ask for it?

1467
01:24:14,829 --> 01:24:17,432
I guess I should figure
that out, shouldn't I?

1468
01:24:19,567 --> 01:24:20,970
Can I go back to bed now?

1469
01:24:22,504 --> 01:24:23,505
Absolutely.

1470
01:24:24,206 --> 01:24:25,874
Unless you wanna go
to the Apple store

1471
01:24:25,908 --> 01:24:27,076
and look at a new computer.

1472
01:24:27,509 --> 01:24:29,045
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1473
01:24:30,246 --> 01:24:32,048
It's still
your birthday weekend.

1474
01:24:32,248 --> 01:24:33,748
- [Missy squeals]
- Oh.

1475
01:24:34,683 --> 01:24:35,985
[Missy] Thank you. Thank you.

1476
01:24:36,218 --> 01:24:37,819
[indistinct chatter]

1477
01:24:39,554 --> 01:24:41,623
It's a half hour wait.
We don't have to stay.

1478
01:24:41,991 --> 01:24:43,259
I just thought it'd be fun
for you

1479
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,927
to see where Mom
used to waitress.

1480
01:24:45,962 --> 01:24:47,229
We can go. Come on.

1481
01:24:48,164 --> 01:24:50,832
Maybe we should just
skip lunch and have ice cream?

1482
01:24:50,865 --> 01:24:52,667
- [Bessie] Yay, ice cream!
- Dude? We're leaving.

1483
01:24:53,735 --> 01:24:56,973
Bray told me a running back
once said that before the snap,

1484
01:24:57,006 --> 01:24:59,241
he can see the exact hole
he's gonna run through.

1485
01:24:59,275 --> 01:25:00,409
And then he trusts.

1486
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:03,578
He believes that his guys
are gonna make their blocks.

1487
01:25:04,246 --> 01:25:06,748
- And sure enough...
- Okay, cowboy. Come on.

1488
01:25:06,781 --> 01:25:07,917
[door opens]

1489
01:25:09,085 --> 01:25:10,920
Miranda? Party of four?

1490
01:25:11,253 --> 01:25:13,189
I thought
it was a half an hour wait.

1491
01:25:13,222 --> 01:25:16,225
Well, the dad forgot his wallet,
so they left.

1492
01:25:17,226 --> 01:25:18,593
Touchdown! All right.

1493
01:25:18,626 --> 01:25:20,129
Right this way, guys.

1494
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:25,034
[Greg] Mom, stop the car!
Stop the car! Stop the car!

1495
01:25:29,704 --> 01:25:31,107
[Miranda] What? What is it?

1496
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,241
It's our mailbox!

1497
01:25:32,274 --> 01:25:34,676
- [Missy] Holy crap!
- [Miranda] Missy!

1498
01:25:42,051 --> 01:25:43,152
Wow.

1499
01:25:53,896 --> 01:25:55,031
What's it say?

1500
01:25:56,765 --> 01:25:58,167
"Miranda,
I should've said something

1501
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,169
about all this the moment
I realized who you were,

1502
01:26:00,202 --> 01:26:01,803
and I feel really bad I didn't.

1503
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:04,240
I only knew Matt a few days.

1504
01:26:04,672 --> 01:26:07,575
He was a special man
who loved his family dearly."

[woman yawns]

1507
01:26:42,844 --> 01:26:46,115
Oh! I can't believe I have
to go back to work tomorrow.

1508
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:49,218
Oh, that's what Mondays are for.

1509
01:26:49,684 --> 01:26:51,253
How long was I out?

1510
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:54,056
Well, long enough for me
to finish the dishes.

1511
01:26:54,457 --> 01:26:56,225
You've got it down to a science.

1512
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:57,659
[Bray laughs]

1513
01:26:57,692 --> 01:26:59,694
[sobs]

1514
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:05,633
Bessie?

1515
01:27:06,835 --> 01:27:07,802
What happened?

1516
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:11,840
[Bessie] I was trying to glue
her tail back on and it slipped.

1517
01:27:11,873 --> 01:27:13,775
Now she's really dead.

1518
01:27:13,808 --> 01:27:16,078
And my fingers are stuck
together forever!

1519
01:27:16,112 --> 01:27:18,047
Oh, no, not forever, sweetie.

1520
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,015
We just need a little
nail polish remover, okay?

1521
01:27:20,049 --> 01:27:21,150
Come on.

1522
01:27:21,683 --> 01:27:23,352
[Bessie] But what about Beauty?

1523
01:27:23,718 --> 01:27:25,354
Well, we'll ask your brother.

1524
01:27:25,387 --> 01:27:28,390
But, you know, we might have
to get a new horse.

1525
01:27:30,025 --> 01:27:31,193
It's okay, sweetie.

1526
01:27:31,227 --> 01:27:32,895
[crickets chirping]

1527
01:27:40,269 --> 01:27:42,371
- Dead pony?
- [Miranda] Yep.

1528
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:48,177
[Missy] Remember when I stuck
a kernel of corn up my nose?

1529
01:27:49,844 --> 01:27:51,947
Yes. And you were terrified
an ear of corn

1530
01:27:51,981 --> 01:27:53,983
was gonna sprout
out of your face.

1531
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:55,750
What brought that up?

1532
01:27:56,218 --> 01:27:57,286
I don't know.

1533
01:27:57,319 --> 01:27:59,787
Thinking about Bessie
and how when you're younger

1534
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:01,924
everything seems
so life and death.

1535
01:28:05,461 --> 01:28:06,661
You okay?

1536
01:28:09,431 --> 01:28:11,766
- Did something happen?
- No.

1537
01:28:13,302 --> 01:28:15,070
I just never
would have thought...

1538
01:28:16,505 --> 01:28:18,073
I don't know what I'm saying.

1539
01:28:18,607 --> 01:28:21,676
Yes, you do.
Just finish that sentence.

1540
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,181
Bray.

1541
01:28:30,519 --> 01:28:31,887
What about him?

1542
01:28:32,888 --> 01:28:35,690
I never would've thought
of taffy if it weren't for him.

1543
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:39,727
He just made everything lighter.

1544
01:28:40,896 --> 01:28:42,864
I mean,
look at that skylight.

1545
01:28:42,898 --> 01:28:45,067
It's totally
<i>Goodnight Moon</i> in here.

1546
01:28:52,308 --> 01:28:53,876
You're quite a kid,
you know that?

1547
01:28:54,343 --> 01:28:55,710
[chuckles]

1548
01:28:56,912 --> 01:28:58,047
Have you called him?

1549
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,485
- No.
- Why not?

1550
01:29:03,851 --> 01:29:06,288
Mom, he's everything
he said he was.

1551
01:29:06,322 --> 01:29:09,757
He just couldn't get out
of his own way is all.

1552
01:29:10,192 --> 01:29:12,294
And the sibs and I
were talking.

1553
01:29:12,727 --> 01:29:14,862
You were so much more relaxed
with him.

1554
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:23,105
- Do your homework.
- What? You were.

1555
01:29:23,138 --> 01:29:24,240
Honey...

1556
01:29:25,441 --> 01:29:26,976
I barely know the man.

1557
01:29:27,643 --> 01:29:30,212
But you liked what you knew.

1558
01:29:41,056 --> 01:29:44,994
Now we turn to deriving
an equation of motion

1559
01:29:45,494 --> 01:29:47,129
from all of these ingredients.

1560
01:29:47,663 --> 01:29:50,366
<i>So let's consider
an extremum principle</i>

1561
01:29:50,633 --> 01:29:53,435
<i>for the motion
of a mechanical system.</i>

1562
01:29:56,038 --> 01:29:58,941
<i>What if we used the system
of an "N" particle,</i>

1563
01:29:59,408 --> 01:30:03,912
subject to active forces F-I
and constrained forces K-I?

1564
01:30:09,885 --> 01:30:12,321
So, what happens
when we add motion

1565
01:30:13,489 --> 01:30:15,391
to a structured system
like that?

1566
01:30:17,859 --> 01:30:20,029
[birds chirping]

1567
01:30:25,367 --> 01:30:26,902
Hey, sweetheart.

1568
01:30:33,509 --> 01:30:35,577
Thank you
for our beautiful kids.

1569
01:30:36,645 --> 01:30:40,082
I wish you could have seen
their faces when I told them.

1570
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:49,992
You are their hero.

1571
01:30:52,928 --> 01:30:54,163
And mine too.

1572
01:31:05,307 --> 01:31:08,277
[keyboard clacking]

1573
01:31:10,412 --> 01:31:13,282
- Hey.
- Hey!

1574
01:31:13,682 --> 01:31:15,451
I thought you had
a dentist appointment.

1575
01:31:17,686 --> 01:31:18,887
I did.

1576
01:31:20,923 --> 01:31:22,891
Oh, great!
No more pain?

1577
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:41,210
I'm sorry, Tuck.

1578
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:43,545
I can't do this.

1579
01:31:52,121 --> 01:31:53,122
Yeah.

1580
01:31:57,092 --> 01:31:58,093
Okay.

1581
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:03,132
Don't you wanna yell at me
or something?

1582
01:32:07,236 --> 01:32:08,570
Would it change your mind?

1583
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:15,911
No.

1584
01:32:20,082 --> 01:32:21,583
But I think you're wonderful.

1585
01:32:25,621 --> 01:32:26,688
Right back at you.

1586
01:32:35,998 --> 01:32:37,399
I should probably quit.

1587
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:40,135
Yeah.

1588
01:32:43,071 --> 01:32:44,173
Thank you.

1589
01:33:00,389 --> 01:33:03,058
<i>It was all right there
in the mailbox.</i>

1590
01:33:03,425 --> 01:33:05,227
Bray made Matt
co-owner of the patent,

1591
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:08,096
even though it took him
another two years to perfect it.

1592
01:33:08,297 --> 01:33:10,399
Well, I still think
he should've said something.

1593
01:33:10,432 --> 01:33:11,433
I know.

1594
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:14,102
He tried.

1595
01:33:15,504 --> 01:33:17,973
Which reminds me, um...

1596
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:23,278
I broke up with Tucker.

1597
01:33:23,312 --> 01:33:24,713
What? Why?

1598
01:33:27,449 --> 01:33:28,717
Because I don't love him.

1599
01:33:31,587 --> 01:33:33,121
And I'm gonna go back to school.

1600
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:35,290
What on earth for?

1601
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:37,192
To continue my life.

1602
01:33:38,427 --> 01:33:40,262
I was gonna be a nurse.

1603
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:43,532
- Remember?
- Mm-hmm.

1604
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:46,535
And I was wondering,
if it's not too much to ask,

1605
01:33:46,568 --> 01:33:48,670
if you could babysit the kids
this weekend?

1606
01:33:49,838 --> 01:33:51,139
This weekend?

1607
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,709
They don't know it yet, but...

1608
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:59,348
I'm going on a little road trip
to check out some grad programs.

1609
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:07,389
Look, I know
that you probably think

1610
01:34:07,422 --> 01:34:11,126
this whole second chance thing
is stupid.

1611
01:34:13,595 --> 01:34:15,197
You'd be wrong.

1612
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:28,243
[indistinct chatter]

1613
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:48,557
[doorbell rings]

1614
01:35:54,763 --> 01:35:55,764
Hi.

1615
01:35:56,498 --> 01:35:57,866
Hi, um...

1616
01:35:59,267 --> 01:36:00,535
I'm looking for Bray.

1617
01:36:00,569 --> 01:36:03,171
Oh, I'm afraid he's not here.

1618
01:36:03,205 --> 01:36:06,675
He had to take care
of some business out of town.

1619
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:09,344
Would you like
to leave a message?

1620
01:36:09,711 --> 01:36:11,313
Oh, um...

1621
01:36:12,547 --> 01:36:14,149
No. [chuckles]

1622
01:36:15,384 --> 01:36:17,719
I was just in town
and thought...

1623
01:36:19,922 --> 01:36:21,390
Um, actually,

1624
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:23,759
could you tell him Miranda Wells
stopped by?

1625
01:36:24,459 --> 01:36:26,395
You're Miranda?

1626
01:36:26,795 --> 01:36:28,630
- Yeah.
- [Jennifer] Oh, my gosh!

1627
01:36:28,664 --> 01:36:30,532
You're the reason he's not here!

1628
01:36:30,565 --> 01:36:34,336
I'm his sister, Jennifer.
I've heard so much about you!

1629
01:36:34,369 --> 01:36:36,672
- You have?
- Yes! And...

1630
01:36:36,872 --> 01:36:40,442
he's probably knocking
on your front door right now.

1631
01:36:40,475 --> 01:36:42,477
- Come on, Nana!
- All right, okay.

1632
01:36:42,711 --> 01:36:44,379
Oh, my gosh, you're doing it.

1633
01:36:44,413 --> 01:36:45,781
Oh, you see that?
You see that?

1634
01:36:45,814 --> 01:36:47,749
- [knocking on door]
- What am I hearing in my house?

1635
01:36:48,684 --> 01:36:50,452
Are we expecting anybody?

1636
01:36:54,556 --> 01:36:56,491
[Miranda]
<i>You should have seen my face</i>

1637
01:36:56,525 --> 01:36:58,794
when your sister
opened the door.

1638
01:36:58,827 --> 01:37:01,263
[laughs] It couldn't have been
any worse than mine

1639
01:37:01,296 --> 01:37:02,831
when Bobby answered yours.

1640
01:37:03,099 --> 01:37:05,500
[chuckles]
Yeah. Okay. You win.

1641
01:37:06,002 --> 01:37:09,404
But, in a way,
it all kind of worked out.

1642
01:37:09,438 --> 01:37:11,606
She and I got to clear
the air about, you know,

1643
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:13,608
pretty much everything, really.

1644
01:37:13,642 --> 01:37:16,311
And your sister and I
got to talk about nursing.

1645
01:37:16,344 --> 01:37:17,914
<i>Hey, I don't mean to be biased,</i>

1646
01:37:18,181 --> 01:37:21,683
but, uh, I hear Vanderbilt's
got a pretty good program.

1647
01:37:25,353 --> 01:37:26,889
Where are you right now?

1648
01:37:27,422 --> 01:37:32,461
Um, headed north on the 59. You?

1649
01:37:33,628 --> 01:37:35,630
[Miranda]
I'm heading south on the 65.

1650
01:37:37,033 --> 01:37:39,601
Just two ships passing
in the night, huh?

1651
01:37:39,634 --> 01:37:42,637
Well, unless they wanna stop
for a coffee somewhere.

1652
01:37:42,671 --> 01:37:45,574
And maybe grab a waffle?

1653
01:37:47,476 --> 01:37:48,610
You like waffles?

1654
01:37:48,643 --> 01:37:51,413
Oh, yeah.
I particularly like the ones

1655
01:37:51,446 --> 01:37:54,016
just off exit 47
near Tuscaloosa,

1656
01:37:54,816 --> 01:37:56,852
which we both should be
reaching,

1657
01:37:57,652 --> 01:37:59,354
what, about sun-up?

1658
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:04,793
Well...

1659
01:38:05,494 --> 01:38:07,897
what's a couple more hours
when it's taken me this long

1660
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:10,967
to realize I can have
anything I want?

1661
01:38:14,402 --> 01:38:15,704
Then don't hang up.

1662
01:38:20,575 --> 01:38:22,410
[Miranda]
Are you on the right street?

1663
01:38:23,678 --> 01:38:24,981
Oh, I see you.

1664
01:38:43,065 --> 01:38:44,399
[laughs]

1665
01:39:05,387 --> 01:39:07,522
- You look great.
- So do you.

1666
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,861
- Hi.
- Hi.

1667
01:39:28,743 --> 01:39:29,879
So, uh...

1668
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,348
[indistinct chatter]

1669
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:10,585
[birds chirping]

1670
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,166
[Greg]
Mom, where'd Bray go?

1671
01:40:24,766 --> 01:40:28,070
Oh, he got a call
from Eric Carlson up the road.

1672
01:40:28,104 --> 01:40:29,972
Said he was having trouble
with his barn.

1673
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:33,042
[Missy] Nana, I think we need
some more ornaments up here.

1674
01:40:33,376 --> 01:40:34,743
Oh, on that side?

1675
01:40:34,776 --> 01:40:36,078
[Bessie] Yes.
I can see this one.

1676
01:40:36,112 --> 01:40:37,479
[car horn honks]

1677
01:40:45,254 --> 01:40:47,822
Mommy! Look! It's a pony!

1678
01:40:48,224 --> 01:40:49,926
Thank you so much, Bray.

1679
01:40:50,226 --> 01:40:51,660
Imagine that?

1680
01:40:54,997 --> 01:40:57,499
- [Bray] Say hi?
- [Bessie] Hi!

1681
01:41:00,635 --> 01:41:02,504
That's so cute.

1682
01:41:02,537 --> 01:41:05,640
