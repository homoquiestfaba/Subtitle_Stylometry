1
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,664
Professor Tanaka

2
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,129
Nessie, spotted in
Scotland's Loch Ness.

3
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:53,010
The mammoth, until only
recently spotted in the frozen north.

4
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,596
The Himalayan Yeti.

5
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,932
The elusive Tsuchinoko.

6
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,853
Now, could they
be creatures which have...

7
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,190
...existed since before recorded history?

8
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:10,486
Cellular phones, the lnternet,
man-made satellites.

9
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:16,492
Scientific progress is
attempting to lead humanity to the stars.

10
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,286
But one moment, if you will.

11
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,538
Consider that on this Earth...

12
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:26,168
...there are still many enigmas
for which science hasn't accounted.

13
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,546
Perhaps before mankind
turns its eyes to outer space...

14
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:34,510
...it should first take a good look
at what's to be found at its feet.

15
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,233
The city was coldhearted to me.

16
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,863
My dream was never meant to be.

17
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:24,578
l realize now that
l have absolutely no talent.

18
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,623
And l feel terrible about that.

19
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:42,346
Kanako, you can come back
anytime if you get tired of city life.

20
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:49,228
Shirikodama and l will always
be waiting for you to return home.

21
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,399
Grandmother...

22
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,570
l hope l get to see you soon.

23
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,694
now entering Shirikodama

24
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,195
Shirikodama
Midorinuma - Kawakobashi

25
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,640
Kanako 'After School Date'
Kanako 'Tonight With You Tonight'

26
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,635
Nothing changes around here.

27
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,975
Shirikodama always
has a warm welcome for me.

28
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,583
Drive faster!

29
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,918
Yeah! This is too slow!

30
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,145
Ahhh, that feels good.

31
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,650
l love the smell of Shirikodama's seaside.

32
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,389
Grandmother!

33
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,722
Oh shit...

34
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,729
lt's just some old lady.

35
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,488
Awww, man.

36
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,115
Let's go!

37
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,834
Grandmother!

38
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,798
Grandmother...

39
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,817
Grandmother!

40
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,236
Don't die, Grandmother!

41
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,240
Welcome home, Kanako.

42
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,746
We have to...

43
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:28,043
We have to protect Kappa...

44
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,420
Kappa?

45
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:38,053
A kappa is a kind of goblin passed
down in Japanese folklore since ancient times.

46
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,391
They inhabit rivers and ponds,
and their entire bodies are green.

47
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,103
Their distinctive features
include a plate on top of their heads...

48
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:52,317
...a turtle-like shell on their
backs, and fins on their limbs.

49
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,070
They specialize in
swimming and sumo wrestling.

50
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,947
Their weakness is
the aforementioned head plate.

51
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,450
Their favorite food is cucumbers...

52
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:04,371
...so much so that in Japan, sushi with
cucumber in it is called "kappa roll."

53
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,421
ln Japan, there's a
sense that kappa = cucumbers.

54
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,717
According to Japanese
folklore and tradition...

55
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,054
...kappa love mischief,
but they aren't malicious...

56
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,391
...and are said to
be amicable creatures.

57
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:37,237
We have to protect Kappa...

58
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,871
Grandmother!

59
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,709
Grandmother...

60
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,713
Grandmother!

61
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,264
Fujiko & Kanako Kadou

62
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:13,041
My grandmother raised me
all by herself after my parents died.

63
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,669
l thought now l'd
get to take care of her...

64
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,546
kappa

65
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,219
kappa drawings

66
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:31,309
Our family's always
had a deep reverence for the kappa.

67
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,866
l'll honor your dying wish, Grandmother.

68
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,327
l'll protect the kappa!

69
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,067
l love the beach...

70
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:17,999
lt's tough to find a
good time these days...

71
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,671
You said it...

72
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:35,892
You can hear your soul
if you listen to the waves.

73
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:49,197
Hey, there's somebody
walking on the water.

74
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,330
Yeah...
Maybe it's a ghost?

75
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,296
Oh, a cow's crossing the ocean.

76
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,301
Whoa, am l thirsty.

77
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,925
This game's getting old.

78
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,601
What's ketchup doing on a cucumber?

79
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,354
Because l like cucumbers.

80
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,870
What are you, a kappa?

81
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,041
Kappa kappa! Kappa kappa!

82
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,711
Kappa! Kappa kappa!

83
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,478
Help me!

84
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,250
Kappa really exists!

85
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,714
He's eating my cucumbers!

86
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,967
That's so cute.

87
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,934
Kappa!

88
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,904
Kappa kappa!

89
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:42,328
Kappa!

90
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,163
Kappa...

91
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,374
Kappa?

92
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,467
Mommy!

93
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,020
Get away from me!

94
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,606
Help me!

95
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:19,115
Momma!

96
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,034
Kappa! Kappa!

97
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,294
Call the cop-pas...

98
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,589
You're safe now.

99
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,762
No!

100
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,475
A monster...

101
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,395
My boyfriend...

102
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,772
Help us!

103
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,275
l'll help you.

104
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,729
What do you think you're doing,
just barging into somebody's house?

105
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,400
ls this you, Kanako?

106
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,447
Quit looking at that!

107
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,033
What're you doing? Give that to me!

108
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,868
Ow!
What're you doing? Give that to me!

109
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,496
Oh come on, let me see it.

110
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,163
No!

111
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,373
What's this?

112
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,123
Never you mind.

113
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,375
l wanna see.

114
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,503
Be quiet.

115
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,672
"Tonight With You Tonight."

116
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,507
You're stingy.

117
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,300
And you don't give up!

118
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,885
Stingy.

119
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,011
Go away.

120
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,930
What's that on your head?

121
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:06,847
A headband!
What's that on your head?

122
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,767
Huh, so that's Akihabara style.

123
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,602
lt's cute, don't you think?

124
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:16,565
I had a dream last night, a melody.

125
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,150
Someday we'll be together, you and me.

126
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,028
Someday we'll be together, you and me.
That's enough. You're embarrassing me.

127
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,279
That's enough. You're embarrassing me.

128
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,405
I'm wearing panties again today.
That's enough. You're embarrassing me.

129
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,491
I'm wearing panties again today.

130
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,203
The stars above
are all lucky, happy.

131
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,624
I'm going to end up putting our secret inside a treasure chest.

132
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,792
I'm going to end up putting our secret inside a treasure chest.
No way.

133
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,754
I'm going to end up putting our secret inside a treasure chest.

134
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:46,053
I promise l'll bleed with a
smile on my face near the seashore.

135
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,847
And so...

136
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,606
Let it hear that song again!

137
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,612
...tonight with you tonight.

138
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,950
I'm sure tomorrow will be tomorrow.

139
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:12,455
The blue sky's such a blue sky.

140
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:18,544
Let's have some tea.
Coffee time's lucky, happy.

141
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,341
The kappa likes your song!

142
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,928
Over the rainbow it's fancy.

143
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:32,475
We're always together, you and me.

144
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,854
It's so tender inside, softy.

145
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,691
The moon above
is just so lucky, happy.

146
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:48,032
You're so wonderful, l give you
presents yesterday and tomorrow.

147
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:56,707
The kappa fell down!

148
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:03,547
Tonight with you tonight.

149
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:10,638
I'll change my hairstyle, a permanent.

150
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:17,645
The blue sky's such a blue sky.

151
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:24,944
Everlasting, endless love is...

152
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:38,958
Nobody would listen to my singing in Tokyo,
but look how much Kappa likes it.

153
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:45,714
l'm glad l came back to Shirikodama.

154
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:52,805
l feel a lot better thanks to Kappa.

155
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,852
Thank you, Kappa.

156
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,743
I had a dream last night, a melody.

157
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:00,414
Someday we'll be
together, you and me.

158
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,793
I'm wearing panties again today.

159
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,797
The stars above
are all lucky, happy.

160
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,355
The plate broke...

161
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,109
Someday we'll be
together, you and me.

162
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,531
I'm wearing panties again today.

163
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,993
The stars above
are all lucky, happy.

164
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:46,919
I'm going to end up putting
our secret inside a treasure chest.

165
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:53,926
I promise l'll bleed with a
smile on my face near the seashore.

166
00:25:54,886 --> 00:26:00,224
And so, tonight with you tonight.

167
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:04,645
I'm sure tomorrow will be tomorrow.

168
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,941
The blue sky's such a blue sky.

169
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:13,612
Let's have some tea. Coffee time's...

170
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,994
Stop that!

171
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,958
What are you doing to Kappa?

172
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,324
Kappa! Run!

173
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,439
Sweet dreams.

174
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:40,074
We have to protect Kappa...

175
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:51,126
l protected Kappa
just like you said, Grandmother.

176
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,134
Revive the spirit of Japan

177
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:40,759
Revive the spirit of Japan
What is this place?

178
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,677
What is this place?

179
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,201
Amphibious weaponized fishmen.

180
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:10,748
Umihiko #14, #15, and #16.

181
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,710
Well?

182
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,880
Fantastic, aren't they?

183
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,967
They're disgusting.

184
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:33,395
l won't allow you to insult the Umihikos!

185
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,941
Because you know what?

186
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:49,828
They're the embodiment of
my grandfather's life of research...

187
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,500
...blood, sweat, and tears!

188
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,049
Grandfather was a scientist
for the Japanese Army in World War ll...

189
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:07,137
...and he had the idea to make
enchanced humans using the...

190
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,057
...skin cells of a mummified kappa.

191
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,601
You mean my Kappa's?

192
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,478
Correct.

193
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,148
Although the kappa mummy
synchronizing with the Umihikos and...

194
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,692
...coming back to life was unexpected.

195
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,823
During the war, the Japanese
army was hurting due to numerical inferiority.

196
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:33,080
As a last resort, we were going to
rebuild all our surviving soldiers into...

197
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:38,085
...Umihikos and launch a full-scale
marine invasion of the American homeland.

198
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:44,216
Grandfather continued
his research in secret...

199
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,760
...as the focal point of that project.

200
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:52,891
But some army bigwigs made
a big stink about it being "inhumane"...

201
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,644
...and the research was cancelled.

202
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,939
Yet Grandfather never gave up on it.

203
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,527
He moved his laboratory
here without anyone knowing...

204
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:08,782
...and continued his Umihiko
research even after the war ended.

205
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,536
And then, just before it
would have been complete--

206
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,545
Grandfather passed away.

207
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,716
Grandfather...

208
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,846
l'm sure you were very disappointed.

209
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:40,314
But once he died, l
inherited his splendid research!

210
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:47,321
l, Yuriko, his granddaughter, saw his
work through to its wonderful completion!

211
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:58,415
He might be dead, but
his soul lives on in the Umihikos!

212
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,629
You're insane!

213
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:18,644
Insane! Insane! lnsane!

214
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,190
lnsane!

215
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,900
lndeed!

216
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:45,003
Proper sensibility can never
bring change to this country.

217
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,964
Who are you?

218
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,508
We're members of the State Guard.

219
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,511
And what is that?

220
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:59,559
We lost the war, and the people
of this country were completely defanged!

221
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:06,233
Bushido perished, and the
streets overflow with frivolous youths!

222
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,070
lt's decadence! Unbridled decedance!

223
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,450
Do you know the
true meaning of peace?

224
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,456
True peace can only
be achieved though the...

225
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,460
...pursuit of our country's
ideals and victory in the holy war!

226
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,211
Revive the spirit of Japan

227
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:30,090
Now is the time to
restore true Showa ambition!

228
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:40,058
The time has come for the
defanged Yamato race to grow some...

229
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,310
...new fangs.

230
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:46,231
Behold the new fangs of Asia!

231
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,457
All of you are crazy.

232
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,914
What the hell is this?

233
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:50,087
The New Japanese lmperial
Navy's Umihiko Female Division...

234
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,881
...#1 and...

235
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,716
...#2.

236
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,844
What'd you do to them?

237
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:03,517
You'll find out soon enough, #3.

238
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,103
#3?

239
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,442
What're you doing?

240
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,236
Stop it!

241
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,490
Cut it out!

242
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,827
lt's showtime! Yeah!

243
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:39,719
You'll soon be just like
your beloved kappa, #3!

244
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:45,058
These monsters are nothing like Kappa!

245
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,645
l'd rather be dead!

246
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:49,938
Yeah!

247
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:03,243
Goodbye, Kappa...

248
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:11,710
What the?

249
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,544
Whoa!

250
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,507
Kappa!

251
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,975
Capture it alive!

252
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,669
What the? Gross!

253
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,257
You...

254
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,870
Go get 'em!

255
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,719
You goddamn bitch!

256
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:23,211
Grandfather!

257
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,179
Who did such a thing?

258
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:39,269
l can't take anymore of this!

259
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,608
l'll blow all of you away!

260
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,494
S-Stop!

261
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,497
That's the switch for the...

262
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,168
...atomic bomb that'll
wipe this lab's secret...

263
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:07,464
...and the village off
the face of the Earth!

264
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,424
Say what?

265
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,055
Just how crazy are you?

266
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,477
Don't do it!

267
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:28,693
l really hate it when
people tell me what to do.

268
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,696
l'm pushing it.

269
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,781
Stop!

270
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,783
Yeah!

271
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,247
No!

272
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:30,755
lt seems mankind has finally opened
the Pandora's Box it must never open.

273
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,328
Run!

274
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,645
Oh my god! lt's coming this way!

275
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,106
Run! Hurry!

276
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,337
Okay, here we go.

277
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,511
One more.

278
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,806
Look at the camera.

279
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,895
Run!

280
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,372
at the scene of the monster attack

281
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,958
A monster has appeared
in the city, ladies and gentlemen!

282
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,502
lt's rampaging through the
streets like it owns the place.

283
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:00,840
How in the world are the Self-Defense
Forces going to cope with this monster?

284
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,176
We're awaiting their swift response.

285
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,351
at the scene of the monster attack

286
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,188
at the scene of the monster attack
Furthermore, it was decided at a cabinet meeting that...

287
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:15,313
at the scene of the monster attack

288
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:15,646
at the scene of the monster attack
...the monster would be named Hangyolas.

289
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:15,813
...the monster would be named Hangyolas.

290
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,482
at the scene of the Hangyolas attack
...the monster would be named Hangyolas.

291
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,492
Hangyolas Counter-Measure HQT

292
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,287
The Chief and commanding
officers are present and accounted for.

293
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,503
l have a message
from the Prime Minister.

294
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:42,548
He wishes us all the
utmost success in this battle.

295
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,844
Thank you, sir.

296
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,970
Of course.

297
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,165
Your target is Hangyolas!

298
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:30,680
Fire!

299
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,483
Come on, fire!

300
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,861
Fire! Fire!

301
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,992
Shoot it!

302
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,410
Fire!

303
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,330
Fire! What're you doing?

304
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,336
Fire!

305
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,843
lt's huge!

306
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,513
Mommy!

307
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,982
As was stated in the previous report...

308
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,027
...Hangyolas' tough
skin repelled our attack.

309
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,613
Data is currently
being gathered regarding...

310
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,740
...other unique
characteristics it possesses.

311
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,326
This is no time for
such tedious procedures!

312
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,621
We're already losing men out there.

313
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:41,417
We should be moving on to a
more effective and meticulous plan.

314
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,670
So you want us to turn
Japan into a war zone again.

315
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,714
We're already at war.

316
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,841
Chief.

317
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,595
Hangyolas has already
paralyzed one city.

318
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,682
lt might mean the death of this
country if we allow the damage to spread!

319
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,062
Ladies and gentlemen,
l hope you can hear me.

320
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,564
Martial law has been
declared in the city...

321
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:49,860
...and the SDF is about to carry out
a full-scale assault against Hangyolas.

322
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,321
Thanks to the appearance of
Hangyolas, this city that...

323
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:56,742
...has long been a place of peace
and order is now turning into a war zone.

324
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,553
Our tanks and fighters
are ready to attack.

325
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:00,639
Twelve naval vessels are
currently deployed as well.

326
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,266
Should Hangyolas attempt to...

327
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,310
...escape via the ocean,
they'll destroy it in one fell swoop.

328
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,563
Where is the Gorgon
Monster Death Ray Unit currently?

329
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,900
At 2200 yesterday they
departed the garrison in Aomori...

330
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,651
...and are currently headed south.

331
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,236
They should arrive soon.

332
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,446
Not soon enough.

333
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,908
Chief, l think we can
inflict considerable damage...

334
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,078
...on Hangyolas with
our current firepower.

335
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,206
lf you would give the order.

336
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,473
Target locked!

337
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,109
Attack!

338
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,528
Prepare to attack.

339
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,699
All forces, prepare to attack.

340
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,786
Your target is Hangyolas!

341
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,663
All units, prepare to attack!

342
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:22,429
Fire!

343
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:55,921
Firing!

344
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,552
Direct hit!

345
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:37,546
Fire!

346
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,015
Good!

347
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,443
Firing!

348
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,528
Mommy!

349
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,550
Fall back! Fall back!

350
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,994
Mother!

351
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,501
Go! You go get it!

352
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,420
l can't, sir! l'm scared!

353
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,964
Don't run! You've gotta fight!

354
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,382
l'm too scared!

355
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,468
Granny!

356
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,136
Here it comes!

357
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,596
Mom!

358
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:06,111
The fighter squadron is wiped out.
Not a single jet can continue to attack.

359
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,906
The tank division is wiped out.
Survivors are currently being confirmed.

360
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,095
breaking news from the scene
of the Hangyolas attack

361
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,971
Good news, everyone.

362
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:37,393
The Gorgon Monster
Death Ray Unit has just arrived.

363
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:07,131
The Gorgon Monster Death Ray,
the most powerful laser weapon in history...

364
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:11,427
...is the result of top level
military scientific development.

365
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,847
lt's truly no exaggeration to
say this is the day for which...

366
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,598
...this weapon was developed.

367
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,977
Let's hope that this,
the SDF's final trump card...

368
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:27,359
...will be what finally
destroys Hangyolas for good.

369
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,196
We're counting on you, Gorgon!

370
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:57,014
The Gorgon Monster Death
Ray Unit is now in attack position.

371
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,074
Attack!

372
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:16,992
Roger!

373
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,750
Target Hangyolas!

374
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,055
Fire!

375
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,405
Continue the attack!

376
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,321
Good, just a little more!

377
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,637
Don't retreat!

378
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,515
Attack! Attack!

379
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,002
The Death Ray Unit's
been neutralized!

380
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,879
l repeat! The Death Ray
Unit's been neutralized!

381
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:37,007
The Death Ray Unit's
been neutralized. 98% losses.

382
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,634
They're withdrawing.

383
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:44,514
So this means now
nobody can stop Hangyolas.

384
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:56,026
The city is in ruins, thanks to
the continuing ravages of Hangyolas.

385
01:00:56,152 --> 01:01:00,322
Electricity, water, gas.
All our lifelines have been cut off.

386
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:04,076
Now lacking the
spirit to enjoy music or art...

387
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,580
...people are no longer even able
to appreciate pretty flowers or nature.

388
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:12,626
They live in fear of Hangyolas,
never knowing when it may attack.

389
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:18,382
Many of the refugees have
developed posttraumatic stress disorder...

390
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,593
...indicating that some
of Hangyolas' ravages have...

391
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,137
...taken place deep within our hearts.

392
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,682
We're done for.

393
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,017
Daddy, l'm scared.

394
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:37,150
The SDF's forces have
suffered ruinous damage.

395
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:41,446
The Hangyolas situation
is looking worse and worse.

396
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:45,158
Now, how are things
going on the front line?

397
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,702
Mr. Omobe.

398
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,495
Mr. Omobe?

399
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,623
Yes, Omobe here.

400
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:55,460
The moster Hangyolas is
rampaging even harder than it was before.

401
01:01:55,503 --> 01:02:01,758
The SDF's attacks seem to
have only provoked it further.

402
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,012
Did you hear that roar just now?
That was Hangyolas itself!

403
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:11,017
l would have to say we're
in considerable danger, right here.

404
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,520
But l hope we can keep
reporting as long as possible.

405
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,564
The peace we enjoyed
until yesterday is...

406
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:18,942
...about to completely collapse
thanks to this one monster!

407
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:23,280
The world humanity
has known until now has...

408
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:30,871
lt looks like time has
run out for our reporting team!

409
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:36,084
Sadly, this might just be the end.

410
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,298
Goodbye, everyone...

411
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,884
Goodbye!

412
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,927
That's hot! Hot!

413
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:47,137
l can't move!

414
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,805
Mr. Omobe being attacked.
l can't move!

415
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,246
lt-it's a kappa!

416
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,164
lt's a kappa!

417
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,125
That's no kappa.

418
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:18,627
lt's a monster!

419
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:25,884
A kappa is a type of goblin,
a term which suggests a creature of legend.

420
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:31,306
On the other hand, a monster
in this case is a gigantic, powerful creature.

421
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:37,229
So, creature of legend,
and gigantic, powerful creature.

422
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,899
l hope you see the difference?

423
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,678
The kappa monster won.

424
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,680
So it would seem.

425
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:53,062
What the?

426
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,940
lt's far more ferocious
than Hangyolas was.

427
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:00,737
That's correct.

428
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,948
This is what mankind gets for...

429
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:09,704
...not believing in the
existence of unconfirmed lifeforms.

430
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:17,420
He is the kappa that
will be the end of humanity.

431
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,964
He is Death Kappa.

432
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:20,775
lsn't there anything we can do?

433
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:23,069
Our total strength was
no match for Hangyolas...

434
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:25,488
...and this is the monster that beat it!

435
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,324
What do we do?

436
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:59,731
Over the rainbow it's fancy.

437
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:06,738
We're always together, you and me.

438
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:09,073
It's so tender inside, softy.

439
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:11,534
Something's wrong with Death Kappa.

440
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,996
Switch to a camera
that can show us that area.

441
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,081
There's still a civilian up there.

442
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,791
Rescue her at once!

443
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:19,417
Yes, sir!

444
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,168
No, wait.

445
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,044
What for, sir?
No, wait.

446
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,337
Let's watch this for a bit.

447
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,713
But, sir...

448
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:34,932
You're so wonderful, l give you
presents yesterday and tomorrow.

449
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:46,152
So please have some
of this sweet, lovely candy.

450
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:56,204
This evening, tonight with you tonight.

451
01:12:56,663 --> 01:13:03,252
I'll change my hairstyle, a permanent.

452
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:10,385
The blue sky's such a blue sky.

453
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:20,770
Everlasting, endless love
is lucky, happy.

454
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,449
Kappa, your plate is dry.

455
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:52,635
Here you go.

456
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:09,819
You finally remembered, didn't you?

457
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,991
What happened?

458
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:19,871
This means we didn't need any
powerful weapons against Death Kappa.

459
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,041
lt's all right.

460
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:32,967
Nobody will hurt you anymore.

461
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:47,732
Death Kappa's reminded us of
what we forgot so long ago.

462
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:41,035
Goodbye, Death Kappa!

463
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:47,166
Goodbye, Kappa.
