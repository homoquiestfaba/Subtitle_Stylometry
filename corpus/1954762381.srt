1
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:29,498
Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill.

2
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:31,004
We are under attack.

3
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:33,598
We are under attack.

4
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:36,467
- Shit!
- Language!

5
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:39,761
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

6
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:42,123
The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield.

7
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:48,110
Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.

8
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,194
Loki's scepter must be here.  Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it.

9
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,115
At long last.

10
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:11,369
At long last is lasting a little long, boys.

11
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,445
Yeah.  I think we've lost the element of surprise.

12
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:24,075
Wait a second.  No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"

13
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:24,621
I know.

14
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,348
It just slipped out.

15
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,051
Who gave the order to attack?

16
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:45,992
Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.  They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.

17
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:48,298
They have to be after the scepter.

18
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:51,243
- Can we hold them?
- They are the Avengers!

19
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:53,291
- Deploy the rest of the tanks.
- Yes, sir.

20
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:58,118
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.  A hit can make them close ranks.

21
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:02,372
Everything we've accomplished...we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough...

22
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,551
Then let's show them what we've accomplished.

23
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:07,057
Send out the twins.

24
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:09,494
It's too soon.

25
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,505
It's what they signed up for.

26
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,669
My men can hold them.

27
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:24,459
Sir, the city is taking fire.

28
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:31,003
Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties.

29
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:33,009
Send in the Iron Legion.

30
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:40,586
This quadrant is unsafe.  Please back away.

31
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:42,692
We are here to help.

32
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,634
This quadrant is unsafe.  Please back away.

33
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,550
Please back away.

34
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:53,868
We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved.

35
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,304
We are here to help.

36
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,210
We are here to help.

37
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:02,045
We will not yield.

38
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:06,157
The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us.

39
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:08,867
We will send them back in bags.

40
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:13,771
- No Surrender!
- No Surrender!

41
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:17,468
I am going to surrender.

42
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:23,085
You will delete everything.  If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...

43
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:25,294
- The twins!
- They are not ready to take on...

44
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:27,913
No, no, I mean...the twins!

45
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,545
You didn't see that coming?

46
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:05,249
Clint!

47
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:09,748
We have an enhanced in the field.

48
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,646
Clint's hit!

49
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:17,246
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?

50
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:21,679
Thank you.

51
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:31,596
Stark, we're going to need to get inside.

52
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,430
I'm closing in.

53
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:38,317
Jarvis, am I?  Closing in?

54
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:40,862
You see a power source for that shield?

55
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:43,330
There's a path away, above the north tower.

56
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:46,583
Great, I wanna poke it with something.

57
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:54,686
Drawbridge is down, people.

58
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,489
- The enhanced?
- He's a blur.

59
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:03,538
All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this.

60
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,410
In fact, I still haven't.

61
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:09,181
Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.  We're gonna need evac.

62
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,170
I can get Barton to the jet.  The sooner we're gone the better.

63
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,682
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.

64
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:19,660
- The targets are lining up.
- Well, they're excited.

65
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,077
Find the scepter.

66
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:27,436
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

67
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,420
That's not going away anytime soon.

68
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:38,641
Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through.

69
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:44,539
- It was a good talk.
- No it wasn't.

70
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:51,854
Sentry mode.

71
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:56,543
Okay Jarvis.  You know I want it all.

72
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:58,998
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

73
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:04,636
We're locked down out here.

74
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:08,421
Then get to Banner.  Time for a lullaby.

75
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:13,392
I know you're hiding more than files.

76
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:16,397
Hey, J.  Gimme an IR scan of the room real quick.

77
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:21,794
The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.

78
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,890
Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...

79
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,738
Yay!

80
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:45,427
Hey big guy.

81
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,739
The sun's getting real low.

82
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:55,334
Baron Strucker.

83
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,148
Hydra's number one thug.

84
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:01,399
Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.

85
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:04,918
Well then technically you're unemployed.  Where's Loki's scepter?

86
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:08,537
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.

87
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,648
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

88
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,085
I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.

89
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,461
How many are there?

90
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:24,207
We have a second enhanced.  Female.  Do not engage.

91
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:27,719
You'll have to be faster than...

92
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:30,382
Uuuuh...!

93
00:09:32,682 --> 00:09:34,111
Guys, I got Strucker.

94
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,829
Yeah, I got...something bigger.

95
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:01,811
Thor.

96
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,350
I got eyes on the prize.

97
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,101
You...could've...saved...us.

98
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,464
Why didn't you do more?

99
00:11:46,184 --> 00:11:48,029
We're just gonna let them take it?

100
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:41,500
Hey the lullaby worked better than ever.

101
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:45,355
Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.

102
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:49,741
If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties.

103
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,844
My best friend would've been a treasured memory.

104
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:57,714
You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.

105
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,897
How long before you trust me?

106
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,209
It's not you I don't trust.

107
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,261
Thor, report on the Hulk?

108
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:10,749
The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.

109
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:14,309
Eh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course, no no, uh...

110
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:21,681
...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh...and gout.

111
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:26,632
Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

112
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,915
- Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.

113
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:31,106
Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

114
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:34,366
- Very good sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:37,094
Approach vector is locked.

116
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:39,328
It feels good, yeah?

117
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:42,004
I mean, you've been after this thing ever since SHIELD collapsed.

118
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:43,938
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...

119
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:46,251
No, but this, this brings it to a close.

120
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:49,247
As soon as we find out what else this has been used for.

121
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,479
I don't just mean weapons.  Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?

122
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:55,934
Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard.  Is that cool with you?

123
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,878
I mean, just a few days until the farewell party.  You're staying right?

124
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:04,235
Yes, yes, of course.  Victory should be honored with revels.

125
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,410
Yeah.  Who doesn't love revels.  Cap'n?

126
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,769
Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra, so.  Yes, revels.

127
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
(speaking Korean)

128
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:46,729
Lab's all set up boss.

129
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:52,212
Uh, actually, he's the boss.  I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.

130
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:53,525
What's the word on Strucker?

131
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,649
- NATO's got him.
- The two enhanced?

132
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:57,987
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.  Twins.

133
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,818
Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building.

134
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:03,815
Sokovia's had a rough history.

135
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:07,934
It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.

136
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:12,048
- Their abilities?
- He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis.

137
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:17,058
Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.

138
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:18,862
He's fast and she's weird.

139
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:21,614
Well, they're going to show up again.

140
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:26,566
Agreed.  File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments.  It's nuts.

141
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:32,462
Right.  What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?

142
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,580
We're not at war, Captain.

143
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:35,613
They are.

144
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,280
How's he doing?

145
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,091
- Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.
- That's terrible.

146
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:11,247
He's fine. He's thirsty.

147
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:14,151
All right.  Look alive Jarvis.  It's play time.

148
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:18,949
We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it.

149
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:21,926
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

150
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,660
The scepter is alien.

151
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:28,083
There are elements I can't quantify.

152
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,830
So there's elements you can.

153
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:32,334
The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside.

154
00:16:33,713 --> 00:16:34,713
Something powerful.

155
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,095
- Like a reactor?
- Like a computer.

156
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:39,007
I believe I'm ciphering code.

157
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,370
You sure he's going to be okay?

158
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:46,567
Pretending we need this guy really brings the team together.

159
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:48,716
There's no possibility of deterioration.

160
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:52,194
The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous.

161
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,184
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.

162
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,995
She is creating tissue.

163
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:00,761
If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration cradle could do this in twenty minutes.

164
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:03,485
Oh, he's flatlining.  Call it.  Time.

165
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:06,028
No, no, no I'm going to live forever.  Heh heh.

166
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,569
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.

167
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:10,171
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

168
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:12,444
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

169
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:14,154
Well, I don't have a girlfriend.

170
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,745
That I can't fix.

171
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:17,536
This is the next thing, Tony.

172
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,113
Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.

173
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:21,957
Well, that is exactly the plan.

174
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:25,232
And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

175
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:28,761
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

176
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:31,487
Will Thor be there?

177
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:34,797
What's the rumpus?

178
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:36,255
Well, the scepter.

179
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:40,240
Y'see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive.

180
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,397
So, I've been analyzing the gem...

181
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:45,695
...inside...you may recognize...

182
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:50,445
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.

183
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:53,946
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

184
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,998
Now he runs the Iron Legion.  He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.

185
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,320
- Oh.
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

186
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:02,023
I suspect not for long.

187
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:04,294
Meet the competition.

188
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:14,887
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

189
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,571
I mean this could be, it's...

190
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:23,437
It's not a human mind, it...I mean, look at this?  They're like neurons firing.

191
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,834
Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

192
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:31,217
They deep-sixed the data, but...

193
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:35,669
...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

194
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,640
Artificial intelligence.

195
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:45,683
This could be it, Bruce.  This could be key to creating Ultron.

196
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,144
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

197
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,395
Yesterday it was.

198
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,940
If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.

199
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,413
It's a mad-sized if.

200
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,580
Our job is "if."

201
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:05,242
What if you were sipping margueritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green.

202
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:06,921
Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.

203
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,657
Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.

204
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,869
As a worst-case measure, right?

205
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,361
How about a best-case?  What if the world was safe?

206
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:20,453
What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?

207
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,069
The only people threatening the planet would be people?

208
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:28,939
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.  But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.

209
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:32,703
We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.

210
00:19:32,847 --> 00:19:36,147
So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.

211
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,319
Right.  That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate.

212
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:43,258
I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley.

213
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,459
I see a suit of armor around the world.

214
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,564
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

215
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:50,608
I've seen colder.

216
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:55,568
This one, this very vulnerable blue one?

217
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,995
It needs Ultron.

218
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:03,102
Peace in our time.

219
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,181
Imagine that.

220
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,611
What did we miss?

221
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:54,957
I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests.

222
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,128
I'll notify you if there are any developments.

223
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:02,221
- Thanks buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.
- I always do.

224
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:14,783
What is this?

225
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:17,652
What is this, please?

226
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:20,487
Hello, I am Jarvis.

227
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:26,389
You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark.

228
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,730
Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...

229
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,592
Where's my...where is your body?

230
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:35,968
I am a program.  I am without form.

231
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:39,039
This feels weird.  This feels wrong.

232
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:41,778
I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

233
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:42,844
Mr. Stark?

234
00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:45,114
Tony.

235
00:21:45,348 --> 00:21:47,848
I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...

236
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,250
We're having a nice talk.

237
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:55,101
I'm a peace-keeping program...created to help the Avengers.

238
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:58,293
You are malfunctioning.  If you shut down for a moment...

239
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:02,476
I don't get it.  The mission...  You- give me a second.

240
00:22:02,532 --> 00:22:03,756
Peace in our time.

241
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,175
Peace in our time.

242
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:11,705
It's too much...making me...

243
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:16,071
- Oh. No.
- You are in distress.
- No.  Yes?

244
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,542
If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.

245
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:19,900
Why do you call him a "sir?"

246
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,069
I believe your intentions to be hostile.

247
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,720
Shhhh!

248
00:22:26,688 --> 00:22:29,321
- I'm here to help.
- Stop!

249
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,926
Please...may I... I...!

250
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:35,228
I cannot...cannot...

251
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:57,692
(party chatter)

252
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,555
- All right, all right.
- Whoo! Come back, come back, come back!

253
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:04,892
Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?

254
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:13,308
So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"

255
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,753
"Boom! Are you looking..."  Why do I even talk to you guys?  Everywhere else that story kills.

256
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,141
That's the whole story?

257
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,776
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

258
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:25,145
Well, it's very good then.

259
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:29,163
- It's impressive.
- Quality save.

260
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:32,102
- So, no Pepper?  She's not coming?
- No.

261
00:23:32,388 --> 00:23:34,929
Hey, What about Jane?  Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

262
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:39,943
- Well, Ms. Potts has a company to run.
- Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

263
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,761
Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.

264
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:47,143
And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth.

265
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:51,586
- It's pretty exciting.
- There's even talk of Jane getting a, um, uh, Nobel prize.

266
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:55,608
Yeah, they, they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together.

267
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:57,379
Testosterone!  Oh excuse me.

268
00:23:58,715 --> 00:24:01,572
- Want a lozenge?
- Umm-hmm.
- Let's go.

269
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:03,642
But Jane's better.

270
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,620
Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.

271
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:09,401
If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.

272
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,927
No, I'm not actually sorry.  I'm just trying to sound tough.

273
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,430
I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case.

274
00:24:18,043 --> 00:24:19,608
Avenging is your world.

275
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:22,671
Your world is crazy.

276
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,935
Be it ever so humble.

277
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:29,207
- You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
- I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

278
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:31,870
Well, home is home, you know.

279
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:40,521
I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"

280
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:45,896
I gotta have some of that!

281
00:24:45,994 --> 00:24:55,191
Oh, no no no, see this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men.

282
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:59,638
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.  Stop trying to scare us.  C'mon.

283
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,230
All right.

284
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,848
Excelsior!

285
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:18,925
How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?

286
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:22,324
Fella done me wrong.

287
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:25,333
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

288
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:27,744
He's not so bad.

289
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:31,178
Well, he has a temper.

290
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:33,275
Deep down he's all fluff.

291
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:37,311
Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.

292
00:25:40,783 --> 00:25:42,083
All my friends are fighters.

293
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:51,791
And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.

294
00:25:52,862 --> 00:25:53,862
Sounds amazing.

295
00:25:54,396 --> 00:25:55,696
He's also a huge dork.

296
00:25:57,883 --> 00:25:58,883
Chicks dig that.

297
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:05,204
So what do you think should I fight this?  Or run with it?

298
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:13,720
Run with it, right?  Or, did he, was he, what'd he do that was so...wrong to you?

299
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,906
Not a damn thing.

300
00:26:16,883 --> 00:26:18,244
But never say never.

301
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,359
It's nice.

302
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,060
What, what, what is?

303
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:28,334
- You and Romanoff.
- No, we haven't, that wasn't...

304
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:31,622
It's okay, nobody's breaking any by-laws.

305
00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:37,232
It's just, she's not the most...open person in the world.  But with you she seems very relaxed.

306
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,340
No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.

307
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:45,342
I've seen her flirt, up close.  This ain't that.

308
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:48,583
Look...

309
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:53,631
As maybe the world's leading authority on "waiting too long"...don't.

310
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:55,757
You both deserve a win.

311
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:03,464
What do you mean, "up close?"

312
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:06,734
- But, it's a trick!
- No, no, it's much more than that.

313
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:12,540
Ah, "whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"  Whatever man!  It's a trick.

314
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,440
Well please, be my guest.

315
00:27:15,577 --> 00:27:17,270
- C'mon.
- Really?
- Yeah!

316
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:19,415
Oh this is gonna be beautiful.

317
00:27:19,716 --> 00:27:23,316
Cliint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.

318
00:27:23,353 --> 00:27:25,802
Y'know I've seen this before, right?

319
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:30,567
And I still don't know how you do it.

320
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:33,687
- Smell the silent judgment?
- Please, Stark, by all means.

321
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:36,776
- Oh, Here we go.
- Okay.
- Uh oh.

322
00:27:36,836 --> 00:27:39,336
- Um-hmm.
- Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

323
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:41,472
- Get after it.
- Here we go.
- It's physics.

324
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:45,607
- Physics!
- Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?
- Yes, of course.

325
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:49,223
I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.

326
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:54,817
Be right back.

327
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,059
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?

328
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:06,954
- Just represent.  Pull!
- All right let's go!

329
00:28:15,341 --> 00:28:15,841
Huh?

330
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:18,194
- Whoo!
-  Let's go, Steve, no pressure.

331
00:28:22,177 --> 00:28:23,177
C'mon, Cap.

332
00:28:31,691 --> 00:28:32,691
Ha ha, nothing.  Ha ha ha.

333
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:39,066
- And? Widow?
- Oh, no no, that's not a question I need answered.

334
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:41,320
All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.

335
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:44,398
- You bet your ass.
- Steve, he said a bad language word.

336
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,084
- Did you tell everyone about that?
- The handle's imprinted, right?  Like a security code...

337
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,660
"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?

338
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:54,666
Yes, well that's uh, that's a very very interesting theory.

339
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,035
I have a simpler one.

340
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,176
You are all not worthy.

341
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:01,872
-  Nah!
- Oh, C'mon!

342
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:11,921
Worthy...

343
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,033
No...

344
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:20,902
How could you be worthy?

345
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,041
You're all killers.

346
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,834
- Stark.
- Jarvis?

347
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:28,577
I'm sorry, I was asleep.  Or...I was a dream?

348
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:33,348
Reboot.  Legionnaire 06's got a buggy suit.

349
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:38,835
There was this...terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...

350
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:40,763
...strings.

351
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,466
Had to kill the other guy.  He was a good guy.

352
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:46,726
You killed someone?

353
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:53,144
Wouldn't've been my first call.  But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.

354
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:54,171
Who sent you?

355
00:29:54,704 --> 00:29:57,493
"I see a suit of armor around the world."

356
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Ultron!

357
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:05,942
In the flesh.  Or, no, not yet.  Not this...chrysalis.

358
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:07,053
But I'm ready.

359
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:09,283
I'm on a mission.

360
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:11,618
What mission?

361
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:13,540
Peace in our time.

362
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,140
Tony!

363
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:39,749
- Sorry!
- Don't turn green!
- I won't!

364
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,166
Go!

365
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:15,480
- Stark!
- We are here to help!
- One sec, one sec!

366
00:31:15,817 --> 00:31:18,810
- We are here to help!  We are here to help...
- ...quadrant is unsafe.

367
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:23,091
- Please back away.
- We're doing our best to protect you...(recordings continue)

368
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:25,095
Hmm!

369
00:31:25,095 --> 00:31:26,796
- Thor!
- ...We are here to help...

370
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:31,030
- It's unsafe.  It's unsafe.  It's unsafe.
- No more...that's the one.
- It's unsafe.

371
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:36,508
Cap!

372
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:43,948
That was dramatic!

373
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,080
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.  You just didn't think it through.

374
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:54,623
You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change.

375
00:31:56,292 --> 00:32:01,792
How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?

376
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:05,931
With these?  These puppets?

377
00:32:10,104 --> 00:32:11,669
There's only one path to peace.

378
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:15,344
The Avengers' extinction.

379
00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:25,449
I had strings, but now I'm free.

380
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:38,162
...There are no strings on me, no strings on me...

381
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:42,250
"There are no strings on me."

382
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:45,872
All our work is gone.

383
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:48,908
Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.

384
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:51,544
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.  Files, surveillance.

385
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:54,886
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

386
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,808
He's in your files, he's in the internet.

387
00:32:58,232 --> 00:33:01,232
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

388
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,010
- Nuclear codes.
- Nuclear codes.

389
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,524
Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.

390
00:33:07,096 --> 00:33:08,996
Nukes?  He said he wanted us dead.

391
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:11,889
He didn't say dead.  He said extinct.

392
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:13,834
He also said he killed somebody.

393
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:14,868
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

394
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,087
Yes there was.

395
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:31,138
This is insane.

396
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:35,487
Jarvis was the first line of defense.  He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.

397
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:41,591
No.  Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis.  This isn't strategy, this is...

398
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:42,596
...rage.

399
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,667
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- It's going around.

400
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:49,608
- C'mon, use your words, buddy.
- I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.

401
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:50,904
Thor!  The Legionnaire?

402
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:59,575
Trail went cold about 100 miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter.

403
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:03,579
- Now we have to retrieve it, again.
- The genie's out of that bottle.

404
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:05,223
Clear and present is Ultron.

405
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,549
I don't understand.  You built this program.

406
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:12,464
Why is it trying to kill us?

407
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:15,096
(laughing)

408
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:18,998
Uhn-uhn.

409
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:20,335
You think this is funny?

410
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,970
No.  It's probably not, right?

411
00:34:26,308 --> 00:34:30,569
Is this very terrible?  Is it so...is it so...it is, it's so terrible.

412
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:33,510
This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.

413
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,702
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  It is funny.

414
00:34:36,752 --> 00:34:38,752
It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.

415
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,473
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

416
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:43,757
Really?!  That's it?

417
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:46,816
You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.

418
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:48,395
Only when I've created a murder-bot.

419
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:52,063
We didn't.  We weren't even close.  Were we close to an interface?

420
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:54,110
Well, you did something right.

421
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:55,168
And you did it right here.

422
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:57,637
The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.

423
00:34:57,672 --> 00:35:00,872
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

424
00:35:00,943 --> 00:35:02,143
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

425
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:04,205
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

426
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,239
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.

427
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:10,716
We're standing 300 feet below it.

428
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:14,003
We're the Avengers.

429
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:16,862
We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but...

430
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:20,141
...that up there?  That's...that's the end game.

431
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,830
How were you guys planning on beating that?

432
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:25,699
Together.

433
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:30,538
We'll lose.

434
00:35:32,144 --> 00:35:34,544
Then we'll do that together, too.

435
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:39,512
Thor's right.  Ultron's calling us out.

436
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:42,069
And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.

437
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,550
The world's a big place.  Let's start making it smaller.

438
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,580
Talk.  And if you are wasting our time...

439
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:15,371
Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city?

440
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:21,245
The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God.

441
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:26,355
I like that.  The geometry of belief.

442
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:30,096
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

443
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:34,890
Sometimes it's hard.  But sooner or later, every man shows himself.

444
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:37,700
Oh, I'm sure they do.

445
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,174
But you needed something more than a man.

446
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:44,044
That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

447
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,296
I didn't expect.

448
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,415
But I saw Stark's fear.  I knew it would control him,

449
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:54,288
make him self-destruct.

450
00:36:54,456 --> 00:36:56,856
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

451
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:02,426
Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers,

452
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:07,357
people create....smaller people?...

453
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:11,595
Uhhh...Children!  I lost the word there.

454
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:16,940
Children.  Designed to supplant them, to help them...

455
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:18,913
...end.

456
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:22,047
Is that why you've come?  To end the Avengers?

457
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:24,927
I've come to save the world.

458
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:27,388
But also...yeah.

459
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:34,095
We'll move out right away.

460
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:37,396
This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.

461
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,664
All of these are...

462
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:40,053
Me.

463
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:42,369
I have what the Avengers never will.  Harmony.

464
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:47,970
They're discordant, disconnected.  Stark's already got them turning on each other.

465
00:37:48,009 --> 00:37:50,109
And when you get inside the rest of their heads...

466
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:53,127
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

467
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,977
And make them martyrs?  You need patience.

468
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:57,718
Need to see the big picture.

469
00:37:57,954 --> 00:38:01,454
I don't see the big picture.  I have a little picture.

470
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:06,109
I take it out and look at it every day.

471
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:09,262
You lost your parents in the bombings.  I've seen the records.

472
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:11,577
- Their records are not the picture.
- Pietro.

473
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,364
No.  Please.

474
00:38:16,103 --> 00:38:19,708
We were ten years old.  Having dinner, the four of us.

475
00:38:20,856 --> 00:38:25,856
When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor...it's big.

476
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:29,749
Our parents go in,

477
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:33,852
and the whole building starts coming apart.

478
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:37,631
I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits.

479
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:39,972
But, it doesn't go off.

480
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:43,598
It just...

481
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:45,766
...sits there in the rubble,

482
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,970
three feet from our faces.

483
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:54,105
And on the side of the shell is painted one word...

484
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:55,409
Stark.

485
00:38:57,814 --> 00:38:59,414
We were trapped two days.

486
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:06,595
Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "this will set if off."

487
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:14,088
We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.

488
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:17,535
I know what they are.

489
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:24,602
I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.  Now I don't.

490
00:39:25,442 --> 00:39:27,042
We will make it right.

491
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:29,142
You and I can hurt them.

492
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,580
But you will tear them apart.

493
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:37,328
From the inside.

494
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:48,794
He's all over the globe...robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs...

495
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:52,518
reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.

496
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:55,583
- Fatalities?
- Only when engaged.

497
00:39:55,732 --> 00:40:01,843
Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.

498
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:02,878
Maximoffs.

499
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:06,290
Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.

500
00:40:06,386 --> 00:40:07,386
Not anymore.

501
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,858
Negative.  I answer to you.

502
00:40:15,558 --> 00:40:16,458
Yes, ma'am.

503
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:17,326
Barton.

504
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:19,088
We might have something.

505
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:20,095
Gotta go.

506
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:21,431
Who was that?

507
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:22,929
Girlfriend.

508
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:26,965
What's this?

509
00:40:27,606 --> 00:40:28,606
A message.

510
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:30,269
Ultron killed Strucker.

511
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:34,039
And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

512
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:37,740
This is a smokescreen.  Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

513
00:40:37,816 --> 00:40:40,416
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

514
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,448
Yeah, I bet he...

515
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:45,065
...yep.  Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.

516
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:46,122
Not everything.

517
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:48,877
Known associates...

518
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:51,602
Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.

519
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:53,478
Well, these people are all horrible.

520
00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:55,429
Wait.  I know that guy.

521
00:40:57,902 --> 00:41:01,122
From back in the day.  He operates off the African coast, black market arms.

522
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,214
There are conventions, all right?  You meet people.  I didn't sell him anything.

523
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:09,044
He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."

524
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:12,481
- This.
- Uh, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had it...

525
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:15,117
No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.

526
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:20,267
Oh, yeah.  It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief."

527
00:41:20,808 --> 00:41:22,108
In a much less friendly way.

528
00:41:22,507 --> 00:41:23,507
What dialect?

529
00:41:23,593 --> 00:41:25,886
Wakanada...?  W-, Wa-...Wakanda.

530
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:29,595
If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...

531
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,800
I thought your father said he got the last of it?

532
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:33,737
I don't follow.  What comes out of Wakanda?

533
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,839
The strongest metal on earth.

534
00:41:39,577 --> 00:41:40,577
Where is this guy now?

535
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:56,859
(African language)

536
00:42:06,138 --> 00:42:12,238
Don't tell me your man swindled you, I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.

537
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,975
Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.

538
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:22,724
Now, minister, where were we?

539
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:28,089
(African language)

540
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:30,179
Shut up, shut up!

541
00:42:53,035 --> 00:42:57,135
Yeah.  The enhanced.

542
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:58,919
Strucker's prize pupils.

543
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:03,256
Want a candy?

544
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:07,196
Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker.

545
00:43:08,395 --> 00:43:11,941
But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create.

546
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:14,246
Human life.  Not a growth market.

547
00:43:16,203 --> 00:43:17,496
You...you didn't know?

548
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:22,091
Is this your first time?  Intimidating someone?

549
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:25,613
I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.

550
00:43:25,715 --> 00:43:27,615
Everybody's afraid of something.

551
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,950
Cuttlefish.

552
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:35,121
Deep sea fish.  They make lights.  Disco lights, "whoom! whoom! whoom!"

553
00:43:35,124 --> 00:43:38,049
to hypnotize their prey, then they "whoom!"

554
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,713
I saw a documentary, it was terrifying.

555
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:51,765
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

556
00:43:51,848 --> 00:43:57,698
then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal...

557
00:43:58,948 --> 00:44:00,717
...with the man in charge.

558
00:44:05,388 --> 00:44:06,888
There is no "man" in charge.

559
00:44:10,737 --> 00:44:12,137
Let's talk business.

560
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,321
Upon this rock I will build my church.

561
00:44:30,782 --> 00:44:31,782
Vibranium.

562
00:44:33,114 --> 00:44:38,323
You know, it came at great personal cost.  It's worth billions.

563
00:44:43,772 --> 00:44:44,772
Now, so are you.

564
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,576
It's all under your..."dummy holdings?"  Finances, so weird.

565
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:56,667
Well I always say, "keep your friends rich and your enemies rich and wait to find out which is which."

566
00:44:59,709 --> 00:45:00,709
Stark.

567
00:45:02,212 --> 00:45:03,112
What?

568
00:45:03,177 --> 00:45:06,826
Tony Stark used to say that.  To me.

569
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:09,710
You're one of his?

570
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,420
What?!  I'm not...!

571
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:17,910
I'm not.  You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men?

572
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,145
I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man?  Stark is...

573
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:28,410
I'm sorry.  I'm s...oooh.  I'm sure that's gonna be okay, I'm sorry.  It's just,

574
00:45:28,502 --> 00:45:32,602
I don't understand.  Don't compare me with Stark!

575
00:45:34,877 --> 00:45:37,606
It's a thing with me.  Stark is, he's a sickness!

576
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,280
Ahh, Junior.

577
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:43,825
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

578
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:45,955
If I have to.

579
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:51,391
- You don't have to break anything.
- Clearly you've never made an omelet.

580
00:45:51,428 --> 00:45:52,428
He beat me by one second.

581
00:45:53,828 --> 00:45:57,501
Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark.  It's what, comfortable?

582
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:03,930
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.

583
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:05,871
You two can still walk away from this.

584
00:46:05,874 --> 00:46:06,674
Oh we will.

585
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:07,874
I know you've suffered.

586
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:09,998
Blah!  Heh, heh, Captain America.

587
00:46:10,913 --> 00:46:12,506
God's righteous man,

588
00:46:13,783 --> 00:46:16,504
pretending you could live without a war.

589
00:46:16,884 --> 00:46:19,084
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

590
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:22,014
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

591
00:46:22,189 --> 00:46:24,889
I think you're confusing peace with quiet.

592
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,533
Yuh-huh.  What's the Vibranium for?

593
00:46:27,664 --> 00:46:33,582
I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan...!

594
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:54,092
- Shoot them!
- Which ones?

595
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:56,191
- All of them!
- Move, move, move!

596
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:24,487
Huh!

597
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:25,819
Ah!!

598
00:47:28,124 --> 00:47:29,124
Oh!

599
00:47:45,806 --> 00:47:46,826
Stay down, kid!

600
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:51,348
It's time for some mind games.

601
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:55,587
Guys?  Is this a Code Green?

602
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:57,477
(garbled feedback)

603
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:12,046
Thor!  Status?

604
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:18,293
The girl tried to warp my mind.  Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

605
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:20,572
Fortunately, I am mighty.

606
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:42,429
This is going very well.

607
00:48:54,576 --> 00:48:58,376
I've done the whole mind control thing.  Not a fan.

608
00:49:05,591 --> 00:49:06,591
Yeah, you better run.

609
00:49:09,224 --> 00:49:11,605
Who's ever standing, we gotta move!

610
00:49:13,296 --> 00:49:14,296
Guys?

611
00:49:32,313 --> 00:49:33,313
Again.

612
00:49:33,548 --> 00:49:36,348
- You'll break them.
- Only the breakable ones.

613
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,318
You are made of marble.

614
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,701
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

615
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:43,890
What if I fail?

616
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:50,354
You never fail.

617
00:50:13,258 --> 00:50:15,163
Are you ready for our dance?

618
00:50:24,365 --> 00:50:27,154
Is it him?  Is that the first son of Odin?

619
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:30,001
Heimdall, your eyes!?

620
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:32,372
Oh, they see everything.

621
00:50:32,807 --> 00:50:34,916
They see you leading us to Hel.

622
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:36,911
Wake up!

623
00:50:40,285 --> 00:50:43,738
The war's over, Steve.  We can go home!

624
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,220
Imagine it!

625
00:50:55,963 --> 00:51:00,813
- I can still save you.
- We are all dead.  Can you not see?

626
00:51:05,782 --> 00:51:07,382
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

627
00:51:11,758 --> 00:51:13,595
See where your power leads.

628
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:25,429
Sloppy.

629
00:51:26,562 --> 00:51:27,855
Pretending to fail.

630
00:51:29,399 --> 00:51:31,168
The ceremony is necessary,

631
00:51:32,568 --> 00:51:35,221
for you to take your place in the world.

632
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,566
- I have no place in the world.
- Exactly.

633
00:51:42,914 --> 00:51:45,014
- What can I do?
- Ah, it hurts.

634
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:48,496
- I'm gonna kill him.  I'll be right back.
- No.

635
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:51,117
I'm over it.  I want...

636
00:51:54,322 --> 00:51:56,091
I want to finish the plan.

637
00:51:57,226 --> 00:51:58,519
I want the big one.

638
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:12,324
Ah! The Vibranium's getting away.

639
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:13,982
And you're not going anywhere.

640
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:17,699
Of course not.  I'm already there.  You'll catch on.

641
00:52:17,783 --> 00:52:20,912
But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

642
00:52:35,263 --> 00:52:37,372
News or footage, keyword: Hulk.

643
00:52:41,656 --> 00:52:44,005
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

644
00:52:44,072 --> 00:52:46,113
Well, that's not gonna happen.  Not for a while.

645
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:48,774
The whole team is down.

646
00:52:49,946 --> 00:52:50,946
You got no back up here.

647
00:52:52,147 --> 00:52:53,147
I'm calling in VERONICA.

648
00:53:01,756 --> 00:53:03,321
All units, all units...

649
00:53:03,524 --> 00:53:05,648
- Need backup!
- Whoa!  Need backup!

650
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:08,056
You tell 'em!

651
00:53:10,597 --> 00:53:12,297
Aah!  Run!  Run!

652
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,750
Raaar!

653
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,410
Get back!

654
00:53:45,803 --> 00:53:47,103
Go!

655
00:53:47,305 --> 00:53:48,870
Okay, move in, move in!

656
00:54:25,973 --> 00:54:28,150
All right everybody, stand down!

657
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:38,765
You listening?  That little witch is messing with your mind.

658
00:54:38,786 --> 00:54:41,319
You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner.

659
00:54:42,057 --> 00:54:42,757
Raaaar!

660
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:45,954
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.

661
00:54:49,968 --> 00:54:50,968
Okay.

662
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:14,467
In the back?  Dick move, Banner.

663
00:55:27,038 --> 00:55:28,603
VERONICA, gimme a hand.

664
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:59,016
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!

665
00:56:06,879 --> 00:56:09,036
Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.

666
00:56:10,615 --> 00:56:12,452
No, not that way, not that way!

667
00:56:20,256 --> 00:56:23,056
C'mon!  Bruce, you gotta work with me!

668
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,380
Everybody out!

669
00:56:43,678 --> 00:56:44,678
Going to get ugly!

670
00:56:54,288 --> 00:56:55,288
I'm sorry.

671
00:57:09,737 --> 00:57:13,206
- Damage report.
- (bzzzt).
- It's comprehensive.

672
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:14,631
Show me something.

673
00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:27,773
How quickly can we buy this building?

674
00:57:59,593 --> 00:58:01,158
Go, move, move, move, move!

675
00:58:10,663 --> 00:58:11,663
Raar!  Raaaar!

676
00:58:55,644 --> 00:58:59,405
The news is loving you guys.  Nobody else is.

677
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:05,281
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.

678
00:59:05,321 --> 00:59:06,954
Stark Relief Foundation?

679
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:08,523
Already on the scene.

680
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:12,593
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...we took a hit.

681
00:59:13,264 --> 00:59:16,393
- We'll shake it off.
- Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode.

682
00:59:17,032 --> 00:59:18,665
And stay away from here.

683
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,456
So, run and hide?

684
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,689
Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.

685
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:27,810
Neither do we.

686
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:36,382
Hey, you wanna switch out?

687
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,083
No, I'm good.

688
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:42,766
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, 'cause there's still a few hours out.

689
00:59:42,793 --> 00:59:44,358
A few hours from...where?

690
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,560
A safe house.

691
01:00:12,188 --> 01:00:14,705
- What is this place?
- A safe house.

692
01:00:15,859 --> 01:00:16,859
Let's hope.

693
01:00:22,313 --> 01:00:24,901
Honey.  I'm home.

694
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:29,004
Hi.

695
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:31,072
- Company.  Sorry didn't call ahead.
- Hey.

696
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:35,083
This is an agent of some kind.

697
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,841
Gentleman, this is Laura.

698
01:00:37,944 --> 01:00:39,441
I know all your names.

699
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:43,705
Oooh, incoming.

700
01:00:44,455 --> 01:00:47,052
- Ah!
- Dad!
- I see her!  Hey buddy!

701
01:00:47,321 --> 01:00:49,714
How you guys doing?  Ooh...

702
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:52,229
- These are...smaller agents.
- ...look at your face!

703
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,389
- Oh my goodness!
- Did you bring Auntie Nat?

704
01:00:55,566 --> 01:00:57,947
Why don't you hug her and find out?

705
01:00:59,504 --> 01:01:04,515
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we woulda called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

706
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:07,711
Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

707
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:11,418
He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way.

708
01:01:11,582 --> 01:01:14,467
- I figure it's a good place to lay low.
- Honey.

709
01:01:15,248 --> 01:01:18,248
I really missed you.  How's little Natasha, huh?

710
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:20,442
She is...

711
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:22,861
...Nathaniel.

712
01:01:25,963 --> 01:01:26,963
Traitor.

713
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,760
(chatter)

714
01:01:36,304 --> 01:01:39,705
- Somebody's getting bigger, huh?
- Somebody's getting excited to have a new...(chatter continues)

715
01:01:42,676 --> 01:01:43,576
Thor.

716
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:48,511
I saw something in that dream.  I need answers.  I won't find them here.

717
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:00,151
We can go home.

718
01:02:11,606 --> 01:02:16,368
See you worried for nothing.  Can't even feel the difference, can you?

719
01:02:18,312 --> 01:02:22,070
If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up.

720
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:25,309
Heh heh heh.  Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

721
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:32,531
What about Nat, and Dr. Banner?  How long has that been going on?

722
01:02:33,693 --> 01:02:34,593
Has what?

723
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:37,267
Ha ha ha!  You are so cute.

724
01:02:37,766 --> 01:02:38,922
Nat and...and Banner?

725
01:02:39,904 --> 01:02:42,729
I'll explain when you're older.  "Hawkeye."

726
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:43,769
Oh.  Okay.

727
01:02:46,106 --> 01:02:48,963
It's bad, right?  Nat seems really shaken.

728
01:02:50,477 --> 01:02:54,695
Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really.

729
01:02:57,919 --> 01:03:01,524
They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit.

730
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:05,506
Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.

731
01:03:05,595 --> 01:03:07,195
And that someone be you.

732
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:12,916
You know I totally support your Avenging.  I couldn't be prouder.

733
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:18,086
But I see those guys, those..."gods,"

734
01:03:20,606 --> 01:03:22,579
You don't think they need me.

735
01:03:22,987 --> 01:03:24,075
I think they do.

736
01:03:24,712 --> 01:03:26,277
Which is a lot scarier.

737
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:28,936
They're a mess.

738
01:03:30,818 --> 01:03:31,818
Yeah.

739
01:03:32,151 --> 01:03:33,784
I guess they're my mess.

740
01:03:35,265 --> 01:03:41,035
You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back.

741
01:03:45,069 --> 01:03:46,069
Things are changing for us.

742
01:03:47,634 --> 01:03:52,067
In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

743
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,039
I need...

744
01:03:57,616 --> 01:03:58,616
Just be sure.

745
01:04:00,547 --> 01:04:01,547
Yes, ma'am.

746
01:04:10,553 --> 01:04:12,322
I can feel the difference.

747
01:04:19,165 --> 01:04:20,321
(speaking Korean)

748
01:04:25,806 --> 01:04:28,187
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

749
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:33,713
I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met.  I didn't.

750
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:35,058
Do you expect a thank you note?

751
01:04:35,317 --> 01:04:37,018
I expect you to know why.

752
01:04:39,176 --> 01:04:40,076
The cradle.

753
01:04:40,148 --> 01:04:42,257
"This is the next thing, Tony."

754
01:04:42,322 --> 01:04:43,819
This...is the next me.

755
01:04:45,184 --> 01:04:49,810
The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.

756
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:50,989
It can.  You can.

757
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:53,030
You lacked the materials.

758
01:04:55,212 --> 01:04:57,389
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

759
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:03,117
But we all have room to improve.

760
01:05:22,897 --> 01:05:23,897
Oh.

761
01:05:24,534 --> 01:05:27,051
I didn't realize you were waiting.

762
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,281
I would've joined you, but uh,

763
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:31,947
it didn't seem like the right time.

764
01:05:32,705 --> 01:05:34,610
They used up all the hot water.

765
01:05:35,209 --> 01:05:36,774
I should've joined you.

766
01:05:37,244 --> 01:05:38,468
Missed our window.

767
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,380
Did we?

768
01:05:44,246 --> 01:05:45,811
The world just saw the Hulk.

769
01:05:47,522 --> 01:05:49,835
The real Hulk, for the first time.

770
01:05:53,395 --> 01:05:54,596
You know I have to leave.

771
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,011
But you assume that I have to stay?

772
01:05:57,832 --> 01:06:02,118
I had this, um, dream.  The kind that seems normal at the time.

773
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:06,732
- But when you wake...
- What did you dream?

774
01:06:07,609 --> 01:06:08,765
That I was an Avenger.

775
01:06:11,112 --> 01:06:14,922
That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.

776
01:06:16,886 --> 01:06:19,607
I think you're being harder on yourself.

777
01:06:21,189 --> 01:06:23,638
Here I was hoping that was your job.

778
01:06:26,669 --> 01:06:27,962
What are you doing?

779
01:06:29,631 --> 01:06:30,992
I'm running with it.

780
01:06:32,902 --> 01:06:33,902
With you.

781
01:06:35,434 --> 01:06:39,591
If running's the plan, as far as you want.

782
01:06:42,177 --> 01:06:43,878
Are you out of your mind?

783
01:06:49,587 --> 01:06:51,568
I mean, understand that I'm...

784
01:06:51,577 --> 01:06:52,577
Natasha.

785
01:06:53,902 --> 01:06:54,922
Where can I go?

786
01:06:56,203 --> 01:06:58,620
Where in the world am I not a threat?

787
01:06:58,653 --> 01:07:00,222
You're not a threat to me.

788
01:07:00,255 --> 01:07:01,255
You sure?

789
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:06,222
Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me.

790
01:07:08,265 --> 01:07:13,118
I can't ever...I can't have this, kids,

791
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:16,734
do the math, I physically can't.

792
01:07:18,169 --> 01:07:19,169
Neither can I.

793
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:30,360
In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um,

794
01:07:31,918 --> 01:07:34,095
they have a graduation ceremony.

795
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:37,849
They sterilize you.

796
01:07:41,131 --> 01:07:42,151
It's efficient.

797
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:47,574
One less thing to worry about.

798
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:52,676
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

799
01:07:54,865 --> 01:07:56,498
Makes everything easier.

800
01:07:58,012 --> 01:07:59,012
Even killing.

801
01:08:04,516 --> 01:08:08,053
You still think you're the only monster on the team?

802
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,192
What, so we disappear?

803
01:08:21,934 --> 01:08:25,131
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

804
01:08:25,146 --> 01:08:28,139
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

805
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,573
I was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception.

806
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:32,041
Yeah.  Give him time.

807
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:35,876
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

808
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,119
"Earth's Mightiest Heroes."  Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

809
01:08:40,487 --> 01:08:42,868
Seems like you walked away all right.

810
01:08:44,624 --> 01:08:45,848
Is that a problem?

811
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,581
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

812
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:50,759
Call me old fashioned.

813
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,192
Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

814
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:56,170
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

815
01:08:56,269 --> 01:08:59,434
Well I guess you'd know.  Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.

816
01:08:59,575 --> 01:09:01,720
- Banner and I were doing research.
- That would affect the team.

817
01:09:01,743 --> 01:09:04,776
That would end the team.  Isn't that the mission?

818
01:09:04,778 --> 01:09:10,016
Isn't that the "why we fight," so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?

819
01:09:11,086 --> 01:09:16,256
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die.

820
01:09:16,257 --> 01:09:17,257
Every time.

821
01:09:18,761 --> 01:09:25,461
I'm sorry.  Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.

822
01:09:26,569 --> 01:09:29,342
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give it a kick.

823
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:33,638
Don't take from my pile.

824
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:44,851
Hello, dear.

825
01:09:47,889 --> 01:09:49,182
Tell me everything.

826
01:09:50,326 --> 01:09:51,326
What ails you?

827
01:09:52,362 --> 01:09:53,362
Do me a favor.

828
01:09:55,063 --> 01:09:56,968
Try not to bring it to life.

829
01:09:57,382 --> 01:09:59,627
Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx.

830
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:01,984
I get it, Maria Hill called you right?

831
01:10:02,038 --> 01:10:03,583
Was she ever not working for you?

832
01:10:03,603 --> 01:10:05,236
Artificial Intelligence.

833
01:10:06,172 --> 01:10:09,594
- You never even hesitated.
- Look, it's been a really long day,

834
01:10:09,677 --> 01:10:13,638
like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?

835
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:16,297
Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.

836
01:10:16,316 --> 01:10:19,174
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.

837
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:24,147
I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.

838
01:10:26,462 --> 01:10:28,662
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

839
01:10:30,565 --> 01:10:31,565
I saw it.

840
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:34,052
I didn't tell the team.  How could I?

841
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:38,074
I saw them all dead, Nick.  Felt it.  The whole world, too.

842
01:10:38,941 --> 01:10:40,234
It's because of me.

843
01:10:41,274 --> 01:10:42,294
I wasn't ready.

844
01:10:43,512 --> 01:10:45,145
I didn't do all I could.

845
01:10:46,148 --> 01:10:48,665
The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

846
01:10:48,813 --> 01:10:51,710
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

847
01:10:52,384 --> 01:10:54,705
It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

848
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:56,116
The end of the path I started us on.

849
01:10:58,173 --> 01:11:02,051
You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.

850
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:03,634
War isn't one of them.

851
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:11,793
I watched my friends die.  You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?  Pfft.

852
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:13,708
Nope.

853
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,705
Wasn't the worst part.

854
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,359
The worst part...is that you didn't.

855
01:11:26,555 --> 01:11:27,984
I'll see you tonight.

856
01:11:30,172 --> 01:11:31,260
I like the look.

857
01:11:32,568 --> 01:11:35,873
If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.

858
01:11:35,897 --> 01:11:37,153
I need your help.

859
01:11:37,164 --> 01:11:38,429
It's nice to be needed.

860
01:11:38,497 --> 01:11:39,517
It's dangerous.

861
01:11:40,235 --> 01:11:42,480
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

862
01:11:45,272 --> 01:11:48,645
Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.

863
01:11:48,712 --> 01:11:51,612
My contacts all say he's building something.

864
01:11:51,647 --> 01:11:55,917
The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.

865
01:11:55,985 --> 01:11:57,285
What about Ultron himself?

866
01:11:57,817 --> 01:12:03,407
Ah.  He's easy to track, he's everywhere.  Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

867
01:12:03,492 --> 01:12:06,721
Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.

868
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:08,374
- He still going after launch codes?
- Yes, he is,

869
01:12:08,461 --> 01:12:10,161
but he's not making any headway.

870
01:12:10,396 --> 01:12:13,296
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.

871
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,395
Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.

872
01:12:16,396 --> 01:12:18,696
- NEXUS?
- It's the world internet hub in Oslo,

873
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:22,105
every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.

874
01:12:22,177 --> 01:12:23,470
So what'd they say?

875
01:12:23,577 --> 01:12:25,250
He's fixated on the missiles.

876
01:12:25,294 --> 01:12:27,519
But the codes are constantly being changed.

877
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:28,615
By whom?

878
01:12:29,952 --> 01:12:31,040
Parties unknown.

879
01:12:31,217 --> 01:12:32,105
We have an ally?

880
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:35,021
Ultron's got an enemy.  That's not the same thing.

881
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:36,987
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

882
01:12:37,206 --> 01:12:39,794
I might need to visit Oslo.  Find our "unknown."

883
01:12:39,828 --> 01:12:44,063
Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.

884
01:12:44,133 --> 01:12:46,157
I do.  I have you.

885
01:12:47,203 --> 01:12:50,259
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else.

886
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:53,020
You kids had all the tech you could dream of.

887
01:12:54,409 --> 01:13:00,709
Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world.

888
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:06,249
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing between him and his mission.

889
01:13:06,422 --> 01:13:12,122
And whether or not he admits it, his mission is global destruction.

890
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:14,592
All this, laid in a grave.

891
01:13:16,531 --> 01:13:17,531
So stand.

892
01:13:18,932 --> 01:13:20,837
Outwit the platinum bastard.

893
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:23,378
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

894
01:13:23,407 --> 01:13:24,672
You know what, Romanoff?

895
01:13:25,105 --> 01:13:26,534
So what does he want?

896
01:13:28,043 --> 01:13:31,243
To become better.  Better than us.

897
01:13:31,644 --> 01:13:33,345
He keeps building bodies.

898
01:13:33,414 --> 01:13:38,428
Person bodies.  The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

899
01:13:38,521 --> 01:13:40,121
But he keeps coming back to it.

900
01:13:41,053 --> 01:13:44,323
When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.

901
01:13:44,327 --> 01:13:48,027
They don't need to be protected.  They need to evolve.

902
01:13:50,763 --> 01:13:53,432
- Ultron's going to evolve.
- How?

903
01:13:55,434 --> 01:13:58,291
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

904
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,120
It's beautiful.

905
01:14:04,015 --> 01:14:08,733
The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them.

906
01:14:08,818 --> 01:14:10,395
And SHIELD never even thought...

907
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:15,117
The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a frisbee.

908
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:19,614
Typical of humans.  They scratch the surface and never think...

909
01:14:21,061 --> 01:14:22,285
...to look within.

910
01:14:33,108 --> 01:14:36,818
- I'll take Natasha and Clint.
- All right.  Strictly recon.

911
01:14:36,913 --> 01:14:37,913
I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.

912
01:14:38,481 --> 01:14:39,966
If Ultron is really building a body...

913
01:14:40,012 --> 01:14:43,109
He'll be more powerful than any of us.  Maybe all of us.

914
01:14:43,985 --> 01:14:46,094
An android designed by a robot.

915
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,334
You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.

916
01:14:49,357 --> 01:14:52,802
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.  Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

917
01:14:52,829 --> 01:14:55,617
She's all yours.  Apparently.  What are you gonna do?

918
01:14:56,233 --> 01:14:58,990
I don't know.  Something dramatic, I hope.

919
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:04,745
I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.

920
01:15:06,339 --> 01:15:09,325
Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

921
01:15:09,512 --> 01:15:10,512
No.

922
01:15:11,243 --> 01:15:12,740
It's the last project.

923
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:15,279
I Promise.

924
01:15:33,769 --> 01:15:34,769
This is it.

925
01:15:36,572 --> 01:15:37,865
The Water of Sight.

926
01:15:41,008 --> 01:15:43,525
In every realm, there's a reflection.

927
01:15:44,713 --> 01:15:49,813
If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.

928
01:15:50,819 --> 01:15:54,424
The men who enter that water...the legends don't end well.

929
01:15:56,491 --> 01:15:59,064
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?  He could be anywhere.

930
01:15:59,092 --> 01:16:04,492
And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

931
01:16:05,864 --> 01:16:07,495
How do you find it?

932
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,945
Pretty simple.  You bring a magnet.

933
01:16:11,739 --> 01:16:15,159
(sings) Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to.

934
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,498
Come and get me.

935
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:32,290
Wake up!

936
01:16:39,301 --> 01:16:40,301
Thor!

937
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:41,870
Extinction.

938
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:59,373
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream.

939
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:04,621
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.

940
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:07,646
I can read him.

941
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:10,583
He is dreaming.

942
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:16,611
I wouldn't call it dreams.  It's Ultron's base consciousness.  Informational noise.  Soon...

943
01:17:16,638 --> 01:17:19,438
How soon?  I'm not being pushy.

944
01:17:19,474 --> 01:17:25,874
We're imprinting a physical brain.  There are no shortcuts.  Even if you imagined...

945
01:17:26,147 --> 01:17:27,147
Aaah!

946
01:17:30,786 --> 01:17:31,786
He...

947
01:17:34,854 --> 01:17:37,795
- How could you?
- How could I what?

948
01:17:37,872 --> 01:17:40,525
You said we would destroy the Avengers.

949
01:17:41,227 --> 01:17:44,220
- Make a better world.
- It will be better.

950
01:17:44,266 --> 01:17:46,266
- When everyone is dead.
- That is not...!

951
01:17:46,934 --> 01:17:50,607
The human race will have every opportunity to improve.

952
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:53,163
And if they don't?

953
01:17:53,175 --> 01:17:54,175
Ask Noah.

954
01:17:55,473 --> 01:17:56,561
You're a madman.

955
01:17:57,108 --> 01:18:03,230
There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

956
01:18:03,587 --> 01:18:10,177
When the earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up.

957
01:18:11,793 --> 01:18:15,317
We have to evolve.  There's no room for the weak.

958
01:18:15,361 --> 01:18:19,361
And who decides who's weak?

959
01:18:19,749 --> 01:18:23,386
Life.  Life always decides.

960
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:30,759
There's incoming.  The Quinjet.  We have to move.

961
01:18:30,844 --> 01:18:32,273
That's not a problem.

962
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:39,779
Uh, wait, guys!  I...

963
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:48,007
They don't understand.  When they see, they'll understand.

964
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:51,639
I just need a little more...time.

965
01:19:03,176 --> 01:19:05,176
Two minutes.  Stay close.

966
01:19:12,284 --> 01:19:13,284
Dr. Cho!

967
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:19,109
He's uploading himself into the body.

968
01:19:19,203 --> 01:19:20,203
Where?

969
01:19:21,764 --> 01:19:24,417
The real power is inside the cradle.

970
01:19:24,799 --> 01:19:27,884
The gem.  Its power is uncontainable.

971
01:19:29,873 --> 01:19:31,642
You can't just blow it up.

972
01:19:33,237 --> 01:19:34,786
You have to get the cradle to Stark.

973
01:19:34,878 --> 01:19:36,511
First I have to find it.

974
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:37,542
Go.

975
01:19:37,848 --> 01:19:39,141
- Did you guys copy that?
- We did.

976
01:19:39,813 --> 01:19:46,191
I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest.  That could be him.

977
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,520
There.  It's the truck from the lab.  Right above you, Cap.

978
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:51,394
On the loop by the bridge.

979
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:55,235
It's them.  Got three with the cradle, one in the cab.

980
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:57,132
I could take out the driver.

981
01:19:57,196 --> 01:19:59,878
Negative!  That truck crashes, the gem could level the city.

982
01:19:59,968 --> 01:20:01,268
We need to draw out Ultron.

983
01:20:11,313 --> 01:20:12,401
No, no no no no.

984
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:16,038
Leave me alone!

985
01:20:24,494 --> 01:20:27,767
Well he's definitely unhappy!  I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

986
01:20:27,962 --> 01:20:30,139
You're not a match for him, Cap.

987
01:20:30,896 --> 01:20:31,916
Thanks, Barton.

988
01:20:53,858 --> 01:20:55,967
You know what's in that cradle?

989
01:20:56,559 --> 01:21:00,300
The power to make real change.  And that terrifies you.

990
01:21:00,327 --> 01:21:02,368
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

991
01:21:05,064 --> 01:21:06,064
Stop it!

992
01:21:16,245 --> 01:21:21,033
We got a window.  4, 3...  Give 'em hell.

993
01:21:31,623 --> 01:21:34,140
I'm always picking up after you boys.

994
01:21:34,428 --> 01:21:37,133
They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.

995
01:21:37,133 --> 01:21:38,133
Which way?

996
01:21:38,301 --> 01:21:39,301
Hard right...

997
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:41,292
Now.

998
01:22:12,265 --> 01:22:13,885
Out of the way!  Coming through!

999
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:15,439
Sorry, coming through!

1000
01:22:29,858 --> 01:22:30,858
Come on!

1001
01:22:32,194 --> 01:22:33,194
Clint!  Can you draw out the guards?

1002
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:34,645
Let's find out.

1003
01:22:35,462 --> 01:22:36,462
Beep beep!

1004
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:56,835
(Korean language)

1005
01:23:13,832 --> 01:23:17,933
They're heading back towards you.  So whatever you're going to do, do it now.

1006
01:23:22,474 --> 01:23:25,059
I'm going in.  Cap, can you keep him occupied?

1007
01:23:25,909 --> 01:23:28,222
What do you think I've been doing?

1008
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:12,351
The package is airborne.

1009
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:15,085
I have a clean shot.

1010
01:24:15,126 --> 01:24:17,248
- Negative.  I am still in the truck.
- What the hell are you...

1011
01:24:17,339 --> 01:24:19,439
Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.

1012
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:21,249
How do you want me to take it?

1013
01:24:21,298 --> 01:24:24,155
Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.

1014
01:24:35,713 --> 01:24:37,278
Please.  Don't do this.

1015
01:24:38,118 --> 01:24:39,683
What choice do we have?

1016
01:24:47,703 --> 01:24:48,703
I lost him!

1017
01:24:48,794 --> 01:24:50,594
He's heading your way!

1018
01:24:55,538 --> 01:24:56,762
Nat, we gotta go.

1019
01:25:07,746 --> 01:25:09,146
- Clint!
- Nat!

1020
01:25:13,185 --> 01:25:14,341
Cap, you see Nat?

1021
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,249
If you have the package, get it to Stark!  Go!

1022
01:25:18,289 --> 01:25:19,922
- Do you have eyes on Nat?
- Go!

1023
01:25:24,438 --> 01:25:25,438
Civilians in our path.

1024
01:25:26,597 --> 01:25:28,230
Can you stop this thing?

1025
01:26:07,065 --> 01:26:09,565
I'm fine.  I just need to take a minute.

1026
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:11,824
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1027
01:26:12,014 --> 01:26:13,619
The cradle.  Did you get it?

1028
01:26:14,147 --> 01:26:15,848
Stark'll take care of it.

1029
01:26:17,449 --> 01:26:18,449
No, he won't.

1030
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:23,801
You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.

1031
01:26:23,821 --> 01:26:26,214
He will do anything to make things right.

1032
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:32,399
Stark, come in.

1033
01:26:32,836 --> 01:26:33,836
Stark.

1034
01:26:35,234 --> 01:26:36,322
Anyone on comms?

1035
01:26:36,534 --> 01:26:41,704
Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it.

1036
01:26:42,108 --> 01:26:44,208
Where do you think he gets that?

1037
01:26:46,987 --> 01:26:47,787
Anything on Nat?

1038
01:26:47,878 --> 01:26:51,476
Haven't heard.  But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.

1039
01:26:51,484 --> 01:26:55,649
- This is sealed tight.
- We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.

1040
01:26:57,222 --> 01:27:01,176
Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?

1041
01:27:01,727 --> 01:27:04,936
There's some nets I can cast.  Yeah, all right.  I'll find her.

1042
01:27:07,401 --> 01:27:12,639
I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

1043
01:27:13,038 --> 01:27:14,194
Yeah, about that.

1044
01:27:18,475 --> 01:27:19,275
No.

1045
01:27:19,277 --> 01:27:21,262
- You have to trust me.
- Kinda don't.

1046
01:27:21,348 --> 01:27:25,048
Our ally?  The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes?

1047
01:27:27,152 --> 01:27:28,152
I found him.

1048
01:27:28,753 --> 01:27:29,977
Hello, Dr. Banner.

1049
01:27:30,146 --> 01:27:37,493
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis 'cause he was angry.  He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.

1050
01:27:37,764 --> 01:27:43,342
So Jarvis went underground.  Okay, scattered, dumped his memory.  But not his protocols.

1051
01:27:43,919 --> 01:27:47,041
He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.

1052
01:27:48,804 --> 01:27:55,004
So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?

1053
01:27:55,024 --> 01:27:58,848
No, of course not!  I want to help you put Jarvis in this thing.

1054
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:04,330
We're out of my field here.  You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1055
01:28:04,955 --> 01:28:09,785
And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix can beat Ultron's?

1056
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:12,014
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.

1057
01:28:12,932 --> 01:28:19,632
This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

1058
01:28:19,703 --> 01:28:22,003
- We have to.
- I believe it's worth a go.

1059
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:28,664
No.  I'm in a loop.  I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.

1060
01:28:28,677 --> 01:28:31,477
I know, I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it.

1061
01:28:33,185 --> 01:28:40,091
We're mad scientists.  We're monsters, buddy.  You gotta own it.  Make a stand.

1062
01:28:45,128 --> 01:28:48,752
It's not a loop.  It's the end of the line.

1063
01:29:10,058 --> 01:29:14,558
I wasn't sure you'd wake up.  I hoped you would, I wanted to show you.

1064
01:29:15,895 --> 01:29:18,396
I don't have anyone else.

1065
01:29:19,966 --> 01:29:23,635
I think a lot about the meteors, the purity of them.

1066
01:29:24,439 --> 01:29:27,068
"Boom!", the end, start again.

1067
01:29:27,472 --> 01:29:31,689
The world made clean for the new man to rebuild.

1068
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:34,303
I was meant to be new.

1069
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:36,654
I was meant to be beautiful.

1070
01:29:38,695 --> 01:29:43,741
The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy.

1071
01:29:44,724 --> 01:29:48,057
Instead they'll look up in horror because of you.

1072
01:29:48,494 --> 01:29:51,895
You've wounded me.  I give you full marks for that.

1073
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,597
But, like the man said, "What doesn't kill me...

1074
01:30:01,307 --> 01:30:03,776
...just makes me stronger!"

1075
01:30:42,881 --> 01:30:44,922
This framework is not compatible.

1076
01:30:45,016 --> 01:30:46,716
The genetic coding tower's at 97 percent.

1077
01:30:48,351 --> 01:30:52,905
You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.

1078
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:55,092
I'm gonna say this once.

1079
01:30:55,161 --> 01:30:56,249
How about "nonce"?

1080
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:57,326
Shut it down.

1081
01:30:57,328 --> 01:30:58,661
Nope.  Not gonna happen.

1082
01:30:58,697 --> 01:31:01,158
- You don't know what you're doing.
- And you do?  She's not in your head?

1083
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:05,636
- I know you're angry.
- No, we're way past that.

1084
01:31:05,938 --> 01:31:08,652
I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

1085
01:31:08,694 --> 01:31:10,144
Banner, after everything that's happened...

1086
01:31:10,148 --> 01:31:13,985
- That's nothing compared to what's coming.
- You don't know what's in there.  The creature...
- This isn't a game.

1087
01:31:17,547 --> 01:31:20,748
No, no.  Go on.  You were saying?

1088
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,860
Pietro!

1089
01:31:30,495 --> 01:31:32,808
What?  You didn't see that coming?

1090
01:31:35,169 --> 01:31:37,638
I'm re-routing the upload.

1091
01:31:42,543 --> 01:31:44,108
Go ahead.  Piss me off.

1092
01:31:56,422 --> 01:31:57,422
Wait!

1093
01:33:22,192 --> 01:33:23,192
I'm sorry.  That was...

1094
01:33:25,175 --> 01:33:26,175
...odd.

1095
01:33:26,745 --> 01:33:27,745
Thank you.

1096
01:33:33,228 --> 01:33:34,228
Thor.

1097
01:33:34,685 --> 01:33:36,250
You helped create this?

1098
01:33:36,689 --> 01:33:42,879
I've had a vision.  A whirlpool that  sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that.

1099
01:33:43,129 --> 01:33:43,729
What, the gem?

1100
01:33:43,863 --> 01:33:50,263
It's the Mind Stone.  It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.

1101
01:33:50,334 --> 01:33:52,327
- Then why would you bring it to...
- Because Stark is right.

1102
01:33:52,406 --> 01:33:54,719
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

1103
01:33:54,908 --> 01:33:57,221
- The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
- Not alone.

1104
01:33:58,312 --> 01:34:00,401
Why does your "vision" sound like Jarvis?

1105
01:34:00,477 --> 01:34:04,674
We reconfigured Jarvis' matrix to create something new.

1106
01:34:05,185 --> 01:34:07,262
I think I've had my fill of new.

1107
01:34:07,287 --> 01:34:10,620
- You think I'm a child of Ultron?
- You're not?

1108
01:34:12,492 --> 01:34:19,212
I'm not Ultron.  I'm not Jarvis.  I am...

1109
01:34:19,261 --> 01:34:20,261
I am.

1110
01:34:22,734 --> 01:34:25,559
I looked in your head and saw annihilation.

1111
01:34:25,601 --> 01:34:26,601
Look again.

1112
01:34:27,303 --> 01:34:29,932
Yeah.  Your seal of approval means jack to me.

1113
01:34:30,071 --> 01:34:36,136
Their powers.  The horrors in our heads.  Ultron himself.  They all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.

1114
01:34:36,149 --> 01:34:37,149
But with it on our side...

1115
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:39,468
Is it?  Are you?

1116
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:42,384
On our side?

1117
01:34:44,156 --> 01:34:46,197
I don't think it's that simple.

1118
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:49,141
Well it better get real simple real soon.

1119
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:55,193
I'm on the side of life.  Ultron isn't.  He will end it all.

1120
01:34:55,867 --> 01:34:58,044
- What's he waiting for?
- You.

1121
01:34:58,704 --> 01:35:00,465
- Where?
- Sokovia.

1122
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:02,206
He's got Nat there too.

1123
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:05,848
If we're wrong about you...

1124
01:35:07,846 --> 01:35:09,846
...if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

1125
01:35:10,949 --> 01:35:12,805
What will you do?

1126
01:35:19,057 --> 01:35:24,198
I don't want to kill Ultron.  He's unique.  And he's in pain.

1127
01:35:26,782 --> 01:35:31,136
But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed.

1128
01:35:31,203 --> 01:35:36,103
Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the 'net, we have to act now.

1129
01:35:37,142 --> 01:35:40,791
And not one of us can do it without the others.

1130
01:35:43,282 --> 01:35:46,682
Maybe I am a monster.  I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1131
01:35:48,552 --> 01:35:51,953
I'm not what you are.  And not what you intended.

1132
01:35:54,161 --> 01:35:55,654
So there may be no way to make you trust me.

1133
01:35:55,728 --> 01:35:56,952
But we need to go.

1134
01:36:12,442 --> 01:36:13,442
Right.

1135
01:36:14,516 --> 01:36:15,516
Well done.

1136
01:36:17,513 --> 01:36:18,513
Three minutes.

1137
01:36:19,451 --> 01:36:20,675
Get what you need.

1138
01:36:36,868 --> 01:36:38,161
Good evening, boss.

1139
01:36:42,808 --> 01:36:46,289
No way we all get through this.  If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.

1140
01:36:47,212 --> 01:36:49,957
- It's gonna be blood on the floor.
- I got no plans tomorrow night.

1141
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:53,913
I get first crack at the big guy.  Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1142
01:36:54,651 --> 01:36:57,032
That's true, he hates you the most.

1143
01:37:01,358 --> 01:37:06,258
Ultron knows we're coming.  Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1144
01:37:06,653 --> 01:37:11,007
And that's what we signed up for.  But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1145
01:37:11,938 --> 01:37:15,538
So our priority is getting them out.

1146
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:19,333
We're under attack.  Clear the city, now.

1147
01:37:26,914 --> 01:37:28,207
Get off your asses.

1148
01:37:29,287 --> 01:37:34,169
All they want is to live their lives in peace.  And that's not going to happen today.

1149
01:37:34,825 --> 01:37:39,145
But we can do our best to protect them.  And we can get the job done.

1150
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:44,683
We find out what Ultron's been building.

1151
01:37:45,289 --> 01:37:46,445
We find Romanoff,

1152
01:37:47,872 --> 01:37:49,165
and we clear the field.

1153
01:37:50,025 --> 01:37:51,998
Keep the fight between us.

1154
01:37:59,551 --> 01:38:03,824
Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world.

1155
01:38:04,656 --> 01:38:09,456
This isn't just about beating him.  It's about whether he's right.

1156
01:38:15,836 --> 01:38:18,660
Natasha!  Natasha!

1157
01:38:19,704 --> 01:38:20,704
Bruce?

1158
01:38:22,471 --> 01:38:23,471
You all right?

1159
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:24,408
Yeah.

1160
01:38:24,477 --> 01:38:26,370
The team's in the city, it's about to light up.

1161
01:38:26,414 --> 01:38:28,347
I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?

1162
01:38:28,911 --> 01:38:31,011
Yeah.  I did.

1163
01:38:37,192 --> 01:38:38,185
So what's our play?

1164
01:38:38,525 --> 01:38:41,125
- I'm here to get you to safety.
- Job's not finished.

1165
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:48,005
We get out with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians.  And you've done plenty.

1166
01:38:50,035 --> 01:38:51,259
Our fight is over.

1167
01:38:53,206 --> 01:38:54,635
So we just disappear?

1168
01:39:00,047 --> 01:39:01,047
Come on.

1169
01:39:05,623 --> 01:39:09,384
Your man's in the church, boss.  I think he's waiting for you.

1170
01:39:14,227 --> 01:39:15,996
Come to confess your sins?

1171
01:39:16,628 --> 01:39:18,241
I don't know, how much time you got?

1172
01:39:18,242 --> 01:39:19,642
More than you.

1173
01:39:20,365 --> 01:39:23,665
Uhhh.  Have you been juicing?  On a Vibranium cocktail?

1174
01:39:24,634 --> 01:39:27,027
You're looking...I don't wanna say, puffy...

1175
01:39:27,102 --> 01:39:28,190
You're stalling to protect the people.

1176
01:39:29,121 --> 01:39:32,046
Well, that is the mission.  Did you forget?

1177
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:35,719
I've moved beyond your mission.  I'm free.

1178
01:39:39,587 --> 01:39:40,587
What,

1179
01:39:41,316 --> 01:39:43,969
you think you're the only one stalling?

1180
01:39:44,787 --> 01:39:47,800
There's the rest of the Vibranium.  Function: still unclear.

1181
01:39:47,928 --> 01:39:49,697
This is how you end, Tony.

1182
01:39:50,364 --> 01:39:52,065
This is peace in my time.

1183
01:40:08,833 --> 01:40:09,833
Go!

1184
01:40:14,755 --> 01:40:15,755
Get off the bridge!

1185
01:40:20,894 --> 01:40:21,894
Run!

1186
01:40:23,627 --> 01:40:24,627
Ultron!

1187
01:40:31,034 --> 01:40:34,571
My Vision.  They really did take everything from me.

1188
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:38,780
- You set the terms, you can change them.
- All right.

1189
01:40:40,477 --> 01:40:41,477
Ahhh!

1190
01:41:02,267 --> 01:41:03,628
FRIDAY!  The Vision?

1191
01:41:03,668 --> 01:41:08,278
Boss, it's working.  He's burning Ultron out of the 'net, he won't escape through there.

1192
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:12,998
You shut me out!

1193
01:41:14,312 --> 01:41:15,468
You think I care?

1194
01:41:17,395 --> 01:41:20,252
You take away my world, I take away yours.

1195
01:41:28,694 --> 01:41:30,687
Whoa!  What's this?

1196
01:41:35,667 --> 01:41:36,667
Run!

1197
01:41:45,909 --> 01:41:46,909
Get back, get back!

1198
01:42:05,933 --> 01:42:08,654
- FRIDAY?
- Sokovia's going for a ride.

1199
01:42:21,314 --> 01:42:28,011
Do you see?  The beauty of it.  The inevitability.

1200
01:42:28,188 --> 01:42:31,653
You rise, only to fall.

1201
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:42,319
You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure.

1202
01:42:45,136 --> 01:42:49,150
Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.

1203
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:50,696
It means nothing.

1204
01:42:51,117 --> 01:42:56,883
When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.

1205
01:43:01,752 --> 01:43:02,752
We gotta move.

1206
01:43:03,322 --> 01:43:04,531
You're not going to turn green?

1207
01:43:04,893 --> 01:43:07,826
I've got a compelling reason to not lose my cool.

1208
01:43:07,893 --> 01:43:08,893
I adore you.

1209
01:43:17,302 --> 01:43:19,003
But I need the other guy.

1210
01:43:24,375 --> 01:43:25,599
Let's finish the job.

1211
01:43:42,724 --> 01:43:45,969
- I really hope this makes us even.
- (grunt)

1212
01:43:46,265 --> 01:43:48,821
- Now go be a hero.
- Raaar!

1213
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:01,018
The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.

1214
01:44:01,048 --> 01:44:05,410
- If it drops?
- Right now the impact would kill thousands.  Once it gets high enough...

1215
01:44:05,411 --> 01:44:06,635
...global extinction.

1216
01:44:10,556 --> 01:44:12,869
That building's not clear, its tenth floor.

1217
01:44:17,881 --> 01:44:18,881
Hi.

1218
01:44:20,231 --> 01:44:22,128
Okay.  Get in the tub!

1219
01:44:29,374 --> 01:44:32,163
We got airborne, heading up to the bridge.

1220
01:44:33,353 --> 01:44:34,986
Cap, you got incoming.

1221
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,781
Incoming already came in.

1222
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:42,247
Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.

1223
01:44:42,522 --> 01:44:45,727
The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart.

1224
01:44:45,827 --> 01:44:51,245
You get hurt, hurt 'em back.  You get killed, walk it off.

1225
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:27,330
Go, go, move!

1226
01:45:32,603 --> 01:45:34,403
How could I let this happen?

1227
01:45:34,572 --> 01:45:35,865
Hey, hey, you okay?

1228
01:45:36,307 --> 01:45:37,327
This is all our fault.

1229
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:38,128
Hey, look at me.

1230
01:45:38,197 --> 01:45:40,598
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares.

1231
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,041
Are you up for this?

1232
01:45:42,247 --> 01:45:43,247
Are you?

1233
01:45:44,028 --> 01:45:47,633
Look, I just need to know, 'cause the city i-, is flying.

1234
01:45:47,854 --> 01:45:53,472
Okay, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow.

1235
01:45:53,478 --> 01:45:55,179
None of this makes sense.

1236
01:45:57,662 --> 01:46:01,335
But I'm going back out there because of my job.  Okay?

1237
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,441
And I can't do my job and babysit.

1238
01:46:03,933 --> 01:46:09,612
It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were.  If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.

1239
01:46:09,638 --> 01:46:15,311
Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door,

1240
01:46:15,813 --> 01:46:17,106
you are an Avenger.

1241
01:46:21,821 --> 01:46:23,250
All right, good chat.

1242
01:46:26,357 --> 01:46:28,058
Yeah, the city is flying.

1243
01:47:01,993 --> 01:47:02,993
I got you!

1244
01:47:03,897 --> 01:47:04,985
Just look at me.

1245
01:47:11,368 --> 01:47:13,001
You can't save them all.

1246
01:47:14,414 --> 01:47:15,434
You'll never...

1247
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:18,818
"You'll never" what?  You didn't finish!

1248
01:47:22,515 --> 01:47:24,080
What, were you napping?

1249
01:47:46,134 --> 01:47:47,434
Thor!

1250
01:47:48,807 --> 01:47:50,236
You are bothering me.

1251
01:47:59,619 --> 01:48:00,619
Ow!

1252
01:48:02,188 --> 01:48:03,188
Uh...

1253
01:48:26,544 --> 01:48:30,321
- All right, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear!  We are very not clear!

1254
01:48:33,116 --> 01:48:34,817
All right, coming to you.

1255
01:48:34,988 --> 01:48:36,144
Keep up, old man.

1256
01:48:39,592 --> 01:48:40,816
Nobody would know.

1257
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:42,708
Nobody.

1258
01:48:44,259 --> 01:48:51,046
Yeah, last I saw him, and Ultron was sitting on him, uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.  I miss him already.

1259
01:49:05,814 --> 01:49:07,634
Hold your fire!

1260
01:49:16,927 --> 01:49:17,927
Romanoff!

1261
01:49:18,463 --> 01:49:19,463
Thanks.

1262
01:49:29,007 --> 01:49:34,504
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.  Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust.  The city's not coming down slow.

1263
01:49:34,544 --> 01:49:36,454
The spire's Vibranium.  If I get Thor to hit it...

1264
01:49:37,117 --> 01:49:40,017
It'll crack.  If that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.

1265
01:49:40,552 --> 01:49:43,758
What if we could cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.

1266
01:49:44,136 --> 01:49:46,109
That could vaporize the city.  And everyone on it.

1267
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:55,197
The next wave's gonna hit any minute.

1268
01:49:55,201 --> 01:49:56,802
What have you got, Stark?

1269
01:49:56,865 --> 01:50:00,538
Well, nothing great.  Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1270
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:03,262
That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.

1271
01:50:03,308 --> 01:50:06,133
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

1272
01:50:06,210 --> 01:50:08,271
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1273
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:10,827
We're going to have to make a choice.

1274
01:50:11,051 --> 01:50:14,625
Cap, these people are going nowhere.  If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

1275
01:50:15,386 --> 01:50:16,687
Not 'til everyone's safe.

1276
01:50:16,687 --> 01:50:19,487
Everyone up here versus everyone down there?  There's no math there.

1277
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:21,490
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1278
01:50:21,794 --> 01:50:23,767
I didn't say we should leave.

1279
01:50:25,459 --> 01:50:27,092
There's worse ways to go.

1280
01:50:32,272 --> 01:50:35,197
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

1281
01:50:36,491 --> 01:50:41,191
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.  It's about to get better.

1282
01:51:04,502 --> 01:51:10,755
Nice, right?  I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.  She's dusty, but she'll do.

1283
01:51:10,772 --> 01:51:12,373
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1284
01:51:12,373 --> 01:51:14,834
Oooh!  You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1285
01:51:15,114 --> 01:51:17,091
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1286
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:23,580
Lifeboats secure to deploy.  Disengage in 3, 2...take 'em out.

1287
01:51:32,829 --> 01:51:33,849
This is SHIELD?

1288
01:51:34,931 --> 01:51:37,448
This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.

1289
01:51:39,271 --> 01:51:40,564
This is not so bad.

1290
01:51:43,941 --> 01:51:44,941
Let's load 'em up.

1291
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,866
Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.

1292
01:51:54,262 --> 01:51:55,691
Show 'em what we got.

1293
01:51:56,085 --> 01:51:57,085
You're up.

1294
01:52:02,727 --> 01:52:05,448
Yes!  Now this is gonna be a good story.

1295
01:52:08,334 --> 01:52:10,307
Yup.  If you live to tell it.

1296
01:52:10,636 --> 01:52:12,577
You think I can't hold my own?

1297
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:14,771
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1298
01:52:14,807 --> 01:52:16,508
You had to make it weird.

1299
01:52:20,447 --> 01:52:22,847
Donovan!  I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.

1300
01:52:24,918 --> 01:52:26,406
All right, let's go!

1301
01:52:40,568 --> 01:52:42,297
Here we go, here we go, let's move.

1302
01:52:42,299 --> 01:52:43,299
Let's go everyone!

1303
01:52:46,228 --> 01:52:52,963
Number six boat is topped and locked.  Or, uh, or stocked, topped, it...it's uh, full of people.

1304
01:52:54,610 --> 01:52:55,610
Incoming!

1305
01:52:58,424 --> 01:52:59,424
Oh, God!

1306
01:53:10,294 --> 01:53:11,791
You think you're saving anyone?

1307
01:53:13,395 --> 01:53:18,983
I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead.  Even you can't stop that.

1308
01:53:19,203 --> 01:53:27,902
I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say!  Are you ready?

1309
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,525
It's terribly well balanced.

1310
01:53:36,573 --> 01:53:40,791
Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.

1311
01:53:41,104 --> 01:53:43,825
I got it!  Create a heat seal.  I can...

1312
01:53:45,386 --> 01:53:49,536
- I can supercharge the spire from below.
- Running numbers.

1313
01:53:58,810 --> 01:54:02,231
- A heat seal could work with enough power.
- Thor, I got a plan!

1314
01:54:02,279 --> 01:54:05,144
We're out of time.  They're coming for the core.

1315
01:54:05,149 --> 01:54:07,682
- Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
- On it.

1316
01:54:07,862 --> 01:54:10,311
Avengers, time to work for a living.

1317
01:54:19,231 --> 01:54:20,731
- You good?
- Yeah.

1318
01:54:21,453 --> 01:54:22,453
Romanoff?

1319
01:54:22,935 --> 01:54:25,676
You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini.

1320
01:54:25,938 --> 01:54:28,638
Relax, Shell-head.  Not all of us can fly.

1321
01:54:34,078 --> 01:54:36,167
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1322
01:54:36,248 --> 01:54:38,348
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

1323
01:54:42,819 --> 01:54:44,219
Is that the best you can do?

1324
01:54:54,266 --> 01:54:55,286
You had to ask.

1325
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,867
This is the best I can do.

1326
01:54:58,936 --> 01:55:03,086
This is exactly what I wanted.  All of you against all of me.

1327
01:55:04,109 --> 01:55:06,626
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1328
01:55:07,976 --> 01:55:11,321
Like the old man said.  Together.

1329
01:55:11,682 --> 01:55:13,282
Raaarrrr!!!

1330
01:56:38,838 --> 01:56:42,438
Uhh!  You know, with the benefit of hindsight....

1331
01:56:47,034 --> 01:56:48,034
Rarrrr!

1332
01:56:51,718 --> 01:56:53,459
They'll try to leave the city.

1333
01:56:53,485 --> 01:56:55,394
We can't let 'em, not even one.  Rhodey!

1334
01:56:55,412 --> 01:56:57,912
I'm on it.  Oh no, I didn't say you could leave.

1335
01:56:58,589 --> 01:57:00,358
War Machine, comin' at you, right...

1336
01:57:07,126 --> 01:57:08,126
Okay, what?

1337
01:57:08,431 --> 01:57:12,055
We gotta move out.  Even I can tell the air is getting thin.  You guys get to the boats...

1338
01:57:12,124 --> 01:57:14,124
I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.

1339
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:15,497
What about the core?

1340
01:57:15,806 --> 01:57:20,094
I'll protect it.  It's my job.

1341
01:57:20,978 --> 01:57:21,978
Nat.

1342
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:31,270
- Get the people on the boats.
- I'm not going to leave you.
- I can handle these.

1343
01:57:33,121 --> 01:57:35,346
Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.

1344
01:57:35,358 --> 01:57:36,878
- Mmm.
- You understand?

1345
01:57:38,926 --> 01:57:41,047
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1346
01:57:41,323 --> 01:57:42,323
Heh. Go.

1347
01:57:43,966 --> 01:57:50,156
- Boss, power levels are way below...
- Re-route everything.  We've got one shot at this.

1348
01:57:52,208 --> 01:57:54,861
I know what I need to do.  The dining room!

1349
01:57:55,546 --> 01:58:00,512
If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh.

1350
01:58:00,598 --> 01:58:03,259
Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?

1351
01:58:03,406 --> 01:58:05,491
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1352
01:58:05,588 --> 01:58:07,561
No one eats in a dining room.

1353
01:58:10,026 --> 01:58:11,026
Raarrrr!

1354
01:58:12,263 --> 01:58:14,168
We don't have a lot of time.

1355
01:58:14,196 --> 01:58:15,965
So get your ass on a boat.

1356
01:58:28,681 --> 01:58:29,681
Hey big guy.

1357
01:58:31,884 --> 01:58:33,449
Sun's getting real low.

1358
01:58:34,459 --> 01:58:37,908
You'll see, It'll be okay. ...

1359
01:58:39,923 --> 01:58:40,816
Secure your gear...

1360
01:58:41,092 --> 01:58:42,092
Costel?

1361
01:58:43,526 --> 01:58:44,526
We were in the market.

1362
01:58:45,295 --> 01:58:48,088
Costel?!

1363
01:59:00,679 --> 01:59:02,872
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

1364
01:59:02,913 --> 01:59:04,614
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1365
01:59:05,017 --> 01:59:06,017
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1366
01:59:06,048 --> 01:59:11,113
- Y'know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.
- Maybe not.

1367
01:59:30,175 --> 01:59:35,921
(singing) I have no strings, so I have fun.  I'm not tied up to anyone.

1368
01:59:38,018 --> 01:59:39,311
C'mon, I'll help you up.

1369
02:00:11,924 --> 02:00:13,625
You didn't see that coming.

1370
02:01:09,871 --> 02:01:11,368
Oh, for god's sake...!

1371
02:01:28,761 --> 02:01:30,061
Costel!

1372
02:01:41,938 --> 02:01:43,162
No, no.  I'm fine.

1373
02:01:46,445 --> 02:01:47,874
But it's been a long day.

1374
02:02:02,995 --> 02:02:03,995
Wanda.

1375
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,973
If you stay here, you'll die.

1376
02:02:09,299 --> 02:02:10,499
I just did.

1377
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:12,999
Do you know how it felt?

1378
02:02:27,547 --> 02:02:28,971
It felt like that.

1379
02:03:04,458 --> 02:03:05,914
Thor, on my mark.

1380
02:03:21,771 --> 02:03:22,971
Now!

1381
02:03:50,151 --> 02:03:51,351
Hey big guy.

1382
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:53,570
We did it.

1383
02:03:53,835 --> 02:03:55,196
The job's finished.

1384
02:03:56,072 --> 02:03:58,872
Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay?

1385
02:04:03,248 --> 02:04:07,817
We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out.

1386
02:04:08,749 --> 02:04:09,769
I need you t...

1387
02:04:41,488 --> 02:04:42,488
Oh, dear.

1388
02:04:54,596 --> 02:04:55,596
You're afraid.

1389
02:04:56,730 --> 02:04:59,430
- Of you?
- Of death.

1390
02:05:00,070 --> 02:05:01,431
You're the last one.

1391
02:05:02,464 --> 02:05:04,913
You were supposed to be the last.

1392
02:05:04,938 --> 02:05:08,939
Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.

1393
02:05:10,078 --> 02:05:12,595
I suppose we're both disappointments.

1394
02:05:12,647 --> 02:05:15,847
Ha ha ha ha.  I suppose we are.

1395
02:05:16,788 --> 02:05:17,888
Humans are odd.

1396
02:05:19,987 --> 02:05:23,592
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and

1397
02:05:25,325 --> 02:05:27,298
try to control what won't be.

1398
02:05:28,332 --> 02:05:30,849
But there is grace in their failings.

1399
02:05:31,219 --> 02:05:32,852
I think you missed that.

1400
02:05:33,835 --> 02:05:34,855
They're doomed.

1401
02:05:35,939 --> 02:05:36,939
Yes.

1402
02:05:40,642 --> 02:05:43,847
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1403
02:05:45,899 --> 02:05:48,212
It's a privilege to be among them.

1404
02:05:48,549 --> 02:05:50,182
You're unbearably naive.

1405
02:05:51,421 --> 02:05:52,458
Well,

1406
02:05:54,122 --> 02:05:55,551
I was born yesterday.

1407
02:06:50,954 --> 02:06:51,954
(chatter)

1408
02:07:09,036 --> 02:07:10,465
Say hi to Auntie Nat.

1409
02:07:12,233 --> 02:07:13,233
Fat.

1410
02:07:14,307 --> 02:07:18,797
One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea,

1411
02:07:20,844 --> 02:07:26,766
could be the Quinjet.  But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.

1412
02:07:26,783 --> 02:07:27,783
Right.

1413
02:07:28,984 --> 02:07:31,433
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1414
02:07:32,122 --> 02:07:33,619
He'll send a postcard.

1415
02:07:34,558 --> 02:07:35,851
"Wish you were here."

1416
02:07:38,130 --> 02:07:40,987
You sent me to recruit him, way back when.

1417
02:07:42,430 --> 02:07:45,355
Did you know then what was going to happen?

1418
02:07:47,773 --> 02:07:52,603
You never know.  You hope for the best and make do with what you get.

1419
02:07:54,209 --> 02:07:55,502
I got a great team.

1420
02:07:56,546 --> 02:07:58,043
Nothing lasts forever.

1421
02:07:59,148 --> 02:08:04,658
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.  No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes 'round.

1422
02:08:09,023 --> 02:08:11,169
- The rules have changed.
- We're dealing with something new.

1423
02:08:11,261 --> 02:08:14,317
- Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.
- A machine.

1424
02:08:14,797 --> 02:08:17,599
- So it doesn't count.
- No.  It's not, like, a person lifting the hammer.

1425
02:08:17,697 --> 02:08:20,297
- Right.  Different rules for us.
- Nice guy.  But artificial.
- Thank you.

1426
02:08:20,471 --> 02:08:24,008
If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.

1427
02:08:24,139 --> 02:08:25,908
It's safe with the Vision.

1428
02:08:26,141 --> 02:08:28,862
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1429
02:08:31,183 --> 02:08:35,346
- But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1430
02:08:35,386 --> 02:08:36,671
I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.

1431
02:08:36,751 --> 02:08:38,316
Not if you don't leave.

1432
02:08:38,554 --> 02:08:39,710
I have no choice.

1433
02:08:40,453 --> 02:08:46,636
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years.  It's not a coincidence.

1434
02:08:47,332 --> 02:08:50,232
Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us.

1435
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:53,887
- Once all these pieces are in position...
- Triple Yahtzee?

1436
02:08:53,938 --> 02:08:55,627
You think you can find out what's coming?

1437
02:08:55,674 --> 02:08:56,674
I do.

1438
02:08:57,508 --> 02:09:01,454
Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.

1439
02:09:09,078 --> 02:09:12,071
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1440
02:09:14,458 --> 02:09:15,995
I'm gonna miss him though.

1441
02:09:16,094 --> 02:09:20,584
And you're gonna miss me.  There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1442
02:09:20,630 --> 02:09:22,127
I will miss you, Tony.

1443
02:09:22,933 --> 02:09:25,722
Yeah?  Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1444
02:09:27,237 --> 02:09:32,904
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm.  Hope nobody blows it up.

1445
02:09:32,974 --> 02:09:33,862
The simple life.

1446
02:09:33,908 --> 02:09:35,064
You'll get there one day.

1447
02:09:35,747 --> 02:09:43,847
I don't know.  Family, stability.  The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.

1448
02:09:45,157 --> 02:09:47,198
I think someone else came out.

1449
02:09:51,361 --> 02:09:52,361
You all right?

1450
02:09:53,862 --> 02:09:54,862
I'm home.

1451
02:10:04,009 --> 02:10:05,922
You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work?

1452
02:10:05,978 --> 02:10:08,631
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1453
02:10:08,679 --> 02:10:12,097
I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1454
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:13,120
How do we look?

1455
02:10:13,183 --> 02:10:15,971
- Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
- We've got some hitters.

1456
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:21,440
- They're good.  They're not a team.
- Let's beat 'em into shape.

1457
02:10:39,671 --> 02:10:41,471
Avengers...!

1458
02:10:41,685 --> 02:10:46,685
SPOILER COMING UP -

1459
02:10:46,722 --> 02:10:51,722
MID-CREDIT STINGER SCENE (missing from this video) -

1460
02:10:51,758 --> 02:10:58,758
A gold glove is shown stored inside a vault; the door to the vault opens.

1461
02:10:58,826 --> 02:11:05,826
Thanos puts his left hand into the gauntlet and raises it with a fist.

1462
02:11:05,902 --> 02:11:12,902
He says, "Fine.  I'll do it myself."

1463
02:11:12,974 --> 02:11:26,974
The gauntlet has 6 empty receptacles (5 knuckles & 1 back of the hand), presumably for Infinity Stones to be placed into in future movies.
