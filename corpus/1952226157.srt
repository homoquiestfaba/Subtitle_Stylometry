Hey, it's me.

I don't know if you're not
answering because, uh,

27
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,441
you're still at the funeral or because
you still don't wanna talk...

28

But, um, either way, I think you're, uh,

And you didn't need to give me shit

41
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,279
because I brought carnations, O.K?

42
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,411
I didn't get them
because I was cheap.

43

they were nice and,

45
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,958

any better, all right?

fucking flowers to begin with

360
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,997

that bush-broom mustache?

Who's that guy
that played "Magnum P.I."?

362
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,433
Tom Selleck.

363
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,493
Tom Selleck.

364
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,165
They call that a nut duster.

365
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:04,434
A nut duster?

366
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:05,406
Yeah, that's what...

367
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,910
It's a good little
slang term for that type

368
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:08,843
of bush-broom mustache.

369
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:12,406
She said, "This is for Carlos,"
and took off her shirt.

370
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,850
And my friend, Brendon,
was filming her the whole time.

371
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,717
Later on, we went to
the eighth grade dance

372
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:19,312
and she showed up
and had someone

373
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,914
get me to come out there

374
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,917

with nothing underneath.

to even smell the stuff again

380
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,944
because that's how long it takes
every cell of your body to...

381
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,677
You have one cell left in your body
that still didn't like tequila...

382
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,049
You go,
"Oh, I don't like it," whatever.

your heart muscles,

that... I have a, uh,

I have a coupon

440
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:56,396
Basically I wanted to find out
about enlisting your services.

00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,839

How was it killed?

446
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,458

450
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:29,496

uh, to intentionally...

452
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,637

You know, presumably,
uh, murder.

Well, technically,
that's not murder.

Intentionally or unintentionally,
animals are killed.

456

Only humans can be murdered.

457
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,117
And, of course,

458
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,786
only very important humans
can be assassinated.

459
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,796
Look, I'm gonna be straight with you.

460
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:58,665
It's unfortunate, but this is not
the kind of thing that I cover.

461
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,293
I deal with more traditional things:

462
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:03,772
surveillance, insurance fraud, whatnot.

463
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,569
I don't mean to sound callous,

464

my cup of tea.

00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:16,216
Well, I don't know if
this will make any, uh,

468
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,379
difference or not, but...

469
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,548
For what it's worth, I do have,

470
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:24,959
uh, a lead as to who I think

471
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:27,087
the culprit may be.

No, no.

496
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,642

For what it's worth...

533
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:14,946
I'm sorry, O.K?

None of your business.

He's not yours
and he never was.

574
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:29,094
I had him way
before I knew you.

575

O.K., so what happened to him?

576

or did something
really go wrong?

578
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:35,803
He's fine, O.K?

579
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,006
