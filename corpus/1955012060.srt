We have reason to believe you are
not who you say you are, Mr. Parker.

3
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:52,444
Your wife and son,

4
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,449
Mr. Leonard Turner, CIA.

5
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:08,894
I have men posted outside their
door, back in Virginia, United States.

6
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,965
Come again?

7
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:17,836
For you to get this close,
you must have friends,

8
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,642
informants, collaborators,
inside my organization.

9
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,779
I want their names.

10
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:49,968
Everybody?

11
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,811
You look so stupid with
that pen in your neck.

12
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,816
Don't ever threaten my family again.

13
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:49,928
Go for Robertson.

14
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,731
- <i>Get over to the house now.</i>
- What?

15
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,865
Get over to my house, see
if everybody's alright.

16
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:56,669
Get the... Just get the fuck
over there. Stop talking!

17
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:58,937
Absolutely. I'm on my way.

18
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:00,539
<i>Harry, get your mother</i>

19
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:02,807
<i>and get out of the house. Go. Now!</i>

20
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:05,044
- Dad?
- Get out of the house!

21
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:10,949
<i>Mom!</i>

22
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,952
<i>Dad, Dad, they shot Mom...</i>

23
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:17,489
Harry, focus. Go up to my bedroom, OK?

24
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:21,393
In the top drawer of my
dresser, the left hand side...

25
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,629
- I'm here, Dad. I'm here.
- Open that up.

26
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:27,799
- OK.
- Just the way I showed you.

27
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:31,771
- <i>Focus.</i>
- Red means dead.

28
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,905
- <i>Red means dead.</i>
- He shot Mom!

29
00:04:33,938 --> 00:04:36,075
<i>Can you get to the bathroom? Go!</i>

30
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,177
- I'm here, Dad. I'm here.
- The kid!

31
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,879
I'll take him out.

32
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,848
- Dad, I hear them.
- <i>I know. I know, Harry!</i>

33
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,684
Harry!

34
00:04:45,717 --> 00:04:47,787
<i>Just aim along the sights, Harry.</i>

35
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,622
<i>Don't pull it. Just squeeze.</i>

36
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:50,756
Take the shot!

37
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,092
<i>Squeeze the trigger, Harry!</i>

38
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:54,160
<i>Take the shot!</i>

39
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:01,833
Harry. It's OK, kid.

40
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,737
It's OK.

41
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:09,409
<i>Leonard, I'm here. Harry's OK.</i>

42
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,123
Dad.

43
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,694
Not tonight, kid.

44
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,835
I'm joining the agency.

45
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:59,337
Got my letter today.

46
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:02,308
They're sending me to Prague.

47
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,353
Congratulations.

48
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:17,455
Yeah. Uncle Ken thinks it's a good idea.

49
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:21,793
Uncle Ken's full of ideas.

50
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:27,733
You still don't think I
can pull the trigger, huh?

51
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:34,674
- I was just a kid.
- Yeah.

52
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:51,356
Thanks for coming out today.

53
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:41,974
<i>Reset. Resetting simulation.</i>

54
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:45,745
You're killing friendlies!
Do it again! Get it right!

55
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:59,291
Again.

56
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:04,396
Come on.

57
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:23,448
Eyes down range. Acquire and fire.

58
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,883
Go!

59
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,263
Too slow. Do it again.

60
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:02,915
Even your old man never put shot
groups that tight down range.

61
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:05,383
Yeah, well...

62
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,451
...paper targets don't shoot back.

63
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:10,121
Spoken like a true Turner.

64
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:11,956
Come on, kid, you got a letter to open.

65
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:13,392
Regardless of what it says,

66
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,394
I hope you'll stick around
here until your work is done.

67
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:18,596
- The CONDOR...
- ...is the future, the tip of the spear,

68
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:21,933
the edge of the knife, the
cat's pajamas, whatever.

69
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:25,169
It's the cat's ass, wise guy.
Let me know which way it falls.

70
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,309
- Good morning, Harry.
- Good morning, Laura.

71
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,378
What's up, Harry?

72
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:38,683
- Is that what I think it is?
- You bet your ass it is, buddy.

73
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:41,652
Why do you keep doing this to yourself,
man? Four rejections in two years.

74
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,388
Three.

75
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:46,291
I know you wanna be a field
agent like your dad. I get that.

76
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,727
Now, I've only read your
dad's dossier and case file,

77
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,361
I wanna be your dad.

78
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:53,664
Hell, I wanna fuck your dad.

79
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:56,701
- That's gross.
- I've thought about it.

80
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:19,657
Four.

81
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,060
Four?

82
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:25,229
Four rejections in two years.

83
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,636
Yeah.

84
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:44,549
It's not enough, Harry.

85
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:46,417
We have a working prototype of the CONDOR

86
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,420
being shipped to the
United States as we speak.

87
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,555
And proof of at least a dozen
encrypted messages from overseas

88
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,761
to the United States discussing
the sale of a "rare precious bird."

89
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,428
That's not enough?

90
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:00,064
Look, I'm on plane to
Langley in a half an hour.

91
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:03,101
In the meantime, find me
some mention of the CONDOR,

92
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,171
or how they plan to
acquire this "rare bird".

93
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:09,708
Hell, find me the origin and/or
destination of said transmissions,

94
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,242
and I'll run it up the chain ASAP.

95
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,712
In the meantime, we got nothing.

96
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,215
What did your letter say?

97
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,489
It's gonna happen, Harry.

98
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:26,224
At this point, I'm not so sure.

99
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:28,426
You tell the old man you didn't get in?

100
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,128
Nah.

101
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,698
I'm sure he's probably busy
doing something right now.

102
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,209
- This it?
- Yep.

103
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,345
I thought it'd look different.

104
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:50,148
Welcome to the 21st Century.

105
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:53,484
You telling me the truth?

106
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:55,821
We weren't followed. Nobody.

107
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,643
Harry!

108
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:21,479
Harry! Harry!

109
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,148
Harry. It's your dad.

110
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:27,152
It's your dad, You just got a
call. Come on! It's your dad.

111
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:28,520
Listen up, kids.

112
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:31,822
I want a full stop on
every other goddamn op.

113
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,258
This gets full priority.

114
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,460
- Director Sitterson
- Oh, Jesus...

115
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,696
We're gonna do everything we
can to get your father back, son.

116
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,330
Sir, with your permission,
I'd like to be in the room.

117
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,398
Negative. You're too
close to the situation.

118
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,335
Judgement gets all
cloudy when you're close.

119
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,737
- Sir...
- Go home, son, alright?

120
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,273
We'll contact you the minute we got
an update on your father's situation.

121
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:51,844
- He doesn't come inside.
- Copy that, sir.

122
00:16:57,415 --> 00:17:00,719
I want this room shut down until
this situation is fully resolved.

123
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:01,820
Already on it, sir.

124
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,922
Alright. Where's Robertson?

125
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:06,625
In Langley. We have him
covering our stateside drop.

126
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,693
I don't give a hot wet shit about his drop.

127
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:10,896
- Get him on screen one.
- Yes, sir.

128
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:13,431
Now!

129
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:21,505
At this point we don't know much,

130
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,808
except that the drop was compromised

131
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,242
and the bird went with him.

132
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:25,810
My sources tell me Leonard Turner's still

133
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:27,711
in and around the Jersey area...

134
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,513
I'm sorry gentlemen. Mr. Robertson,
you're needed immediately.

135
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:31,182
- Where?
- In the conference link.

136
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:33,484
- Sitterson is waiting.
- OK, Purvis, keep digging.

137
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,319
I'm on it, sir.

138
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:41,193
Dude, this is crazy.

139
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:42,561
You do it all the time, Darryl.

140
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:43,961
Yeah, on like Czech porn stars' phones,

141
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:45,763
not on high-ranking CIA officials.

142
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:47,532
It's for my dad.

143
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,936
I've got Robertson.

144
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,773
- Oh. Hey, Ken.
- <i>Sitterson.</i>

145
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,707
Higgins, from the top.

146
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,544
Leonard Turner, former
clandestine service officer

147
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:03,715
and field operative, went missing
this morning in Newark, New Jersey.

148
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:04,915
You're in.

149
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:06,784
- <i>You said "former."</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

150
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:09,753
<i>They pulled him from the
field due to his antics,</i>

151
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:10,955
he was three weeks before retirement.

152
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:12,456
What the hell was he doing

153
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,893
in Newark, New Jersey,
on a Level 1 assignment?

154
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,962
<i>I can answer that.</i>

155
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:19,296
Good. Please, Ken. Enlighten us.

156
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,698
Leonard and I go way back.

157
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,434
<i>I knew the Agency was
looking to railroad him.</i>

158
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:23,868
<i>I also knew retirement
would kill him.</i>

159
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,536
<i>So I gave him one last
shot at field work,</i>

160
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,672
<i>and I requested his participation.</i>

161
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,340
In order to...?

162
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:31,442
<i>In order to secure
the CONDOR prototype,</i>

163
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:33,844
<i>and escort it back to
DARPA HQ in Arlington.</i>

164
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:37,415
<i>When he didn't report in, I initiated
the protocol for a missing agent.</i>

165
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:39,516
So you...

166
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,723
So, you sent a washed-up, skid mark
of an agent to secure the CONDOR?

167
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:47,324
<i>That "skid mark", nice term
of endearment, by the way,</i>

168
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:50,695
<i>is the best goddamn field operative
the agency's ever produced.</i>

169
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,263
Oh, yeah, apparently not.

170
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,665
- <i>OK. Continue Higgins.</i>
- <i>Approximately,</i>

171
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:59,937
Sixty minutes after Agent Turner
went missing, the CONDOR went active.

172
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:03,008
OK. So, for those of us who didn't grow up

173
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,577
jerking off to some science magazine,

174
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:06,777
can you please explain to me

175
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,913
the significance of this latest revelation?

176
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:11,382
<i>In layman's terms,
Director Sitterson,</i>

177
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,386
<i>the CONDOR is the ultimate
hack, allowing whoever has it,</i>

178
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:17,589
<i>complete control over any
government's major communications.</i>

179
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:18,989
How long do we have?

180
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,059
Twenty-four hours from the
moment CONDOR goes active.

181
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:23,494
Why 24 hours?

182
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:24,996
Hey, you can't be in here.

183
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,931
Because it takes 24 hours
for the CONDOR to go active

184
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:28,433
and hack all the programs.

185
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,334
That's Internet, nuclear platforms, GPS...

186
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:32,337
OK. He can stay.

187
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:36,675
How did you do that?

188
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,612
A smart boy.

189
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:45,082
We'll talk about this later on.

190
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:46,084
What's the fallout?

191
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,819
<i>If the CONDOR comes online</i>

192
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,019
<i>and the government's
affected trace it back to us,</i>

193
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:50,821
<i>at best, we lose their trust.</i>

194
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:55,026
- At worst?
- They see it as an act of war.

195
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,963
Look, is there any way
to reverse the activation?

196
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:01,099
<i>Yes. My team developed
a Patriarch Key.</i>

197
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:03,634
<i>It'll decompile the entire system,</i>

198
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,437
<i>but it has to be physically
uploaded onto the CONDOR.</i>

199
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,772
<i>Cannot be done remotely.</i>

200
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:10,475
Alright. Get me this Patriarch Key,

201
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:14,378
and I'll ensure that it gets hand-delivered
to our lead agent who's already on the ground.

202
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:17,047
Agent, sir? As in singular?

203
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,718
This gets out it's a PR
nightmare for the agency.

204
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:24,121
The way it is now, technically,
it's FBI jurisdiction,

205
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:26,925
which we are not so
subtly pissing all over.

206
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:30,427
It's just better that we keep
as low a profile as possible.

207
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:34,099
Alright, this is a
need-to-know basis, alright,

208
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:37,369
so none of this goes out
of this room. Understood?

209
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:38,736
Yes, sir.

210
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,138
- Understood? Thank you.
- Yes, sir!

211
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:43,874
- Any leads at the moment?
- None.

212
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:46,144
- One.
- What's this?

213
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:50,080
It's a starting point. I brought some of
this stuff to Agent Robertson a few days ago.

214
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:52,649
He said it wasn't enough to
make a case. So I dove back in.

215
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:55,453
I did a comprehensive search
of any suspected terrorists,

216
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:58,956
black market dealers entering the
United States in the past 72 hours,

217
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,926
- and I came up with this.
- The Ciocan?

218
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,529
Mm, remnants of the Bucharest's
dissolved Camataru Clan.

219
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:07,631
Now, they've been on our radar since '07.

220
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:12,404
They have a small faction operating
in the southeastern United States.

221
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:15,506
We have a positive ID on Drake

222
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,076
entering the US via Hartsfield
Jackson two days ago.

223
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,878
There's also been a number of coded
messages originating in Bucharest,

224
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:23,046
talking about the sale of a "rare bird",

225
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,550
which I assume is code for the CONDOR.

226
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:28,686
<i>As I told Agent Turner, sir,
this is largely circumstantial.</i>

227
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:32,990
Yeah. Well, still, it's the
only lead we have at the moment.

228
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:36,127
Alright. We'll take it
from here, Agent Turner.

229
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,630
Agent Higgins, would you escort
Agent Turner to his apartment

230
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:42,467
- and see that he stays there?
- Sir, I wanna be a part of this.

231
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,469
You wanna be allowed to
go stateside immediately.

232
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:47,105
- Yes, sir.
- Well, your request is denied.

233
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:50,507
Look, your goal is to get your father back.

234
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,944
My goal is to protect the free world.

235
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:55,612
I can't have your personal
agenda jeopardizing the mission.

236
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:58,582
Those goals, director, are one in the same.

237
00:21:58,616 --> 00:21:59,884
Time's up, kid. Let's go.

238
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,453
All right, don't worry.

239
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:02,686
Now, we're gonna call
you the minute we have

240
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,156
any information about your father.

241
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,926
<i>Who's the agent on ground?</i>

242
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:12,030
Agent Victoria Phair.

243
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:37,155
Welcome to Newark, New Jersey.

244
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:44,561
You've been briefed?

245
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:46,730
I know the what. I don't know the who.

246
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:05,250
Is there a problem, Agent Phair?

247
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:09,521
No, no problem.

248
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:12,890
I just think you should know I
have history with Turner's son.

249
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,260
I wouldn't exactly call

250
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,293
"fucking while you were at the Academy"

251
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:18,229
a relationship, Agent Phair.

252
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:21,566
The Agency is fully aware
of your "relationship"

253
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,534
with Leonard Turner's son.

254
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,104
That plus the fact that
you've lived in Jersey,

255
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:29,974
went to college here, and have an
exemplary track record in the field to date,

256
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:34,611
you have the perfect alibi to be
operating in and around the area.

257
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,915
Now I'm sure I don't need to
reiterate how important it is

258
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:41,018
for a CIA operative to not get
caught operating on domestic soil.

259
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:44,923
It would be a shitstorm of
epic proportions if the FBI,

260
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:47,190
or any other three-letter acronym,

261
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:52,931
were to discover your presence here as
anything other than a friendly familial visit.

262
00:23:54,764 --> 00:23:56,734
I'm guessing this is the Patriarch Key?

263
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:00,972
Correct. Now, according to Sitterson,

264
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:03,808
you install it directly into the CONDOR.

265
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,646
It is the only way to stop the
program once it's been activated.

266
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,218
Anything else?

267
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:57,362
Harry, I'm sorry about
the way this is going down.

268
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,798
Me too.

269
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:17,314
Hold him down!

270
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:20,051
You've got... to fucking... chill!

271
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:39,370
Son of a...

272
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:11,234
How the hell does a
pencil-pushing desk jockey

273
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,737
take out four highly-trained agents?

274
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,840
<i>Harry Turner's been
training to be an agent</i>

275
00:26:15,872 --> 00:26:17,808
<i>since the day his
mother was murdered.</i>

276
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,455
<i>I'm looking at this guy's file,</i>

277
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:36,793
<i>and it says he was passed over for
clandestine service... four times.</i>

278
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:40,064
But... I don't know how
"high-speed" he can be.

279
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:41,999
<i>The only reason he's
not a field agent yet</i>

280
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,836
<i>is because his father's been
calling in favors for years,</i>

281
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,972
<i>getting senior leadership
to deny his applications.</i>

282
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:49,174
<i>He's good.</i>

283
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:08,292
- What you got?
- <i>First and foremost, watch your ass.</i>

284
00:27:08,324 --> 00:27:09,326
<i>Sitterson's gunning for you.</i>

285
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,527
and Higgins is pissed.

286
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,096
Hard to blame him.

287
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:14,165
<i>I tapped into the
Police Department files,</i>

288
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:17,067
<i>then called in a few favors
to a buddy of mine in the ATF.</i>

289
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:21,004
And the Ciocan use a local
biker gang to run guns and meth

290
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:22,440
<i>up and down the coast.</i>

291
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:25,376
The Infidel Motorcycle Club.

292
00:27:25,408 --> 00:27:27,011
Guess they have a place
called the Garage Bar.

293
00:27:27,043 --> 00:27:29,546
<i>Wonder if they have ladies night?</i>

294
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,983
- Thanks, Darryl.
- <i>Yeah. Anytime, buddy.</i>

295
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,415
Whiskey.

296
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,992
We don't know you, brother.

297
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:51,196
We don't like people coming
in here that we don't know.

298
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,173
Are you listening to me, dick-brain?

299
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:09,246
That's way too much, babe.

300
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,514
That's for the bottle and the jukebox.

301
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:13,351
- Fuck this guy.
- Jukebox?

302
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,632
I'm looking for Drake Chivu.

303
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:32,436
You tell me where he is,
and I walk on out of here.

304
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:34,872
Let's kill this mother fucker!

305
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:02,466
And stay out!

306
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,531
Put the gun down.

307
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:36,033
Well, shit!

308
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:39,270
I missed you, too.

309
00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:42,039
Let him up!

310
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:53,283
Alright everyone. I'd like to
thank you for your cooperation.

311
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:55,520
Harry, let's go.

312
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,356
Not yet.

313
00:30:58,388 --> 00:31:01,059
I swear to god, Harry.

314
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:05,329
- Harry.
- I said not yet!

315
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:11,202
Now, we are gonna try
this a whole another way.

316
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,472
Put down the grenade!

317
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:16,040
Vic, you should wait outside.

318
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:19,442
- I'm not waiting outside.
- Vic, wait outside!

319
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:21,177
It's Victoria.

320
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:24,515
- Vic, will you wait outside?
- Fuck off.

321
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:25,616
Fuck off, huh?

322
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:28,185
Wait!

323
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:31,054
Drake's brother's got a
mechanic shop over at Patterson.

324
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:33,791
His name's Vinn. We get
all our orders from him.

325
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:36,060
We never talk to Drake directly.

326
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:37,360
I swear.

327
00:31:37,394 --> 00:31:39,564
What's the name of the shop?

328
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:42,600
A-1 Mechanic.

329
00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:48,005
Now was that so hard?

330
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:56,013
Who owns the Fat Boy outside?

331
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,186
Give 'em here.

332
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:08,426
Alright. Let's do this.

333
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:28,512
- Sir?
- Yeah?

334
00:32:28,544 --> 00:32:32,449
Harry Turner just trashed a
Newark, New Jersey biker bar.

335
00:32:32,882 --> 00:32:34,684
Oh, great!

336
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:37,787
It seems Agent Harry
Turner has just trashed

337
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:40,791
a Newark, New Jersey biker bar.

338
00:32:40,823 --> 00:32:44,360
OK. Check in with Agent Phair immediately,

339
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:48,232
- and prep an asset.
- <i>An assassin?</i>

340
00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:50,266
Jesus Sitterson, don't walk the deep end!

341
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,137
I didn't say activate. I said prep.

342
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:55,505
Come on. Look, I need a safeguard in place,

343
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:58,309
in case I can't rein in baby Turner.

344
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,850
<i>I was instructed to put you on
the first flight back to Prague.</i>

345
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:10,187
- Did they say when?
- Immediately.

346
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:12,555
Immediately? That can mean
a lot of different things.

347
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:18,195
Hm. I'm pretty sure "immediately"
means right fucking now.

348
00:33:18,227 --> 00:33:21,631
Well, you know, time's gonna be tight.

349
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:24,534
I have to save my dad, save the world,

350
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:28,239
and I just have a feeling we are
not gonna make that next flight.

351
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:35,412
Well, shit, Vic.

352
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:40,417
I'm not going just yet.

353
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:43,586
Look, the CONDOR goes live in 16 hours.

354
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,723
So give me 16 hours.

355
00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:47,791
Then you can take me
back to Prague, Langley,

356
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:49,859
whatever the fuck you wanna take me.

357
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:51,461
I give you my word.

358
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:56,266
We find the CONDOR, shut it
down with the Patriarch Key,

359
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,369
and if you find your dad, great.

360
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:02,273
Then you're on the next flight back
with me to Prague. Do you understand?

361
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:05,441
- Are we clear?
- Crystal.

362
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:06,676
Grab your helmet.

363
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:41,512
Mr. Turner... we need the Patriarch Key.

364
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:47,618
Get him ready.

365
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,425
Understood, sir.

366
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:57,328
I'm still running down the Ciocan.

367
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,565
Agent Harry Turner?

368
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:03,933
I lost him at the bar, but, don't worry.

369
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,436
I'm sure I'll be running into him shortly.

370
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,543
Yes, sir. Immediately.

371
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:14,811
I'll let him know when I see him.

372
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:21,551
Do not make me regret this.

373
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:23,987
Oh, my God, can you hurry
up? I don't have all night.

374
00:35:27,623 --> 00:35:28,993
Hey, what's going on? What you doing?

375
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,860
- You should go.
- OK.

376
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:33,029
We got business.

377
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:35,465
I don't fucking know you. What business?

378
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:37,600
- You know her?
- Really?

379
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:40,605
What do you think I'm trying to
do? I'm trying to get to know her.

380
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,556
Really?

381
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:07,564
Vinn... Vinn... Vinn...

382
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,335
Where is your brother?

383
00:36:12,868 --> 00:36:14,337
What brother?

384
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:17,008
I have a lot of brothers.

385
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,710
- Drake.
- Fuck you!

386
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,784
Now, Vinn, we need to
help each other out here.

387
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,485
You see, I need an answer to my question.

388
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:33,656
And you need to not
get your face blown off.

389
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,028
Now, where... is... your... brother?

390
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:45,402
- God!
- Turner!

391
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:47,771
Goddamn!

392
00:36:47,804 --> 00:36:49,039
Ah!

393
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:50,040
Turner!

394
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:53,844
- One left, Vinn.
- Turner, stop!

395
00:36:53,877 --> 00:36:57,480
I'm gonna see him... I'm gonna
see him tonight, goddammit!

396
00:36:57,514 --> 00:37:00,918
- Where?
- The Lodge. The fucking Lodge!

397
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:02,519
The Lodge.

398
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:03,821
I know it.

399
00:37:03,853 --> 00:37:06,991
It's a swanky nightclub
downtown. Now, let's go.

400
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:16,432
<i>So how swanky is the Lodge?</i>

401
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:19,902
<i>A VIP guest list. It's almost
impossible to pay to get in.</i>

402
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:23,740
If you're gonna be a part of this,
this cowboy bullshit has got to stop.

403
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:25,409
It worked, didn't it?

404
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:31,848
Can you get us into the Lodge or not?

405
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:37,654
I can't. But I know who can.

406
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,928
You guys are gonna love it there.
It's the hottest club I know.

407
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:48,564
Oh, there it is!

408
00:37:48,598 --> 00:37:50,801
Here. Put this on.

409
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:54,504
- No.
- This is no time to be modest, V.

410
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,907
- Don't you have a pants suit?
- Stop objecting,

411
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,777
take it and put it on.
You're gonna thank me later.

412
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:07,784
Thank you. And you.

413
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:09,185
Actually, you look pretty good.

414
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:13,424
Maybe just a little product in the hair.

415
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:16,192
<i>Tres magnifique</i> and awesome, bro!

416
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:20,598
Oh, and you gotta lose
the white boy hoodie. No.

417
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,935
Sir, we just received this.

418
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,940
<i>My name is Leonard Turner.</i>

419
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:33,677
<i>I am an agent with the
Central Intelligence Agency,</i>

420
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,781
<i>and I have been taken
hostage by Al-dawla Sayyaf.</i>

421
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:39,917
<i>In approximately 14 hours,</i>

422
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:43,186
<i>the CONDOR will go live
and Al-dawla Sayyaf</i>

423
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:47,457
<i>will have control over the
world's telecommunications.</i>

424
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,761
<i>This message will be
followed by their demands.</i>

425
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:53,730
<i>If those demands
are not met in time,</i>

426
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:56,532
<i>all missile silos will be activated</i>

427
00:38:56,565 --> 00:39:02,572
<i>with coordinates set in the
continental United States.</i>

428
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,078
<i>The demands are as follows...</i>

429
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,879
Pause it.

430
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:17,521
Hey! You.

431
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:20,123
No peek-sies.

432
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:22,159
Nothing he hasn't seen before.

433
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:26,663
- Really? You two?
- Ancient history, Kris.

434
00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:29,632
Well, don't stop there, slut.
Tell me more. Tell me more.

435
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:33,937
- Well, I was assigned to the field.
- And I wasn't.

436
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:38,976
Well, maybe this is your second chance.

437
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:52,822
Wow!

438
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:54,657
Damn, I'm good

439
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,225
I'm about to go get myself ready.

440
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:58,962
I can't have you stealing all
the attention from the boys.

441
00:39:58,994 --> 00:40:01,931
Hey, and that dress stays
on while I'm gone, hero.

442
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:03,233
No handsies.

443
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:08,005
Can you help?

444
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,888
This totes reminds me of...

445
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,824
- Williamsburg.
- Yeah.

446
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:36,600
We were good together, weren't we?

447
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:39,102
When we were together.

448
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:42,539
When we weren't, we weren't.

449
00:40:44,174 --> 00:40:46,076
It got complicated.

450
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,982
I like complicated. Easy's boring.

451
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,054
- Do you ever think...
- Always.

452
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:12,099
We should focus.

453
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,057
- <i>Where are you, kid?</i>
- Standing outside some nightclub downtown.

454
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:35,992
Probably not the best
time to go dancing, Harry.

455
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:38,228
- I know where Drake is.
- <i>Listen to me, kid.</i>

456
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:41,665
It's not Drake. It's not the
Ciocan. It's Al-dawla Sayyaf.

457
00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:45,167
- No, that...
- I just watched the tape with my own fucking eyes.

458
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:48,138
Now, listen to me. For
your sake, for your dad's,

459
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,741
for mine, for Pete's sake, stand down!

460
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:55,645
- Ken...
- Stand down, Harry!

461
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:00,917
So I just spoke with Higgins and he...

462
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:03,419
- Al-dawla Sayyaf?
- Yeah.

463
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:06,223
That's bullshit.

464
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:08,658
Think it's a misdirect?

465
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,894
Only one way to find out.

466
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:15,198
OK, hey! You're both in! Come on!

467
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:21,038
In case we get separated.

468
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:28,178
So what's the plan?

469
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:32,748
Get inside. Find Drake.

470
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:33,984
Ask him where my dad is.

471
00:42:34,016 --> 00:42:36,052
So the plan is you have no plan.

472
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:38,121
Works in the movies.

473
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:40,391
You're ridiculous.

474
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:46,030
Stick with me, kid. You
might learn something'.

475
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,936
<i>Sir, with your permission,
I'd like to head up to Jersey.</i>

476
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:55,272
<i>Something about this
whole Al-dawla Sayyaf</i>

477
00:42:55,304 --> 00:42:57,339
<i>just doesn't sit right with me.</i>

478
00:42:57,373 --> 00:43:01,011
Alright, fine. I'm
sending Higgins with you.

479
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:04,147
- <i>But, sir...</i>
- He's already in the air.

480
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:05,748
<i>Alright party people,
let's turn it up!</i>

481
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:19,128
No, no, no...

482
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:21,098
It's that he does not know when to quit.

483
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:27,371
Yeah. Let her through, goddammit.

484
00:43:36,411 --> 00:43:40,116
My father sent me to let you know, he's
really pleased doing business with you.

485
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,918
That's awesome.

486
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,154
How is your father? I
fucking love that guy.

487
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:47,424
Too many women, too much vodka.

488
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:51,994
So, seeing anyone these
last couple of years?

489
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:54,797
It's none of your business.

490
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:58,435
Hey, handsome, can I interest
you in a specialty cocktail?

491
00:43:58,467 --> 00:43:59,536
You want a shot?

492
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:01,505
- Uh, no.
- No?

493
00:44:04,406 --> 00:44:07,376
- Let me know if you need anything else.
- Thank you.

494
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:10,279
- Anything else.
- I just might do that.

495
00:44:20,389 --> 00:44:21,891
Make some room, please.

496
00:44:24,293 --> 00:44:26,996
Tell your father our
relationship is in good standing.

497
00:44:27,029 --> 00:44:28,865
I'll let him know.

498
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:38,509
There he is.

499
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:03,200
Stop smiling.

500
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:07,970
Kris. Remember New Orleans?

501
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:10,072
Oh! Who are we seducing?

502
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,878
Him? Really?

503
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:17,414
You always did have a weird taste.

504
00:45:33,328 --> 00:45:36,498
Uncool, Ms. Phair. Uncool.

505
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:38,868
Don't be jelly, Turner.

506
00:45:59,054 --> 00:46:02,524
- What's your name, beautiful?
- What?

507
00:46:02,558 --> 00:46:05,362
Jesus, fucking crazy wasted.

508
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,931
What's your name?

509
00:46:07,964 --> 00:46:09,331
Whatever you want it to be, babe.

510
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:12,067
Heather. I like Heather.

511
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:15,605
That's my mom's name.

512
00:46:15,638 --> 00:46:18,507
- Mm.
- Can I have... some more?

513
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,010
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

514
00:46:27,382 --> 00:46:29,418
So, Heather?

515
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:32,255
You like to kiss both men and women?

516
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:35,492
I can't hear you.

517
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:38,595
Can we go somewhere private possibly?

518
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:41,431
Absolutely.

519
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,469
Please show this lovely
lady to the private room.

520
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:48,605
Private room...

521
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,976
Thank you, sir.

522
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:06,255
Get the fuck out.

523
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,359
You too, princess.

524
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:19,402
I've always wanted to try this.

525
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:22,171
Yeah? Well, don't break it.

526
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,077
I'm in this asshole's pussy palace.

527
00:47:29,478 --> 00:47:32,581
Jesus. You just call
me if you're in trouble.

528
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:47,464
Uh-huh. I'm glad you
came back here with me.

529
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:49,264
People say I'm dangerous,
I don't know what it is.

530
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:51,066
I think it's the fucking hair.

531
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,471
I like your hair. I like
a little danger, too.

532
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:01,345
Oh, shit!

533
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:05,581
Yeah.

534
00:48:05,614 --> 00:48:08,051
<i>Harry, there's a wet
work order out on you.</i>

535
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:11,754
<i>Did you hear me? You've been
targeted for assassination.</i>

536
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,326
- How long?
- <i>The asset's en route.</i>

537
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:20,196
Thanks, Darryl.

538
00:48:34,243 --> 00:48:36,478
I really have to go to the ladies room.

539
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:39,248
You're not going anywhere.

540
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,638
I have it within my power to level nations.

541
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:04,406
Think one little bitch from the
CIA will pose much of a threat, huh?

542
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,342
Agent Victoria Phair.

543
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:22,225
Fuck!

544
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:27,197
- <i>Harry. Harry, help!</i>
- On my way!

545
00:49:28,663 --> 00:49:32,134
- You fucked up, bitch.
- Fuck you!

546
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:35,638
Get the fuck up! Get up!
Pick up your legs! Move!

547
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,741
Move! Come on! Come on!

548
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,147
It's a shame really. We're out of time.

549
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:19,715
I was looking forward to seeing
how far you were willing to go.

550
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:23,252
Don't think so.

551
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:30,627
I got it.

552
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:56,953
- I had him.
- Oh, you are so male right now.

553
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:58,522
Come on.

554
00:51:00,822 --> 00:51:02,591
Stay down!

555
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:11,500
That's enough! That's enough!

556
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:13,836
I don't know who this
kung fu cock sucker is,

557
00:51:13,868 --> 00:51:15,871
but get him the fuck out of here!

558
00:51:16,938 --> 00:51:18,774
And none of you, dumb fucks talk shit!

559
00:51:18,808 --> 00:51:22,911
Walk bitch. Walk! Faster!

560
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,337
Where's your car? Where's your car?!

561
00:51:51,373 --> 00:51:55,344
Let's go. Hit it.

562
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,590
- How well do you know Jersey?
- Huh?

563
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:12,596
Forget it. Can you go any faster?

564
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,946
Pick-up, you dumb motherfucker.

565
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:31,848
Have you talked to my brother?

566
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,051
<i>What the fuck are you laughing at?</i>

567
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,386
Motherfucker!

568
00:52:36,418 --> 00:52:37,987
Abraham Lincoln Elementary.

569
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,290
Abraham Lincoln Elementary!

570
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:44,027
Oh, I went there for a
year. It was kind of cool.

571
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,630
- Oh, go there! I got you!
- Go!

572
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:58,675
<i>I love this drive-thru.
Anyone up for a taco?</i>

573
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,610
- Drive-thru. Tacos?
- Which one?

574
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:03,612
- How many are there?
- There's like four or five!

575
00:53:03,645 --> 00:53:07,417
- Fuck!
- But the only one with a drive-thru is on Tennessee.

576
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:09,652
Go! Go! Tennessee.

577
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,457
Kris, this is a one-way!

578
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:16,859
Kris!

579
00:53:17,993 --> 00:53:19,862
Shit!

580
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:21,496
Whoa, that was close.

581
00:53:21,529 --> 00:53:24,366
Kris, you're crazy.

582
00:53:26,402 --> 00:53:27,770
Where are we going?

583
00:53:27,802 --> 00:53:30,639
Well, if I told you, I'd
have to kill you, which,

584
00:53:30,672 --> 00:53:34,677
full disclosure, I would
love nothing more. But, ah...

585
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:38,447
Sorry about your face.

586
00:53:52,627 --> 00:53:55,064
There they are. There they are!

587
00:54:25,927 --> 00:54:29,598
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

588
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,793
OK. So, what do you want me to do?

589
00:55:31,826 --> 00:55:33,495
Alright, look.

590
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:35,231
If you don't hear from me in an hour

591
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:37,667
call Robertson at this number.

592
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,070
- You got it?
- Got it.

593
00:55:41,103 --> 00:55:43,606
So, what do I do if he doesn't answer?

594
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:47,944
- Just stay in the car.
- OK.

595
00:55:47,976 --> 00:55:50,913
- Are you sure you don't want me to come in?
- Stay in the car!

596
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:52,114
OK.

597
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:40,864
Hey.

598
01:00:29,824 --> 01:00:33,428
Dad... Dad.

599
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:36,065
- Harry.
- Dad.

600
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:37,500
Are you alright?

601
01:00:37,532 --> 01:00:40,969
Yeah. Are you OK?

602
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:45,907
Does anyone know you're here?

603
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,476
Did you follow protocol?

604
01:00:48,509 --> 01:00:52,814
Dad... are you OK?

605
01:00:53,415 --> 01:00:55,951
Harry... focus.

606
01:00:57,319 --> 01:00:59,755
Does anyone know you're here?

607
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:04,327
No.

608
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,930
No one knows you're here?

609
01:01:10,331 --> 01:01:13,935
No. The last person I
spoke to was Uncle Ken.

610
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:20,343
Look, I'm sorry, Dad. I fucked up.

611
01:01:22,076 --> 01:01:26,448
No, son. You did everything you could.

612
01:01:27,415 --> 01:01:29,351
We're fine.

613
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:32,855
No one knows we're here.

614
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:45,868
Dad?

615
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:49,338
Give us a minute.

616
01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:58,113
I'm sorry about all this, Harry.

617
01:01:58,145 --> 01:02:00,181
What's going on, Dad?

618
01:02:00,214 --> 01:02:04,485
- Retaliation.
- I don't understand.

619
01:02:04,518 --> 01:02:07,322
Retaliation for your mother.

620
01:02:07,355 --> 01:02:09,926
What's this got to do with Mom?

621
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:19,134
The CIA leaked my cover.

622
01:02:24,005 --> 01:02:25,241
Correction...

623
01:02:27,275 --> 01:02:29,978
The CIA gave up my cover.

624
01:02:33,281 --> 01:02:35,450
Cost me your mother.

625
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:39,155
Almost cost me you.

626
01:02:43,257 --> 01:02:45,393
You stole the CONDOR.

627
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:48,430
As payback.

628
01:02:50,531 --> 01:02:53,902
So you're just gonna turn your
back on everything you stood for?

629
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:58,407
They turned their back on me first, Harry.

630
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:02,210
- Where's Victoria?
- She's here.

631
01:03:02,243 --> 01:03:03,979
I want to see her.

632
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,050
She is no longer your concern.

633
01:03:29,737 --> 01:03:31,674
Give me the Patriarch Key.

634
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,344
You're killing him.

635
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:41,284
The only thing Harry's
ever wanted in life...

636
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:43,953
...was to be like you.

637
01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:50,592
Give me the key.

638
01:04:04,438 --> 01:04:05,540
Bye.

639
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:23,359
Well, the buyers are here.

640
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:25,994
Send them in.

641
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,563
And bring my son up.

642
01:04:30,297 --> 01:04:32,267
He'll wanna see this.

643
01:04:33,268 --> 01:04:35,103
Goddammit.

644
01:04:44,779 --> 01:04:46,514
Fucking little bitch.

645
01:04:46,547 --> 01:04:48,283
Fuck off.

646
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:53,054
Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up!

647
01:04:53,087 --> 01:04:54,422
Yeah, yeah.

648
01:04:54,456 --> 01:04:56,392
This is a nice fucking jacket, brother.

649
01:04:56,424 --> 01:04:58,359
Where'd you get this jacket?

650
01:04:58,393 --> 01:05:00,696
Oh, you don't feel like talking much?

651
01:05:06,368 --> 01:05:08,170
Ivan!

652
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:16,210
This place like Russia, cold and wet.

653
01:05:16,243 --> 01:05:18,813
Very good for the skin,
that's what they say.

654
01:05:18,846 --> 01:05:22,551
Good skin is for hookers and potatoes.

655
01:05:24,652 --> 01:05:26,788
I hadn't thought of it that way.

656
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:32,395
As promised... the CONDOR.

657
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:38,700
- This is it?
- Yeah. This is it.

658
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:41,736
Demonstration, please.

659
01:06:07,194 --> 01:06:09,064
Goddamn, we're online!

660
01:06:12,433 --> 01:06:15,303
And it's done.

661
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:18,174
Half of China just lost cell reception.

662
01:06:27,348 --> 01:06:29,283
Sir, the CONDOR just activated.

663
01:06:29,317 --> 01:06:32,554
- What's its target?
- A Chinese telecommunications network.

664
01:06:32,587 --> 01:06:35,357
Son of a bitch!

665
01:06:37,692 --> 01:06:39,494
Guard!

666
01:06:40,194 --> 01:06:41,596
Guard!

667
01:06:44,398 --> 01:06:45,766
I have to go to the little girls' room.

668
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:47,368
So go in your fucking pants.

669
01:06:47,402 --> 01:06:50,106
You're not gonna really
let me hang here, are you?

670
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,440
Come here.

671
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:21,302
Pleasure doing business with you.

672
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,545
Don't do this.

673
01:07:35,516 --> 01:07:37,819
We've met before, you and I.

674
01:07:38,819 --> 01:07:40,321
Excuse me?

675
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:43,324
Not face-to-face. But
our paths have crossed.

676
01:07:43,357 --> 01:07:46,894
You sure? 'Cause I would remember.

677
01:07:46,927 --> 01:07:50,431
December 21st, 2004.

678
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:55,269
- Ring a bell?
- December...?

679
01:07:55,302 --> 01:07:58,174
No. I'm sorry, it doesn't.

680
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,210
It means everything to me.

681
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:04,179
To my son.

682
01:08:04,813 --> 01:08:06,281
Cause that is the day

683
01:08:06,313 --> 01:08:08,549
that you purchased my cover from CIA

684
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:11,453
and sold it to Dmitri Kovrov.

685
01:08:11,485 --> 01:08:13,989
The day you signed my
wife's death sentence.

686
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:18,928
- I did no such thing.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

687
01:08:21,495 --> 01:08:23,199
Drake.

688
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,745
Say her name.

689
01:08:39,013 --> 01:08:41,016
Say her name!

690
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:42,551
I don't know!

691
01:08:42,584 --> 01:08:46,422
I'll help you. Kate Turner!

692
01:08:47,454 --> 01:08:50,758
Kate... Kate... Turner!

693
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:53,562
Harry. Harry.

694
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:00,970
For your mother.

695
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:03,938
Finish it off.

696
01:09:03,972 --> 01:09:05,708
Fuck you.

697
01:09:10,844 --> 01:09:14,382
Fuck you, and your dead mother!

698
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:24,792
Alright...

699
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,572
Hands up!

700
01:09:39,106 --> 01:09:41,542
Higgins, put away your weapon.

701
01:09:41,575 --> 01:09:43,878
- Sir?
- Holster your weapon.

702
01:09:43,911 --> 01:09:46,380
Looks like you had a busy day.

703
01:09:46,414 --> 01:09:49,718
Higgins, put the CONDOR in the
car. Take it back to Prague.

704
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,719
Ken. Shut the fuck up.

705
01:09:51,753 --> 01:09:52,920
What the fuck are you doing, Leonard?

706
01:09:52,954 --> 01:09:54,822
Fuck if I know.

707
01:09:54,856 --> 01:09:57,860
Take a step back. Back the fuck up.

708
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:00,761
What the fuck are you talking about?

709
01:10:00,794 --> 01:10:03,764
You back away from the CONDOR,

710
01:10:03,798 --> 01:10:06,902
or I will blow a fucking round right
through your dumb fucking skull.

711
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:08,437
Do you understand?

712
01:10:12,941 --> 01:10:15,110
It didn't have to be like this, friend.

713
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:16,844
No. It was Sitterson.

714
01:10:16,878 --> 01:10:19,548
I tried to keep you out of
this, Harry. Lord knows I tried.

715
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:22,851
But you're a Turner thru
and thru. Stubborn as hell.

716
01:10:22,883 --> 01:10:24,118
Who put the hit on my kid?

717
01:10:24,151 --> 01:10:26,053
I didn't want to, but I had no choice.

718
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:27,856
I couldn't have him sabotaging

719
01:10:27,888 --> 01:10:30,057
everything I worked so
hard to put into motion.

720
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:31,660
But we could still save this.

721
01:10:31,692 --> 01:10:34,096
There's 150 million bucks in an account.

722
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:38,100
I take the CONDOR, we're
talking billions. Billions!

723
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,535
Step back.

724
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:42,471
Step... back.

725
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:43,972
Ken, you're a smart guy.

726
01:10:44,004 --> 01:10:46,775
You think anybody's walking
out of here with the CONDOR.

727
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:50,011
What are you waiting for?

728
01:10:50,044 --> 01:10:51,947
You broke the deal, Leonard.

729
01:10:53,815 --> 01:10:55,049
Dad?

730
01:11:00,888 --> 01:11:02,924
- Dad!
- Harry, get the CONDOR.

731
01:11:06,127 --> 01:11:08,030
Put the gun down.

732
01:11:09,062 --> 01:11:10,965
Fucking dead, bitch!

733
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,005
Stop him, Harry!

734
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:19,508
Ken!

735
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:26,548
You like diamonds, bitch?

736
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,836
Ken!

737
01:11:47,869 --> 01:11:50,472
You're tenacious, kid. I'll give you that!

738
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:22,558
Sorry...

739
01:14:34,835 --> 01:14:38,005
Dad! Dad! I got it!

740
01:14:45,012 --> 01:14:46,914
Let me lean you up.

741
01:14:53,254 --> 01:14:55,190
You're good.

742
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:31,453
- You ready?
- Let's roll.

743
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:32,888
Let's load up.

744
01:17:32,112 --> 01:17:35,415
- Purvis.
- Ms. Phair.

745
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:38,186
It's a pleasure to see you again.

746
01:17:39,219 --> 01:17:41,455
I really wasn't expecting you.

747
01:17:42,522 --> 01:17:44,292
I know.

748
01:17:57,538 --> 01:18:00,208
- Where are you?
- <i>In the office.</i>

749
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,075
It doesn't sound like the office.

750
01:18:02,109 --> 01:18:05,847
OK. Maybe I'm visiting an old friend.

751
01:18:05,879 --> 01:18:08,850
Are you gonna be able to
handle this one without me?

752
01:18:08,883 --> 01:18:12,253
Wait, you aren't coming?

753
01:18:12,285 --> 01:18:15,856
- Shit's about to get complicated.
- I like complicated.

754
01:18:15,889 --> 01:18:17,993
Easy's boring.

755
01:18:46,706 --> 01:18:51,706
