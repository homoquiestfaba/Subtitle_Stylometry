1
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:05,051
It's not a threat. I just can't do
my work under these circ...

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,965
You knew the drill
when you signed on.

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,931
This is the third planet where
I can't find decent clientele.

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:14,006
Sorry to cut into your retirement fund.
Would it kill you not to spread for a spell?

5
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:17,002
You are unreal.

6
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:20,122
I don't know why
I haven't left already.

7
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:22,523
Well, no one's forcing you to stay.

8
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,052
I'm a big girl, just tell me.

9
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,811
None of it means a damn thing.

10
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:56,968
This is just an object.

11
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,242
It doesn't mean what you think.

12
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:04,571
- You know that's not to be touched.
- Stop yelling at her.

13
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,247
River, I'm sure you
want nothing to do with that.

14
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:08,402
Put it down.

15
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:10,803
What were you thinking?
Where'd you get that?

16
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:14,204
- Don't yell at her.
- Just let me... Thank you.

17
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,086
Fully loaded, safety off.

18
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:22,166
This here is a recipe for unpleasantness.
Does she understand that?

19
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,250
She understands.

20
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:26,564
She doesn't comprehend.

21
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:30,245
I'm glad we've made that distinction.
No touching guns.

22
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,012
Okay?

23
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,085
No touching.

24
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:38,169
- River.
- It's getting very, very crowded!

25
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:40,569
I thought she was on the mend.

26
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,928
Her medications are erratic.

27
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:46,653
There's not one her system
can't eventually break down...

28
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:49,930
If I want a lot of medical jargon,
I'll talk to a doctor.

29
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:51,686
You are talking to a doctor.

30
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,122
Yeah. Okay. My point is...

31
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:57,761
...it could have been you she shot,
the doctor...

32
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:00,806
...as you just made note of.
And who, exactly, could fix you?

33
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:02,645
Not nobody.

34
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:05,327
We're deep in space,
corner of no and where.

35
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,609
You take extra care with her...

36
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:10,169
...because we're very much alone
out here.
