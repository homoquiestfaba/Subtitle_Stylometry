1
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,791
I told you to aim higher!

2
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,041
Stop talking to your friends
or I'll blow your head off!

3
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:16,958
Go fight!

4
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,541
Go fight!

5
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,750
Don't throw another fucking grenade!

6
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,791
We're back here too!

7
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,208
Don't throw another one!

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Shut up!

9
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,041
Don't be afraid. All is good.

10
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,083
The Boy! Worry about the Boy!

11
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,208
Ammo? Ammo?

12
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,416
No! Look for something sharp that could kill!

13
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,625
They're out of ammo! They're out of ammo!

14
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Uncle?

15
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,250
Uncle?

16
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,125
Uncle?

17
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:20,958
Clear?

18
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,083
Clear?

19
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,541
Clear!

20
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,166
Secure the area.

21
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,208
Be careful.

22
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,750
SWAT.

23
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,375
Two Policemen inside.

24
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,500
God I hate guns.

25
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,375
You two okay?

26
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,541
What are uniformed Policemen
doing on this side of the City?

27
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,750
Arresting these two, Sir.

28
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,000
We're arresting people again?

29
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,083
Yes, Sir.

30
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,416
Progress.

31
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,458
Daesh is starting to break. Run.

32
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,500
Did they know that?

33
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,291
Arresting them for what?

34
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,333
Drugs, Sir.

35
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,416
Crossing over to our side, trading
drugs for weapons, ammo.

36
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,583
With friends like ours who needs enemies?

37
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,541
How long have you been a Policeman?

38
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,291
Two months, Sir.

39
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,916
You can fight.

40
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,541
You're the SWAT Team?

41
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,291
SWAT?

42
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,458
Yeah.

43
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,833
We thought you were all dead.

44
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,458
They're dead...

45
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,166
I think they did too.

46
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,541
Still good?

47
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,791
All good.

48
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,833
The List.

49
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,916
Hurry.

50
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,125
We thought you were all dead, Sir.

51
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,666
Didn't you already say that?

52
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,750
Only half the Unit died.

53
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:53,500
The half who remembered you should
question suspects before stabbing them?

54
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,291
We've heard all their answers.

55
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,708
Then at least put bullets in their heads.

56
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,375
Bomb! Bomb!

57
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,166
White KIA turning left.
Move! Move!

58
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,041
Clear?

59
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,666
Clear?

60
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,208
Clear!

61
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,375
Get up...

62
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,833
Move. Move.

63
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,458
What's your full name?

64
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,666
Why, Sir?

65
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,333
If you're on the list, you're the enemy.

66
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,708
Sir, he has a common name.

67
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,291
There are ages next to the names.

68
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,333
How old is the list, Sir?

69
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,291
I don't know.

70
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,291
Where did you get it?

71
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,291
We've always had it.

72
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,208
We're Policemen. Like all of you.

73
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,541
Police?

74
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:08,500
He was police. And him. And him. And him.

75
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,708
And him. And-

76
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,125
I am Jameel Al Qurtubi.

77
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,041
Qurtubi.

78
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,416
Jameel Ziad Al Qurtubi.

79
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't be afraid, you're not the enemy.

80
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,541
Sir-

81
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,250
Kawa Salah al-Faily.

82
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:31,916
Your ID?

83
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:36,833
I haven't been a Policeman
long enough to receive an ID.

84
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,875
How old are you?

85
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,375
21, Sir.

86
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,750
Have either of you been wounded?

87
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,458
No.

88
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:10,291
I mean not just today, but ever?
Wounded by Daesh?

89
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,708
You're the last two then.

90
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,208
Have either of you lost family to Daesh?

91
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,500
No, some were killed by the
Americans, some left with them.

92
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,125
He was my Uncle.

93
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,875
Did you love him?

94
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,875
Of course I did.

95
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,083
Why aren't you crying?

96
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,833
I don't know.

97
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,875
Are you married?

98
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,750
Sir, I wouldn't be here if I was.

99
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,916
What?

100
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,416
What do you mean?

101
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,750
Calm down, calm down.

102
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,583
He's still a kid.

103
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,875
Let him be.

104
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,291
What did I say?

105
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,375
Kamal.

106
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,541
Him too?

107
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,000
No.

108
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why?

109
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,958
He hasn't been wounded by Daesh or lost family to them.

110
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,791
And all of you have?

111
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,541
Most both.

112
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,500
I don't really know who you are.

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,583
We're the Men who killed the
Men who killed your Uncle.

114
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,958
If you need to know more than that,
you shouldn't take the hat.

115
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,958
I don't want to leave his body here.

116
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,041
We won't leave him here.

117
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,375
Let's go.

118
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,291
We're taking Kurdish kids now?

119
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,166
What's wrong with Kurds?

120
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,166
I'll get your Uncle.

121
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,208
Let's go guys. Fast.

122
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,250
Take this off?

123
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,208
You a medium?

124
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,875
Medium.

125
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,458
What do you think? We got a store?

126
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,583
Here's a belt.

127
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,625
Are you left or right handed?

128
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,041
Left.

129
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,333
Get back to the other side.

130
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,083
Those weren't the only guys we
were trying to catch over here.

131
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,625
Get back to the other side.

132
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,958
Arresting people here and now is useless.

133
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,583
Every jail in Iraq is a broken urn.

134
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,666
Tell your superiors he's with us.

135
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,500
My superiors think you're dead.

136
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,750
Then they'll be anxious to hear
what you have to say. Go.

137
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,750
Move.

138
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,708
Here's your weapon.

139
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,083
Kawa...

140
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,833
Are you sure?

141
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,291
Don't waste it.

142
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,875
I'm going to wash his Uncle's blood off his hands.

143
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,041
Waleed, Kamal...keep him between you.

144
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,583
Watch us and you'll learn quick.

145
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,041
Sorry about what I said.

146
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,750
Where did you guys just come from?

147
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,916
Did you go to the Gifted Students School?

148
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:33,916
Yeah.

149
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,791
I was a few years ahead of you. You look familiar.

150
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:43,833
We were on mission, heard your service
pistols, assumed it was police in trouble.

151
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,083
Thank you.

152
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:50,083
Thank Major Jasem. If it had been up to
me we would have stayed on mission.

153
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,166
What is your mission?

154
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,208
It's OUR mission now.

155
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,791
And if you fuck it up I'll kill you.

156
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:52,125
Wait here and provide cover first.

157
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:56,916
Thank you.

158
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,083
What?

159
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,208
Thank you. You saved my life.

160
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,083
How long since your Dad died?

161
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,708
How do you know my Dad is dead?

162
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,833
I can tell you were raised well.

163
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,541
Raised by a mother.

164
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,458
Lift your weapon up and keep your eyes open.

165
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,208
And don't thank me.

166
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,333
We need the numbers.

167
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,541
I smell a body...

168
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's right here.

169
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,708
Clear!

170
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,416
Let's take 10 minutes here to rest.

171
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,708
Check if there is electricity...

172
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,875
Shut up, Dick.

173
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,416
You wanna go?

174
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:17,916
Let's secure the 2nd floor.
The smell down here is killing me.

175
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,041
Let's go guys.

176
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,750
Just 10 minutes. I promise.

177
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,291
You should eat something.

178
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay?

179
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,541
And the 3rd Humvee won't be back for a bit anyway.

180
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,958
As ordered, Sir.

181
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,791
Kawa?

182
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,375
Clear!

183
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,125
We call this a "Stack". Two clear
the room, two provide cover.

184
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,541
When ready, we touch the shoulder.

185
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,041
Never stand in front of a door. You'll get killed.

186
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,083
Clear!

187
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,625
Clear!

188
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,958
Found one!

189
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,333
The Kuwaiti soap opera?

190
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,541
Why's she starting a fight?

191
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,208
Because she's pregnant and the other one isn't.

192
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,291
Who's the woman in between them?

193
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,750
I think the third wife - no, no, no - I mean the first wife.

194
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,125
First or third?

195
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,375
The first, the first, the one with the Mercedes.

196
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,416
Let us watch!

197
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,250
Let me answer his question!

198
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,666
How many does he need?

199
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,416
Kuwaitis, Bro.

200
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,000
Kawa, sit.

201
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,833
Whenever we have a chance to relax, take advantage.

202
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,458
Give it a second.

203
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,875
The third wife is really beautiful.

204
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,666
One is enough trouble, let alone three.

205
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,250
Hand me any trash...

206
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,125
Kamal, hand me the money.

207
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,875
What's the mission?

208
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,666
You don't need to know.

209
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,250
You don't trust me?

210
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,541
Hell no.

211
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,791
Get some rest. And you have to eat.

212
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,166
What's this?

213
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,125
Money.

214
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,333
Why?

215
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,291
Which would you go for?

216
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,291
Any is good.

217
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,666
Move.

218
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,791
That's my partner!

219
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,375
I told you to move away from here.

220
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,166
Your partner is a son of a bitch traitor.

221
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,791
How do you know?

222
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,958
Let them all get out first?

223
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,083
Get down!

224
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,750
Everyone okay?

225
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,333
Everyone okay?

226
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,875
I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything!

227
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,750
What did I do? What did I do?

228
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,333
Get the fuck off me!

229
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,958
Get off me!

230
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,041
The kid didn't do anything.

231
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,125
I said get off me!

232
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,500
Take these.

233
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:57,166
These should go to one of his friends.

234
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,083
I'm not a traitor.

235
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,875
I'm not a traitor.

236
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,250
Pick up your brother.

237
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,250
Move.

238
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,000
Careful of his head.

239
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,500
Careful with his leg.

240
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,125
Amen.

241
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,458
God rest his soul.

242
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:16,916
Where's-

243
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,291
-he's dead.

244
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,750
He's new.

245
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,750
Huddle around.

246
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:33,291
Sir, the shortest route is to stay
here on the shit side of the City...

247
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:37,250
...head north, get attacked 50
times before we make it a mile.

248
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,125
Or we can try to bribe our way to the safe
side of the City through this checkpoint here.

249
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,083
Both sound lovely.

250
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,750
But let's do the checkpoint.

251
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,250
It's safer.

252
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,583
But not for you.

253
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:53,416
Yes for me too: court martial is still preferable to death.

254
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,250
I think.

255
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,875
Move. I'm the lead vehicle.

256
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,208
Kawa, you're with us.

257
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,208
Bribe who?

258
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,041
Razak, quicker.

259
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,000
A bit quicker.

260
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:39,833
Hey infidels, the soldiers of the
Islamic State are still everywhere.

261
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:43,333
We will remain and expand.

262
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:46,875
We will cut your heads off.

263
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,458
Your supporters are the Agents of the Cross.

264
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,375
Your women will be ours.

265
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:55,875
And your children, cubs of the caliphate. God willing.

266
00:26:56,458 --> 00:27:00,500
Fuck you and your so called "state." Son of a bitch.

267
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,541
We're the ones coming for you.

268
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:20,416
Let's pick up these children.

269
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,375
Stop the car. Stop the car.

270
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:29,583
Come with us.

271
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,250
We're crossing over.

272
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,583
Come on dears, come with us.

273
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,708
Come with us.

274
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,875
We're not strangers. Come with us.

275
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,125
We can't leave. I promised my Dad.

276
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,166
Where is he?

277
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:55,333
Don't worry. We can rebuild everything.

278
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:58,541
We just have to kill them all first.

279
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:00,750
No. I promised.

280
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:01,958
Should we?

281
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,666
You promised Dad too!

282
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,333
Mom was bleeding.

283
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,708
So you just lie to them?
They didn't teach you better?

284
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:10,708
They taught me to look out for my brother!
What'd they teach you?

285
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:11,916
They taught me to keep my word.

286
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,666
Who will bury them if we don't?

287
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,916
We can help you dig. Just come with us.

288
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,916
Sir please, we don't have time.

289
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:20,375
They're children. Wait!

290
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:23,500
Sir, can't we just grab these little guys?

291
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,208
This is not a place to stop and talk.

292
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,041
I'm going with them!

293
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,500
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

294
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,583
If you go, we'll each be alone.

295
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,333
Come with me. Come with me. Come with me.

296
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,916
Calm down Waleed.

297
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,250
Sir, please, we don't have time.

298
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,541
Give me a second!

299
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:43,583
Come on dear.

300
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,416
You coming or not?

301
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,166
I promised my Dad.

302
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,833
We are the Federal Police.

303
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,083
I know.

304
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:51,125
You never saw us, or the two
vehicles right behind. Got it?

305
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,166
Guys, take care of his body.

306
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,833
Why are we bribing Federal Police to
cross back to our side of the City?

307
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:59,375
None of us knows anything about you pretty boy.
Except that your partner was a fucking traitor.

308
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,791
You keep asking questions-

309
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,250
-like why are we bribing our own?

310
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,500
Yeah, and it won't end well.

311
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,708
Shut up. Pray.

312
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,791
Peace be upon you.

313
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:20,833
And upon you.

314
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,750
I see you are a family man.

315
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,458
I have a small request.

316
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:28,666
I found this kid on the other side.

317
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,791
I'd like for you to take care of him.

318
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,416
He lost his mom...

319
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:43,208
I can't.

320
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,833
Sorry.

321
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,583
He needs a family, you have a family. Please keep him.

322
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,458
Of course we will keep him with us.

323
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,250
God bless you sister.

324
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,291
Grow up to be good.

325
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:03,833
If you leave him with the Red Crescent, I'll know.

326
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:12,791
My love, are you hurt?

327
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:14,708
Does it hurt you?

328
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,416
Come here, come.

329
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:34,958
SWAT?

330
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,000
You're still alive?!

331
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,750
Command has been looking all over for you!

332
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,625
Are you okay?

333
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,666
Don't worry about him.

334
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:43,708
Keep moving.

335
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,541
Don't touch me!

336
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:45,333
Keep moving!

337
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,041
Don't touch me!

338
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,375
Do you guys hear me?

339
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,541
Hey! What's wrong with you?

340
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,458
You've heard the stories about us?

341
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,416
Yes.

342
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:00,750
They're all true.

343
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,541
If you tell anybody you saw us...

344
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,416
...I'll know it was you.

345
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:09,916
Got it?

346
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:16,583
Let's move, boys.

347
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,833
Hey SWAT?

348
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:42,250
We see you driving round the City.
What are you looking for?

349
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,958
You used to have 6 Humvees, now it's 3.

350
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:53,250
Couple months ago you had 9.

351
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,541
You are the infidels and the apostates.

352
00:34:56,541 --> 00:35:00,750
You have lovely homes with comfortable beds.
Thanks for leaving them to us.

353
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,541
We are not picking up ammo?

354
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:08,541
Or food?

355
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,291
Why not?

356
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,958
Why when I ask a question no one answers?

357
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,625
What are you running from?
Really. What are you running from?

358
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:20,791
WE.

359
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,000
What are WE running from.

360
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,083
Where's the borek?

361
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:28,541
I ate it.

362
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,041
You finished it?

363
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:31,958
Yeah.

364
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,458
You should have shared with Razak or Waleed.

365
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:35,583
I got hungry.

366
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,958
You'll eat me next.

367
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,208
I used to be a Homicide Detective.

368
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,833
I know.

369
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,458
I was studying to be a detective.

370
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,458
You taught my evidence class.

371
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,583
You were in one of my evidence classes?

372
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:19,250
I knew I made a big impression.

373
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,041
Sorry.

374
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,041
Feels like many lifetimes ago.

375
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,208
I used to love my work.

376
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:34,166
Teaching?

377
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:36,541
Being a Detective.

378
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:43,666
I was really good at it.
Probably why I loved it so much.

379
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:48,000
I liked who I was.

380
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:53,375
You can go back to it, Sir.

381
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:58,916
I can never go back to it.

382
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:19,166
We're the good guys.

383
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:20,875
What?

384
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,250
We're the good guys.

385
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:29,416
Listen carefully, the checkpoint was the
last time you put a hand on me.

386
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,375
If you stopped asking questions,
I wouldn't have shoved you.

387
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:39,750
I'm not a donkey to be pushed around or yelled at.

388
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,583
Explain things to me.

389
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,958
I don't know where we're going.
I don't know what our mission is.

390
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:45,666
I don't know you. I don't know any of you.

391
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,250
Why would I listen to you?

392
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,750
Understand?

393
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,458
Give me that.

394
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:57,125
His brother.

395
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,416
He'd force himself to watch this video.

396
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:04,958
Whenever he had second thoughts
about what we were doing.

397
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:08,125
Who we were fighting, and why.

398
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:14,916
All the pictures he took were
proof that he did his part.

399
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,750
Pictures he could show his family.

400
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:20,125
Most of them are cops or soldiers.

401
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,291
So that's what you're doing? You're taking vengeance?

402
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,041
100 to 150 civilians headed this way...

403
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,791
Windows up.

404
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,625
We're about to cross back into the shit.

405
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,666
Keep your eyes open guys.

406
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,625
Watch it.

407
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,791
Stop! Stop!

408
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:58,166
They're shooting civilians!

409
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,666
Why are they shooting them?

410
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,958
Punishing them for leaving.

411
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,291
They want to keep them as human shields.

412
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,750
Where are they shooting from?

413
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,708
People are falling before we hear the shots!

414
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,708
I can't see Sir.

415
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:16,875
To the left! To the left!

416
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:25,541
Take cover behind the vehicles!

417
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,791
One o'clock! One o'clock!

418
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,041
Go back! Go back! You're in a minefield!

419
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:47,208
Akram, Youness.

420
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:51,166
Stay here and protect the people.
Shoot at the rooftop to the right!

421
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:53,083
Don't stop until I tell you to.

422
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,458
Razak move!

423
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,083
Fuck this!

424
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,291
Thaer my Son!

425
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:07,875
Fuck our luck!

426
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:09,875
Fuck our luck!

427
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,000
Wait until they reload.

428
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,208
Stop! Stop!

429
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,291
Razak, stay here and wait for the others.

430
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:25,875
Waleed, Kawa let's go.

431
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,416
Now?

432
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:53,291
Clear.

433
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,833
Clear.

434
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,666
All clear guys.

435
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Move down the street.

436
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,041
Stay on the side road, not the main one.

437
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,625
Razak is waiting. Move.

438
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,333
Son of a bitch.

439
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,500
Fuck you and everything you stood for.

440
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,083
Be careful Waleed.

441
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,083
Stay away from the wall.

442
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,541
This one's better.

443
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,333
Do you see it from here?

444
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,791
Not yet, Sir.

445
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,250
To the left. To the left.

446
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,083
Where?

447
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,583
Blue satellite. About 2 kilometers...

448
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,500
We're really close.

449
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:41,500
Drive the Humvees to the closest
point, then continue on foot.

450
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:52,708
We need to cross through here,
but this route is dangerous.

451
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:55,750
It's easy for them to ambush us
because of the narrow alleys.

452
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:01,000
When we were kids we'd throw rocks at the
Americans, then use the alleys to escape.

453
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,416
They're narrower than Humvees,
so they couldn't chase us.

454
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,416
Let him suffer.

455
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:51,416
What?

456
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,791
Leave him.

457
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:26,625
Amir.

458
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,083
Take up a sniper position.

459
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:30,791
On this side, got it?

460
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,041
Razak, Akram and Youness...

461
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,458
Yes, Sir?

462
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:38,000
Go to Waleed. He's going to walk
you through how we get there.

463
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,750
...there are tight alleys the Humvees can't pass through.

464
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:01,958
We'll have to be on foot. It's going to be rough.

465
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,791
Get me the hammer from my bag.

466
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,083
What's your name?

467
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,041
Amir. And you're Kawa?

468
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:28,291
Yeah.

469
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:29,625
Good to meet you.

470
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:31,916
Good to meet you too.

471
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:35,833
Fuck!

472
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:37,625
Sir?

473
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:39,541
Please come look.

474
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,458
Sorry Sir, but please look.

475
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:44,458
What's wrong?

476
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:57,375
Between the pink building and
the parking lot on the left...

477
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:01,375
See it?

478
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:11,958
Do you think that's one of their bases?

479
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,375
Yes.

480
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,250
We could try to call in artillery.

481
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,125
No I can't.

482
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,208
Our people would deny the request...

483
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:32,458
...scrap our mission, and throw me
in jail. You should know this.

484
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:36,166
I could call my buddy at the Joint Operations Center...

485
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,958
...give him this grid, see if the Americans could airstrike?

486
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:39,833
No.

487
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:40,875
I grew up with him.

488
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:41,916
I said no.

489
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:46,125
They flatten everything because they
don't have to rebuild anything.

490
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:49,833
Don't talk about the Americans
anymore. We're past that.

491
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:56,500
If we attack what looks like an enemy base...

492
00:48:57,916 --> 00:48:59,541
...we'll have to assault it ourselves.

493
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:01,250
10 Men.

494
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:05,625
It's your decision.

495
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:12,875
Sir, you're our Commander, not me.

496
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,708
Why are you putting this on me?

497
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:15,708
Because I'm tired.

498
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:17,791
These are 10 Men. And I'm tired too.

499
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:20,041
I'm tired too, Sir.

500
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,000
In two hours I've lost two of my sons.

501
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,791
In two hours I've lost two of my brothers.

502
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:25,250
We all lost them, Sir.

503
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:25,875
Waleed!

504
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:26,625
Sir!

505
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:27,083
Waleed!

506
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,166
Don't shout Sir!

507
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:32,375
Do we wipe that base out?

508
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:35,791
So we can stop worrying
about what's right behind us?

509
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:39,041
Or do we bypass it and try
to stay unseen and unheard?

510
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:40,541
Sir, I beg you.

511
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:43,041
Waleed! You pick!

512
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,041
These are 10 Men.

513
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:46,625
Making them my...

514
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:57,791
I say we can go around it...

515
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,375
...we can stay unnoticed.

516
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:05,291
Anyone see it?

517
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:07,458
Spot it?

518
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:10,750
Call it if you see it.

519
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,250
No one fires.

520
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:14,541
We need every bullet.

521
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:16,916
Take cover!

522
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,083
That was C4 or PETN.

523
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,500
You okay?

524
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:41,208
Sir, one of our Humvees is gone!

525
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,833
DHL will deliver anywhere.

526
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,833
Barter?

527
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:18,000
For what?

528
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,083
7.62

529
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:21,750
Sorry. Shooting 5-5-6.

530
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:28,375
An Iranian Special Forces Colonel, in Iraq,
using an American rifle, firing NATO ammo?

531
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:30,583
Crazy world.

532
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:32,166
Someone should sell tickets.

533
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,833
We still have some boxes
of 7.62, just in case.

534
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:41,833
I believe in contingencies.

535
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,250
What do you need?

536
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:45,208
Cigarettes.

537
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,791
Those we have.

538
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:51,833
Nicotine and bullets bring the world together.

539
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:54,041
Meet me right in front of our building.

540
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,458
Okay.

541
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:59,666
Stay low and get down to the street. Fast.

542
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,625
Amir, Kawa, let's go.

543
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:12,041
Leave him. Let him suffer.

544
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Get your hands off me!

545
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,583
Calm down, calm down...

546
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,708
Just the one the Colonel was talking to.

547
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,208
Are you stupid?

548
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,291
Sir, Kamal and I can't let you go alone.

549
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:57,250
Waleed, we have no choice.

550
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,083
Take care, I won't be long.

551
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,875
Peace be upon you.

552
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,833
And upon you. Welcome.

553
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:30,875
What?

554
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,375
Have you never been this close to
a Popular Mobilization Force?

555
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:38,166
I've been this close to many.

556
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,291
I've even fought alongside a few.

557
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:46,875
But I've always kept my distance
from your particular group.

558
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:49,458
It's a pleasure to meet you too.

559
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:50,833
I'm Colonel Isfahani.

560
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:53,208
What brings you to our part of the City?

561
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:55,500
I was born in this part of the City.

562
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,208
I'll guess most of your Men were too.

563
00:53:58,208 --> 00:54:02,833
The better question is why are you here?
Such a long way from your family?

564
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,166
Logistical support.

565
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:05,125
Logistics.

566
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:06,250
Indeed.

567
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:07,958
How many cartons is that?

568
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,583
13 Cartons.

569
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,291
Did you guys hijack a truck?

570
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:16,916
Looks like maybe one carton
for each of your men.

571
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:19,750
We're not all equal.

572
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:21,166
Tea?

573
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,416
No thanks.

574
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:24,458
Please have some tea.

575
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:26,541
Let's make it quick.

576
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:32,000
What are you doing?
Keep your eyes on the street.

577
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:35,166
You let him go down there without his weapon?

578
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:37,000
Jasem's a wolf.

579
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,208
Don't worry about him.

580
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:40,500
Waleed was worried.

581
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,291
Waleed has his reasons.

582
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:43,791
Focus on your role.

583
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,166
3 cartons for each box-

584
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:48,583
-1 carton for 1 box.

585
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,750
Make it quick.

586
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,250
You're SWAT...

587
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:00,208
...so I assume you were all police once?

588
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,750
We still are Police.

589
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,916
And you are from this City?

590
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:05,250
I told you: born and raised.

591
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:09,666
Okay. One box for one carton...

592
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:13,875
...you take a look at our prisoners
to see if you can identify any?

593
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,041
Deal?

594
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:16,708
Deal. Let's go.

595
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:24,375
Finally some cigs.

596
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:25,541
I don't know him.

597
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:28,666
I don't know him.

598
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,000
Kawa get down here right now!

599
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:48,625
Kawa! Get in here right now!

600
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,458
This is your partner, isn't it?

601
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,625
That's him.

602
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:07,166
I knew you wouldn't still be in the cafe...

603
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:08,708
...I knew you wouldn't.

604
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:14,708
Colonel, let me take him.
He gave us away to Daesh.

605
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:16,750
So we don't have a problem.

606
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,250
No.

607
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:22,791
I screamed...

608
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,000
They beat me!

609
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:34,500
Told me if I didn't show them your position,
they would find my family in America.

610
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:38,833
He's ours.

611
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:41,666
Don't hit him.

612
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:44,041
Don't hit him like that again.

613
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,541
He's ours.

614
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:46,250
No.

615
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,708
They took my phone.

616
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:52,708
They found my grandson in Michigan, on Facebook.

617
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:55,333
...there was no additional quid pro quo
if you did actually identify a face.

618
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:57,416
I looked around for you, to try to see you-

619
00:56:57,416 --> 00:57:01,375
-you didn't. I saw you throw the flare and run.

620
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,916
If it were me I'd give him to you.

621
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,666
You're not me.

622
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:07,000
That's right: I'm an Iraqi in Iraq.

623
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:10,541
You're Iraqis too - or have you forgotten?

624
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:13,125
And what a wonderful job of
stewardship you've done here.

625
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:14,583
I'm not the enemy!

626
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,375
It's always darkest before the dawn.

627
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:16,791
It's always darkest before the dawn.
I'm not the enemy!

628
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:17,333
The dawn of what?

629
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,750
The dawn of what?
Check your list again!

630
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,416
I'm not the enemy! Check your list!

631
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,875
An Iraq without Sadaam, the West,
Terrorists, or an Iranian Colonel.

632
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:29,000
Without us, you'll curse yourselves
with something or someone else.

633
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,166
You know why?

634
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:34,458
I'm sure you'll tell me.

635
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:39,125
Because you're not a real country.
You haven't been since Babylon.

636
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:43,916
You were created by a drunk British dilettante
and a French bureaucrat with inaccurate maps.

637
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:48,250
And you by angry children who took hostages.

638
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,500
Fuck you all!

639
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,375
You'll break into at least three
pieces once we finish off Daesh.

640
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:54,583
That shouldn't be hard now!

641
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:58,541
After the 3 years we've spent killing
their toughest and best Fighters!

642
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,416
What part of those 3 years were
spent running from them?

643
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:05,125
Iraqi Army rifle for sale, never
been fired, only dropped once.

644
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,416
You got the wrong Unit, Colonel!

645
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:12,375
Fuck you all! I have killed more
enemies than all of you!

646
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:15,291
All I've ever known is war!

647
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,541
So both of you can go fuck yourselves!

648
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:20,458
Iranian, Kuwaiti, American, Al Qaeda-

649
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:21,291
-shut up!

650
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,291
Shut up!

651
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,750
Shut up!

652
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:25,916
Is that a challenge?

653
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:28,083
I'm not the enemy! I'm not the en-

654
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,041
Okay...

655
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:20,625
...one box for one carton.

656
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,416
Chill...

657
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:42,083
Calm down.

658
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:45,166
Sinan, take two boxes.

659
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,458
This used to belong to our friend...

660
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,291
Trade this for your RPG?

661
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,291
What's happening here?

662
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,208
A hookah for the RPG.

663
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,041
Fine. Just the one rocket though.

664
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:06,541
Why'd you do that?

665
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:10,791
We need more than bullets to wipe out that base.

666
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:13,791
I was wrong before. We can't leave it behind us.

667
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:18,416
I told you, it's your call. Move.

668
01:00:49,708 --> 01:00:56,041
The reason we can't go back for ammo,
or call in artillery strikes...

669
01:00:57,625 --> 01:01:00,791
...or sleep on mattresses on the safe side of the City...

670
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:03,000
...is because we're disobeying orders.

671
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,333
Disobeying 'new' orders I should say.

672
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:10,625
A month ago, we were given a mission.

673
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,625
A mission we all wanted.
A mission I planned.

674
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:20,500
Two weeks later, we were put under
a new Army Command.

675
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,541
And that Command scrapped our mission...

676
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:26,833
...and tried to send us to a village miles
from here. Miles from our fight.

677
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,750
So we stopped taking their calls.

678
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:33,000
And kept on with our old mission, which is to-

679
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
-I don't need to know anymore.

680
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:38,208
Don't want to know.

681
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:44,291
Tell me what I need to know when
I need to know it and I'll do it.

682
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,666
Whatever it is.

683
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:51,833
Razak, end of the line.

684
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:01,500
I don't like this.

685
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:35,208
No!

686
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:47,541
RPG! RPG!

687
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:49,416
No! It's not for this!

688
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:04,666
Get down!

689
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:16,375
We got them! Blew their heads off!

690
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:17,458
Kawa's injured!

691
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:18,458
Youness!

692
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:19,375
Youness!

693
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:23,333
Be careful.

694
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:26,416
Clear!

695
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,750
Waleed, hold him.

696
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,000
Kawa.

697
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,083
Can you hear me?

698
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:58,666
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

699
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,541
They were firing at us.
I had to throw the grenade.

700
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,875
I swear to God I didn't see him. He ran in front.

701
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:09,083
I got something.

702
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,375
God rest your soul, Youness.

703
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:20,750
Enough. Enough.

704
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:29,875
Is his injury bad?

705
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,125
Ugly gash.

706
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:35,291
How many fingers?

707
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:36,291
Three.

708
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:38,166
Let's go champ. Let's go.

709
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:40,208
Let's go guys. Get your weapons.

710
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:07,375
May God bless you, keep you safe.

711
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:10,125
Cigarettes? Cigarettes?

712
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:13,750
I just want a cigarette.

713
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,125
You okay?

714
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,583
It's a small injury.

715
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:27,625
Everyone okay?

716
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,083
Razak?

717
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:31,083
Clear!

718
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:40,833
Razak is dead.

719
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,791
Pick up his ammo and let's move.

720
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,291
Fuck you, you son of a bitch.

721
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:24,375
Guys, Sinan is bleeding.

722
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,041
We need to get going.

723
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,416
Kamal?

724
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,083
How's Sinan?

725
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:34,666
He's okay Jasem.

726
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:37,666
Make it quick.

727
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,041
It's dangerous here.

728
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:40,583
We need to get going.

729
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:44,083
Sinan are you okay?

730
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:45,083
I'm okay.

731
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,541
Kamal, make it quick.

732
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:51,833
We're close to their base. Work quickly.

733
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,041
We're in the open Kamal.

734
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,416
Guys, he's injured!

735
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,125
Let's get moving guys.

736
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:40,958
Stop right here, Sir.

737
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:47,833
Their base is on the other side of these buildings.

738
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,250
We're real close.

739
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,291
Waleed, come with me.

740
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:04,458
Everyone else hold here.

741
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,958
Look at these fools.

742
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:45,833
Loading up ammo and money out in the open.

743
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,125
Seems like they are running away.

744
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:52,250
Who cares if they're running, Sir?

745
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:53,875
So we attack?

746
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,083
Yes, we attack.

747
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:22,000
Alright, this is how we're going to do this...

748
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:44,958
It's a dud! It's a dud!

749
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:48,583
Dud! Dud! Move and I will cover you!

750
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:23,208
Waleed go down!

751
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:49,166
Breathe. Breathe.

752
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,958
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

753
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:06,125
Kamal, move next to Sinan.

754
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:07,458
Akram?

755
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:09,458
He's dead, Sir.

756
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:11,125
May he rest in peace. Get moving.

757
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:13,583
Listen, listen.

758
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:15,541
Kamal, go through the opening on the right.

759
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:17,041
Secure the area.

760
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:19,583
Kawa, Waleed you're with me.

761
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:36,750
Clear?

762
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:48,375
Clear?

763
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:50,125
Clear!

764
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,750
Guys, everyone okay?

765
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:10,625
We got 90 seconds.

766
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:14,583
Stay alert. There might be more.

767
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:18,250
Reload, hydrate, then we finish.

768
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:27,416
Take some water for the team.

769
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,291
Is everyone okay, Sir?

770
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:31,875
Amir, you stay there and cover that side.

771
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:34,916
We got 90 seconds.

772
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:50,750
Kamal?

773
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:52,583
What?

774
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:53,916
Tramadol, can he use it?

775
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:55,375
Yes he can.

776
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:56,791
Sinan...

777
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,875
Everything about them is empty.

778
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,666
Sinan can you move?

779
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:03,541
Sir!

780
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,500
90 seconds is up.

781
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,375
We can come back for all our dead,
but 90 seconds is up.

782
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:13,250
Do you even know where we're going?

783
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:15,458
What we've been doing?

784
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:18,125
Who are you?

785
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:20,333
I'm one of you.

786
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:22,291
I know.

787
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:25,500
I know it has to add up to
something more than all this.

788
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:30,166
Or none of you would still be
doing this, fighting like this.

789
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:34,916
Suffering like this on the shit side of the
City if it wasn't for something bigger.

790
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:37,208
We must move.

791
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,750
He's right.

792
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:50,083
There are six of us. We can finish the mission.

793
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,250
Or all die.

794
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,958
What are you saying?

795
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:59,791
Our plan is fucked!

796
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,708
Major Jasem was everything to us.

797
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:03,041
Our plan is fucked!

798
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,041
Let's think of another way...

799
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:10,875
This is Major Jasem.

800
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:14,291
Our Father.

801
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:21,958
Without him this will turn to shit.

802
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:23,750
Waleed.

803
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:27,500
It has already turned to shit hundreds of times.

804
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,666
And yet we're still here.

805
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:33,250
Three blocks away, Brother.

806
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:36,000
Three blocks.

807
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:59,041
Two blocks, Kamal.

808
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,291
The blue satellite...

809
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:05,750
Stay on me. We're going up four flights.
Don't separate.

810
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:08,250
Any man you see in this building should die.

811
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:12,625
Only those with suppressors should shoot.
Everybody else try to use blades.

812
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:14,083
Only fire if you need to.

813
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:25,833
Radios off.

814
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,291
Ready?

815
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:01,041
Waleed.

816
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:03,250
We're being seen. How do you want to do this?

817
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:31,583
Waleed.

818
01:24:31,791 --> 01:24:34,083
Take a breath and calm down.

819
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:42,833
Ready?

820
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:44,333
One.

821
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:46,250
Two.

822
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,041
Waleed.

823
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:48,750
Let Amir do it.

824
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,375
No Kamal. I'll do it.

825
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:52,625
Ready?

826
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,333
Hayat it's me!

827
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:17,250
Dunia, it's your Dad.

828
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:24,125
Hayat...

829
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:25,291
Waleed?

830
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:28,000
Waleed!

831
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:34,166
Where have you been?

832
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:37,250
Daddy?

833
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:49,500
I thought you were dead.

834
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:59,458
I'm here with you.

835
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:17,541
Where were you?

836
01:26:23,041 --> 01:26:25,333
Do you know how long you've been away?

837
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,791
Let me check your injury.

838
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,583
I missed you so much.

839
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,125
Does it add up to more?

840
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:13,000
Are we doing this for everybody on the team?

841
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:17,083
For those whose families weren't
murdered when the City fell.

842
01:27:24,375 --> 01:27:26,250
I'm pregnant.

843
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:46,333
It's my fault.

844
01:27:48,708 --> 01:27:51,333
I couldn't come back for you.

845
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:54,416
God knows I tried.

846
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,375
I tried.

847
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,500
I swear to God I couldn't get back to you.

848
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,000
Why?

849
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,333
Jasem.

850
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:08,708
This was all Major Jasem.

851
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,458
Because the youngest have more
time to have more children.

852
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:14,708
More children brings back our City faster.

853
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:37,916
Amir's wife died.

854
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:41,416
But his little boy is still alive.

855
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:45,666
As of last week. We got information on him.

856
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,791
Did Major Jasem have a family?

857
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,000
Yes he did.

858
01:28:56,291 --> 01:29:02,291
Daesh knew who we were because we
had arrested so many of them before.

859
01:29:03,041 --> 01:29:07,708
They were all common criminals before
there ever was a Daesh to join.

860
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:13,166
A man Jasem put in prison became
one of their Commanders.

861
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:16,416
He found the Major's family...

862
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:27,083
Pack your things.

863
01:29:35,916 --> 01:29:37,333
Why are you putting that on?

864
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:40,458
You're not going to come with us?

865
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:49,708
Don't be afraid.

866
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:53,125
I'm with you.

867
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:55,458
We don't have much time.

868
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:01,416
We don't have much time my love.

869
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:59,666
Do you know how much I love you?

870
01:31:51,041 --> 01:31:54,041
How far from here is your Son?
