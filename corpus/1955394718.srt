1
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,378
- Please don't kill me.

2
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,048
I'll do anything that you want.

3
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,751
Do you want to kiss me?

4
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,155
Is that what you want?

5
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,292
You want me to take
my clothes off?

6
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,728
You...

7
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,731
You want to touch me?

8
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,399
You can touch me.

9
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,837
Is that what you like?

10
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,273
You want to see more?

11
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,354
- What's the matter?

12
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,290
- I'm sorry, I just...

13
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:31,290
I wasn't sure if--

14
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:35,861
- Adele told you there
was gonna be nudity, right?

15
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,863
- Yeah, we want to
make real sure that signal

16
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,665
doesn't get crossed.

17
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,733
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:41,733
I just, I wasn't sure if--

19
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:45,204
- oh, she's wondering
if we needed her to--

20
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:46,505
- oh, you
mean like right now?

21
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:47,506
- Yeah, no.

22
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,507
That's not necessary.

23
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,775
- Okay.

24
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,443
- Yeah, we can see
how beautiful you are.

25
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,178
- No, look, it's...

26
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,247
We appreciate your
determination, but
she did tell you

27
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:59,852
that the nudity is fairly
extensive though, Adele, right?

28
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:03,388
- Um, she just said
that there was nudity.

29
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,823
- Nah, it's extensive.

30
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,458
- You're okay with that?

31
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,759
Is that?

32
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:07,759
'Cause if it's not cool.

33
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,295
- What we're
saying is we need someone

34
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,463
who's not gonna--

35
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,465
- yeah, we
cannot show up on set,

36
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,734
and have the girl just change
her mind at the last minute,

37
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:16,735
you know?

38
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,270
- Yeah, no.

39
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,838
Adele explained it to me.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,707
- Okay, but
sometimes, even then,

41
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,543
the agent and manager
explain it, and then,

42
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,512
you gotta tell us now,
because this film,

43
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,881
the way we're gonna shoot's
gonna be very verite.

44
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,716
A lot of long takes.

45
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,885
It would, it has to be you.

46
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,353
It can't be a double.

47
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,554
- Don't worry, sweetheart.

48
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:38,724
We'll make sure
you look beautiful.

49
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,760
- Uh, yeah, no, that's fine.

50
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,828
That's fine.

51
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,930
Um,

52
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,533
should I?

53
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,902
- Yes, please.

54
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:50,736
- Can we go back?

55
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,204
- Sure.

56
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,306
Where are we going
back to, honey?

57
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,207
- Oh, um.

58
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,745
How about, "I'll do
anything you want?"

59
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:00,879
Is that okay?

60
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,214
- Yeah,
whatever, sweetheart.

61
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,882
It's all about you.

62
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,694
- You want to kiss me?

63
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,797
Is that what you want?

64
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,899
- You think I'm
gonna fall for that?

65
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:20,899
- I don't know.

66
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,368
I don't know what
you want from me.

67
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,904
I'll take my clothes off.

68
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:26,972
You want to touch me?

69
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,840
You can touch me.

70
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,776
Yeah, you like that?

71
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,712
You want to see more?

72
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,214
You can see more.

73
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,950
Is that what you want?

74
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,354
You want me to take
my clothes off?

75
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,360
You want to touch me?

76
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,828
You can touch me.

77
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,999
Is that what you want?

78
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,767
It's just a couple of days.

79
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,337
- It's three nights.

80
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,038
Four days.

81
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,581
Movie you auditioned for today,

82
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,951
where does it shoot?

83
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,020
- Um, in Colombia.

84
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,021
- The country?

85
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,623
- No, the city, in Missouri.

86
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,329
- Is it a slasher film?

87
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,700
They're, what, meth addicts?

88
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,969
Zombie meth addicts on icicles?

89
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,739
Please tell me you're
not running around naked,

90
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,574
screaming and crying.

91
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,512
You're hiding your body from me?

92
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,413
Beth.

93
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,584
You know, there's a
hundred art films.

94
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,920
If you want mine, i
can download right now,

95
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,855
where you had your
fucking clothes off.

96
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,691
You know that, right?

97
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,660
What about it?

98
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,797
Are you getting
naked again, or what?

99
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,865
- I don't know.

100
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,535
I didn't read the whole script.

101
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,085
You want me to cancel my trip?

102
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:53,985
- No.

103
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,054
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,823
I'm a jerk.

105
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,764
- I just feel like a bad friend.

106
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,133
- Hey, stop talking like that.

107
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,036
You're a good friend.

108
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,543
The two of you will go
away, have a nice time.

109
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,078
It'll be good for you.

110
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,979
What?

111
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,383
I like Anna.

112
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,384
- No you don't.

113
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,418
- I do.

114
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,587
- You think she's a bully.

115
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,856
- She's a little intense.

116
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,157
Just, the whole career
obsession thing.

117
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,025
I just don't know if it's
such a great influence

118
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,862
for you to be
around, that's all.

119
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,163
But I like Anna.

120
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,565
- You're a terrible liar.

121
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:40,565
You are.

122
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,903
Maybe that's why I trust you.

123
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,971
- You trust me?

124
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,572
- Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,875
- Big mistake. Big mistake.

126
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,681
Hey.

127
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:57,582
- Hmm?

128
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,154
- Sorry for the way i
talked to you before.

129
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,190
It wasn't nice.

130
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:11,430
Wish it didn't bother
me so much, but it does.

131
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,665
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,840
- I mean, do you think that
i like to take my clothes off

133
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:26,611
in a room full of hot
lights and total strangers?

134
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,214
- If you don't,
why do you do it?

135
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,752
- What's this?

136
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,155
The guy who gave me the
estimate said my spark plugs

137
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,824
were misfiring or something?

138
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:38,824
- Right.

139
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:42,060
Well, also, there was a problem
with your oxygen sensor,

140
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,695
but, don't worry, we took
care of that for you.

141
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,930
- Oh, you did.

142
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,666
Okay, what are you
doing right now?

143
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,469
- Ma'am?

144
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,103
- Are you lying to me?

145
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,972
Because the guy who
gave me the estimate

146
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,141
didn't say anything
about any oxygen sensor.

147
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,543
He said my spark
plugs were misfiring.

148
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,711
- Well, ma'am.

149
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,146
I apologize if that's
the case, but--

150
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,547
- what?

151
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,082
What do you mean, if?

152
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,218
I assure you that's the case.

153
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,553
- Well, I apologize
for the confusion, but--

154
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,055
- there is no confusion.

155
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,624
The guy who gave me the
estimate didn't say anything

156
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:16,595
about any, what,
fucking oxygen sensor.

157
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,096
- Well, ma'am,
the fact of the matter

158
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,967
is that oxygen sensor has
malfunctioned fairly frequently.

159
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,169
- Oh, I bet they do.

160
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,571
- I take pride in
running an honest business,

161
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,041
so I apologize if some
mistake was made here--

162
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,111
- okay, now you keep saying if.

163
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,713
A mistake was made.

164
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,648
A mistake was definitely made.

165
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,050
- Ma'am, there's no
need to raise your voice here.

166
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,285
- No?

167
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,687
I show up here expecting
to pay for one repair,

168
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,090
and there's an extra charge
for 300 fucking dollars

169
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,926
slipped in that I know
absolutely nothing about?

170
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,295
- Okay, there is no need
for that kind of language,

171
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,997
ma'am.

172
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:56,134
- Okay, well $300 is a lot
of fucking money to me,

173
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,870
so you'll excuse me if i
don't appreciate the fact

174
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,306
that you're trying to
fucking steal it from me.

175
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,141
- I'm doing no such thing.

176
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,277
Oxygen sensors
fail all the time.

177
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,145
If you've got a broken one
and you don't repair it,

178
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,180
your car's gas mileage is
gonna drop, and over time,

179
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,116
it's gonna cost you a lot more.

180
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,817
- No, no, no.

181
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,686
That's not the point.

182
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,756
The point is it wasn't
in the estimate.

183
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,991
Even if you're telling the
truth, I didn't approve

184
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,092
of the repair.

185
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,028
That's all that matters.

186
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,297
- Well, ma'am, normally
i would give the customer

187
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,132
the benefit of the
doubt, but the fact is,

188
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:30,201
I really don't
like your attitude.

189
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,236
- Oh, I'm sorry.

190
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,737
You don't like my attitude?

191
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,972
- That's right.

192
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,241
I mean, if you were a
touch more ladylike.

193
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,810
- Are you fucking kidding me?

194
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:42,147
This is your fucking
problem, not mine.

195
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,015
- I wasn't there.

196
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,283
I don't know who said what.

197
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,585
- Oh, you're just
absolving yourself

198
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,187
of any responsibility now?

199
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:49,187
Fine.

200
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,256
You know what, I'm not
gonna stand here and argue

201
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,992
with a fucking criminal.

202
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,894
I'll pay for the spark plugs,
but I'm disputing the rest

203
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,228
of the charges.

204
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,638
- Houses, apartments, condos.

205
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,341
Offices--
- Paul?

206
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,175
Whoa.

207
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,042
- Hi.

208
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,077
- Hi, how's it going?

209
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,078
- Good, how are you?

210
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,213
- You're not behind the counter.

211
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,147
Not used to that.

212
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,349
- It's my day off.

213
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,183
- Yeah, uh-huh.

214
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,250
- Where you going?

215
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,251
- Uh, camping.

216
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,086
- Yeah?

217
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:21,920
- Mm-hmm
- cool.

218
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:22,754
- Where about?

219
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:23,955
- Big sur.

220
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,190
- Big sur.
- Yeah.

221
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,257
- That's where this one's going.

222
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:26,257
Her and Anna.

223
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,893
Anna's aunt's got
a house up there.

224
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,362
Little old girls getaway.

225
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:31,329
- Like now?

226
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,331
- Yeah, just, for the weekend.

227
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,133
- Weird.

228
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,133
No, no.

229
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,938
It's funny, 'cause I was
just thinking about you

230
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,239
the other day, you know.

231
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,774
I'm doing this short,
and I was thinking

232
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,009
of using Anna.

233
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:48,246
Yeah, I would just call
her, but there's no money,

234
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,148
so I didn't wanna
like offend her.

235
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,917
Do you think she'd
be offended if?

236
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,686
Do you think she'd
do it for free?

237
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,388
- No, no, she'd probably,
she'd probably do it.

238
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,990
Yeah, she usually does whatever.

239
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,191
- Okay.

240
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,995
- Okay.

241
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,096
- Yeah.
- Cool.

242
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,231
- Maybe I'll see you up there?

243
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,298
- Yeah.

244
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,733
- Cool.

245
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,406
- You okay?

246
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,408
- Yeah, fine. I'm fine.

247
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:25,917
- She's here!

248
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,428
All right.

249
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,429
Got everything?

250
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,463
- Yeah.

251
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,464
- I'll get that.

252
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,332
- Thank you.

253
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,372
- Well, okay, but you're
not listening to me.

254
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,307
I don't have the fucking money.

255
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,809
- A
hardship letter could result

256
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,077
in lower late fees.

257
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:52,077
- No, I don't want
lower late fees!

258
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,481
I want no late fees, because
this isn't my fucking fault.

259
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:56,481
It's your fault.

260
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,750
Then we're gonna have

261
00:11:58,752 --> 00:11:59,484
to freeze your card.

262
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,119
- Well, fuck you.

263
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,431
- Um, do you want me to drive?

264
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,833
- No, it's fine.

265
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,072
- I'm really sorry about that.

266
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,140
- It's fine.

267
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,910
- Are you okay?

268
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,313
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm fine.

269
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,519
You look tired.

270
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,125
- Uh, yeah, I guess, maybe.

271
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,429
- I guess you've been
really busy, right?

272
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,765
- Not really.

273
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,438
- Okay, ready?

274
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,923
- Is your boss
still harassing you?

275
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,024
- Of course.

276
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:13,024
I'm his favorite.

277
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,426
He told me he had a dream
when he came on my tits

278
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,061
the other day, so.

279
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:20,398
- Oh my god,
you have to quit.

280
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,505
- The money's just not as good,

281
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:31,976
and I can't afford
to take

282
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:56,434
- tuxedo park, that like
rich place, the mansion.

283
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,303
- I forgot about tuxedo park.

284
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,337
- Yeah.

285
00:13:59,339 --> 00:13:59,337
- Was that where it was?

286
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,973
- Yes, don't you remember
we like thought we

287
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,042
were gonna go to this
horrible slum thing,

288
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,443
and it ended up being this
mansion, and we didn't--

289
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,145
- tuxedo park.

290
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,479
- Yes, and everybody was
actually wearing a tuxedo

291
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,514
in tuxedo park.

292
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,983
- And we had like
jeans, and nothing else.

293
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,184
- Yes, yes, yes.

294
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,152
- Him. Him.

295
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,554
- He liked me.

296
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:17,589
- Yeah, he did.

297
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:18,990
He totally did.

298
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,526
- Oh my god, when
did he tell you that?

299
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,162
- I think when I was
working at union pool.

300
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,129
- Wait a second.

301
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,631
When did you work at union pool?

302
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,634
- That time that I was
guest djing with that boy

303
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:29,634
that I liked.

304
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,237
- Who was the
boy that you liked?

305
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,471
- That guy, Steven.

306
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,373
- Oh, god, he was
such an asshole.

307
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,175
- No, he wasn't that bad.

308
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,176
- Are you?

309
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,611
He walked all over you.

310
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:39,611
- Not really.

311
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,480
- Oh, shit, I can't
believe I forgot to tell

312
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:43,915
you this.

313
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,083
I saw him before
i moved out here.

314
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,317
- You did?

315
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,319
- Yeah, he was like
sitting on the ground

316
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,355
outside the Starbucks
in union square,

317
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,358
and he had this like mustache.

318
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,627
- Well, I'm not like
necessarily against a mustache.

319
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,061
- No, no, no, no, no.

320
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,964
This was like a straggly
like wispy situation.

321
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,065
- Ew.
- - It was glazed.

322
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,066
It was horrible.

323
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,334
- Ew.

324
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,535
- I think he had a nose bleed.

325
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:04,535
- Oh my god, you're
messing with me.

326
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,205
- I think he
was just like bleeding

327
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:07,205
all over the sidewalk.

328
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:11,476
- You're totally lying,
you're totally lying to me.

329
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,311
- No, I'm pretty
sure that's what happened.

330
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,579
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

331
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,349
- Wait, so he told
you he liked me?

332
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,450
- Who, Blake.

333
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,285
- Yeah.

334
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,586
- Yes, I think so.

335
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,553
- Why didn't you tell me?

336
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,455
- I am telling you.

337
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:25,556
- Well, yeah, thanks.

338
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,658
Like five years later.

339
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,593
- I didn't know
that you liked him.

340
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,594
You really liked him?

341
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,695
- Yes.

342
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:32,664
- Whoops.

343
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,632
- I feel like you're
wrong anyways.

344
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,267
- No, I'm not.

345
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,936
- Yes, you are, and
I'm remembering sort of--

346
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:38,937
- excuse me.

347
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,372
I am so sorry to interrupt.

348
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,074
I mean, I never do
anything like this.

349
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:46,144
I'm actually a private
person, you know, myself, but,

350
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,047
haven't I seen you in something?

351
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,415
You're in TV, right?

352
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,050
- Yeah.

353
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,051
- I knew it.

354
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,052
I knew it.

355
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,354
What have I seen you in?

356
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,555
- I don't know.

357
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,589
- Oh, gosh.

358
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,590
I know it is.

359
00:15:59,592 --> 00:15:59,590
I think I know.

360
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:03,294
Oh, I know, I remember,
it's wendecalm.

361
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,396
You are so good in that.

362
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,397
- Uh, thank you.

363
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,465
- You were so good.

364
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,466
- Thanks.

365
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,667
- And so nice.

366
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,170
Do you mind if i
get your autograph?

367
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,372
Because it would
mean a lot to me.

368
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm Sandra.
- Sure.

369
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,708
Sure.

370
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,976
- Nice to meet you.

371
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,143
Here's a fountain pen.

372
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,611
I hope you like it.

373
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,247
- This is my friend, Anna.

374
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,049
She's also an actress.

375
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,251
- Have i
seen you in anything?

376
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,320
- No, I would be surprised.

377
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,756
- I am just blown away by this.

378
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,360
Do you mind if I take a photo?

379
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,594
- No, not at all.

380
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:36,594
- Oh, my god.

381
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:40,732
I'm like just so excited about
this, I can't even tell you.

382
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,767
Uh, it's right there.

383
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,503
Thank you.

384
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,774
Thank you.
- Sure.

385
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,410
- Okay, one, two, three.

386
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,491
She went away.

387
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,694
She turned the office
into a guest room,

388
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,297
so that my cousin
could stay with her.

389
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,698
- Oh, nice.

390
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,135
- Yeah, but he's
obviously not here anymore, so.

391
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,203
- Great. Perfect.

392
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,337
- Better, right?

393
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,338
- Yeah, I love it.

394
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,407
- Yeah, it's way better.

395
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,915
It's beautiful, huh?

396
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:11,816
- Hmm?

397
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:13,818
- The view.

398
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,626
- Still don't get
any reception, huh?

399
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,310
Do you remember that guy, Ryan?

400
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,879
The one whose short I did
that went to Sundance?

401
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,581
Well, he sent me
this feature script

402
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,783
he's been working on,

403
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,352
and he really wanted me to
show it to this producer

404
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,754
on that movie I shot last June.

405
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,857
I guess he like really wants
to work with this one producer,

406
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,393
and like, wanted me
to show it to him.

407
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,529
Oh, I left my shampoo in my bag.

408
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,965
Do you mind grabbing it for me?

409
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,461
Thanks.

410
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,795
- So, what did you tell him?

411
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,999
- Oh, so I told him that
i didn't have a chance.

412
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,900
Show the producers, you
know, and he was like,

413
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,435
"what do you mean you
don't have a chance?

414
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,037
"You've been on set all week."

415
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,573
And I was like, "yeah, but the
producers aren't even there

416
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,641
"every day."

417
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:18,542
I don't know.

418
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,978
I just feel like he
expects so much from me,

419
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,882
and I, I'm just getting
my feet wet, you know?

420
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,384
- Wait, what?

421
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,551
- What?

422
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,487
- You're in the united
Hollywood issue?

423
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,857
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

424
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,426
- Where did you get that?

425
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:36,827
- From your bag.

426
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,865
Why didn't you tell
me this happened?

427
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,467
- I don't know.

428
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,771
- Do you think i
wouldn't find out?

429
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:49,974
- I, I really didn't
think about it.

430
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,742
- I mean, this is crazy.

431
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,878
This is so cool.

432
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,514
I can't believe you wouldn't
have mentioned this before.

433
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:57,982
- I don't know.

434
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,819
I really, really don't
think it's that big a deal.

435
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,954
- It's a really big deal.

436
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:06,457
- I'm sorry.

437
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,860
- You don't have
to apologize to me.

438
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,496
You should just be more excited

439
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,965
when things like this happen.

440
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,738
- No, you're right.

441
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,919
You hit him?

442
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,054
- No, I mean,
i didn't hit him.

443
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,622
I like shoved him.

444
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,125
- But like, hard?

445
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,994
- Uh, well, kind of.

446
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,434
Okay, we were
standing at the bar,

447
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,870
and Josh was saying
something that I

448
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,805
like really didn't agree with,

449
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:55,806
and so I chimed in,

450
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:55,806
but obviously, it was a bar,

451
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:59,009
so I started speaking
loudly, you know what I mean?

452
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,010
- Right.

453
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,645
Oh, I'm okay.

454
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,147
Um, do you want some of this,

455
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,882
'cause it's really good.

456
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,484
- No.

457
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,685
- All right.

458
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:10,020
- Are you really
not gonna have any?

459
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,056
- Yeah, I mean, I'd like to,

460
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,792
but I just, I've been
sleeping so much better

461
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:16,427
since I stopped.

462
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,129
- I know, but it's not
like you have to get up

463
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:21,599
for an audition
tomorrow morning.

464
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,933
Come on.

465
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,468
- Okay, just a little bit.

466
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,102
A little.

467
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,003
- Okay.

468
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,138
- A little bit--

469
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,973
- these are very small glasses.

470
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,975
- That is not a little bit.

471
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,677
Um, was Henry there?

472
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,645
- Where?

473
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:35,646
What, at the bar?

474
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:35,646
- Yeah.

475
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:35,646
- No, he was the one
who encouraged me

476
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:40,785
to participate in the
conversation in the first place,

477
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,887
and so I was doing that,
i was just joining in,

478
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,655
and Josh was like,
oh, okay, just,

479
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,924
"first of all, can
you calm down?"

480
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,826
- That's so annoying.

481
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:49,760
- Right?

482
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:49,760
I mean, Jesus.

483
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:53,597
If I was a boy, no one would
be telling me to calm down.

484
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,498
- True.

485
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,135
- Oh, come on, Beth.

486
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:02,106
Has anyone ever told you
to calm down in your life?

487
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,207
Exactly.

488
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,944
Anyways, yeah,

489
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,147
so I could feel myself
getting like really upset,

490
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,082
but I stopped myself,
'cause I was like, no, no,

491
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,217
this is your
boyfriend's manager.

492
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,852
You can't like,

493
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,087
so, I walked away, 'cause
i was about to cry,

494
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,189
and,

495
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,059
then he comes after me.

496
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:22,059
- Josh did?

497
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,996
- Yes, and I'm
like, "Josh, listen.

498
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,198
"I have a really bad temper.

499
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,066
"I need you to give
me some space, okay?"

500
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:29,066
And he was like,
"yeah, yeah, yeah.

501
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,769
"Okay, fine, but you know,
you don't have to walk away

502
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,070
"like a prima Donna."

503
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,705
- Oh my god.

504
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:35,973
- Like, what?

505
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,975
And he just kept saying
that, like prima Donna,

506
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,044
prima Donna, prima Donna.

507
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,178
- That is awful.

508
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,746
- Yeah, and so, of course,

509
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,883
I started like
hysterically crying,

510
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,486
and I was so upset that yes,

511
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,121
I pushed him.

512
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,193
What? What would you do?

513
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:08,239
You wouldn't get involved
in the first place.

514
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,215
Just feel so out of control.

515
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,951
- No.

516
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,153
No, no, that's
really frustrating,

517
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,155
what happened to you.

518
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:28,959
- Yeah.

519
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:37,701
And now, Henry's shooting
a commercial in Singapore,

520
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,939
and he's letting me stay at
the house until he gets back,

521
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:44,074
but after that, I'm like.

522
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,850
No, you know what?

523
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,086
I don't know.

524
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:59,790
Henry's thinking was
like, career is important,

525
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,091
but if you're in a relationship,

526
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,327
then you have to put
that first, right?

527
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,196
But like I always knew that
i just wasn't gonna be happy

528
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:09,233
unless I accomplish
certain things first.

529
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:09,233
Like, if you want
to be an actress,

530
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,236
you have to establish
yourself before you're 30,

531
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,171
or else, you're fucked.

532
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:18,676
Plus, I really need to focus
on finding good representation.

533
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:21,812
Especially, now,
before pilot season.

534
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:30,654
God, you're so lucky to get
paid to do what you love.

535
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,192
- Yeah, I mean,
the stuff that I do

536
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,028
isn't exactly Gibson, you know?

537
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:44,301
- Yeah, but, I mean, it
beats waiting tables.

538
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,675
I've spent so much
money on head shots

539
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,745
and stupid fucking
invisible braces.

540
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,051
Stop, I'm fine.

541
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,155
Seriously, I feel good.

542
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,862
And hey, what the fuck?

543
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:16,367
It will all be over soon
enough anyways, right?

544
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,897
- Give me the keys.

545
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:47,931
- Excuse me?

546
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,099
- Give me
the keys, bitch.

547
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:49,099
- Why?

548
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:52,970
- Because you almost
just killed us like five times.

549
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,038
Come on.

550
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,049
Sazerac,

551
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,219
and speaking in tongues.

552
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,854
- Thank you.

553
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,257
- Here, no I can get us--
- no, no, no.

554
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:14,391
I got it.

555
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,192
Can we keep it open?
- No, Beth.

556
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,393
I can get my own drink--

557
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,327
- I got it, I got it.

558
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:17,327
- I can pay for my own drink.

559
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:21,865
- I know you can, but that
stupid beer commercial I did

560
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:25,069
is playing like a
hundred times a day,

561
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:25,069
and I'm making a lot of money,

562
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:29,406
and I want to buy my best
friend a drink, okay?

563
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,974
- Okay, thank you.

564
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,411
- Cheers.

565
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:35,713
- Cheers.

566
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,417
Mmm.

567
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,719
- Mmm.

568
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:48,225
I know that I haven't been
the greatest friend lately.

569
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,929
- Oh, Jesus, you're
as drunk as I am.

570
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,997
- No, I'm serious.

571
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,966
I've been a bad friend.

572
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,335
I mean, you broke
up with Henry, what,

573
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,337
like two months ago, and
i just found out today?

574
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,440
I really should have
been there for you.

575
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,142
You must hate me.

576
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,179
- I don't hate you.

577
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,917
- I really, I really
love you, Anna.

578
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,519
You know that, right?

579
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:22,025
And I'm really glad that we got
to have this weekend, alone.

580
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,194
I've really missed you.

581
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,263
- Yeah, I miss you too.

582
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,032
- And I know that like,
a lot has changed,

583
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:33,971
and you're going through
some hard stuff right now,

584
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,840
but I just, I think
you should know

585
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:40,110
that I think you are
such a beautiful,

586
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,412
wonderful person,
and you are so,

587
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:45,349
so, so talented, and I just know

588
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:48,218
that everything's gonna be fine.

589
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,294
What?

590
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,562
- No, don't look.

591
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,977
- The situation's pretty
sticky over there.

592
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,380
The Chinese actually held
me for a couple of days

593
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:19,449
on my last visit,
and, my translator

594
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:25,088
sort of was a double agent,
and kinda got me out of it.

595
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:25,989
- How?

596
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:31,094
- He just, sort of knew
what they wanted to hear.

597
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,530
- Um, cheers.

598
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:34,998
- Cheers.

599
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,934
- How did you get
the money over there?

600
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,570
- I delivered it in a suitcase.

601
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,105
- How much?

602
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:45,108
- I think it
was about 50 grand.

603
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,611
- Oh my god, that's amazing.

604
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:51,415
- Well, it's,
it's not like I,

605
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:54,284
I don't know, I've done this
kind of thing my whole life.

606
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,254
I mean, you'll
see, you get older.

607
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,422
- Oh, stop it, you're not old.

608
00:30:58,424 --> 00:30:59,423
- Really?

609
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:00,591
How old do you think I am?

610
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:01,558
- I don't know.

611
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:03,527
20.

612
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,562
- I'm 48.

613
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,565
- 48, you're a young boy.

614
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,368
- Please, I could
be your father.

615
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,204
- Well, I like men
with a little salt

616
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,339
and pepper in his hair.

617
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:16,240
- Really?

618
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:29,386
- Um, okay, well is that
like what you're doing here,

619
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,489
or is there a zendo
around here or something?

620
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,525
- Uh, well, tibetans
don't practice zen.

621
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:38,896
They belong to the
mahayana school.

622
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,198
Why? Do you practice zen?

623
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,267
- No, my ex had a phase.

624
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,636
- Oh.

625
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:46,937
Well, there is a zendo here.

626
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,640
It's, oh actually,
it's a monastery.

627
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:51,174
Tassajara, but,

628
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:57,381
I'm actually here for a
men's retreat at esalen.

629
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,517
- I know
what goes on there?

630
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,618
- You do? What?

631
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,389
- That's where you guys
like sit around a fire,

632
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:08,091
and like, bang drums, and thump
your chest, and everything,

633
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,593
right?

634
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,995
- Well, we do a little of
that, if stuff comes up.

635
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,264
- Stuff? If like stuff comes up?

636
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,098
What sort of stuff?

637
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,233
- Well, I don't know.

638
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,568
Competition.

639
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,569
- Competition?

640
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:20,604
What does that mean?

641
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,605
Like, what?

642
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,240
What sort of competition?

643
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:23,240
- You should check out
tassajara while you're here,

644
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:27,277
and maybe, spend a few
days in silent meditation.

645
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,947
- Shut up,
I'm just asking.

646
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,182
- Is she always like this?

647
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,484
- Excuse me.

648
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,354
- Your friend, is
she always so, um.

649
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:39,323
- So what?

650
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,324
- Curious?

651
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,525
- So curious?

652
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,194
I don't think that's
what you were gonna say.

653
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,664
- No, no, it's just
you're very inquisitive.

654
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,534
- I mean, I think
this is interesting.

655
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,703
You are in a group
with a bunch of guys

656
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:55,472
that if they get jealous
of you, you wrestle them.

657
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,440
Like, what?

658
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,978
- Can I get
some help over here?

659
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,446
- Oh, come on.

660
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:02,446
You can't handle just like
a couple of questions.

661
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:05,682
If I was in a woman's
group, you wouldn't be like,

662
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:09,052
hey, that's something I'd like
to know a little more about?

663
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,754
- Will you excuse
me for just a sec.

664
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,189
- Yeah.

665
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,634
- I should, I should
probably get going.

666
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,070
I have gotta get up at the
ass crack of dawn tomorrow

667
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,706
for a men's hike,
but, excuse me.

668
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,444
I am taking off.

669
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,313
I'd like to buy this
young lady a drink.

670
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,148
What were you drinking?

671
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,583
- Uh, I guess I'll
get another sazerac.

672
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:43,754
- Sazerac, and
what was Beth drinking?

673
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:45,422
I can't remember.

674
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,658
- Uh, it was like a
speaking in tongues.

675
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,294
- Speaking in tongues,

676
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,295
and a speaking in tongues.

677
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,263
That should be plenty.

678
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,164
Thank you.

679
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,067
But, it's really
nice meeting you.

680
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:57,768
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,805
Anna.
- Anna.

682
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,408
I'm sorry.

683
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,810
Very nice to meet you, Anna.

684
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,147
- Yeah, go, warm up.

685
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:13,650
- Good night.

686
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,519
- Bye.

687
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,668
- Hey, it's me.

688
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,670
I'm just checking in.

689
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,274
You're asleep.

690
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:42,746
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
that I really, really love you,

691
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:43,847
and I miss you.

692
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,718
There's no reception at the
house, so if I don't answer,

693
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,254
that's why, but I love you.

694
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,124
Okay.

695
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,793
I love you.

696
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:57,694
Bye.

697
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,121
- Hey, you.

698
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,722
I was wondering where
you snuck off to.

699
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:28,458
- Oh, I was just making a call.

700
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,193
- The reception
really sucks out here.

701
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:31,261
- Yeah.

702
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,863
- It's the mountains.

703
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,801
Listen, I was wondering
if, I don't know,

704
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:42,339
would you be interested in
maybe getting a drink sometime?

705
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,607
- Oh, uh.

706
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,742
I mean, I'm here with my friend.

707
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,911
- No, I mean, back in la.

708
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,847
- Oh, right. Obviously.

709
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,784
- Or, we could,
we can get dinner.

710
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,753
I have, a friend of mine, bill,

711
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,555
they just opened up this
place, in abakany, that,

712
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:02,459
it's nice, the chef's
kaiser michelin star.

713
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:04,928
Um, how would next Friday work?

714
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:07,797
- Um.

715
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,900
Sure.

716
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:11,635
- Okay.

717
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,871
Um, can I get your number?

718
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,907
- Oh, yeah.

719
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:39,816
Morning.

720
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,565
- What's that?

721
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:58,034
- Oh, it's just
this stupid script.

722
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,336
So stupid.

723
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,505
- What is it?

724
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:02,505
- It's this,

725
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,643
it's just a really
dumb horror movie.

726
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,011
- Another one?

727
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,112
- Yeah, I know.

728
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,350
This one is especially stupid.

729
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,418
It's embarrassing.

730
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,953
- What's it about?

731
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,054
- Um,

732
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,590
it's nothing.

733
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:23,827
It's just, um.

734
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,497
- It's about nothing?

735
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:28,932
- It's about stones.

736
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:33,002
It's set in Iceland, where,
i guess, they have this

737
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:36,873
whole mythology where
stones turn into trolls,

738
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:41,111
but it's a red herring,
because it's a serial killer,

739
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,482
only you think it's
trolls for a while.

740
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,952
- This is something
Adele gave you?

741
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:50,453
- Um, it's, yeah.

742
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,791
I mean, it's really terrible.

743
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,861
- Okay, but, she
wants you to do it?

744
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,732
- I think so.

745
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,835
- Why?

746
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,504
- Um, I don't know.

747
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,806
It's bigger.

748
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,708
- Yeah, but why
does she want you to do it?

749
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,944
- I guess, because
I'm in every scene.

750
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,549
- It's the lead?

751
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,785
- I guess.

752
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:24,053
I mean, yeah, yeah.

753
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:26,623
Also, also, it's against type.

754
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,126
What's your type?

755
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,061
- I don't know.

756
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:35,198
- What, like the
wilting flower type?

757
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,067
- I guess.

758
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,705
- And what's this?

759
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,107
- Uh,

760
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,142
I don't know, like
sassy, I guess.

761
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,644
It's really so bad.

762
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:47,644
It's so bad.

763
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,682
- You have to take
your clothes off?

764
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,584
- What do you think?

765
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:55,985
- Jesus, again.

766
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,520
- I know.

767
00:40:57,522 --> 00:41:01,157
I know, it's like the
tenth time in two years.

768
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,465
- You ever feel like a whore?

769
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,800
- Um.

770
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:17,474
I don't know, yeah,
sometimes, a little.

771
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,480
I wanted to tell you,

772
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:26,616
I sent the link to
your reel, to Adele.

773
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:27,750
- You did?

774
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,919
When did you send it?

775
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:33,223
- Um, I don't know,
like a while ago.

776
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:34,190
- Like what?

777
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,658
Like, a month ago?

778
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,061
- Yeah, maybe two weeks ago.

779
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,531
I don't know why you want
to work with her, though.

780
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:45,168
I mean, they send me
out on the worst stuff.

781
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,873
- It must be nice not
being all alone, though.

782
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,174
Like to have somebody
besides yourself

783
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,243
invested in your career.

784
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,715
- I mean, yeah, I guess,
when you put it that way.

785
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:01,718
- What other way
is there to put it?

786
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,957
You want to run it?

787
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:07,957
- What, this?

788
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,593
- No, let's do some other
script we were talking about.

789
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,529
- No, not really.

790
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,030
- Maybe I can help.

791
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,031
There's really no point.

792
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,901
I'm totally wrong for it.

793
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:19,135
- Come on.

794
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,570
It'll be fun.

795
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:23,606
We never get to act
together anymore.

796
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:24,307
Okay.

797
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,312
I think it's time we started
to think outside the box.

798
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:31,247
- Outside the box?

799
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:31,247
- Yeah.

800
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,918
- I've never even
understood what that means.

801
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,152
- Outside the box?

802
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,187
It means to like think
in a different way.

803
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:38,187
- Really?

804
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,258
- This isn't the time
for sarcasm, sharlene.

805
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,193
We're stuck out here in the
middle of the arctic tundra,

806
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:46,129
freezing our asses off.

807
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,597
Our thermos is almost empty.

808
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,998
I've had to pee
for like six hours,

809
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:48,998
but I'm afraid to go,

810
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,135
because I think the pee
might freeze inside my dick.

811
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:53,136
- You have a dick?

812
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:55,572
I thought you were a dick.

813
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,575
- Really?

814
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,345
That's how you're
gonna say the line?

815
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:06,282
Jesus, Beth, no wonder
you keep getting typecast.

816
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,584
You're supposed to
be sassy, right?

817
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,085
So, be sassy.

818
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,320
- I don't even want the part.

819
00:43:10,322 --> 00:43:11,321
- Oh, bullshit.

820
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:13,656
Just be fucking sassy.

821
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:14,724
What the fuck? It's easy.

822
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:16,359
Here, you be the guy.

823
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:23,633
- I think it's time we started
to think outside the box.

824
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:24,867
- Outside the box?

825
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,235
- Yep.

826
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,771
- I've never even
understood what that means.

827
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,006
- Outside the box.

828
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:31,341
It means like to think
in a different way.

829
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:32,709
- Oh, really?

830
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,313
- This isn't the time
for sarcasm, sharlene.

831
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,315
We're stuck out here in the
middle of the arctic tundra,

832
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,284
freezing our asses off.

833
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,753
Our thermos is almost empty.

834
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:45,321
I've had to pee
for like six hours,

835
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:45,321
but I'm afraid to go,

836
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:48,891
because I think the pee
might freeze inside my dick.

837
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:50,026
- Oh, you have a dick?

838
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:52,695
I thought you just were a dick.

839
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:54,130
- Is that helpful?

840
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,766
- Was it helpful when
you dragged me out here

841
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,135
on this so-called adventure?

842
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,269
Was it helpful when
you ate all the food,

843
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:03,640
like a fucking pig,
four hours ago?

844
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,744
- I offered you a bite.

845
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,281
- You're a fucking retard.

846
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,319
- That's not PC.

847
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,323
- You think I give
a shit about PC?

848
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,293
We're gonna die out here.

849
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:27,196
Do you get that,
you piece of shit?

850
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:31,267
We're going to die, and
it's your fucking fault!

851
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,337
You're life is over.

852
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,072
My life is over.

853
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:37,940
We are gonna freeze
to fucking death

854
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:40,043
in the fucking freezing tundra,

855
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:42,445
and it's your fucking fault!

856
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,853
That's how you play sassy.

857
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,026
Let's go for a hike.

858
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,727
Is that Matt Dickinson?

859
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,397
- Hey.

860
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,100
- Hi.
- - Hi, how are you?

861
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:38,134
- Good, how are you?

862
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:41,437
- I was wondering if i
was gonna bump into you guys.

863
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,472
- What?

864
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:44,307
What are you doing here?

865
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:47,009
- You didn't tell her?

866
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:48,911
Am I that unmemorable?

867
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,015
No, I just bumped
into Beth at capecita,

868
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:54,417
and mentioned i
was coming up here.

869
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,518
- Oh.

870
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,455
No, she didn't
mention that at all.

871
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,157
What are you doing here?

872
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:04,460
- Uh, well, I'm hiking, but
I'm also location scouting

873
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:06,929
for this experimental
short I'm doing.

874
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:06,929
- Oh.

875
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,499
- I was telling Beth that
i wanted to talk to you

876
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,768
about maybe being in it.

877
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,403
- Oh.

878
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:15,404
Uh, cool.

879
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:16,439
- Yeah, yeah.

880
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,208
It's super low budget, but,

881
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,477
you really didn't mention this?

882
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:21,477
- Yeah, what are
you trying to do?

883
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:25,548
Keep me from getting
cast in things?

884
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,416
You should just cast Beth.

885
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:28,451
Everyone else does.

886
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,452
- Oh, yeah.

887
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:30,887
I know, right?

888
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:31,854
Beth's way too big
time for us now.

889
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:36,192
- Yep, well, anyways,
thanks for thinking of me.

890
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:37,226
That's awesome.

891
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,427
- Yeah, no.

892
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,196
Figured, I don't know,
it'd be something

893
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:42,198
that you'd be up for.

894
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,399
- Yeah.

895
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:43,399
- Mm-hmm.

896
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,468
- Paul said he saw
your last short online,

897
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,470
and it was interesting.

898
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,373
You're really lucky.

899
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,245
- Have you been to
big sur bakery yet?

900
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:58,147
- No, do
they have cookies.

901
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,515
- Uh, yeah, they have
really good cookies.

902
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:01,217
They also have
really good dinner.

903
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:02,251
- Awesome.

904
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,319
Yeah, I'll have to try that.

905
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:04,487
- Where are you staying?

906
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,322
- This
really fancy place,

907
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,857
super in the middle of nowhere.

908
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:08,925
Just opened up.

909
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,193
- Oh, what's it called?

910
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:11,427
- It's called
a tent in the woods.

911
00:47:13,565 --> 00:47:15,164
What about you all?

912
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,933
- I'm staying at
my aunt's house.

913
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:18,835
It's, do you know
the area at all?

914
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:20,336
- Yeah.

915
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,139
- Okay, it's just off the
road, near big sur station.

916
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:25,608
- Oh, pfeiffer Ridge?

917
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,976
- Yeah.

918
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:28,845
Well, sycamore canyon,
but yeah, yeah.

919
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,379
You do know the area.

920
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,915
- Can I talk to
you for a second?

921
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:33,616
- Uh, now?

922
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,484
- Yeah.

923
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:38,554
- Okay.

924
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,527
Um, well, I guess I have to go.

925
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,528
- Is she okay?

926
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,096
- Yeah.

927
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:49,632
I mean, I'm sure she'll be fine.

928
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:52,869
- Okay.

929
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:56,172
Yeah, well, I'll
give you a call.

930
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:57,440
Think I have your number.

931
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:57,440
- Yeah.

932
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:59,609
I mean, I know we're
Facebook friends, so...

933
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:01,010
- Right.

934
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:02,612
So, if I don't have
your number, I'll just--

935
00:48:02,614 --> 00:48:04,580
- yeah, right. Yeah.

936
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:05,915
I'm really sorry about her--

937
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:07,116
- oh, no. Of course.

938
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,384
Go, go, go.
- Okay, bye.

939
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,518
- Bye.

940
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:36,679
- What is it?

941
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:39,682
- It's just.

942
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,421
- What?

943
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:49,191
- I just never seen someone
look at me with so much disgust?

944
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:56,132
I just, I just realized
how much you hate me,

945
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:01,604
and I, I feel really sad
about our friendship.

946
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,555
- Hey, you all right?

947
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:53,723
- Yeah. Yeah.

948
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,158
- You sure?
- Yeah.

949
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,727
- You don't want a lift?

950
00:49:57,729 --> 00:50:00,629
- No, I'm not going that far.

951
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:01,530
I'm fine.

952
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,599
- I'm not
gonna do anything.

953
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:04,700
I'm just trying to be nice.

954
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:06,635
Where you going?

955
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:07,737
- Um.

956
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,707
Sycamore canyon.

957
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,743
- That's not close.

958
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:17,079
That's five miles down the road.

959
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:20,249
Come on, it's gonna get cold.

960
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:21,150
Come on.

961
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,786
Hey, it's okay.

962
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,328
Nice place.

963
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:39,862
- Hello, hello.

964
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,331
- Hello.

965
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,566
- Hello. Paul?

966
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,569
Yes, yes.

967
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:47,770
Can you hear me?

968
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,707
Can you hear me?

969
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:54,610
Paul.

970
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:56,178
Hold on.

971
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,380
I'm gonna call you back
from the land line, okay?

972
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:00,716
Please, don't go anywhere.

973
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,132
This weekend's a
fucking disaster.

974
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,766
Honey, can you speak up?

975
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,537
- No, I am telling you,
she fucking hates me.

976
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,672
She thinks that I have
this like amazing career,

977
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,175
and that I purposely
fucked her over.

978
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:27,409
Beth, can you speak up?

979
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:28,644
- No, I can't speak up.

980
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,546
I don't know if
she's here or not.

981
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:30,546
I can't hear you.

982
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:34,383
- Uh, she thinks I fucked
her over on purpose.

983
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:36,585
- Why does
she think you fucked her over?

984
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:39,855
- Because I didn't tell
her about Matt's thing.

985
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:40,856
- What thing?

986
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,825
- The thing. The short.

987
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,327
Matt's thing, Matt's short film.

988
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,296
- What?

989
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,798
- It doesn't matter.

990
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,834
It's mainly the
thing with Adele.

991
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,502
What thing with Adele?

992
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,772
- Oh my god, do you even listen
to me when I talk to you?

993
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,707
She wanted me to
send Adele her reel?

994
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,543
Don't you remember
me telling you that?

995
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:01,810
- Right, yeah.

996
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:01,810
You thought it was too soon.

997
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:04,747
- Exactly, and I was
going to send it,

998
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:07,917
but I had only been with
Adele for like three months,

999
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:09,585
and she wanted me to
send Adele the link

1000
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:13,489
to her awful fucking website,
and I was going to do it,

1001
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:15,824
but then she got so crazy
and intense about it,

1002
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:18,761
so then, I just told
her that I had sent it.

1003
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:19,929
- I
really don't understand

1004
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:22,364
why you do stuff like that.

1005
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,633
- I was going to send it.

1006
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,368
Yeah, well, why lie?

1007
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,337
- Could you not give me
the third degree right now?

1008
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:31,640
I am telling you, she's acting
completely fucking crazy.

1009
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:32,641
- You
sure you don't want me

1010
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:33,876
to come up there and get you?

1011
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:34,777
- No. No.

1012
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:37,780
I'll just check into
a hotel or something.

1013
00:53:37,782 --> 00:53:40,716
I just, this is all because
i got cast in a couple

1014
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,918
of terrible fucking movies
that I didn't even want

1015
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,853
to be in in the first place.

1016
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:45,888
Let me come get you.

1017
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,489
- No.

1018
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:48,657
- I'll come
get you after my meeting.

1019
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:49,992
- I just.

1020
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:53,629
Why can't she just
be happy for me?

1021
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:56,832
I just am trying so
hard to be nice to her,

1022
00:53:56,834 --> 00:54:00,402
even though she's so
disgusting and desperate.

1023
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,405
I mean, she knows that i
think she's a better actress

1024
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,306
than I am.

1025
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:06,842
I just happen to have
a fucking certain look

1026
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:09,812
that people like right now.

1027
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:11,814
- Beth.

1028
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,850
- I have to go.

1029
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:21,957
- You think I'm
desperate and disgusting?

1030
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,960
You're fucking pathetic.

1031
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,999
Jesus, you act so
fucking innocent.

1032
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,636
But you're not.

1033
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:37,606
I mean, you're a
fucking liar, right?

1034
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,675
Tell me, does it get
tiring just pretending

1035
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:42,978
to be so fucking
helpless all the time?

1036
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:48,017
God, you think you're
so much better than me.

1037
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:49,718
You're not.

1038
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,692
You're a fucking phony,
and a narcissist,

1039
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:59,495
and a horrible fucking friend.

1040
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:00,763
You can't even
help me get a part

1041
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:03,432
in a fucking avant-garde short?

1042
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,404
What?

1043
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:09,705
Yes, cry, Beth.

1044
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:10,506
Cry.

1045
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,643
Fake fucking crocodile tears.

1046
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,078
You fake fucking Hollywood cunt.

1047
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,003
- Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

1048
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:17,039
I'm on my way up.

1049
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,876
I have no idea
where I'm going, so,

1050
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:23,078
can you please call me back?

1051
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,904
- Just whenever you're ready.

1052
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,809
This is my second
day in big sur,

1053
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:55,844
and I'm standing there
with this like woman

1054
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:57,412
who wants to make
sure that the death

1055
01:01:57,414 --> 01:02:00,482
of her like chihuahua
has been avenged.

1056
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,252
You want a refill?

1057
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,355
- No, I'm okay. Thank you.

1058
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,458
Um, no, I just.

1059
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,126
I shouldn't, i
don't really drink.

1060
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:12,360
- What are you talking about?

1061
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:13,428
You have, you just
had a cocktail.

1062
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:14,730
- Yes.

1063
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,301
Um, I just won't be able
to sleep if I have more

1064
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:20,402
than one.

1065
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:26,174
- You think I'm trying
to get you drunk?

1066
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:27,409
I'm not trying to get you drunk.

1067
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:28,744
I took a vow of
celibacy for the month,

1068
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:31,813
so you're totally safe with me.

1069
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:35,751
Seriously, no sex, no
masturbation, nothing.

1070
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,387
I'm basically like a monk.

1071
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,224
I'm not trying to, I'm sorry.

1072
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:45,927
I don't mean to be pushy, I'm
just enjoying talking to you.

1073
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:49,998
Well, do you want
to keep hanging out?

1074
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,500
I have, um,

1075
01:02:51,502 --> 01:02:53,135
I close out in 30 minutes.

1076
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:54,903
I was thinking, maybe
you want to go swimming.

1077
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:57,372
I know a place we could
go night swimming.

1078
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:58,273
- Oh.

1079
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,810
- Remember,
this is like a monk.

1080
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:04,479
- Shut up.

1081
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:08,143
- Get up.

1082
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,081
Get up, I want to
show you something.

1083
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,968
Wait, stay still.

1084
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,002
What are you doing?

1085
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,037
You gotta give me a pose.

1086
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:39,374
First of all, you can't be
moving around like that.

1087
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,976
You can't be moving
around like that.

1088
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:43,144
You gotta give me a pose.

1089
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,215
That's the pose
you're gonna give me?

1090
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,650
That is not a pose.

1091
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:50,652
What's the matter?

1092
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:52,587
Are you feeling self conscious?

1093
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:53,989
Stay. Like this.

1094
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,524
This is great.

1095
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,527
Just like that, stay like that.

1096
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:00,395
Oh, yes.

1097
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,965
You look like an angel.

1098
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,386
So, you're an actor.

1099
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:25,453
That's cool.

1100
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,494
- Well, the stuff I do
is not exactly

1101
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:33,395
you know?

1102
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:36,398
- I actually don't,

1103
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,067
'cause I don't
know what that is.

1104
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:42,504
You have any like gigs
coming up, or anything?

1105
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:44,406
Anything interesting?

1106
01:05:44,408 --> 01:05:45,307
- No.

1107
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,343
- Really?
- No, nothing.

1108
01:05:48,345 --> 01:05:51,680
- It seems
like maybe you do.

1109
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:54,449
- I there's this stupid movie.

1110
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,252
It's so stupid.

1111
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:01,122
- What's it called?

1112
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,059
- It's called the stones.

1113
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:06,528
It's really so dumb.

1114
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:08,563
It's this dumb horror movie.

1115
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:11,566
- I like horror movies.

1116
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:14,369
Really, that's my
favorite kind of movie.

1117
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:16,204
What is this one?

1118
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:17,339
- It's, it's,

1119
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,675
this one is especially stupid.

1120
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:22,544
It's, embarrassing.

1121
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:27,716
- Try me.

1122
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:29,317
What's it about?

1123
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,320
- It's about stones.

1124
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:36,224
- What about 'em?

1125
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:38,393
- It's about stones.

1126
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:40,628
It's, I don't know,
set in Iceland,

1127
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,664
where, I guess, they
have this weird mythology

1128
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,601
where stones turn into
trolls, or something,

1129
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,204
only that's a red
herring, because, really,

1130
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:52,774
it's this serial killer,
but, for a while,

1131
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,678
you think it is trolls,
and, I don't know.

1132
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,714
It's, I told you,
it's so embarrassing.

1133
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:00,749
- I like it.

1134
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,386
I think it sounds
good, and I'm sure

1135
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:06,087
that you're gonna
be great in it,

1136
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:08,390
and then it'll come
out, and be a big hit,

1137
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:12,093
and I can tell all my
friends I know a movie star.

1138
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:13,261
- Just
whenever you're ready.

1139
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,063
- Oh, thanks.

1140
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,665
- Oh, i
forgot to tell you.

1141
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:18,800
Lucinda's band is playing
this weekend in monterey,

1142
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:21,136
and a bunch of us
are driving up.

1143
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:22,637
I don't know if
you're interested.

1144
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,543
Don't you ever get tired

1145
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:31,279
of pretending to be so helpless?

1146
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,349
- Hey! Where you going?

1147
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:35,784
What are you doing?

1148
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,822
What's the matter with you?

1149
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:43,158
You're jealous of Violet?

1150
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:46,061
There's nothing
going on with Violet.

1151
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:47,429
We fucked like a year ago.

1152
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:49,431
Like a couple times.

1153
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:52,167
There's five girls in this town.

1154
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:54,803
It's very flattering.

1155
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:00,442
You gonna get over this?

1156
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:02,243
She's not looking at us, right?

1157
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,745
Is she over there?

1158
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:06,815
All right.

1159
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,784
It's very flattering.

1160
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,853
I have a big day
planned for us, though.

1161
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:13,088
Okay?

1162
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,122
I got the day off.

1163
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:16,691
I want to take you to a party.

1164
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,827
It's very sweet.

1165
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:19,794
You got jealous.

1166
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:09,777
- I don't want
to go back to la.

1167
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,879
- Why not?

1168
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:14,883
- Just terrible there.

1169
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,253
- So stay here.

1170
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:25,360
- What would I do?

1171
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,463
- I don't know.

1172
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,365
Figure it out.

1173
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:31,399
- I could have a garden.

1174
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:32,901
- You could.

1175
01:09:32,903 --> 01:09:33,902
You like gardening?

1176
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:33,902
- Mm-hmm.

1177
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,574
I like being outside in the sun.

1178
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,211
In the rain, and.

1179
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,682
- You like fog?

1180
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,350
There's a lot of fog.

1181
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,186
- That sounds nice.

1182
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:54,289
Being in a garden in the fog.

1183
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,260
'Cause I like to cook.

1184
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:00,495
- Mmm.

1185
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:04,766
I like to eat, so, you
see how that worked out?

1186
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:06,267
- Mm-hmm.

1187
01:10:06,269 --> 01:10:09,337
- We're
made for each other.

1188
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,925
- Are you
talking about me or the beer?

1189
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:32,694
- Matt, it's Paul.

1190
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:35,897
Beth's boyfriend.

1191
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,667
Uh, I'm in big sur, and...

1192
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:45,406
I can't seem to get
in touch with Beth.

1193
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,663
- Yeah, hi!

1194
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:14,302
What is this?

1195
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:16,904
- It's my costume.

1196
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:17,939
- It's beautiful, hi.

1197
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:20,475
Come on, come on in.

1198
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:21,876
Boy, I thought you
were gonna be a pig.

1199
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:23,044
- I got it
at a thrift store.

1200
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:24,445
I am a pig.

1201
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,046
- But you
don't look like a pig.

1202
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:25,847
- Wait, wait.

1203
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:26,581
I'm a capitalist pig.

1204
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:26,581
Hold on.

1205
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:26,581
- No, you're like
that handsome dude in a tux.

1206
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:30,018
- No, no, no,
I'm a capitalist pig.

1207
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:30,718
Look. Look.

1208
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,688
- All right, you're
a capitalist pig.

1209
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:36,357
Wait, I gotta, hold, hold on.

1210
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:36,357
- I'm like a robber baron.

1211
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:38,393
- Joplin come
down and see Jesse.

1212
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:39,394
Yeah, he's a pig.

1213
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:42,330
- Bring it in. My man.

1214
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,435
- Mom, can
i get my costume on?

1215
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:48,803
- Yeah, yeah,
if you're quick, though.

1216
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:49,971
I'm starving.

1217
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:49,971
- Cool, let's do it.

1218
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:53,975
- Don't give
Jesse a hard time.

1219
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:56,678
Okay, red is okay?

1220
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,049
- So, how long have the two
of you been going out for?

1221
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:03,017
- Oh, we just met yesterday.

1222
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:05,586
- Yeah, has he painted
your picture yet?

1223
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:06,487
- Oh, god, Jack.

1224
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:08,089
Don't listen to him.

1225
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:09,957
He's just jealous because Jesse

1226
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:12,360
brought such a pretty girl
home, and he's tired of me,

1227
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:13,861
because I'm old.

1228
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:14,929
- Yep.

1229
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:18,599
- Holy crap.

1230
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:21,636
Holy crap, it's Frankenstein!

1231
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,675
- Save me! Save me!

1232
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:30,945
Oh my god! Oh no,
I'm gonna faint.

1233
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:31,946
Uh, I can't breathe.

1234
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,114
I can't, I can't.

1235
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:34,048
Oh, no, no.

1236
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:36,651
He's choking me!

1237
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,688
Wait, wait, somebody, someone.

1238
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,094
And I'm back from the dead,
and now, I'm gonna kill you!

1239
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:48,930
And then, I'm gonna
make you set the table.

1240
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:50,531
To help mommy.

1241
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:54,702
That's what happens to monsters
who kill their mothers.

1242
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:55,570
- Joplin.

1243
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:00,908
- Thank you, universe,
for your bounty, beauty,

1244
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,510
and your love.

1245
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:05,680
- That was really good.

1246
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:06,581
Very nice.

1247
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,751
So tell me, what's her deal?

1248
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:10,952
- What's her deal?

1249
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:12,086
- What, is that?

1250
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:13,554
Is that a bad question?

1251
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:13,554
- A little bit.

1252
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,090
- I'm just trying
to get to know the girl.

1253
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:17,458
- The girl?

1254
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,659
Now, you're really
putting your foot in it.

1255
01:13:18,661 --> 01:13:19,994
She's a woman.
- It's fine.

1256
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:21,763
- Oh my god, okay.

1257
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,064
The woman, I'm sorry.

1258
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:25,133
The last time I saw
him, he was like,

1259
01:13:25,135 --> 01:13:28,035
"listen, man, I'm
gonna become a monk,"

1260
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:31,472
so now, you're here, and
my curiosity is peaked.

1261
01:13:31,474 --> 01:13:33,040
- Summer, lay off.

1262
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:35,977
Lay off.

1263
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:37,979
- Oh my,
lay off of what?

1264
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:40,148
I'm just talking to, I'm
trying to get to know her?

1265
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:41,416
- What information?

1266
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:43,818
- I don't know, the basics.

1267
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:47,054
- Just basics.
- - She's an actress.

1268
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:47,955
- Really?

1269
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:51,592
- Mm-hmm.

1270
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:54,796
- Summer used
to be an actress.

1271
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:55,797
- It was another lifetime.

1272
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:56,831
I was really bad.

1273
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:57,832
- So.

1274
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,133
Acting is acting.

1275
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:00,802
She used to Shakespeare
and everything.

1276
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:00,802
She's really good.

1277
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:04,138
- Thank you, and you are next,
if you don't eat your food.

1278
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,574
I'm sorry, that was sweet.

1279
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:09,710
So, do you like it?

1280
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:10,611
Acting?

1281
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,847
- Uh, I don't.

1282
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,015
Yeah, I guess.

1283
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:15,750
- Yeah?

1284
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:17,885
You must be really brave?

1285
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:21,088
- No, I'm not brave.

1286
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,590
- No, I think so.

1287
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,197
- Anybody want more wine?

1288
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:29,197
- Yeah, I'll get it.

1289
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,098
- No, no,
no, I'll get it.

1290
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,567
I'll get it.

1291
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:33,501
- No, no, it's fine.
- - You sure?

1292
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:35,503
- Out back, on the cooler.

1293
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:54,188
- Do you ever feel like a whore?

1294
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:20,147
- Are you okay?

1295
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:21,249
- Huh? Yeah.

1296
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:24,185
- Let me
see. Let me see.

1297
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:25,219
What happened?

1298
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:32,159
Does it really hurt?

1299
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:33,160
- I don't know.

1300
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:33,160
It's nothing.

1301
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:35,663
I think there was just
some broken glass.

1302
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,198
- Here.

1303
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,199
- Thanks.

1304
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:38,199
- Does it hurt?

1305
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,601
I'm gonna put some
pressure on it.

1306
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:41,836
- No, no,
it's okay, it's okay.

1307
01:15:41,838 --> 01:15:44,038
- I feel like
I'm not showing you

1308
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,106
a good time.

1309
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:54,682
I really wasn't expecting
to like you this much.

1310
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:00,721
You know, when we first
met, when I gave you a lift,

1311
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,156
I thought you were a
snob, but for some reason,

1312
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:05,059
I just kept thinking about you.

1313
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,795
Then you came into the bar, and,

1314
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:11,599
I was glad.

1315
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,305
And, I think you're
really great.

1316
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,208
I think you're soft, and,

1317
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:24,078
sweet.

1318
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:33,187
I feel like you really
understand me, or something.

1319
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:35,756
I feel like I could want that.

1320
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:43,698
You're just a really
special person, Beth.

1321
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:17,191
- What!

1322
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:20,061
- You pretend to
be so fucking helpless,

1323
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:22,329
but you're actually
a fucking liar.

1324
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:24,198
- What do
you want from me?

1325
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,866
- I bet you think
you're better than me, huh?

1326
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,201
But you're not.

1327
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:29,303
- Please, please.

1328
01:18:29,305 --> 01:18:29,303
- You're self-obsessed,

1329
01:18:29,305 --> 01:18:32,306
and you are a horrible
fucking friend!

1330
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:33,708
- Tell me what
you want from me,

1331
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,709
and I will pay it!

1332
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:36,744
I don't know what you want!

1333
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:38,079
- That's right, cry.

1334
01:18:38,081 --> 01:18:40,181
Cry, you fucking bitch.

1335
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:42,416
Fake fucking crocodile tears

1336
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:45,486
from your fake fucking
Hollywood cunt.
