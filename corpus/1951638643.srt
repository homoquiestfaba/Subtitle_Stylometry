1
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:28,371
Mutants. Since the discovery
of their existence,

2
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:33,659
they have been regarded
with fear, suspicion, often hatred.

3
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:36,002
Across the planet debate rages.

4
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:39,500
Are mutants the next link
in the evolutionary chain?

5
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:45,174
Or simply a new species of humanity,
fighting for their share of the world?

6
00:00:45,307 --> 00:00:48,307
Either way, it is an historical fact

7
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:54,355
sharing the world has never been
humanity's defining attribute.

8
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:39,234
"We are not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies."

9
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:44,700
"Though passion may have strained,
it must not break the bonds of our affection."

10
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:49,736
Lincoln said that in his first inaugural
address as our nation's 16th president.

11
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:52,363
It's one of my favourites.

12
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,838
SO, if you'll please have your tickets ready,
we can begin the tour.

13
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:06,717
Jackie, could you clear my schedule this evening?
I wanna have dinner with my son.

14
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,127
Yes, Mr President.

15
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,832
Excuse me, sir. Are you lost?

16
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,047
Perimeter breach at visitors' checkpoint.

17
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:58,308
Multiple subjects.

18
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:02,224
Mr President, security breach. Jackie, leave.
Let's get him out to the car.

19
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,987
Exits not clear.
We don't know how many they are.

20
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:08,107
Both sides secure.

21
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,951
- Something's in the corridor.
- To the shelter.

22
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,201
Negative! Not clear.

23
00:03:28,304 --> 00:03:32,597
- It's outside the Oval Office.
- Lock this place down.

24
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,109
Don't shoot!

25
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:17,934
My God.

26
00:06:56,346 --> 00:07:01,054
Neanderthals. We once believed that
they were wiped out by years of conflict

27
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:05,395
with the much more advanced branch
of humanity called Cro-Magnon man,

28
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:11,689
but recent research into our DNA suggests
that these two species may have interbred,

29
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,069
evolving into modern humans.
In other words, into what?

30
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:17,653
- Us.
- Us. Right.

31
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,690
Artie.

32
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:22,286
Not here.

33
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:31,625
Come on. Pay attention.

34
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:48,728
...makes me insane when she does this...

35
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:53,059
What are you looking at? Sick...

36
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,486
To the shelter.

37
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,821
They're gonna kill him.

38
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,748
Jean? You OK?

39
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:12,713
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

40
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,709
It's just uh... just a headache.

41
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:20,251
It's not just a headache, is it?

42
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:24,171
Listen, uh, I wasn't really sure how to say this,
but you know ever since Liberty Island you've been...

43
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:27,096
- Scott.
- You've been different.

44
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:31,971
My telepathy's been off lately.
I can't focus. I can hear everything.

45
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:37,529
Jean, it's not just your telepathy. A month ago you had to concentrate just to levitate a book or a chair across the room.

46
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:42,151
Now when you have a nightmare
the entire bedroom shakes.

47
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,617
My dreams are getting worse.

48
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,672
Scott,

49
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:53,452
I keep feeling
something terrible's about to happen.

50
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:01,124
I would never let anything happen to you.

51
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:04,381
Hey, have you guys seen Bobby and Rogue?

52
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,258
Something's happening in the food court.

53
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:10,885
- My brother asked you a simple question.
- Why are you being such a dick?

54
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:12,979
Yeah, why are you being such a dick?

55
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:15,064
Because I can.

56
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,985
Can I have a light?

57
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:25,992
- Sorry. Can't help you out, pal.
- John, knock it off.

58
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:28,908
- Why don't you stop showing off?
- Uh, for her?

59
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,124
- I can't help it if your girl friend's getting excited.
- I don't think she's getting excited.

60
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:37,246
- Don't get shook up, We're trying to have a good time here, all right?
- I think you're the only one having a good time.

61
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,506
That's real cute, man.

62
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:43,462
What are you gonna do?

63
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:47,839
Suddenly you're not so tough.

64
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:23,433
Hello!
Honey, can you hear me?

65
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:34,312
Bobby, what did you do?

66
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:36,230
I didn't do this.

67
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:38,646
No. I did.

68
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:51,409
And the next time
you feel like showing off, don't.

69
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:58,334
- Breaking news.
- We're coming to you live from Washington,

70
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:01,796
where there's been an attack
in the Oval Office of the White House.

71
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:07,299
Details are still coming in, but we have been informed
that the President and vice President were not harmed.

72
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,466
Sources say the attack involved
one or more mutants...

73
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,977
- I think it's time to leave, Professor.
- I think you're right.

74
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:29,618
- In my opinion, Magneto's behind this.
- No, I don't think so, Scott.

75
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:32,869
While Eric's capable of organizing
something like this from prison,

76
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:37,120
for him it would be irrational,
it will only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity.

77
00:11:37,252 --> 00:11:40,952
- You mean superiority.
- You're right, if Eric had his way.

78
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:45,632
And of course, he knows how the Government will
respond, they will reintroduce the Registration Act.

79
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,004
Or worse.

80
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:52,973
The president could declare a state of emergency,
place every mutant in the country under arrest.

81
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:58,391
- Do you think the assassin is working alone?
- Probably we will only know that if we find him before the authorities do.

82
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:05,106
I've been trying to track him using Cerebro,
but his movements are inexplicably erratic.

83
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:10,742
When I have exact coordinates, Storm, Jean,
I'll need you to take the jet and try pick him up.

84
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:16,288
It was close, wasn't it?

85
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,085
Closer than anyone's admitted.

86
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:25,248
- What do you need, William?
- Just your authorisation for a special operation.

87
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:28,134
No, thank you, Mr President.

88
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:31,048
And somehow I thought you were here
to talk about school reform.

89
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,469
Funny you should say that, Mr President.

90
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:38,224
- Senator.
- Mr President. Thank you for having me.

91
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:42,601
- Senator Kelly, this is Colonel William Stryker.
- How do you do?

92
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:47,146
His department has been dealing with the
mutant phenomenon since... before my time.

93
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,399
As I recall, you were a staunch supporter
of the Registration Act, Senator.

94
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:53,949
But it seems your ideas on
the mutant problem have changed recently.

95
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,870
For the best, I hope.

96
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:58,867
So what are you proposing, Mr Stryker?

97
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,288
May I, Mr President?

98
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:18,221
We've managed to gather evidence
of a mutant training facility

99
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:21,887
in the Salem region of upstate New York.

100
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:24,099
Where did you get this information?

101
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:28,445
Interrogation of one of the mutant terrorists
from the Liberty Island incident.

102
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,860
Eric? Eric Lehnsherr?

103
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:33,944
- You have access to him?
- Magneto, yes.

104
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:39,367
We developed the technology
that built his plastic prison.

105
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,076
- This facility is a school.
- Sure it is.

106
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,006
- What the hell is that?
- A jet.

107
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:54,255
- What kind of jet?
- We don't know.

108
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:58,930
But it comes up out of the basketball court.

109
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:08,310
If we'd been allowed to do our jobs,
Mr President, before this incident...

110
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,733
All right, listen.

111
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,153
William, you enter, you detain, you question,

112
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:23,704
but the last thing we need to see is the body
of a mutant kid on the six o'clock news.

113
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:33,418
- Mr Stryker?
- Senator Kelly.

114
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:38,173
This is Yuriko, my personal assistant.

115
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:40,715
- Quite a handshake.
- What can I do for you?

116
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:44,220
Uh, Eric Lehnsherr's prison.
I'd like to arrange a visit if possible.

117
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:46,478
It isn't a petting zoo, Senator.

118
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:51,483
In this conflict he is the enemy, you're just a
spectator, so why don't you sit this one out, all right?

119
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:57,449
Conflict? Mr Stryker, do you really
want to turn this into some kind of war?

120
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:04,164
I was piloting black ops missions
in the jungles of north Vietnam

121
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:07,660
while you were sucking on
your mama's tit at Woodstock, Kelly.

122
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:11,663
Don't lecture me about war.
This already is a war.

123
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:25,636
- You're dead. You're so dead.
- You're dead.

124
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:33,191
I don't wanna hurt you.

125
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:36,735
I'm not afraid.

126
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,342
Logan.

127
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,013
You miss me, kid?

128
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:02,516
Not really.

129
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:05,098
- How are you doing?
- I'm OK. How are you?

130
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:07,267
- Who's this?
- This is Bobby. He's my...

131
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:09,188
I'm her boyfriend.

132
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:11,688
Call me Iceman.

133
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:16,695
Right.

134
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:20,606
Boyfriend? So how do you guys...?

135
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:22,866
Well, we're still working on that.

136
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:26,696
Look who's come back. Just in time.

137
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,742
For what?

138
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:31,877
- We need a baby-sitter.
- Baby-sitter?

139
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:33,629
Nice to see you again, Logan.

140
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:36,500
Hi, Logan.

141
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,003
Hi, Jean.

142
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:41,924
Uh, I should go and get the jet ready.

143
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:44,548
Yeah, well, it's good to meet you.

144
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:48,219
- Come on, let's go.
- Bye, Logan. I'll see you later.

145
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:57,480
Storm and I are heading to Boston.
We won't be gone long.

146
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:01,314
The professor wants us to track down
a mutant who attacked the President.

147
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:03,194
So it was a mutant.

148
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:09,330
You'll be here when we get back,
unless you plan on running off again.

149
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:14,002
Well, I could probably think of
a few reasons to stick around.

150
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:16,372
Find what you were looking for, Logan?

151
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:19,127
More or less.

152
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:21,218
I'll see you boys later.

153
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:25,222
- Be safe, OK?
- You too. Bye.

154
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,307
See ya.

155
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:32,599
Aren't you gonna welcome me home?

156
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:36,233
Your bike needs gas.

157
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:37,903
Then fill her up.

158
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:01,167
Mr Laurio, how long can we keep this up?

159
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,716
- How long is your sentence?
- Forever.

160
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,974
Not necessarily forever, Mr Lehnsherr.
Just until I've got all that I need.

161
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:15,141
Mr Stryker, how kind of you to visit.

162
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:21,692
Have you come back to ensure the taxpayers'
dollars are keeping me comfortable?

163
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:47,424
Done. You can go.

164
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,017
Now...

165
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:56,605
Mr Lehnsherr.

166
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:02,440
I'd like to have one final talk

167
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:08,243
about the house that Xavier built
and the machine called Cerebro.

168
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:20,164
Logan, my tolerance for your smoking
in the mansion notwithstanding,

169
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,632
continue smoking that in here
and you'll spend the rest of your days

170
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:26,465
under the belief that you're a six-year-old girl.

171
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:30,760
- Can you do that?
- I'd have Jean braid your hair.

172
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:32,850
Welcome back.

173
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:56,410
- You want me to leave?
- No. Just don't move.

174
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:07,758
These lights represent
every living person on the planet.

175
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:12,636
The white lights are humans.

176
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,517
And these are the mutants.

177
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:22,895
Through Cerebro I'm connected to them,

178
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:24,985
and they to me.

179
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:30,196
You see, Logan?

180
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:32,782
We're not as alone as you think.

181
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:38,331
I found the base at Alkali Lake.

182
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,203
There was nothing there.

183
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:45,212
The broken line represents the path
of the mutant who attacked the president.

184
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:48,924
I've been finding it difficult to get a lock on it.

185
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:52,384
Well, can't you just concentrate harder?

186
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:55,007
If I wanted to kill him, yes.

187
00:20:57,354 --> 00:20:59,595
There.

188
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:02,305
Looks like he's finally stopped running.

189
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,786
I need you to read my mind again.

190
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,676
Logan,

191
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:34,254
- I'm afraid the results will be the same as before.
- We had a deal.

192
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:40,014
The mind is not a box can be simply unlocked
and opened. It's a beehive with a million...

193
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:41,938
Spare me the lectures.

194
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:49,527
I have no doubt that your amnesia, your adamantium
skeleton, the claws are all somehow connected, but...

195
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:55,243
Logan, sometimes the mind
needs to discover things for itself.

196
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:58,368
I promise you we'll talk again when I return.

197
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:03,160
Oh, if you would be kind enough
to watch over the children tonight.

198
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:06,710
Scott and I are going to visit an old friend.

199
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:23,637
I'm sending the coordinates
of where the mutant's settled.

200
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:26,691
As soon as you find him,
bring him back to the mansion.

201
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:31,231
- Let's hope he cooperates.
- Yes, for his sake. Good luck.

202
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,804
Stryker, William.

203
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,913
What are you doing in here?

204
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,589
Garbage.

205
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:26,092
These are the coordinates.

206
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:50,410
He's a teleporter. Must be why
the professor had trouble locking onto him.

207
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:53,494
We're not here to hurt you.

208
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:57,419
We just wanna talk.

209
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:05,503
- Are you bored yet?
- Oh, yeah.

210
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,307
Sure you don't wanna come down?

211
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,167
- You have him?
- He's not going anywhere.

212
00:27:34,293 --> 00:27:36,618
Are you?

213
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:39,505
Please don't kill me.
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

214
00:27:39,632 --> 00:27:42,917
Why would people
have gotten that impression?

215
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:47,180
- What's your name?
- Wagner. Kurt Wagner.

216
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:55,854
There was so much shooting, such fear.

217
00:27:55,982 --> 00:27:58,817
And then there was only pain.

218
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:05,319
I could see it all happening,
but I couldn't stop myself.

219
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,738
It was like a bad dream.

220
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,408
Perhaps he is testing me.

221
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:18,665
And before you were in the White House,
what do you remember?

222
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:20,503
Nothing.

223
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:23,168
I was here.

224
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:31,720
- I'd rather get him back to the professor.
- The professor?

225
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:39,390
Did you do these yourself?

226
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,616
And what about this?

227
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:14,380
- I need you to read my mind again.
- I'm afraid the results will be the same as before.

228
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,934
- You'll be indestructible.
- No memory.

229
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:22,560
Sometimes the mind needs
to discover things for itself.

230
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,651
Wolverine.

231
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:30,610
No memory. You'll have no memory.

232
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:43,201
The dozen tourists in the
White House during the attack

233
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:44,516
are still being held for questioning.

234
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:48,207
... best tasting food,
and machine that so darn easy to...

235
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,665
The President will address the nation...

236
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:01,899
For the White House assassin,
following hundreds of...

237
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,651
Can't sleep?

238
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:06,935
How can you tell?

239
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,028
Cos you're awake.

240
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:11,279
Right. How about you?

241
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,567
I don't sleep.

242
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:15,157
... Science Museum are claiming to experience...

243
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:20,788
Hey.

244
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,297
- Doesn't anybody sleep around here?
- Apparently not.

245
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:30,671
- Got any beer?
- This is a school.

246
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:32,961
- So that's a no?
- Yeah, that's a no.

247
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:37,889
- Is there anything other than chocolate milk?
- There should be some soda in the small cupboard.

248
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,907
- Thanks.
- No problem.

249
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,751
I'll take him from here.

250
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,669
It's all right, Scott.

251
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,255
- Nice shades.
- Thanks.

252
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:44,367
Charles Xavier.
Have you come to rescue me?

253
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,171
Sorry, Eric, not today.

254
00:31:47,297 --> 00:31:49,088
To what do I owe the pleasure?

255
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,009
The assassination attempt on the President.
What do you know about it?

256
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:57,047
Nothing.

257
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,554
Only what I read in the papers.

258
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:03,183
You really shouldn't have to ask, Charles.

259
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:05,222
What's happened to you?

260
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:09,602
I've had frequent visits from William Stryker.

261
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:11,977
You remember him, don't you?

262
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:14,945
William Stryker.

263
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:19,743
His son, Jason, was once
a student of yours, wasn't he?

264
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,910
Yes. Years ago.

265
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,745
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to help him.

266
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,284
At least, not in the way that his father wanted.

267
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:34,257
And now you think that taking in Wolverine will
make up for your failure with Stryker's son?

268
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,844
- How long you been here?
- A couple of years.

269
00:32:41,976 --> 00:32:46,353
And your parents just sent you off
to mutant school?

270
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:50,561
Actually, my parents think
this is a prep school.

271
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:56,486
Oh I see. Well, I suppose lots of prep
schools have their own dorms, campuses...

272
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:58,573
Jets.

273
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,991
- So you and Rogue, huh?
- Yeah.

274
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:07,369
I mean it's not what you think
I'd like it to be, but it's just...

275
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:14,465
It's just that it's not easy when you
wanna be closer to someone, but you can't.

276
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,846
You know, I've seen how you look at Dr Grey.

277
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:23,967
Excuse me?

278
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,264
Nothin'.

279
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:30,184
- You haven't told him about his past, have you?
- I've put him on the path.

280
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,647
Logan's mind is still fragile.

281
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,065
Is it?

282
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:40,486
Or are you afraid of losing
one of your precious X-Men, old friend?

283
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,365
Eric, what have you done?

284
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:50,542
I'm sorry, Charles.

285
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:54,086
I couldn't help it.

286
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:57,215
What have you told Stryker?

287
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:01,422
Everything.

288
00:34:07,187 --> 00:34:09,594
The war has begun.

289
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,943
Scott!

290
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:19,605
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

291
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,559
But now and then
every mother needs to get away.

292
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:00,419
Without her, the babies are helpless.

293
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:05,273
Sensing danger, the mother rat races home.

294
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,278
The babies can't even see the killer.

295
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,655
As someone uninvited is coming to dinner.

296
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:24,095
Hi.

297
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,195
- What is it?
- Shh.

298
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:18,686
You picked the wrong house, bud.

299
00:36:57,941 --> 00:36:59,600
You all right?

300
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:11,951
Stay here.

301
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,416
- This way.
- Let's go.

302
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:20,976
John! Where's Rogue?

303
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:24,975
- I don't know.
- I gotta find her.

304
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:29,812
- Open it.
- Here, take her.

305
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,863
Go on, get in. Let's go. Come on.

306
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:44,796
Take him. He's stunned.

307
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,749
- I can help you.
- Help them.

308
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,905
- Rogue!
- Bobby!

309
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:13,991
This way.

310
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:28,500
Come on. Everybody, follow me up here.

311
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:35,758
Move.

312
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:46,690
Come on.

313
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,456
Let's go.

314
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,912
Come on, this way.

315
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:13,377
This is it.

316
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:16,882
Logan.

317
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:20,798
- You wanna shoot me, shoot me.
- Don't shoot him.

318
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:23,644
Not yet.

319
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:26,724
Wolverine?

320
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:31,604
Well I must admit this is certainly
the last place I'd expect to find you.

321
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:34,525
How long has it been? 15 years?

322
00:40:35,576 --> 00:40:37,817
You haven't changed one bit.

323
00:40:38,746 --> 00:40:41,153
Me, on the other hand...

324
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:45,584
Nature.

325
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:53,086
Wait, wait, you guys. We've gotta do something.
They're gonna kill him.

326
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:57,001
- He can handle himself. Let's go.
- Bobby.

327
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:59,178
Please.

328
00:40:59,308 --> 00:41:04,764
I didn't realise Xavier was taking in animals,
even animals as unique as you.

329
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:06,854
Who are you?

330
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:11,064
Don't you remember?
