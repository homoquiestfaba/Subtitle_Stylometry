1
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,300
Give it to me!
- No!

2
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,140
Just wait!
- Hey!

3
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,413
Lilli? Want a juice?

4
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,699
Mrs. Richter? Simply kick at it,
that helps sometimes.

5
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,695
Oh, beautiful, really.

6
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,608
Sorry. I'm behaving terribly.
I'm an interior designer.

7
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,972
Rooms and images fascinate me.
- Do you want a coffee?

8
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,649
Oh yes. With milk and sugar, please.

9
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,772
It was a distillery before
I converted it.

10
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,460
Wonderful, really.

11
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,529
And so close to the lake.

12
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,336
How did you actually find me?
- My husband Thomas is bionic engineer.

13
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,211
He works a lot in the U.S.,
on the east coast. A colleague there,

14
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,299
David Gersh,
has two of your works at the institute.

15
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,899
We heard that you
live just around the corner, so...

16
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,979
I couldn't believe it.
Do you remember David?

17
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,099
I've done two pieces for him.
The portrait, I think, was his father.

18
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,053
He was an art collector or something.

19
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,899
Your pictures have such a force!
Spontaneous and direct.

20
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,055
Thank you.

21
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,379
And you want to be portrayed?
- Me? No.

22
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,937
I want a portrait of my children.

23
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,611
From my daughter and my son.
- Okay. How old are they?

24
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,213
My daughter Lilli is 21, studies dance
and singing at the Academy.

25
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,173
She's in the third year.

26
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,451
And the boy? How old is he?
- Alexander is 19.

27
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,613
And he lives in Munich too?

28
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,129
No. Alexander...
Yes, that's the problem.

29
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,094
Alexander had a fatal accident.
Last autumn.

30
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,889
Oh, I'm sorry.
- It was an accident.

31
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,980
A hunting accident.

32
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,529
I've heard
you have experience with the dead.

33
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,095
Well,

34
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,179
I've worked with dead people
a few times.

35
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,332
I think that such a picture,
that it can help with grief.

36
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,338
This, for example, is Ferdl.

37
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,418
He was the son of my neighbours.

38
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,818
I've painted him from memory.

39
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,458
He's gone out with a rowboat.

40
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,011
He could swim really good,
but probably not good enough.

41
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,129
How much will a portrait cost?

42
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,293
That depends on the size.

43
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,419
And then it's a double portrait.

44
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,659
When can your daughter
take the time?

45
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,130
If you don't need her too many times...
- Why? Is she against the picture?

46
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,173
Well, she's actually against everything,
that comes from me.

47
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,259
And is there a photo of Alexander?
- Mountains. And videos.

48
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,532
He was a beautiful boy. Photogenic.
We photographed him constantly.

49
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,933
He was an excellent skier.
In the German elite squad.

50
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,258
We had him in this elite boarding school
for top athletes in Berchtesgaden.

51
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,339
He was very popular.
- Have you thought about the size?

52
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,415
Huge!

53
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:31,452
Approximately 1.50 m x 2 m. Is that possible?
- No problem. The bigger the better.

54
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,771
I've imagined them at the piano.
The two did a lot of singing together.

55
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,054
I've always loved this picture.
The two together at the piano.

56
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,258
Well. The size, two people.

57
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,854
I'd say: 20,000?
- How long do you need?

58
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,290
Three months.
- And when can you start?

59
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,289
As soon as your daughter has time.
- Could it be finished by Christmas?

60
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,375
Yes.

61
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,893
You want 50% to start with?

62
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,092
Yes, it would be nice if it's possible.
And the rest on delivery.

63
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,533
And then of course everything I need,
... of material, pictures, videos...

64
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,415
that exist of Alexander.
Ferdl has always been here with me.

65
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,498
And got the colours mixed up.

66
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,849
I tell Lilli she shall contact you.
- Well, I'm here.

67
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,529
Thank you. This is very exciting.
I'm glad.

68
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,170
Isn't it strange?
With all these people around, all the time?

69
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,860
They are my people.

70
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,658
Do you talk to them sometimes?
- Yes.

71
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,169
And? Do they answer?
- Sometimes.

72
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,778
Take good care of my child!

73
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,011
Please say hello to the specialist in
Bionics in Germany:

74
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,138
Professor Dr. Thomas Richter!

75
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,535
Ladies and gentlemen!
To discover the secret of

76
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,448
the flight of the dragonfly,
the nearly frictionless surface of

77
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,368
the dolphin's skin
and the statics of a reed straw

78
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,458
are not abstract goals for us...

79
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,694
Please, the TV interviews
we'll do over there!

80
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,059
Thomas, would you come over here?
- Please don't leave me alone.

81
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,013
Don't worry, I'm with you.

82
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,218
Yes?
- Hi, it's me. Are you okay?

83
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,529
Ah, hello. Yes, all right. With you?

84
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,374
Tobi wants to go to Spain in October.
I told you. A language course.

85
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,334
In Salamanca.
Well, I think it's good, don't you?

86
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,258
Yeah, sure, if he wants!

87
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,538
How much do you need?
- It costs 900. Can you give 600?

88
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,618
Yes, fine.
- Can you transfer it to me?

89
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,452
Soon?
- He can also get cash, if he wants.

90
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,131
He just needs to stop by.
We could go and eat or something.

91
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,291
Better transfer it simply.
- For 600, he could at least come along.

92
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,249
Do you think that's right? - What?
To blackmail him.

93
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,173
With money.
- Oh, forget it.

94
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,254
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.
- I think it's a good thing.

95
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,532
Salamanca. - Yes, sure.
Bye Max.

96
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,700
Ciao!
- Oh, Max?

97
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,938
What?
- Mrs. Stoeckel has died.

98
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:21,136
Do you remember? The woman below us.
She was lying dead in her apartment for one week.

99
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,174
Sounds creepy.
- You could say that!

100
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,968
Shall I tell you what:
That could happen to me too.

101
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,258
Well, ciao, take care.
- Ciao.

102
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,098
What's this fucking crap door?
- Yes, it's old and jamming.

103
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,769
I'm sorry,
you need to kick at it, hard.

104
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,173
Yeah, good.
- Great. Nice port.

105
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,374
What's up? May I come in?
- Yes, yes, absolutely.

106
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,375
Wow!

107
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,849
Do you have coffee? - Yes. Milk? Sugar?
Both.

108
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,860
Ah, like the Mama!

109
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,373
She, however, managed to open the port.
With a heavy bump with the hip.

110
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,252
Of course.

111
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,299
I'd prefer if you don't smoke here!

112
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,652
Great. Then we're even because
I'd prefer if I were not here.

113
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,614
Oh, I find it nice,
that you came anyway.

114
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,770
Here you go.
- Thank you.

115
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,734
So what do you need from me?
- Why need?

116
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,419
Maybe we could get to know each other.
- At four o'clock I've to be in town.

117
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,091
I was hoping you'd have more time.
- Well, I'm really sorry.

118
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,294
Aren't you really keen on this project?
- Bingo. Grand prize.

119
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,254
Why?
- Because you answer the questions correctly.

120
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,899
No, I mean,
why don't you like it, this picture?

121
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:49,136
Because my brother's dead. And my mother
wants to hang him on the wall as a decoration.

122
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,611
Well, I hope that it will be more
than just decoration. - Sure.

123
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,374
I'm truly sorry
that your brother is dead.

124
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,738
I heard you often paint dead people.

125
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,373
Yes.
- Are these all dead?

126
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,300
Some, not all.

127
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,733
And him? Is he dead?
- Yes.

128
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,853
Who is it?
- A friend.

129
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,213
You live here too?
- Yes.

130
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,779
Well, this one isn't dead.
It's one of my favourite pictures.

131
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,896
Who is it?

132
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,376
A boy.

133
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,980
Pretty.
- Yes.

134
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,333
Do you live alone?
- Yes.

135
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,260
Are you gay?

136
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,094
Why do you say that now?
- Just so. A certain feeling.

137
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,338
No idea.
- What does that mean?

138
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,579
I've no idea.
I've lived alone for so long.

139
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,853
I have no idea.

140
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,012
Well then.

141
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,138
And how do you find my brother?

142
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,858
Well, he looks like a nice guy.

143
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,179
That he was.
- But he smiles a bit too often.

144
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,978
Do you always wear such a braid?

145
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,491
No, only when I'm training.
- Ah, what kind of training is today?

146
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,454
Dance training.
We're working on a choreography.

147
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,573
Is it fun?
- So-so.

148
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,979
So what you need from me?
- I'd like to make some photos.

149
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,652
A couple of sketches. And we'll need
a piano like you have at home.

150
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,739
Maybe there's one in your school?

151
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,369
I can look around in the area.
- There are all kinds of pianos.

152
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,379
I'll find one.
- Well, and I would love to...

153
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,333
talk about your brother.

154
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,498
I'll certainly find a piano.

155
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,209
You won't escape from us!
- I'll catch her!

156
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,053
I'll finish you!

157
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,253
Stop that girl, don't
let her pull, bind her,

158
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,579
don't let her escape.
Because we don't know your face,

159
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,893
We don't know.
You aren't welcome for us,

160
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,298
you aren't one of us...

161
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,100
Stop, stop, stop!

162
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:41,535
You know what I'm saying now. The others
fly away from you. What's this?

163
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,218
You define the tone, not the others!

164
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,853
Nothing is decided, Lilli.

165
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,651
If you don't like, don't do it!
All over again!

166
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,898
Hello.
- Hello. What can I do for you?

167
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,808
I'd like an espresso
and a water. May I just...

168
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,500
You're welcome.
- Thank you.

169
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,771
Hotel bars at this time are terrible,
right? Really desolate.

170
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,457
Yes?
- Yes.

171
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,339
So empty and so dark.
- I actually quite like it.

172
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,539
Probably you don't travel as much
as I do. I almost live in hotels.

173
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,176
And these bars are my living room.
- What are you doing?

174
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,538
I'm Dental representative. You allow?

175
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,653
I have a suite on the first floor.
For the sale. Until Monday.

176
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,735
Hm.

177
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,380
Nice name.

178
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,818
And what's for lunch, Beatrice?

179
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,933
Peanuts.
- Oh, no!

180
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,089
I'll get us something nicer.
- Oh yeah?

181
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,460
You know, Richy,

182
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,609
I'd really like to
but me and my boss,

183
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,533
we have a date.

184
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,613
He'll come very soon,
and we always have so little time.

185
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,728
With Americans it
can take months.

186
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,693
Greet nicely at home, Richy.

187
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,649
Yes, I'll call you from home.
- Hello.

188
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,858
Found a new friend?

189
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,853
I'll stay here just an hour.

190
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,649
No, it's not a problem,
I leave the phone on.

191
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,292
So do I. Ciao!

192
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,934
Apologies,
my book came out today.

193
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,738
Cool photo.
- Five years of work.

194
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,454
You can keep it if you want.
- Thank you.

195
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,293
Do you come from school?
- Yes.

196
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,098
And you're rehearsing "Alice"? - Yes.
Beautiful.

197
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,700
What do you take?

198
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,578
You still play "Alice", right?

199
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,699
What can I get to drink, Sir?
- What would you like to drink?

200
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,779
A water please.
- A water and a glass of white wine.

201
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,534
Yesterday I was at this painter.
- Yes? How was it?

202
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,858
I find the idea totally stupid.

203
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,212
Eliane wishes it so much, do it.
- Dad, it's totally awkward.

204
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,900
How do you like the man?

205
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,338
Kind of weird. He lives in his studio
among all these pictures of dead people.

206
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,293
It's like a mausoleum.

207
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,454
Has he already started to paint?
- No. We just talked.

208
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,258
She wants us at the piano.
- I know.

209
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,458
Dad, I find that really creepy.

210
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,815
Come on.

211
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,855
Well.

212
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,773
Here you go.
- Thank you.

213
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,338
How's Mom?
- Pretty good, I think.

214
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,448
She has much to do with
this new order in the city.

215
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,538
A flagship store, big deal!
- Really?

216
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,660
You look tired.

217
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,653
Do you need money?
- No.

218
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,609
I don't know with my school...
- Lilli, go to this painter.

219
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,656
Let him paint you. Give him what he needs.
It is very important for your mother.

220
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,898
And for you?
- Do you understand?

221
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,258
Whether you understand me?
- Yes.

222
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,333
A little greeting from the kitchen.

223
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,489
Have you already decided?
- The tenderloin?

224
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,850
I don't know.
- Twice the tenderloin, please.

225
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,540
English, medium?
- Medium!

226
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,775
Hello?

227
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,369
Hello!
- Hello!

228
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,334
Well, how was it?
- We've got a whole page in GEO.

229
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,100
And?
- Very positive.

230
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,540
And with Lilli?

231
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,929
She was at this painter. - Oh yeah? And?
Well.

232
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,410
She'll do it.

233
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,609
Too bad.

234
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,336
Great!
- Well.

235
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,020
Hey, great! Encore!

236
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,693
I'm ready by the way.

237
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:03,331
I offer you one more rematch.
- Ok. I'll get two more beers.

238
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,540
Two more, please.

239
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,253
Sporty, sporty.

240
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,414
Can I also have a beer?
- That's a new variation.

241
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,692
You've already got one.
- One for me, one for my friend.

242
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,380
Your friend?

243
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,053
At least for today.

244
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,619
May I call you?
- I don't even know your name.

245
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,289
Aldo. And you?
- What kind of name is that?

246
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,660
Spanish or something.

247
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,658
I'm Lilli
- Ok, beautiful Lilli.

248
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,858
I'd like to get to know you.

249
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,893
I don't have a pen.

250
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,053
Hey, Lilli!

251
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,289
Hello.
- Hello Lilli.

252
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,494
Coffee?
- Do you have something else? A beer?

253
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,450
Do you usually have your hair
like this? - Sometimes, yes.

254
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,734
Looks good. Does it annoy you,
when I shoot, while we talk?

255
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,169
Should I take off my clothes?
- Not necessary.

256
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,458
Look over here, please.

257
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,619
More towards me.
Tell me about the lessons.

258
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,853
What do you want to know?

259
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,929
What are you actually studying?

260
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,849
Acting, singing, dance, literature.

261
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,689
A little bit of everything,
or what?

262
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:33,336
Lean on the pillow please.
And the head a little backwards.

263
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,339
Do you want to paint me like that?
Stretched out on your couch?

264
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,613
I only collect impressions.

265
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,174
Well, Max,
why have you been alone for so long?

266
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,658
Because no one knocked on my door.

267
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,259
That sounds lonely.
- Oh, I get along very well.

268
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,209
And that's enough?
Getting along?

269
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,780
I like being alone.

270
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:14,576
Aren't you afraid of being alone?
- Oh, I'm more scared of people.

271
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,659
Won't you be happy?
- Be happy?

272
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,689
Well, I want to put on some music.
- Hey, you even have Peter Gabriel.

273
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,779
But Lilli, I need you calm
for yet a short time.

274
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,449
Please sit on the chair.

275
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,895
Thank you.

276
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,659
And how's it with you?
Do you live alone?

277
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,449
No friend or lover?
- Currently not.

278
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,699
Why are you doing sketches
when you've already photographed me?

279
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,778
It's two different things.

280
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,539
One thing is what the camera tells me,
and the other,

281
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,211
what my eyes tell me.
How my hands want to describe you.

282
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,259
How do your hands
want to describe me, Max?

283
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,059
Well, nice of course.
I want to please your mother.

284
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,458
Tell me about your brother.

285
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,174
Did you often
play the piano together?

286
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,458
Yes, and quite a lot of singing.

287
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,899
What, for example?
- Pop songs, musical numbers.

288
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,539
Alex liked fun stuff.
- Oh, Alexander was amusing?

289
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,578
Yep. Alex was really funny!
- And how?

290
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,369
Did he tell jokes?
- No, he was more physical.

291
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,209
For me he used to play
the "Dancing Turk".

292
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,219
He was really good. Sometimes he
would come into the kitchen,

293
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,219
when I quarrelled with my mother.
Then he played the "Dancing Turk"

294
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,299
behind her back...
That was hilarious.

295
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,978
So he was a peacemaker too?

296
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,939
Could be.
Alex hated confrontations.

297
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,740
Unlike you.

298
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,376
And he was harmonic with your parents?
- With my mother at least.

299
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,533
In any case better than me.

300
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,129
My mother found Alex
awesome anyway.

301
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,859
They had quite a lot in common.
- I see. What?

302
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,651
Do you know "La belle indifference"?
The beautiful indifference?

303
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:05,658
Everything great, no problems.
- Please look at the window.

304
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,613
Yes, good. And your father?

305
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,815
Alex had to be a star for him!
At school, in sports, everywhere.

306
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,773
And? Was he a star?

307
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,933
He was very disciplined.

308
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,128
He ran 5 kilometers every morning.
No matter what the weather was like.

309
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,253
He was at the ski boarding school.
Once his teacher has called us,

310
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,056
because he had gotten lost in
a blizzard. He was also running then.

311
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,139
In the pitch dark, and then he got lost
because he couldn't see anything

312
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,811
in the snow storm.
- That sounds rather exhausting.

313
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,531
Daily training and then
go to school. - Could be.

314
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,491
Did you often argue with each other?
- No idea. No.

315
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,291
With Alex, you can't argue.
He admired me.

316
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,248
Once he recorded this show,
in which I participated..

317
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:12,296
That was in school, in the auditorium.
I sang a song a solo.

318
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,139
Alex was sitting in front.
I remember him with his recorder...

319
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:24,176
on his lap. When he noticed that I
looked at him, he played the "Turk".

320
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,299
I had to laugh and could have
killed him. I was so scared,

321
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:36,177
that I couldn't sing. But when my
solo came, he was totally calm.

322
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,258
He didn't even look at me anymore.

323
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,216
He only watched his recorder
and held the mic in the air.

324
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,173
As if he would pray.

325
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,289
He probably just checked the volume.
But I think

326
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,379
he looked away intentionally
to not distract me.

327
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,772
It's weird but I'll never forget
how he didn't looked at me.

328
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,894
And at dinner he played the tape
for the whole family.

329
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,933
When everybody applauded,
Alex whispered into the mic:

330
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,893
That was beautiful, Lilli.

331
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,852
He whispered that onto the tape.
"That was beautiful. "

332
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,814
Did my mother actually tell you
how my brother died?

333
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,939
She said in a hunting accident.
- In a hunting accident?

334
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,610
Yes. - That is indeed
a clever formulation.

335
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,695
Why?

336
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,259
Alex was never hunting
in his whole life.

337
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,097
My brother committed suicide.
- What?

338
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,609
With a gun.
Well, that part is correct.

339
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,576
Only it wasn't an accident. He went
in the forest behind our house,

340
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,416
sat down on a stone
and put the gun in his mouth.

341
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,089
Did he leave a message?

342
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,900
No, nothing.

343
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,613
Are you sure it was suicide?

344
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,619
Now you sound like my mother.
- Why? She is sure

345
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,619
that it was an accident, right?
- No. She knows that he did it himself.

346
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,619
But she doesn't want that others
know. The "people"! She's afraid,

347
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,699
that she's guilty then or something.
Our bad mother.

348
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,258
And that was a year ago now?

349
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,538
Well, about. What else do you need?

350
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,619
That's enough for today. Thank you.
- Okay. I must leave now.

351
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,131
I need a few more pictures
at the piano. - I'll fix it.

352
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,218
Well. And one more thing.
- What else?

353
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,699
I need someone who stands
beside you, as your brother.

354
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,699
Someone who reminds of him.
Do you know anybody,

355
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,778
who could do that?
- Certainly.

356
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,129
I'll call you. In a few days?
- Nice.

357
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,940
Hey.
- Hello, Lilli.

358
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,289
Shall we go upstairs?
- Ciao.

359
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,859
Hi, were you waiting a long time?
- Hi, Lilli. No problem.

360
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,929
Max, this is Tom.

361
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,018
I'll be right back, okay?

362
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,291
Sit down beside her.
No, on the other side, please.

363
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,095
Yes.

364
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,098
Lilli, play something.
- What?

365
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,529
Well, anything,
no idea.

366
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,249
Tom, can stand over here?

367
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,378
Like this?
- Yes, and look at Lilli.

368
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,778
Yes! Lilli, look over here to me!

369
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,260
Yes, well, well!

370
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,614
Just play something different,
from the past, something funny.

371
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,659
Did your brother touch you
while you were playing piano?

372
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,409
Hands on the shoulder or so?
- Sure, sometimes.

373
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,498
Tom, can you do that again?

374
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,413
Lilli, can you sing now?

375
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,539
Are you nuts? Do you think I'm
a piece of clay on which you fiddle...

376
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,733
and can squeeze as you want?
I'm sick of this crap!

377
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,818
I'm gone! Thanks for your help.

378
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,539
It's heavy for her. I mean, he's dead,
her brother. - I know, I know.

379
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,493
I'm leaving, ok?

380
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,173
Yes, ciao.

381
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,095
Shit.

382
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,609
What now?
Haven't got any coffee yet?

383
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,853
I was about to leave.

384
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,293
Same thing again?

385
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,129
Hello, two latte and a biscotti, please.

386
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,698
Are you cold?
- No, not at all. Why?

387
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,100
You look great.

388
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,968
And the exams? Have gone well?
- What exams?

389
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,979
What you told me on the phone.
- Oh.

390
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,934
No problem. Everything's great.
- Congratulations.

391
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,614
Why are you so late?
- I was in the studio.

392
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,819
I'm working on such a huge object.
A sculpture of wood and papier mâché.

393
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,774
6 meter tall!
I do it together with a friend.

394
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:34,174
He has experience with wood sculptures.
He's an old stager, 34 and still at the academy.

395
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,849
That place would be nothing for me.

396
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,778
The thing is big, really big.

397
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,939
I like to have a good romp, you know?
I love to do it with the whole body.

398
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,848
Climbing around,
holding on, that's my thing.

399
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,540
Looks good!

400
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,374
To fill a room
with a single object.

401
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,539
I imagine it in a huge bank hall.
Or in an airport,

402
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:12,814
in the middle of the arrival hall.
Nothing for the living room. Right?

403
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,938
And what kind of women
do you prefer?

404
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,100
Quite different.

405
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,260
Do you like me?

406
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,060
Yes, I like you.

407
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,820
Much?
- Listen,

408
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,009
I bought you a cup of coffee
and even a biscotti.

409
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,691
For 3, maybe 4 euro.
- Well, that's a start.

410
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:51,733
Do you like me then?
- I'm not so sure yet.

411
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:55,535
You are quite interesting,
but your sweater is stupid.

412
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,220
Sweater is stupid?

413
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,049
My sweater is gone.
My shoes are ok?

414
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,653
Yes, your shoes are ok.

415
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,689
Thank you, God, she likes my shoes.

416
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,413
And, are you good in bed?

417
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,257
So far, there's no complaints.
- So you think you're good?

418
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,929
Yes, I'm good. Shall I show you?

419
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,260
Don't know.

420
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,218
You're a strange girl.

421
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,459
I'm not strange.
I'm just a theater bitch.

422
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,609
At least you talk like a bitch.

423
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:55,334
Maybe I'm just big mouthed.
- Oh yeah? Nothing behind it?

424
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,816
Not much.

425
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,820
I don't believe you.

426
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,573
I think I'll leave now.

427
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,813
Yes?
- Tomorrow. Am I disturbing?

428
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,459
Mama, I'm asleep.
- Did I wake you up? I'm sorry.

429
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,411
I thought you were already awake.
It's almost eleven. - Yes.

430
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,734
Were you out late?
- Well, not so late.

431
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,769
But I was so drunk.
- How come?

432
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,689
No idea, just because.
And that was necessary?

433
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,540
Well, it was necessary.

434
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,809
Mama!
- I just wanted to hear, how you are.

435
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,489
Great.
Apart from my terrible hangover.

436
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,654
And in school?
Good progress with the probes?

437
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,329
So so.
- Are you getting bored again?

438
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,738
I must get up now, Mom.

439
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:14,779
Do you remember when you were small,
we sometimes made a picnic lunch.

440
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,779
I picked you up from school,
then we went to the art museum...

441
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,939
and looked at an exhibition.

442
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:27,019
Then we had cake on the lawn.

443
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,619
Don't you remember? You loved
running through the corridors.

444
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,538
Preferably in socks.

445
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,619
I can only remember
your many friends.

446
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,529
But we had a good time, didn't we?

447
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,979
Do you need anything for the winter?
Hopefully you will not wear...

448
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,888
this gray sack dress again.
- I like the gray sack.

449
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,411
Should we go shopping next week?
Now they still have everything.

450
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,250
I prefer you transfer me an amount.
- If I can anything, then shopping.

451
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,339
We would only argue a lot.
- People are paying lots of money

452
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,692
to hear my opinion. You make...
- We are just different types.

453
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,894
Alexander liked the clothes
I picked for him always.

454
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,098
I've only an hour until my lessons.
- I won't keep you from it.

455
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,053
All right.
- Bye.

456
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,615
Well?

457
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,895
I just wonder if
there's anything to watch already.

458
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,978
Nothing to watch yet.
- Too bad.

459
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,614
Shall we have a walk?

460
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,974
Why isn't there anything to see yet?
Does it always take so long?

461
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,934
Well, it's not so easy with you.

462
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,459
Once we were here in summer,
with our aunt Andrea.

463
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:23,250
We were riding such a thing.
Alex was about 10 then,

464
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,339
and he said so funny things.
- Like what?

465
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,939
That our family is just like
such a pedalo.

466
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,939
We glide gently and peacefully.
If we would watch it from...

467
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,894
the bottom we would see
that we struggled a lot.

468
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,049
But you can't see that
from above.

469
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,898
Pretty clever, my little brother.

470
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:12,456
Oh, the other day at school, that was
maybe not so elegant of me.

471
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,180
I'm sorry.

472
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,615
Okay.

473
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,374
Where were you at noon?
- A private affair.

474
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,329
Lilli, you shall play the lead role.

475
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,129
Lilli, come on!

476
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,295
Help!

477
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,338
Lilli, come now!
- I don't want yet!

478
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,212
Come on!

479
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,491
I don't want to leave yet.
- But I must go!

480
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,169
Aldo, Aldo, don't go away.

481
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,058
I have to.
- Come on inside me.

482
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,136
What? Here?

483
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,411
Are you crazy?

484
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,180
Anita! Moment!

485
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:14,499
Anita. Pull yourself out of the centre.
And hold your tension.

486
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:20,173
You don't keep your tension.
Moment. Pull yourself out from the sternum.

487
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:24,495
And don't forget your compré.
Well?

488
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:28,819
I'm sorry, I had an accident.
- Save your explanations, Lilli.

489
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,728
From now on you can sleep, celebrate
and smoke as much as you want.

490
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,818
Anita will play "Alice".
- What?

491
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,294
If you want to talk about it
you can come to my office tonight.

492
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:45,574
Now we're rehearsing, please
don't disturb us.

493
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,895
Thank you.

494
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,714
How beautiful to be
above the roofs like this.

495
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,759
Can't you imagine
to live in a place like this?

496
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,953
Quite little, isn't it?

497
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,874
What, seriously?
- Perhaps, yes.

498
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,039
You want to move?
- No, it's just an idea.

499
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,119
Don't you think that we
had enough excitement lately?

500
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,552
I think it's nice here. And to be in
the city would be good change.

501
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,513
Cinemas, cafes, theaters...

502
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,279
You want to move now? Here?
Did you forget what a stress it is,

503
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,960
such a move?

504
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,189
Thomas,
you mean that seriously, right?

505
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,473
How long shall Alexander's room
be untouched yet? - What?

506
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,479
Do you believe I don't notice
how you constantly sit in Alex' room?

507
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,558
Staring at the wall?
- So what?

508
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:48,559
I want you to think about it.
- I don't want to think about it.

509
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,639
I don't want to move either.
What's happening now?

510
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,718
Has Sandra separated from you?

511
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,313
If you'd show me just one time,
that we still mean something to you...

512
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,319
It has to happen something, Eliane.
- I don't want. Everything is ok.

513
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,989
Nothing is ok. - Yes, everything wonderful.
No.

514
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:14,717
Leave me alone! - Talk to me.
Keep your hands off me, you...

515
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,389
What? Come on, spit it out! Say it!
- Stop it.

516
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,275
Stop it!

517
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,359
I can't stand it any more. - Stop it!
Stop what?

518
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,359
With this fucking pressure.
You put all people under pressure.

519
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:37,635
You put him under pressure and
made him mad, with your pressure.

520
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,794
What I really like
is the dialogue of the materials.

521
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,232
The concrete on one hand, the nature
on the other: wood, moss, bones.

522
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,319
It shows me that nature
always finds its way,

523
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:11,434
when we don't fight it.
- Great, how the structure surfaces.

524
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:15,473
And you've done them all last year?
- All last year.

525
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,833
She has very red hands.

526
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:58,712
Maybe she has to work hard.
- Nice to see you made it.

527
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,799
Where's he now, the artist friend?
- Over there.

528
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,833
The one with the leather jacket.
Looks good, right?

529
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,839
Well, if you like
Mediterranean types, yes.

530
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,478
He'll soon go down again anyway.

531
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,798
What number is this glass?

532
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,871
Honestly, I've a keen sense for such.
I've practiced myself.

533
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:48,151
Shall I introduce you?
He's got a job here. - No, thank you.

534
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,279
I think I can't stand him anyway.
- Lilli, we are leaving.

535
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,800
I must go.

536
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,473
When I can I have a
look at our picture? - Soon.

537
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,160
I'll be in touch, ok?

538
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,280
Hello, Aldo? It's me.

539
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:24,873
I wanted to ask if we can meet tonight?
I'm done here by 5.

540
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,560
Give me a call.

541
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,400
I love you.

542
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,479
"Dear Aldo, I'm sitting here
in the chemistry seminar and listen...

543
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,354
to this talk about nuclear acids.
Actually, I think of you... "

544
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,439
What are you doing?
- I've looked around a little.

545
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,751
Do you read my letters?
- I've just browsed in the sketchbook.

546
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,359
You read my letters!
- It fall out of the book.

547
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,473
You're wearing my shirt also.
What's this? - Aldo, I didn't want...

548
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,515
I wanted to see what you're working on.
The letter fell out of the book.

549
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,598
I wanted to... - Take off my shirt!
Aldo.

550
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,440
Take it off!

551
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:26,279
How dare you read my letters?
That's none of your shit.

552
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,757
I know that. I didn't want...
It won't happen again. Ok?

553
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,993
You can bet your life on it.

554
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,359
You know what? I don't think
it's going very well.

555
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,153
What?
- "What?" Our relationship!

556
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,313
You're asking too much. You want to
be with me all the time, always.

557
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,479
I can't even take a piss alone.
And if I do, you sniff around here.

558
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,673
I'm really sorry, with the book.
I don't know what got into me.

559
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:03,079
I want to explore every angle of you.
- Could it be that I don't want that?

560
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,354
I want you to belong only to me.
- I don't want to be owned by anyone!

561
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:14,756
Forgive me. It'll never happen again.
I won't do it again, I promise.

562
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,438
Want to be fucked now?

563
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,120
Get on your clothes.

564
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,240
Where're you going?

565
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:33,432
To work. - Can I come along?
Lilli, I'm going to work.

566
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,714
Please, I won't disturb you.
I'll sit somewhere and learn.

567
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,712
Come on!

568
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,719
Come on, now.
- I can't find the other shoe.

569
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,395
Gee!

570
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,755
Here!

571
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,196
I'll just brush my teeth very quickly.
- What? You can do that at home.

572
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,275
Aldo.

573
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,198
Hello, Aldo? It's me again.

574
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,918
Now talk to me at least.

575
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,075
Please.

576
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,989
I don't know what I did wrong.

577
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,278
Call me, well, I'm home.

578
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,989
Most of the children go barefoot.

579
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,511
Hi, this is Aldo,
please leave a message after the beep.

580
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,109
Well, what was the lady?
Pink panties.

581
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,793
Aldo?
- Hello and good afternoon.

582
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,632
Your number was picked from 10,000 participants.
You have the opportunity to win

583
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,719
a trip worth 7000...
- Shit. Fuck you!

584
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,716
You dirty, stupid, cowardly asshole!

585
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,354
Yes?
- Lilli?

586
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,438
It's me, Max. I need your help.

587
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,429
I'm stuck.
Can you come here?

588
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,193
Lilli? Are you still there?

589
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,598
Now?
- Yes, if it's ok?

590
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,479
You want a beer?
Maybe a towel? - Well, thank you.

591
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,629
You're smoking?
- Yes. You want one?

592
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,395
Yes.

593
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:09,635
Thank you.

594
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,713
You're alright?

595
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,195
So so.

596
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,194
Do you sleep enough?
- No.

597
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,880
Too many parties?

598
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,198
So, why don't you sleep enough?

599
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,949
Because of this Fernando, painter-type,
or what?

600
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,393
Aldo, Max. His name is Aldo.

601
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,629
What a stupid name.
- Didn't you say,

602
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,718
you need my help? What's up?

603
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:50,949
Yeah, right.
I've got a problem with one picture.

604
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:55,039
I want you to look at it.
Let's go over?

605
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,752
I noticed that among the images
I got from your mother,

606
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:04,476
there's hardly one where you
touch each other or so.

607
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,479
I was looking for it,
because I want to know,

608
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:13,151
how such a touch could look.
Here, that's it.

609
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,678
Yeah, that's good.
- Do you like it?

610
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,798
I don't know what to say.

611
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,198
Do you think your mother will like it?

612
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,235
Definitely.

613
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,318
Perhaps a bit too dark.

614
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:51,597
And he doesn't smile. I'm not sure
if she likes that. But otherwise.

615
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:55,235
Aren't you satisfied?
- Dunno, his ever-present grin...

616
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,148
disturbs me somehow.
- I understand. It's ok.

617
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,910
Yeah? But something isn't right.
What's wrong? - I don't know.

618
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:09,068
How does that feel?
Does your brother feel right for you?

619
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,159
I don't know. - Say it now!
I find the picture creepy.

620
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,798
Creepy?
- Yes, do I look like this?

621
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,080
So cold?

622
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,754
It looks as if he wants something
from me and I don't even notice it.

623
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:35,314
It's me. I've no expertise.
- But I wanted to know it.

624
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,278
I feel like this lately.

625
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,793
He's haunting me somehow.

626
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,479
Sometimes I wake up at night and
think he's standing next to my bed

627
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,434
or he's in the room.
Well, not the real Alexander,

628
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,189
but a feeling of someone
in the room.

629
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,873
It feels terrible.

630
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:08,436
As if he had opened a door
and I can't shut it again.

631
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:13,550
Like such a door in a plane
where parachutists jump out.

632
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,639
The door is open
and attracts me to jump too.

633
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,831
I could do it. It's easy.

634
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:28,269
It's a matter of a few seconds.

635
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,478
That's what I mean when I say,
that he's haunting me, or...

636
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,433
pulls or pushes, or so.

637
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,838
This man has been dead
for three years.

638
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:59,236
Did he also commit suicide?
- No, he didn't. Yes, sort of.

639
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:03,599
He played with drugs,
some harder stuff.

640
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,916
I always want finish him.
But somehow it's not right yet.

641
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,549
I was really besotted with that man.

642
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:23,559
Usually I'm rather someone
who's a little bit off,

643
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,638
like an observer or spectator.

644
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:33,034
And he really involved me with life.
Home run.

645
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:38,840
Every moment with him was life,
rich, and above all unpredictable.

646
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,719
What was the problem?
- The problem was, I was married.

647
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,714
You were married?
- I've even had a family.

648
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:53,994
A wife and a son. I still have
the son. He's 18 now.

649
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:59,148
At the same time the man was
too much. Too intense, too crazy.

650
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,754
His death was a relief to me.
The people are dead, Lilli.

651
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:11,553
His name was Erik Alexander.
They can't pull or push anymore,

652
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,240
because they are dead.

653
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,719
Look, how I see you.
There, that's you!

654
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,958
You're strong and resolute.

655
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,080
Crap, strong.

656
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:36,193
Of course I am strong.
But that's not what it is about.

657
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,153
That's not the point.

658
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:44,511
But maybe someone could
ask how I feel.

659
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:53,115
Perhaps someone can get
interested in how it's going with me!

660
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,629
How it's really going with me!
Oh, I'm so tired.

661
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:03,354
Can I sleep here?
I must sleep now.

662
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,909
My bathrobe!
- Have you been swimming?

663
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:34,119
Yes. Are you ok again?
- Where does this come from?

664
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,073
That was in the stack from your mother.
- I don't know it at all.

665
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,988
I think it's good. I noticed it.
I think it looks,

666
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:48,989
as if he was in love in the picture.
In the one who photographed him.

667
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,953
True, somehow pleased.

668
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:57,470
Strange feeling, to see a photo
of Alex, that I don't know.

669
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:04,072
It reminds me somehow that he
also had a life without us.

670
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:08,079
Have you had breakfast?
I've got smoked eel inside.

671
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,760
I don't want eel.

672
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:14,834
Oh, right. Dancers use to
chain smoke for breakfast.

673
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,918
And then eat lettuce leaves, right?

674
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,118
Sorry, we're closing now.

675
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,955
Hello!

676
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,159
I didn't even hear you.
- I've shouted hello.

677
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,160
You look good.

678
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,954
Bit pale.
May I take the coat?

679
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,313
It's here in the garden, right?

680
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,434
Hmm, Alexander always wanted
to hold your hand.

681
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,715
He was very affectionate.
It was quite annoying for you.

682
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,599
How rude of me.
- You were always a little cold.

683
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,880
Want some tea?

684
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,878
It's cold today, autumn's coming.

685
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,553
Still a quarter of an hour.

686
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,309
Everything all right with you?
- Yes, to some extent.

687
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,199
Do you have a friend at the moment?
- No, not anymore.

688
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,189
Wasn't there a guy,
this sculptor?

689
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,760
It didn't work.

690
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,558
What's going on?
- I've something in the shoe.

691
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,469
Mommy!

692
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,879
I don't understand it. It's not the
picture that I've ordered.

693
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,916
No, the one you ordered,
didn't feel right.

694
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,398
Didn't feel right?

695
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,593
Why did you do that?

696
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,509
It's better that way.
Alexander threatened Lilli.

697
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:27,391
Threatened? What a nonsense.
That's her brother! Happy children!

698
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,399
I think it has something. I've no
expertise about painting, but Lilli

699
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,069
is made beautiful. She looks so tender.

700
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,159
Where's your bathroom, please?
- Out the door and then left, please.

701
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,629
It is this photo, right?
- Which Photo?

702
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,352
This one.

703
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,318
Oh, the one from the boarding school.
- What?

704
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:04,956
Yes, I got it from a classmate,
Johannes, when I got Alex's stuff.

705
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:09,118
Are you sure?
- Yes, definitely.

706
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,194
I think we have to go now.
Andi is waiting.

707
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,153
Thank you. I'm out.

708
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:23,398
We are going to my aunt's birthday.

709
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,639
You deliver it at our home? - Yes.
Thank you. Lilli?

710
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,560
I'll be right there!

711
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,153
I like it very much.

712
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:50,439
It looks as if we're smiling
at each other in a mirror.

713
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,595
Thank you.

714
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:09,032
The guy must be retarded.
It looks totally stupid.

715
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:13,757
I don't want a picture, I want Alex!
- But he scored very good with Lilli.

716
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:18,351
That alone is worth the money.
You like it too, don't you?

717
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:22,439
No wonder!
- I mean, I should try that:

718
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:27,596
"Oh, you wanted a red wall?
Well, I've just painted it yellow.

719
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,471
Yellow is also quite beautiful.
Red didn't feel right, you know. "

720
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:37,993
20,000 Euro! I'd be fired immediately.
- He's an artist, not a decorator, Wanda.

721
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,278
Awesome, an artist.
- I like it.

722
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:45,279
Now you like it. First a huge rebellion,
that you shall go there.

723
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,996
And since I don't like it, you like it!
- What do you mean now again?

724
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,795
If you don't like it, I'll take it with me.
- With you? Where to?

725
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,878
Well, I'll hang it up
in my room.

726
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,875
Hello.

727
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,760
Sara!
- Hello, Lilli!

728
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,831
Hello, little Indian.

729
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,360
Uncle Thomas!

730
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,394
Well, you're fine?

731
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:38,237
Next week it's a year, huh?
- Ow!

732
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:42,319
Have you cut yourself? Badly?
- No, it's nothing.

733
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,435
Thank you.

734
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,193
And how does that feel?

735
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,713
It'll be ok, I think.

736
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,753
And the two over there?

737
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:12,994
Do you think,
they'd grieve like that for me too?

738
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,555
Lilli!

739
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:25,389
Can this idiot stay with you?
He doesn't let me paint my picture.

740
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:30,833
Come here, sweetheart. You'll
stay a bit with us, will you?

741
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,918
Lilli, come here,
I want to show you something!

742
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:41,909
Look, I've painted that for you.
- Thank you.

743
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:46,830
That's us eating today. That's Grandpa
and Alex. They are waving at us.

744
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:53,115
Let me in. Let me in.
Mom said I may play with you.

745
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,915
I'm going to cut you into pieces with
my magic sword. And fry you.

746
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:05,194
Or put you on the stove. Or I can
also cut your ears off.

747
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,558
Now look what you did.

748
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,880
Are you crying now?

749
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:41,112
I want my brother back.
- You can take me as a brother.

750
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:28,468
I think we haven't changed anything
here since Sarah's birth.

751
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:32,559
The sofa, for example,
is really ready to be thrown out.

752
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:37,279
Maybe you can have it upholstered.
With the baby everything starts all over again.

753
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,154
I don't know why you need to change
something. It's all good.

754
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:45,159
I will spend most the coming months
on the couch again.

755
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:52,792
Enjoy it.
I can get the fabric.

756
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:56,469
What would you like?
- No idea.

757
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:04,276
Paul, why aren't you going upstairs?
Both of you!

758
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:08,038
But you call, when it's icecream.
- No.

759
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:11,273
Dad, you'll call us!
- Yes, sure.

760
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:17,519
Let the filling be.
- No, it tastes good.

761
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:21,599
A warm yellow maybe.
That's not very non-sensitive.

762
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:25,679
True, yellow would be very nice.
- I thought you were leaving?

763
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,758
So what?
- Lilli, how's it going with "Alice"?

764
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,151
I imagine it's exhausting
to dance such a leading part.

765
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,039
I don't play the lead anymore.
I'm fired.

766
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,553
Really?
- I knew it.

767
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,479
I'll call her and undo it.
You have a depression.

768
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,388
No, you don't do it.
I don't want to dance "Alice" anymore.

769
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,479
Musical is nothing for me.
- Wow, two years for nothing.

770
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,479
You don't mean that?
- She'll dance her first leading role...

771
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,479
just next year. You are behaving...
- Mind your own business.

772
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,479
I don't want to dance anymore.
I just want to sing, I like it.

773
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,479
What do you think how many girls
have a very nice voice?

774
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,479
Are you doing this education only
to sing commercial jingles afterwards?

775
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,639
Ask me why, Dad.
- Do you think I don't know it?

776
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,959
Stop whining, Lilli. Do you want
Alex's death to ruin your life too?

777
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:32,712
Sometimes I feel
I've not only lost my brother.

778
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,158
Your father's right, and you know it.

779
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:50,391
Exactly, you are in agreement.
Even if you otherwise don't agree.

780
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:55,071
But here you are once again
a hard-hitting concrete wall.

781
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:57,715
Awesome.

782
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,795
Max?

783
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:20,639
Ah, Lilli, again?
- What are you doing here?

784
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,955
I try out something.
You can help me. Look at this.

785
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:28,868
You push the trigger here.
- And what happens then?

786
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,471
Prush it until I say "now".
And then you turn on the lamp here.

787
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,558
Yes? But remain on the trigger.
- Ok.

788
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,992
Yes.
- Right?

789
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,072
Yes, good!

790
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,640
And now...

791
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:53,355
Lamp. And out!

792
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,873
Well! It needed to be now.

793
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,873
That interests me.

794
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:07,796
Picasso played also with light.
Looks really great.

795
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,753
What a nightmare.

796
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:14,078
What, that picture?
- No, the picture is good.

797
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:19,999
But it's supposed to actually
please your mother. - Yes.

798
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,789
Now I like it.
- Well, that's fine too.

799
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:33,839
There, that's it. That's what I mean.
Have you seen it?

800
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:39,394
Beautiful how he's moving.
Our runner! Or?

801
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:44,119
He loved snow. He always
freaked out about the first flakes.

802
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:48,074
Left everything and
and ran outside.

803
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:52,159
You loved him very much, right?

804
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,679
I didn't always love him.

805
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,909
Everything he did
was so perfect.

806
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,999
I hated that.
I thought Alex is never sad.

807
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:15,514
He has no reason.
He has no real problem.

808
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,953
I'm such an asshole.

809
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:28,598
Show me how to dance.

810
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,753
Honestly, I can't.

811
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,390
And now?
- You must guide me, you're the man.

812
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,478
You gotta show what you want.

813
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,113
But it isn't much.

814
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,635
Good!

815
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:42,074
Say now: I, Max Hollander, am gay.

816
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,360
Real gay.

817
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,479
That seems to fascinate you?

818
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,433
Well, yes. Say it again.

819
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:01,319
Right now I find it quite difficult.

820
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,000
I must go.

821
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,953
We'll meet soon, ok?

822
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,120
Are you awake?
- No.

823
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:38,512
I want to visit Alexander's boarding school.
I must find out something. - Good luck.

824
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,473
Are you coming? Please.

825
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,674
No.
- Great. I'll pick you up by 10.

826
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,913
Hello, Johannes.
- Hey.

827
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:22,279
Sorry, I had to get this stuff.
- Nice that it worked.

828
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,358
This is Max, a friend.
- Hello.

829
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:30,634
You have test soon, right?
- I'll wait outside.

830
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:35,439
I'm hungry. Do you want anything?
- Yes, I'd take a coffee.

831
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:38,472
Alex has told a lot about you.
- Really?

832
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:40,515
Yep.

833
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:45,871
Now it's a year ago
but it doesn't get any better.

834
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:51,114
I can imagine.
- A coffee, please.

835
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:56,438
You took the picture, right?

836
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:04,355
Max has painted
a picture of Alex and me.

837
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:09,315
He used this photo,
because the expression in Alex's face.

838
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:13,069
He thinks Alex looks
as if he's in love.

839
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:16,875
I agree somehow,
what do you think?

840
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,879
It's something in the eyes.
My father told me

841
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,233
that you took the picture.
I thought that if Alex was gay

842
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,954
and didn't dare, right?
My parents would freak out.

843
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:37,473
Perhaps it could be the reason and...
Sorry. It's totally stupid.

844
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,195
You need to go?
- No, I've still a moment.

845
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:45,871
I'd love to provide a solution.
But Alex and I,

846
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,549
we shared a room, nothing more.

847
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:57,279
And Alex had nothing with guys
I don't think so.

848
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,638
He was just madly closed.

849
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:05,719
I mean, he was cheerful.
Always cool sayings and such.

850
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,799
And there was nobody
having anything against him.

851
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:14,794
But actually nobody knew
much about him.

852
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,959
He was for people exactly
how they wanted him.

853
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:23,039
Always stay cool, you know?

854
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:26,198
Maybe he was a bit alone.

855
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:35,031
Sorry. I mean that I had nothing
going on with your brother.

856
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,434
But I remember very well that night,
when I took the picture.

857
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,439
We hung around, smoked,
drank tequila or something.

858
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:50,472
It was already 2:00 or so.

859
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:56,516
I played with my camera,
and we talked about our homes.

860
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,396
I told about my parents,
and he about you.

861
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:09,519
Exactly, that's the expression
in his face.

862
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:14,158
He talked about you.

863
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,040
Here you go.
- Thank you.

864
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:43,599
I've fucked it up...
- Great, just put the gas station on fire.

865
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,315
Yes.

866
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:53,036
Don't take yourself so important.
Maybe it wasn't even about you.

867
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:56,709
Then we all screwed
it up together.

868
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:01,676
You must stop looking for a reason
'cause there's probably more than just one.

869
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:10,514
And you must stop to be mad at him.
- Mad? I'm not mad!

870
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,758
Yes, because he makes you feel guilty.

871
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:18,799
I know that, believe me.
I know it pretty well.

872
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,633
Come on, let's continue.

873
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,833
What will happen to me?

874
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:35,112
What do you want from me?

875
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:39,149
Who I am, am I me? How strange?

876
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:43,073
Leave me, go away. Help!

877
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,913
We'll get you, chase you through
the dirt, we'll grab you...

878
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:08,231
It's me, Lilli.
I've been thinking about the coat.

879
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,109
You wanted to go shopping with me.

880
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:20,074
Oh, forget that fucking coat, Mom.
Actually...

881
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,879
I just wanted to say
it will good again. Yes?

882
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,360
It will be good again.

883
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,236
Good night.

884
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:46,399
It's me Lilli.
I've been thinking about the coat.

885
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:57,189
You know already,
what do you'll do next?

886
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:01,749
Look to the right. No idea.

887
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:08,079
I probably need to get out here.
Find faces,

888
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:12,393
people in the streets...
- Sounds good.

889
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:23,149
Well, this picture is at least ready now.

890
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:32,158
I must go. I have an appointment.

891
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:38,594
Oh wait, again.
I've got a little thing for you.

892
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:42,389
I want to give it to you. Look here.

893
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:47,719
Well, it was an attempt.
Isn't all that bad, right?

894
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:57,635
Thank you.

895
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,320
Let me see.

896
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:15,914
I'll miss you.
- Yes, yes, I understand.

897
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:28,355
About a year ago
we've lost Alexander.

898
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,438
He took his own life.

899
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:36,278
We still don't know why.

900
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:46,237
And who are they now?
- The children of my customer.

901
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,920
This is Lilli.

902
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:58,274
She's studying singing and dancing in Munich.
- Singing and dancing.

903
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:01,233
You can study it?

904
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:05,871
And the mother wanted a beautiful
paintings of her two beautiful children?

905
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,880
That's right.

906
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:14,591
I love these rich people.
What would we do without them?

907
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:35,160
Who is it?

908
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,560
My father.

909
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,758
Hey, Stella, are you coming?

910
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:47,469
Hi.
- Hello, Tobi. Happy birthday.

911
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:50,115
Thank you.

912
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:54,678
How was Spain? Salamanca?

913
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:56,595
Cool.

914
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,753
I want to give you this.

915
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,315
Thank you.

916
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:16,158
Is that your girlfriend?
- Yes.

917
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:21,513
What's her name?
- Stella.

918
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:24,478
Stella. Pretty.

919
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:30,358
Yes, well, then. Thank you for the picture.

920
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:35,318
Well, maybe you have it inside..

921
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:39,038
Maybe it's snowing tonight.
- Ok.

922
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:44,756
Ciao, Dad.

923
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:48,920
Well, take care.

924
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,793
Bye, Mr. Hollander!

925
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:04,515
Goodbye, Stella.
Could you take care of the picture?

926
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:08,474
I don't want it gets wet, ok?
- Will do!

927
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:28,279
What are you doing?
- I couldn't sleep.

928
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:35,032
So I thought I could as well start.
- It's only in two weeks.

929
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:38,438
Everything shall be beautiful
when she's coming.

930
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:53,474
Want one?
- Why not.

931
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:12,392
Have you already told her?
- What?

932
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,680
That you move out.

933
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:20,278
No. I'll do it when she's here.

934
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:27,229
We had also
good times together, right?

935
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,235
Absolutely!

936
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:53,470
Alex! We stop that nonsense now!

937
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:56,113
It's enough!

938
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:59,118
Ok, ok, apologies accepted.

939
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:10,118
