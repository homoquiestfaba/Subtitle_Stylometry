1
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,086
Henry, are you almost through
with the pool?

2
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,454
Yes, Miss Clara.

3
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,358
Just, "Clara. "Miss Clara
Makes me sound like a

4
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,492
school marm.

5
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,028
Yes miss ... er, Clara.

6
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,398
Maybe Henry would like a
glass of wine?

7
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,300
It might help you unwind after a

8
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:07,368
hard day's work?

9
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,138
I'm okay, But If you dont
mind i would like

10
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,339
to taking a shower
before I head out ...

11
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:14,442
Now really i don't see
why you don't see

12
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,844
why you just move
into the guest room.

13
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,846
Well, for one thing,
my girlfriend would kill me.

14
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,617
laughter.....

15
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,619
All right Well, I'll guess
just ... go ahead and take

16
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:26,754
that shower, then?

17
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,989
Now, If you wouldn't mind
locking up after your

18
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,125
done because the girls
and I are going out in a

19
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:31,892
bit.

20
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,627
You got it.

21
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,104
I dont know what
has gotten into you?

22
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:48,809
I'm sorry, it struck
me as funny!

23
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,844
Oh, grow up!

24
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,101
Miss Clara? ... I mean.. Clara!!

25
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,269
Edwina?

26
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,739
Victoria?

27
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,476
Everything okay out there?

28
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,202
Hello?

29
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,140
Miss Clara?

30
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,447
Victoria, is that you?

31
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,258
Hello?

32
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,904
Hello?

33
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,108
Victoria?

34
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,145
Miss Clara?

35
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,385
I know theres some
one down here.

36
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,927
Hello ?

37
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,727
Uhhh, I thought we agreed not to
do this on the new floor,

38
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,764
I got carried away ...

39
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,067
I don't think it worked.

40
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,270
I don't think it did ether.
Where going to have to face it,

41
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,240
the occasional handyman
isn't going to cut it anymore.

42
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,678
Where going to make a
major commitment.

43
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,781
You mean ...?

44
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,350
Where going to have to
claimed our mates.

45
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:45,753
What about Henry?

46
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:51,258
I don't know about you, but I
could go for some steak tartar..

47
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,206
SO, this the place?

48
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:09,176
Yep, according to the online ad
and Map-Buddy. You

49
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:09,943
want to see the print-out?

50
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,211
No.

51
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,047
Man, I don't know about this.
Looks like some swanky digs.

52
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,749
What?!? This whole
thing was your idea!

53
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,218
Yeah, but I thought it would be
more low-rent than this.

54
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,053
Rufus, Don't tell me your
chickening out.

55
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,622
I'm not chickening out, okay?
I'm being cautious.

56
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:23,791
Its the same thing.

57
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,893
We still have time to apply down
at The Bronko Burger ...

58
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,295
Guys, we're not working some
lame fast food job! Ok...

59
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,831
How are we going to be popular
if we're just

60
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,632
flipping burgers?!?

61
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,333
Dude where not popular...

62
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,203
Right, Coopersmith.
We're not popular.

63
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,371
COOPERSMITH
Huh....

64
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,874
Like you said, Ok this
was my idea. But look at

65
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,876
This place man.. I mean, these
ladies have to be rich right?

66
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,144
So?

67
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,479
So? They can hire anybody they
want. As in "professionals.

68
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,581
We don't even look professional.

69
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:49,750
I have a laptop ...

70
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,752
Darwin? Read the ad again?

71
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:59,092
"Wealthy single woman seeking
young, agile men for full-time

72

live-in maintenance and personal
masseuse positions. Experience

73
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,398
not necessary, non-smoking
college students preferred.

74
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,735
Sure, it sounds great on
paper it'sss...

75
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:10,904
Wiping up after some old ladys
doesn't sound all

76
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,672
We're right at their front
door and you guys

77
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,041
just want to go home?

78
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,009
Ya and now that you're pointing
that out, We are at their front

79
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,144
door so we should probably...

80
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,312
Shut up, Darwin. What's the
worst that can happen?

81
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,580
They can say "no.

82

Ya they can say "no.But whats
happen if we leave here and dont

83

84
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,753
Well I have to have to move back
in with my parents 'til fall.

85
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,020
Right again.

86

Your going to have to move in

uncle's computer store. And I'm

Umm Well, we're here

104
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,953

work here

105
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,287

106
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:37,925
Oh,The ad! Well, you're so

Great!

109
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,495
Do we get our own rooms?

110
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,699
Well we will see about that.
I would like you to meet my

111
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,767
sisters.

112
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,735
Sisters?

113
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:50,203

115
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,564
Uh ... thanks.

116
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,101
Ohh, gracious me,
where are my manners?

117
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,605
These are my
two lovely sisters...

118
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,975
They call this one
"Victoria" ...

119
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,678
... and this one "Edwina".

120
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:33,813
Hi...

121
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:37,050
It's a pleasure to meet
all three of you.

122
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,418
Quite.

123
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,453
Please, have something to drink!

124
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,990
Uh ... thanks ...

125
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:43,924
I'm thirsty ...

126
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,861
That's an interesting necklace.

127
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:55,903
Well, thank you.Ohh It's been in
the family for generations.

128
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,938
You boys look a little nervous.

129
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,174
We're fine. Really.

130
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,177
Are you a virgin to all this?

131
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,480
Uh ... excuse me?

132
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:11,551
What my sister so eloquently
meant to say was, "Are you new

133
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,420
to living away from home?".

134
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:17,724
Yes. Of course.
That's what I meant.

135
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:21,228
Oh, well.. Ya you know,we're
college students. So we still

136
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,562
live on campus?

137
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,698
Ya We're all sophomores at the
university. I mean, we will be.

138
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,135
We're all kind of looking for
summer jobs..

139
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,602
And we're hiring..

140
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:33,540
Yes, we ate our last one ...

141
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,076
Please bear with us, gentlemen.
I'm afraid the three of us have

142
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:36,977
a reputation

143
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,679
for being a little on the
eccentric side.

144
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,548
You join one witches' coven ...

145
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,183
Ohhh, the Eighties

146
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,520
That's a joke, fellas.
It's ok to laugh.

147
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,022
A joke... Right...

148
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,894
Well I think its time to
probably ask the usuall

149
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:55,428
questions.

150
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,830
Do you smoke?

151
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:58,831
Nope.

152
00:14:58,865 --> 00:14:59,899
Smoking is bad for you.

153
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,970
Smoking cigarettes is
bad for you.

154
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,305
Lots of friends? A girlfriend?

155
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,373
Lots of girlfriends?

156
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,542
We're, kinda in the middle
of girlfriends right now.

157
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:13,981
You like what you've see?

158
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:15,448
Huh?

159
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,549
Do you like the place?

160
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:21,654
Um ... yes. It's very nice.
It's um, kind of reminds me of

161
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,656
home. You know, if my home was a

162
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,591
mansion in Malibu ...

163
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:31,064
We have three job openings,
which is perfect for you

164
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,033
gentlemen. We're looking for a

165
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:37,504
full-time pool maintenance man,
a cook

166
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,940
and a personal masseuse.

167
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:45,445
But we expect all three of you
to perform house-cleaning

168
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,714
duties, landscaping ...

169
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,182
Bartending ...

170
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,918
No problem.

171
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,023
Well if there are no more
questions, I think it's safe

172
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,825
to say, that you are hired!

173
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,229
They get my vote.

174
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,163
Absolutely.

175
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,232
Wow. Really?

176
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,867
We brought resumes' ...

177
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,069
I didn't.

178
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,571
Shouldn't we fill out an
application or a W-Two form.?

179
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,307
I think a handshake
will do nicely.

180
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,743
We'll pay you in cash, of
course. No need to get the

181
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:17,877
government involved ...

182
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,280
There's a catch, right?

183
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,948
No catch.

184
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,685
By the way,Um which
one of you is the cook?

185
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,820
Ummmm..

186
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,893
Ohh Crap...Great! It's me!

187
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:54,981
This is the dining room.
Breakfast is at Ten, and dinner

188
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:55,682
around Seven..

189
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,254
And the occasional brunch. Don't
worry; we're easy to cook for.

190
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,391
No filet mignon or foie gras.

191
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,459
And no junk food.
We're watching our figures.

192
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:06,693
Ka!

193
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,197
We don't each much ...dinner.

194
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,201
Pardon me for asking ...
You three are single?

195
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:18,271
Who needs husbands when you
have ex-husbands?

196
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,941
Or can hire three young tasty
morsels like yourselves?

197
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:28,481
What my sister means to say is
that, we do enjoy the company.

198
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:34,020
Its just that we can be a little
boring, I mean we came to a

199
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,958
place in life where we are just
three old spinsters.

200
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:39,926
You? Spinsters?

201
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:45,132
Well, we're not dead yet, Its
just we enjoy are peace and

202
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,168
quiet. See we grew up overseas,

203
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:54,407
on an isolated estate in South
America. We ... prefer our own

204
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:54,507
company.

205
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,345
Excluding the three of you,
of course.

206
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:03,816
Besides, if we get bored, we
can always order take out.

207
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:45,838
Darwin...

208
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,174
What the hell, Rufus?!?

209
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,609
You were having a nightmare ...

210
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,143
Yeah. I was having a nightmare.

211
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:51,778
What are you doing in my room?

212
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,045
We got a problem.

213
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,915
Gee, you think? You know,it's
a good thing i took home ec

214
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:56,983
high school otherwise,
I wouldn't have

215
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,084
known how to make the veal
Parmesan I had to make

216
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,318
last night ...

217
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:02,188
Yeah, and it was delicious ok..
Back to me: I don't know

218
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,490
anything about being a
"personal masseuse.

219
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,158
Let me recap. You two drafted me
as the cook.. I am not a cook.

220
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:09,562
Im not a cook.. If you wanted 
 me to be the masseuse guy

221
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:10,897
somebody else should have
taken the chef job.

222
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,231
I don't know how to cook,
either!

223
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,435
You two wanted a "fun summer
job, It's not my fault if you

224
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,404
don't have any marketable
skills..

225
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,906
So, what am I supposed to do?

226
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,543
Well have you ever given
somebody a massage before?

227
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,644
No ...

228
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,416
Go ahead take off your shirt.
I'll show you how..

229
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,857
All right,,,Feel that? You have
to find out where they're most

230
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,792
,tense then knead the muscles
to get

231
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,461
the oxygen flowing ...

232
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,668
This feels pretty good!

233
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,340
Hey, I wanted to ask you
something. You notice that

234
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,408
necklace Clara was wearing?

235
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,109
Could you get my neck while
you're back there?

236
00:22:57,143 --> 00:23:00,447
I'm being serious! I know I've
seen that necklace before.

237
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,650
I wasn't paying attention.I mean
Did you see those women?!? I was

238
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,685
kind of preoccupied
with what they weren't wearing,

239
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,654
so, no, I didn't
notice any necklace.

240
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:08,855
Okay, fine.

241
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,458
Hey, Seriously, man, if you
want out of this, just quit. Ka,

242
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,792
Coopersmith and I can handle it.

243
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,994
Coopersmith won't "handle it
and you know it.

244
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,696
Okay, I'll handle it. Just
don't stay here if you

245
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,397
don't want to.

246
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,299
It's not that ... Its just
there's something weird

247
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,435
about all this.You know we
get the job right off

248
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,404
the bat? We're getting free
room and board, great

249
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,640
pay, these women are
extremely hot and They didn't

250
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,276
even asks for references? I mean
something about this doesn't

251
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,311
any of this seem a little
off to you

252
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,847
Don't look a gift horse in
the mouth.

253
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:38,050
Speaking of Coopersmith, how's
he handling his new job

254
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,687
Are you kidding me? He's never
been around a swimming pool

255
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,754
In his entire life...

256
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:11,190
I guess you will be next
Mr. Coopersmith ...

257
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,840
I'm ready for your massage ...

258
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:30,176
Really? You're quite
overdressed.

259
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,211
Overdressed?

260
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:38,517
Yes. I like my masseuses to show
a little more skin. It's a trust

261
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,621
issue. The more you show, the
more I feel comfortable showing.

262
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:46,058
Please, go change into something
a little more trustworthy

263
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:49,428
In fact, when I get back,
I expect that shirt to be gone.

264
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,502
Which one of us is getting the
massage here?!?

265
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,438
Great! Now, I'm hearing things!

266
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,283
Whoa, what's your problem?!?

267
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,650
Being the pool cleaner sucks!

268
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,018
Yeah, that's why I took the
masseuse job.

269
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,620
Well, I want to trade.

270
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,556
No way, Jose'. That girl Edwina
is making me strip down for

271
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,257
her massage.

272
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,792
Dammit!

273
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,894
Hey, man, this was your idea ...

274
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,563
Ya, i wanted to work here all
summer for three hot ladies.

275
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:53,932
Not get sunburnt by
the pool all day..

276
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:16,054
Looks like your massage is
getting postponed.

277
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,556
Maybe he's the pizza
delivery guy?

278
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,791
Ya, he's delivering something,
all right.

279
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:21,327
Don't rub off your bad karma
on me.I was having a

280
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,027
great morning.

281
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,171
Hello!!!

282
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,675
Are you ... Clara ?

283
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,110
Are you breakfast?

284
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,813
I've been every meal in the
book. But you can call me

285
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,149
"AnsonMam.

286
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:44,816
I like your manners.

287
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,586
I try. Should I come in?

288
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,757
Well if we're going to come in
your going to have to loose

289
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,260
about ninety percent of that
outfit.

290
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:58,430
See we like to just cut right
to the chase here.

291
00:34:58,464 --> 00:34:59,665
"We?

292
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:04,670
Me and my sisters and I hope
you've been taking your vitamins

293
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,472
Oh, I come prepared for
any situation ...

294
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,094
One bed? I like how
you women think.

295
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,374
Time to sleep ...

296
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,621
Is he ready?

297
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,022
He seems to be.

298
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,792
We should be sure.

299
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:37,696
We only have a few more days,
and "being sure" will be

300
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,831
least of are problems.

301
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,268
Girls? Can we save the
dramatics for later?

302
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:47,072
Ka.. Light the candle.

303
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:31,783
By Ba'al and by Carthin, I call
to thee. By Legba by Zuul, I

304
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:36,822
pledge my life to thee, sweet
Kala-bast

305
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:39,925
The goddess in all of us...

306
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,761
I pledge my life for thee,
sweet Kala-bast ...

307
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:49,167
Within this candle's flame, let
the spirit of thy servant flow .

308
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,670
Let the spirit of thy
servant flow ...

309
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:53,805
The powder ...

310
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:04,082
Let this powder be as your
ashes, the dust of thy

311
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,517
servant's flesh ...

312
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:07,519
Thy servant's flesh ...

313
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,422
Thy servant's flesh ...

314
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:18,964
The oil ...

315
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:58,036
And with the sacred oil let it
be as your blood..

316
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:02,007
let it flow over you, give
us eternity ...

317
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,176
GRANT US ETERNITY!!!

318
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,035
GRANT US ETERNITY!!!

319
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,860
It worked.

320
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:59,465
Ohh, Such a handsome boy. Too
bad he was such a jerk..

321
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:02,367
The others should be ready
soon enough.

322
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,102
We have one small problem.

323
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:04,436
Which is?

324
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,974
Our chosen ones must come
to us of their own free will.

325
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,676
We need to step up the game.

326
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:14,713
In a few more days, Kala-bast
will no longer show favor on us.

327
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:21,086
They can surely be persuaded.
And we can surely persuade them.

328
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,788
Talk later. Eat now ...

329
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,604
As you can see, I changed my
wardrobe.

330
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,205
Are you ready for your massage?

331
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:43,408
Put your shirt back on. I need
you to run a quick errand for

332
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,142
me..

333
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:44,643
Okay ...

334
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,513
Those are the keys
to Anson's car.

335
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:48,847
You're talking about the guy who
showed up here a little while

336
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,215
ago, right?

337
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:54,452
Wow, smart and pretty. Yes. I'm
afraid he had a little bit too

338
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,087
much to drink and had to take a

339
00:40:56,121 --> 00:41:00,091
cab home. What I need you to do
is, drive his car to the public

340
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,860
parking lot next to the Belasco

341
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:05,430
Bank building downtown. Leave
the keys in the ignition and his

342
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,199
car unlocked. I'll call him and
let him know you delivered it.

343
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,367
But ...

344
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,402
Trust me, he'll pick it up as
soon as you get there.

345
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,804
do it myself, but ......

346
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,507
I just painted my nails.
You understand.

347
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,542
How do I get back?

348
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,476
You need change for the bus?

349
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:22,147
No ... I should be okay ...

350
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,151
Thank you, Rufus. You're a doll.
You can oil me up when

351
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:27,318
you get back.

352
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,729
I was listening from the
kitchen. This doesn't strike

353
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:39,197
you as a little off?

354
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,133
Man, who knows? Maybe he was
their dealer or something?

355
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,535
I think he was a gigolo.

356
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,203
A ... what?!?

357
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,272
I think they hired
somebody for sex.

358
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,740
Thats why they got us right?

359
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:52,143
Right. That's why I think they
hired somebody for sex.

360
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,979
Also, I have a really good view
of the front drive from the

361
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,315
kitchen. I haven't seen a
cab all Morning.

362
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,917
Maybe he walked?

363
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,152
Or maybe they chopped him up
into little bits and hid

364
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:01,987
him in the basement.

365
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,089
This place doesn't have a
basement.

366
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:06,391
Look, I'm just saying, Things
are getting weirder by the

367
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:07,693
minute.

368
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:10,596
Ya whatever, Man, I got things
to do. Like I keep saying: don't

369
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:12,063
look a gift horse in the mouth.

370
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:16,134
Gift horses don't eat
people ...!

371
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,713
Coopersmith? You okay?

372
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,645
Coopersmith! Hey wake up!

373
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:32,823
Yes, Coopersmith ...
Come to mama....

374
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,029
We're ready for you,
Coopersmith.

375
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:57,442
Eww.... He's almost too
good to waste ...

376
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:00,077
Maybe we can keep him ...

377
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,212
As a pet.

378
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:03,248
What's happening ...?

379
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:05,616
How did I get here?

380
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,852
I sent for you, Don't you
remember?

381
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,019
No.

382
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:10,255
Well your here.

383
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:11,522
I dont remember..

384
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:12,590
Mhhhm..

385
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:16,227
Dont you ever think about you,
me and my sisters?

386
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:27,738
We want you to stay,
Coopersmith.

387
00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:29,206
What's going on here?

388
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,941
We want to play with you,
Coopersmith.

389
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:35,313
But you have to want it.
You have to ask for it.

390
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:36,747
Really ask for it ...

391
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:37,948
Ohhh.. Please?

392
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:40,985
Put your hands on them
Coopersmith.

393
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,889
That's right, Coopersmith ...
just relax ...

394
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:49,927
I... I.... This is,, This is to
weird for me....

395
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,996
Don't just touch me and
walk away!

396
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,499
We want a little steak with are
sizzle.

397
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:57,602
We want to play! Just say "yes!

398
00:53:57,635 --> 00:53:59,770
I shouldn't be going ...

399
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:01,806
I dont think you will be leaving
soon...

400
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:10,981
CLARA
Time to sleep ...

401
00:54:57,428 --> 00:55:00,264
You should have let us have our
fun with you Coopersmith.

402
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,433
Then you would have

403
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:04,068
gone out with a smile ...

404
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:08,238
Light the candle.

405
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:50,915
By Ba'al and by Carthis, I call
upon thee. By Legba and by

406
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,183
Zuul, I pledge my life for thee,

407
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:55,886
sweet Kala-bast, our
goddess of us all ...

408
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,757
I pledge my life for thee, sweet
Kala-bast our goddess ...

409
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,928
Within this candle's flame, let
the spirit of thy servant flow.

410
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,564
Let the spirit of thy
servant flow ...

411
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,270
The powder ...

412
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,977
Let this powder be as
your ashes,

413
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,181
The dust of thy servant's
flesh ...

414
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,517
Thy servant's flesh ...

415
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:51,976
The oil ...

416
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:41,358
And let this sacred oil be as
your blood ...

417
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:45,395
let it pump over you,and
give us eternity ...

418
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,308
GIVE US ETERNITY!!!

419
00:57:58,342 --> 00:58:00,344
GIVE US ETERNITY!!!

420
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:30,340
And Now, we have to move faster.
Kala-bast has become impatient.

421
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:33,010
And you don't want to see an
angry goddess ...

422
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,245
The other two will be
harder to convince.

423
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:40,450
The solstice is too close.
The time for subtlety is over.

424
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:43,554
I want our mates ready
for the final ritual.

425
00:58:43,588 --> 00:58:46,624
How? Without anybody suspecting?

426
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:50,160
That's the least of our worries.
Nobody will come looking for

427
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,896
the boys until it's too late.

428
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:54,799
Lets get to work, ladies.

429
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,747
We gotta talk.

430
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,783
Can we talk after my cereal?

431
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:20,718
Hey..

432
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:21,952
We gotta talk now.

433
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,154
About?

434
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,926
I just saw the sisters
turn into cougars.

435
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:31,996
Is that a euphemism ...?

436
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:32,830
No,

437
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:35,265
I really saw them turned
into cougars.

438
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:39,937
Big cats. They put Coopersmith
into some kind of a trance and

439
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,972
there was this ritual and
they just

440
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:43,073
...kkkk!.. Cougars

441
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,410
Dude, please sell me whatever
you're smoking..!!

442
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:50,447
I'm being serious! I realized
where I saw Clara's amulet.

443
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,017
It's the same design as this
South American totem on

444
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,351
display at the Natural
History Museum.

445
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,252
Kala-bast.

446
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:58,655
The "who in the "what now ...?

447
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:03,293
Kala-bast. There was a whole
tribe of Amazons that worshipped

448
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,562
her centuries ago. Ka
they believed

449
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:09,767
that Kala-bast kept them fed,
kept them healthy and gave them

450
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,936
eternal life. All they
had to do in

451
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:15,239
return for that was mate with
mortal men from the other

452
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:16,506
tribes and -- here comes the

453
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:20,010
important part! --
eat human flesh.

454
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:22,246
What do you think happened to
that Anson guy who showed up

455
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,314
here? You think he
just left in a

456
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,717
cab? No! They ate him!!!!!

457
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:29,486
Oh, my God. I mean you have
lost it my friend..

458
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,722
They said they grew up in South
America, right?

459
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:36,326
So maybe they found that amulet
and they're using it to, I don't

460
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,294
know, make themselves

461
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:39,730
young again? Or make
themselves wealthy..

462
01:01:41,565 --> 01:01:44,368
Alright, look, man, I'm feeling
a little under the weather...

463
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:46,170
I just wanna eat my
breakfast, do

464
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,138
my work for the day and crash.

465
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:52,342
This is probably more than I
can deal with ...

466
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,643
Something's up with you.

467
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:57,581
Are you having weird dreams?
Wake up tired?

468
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:03,453
Ya, Me too. In fact, that's what
woke me up this morning.

469
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:05,055
It's them. They're doing

470
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:06,290
this to all of us ...!

471
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:09,259
Look you need to go home,
Darwin. Seriously. You can't

472
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:10,394
handle this.

473
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,963
I'm not going any where
not after what i just saw.

474
01:02:12,997 --> 01:02:15,299
I'm gonna go eat my cereal
outside. Have fun being a

475
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:16,333
crazy person..

476
01:02:57,875 --> 01:03:01,611
Your little friend Darwin
doesn't want to play anymore.

477
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:03,413
Witch makes us have no use

478
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,983
for him, Except for a morcel.

479
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:07,751
Any ideas?

480
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:09,353
Lance.

481
01:03:09,386 --> 01:03:09,419
Lance?

482
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:15,059
The most popular guy on campus..
He would be perfect for you.

483
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:19,229
Hmmm. You can get him here?
Today?

484
01:03:19,263 --> 01:03:19,997
Yes.

485
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:21,598
"Yes what?

486
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:23,333
Yes, mistress ...

487
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:26,070
Good you will be richly
rewarded.

488
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:49,826
How did you nerds swing a
place like this?

489
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:52,863
Man, you'd better not be lying
about this party!

490
01:03:52,897 --> 01:03:54,164
Would I lie to you?

491
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:56,766
Maybe .. if you thought your
life was in jeopardy.

492
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,068
My life isn't in jeopardy ...

493
01:03:58,102 --> 01:03:59,303
Not yet.

494
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:10,881
Wow ..What big, strong, rippling
muscles you have ...

495
01:04:10,915 --> 01:04:13,683
Coopersmith didn't tell me
somebody like you would be here.

496
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:17,054
I'm sure Coopersmith
didn't tell you a lot of things.

497
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:30,300
I guess you're going to find
those out for yourself now ..

498
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,623
You think I'm crazy now? Since
when does Coopersmith pal

499
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:55,325
around with Lance? In fact,

500
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,327
Lance is the guy who threw
Coopersmith's bunk off of the

501
01:04:57,361 --> 01:04:58,395
dorm roof a few months ago!

502
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:01,598
Lance is here to replace you.

503
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:02,499
Replace me?!?

504
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:03,833
What the hell are you
talking about?!?

505
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:06,103
The sisters need their mates in
order to survive. you didn't

506
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:07,304
want to cooperate with them.

507
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:10,040
Now, Lance joins us and you get
to be the feast for the

508
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:10,941
solstice.

509
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:16,246
Snap out of it, Rufus...
Rufus Snap out of it,..

510
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:49,379
Coopersmith ...!!!

511
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:09,466
Coopersmith ...!!!

512
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,902
You got to come with me...
Coopersmith.. I don't know what

513
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:14,804
they told you, but they're
gonna end up killing all of us.

514
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:19,509
They have chosen to be their
mates. . All hale Kala-bast!

515
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:21,745
You're too late, Darwin.

516
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:24,148
Unlike you, they've fallen
completely under our under

517
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:25,215
our spell.

518
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:29,253
And unlike them, you're
about to be eaten ...

519
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:48,272
I thought you pretty boys
loved cougars?

520
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:57,914
I think Im going to eat you with
my human teeth...

521
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,057
There'd better be a good
explanation why I'm all covered

522
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:41,691
in oil ...!

523
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,604
So ... they really were cougars?

524
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:55,905
RUFUS
Like, literally?

525
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,108
Yaa...

526
01:07:58,142 --> 01:08:00,344
Yoo , Lance, think you could
we get a ride back into town?

527
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:01,611
Get bent, nerd!

528
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:07,317
Looks like where walking ....

529
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:09,653
Never mind that, what about
the rest of the summer?

530
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:12,122
No way am I flipping burgers
after this!

531
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:16,193
Oh, I don't know ... I think we
will get a few dollars from a

532
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:16,860
museum...

533
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:18,862
Are you serious?

534
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:21,064
Hasn't that thing caused
enough trouble already?

535
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,098
Think of it like hazard pay.
