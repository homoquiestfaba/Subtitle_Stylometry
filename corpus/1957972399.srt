0
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,558
Ed?

1
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,626
Are you about done with that?

2
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,995
Sorry, I didn't know
you were back.

3
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:39,167
What in the world made you
get that thing out?

4
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,970
What do you want to do
for dinner tonight?

5
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,472
How about
El mariachi?

6
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,174
Let's think about that
for next Sunday.

7
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:51,179
Give your dad fair warning.
It's food, not a tornado.

8
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,716
Shit!

9
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,686
Did you call Tammy back yet?

10
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,654
I'm sure she'd love to go.

11
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,457
How do you even know
that she called?

12
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,596
Ed?

13
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,130
Ed!

14
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,399
Fine.

15
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,501
I'll just be the only woman

16
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:17,671
trying to make your life
a little brighter!

17
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,182
Buenas noches.
That was great.

18
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:46,118
I kind of heard something
about a wandering horseman

19
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,322
and a broken heart. I wish
my Spanish was a little better.

20
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:53,693
A horseman wanders along a
far-away mountain with a wounded heart,

21
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,464
a broken soul,
looking for death.

22
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,666
He prays to god to take his life

23
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:03,336
so he may be reunited
with his lost love.

24
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:08,442
Without what he loves more
than life itself, life isn't worth living.

25
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,245
Written by Mexico's best,
Jose Alfredo jimenez.

26
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,981
Died very young, 47.

27
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,149
You can shut him up
any time, hmm?

28
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,518
Your Margarita is melting.

29
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,588
No, it's fine.

30
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,089
That's a beautiful guitar.

31
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,391
You play?

32
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:25,825
I used to.

33
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,594
Bring your guitar by sometime.

34
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:28,895
Um, I don't want to torture you.

35
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,363
I haven't touched it in years.

36
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,498
Don't worry.

37
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,402
I'll teach you Jose's song.

38
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,818
It's cold out tonight.

39
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,120
Happens this time of year.

40
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,888
Bet you can't wait for
the spring, right?

41
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,891
No, I can't.
But I will make do.

42
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,695
I got you something
from El mariachi.

43
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,535
Oh, they got corn
at uncle bill's too.

44
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,136
Yes, this is better.

45
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,571
Oh, really?

46
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:15,041
Mexicans invent corn?

47
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,478
Actually yeah, they did.

48
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,614
Mom, just try it, it's good.

49
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,060
It's different.

50
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,462
But good.

51
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,329
Go! Go!

52
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,898
Oh jeez! Oh...

53
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,200
You and dad ever
really talk anymore?

54
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,836
After thirty-five years,
we don't have to.

55
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,638
Well you've know me for
thirty years and we still talk.

56
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,540
You don't hardly know
anything about me.

57
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,975
Of course I do.
I know everything.

58
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,177
And by the way,
you're still twenty-nine.

59
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:54,046
And by the way, I think it's nasty
you clean with old underwear.

60
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,348
A rag is a rag.

61
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,383
Are those mine?
Yep.

62
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,687
Take 'em.

63
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,790
Honey, here's that story.

64
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,093
A suspicious device
was discovered this morning.

65
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,696
The device was just a toy horse.

66
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:12,465
And the bomb squad blew it up
just a short time ago.

67
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,833
Dumbasses.

68
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,737
Honey, are you keeping up
on your meds?

69
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,438
Mom.

70
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,840
Is the anxiety still bad?

71
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,742
I really, really don't want
to talk about this.

72
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,311
Fine.
Talk to Dr. Roth.

73
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,781
He's good for more
than just a refill.

74
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,882
He's a pediatrician.

75
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,751
Well, he put you on them.

76
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,886
I told him I was tired
and unmotivated,

77
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,989
and he put me on a pill more
addictive then cocaine. I mean...

78
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,060
Well, he was just
trying to help.

79
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:33,379
Ed?

80
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,949
Go go postal, to where can
I help your post go go?

81
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,353
Ten to four on weekdays.
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

82
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,556
Come on, sugar.

83
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,957
Go see mom.

84
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,661
See you over there
in a half hour. Okay.

85
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,431
Would you like one?

86
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,233
Hi, there.

87
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,335
You got enough to see
us through?

88
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,070
We only have fifteen minutes.

89
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,206
Oh, poo.

90
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,543
We do, don't we?
I almost forgot.

91
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,980
Ed...

92
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,817
You remember what I said
about the end of the summer?

93
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,385
Yeah, you said I'd be able
to take a vacation.

94
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,623
Well, that vacation may be
longer than you planned.

95
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:20,260
I just don't think I have
enough work to keep you going.

96
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,032
Oh, ed.

97
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,801
Lo siento.

98
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,672
I hate the fall.

99
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,524
Looks like I lost the bet.

100
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,827
He hasn't stopped talking
about you coming over to play.

101
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,062
I mean, he can't get
my daughters to listen

102
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,599
to mariachi music, let alone
go anywhere near a guitar.

103
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,201
Well, that's their loss.

104
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:39,038
Yeah, well maybe you can
inspire them to pick up the torch.

105
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,374
Come on, we're all outside.

106
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,813
So, these are my cousins,
and my aunts, my uncles...

107
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,048
Morales, Lucinda, may,

108
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,184
and there's Nancy and Jesus.

109
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,687
So eat and papito
will be up any minute.

110
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,890
He's just raising the flag over
his little palacio municipal.

111
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,558
All right?
Okay.

112
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,194
Okay.

113
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,943
I don't want to sound like an
idiot, but what's the holiday?

114
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,911
Mexican independence.

115
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,813
Have you guys been to Mexico?

116
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,449
Well, Carmen's been to Tijuana.

117
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,917
No, I haven't.

118
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,454
She says it's nasty.

119
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:29,588
Ed!

120
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,689
Hey.

121
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,091
I hope you came prepared.

122
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,726
Well, I promised you, didn't I?

123
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,594
Even if it was
Tequila talking. Good!

124
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:39,432
You crash my party, you
better be ready to entertain.

125
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,602
C.

126
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:44,636
G7.

127
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,637
You know that?
Uh-huh.

128
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,107
F.

129
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,609
G.

130
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,611
Haven't touched it
in years? My foot.

131
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,680
It was great!

132
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,116
Viva Mexico!

133
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,218
Viva Mexico!

134
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,721
Viva Mexico!

135
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,098
Watch your head.

136
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,635
Welcome to Guadalajara!

137
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,606
Wow.

138
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,946
This is it.

139
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,813
Plaza de los mariachis.

140
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,049
Is that where they play?

141
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,717
Not for free,
unless they are auditioning.

142
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,389
It's where they hang out
to wait for customers.

143
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,104
This is us in the Plaza,
young and optimistic.

144
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,806
Is that you in the middle?
Yes.

145
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,009
Take it.

146
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,612
Let our confidence inspire you.

147
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,948
Again, again.

148
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,551
Let your shoulders go.

149
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,019
Were you guys famous?

150
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,650
No, not at all.

151
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,360
Mariachi, at least then,

152
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,162
wasn't a way to be famous.

153
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,630
Wasn't even a goal.

154
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,666
We were happy just playing
to feed our families.

155
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,235
Sounds perfect.

156
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,975
It gave me a sense of duty,
to bring music to people

157
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,145
at all the important moments
in their lives.

158
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:50,570
He has blond hair.

159
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,091
No, no, no.

160
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,960
Up here.

161
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,130
Play with confidence!
Confidence!

162
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,635
Mariachi brings all kinds
of people together.

163
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:14,041
Poor, rich, young, old...
Even you and me.

164
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,169
Yes! Yes!

165
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,300
Great!

166
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,985
This is... Different.

167
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,421
Enchiladas con mole...

168
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,757
It's papito's
absolute favorite, eh?

169
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,393
It's definitely no burrito.
No, it's good.

170
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,563
Mariachi is the soundtrack
of life in Mexico.

171
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:41,667
It gives a voice to our
suffering and to our joy.

172
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:46,073
To our pain and yes,
to our pleasure.

173
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,476
To us, Eduardo.

174
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:52,644
To the soundtrack of life.

175
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,348
Promise to keep
that sense of duty.

176
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,285
I promise.

177
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,864
Do you ever think
about going back?

178
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,301
This is my Mexico now.

179
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,671
I always thought I'd run away.

180
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,542
After I finished high school,
that was my plan.

181
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,444
You know, for the fall.

182
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,679
To play music?

183
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,315
Or something else unrealistic.

184
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,717
Why don't you go
down to Guadalajara,

185
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,919
see the mariachis for yourself.

186
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,121
Yeah, right.

187
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:12,224
I was unhappy at your age, too.

188
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,760
I followed a dream here,

189
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:19,366
so I'd never look back and
wish I'd done things differently.

190
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,435
Took more guts than
I have. Nonsense.

191
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,371
There's no sin in failing.

192
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:28,608
The sin is never trying
in the first place.

193
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,481
You off work today?

194
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,882
Mom didn't tell you?

195
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,750
Tell me what?

196
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,018
Never mind.

197
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,254
See ya.

198
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,158
It's nice to see you with
that guitar again, ed.

199
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,197
I'll take these.

200
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,679
Alberto?

201
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,617
Hey.
Where is everybody?

202
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,853
Grandpa's in the hospital.

203
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,691
All we know is it's a stroke.

204
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,771
Rosario:
Oh, well look who's here.

205
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:37,377
He's finally awake
and very happy to see you two.

206
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,448
Hola, Alberto.

207
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,116
We brought grandpa's guitar.

208
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,452
You wanna play something?

209
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:49,289
No, I haven't even learned
a full song, so...

210
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,427
Anything.

211
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,777
I can't.

212
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,880
I'm sorry.

213
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:15,941
♪ Thou fire so masterful
and bright ♪

214
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:22,449
♪ That givest man both
warmth and light ♪

215
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:32,290
Tammy, that song you sang
this morning was very nice.

216
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,760
Wasn't it, ed?

217
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,562
Your dad told me you
play guitar.

218
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,263
Maybe we could put
together a song.

219
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,731
You don't play guitar.

220
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,402
Once upon a time, Ed was
gonna run away with a band.

221
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:48,139
Tammy, tell about that miracle
with your sister last month.

222
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,510
You know that school bus
that rolled over in utica

223
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:52,944
on its way to a field trip?

224
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,046
My sister was going
the opposite direction

225
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,416
and it was her SUV that
went over with it.

226
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,352
She was in terrible shape...

227
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:03,121
Unconscious,
on all the machines.

228
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,090
But we prayed so hard.

229
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,593
Anne came down,
didn't you? I did.

230
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,561
I thank the lord
about every minute

231
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,329
for letting her stay with us.

232
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,200
He must've known she had more
to offer this world.

233
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,736
Didn't a little girl
get crushed under that bus?

234
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,170
Ed.

235
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,773
Her family must not have
prayed hard enough.

236
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,341
Or maybe you should've
prayed harder

237
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,077
since it was your sister's
SUV that smashed her.

238
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,713
Take a deep breath.

239
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,147
Look I'm sorry if
I'm being naive here.

240
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,549
Enough, Edward!

241
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,050
I guess I just don't
get how it works.

242
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,586
I mean... what she's saying
is that this little girl

243
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,555
has nothing left
to offer this world, right?

244
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,791
Shut the hell up, freak!

245
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,998
I'm sorry.

246
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,018
Wasn't that bad, was it?

247
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:57,088
It's a start.

248
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:40,618
Oh, no, thanks.

249
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,988
No, gracias.

250
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,481
Hola.

251
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,740
Good afternoon.

252
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,750
How much?

253
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,888
Diez pesos.

254
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:18,791
That ok?
Bueno?

255
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,280
No, I don't have change.

256
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,695
No, no, no.
Diez pesos.

257
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,265
It's ok?
It's enough?

258
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,071
Hola.
Hola.

259
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:09,099
Um, what happened to the arch?

260
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,470
White arch?

261
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,840
They took it down for this.

262
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,215
It's not here?
No.

263
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:19,919
Okay, gracias.
De nada.

264
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:20,445
Hey.
Hey.

265
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,880
Americano?
Si.

266
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Got some change to spare?

267
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,886
Lo siento. Need
to get some food.

268
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,588
No, sorry.
No.

269
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,649
Hey, hey.

270
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,959
- Anything?
- No, I'm sorry.

271
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,028
Okay.
Sorry.

272
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,363
Hey.

273
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:39,659
Hey!

274
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,148
Go sit over there. Don't move!

275
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,260
Is this man bothering you?

276
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:48,473
Uh, lo siento, no habla español.

277
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,908
Is that man bothering you?

278
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,777
No, it's fine.
It's okay.

279
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,084
You have ID?
ID? Yeah, okay.

280
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:02,121
What's that?

281
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,092
Drugs?

282
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,294
No, it's definitely not drugs.

283
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,129
No, it's not...
Hey, hey, hey!

284
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,263
It's not mine.

285
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,499
You can search
the rest of my stuff.

286
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,912
We could release you...

287
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:16,467
You have to pay the fine now.

288
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,570
How much?

289
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:22,940
Two hundred dollars.
American.

290
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,842
No, I don't have that much.

291
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:29,510
What's going on?

292
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,586
Go back inside
and mind your own business.

293
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,010
Release him!

294
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,510
Or do you want me
to get Chief Arango?

295
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,080
Should I call him?

296
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,580
Or are you going to release him?

297
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:51,503
Fuck you, gringo!

298
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,630
You assholes
give Mexicans a bad name.

299
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,208
Si.
Ah, si, si, si.

300
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,454
Hello, Edward.
Hola.

301
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:11,556
Welcome.

302
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:12,857
Thank you.

303
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,626
Are you allright?

304
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,996
Yeah.

305
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,637
You look like you need this.

306
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,240
Thank you.

307
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,842
For everything.
De nada.

308
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,412
So you're from Kansas?
Yeah.

309
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,847
You looking for your
way back home? Huh?

310
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,151
From oz?

311
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,454
I'm Lilia.

312
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,564
That was fast.

313
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,766
It's better if you just sip it.

314
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,635
Sorry.

315
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,437
Mole poblano.

316
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:00,771
All right.

317
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,708
Uh, actually I need
to practice my Spanish.

318
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,211
Okay?
Yeah.

319
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:09,115
Lilia:

320
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,221
Thank you.

321
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,626
You seem adventurous.

322
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,796
Sure.

323
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,068
Thank you.

324
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,170
Enjoy.

325
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:42,848
Gracias.

326
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:00,231
How much do I owe?

327
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:02,601
La cuenta?

328
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:07,839
Okay.

329
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:15,214
Gracias.
De nada.

330
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:32,164
Do you know where you're
sleeping tonight? Of course.

331
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:46,043
There are rooms
for rent next door.

332
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,147
NO VACANCY

333
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,949
Okay.
Lo siento.

334
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,719
Thanks.

335
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,880
1500 pesos a week.

336
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:01,192
Oh, good!
Wow, that's cheap.

337
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,361
Uno week.

338
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,440
Happy Birthday, my love!

339
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,809
Do another!

340
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,612
&quot;mexico lindo y querido.&quot;

341
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,313
&quot;mexico lindo
y querido.&quot;

342
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,115
no, I don't know
how to play that.

343
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:20,940
Everyone knows it.

344
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,219
Lo siento.

345
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:48,746
You hungry for comida?

346
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,848
I hope you slept through
that mariachi nightmare.

347
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:54,052
It's usually quieter
around here.

348
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:59,890
Hello?

349
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:03,729
Well, if you need anything
I'll be downstairs.

350
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:09,667
Oh... and you have plans
for Tuesday night.

351
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,803
You get off the tren ligero
at mezquitan.

352
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,205
You come up the steps.

353
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,242
I'll be waiting.

354
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,154
Hello?

355
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,455
Hey, is dad watching the game?

356
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,190
Where the hell are you?

357
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,925
Ron! Didn't you get my note?

358
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:37,628
I got the damn note.
Where are you?

359
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:39,530
I'm in Mexico.
Mexico!

360
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:42,767
Oh, my god.
Ron, pick up!

361
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,501
You need to come home right now.

362
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,537
No, I don't mom.
I'm fine.

363
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,873
Ed...
Hey, dad.

364
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:50,908
Your mom and me talked it over
and we decided

365
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,977
we'd pay the rent for
an apartment for six months

366
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,512
to get you back on your feet.

367
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,682
Thanks dad, but no.
I need a break.

368
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:01,018
You can't just call
and tell us you're in Mexico.

369
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,920
Well, I just did, mom.
I'm an adult.

370
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:05,990
You barely even go to
the grocery by yourself.

371
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:07,391
Exactly.

372
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:09,293
There was a story on
the news just last night

373
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:10,861
about beheadings down there.

374
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,782
I just wanted to call
to tell you I'm safe, okay?

375
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:54,271
Mom, I'm not going to stay here
all night, right?

376
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,620
Speak Spanish.

377
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,300
I'm opening the restaurant
in the morning.

378
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,260
You'll stay until 1:00.

379
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,800
Where are you going?

380
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,582
For Edward.

381
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,017
Lilia!

382
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,386
I'll be right back.
Geez.

383
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:10,388
Ay, dios.

384
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:14,750
Let her be.
You were young once.

385
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,550
And I sat here all night
if I wanted to or not.

386
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:34,880
Trick or treat?

387
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:38,048
Thanks!
De nada.

388
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:42,586
But we don't really do
trick-or-treat here. Oh.

389
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:45,122
Sorry, uhh...

390
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,657
Do you want to keep them anyway?

391
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:49,661
Yeah,
of course. Okay, okay.

392
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:56,367
So, no trick-or-treating?
That's kind of a shame.

393
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,745
Wow.

394
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:10,047
All this for the dead?

395
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:13,018
Mostly for the living.
Ha.

396
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,832
Mama, cihtli.

397
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,660
This is Edward.

398
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,820
Welcome.

399
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,172
You can sit here.

400
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,230
Eat something, child.

401
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:46,817
Cihtli is saying you should
eat something.

402
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,954
Gracias.

403
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,310
Is it good?

404
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:11,740
I'm sorry.

405
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:15,346
Gracias.

406
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,923
So, when are you
going to sing me a song?

407
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:27,992
Huh?
Yeah.

408
00:45:27,993 --> 00:45:32,529
It could be &quot;Cielito lindo&quot;
Or &quot;De colores.&quot;

409
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,698
sorry, am I way too loud?

410
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:37,134
I knew it!
Yes!

411
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:41,705
Okay. Are you trying to
be a mariachi or something?

412
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:46,243
You think that's crazy?
Ahh...

413
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,978
I think you're in
the right place.

414
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:53,785
Yeah, there's nothing else here
but rice and beans and mariachis.

415
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:57,654
So, people won't laugh at me?

416
00:45:57,655 --> 00:45:59,790
I didn't say that.

417
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:03,794
No, but you have to believe it,

418
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:07,464
otherwise no one else will.

419
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:11,135
I think some people
might make fun of a gringo

420
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:17,008
wanting to be Mexican.
But, I say screw 'em.

421
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:20,377
Really?
Yeah, screw 'em!

422
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,913
Okay, 'cause I've been
trying to figure this all out.

423
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:24,614
Without much luck.

424
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,485
How many songs do you
know? Just a few so far.

425
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,720
You know there's, like,
three thousand.

426
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,991
And you need to know
them as requested.

427
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,561
I kinda figured
that one out, yeah.

428
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:43,934
I'll take care of everything.

429
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:47,138
What do you mean?
I know people.

430
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,075
No, no.
I know you're busy.

431
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:53,477
Ahh, shh.
Really, I'm in charge.

432
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,479
I'm in charge, yes.

433
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,215
Really?
Mm-hmm.

434
00:46:58,216 --> 00:46:59,749
Thank you.

435
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,151
You're welcome.

436
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:04,589
Thank you. It's
like this, like this.

437
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:14,899
So, what are you going
to do for me in return?

438
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,935
Anything.
Just name it.

439
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,943
Marry me.
So I can go to the U.S.

440
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:29,414
Really?

441
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:38,256
Oh, that's funny.

442
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:05,550
Okay, gracias.

443
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:12,657
Try me out.

444
00:48:12,658 --> 00:48:13,950
I know your favorites.

445
00:48:13,951 --> 00:48:15,393
No.

446
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,739
Lilia?

447
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,642
Oh, those go over there.

448
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:38,648
No, it's ok, I got it.

449
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,685
Hey, are you sure your mom's
okay with me working here?

450
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:44,655
Are you sure you can work
for Mexican pay?

451
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,493
Will you teach me?

452
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:25,755
I can see it now...
The backstreet mariachi boys.

453
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,023
No way, no.

454
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:31,428
The girls will be screaming
their heads off for you!

455
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:33,763
No, I want to be a simple
mariachi of the people.

456
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:40,204
I don't think I've ever
met anyone so sincere.

457
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:43,441
It might seem silly, but I don't
want to be rich and famous.

458
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,044
Okay.

459
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:49,180
Oye, mijo, no, no, no.

460
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:50,230
They're not pancakes.

461
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,500
They're tortillas.
Not like that. Like this.

462
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,220
Okay, okay.

463
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:57,987
Ever been in California?

464
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,489
Uh, no.

465
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,726
It's perfect there,
and there's tons of mariachis.

466
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:07,030
You've been?
Mm-hmm. For university.

467
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:10,234
I studied ocean science
in Santa Cruz.

468
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:11,302
No, no, no.

469
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:13,520
You're burning them. Flip them.

470
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:17,774
Okay.
Si.

471
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:18,857
Wait?

472
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:21,270
- She lived in the USA?
- Yes.

473
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:23,413
Yeah, until mamacita
dragged me home.

474
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,516
Kicking and screaming.

475
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,852
I lived there with
my brother and his wife.

476
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:31,588
So why kicking and screaming?

477
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,323
I love someone in California.

478
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:36,760
Well, loved. You
know. Past tense.

479
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:42,232
And the pacific ocean, the
reason I went there in the first place.

480
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:46,370
But mariachis there are so cute!

481
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:49,373
Mexican girls drool over them.

482
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:51,309
Like drool over them.

483
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:56,146
I just wanna hear more
about Mr. California.

484
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,516
I'm sure you will.

485
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,292
Gracias.

486
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:17,401
It must've been
hard to leave, no?

487
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:19,136
Would've been harder to stay.

488
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,606
Don't you miss home?

489
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,542
Your parents must
be crazy you're gone.

490
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,711
I don't know.

491
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:29,746
Come on.

492
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,316
Yes, you do.

493
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,486
I miss the smell of November.

494
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,890
And my dad's chili.

495
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:44,961
And the mothball smell of the Afghan
my mom made me when I was a kid.

496
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:46,731
Sounds nice.

497
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:51,968
I have to go back to Santa Cruz.

498
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,703
It's perfect there.

499
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:56,072
I think you're missing
Mr. California.

500
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:57,474
No.

501
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,076
It's the ocean.

502
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:01,711
The ocean is my dream.

503
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,547
Isn't that same ocean that's
a couple hours west of here.

504
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:06,617
It's not the 'same' same.
No.

505
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,890
This is for you.

506
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:19,863
It's a love bird.

507
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,700
Is it?
Yep.

508
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,905
I guess it needs a mate then.

509
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,230
Two tequilas with sangrita.

510
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,352
So, what does she look like?

511
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,621
Dark long hair.

512
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:48,326
Gorgeous. Well, that's
every woman in here.

513
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,780
Is Sophia here yet?

514
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,468
There she is.

515
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:01,070
Pray that she says yes.
Pray.

516
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,006
Okay, okay.

517
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,342
Una mas.

518
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:08,512
Hola.
Hola.

519
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:10,970
It's been too long!

520
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,280
OK, look.

521
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,370
That must be your friend.

522
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,850
Yes. He's nervous.
Will you meet him?

523
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:21,892
Si!

524
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:31,736
She said she'll meet you.

525
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,438
Is that her mariachi band?

526
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:37,907
Oh, no, they wouldn't
be caught dead here.

527
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,057
Do you mind?

528
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,561
No... it's cool.

529
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,640
You look lonely.
Wanna dance?

530
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:31,155
Lo siento...
I'm not...

531
00:56:31,156 --> 00:56:32,980
Come on!

532
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:34,257
No, I'm not...

533
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,926
Si, vamos.

534
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,991
I'm not starting
completely from scratch.

535
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:44,127
I play guitar
and I sing a little bit.

536
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:47,396
Most of this music
needs to be learned by ear.

537
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,532
I'll do whatever it takes.

538
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:50,299
I just really want to learn.

539
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,268
We know he's not picky.

540
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:53,570
He'll do anything.

541
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:56,372
Hey, hold on.

542
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:57,907
I had no idea what
that guy was saying.

543
00:57:57,908 --> 00:57:59,242
What was I supposed to do?

544
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:01,144
'No' means
the same in Spanish. No.

545
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,547
No.
No.

546
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:05,982
I'm cool with it, it's fine.

547
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,719
I'm very comfortable
with my sexuality.

548
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:12,923
So, are you two together?

549
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,327
Oh, god no!

550
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,196
Might have worked out better.

551
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:22,465
Sophia's like my big sister.

552
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:26,269
She was engaged to my brother
before he went to the states.

553
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,437
Met a gringa lady.

554
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,173
No offense.
No, no.

555
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,200
Left me for dead.

556
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,282
Sorry about that.

557
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:41,251
I'm okay.

558
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:46,522
If you're committed
to this, I'm in.

559
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,191
Really?

560
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:52,562
Thank you so much.
Honestly, thank you.

561
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:54,063
What?
What is that?

562
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:55,665
Thank you, thank you so much.

563
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,433
No, you have to be more excited!

564
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:59,736
I am excited.
I'm excited.

565
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:00,937
Really excited!
Really.

566
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:02,338
What?
Scream it!

567
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,640
Scream what?

568
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:05,208
Scream, &quot;I'm gonna do it!&quot;

569
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:08,278
I'm gonna
do it! I'm gonna do it!

570
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,187
Have you ever been in love
with a man?

571
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:19,723
No.

572
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:22,491
Well, I don't know.

573
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,062
Why?
Does it matter?

574
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,965
So, are you bi or what?

575
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,434
Why does everyone
want to know that?

576
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:34,103
I fell in love with
a woman. So what.

577
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:35,872
I mean, it doesn't matter to me.

578
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:37,741
But I think people just want
to know if you're available.

579
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:40,376
Shut up and sing me a song.

580
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:45,215
Come on, please.
Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay.

581
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:53,257
I just started practicing
this one... play.

582
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,225
Okay.

583
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:47,643
Bravo!

584
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,146
Thank you.

585
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,308
Hey.

586
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:23,981
What are you doing in my bed?

587
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:27,940
Are the flowers ready, Grandma?

588
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:30,770
Yes, and they are beautiful today.

589
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:35,010
Lilia, I need to speak to you.

590
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,006
I don't care if he already
bought you the place -

591
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:45,760
or the whole fucking city!

592
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,730
I can't handle two restaurants.

593
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:50,300
Don't force me to sell this one.

594
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,900
I only came back to help
when Father died. Only for that.

595
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:59,870
Your brother works very hard.
He's doing this for us.

596
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,926
So, it's OK for your son
to abandon you for the USA-

597
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,180
and a gringa bitch!

598
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,653
Lilia!

599
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:07,523
What if I want to go back
and work really hard? Huh?

600
01:02:08,706 --> 01:02:10,860
This is what your father
dreamed of his whole life.

601
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,120
Exactly - Father dreamed of it.
Not me!

602
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:19,320
He dreamed it for you.
For me, for all of us.

603
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:20,990
What about my dream?

604
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,830
This location would be yours.

605
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,908
To run, to manage yourself
once we have the new one.

606
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,211
Don't think I'm going
to spend my whole life

607
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:31,448
sweating in this stupid
kitchen. I'm not going to.

608
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,780
Sorry I'm late, Señora.
It won't happen again. I promise.

609
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,298
Sorry. I'll catch up.
You're late!

610
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,001
I just got a call.

611
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,737
A mariachi wants to meet me,
mariachi alas?

612
01:02:54,738 --> 01:02:56,340
They sound interested.

613
01:02:57,808 --> 01:02:59,343
Alas?
Yeah.

614
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:04,180
You know, they're not simple
musicians of the people.

615
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:06,983
They're big, like famous.

616
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:08,919
I already told them
I'd meet them.

617
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,489
Do whatever you want.

618
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,190
Hi.

619
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,760
You the guy
I'm supposed to meet?

620
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,108
Jorge?
Hey.

621
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:34,030
I'm sorry.

622
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,579
Edward.

623
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,800
Nice to meet you.

624
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:40,850
¿Tu American?

625
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:43,153
Si, yeah, but I live here now.

626
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:46,110
I'm leaving
right before the festival.

627
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,550
We're looking for someone great.

628
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,850
Can you come play for us?

629
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:56,699
Audition?

630
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,602
Audition? Yes, of course. Si.

631
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,190
A week from Friday.

632
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,139
Uh, next Friday?
Si, no problema.

633
01:04:03,107 --> 01:04:05,575
Perfecto.
Gracias.

634
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:09,278
Edward...

635
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,100
You play vihuela, right?

636
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:16,520
Of course.

637
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,320
Father didn't pay
for university so...

638
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:29,890
I could make tortillas
the rest of my life.

639
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,330
So what are you going to do?

640
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,971
Run off with that American?

641
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:42,040
You wish.

642
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:44,847
So, I finally
got an audition.

643
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:46,182
Audition?
For what?

644
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:47,984
I actually got one.
For a mariachi band.

645
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:49,118
Like, a real one.

646
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,586
It's almost Christmas, ed.

647
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:52,521
We haven't heard
from you in weeks.

648
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,590
Don't you think it's about
time you came home?

649
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,025
You ever check your email?

650
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:58,194
Hey son.
You need any cash?

651
01:04:58,195 --> 01:05:00,196
No, I'm fine.
Everything's great.

652
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:02,198
What are you doing for
insurance and such?

653
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,799
Anne...
You better still be

654
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,101
on your pills.

655
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:06,235
I'm fine.
I'm careful.

656
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:07,803
Careful don't cut it.

657
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:10,039
You can't mess around
with this stuff, ed.

658
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,208
Okay, I'm sorry I bothered you.

659
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,940
Just wanted to tell you
the good news.

660
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,880
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

661
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:24,687
All right,

662
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:26,089
screw the restaurant.

663
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:29,492
We have one week to turn you
into an expert mariachi.

664
01:05:29,493 --> 01:05:33,929
So, let's do it.
Good morning!

665
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:54,583
I love this one.
What's the price?

666
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:56,819
I think he said 8500.

667
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,422
Let me go ask.

668
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,228
8500 is a little steep.

669
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,050
It's handmade.

670
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,600
If you want to be a true mariachi,
you need a "Morales."

671
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,072
This is all I have in writing.

672
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:20,109
These are required.

673
01:06:28,133 --> 01:06:33,020
Sweetie, this was
your parents' dream.

674
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,550
They need you.

675
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:37,560
No.
Again, from here.

676
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,320
With feeling.

677
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:52,142
Damn it, teach me again.

678
01:07:03,985 --> 01:07:06,580
You're young.
You have time.

679
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:38,188
You remember how to grind those?

680
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:41,491
I do.

681
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:48,832
No.
Like this.

682
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,536
It's finer this way.

683
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:57,640
This is the part cihtli
made my brother and me do.

684
01:07:57,641 --> 01:08:00,976
We'd grind until
our hands were numb.

685
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:03,246
It was her wedding day meal.

686
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:08,050
Her mother made it as a symbol
for her union with a Spanish man.

687
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,886
She isn't Spanish?
Nuh-uh.

688
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:13,356
Nahua.
Indian.

689
01:08:13,357 --> 01:08:15,558
Mother is El mole.

690
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:18,527
She was supposed
to make it for my wedding.

691
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:21,197
Sounds nice.

692
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:24,134
Please.
As if that's possible.

693
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,239
So your mother's never met
any of your girlfriends?

694
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,408
That's funny.

695
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,440
You never told them?

696
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,430
What's to tell?

697
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,400
The truth.

698
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,284
¿La verdad?

699
01:08:41,285 --> 01:08:44,187
La verdad.

700
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:46,323
And what is that?

701
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:55,232
I told her I'd do
the restaurant.

702
01:08:57,234 --> 01:08:58,434
I made my choice.

703
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,403
I'm going to be
a good daughter now.

704
01:09:00,404 --> 01:09:03,272
So, you're going to have
to find a new chaperone.

705
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:06,108
Hey.
What?

706
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:08,211
Have you thought this through?

707
01:09:08,212 --> 01:09:10,780
What about the ocean?
Stop the therapy.

708
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,651
I made my decision.

709
01:09:19,923 --> 01:09:21,758
Sorry.

710
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:03,826
Edward.
Hola.

711
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:05,420
- How are you?
- Good. You?

712
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,750
Come, let me introduce you.

713
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,620
This is Edward.
The guy I told you about.

714
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:16,939
Hola.
Hola.

715
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:19,408
Tequila con limon.

716
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:22,545
Tequila con limon.

717
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:26,979
Starts with c, then goes to c7.

718
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,540
I got this one. Thanks.

719
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have fresh meat for you tonight!

720
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:33,956
That's me.

721
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,703
Hay! Uno, dos...

722
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,470
What'd I tell you?

723
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,210
Blond hair and blue eyes!

724
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:46,540
Yes, it's good.

725
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,910
Welcome.

726
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:56,358
Gracias!

727
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:57,794
Gracias!

728
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,693
Lilia, hey.
Why?

729
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:31,694
Stop.
Why?

730
01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:33,630
Stop. Stop!

731
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,865
Let's go. I need air.

732
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,568
What's wrong with you?

733
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:43,907
Gracias, señora.

734
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,170
Look, I bought you a rose.

735
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,840
Hey, baby.
You putting on a show?

736
01:15:58,980 --> 01:15:59,980
What do you want?

737
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:02,750
You want to stay and see?

738
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,690
You like to watch, do you?

739
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:10,760
Nice tits. Too bad
they're wasted on a dyke.

740
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:16,600
No, there's some here for you, too.
You want them?

741
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:18,000
How delicious!

742
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,860
I'll make you feel things

743
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:22,570
no bitch ever could.

744
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,749
Go away!

745
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,283
Hey!
What the hell is going on?

746
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:29,284
It's under control.

747
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:31,612
Listen. Have some dignity.

748
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,640
Get your hands off her.

749
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:36,424
No.
You go away. Go away.

750
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,026
If you're not going
to give me what I want.

751
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:39,594
Just go away.
Lilia, come on.

752
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,630
No, no, no.
Come on.

753
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,820
Who are you?
A fucking queer?

754
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:44,959
No, asshole.

755
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,020
I'm a gentleman.

756
01:16:46,021 --> 01:16:48,604
Real man.

757
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:48,600
No wonder the bitch
wants to be with a real man.

758
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,577
Fuck you!

759
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,070
Go fuck your mother!

760
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:58,170
Get out of here!

761
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,040
I'm gonna kick
your fucking face in!

762
01:17:00,183 --> 01:17:01,309
Come on!

763
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:03,680
Kill the macho attitude.
It doesn't suit you.

764
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:07,622
Lilia, come on. I'll
walk you home. No.

765
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,526
Break.

766
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,820
You two need a break.

767
01:17:10,526 --> 01:17:12,161
Yeah.

768
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:36,599
Hold on.

769
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:47,775
Hey.
Hey.

770
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,844
Come on in.

771
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,713
I'm sorry to wake you up.

772
01:20:51,714 --> 01:20:55,750
Your mom called. She said you
should call her back today, it's important.

773
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:57,586
Okay, thanks.

774
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:05,227
Oh, so you got your uniform
and everything?

775
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:07,596
Uh, yeah. Picked it
up yesterday.

776
01:21:08,831 --> 01:21:10,899
So it's good?
It's great.

777
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,367
I mean,
rehearsals are killing me,

778
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:15,737
my fingers are hamburger.
But it's perfect.

779
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:18,006
Edward!
Edward!

780
01:21:18,007 --> 01:21:20,475
You need to take care of those.

781
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:22,545
Those are your tools, you know.

782
01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:30,118
So, we've got the restaurant
to ourselves.

783
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:33,456
I'm sure my mom
is going to come often.

784
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:39,127
You think the band can
come in and play sometime?

785
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:41,230
This isn't what you want.

786
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:44,532
Of course it is.
No, this.

787
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:46,169
All of this.

788
01:21:48,471 --> 01:21:52,274
I don't have a choice.
Of course you do.

789
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:56,312
Just leave, make a change.

790
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:01,017
No, it is.

791
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:00,370
It's not that easy.

792
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:04,352
No, it's not.
Lilia.

793
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:06,021
It's not.
It's not easy.

794
01:22:06,022 --> 01:22:07,155
It is. It is.
No, it's not!

795
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:09,224
I can't leave my mom by herself.

796
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:12,027
Not everyone can be you.

797
01:22:12,028 --> 01:22:13,195
I'm not telling you to be me.

798
01:22:13,196 --> 01:22:15,264
I'm telling you to be you!

799
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:19,335
That didn't work for you.
Did it?

800
01:22:21,037 --> 01:22:23,771
You were on your way
to being you. Remember?

801
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,441
Simple musician.
What happened?

802
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,376
Mariachi alas?

803
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:31,080
Look, I don't know.
I'm along for the ride.

804
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:36,451
Why me? Why me?
Why Mexico?

805
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:37,653
Why mariachi?

806
01:22:47,997 --> 01:22:52,667
Alberto told me a story
about a man.

807
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:55,403
He was unable to have the only
thing in life he truly loved,

808
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,373
he stopped wanting to live.

809
01:22:59,842 --> 01:23:03,179
I've never loved anything
enough to feel that.

810
01:23:06,782 --> 01:23:09,685
I just needed to know
it was possible.

811
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:13,522
Turns out it is.

812
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:21,429
Buy a ticket.

813
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:24,432
Get on a plane
or a bus or a boat.

814
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:25,767
Just go.
It's easy.

815
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:27,302
Maybe for a gringo.

816
01:23:27,303 --> 01:23:28,503
You know what, fine.
Whatever.

817
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:30,805
Just be miserable.
And be bitter.

818
01:23:30,806 --> 01:23:33,476
I mean, why don't you
marry me while you're at it?

819
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:39,747
You're generous...

820
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,717
Beautiful, supportive.

821
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:47,055
So, why don't you?

822
01:23:47,056 --> 01:23:49,192
Will you marry me?

823
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,295
Stop it.

824
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,998
I didn't think so.

825
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:59,302
It's not what you want.

826
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,608
How do you know what I want?

827
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,432
You want to feel
what I just felt.

828
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:35,036
It's peace.

829
01:24:35,037 --> 01:24:37,173
It's joy.
It's love.

830
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:40,576
I promise.

831
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,369
It's what we all want.

832
01:26:11,734 --> 01:26:13,835
Yeah, I've got
the big festival tonight.

833
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:15,237
Well, it's actually right now.
The guys are waiting.

834
01:26:15,238 --> 01:26:17,104
But Lilia said you
wanted to talk.

835
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:18,573
Yes.

836
01:26:18,574 --> 01:26:21,376
A lady named rosario called
asking for you.

837
01:26:21,377 --> 01:26:22,844
You know her?

838
01:26:22,845 --> 01:26:24,646
Yeah, she's from
the restaurant in town.

839
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:26,414
Well, I don't know her,
so I didn't tell her

840
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:28,383
you were in Mexico,
but she told me she really

841
01:26:28,384 --> 01:26:32,620
needed me to let you know
that papito died.

842
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:34,590
Was that your friend?

843
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:37,860
Yeah, he's dead?

844
01:26:39,828 --> 01:26:41,763
Oh, my god.
We wanted to tell you

845
01:26:41,764 --> 01:26:44,065
we're sorry to hear
about your friend.

846
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:46,969
You want us to send flowers
or a plant or something?

847
01:26:52,275 --> 01:26:54,809
I gotta go.

848
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:56,645
I miss you two.

849
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,470
The next group tonight
is from right here in Guadalajara.

850
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:14,750
An extraordinary mariachi.
Let's welcome them to the stage.

851
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:18,020
Ladies and gentlemen -

852
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:21,420
An old band, with a new name.

853
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,780
Mariachi Gringo!

854
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:26,720
What happened to Mariachi Alas?

855
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,460
Come on. Listen to the crowd.

856
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:32,430
Am I actually good enough
for your band?

857
01:28:32,575 --> 01:28:34,376
Or do you just want me
as a joke?

858
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,670
Don't be offended,
it's good for business.

859
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:11,530
For Alberto.

860
01:33:17,793 --> 01:33:19,327
Viva Mexico.

861
01:33:31,506 --> 01:33:34,242
We even brought a
stereo to the home last winter.

862
01:33:36,211 --> 01:33:40,048
We drove those nurses nuts
with that mariachi music.

863
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,687
We never knew if he
could actually hear it.

864
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:47,488
I'm sure he heard it.

865
01:33:47,489 --> 01:33:50,424
So how is it down there?

866
01:33:50,425 --> 01:33:51,425
You like it?

867
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:54,461
Yeah, I really do.

868
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:58,733
You know, I've never been.

869
01:33:58,734 --> 01:34:01,068
To Guadalajara?

870
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:02,905
To Mexico.

871
01:34:04,606 --> 01:34:07,474
Maybe now.

872
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:11,278
So, I've been putting some
red bell pepper in my meatloaf.

873
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:14,048
It's different.
But good.

874
01:34:14,049 --> 01:34:16,885
You like it?
It's good.

875
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:22,124
What do you think, Brendan, you
think Ed should give Brian a call?

876
01:34:23,191 --> 01:34:24,558
Yeah.

877
01:34:24,559 --> 01:34:26,460
He said he could probably
start you out in the office,

878
01:34:26,461 --> 01:34:27,895
work your way up like me.

879
01:34:27,896 --> 01:34:29,063
What a good idea, honey.

880
01:34:29,064 --> 01:34:30,264
I'm so glad you thought of that.

881
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:33,567
Mom.
We talked about this, right?

882
01:34:33,568 --> 01:34:37,204
Okay.

883
01:34:37,205 --> 01:34:39,807
Just tell us why you want to
live in a third world country?

884
01:34:39,808 --> 01:34:41,542
Leave the kid alone.

885
01:34:41,543 --> 01:34:43,510
It's good to have you back
at the dinner table, ed.

886
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,880
Thanks, dad.
Yeah, you two should come visit.

887
01:34:45,881 --> 01:34:47,281
See for yourselves.

888
01:34:47,282 --> 01:34:49,183
Honey, wait.
You didn't try your Pesto.

889
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:50,617
I made it fresh.

890
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:52,553
I do not eat newfangled food.

891
01:34:52,554 --> 01:34:55,156
They've been makin' Pesto
for thousands of years in Italy.

892
01:34:55,157 --> 01:34:56,523
Well,
they haven't been making it

893
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:58,726
for thousands of years
in Kansas now have they?

894
01:34:58,727 --> 01:35:01,395
Brendan: I bet if you deep
fried it he'd eat it.

895
01:35:01,396 --> 01:35:03,265
Oh, Brendan!

896
01:35:26,288 --> 01:35:27,856
Hola.

897
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:34,020
You missed her by a week.

898
01:35:37,099 --> 01:35:38,133
Really?

899
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,990
Lilia returned to Santa Cruz.

900
01:35:44,907 --> 01:35:47,242
Is there anything I can
help you with?

901
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:50,200
We're fine, thank you.

902
01:35:52,714 --> 01:35:54,382
Okay.

903
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:21,530
Good morning!

904
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:25,070
Please come in,
make yourself at home.

905
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,550
Pour them a drink.

906
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,870
I want the best for my ladies.

907
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:37,740
Go call them in.

908
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:40,460
My mother's favorite song is
"Paloma Negra."

909
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:44,550
My wife will love anything,
so play your favorites also.

910
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:48,660
Absolutely. With pleasure.

911
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:53,230
Happy Mother's Day!

912
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:57,470
I invited mariachis.

913
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:58,870
Thank you.

914
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:01,440
Best wishes.

915
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,640
Thank you. Please eat.

916
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:10,580
I have beans, soup, cactus,
and tequila.

917
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:12,020
Thank you for inviting me.

918
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:13,880
