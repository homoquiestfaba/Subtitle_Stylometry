1
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,559
Well...

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,770
if it isn't my good friend,
The Poet.

3
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,065
I can't say I'm surprised
to find you here.

4
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:08,026
Whose grave are
you visiting today?

5
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,278
Who's there?

6
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,364
Weeping at the same
grave over again?

7
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,617
Why didn't you choose
any of the others?

8
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,912
Ligeia, Annabel?

9
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,707
Or perhaps Berenice?

10
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,459
So sure Virginia
was going to be the pick

11
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,671
for today's tortured journey.

12
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,383
There's no denying
your affection for her.

13
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,885
What was that poem of yours?

14
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,972
"It was many and many a year ago

15
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,392
"That a maiden there lived
whom you may know

16
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,895
"And this maiden she lived
with no other thought...

17
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,481
"Than to love and
be loved by me."

18
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,191
What am I doing?

19
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,736
I recite poetry with a statue!

20
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,613
I must be drunk.

21
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>Or mad.</i>

22
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,199
Or both.

23
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,701
I am hallucinating.

24
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:02,039
Should I answer this one
with another of your stanzas?

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,416
"All that we see or seem

26
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,337
"ls but a dream
within a dream..."

27
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,599
Still you have no
clue to who I am.

28
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,101
I am your shadow, your soul.

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,562
The object of your obsession.

30
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,855
Are you mad?

31
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,940
My obsession?

32
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:35,781
Recognize me now, Poe?

33
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,200
Are you feeling lonely?

34
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,869
Longing again for the departed?

35
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,663
Silence!

36
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,040
I came here for solitude.

37
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,583
Not loneliness.

38
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,920
Always obsessed with the dead.

39
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,422
A great subject
for your writings.

40
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,257
It is not obsession

41
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,552
but rather inspiration
which drives my writing.

42
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,763
I wouldn't define it that way.

43
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,516
Remember Roderick Usher?

44
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,812
His compulsive obsession for
his departed sister Madeline

45
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,689
caused such a nervous agitation

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,359
that it lead him
to an early demise.

47
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,404
It was brotherly love, not
obsession.

48
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,240
Obsession, superstition,

49
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,784
unrequited love.

50
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,413
Who do you want to convince?

51
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,013
It was a magical place
that filled my childhood

52
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,392
with visions
to stir the imagination.

53
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,787
And now, during the whole

54
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,789
of a dull, dark,
and soundless day

55
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,416
in the autumn of another year,

56
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,377
I was alone, passing through

57
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,297
a singularly dreary
tract of country;

58
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,175
and at length found myself

59
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:09,810
within reach of the
melancholy House of Usher.

60
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,647
I know not how it was;
but with my first glimpse

61
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,483
of the house after so long,

62
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:20,487
an unexpected sense
of insufferable gloom

63
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,031
pervaded my spirit.

64
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,242
What was it?

65
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,661
What unnerved me so

66
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:32,082
in the contemplation
of the House of Usher?

67
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,960
Its proprietor, Roderick Usher,

68
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,214
had been one of my boon
companions in boyhood;

69
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:46,137
but many years had elapsed
since our last meeting.

70
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,681
His letter, however,

71
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,642
had lately reached me
in a distant part

72
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:55,438
of the country.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,275
I scanned more narrowly

74
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,986
the real aspect of the building.

75
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,238
Its principal feature

76
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,618
seemed to be that
of an excessive antiquity.

77
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,378
The writer spoke of
acute bodily illness,

78
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,630
of a mental disorder
which oppressed him,

79
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,551
and brought an
earnest desire to see me,

80
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,178
as his best,
and indeed his only

81
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,598
personal friend, in an attempt

82
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,683
to alleviate some of his malady;

83
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,768
and I, accordingly,

84
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,936
obeyed forthwith

85
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,773
what I still considered
a very singular

86
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,027
and haunting summons.

87
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:16,186
I gazed upon him with a feeling
half of pity, half of awe.

88
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,646
Frederick!

89
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,606
My dear friend,

90
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,108
I have after all this time

91
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:29,157
been waiting for your arrival!

92
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,035
I at first thought it to be

93
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,663
an overdone cordiality.

94
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,040
It was with difficulty
that I could bring myself

95
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,752
to admit the identity of
the man being before me

96
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:45,882
with the companion
of my early boyhood.

97
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,009
He entered into what
he conceived to be

98
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,429
the nature of his malady.

99
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:59,604
The most insipid food
was alone endurable.

100
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,441
The odors of all flowers
proved oppressive;

101
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:08,780
his eyes were tortured
by even a faint light.

102
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,541
And there were but
peculiar sounds

103
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,877
which inspired him with horror.

104
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,252
I began to question
my worthiness

105
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,254
of being present for my friend,

106
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:14,679
who now existed in a world
of which I held no key.

107
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,223
I shall perish!

108
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,478
I dread the events
of the future!

109
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,230
I feel that the period
will sooner or later arrive

110
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,523
when I must abandon

111
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,110
life and reason together,

112
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,613
in some struggle

113
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:37,035
with the grim phantasm...

114
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,995
...fear.

115
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,581
But what do you fear, Roderick?

116
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,042
I must know what
is it that torments

117
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,002
your every moment.

118
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,212
I admit that

119
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,591
much of the peculiar gloom which
afflicts me could be traced

120
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:57,514
to a severe
and long continued illness.

121
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:05,105
I speak of my tenderly
beloved sister, Madeline.

122
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:10,902
My sole companion
for so many long years,

123
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,694
my last

124
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:16,616
and only relative on earth.

125
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,536
Roderick spoke with
such bitterness,

126
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,996
which made me shudder.

127
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,165
And yet, I could tell

128
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:29,462
of his complete devotion
towards his sister.

129
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,381
Madeline...

130
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,591
Her decease

131
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,303
will leave me as the last

132
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:44,185
of the ancient
race of the Ushers.

133
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,437
His voice trembled

134
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,649
as he recounted how even in
her youth, Madeline would fear

135
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,360
the outside world.

136
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,322
Roderick loved his sister
for her purity,

137
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,994
but the foreboding doom
was forever present.

138
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:10,670
The Usher's life of loneliness
will mean there will be no heir.

139
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,840
But on the closing in
of the evening of my arrival

140
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,925
at the house,

141
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:19,345
she succumbed
to the prostrating power

142
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,223
of the destroyer.

143
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,654
She is dead!

144
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:41,576
Madeline has died!

145
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:45,330
She has left me!

146
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,395
At the request of
Roderick Usher,

147
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,231
I personally aided him

148
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:16,027
in the arrangements
for the temporary entombment.

149
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,812
And now,

150
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:56,317
some days of bitter grief
having elapsed,

151
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,860
an observable change

152
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:04,367
came over the features of the
mental disorder of my friend.

153
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,300
At times, again, I was
obliged to resolve all

154
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:26,306
into the mere inexplicable
vagaries of madness.

155
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,033
For I beheld him
gazing upon vacancy

156
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,784
for long hours,

157
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,537
in an attitude
of the profoundest attention,

158
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:55,376
as if listening to some
imaginary sound.

159
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,010
It was no wonder

160
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,305
that his terrifying condition
was creeping upon me,

161
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,308
the wild influence
of his fantastic

162
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,936
yet impressive superstitions.

163
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,412
And you have not seen it?

164
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,458
Then you shall!

165
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,794
You must!

166
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,297
You must behold this!

167
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:55,311
I hear it, and have heard it.

168
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,064
We have put her

169
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,316
living

170
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:07,615
in the tomb!

171
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,243
I now tell you

172
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,661
that I heard

173
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,456
her first feeble movements

174
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,084
in the hollow coffin.

175
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,837
I heard them many,
many days ago.

176
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,463
Yet I dared not,

177
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,884
I dared not speak!

178
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,595
The rending of her coffin,

179
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:34,058
and the grating of the
iron hinges of her prison,

180
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,644
and her struggles

181
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,062
within the coppered

182
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:42,275
archway of the vault!

183
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,491
Be calm.

184
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,494
It is the storm
that draws breath,

185
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:58,332
playing tricks on us both!

186
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:03,379
Is she not hurrying
to upbraid me for my haste?

187
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:08,009
Have I not heard
her footsteps on the stairs?

188
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,136
Do I not distinguish that heavy

189
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,679
and horrible

190
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,681
beating

191
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:19,479
of her heart?

192
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,481
Madman!

193
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,525
MADMAN!

194
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:40,666
I tell you that she now
stands without the door!

195
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,808
The vision before
me will stay burnt

196
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,728
into my very soul and haunt me

197
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,023
to the end of my days.

198
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,116
Where I gazed,

199
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,827
the House once stood.

200
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,079
I saw the mighty walls rushing

201
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:04,625
as under there was a long
tumultuous shouting sound,

202
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,878
like the voice of
a thousand waters

203
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,592
and the deep and
dank tarn at my feet

204
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:17,305
closed sullenly and silently

205
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:23,352
over the fragments
of the House of Usher.

206
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,820
Bravo!

207
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,032
In your own words he became
a victim of the very terrors

208
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,325
he had anticipated.

209
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,203
Much like you.

210
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,331
Don't you wish you were dead?

211
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,292
Why should I? I want to live.

212
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,919
I have more stories to tell.

213
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,214
Your time is up in your world.
You have nothing to lose,

214
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,675
no one to love.

215
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,637
Stop feeling guilty
for other people's death.

216
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,057
Virginia died in spite
of your care or your love.

217
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,434
Your mother succumbed
to my power

218
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:09,148
leaving you helplessly alone.

219
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,068
I was so young when she died...

220
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,029
I was denied even the
memory of her face.

221
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,239
Guilt never leads to any good.

222
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,283
If anything you are haunted...

223
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,369
Haunted by sorrow,

224
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:28,709
guilty not of a crime, but of
the inability to stop me...

225
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,211
If anything, I am guilty of

226
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,171
giving my readers
what they want.

227
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,382
A glimpse of redemption,

228
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:44,350
stories with a moral
where justice always triumphs.

229
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,186
Is this what you mean?

230
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,463
It is impossible to say how
first the idea entered my brain;

231
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,590
but once conceived,

232
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,551
it haunted me day and night.

233
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,928
Object,

234
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,221
there was none,

235
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,764
I loved the old man.

236
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,767
He had never wronged me.
He had never given me insult,

237
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,310
and for his money,

238
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,063
I had no desire.

239
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,022
I think

240
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,359
it was his eye!

241
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,238
Yes, that was it!

242
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,116
One of his eyes resembled
that of a vulture.

243
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,202
I made up my mind

244
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:12,248
to take the life of the old man,

245
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,670
and thus rid myself
of the eye forever.

246
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,965
You should have seen
how wisely I proceeded,

247
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,635
with what caution and foresight
I went to work.

248
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,180
And every night, about midnight,

249
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:33,352
I turned the latch of
his door and opened it.

250
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,897
And then, when my
head was well in the room,

251
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,567
I undid the lantern cautiously,

252
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,653
oh, so cautiously.

253
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,530
I undid it just so much

254
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,909
that a single thin ray
fell upon the vulture eye.

255
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:53,038
But I found the
eye always closed;

256
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,623
and so

257
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,791
it was impossible

258
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,211
to do the work;

259
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,631
for it was not the old man
who vexed me,

260
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,759
but his Evil Eye.

261
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,846
I was never kinder
to the old man than during

262
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:15,853
the whole week
before I killed him.

263
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,273
And this I did for
seven long nights.

264
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:25,321
Every night, just at midnight.

265
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:32,244
But I found the
eye always closed.

266
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,038
Upon the eighth night

267
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,375
I was more than usually cautious
in opening the door.

268
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:43,881
A watch's minute hand moves
more quickly than did mine.

269
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,258
When I was about to
open the lantern,

270
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,388
my thumb slipped
upon the tin fastening.

271
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,600
And the old man sprang up in bed

272
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,144
crying out: Who's there?

273
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,606
He had been trying
to fancy them causeless.

274
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,650
He had been saying to himself:

275
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,694
"it is nothing
but the wind in the chimney.

276
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,489
It is only a mouse
crossing the floor."

277
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,951
But all in vain...

278
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,832
Then, there came to my ears

279
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,209
a low, dull, quick sound

280
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,504
such as the watch makes
when enveloped in cotton.

281
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,089
I knew that sound well.

282
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,298
It was the beating

283
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,177
of the old man's heart.

284
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,062
Meantime the hellish tattoo
of the heart increased.

285
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,147
It grew quicker and quicker,

286
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:48,946
louder and louder,
every instant.

287
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:54,076
The old man's hour had come!

288
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:58,622
He shrieked once, only once.

289
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,798
The old man was dead.

290
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,761
His eye would
trouble me no more.

291
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,764
If still you think me mad,

292
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,434
you will think so no longer

293
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,352
when I describe

294
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:23,981
the wise precautions I took
for the concealment of the body.

295
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,108
First of all I
dismembered the corpse,

296
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,944
I then took up three planks
from the flooring

297
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:34,450
and deposited all
between the scantlings.

298
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:39,246
I then replaced the boards
so cleverly, so cunningly,

299
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:48,922
that no human eye could have
detected anything wrong.

300
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,592
There entered three men,
who introduced themselves

301
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,135
as officers of the police.

302
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,138
A shriek had been heard by
a neighbor during the night

303
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,849
and they had been deputed
to search the premises.

304
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,934
I bid the gentleman welcome.

305
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:05,439
The shriek, I said,
was my own in a dream.

306
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,649
The old man, I mentioned,

307
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:12,946
was absent in the country.

308
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,657
The officers were satisfied,

309
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,077
my manner had convinced them.

310
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,621
But, ere long,

311
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:25,501
I felt myself getting pale

312
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:32,466
and wished them gone.

313
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,218
My head ached

314
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:39,389
and I fancied a
ringing in my ears.

315
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,407
I found that the noise
was not within my ears.

316
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,081
I gasped for breath,

317
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,542
and yet the officers

318
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,252
heard it not.

319
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:16,760
Why would they not be gone?

320
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:17,928
Oh God!

321
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,639
What could I do?

322
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,852
Was it possible they heard not?

323
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,812
No!... No!

324
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,605
They heard;

325
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,401
they suspected!

326
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,903
THEY KNEW!

327
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,072
They were making mockery

328
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:42,286
of my horror.

329
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,871
"Villains!"

330
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:49,209
I shrieked, "I admit the deed!

331
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,462
"Tear up the planks!

332
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,506
"Here,

333
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:58,510
"here!

334
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:02,639
"It is the beating

335
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:08,562
"of his hideous heart!"

336
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,496
So you presume
everyone is guilty

337
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,832
of some unfathomable crime?

338
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,752
A crime that should
remain unpunished?

339
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,253
I feel flattered.

340
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:37,633
Your obsession with death is to
my ears like a sweet love song.

341
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:43,222
What do you mean, obsession?

342
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,431
Come with me,

343
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,725
don't delay for another second.

344
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,938
Being alive in this world
brings you more unbearable pain

345
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,107
and suffering than those
who wish to sleep forever

346
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,568
even as you try to extend life

347
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:03,325
beyond my sweet embrace.

348
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,870
I remember vaguely,
once I wrote about a doctor.

349
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,581
Someone who challenged you.

350
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,041
My attention, for
the last three years,

351
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:38,795
had been repeatedly drawn
to the subject of Mesmerism.

352
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,682
In Boston, a 13-year-old
child under hypnosis

353
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,642
could diagnose his own illness,

354
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,354
one which his own doctors
could not determine.

355
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,647
And in India, a paraplegic,

356
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,775
placed in a similar
hypnotic state,

357
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,485
managed to take some steps!

358
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,028
Imagine, Mr. Valdemar,

359
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,073
the progress that Mesmerism
offers to science!

360
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,784
My friend,
I respect your enthusiasm,

361
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,994
but for my part, I can't disavow

362
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,414
my skepticism
about the future of hypnosis.

363
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:21,421
Our table is waiting for
us at the Black Swan.

364
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,548
In addition, it
seems that no person

365
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,635
has as yet been mesmerized
in articulo mortis.

366
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,429
What a great testimony
will that be,

367
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:33,266
witnessing the transition
between life and death.

368
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:37,396
My friend, if you promise
to change the subject,

369
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,231
I am ready to volunteer myself

370
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,067
to this experiment
at the time of my death.

371
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,610
Really?

372
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,292
Yes, but rest assured,

373
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:03,463
I have no intention
of dying anytime soon!

374
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,146
It is now rather more
than seven months

375
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:26,361
since last time I talked
with M. Valdemar.

376
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,573
Phthisis has attacked my lungs.

377
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:36,788
They give me a few
months at most.

378
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,125
M. Valdemar,
do you remember your promise?

379
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,794
I beg your pardon?

380
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,255
Yes, the idea may seem absurd,

381
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,967
but think of all you
have to gain now.

382
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,510
No...

383
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,305
I don't know.

384
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:59,144
Allow me to consider it.

385
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,771
Valdemar, you are condemned.

386
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,024
You have no family or home.

387
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,401
What have you to lose?

388
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,112
Promise me you will
think about it.

389
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,114
Very well,

390
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:18,955
lam in your hands.

391
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,792
It was finally arranged between
us that he would send for me

392
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,045
about twenty-four
hours before the period

393
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,088
announced by his physicians

394
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,759
as that of his decease.

395
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,261
I received this note
within half an hour

396
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,139
after it was written,
and in fifteen minutes more,

397
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:41,186
I was in the dying
man's chamber.

398
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,563
It was about five
minutes to eight when,

399
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:44,689
taking the patient's hand,

400
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,526
I begged him to state
as distinctly as he could

401
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,986
to Dr. I whether he
was entirely willing

402
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,949
that I should make the
experiment of mesmerizing him

403
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,745
in his then condition.

404
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:03,542
Yes, I wish to be mesmerized.

405
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:08,213
I fear you have
deferred it too long.

406
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,526
At five minutes before eleven,

407
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:34,155
I perceived unequivocal signs
of the mesmeric influence.

408
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,833
When I had accomplished this,
it was fully midnight,

409
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,960
and I requested the
gentlemen present

410
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:50,297
to examine
M. Valdemar's condition.

411
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,132
The patient's extremities

412
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:57,887
were of an icy coldness.

413
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:04,686
Still, the general appearance
was not that of death.

414
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,521
Monsieur Valdemar,

415
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:10,442
are you asleep?

416
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,444
Yes,

417
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:17,073
I am asleep now.

418
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:21,703
Do not wake me!

419
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:30,462
Let me die so!

420
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,173
It was now the opinion,
or rather the wish,

421
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,382
of the physicians,

422
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,844
that M. Valdemar should be
suffered to remain undisturbed

423
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,889
in his present apparently
tranquil condition,

424
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,391
until death should supervene,

425
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,727
and this,
it was now generally agreed,

426
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,563
must take place
within a few minutes.

427
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,149
I concluded, however,
to speak to him

428
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,610
once more.

429
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:59,240
Monsieur Valdemar,
do you still sleep?

430
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,533
Yes,

431
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,618
<i>“O.</i>

432
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,578
I have been sleeping

433
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,996
and now...

434
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:08,583
Now...

435
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:26,059
I am dead.

436
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,104
It was evident that,
so far, death,

437
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,022
or what is usually termed death,

438
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:35,944
had been arrested
by the mesmeric process.

439
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,779
The experiment is completed.

440
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:41,783
But... are we sure he's dead?

441
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,035
You've heard it like me, right?

442
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,121
Is your scientific mind
restricted

443
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:51,793
by that which you can only see
or hear yourself?

444
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,754
From this period
until the close of last week,

445
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,590
an interval of
nearly seven months,

446
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:02,554
we continued to make daily calls
at M. Valdemar's house.

447
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,890
I managed to convince my
colleagues to leave M. Valdemar

448
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,852
in this state and
to monitor him.

449
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:20,280
First, we confined ourselves
to simple daily observations.

450
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,284
But soon, we were obliged
to face the facts.

451
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,953
Gentlemen,
we are not advancing our work.

452
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:31,207
These observations
are too superficial.

453
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,209
You still wish to
dissect the subject

454
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,961
like a laboratory animal.

455
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,963
Without going that far,

456
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,674
we can engage in
some light tests.

457
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,301
You are mistaken! I...

458
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,095
What are you suggesting, Dr. L?

459
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,431
Well, we could always...

460
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:49,142
let it be.

461
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,777
There is nothing further
to be done.

462
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,780
All of the subject's vital
functions are inert.

463
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:47,617
He has stopped breathing, his
heart no longer beats, yet...

464
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,162
in seven months, decomposition
has not attacked his body

465
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,665
and no treatment has
cured his illness.

466
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:57,293
Medically, M. Valdemar is dead.

467
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,087
Let's wake him up.

468
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,880
You're talking nonsense!

469
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,509
These thoughts are sacrilege!
Insanity!

470
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,886
You would not agree
to put him in this state

471
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,347
and now you refuse
to release him from it?

472
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,015
'III

473
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,227
Let it go my friend,
Dr. P is right.

474
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,688
M. Valdemar is legally dead.

475
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:22,026
All we can do now
is to offer him a decent burial.

476
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,074
It was on Friday last
that we finally resolved

477
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,326
to make the experiment
of awakening,

478
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,705
or attempting to awaken him.

479
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,957
For the purpose of
relieving M. Valdemar

480
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,625
from the mesmeric trance,

481
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,420
I made use of the
customary passes.

482
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:45,717
These, for a time,
were unsuccessful.

483
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,011
M. Valdemar,

484
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:53,099
can you explain to us what your
feelings or wishes are now?

485
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,851
For God's sake!

486
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,603
Quick! Quick!

487
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,937
Put me to sleep!

488
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,231
Or Waken me! Quick!

489
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,109
I say to you that I am dead!

490
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,028
Dead!

491
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,364
Dead!!!

492
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,545
For what really
occurred, however,

493
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,131
it is quite impossible
that any living human

494
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:28,426
could have been prepared.

495
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:46,152
And as I can see, he lost...

496
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:50,406
lost to me.

497
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,492
He was so close...

498
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:56,955
so close to sparing M. Valdemar
from your fatal embrace.

499
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,207
Was that a crime?

500
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,501
A crime against fate.

501
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:06,714
And your sentence
was a life of endless sorrow.

502
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,467
Stop with your
tortured mind games.

503
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:13,262
There is nothing worse than
imagining your own death.

504
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,222
Isn't it?

505
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,017
Nothing worse than
to fear eternity.

506
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,019
I wrote a story once.

507
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,188
A tale about someone
who relived the hell

508
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,691
of dying a thousand deaths.

509
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,777
Perhaps a mirror where you
saw yourself reflected,

510
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,153
every image

511
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,115
a different death.

512
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:42,727
I was sick...

513
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:46,481
sick to death with
that long agony.

514
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:50,860
And when they unbound me, I felt
that my senses were leaving me.

515
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,204
The sentence...

516
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,206
the dread sentence of death...

517
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,458
was the last of
distinct accentuation

518
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,753
which reached my ears.

519
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,338
After that,

520
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:14,133
the sound of the inquisitorial
voices seemed merged

521
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:23,684
into one dreamy
indeterminate hum.

522
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,603
I heard no more.

523
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:26,938
Yet, for a while,

524
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:30,108
I saw the lips of the judges.

525
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:35,321
I saw them pronouncing
the syllables of my name,

526
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:40,785
and I shuddered
because I heard no sound.

527
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,392
The tall candles sank
into nothingness;

528
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,644
their flames went out.

529
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:11,440
The blackness of darkness
supervened.

530
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,733
All sensations appeared

531
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:16,404
swallowed up in a mad
rushing descent as of the soul

532
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,990
into Hades.

533
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,994
Then silence, and stillness,

534
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,997
night were the universe.

535
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:08,831
After this I call to mind
flatness and dampness;

536
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,791
and then all the
madness of a memory

537
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:18,174
which busies itself
among forbidden things.

538
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,636
So far, I had not
opened my eyes.

539
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:29,810
I dreaded the first glance
at objects around me.

540
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:33,689
My worst thoughts, then,
were confirmed.

541
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:40,863
The blackness of eternal night
encompassed me.

542
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,032
I struggled for breath.

543
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:47,453
The atmosphere was
intolerably close.

544
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,621
But where

545
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:52,458
and in what state was I?

546
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,502
The condemned to death, I knew,

547
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,255
perished usually
at the autos-da-fe,

548
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,131
and one of
these had been held

549
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:03,552
on the very night
of the day of my trial.

550
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,013
Had I been remanded
to my dungeon,

551
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,891
to await the next
sacrifice, which

552
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:12,853
would not take
place for many months?

553
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,447
And now,

554
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,200
there came thronging
upon my recollection

555
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:30,955
a thousand vague rumors
of the horrors of Toledo.

556
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,081
Of the dungeons

557
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:35,251
there had been
strange things narrated,

558
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:39,088
strange, and too
ghastly to repeat.

559
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,854
Was I left to
perish of starvation

560
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,566
in this subterranean
world of darkness;

561
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,570
or what fate,
perhaps even more fearful,

562
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,488
awaited me?

563
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,594
My outstretched hands at length

564
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:30,056
encountered some solid
obstruction.

565
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,599
It was a wall,

566
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,602
I followed it up.

567
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:38,939
This process, however,
afforded me no means

568
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:43,736
of ascertaining
the dimensions of my dungeon.

569
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,664
Another step before my fall,

570
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:40,709
and the world had
seen me no more.

571
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,308
And the death just avoided,

572
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,061
was of that very character
which I had regarded

573
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,647
as fabulous and frivolous

574
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,901
in the tales regarding
the Inquisition.

575
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,287
To the victims of its tyranny,

576
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,247
there was the choice of death

577
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,666
with its direst physical
agonies,

578
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:25,588
or death with its most hideous
moral horrors.

579
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:29,425
I had been reserved
for the latter.

580
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,857
I was consumed with
intolerable thirst.

581
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:48,527
This thirst it appeared to be
the design of my persecutors

582
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,029
to stimulate:

583
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,573
for the food in
the dish was meat

584
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,366
pungently seasoned.

585
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,000
It must have been drugged;

586
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:06,378
for scarcely had I drunk,

587
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,174
before I became
irresistibly drowsy.

588
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:26,357
I could no longer doubt

589
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:30,319
the doom prepared for me
by monkish ingenuity in torture.

590
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,821
My cognizance of the pit
had become known

591
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,199
to the inquisitorial.

592
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,867
Having failed to fall,

593
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,786
it was no part of the demon plan

594
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,871
to hurl me into the abyss,

595
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:45,501
and thus a different and a
milder destruction awaited me.

596
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:19,618
I counted the rushing
vibrations of the steel!

597
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,495
Inch by inch...

598
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,622
line by line...

599
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:30,254
with a descent only appreciable
at intervals that seemed ages.

600
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,725
Down... steadily down it crept.

601
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:47,313
Down... certainly,
relentlessly down!

602
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,442
It vibrated within three inches
of my bosom!

603
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:05,372
I prayed for its
more speedy descent.

604
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,499
I grew frantically mad,
and struggled

605
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,418
to force myself upward

606
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,339
against the sweep
of the fearful scimitar.

607
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,941
For the moment, at least,

608
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,859
I was free.

609
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:24,618
Free! And in the grasp
of the Inquisition!

610
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,911
Free!

611
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,871
I had but escaped death

612
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,790
in one form of agony,

613
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:34,837
to be delivered unto worse
than death in some other.

614
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,386
For a wild moment,

615
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,554
did my spirit refuse

616
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:49,518
to comprehend the meaning
of what I saw.

617
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,312
Any horror but this!

618
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,482
Any death but that of the pit!

619
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,110
Might I have not known
that into the pit

620
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,572
it was the object
of the burning iron to urge me?

621
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:06,076
Could I resist its glow?

622
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,758
There was a discordant hum
of human voices!

623
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,844
There was a loud blast.

624
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:27,848
The French army
had entered Toledo.

625
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:33,437
The Inquisition was in
the hands of its enemies.

626
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:45,783
You have devoted
so many pages to my name,

627
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,786
caressing my face
with your poems,

628
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,872
kissing my lips with your prose.

629
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:57,795
All veiled love letters
addressed to me.

630
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,509
You fear me

631
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,221
and yet you are
insatiably attracted.

632
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:11,391
Come with me. It's time.

633
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:15,729
No, it cannot be.
I don't want to be forgotten.

634
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,689
I was buried in a common grave.

635
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:22,361
My writings were
forgotten for years.

636
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,655
You are already dead.

637
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:28,242
How could you remember
your own death...

638
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:33,914
unless you have succumbed
to my embrace?

639
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:36,583
Your life is not
worth living anymore.

640
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,668
It is time

641
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,378
to meet your own ghosts,

642
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:45,259
the people you loved
and lost forever.

643
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,928
Come now, Poe.

644
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,596
You love me!

645
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:52,349
You've been a corpse
walking amongst the living

646
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:55,310
for a long time, Edgar.

647
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,272
It must have been
quite a strain.

648
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,940
Maybe you're right.

649
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:03,151
Sometimes I think the only thing
that kept me from you

650
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,445
was my beating heart.

651
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,781
Look at your final act.

652
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:10,033
They all succumb to my prowess.

653
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,702
The poor, the weak;

654
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,872
the rich, the powerful.

655
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,875
Everybody bows before me.

656
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,003
I offer you one last chance.

657
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:56,893
Who dares insult us with
this blasphemous mockery?

658
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,822
I don't want my work
to be lost forever.

659
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,160
My work is eternal.

660
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,621
I want that eternity.

661
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:06,541
I want to be sure
my words will survive me,

662
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,711
that they will be
never lost in time.

663
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,878
That, my friend,

664
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,257
nevermore.
