00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,061
What do you mean?

369
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:08,028
MICHAEL: You're just not
your normal pissed-off self today,

370
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:08,896
that's all.

371
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:12,534
I met a girl.

372
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:13,901
Ah, there we go.

373
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:14,503
Great.

374
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:15,669
FRANKIE:
What?

375
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:16,871
Just don't get her pregnant,
okay?

376
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:18,507
I haven't even hooked up
with her yet.

377
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:19,807
What the fuck are you
talking about?

378
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:21,142
All I know is I met your mother,

379
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:23,043
I got her pregnant
with your sister Patricia,

380
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,945
and I did what
I'm supposed to do, okay?

381
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,747
I manned up.
I did the right thing.

382
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,415
And boy, was that
a fucking mistake.

383
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,185
I mean, marrying your mother.

384
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:32,253
I don't mean you kids.

385
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:33,254
That wasn't a mistake.

386
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:34,589
I love you kids, all right?

387
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:35,956
And come on, man, I just
don't want you to make

388
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:37,758
the same fucking mistakes
I made, that's all.

389
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,060
Don't worry about me, all right?

390
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:44,165
Well, then, so what?
Is she cute?

391
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:45,366
Yeah, cute?

392
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:46,967
Yeah, she's dope.

393
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,135
She's deaf.

394
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,204
Wait, wait, wait
what do you mean deaf?

395
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:52,106
Is this like some kind of
cool lingo?

396
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,609
No, like she can't hear, deaf.

397
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,876
MICHAEL:
Really?

398
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:57,845
Yeah, but I mean, it's cool.

399
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:00,681
How the fuck do you
communicate with her?

400
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:05,119
She reads lips and then
replies with text.

401
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,589
Well, I don't know,
maybe that's good.

402
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:08,889
She can't nag at you
all the time.

403
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:10,257
FRANKIE:
Jesus, man.

404
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:13,494
You really are just
a miserable person, aren't you?

405
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:15,664
[laughing]

406
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:16,764
What? What's so funny?

407
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:19,400
[chuckling]

408
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,636
MICHAEL: You remember
my friend Sal from high school,

409
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,470
the one that owns
that painting company?

410
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:24,138
Yeah.

411
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,274
Sal banged a deaf chick
back in the day.

412
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:30,277
Yeah, but she was butt ugly,
right?

413
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,845
She wasn't cute at all.

414
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:33,682
But Sal didn't care, 'cause
he would fuck anything, right?

415
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:35,015
Just so...

416
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:44,258
Anyway, so what was I saying?

417
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:45,492
Sal.

418
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:47,161
So Sal, he's banging this...
This... this girl, right?

419
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,063
And the neighbors called
the fucking cops,

420
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:51,198
because she was deaf, right,
so she couldn't tell

421
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:54,001
the volume of her voice
and you know, just

422
00:28:56,705 --> 00:28:57,771
look at this face.

423
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:59,173
Just be prepared for that.

424
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:00,474
That's all.
I'm just trying to help.

425
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,211
Thanks for the great advice,
man.

426
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:05,846
As always.

427
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:09,383
That's why I'm here, kid.

428
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:17,958
You remember when I was 6,
you'd take me to the ball game

429
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,960
after you'd take me to get
water ice?

430
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:21,996
Yeah, of course.

431
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,764
Best time of my life.

432
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:24,898
FRANKIE:
That's what I'm saying.

433
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,934
I mean, back then
you were sober.

434
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:29,069
At least, I think you were.

435
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:31,171
I mean, you weren't a mess
like you are now.

436
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,509
What's your point, Frankie?

437
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:35,744
What are you worried about?

438
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:36,810
What am I worried about?

439
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,845
Look at you.

440
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,514
Look at me what?

441
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,048
You got to eat something.

442
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:42,816
MICHAEL:
I'm not hungry, Frank.

443
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:44,852
It's on me.

444
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:48,122
Okay, Mr. Fucking Money Bags.

445
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:49,456
I don't give a shit
who pays for it.

446
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:51,492
If I'm not hungry,
I'm not gonna eat anything.

447
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:55,229
I just want...

448
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:56,631
I want you to
meet my kids one day, you know?

449
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:57,532
I don't want to have to
tell them that

450
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,499
you died a crackhead.

451
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,734
Oh, what did I tell you?

452
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,201
I told you no kids.

453
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,369
Wear a condom.

454
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:06,140
[chuckles]

455
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,974
You...

456
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:08,108
You're just like your mother.

457
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,009
You got no fucking
sense of humor.

458
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,477
I'm... I'm kidding, okay?

459
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:11,812
I'm fine.

460
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:13,180
Here, look, look.
You want to see this here.

461
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,015
[munching]

462
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,584
Okay, you happy now?

463
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:17,451
Delicious.

464
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:19,453
[chewing]

465
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,389
All right, don't leave me
in the dark now.

466
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:23,424
Tell me about this girl.

467
00:30:23,525 --> 00:30:24,191
Is she from the neighborhood?

468
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:24,825
What's her name?

469
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:27,027
Jane.

470
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:28,596
MICHAEL:
All right, Jane is a nice name.

471
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:29,997
Is she from the neighborhood?

472
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:31,932
No, Fairmont.

473
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:33,834
Yeah, that's fancy.

474
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:35,436
FRANKIE:
Not really.

475
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:36,970
Bullshit, Frankie. That's fancy.

476
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:38,405
So this fancy Jane
from Fairmont,

477
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:40,040
she has you thinking
about having kids?

478
00:30:42,276 --> 00:30:43,377
Maybe.

479
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:44,378
Interesting.

480
00:30:44,478 --> 00:30:46,180
I mean,
I'm not saying she's the one.

481
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,317
But I think about my future
sometimes.

482
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:54,589
What, as a pusher?

483
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:57,324
What is that supposed to mean?

484
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:03,130
You know, I know the deal, okay?

485
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,065
I know that I'm fucked up.

486
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:06,668
I know I'm no good.

487
00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:07,501
I admit it.

488
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:09,136
You can't.

489
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:12,940
You can't admit
that you're no good.

490
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,576
You ruin people's lives
for a living, Frankie.

491
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:15,876
You know that, right?

492
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:16,711
For 10 bucks a pop,
you ruin people's lives

493
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:17,978
and for what?

494
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,179
I don't fucking make them do it,
all right?

495
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:21,415
Oh.

496
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:24,017
That doesn't matter, son.

497
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:26,320
It's still on you.

498
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:34,194
[♪♪]

499
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:36,865
All right, look,
what the fuck do I know?

500
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:38,633
Ah, you listen to me?

501
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:39,567
You're gonna finish this?

502
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:47,667
[♪♪]

503
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:05,685
[♪♪]

504
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,998
JARVIS:
Make sure to take care.

505
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,634
[indistinct speech]

506
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,212
FRANKIE:
Why are you talking to Stefan?

507
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:29,517
JARVIS:
You don't like Stefan?

508
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:30,451
No, man.

509
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:36,457
That little motherfucker
is always setting me up.

510
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:39,594
FRANKIE: He's already
selling out of his house.

511
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:40,461
Really?

512
00:32:43,397 --> 00:32:44,933
Well, he's definitely
a motherfucker that will

513
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:46,668
pull on anybody I tell him to.

514
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,540
He'll sling, he'll collect,
and he'll pop someone.

515
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,108
You can fucking use him.

516
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,544
Just keep him out of
my business.

517
00:32:58,278 --> 00:32:59,848
Like this business?

518
00:32:59,948 --> 00:33:01,248
Is this your business?

519
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:04,752
Hey!

520
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:08,523
JARVIS:
Hey, you little shit.

521
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,627
CHRIS:
What up?

522
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:17,464
Do you know who I am?

523
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:21,368
Yeah.

524
00:33:24,238 --> 00:33:25,607
Do you know what's gonna
happen to you

525
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:27,642
if I catch you
out on this corner again?

526
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,409
Yeah.

527
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:37,317
You want to work?

528
00:33:41,523 --> 00:33:42,289
Text me.

529
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,226
But don't let me catch you
out on my corner again.

530
00:33:47,762 --> 00:33:48,428
You dig?

531
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:49,697
Yeah.

532
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:51,799
JARVIS:
That's a good guy.

533
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,111
What the fuck.

534
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:14,254
Keep an eye on that.

535
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,591
I will.

536
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:17,792
JARVIS:
You better.

537
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:20,494
I keep driving around here
and I see rival trappers

538
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:21,395
on my corner.

539
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:24,498
And I know you ain't gonna pull.

540
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,534
You ain't about that.

541
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:29,136
But I want you to know this.

542
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:32,540
Stefan is ready to go.

543
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,777
[phone vibrates]

544
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:40,615
Yo, I got to bounce.

545
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:45,419
Hey. Hold it down.

546
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,119
Yeah.

547

MICHEAL: I... I just...
I'm really screwed up.

I just need something

I just need something

Can you just help... help me out?

917
00:55:02,335 --> 00:55:03,237
No.

918
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:05,039
Why not?

919
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:06,908
I told you I'd never do that.

920
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:09,277
Okay, can you just
loan me some money then?

921
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:10,244
No, I can't.

922

Just let me
take you to the hospital.

They'll get you better.

No hospital, I...

950

He's smashing car windows

I'm gonna grab my purse

Hey, can we just chill

or something?

962
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:36,884
I don't want to.
My dad is upset.

963
00:58:38,552 --> 00:58:39,186
Why?

964
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:45,059
He has a copy of your record.

965
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:47,528
Oh.

966
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:49,663
How did he get that?

967
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:54,635
He just can with his work.

968

I don't... I don't know.

What does it say?

971
00:59:02,511 --> 00:59:06,313
Theft. Assault.

972
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:09,817
Is it all true?

973
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:12,920
Yeah.

974
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:16,525
Why?

975
00:59:16,624 --> 00:59:18,292
I mean, it's hard to explain.

976
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:23,931
Why?

977
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,900
Look, I don't come from this.

978
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:29,403
Like not many people
come from this.

979
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:31,439
What do you mean this?

980
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,774
Nothing was handed to me either.

981
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:37,278
Your dad ever try to
trade you for crack?

982
00:59:40,614 --> 00:59:41,715
No.

983
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:43,150
What are we talking about here?

984
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:45,554
I want to help you.

985
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:47,221
Help me with what?

986
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:50,024
However I can.

987
00:59:50,124 --> 00:59:50,858
You can't.

988
00:59:54,695 --> 00:59:57,098
What if I stayed here?

989
00:59:58,766 --> 00:59:59,967
What do you mean?

990
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:01,802
I went to college here
instead of Michigan.

991
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:05,005
We could be together.
We could live together.

992
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:09,376
You can't stay here.

993
01:00:10,678 --> 01:00:12,913
Why? Penn is better.

994
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:17,651
No, it doesn't have
the deaf doctor dude.

995
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:19,854
It's the whole reason
you're going to Michigan.

996
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:21,556
I'm not gonna be the reason.

997
01:00:21,655 --> 01:00:23,357
Plus, your dad already
hates me enough.

998
01:00:23,457 --> 01:00:24,593
How do you expect this to work?

999
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:26,561
I'm staying.

1000
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,394
No, you're not.

1001
01:00:27,495 --> 01:00:28,162
I'm staying.

1002
01:00:28,262 --> 01:00:28,696
No, you're not.

1003
01:00:28,796 --> 01:00:29,296
I'm leaving.

01:00:36,538 --> 01:00:37,671

You love me?

01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,748
How do you know?

1008
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:52,286
I can't explain it,
but I love you.

1009
01:00:54,088 --> 01:00:56,123
I don't know what
you want me to say.

1010
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:59,026
Come with me then?

1011
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:01,195
I can't come, Jane.
You know that.

1012
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:02,196
I have Sean.

1013
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,698

01:01:10,505 --> 01:01:12,706
I'm telling my dad tonight.

1017
01:01:13,575 --> 01:01:15,510
Why would you do that, Jane?

1018
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,244
Because I love you.

1019
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:20,681
And I know you're better than
anything you've donein your past.

1020
01:01:26,588 --> 01:01:27,788
Well, I don't love you.

this here can go two ways.

1092
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,535
It took my grandma 50 years
to even have the opportunity

1093
01:05:33,635 --> 01:05:35,402
to be able to own.

1094
01:05:35,502 --> 01:05:38,706
So, you know I got to
keep that dream alive.

1095
01:05:41,408 --> 01:05:43,410
I don't know no other niggers
that own houses.

1096
01:05:46,346 --> 01:05:48,616
I didn't know you had it
planned out like that.

1097

You better get that GED, nigger.

Nothing.

FRANKIE: What did you
just put in your pocket?

1105
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:28,388
What the fuck is this?

1106
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:30,792
What the fuck, dude?
Are you dealing now?

1107
01:06:30,892 --> 01:06:32,125
Fucking answer me.

1108

Look in the cupboards, Frank.

1110
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:40,234
There's not a freaking thing
in there.

1111
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:42,269
We got no food, no toilet paper.

1112
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:51,345
What the fuck is that?

1113
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:53,080
Where is it?

1114
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,047
In my room.

1115
01:07:03,725 --> 01:07:05,158
You forgot the ketchup.

That's it?

1117
01:07:24,612 --> 01:07:25,680
Yeah.

Who gave it to you?

1119
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:27,949
Stefan.

Yo, Stefan.

Yo, what's up?

1124
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:47,401
FRANKIE:
Stay away from Sean.

You hear me?

1126
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,204
Fuck you, nigger.

1127
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:52,607
I'm Sean's step daddy.

What?

What, you ain't know?

Me and your sister like this.

Yo, stay away from Sean,
all right?

1132

Fuck you gonna do about it?

Yeah, just tell Jarvis.

They just try to act like
they know me.

Niggers don't know me, nigger.

You know what I mean?

you let Stefan do that?

That kid was probably
Sean's age.

I don't give a shit.

1173

The dude's a fucking kid.

1175

Why is that?

1233

Because you're not

How are you doing?

1243
01:16:52,947 --> 01:16:54,381
I mean, about that,
are you all right?

1244
01:16:54,482 --> 01:16:55,749

1245
01:16:57,519 --> 01:16:58,587
You sure?

1246
01:16:58,686 --> 01:16:59,386
Yeah, why?

1247
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:02,890
Well, you know,
for the last 10 years

1248
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:05,059
every time I saw you,
you were angry about something,

1249
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:08,262
you know, and it was only when
this deaf girl came into

1250
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:10,965
the picture that you were all
positive and smiles.

1251
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:16,370
Look, I know that I fucked up
with you and your sister.

1252
01:17:18,973 --> 01:17:21,909
I mean, I had a lot of time
to think about this shit.

1253
01:17:22,009 --> 01:17:22,743
I'm fine.

1254
01:17:22,843 --> 01:17:24,812
No, just hear me out, all right?

1255
01:17:24,912 --> 01:17:28,816
I mean, you know,
your Mom, God rest her soul,

1256
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:31,118
you know, she... she let me back
into her life

1257
01:17:31,218 --> 01:17:32,853
when she got diagnosed
with the cancer, you know,

1258
01:17:32,953 --> 01:17:35,524
she felt guilty, because
she blamed herself

1259
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:37,725
for my addiction
and for being a fuck-up.

1260
01:17:38,993 --> 01:17:41,862
And so she let me back in,
you know, and...

1261
01:17:43,063 --> 01:17:44,965
You know, I really loved
your Mom.

1262
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,135
You know, I really did,
more than anything.

1263
01:17:48,235 --> 01:17:50,237
I don't...
I don't even care anymore.

1264
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:51,272
I mean, I don't.

1265
01:17:51,372 --> 01:17:52,439
I don't want to talk about Mom.

1266
01:17:55,075 --> 01:17:57,378
Did you know I stole from her

No, seriously, your Mom,

that she just gave Patty

Okay.

1359
01:21:29,089 --> 01:21:31,258
Three plus parenthesis,

1360
01:21:31,358 --> 01:21:33,628
three minus eight parenthesis,

1361
01:21:33,728 --> 01:21:35,929

Dude, I used to
hate this stuff, too.

1363
01:21:38,298 --> 01:21:40,067
But math I like,
'cause if you know how to

1364
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,503
attack the formulas,
then you're good.

1365
01:21:42,604 --> 01:21:46,340
So all you want to do is start
within the parentheses first.

1366
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,476
So it's three minus eight,
which is negative five.

1367
01:21:49,577 --> 01:21:51,378
Then negative five
times negative five

1368
01:21:51,478 --> 01:21:52,680
is 25.

1369
01:21:52,781 --> 01:21:55,916
Squared means it's that number
times that same number.

1370

Oh my God, dude.
I don't get it.

all about knowing how to

1372
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:03,957
attack the formulas.

1373
01:22:04,057 --> 01:22:07,796
Okay, so we have 25,
and now we just go outside

1374
01:22:07,896 --> 01:22:09,531
the parentheses
and work the problem

1375
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:10,765
from left to right.

1376
01:22:10,865 --> 01:22:13,400
So it's three plus 25
minus seven.

1377
01:22:16,571 --> 01:22:17,237
21.

1378
01:22:17,337 --> 01:22:18,372
