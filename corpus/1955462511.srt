Enjoy! :)

2
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:45,914
I know what you're thinkin'...

3
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:50,824
What the heck do I need a 5-spindle for...

4
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:54,836
when I barely sell enough milkshakes to
justify my 3-spindle. Right?

5
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:55,643
Wrong.

6
00:00:56,894 --> 00:01:00,171
Are you familiar with the notion of the
chicken or the egg Mr. Griffith, I mentioned...

7
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:01,059
that there'd be costs.

8
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,125
Well, I think it applies here.

9
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:08,099
Do you not need the multimixer because, well heck,
you're not selling enough milkshakes.

10
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,671
Or are you not selling enough milkshakes
because you don't have a multimixer?

11
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,620
I firmly believe it's the latter.

12
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:17,776
Because your customer comes in here and he
knows if he orders a shake from your establishment...

13
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,928
that well, he's in for a terrific wait.

14
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:23,686
He's done it before and he thinks to himself, well
by golly, I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

15
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:27,961
But if ya had the Prince Castle,
5-spindle, multi-mixer...

16
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:33,629
with patented direct-drive electric motor
we'd greatly increase your ability to produce...

17
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,001
delicious, frosty milkshakes, FAST.
Mark my words.

18
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:44,895
Dollars to donuts, you'll be sellin' more
of those sons of bitches...

19
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:47,071
then you can shake a stick at.

20
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:53,873
You increase the supply,
and the demand will follow...

21
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:55,190
Increase supply, demand follows.

22
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:57,302
Chicken, egg. Do you follow my logic?

23
00:01:57,847 --> 00:02:00,751
I know you do because you're a
bright, forward thinking guy who...

24
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,476
knows a good idea when he hears one.

25
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,560
So...

26
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:09,242
What do you say?

27
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,169
Nah.

28
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,582
But thanks anyways.

29
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:16,344
Order's up.

30
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,041
Hey, Miss?

31
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,399
How much longer?

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,266
- It shouldn't be a few more minutes.
- You said that 20 minutes ago.

33
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:27,363
I'm so sorry.
We're really busy today.

34
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:38,051
Ya see it's only sense.
The reason your budget will decrease...

35
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,733
supply, demand will follow.
Chicken and the egg...

36
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,031
Ya follow my logic?

37
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:44,127
Of course you do. You're a
bright, foward-thinking guy...

38
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:46,063
who knows a good idea when he hears one.

39
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:51,183
So...
What do you say?

40
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,420
There ya go.

41
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:11,263
- What is...
- Enjoy.

42
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:13,438
I ordered the barbecue beef.

43
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:25,180
I got a lot of good leads.
Real, real strong leads.

44
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,122
Yup.

45
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:27,139
What?

46
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,592
Nothing.

47
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,293
- That's wonderful.
- Wow.

48
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:32,651
I mean it's just tremendous interest.

49
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,107
Well I'm sure there is.

50
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,601
You sound like you don't believe me.

51
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:37,485
- Of course I do. Why wouldn't...
- Alright...

52
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,371
Well I got a lot of paperwork
to do here so, uh...

53
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:43,623
I'll, I'll call you from the road tomorrow.

54
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,753
- Okay.
- Alright. Alright.

55
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:29,669
Persistence. Nothing in the world
can take the place of persistence.

56
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,491
Talent won't.

57
00:05:31,492 --> 00:05:35,762
Nothing is more common than
unsuccessful men with talent.

58
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:37,987
Genius won't.

59
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:41,850
Unrewarded genius is
practically a cliché.

60
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,817
Education won't.

61
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:48,469
The world is full of educated fools.

62
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,367
Persistence and determination
alone are all powerful.

63
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:57,118
Show that you don't have to
be defeated by anything.

64
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,519
That you can have peace of mind,
improved health...

65
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,363
and a never-ceasing flow of energy.

66
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:07,073
If you attempt each and every
day to achieve these things...

67
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:10,344
the results will make themselves
obvious to you.

68
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:14,793
While it may sound like a magical notion...

69
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:18,171
it is in you to create
your own future.

70
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:21,860
The greatest discovery
of my generation is...

71
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:28,169
that human beings can alter their
lives by altering their attitude of mind.

72
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:31,244
War (?) and Ralph Waldo Emerson
declared...

73
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:35,514
"A man is what he thinks
about all day long."

74
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:21,746
Prince Castle sales,
how can I help you?

75
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,583
- Hi June.
- Hey, how's it goin' down there?

76
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,558
Good. Swell.
A lot of interest.

77
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,960
Hold on, let me
fetch your messages.

78
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:28,468
Let's see...

79
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,953
Jean (?) Rafferty from United Aluminum
needs to reschedule Friday.

80
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:34,333
Ed Nance calling about the refund.

81
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:38,153
Sloan and Sons called again.
We're 60 days past due.

82
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:40,054
A lady from the March of Dimes.
Oh!...

83
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:42,163
We got an order...

84
00:07:42,164 --> 00:07:42,891
6 mixers.

85
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,044
- 6?
- Mmm hmm.

86
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:45,488
Some drive-in out in California.

87
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:48,580
Same place, one place?
No that's impossible.

88
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:49,430
I got the slip right here.

89
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:53,550
No, you I'm sure misunderstood.
You know what, gimme the number.

90
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,716
- You got a pen?
- Okay.

91
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:56,275
Alright.

92
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:04,977
Hello, McDonald's.

93
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:07,180
Hello, good afternoon.
May I please speak with your owner.

94
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:07,917
Which one?

95
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:09,050
I'm sorry?

96
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:10,451
Dick or Mac?

97
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,282
Uh... whichever one
is available I guess.

98
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:12,916
Hold on!

99
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,402
- This is Dick.
- Hello Dick, this is Ray Krok...

100
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:21,248
from Prince Castle sales.
The reason I'm calling is...

101
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:22,249
- someone placed an order...
- Yes, yes. That was me.

102
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,671
How soon can you get 'em out here?

103
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,319
Well that's actually why I'm
phoning now Dick actually...

104
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
I think there might have been some
kind of miscommunication...

105
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:29,300
Freezer!

106
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,356
Top shelf, left side.
Sorry.

107
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:32,074
No problem!

108
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:35,369
Uh... my secretary's under the
impression that you wanted 6.

109
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,992
Yah, uh... you know what?
I think that was a mistake.

110
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:39,145
Well that's what I figured.

111
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:42,647
I mean what kind of drive-in could
make 30 milkshakes at a time.

112
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,844
Better make it 8.

113
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:46,038
What's that Al?

114
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,535
There's a brand new box in the...
Now isn't the best time.

115
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,248
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I understand.

116
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,302
Ah, I'm still a little bit...

117
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:54,293
You know where to send 'em, right?
San Bernardino, California...

118
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:56,012
- corner of 14th and 8th.
- Hold on a minute. Alright.

119
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,270
To anyone in particular?

120
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,271
Just the store is fine.
McDonalds.

121
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:01,041
- Okay? Thanks so much.
- Yeah, uh...

122
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:57,575
- Don't worry, it moves fast.
- Really?

123
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,988
You guys have a great day.

124
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:08,824
Hi, welcome to McDonald's,
may I take your order?

125
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:12,865
Yeah, gimme a hamburger and
french fries and a Coca-Cola.

126
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:14,233
That'd be $0.35 cents please.

127
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:15,044
Alright.

128
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:20,929
$0.15 cents is your change.

129
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:25,470
Here you are.

130
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:27,194
What is this?

131
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:28,382
Your food.

132
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,627
No, no, no...
I just ordered.

133
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,863
And now it's here.

134
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,781
Are ya sure?

135
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:36,681
Great.

136
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:40,452
Where are the uh... ya know,
silverware and plates and everything.

137
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:43,407
You just eat it straight outta the wrapper,
and then you throw it all out.

138
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:45,394
Alright.

139
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,362
Really?

140
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:50,226
Okay.

141
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:53,322
Where do I eat it?

142
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,288
In your car... ?

143
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,794
At the park?

144
00:11:58,568 --> 00:11:59,800
- Yeah.
- Home...

145
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:02,476
- Wherever you'd like!
- Okay, okay... thanks.

146
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,144
May we join you?

147
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:35,109
Huh? Yeah.
Sure.

148
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,294
Thank you!

149
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,902
Ah, just throw it right there,
I'll take care of it.

150
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,070
How is everything?

151
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:04,245
This might be the best
hamburger I've ever had in my life.

152
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:05,365
Well, we aim to please.

153
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,649
Uh... Mac McDonald.

154
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:12,420
Oh!

155
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,023
Well, look at this.

156
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:14,670
Ray Kroc.

157
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:16,880
The multimixer fella.

158
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:19,032
- You spoke with my brother Dick.
- I did, yeah.

159
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:21,738
What are you doin' way out here?

160
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:22,805
I'm in Los Angeles,
business meeting...

161
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:25,508
I thought, I'm in the neighborhood,
I should just swing by and say hello.

162
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,806
Well, I'm sure glad you did.

163
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:30,260
This whole thing?
This is some operation.

164
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:31,331
Care for a little tour?

165
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,604
- Of the... ?
- Yeah.

166
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:34,754
Yeah, I would.

167
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:36,716
Well, finish up, I'll
come back for ya.

168
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:37,532
Alrighty! Thanks.

169
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:21,417
Speed. That's the
name of the game.

170
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:24,662
The first stop for every
McDonald's hamburger is the grill...

171
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:29,257
manned by 2 cooks whose soul job it is
to grill those all beef beauties to perfection.

172
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:31,288
Meanwhile, as the patty cooks...

173
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,225
our dressers get the buns ready.

174
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:34,077
Watch out!

175
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:37,689
- Burger crossing!
- Burgers crossing. Burgers crossing.

176
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:40,068
Every McDonald's burger...

177
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:41,437
has 2 pickles...

178
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,429
a pinch of onions and a precise
shot of ketchup and mustard.

179
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,070
- Now where'd ya get those?
- We made 'em.

180
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,707
- Made them?!
- Yeah, custom built. Whole kitchen is.

181
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:53,047
- Next!
- That is...

182
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:55,488
The finishing station where
we put the whole thing together.

183
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:06,588
And...

184
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:03,648
Violá!

185
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:06,677
A fresh delicious burger from
grill to counter in 30 seconds.

186
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,663
How the heck did you come up with this?

187
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:13,535
Oh I didn't. We did.
Dick McDonald, my brother.

188
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:16,456
Hi, boy I gotta tell ya...
This is the most...

189
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,060
well it's nice to meet you.

190
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,856
The fries...

191
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:22,826
What about 'em?

192
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:24,347
They're 5 percent too crisp.

193
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,983
No, they're perfect.

194
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:30,129
I think we should drop to
2 minutes, 50 seconds.

195
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,755
Wasn't that what we were at before?

196
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:33,477
400, not 375

197
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:35,081
Higher temp, shorter cook.

198
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:36,212
I think they're spot on.

199
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:36,954
Fellas excuse me, may I?

200
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:39,241
None of my beeswax, but
I'm with the big fella here...

201
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:42,328
I love 'em. Golden brown on the
outside, fluffy white inside...

202
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:46,730
- and they're not too oily, salty, crunchy, whatever...
- Who are you?

203
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:49,306
Oh this is Ray Kroc,
the multi-mixer fella you spoke to.

204
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:50,739
So when do you figure
we can expect 'em?

205
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,843
- Eh... sent them blue label air so...
- Good, good...

206
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:54,807
- Need 'em for backup.
- Hey, wait, wait...

207
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:57,655
Wait, wait... wait a minute.

208
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,230
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

209
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,093
You're really not my type.

210
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:03,581
- You and your brother.
- What for?

211
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:08,751
This is the most remarkable food restaurant I've
ever seen in all my years in this industry...

212
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:09,621
and I've seen it all.

213
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:11,644
I wanna hear your story.

214
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,080
Well... we were young and hungry...

215
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:19,563
and there wasn't a job to be
had in all of New Hampshire so...

216
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,664
we decided to pack our bags and head West.

217
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:22,625
To Hollywood.

218
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:26,793
I wanted to be in the movie business and
well... Dick? He wanted to be employed.

219
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:29,571
So we landed a job at Columbia
Pictures driving trucks.

220
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,222
Then after a few years we had enough saved to buy
our own little piece of show business...

221
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:36,706
a beautiful little movie theater in
Glendora, which would have been swell...

222
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:37,707
except for the timing.

223
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,118
- It was September of '29.
- Oh...

224
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:44,636
One minute we're screening the Gold Diggers of Broadway,
the next it's brother can you spare a dime.

225
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,974
- I couldn't.
- Nobody in town was making any money...

226
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:51,280
except for one fella, Wiley Reed,
had a hotdog and rootbeer stand.

227
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:52,850
Hey, people still gotta eat, right?

228
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:56,918
So we decided to open up our own
little stand, Hotdogs and Orange Juice...

229
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,529
in Arcadia, and it went okay.

230
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,183
I mean, we weren't
going gang-busters.

231
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:01,802
There just weren't enough
people in Arcadia.

232
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,452
Meanwhile, one town over is
San Bernardino...

233
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:07,225
and we wanna relocate but we've
got no money for a new stand...

234
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:11,593
and that's when my brother here,
comes up with one of his brilliant ideas...

235
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:12,903
- Tell him Dick.
- Well...

236
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:15,528
He says,
"Why don't we move the stand we've got."

237
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:17,834
- Put it on a truck.
- Genius, right?

238
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:18,942
Only there's one little problem.

239
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:21,488
On the road between the
two towns, there's an overpass...

240
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:23,278
and the building won't clear it.

241
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,995
Now I figure, that's it,
we're done for...

242
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:28,142
but then Dick says,
"Why don't we saw the building in half?"

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:17:30,114
Saw it in half.

244
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:41,047
Come on.

245
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:46,764
So we've moved the restaurant,
we're setting up shop...

246
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:50,329
but now we wanna do a few
a few tweaks because now it's 1940...

247
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,149
and drive-in's are all the rage, I mean
they are the hottest thing going...

248
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:54,821
and I say,
"Dick, we gotta get in on this"...

249
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:56,042
- and Dick says,
- "Okay"...

250
00:17:56,043 --> 00:18:00,301
and 2 months later we open for business,
McDonald's Famous Barbecue.

251
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:04,337
24 item menu, uniformed waitresses
bring your food right to the car...

252
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:07,749
and it goes gang-busters.
We're going great guns!

253
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,539
But then... sales start to level off.

254
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,770
- The drive-in model as we've learned has
a few built in problems.

255
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:14,561
Tell me about it.

256
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:16,569
For starters, there's the customer issue.

257
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,649
Drive-in's tend to attract, shall we say,
a less than desirable clientele.

258
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,715
- Teenagers.
- Hot-rodders and hooligans and...

259
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,853
juvenile deliquents in blue jeans.

260
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,051
And then there's the service.

261
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:29,664
It takes forever and a day for your food to arrive,
and when it finally does...

262
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:30,840
- It's usually wrong.
- Yeah.

263
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:36,098
The car hops are too busy dodging gropes to remember
that you wanted strawberry phospate, not cherry.

264
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:37,717
- Well that's if they remember it at all.
- And then...

265
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:41,407
there's the expenses. The huge payroll
due to the large staff required...

266
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:45,095
- dishes constantly getting broken or stolen.
- Tremendous overhead.

267
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:49,767
So one day Dick has a realization. He sees
that the bulk of our sales are in only 3 items.

268
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:53,233
- Hamburgers, french fries, soft-drinks.
- 87%.

269
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:58,209
So we say to ourselves let's focus on what
sells and that's exactly what we do...

270
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,323
Brisket gone, tamales gone,
but we don't stop there.

271
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:02,948
We look at everything.

272
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:05,271
- What else don't we need?
- Turns out quite a lot.

273
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:08,081
- Car hops.
- Walk up to a window, get your food yourself.

274
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,163
- Dishes.
- All paper packaging, disposable.

275
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:14,242
Cigarette machines, jukeboxes,
drive out the riff raff.

276
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:18,289
- Creating a family friendly environment here.
- But that's not enough.

277
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:18,773
Alright.

278
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:22,030
See, our whole lives we've piggy-backed
off of other people's ideas...

279
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:25,187
We wanted something that wasn't
just different. It had to be better.

280
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:27,752
It needed to be ours.

281
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:30,626
And that's what brings us
to the biggest cut of all.

282
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,777
Which was?

283
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:36,789
- The wait.
- Orders ready in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.

284
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,037
Mecca.

285
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,304
- We look at each other one night...
- You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

286
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,481
We're gonna have to tear down,
rebuild, reconfi... rethink the whole dang thing.

287
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:49,014
We're talking about shutting
down a thriving business for months.

288
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:50,128
People are gonna think we're crazy.

289
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,336
We were, crazy.

290
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,306
And you are gonna love how we did it.
Dick, you gotta tell him.

291
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:59,124
- Tennis court.
- Okay, he brings me out to this tennis court...

292
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,280
and he's drawn this line the
exact dimenions of our kitchen...

293
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,283
Sink on the right, extruder on the left.

294
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:06,004
Bagging and hood.

295
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:07,005
Okay. Garnish... this is uh...

296
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,235
- burger finish.
- Got it.

297
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:11,741
and then this is burger slide.

298
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:14,632
We could just move those.

299
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,866
- Okay.
- Multimixer, soft drinks...

300
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:20,410
We bring out our whole staff and
we have 'em go through the motions...

301
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,579
making pretend burgers and fries.

302
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,763
Alright, Steve, ya gotta
anticipate that...

303
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,612
Ya gotta keep the tray level!

304
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,707
Dick is running around with a stick
marking where all the equipment should be.

305
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:35,722
Tuck in. Tony are you going to skip the
pickles when we're really doing it?

306
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:40,429
They do it over and over, hashing it out,
choreographing it like some crazy burger ballet.

307
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,461
What's going on over there?

308
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:42,513
Yes.

309
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:44,475
No!

310
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,747
NO!

311
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,323
Everybody stop!

312
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:52,183
Garnish #1.
Garnish #2.

313
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,203
You've got pickles, you've got onions.

314
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,193
It's a goddamn hamburger.

315
00:20:57,194 --> 00:20:59,645
- Come on, clear out.
- Let's clear off.

316
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,384
It's time for the pink chalk.

317
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,980
and then rootbeer, orange.

318
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:08,818
See all this open space here now?

319
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:11,825
We've rearrange the fry situation so now...

320
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:12,826
it's stage left, the fryer is stage right.

321
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:16,741
Again...

322
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:17,819
That's great.

323
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,753
Come on guys.

324
00:21:18,754 --> 00:21:22,959
- We're pretty tied up here with the Lazy Susan.
- Yeah, watch it. This is the timing if the Lazy Susan...

325
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,995
Those are finished burgers!
You can't... hold it!

326
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:31,160
I still think there's a 3rd version.

327
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:33,190
- Well, what do you want to move?
- I want to move everything.

328
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,191
To stage left please.

329
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,543
Got it all drawn?

330
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,221
This is better.

331
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:47,026
Is that alright?

332
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,327
This so.

333
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:53,055
- I guess... let's assume our battle stations.
- Okay, okay.

334
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:57,553
Finally...
after about 6 hours of this...

335
00:21:57,554 --> 00:22:02,231
we get it just right. It's a symphony
of efficiency, not a wasted motion.

336
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:15,606
Good form Jasper!

337
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:20,854
Feel good about those pickles.
Ketchup!

338
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:22,762
Use your Lazy Susan.

339
00:22:25,598 --> 00:22:27,751
Put your back into it Seth!

340
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:31,521
And pickles and pickle and...
mustard!

341
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:36,311
We take the layout to a builder,
custom build the kitchen to our exact specs.

342
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:38,940
Ta dah! The speedy system is born.

343
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:43,421
The world's first ever system to deliver
food fast. It is totally revolutionary...

344
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:45,179
- and a complete disaster.
- Why?

345
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:50,129
Opening day, cars pull up onto the lot and they start
honking immediately because no car-hop comes up.

346
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,227
You place your order.

347
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:54,151
We try to explain to them the walk
up window and they are uh...

348
00:22:54,152 --> 00:22:57,921
bewildered? No, furious.
"What do you mean I gotta get out of my car?"

349
00:22:57,922 --> 00:22:59,797
Most of 'em just cuss us
out and drive off...

350
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:03,880
and the few that stay are mad as heck because they are
eating off paper and they've gotta discard their own trash.

351
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:04,474
Why?

352
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:05,863
You're doing great, you're doing great.

353
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:07,833
Yeah, we won't be coming out to
the car but you can just come on up.

354
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,170
Welcome to McDonald's.

355
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:12,197
We may have underestimated the learning curve.

356
00:23:12,198 --> 00:23:13,198
So by 5 o'clock, Dick is calculating how
much it's gonna cost to go back to drive-in...

357
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:17,492
but I am not ready to throw in the towel.

358
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:21,779
So I go back to our old Hollywood days, I
think to myself, we gotta go big with this.

359
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,965
We gotta put on a show.

360
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:25,129
So I say, "Dick, I wanna throw
a grand re-opening...

361
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,460
a gala premeire that would put
Louis B. Mayer to shame.

362
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:29,356
So we rent a bunch of spotlights...

363
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:31,401
the ones we used to haul
around in the Columbia days...

364
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:34,291
we get sparklers, a juggler for the kiddies,
it is an event...

365
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:37,145
people show up in droves,
and then...

366
00:23:37,753 --> 00:23:38,410
The flies.

367
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:40,708
They must have been
drawn by all the lights.

368
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:43,916
Millions of 'em.
It was like a scene out of Exodus.

369
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:46,213
The pharaoh would have
released the Israelites...

370
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:49,446
Total disaster.

371
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:50,447
Now it is 'towel' time.

372
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:54,788
The next day Dick and I meet up to
discuss going back to the old format.

373
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:57,414
And as we're talking there's
a knock at the service window...

374
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,462
I tell him we're closed.

375
00:24:03,463 --> 00:24:04,463
- We're closed.
- but he's looked so cute.

376
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:06,964
Hang on, hang on...

377
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:09,254
- What would you like son?
- Can I buy a bag of burgers from you?

378
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:14,169
And I feel bad so I fire up the
grill and I make him a batch...

379
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:16,976
There you are.

380
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:23,748
And as he's walking away from the
service window, a car pulls up.

381
00:24:28,463 --> 00:24:29,454
And then another.

382
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:33,882
Dick...

383
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:37,095
And then another.

384
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:47,172
Hello, welcome to McDonald's.

385
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:48,210
Hello there.

386
00:24:48,211 --> 00:24:50,180
Pretty soon there's a line around the block.

387
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:52,639
- The word has spread.
- And it's off to the races.

388
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,163
And we are an overnight sensation,
30 years in the making.

389
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,521
So that's our story.

390
00:25:48,552 --> 00:25:49,795
Franchise.

391
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:51,237
- Beg pardon?
- Franchise.

392
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:52,887
Franchise the damn thing.

393
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:54,928
It's too damn good for just one location.

394
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,727
There should be McDonald's everywhere.
Coast to coast, sea to shining sea.

395
00:25:58,728 --> 00:26:02,881
- Mr. Kroc...
- Hey, I got a confession I wanna make to you boys...

396
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:08,757
I'm not out here in California for any kind
of business meetings. I came out here for you.

397
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:14,033
A few days ago I got into St. Louis, Missouri and I
was doing some business and I broke out my map.

398
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:18,734
And I followed my finger on
one single highway, West.

399
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:21,313
- Route 66. And somethin' told me...
- Mr. Kroc...

400
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:25,177
Somethin' told me to get into my car and drive
that highway and you know where it led me?

401
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,720
Right here.
Right smack dab here.

402
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:30,156
Right to this unbelievable establishment...

403
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:34,242
and when I saw these lines to your home
operation and I tasted your product...

404
00:26:34,243 --> 00:26:36,008
I knew what needed to happen.

405
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:39,584
Franchising. Franchise, franchise, franchise.

406
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,413
Franchise.

407
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:45,437
We already tried.

408
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:55,067
5. Three in Southern California,
one in Sacramento and one in Phoenix...

409
00:26:55,068 --> 00:26:57,043
And that's all there will ever be.

410
00:26:57,471 --> 00:26:58,336
Why?

411
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:01,232
Two words:
Quality Control.

412
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:05,135
It's almost impossible to enforce standards from afar.

413
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:08,332
Places were a mess. Filthy
kitchens, inconsistent menus...

414
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,295
Sacramento was selling burritos.

415
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:14,350
To watch your precious creation
be mismanaged like that...

416
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:17,538
- Your name.
- Put Mac in the hospital.

417
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:23,820
- Well, you put somebody in charge of supervising.
- We did.

418
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:25,052
So then, what happened?

419
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:27,616
He obviously didn't do a great job.

420
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:29,747
So you hire somebody else, get somebody better.

421
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,736
Our energies are better spent making
this place the best it can possibly be.

422
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,559
It's better to have one great restaurant
than 50 mediocre ones.

423
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,328
- Yeah, yeah. I still think you hire the right guy...
- Ray, we're not interested.

424
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:44,195
Look, I think you boys are missing
something here that is...

425
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,263
I tell ya, ya gotta...
somethin' here...

426
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:50,019
Wuh... what is that?

427
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,415
- A concept.
- Huh.

428
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,761
What are those?

429
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:57,279
Oh, it's a way to make the place
stand out when you're driving by.

430
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,924
The golden arches, I call 'em.

431
00:28:01,116 --> 00:28:03,087
The golden arches...

432
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:07,352
- Who thought of that?
- Oh that's some pure Dick magic right there.

433
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:11,049
Did ya ever build one like that?

434
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,895
Just one...
Phoenix.

435
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:52,100
Ethel?

436
00:29:52,552 --> 00:29:53,252
In here.

437
00:29:53,678 --> 00:29:58,178
Oh boy. I saw a restaurant.
I've never seen a restaurant like this in my life.

438
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:01,593
They got this fully automated... system.

439
00:30:01,594 --> 00:30:03,966
- It's called the speedy system.
- Mmm hmm.

440
00:30:04,189 --> 00:30:06,647
Which is a good name for
it because man it is speedy.

441
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:12,661
I tell ya, it's like something sprung
from the mind of Henry Ford or something.

442
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:15,528
- It's revolutionary?
- It's revolutionary.

443
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:17,488
That's exactly what it is,
it's revolutionary.

444
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:20,256
- And you wanna invest in it?
- I don't know.

445
00:30:20,257 --> 00:30:23,247
I don't know. I'm not sure yet.
I just know I want to be a part of it.

446
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:27,151
- Boy.
- So here we go.

447
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,021
What do you mean by that?

448
00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:33,970
Wax cups, folding nooks, multimixers.
A new idea to chase.

449
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:36,703
Those things put a roof over our heads.

450
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:37,884
At least over mine.

451
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:40,351
What do you mean over yours?
Over our heads...

452
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:44,198
It's a good roof Ray.
It's a good house.

453
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:46,789
It's a good life if you
weren't too busy to live it.

454
00:30:47,787 --> 00:30:50,428
We could go to the club more than twice a year.

455
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:52,851
Christ, just take a walk around the block together.

456
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:56,467
Isn't time to enjoy a little
and stop chasing your tail?

457
00:30:57,616 --> 00:30:59,507
When's enough gonna be enough for you?

458
00:31:02,016 --> 00:31:04,083
Honestly?

459
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:05,126
Probably never.

460
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:11,602
Why should I settle
when other men won't?

461
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,572
I don't know Ray.

462
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:15,487
Maybe if I had a wife that had an
ounce a vision.

463
00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:17,615
Showed me an ounce of support.

464
00:31:19,102 --> 00:31:20,090
Sorry, wrong word.

465
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:22,290
I've done nothing but support you.

466
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:23,024
Oh look, I'm sorry...

467
00:31:23,025 --> 00:31:28,789
- Ups, downs, dwindling savings, your schemes...
- You're right.

468
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:02,017
Are ya familiar with the concept
of the chicken and the egg Mr. Johnson...

469
00:33:02,018 --> 00:33:03,018
because I think that's applicable here.

470
00:33:54,613 --> 00:33:56,367
Hey Dick...

471
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:01,553
What is it with this guy?

472
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:03,834
- Do it for your country.
- What?

473
00:34:07,552 --> 00:34:10,216
If you boys don't want to
franchise for yourselves, that's fine...

474
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:11,903
Do it for your country.

475
00:34:13,857 --> 00:34:15,094
Do it for America.

476
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,045
Ya know what, I drove through a lot of towns.
A lot of small towns.

477
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:26,328
And they all had two things in common...

478
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:29,088
They had a courthouse and they had a church.

479
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:32,284
On top of the church, got a cross...

480
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:35,087
and on top of the courthouse they have a flag.

481
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,412
Flags, crosses, crosses flags.

482
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:44,740
Driving around I just cannot stop thinking
about this tremendous restaurant.

483
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:47,550
Now at the risk of sounding blasphemous...

484
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:48,955
forgive me.

485
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:52,476
Those arches have a lot in common
with those buildings.

486
00:34:52,992 --> 00:34:56,604
A building with a cross on top, what is that?
It's a gathering place...

487
00:34:56,605 --> 00:35:03,293
where decent wholesome people come together
and they share values protected by that American flag.

488
00:35:03,994 --> 00:35:08,052
It could be said that that beautiful
building flanked by those arches...

489
00:35:09,462 --> 00:35:12,180
signifies more or less the same thing.

490
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:15,478
It doesn't just say,
"Delicious hamburgers inside"...

491
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:22,093
They signify family. It signifies community.
It's a place where Americans come together to break bread.

492
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,576
I am telling you...

493
00:35:25,576 --> 00:35:30,793
McDonald's can be...
the new American church.

494
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:36,576
Feeding bodies and feeding souls
and it ain't just open on Sundays, boys.

495
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:40,009
It's open 7 days a week.

496
00:35:47,742 --> 00:35:50,886
Crosses...
Flags...

497
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,044
Arches.

498
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,725
Give us a minute Ray.

499
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:04,653
Sure.

500
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:09,887
I don't know.

501
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,109
This is your dream.
It's bigger than your dream.

502
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,843
Arches. Your arches...

503
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:17,584
coast to coast.

504
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:21,011
I can't put you through that again.

505
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:23,158
I know how bad you want this...

506
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:25,360
- and you should have it.
- Your diabetes...

507
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:27,655
- Last time...
- We'll do things differently.

508
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:28,635
We'll learn from our mistakes.

509
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:30,653
- How so?
- Keep a tighter leash on everything.

510
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:32,019
Complete oversight.

511
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,043
Every change goes through us.

512
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:35,656
Who says he's gonna listen?

513
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:37,608
We'll make him listen.

514
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:41,333
Draw up a contract.
Clear as day. Black and white.

515
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:03,959
Fine.

516
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:08,472
Fine.

517
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,496
Fine.

518
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:15,788
Fine.

519
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:21,521
Fine.

520
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,817
Let's get to work boys.

521
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:42,165
What's the first step?

522
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,262
Just leave that to me.

523
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:48,814
We are a dynamic fast-growing company and
we're poised to make major in-roads nationally...

524
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:52,374
So in addition to giving us a real strong
foothold right here in the Midwest...

525
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:57,801
to display it's location with service as a
kind of a lure for other franchises if you will.

526
00:37:57,802 --> 00:37:59,243
What are those?

527
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,528
- What are...
- Those.

528
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,748
Lemme see... oh those, yeah...

529
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:12,144
That's just my little way of separating
us from the rest of the pack.

530
00:38:12,973 --> 00:38:16,245
Yah like 'em?
I call 'em The Golden Arches.

531
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,837
You look familiar.
Have we met before?

532
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:21,957
I don't think so... no.
I think I'd remember that.

533
00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:24,887
Peruse the inside of your...
if you don't mind.

534
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,014
Take a look... yeah,
read that.

535
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:28,633
The fold-a-nook.

536
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:31,855
It's like a Murphy bed for your kitchen.

537
00:38:32,165 --> 00:38:32,714
Huh?

538
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:40,040
Take look at the blueprints,
here we are.

539
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:41,991
We had those done locally.

540
00:38:41,992 --> 00:38:43,512
Yeah, I never forget a face.

541
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:52,040
Unique, original, totally innovative...

542
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:55,713
There's nothing like this. Nothing.
In the entire food service sector.

543
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:59,040
Nice brochure,
professionally done.

544
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:02,940
Have we met?

545
00:39:04,537 --> 00:39:06,120
The paper cup guy.

546
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:08,450
Yeah.
That was a long time ago.

547
00:39:09,756 --> 00:39:11,171
That was a long time ago...

548
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:14,012
What do you think?

549
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:15,617
I don't know.

550
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:23,261
There's...
Look...

551
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,921
I'm gonna level with ya, uh...

552
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:32,208
I need this one.

553
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:36,339
Do ya think...
Is there anything you can do to help me out?

554
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,702
I'll tell ya what.
Lemme refer ya to one of my colleagues.

555
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:42,150
Somebody who may be better
suited to meet your needs.

556
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:45,472
Thank you.

557
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:51,974
Ray Kroc...
Address?

558
00:39:52,115 --> 00:39:55,346
143, Juniper Road.

559
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:58,457
Arlington Heights, Illinois.

560
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:01,335
Home telephone number?

561
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:07,034
Ah... use my office telephone number.
That's the place to reach me.

562
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:09,120
Alright.

563
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:13,054
Of course we'll need an appraisal on your
home before we can issue funds.

564
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,299
Be right.

565
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:42,474
Just be right one time.

566
00:40:58,051 --> 00:40:59,289
One time.

567
00:41:01,468 --> 00:41:04,039
- June, did you schedule the stake out with the engineer?
- All set.

568
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,507
What about the fire department?
Did you get the approval for the driveway design?

569
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:08,352
Left a message with them yesterday.

570
00:41:08,353 --> 00:41:11,121
- Excavation permits?
- I'm meeting with them today.

571
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:12,432
All right.

572
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:15,465
Hey, what's going on with
San Bernardino by the way?

573
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:19,330
I just spoke to Dick,
he said they're working on it.

574
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,643
They're working on it...

575
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:23,362
That's what he said.

576
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:26,445
Ray Kroc on the line.

577
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:33,209
- Hi Ray.
- Boy, you boys are killin' me.

578
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,930
What's the old up?
I break ground in 2 weeks.

579
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:39,985
These things take time and
you're proposing substantial alterations.

580
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:42,600
I'm adding a basement and a furnace,
that's all.

581
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:47,242
We need our architect to thoroughly review it
and make sure everything is safe and up to code.

582
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:49,928
Fine, has he seen it yet?
Has he taken a look at it?

583
00:41:50,322 --> 00:41:51,601
I'm not sure to be honest.

584
00:41:51,602 --> 00:41:54,678
I've got bulldozers rolling up
on the 23rd.

585
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,221
I'm not the one who scheduled that.

586
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,627
Ray, I need you to take a breath.

587
00:41:58,628 --> 00:42:01,989
Take a breath...
Do you realize what it's going to cost me if I have to push?

588
00:42:02,697 --> 00:42:04,057
Hopefully it won't come to that.

589
00:42:04,058 --> 00:42:07,805
Every restaurant in the Midwest has a basement
and a furnance.

590
00:42:07,806 --> 00:42:08,805
This is standard stuff.

591
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:11,203
I understand, but it's our
name on that building.

592
00:42:11,582 --> 00:42:17,370
God forbid the floor caves in and people get hurt,
or worse, because of some design flaw we missed.

593
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:20,379
Let's just slow down a minute
and make sure it's done right.

594
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,025
So much for the speedy system, huh?

595
00:42:27,694 --> 00:42:29,849
- Did he just hang up on you?
- Yes.

596
00:42:30,596 --> 00:42:32,868
Unless we got violently disconnected.

597
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:33,879
Okay...

598
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:37,513
He'll be fine.

599
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:43,335
Where's the front of the uh... show me.

600
00:42:44,926 --> 00:42:45,417
Alright.

601
00:42:45,418 --> 00:42:49,526
Just make sure the windows are big enough so that the
customer can look in to the restaurant, all the way to the kitchen.

602
00:42:49,786 --> 00:42:51,339
Doesn't look right.
Let's see this...

603
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:51,975
- Ray?
- What?

604
00:42:51,976 --> 00:42:53,722
We got a letter from San Bernardino.

605
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,352
Read it to me.

606
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:01,040
Dear Ray, thank you for your letter sharing your
idea to strike a deal with Coca-Cola...

607
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:04,533
to sponsor menu boards at
the new Des Plaines location.

608
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:06,942
An intriguing notion indeed.

609
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:09,133
As you rightly point out...

610
00:43:09,134 --> 00:43:14,033
such an arrangement would provide a steady source
of revenue to the store at no additional labor cost.

611
00:43:14,816 --> 00:43:16,269
- However...
- However?

612
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:17,371
However what?

613
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:23,796
However this goes beyond our core beliefs.
McDonald's was founded with the idea...

614
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:27,801
- of families and not strict commerce.
- Son of a bitch.

615
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:30,552
- They dunno what they're talkin' about.
- And so on and so on...

616
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:34,400
There ya go gentlemen.

617
00:43:34,608 --> 00:43:35,579
Back to work.

618
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,418
Lemme explain.

619
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:39,645
Be real small, right across the bottom.
Very discreet.

620
00:43:39,646 --> 00:43:43,906
We're just not comfortable with the notion
of turning our menu into an advertisement.

621
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:46,538
See, it's not an ad,
it's sponsorship.

622
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:47,746
It's distasteful.

623
00:43:47,747 --> 00:43:48,751
It's free money!

624
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:52,361
There are plenty of things we could do to
make a quick buck. That doesn't mean we should.

625
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:54,277
- Loads of restaurants do this.
- Well we don't.

626
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:54,869
Why not?

627
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,821
Because I have no interest in indulging
in that sort of crass commercialism.

628
00:43:58,822 --> 00:44:00,020
It's not McDonald's.

629
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:02,338
I didn't realize I was parterning
with a beatnik.

630
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,910
I'll have you know I'm a card
carrying Republican!

631
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:06,309
Yeah, well you coulda fooled me.

632
00:44:07,513 --> 00:44:08,953
He hung up again.

633
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:12,337
Well he's just a little excitable,
that's all.

634
00:44:15,939 --> 00:44:19,061
A hothead like that,
you don't know what he's capable of.

635
00:44:19,062 --> 00:44:22,280
It's all bluster Dick.
His bark is worse than his bite.

636
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:25,722
- That's what Neville Chamberlain said.
- He'll relax...

637
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:26,969
Give him some time.

638
00:44:34,394 --> 00:44:36,912
What are doin', come on!
There's time to lean, there's time to clean.

639
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:37,720
Let's go.

640
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,247
Put that hat on straight.

641
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,859
400 degrees, right?
That a boy, way to work.

642
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:48,964
Nice.

643
00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:52,713
Hey, there's one pickle on there.
2 pickles on all the buns.

644
00:44:52,714 --> 00:44:53,899
2 pickles on all of 'em.

645
00:44:54,268 --> 00:44:56,080
Don't... don't.
Look watch.

646
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:58,509
Flip 'em like that. Really turn 'em over and
then press 'em one time.

647
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,509
And that one's too pink.

648
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:00,535
There, all right?

649
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:07,986
Wait... and you...
get these...

650
00:45:09,622 --> 00:45:10,994
Pretty damn good.

651
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:12,807
- What's your name?
- Fred Turner sir.

652
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:15,374
Nice work.

653
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,275
Fred Turner.

654
00:45:16,903 --> 00:45:17,764
Fred Turner.

655
00:46:03,647 --> 00:46:04,751
I'm sorry.

656
00:46:05,886 --> 00:46:08,248
I know I've been neglecting you.

657
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:20,941
What do you say tomorrow...
we go to supper at the club?

658
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,821
Really?

659
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:30,214
Really.

660
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:36,098
Well look what the cat dragged in.

661
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:38,398
Hey everybody.
Hi there. Hey.

662
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:39,399
- How are ya?
- Good evening stranger.

663
00:46:42,946 --> 00:46:45,644
This is on the left side of the 14th fairway.

664
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:47,553
- And I use a 3 wood.
- Hmm.

665
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,581
- Hit it clean.
- I hear Acapulco is divine.

666
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:51,957
Where do you like Ethel?

667
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:54,433
Um... Spain.

668
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:55,608
Spain?

669
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:57,555
Wonderful. How was it?

670
00:46:57,918 --> 00:47:01,668
- Oh no, I mean I'm thinkin' about it.
- Oh you haven't been.

671
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:03,860
Well we're dreaming up a trip.

672
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:04,848
Right?

673
00:47:06,397 --> 00:47:07,775
- Great.
- Yeah.

674
00:47:10,817 --> 00:47:12,902
- How's your game Ray?
- Lately?

675
00:47:13,955 --> 00:47:14,803
Non-existent.

676
00:47:14,804 --> 00:47:21,501
- I know, been holdin' myself.
- No kidding.

677
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,805
Ha ha, yeah.
I did hit a hole in one of a sort recently though.

678
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:27,099
I came across a really, really
interesting business opportunity.

679
00:47:27,492 --> 00:47:28,514
Really interesting.

680
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,316
You boys are gonna want a piece of this.

681
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:32,635
- Here we go again.
- What is it this time Ray?

682
00:47:32,636 --> 00:47:33,637
Restaurant.

683
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,839
- New kind of restaurant.
- New how?

684
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:39,683
Restaurant filled with milkshakes and fold-a-nooks?

685
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:44,647
Fold-a-nook...

686
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,694
I'm just jokin' with ya Ray.

687
00:47:49,695 --> 00:47:51,085
Hold on Jack.

688
00:47:51,086 --> 00:47:52,249
You should hear him out.

689
00:47:53,797 --> 00:47:55,248
This one's different.

690
00:47:59,994 --> 00:48:02,424
Well... do tell us more.

691
00:48:03,586 --> 00:48:04,514
I will.

692
00:48:05,301 --> 00:48:06,851
This is a thing of beauty.

693
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,910
Fully automated kitchen, the likes
of which I've never seen...

694
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:11,850
It's revolutionary.

695
00:48:12,394 --> 00:48:13,215
It's called the speedy system.

696
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:15,477
The thing I like about this is it's franchiseable.

697
00:48:15,502 --> 00:48:17,834
The first one's already up and running.
Come over and take a look.

698
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:19,695
It might make you boys a few dollars.

699
00:48:24,495 --> 00:48:25,483
You don't have to worry about a thing...

700
00:48:25,484 --> 00:48:26,887
we're in charge of everything...

701
00:48:26,888 --> 00:48:29,623
and all these franchises look exactly the same.

702
00:48:29,764 --> 00:48:34,149
I'd have never thought it would work,
...(inaudible)...

703
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,448
Easy as pie. You just pay the
franchise fee, we take care of everything else.

704
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:44,229
Close enough!
Pick it up troop.

705
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,650
Alright, let's do this.

706
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:52,001
Got her? Ok.
Gonna be real happy here.

707
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:57,721
- Congratulations.
- Right.

708
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:07,551
3 new franchises in the last month.

709
00:49:08,121 --> 00:49:09,073
Well that's great.

710
00:49:10,396 --> 00:49:10,946
What?

711
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:12,594
I don't know...

712
00:49:13,773 --> 00:49:14,446
What?

713
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:18,814
Don't you think maybe given our experience
that this is all happening a little too quickly?

714
00:49:19,944 --> 00:49:23,613
If they all pop up at once,
how's he gonna maintain standards?

715
00:50:18,235 --> 00:50:19,695
Son of a bitch.

716
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,036
Give it a whack, Jack.

717
00:50:27,216 --> 00:50:28,035
Hey!

718
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:29,528
- What's goin' on here?
- Look at this.

719
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:30,756
What is this? Huh?

720
00:50:31,322 --> 00:50:33,426
- What is that?
- It appears to be a hamburger.

721
00:50:33,427 --> 00:50:34,527
Not a McDonald's burger it's not.

722
00:50:34,528 --> 00:50:35,592
Look at all that ketchup.

723
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:37,364
And you got 3 pickles on
there instead of 2...

724
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:39,500
and look at that... lettuce.

725
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,737
- Really Jack, lettuce...
- Can we talk about this another time?

726
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:44,885
Look at this paddy itself.
It is tragically over-cooked.

727
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:46,970
- Tragically.
- I don't know Ray, it looks good to me.

728
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:48,391
What the hell do you know about quality?

729
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:50,871
- I was by your restaurant today too.
- Yeah? What about it?

730
00:50:50,872 --> 00:50:54,522
- Yah got corn on the cob, yah got fried chicken...
- People love fried chicken!

731
00:50:54,523 --> 00:50:57,511
Do they? Well let them go
somewhere where they serve fried chicken.

732
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,967
And your kitchen is filthy.
What the hell's the matter with you guys?

733
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:04,954
- I don't know about you Ray, but I'm retired.
- You said this was a good place for us to park our money.

734
00:51:04,955 --> 00:51:05,855
It's an investment.

735
00:51:05,856 --> 00:51:08,218
If I'd have wanted a job I would have
applied for a cook position.

736
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:10,430
You couldn't get a job as a cook
in one of my restaurants.

737
00:51:11,103 --> 00:51:11,883
Hey!

738
00:51:12,373 --> 00:51:13,407
What's his problem?

739
00:51:13,408 --> 00:51:15,627
He's a pain in the ass is what he is.

740
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:17,524
Right back at ya Ray!

741
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:18,422
Ethel?

742
00:51:18,716 --> 00:51:19,600
In here.

743
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:21,251
- Hi!
- Ray...

744
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:23,427
Hurry and get changed.
Dinner's called for 7:00.

745
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,399
Yeah, we're not goin' to the club tonight.

746
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,253
Wait, you cancelled our dinner?

747
00:51:30,808 --> 00:51:32,268
I... cancelled our membership.

748
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:33,278
What?

749
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:36,469
With all them ??? people.
They're not really our kind.

750
00:51:37,183 --> 00:51:38,784
What are you talking about?

751
00:51:38,785 --> 00:51:42,610
I've lost interest in hobnobbing
with the idle rich.

752
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:44,335
The idle rich.

753
00:51:44,336 --> 00:51:49,892
You know, their golf, and their Rob Roy's.
They're so complacent and content.

754
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:53,472
Ray... please tell me you're joking.

755
00:51:53,473 --> 00:51:54,982
These are our friends.

756
00:51:54,983 --> 00:51:56,382
No, I know, I know.

757
00:51:56,383 --> 00:52:00,648
You know what? You and I?
We can make a lot of new friends.

758
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:02,649
It's alright. Make new friends.

759
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:07,302
Friends that are more suitable for us.
You know?

760
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,546
Don't ya think?

761
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:12,447
You know what? Gimme one second?

762
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:13,933
Garage is driving me crazy.

763
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:16,273
Can I just go sweep it out
and clean it up and then...

764
00:52:16,274 --> 00:52:17,274
put a nice dress, I'll take
ya out for something to eat.

765
00:52:54,356 --> 00:52:57,769
Just take a gander at this
handsome, gold inlay.

766
00:52:57,905 --> 00:53:01,352
You telling me such spectacular
craftsmanship isn't worth $8.95?

767
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:02,657
But I'm not interested.

768
00:53:03,271 --> 00:53:07,089
Not interested in the bible, sure to be
the pride of your family's home library?

769
00:53:08,091 --> 00:53:11,972
As you no doubt know June,
envy is one of the 7 deadly sins.

770
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:17,530
And that is just what your friends are going to be guilty of
when they see this leather-bound beauty on your bookshelf.

771
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:19,326
Sir, this is a private place of business.

772
00:53:19,994 --> 00:53:21,676
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask ya to leave.

773
00:53:23,713 --> 00:53:24,909
Thank you for your time.

774
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,020
Prince Castle sales...
Oh, hold on.

775
00:53:30,021 --> 00:53:31,405
Ray, it's Mac.

776
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:32,901
Do you wanna take this?

777
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,196
Uh, yeah.
Tell him I'll call him back.

778
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:39,025
Hey, hey. Wait a minute.

779
00:53:40,394 --> 00:53:43,490
- What's your name?
- Leonard. Leonard Rosenblat.

780
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:45,727
Rosenblat?

781
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:46,710
Really?

782
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,034
What's a Jew doin' sellin' Catholic bibles?

783
00:53:50,496 --> 00:53:51,911
Makin' a living.

784
00:53:59,643 --> 00:54:00,801
I believe in you.

785
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,643
Got that pickle in?
These are ready to spin, smooth.

786
00:54:34,986 --> 00:54:37,936
No salt for 30 seconds.
Okay... Lookin' good fellas!

787
00:54:37,937 --> 00:54:39,822
Lookin' good. Big smiles.

788
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:41,794
Ya got time to lean ya got time to clean.

789
00:54:46,827 --> 00:54:50,569
It's normally 10 and under, but
for you I'll make an exception.

790
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,662
Hah hah. Love it!

791
00:54:54,663 --> 00:54:55,711
Nice.

792
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:01,490
My new franchisees are great.

793
00:55:01,491 --> 00:55:03,211
He's in the back workin' in the kitchen...

794
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:06,143
and she's out front handing
suckers out to the little kids.

795
00:55:06,528 --> 00:55:08,803
Husband and wife, side by side.

796
00:55:10,584 --> 00:55:11,875
Like a real team.

797
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:16,869
This is really something to see.

798
00:55:17,977 --> 00:55:19,658
It's wonderful.
Don't you think Ethel?

799
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:22,417
- I suppose it is, yeah.
- Yeah.

800
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:25,013
Like teammates.

801
00:55:32,514 --> 00:55:34,921
I made supper plans for us Friday.

802
00:55:37,564 --> 00:55:39,437
Guess you didn't rejoin Rolling Green.

803
00:55:40,101 --> 00:55:41,955
Well, no, no.

804
00:55:41,956 --> 00:55:43,169
Some place far better.

805
00:55:55,947 --> 00:55:57,769
B-5

806
00:55:58,479 --> 00:55:59,789
So salty.

807
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:02,340
He loves salt.

808
00:56:06,782 --> 00:56:08,108
So what do you, Art?

809
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,780
Had a little plumbing business going for
a while after getting out of the service.

810
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:14,798
Now I sell vacuum cleaners and
give piano lessons on the side.

811
00:56:15,016 --> 00:56:18,253
Wow, busy guy.
Good for you.

812
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:22,095
Vacuums, plumbing, piano less...
You're a Jack Of All Trades.

813
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,717
Yeah, whatever puts food on the table, right?

814
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:26,317
You must be so proud.

815
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:31,045
How'd ya like to do more than
put a little food on the table?

816
00:56:33,534 --> 00:56:34,456
She's excited.

817
00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:37,330
What'd you have in mind?

818
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,630
Burger up.

819
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,414
I'm gonna give ya 3 words...

820
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:02,981
I want ya to take those 3 words home with ya tonight.

821
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:06,730
McDonald's... is... family.

822
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:11,334
Isn't that great?

823
00:57:12,816 --> 00:57:16,431
You know what I see when I see that?
Family.

824
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,279
We're one big family.

825
00:57:19,697 --> 00:57:20,370
Aren't we?

826
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:22,680
We have mouthes to feed.

827
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:24,683
That's a family.

828
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,018
I'm looking for a few good men...

829
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,122
and women. Who aren't
afraid of hard work.

830
00:57:33,123 --> 00:57:34,450
Aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves.

831
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:38,718
I'm looking for scrappers, hustlers,
guys that are willing to roll up their sleeves.

832
00:57:38,753 --> 00:57:41,272
They're livin' on drive,
they got a little fire in their belly.

833
00:57:42,245 --> 00:57:46,743
I stand right here before you today,
I'm gonna offer you something as precious as gold.

834
00:57:46,744 --> 00:57:47,650
And you know what that is?

835
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:48,699
Anybody?

836
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,456
Anybody?

837
00:57:49,457 --> 00:57:51,282
Opportunity.
It's opportunity.

838
00:57:51,283 --> 00:57:52,273
Opportunity.

839
00:57:52,274 --> 00:57:56,026
Opportunity to advance, to move forward,
to move up, to advance...

840
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:57,535
To succeed.

841
00:57:57,536 --> 00:58:00,395
To win. To step up.
The sky's the limit.

842
00:58:00,396 --> 00:58:01,570
The sky is the limit.

843
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:04,404
Grab the brass ring.
To give yourself a shot at the American dream.

844
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:05,884
Put your arms around the American dream.

845
00:58:05,885 --> 00:58:06,733
Opportunity.

846
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:07,251
Cause I'll tell ya somethin...

847
00:58:07,252 --> 00:58:10,310
At McDonald's? It's like this
great nation of ours...

848
00:58:10,411 --> 00:58:11,424
Some of that elbow grease.

849
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:12,838
I guarantee ya,
if you got the guts...

850
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:13,839
the gumption, the desire...

851
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,019
I guarantee ya you can succeed.

852
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,020
There's gold to be had. At the end of...
those Golden Arches...

853
00:58:19,021 --> 00:58:21,110
Golden Arches.
Golden Arches.

854
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:24,978
Now who's with me?
Who wants to jump on that ladder to success?

855
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:28,023
Be part of the McDonald's "mishpokhe".
Now who's with me?

856
00:58:28,057 --> 00:58:29,574
Come on, lemme see some hands.

857
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:32,091
There ya go.

858
00:58:32,497 --> 00:58:33,755
Who else?

859
00:58:50,253 --> 00:58:51,371
McDonald's.

860
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:56,109
It's good, Art.

861
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,396
Good job.

862
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:58,668
Thank you sir.

863
00:59:06,482 --> 00:59:08,385
The nerve of this guy.

864
00:59:08,839 --> 00:59:09,611
What?

865
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,193
Guess what he's calling his display in store?

866
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:14,889
McDonald's #1.

867
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:21,794
What are we then?

868
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:25,089
Could his head get any bigger?

869
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:34,585
Ladies and gentlemen we are about to begin
our initial decent into Minneapolis/St. Paul.

870
00:59:50,948 --> 00:59:53,987
Mr. Kroc! Welcome to Minneapolis.
Wonderful to see ya!

871
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:58,070
Gimme an "M"!
Gimme a "C"!

872
01:00:35,274 --> 01:00:38,222
- Ray, how is it?
- You can't even top that in Chicago.

873
01:00:38,533 --> 01:00:39,969
Well, we don't mess around up here.

874
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,462
Boy, my compliments to the chef,
that's wonderful.

875
01:00:42,463 --> 01:00:43,757
I can do ya one better.

876
01:00:43,758 --> 01:00:45,865
- How about the owner?
- Sure, why in the hell not.

877
01:00:45,866 --> 01:00:48,657
Rollie... Rolly.

878
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:53,187
- Jimmy, great to see ya.
- Rollie, how are ya?

879
01:00:53,188 --> 01:00:54,824
Ah, wonderful.

880
01:00:54,856 --> 01:00:57,590
- Rollie Smith, Ray Kroc.
- A real pleasure.

881
01:00:57,591 --> 01:00:59,691
Oh boy, I tell ya,
you got a hell of a restaurant here.

882
01:00:59,692 --> 01:01:01,374
Well comin' from you that's quite a compliment.

883
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:03,056
My reputation proceeds me.

884
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,177
- I'm a great admirer.
- Well uh... sit down.

885
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,914
- Well I don't wanna interrupt.
- Have a seat.

886
01:01:09,695 --> 01:01:10,912
Well maybe just a minute.

887
01:01:11,954 --> 01:01:13,923
- This is Fred Turner, my associate.
- Welcome.

888
01:01:14,878 --> 01:01:15,779
Steaks cooked okay?

889
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,618
Excellent, perfect.

890
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:20,190
Well our intention is to expand
pretty far beyond the Midwest...

891
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:22,508
We're not gonna settle here.
We're not gonna...

892
01:01:23,634 --> 01:01:26,191
We're gonna expand far beyond the Midwest...

893
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:29,318
Well you've clearly got a warm
and loving home here in Minneapolis.

894
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:31,001
Yeah, so it seems.

895
01:01:31,678 --> 01:01:34,354
Yeah, this town just can't
get enough of McDonald's.

896
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:36,868
- There ya go sir.
- Another Canadian Club for my friend.

897
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:38,167
- Yes sir, comin' right up.
- Thank you.

898
01:01:38,168 --> 01:01:41,636
In fact, I'd say there's sufficient
enthusiam to support another.

899
01:01:43,144 --> 01:01:44,340
Second location.

900
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:46,750
You know come to think of it, I know
the perfect person to own and operate it.

901
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:47,943
Ya don't say.

902
01:01:47,944 --> 01:01:50,348
Somebody who knows what it
takes to build a great restaurant.

903
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:53,491
Someone with more than 20 years
in the food service industry.

904
01:01:53,906 --> 01:01:54,770
Who?

905
01:01:55,456 --> 01:01:57,452
- Me.
- You?

906
01:01:58,353 --> 01:01:59,418
Oh!

907
01:01:59,573 --> 01:02:00,696
That's a shock.

908
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:05,857
I've got the know how, I've got the backers,
and I've got the perfect location.

909
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:08,065
Are you familiar with Hennipen Avenue?

910
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:12,808
It's one of the busiest commerical
arteries in the whole Twin Cities.

911
01:02:12,943 --> 01:02:17,839
There's a prime site that's recently become
available, a full acre on the corner of Hennipen and...

912
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,261
- Mr. Kroc.
- Yeah.

913
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,308
Would ya like to meet her?

914
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,139
Yeah... sure.

915
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:37,696
So Ray, how long are you here
with us for in the Twin Cities?

916
01:02:37,697 --> 01:02:39,923
- Huh?
- How long are you in town?

917
01:02:41,276 --> 01:02:42,164
Not sure yet.

918
01:02:42,165 --> 01:02:44,224
- If you gentlemen can steal a second I would love to...
- Sure.

919
01:02:44,225 --> 01:02:46,756
personally give you a tour
of this site on Hennepin that...

920
01:02:46,757 --> 01:02:48,925
that Rollie is talking about.
He knows how to pick 'em.

921
01:02:48,926 --> 01:02:51,450
I mean this place...
There's enough room for the restaurant...

922
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:54,457
the parking, possibly a playground
for the little ones.

923
01:02:55,009 --> 01:02:57,117
Ray Kroc, meet Joan Smith...

924
01:02:57,984 --> 01:02:59,222
my wife.

925
01:03:00,866 --> 01:03:01,998
Pleasure to meet you.

926
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:03,318
Pleasure to meet you.

927
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:05,276
Well join us.
Have a drink with us.

928
01:03:05,277 --> 01:03:06,364
I'd love that.

929
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,651
- How are you guys?
- Good.

930
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,256
This is Fred Turner, he's a...

931
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:16,136
We did Madison, Milwaukee, Kinosha...

932
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:20,431
Grand Rapids, uh...
we've got the 3 in Chicago area.

933
01:03:20,432 --> 01:03:22,560
Oh, Jim's here in Minneapolis.

934
01:03:22,561 --> 01:03:23,283
St. Paul.

935
01:03:23,284 --> 01:03:25,353
And uh, got one in Dayton, Ohio.

936
01:03:25,354 --> 01:03:26,338
That's right.

937
01:03:26,606 --> 01:03:30,889
You must be positively dizzy Mr. Kroc.

938
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,799
Please, call me Ray.

939
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,307
Ray.

940
01:03:34,391 --> 01:03:36,166
That's some growth.

941
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:37,298
Yeah.

942
01:03:37,299 --> 01:03:39,269
- We're doin' good, right Fred?
- Yes sir.

943
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:40,453
Yeah we're doin' good.

944
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:43,118
When did you start it?

945
01:03:44,848 --> 01:03:46,555
Uh, hmm? Sorry?

946
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:47,925
What year did you start McDonald's?

947
01:03:49,765 --> 01:03:51,049
The year?

948
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:54,046
I started it in 1954.

949
01:03:57,294 --> 01:03:58,325
Remarkable.

950
01:03:58,326 --> 01:03:59,472
Yup.

951
01:04:02,304 --> 01:04:03,755
Well, I should get back.

952
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:04,628
Back?

953
01:04:05,187 --> 01:04:06,106
Yeah, to my piano.

954
01:04:06,107 --> 01:04:06,985
Oh, of course.

955
01:04:09,857 --> 01:04:10,853
What's your favorite song?

956
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:12,596
All-time favorite.

957
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:14,416
Pennies From Heaven.

958
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,708
Pennies From Heaven.

959
01:04:19,069 --> 01:04:20,655
- Great gal.
- Yup.

960
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,659
I sold pianos for a while.

961
01:04:40,608 --> 01:04:43,295
Every time it rains...

962
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:47,665
it rains... pennies from heaven.

963
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:55,301
Don't you know each cloud contains...

964
01:04:55,302 --> 01:04:58,353
pennies from heaven.

965
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:05,941
You'll find your fortune fallin'...

966
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:09,631
all over town.

967
01:05:09,632 --> 01:05:10,367
Sounds pretty good.

968
01:05:12,277 --> 01:05:18,937
Be sure that your umbrella,
is upside down.

969
01:05:20,455 --> 01:05:25,058
Trade them for a package of...

970
01:05:25,933 --> 01:05:28,993
sunshine and flowers.

971
01:05:30,545 --> 01:05:34,670
If you want the things you love...

972
01:05:34,671 --> 01:05:38,647
you must have showers.

973
01:05:40,042 --> 01:05:44,395
So when you hear it thunder...

974
01:05:45,303 --> 01:05:47,916
don't run under a tree.

975
01:05:47,917 --> 01:05:54,829
There will be pennies from
heaven for you and me.

976
01:06:24,854 --> 01:06:26,804
- Ray?
- Down here.

977
01:06:29,366 --> 01:06:32,030
Uh, I think I've got some people for you.

978
01:06:32,112 --> 01:06:33,891
I met this young couple...

979
01:06:34,684 --> 01:06:36,510
very committed.
They're from Glenview.

980
01:06:36,511 --> 01:06:38,984
High school sweethearts.
Married for 5 years.

981
01:06:38,985 --> 01:06:41,330
- And they're looking for a business they can operate together.
- Uh huh, uh huh.

982
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:44,727
- And they seem very excited.
- Yeah, forget that. Everything's changed.

983
01:06:45,819 --> 01:06:46,448
Ya want a drink?

984
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:47,799
No, changed how?

985
01:06:49,063 --> 01:06:51,631
Forget the Chicago suburbs, think bigger.

986
01:06:52,347 --> 01:06:54,560
- Bigger...
- I'm not chasing them anymore.

987
01:06:54,855 --> 01:06:56,294
They're chasing me now.

988
01:06:57,296 --> 01:07:01,835
The trip.
How was it?

989
01:07:01,836 --> 01:07:02,868
Triumphant.

990
01:07:03,746 --> 01:07:06,929
They were rolling out the red carpet.
And kissing this ring.

991
01:07:07,385 --> 01:07:09,433
They're begging me for McDonald's now.

992
01:07:09,434 --> 01:07:11,115
Here, have a drink.

993
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:16,464
- That's nice.
- Yeah, sure is.

994
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:19,490
I'm sure.

995
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:27,383
Well, then, all hail...
Pope Raymond I.

996
01:07:30,243 --> 01:07:31,062
Damn right.

997
01:07:33,868 --> 01:07:35,195
Goddamn right.

998
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,300
- Ray?
- Yeah.

999
01:07:41,799 --> 01:07:43,429
We have a small problem.

1000
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:46,816
Wait a minute...
How can we be almost out of capital?

1001
01:07:46,817 --> 01:07:49,884
Well, your revenue, the
monthly cut of the store's...

1002
01:07:49,753 --> 01:07:51,348
1.4% of debt.

1003
01:07:51,672 --> 01:07:52,700
- 1.4?
- Yeah.

1004
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:55,765
1.9 minus Dick and Mac's half percent.

1005
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:00,815
Mr. McDonald, Ray Kroc's on the line.

1006
01:08:04,244 --> 01:08:05,049
Good to see you.

1007
01:08:08,925 --> 01:08:10,899
- Hi Ray.
- I wanna renegotiate.

1008
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,130
Renegotiate what?

1009
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:13,636
My deal.
My lousy deal.

1010
01:08:13,637 --> 01:08:17,680
1.4 doesn't cover my monthly nut
let alone drive expansion.

1011
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:19,636
- Ray, those are the terms.
- It's not good enough.

1012
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:22,638
- It's almost triple our cut.
- Well, you should be getting more too then.

1013
01:08:22,639 --> 01:08:23,408
Shouldn't ya.

1014
01:08:23,409 --> 01:08:24,465
We're not greedy men.

1015
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:25,572
Greed has nothing to do with it.

1016
01:08:25,573 --> 01:08:28,957
If I had more money to work with
I could be growing this thing at twice the pace.

1017
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:31,116
- We have no beef with the current rate of expansion.
- I have nothing.

1018
01:08:31,117 --> 01:08:32,632
Not one location in Pennsylvania.

1019
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:33,857
Nothing in New York.

1020
01:08:33,858 --> 01:08:36,628
- All in good time.
- Nothing in Texas.

1021
01:08:35,809 --> 01:08:36,679
I have no doubt it'll come.

1022
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,068
Ya know, I'm out here breaking
my neck for you guys...

1023
01:08:39,069 --> 01:08:40,493
And you're doing a bang up job.

1024
01:08:40,494 --> 01:08:42,908
Well then I should be doing a hell of
a lot better than just breaking even.

1025
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:45,341
- I don't know what to say.
- Say you'll renegotiate.

1026
01:08:45,342 --> 01:08:46,536
- I can't.
- Can't or won't?

1027
01:08:46,537 --> 01:08:49,566
Upping your cut, it would be unfair
to the franchisees.

1028
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:53,725
The franchisees are doing just fine,
I'm the one that's drowning here.

1029
01:08:53,726 --> 01:08:57,003
You freely and willingly agreed
to the terms of your deal, Ray.

1030
01:08:57,004 --> 01:08:58,652
Nobody put a gun to your head.

1031
01:08:59,646 --> 01:09:00,526
- 4%
- No.

1032
01:09:01,192 --> 01:09:03,400
- 3 1/2%
- Ray...

1033
01:09:03,401 --> 01:09:04,253
- What?
- No.

1034
01:09:04,254 --> 01:09:05,379
Goddamn it!

1035
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:14,263
Dick...

1036
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,202
Is he a pain in the rear?
Yes.

1037
01:09:16,203 --> 01:09:18,007
Does he have a few screws loose,
you bet...

1038
01:09:18,008 --> 01:09:19,842
but that doesn't mean he's
gonna do us any harm.

1039
01:09:19,843 --> 01:09:22,070
- How long are you gonna keep this up Mac?
- Keep up what?

1040
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:23,838
The whole, Everything Is Fine act.

1041
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,466
There's a wolf in the hen house.
We let him in.

1042
01:09:26,888 --> 01:09:28,452
I never should have listened.

1043
01:09:28,453 --> 01:09:30,670
We have a contract for just
this sort of thing, Dick.

1044
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:31,919
Should have trusted my gut.

1045
01:09:33,563 --> 01:09:34,972
So it's my fault, huh?

1046
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:37,901
Just like the movie theater.

1047
01:09:37,902 --> 01:09:40,413
Well I'm sorry.
I wanted you to have your dream.

1048
01:10:01,188 --> 01:10:03,003
$94.00

1049
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:08,797
It's unbelievable what these suckers cost to run.

1050
01:10:10,475 --> 01:10:12,796
You know my Pop used
to own an ice cream parlor?

1051
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,513
He went belly up from
the refridgeration costs.

1052
01:10:16,075 --> 01:10:17,155
Really?

1053
01:10:32,341 --> 01:10:33,865
A man called today.

1054
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,591
Illinois First Federal.

1055
01:10:46,772 --> 01:10:48,236
Did he say what he wanted?

1056
01:10:48,237 --> 01:10:49,394
Why don't you tell me.

1057
01:10:49,395 --> 01:10:50,259
What did he want?

1058
01:10:52,891 --> 01:10:53,612
Ray...

1059
01:10:53,775 --> 01:10:54,537
What?

1060
01:10:57,864 --> 01:10:59,972
Did you mortgage our home?

1061
01:11:02,616 --> 01:11:04,452
We could lose everything.

1062
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:35,388
I specifically said the office
is the best place to reach me.

1063
01:11:35,474 --> 01:11:38,000
I tried you there Mr. Kroc,
numerous times.

1064
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:40,214
You have no right to call me at my home.

1065
01:11:40,579 --> 01:11:44,390
- That's a blatant invasion of my privacy.
- With all due respect sir, when you're...

1066
01:11:44,391 --> 01:11:48,532
3 months behind on your payments you don't
get to pick and choose where we contact you.

1067
01:12:56,252 --> 01:12:58,815
- Ray.
- Surprise inspection.

1068
01:13:00,236 --> 01:13:01,251
What are you doing here?

1069
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:06,095
I just came up to see how thing's are goin'.

1070
01:13:10,503 --> 01:13:12,649
$12,400.00

1071
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:15,028
That's a pretty good haul for month #1.
Could be bigger.

1072
01:13:15,551 --> 01:13:18,372
- I hate to mix business with pleasure...
- I don't.

1073
01:13:19,392 --> 01:13:21,623
but, my expenses.

1074
01:13:21,624 --> 01:13:22,025
What about 'em?

1075
01:13:22,026 --> 01:13:24,255
Well they're a bit higher than I anticipated.

1076
01:13:24,256 --> 01:13:25,824
One thing in particular...

1077
01:13:25,825 --> 01:13:29,252
the walk-in. That bill
is a real whopper.

1078
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:32,143
I don't know, it's a problem,
all that ice cream...

1079
01:13:33,038 --> 01:13:36,717
I don't wanna over step my bounds here,
but I may have found a solution.

1080
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,629
Well Joan did, actually.

1081
01:13:41,148 --> 01:13:42,493
Ya don't say.

1082
01:13:43,504 --> 01:13:47,562
What if I told you there was a way,
all of your owner operators could save...

1083
01:13:47,563 --> 01:13:50,165
literally hundreds of dollars
a year in electrical costs...

1084
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:54,181
and reduce the time that it
takes to make a milkshake, by half.

1085
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,282
I'll bite.

1086
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:08,683
It's a powdered milkshake.

1087
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,900
Costs a fraction of ice cream and
there's no refridgeration necessary.

1088
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:15,712
It contains powdered milk.

1089
01:14:15,713 --> 01:14:19,281
Thickening agents and emulsifiers
simulate the texture of ice cream.

1090
01:14:19,782 --> 01:14:22,250
- Tastes just like the real thing.
- It's easy as pie to make.

1091
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:25,064
You put a packet into a
glass of water and stir it.

1092
01:14:25,254 --> 01:14:28,251
I know it may be a tad blasphemous
what with your dairy background and all.

1093
01:14:28,252 --> 01:14:31,008
Personally, I think it's
a marvelous idea.

1094
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:37,393
Chocolate or vanilla?

1095
01:14:37,798 --> 01:14:38,927
Vanilla.

1096
01:15:00,723 --> 01:15:02,867
Good things come to those who wait.

1097
01:15:27,014 --> 01:15:28,294
What do you think?

1098
01:15:28,582 --> 01:15:31,343
I think I'm drinking a
delicious vanilla milkshake.

1099
01:15:34,341 --> 01:15:35,758
May I?

1100
01:15:44,569 --> 01:15:45,595
I can't resist.

1101
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:47,611
So what do you say?

1102
01:15:47,896 --> 01:15:51,528
- We try it out at our place and if it goes well...
- We roll it out nationally.

1103
01:15:52,659 --> 01:15:54,957
I could, yeah.
Let me think about it.

1104
01:15:58,466 --> 01:15:59,494
You're the boss.

1105
01:16:08,539 --> 01:16:09,559
McDonald's.

1106
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,717
Just found a way to save you,
me and all our owner operators...

1107
01:16:12,718 --> 01:16:16,574
- literally hundreds of dollars a year in electrical costs.
- And what would that be?

1108
01:16:16,575 --> 01:16:18,122
Two words: powerded milkshake.

1109
01:16:18,123 --> 01:16:22,082
I'm tellin' you I came across a remarkable
called instamix.

1110
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:23,933
Like I say, it's a powdered milkshake,

1111
01:16:23,934 --> 01:16:28,228
it's a fraction of the cost of ice cream
and requires no refridgeration.

1112
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:29,537
- Ray...
- I tell ya I tried it myself,

1113
01:16:29,538 --> 01:16:31,686
it tastes just like the real thing.
It's delicious!

1114
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,584
Comes in chocolate, comes in vanilla...

1115
01:16:33,585 --> 01:16:34,908
me, I'm a vanilla man.

1116
01:16:34,909 --> 01:16:38,644
Ray we have no interest in a milkshake
that contains NO MILK.

1117
01:16:38,645 --> 01:16:40,925
Why don't we add sawdust to
the hamburgers while we're at it...

1118
01:16:40,926 --> 01:16:42,205
frozen french fries.

1119
01:16:42,206 --> 01:16:44,584
- You don't want to save a bundle.
- Not like that.

1120
01:16:44,585 --> 01:16:46,566
We're talking about the same great taste...

1121
01:16:46,567 --> 01:16:47,567
same great taste, while
boosting the bottom line.

1122
01:16:47,568 --> 01:16:51,070
It's called a milkshake Ray.

1123
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,058
Real milk.

1124
01:16:52,059 --> 01:16:53,361
Now and forever!

1125
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:55,229
I understa...

1126
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,580
I'm just asking you to extend my line.

1127
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:23,025
Until you build more equity in your
home or pay down the loan...

1128
01:17:23,026 --> 01:17:24,018
there's nothing I can do.

1129
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:26,747
- My business is booming.
- Unfortunately that's immaterial.

1130
01:17:26,748 --> 01:17:28,821
Well, I've got 13 locations in 9 states...

1131
01:17:28,822 --> 01:17:30,560
It's a home equity loan.

1132
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:31,688
Then give me a business loan.

1133
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:34,110
- These 13 locations, do you own 'em?
- Me personally?

1134
01:17:34,111 --> 01:17:36,059
It's your business, correct?
You own it.

1135
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,554
I'm the head of franchising.

1136
01:17:37,979 --> 01:17:40,937
I'm the one behind this growth.

1137
01:17:40,938 --> 01:17:42,643
That's all well and good
but you need assets.

1138
01:17:44,564 --> 01:17:45,991
Have you been to a McDonald's?

1139
01:17:45,992 --> 01:17:49,921
Because we've got 3 right here in the Chicagoland
area and you should come by and take a look.

1140
01:17:49,922 --> 01:17:53,108
I would love to give you a tour to give
you a better sense of what I'm talking about.

1141
01:17:56,392 --> 01:17:57,185
Mr. Kroc...

1142
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,228
May I help you?

1143
01:17:59,854 --> 01:18:03,271
No, but... perhaps I can help you.

1144
01:18:03,603 --> 01:18:05,113
Harry Sonneborn, nice to meet you.

1145
01:18:06,013 --> 01:18:09,045
No, thanks.
We're very happy with our current supplier.

1146
01:18:09,512 --> 01:18:10,933
I'm not here to sell you ice cream.

1147
01:18:11,235 --> 01:18:12,539
What the hell do ya want?

1148
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:16,010
I caught a bit of your conversation back there,
sounds like you're having financial troubles.

1149
01:18:16,344 --> 01:18:17,548
Why don't you mind your own business?

1150
01:18:17,549 --> 01:18:19,462
I'm a great admirer of your establishment.

1151
01:18:21,178 --> 01:18:23,968
- Thank you.
- I eat lunch at your Waukegan location at least twice a week.

1152
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:25,699
Always a fantastic crowd.

1153
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:27,261
Your point being...

1154
01:18:27,262 --> 01:18:32,200
Mr. Kroc, if you're not making money hand over fist,
something's terribly wrong.

1155
01:18:36,552 --> 01:18:38,311
June, grab the ledger would ya?

1156
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:40,551
Come on in the office Harry.

1157
01:18:52,831 --> 01:18:56,741
So, to summerize,
you have a miniscule revenue stream...

1158
01:18:56,742 --> 01:18:57,926
no cash reserves...

1159
01:18:57,927 --> 01:18:59,880
amd an albatross of a contract...

1160
01:18:59,881 --> 01:19:02,173
that requires you to go through
a slow approval process to...

1161
01:19:02,174 --> 01:19:04,249
enact changes, if they're approved at all.

1162
01:19:04,743 --> 01:19:05,825
Which, they never are.

1163
01:19:06,737 --> 01:19:08,322
Am I missing anything?

1164
01:19:08,323 --> 01:19:09,619
That about sums it up.

1165
01:19:10,929 --> 01:19:12,518
Tell me about the land.

1166
01:19:12,519 --> 01:19:14,132
The... land.

1167
01:19:14,133 --> 01:19:17,267
The land, the buildings, how
that whole aspect of it works.

1168
01:19:17,488 --> 01:19:19,197
Oh, pretty simple really...

1169
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:21,617
franchisee finds a piece of land he likes...

1170
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,710
gets a lease, usually 20 years...

1171
01:19:23,711 --> 01:19:25,472
and takes our construction loan...

1172
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:28,396
throws up a building
and off he goes.

1173
01:19:30,082 --> 01:19:32,331
So the operator selects the site?

1174
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:34,503
- Yeah.
- He picks the property.

1175
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:35,260
Right.

1176
01:19:35,261 --> 01:19:38,452
You provide the training, the system,
the operational know how...

1177
01:19:38,453 --> 01:19:41,601
and he is responsible for the rest.

1178
01:19:42,378 --> 01:19:43,880
- Is there a problem?
- A big one.

1179
01:19:44,369 --> 01:19:46,546
You don't seem to realize
what business you're in.

1180
01:19:48,514 --> 01:19:50,590
You're not in the burger business,

1181
01:19:50,591 --> 01:19:52,665
you're in the real estate business.

1182
01:19:54,657 --> 01:20:01,053
You don't build an empire off a 1.4% cut
of a $0.15 hamburger.

1183
01:20:01,697 --> 01:20:04,496
You build it by owning the land...

1184
01:20:04,497 --> 01:20:06,689
upon which that burger is cooked.

1185
01:20:07,579 --> 01:20:09,268
What you ought to be doing...

1186
01:20:09,269 --> 01:20:11,185
is buying up plots of land...

1187
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:14,960
then turning around and leasing
said plots to franchisees.

1188
01:20:14,961 --> 01:20:16,543
Who as a condition of their deal...

1189
01:20:16,544 --> 01:20:20,018
should be permitted to lease from you,
and you alone.

1190
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,821
This will provide you with two things.

1191
01:20:22,822 --> 01:20:25,473
1. A steady up front revenue stream...

1192
01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:26,474
money flows in before the
first stake is in the ground.

1193
01:20:26,475 --> 01:20:31,497
2. Greater capital for expansion.

1194
01:20:31,498 --> 01:20:34,183
Which in turn fuels further land aquisition...

1195
01:20:34,184 --> 01:20:36,253
which in turn fuels further expansion...

1196
01:20:36,254 --> 01:20:38,707
and so on, and so on.

1197
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,113
Land.

1198
01:20:46,415 --> 01:20:48,087
That's where the money is.

1199
01:20:48,088 --> 01:20:50,318
And more than that, control.

1200
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:54,296
Control over the franchisee.

1201
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:58,198
Fail to uphold quality standards,
you cancel their lease.

1202
01:20:59,483 --> 01:21:02,842
Control over Dick and Mac.

1203
01:21:03,078 --> 01:21:07,846
End result, you'll have the banks and the
franchisees in the palm of your hand.

1204
01:21:09,004 --> 01:21:12,915
If I were to do this, the brothers,
they uh...

1205
01:21:15,582 --> 01:21:19,473
- effectively would be...
- Yes.

1206
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:23,697
So...

1207
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:27,252
What do you say Ray?

1208
01:21:43,361 --> 01:21:47,995
We'll need backing. I've arranged meetings
with investors and financial institutions.

1209
01:21:47,996 --> 01:21:51,199
The center of town which is the
only oversaturated aspect...

1210
01:21:53,694 --> 01:21:56,047
Has anyone here ever eaten at McDonald's?

1211
01:21:56,048 --> 01:21:58,237
This population growth is
going to enable us to expand...

1212
01:22:00,644 --> 01:22:03,931
The figures are exaggerated but they're
fully supported by the numericals.

1213
01:22:03,932 --> 01:22:06,313
In fact, we erred on the side of caution with these.

1214
01:22:06,314 --> 01:22:06,860
He's being conservative.

1215
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:10,367
Mine, based on gut, and my gut
tells me those numbers are low.

1216
01:22:10,368 --> 01:22:12,536
McDonald's, growing quick as a hick.

1217
01:22:12,537 --> 01:22:14,640
I'm Harry Sonneborn, this is Ray Kroc.

1218
01:22:14,675 --> 01:22:18,483
Hurry over to McDonald's.
Now serving family communities from coast to coast.

1219
01:22:18,749 --> 01:22:22,992
You're probably only minutes away
from America's favorite restaurant.

1220
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:27,486
McDonald's fast service is the
perfect answer for parties,

1221
01:22:27,487 --> 01:22:31,080
birthday lunches, and family
meals any time.

1222
01:22:31,177 --> 01:22:33,748
With no fuss or dishes to do.

1223
01:22:34,341 --> 01:22:36,765
It's America's greatest food value.

1224
01:22:37,024 --> 01:22:40,039
No wonder you see so many
of your neighbors there.

1225
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:44,499
If you want home quality cooking
without the home work, try McDonald's.

1226
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,963
Look for the Golden Arches at McDonald's.

1227
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:49,166
The closest thing to home.

1228
01:22:59,627 --> 01:23:03,104
Have you heard of the Franchise Realty Corporation?

1229
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:03,998
What is it?

1230
01:23:04,226 --> 01:23:08,447
I have no clue. Apparently
Ray Kroc is president and C.E.O.

1231
01:23:12,815 --> 01:23:16,449
- Hiya Dick, how ya doin'?
- Well if you really wanna know, I'm a tad miffed.

1232
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,617
Why, what seems to be the problem?

1233
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:20,551
- Franchise Realty Corporation.
- What about it?

1234
01:23:21,045 --> 01:23:23,830
For starters, would you mind
telling me what it is?

1235
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:24,990
Oh nothing really.

1236
01:23:24,991 --> 01:23:28,269
Just a little something I created
to provide leasing services...

1237
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,270
you know, lend support to
our new franchisees.

1238
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:35,396
You know full well you can't do something
like that without first clearing it.

1239
01:23:38,114 --> 01:23:40,826
Now, why would I need to do that?

1240
01:23:40,827 --> 01:23:44,980
Because as your deal states, any and
all changes must be agreed to in writing.

1241
01:23:45,391 --> 01:23:47,955
- Except it's not a change.
- Excuse me?

1242
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:51,003
It's not a change.
It's a company.

1243
01:23:52,942 --> 01:23:56,735
It's its own separate company,
which puts it outside your purview.

1244
01:23:56,736 --> 01:24:00,193
Anything relating to McDonald's
is within our purview.

1245
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,180
Let me explain something to you Dick...

1246
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:09,523
You boys have full say over what
goes on inside the restaurants.

1247
01:24:09,983 --> 01:24:12,607
But outside, above, below...

1248
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,551
your authority stops at the door.

1249
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:18,518
And at the floor.

1250
01:24:19,893 --> 01:24:20,847
Alright?

1251
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:31,178
What is he saying?

1252
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:33,086
He's buying the land.

1253
01:24:34,246 --> 01:24:35,314
Our land?

1254
01:24:36,922 --> 01:24:38,058
Get one of the map.

1255
01:24:38,059 --> 01:24:42,092
Make sure to get this and we
wanna get all the pins in there.

1256
01:24:44,582 --> 01:24:45,948
You sure you see this?

1257
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:49,249
Alright.
How about one at the desk?

1258
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:01,441
Make sure you get that in focus.

1259
01:25:02,642 --> 01:25:04,700
K, smile.
Good, good, good, good.

1260
01:25:08,862 --> 01:25:10,057
Delivery!

1261
01:25:13,052 --> 01:25:14,094
Where do ya want these?

1262
01:25:14,887 --> 01:25:15,939
Ray...

1263
01:25:17,559 --> 01:25:18,854
I've thought it over.

1264
01:25:20,142 --> 01:25:21,070
Approved.

1265
01:25:24,071 --> 01:25:24,883
Really?

1266
01:25:25,309 --> 01:25:27,177
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1267
01:25:27,538 --> 01:25:29,964
It's a wizz bang idea and
you're the one who thought of it.

1268
01:25:30,685 --> 01:25:33,498
Well we're deeply honored to
serve as your test market.

1269
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:36,547
The hell with that.
I'm gonna roll this out nationally.

1270
01:25:37,513 --> 01:25:41,107
You seen the latest copy of RBM?
Hot off the press.

1271
01:25:44,703 --> 01:25:45,858
Ray, good for you.

1272
01:25:55,745 --> 01:25:57,989
It's about 10 miles south of downtown...

1273
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:00,297
They're building a brand new sports stadium there.

1274
01:26:00,298 --> 01:26:01,396
Yeah, I read about it.

1275
01:26:01,397 --> 01:26:04,449
We're getting a profesional baseball and
football team, they'll both be playing there.

1276
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,780
I think I know where you're headed with this.

1277
01:26:07,457 --> 01:26:11,863
A 40,000 seat stadium just a stone's
throw away? Imagine the foot traffic.

1278
01:26:11,864 --> 01:26:14,233
Hungry families looking for a
bite to eat after the game.

1279
01:26:14,582 --> 01:26:16,335
Or before? Whenever.

1280
01:26:16,336 --> 01:26:17,274
Exactly.

1281
01:26:17,809 --> 01:26:18,268
Yeah.

1282
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:22,360
You think big, don't ya Joan?

1283
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:27,190
Is there any other way to?

1284
01:26:30,716 --> 01:26:32,560
Well, you'd be surprised.

1285
01:26:35,466 --> 01:26:40,280
A lot of people are afraid of taking a chance,
to you know, reach for greatness.

1286
01:26:42,393 --> 01:26:43,885
That's so sad.

1287
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:45,915
I agree.

1288
01:26:46,271 --> 01:26:47,360
Ambition.

1289
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:49,543
That's the stuff in life.

1290
01:26:51,286 --> 01:26:53,811
What was that saying?

1291
01:26:54,781 --> 01:26:58,014
- Fortune favors the bold.
- Absolutely.

1292
01:27:03,371 --> 01:27:05,290
Just look at you.

1293
01:27:09,287 --> 01:27:11,652
You calling me bold, Joan?

1294
01:27:12,475 --> 01:27:16,225
You don't build a restaurant empire
acting like a timid little mouse.

1295
01:27:41,904 --> 01:27:43,522
That's a fast growing area.

1296
01:27:43,523 --> 01:27:46,665
And cheaper. You're talking
a good 15% less per acre.

1297
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:49,339
- I still think Houston's a better location.
- Ray?

1298
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:51,022
- Yeah.
- Dick's on line 1.

1299
01:27:51,529 --> 01:27:52,876
Well.

1300
01:28:00,785 --> 01:28:04,402
- Hiya Dick.
- I just received a very disconcerting call.

1301
01:28:04,502 --> 01:28:05,155
Oh?

1302
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:09,722
From Buddy Jepson, our
operator in Sacramento.

1303
01:28:10,039 --> 01:28:11,868
I'm very aware of who Buddy Jepson is.

1304
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:14,197
He told me he received a shipment this morning.

1305
01:28:14,198 --> 01:28:14,935
Oh, it arrived.

1306
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:17,069
You are way out of line, Ray.

1307
01:28:17,529 --> 01:28:20,644
Hey I didn't expect that to get
there until Friday at the earliest.

1308
01:28:20,645 --> 01:28:26,130
Would you mind telling me what you are doing
shipping 4 cases of Instamix to one of our operators?

1309
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:31,173
Look, if you don't wanna
make a profit, that's fine.

1310
01:28:31,174 --> 01:28:32,893
But don't stop the rest of us.

1311
01:28:32,894 --> 01:28:33,878
Us?

1312
01:28:33,879 --> 01:28:36,746
Us, as in everyone but you.

1313
01:28:36,747 --> 01:28:37,736
Who did you send them to?

1314
01:28:37,737 --> 01:28:38,991
Everyone but you.

1315
01:28:40,405 --> 01:28:43,938
You have no right. You are to
stop this instant, is that clear?

1316
01:28:46,012 --> 01:28:48,722
- Nah.
- What the hell does that mean, nah?

1317
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:50,998
You will abide by the terms of your deal.

1318
01:28:53,178 --> 01:28:56,716
I am through taking marching orders from you...

1319
01:28:56,717 --> 01:28:59,239
you and your endless parade of NO's.

1320
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,271
Constantly cowering in the face of progress.

1321
01:29:02,272 --> 01:29:05,197
If phony powdered milkshakes
is your idea of progress...

1322
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:08,864
you have a profound misunderstand
of what McDonald's is about.

1323
01:29:09,405 --> 01:29:12,870
I have a far greater understanding
of McDonald's than you two yokles.

1324
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:13,594
What?

1325
01:29:13,595 --> 01:29:15,786
You will do as we say.

1326
01:29:16,161 --> 01:29:17,143
Nope.

1327
01:29:18,737 --> 01:29:20,306
You have a contract!

1328
01:29:27,055 --> 01:29:30,276
You know, contracts are like hearts...

1329
01:29:31,049 --> 01:29:32,411
they're made to be broken.

1330
01:29:47,141 --> 01:29:49,082
Could you please pass the salt?

1331
01:29:52,227 --> 01:29:53,064
Thank you.

1332
01:30:06,436 --> 01:30:08,089
I want a divorce.

1333
01:30:34,401 --> 01:30:36,885
When trying to quietly settle a divorce...

1334
01:30:36,886 --> 01:30:39,407
the first thing to ask is,
what will she want?

1335
01:30:39,408 --> 01:30:42,076
And, is her request reasonable and equitable?

1336
01:30:42,077 --> 01:30:46,893
In terms of marital property there's the house,
and car, savings and checking accounts...

1337
01:30:46,894 --> 01:30:48,093
- Insurance...
- Just give it to her.

1338
01:30:48,094 --> 01:30:49,358
House, car, insurance.

1339
01:30:52,595 --> 01:30:54,093
What about the business?

1340
01:30:57,316 --> 01:30:58,368
Nope.

1341
01:30:59,799 --> 01:31:01,879
Ray, ya have to understand...

1342
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,488
- that she's the...
- K.

1343
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,197
Lemme explain somethin' to ya.

1344
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:11,681
It's never gonna happen.

1345
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:19,899
I'd sooner die than give her
one single share in McDonald's.

1346
01:31:25,223 --> 01:31:29,773
It's not so simple. The brothers are your business
partners. You signed this contract.

1347
01:31:29,844 --> 01:31:31,126
Make it go away.

1348
01:31:31,753 --> 01:31:33,592
And I don't care what it takes.

1349
01:31:35,252 --> 01:31:36,544
It's gonna cost ya.

1350
01:32:05,215 --> 01:32:08,130
'New Flavor, Strawberry'
'Maybe you'll like this one, best, Ray'

1351
01:32:12,759 --> 01:32:16,049
I'm looking at a letterhead with
the name McDonald's on it.

1352
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:17,536
You care to explain?

1353
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:21,061
It was confusing. People didn't even
know it had anything to do with McDonald's.

1354
01:32:21,062 --> 01:32:25,460
What's confusing is you calling yourself
'The McDonald's Corporation'.

1355
01:32:25,461 --> 01:32:28,299
People will think it's the whole company,
not just the real estate arm...

1356
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,989
which we strongly suspect is what you hope!

1357
01:32:31,909 --> 01:32:34,403
You put Dick's arches on your letterhead?

1358
01:32:34,404 --> 01:32:35,404
This is not your company, Ray.

1359
01:32:37,901 --> 01:32:40,241
- Do you understand that!?!?
- Mac, don't get upset.

1360
01:32:40,795 --> 01:32:43,910
We came up with the speedy system, not you.

1361
01:32:43,911 --> 01:32:45,533
Us.
What have you ever come up with?

1362
01:32:45,534 --> 01:32:46,703
Can you name one thing?

1363
01:32:46,704 --> 01:32:48,629
You can't, and you never have,
and you never will...

1364
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:51,657
because you are a leech, Ray.
You are a professional leech.

1365
01:32:50,657 --> 01:32:53,230
You know what I came up with, Mac?

1366
01:32:51,658 --> 01:32:53,230
You know what I came up with, Mac

1367
01:32:53,231 --> 01:32:56,702
A concept.
I came with the concept of winning.

1368
01:32:56,703 --> 01:32:57,790
Lemme talk to him.

1369
01:32:57,791 --> 01:33:00,375
While you two boys were content to sit
back and become a couple of also-rans...

1370
01:33:01,183 --> 01:33:03,025
I wanna take the future.
I wanna win.

1371
01:33:03,026 --> 01:33:06,167
And you don't get there by being
some "aw shucks" guy sap.

1372
01:33:06,168 --> 01:33:08,174
There's no place in business for people like that.

1373
01:33:08,175 --> 01:33:09,590
Business is war.

1374
01:33:09,722 --> 01:33:12,426
It's dog eat dog,
rat eat rat.

1375
01:33:12,427 --> 01:33:17,137
If my competitor were drowning,
I'd walk over and put a hose right in his mouth.

1376
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:22,578
Can you say the same?

1377
01:33:32,737 --> 01:33:34,248
I can't.

1378
01:33:35,388 --> 01:33:36,484
Nor would I want to.

1379
01:33:37,547 --> 01:33:39,062
Hence, your single location.

1380
01:33:40,689 --> 01:33:43,963
- We want you out of this company, Ray.
- Mac, how do you propose we do that?

1381
01:33:43,964 --> 01:33:45,733
We will sue you,
whatever it takes.

1382
01:33:45,734 --> 01:33:46,734
And you'd probably win.

1383
01:33:46,735 --> 01:33:48,708
But you can't afford to sue me.

1384
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:50,934
I'd bury you in court costs alone.

1385
01:33:50,935 --> 01:33:56,681
Mac, I'm the president and C.E.O. of a
major corporation with land holdings in 17 states...

1386
01:33:56,682 --> 01:33:58,659
You run a burger stand in the desert.

1387
01:33:59,854 --> 01:34:01,258
I'm national.

1388
01:34:02,045 --> 01:34:03,715
You're fucking local.

1389
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:15,042
Mac!

1390
01:34:21,153 --> 01:34:22,868
Are you following your eating plan?

1391
01:34:23,274 --> 01:34:23,865
Yes.

1392
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,451
And you're checking your glucose levels...

1393
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:27,919
and you're taking your medication
on a consistant basis...

1394
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:28,715
Yes.

1395
01:34:28,716 --> 01:34:32,024
- Regular walks, 20 minutes a day?
- I'm on my feet all day.

1396
01:34:32,025 --> 01:34:32,908
Any stress?

1397
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:39,136
Okay.

1398
01:34:39,137 --> 01:34:42,037
You need to watch that.
That's a big contributing factor.

1399
01:34:42,967 --> 01:34:46,671
So as I said, your kidney
function is currently at 50%.

1400
01:34:46,672 --> 01:34:48,926
Now 18 months ago it was 65%.

1401
01:34:49,524 --> 01:34:52,654
Any lower and you're at serious
risk for kidney failure.

1402
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:56,121
Okay, I'll check on you later.

1403
01:34:59,179 --> 01:35:00,701
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1404
01:35:09,538 --> 01:35:12,496
William who rode with Revere...

1405
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:16,034
- How many letters?
- 5, 4th letter 'E'.

1406
01:35:17,726 --> 01:35:19,050
Dawes.

1407
01:35:21,452 --> 01:35:22,606
Come in!

1408
01:35:25,414 --> 01:35:27,090
How ya feelin'?

1409
01:35:29,608 --> 01:35:32,748
Geez, sounded like somethin' spilled
I followed it right to the phone.

1410
01:35:33,202 --> 01:35:36,093
I hear about the, accident.

1411
01:35:38,822 --> 01:35:40,177
I'll set it right here.

1412
01:35:43,473 --> 01:35:44,450
Dick.

1413
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:46,384
There's a card in there.

1414
01:35:49,576 --> 01:35:51,043
Go ahead.

1415
01:35:51,044 --> 01:35:52,185
That's okay.

1416
01:35:52,186 --> 01:35:53,623
No, here. Just...

1417
01:35:54,255 --> 01:35:55,524
You're gonna be happy.

1418
01:36:06,908 --> 01:36:08,009
What's this?

1419
01:36:09,056 --> 01:36:10,202
What's it look like?

1420
01:36:10,203 --> 01:36:11,669
A blank check.

1421
01:36:15,313 --> 01:36:19,097
Then that's uh...
that's probably what it is.

1422
01:36:19,876 --> 01:36:20,904
What are you buying?

1423
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:29,941
Okay.

1424
01:36:30,649 --> 01:36:31,842
You get better...

1425
01:36:32,555 --> 01:36:38,159
You get up on your feet in no time,
and we'll talk. Alright?

1426
01:36:39,153 --> 01:36:39,751
Dick.

1427
01:37:11,147 --> 01:37:13,010
We will never beat him.

1428
01:37:14,943 --> 01:37:17,270
We will never be rid of him.

1429
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:29,603
Dick McDonald's on the line.

1430
01:37:40,546 --> 01:37:42,208
Hello Dick.

1431
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:44,559
2.7 million.

1432
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:47,398
That's a million for each of us after taxes.

1433
01:37:49,857 --> 01:37:54,711
And, 1% of the company's
profits in perpetuity.

1434
01:37:56,116 --> 01:37:58,464
That's outrageous.
That's borderline extortion.

1435
01:37:58,465 --> 01:38:00,330
That's a bunch of bullshit.
BULLSHIT!

1436
01:38:00,331 --> 01:38:03,026
- I know it seems like a lot of money now.
- Yeah, it seems like a lot of money any time.

1437
01:38:03,027 --> 01:38:04,634
And they want one other thing.

1438
01:38:04,814 --> 01:38:05,374
What?

1439
01:38:05,870 --> 01:38:07,447
- San Bernardino.
- Nah ah.

1440
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:08,168
No way.

1441
01:38:08,075 --> 01:38:10,925
To give to their long-time
employees as a gift.

1442
01:38:10,926 --> 01:38:14,557
I need the profits from San Bernardino
in order to pay off the purchase loan.

1443
01:38:14,977 --> 01:38:19,105
I've spoken about it at length with their
lawyers it's unfortunately, non-negotiable.

1444
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:24,738
Our client agrees fully with your conditions
of sale, with one exception...

1445
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:29,640
Your 1% cut of future corporate earnings
will have to be carried out on a handshake basis.

1446
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:36,029
It's my investor group.
The financing is contigent on...

1447
01:38:36,386 --> 01:38:37,899
leaving that out of the contract...

1448
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:42,074
and unfortunately this deal just doesn't happen, it doesn't
get financed unless you leave it out of the contract.

1449
01:38:42,075 --> 01:38:45,569
because unfortunately that's
a deal breaker for them.

1450
01:38:50,465 --> 01:38:52,583
Look fellas...

1451
01:38:52,584 --> 01:38:55,212
you'll get your full royalties, alright?

1452
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:00,522
You got my word on that.

1453
01:39:01,236 --> 01:39:02,486
Dick, Mac...

1454
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:06,294
Let's make a deal.

1455
01:39:15,142 --> 01:39:16,124
Alright.

1456
01:39:17,073 --> 01:39:22,437
Alright gentlemen, turn to page 4 of your contract and
that's the first set of signatures we need to go over.

1457
01:40:08,266 --> 01:40:10,933
I just have to ask you one thing.

1458
01:40:10,934 --> 01:40:12,587
Somethin' I've never understood.

1459
01:40:12,588 --> 01:40:13,752
Alright.

1460
01:40:15,774 --> 01:40:18,473
That day we met,
when we gave you the tour...

1461
01:40:18,924 --> 01:40:20,341
Uh huh. What about it?

1462
01:40:20,531 --> 01:40:21,930
We showed you everything.

1463
01:40:23,207 --> 01:40:25,892
The whole system, all of our secrets.
We were an open book.

1464
01:40:26,517 --> 01:40:29,019
- So why didn't you just...
- Steal it?

1465
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:33,411
Just, grab your ideas and run off,
start my own business...

1466
01:40:33,412 --> 01:40:35,188
using all those ideas of yours.

1467
01:40:35,189 --> 01:40:36,868
- It would have failed.
- How do you know?

1468
01:40:36,869 --> 01:40:39,142
Am I the only one who got the kitchen tour?

1469
01:40:39,143 --> 01:40:42,108
You must have invited lots
of people back there, huh?

1470
01:40:42,109 --> 01:40:43,259
And?

1471
01:40:43,267 --> 01:40:45,048
How many of them succeeded?

1472
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,531
Lots of people started restaurants.

1473
01:40:47,532 --> 01:40:48,571
As big as McDonald's?

1474
01:40:48,572 --> 01:40:49,660
Of course not.

1475
01:40:49,802 --> 01:40:55,364
No one ever has and no one ever will
because they all lacked that one thing...

1476
01:40:56,089 --> 01:40:57,833
that makes McDonald's special.

1477
01:40:57,834 --> 01:40:58,731
Which is?

1478
01:41:01,038 --> 01:41:03,237
Even you don't know what it is.

1479
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:04,300
Enlighten me.

1480
01:41:05,759 --> 01:41:08,225
It's not just the system, Dick.

1481
01:41:09,014 --> 01:41:10,034
It's the name.

1482
01:41:10,585 --> 01:41:13,063
That glorious name, McDonald's.

1483
01:41:13,584 --> 01:41:17,293
It could be, anything you want it to be...

1484
01:41:17,294 --> 01:41:19,312
it's limitless, it's wide open...

1485
01:41:19,313 --> 01:41:21,345
it sounds, uh...

1486
01:41:21,936 --> 01:41:23,320
it sounds like...

1487
01:41:23,888 --> 01:41:25,606
it sounds like America.

1488
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:29,660
That's compared to Kroc. What a crock.
What a load of crock.

1489
01:41:29,661 --> 01:41:35,118
Would you eat at a place named Kroc's?
Kroc's has that blunt, Slavic sound.

1490
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:36,097
Kroc's.

1491
01:41:36,098 --> 01:41:38,575
But McDonald's, oh boy.

1492
01:41:38,576 --> 01:41:39,461
That's a beauty.

1493
01:41:40,347 --> 01:41:42,150
Yeah...

1494
01:41:42,733 --> 01:41:44,840
A guy named McDonald?

1495
01:41:46,189 --> 01:41:48,497
He's never gonna get pushed around in life.

1496
01:41:49,953 --> 01:41:51,769
That's clearly not the case.

1497
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:57,695
So, you don't have a check for
1.35 million dollars in your pocket?

1498
01:42:03,189 --> 01:42:04,674
Bye Dick.

1499
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:08,073
So if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em.

1500
01:42:10,922 --> 01:42:15,792
I remember the first time I saw that name
stretched across your stand out there.

1501
01:42:17,032 --> 01:42:18,643
It was love at first sight.

1502
01:42:18,644 --> 01:42:21,327
I knew right then and there...

1503
01:42:22,036 --> 01:42:23,518
I had to have it.

1504
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,190
And now I do.

1505
01:42:27,562 --> 01:42:29,268
You don't, have it.

1506
01:42:32,762 --> 01:42:34,046
You sure about that?

1507
01:42:37,456 --> 01:42:38,374
Bye Dick.

1508
01:42:46,214 --> 01:42:51,281
As per the terms of your agreement, while you
are entitled to maintain ownership of this location...

1509
01:42:51,628 --> 01:42:55,831
you no longer have the right to call it, McDonald's,
McDonald, or any other such variations...

1510
01:42:55,832 --> 01:42:58,896
so as to confuse or infringe
upon the McDonald's trademark...

1511
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:02,738
which is now the exclusive intellectual
property of Mr. Raymond A. Kroc.

1512
01:43:02,739 --> 01:43:03,511
Thank you gentlemen.

1513
01:43:25,058 --> 01:43:26,154
It'll be alright.

1514
01:43:35,664 --> 01:43:38,677
Now, I know what you're thinkin'.

1515
01:43:39,286 --> 01:43:44,666
How the hell does a 52 year old,
over-the-hill milkshake machine salesman...

1516
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:51,150
build a fastfood empire with 16,000 restaurants,
in 50 states, in 5 foreign countries...

1517
01:43:51,151 --> 01:43:56,311
wtih an annual revenue of in the
neighborhood of $700,000,000.00...

1518
01:43:57,764 --> 01:43:58,781
One word...

1519
01:43:59,834 --> 01:44:01,575
PERSISTENCE.

1520
01:44:06,397 --> 01:44:10,784
Nothing in this world can take
the place of good old persistence.

1521
01:44:11,292 --> 01:44:16,800
Talent won't. Nothing's more common
than unsuccessful men with talent.

1522
01:44:17,589 --> 01:44:18,923
Genius won't.

1523
01:44:19,736 --> 01:44:22,489
Unrecognized genius is practically a cliché.

1524
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:24,192
Education won't.

1525
01:44:24,193 --> 01:44:27,105
Why the world is full of educated fools.

1526
01:44:27,244 --> 01:44:31,969
Persistence and determination
alone are all powerful.

1527
01:44:49,006 --> 01:44:52,116
Mr. Kroc., Bill Davison.

1528
01:44:52,117 --> 01:44:55,622
I'd like to do a profile of you
pegged to your 100th location.

1529
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:57,438
Sure, call my office.

1530
01:44:58,387 --> 01:44:59,098
Sure thing.

1531
01:45:00,048 --> 01:45:00,829
Alright.

1532
01:45:11,306 --> 01:45:13,468
It's these core principles...

1533
01:45:13,469 --> 01:45:16,041
that enabled me to rise to the top of a heap...

1534
01:45:16,042 --> 01:45:20,457
at a point in life when most men
would be thinking about retirement.

1535
01:45:20,791 --> 01:45:23,531
Why, we appear to have that in common,
governer Reagan.

1536
01:45:23,532 --> 01:45:27,167
Why, you were what, 55
when you started in politics?

1537
01:45:27,945 --> 01:45:30,866
That's why you make me
look like a spring chicken.

1538
01:45:30,867 --> 01:45:32,568
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

1539
01:45:33,035 --> 01:45:36,172
Why, look at us.
A couple of Illinois boys.

1540
01:45:36,173 --> 01:45:39,247
Made good.
Only in America.

1541
01:45:41,283 --> 01:45:43,072
Only in America.

1542
01:45:43,073 --> 01:45:44,600
Only in America!

1543
01:45:45,599 --> 01:45:47,919
Now where was...
Now where was I?

1544
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,298
Ah yes.

1545
01:45:50,299 --> 01:45:51,374
The beginning.

1546
01:45:51,987 --> 01:45:54,572
The year was 1954.

1547
01:45:56,110 --> 01:45:57,406
The place...

1548
01:45:58,321 --> 01:45:59,712
Des Plaines, Illinois.

1549
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:02,000
The car's out front now.

1550
01:46:02,001 --> 01:46:03,438
Be right down.

1551
01:46:28,987 --> 01:46:30,293
That's where it all started.

1552
01:46:33,599 --> 01:46:35,759
Right there on Lee Street.

1553
01:46:38,276 --> 01:46:39,855
McDonald's #1.

1554
01:47:09,716 --> 01:47:13,905
It was a typical, English American word...

1555
01:47:13,906 --> 01:47:16,121
it flowed, McDonald's.

1556
01:47:16,122 --> 01:47:19,233
I liked the sound of it.
It sounded wholesome...

1557
01:47:19,234 --> 01:47:20,946
and it sounded geniune.

1558
01:47:20,947 --> 01:47:21,879
Ya know?

1559
01:47:22,241 --> 01:47:27,634
Uh... I don't like these uh...
gimmick type names, you know?

1560
01:47:28,827 --> 01:47:33,628
Uh... burger this and burger that
and all that kind of stuff.

1561
01:47:33,752 --> 01:47:37,466
McDonald's has got a nice sounding name.
