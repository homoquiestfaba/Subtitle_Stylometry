I gotta say, those get more

30
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:30,856
every time you make them.

31
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,990
Yep.

32
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,459
Perfecting a coconut lime tart
is an on-going quest.

33
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,494
It's like a triple axel
for a skater.

34
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,162
You're never sure if
you're gonna land it.

35
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,398
Well those win the gold medal.

36
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,632
When did you get
in this morning?

37
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,967
<i>4:30.</i>

38
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,835
Why so early?

39
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,169
<i>The oven's acting up again,</i>

40
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,338
<i>I didn't want to take any
chances before the party.</i>

41
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,339
Don't start.

42
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,408
We can't get a new oven
until we get customers.

43
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,676
If we don't have
a functioning oven

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,679
we're not gonna have
any customers at all.

45
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,180
Two chefs with
no business sense.

46
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,148
What were we thinking?

47
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:56,849
We weren't thinking.

48
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:57,649
We were dreaming.

49
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,384
Well that dream
is quickly turning

50
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,719
into a financial nightmare.

51
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,055
Alright, Mr. Sunshine,
cheer up.

52
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:07,860
We are going to be a huge
success, trust me.

53
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,194
Trust me.

54
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,339
Hello, you two.

55
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,140
Hi, Helen.

56
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,574
Would you like some
olive bread?

57
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,242
Always.

58
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,643
Hey, mom.

59
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,779
I already have napkins.

60
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,047
Not as nice as these.

61
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:29,948
They were half price.

62
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,517
It was mandatory
that I buy them.

63
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,119
Ok, well we'll use them
for the engagement party.

64
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,055
Did I tell you that I introduced
the happy couple?

65
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,190
I'm quite the match-maker.

66
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,691
Yes, you mentioned that.

67
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,893
Several times.

68
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,196
Six couples and counting is
a pretty good track record.

69
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,697
What time will
Tom and Jill be ready?

70
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,699
I told everyone to get here
at 6:00.

71
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,101
Well I, we, would like
to thank you

72
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,802
for having the party here.

73
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,137
We certainly could use
the business.

74
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,906
Well, the best food in town.

75
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,374
Where else would I have it?

76
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,042
Ok, Marco?

77
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,777
Will you do decorations?

78
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,379
I have to get home
and get ready.

79
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,113
What are you wearing?

80
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,283
I have the blue wrap-around
dress from Hadley's.

81
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,384
Not the low cut red?

82
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,618
It's a party, mom, not a date.

83
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,153
Well, you never know
who you might meet.

84
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,055
Well, I'm gonna wear
the usual ensemble.

85
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,490
What do you think?

86
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,258
It's a good thing
you can bake.

87
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,328
You look really
good in red.

88
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,896
Am I too pushy with her?

89
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,331
Yes.

90
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,800
But you wear it very well.

91
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,419
<i>Hi Claire, you don't know me,</i>

92
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,588
<i>but your mother suggested
I give you a call.</i>

93
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,089
Seriously?!

94
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,124
<i>Maybe we can grab
dinner tomorrow.</i>

95
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,659
<i>My name is Peter Bloom.</i>

96
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,794
<i>Call me back and let me know.</i>

97
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:49,795
<i>My number is 206.555...</i>

98
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,964
No.

99
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,342
Who is Peter Bloom?

100
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,076
Peter, yes.

101
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,711
He came to an open house
of mine.

102
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,979
He didn't end up buying,

103
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,181
but a single man shopping
for a four bedroom?

104
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,716
I guess he wants to start
a family.

105
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,784
Mom, you have to stop
setting me up.

106
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,552
Claire.

107
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,786
Pretty soon your dad and I

108
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,388
are gonna be off
traveling the globe

109
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,658
and if he has his way we are
not gonna be home very much.

110
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,461
And I just... I hate the idea
of you being alone.

111
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,695
I'm not alone.

112
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,964
I'm here at the bakery 24/7,

113
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,966
which is exactly
where I want to be.

114
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,835
There is plenty of time for me
to find someone

115
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,203
and fall in love.

116
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,639
There is nothing wrong
with building your business

117
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,874
but you can't plan when
you're gonna fall in love.

118
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,477
Look. I love this place.

119
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,511
And it is enough for me.

120
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,813
It is more than enough,
believe me.

121
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,482
Hey.

122
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,883
Don't you look beautiful?

123
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,184
Thank you, dad.

124
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,689
Marco says that there's a wine
festival in Florence

125
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,557
that we would love.

126
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,992
Not a bad way to launch
our retirement.

127
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:54,893
Sounds nice.

128
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,828
I'm not ready for retirement.

129
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,830
I'm still in my prime.

130
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,332
Ok, late prime maybe,

131
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,100
but that's as much
as I'll concede.

132
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,535
Please go mingle.

133
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,037
I have it all from here.

134
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,372
We're being dismissed.

135
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,550
I'd like to thank all of you
for coming,

136
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,888
and I'd like to raise a glass
and wish Jill and...

137
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,122
Tom?

138
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,058
Tom.

139
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,895
A lifetime of love
and happiness.

140
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,102
And I would like to toast
my aunt, Helen,

141
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,204
for introducing me and Tom.

142
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,406
We can't thank you enough.

143
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,076
I couldn't be happier
for you two.

144
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,876
Cheers.

145
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,745
Cheers.

146
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,615
Alright, drinks are on my
big brother over at the bar.

147
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,883
Let's go.

148
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,260
Well, I'm glad someone
appreciates my advice.

149
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,328
Of course she does,

150
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,665
because you haven't been
advising her since birth.

151
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,401
What to eat, what to wear,
who to date.

152
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,235
Claire.

153
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,470
So dramatic.

154
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,239
You know, sometimes it takes
someone with perspective...

155
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:14,906
Mom, stop.

156
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:15,807
Please?

157
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,242
Stop intervening.

158
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,977
I'm perfectly happy as I am.

159
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,979
Ok, I get it.

160
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,314
Loud and clear.

161
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,482
Good.

162
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,217
Now go have some fun.

163
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,933
Let's face it.

164
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,703
Sometimes we all need someone
to dance with.

165
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,037
Do you wanna dance?

166
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,105
Hey, cuz.

167
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,306
Hello.

168
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,143
So one of Tom's friends
wanted to meet you.

169
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,782
The one standing next
to my mom?

170
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,549
Busted.

171
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,518
Yeah.

172
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,386
That's my cue to leave.

173
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,023
Thank you.

174
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,158
What part of

175
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:10,195
"I'm perfectly happy as I am"
do you not understand?

176
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:15,967
I was just going to say...
the tart was terrific.

177
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,705
That is my favourite thing
in the whole world.

178
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,073
What?

179
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,942
My daughter's smile.

180
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,649
So... Peter Bloom?

181
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,452
<i>You are relentless.</i>

182
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,190
I'm standing there in the
middle of the courtroom,

183
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,159
all eyes are on me, and
suddenly it occurs to me...

184
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,594
do-do you want some
more champagne?

185
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,728
No.

186
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,530
Because I have a whole lot
to celebrate here tonight.

187
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,099
Anyways, it occurs to me
that what I have is not

188
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,036
just a point of law

189
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,507
but an actual breach
of contract.

190
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,510
Needless to say,
I won the case.

191
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,414
My goal is to have my own
firm by the time I'm 40.

192
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:06,284
Unfortunately, Peter,
my goal is to go to sleep.

193
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,788
I'm sorry, I've just been up
since dawn.

194
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,424
Yeah, sure.

195
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,125
It was awful!

196
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,295
<i>Clearly this is not one of
your more inspired matches.</i>

197
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,730
No one bats 1000.

198
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,967
He returned his entree, twice.

199
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,702
And, and he couldn't stop
talking about himself at the top

200
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,736
of his lungs.

201
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,104
Next time I'll be more careful.

202
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,772
My vetting will be exhaustive.

203
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,907
<i>No.</i>

204
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:29,674
<i>No, there's not going
to be a next time.</i>

205
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,509
<i>No next time.</i>

206
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,409
That's it.

207
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,944
That is the last straw.

208
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,613
<i>Please, I told you I...</i>

209
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,082
I will know when the right guy
comes along.

210
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,985
<i>You gotta promise me,
no more.</i>

211
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,988
Mom, do you hear me?

212
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,056
Whatever you say.

213
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,058
Goodnight, dear.

214
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,527
Goodnight, mom.

215
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,400
You have to let her find love
in her own time,

216
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,269
on her own terms.

217
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:01,072
Hopefully in my lifetime.

218
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,475
I think she's still hurting that
it didn't work out last time.

219
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,777
She can't dwell on the past.

220
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,113
She needs to move on.

221
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:12,017
Maybe you're the one that needs
to move on, honey.

222
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,418
We need to book
those tickets.

223
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,254
We'll get to it.

224
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,423
What's the reluctance?

225
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,660
We've been planning this new
chapter of our lives for years.

226
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,029
Our grand Italian adventure.

227
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,997
Well, I like this chapter.

228
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,666
I'm not ready to move on.

229
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,868
But we get the best of both.

230
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,304
Half a year traveling,
half a year at home...

231
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,005
I guess.

232
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,846
Stop guessing, and just...
do this with me.

233
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:46,818
I want to, Sam, I really do,
it's just... retirement.

234
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,820
Don't think of it as retirement.

235
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,056
Think of it as six months
vacation.

236
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,325
Well, it's a marker though.

237
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:57,796
Another name for "getting old".

238
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,899
I keep thinking I'm 23.

239
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,933
So?

240
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,336
Be 23 in Italy.

241
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,937
If you wanna stay busy
with work the other six months

242
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,173
you have that option.

243
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,842
Right.

244
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,878
We still have a lot of time
ahead of us.

245
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,349
If you keep feeding me kale,
we could live forever.

246
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,422
It's a deal.

247
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:29,427
Just understand I need a little
time to take it all in.

248
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,030
Ok.

249
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,231
Thanks.

250
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,408
If I keep whining about Italy,

251
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,044
your father's gonna go alone
and I wouldn't blame him.

252
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,812
What are you so afraid of?

253
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,047
I don't know.

254
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,817
Losing my daily routine,
being away from you.

255
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:57,088
I mean, who am I
if not your mom?

256
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,425
I have a very precarious
sense of myself.

257
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,559
I'm nuts, right?

258
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:05,030
You're just figuring
that out now?

259
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,966
Look at this.

260
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,035
This one on the clearance rack
missing the skirt

261
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,037
and this discount beauty
missing the top.

262
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,571
You do have a good eye.

263
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,373
I do where you're concerned.

264
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,341
You see?

265
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,309
If I were in Italy that top
and that bottom

266
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,911
never would have met.

267
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,312
It's true.

268
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,951
Something to wear
on your next blind date?

269
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,586
That's not funny.

270
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,548
That's a good one.

271
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,759
Hey, my mom just texted, she got
us a gig catering a fundraiser

272
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,026
at an art gallery.

273
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:43,995
She might drive you crazy

274
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,897
but she is definitely
good for business.

275
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,400
Easy for you to say, she's
not micromanaging your life.

276
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,902
Maybe we can use this
opportunity to pass coupons

277
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,237
to the bakery.

278
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,404
Great, so now we're gonna
work for free?

279
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,539
No, on the contrary,

280
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,642
this gig actually affords us
a new oven.

281
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,843
Ok, listen.

282
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,912
I know that this is a long shot,

283
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,014
but I know a guy who knows a guy

284
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,850
who could contact that online
restaurant critic.

285
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,385
The Wandering Gourmet.

286
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,586
Maybe we could get him
to come in.

287
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,421
A positive review
from him would...

288
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,557
Would be like winning
the lottery, I know.

289
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,759
Which is almost impossible.

290
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,162
Have a little faith.

291
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:20,765
On a lighter note,
the gas bill is overdue.

292
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,167
Great.

293
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,346
David?

294
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,114
Can I help you?

295
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,081
My name is Helen Michaels.

296
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,117
I'm actually Claire's mother.

297
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,084
Did something happen?

298
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:40,785
Is she ok?

299
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,586
No, no, no.

300
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,387
Nothing happened.

301
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,421
She's not even here.

302
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,723
She doesn't even know
about us meeting.

303
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,592
You're gonna find
this hilarious,

304
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,896
but I made that profile
on Destiny Match myself.

305
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,399
I was just trying to help her
find a boyfriend.

306
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,934
Can we sit?

307
00:13:58,938 --> 00:13:59,938
Let me just start
by saying...

308
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,807
I know how strange this must
all seem to you.

309
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,376
That would be
an understatement.

310
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,713
Well the truth is
I am not even supposed

311
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,114
to be doing this.

312
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,549
My daughter, Claire,

313
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,051
if she knew I was doing
this again...

314
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,586
Ok, wait, you've done
this before?

315
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,154
Well, only twice.

316
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,656
And it didn't really work out.

317
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,426
Mostly with sons of friends,

318
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,995
relatives of friends,
you know, the usual.

319
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,996
And don't worry,

320
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,799
that actually was her picture
on the profile.

321
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,100
Excuse me, I just need
to ask.

322
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,002
Why are you telling me this?

323
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,771
Well, I suppose because
I wanted you to...

324
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,939
You know what?

325
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,908
I think I'm just gonna cut
my losses and say goodnight.

326
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:37,742
No, no.

327
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:38,409
No, wait.

328
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,644
It was nice to meet you.

329
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,146
Good luck finding
your daughter a date.

330
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,582
You're gonna need it.

331
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,818
Look, everything I wrote about
her was true.

332
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,220
Yeah, you left out the part
about her crazy mother.

333
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,863
Your house chardonnay,
please?

334
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,432
Having a rough night.

335
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,001
You heard all that?

336
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,302
Sorry, it's a quiet bar.

337
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:08,006
Can anyone actually die
of embarrassment?

338
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,042
So let me get
this straight.

339
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,712
You were posing as your daughter
on a dating site?

340
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,713
Yeah.

341
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,649
Yeah.

342
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,184
I'd be mortified if I were her.

343
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,387
I mean, I'm sure your heart
was in the right place.

344
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,857
My heart has a mind
of its own.

345
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,526
Do you mind if I ask
what prompted

346
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,694
this strange behaviour?

347
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,363
I have no idea
what made me do it.

348
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,899
I mean, why did I even
come here tonight?

349
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,201
I promised my daughter
I would back off.

350
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,238
If she found out
she would disown me.

351
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,841
Well, for what it's worth,
my lips are sealed.

352
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,977
She's very pretty, by the way.

353
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:46,911
I'm sorry?

354
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,146
Just your daughter.

355
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,914
I saw a picture of her earlier
when you were showing the...

356
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,349
Yeah.

357
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,419
You're so sweet.

358
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,253
I'm...

359
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,422
I'm Helen, by the way.

360
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,189
Hi.

361
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,425
Eric Carlton.

362
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,493
So, what do you do, Eric?

363
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,562
I'm a pediatrician.

364
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,397
Are you married?

365
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,366
No, Helen, I'm not.

366
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,834
In fact, I'm waiting
for someone.

367
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,436
There she is.

368
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,270
Hey.

369
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,839
Hi, Eric. Sorry I'm late.

370
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:15,907
It's been one of those days.

371
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,075
Did you get a table?

372
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,509
Yes, it'll be ready any minute.

373
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,777
Ok.

374
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,946
And before I forget, I can't
make that artsy fundraiser thing

375
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,415
on Saturday,
something's come up.

376
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,583
Ok, that's fine.

377
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,651
I may need to get this.

378
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,720
I have a patient coming out
of surgery.

379
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,520
Just a second.

380
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,857
This is Doctor Dana Becker.

381
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:33,791
Let me guess.

382
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,127
Your first date?

383
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,396
Second.

384
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,732
It won't last.

385
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,933
Excuse me?

386
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,235
I'm a real estate agent.

387
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,270
After 20 years of selling houses

388
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,706
I can tell which
couples will last.

389
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:53,244
It's the respect, the laughter,
the look in the eyes.

390
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,580
Versus the ones who need me
to sell the house

391
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,748
when they split up.

392
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:01,486
You and Doctor Gorgeous
are not a good match.

393
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,488
Ok.

394
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,591
Let me give you my card.

395
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,493
In case you're in the market.

396
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,402
Who was that woman?

397
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,271
Just a real estate agent.

398
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,040
Trying to sell me something.

399
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,576
<i>Well, you would not believe
the day that I've had;</i>

400
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,980
<i>back to back surgeries
that lasted about six hours</i>

401
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,348
<i>and to top it off...</i>

402
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,165
Hi.

403
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,167
I'm here to see
Dr. Eric Carlton?

404
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,135
And who's the patient?

405
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,537
I'm here alone.

406
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,573
It's a personal Matter.

407
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,007
Just tell him Helen is here.

408
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,141
Helen Michaels.

409
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,843
You're a real estate agent,
right?

410
00:17:58,877 --> 00:17:59,477
That's right.

411
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,344
I'm Donna Stanton.

412
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,746
You sold me my house.

413
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,547
You're kidding!

414
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,248
It was a long time ago.

415
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,917
You helped us get the loan.

416
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,418
We could barely afford
the down payment.

417
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,920
Well isn't that great?

418
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,089
We still live there,
over in Kirkland.

419
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,190
Well, you just made my day.

420
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,225
Donna, I need you to...

421
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:15,893
Hi.

422
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,894
Hi.

423
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,662
Can I... help you?

424
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,563
I'm sorry, Mrs...

425
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,864
Helen. Michaels.

426
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,532
Yes, the real estate agent.

427
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,767
I remember.

428
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,703
I was just thinking about
our discussion the other night

429
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,606
and I was hoping I could buy you
a cup of coffee?

430
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,740
Helen and I go way back.

431
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,942
She sold me my house.

432
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:31,476
Yeah.

433
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,643
You don't say?

434
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:36,547
Well, there's a great coffee
shop just down the block.

435
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,016
Doctor Eric, will you sign
my cast?

436
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,885
You betcha, buddy.

437
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,420
Here, you come over here.

438
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,255
Let's take a look at this.

439
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,591
This is you hitting a homerun.

440
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,025
<i>Coming around first base...</i>

441
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,029
But I don't play baseball.

442
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,931
Ok.

443
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,099
Well, what do you play?

444
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,567
I'm a science nerd.

445
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,368
Good for you.

446
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,736
I was a science nerd.

447
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,771
Alright, then this is you
winning the Nobel Prize

448
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,106
for curing broken arms.

449
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,074
Look at that.

450
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,108
What do you think?

451
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,943
Cool!

452
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,145
No.

453
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,346
What?

454
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Looks like you've got a bit
of an owie behind your ear.

455
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,882
Let me take a look at that.

456
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,416
No, not another one...

457
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,551
There you go.

458
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,452
Thank you!

459
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,620
You're welcome, buddy.

460
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:18,990
That's very cute.

461
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:19,790
Yeah.

462
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,758
So how about it?

463
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,627
A quick cup of coffee?

464
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,794
I want to pitch you something

465
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:29,300
and if you're not interested
you'll never see me again.

466
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,568
You won't regret it.

467
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,669
You won't.

468
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:32,603
Trust her.

469
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,607
She'll find you a home
in no time.

470
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,508
Ok, look.

471
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,077
I can meet you in 20 minutes.

472
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,746
But just for like five minutes.

473
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,214
I'm gonna quit
while I'm ahead.

474
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,851
Just, down the block?

475
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,486
Just down the block.

476
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,993
Why can't I ever meet older,
married women?

477
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,595
Don't start, ok?

478
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,131
She's a real estate agent,
I met her the other night,

479
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,933
she probably just wants to sell
me something.

480
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,001
Your secret
is safe with me.

481
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:12,843
Hey.

482
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,844
Sorry I'm late.

483
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,048
I had a baby with colic
and a sleepless mother.

484
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,683
Claire had colic.

485
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,551
She's over it now.

486
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,752
Forgive me...

487
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,553
I'm just a little hyper.

488
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,523
I've had two cups of coffee.

489
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,359
Ok, let me cut to the chase.

490
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,228
I think you should meet
my daughter.

491
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,195
Yeah, didn't you say
the other night that

492
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,830
she was going to disown you?

493
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,533
She doesn't have
to know about my involvement.

494
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,368
Besides, didn't you say
your lips were sealed?

495
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,371
Yes, well, that's when it
didn't include me.

496
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:46,210
Dr. Carlton, Eric, all you have
to do is cross paths.

497
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,345
You'll see.

498
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,846
I know these things.

499
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,114
Yeah?

500
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,816
You know, I was there
the other night,

501
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,485
I would say that your batting
average is less than stellar.

502
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,654
Well, they can't all be
home runs.

503
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,991
But this, this is a sure thing.

504
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,493
I just know it is.

505
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:07,265
Ok, well... you've got
my curiosity piqued.

506
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,432
What is your plan?

507
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,667
Well, the other night
I overheard

508
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,570
that you were going to the
fundraiser at the gallery?

509
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,537
I was going to.

510
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,740
But I'm not going now,
Dana can't make it.

511
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,675
Now you have a reason to go,

512
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,510
because Claire's gonna be there.

513
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,845
She owns a bakery.

514
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,914
Her and her partner have the
contract to cater the event.

515
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,750
I won't even tell her
you're going.

516
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,251
Or that I even met you.

517
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,155
You go, you meet her,
you decide.

518
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,559
I don't know.

519
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,129
She's funny and kind,
she puts up with me.

520
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,563
Did I mention she's
a pastry chef?

521
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,399
You'll gain a lot of weight
but you'll die happy.

522
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,735
You really
are relentless.

523
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,408
Look, I'm not gonna say yes,
but I will think about it.

524
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,042
Ok.

525
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:51,776
Ok.

526
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,078
Fair enough.

527
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,314
There's just one little hitch,
though.

528
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,448
What?

529
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,584
Claire can't ever know
we spoke.

530
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:04,922
It's much better if she thinks
she just met you by chance.

531
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,557
I'm not that comfortable
lying.

532
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,727
Well, it's not a lie,
it's just something to omit.

533
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,563
You go to the fundraiser,
you meet her,

534
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,165
whatever happens, happens.

535
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,933
I don't know.

536
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,935
Look, you seem like a great guy.

537
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,171
And she is the most incredible
person I know,

538
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,839
and I swear to you I am not
just saying that

539
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:26,610
because I'm her mother.

540
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,146
Let me think about it, ok?

541
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,318
You won't regret it!

542
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,319
I promise!

543
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,088
Goodbye, Helen.

544
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,259
For a used oven it works great.

545
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,029
We're lucky to find one
with such low hours.

546
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,931
Too bad it doesn't come
with customers.

547
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,366
Well, my mom said we
should go all out

548
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,667
for the gallery fundraiser.

549
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,968
I'm thinking petit fours.

550
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,104
Ok. But make sure you use
the glacé

551
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,872
and include the napoleons.

552
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,507
And your mille-feuille
is amazing,

553
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,375
so I'll help you build it.

554
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,509
What?

555
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,778
She wants me to get my hair cut
for the catering gig?

556
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,513
What's wrong with my hair?

557
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,681
Nothing.

558
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,750
But it's your mother
we're talking about.

559
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,821
Hey.

560
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:14,125
So how did you meet the real
estate woman, anyway?

561
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,826
She approached me
at the Chameleon

562
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,862
while I was waiting for Dana.

563
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,629
Yeah.

564
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,997
Dr. Becker.

565
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,165
How's that going?

566
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,702
What, you're not attracted
to pretty and smart?

567
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,936
Of course I am,

568
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,540
it's just that she's kinda cold
and has no sense of humour.

569
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,475
Laughter is overrated.

570
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,178
So, are you buying?

571
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,479
What?

572
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,180
Property.

573
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,182
A house. A condo.

574
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,884
I am not buying a house

575
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,052
and I'm not dating
the real estate agent.

576
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,189
She's just trying
to set me up.

577
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,592
Wants me to...
meet her daughter.

578
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,594
Well Helen did right by me
all those years ago.

579
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,896
I think you should go out
with her.

580
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,063
I don't know.

581
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,532
I feel like if the daughter
is anything like the mom,

582
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,033
she's probably crazy.

583
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,268
You know what?

584
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,036
The way she describes her, she
actually sounds really cool.

585
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,704
My man, don't do it.

586
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,772
It's a mistake.

587
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,240
This from a man who
bought his wife a blender

588
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,608
for their anniversary.

589
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,410
I will have you know that
was the Cadillac of blenders.

590
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,712
Listen, there's no rush
because I have until Saturday,

591
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,281
but I really appreciate

592
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,650
the concern you have
for me, thank you.

593
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,153
What?

594
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,815
<i>This is going to look great
on you at the gallery event</i>

595
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,584
<i>tomorrow night.</i>

596
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,385
It's beautiful, but
I'm just the caterer.

597
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,287
I'm not the belle of the ball.

598
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,589
This is an important event.

599
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,591
Besides, I got it on sale.

600
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,725
I couldn't resist.

601
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,760
Thank you, but
you shouldn't have.

602
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,995
You're a vision.

603
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,498
Now, what are you gonna do
for shoes?

604
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,434
I think I have those
open toed pumps.

605
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,969
No, those are so plain.

606
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,072
That dress requires
a new pair of shoes.

607
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,440
Maybe.

608
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:19,283
♪♪

609
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,446
I wish the event was as big of
a hit as your desserts!

610
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,016
I'll gain five pounds if
I don't watch myself.

611
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,816
Well I'm glad you like them.

612
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,018
I also have a restaurant
downtown...

613
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,586
Hold that thought.

614
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,033
Hi.

615
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,135
Hi.

616
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,570
How is your night going?

617
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,904
<i>Good.</i>

618
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,172
<i>I'm Eric.</i>

619
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,454
Where can I find more?

620
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:31,889
I actually have a
restaurant downtown.

621
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,958
You don't say?

622
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,392
What is it called?

623
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,961
It's called Gilded
Sweets Bakery.

624
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,162
Great name.

625
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,763
Do you have any cards?

626
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,333
As a matter of fact I do.

627
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,403
326 Franklin Street.

628
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,071
Yes.

629
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,405
May I have a card?

630
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,773
You can have this card.

631
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:50,941
I can get another one.

632
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,242
The petit fours are
quite unique.

633
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,277
Yes.

634
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,412
I use almond extract
to counter the sweetness.

635
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,950
Well, all the desserts
are quite exceptional.

636
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,118
I'll have to stop
by sometime.

637
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,655
That would be great.

638
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,358
You have to stop doing that,
I'm going run out of cards.

639
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,759
Ok.

640
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,793
I'll have you know
I am expecting

641
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:10,928
some sort of kick-back.

642
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:15,299
Ok, well you know where I am,
come any time you want.

643
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,802
All the pastries you can eat,
on the house.

644
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:19,903
Great.

645
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,008
It's really thinned out in here,

646
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:28,545
maybe we can take
a look at some art downstairs?

647
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,347
Sure.

648
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,621
What do you see?

649
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:44,728
I see the weird face of a
yellow man about to eat a fish.

650
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,531
While in a burning forest.

651
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,402
That's open for interpretation
I guess.

652
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,003
I guess that's the point.

653
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,875
I have been on my feet all
day and these are new shoes.

654
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:08,052
My gosh, you should take
your shoes off.

655
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:12,523
Art is so much better barefoot.

656
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:16,060
I prefer pieces that depict
the human condition.

657
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,262
Such as...?

658
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,397
Edward Hopper.

659
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,199
Windsor Homer.

660
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,068
Georgia O'Keefe.

661
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:28,439
Artists that break your heart
in the best way.

662
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,008
What about you?

663
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,342
Mine is super corny.

664
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,012
I don't usually divulge
that type of information

665
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,047
on a first date.

666
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,282
That's presumptuous.

667
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,116
Is it?

668
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,920
No, I swear,
I won't judge.

669
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,390
Norman Rockwell.

670
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,359
I like the way he captures
children.

671
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,528
I completely agree.

672
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:56,200
He really captures
people's innocence.

673
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,568
<i>We're closing now.</i>

674
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,802
I wanted to thank you
and let you know

675
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,137
I'll be using you again.

676
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,472
Great.

677
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,407
She's got a little restaurant
downtown.

678
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,708
I'll be sure to stop by.

679
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,110
326 Franklin.

680
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,211
<i>Say hi to your mom.</i>

681
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,712
I will.

682
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,548
My mom got me this gig.

683
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,917
Alright, I really should
pack up.

684
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,754
Ok, well let me help you
pack up.

685
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,156
It's absolutely
not necessary.

686
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,491
No, I'd like to.

687
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,492
Really?

688
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,326
Really.

689
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,094
Ok.

690
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,300
Thanks so much
for your help.

691
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,035
Yeah, you bet.

692
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,439
So... what do you do
with all the leftovers?

693
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,308
Well, unfortunately
they don't really keep.

694
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,077
You don't throw them out,
do you?

695
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,147
Sadly, that's often
what happens, yeah.

696
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,450
I know someone that would
absolutely love those.

697
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,684
It might be a little unorthodox,

698
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,353
but it is worthwhile.

699
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,456
It might just be the best part
of your evening.

700
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,324
I don't know if that's possible

701
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,859
but I'm willing to give it
a shot.

702
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:56,827
Ok, great.

703
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,228
Ok.

704
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,667
Hi, Dr. Carlton.

705
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:04,601
Hi, Emily.

706
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,769
This is my friend, Claire.

707
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,104
Hi.

708
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,372
Hello.

709
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,841
I got stung by a bee
and I'm allergic.

710
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,509
I got all swollen up.

711
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,045
Yeah. But you are gonna be
just fine.

712
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,980
Right?

713
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,682
We brought you some
yummy treats.

714
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,017
How come?

715
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,685
Because you were such
a brave girl.

716
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,519
I was?

717
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,021
Yeah.

718
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,190
My mom says I'm a handful.

719
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,659
Well, you're a brave handful.

720
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,361
Do you wanna try one?

721
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,030
Ok, take your pick.

722
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,098
Good choice.

723
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,303
Did you make this?

724
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,671
I did.

725
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,738
They're really good.

726
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,739
Yeah?

727
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,241
Thank you.

728
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,179
Thank you.

729
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,715
How about I bring you
some more tomorrow.

730
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,317
Would you like that?

731
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,484
Yeah?

732
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,553
You can finish that one
here if you want.

733
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,391
So if you're hungry I'll have
some waiting for you later.

734
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,059
Ok.

735
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,160
Hi, sweetheart.

736
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,561
Hi, mom.

737
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,564
My friend at the gallery
said that you did a great job.

738
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,766
Did you have a good time?

739
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,902
I did except my feet were
killing me.

740
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,837
I had to take off
my new shoes.

741
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,274
I was just walking around
the gallery barefoot.

742
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,208
That's it?

743
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,377
That was the highlight of
your evening?

744
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,679
Pretty much.

745
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,681
That's all you have to tell me?

746
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,550
I mean, I didn't really take
too much to the art.

747
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,352
I'm glad the job went well.

748
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,287
Maybe it'll bring in
some fresh customers.

749
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,421
Yeah.

750
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,090
Maybe it will.

751
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,798
I know nothing.

752
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,103
Ok, ok, you're right.

753
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:46,703
I liked her.

754
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,138
Yep, I knew it.

755
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,640
Tell us everything.

756
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,874
Well, there's actually not
that much to tell.

757
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,309
I mean, we met at the gallery,

758
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,178
got to know each other a little
bit and took leftover pastries

759
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,713
to the kids at the hospital.

760
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,215
Sounds like my kinda date.

761
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,385
Don't listen to him, I think
it sounds romantic.

762
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,452
It actually really was.

763
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,987
And she's ok with letting
her mother

764
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,123
choose her dates for her?

765
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:06,823
Well, that's the problem,

766
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:07,791
she actually doesn't know that.

767
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,092
That is a problem.

768
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,628
I told you it wasn't
gonna work.

769
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,764
What are you gonna do?

770
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,432
I don't know.

771
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,967
I'm sure it'll work itself out.

772
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,671
What?

773
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,808
Ok.

774
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:25,342
Thank you.

775
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,009
Great news.

776
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,010
What?

777
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,679
We actually made more
than we spent yesterday.

778
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,780
That's fantastic.

779
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:30,480
I know.

780
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,049
For the first time like ever,

781
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,984
I actually feel like we have
a fighting chance.

782
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,453
Careful, you're starting
to sound like an optimist.

783
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,422
Well, we keep filling up
the place like we have

784
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,356
for the last couple of days,

785
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,926
you can call me whatever
you want.

786
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,328
Speaking of customers,

787
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,830
is it my imagination or have
we become like the hotspot

788
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,198
for the medical community?

789
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,166
Yeah, I noticed that.

790
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,334
I think it's Eric.

791
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,102
I think he's sending people
our way.

792
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,670
He's really sweet.

793
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:54,805
You like this guy?

794
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,076
I don't know... maybe.

795
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,279
It was just so romantic how
we met at the gallery, but...

796
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,115
I'm still getting to know him,
so time will tell.

797
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,284
I'm just shocked Helen had
nothing to do with it.

798
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,285
I know, can you believe it?

799
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,154
She's gonna kill me when
she finds out.

800
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,389
Wait a minute.

801
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,724
You haven't told her yet?

802
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,258
No. Are you kidding me?

803
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,493
You know how she is.

804
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,997
Besides, I love that
we met by chance.

805
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,567
So for now,
Helen can wait.

806
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,401
Come on.

807
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,736
On y va.

808
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,875
Fancy meeting you here.

809
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,511
Yeah, what are the odds?

810
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,179
I'm sorry, I was in
the neighbourhood

811
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:39,883
and I just had to know
what happened with Claire.

812
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,252
She hasn't mentioned it
and I can't ask.

813
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,086
Ok, seriously.

814
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,521
You just need to let
this thing go.

815
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,723
I promise, I will.

816
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,458
I just need to know
what happened.

817
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:51,695
I liked her.

818
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,930
I knew it!

819
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,532
So you hit it off?

820
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,701
As far as I was concerned,
yeah.

821
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,736
So what's the problem?

822
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:03,173
Honestly? Her mother.

823
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,174
It's true.

824
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,075
You're right.

825
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,044
I'm leaving.

826
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,212
I was never here.

827
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,781
We never had this conversation.

828
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:11,915
I'm serious, Helen.

829
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,183
I think you should call her.

830
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,418
You're the problem!

831
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:15,352
Ok, bye!

832
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,220
Don't forget to call her!

833
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,165
This is the best, and
the messiest, burger

834
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,966
I think I've ever had.

835
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,334
How'd you find this place?

836
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,437
Well, the owner's daughter
was a patient of mine.

837
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,604
Mmmhmm.

838
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,839
He insisted I come down here
and try it out

839
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,075
and I have been hooked
ever since.

840
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,977
Ok, I have to ask. I'm curious.

841
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,379
Why pediatrics?

842
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,315
Well, I think it's
because it's just what

843
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,918
I've always wanted to be
since I was a kid.

844
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,086
What about you?

845
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,888
Why pastry chef?

846
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,492
When I was a kid my mom used
to let me help her make dinner,

847
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,095
and dessert was by far
the most fun to make.

848
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,330
And, I don't know, cookies
became brownies,

849
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,733
brownies became cupcakes,
cupcakes became tarts,

850
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,801
and on and on

851
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,937
until the kitchen was the
best place in the house.

852
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:11,575
I think those were my favourite
memories from my childhood.

853
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,642
I know it's just pastries,

854
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:17,514
but for me it's a form
of expression.

855
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,584
Well, I'm no expert,

856
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,488
but I can tell you that you're
really good at what you do.

857
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,322
Thank you.

858
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,156
What about the restaurant?

859
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,358
How did that transpire?

860
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,627
Well, I went to go look at
places to rent and Marco,

861
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,595
my business partner,

862
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,331
showed up at the exact
same time I did.

863
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,499
We both couldn't afford
the place on our own

864
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,101
so we became partners.

865
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,604
I guess it was just meant to be.

866
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,139
Or just good timing.

867
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,273
I don't know, maybe
it's the same thing.

868
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,343
If you didn't go to the gallery
we would never have met.

869
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,945
And I would not be having
the best hamburger

870
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,347
I have ever had.

871
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,153
Can I ask you something
really serious?

872
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,156
Yeah.

873
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,324
Can we order more
french fries?

874
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,293
Only if we also get
another chocolate shake.

875
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,327
That sounds like a plan.

876
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,996
Yes.

877
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,500
I gotta say, I'm having a really
good time with you, doctor.

878
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,904
I gotta say, I'm having a
good time with you, chef.

879
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,139
What are you doing
Friday night?

880
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,642
I don't know, what am
I doing?

881
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,154
We got it!

882
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,255
We got what?

883
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,392
It's-it's unofficial,
unconfirmed,

884
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,461
but I just got a tip that The
Wandering Gourmet is coming in.

885
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,763
We're gonna get a review.

886
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,065
Hopefully. Probably.

887
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,967
You never
know when.

888
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,735
You don't even know what
the guy looks like.

889
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,404
I mean, he could bust you
or praise you

890
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,638
and you'll never even know
he's here.

891
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,973
Ok, we need to change
our menu.

892
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,842
We just have to pack the place
with satisfied customers,

893
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,944
and maybe your boyfriend
can bring in

894
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:54,945
some more of his friends.

895
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,413
He's not my boyfriend,
we're just dating.

896
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,280
Have you told your mother
about it?

897
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,181
No.

898
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,049
No, as soon as she knows
I like a guy

899
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,750
she starts naming our grandkids.

900
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,986
Ok, but you know how she feels
when you keep her in the dark.

901
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,753
I do.

902
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:04,588
I know that.

903
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,522
We're actually having
lunch today,

904
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,024
I'm sure she's gonna
grill me per usual.

905
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,259
We're gonna get a review!

906
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,126
Yes.

907
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,228
We're gonna get a review!

908
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,631
We need customers!

909
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,366
When are you guys leaving?

910
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,335
As soon as amore mio
picks a date.

911
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,670
You know, if we don't get
tickets soon,

912
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,305
our whole itinerary
gets scrapped.

913
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,841
We're eating our way
across Italy.

914
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,309
You two are such foodies.

915
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,345
I'll probably gain 50 pounds.

916
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,114
Is there any part of this trip
that you like?

917
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,316
I can think of worse ways
to spend my old age.

918
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:33,950
Old age.

919
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,151
My point exactly.

920
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,753
I feel like we're packing it in.

921
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:37,354
Hey.

922
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,088
Hey.

923
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:38,822
Sorry I'm late.

924
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,689
Hey.

925
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:40,624
Marco and I are re-doing
the entire menu

926
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,859
for this phantom reviewer.

927
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,427
He better show up.

928
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,697
Well your tiramisu is
the best on the planet, so...

929
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,133
That's a tiny bit over the top
but I appreciate the sentiment.

930
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,368
Well, hang in there, honey.

931
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,270
Every new business
is slow to take off.

932
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,704
Mushroom risotto?

933
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,139
Just a little bit.

934
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,674
It smells so good.

935
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,510
But I have to get back
to work.

936
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,878
How's my favourite niece?

937
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,482
I am... I'm fine,
Uncle Arnie.

938
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:06,950
Thank you.

939
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:10,787
Jill tells me you met
a nice fellow?

940
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,555
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about.

941
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,391
It's really new so don't get
too excited.

942
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,792
Does this new guy have
a name?

943
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:19,229
Yes, Doctor Eric Carlton.

944
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,897
A doctor.

945
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,265
What field of medicine?

946
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,500
He's a pediatrician.

947
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,869
Well, I like David or Diane
for your first born.

948
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,304
That joke never gets old.

949
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,204
No.

950
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,706
Well, maybe it's not a joke
this time.

951
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,807
I barely know him.

952
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,409
Well, what you know,
you like, right?

953
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,076
Mom?

954
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,911
Take it easy.

955
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,013
You haven't even met him
and you're meddling.

956
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,348
You're right.

957
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:39,215
If it works out, fine.

958
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,151
And if not, no big deal.

959
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,219
More risotto, anyone?

960
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,521
That was way
too matter-of-fact.

961
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,822
Over the top or
matter-of-fact,

962
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:46,923
which do you prefer?

963
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,725
Something in between
would be nice.

964
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,360
Fine.

965
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,495
Name your first born
whatever you please.

966
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,430
Right.

967
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,500
She's also really good
with kids.

968
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,036
Because she gave your patient
a cookie?

969
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,439
Ok, it's just I don't know
how to get around this problem

970
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,406
with her mother.

971
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,674
I don't think you can.

972
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,409
That woman is obsessed.

973
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,011
You're probably right.

974
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,879
I just, I really like this girl,
Nate.

975
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,314
Careful.

976
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,283
The carbs are clouding
your judgement.

977
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,688
How about that guy right there?

978
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,558
That could be him
with his designer glasses.

979
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:22,926
He's meeting somebody.

980
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,630
Look at this guy,
he's definitely a critic.

981
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,466
He's all judgmental.

982
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,570
A critic who's meeting his wife
and baby?

983
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,771
I don't think so.

984
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,809
What about her?

985
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,611
Claire, she comes in every
morning like clockwork.

986
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,947
Double macchiato
and a blueberry scone.

987
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,319
The food was great.

988
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,755
I especially enjoyed
the olive bread.

989
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,457
Thank you.

990
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,926
I really did enjoy the food.

991
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,929
Thank you for coming.

992
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,498
Maybe he's the phantom critic.

993
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,769
Could be.

994
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,072
Thank you for sending
all your friends in.

995
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,673
It was very sweet.

996
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,608
Thank you.

997
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,110
So, your family, do
they live here too?

998
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,211
Connecticut.

999
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,014
Or else I would have sent them
as well, I promise.

1000
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,182
Is that where you grew up?

1001
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,518
Yep, Stanford, Connecticut
since I was three years old.

1002
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,086
That's where my dad did
his residency.

1003
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,321
He's a cardiologist.

1004
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,757
I guess you could say my future
in medicine was inevitable.

1005
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,359
How about your dad?

1006
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,861
He is a financial advisor,

1007
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,097
but he and my mom
are newly retired

1008
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,199
and about to travel
to Italy together.

1009
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:41,104
They actually, they met
in a college bookstore.

1010
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,672
There was one copy of
Room With a View,

1011
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,107
which is set in Italy.

1012
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,277
They both needed it for an exam
so they shared it.

1013
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:51,548
And by the end of the book
they were in love.

1014
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:52,682
That's a great story.

1015
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:53,650
Yeah.

1016
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:57,220
Just think, if the clerk
had more copies,

1017
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,788
I wouldn't be here.

1018
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,490
I think you should track down
that clerk,

1019
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,025
give her a box of your pastries.

1020
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:02,892
It's the least you can do.

1021
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,428
Ok, I'll get right
on that.

1022
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,264
I must look a mess.

1023
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,569
I usually wear half
of what I bake.

1024
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:16,206
I think you look perfect.

1025
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,310
Did I ever tell you when I
was five I had my first eclair?

1026
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:27,217
The waiter was French and I kept
thinking that he said "Claire",

1027
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:31,054
so I thought he'd named
the dessert after me.

1028
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,256
It was hilarious.

1029
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,425
That's hilarious.

1030
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:46,336
<i>Helen.</i>

1031
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,370
Hello.

1032
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,205
What a nice surprise.

1033
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,940
I need to see
you right away.

1034
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,242
<i>Sure.</i>

1035
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,010
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

1036
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,845
Yeah, we-we have a problem.

1037
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,047
But I thought everything
was going so well.

1038
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,450
<i>Yeah, that's the problem.</i>

1039
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:04,721
Perhaps I could show you the
house after you get off work?

1040
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,089
Is Claire there?

1041
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,790
Not exactly.

1042
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,727
I'll be down in just a minute,
Sam.

1043
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:11,594
Your husband?

1044
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,896
Right.

1045
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,298
<i>Can you meet
at the Chameleon?</i>

1046
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,634
Seven o'clock would be
just fine.

1047
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:18,835
<i>Bye.</i>

1048
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,405
I thought we were going out
for dinner?

1049
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,607
It's just a quick showing,
it shouldn't take long.

1050
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,910
I'll meet you
at the restaurant.

1051
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,652
Hey, what's going on?

1052
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:39,255
I think I'm falling
for your daughter.

1053
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,427
And this is a problem
because...?

1054
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:48,898
Because every time she talks
about you and how she and I met,

1055
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,833
I have to lie.

1056
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,636
And she thinks it was fate
that brought us together.

1057
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:54,537
But it was her mother.

1058
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,940
We need to tell her the truth.

1059
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,341
Ok, but please let me do it

1060
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,444
otherwise she will
never forgive me.

1061
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,679
Ok.

1062
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,980
But you have to do it soon,

1063
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,849
because the longer you wait
the bigger the lie becomes

1064
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:07,951
and then neither of us

1065
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,553
are going to be able to save
this relationship.

1066
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,730
The Wandering Gourmet does
not pull any punches.

1067
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,867
Listen to this scathing review
for Etoiles de Danse.

1068
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,203
"I had the misfortune of
ordering the trout almandine

1069
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,938
"which was dry as a bone."

1070
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,106
No, I know that chef.

1071
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,174
Poor guy.

1072
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,375
It gets worse.

1073
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,545
"The fois gras was as
forgettable as the ambiance.

1074
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:40,416
"Cold, bland, no panache."

1075
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:46,055
What if this backfires,
Marco?

1076
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,793
Maybe we should do
something about the lighting.

1077
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,129
Or some fresh flowers,
or maybe some linen...

1078
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,530
Ok, I'm having nightmares
wondering if this guy's

1079
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,532
gonna show up
and ruin our lives.

1080
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,900
Or save us.

1081
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,570
One positive review from this
guy could change everything.

1082
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,805
Well, we're hanging on
by a very thin thread here.

1083
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,974
I say we give the restaurant
a little make-over

1084
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:05,975
before he gets here.

1085
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,377
I knew I should have
become a fireman.

1086
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,211
Hi mom.

1087
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,312
<i>Hi sweetheart.</i>

1088
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,446
I'm kinda busy.

1089
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,481
Can I call you later?

1090
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:12,982
I really need to talk to you.

1091
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,717
<i>Ok, but not now.</i>

1092
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,119
I need to fix up the restaurant.

1093
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,954
I have to go shopping.

1094
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,422
Well, I can go with you.

1095
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,624
Shopping for what?

1096
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,326
Panache.

1097
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,927
I'm on my way.

1098
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,669
Claire and I are going shopping.

1099
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,737
I thought we were going to see
the travel agent today?

1100
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,005
Maybe later.

1101
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,006
Later?

1102
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,041
Don't be like that.

1103
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,075
Claire needs me.

1104
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,577
Well, she's a grown woman,
she can shop alone.

1105
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,779
It's not just that.

1106
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,214
She and I need to have a talk.

1107
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,949
About what?

1108
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,651
This doctor she's been seeing.

1109
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,086
It's just a little girl talk.

1110
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,988
Don't start interfering,
Helen.

1111
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,290
My interfering days are done.

1112
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,758
That's what I wanted
to tell her.

1113
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,295
She knows that you love her,
that's all that matters.

1114
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,368
This would be great
for serving pastries.

1115
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,503
Well, we'll get two.

1116
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,371
They're half off.

1117
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:09,272
Great.

1118
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,673
Look at this tablecloth.

1119
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,710
That's nice.

1120
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,112
Listen.

1121
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,681
I wanted to talk to you
about something, darling.

1122
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,649
About what?

1123
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,317
This doctor you've been dating.

1124
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,685
Eric?

1125
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,786
You're gonna love him.

1126
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,888
He's kind, he's honest.

1127
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,191
I really feel like he's someone
I can trust.

1128
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,560
And did I mention that
he is gorgeous?

1129
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,729
I mean, it was just so romantic
the way we met,

1130
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,464
it's kind of like you and dad.

1131
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:35,865
Just all these people
in the gallery

1132
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,802
and somehow we found each other.

1133
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,739
Clearly we were meant to meet.

1134
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,174
<i>They're practically
giving these away.</i>

1135
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:49,078
What about one of these on
every table with an arrangement?

1136
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:49,846
Maybe not?

1137
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,180
What do you think?

1138
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,548
What do I think?

1139
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,686
I think from now on you should
just make all your own choices.

1140
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,088
Just asking about the vase.

1141
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,925
Aside from my love life, I
really value your opinion, mom.

1142
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,934
Helen is calling Claire now.

1143
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,737
It's a little late in the
game for that, don't you think?

1144
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,339
I know, maybe.

1145
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,473
I mean, I wanted to tell
her myself,

1146
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,109
it's just that Helen insisted
that she tell Claire.

1147
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,077
She's right, you can't come

1148
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,345
between a mother
and her daughter.

1149
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,580
That's right.

1150
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,116
I just wonder why
she's not calling.

1151
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:27,884
Who?

1152
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,752
Helen or Claire?

1153
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,621
To be honest, at this point I'll
take a call from either one.

1154
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:32,522
Look at it this way:

1155
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,023
if it doesn't pan out
with Claire,

1156
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,793
the lovely Doctor Dana Becker
is still waiting in the wings.

1157
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:37,860
I ran into her in the elevator.

1158
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,195
She asked about you.

1159
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,197
I think you're missing
the point.

1160
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,466
He's in love with Claire.

1161
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,735
You're in love with her now?

1162
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,371
Mmmhmm.

1163
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:49,539
I don't know.

1164
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,041
Look, all I know for sure
is I don't want to lose her.

1165
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,075
At all.

1166
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,144
So... do you think
I should call her?

1167
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,049
No!

1168
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:00,950
Yes!

1169
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,554
And so, amore mio,
we start in Venice,

1170
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,922
we head south
to Tuscany...

1171
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,824
muito romantico.

1172
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,126
Si.

1173
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,895
And then Pisa,
and then Florence.

1174
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:18,401
Como estai?

1175
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,603
How are you?

1176
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,572
Don't ask.

1177
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,740
Did everything go ok
with Claire?

1178
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,843
It was fine.

1179
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,645
Just fine?

1180
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,847
There was so much
I wanted to say

1181
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:34,450
and I just couldn't find
the words.

1182
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,452
Now it may be too late.

1183
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:39,856
What do you mean?

1184
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,825
You know, if we go on this trip.

1185
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,126
"If"?

1186
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,163
What happened to "when"?

1187
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,531
There's a lot on my mind,
Sam.

1188
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,534
Can we just-can we talk
about this some other time?

1189
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:58,441
You know, if going to Italy is
going to make you so miserable,

1190
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,275
let's forget it.

1191
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,209
That's not what I mean.

1192
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:03,312
I just wanted to make you
happy and...

1193
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:07,717
I'm not sure I know how to do
that anymore.

1194
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:08,951
If you figure it out,
let me know.

1195
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:09,819
Sam...

1196
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,155
No, I'm not making
any more plans.

1197
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,459
Italy will still be there
next year.

1198
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,928
It's you and me
I'm worried about.

1199
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,251
Hi. What are you doing here?

1200
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,921
I just-I wanted to come
see you.

1201
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,056
Well, hello.

1202
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,258
Hey.

1203
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:50,259
Come in.

1204
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,527
I I tried calling
you earlier.

1205
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,862
My phone died.

1206
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:56,399
It probably went straight
to voice mail.

1207
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,335
Right.

1208
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,436
Yeah, I just...

1209
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,737
I wanted to know how
you were feeling.

1210
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,240
Right now I'm tired.

1211
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,410
I meant about us.

1212
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,882
I don't know what
you want me to say.

1213
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,751
Just the truth.

1214
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,055
The truth is I'm confused.

1215
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,691
And you should be.

1216
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:22,892
Are you confused?

1217
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,593
No, I'm concerned.

1218
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,562
About what?

1219
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,535
Sorry, how-how was...
how was your day today?

1220
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:36,205
I read a horrible review
on another restaurant

1221
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,807
so I decided to spruce
this place up

1222
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:41,143
and my mom and I went shopping.

1223
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,244
Right.

1224
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,213
And how did that go,
with your mom?

1225
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,082
Great.

1226
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:49,251
Good. That's great.

1227
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,219
What?

1228
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,454
My mom and I always go
shopping together.

1229
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,789
Yes, but today went really well.

1230
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,857
Yeah.

1231
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:58,894
Yeah, I got a couple
tablecloths and some trays.

1232
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,696
And-and you're not mad?

1233
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,264
No, I'm not mad.

1234
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,133
They were half price.

1235
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:08,137
And I talked to my mom
and I told her about you

1236
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:12,842
and how we met and they want
to meet you.

1237
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:13,476
That's great.

1238
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,944
Yeah.

1239
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,313
So I was thinking maybe
this weekend?

1240
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:17,947
Fantastic.

1241
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:18,948
Yeah?

1242
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,417
Ok.

1243
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,494
I'm so sorry, I just couldn't
close the deal.

1244
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,195
All you did was shop.

1245
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,296
That's right.

1246
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,664
Thank you for understanding.

1247
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,333
No, I-I don't understand.

1248
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,667
Of course not.

1249
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,136
<i>I'm confused.</i>

1250
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,838
Are you speaking cryptically
or literally?

1251
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,907
Exactly.

1252
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,709
We need to meet.

1253
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:47,410
Great.

1254
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,812
Just text me when and where.

1255
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,081
I appreciate you giving me
a second chance

1256
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:54,216
to earn your business.

1257
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,722
I'm going for a run.

1258
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,824
Now he's going for a run.

1259
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:02,858
Great.

1260
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:07,363
Here we are, almond croissant,
tiramisu.

1261
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,031
Enjoy.

1262
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,246
Do you think that's him?

1263
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,584
I don't know, everyone's
looking like a critic to me now.

1264
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:29,919
Yeah, I got this.

1265
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,020
Yeah?

1266
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,254
Ok.

1267
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,128
Hello.

1268
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,229
How are you?

1269
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,198
Our specials today
are brie and fruit

1270
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,600
with freshly baked
rosemary bread,

1271
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,302
home made scones
with raspberry glaze

1272
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:49,238
and of course our
coconut lime tart.

1273
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,873
Why "of course"?

1274
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,242
Well, because
our coconut lime tart

1275
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,144
is one of our most
popular items.

1276
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,147
So of course it is
one of our specials.

1277
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,014
Very well.

1278
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,283
I'll let you know
when I've decided.

1279
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,651
Great.

1280
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,887
Well, you just take
your time.

1281
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,694
I don't know.

1282
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,065
Marco, he ate the croissant,
every last bite!

1283
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:16,765
Yes.

1284
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,067
And a scone, too.

1285
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,568
Do you think I should offer
him anything else?

1286
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,303
No, we don't want him to suspect
that we know that it's him.

1287
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,239
Let's just let him enjoy
his coffee.

1288
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,840
Ok.

1289
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,614
Who is she?

1290
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,682
I don't know, maybe
it's part of his cover.

1291
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:34,617
Ok, go find out.

1292
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,117
No.

1293
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,685
Go, go, go.

1294
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,689
Hello.

1295
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,191
What can I get you two?

1296
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,792
You must be Claire.

1297
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,128
Yes, I-I am.

1298
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,030
I'm Dr. Carlton's receptionist.

1299
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,200
He suggested me and
my husband come in.

1300
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,869
So you're not a restaurant
critic?

1301
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,671
Excuse me?

1302
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,606
I'm an accountant.

1303
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,275
Great. That's all we needed.

1304
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,076
Excuse me.

1305
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,878
Back away.

1306
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,613
You know, the food is good

1307
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:07,516
but the service is
a little peculiar.

1308
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:10,886
Mom, could you just...

1309
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:11,854
Ok.

1310
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,791
Just one second.

1311
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,493
I guess he hasn't told her yet.

1312
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,495
Who hasn't told who what?

1313
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,164
I completely forgot
I have a showing.

1314
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,633
Ok, well...
call me later?

1315
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:25,901
I have good news.

1316
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,169
What?

1317
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,171
I talked to Eric and we're all
getting together this weekend.

1318
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,673
We are?

1319
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,541
I thought you'd be excited.

1320
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:35,077
I am, very excited!

1321
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,011
Gotta go.

1322
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,546
Ok.

1323
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,855
So why didn't you just tell her?

1324
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,725
I tried, but she kept talking
about you

1325
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,961
and how happy she was.

1326
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:54,230
I just didn't have the heart.

1327
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,431
Or the courage.

1328
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,032
Take your pick.

1329
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,033
The longer we wait...

1330
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,269
I know. I know.

1331
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,541
I went to the bakery today
to try to tell her again,

1332
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,344
but Donna from your office
was there.

1333
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:08,877
What?

1334
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:09,745
Yeah.

1335
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,247
Did she say anything?

1336
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,514
I have no idea.

1337
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:16,218
The second I saw her I
hightailed it out of there.

1338
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,754
This is not gonna end well.

1339
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:27,263
It looks like my meddling
has finally ruined everything.

1340
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,797
No.

1341
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,734
Look, if it wasn't for you I
never would have met Claire

1342
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,670
in the first place so for that,
thank you.

1343
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,267
Hey.

1344
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,302
Hey.

1345
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,403
Looks good.

1346
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:09,938
Nice try, Arnie.

1347
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,573
It's ridiculous.

1348
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,976
I ordered it a month ago
as a surprise for Helen.

1349
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,380
It didn't seem so big online.

1350
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,015
It's nice.

1351
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,485
She'll love it.

1352
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,288
Listen, Sam, I need to talk
to you about something.

1353
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,690
What's up?

1354
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:32,628
Well, I was running some
errands downtown and

1355
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,829
I hope I'm doing
the right thing.

1356
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,166
I saw Helen walking
in Waterfront Park.

1357
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,801
Yeah, so?

1358
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,170
She was with a man.

1359
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,037
Sure.

1360
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:45,307
She meets with clients
all the time.

1361
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,042
Well, this looked like more
than just a client.

1362
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,510
Arnie.

1363
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,679
Whatever it is, it isn't
what you're thinking.

1364
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,549
I took a picture of them
with my phone.

1365
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,784
I printed out a copy.

1366
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,223
I'm sorry, Sam.

1367
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,159
Look, I have no idea who he is,

1368
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,495
but trust me, it's not
what you think.

1369
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,396
You're sure about that?

1370
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,197
Very sure.

1371
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,398
Ok.

1372
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:13,202
But if I know my wife, she's
definitely up to something.

1373
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:14,169
Like what?

1374
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,772
That's what I intend
to find out.

1375
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:19,908
Alright.

1376
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,217
Unbelievable.

1377
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,553
Sam? I'm home.

1378
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,731
I picked up some salmon.

1379
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:19,768
I thought we could marinate it
in a mustard sauce.

1380
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,439
I'm guessing you're not
in the mood for fish?

1381
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:24,973
We need to talk.

1382
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,241
Is this about Italy?

1383
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,410
Italy is the least
of our problems.

1384
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,745
What are you talking about?

1385
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,414
I'm talking about
George and Neil...

1386
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,715
Who?

1387
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,785
And this guy in the park.

1388
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,253
How could you do this
to your own daughter?

1389
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,388
How did you get this?

1390
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,757
Arnie saw you two.

1391
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,724
Who is this guy?

1392
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:43,725
That's Eric.

1393
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,461
Claire's boyfriend?

1394
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:49,498
Sam, I was only trying
to help.

1395
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,106
<i>Tell her Helen, or I will!</i>

1396
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,343
I went online posing as Claire

1397
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:04,880
in the hopes of finding her
a date.

1398
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:07,483
When they found out I was her
mother they ran for the hills.

1399
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,151
As they should have.

1400
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:12,321
Eric was sitting at the bar
watching all of this.

1401
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:16,492
We struck up a conversation
and ten minutes in

1402
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,260
I knew he was
the one for Claire.

1403
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,362
This is so wrong
in so many ways.

1404
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,630
I know.

1405
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,633
They're so perfect together
and I may have ruined it.

1406
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,302
You have to tell Claire.

1407
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,036
I'm serious, Helen.

1408
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:31,139
If you don't, I will.

1409
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:36,678
And this new obsession
with match-making has to stop.

1410
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:40,816
Actually, I've been match-making
since the day we met.

1411
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,751
What are you talking about?

1412
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:45,387
That day at the bookstore?

1413
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,688
Yeah?

1414
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:50,292
There was another copy of
"A Room With a View".

1415
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:53,095
You were so nice and I wanted
to get to know you,

1416
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:56,665
so I hid the other copy.

1417
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,801
So my favourite story
about us is a lie?

1418
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,370
Great.

1419
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,906
I've been carrying around
that secret for 34 years.

1420
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,676
Forgive me if I don't sympathize
with your burden.

1421
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,711
Well, maybe this is
a better story.

1422
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,581
I had an instant crush
and so I acted fast.

1423
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:16,251
And here we are, a
lifetime later, still in love.

1424
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,153
Say what you will about
my methods,

1425
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,756
but sometimes I do get it right.

1426
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:25,193
I doubt your daughter sees
it that way.

1427
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:29,264
You know, the day we met,

1428
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:33,769
you didn't have
to manipulate fate.

1429
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,705
I never would have let
you go.

1430
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:47,549
If you could make a wish
in that fountain,

1431
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,717
what would you wish for?

1432
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,452
An honest wife.

1433
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:51,620
You said that too fast.

1434
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,458
How about you?

1435
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,827
Would you want a wish?

1436
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,897
Yes.

1437
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:05,834
Another 34 years
with the love of my life.

1438
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:14,476
It really is big, isn't it?

1439
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,313
Eric, it's me.

1440
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:18,880
Sam knows.

1441
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:19,915
<i>What?</i>

1442
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,216
He says he's gonna tell
Claire.

1443
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,184
<i>I knew this would happen.</i>

1444
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:48,677
I know I'm preaching
to the choir.

1445
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,979
This review could make
or break us.

1446
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,114
Ok, well maybe we can take

1447
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,216
a few more catering gigs
to stay afloat

1448
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,451
before The Wandering Gourmet
wanders our way.

1449
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,452
What if we're counting
on something

1450
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,520
that's not gonna happen?

1451
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:02,024
I need you to stay positive,
partner.

1452
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,393
Aye, aye, captain.

1453
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:08,830
I think I'll wander home.

1454
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,165
See you in the morning.

1455
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,566
Alright.

1456
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:19,508
I can't give up on you.

1457
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,276
I won't.

1458
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:32,788
Hello?

1459
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:33,388
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

1460
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,122
<i>It's Eric.</i>

1461
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:36,858
Hey.

1462
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:37,826
Hey.

1463
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,594
I hope you start making
a habit out of this.

1464
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,430
I'd like to.

1465
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,331
Do you want some napoleons
or cherry scones?

1466
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,266
Take your pick.

1467
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,067
Maybe later.

1468
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:46,401
Ok, well how about
the hospital?

1469
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,370
We could bring them
to the kids.

1470
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:49,538
Not tonight.

1471
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,573
Alright, well I just have
to get something out front.

1472
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:55,510
Look, Claire, there's something
I need to tell you.

1473
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,979
This happens
all the time.

1474
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,715
Just another thing
to fix and pay for.

1475
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:00,649
Yeah.

1476
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,284
So, look, I-I wanted
to tell you...

1477
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,952
Tell me what?

1478
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:06,688
Just about the night
we met.

1479
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:07,689
Very romantic.

1480
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,059
Yes, it was very romantic,
but...

1481
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,195
it wasn't by accident.

1482
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,297
So you agree with me then?

1483
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,433
Sorry, agree with what?

1484
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,936
That it was fate that
brought us together.

1485
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,472
Here.

1486
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,941
Flashlight on it.

1487
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:26,975
I... have a candle.

1488
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:27,676
That's better.

1489
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,144
It is better.

1490
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:33,982
Great.

1491
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,183
There you go.

1492
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,254
What do we do?

1493
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,389
I don't know,
I'm just a doctor.

1494
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,291
Well, I'm just a baker, so
clearly two professionals

1495
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:46,128
that are completely useless
in this situation.

1496
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:50,932
That's it.

1497
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:51,500
The breaker box.

1498
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:52,768
Where's the breaker box?

1499
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,503
You are smart.

1500
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:55,270
Right?

1501
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:56,471
Ok.

1502
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:01,576
The lights are off
in the kitchen.

1503
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,445
I need to check the fridge.

1504
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,679
It's off!

1505
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:05,914
Everything is going
to spoil!

1506
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,916
I have to call my mom,
she knows a good electrician.

1507
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,121
Are you ok?

1508
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,623
Yeah, yeah I'm good.

1509
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:15,690
<i>Who are you calling?</i>

1510
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:16,658
<i>My mom.</i>

1511
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:17,425
Who is that?

1512
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,460
<i>That's Eric.</i>

1513
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,161
He's there?

1514
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,262
<i>Yes.</i>

1515
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,630
The lights went out
in the bakery.

1516
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:23,698
<i>I'll call my electrician
and send him over.</i>

1517
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,267
<i>Are you ok?</i>

1518
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,168
No.

1519
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:28,336
The electricity went out.

1520
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,438
But nothing else is wrong?

1521
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,907
Isn't that enough?

1522
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:38,513
Sam, she's with Eric.

1523
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,148
Did he tell her about
your match-making?

1524
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,283
Apparently not.

1525
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,185
Maybe I can have the electrician
tell her.

1526
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,453
Joke all you want but
you have to deal with this.

1527
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,421
You, not Eric.

1528
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:47,489
This is your mess.

1529
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:48,723
I know, I know, I just...

1530
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:52,060
I don't know how or when
or what to say.

1531
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,029
More importantly, how are
you going to explain to her

1532
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,697
why you did it?

1533
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,500
I don't wanna go there
right now.

1534
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,535
It's probably because I'd
rather meddle in Claire's life

1535
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,903
than deal with my own.

1536
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:03,538
Well, why don't you try
telling her that?

1537
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,207
It's a good opener.

1538
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,710
Your guy was great.

1539
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,712
It took four hours but he
finally got the lights on.

1540
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,948
Said it was faulty wiring
in the walls.

1541
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:13,949
Eric helped him out.

1542
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:14,916
Speaking of Eric...

1543
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:16,685
And then,
after all that,

1544
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:17,953
he goes back to the hospital

1545
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,788
because a little kid has
an ear infection.

1546
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:20,589
Darling, I...

1547
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:21,590
I love that
he's a pediatrician.

1548
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:24,292
I love... I love
everything about him.

1549
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,260
Hey hon.

1550
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:26,394
Hey.

1551
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,163
Your mother has something
she wants to tell you.

1552
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,866
Well first you
must have a scone.

1553
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,268
I salvaged them
from the fridge.

1554
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,103
They're your reward
for finding him.

1555
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:36,805
Thank you.

1556
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:37,672
Finding who?

1557
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,473
The electrician.

1558
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:41,209
Who do you think
I'm talking about?

1559
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,577
I'll tell her, I promise.

1560
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,012
A full confession.

1561
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,681
It has to be today.

1562
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,283
Mom.

1563
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,788
What is this?

1564
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,925
So you find these guys online,
meet them in a bar,

1565
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,461
and that's how you
found Eric?

1566
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,296
But he wasn't one of those.

1567
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:04,266
Actually, he was there
on a date.

1568
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,102
Ok, so he witnessed
your insanity

1569
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:09,971
and he still thought it was a
good idea to meet your daughter?

1570
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,139
Not quite.

1571
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:12,641
I had to convince him,

1572
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:13,909
so I went to his office and...

1573
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:14,542
You did what?

1574
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:16,745
I'm trying to confess here.

1575
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:22,050
And so I sort of arranged
for you to meet at the gallery.

1576
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,785
But I did not arrange
that magical moment

1577
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:25,754
when you two first
saw each other.

1578
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:28,089
You were there?

1579
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,925
Yes.

1580
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:30,792
She didn't tell me that,
either.

1581
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:31,660
You didn't tell me that.

1582
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,295
Don't blame Eric, blame me.

1583
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:36,231
I can't believe he would sign on
for something so crazy.

1584
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,299
He wanted to tell you.

1585
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,267
Yeah, well he had
ample opportunity.

1586
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,468
He was afraid you'd be mad.

1587
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:42,070
Well I am!

1588
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,571
I am mad!

1589
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,607
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1590
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,642
So am I.

1591
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,366
We could always put up
a sign.

1592
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,302
"Closed due to heartbreak".

1593
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:17,872
No, I'll be fine.

1594
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,141
Maybe.

1595
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:21,910
That bad?

1596
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:28,316
I don't know.

1597
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,353
I think I'd convinced myself
that I had all the time

1598
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:36,157
in the world to find the man
of my dreams

1599
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:39,227
and suddenly he's right
in front of me.

1600
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:42,497
And the fairytale begins,

1601
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:52,207
but lo and behold my mother has
orchestrated the entire thing.

1602
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:58,346
Nothing is ever just my own.

1603
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:02,584
And this time I just don't know
that I can forgive her.

1604
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,860
Is that Eric or your mother?

1605
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,663
Eric.

1606
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:19,200
Sooner or later you're gonna
have to talk to him.

1607
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,805
Not now.

1608
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,775
Not until I figure out
what I'm gonna do.

1609
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,880
Ok.

1610
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,381
I'm gonna go. You need a lift?

1611
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,916
No, I'm good.

1612
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,452
Ok. See you in the morning?

1613
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,421
Yeah.

1614
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:14,656
I had to see you.

1615
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:19,461
I have a long day ahead
of me.

1616
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:20,462
I can come back tonight.

1617
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:24,699
No, I don't think
it's a good idea.

1618
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:28,169
I just need some time
to figure this out.

1619
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,838
We really need to talk.

1620
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,539
I'm not even talking
to my mother right now

1621
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:33,308
and she's my best friend.

1622
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:34,209
Or my worst enemy.

1623
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:35,877
I'm not really sure
which one anymore.

1624
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,379
I just-I feel we owe it
to ourselves

1625
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,949
to see where this goes.

1626
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,118
Don't you?

1627
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,353
I'm sorry, I can't...
I can't do this.

1628
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,055
Claire...

1629
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,465
She won't talk to me.

1630
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,235
She won't talk to me,
either.

1631
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,469
Let's make a pact.

1632
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:02,837
Whoever she forgives first,

1633
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,772
we'll get her to forgive
the other.

1634
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,041
I don't think you and I should
be making any more pacts.

1635
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,177
Yeah, you're right.

1636
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,745
You don't have anything to worry
about, though.

1637
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:14,582
She's gonna forgive you,
you're her mother.

1638
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:16,651
I know how Claire feels.

1639
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,654
I felt the same way
about my mother.

1640
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:22,090
She was always telling me
what to do.

1641
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:25,727
Always trying to plan my life.

1642
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,530
But she meant well.

1643
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:32,300
Sounds to me like you're
just repeating her behaviour.

1644
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,369
Is that your medical opinion,
doctor?

1645
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:38,139
Well, I do deal with
a lot of moms.

1646
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,509
What about your mom?

1647
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:44,245
She is very opinionated.

1648
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,148
But warm.

1649
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,149
Funny.

1650
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,020
Who does that remind me of?

1651
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:03,231
How about that guy
in the corner?

1652
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,800
The one with the bow-tie?

1653
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,236
He's arrogant, he certainly
fits the profile.

1654
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,638
Ok, so we'll just be really,
really nice to him.

1655
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:11,673
Of course.

1656
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:12,941
Because I'm usually so rude
to our customers.

1657
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:13,975
Come on.

1658
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:16,244
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

1659
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,879
She looks familiar.

1660
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,984
I think she's one of
my mom's friends.

1661
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:26,621
Ok, I'll take her, you
concentrate on bow-tie.

1662
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,523
Offer him something
not on the menu.

1663
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:29,824
Ok.

1664
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,594
Hello. May I help you?

1665
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,662
What do you suggest?

1666
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,798
Well I would
strongly suggest

1667
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:40,768
the spinach prosciutto croissant
followed by a chocolate eclair

1668
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:43,738
and I just baked a
beautiful olive bread.

1669
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:45,039
You could always
take that home.

1670
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,107
Alright then.

1671
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,443
I'll have everything
you just recommended.

1672
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,278
I just hope it's as good
as you make it sound.

1673
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:51,913
It will be.

1674
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:55,917
Would you like a pastry?

1675
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:58,219
I think I've had quite enough.

1676
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,187
Great.

1677
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:00,788
Well perhaps I could refill
your coffee?

1678
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,624
No, I'm done.

1679
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:03,591
Thank you.

1680
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:05,360
Ok. Thank you.

1681
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:11,366
Do you think that's him?

1682
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,601
Yeah, bow-tie, arrogant,
it's gotta be him.

1683
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,377
Thank you.

1684
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,554
Did Claire know you were
coming in?

1685
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,424
Probably not.

1686
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,793
She's in the back.

1687
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,194
Thanks.

1688
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:49,804
You weren't answering
your phone

1689
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:52,073
so I thought I'd just drop by.

1690
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,045
I'd like to order some
humble pie, please.

1691
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,080
I really don't have time
for this right now.

1692
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:13,695
I am so sorry, sweetie.

1693
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:14,729
Can you ever forgive me?

1694
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,197
You need to let me live
my own life.

1695
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,999
I know, I will.

1696
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,368
You've said this before
and yet here we are.

1697
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,171
But this time I mean it,
I promise.

1698
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:27,008
No more meddling,
no more blind dates.

1699
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,344
I really think Eric
is the one.

1700
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:30,878
Your promise is barely
ten seconds old

1701
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,880
and already you are giving
me your opinion.

1702
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:36,250
Claire, I'm sorry but I believe
in love and marriage

1703
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,020
and happily ever after,
and I just want that for you!

1704
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,588
So do I!

1705
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:43,558
I want that, too, but I need
to find it on my own.

1706
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:45,526
What if your mom
had hand-picked dad?

1707
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,295
It would have taken the romance
right out of it.

1708
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,230
I need to make
my own mistakes,

1709
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,199
I need to find my own way!

1710
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:52,734
I never realized that I was...

1711
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:56,404
You are pushing me away!

1712
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:58,973
It feels like you don't trust
that I can handle my own life!

1713
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,542
That's not true.

1714
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:03,444
It's just that...

1715
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,747
it's my way
of hanging on.

1716
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,883
Not just to you,
but me.

1717
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,752
The mom you go
shopping with.

1718
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:13,121
The one you call when you need
to share a secret

1719
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:14,422
or need encouragement.

1720
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,558
The mom you need.

1721
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:21,295
Not this woman.

1722
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:26,467
The one who's about to retire
from who she used to be.

1723
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:29,437
You're always gonna
be my mother.

1724
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:32,640
And I'm always going
to need you.

1725
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:35,176
Even if you drive me crazy.

1726
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,149
Are we still allowed to hug?

1727
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,151
Yes.

1728
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:48,289
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1729
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:50,124
It's ok.

1730
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,261
Here you go.

1731
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:54,796
Let me know if you need
anything else.

1732
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:55,396
No.

1733
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,330
I'm fine.

1734
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:57,398
Can I ask you a question?

1735
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,266
Sure.

1736
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,835
Is there always so much drama
in here?

1737
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,939
You have no idea.

1738
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,408
Enjoy.

1739
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:09,710
You know what?

1740
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:10,978
Maybe it's for the best.

1741
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:12,513
I'll just throw all my energy
into my work for a little while.

1742
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:13,781
No, that's a bad idea.

1743
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,550
You have to call her.

1744
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:18,019
Unfortunately I think that ship
has sailed.

1745
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:21,756
You need to stop feeling sorry
for yourself and just call her,

1746
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,524
or she will move on.

1747
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,073
Hi.

1748
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,375
Hey.

1749
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:46,514
Look... I was just hoping
we could talk.

1750
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:48,716
I don't know.

1751
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:51,385
One cup of coffee,
that's all I ask.

1752
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:55,556
<i>You have to let me explain.</i>

1753
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:58,192
<i>Claire... please.</i>

1754
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:00,261
Ok.

1755
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:07,335
I'll meet you in an hour
at that place near your office.

1756
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:08,736
Ok, great.

1757
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,538
Yes.

1758
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:30,258
Mind if I join you?

1759
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,325
Dana.

1760
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,460
Actually...

1761
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:33,594
I'm sorry.

1762
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:35,396
I'm waiting for someone.

1763
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:38,966
Ok.

1764
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,736
I just wanted to make
something clear.

1765
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:42,537
Mmmhmm.

1766
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:44,105
I know I can be
a little removed,

1767
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:48,876
but I'm interested, Eric,
in case it doesn't show.

1768
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:52,813
Dana, I'm seeing someone.

1769
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:56,117
And she's gonna be here
any minute.

1770
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,192
Is it serious?

1771
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,561
It is for me.

1772
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,195
Yeah.

1773
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,733
Good luck.

1774
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,273
Hey.

1775
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,242
Who was that?

1776
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:24,378
That's a doctor I work with.

1777
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,247
Dana.

1778
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:27,348
That look she gave me,

1779
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:31,419
I assumed she was more
than just a colleague.

1780
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:32,620
Were you two dating?

1781
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,322
No.

1782
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,323
I mean, we did.

1783
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,258
It's...

1784
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:39,327
You were with her
when you met my mother.

1785
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,495
Your mom told you I was
on a date that night?

1786
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:42,597
This is a bad idea.

1787
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:43,431
No, look.

1788
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:44,599
We're not dating at all anymore.

1789
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:45,566
It was a couple times.

1790
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,102
It's just you now, I promise.

1791
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:49,036
Claire, please.

1792
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:52,506
Eric, I'm sorry.

1793
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,342
I'm sorry.

1794
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:05,786
What?

1795
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:06,554
We got a review!

1796
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:07,121
What?

1797
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:07,989
What does it say?

1798
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,123
I don't know, my buddy
just texted me.

1799
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,257
I'm just bringing it up
right now.

1800
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,194
Ok, hold on.

1801
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:14,962
"Gilded Sweets Bakery
is a new entry

1802
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:17,064
"into the overcrowded category
of little luncheonettes."

1803
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:18,366
That's not a very good start.

1804
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,266
Yeah, well just keep reading.

1805
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,770
"But this little place
is a gem."

1806
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:23,904
We're a hit!

1807
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:24,805
He likes us!

1808
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,940
Let me read.

1809
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,709
"The olive bread
was the real thing,

1810
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,811
"made with enormous skill."

1811
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:31,846
Your father's recipe.

1812
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,414
And his father before him.

1813
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:34,248
Papa!

1814
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:35,149
They'd be very proud.

1815
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:36,550
Ok.

1816
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,219
"The delicate croissant filled
with spinach and prosciutto

1817
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,754
"was a delightful surprise."

1818
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,589
Wait, he didn't order that,
did he?

1819
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,158
No.

1820
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,559
But I know who did.

1821
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:48,229
The Wandering Gourmet
is a woman!

1822
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:51,265
Well that would explain
the good taste.

1823
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,967
"The chocolate eclair
was beyond compare,

1824
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,935
"traditional yet complex.

1825
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,971
"My compliments to the chef."

1826
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:57,938
Yes, yes, very nice.

1827
01:17:57,973 --> 01:17:59,674
Ok, ok.

1828
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:02,243
"The ambience was
equally appealing

1829
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,578
"and the owners provided
wonderful drama,

1830
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,847
"both in and out of
the kitchen."

1831
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:08,282
My mom is gonna like that.

1832
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:14,255
"I give this wonderful bakery a
very enthusiastic four stars!"

1833
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:16,390
Yes!

1834
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:17,191
That's like the highest ranking!

1835
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:20,361
We did it! We did it!

1836
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:21,295
We did it!

1837
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:23,364
I'm so proud of us!

1838
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:24,265
See?

1839
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:25,566
You always knew it.

1840
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:28,302
We have to get more tables.

1841
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:29,470
And staff.

1842
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:31,739
Thank you.

1843
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:33,274
Maybe we could buy
the place next door.

1844
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:34,608
Now you wanna
spend money?

1845
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,110
Thank you so much.

1846
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:36,744
Can you believe it?

1847
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:37,845
We're out of olive bread.

1848
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,380
I'm gonna have to get baking.

1849
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:40,715
What can I get you?

1850
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,858
Honey, this is delicious.

1851
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,794
I wanted to make something
really special.

1852
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,629
What's the occasion?

1853
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:58,699
Let's just say I've turned over
a new leaf.

1854
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,235
From this point on I plan on
letting things unfold

1855
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,671
without my involvement.

1856
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:05,206
Does Claire know about this?

1857
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,874
She's the one who gave me
my marching orders.

1858
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,878
So I'm to get on with my life
and let her get on with hers.

1859
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,481
She's a wise woman,
that daughter of yours.

1860
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:17,418
If she and Eric ever get
together that'd be great.

1861
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:20,554
From now on, her love life
is none of my business.

1862
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,324
But who I love is up to me.

1863
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:25,693
How's the carbonara?

1864
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,027
I mean, only the Italians

1865
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:30,231
could think of putting bacon
and eggs on pasta.

1866
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,233
Those Italians think
of everything.

1867
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,903
We'll have to go
there sometime.

1868
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,705
Are you ready for dessert?

1869
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,073
We just started dinner.

1870
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,875
I can't wait.

1871
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,748
Cappuccino cannolis,
a present from Claire.

1872
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:53,387
And here is a little something
from me.

1873
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:54,889
What is this?

1874
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,032
Two tickets to Venice?

1875
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:08,102
Then Tuscany, then the coast,

1876
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:13,274
then wherever you want
to go, Mr. Michaels.

1877
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,476
I don't care where I go,

1878
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:22,983
as long as you're beside me,
Mrs. Michaels.

1879
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:30,791
And then we finish the trip
in Florence.

1880
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,660
I can't believe you guys
are leaving so soon.

1881
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:34,929
Yep, one week from tomorrow.

1882
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:37,097
I almost wish we were
there already.

1883
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:40,734
Oooh.

1884
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,137
Claire, that's beautiful.

1885
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,844
Hello.

1886
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:50,911
Hi.

1887
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:52,813
I just wanted to thank you
for that lovely review.

1888
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,148
No thanks necessary.

1889
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:55,349
You deserved it.

1890
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:57,451
Just promise me you won't
give away my identity.

1891
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,586
No problem.

1892
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:01,021
I'm just happy it looks
like you're becoming a regular.

1893
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:02,256
Are you kidding me?

1894
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,692
This is the best show
in town.

1895
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:08,996
Yes, Claire's life is
very entertaining,

1896
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,933
and it looks like another show
is about to begin.

1897
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:14,835
I'll get more plates.

1898
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:21,675
Eric, please don't do this.

1899
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,278
I'm trying to get over you.

1900
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:27,414
How do you get over
what's meant to be?

1901
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:35,289
I thought you didn't believe
in destiny.

1902
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:36,657
I don't.

1903
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:40,060
Then what are you doing here?

1904
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:45,266
I'm here for you
and I'm here for us.

1905
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,166
Come on, Claire.

1906
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,701
Meet him halfway.

1907
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,670
Eric...

1908
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:53,040
Look. You can call it fate
or your mother's intuition

1909
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,009
or a coincidence that brought us
together,

1910
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:58,913
but it doesn't matter how we got
here because all I know

1911
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:04,351
is that I love you and I don't
ever want to lose you again.

1912
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:11,859
Would you just kiss
her already?

1913
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:22,002
Should we make her wait?

1914
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:24,605
She can wait,

1915
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,174
but I can't.

1916
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:52,700
You're so romantic.

1917
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:56,201
Subrip: Pix
