Well. l'm wondering too
because this really wasn't part of the plan.

And then l found the town ma_er.

See. we've been on the run from an incident

...while tying to keep a low profile
from the police.

92
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,767
But l'm getting ahead of myself.

93
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,133
Let me keep it simple for now.

94

l was sent out to look for help.

95
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:16,568

and l was wondering if you could help.

100
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,333
- You're American...

101
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:48,968
- You wouldn't happen to know anybody
by the name of Manderson?

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,268
(soft piano music)
- Can't say l do.

103
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:56,968
A distant relative of yours?
- Something like that.

104
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,067
(woman): Do you know of a Manderson?

105
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,633
(man): Who?

106
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:05,534
- If you like l could ask my husband
when he comes back.

107
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,468
He knows everybody about town.
He should only be a few minutes.

108
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,333
- Yeah...

109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,135

- Great, take a seat.

110
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:15,666

Ahem!

114
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,566
Don't mind them.

115
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:50,435
They don't mean anything by it,
especially my mom.

116
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,001
We don't get too many people
passing through here.

117
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:56,399
- Is this your mom's place?

118
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:57,866
- Mom and Dad's.

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,368
That's him in the back.

120
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,134
So, are you on holiday or...?

121
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:07,034
- Y-yeah, just having some car trouble
at the moment.

122
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:09,634
- Well, l play a mean game

hijacking a car,

l got to be going though.

131
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:32,833
- What a shame.

132
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,033
- What do you say, Mother?

133
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:49,767
- Quitting time already, Constable?
- Give or take an hour.

134
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:55,868
Since l'm a one-man show around here,
l think l'll forgive myself this one time...

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,868
- And every day since you started.

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,334
The usual?
- Yeah.

137
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:04,333
Thanks.

138
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,666
How are you, Father?

139
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,167
- Can't complain, Constable.

140
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:10,500
- And where is that...

141
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:12,800
beautiful daughter of yours?

142
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:18,668
Good evening, Riley.
- Good evening to you, Constable.

143
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:29,500
This one's on the house.

144
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,667
- Thanks, but... l need to go.
- Oh...

145
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,834
- Who's your new friend, Riley?

146
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:39,469
- Here on holiday but seems to be having
a bit of car trouble?

147
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,833
- Do l know you, friend?

148
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,267
- Nah, ah... l don't think you do.

149
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,500
- No.

150
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:49,566
l swear l've seen you before.

151
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:00,566
What's the nature of your visit?

152
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,169
- l've just told you, he's on holiday.
- Leave the lad alone, James,

153
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,967
he's just passing through.

154
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:10,500
- Do you have family around here?

155
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,736
- Look, friend, l already told you,
you don't know me.

156
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:16,967
- Is that so?

157
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:19,666
- l'll just be on my way.

158
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,903
- Do you mind... if l take a look
at your passport?

159
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,734
- Ugh, give it up, James.
You're a volunteer o_icer.

160
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:29,034
Why would you need to look
at the boy's passport?

161
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,499
lt's not impressing me, you know.

162
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:31,899
- Mind your business!

163
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:33,699
All of you!

164
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:41,701
(American man): They always have
that same look on their face...

165
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,367
No one ever sees it coming
before it's too late.

166
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,933
(bone cracking)
(Riley): Ah!

167
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:50,101
- Like l said.
it wasn't really part ofthe plan.

168
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,134
(gun cocking)
Look, l don't want to hurt anybody else.

169
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,500
Behind the bar, come on!

170
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,900
Not you.

171
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,033
- We don't have much money, son.

172
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:13,433
- l don't want your money.
- If it isn't money,

173
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:14,667
what do you want?

174
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,132
- Lock the doors.

175
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:33,167

- Hello?

181
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,534
(sighing)

182
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,502
(groaning)
Who is this?

183
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,667
Yeah, is Wendell--
(dead tone)

184
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:07,500
(groaning in pleasure)

185
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,868
- Was that the phone?
It's hard to hear down there.

186
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,501
- Time for my medicine.

187
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:24,768
- Ooh... your medicine?

188
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,933
- Ah!

189
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:29,999
- Ah...

190
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:34,069
(American man): The two in the costumes
are my brother and sister. Me twins.

191
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:37,868
Yeah. l know...
But more about them later.

192
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,337
- Yes, sweetie, here's your absinthe.

193
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:55,000
(phone ringing)

194
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:02,533
- Yeah?
- WendeII...

195
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:04,566

196
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,366
lt's Francis.

197
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:07,833
Hey, hey, bud!

198
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:10,968
- l've got a bit of a problem over here
so there's a change in plans.

199
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,367
l'm coming to you.
- You're coming to France?

200
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:17,269
- l don't exactly have time to talk about it
right now. Wendell.

201
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,367
l'm not sure when l'm gonna get
to another phone,

202
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,367
so l need you to hang tight
for a little bit. Can you do that?

203
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:24,167
- Okay, bud, well, yeah, l'm here, man.

204
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,166
- Okay, we'll see you...
(dead tone)

205
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,666
...SOOn.

206
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,100
- Less talk, more play.

207
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:47,134
- Playtime is over, sweetie.

208
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,268
(growling, snarling)

209
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,569
(woman screaming)

210
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,902
(knocking on door)

211
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:06,267
(snarling)

212
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:09,299
(in French)

213
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:17,000
(growling)
(man screaming)

214
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:19,666
- You got a car?

215
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,600
(engine revving)

216
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:37,535
(hip-hop music)

217
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,667
(music stops)

218
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:55,334
(knocking on door)
Tell them you're closed.

219
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:56,934
- You don't understand,
they're my older brothers,

220
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:59,600
they won't leave.
(man outside): What's going on in there?

221
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:02,367
(knocking on door)
- Open the door...

222
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,300
(man outside): Open the door!
Come on!

223
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:05,499
- Slowly.

224
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:08,833
- Hey, what the fuck?

225
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:11,335
Why's the pub shut?
It's the middle of the fucking day.

226
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:12,867
- Check it out.

227
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,334
(Riley): Boys...

228
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:17,700
- Sit down.

229
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,100
- Who the fuck are you?

230
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:23,167
- Sit... down.

231
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:33,466
- Of course.

232
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:41,532
- Grab that tape.

233
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,534
Just a couple of seconds,
and we'll be on our way.

234
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,666
- Alright.

235
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:58,501
So you're just going to waltz out of here
with our baby sister, then?

236
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,336
- That's the plan.
- Looks like you've got it all figured out.

237
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:03,433
Me and my brother...

238
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,467
Oh my, where are my manners?

239
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:11,469
My name is lan.
This here is my brother, Cole.

240
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,701
Looks like you've met
the rest of my family.

241
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,501
- Let's go.

242
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,800
(tape ripping)

243
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,334
- Should've used more tape.

244
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,500
- l would be careful.

245
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,334
- Or perhaps you should be careful.

246
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:39,167
tfrancis)_. l should probably
back up here a minute.

247
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:42,334
See. this isn't exactly
how l ended up in here.

248
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:46,034
Maybe we should start
at Me beginning beginning.

249
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:50,467
(lively guitar music)

250
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:03,201
As always in my life,
eveything begins with my family.

251
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,701
My broMers. sister. and l

252
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,368
been moving from town to town
Iooking for a place to call home.

253
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,166
A place to belong.

254
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,400
You know. we've been close a few times.

255
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:16,534
but there's something
you may not know about us.

256
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,267
We live with a disease.

257
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:22,167
A disease we can't run from
even if we tried.

258
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:23,900
You know. sometimes it feels

259
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,800
like it's the only thing
keeping us togeMer.

260
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,400
That. and our family blood.

261
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:32,301
See. after our parents died.
we were Ieft to fend for ourseIves.

262
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,634
So now we're all alone with our curse.

263
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:37,833
Our burden.

264
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:43,035
Even though we have each other.
it can be a vey lonely existence.

265
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:49,634
(western music playing)

266
00:19:58,966 --> 00:19:59,900
(woman sighing)

267
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:04,166
(man inside): Hello?

268
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:07,901
- Francis! Pay the guy, will you?

269
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,967
tfrancis)_. David is my oldest brother.

270
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,868
He used to be a lot more uptight
before the Hawaiian shirts.

271
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:15,901
He's always felt responsible
to plan our lives out.

272
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:17,600
to make sure we keep it together.

273
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:20,533
- How's it going, man?
- Alright.

274
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,000
- l'm gonna do a pack of lights.

275
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:33,168
And the rest on... pump two.
- You got it.

276
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,633
- You ready?

277
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:43,668
- Yo, this place is great, man.
Black Life Magazine?

278
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,834
l haven't seen this
since the nineties, man.

279
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:49,001
tfrancis)_. This is my other older brother.
Wendell.

280
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,402
He's one of the twins and not what you call
''completely there.''

281
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,500
A bit of a loose cannon.

282
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,768
Best to stay out of his way.

283
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,367
(boy): Yeah, well, you got the good one.

284
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:05,202
l have to get closer in,
'cause you're shooting further.

285
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,701
(man): Bang! Bang!

286
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,334
(man laughing)

287
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:10,934
Bang! Oh!

288
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:12,166
Whew!

289
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:15,667
You know, you might be
the prettiest thing l've seen

290
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,634
in a long while.

291
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,534
- l'll rip your heart out
and swallow it whole

292
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,635
before you wipe that smile om your face.
(man): Ho!

293
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:26,667
(Francis)_. My sister Darlene.

294
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,302
Be warned. she usually means
exactly what she says.

295
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:32,100
She's the other twin.

296
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:34,500
As you already saw.
Darlene and my brother Wendell

297
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:36,367
do practically eveyMing together.

298
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:39,701
- Alright, Little Man Lenny,

299
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,801
you're going down.

300
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,602
(Francis): Before they died.
our parents raised us out on a farm...

301
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,633
...secluded from eveything.

302
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,568
They tried to protect us from the world
because we were different.

303
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,768
But l was starting to see it was the world
that needed protecting from us.

304
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,035
Our mother never really talked much
about her past.

305
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,334
She felt we should just...

306
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,534
...create our own stoy. instead.

307
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:06,433
Maybe she was right.

308
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:08,733
We were on our own now and...

309
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:11,501
...things couldn't stay the same.

310
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,800
- Don't move.

311
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:18,599
- Or what?

312
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:21,401
- l'll be forced to shoot you...

313
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,035
...again.
- Oh yeah?

314
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:26,600
And finally.
this is my little brother Lenny.

315
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:29,867
He was innocent of all this
before it went bad.

316
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,668
Shit...
- What?

317
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,266
- Don't move.

318
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,501
- l let you take it.
- Oh yeah?

319
00:22:41,632 --> 00:22:42,733
- Yeah.

320
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,467
- l love you.
- Love you, too.

321
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:04,299
(man): ...like real guys!
(laughter)

322
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,101
(man): ...like real guys!
(laughter)

323
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:08,367
- Let's do it again, let's do it again,
Iet's do it!

324
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:09,499
- For twenty bucks this time.
- Alright, alright, alright.

325
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:10,866
- Oh really?
- Me and you, buddy, me and you.

326
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,702
- l got you. The game is called
Two up, two down.

327
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,702
- Twenty! Me and you.
- You're on!

328
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,867
- Let's go!

329
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,801
- Okay, on the count of three, go!

330
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:24,400
Ah!
- Whoa!

331
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:25,699
(women screaming)

332
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,301
- Everyone on the floor!

333
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,267
- You too!
Think you're special, old man?

334
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
- Get down!

335
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:37,366
l said now, asshole!

336
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:50,166
- Where's Wendell?

337
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,701
- Uh, probably in the bar.
Why, you want me to go get him?

338
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,601
- No, l got him.
- No, Lenny!

339

l got him.

340
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,435
- Yeah, man, do your thing.

341
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:15,500
- Open the register!

342
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:20,603
Come on, hurry up, man!
- Hey! And don't forget about the safe.

343
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,433
(Lenny screaming)

344
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,300
- Lenny! Lenny! Buddy!

345
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:41,634
- What the fuck did you do, man?
- Argh!

346
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,733
(Wendell snarling)

347
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:46,168
- What the fuck?!
- Aaah!

348
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:47,667
(country music)

349
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:53,133
And your baby's left you

350
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:55,834
(growling)

351
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,434
And my baby loves me
- You're gonna be okay...

352
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:03,700
You're gonna be okay...

353
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,401
(screaming in pain, Wendell growling)

354
00:25:05,532 --> 00:25:06,499
(gunshot)

355
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,868
- No, please, no!!!

356
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:12,766
(screaming)

357
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:24,167
- What are you?!

358
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,366
You're monsters!

359
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,167
Monsters!

360
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:29,800
(snarling)

361
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:33,833
- Yes, we are.

362
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,100
(screaming loudly)

363
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:40,033
There's one thing l left out.

364
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,267
We need blood to su_ive.

365
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:45,834
Our disease makes us kill to live.

366
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,101
We're that kind ofmonster.

367
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,701
We never lost control before.

368
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,667
And this time.
we had nowhere else to run.

369
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,269
- This is Angela Robbins reporting live
from Mojave, California.

370
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,200
Behind me is the Four Aces Motel...

371
00:26:16,332 --> 00:26:19,768
(Francis)_. The su_eillance footage
of Me murders was aII over Me news.

372
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:21,533
lt went global.

373
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:25,036
They knew who we were.
just not what we were.

374
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:28,902
- Authorities are now turning to the public
for help in locating the family responsible

375
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:31,734
for what some are calling
The Vampire Killings,

376
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,534
due to the strange bite marks
Ieft behind...

377
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,168
(Francis)_. They called it
The Vampire Killings.

378
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,370
Thought we were some kind of stupid cult
or passionate Twilight lovers.

379
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,868
Pretty ironic.
(sirens wailing)

380
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,703
The only place my parents ever mentioned
coming from was overseas.

381
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,834
so we travelled across the Atlantic.

382
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:51,866
staying well-hidden.

383
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,535
tying to keep my dying brother alive
on human blood.

384
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,034
The twins were searching for help
in france

385
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:00,301
while my brother David
had been looking for contacts in England.

386
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:05,169
But so far. everything was a joke.
or a dead end.

387
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:07,333
(whispering): Hey!

388
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:10,934
You gotta settle down
or you're gonna wake him up.

389
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,167
(phone ringing)

390
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,834
(Francis): You see.
we're not like you think we are.

391
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:22,033
We were born. not made.

392
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,000
We walk in the sun.

393
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:29,534
And we don't crumble at crucifixes
as we are not the undead.

394
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:33,867
We can get hurt. or die like anybody else.

395
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:40,003
But something does happen when you solely
feed off the life source of another.

396
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,201
You feel differently.

397
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:46,000
Eveything is amplified.

398
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,101
Maybe that's the only reason
why my brother Lenny

399
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:51,866
had even lasted this long.

400
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:55,701
We didn't know because our parents
never taught us

401
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,634
how to su_ive this kind of thing.

402
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,100
l guess there's this...

403
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:10,567
...part of me that hopes
he doesn't even make it...

404
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:12,800
How he can be spared...

405
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:16,201
- Don't you ever say that to me again.

406
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:18,400
This wasn't supposed to happen.

407
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,000
- l said ''part of me''.

408
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,401
l love him just as much as you do,
Dave,

409
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:28,002
but the truth is your dream of a happy life
doesn't exist for us.

410
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,868
We're just cold-blooded killers,
nothing more.

411
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,702
- Is this even about Lenny
or is this about you, Francis?

412
00:28:44,632 --> 00:28:45,666
Manderson.

413
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,201
The contact said to drive a couple hours
north into the countryside,

414
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:51,567
there's a town called Ludlow

415
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:54,902
and you ask for Manderson.
- And we can trust this?

416
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:58,702
- What other choice do we have?
Twins haven't found anything.

417
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,100
lt's the only lead we have.

418
00:29:04,332 --> 00:29:05,800
New Interpol list is out.

419
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,199
- l'll leave later today.

420
00:29:15,432 --> 00:29:17,867
So this is about
where we Ieft off Iast time.

421
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,968
l'd headed out looking for Manderson...

422
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:25,636
...wondering if there were others out there.
and ifthere were. could we trust them?

423
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:33,269
But that doesn't really explain
how l got in here. does it?

424
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,167
Lemme bring you up to speed.

425
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:39,000
Where did l leave off?

426
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:43,501
Oh yeah. l had been knocked out in the pub
after a shotgun to the head.

427
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:47,001
(man): It's been five cycles,
the breathing won't take.

428
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:48,499
(woman): She's useless.

429
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:52,836
At least we have something
we can replace her with now.

430
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:56,033
(man): We'd better prepare.

431
00:29:56,165 --> 00:29:57,499
(woman whimpering feebly)

432
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:11,600
(coughing)

433
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,499
(chains rattling)

434
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,933
(door opening)

435
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:48,633
(growling)

436
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:51,500
(laughing)

437
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:57,667
- l'm sorry for the treatment,
but you must understand

438
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,934
that we didn't know
ifwe could trust you or not.

439
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,668
- l'm in a fucking cage.

440
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:05,534
You let me kill a cop in broad daylight.

441
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:09,636
- We needed to see what you were capable of,
Francis, and l've a family to protect.

442
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,768
Our kind do not have usually
the best intentions...

443
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,101
...so we must choose carefully
those whom we help.

444
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:20,833
- Our kind.

445
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,334
You were testing me.

446
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:28,367
So you're Manderson.

447
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,769
- Well, let's just say it's a word
we like to use around here.

448
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,533
- l'm sorry about your face.

449
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,966
l promise l'll play nice next time.

450
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,601
- There won't be a next time.

451
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:55,302
The constable?
Nobody's going to come looking for him?

452
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,434
- The constable had a nasty accident.

453
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:01,467
He left the pub terribly intoxicated.

454
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:06,669
We fear he stumbled into
a rather deep ravine, snapping his neck.

455
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:09,234
- All those people in the bar...

456
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:12,233
They saw everything.

457
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,533
- Well, let's just say a portion of this town

458
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,267
was founded on the same needs
you and l share,

459
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,968
and certain arrangements were made.

460
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This way.

461
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,000
(thud!)
- Sorry, mate.

462
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:37,002
- We'll get you fed, son,
and straighten this whole thing out.

463
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:41,466
- Ah!

464
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:43,766
- Still got a bit of spirit in you?

465
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,534
(woman shouting)

466
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,034
A little bit deep. Sorry, love. Sorry.

467
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:58,600
(soft piano music)

468
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:13,000
- Welcome to our home, Francis.

469
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:16,668
The guest room is ready,
and there are some fresh towels on the bed.

470
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:20,367
l might have left you
a little something on the nightstand,

471
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,334
just to tide you over.

472
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:26,002
- Okay, Mother, let the boy be.
We have things to discuss.

473
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:28,734
- Well, remember, dinner will be served
at eight o'clock sharp.

474
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:32,100
- Thank you.

475
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,335
- Come along, Francis.
We have much to do.

476
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:48,868
- We've been mostly moving
from town to town since they died.

477
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,736
- Well, l'm sure things must have been
di_icult with your parents passing.

478
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,001
And you've made quite a mess of things
over there in the States.

479
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:58,867
To be quite honest with you,
we had no idea who, or what,

480
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,835
would walk through our door.

481
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:02,500
- We've never asked for help.

482
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:05,101
Our little brother Lenny,
we didn't know what to do.

483
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:08,569
We weren't even sure others existed.

484
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:12,269
- Well, rest assured, you're not alone.
And we take care of our own here.

485
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,833
Now listen carefully.

486
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:17,266
This is what l need you to do.

487
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,869
Have Me twins. Wendell and Darlene.
come here immediately.

488
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:22,900
There's no time to waste.

489
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:27,202
Then, instruct David to stay put
with your younger brother.

490
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:32,168
l'll send my colleague Cyrus to London
and bring them safely back here.

491
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,634
Everything's going to be alright, son.

492
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:39,100
There's no need to run anymore.

493
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:41,666
You've come home.

494
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:51,970
tfrancis)_. l didn't find the Mandersons.
but maybe something better instead.

495
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,267
They said they would send help to Lenny.

496
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,701
Wendell and Darlene would be here
in the morning.

497
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,536
Eveything was going to be okay.
and my family was going to be safe.

498
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:10,702
lt made me Mink about all ofus
being together again and how we used to be.

499
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:15,168
But maybe it was time to let the past go...

500
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,668
...so something new could take its place...

501
00:35:20,332 --> 00:35:22,467
...bring life back to a place
that had been missing.

502
00:35:24,632 --> 00:35:26,433
lt felt like we had finally
belonged somewhere again.

503
00:35:29,165 --> 00:35:30,366
- Have a seat, Francis.

504
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,132
- Thank you.

505
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:44,034
- Did you follow through
of what we discussed?

506
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,869
- Twins are on their way
and David's staying put as instructed.

507
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,434
- Oy!

508
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:54,034
- Boys, settle!
Where are your manners?

509
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:58,302
lf l didn't love these boys so much,
l think l'd kill them myself.

510
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:04,000
(whispering): Your hand...

511
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:12,202
- We would like to give thanks
for the bountiful food before us,

512
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:14,567
our family, our health,

513
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:17,635
and our new friendships
that l feel certain that will bring us joy...

514
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:20,767
...and only make us stronger.

515
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:22,533
Amen.

516
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:23,633
(everyone): Amen.

517
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:38,167
- What's the matter?
My mother's cooking

518
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,833
isn't good enough for you, mate?

519
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,368
- Naughty, Pumpkin!
Be polite.

520
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,734
- Eat up, then.
- Leave him alone.

521
00:36:50,332 --> 00:36:51,800
- And who do you think you are?

522
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,368
What right do you have
to speak to me like that?

523
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:57,501
- He's our guest, Cole?
- Enough!

524
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,768
Why don't you get started
in the kitchen?

525
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:09,133
Haven't you trained your body to eat?

526
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:12,400
- Well, l get sick, don't you?

527
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:14,200
- Part of living among others in this world

528
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,200
is presenting the idea
that you're no di_erent.

529
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:19,601
- We put on our fair share
of charades, but...

530
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,167
...there's just nobody here.

531
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,834
- That's the lack of discipline
that landed you here.

532
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:40,233
(eerie voices)

533
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:53,001
(womanly voice)

534
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:29,633
(loud growling)

535
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:31,099
- Ah!

536
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,000
(Francis gasping)

537
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,001
(panting)

538
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:41,633
What are you doing in here?

539
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:44,768
- Actually, l was going to kill you,
but l changed my mind.

540
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:47,201
Thought we could have a bit of fun first?

541
00:38:47,332 --> 00:38:48,933
- What is this, your way of playing nice?

542
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:52,201
- Seems like you were having
a pretty intense dream there.

543
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:54,499
- Well, that's funny.

544
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:01,499
You were actually in my dream.

545
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:07,202
Your fangs came out,
and you bled me dry.

546
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:12,202
- Well, that's silly. l don't drink blood,
or have fangs, for that matter.

547
00:39:12,332 --> 00:39:13,733
- What do you mean?

548
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:15,834
- l never turned.

549
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:20,402
Whatever gene you or my family has,
itjust never took with me.

550
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,433
l share the same blood but...

551
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:25,299
- You're lucky.

552
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:32,502
- Would you like to go
on a walk with me, Francis?

553
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:43,933
lt's safe, trust me.

554
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:55,967
(traditional music, laughter)

555
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,801
These people want to disappear
more than you do.

556
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:13,034
They won't bother us.

557
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,167
Dance with me?

558
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:21,634
(soft music)

559
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,500
Have you ever danced
with anyone before?

560
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:33,000
Dance with me, Francis.

561
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:43,302
You have to loosen up,
you're so serious.

562
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,866
- You really don't need blood?

563
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,667
- Does this mean
you don't like me anymore?

564
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:55,500
- l'm just curious.

565
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:59,702
- They say some of us can turn
as late as nine or ten,

566
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,936
but l'm past that now so...
l'll always be like this.

567
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:13,367
Don't even think about biting me.

568
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:16,401
Doesn't work.
It's been done before.

569
00:41:33,632 --> 00:41:35,767
(laughter)

570
00:41:43,165 --> 00:41:45,000
(urinating)

571
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,935
(coughing)

572
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:01,733
- Where'd you go?

573
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:03,833
Where is she?

574
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:11,100
(belching)

575
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:15,902
Now... this is not a safe place...

576
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:21,536
...for a very, very pretty young girl...

577
00:42:22,132 --> 00:42:25,235
...to be playing... pattycake.

578
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,067
- Oh, l know.

579
00:42:28,332 --> 00:42:29,966
But l like to be afraid.

580
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:32,866
Roughened up, even...

581
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,967
- Oh well, then...

582
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:37,834
Aah!

583
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:44,834
(enraged shouting)
(man groaning)

584
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:53,600
- Hungry?

585
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:56,634
Whatever droplets my parents gave you
can't be enough.

586
00:42:57,332 --> 00:42:59,801
Until they completely trust you,
they'll keep you barely fed.

587
00:43:00,632 --> 00:43:03,668
- They've been kind enough.
l can take care of myself.

588
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:08,969
- You gave me a dance,
l made you dinner. Like a real date.

589
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:13,599
- You're something else.

590
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:18,001
- You don't have to hold yourself back
anymore, Francis.

591
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:21,667
This is okay.
It's what we do.

592
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:30,868
(man screaming, Francis growling)

593
00:43:32,232 --> 00:43:35,568
We have a few places where
we've worked out deals with the owners.

594
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:38,334
Comes in handy for emergencies
or when hunting is slow...

595
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:40,334
- When hunting is slow?
- Mm-hmm.

596
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:42,868
- You don't have our burden,
so why do you even do it?

597
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,935
- Hunting is the least l can do
for my family.

598
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,468
Otherwise, what good am l to them?

599
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,367
l refuse to be insignificant.

600
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,168
- You don't owe your family anything
for being di_erent.

601
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:02,500
- You truly believe that, don't you?

602
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:05,333
- l have to kill people to live.

603
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,001
l guess for the first time in my life...

604
00:44:09,866 --> 00:44:11,901
...l'm starting to accept that.

605
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:15,367
But l'm always going to be a killer.

606
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:17,833
A monster.

607
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:21,000
There's nothing l can do about that.

608
00:44:22,299 --> 00:44:23,266
- Look at us.

609
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:27,267
You feel cursed
because you were born with it.

610
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:30,502
l feel useless
because l was born without it.

611
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:35,433
- We should probably get going.

612
00:44:44,165 --> 00:44:46,300
(soft music)

613
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,234
What was that for?

614
00:45:05,366 --> 00:45:06,900
- l have no one to talk to.

615
00:45:12,332 --> 00:45:15,401
(Riley laughing)

616
00:45:15,532 --> 00:45:17,533
Oh, you almost got me.

617
00:45:20,032 --> 00:45:22,601
(Riley laughing)
(clapping)

618
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:27,634
- Very nice.
You did good, little sister.

619
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,334
- Hmm, it was rather sweet.

620
00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:31,667
l practically got caught up
in the moment.

621
00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:34,467
- What's going on, guys?

622
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,868
- It's not that hard to put together,
Francis.

623
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,369
Your services are no longer needed.

624
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:44,169
- And you were just a little too delicious
to kill uneventfully in your sleep.

625
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:45,700
- Settle down, Cheetah.

626
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:48,267
lt's our playtime now.

627
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,434
- Your father is not--

628
00:45:51,566 --> 00:45:53,801
(laughing)
- Who'd you think gave the orders?

629
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:56,399
- Fucking pathetic, mate.

630
00:45:58,432 --> 00:46:01,001
- And there's no fun
if you don't put up a fight.

631
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:05,435
l like to feel a person squirm.

632
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:08,300
- At least die with some dignity, fucker.

633
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:13,202
(Francis): So this is how l got
into the box.

634
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:15,934
l'll save Me details of Me struggle.

635
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,332
They said someMing about...

636
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:21,503
a place to let me think about
what l had done. forever.

637
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:23,199
- Run along, Riley.

638
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,801
- Thank you for the dance, Francis.

639
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:42,167
Father!

640
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,035
Father! Father!

641
00:46:45,165 --> 00:46:46,332
- What is it, Riley?

642
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:48,667
- Please stop it, it's not right!

643
00:46:50,466 --> 00:46:53,135
- What are you talking about?
- Francis!

644
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:58,568
- Now, don't be a child.
He's meaningless!

645
00:46:58,699 --> 00:46:59,833
They all are!

646
00:46:59,966 --> 00:47:01,600
- No, he's di_erent!
Please, Father, for me!

647
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:05,035
Ah!
- Remember what you are!

648
00:47:05,165 --> 00:47:06,733
A disgrace!

649
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,268
You're not part of this family!
You're weak!

650
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:11,033
You're a burden!
(snimling)

651
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:13,100
l could smell it the first day
you were born.

652
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,533
We will keep our family lineage.

653
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:19,969
Everything else is expendable,
including you!

654
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:28,535
(Riley snimling)
l'm sorry, my little Ri-Ri.

655
00:47:33,165 --> 00:47:34,733
Let go, my beautiful daughter.

656
00:47:36,366 --> 00:47:37,333
- l'm sorry.

657
00:47:38,332 --> 00:47:41,301
l lost sight of things.
l love my family.

658
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:44,700
- Of course.

659
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,700
Get some sleep.

660
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:51,699
You need some sleep.

661
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
- Yes, sir.

662
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:11,801
(Francis): So now here we are.
They left me here to die.

663
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,503
Thought it would be fun
to hear me scream to death. rot slowly...

664
00:48:18,366 --> 00:48:20,801
l don't have much time.
(knocking on box)

665
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:22,134
l told my family to come here

666
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:25,167
and now they're on their way
walking into some kind of trap.

667
00:48:26,566 --> 00:48:27,900
What do they want with us?

668
00:48:29,165 --> 00:48:33,035
l have to get out of here.
or what's left ofmy family is going to die.

669
00:48:33,165 --> 00:48:35,667
(knocking on box)

670
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,868
(mumled shouting)

671
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,869
- l think l can hear him
whining like a little girl.

672
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,736
- Well, that little prick can sumer
down there with the rest of those whores.

673
00:48:48,866 --> 00:48:52,035
- l think our work here is done, brother.
- l concur.

674
00:48:52,165 --> 00:48:56,102
lt's been a long night. l believe
a relaxing cocktail or two is in order.

675
00:48:56,232 --> 00:48:58,300
- It's the bloody morning.
- And?

676
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,568
- You're right.
My mistake.

677
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:05,667
Let's go get fucked.

678
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:11,801
(soft music)

679
00:49:31,632 --> 00:49:34,835
(coughing)

680
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:42,967
(knocking on door)

681
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,300
(doorknob rattling)

682
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
- You David?

683
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,601
l've come to take care of you
and your brother.

684
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:08,202
(sirens wailing in the distance)

685
00:50:08,332 --> 00:50:09,433
Bring you back to Ludlow.

686
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,201
Stewards are waiting.

687
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:17,600
You gonna invite me in?

688
00:50:19,332 --> 00:50:21,901
- Of course. Come in.

689
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,334
- He said he'd meet us here, right?

690
00:50:38,332 --> 00:50:41,702
- Where are these kind souls
that are supposed to help us?

691
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,201
- Huh... l don't know.

692
00:50:56,499 --> 00:50:57,833
- Hello?

693
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:01,334
- Looking for Francis?!

694
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,667
(woman humming in the background)

695
00:51:43,766 --> 00:51:45,601
- What'd you say your name was again?

696
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:47,000
- Cyrus.

697
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,000
The boy doesn't have much time.

698
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:54,901
We need to leave now.
- There's nothing left here. We're ready.

699
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:56,867
- Allow me!
(growling)

700
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,201
(both grunting)

701
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:12,368
(Cyrus laughing)
(grunting, crashing)

702
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:15,634
(growling)

703
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:29,501
- Oh! Sorry.
(laughing)

704
00:52:30,466 --> 00:52:31,600
You made me jump.

705
00:52:32,332 --> 00:52:33,433
You must be the twins.

706
00:52:34,432 --> 00:52:35,366
You're Wendell.

707
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:36,633
- Hey.

708
00:52:37,232 --> 00:52:40,868
- Oh, my gosh,
you must be Darlene!

709
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,337
Ah... you are a beautiful thing!

710
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:48,001
You are far prettier
than l ever imagined.

711
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:50,267
- Um, where's my brother?

712
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:52,834
- Ah, well l believe he went out
with my boys so...

713
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:54,901
they're probably causing
all sorts of mischief.

714
00:52:55,032 --> 00:52:58,268
But they shouldn't be too long.
If you wait upstairs,

715
00:52:58,399 --> 00:53:00,367
we could go up to the house
and meet them.

716
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:03,400
- Jolly good!
- Cheerio!

717
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,300
- Young man?

718
00:53:07,299 --> 00:53:08,500
l mean, Wendell...

719
00:53:09,432 --> 00:53:10,766
Would you mind giving me a hand?

720
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,602
- Sure, l'd love to give you a hand...
- Ah!!!

721
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:22,201
- You... bitch!

722
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,767
- Such spirit!
Catch me if you can!

723
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:26,833
Boo!

724
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:29,934
(growling)

725
00:53:34,299 --> 00:53:37,935
- Do you need help, love?
- No, thank you. No, thanks.

726
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,167
(growling)

727
00:54:03,632 --> 00:54:04,966
- Ah!

728
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:33,333
(screaming in pain)

729
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:46,733
No! No!

730
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,368
Come on, buddy, don't die,
COMe On, COMe On...

731
00:54:53,299 --> 00:54:55,934
- Francis! Francis!

732
00:54:58,065 --> 00:54:59,299
Francis?

733
00:55:00,265 --> 00:55:02,567
Francis! Francis!

734
00:55:03,766 --> 00:55:04,700
Francis!

735
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:07,435
(chains rattling)

736
00:55:07,566 --> 00:55:08,566
Francis!

737
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:10,167
Francis!

738
00:55:11,032 --> 00:55:12,600
Francis...

739
00:55:13,566 --> 00:55:14,566
Ah! Ah!

740
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:15,666
- Why?!

741
00:55:16,332 --> 00:55:18,667
Why? l swear to God,
l will kill you right now!

742
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,234
Answer me! Why?
- l'll show you.

743
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:36,667
Look at her teeth.
(flies buzzing)

744
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
- They're our kind.

745
00:55:48,499 --> 00:55:49,900
What have you done to these girls?

746
00:55:51,632 --> 00:55:52,566
- They're breeders.

747
00:55:52,699 --> 00:55:55,401
For families who--
- You mean your family.

748
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:01,236
- Yes. My family.
It's how it's always been, Francis,

749
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:04,802
to ensure that our bloodline is the one
that stays in control to rule the clan.

750
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:08,503
lt's just that...
the breeding is no longer working.

751
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,502
Too many generations in a small town
where no one leaves but with...

752
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:14,666
- Darlene.

753
00:56:15,766 --> 00:56:17,467
- There's a good chance
that she'll respond.

754
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:23,534
(Mother laughing softly)

755
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,968
(Darlene panting)

756
00:56:40,366 --> 00:56:41,500
- Ugh!

757
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:49,902
- It would be easier
if you just came with me now, love.

758
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:53,433
(sing-song): Olly olly oxen free!

759
00:56:55,065 --> 00:56:56,566
God save the Queen!

760
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,601
And all that crap.

761
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:03,267
Now you're going to fuckin' die.

762
00:57:03,399 --> 00:57:04,967
(shouting)
- Ah!

763
00:57:05,866 --> 00:57:07,100
- Argh!

764
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:15,433
- Ah!

765
00:57:18,165 --> 00:57:21,301
l've had just about enough of you two.

766
00:57:21,432 --> 00:57:24,134
You got to understand, sweetheart,
you can't win.

767
00:57:24,265 --> 00:57:26,634
l'm stronger, faster

768
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:29,869
than your tiny little mind
can understand.

769
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,701
(inhaling)
Ah!

770
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:42,499
- Argh!

771
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:45,134
(coughing)

772
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:47,967
(long scream)

773
00:57:52,299 --> 00:57:54,734
(hip-hop music)

774
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,835
(music stops)

775
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,967
- She's the one.

776
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,368
l just know it.

777
00:58:09,499 --> 00:58:11,267
(Darlene whimpering)

778
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:18,336
lsn't she beautiful, Father?

779
00:58:19,232 --> 00:58:21,000
(whimpering)

780
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,536
Shh... Shush, now...

781
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:30,102
Shush...
- There they are, my prized sons.

782
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,669
A father could not be more proud.
- Fuck you!

783
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,502
- You see, Darlene, you've been chosen
to give life back to our family.

784
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:43,035
lf it comforts you, l want you to know
that ifthe seed takes,

785
00:58:43,165 --> 00:58:45,300
at least your children
will live like royalty.

786
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:52,471
lf the seed doesn't take, believe me,
we will kill you, trying.

787
00:58:53,065 --> 00:58:56,868
- Darling, let's not worry
about the small details.

788
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,269
This is a great moment.

789
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,000
Let's stop wasting time.

790
00:59:04,399 --> 00:59:06,300
Boys, l'm going to let you have your fun.

791
00:59:08,532 --> 00:59:09,866
l'm going to be out here if you need me.

792
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,001
(clicking tongue)
(Darlene panting in fear)

793
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:20,568
- No, no, no, no!

794
00:59:31,899 --> 00:59:32,899
- Wendell.

795
00:59:36,332 --> 00:59:38,333
Wendell... Wendell...

796
00:59:40,499 --> 00:59:41,566
Come on, wake up.

797
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:42,666
Wendell...

798
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:46,866
Don't touch him.

799
00:59:47,632 --> 00:59:49,533
- l'm trying to help, Francis.

800
00:59:50,899 --> 00:59:52,300
- l should've known.

801
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:05,001
- Let's hurry up and bury this bastard.
l'm fucking knackered.

802
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:07,200
- Mum says he just over by...

803
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:11,601
Ah, for fuck's sake, mate.
Who do you think you are?

804
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,301
Houdini?
- And what was Houdini

805
01:00:13,432 --> 01:00:15,066
without his dazzling assistant?

806
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:18,201
- Go home, Riley.
You're in enough trouble as it is.

807
01:00:19,165 --> 01:00:21,467
- Ah!
- You should listen to your brother.

808
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,735
- Please don't hurt him, please!
- My, my, my.

809
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:30,368
l can see why our baby sister
has become smitten with you.

810
01:00:31,332 --> 01:00:32,800
The brooding eyes...

811
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:36,402
The internal pain...
- Sensitive, indeed.

812
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:39,101
- But what Riley
seems to be forgetting

813
01:00:39,232 --> 01:00:42,735
is she doesn't have a fucking say
in our family!

814
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:45,101
(Riley whimpering)

815
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:52,000
- Leave her alone.

816
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:55,499
- Or what?

817
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:57,466
(laughing)

818
01:00:58,632 --> 01:00:59,933
Ah!

819
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,134
l likee!

820
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:08,801
Let's dance, you and l!

821
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:10,533
- Francis!

822
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:13,869
- Well, get on with it!
l'd like to get some sleep sometime soon.

823
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:16,634
- What'd you do now, Francis?

824
01:01:18,032 --> 01:01:20,934
You're outnumbered, you're outplayed...

825
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,300
And you're simply just too late.

826
01:01:32,866 --> 01:01:33,833
- Francis!

827
01:01:33,966 --> 01:01:35,567
- Shut your face, or are you jealous

828
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:38,334
that Father is giving someone else
amectionate attention?

829
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:39,600
- That's right!

830
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:42,302
We've just come from a very nice
little breakfast bumet

831
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,767
where your sister was the main course.

832
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:46,000
(laughter)

833
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:49,335
l can still smell her aroma.

834
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:51,701
l can pull it out and let you take a whi_
if you'd like.

835
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,034
(laughter)

836
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,134
What? You never gave your sister
a good rodgering?

837
01:02:06,499 --> 01:02:08,000
- Ah!
(blood spattering)

838
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:16,333
(soft music)
(sobbing)

839
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:19,034
- Brother... Brother!

840
01:02:19,499 --> 01:02:22,368
(coughing)

841
01:02:22,499 --> 01:02:23,600
Brother!!!

842
01:02:25,766 --> 01:02:26,733
Brother!

843
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:30,700
(grunting)

844
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:34,733
- What are you waiting for?

845
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:40,303
- Riley! Riley! We're family!
Help me!

846
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,468
Riley, you're one of us!

847
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:54,269
- Ri... Riley, listen to me, he'll kill you.

848
01:02:54,866 --> 01:02:55,866
Please!

849
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,800
- Argh!!!
- Riley!

850
01:03:01,165 --> 01:03:03,667
- Yeah, that's it. That's it.
l love you, Ri-Ri!

851
01:03:05,632 --> 01:03:07,133
- Ah!

852
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,867
(crying)

853
01:03:19,232 --> 01:03:21,200
(sobbing loudly)

854
01:03:30,132 --> 01:03:32,267
(snimling)

855
01:03:32,399 --> 01:03:34,334
(knocking)

856
01:03:41,899 --> 01:03:42,866
- Please help us.

857
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:45,000
My brother's dying.

858
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,736
Just please help us.
- Father?

859
01:03:59,332 --> 01:04:00,933
- Please help us.

860
01:04:01,065 --> 01:04:03,500
l know this is a battle we can't win,

861
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:06,167
and all l ask is that you spare him,
he's a good kid.

862
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:08,501
l don't care what you do with me.

863
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:10,934
- You're more resilient
than l gave you credit for.

864
01:04:12,966 --> 01:04:14,834
You do understand
your other brothers are dead?

865
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:19,666
Pathetic.

866
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:23,500
Sad and pathetic.

867
01:04:31,265 --> 01:04:33,834
(panting)
(Riley sobbing)

868
01:04:41,332 --> 01:04:42,332
- It's okay.

869
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:45,568
- l'm sorry... l'm so sorry...

870
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:46,800
- No, it's okay...

871
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:50,165
l'm here.

872
01:04:51,432 --> 01:04:52,499
- He was right.

873
01:04:53,466 --> 01:04:55,334
What have l done?

874
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:59,102
- Ah... Young love.

875
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:00,933
(Wendell scoming)

876
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:02,800
- Wendell!

877
01:05:10,933 --> 01:05:12,034
- They got her, Francis.

878
01:05:15,132 --> 01:05:16,132
They have Darlene.

879
01:05:18,132 --> 01:05:20,000
- You don't understand;
they'll kill you, Francis.

880
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,367
lt's suicide.

881
01:05:23,232 --> 01:05:27,502
Save yourselves!
Save what's left of your family.

882
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:32,067
- That's exactly why l have to do this.

883
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,367
- There's a story from around this area.

884
01:05:39,399 --> 01:05:41,334
lt's more like a folklore, really...

885
01:05:44,499 --> 01:05:48,769
About a young girl
who was led into a life of breeding.

886
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:52,969
A haphazard job.
That was her lot.

887
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:55,767
That was her duty.

888
01:05:57,332 --> 01:06:00,735
This didn't sit with her
and the young man that she loved.

889
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,134
So they escaped...

890
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:09,002
...decided to go to some far-flung country...
who knows?

891
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,566
Never to be seen again.

892
01:06:11,632 --> 01:06:13,367
Her maiden name was Manderson.

893
01:06:16,165 --> 01:06:17,866
- She looks like--
- Your mother.

894
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:20,066
lt's your mother, David.

895
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:25,001
- She never told us about her past.

896
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:27,833
Now l know why.

897
01:06:29,132 --> 01:06:31,133
- The Mandersons were the original family.

898
01:06:31,733 --> 01:06:34,702
They're all but extinct now.
But they were the first...

899
01:06:35,733 --> 01:06:37,468
...the ones that bred life to all of us.

900
01:06:38,899 --> 01:06:41,334
So you could only imagine
ourjoy to discover

901
01:06:41,466 --> 01:06:43,701
that the one last great descendant,
your mother...

902
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,300
...had a beautiful daughter.

903
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:48,900
A true prize worth killing for.

904
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,003
And in the same breath
ensures my bloodline stays in control.

905
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:57,301
Just as it should be.

906
01:06:58,733 --> 01:07:01,168
- And Lenny?
- l like you, David.

907
01:07:03,065 --> 01:07:06,668
lf you surrender yourself,
we can make use for the boy.

908
01:07:08,165 --> 01:07:09,332
He's still very young.

909
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:13,532
- Francis!

910
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,367
- Damn that girl!

911
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:20,499
- Wait! No!

912
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:26,269
- This changes everything, David.
- Think of Lenny, please...

913
01:07:26,899 --> 01:07:30,002
- They tried to bury me alive,
kill the twins...

914
01:07:30,933 --> 01:07:33,602
Why did you bring him here, David?
Why did you bring Lenny here?!

915
01:07:33,733 --> 01:07:34,934
- There's no other choice.

916
01:07:35,065 --> 01:07:38,735
They can help him, they know how,
so settle down.

917
01:07:38,866 --> 01:07:41,868
- This be Damascus,
be thou cursed Cain,

918
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,302
to slay thy brother Abel if thou wilt.

919
01:07:45,532 --> 01:07:46,499
Would you do the same?

920
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:49,001
(both panting)

921
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:51,267
lf you truly care for the little one,

922
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:53,134
you'll show me that you can
truly surrender.

923
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:57,002
And l promise you,
l will keep my end of our bargain.

924
01:08:03,332 --> 01:08:07,169
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, Frannie. No other way.

925
01:08:08,132 --> 01:08:11,335
- Looks like your plan to storm the castle
has been foiled by your own brother.

926
01:08:12,632 --> 01:08:16,002
lf it's any consolation,
he'll be joining you very shortly.

927
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,633
- This is going to get interesting.

928
01:08:28,632 --> 01:08:30,867
(growling, Mother screaming)

929
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,334
(shouting)

930
01:08:34,065 --> 01:08:34,965
- Lenny, go, now!

931
01:08:38,966 --> 01:08:42,502
(shouting)
Hey!

932
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:46,600
Don't you tell me my brothers are dead.

933
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,500
l know my family better than you do.

934
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:55,435
- Well, congratulations, David,
you finally did something as a family.

935
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:57,633
Now you're going to die as one.

936
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:02,868
(loud growling)

937
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,535
Don't fool yourselves into thinking
you can do anything to me.

938
01:09:08,332 --> 01:09:10,834
l loved my wife.
What a shame.

939
01:09:11,432 --> 01:09:13,534
Fact is, she was getting old.

940
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:16,768
Perhaps your sister can take her place?

941
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:18,667
(low growling)

942
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:25,136
- l highly... doubt that, you old man!

943
01:09:25,866 --> 01:09:27,200
- And why is that, Francis?

944
01:09:28,733 --> 01:09:31,001
- 'Cause l'm going to kill you, motherFucker!

945
01:09:35,132 --> 01:09:37,534
(Lenny growling)

946
01:09:48,499 --> 01:09:50,334
- You're strong, David.
l'm impressed.

947
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:54,101
Yes! Yes!

948
01:09:56,466 --> 01:09:59,669
Come on! Yeah...
(growling)

949
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:02,366
- l need to do this.

950
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:06,068
- Oh, you're going to do this, yeah?

951
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:07,266
(both shouting)

952
01:10:09,366 --> 01:10:10,433
- Ah!!!

953
01:10:10,566 --> 01:10:11,533
Yes...!

954
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,267
(growling)

955
01:10:14,566 --> 01:10:15,767
(Lenny growling)
(Darlene): No!

956
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:39,499
(both shouting)

957
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:54,301
(Father growling)

958
01:10:57,666 --> 01:10:59,367
(grunting in pain)

959
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,833
(panting)

960
01:11:11,966 --> 01:11:15,502
- Why are we fighting, Francis?
It doesn't have to be this way.

961
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:19,969
We're of the same blood.
- We're not the same.

962
01:11:20,499 --> 01:11:23,568
l am nothing like you.

963
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:26,001
- Then you won't be killing me, will you?

964
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,101
- Not like this.

965
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:31,966
- Ah!

966
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:39,834
(grunting)

967
01:11:46,332 --> 01:11:47,332
This changes nothing!

968
01:11:48,499 --> 01:11:49,833
You'll still end up

969
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:52,468
in some rat-infested prison
like the murderers you are.

970
01:11:53,966 --> 01:11:55,000
- Maybe.

971
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:58,669
But you're going to die alone,
and your bloodline's wiped out.

972
01:12:00,032 --> 01:12:01,366
- While we're all still alive.

973
01:12:04,499 --> 01:12:06,667
You see, that's the di_erence between us.

974
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,869
We're not monsters.
Not like you.

975
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,001
(grunting)

976
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,868
- Hmm! My prized brothers.

977
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,434
(sighing)

978
01:12:21,566 --> 01:12:23,267
A sister couldn't be any prouder.

979
01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:32,069
- No!!!

980
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:34,668
(Father shouting from the castle,
Darlene laughing)

981
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
(sighing)

982
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
(sighing)

983
01:13:03,165 --> 01:13:04,132
- How is he?

984
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:13,000
Riley, wait!

985
01:13:14,332 --> 01:13:16,200
(snimling)

986
01:13:16,332 --> 01:13:18,400
- l'm sorry, l can't.

987
01:13:19,632 --> 01:13:23,836
l have to go... l can't...
(sobbing)

988
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,134
(door closing)

989
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,534
(Darlene): David, help me!

990
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,835
(David): Francis, come on!
(Wendell): Ah!

991
01:13:40,733 --> 01:13:43,102
Easy...!
l'm fine, l'm fine.

992
01:13:50,532 --> 01:13:52,734
- You know where we're meeting?
You can take care of this?

993
01:13:52,866 --> 01:13:54,434
- Ah! Come on.

994
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,199
Thank you, David.

995
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:59,200
- See you in a couple of days.
- Alright.

996
01:13:59,332 --> 01:14:01,834
Hey, take care.
- Drive safe.

997
01:14:01,966 --> 01:14:03,000
- Be careful.

998
01:14:08,265 --> 01:14:10,967
(hip-hop music)

999
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:25,234
- Were you really going to die for me?

1000
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,168
- What l want to know
is how you came back swinging.

1001
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,368
What happened?
How did he heal?

1002
01:14:36,099 --> 01:14:38,501
lt was in front ofus the entire time.

1003
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:43,202
David said it was blood of our own kind.
not human blood.

1004
01:14:43,332 --> 01:14:45,333
that was able to help heal Lenny.

1005
01:14:46,766 --> 01:14:48,367
Even ifit came from our own enemy.

1006
01:14:52,099 --> 01:14:56,002
Whatever bred life into all ofus
is what gave it back as well.

1007
01:14:58,366 --> 01:15:01,001
lt made me understand
what l'd felt was missing before.

1008
01:15:06,532 --> 01:15:10,002
You know...
there's somethin' l gotta do.

1009
01:15:45,466 --> 01:15:48,669
(gravedigger): Anything else you want?
- It's okay, thank you.

1010
01:15:51,799 --> 01:15:53,000
Why have you come back?

1011
01:15:55,299 --> 01:15:56,333
- Come with us.

1012
01:15:58,933 --> 01:16:00,134
- My home is here.

1013
01:16:06,499 --> 01:16:09,301
- Come with us. Please.

1014
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,968
- l have to live with what l've done.

1015
01:16:17,032 --> 01:16:18,266
This is my home.

1016
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,501
This is my family.

1017
01:16:22,599 --> 01:16:25,034
Every time l'll look at you,
l'll only remember...

1018
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:26,199
(sobbing)

1019
01:16:28,966 --> 01:16:30,100
- Are you going to be okay?

1020
01:16:31,632 --> 01:16:32,833
- Yeah, l'll be fine.

1021
01:16:34,666 --> 01:16:35,666
Always have.

1022
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:09,302
(footsteps approaching)

1023
01:17:11,165 --> 01:17:13,734
l used to think that we could only live
in a certain way,

1024
01:17:13,866 --> 01:17:16,001
with malice in our hearts.

1025
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:18,566
Until l met you.

1026
01:17:20,699 --> 01:17:21,699
(laughing softly)

1027
01:17:22,966 --> 01:17:25,301
l don't want this story
to end as a tragedy.

1028
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:30,000
- l like westerns.

1029
01:17:31,699 --> 01:17:33,834
We could ride om
into the sunset together.

1030
01:17:48,299 --> 01:17:50,501
(Francis)_. As we ty to find our place
in the world...

1031
01:17:51,499 --> 01:17:52,633
...all we have is each other...

1032
01:17:54,165 --> 01:17:56,300
...and a disease
that wiII forever foIIow us.

1033
01:17:57,799 --> 01:17:59,367
l understand what l am now...

1034
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Where l belong.

1035
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:04,367
And even though we need blood
to su_ive.

1036
01:18:04,499 --> 01:18:09,003
ifs not blood we're bound by.
or even what keeps us alive.

1037
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,534
lt's family that gives us life.

1038
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:17,435
And it's our family that will ultimately
Iet us know where we belong.

1039
01:18:18,265 --> 01:18:19,499
This is our stoy.

1040
01:18:21,432 --> 01:18:24,334
And even if we don't reali_e
where it will end.

1041
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,267
or even if it's just beginning...

1042
01:18:27,632 --> 01:18:32,370
...we do know...
we're always travelling towards home.

1043
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:32,499
(rock music)

1044
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,800
(rock music)

1045
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,400
- It's no bother at all.

1046
01:18:59,532 --> 01:19:01,667
And you guys said you had family here
in the countryside?

1047
01:19:01,799 --> 01:19:04,468
- Yes, but they're on the coast.
- Ah...

1048
01:19:04,599 --> 01:19:07,969
- Uh, we've been travelling around,
