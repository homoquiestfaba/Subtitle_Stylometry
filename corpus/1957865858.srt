1
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,387
Life never turns out
the way you expect.

2
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,657
That's one of the last things
my grandpa told me.

3
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,392
He also told me to always bring
an extra pair of pants,

4
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,194
whenever we play miniature golf
in case I got a hole in one.

5
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,697
But I was always very careful.

6
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,935
Your profile pictures
aren't very up to date.

7
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,038
If you didn't see your name,
I never would have known
that was you.

8
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,308
I read an article about
how this place used to be
an abandoned plant.

9
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,579
until someone realized that
it could be something beautiful.

10
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:25,753
Sorry.

11
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:29,624
Touching can be too intense.

12
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:08,428
How did it go?

13
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:10,999
She just ran off.

14
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,836
Let me guess.
You didn't look her in her eyes.

15
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,772
- I'm never getting married.
- Married?

16
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,074
We need to get you
a second date.

17
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,011
I need to find someone
before you die.

18
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,146
Well, good news.
I'm still breathing.

19
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,585
Sometimes to motivate myself,
I picture you lying in a casket.

20
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,587
How dare you say that?

21
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,822
You know I want to be cremated

22
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:36,591
so no one will
screw up my makeup.

23
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,893
Maybe I should start
picturing you as an urn.

24
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,996
Whatever works.

25
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,466
Don't ever stop looking
for that special someone.

26
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:48,036
She's out there.

27
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:52,073
Every day, I pray
that you'll find her.

28
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,408
I printed something for you.

29
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,479
That'll be you someday.

30
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,692
Clint, my man.

31
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,728
How's the meat?

32
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,430
Wow.

33
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,366
Why is this hottie rated a six?

34
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,868
She lied in her bio.

35
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,639
She says she majored
in cosmetology at Harvard,

36
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:26,774
I caught that one. My algorithm

37
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,408
-cross checked the way she--
-Okay, look.

38
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:29,744
Somebody that looks like this

39
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,846
should have a boost
to their score.

40
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,114
The score is objective.

41
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,683
It's her history of how many
times she's been--

42
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:38,519
Nobody cares about people's
histories if we lose

43
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,354
all the young and hot
with valid credit cards.

44
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:45,225
Let's find a way
to reward this beauty.

45
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:52,299
Oh, I can't get
into my personal account.

46
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,070
Yes, new rule.

47
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,006
Employees are no longer allowed
to date through the app.

48
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,373
So you can't use it either.

49
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,642
Of course I can.

50
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,177
-Quality control.
-What about Adele?

51
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,012
-Same thing.
-And Cyrus?

52
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,415
Shawn, we've had
a few complaints

53
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,652
from some of the girls
that you've met.

54
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:15,056
All of them, actually,
not a big deal.

55
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,559
But, uh, you know, maybe we try
to date through other apps.

56
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:23,363
I know my chances of finding
someone will increase if I can--

57
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:33,708
- I hope everyone's excited about our women haters party.
-  -Tammy.

58
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:40,047
Fine, promo party.
Some of you need to RSVP today.

59
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,481
I didn't get the invite.

60
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,920
Sorry, Shawn. Jake's getting
picky about who goes.

61
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,288
I won't have anything to eat
or drink. If that helps.

62
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,993
Can't do it, Shawn.
When Jake says no, he means no.

63
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,394
kind of like victims
of sexual assault.

64
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,397
No means no, people.

65
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,902
-I'll add you to the list,
-But you just said no.

66
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:04,105
I hate the theme
and object to it on principle,

67
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,807
but you're a nice guy.

68
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,945
What up, bro?

69
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,314
We're at a Pimps and Hoes party.

70
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,018
Why are you dressed
like Elton John?

71
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:18,619
What?

72
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,689
- You don't look like a ho.
- Exactly.

73
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:24,725
Why are we celebrating
women being trafficked by pimps?

74
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,830
How's Grandma doing?

75
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:31,398
I heard she swallowed
a hundred dollar bill.

76
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,000
Grandma didn't swallow anything.

77
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,636
So there's been no change?

78
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:38,573
Nope.

79
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,340
She looked at me.

80
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,812
Hey, turn on the charm,
smile back.

81
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,883
Nah, no. That's like
the Cheshire cat.

82
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,718
More subtle, look, look.

83
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,090
No, you're being creepy.
That's creepy.

84
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:59,527
Smile long enough to hook her,
not make her run away.

85
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,696
Three seconds. Turn your head,

86
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,764
smile for three seconds
and turn back.

87
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,771
Yeah, it was awesome.
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:15,343
Okay, some of these women
might be out of your league.

89
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,377
All women might be
out of your league.

90
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,880
-Don't say that.
-Kidding. Kidding.

91
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:21,115
Try your smile out
on somebody else.

92
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,596
It worked.

93
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,871
White is the color of all
wavelengths of visible life.

94
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:45,940
People think black
is all colors,

95
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,408
but black is
the absence of color.

96
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,811
Uh-huh, I'm violet.

97
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:54,048
Heh, the color on the higher end
of the visible spectrum,

98
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,549
I'm Shawn.

99
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,119
Please say you'll go
on a date with me.

100
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:03,157
-We can go someplace right now.
-I can't right now.

101
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,128
We can do later,
but it'll cost you.

102
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,533
You're at a Pimps and Hoes party

103
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:13,968
talking to a ho.

104
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,570
I'm not good at pretend.

105
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:21,342
Well, I'm good at everything
as long as I'm paid by the hour.

106
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,946
I used to be paid by the hour.
Now I'm on salary.

107
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,014
Three hundred an hour.

108
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,550
What do you do
to earn that much?

109
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,185
Like I said,

110
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,621
everything.

111
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,992
You free Saturday night?

112
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:40,227
What time? For how long?

113
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,029
I don't know.

114
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,699
Five

115
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,834
until eight.

116
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,237
You don't want to wait
until it gets dark.

117
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,306
It's summer in Seattle.

118
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,178
The sun stays out forever,
like it's trying to make up
for the rest of the year.

119
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,615
Whatever you say, big spender.

120
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,684
Just text me your address.

121
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,887
I look forward to going out.

122
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,523
Going somewhere is extra.

123
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:12,059
Then we can stay in,
have dinner.

124
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,695
I'll bring dessert.

125
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:16,564
I like chocolate.

126
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:21,202
Bro, you did it.

127
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,723
Hi, Douglas.

128
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:44,825
Send her up.

129
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,199
Oh, I think,
I have the wrong place.

130
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,300
Hi, Violet.

131
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,171
Oh.

132
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:01,542
Hello.

133
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:10,519
Women dress so edgy these days.

134
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:12,953
Will you be joining us?

135
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:16,657
I'll, I'll be in my bedroom.

136
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,994
No touching until I say it's OK.

137
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,631
- Oh, well, Shawn doesn't like touching, either.
-  -Mm-hmm.

138
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,401
And if I don't want
to do something, I won't.

139
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:29,470
Oh, well, of course, dear.

140
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,906
We all need better boundaries.

141
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,512
Well, um, I'm off
to my bedroom, and uh,

142
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:42,750
so you two can get started.

143
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,300
Oh, you were supposed
to bring dessert.

144
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,003
-It's right here.
-What?

145
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,975
- Oh.
- Um...

146
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:13,881
Dinner

147
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,785
Oh, you want
the girlfriend experience?

148
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,987
As long as it leads
to something more.

149
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,089
We can role play.

150
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,058
Whatever you want.

151
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,467
You really like muffins.

152
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,537
Those are Apple muffins.

153
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,371
Washington's official
state fruit.

154
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,442
I've got something else
you'll find tasty.

155
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:42,943
You did bring dessert.

156
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:46,647
Where's your bedroom?

157
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,719
Right down the hall
and to the right.

158
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:53,854
Give me a sec.

159
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,949
We should get the business part
out of the way first.

160
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,184
Business part?

161
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,353
Didn't know you were changing.

162
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,926
You're new at this? I get it.

163
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:41,402
you booked me for three hours,
that's nine hundred, stud.

164
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:43,304
I don't understand.

165
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,874
-Are you a cop?
-I'm a programmer
for a dating app.

166
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:50,344
I turn original formulations
into executable programs.

167
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,247
I solve problems with algorithms
and verify the requirements

168
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,483
-of the--
-I love to hear
more about that later.

169
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:57,818
I really have to show you

170
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,688
You're the one who hired me.

171
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:03,324
-Show me whatever you want.
-Why would I hire you?

172
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,797
You really thought
this was a date?

173
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,865
What else would it be?

174
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:15,803
What do you think I am?

175
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:20,040
You're a pretty woman.

176
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:38,926
You're very nice, but I have
to go. Car's on the way.

177
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,595
- That was too quick.
- Sorry.

178
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,531
-I need to hook up with someone.
-I could go with you.

179
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:45,567
You should date someone else.

180
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,001
Did I say something to hurt you?

181
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,703
Sometimes I do that
without realizing it.

182
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,505
It's nothing against you. But--

183
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,840
But you can't date
a guy like me?

184
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,176
Not the first time
I've heard that.

185
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:07,054
Well, it's a short car ride.

186
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,566
Hey, I've got a box
for your grandma.

187
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,933
I'll get it on my way back.

188
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:23,470
-She knows you're going out?
-Of course she does.

189
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,205
I'm on a date.

190
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,580
You have a busy schedule.

191
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,182
-It's just for work.
-What do you do?

192
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,118
-I'm an actress.
-Oh, wow.

193
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,821
-So this is an audition?
-Kind of.

194
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,159
-How long have you been acting?
-Look, you're fine
to come along,

195
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,194
but can you do
a little less of this?

196
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,064
Yeah.

197
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,807
- Have a good night.
-  -I can wait here until you're done.

198
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,943
- These things could take a while.
-  -I'm fine.

199
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,147
- You really need to go.
- Don't worry about me.

200
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,419
-Well, I have your number.
-Sorry, I don't--

201
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,290
Hugs, they're too intense.

202
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,360
Oh, okay.

203
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,296
I'll see you around then.

204
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,066
Did you get the part?

205
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,302
You're still here?

206
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:03,838
I wanted to hear how it went.

207
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,274
Same as always.
I just try to get through it.

208
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,044
I've got another audition.

209
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,180
You're very popular.

210
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,453
I can't believe
you stuck around.

211
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,255
I didn't want our date to end.

212
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:22,557
I hardly know you.

213
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,827
Most people just care
about my measurements.

214
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,596
We can start with that.
How tall are you?

215
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,364
Five six.

216
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,768
What's your favorite
breakfast cereal?

217
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:34,935
Hmm.

218
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,873
The sugar cereals. My mom
didn't let me eat growing up.

219
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,141
Mine used to be Good Friends.

220
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,010
That's a cereal?

221
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,112
It's the only thing
I would eat for breakfast,

222
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,781
until I couldn't eat
gluten anymore.

223
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:49,082
I'm going to make a cereal
called enemies

224
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,285
so that people
can eat them for breakfast.

225
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,320
You are?

226
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,590
Just a bad joke.

227
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:06,868
You don't need to wait for me.

228
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,969
Let's keep this thing going.

229
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:12,607
It shouldn't be long.

230
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:55,349
You okay?

231
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:59,687
Just listening
to the colors of the bridge.

232
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,625
Some of the senses
in my brain are mixed up.

233
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,259
It's called synesthesia.

234
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,429
When I look closely at colors,
I hear sounds.

235
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:12,065
What's that sound like?

236
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:14,602
Clang!

237
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:18,038
Not what I thought.

238
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,309
Stay here for a second.

239
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,717
Productive night, sweetie?

240
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:31,786
You didn't text me back.

241
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,521
I'm going there now.

242
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,390
Who's the guy?

243
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,794
Just someone being nice to me.

244
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,329
That's all he had in his wallet.

245
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:50,137
You know,

246
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,609
better get back to him.

247
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:00,848
Who is that?

248
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,785
He's, uh, my manager, Anton.

249
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,352
Helps me get jobs.

250
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,091
I've got one more audition.

251
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:22,570
Takes the edge off.

252
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,774
You should try chamomile tea.
It also relieves cramps.

253
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:28,776
I'll keep that in mind.

254
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,678
It's the

255
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,164
You're looking pretty, Amber.

256
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:53,367
Oh, I think
I have the wrong place.

257
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,769
No, you got the right place.

258
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,740
Amber works down at the office.

259
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,341
She won't give me a time of day.

260
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:02,810
Just play along.

261
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,919
So I haven't met a lot
of actresses in Seattle.

262
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:15,422
- It's a small community.
- Huh.

263
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:18,993
How long have you two
been friends?

264
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,029
Colin is my brother,

265
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,897
A very protective brother.

266
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:27,669
Ah, didn't realize
it was so late.

267
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:29,336
I want to see you again.

268
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,238
I wish my life wasn't so busy.

269
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,241
Take it easy, bro.
Give her some space.

270
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,710
I really like you.

271
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,680
I'll call you, promise.

272
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,921
That was four dates.

273
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:48,823
A new record.

274
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,759
Yeah, I count that as one date.

275
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,294
Look, grandma's been
bugging me for a while

276
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:56,698
to help you find someone.
Maybe it's time I did.

277
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:59,299
I like Violet. We're going
to have a fifth date.

278
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,736
I will help you find
the right kind of girl,

279
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:05,707
and we'll start with, uh, this.

280
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:09,242
Most of us don't wear
the same thing every single day.

281
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,611
I mix up the colors.

282
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:12,613
Yeah, you dress like a Lego.

283
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:15,516
Okay, time to dress like a man.

284
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,752
I'll forget how
to match everything.

285
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:18,886
We will take photos.

286
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,556
And maybe do something--

287
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:22,924
I know, I know, I know.

288
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:23,991
Thank you.

289
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,230
Someone stole my credit card.

290
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:32,767
You gotta be careful, bro.

291
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,702
Ready?

292
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:40,541
I thought Sunday
is blue shirt day.

293
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:42,977
Colin says this is better.

294
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,848
Did you ask that woman
about her family?

295
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,184
Her job?

296
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:52,887
-She's an actress.
-Wh, what about her church?

297
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,222
I don't know.

298
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,590
Make sure you read
the sell sheet

299
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:57,191
before you buy the house.

300
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,127
I'm not buying a house.

301
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:04,932
Besides, she hasn't answered
any of my phone calls
or text messages.

302
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,368
She'll probably just be
like everyone else.

303
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:19,747
You know, sometimes we need
a little encouragement,

304
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,884
so that we don't
give up on love.

305
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:30,858
Doesn't seem right for me
to wear these anymore.

306
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,695
Are you dying?

307
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:36,463
Oh, and I know your grandpa

308
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:38,633
would've wanted you to have it.

309
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:42,937
Therefore, when you find
that special person

310
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:46,073
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Oh.

311
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:53,948

312
00:21:54,081 --> 00:22:01,222

316
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,411
Anyone can see it's a moustache,

317
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:26,180
but you can get it
lasered right off.

318
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:27,748
Go. Hey, excuse my brother.

319
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:30,084
He can be
a little blunt sometimes.

320
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,019
Did I say something hurtful?

321
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:33,554
Just try your key, Shawn.

322
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,089
Nope.

323
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,592
Okay, that one's staying locked.

324
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:42,096
Look, um, just try a couple more
locks before we take off.

325
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,097
Okay?

326
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:46,734
This may not have been
my best idea.

327
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,504
- Can I talk to you for a second?
 -Mmm-hmm.

328
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:53,641
I told her to stop by
between her auditions.

329
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:57,044
Give us a moment.

330
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:00,781
I got your texts,

331
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:03,416
including the ones about
your credit card being stolen.

332
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:08,388
Tell me how you want
to work this out.

333
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:09,590
You had it.

334
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:12,392
I thought that's why
you texted me.

335
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:15,029
I just wanted you to know
what was going on.

336
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,231
Maybe you wanted
to see me again.

337
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:18,833
Oh, right.

338
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,936
I must have grabbed it
at the coffee shop by mistake.

339
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:25,306
-I took everything back.
-That explains that.

340
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,875
Can I chat with you for a sec?

341
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,145
Hold on Shawn, just--

342
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:36,584
Look, something is off here.

343
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:40,121
I know, your brother
is very unique.

344
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:43,124
He has autism.

345
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,927
He's high functioning,
but it's tough for him

346
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,964
to form relationships,
communicate, break social cues.

347
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:53,067
I might have that, too.

348
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,974
Look, he can be too trusting,
too loyal, and when he hurts,

349
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,475
- he hurts big time.
- Hmm.

350
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,512
He deserves a nice woman.

351
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:09,317
No offense,
but you're not really his type.

352
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:12,954
The only time people say
no offense is when they know
they're being offensive.

353
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,056
-I didn't mean--
-I know what you meant.

354
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:18,993
Wanna get a bite to eat, Shawn?

355
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,095
Try the key thing.
Maybe a muffin.

356
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,400
Your brother could be
friendlier.

357
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:27,635
Sorry about that.

358
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:29,437
Whenever I'm feeling down,

359
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,571
this is what I look at.

360
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,409
A wedding app.

361
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:36,711
That one lists everything
you need to do

362
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:38,145
to get ready for your big day.

363
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,948
I heard of a guy
who put out an ad

364
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:43,451
one time that said,
"Wife wanted."

365
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:47,555
He got a bunch of replies back
that said, "You can have mine."

366
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,560
Is that a joke?

367
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:54,996
Colin is better at those.

368
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:58,866
-Inspiring, huh?
-Huh.

369
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:03,170
Seeing all those cake photos
makes me hungry.

370
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:05,373
I can't eat casein
which is part of milk

371
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,708
or gluten which
is part of wheat.

372
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,879
Uh, give me a minute.

373
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:20,688
You got me worried when I
didn't hear from you, sweetie.

374
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:22,490
No one was lined up,
I thought...

375
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,625
Let me do the thinking.

376
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:46,781
Sorry. I thought
I was free today.

377
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:50,151
-There's something wrong
with your hand.
-Just nerves.

378
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,256
I could never be an actor.
Expose myself to everybody?

379
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:58,559
-You're brave.
-I'm crazy.

380
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:02,029
You're a different wavelength.

381
00:26:03,497 --> 00:26:04,799
What do you mean?

382
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:08,803
There are colors we can't see.

383
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,573
Beauty that's outside
our physical spectrum.

384
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:16,210
There's a lot about you
that's not visible to me yet.

385
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:20,848
But I can tell it's going
to be beautiful.

386
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:32,660
I'd like to try that hug again.

387
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:38,666
I can hug you gently.

388
00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:43,737
Can you hug me?

389
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,250
That's the best I can do.

390
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,924
How does my necklace sound?

391
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:08,929
Like whispers.

392
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:19,740
Since you won't hug me

393
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:21,909
I'll just say it.

394
00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:24,411
I want to hug you, Shawn.

395
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,249
And it's not
an everyday event for me.

396
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:30,951
I've had more touching
then I need.

397
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:32,554
I don't know what that means.

398
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,689
But I'd really like
to see you again.

399
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:39,760
I know.

400
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,037
Hey.

401
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:52,806
Grandma called me.

402
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:55,342
Now, she doesn't have a good
vibe about Violet either.

403
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:58,145
I finally have a relationship
and you're both against it.

404
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:01,916
you've seen her two times,
that's not a relationship.

405
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:07,321
You can be too trusting
and that's how you get hurt.

406
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:10,024
The way she dresses,

407
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,293
it makes me think
she has a past.

408
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,962
And those auditions at night,

409
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:17,731
there, there can't be that
many acting jobs in Seattle.

410
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,400
At least I'm worried
about my future.

411
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:21,835
You're the only barista here
with a teaching degree.

412
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,804
You should be doing more
with your life.

413
00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:25,439
And you should be asking her
more questions.

414
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:28,510
Get to know her,
find out what she really does.

415
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,244
Be happy for me.

416
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:34,748
Colin doesn't think someone
can be a full time actor
in Seattle.

417
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:36,951
I do other jobs to get by.

418
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:39,220
He doesn't even think
we should be together.

419
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:40,788
Neither does my grandma.

420
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,258
You're an adult.
You can choose who you're with.

421
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,737
The reason I showed you that
wedding app is because I only

422
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,772
date someone if she's
a possible wife.

423
00:28:59,608 --> 00:29:00,508
Oh!

424
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:03,612
Wow.

425
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:07,381
Um, I almost forgot.
Since you're so into weddings,

426
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:09,216
I thought you could
use this someday,

427
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,953
when, uh, some of those colors
aren't right to you.

428
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:16,123
Thank you.

429
00:29:39,748 --> 00:29:41,148
I should get back to work.

430
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:44,151
I got to go too.

431
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,220
Auditions.

432
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,739
I don't even know this guy.

433
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:06,440
That's why we're going
out with him.

434
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:07,875
It'll be fun, I promise.

435
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:09,009
It's getting late.

436
00:30:09,143 --> 00:30:10,477
We should've met
him at the club.

437
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,313
Would you relax, okay?

438
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:14,281
But don't worry about this.

439
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,222
Come on.

440
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:27,828
Hey, Joe, She's the one
I was telling you about.

441
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,235
Here you go.

442
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:39,574
Bottoms up.

443
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:47,615
Come on, you could do
better than that. Bottoms up.

444
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:03,565
Let's go.

445
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,466
You know what? Actually,

446
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,334
I forgot something
in the car, all right.

447
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:09,203
I'll be back in like,
two minutes.

448
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:11,038
- I'll go with you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

449
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:12,640
Just hang out here, all right?

450
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:15,543
When I get back, we'll get
a bite to eat before we go
to the club.

451
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,945
Okay, just--

452
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:30,991
So you must have known
Anton for a while?

453
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,450
Your wine is a little sour.

454
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:15,870
I'm gonna wait in the hall.

455
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,143
Oh, hey, what's going on?

456
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:39,854
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

457
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:41,956
- You okay?
-  -Something was in the wine.

458
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,858
Your friend was all over me.

459
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,293
- Calm, calm down.
- I'm calling the police.

460
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:47,729
Calm down.

461
00:33:47,862 --> 00:33:49,329
-Hey, it's all gonna work out.
-You don't get--

462
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:51,498
- I was at the door...
- Just--

463
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:54,234
-Just-- No, no, no, no, no.
-...and he, he's--

464
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:56,336
I know exactly what happened.

465
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,371
See this.

466
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:00,708
Mm-hmm.

467
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,782
Looks like you were enjoying it.

468
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:12,052
Come on. Get up.

469
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,756
- What the hell is going on?
- Come on, get up.

470
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:15,790
Come on, that's it.

471
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:20,093
Hey, come on.

472
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,162
Yeah, that's it.

473
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,936
-Mm, take one of these.
-Uh--

474
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,437
Take one of these,
it will make you feel good.

475
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:33,073
Come on, take the edge off.

476
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:34,542
Let's go.

477
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,443
There you go.

478
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:40,113
I have another friend
for you to see.

479
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:44,552
I want to go home.

480
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:47,855
Now it's time for you to pay me
back for I've done for you.

481
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:50,123
-Okay. Hey, shush.
-No. This is...

482
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,526
-insane. -This is--
-You're going
to make some dough.

483
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,827
You're going to make some dough

484
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:54,194
with this next one, all right?

485
00:34:54,963 --> 00:34:57,397
I'd hate for your mom and dad
to get these pictures,

486
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:59,399
you know, or anybody else
back home.

487
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:03,871
Well, no one should see you
this way, okay?

488
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,373
Look, here's how it works.

489
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:09,443
You pay me back
for all I've done for you.

490
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:11,679
You know, keeping a roof
over your head.

491
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:14,114
Pretty things on your hot body.

492
00:35:15,016 --> 00:35:16,116
Whatever you want.

493
00:35:16,884 --> 00:35:18,285
Just till you pay me back.

494
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,522
I'll keep these safe
and keep you safe.

495
00:35:24,191 --> 00:35:25,526
It's a dangerous world.

496
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:28,195
Parents get killed.

497
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:30,865
Friends get killed.

498
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:33,500
No one ever knows.

499
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:37,137
Come on.

500
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:40,675
Come on, let's go.

501
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:42,442
-No, I don't, I don't wanna go.
-Let's go!

502
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:44,277
-I--
-Let's go.

503
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,547
Let's go

504
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:48,850
I don't want to do this.

505
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:00,828
The doorman had this for you.

506
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:03,698
-Oh.
-You get a lot of packages.

507
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:06,233
-You seeing that girl?
-You don't have
to wait up for me.

508
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:07,802
What's her last name?

509
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,539
-I don't know.
-Well, you can't go over
to her place,

510
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:13,373
if you don't know her last name,

511
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:17,377
-I'll ask.
-She's not the kind
of girl that,

512
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,346
I picture you with.

513
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:23,051
You used to be happy
if I was with any girl.

514
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:27,454
Well, I'm not up to having
visitors like her around here.

515
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:31,592
-This is my place too.
-I only want the best for you.

516
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,261
And I don't think she's it.

517
00:36:35,663 --> 00:36:37,965
I liked your paintings better
when they have color in them.

518
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,535
Well, this is the way life feels
without your grandpa.

519
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:43,104
I hope my life
never feels that way.

520
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,789
You're early, very early.

521
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,525
I, I forgot to tell you
to use the back entrance.

522
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:06,928
I was excited to start
our movie night.

523
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:08,930
You look pretty.

524
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:10,932
I didn't realize
you were just visiting.

525
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:14,367
No, this is where I live.
I've tried to make it my home.

526
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,641
Oh, you have a roommate,

527
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:21,976
That's Goldie.

528
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:27,682
-Oh, that's okay.
-Clutter distracts me.

529
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,953
I'm surprised you're not
in a house or apartment.

530
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,790
Anton got the place.

531
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:38,659
Worked out a deal.

532
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:41,896
He likes to keep
all his actresses together.

533
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:45,867
And he keeps
most of what I make.

534
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,671
Welcome to showbiz.

535
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:55,610
What's that?

536
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,947
Oh, that's Theo.

537
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,416
Every week I stuff
ten bucks in him

538
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,753
so I could go to a drama school,

539
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,956
at the University
of Washington someday.

540
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:11,358
It's gonna take
a lot of stuffing.

541
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:13,493
I know.

542
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:15,630
Just stupid dream.

543
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,933
But Theo keeps me going.

544
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:23,037
- It's just a bra.
- It gets my heart racing.

545
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:26,274
Nothing wrong with that.

546
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:29,911
There is, if you're waiting
until marriage to make love.

547
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:37,752
You don't have to wait.

548
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:45,760
It's a sign that you're bonded
and committed to someone
for the rest of your life.

549
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:50,198
Or it's a sign
you like to have a good time.

550
00:38:50,731 --> 00:38:52,700
Are you waiting
for that special someone?

551
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:56,436
Did I hurt your feelings?

552
00:38:56,938 --> 00:38:59,507
I try to ask that
if someone's face changes.

553
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:07,915
You're cute.

554
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:09,416
Are these your parents?

555
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:11,451
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

556
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:17,424
Where's your dad
in this picture?

557
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:18,793
He left us.

558
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:21,062
Fine by me.

559
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,531
His brother did things
he shouldn't

560
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:25,900
and Dad always denied it.

561
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,836
I'm just glad my uncle
couldn't get to me anymore.

562
00:39:29,804 --> 00:39:31,138
I try not to think about it.

563
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,841
It's too hurtful.

564
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:35,676
I've been hurt, too.

565
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:41,048
My parents didn't do so well
with their relationship, either.

566
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:45,186
I had to have a lot of sessions
with therapists.

567
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:48,589
It was too much for them.
So my grandparents took
my brother and I in.

568
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:56,864
My dad says he needs to find
himself before he can find us.

569
00:39:57,765 --> 00:40:02,303
My grandma says that he'll never
find himself at the bottom of
a bottle, whatever that means.

570
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:07,440
I'm sorry. Looks like Anton
needs me tonight, after all.

571
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,211
What do you think?

572
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:14,248
-Gold or pink.
-I like the one you have on.

573
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:18,152
It sounds like a heart beating.

574
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:20,922
Maybe that's me.

575
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:24,859
Good night, Violet.

576
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,928
Good night, Goldie.

577
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:31,098
Oh, what's your last name?

578
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,202
-Black.
-Your name is two colors.

579
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,805
You told me black
is the absence of color.

580
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,840
You were listening.

581
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:16,310
- How was the audition?
- They're all the same.

582
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:17,878
This guy wore his wedding ring.

583
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:19,013
So gross.

584
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:20,214
Why is that gross?

585
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:22,650
Yeah, you're right.

586
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:24,919
It'll be better next time.

587
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,355
I created an algorithm that

588
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,825
searches for auditions
for women in your age range.

589
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,927
Lot of modelling opportunities.

590
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:38,132
Shawn, thank you.

591
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,768
I'd love to be going
for other parts.

592
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:43,037
I just wanted you to make it.

593
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:50,644
Okay, too much.

594
00:41:58,152 --> 00:42:01,288
You know, it's tough making it
to all auditions

595
00:42:01,422 --> 00:42:02,990
if I'm seeing you in between.

596
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:07,795
Maybe we shouldn't see each
other on my work nights anymore.

597
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:11,599
-I didn't know. I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

598
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:15,002
You'll get a great role someday.

599
00:42:15,136 --> 00:42:20,074
Look, student film,
casting female in her twenties.

600
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:24,278
Good looking, to play a woman
with a wounded past,

601
00:42:24,412 --> 00:42:26,515
multiple personalities.
That could be you.

602
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:27,982
I think it is me.

603
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:31,819
A joke.

604
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:57,278
-My next audition.
-You could skip it.

605
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:58,712
If I do, Anton will find me.

606
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:01,115
Somehow he always knows
where I am.

607
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:06,821
-What are you doing?
-Turning off your GPS.

608
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:10,091
- That's how he tracks me.
- Mm-hmm.

609
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:12,693
I know some fun things
we could do.

610
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,495
Okay.

611
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:15,629
I'll grab my jacket

612
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:17,398
and then we'll have a fun time.

613
00:43:18,632 --> 00:43:19,733
I promise.

614
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:51,031
It's open.

615
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:56,137
-Where have you been?
-I'm sorry I'm so late.

616
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,607
- I've got something special planned.
-  -Oh.

617
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:02,143
Uh, Shawn,
this is Alicia and Nadia.

618
00:44:03,545 --> 00:44:04,845
They're friends of mine.

619
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:08,716
I thought you and I
were having dinner.

620
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,285
I'll share, they were hungry.

621
00:44:11,852 --> 00:44:16,924
My grandma's coming home
thinking she's having dinner
with just me.

622
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:19,260
You were a surprise.

623
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:24,131
All of you would be
too much of a surprise.

624
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,501
I love surprises,
but I wish you told me.

625
00:44:27,636 --> 00:44:29,136
I didn't want you
to get nervous.

626
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,406
You must make a lot of money
to afford this place, huh.

627
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:34,775
It's my grandma's. I do coding.

628
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,477
Me too.

629
00:44:36,611 --> 00:44:37,745
Gets me through the day.

630
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:39,013
You know how to code?

631
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:41,916
Oh, no, I thought
you said codeine.

632
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:45,819
-We should do this another time.
-Are you all actresses?

633
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:49,823
You're not going to get much
from Miss talkative here.

634
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:52,693
- We should go, girls.
- Wait.

635
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:56,063
-What's wrong?
-No, it's fine.

636
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:59,867
I just, I can't miss an audition
again or turn off my GPS.

637
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,435
Did Anton hurt you?

638
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:05,206
He lost control,
happens now and then.

639
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:08,677
-He likes us to be professional.
-That's not right.

640
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:11,011
Let's come up with a plan
for that special dinner.

641
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:27,596
How was Bible study?

642
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:31,298
Well, if more women were like
the women from the Bible,

643
00:45:31,432 --> 00:45:33,934
this world would be
a much better place.

644
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:38,272
- The--
- Don't blow this for me.

645
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:41,041
-I'm in it for the long game.
-I'm not.

646
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:47,481
I think Douglas has some mail
for you downstairs.

647
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:51,986
Oh, uh, oh, oh, I thought
we were cooking dinner.

648
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:53,754
I'm not ready yet.

649
00:45:57,626 --> 00:46:01,996
I smell bug spray
or, or is it perfume?

650
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:17,478
-We've get out of here.
-Just give it a sec.

651
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:20,814
- I hear whispering.
- Huh.

652
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:23,117
-What is this?
-Put it back.

653
00:46:23,884 --> 00:46:25,720
Is something moving?

654
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,496
What is going on?

655
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:39,601
Uh, she was looking at your
ant thing and they got all over.

656
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:42,737
Why do white people
keep ants for pets?

657
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,608
Grandma, you remember Violet?
These are her friends.

658
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,275
Lisa and Nadia.

659
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,911
Is that your real name? Violet?

660
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:52,112
Of course it is, Grandma.

661
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:54,982
Oh, let's hope it is.

662
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:57,652
Well, it's uh, more
of a stage name.

663
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:00,020
No one uses their real name.

664
00:47:00,888 --> 00:47:01,989
What is your real name?

665
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:05,993
It's Olivia.

666
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,928
That's pretty.

667
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:12,866
Well, I can't wait to discover
more about Olivia Black.

668
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,536
- Call me Violet.
- That's why I wanted you

669
00:47:14,669 --> 00:47:15,804
to have dinner together

670
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:17,237
so you could get
to know each other.

671
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:19,406
Did I tell you she wants
to study acting at U-Dub?

672
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:21,842
Well, what about
your spiritual life?

673
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:24,378
Are you a follower of Jesus?

674
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:26,748
Sure.

675
00:47:27,716 --> 00:47:30,250
What's the name of your church?

676
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:32,186
Church of the...

677
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:35,790
Holy Grail.

678
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:37,991
That's great. I didn't know.

679
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:42,731
Well, I think we all should go
to your church this Sunday.

680
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,532
It's much better than dinner.

681
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,433
Or maybe Violet could
come visit our church.

682
00:47:46,568 --> 00:47:49,671
Oh, I want to go to hers.
Who's your pastor?

683
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,405
Monty Python?

684
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,708
I'd love if Violet
could come with us.

685
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:54,743
I'd love to go.

686
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,812
Well, you'll have to rethink
your wardrobe.

687
00:47:57,945 --> 00:48:01,014
-She can dress how she likes.
-We need to get going.

688
00:48:05,787 --> 00:48:07,921
We'll see you on Sunday.

689
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,667
You really like
that bow tie, huh?

690
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:23,303
I was thinking maybe we could
spend a little more time
programming,

691
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:25,906
and little less time trying
to be fancy, huh.

692
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:29,677
-I'm hoping to be groom someday.
-Let me give you some advice.

693
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:32,112
Love is blind.

694
00:48:32,747 --> 00:48:36,250
But marriage,
that's an eye opener.

695
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:40,988
Grandma.

696
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:43,490
I told Violet
we'd be at church early.

697
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:50,364
Shawn, I can't stand by...

698
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:53,100
as you...

699
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:02,911
I'll call 911.

700
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:04,612
It's, it's a panic attack.

701
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:07,080
Just tell me
everything will be okay.

702
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:10,484
-Everything will be okay.
-You've got to mean it.

703
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:12,720
You're sure this isn't
the diabetes?

704
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:14,288
This is how it started
with Grandpa.

705
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:16,023
You're making it worse.

706
00:49:16,658 --> 00:49:18,626
Everything will be okay.

707
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:22,597
Everything will be okay.

708
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:26,366
Everything will be okay.

709
00:49:29,203 --> 00:49:31,639
We never know when
our time will come.

710
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:34,742
What brought that on?

711
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:37,812
What do you think?

712
00:49:37,946 --> 00:49:41,516
Something isn't right about
that girl you're seeing.

713
00:49:42,717 --> 00:49:43,618
She's a woman.

714
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,689
- Let's go now.
- Oh, please be sensitive.

715
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:50,157
I need to let this pass.

716
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,193
Tell Douglas to hold the car.

717
00:50:05,507 --> 00:50:07,374
Now you, uh, sure you all right?

718
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:09,544
You gave me quite a scare.

719
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:11,546
It's still ticking,

720
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:14,181
-but thank you
for asking, Douglas.
-Yeah.

721
00:50:14,816 --> 00:50:16,149
What a beautiful day.

722
00:50:16,918 --> 00:50:20,522
I wish I had someone to go
for a walk with me when
I get off work at five.

723
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:24,859
Hmm. I think you might find
someone.

724
00:50:24,993 --> 00:50:26,326
This is for you.

725
00:50:26,728 --> 00:50:29,531
Oh, and I found this.

726
00:50:29,664 --> 00:50:32,567
-I think it's yours.
-Isn't that the pin you bought?

727
00:50:35,003 --> 00:50:36,671
Thank you, Mrs. Lambert.

728
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,675
Who sends you
all those packages?

729
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:42,242
Don't worry about it.

730
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,111
I'd really like to open it.

731
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:46,581
Fine.

732
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:48,348
Thanks.

733
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:53,086
He knows I haven't
painted in colors

734
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,689
since your grandpa passed away.

735
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:58,860
The doorman's the one
that's been sending you
all these packages.

736
00:50:59,761 --> 00:51:02,162
- He must really like you.
- Oh,

737
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:04,966
they're just
little gifts, Shawn.

738
00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:06,400
Why won't you date him?

739
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,202
I'm not, we're not--

740
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,405
Don't be absurd.

741
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:13,173
He's the doorman.

742
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:16,711
-How do you think it would lock?
-Why do you care?

743
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:20,515
Well, at my age,
not acting on love is,

744
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:24,919
the closest I'll come to ever
living out a Jane Austen novel.

745
00:51:25,053 --> 00:51:26,219
Jane Austen?

746
00:51:27,454 --> 00:51:29,456
You, you wouldn't understand.

747
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:32,894
I told her we'd be here early.

748
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:34,762
Maybe she came and left.

749
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:37,532
She's probably at her church
of the Holy Grail,

750
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:40,200
sitting next to King Arthur.

751
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:42,570
-Maybe.
-Oh,

752
00:51:42,704 --> 00:51:45,607
girls like her tend
to stay away from the light.

- I'm sorry.
-  I didn't-- -No, this is an exit row.

759
00:52:23,377 --> 00:52:24,679
We need to keep it open.

760
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:27,280
Oh.

00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,975
-We're up front.
-I got called in.

771
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:30,444
-On a Sunday?
-Yeah.

772
00:53:31,478 --> 00:53:32,847
I wish I could say no.

773
00:53:33,548 --> 00:53:34,749
I like that song.

774
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:36,416
Feels hopeful.

775
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:38,720
It's "Amazing Grace."

776
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:40,555
Hmm, really is.

777
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:45,358
A car is coming to pick me.

778
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,869
If we were married,
you wouldn't have to worry
about auditions or money.

779
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:57,805
I'm serious.

780
00:53:58,573 --> 00:54:00,440
I always thought I needed
someone to take care of me,

781
00:54:00,575 --> 00:54:03,911
but now I can see you need
someone to take care
of you, too.

782
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:06,413
I don't know what
to say to that.

783
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:08,415
Am I someone you would marry?

784
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:13,955
Shawn, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

785
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,124
We can get to know one another,

786
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,926
as we spend the rest of our
lives taking care of each other.

787
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:24,397
I have a past
or the present life.

788
00:54:26,067 --> 00:54:27,668
I've been with men before.

789
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,505
I didn't wait for marriage.

790
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:36,376
Everyone has a past.

791
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:39,080
But God gives us
a new beginning.

792
00:54:39,213 --> 00:54:41,582
That's what that "Amazing Grace"
song is all about.

793
00:54:44,118 --> 00:54:47,755
I've read up on autism,
but there's a lot I don't know.

794
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:49,557
I need some help,

795
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:51,159
paying bills,

796
00:54:51,726 --> 00:54:53,528
making some decisions.

797
00:54:53,995 --> 00:54:56,597
Reading people's faces,
maybe what to wear now and then.

798
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:59,734
Though Colin's been a big help
in that department.

799
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:02,502
And your family?

800
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:03,938
They would have to accept you

801
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:05,338
if we were married.

802
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:09,243
Your grandma would think
I married you for her money.

803
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:10,545
I don't care.

804
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:16,284
Violet, I've been waiting
my whole life for that
special someone.

805
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:18,519
You've been carrying
that around?

806
00:55:18,653 --> 00:55:21,055
For when someone's color
sounds right to me.

807
00:55:25,893 --> 00:55:26,794
That's for me.

808
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:32,033
Will you marry me, Violet?

809
00:55:39,707 --> 00:55:41,843
Marriage didn't work out
so well for my parents.

810
00:55:42,442 --> 00:55:43,811
We can be different.

811
00:55:44,344 --> 00:55:46,413
Marriage is a big deal to me.

812
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:49,317
That's why you shouldn't waste
it on someone like me.

813
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:51,786
Loving someone is never a waste.

814
00:57:06,694 --> 00:57:09,797
I have, I have
to get used to that.

815
00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:12,199
Of course.

816
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:15,937
Let's do this.

817
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,936
I'm meeting with a therapist
to learn how to desensitize.

818
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:52,106
That's great.

819
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:57,778
We're not going the right way.

820
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:00,480
I have a quick condition, first.

821
00:58:00,982 --> 00:58:03,050
-But our dinner--
-We have time.

822
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:04,518
Unzip me.

823
00:58:12,526 --> 00:58:13,761
-How'd you do?
-He wants me back.

824
00:58:13,894 --> 00:58:15,463
-Wow.
-He really likes me.

825
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:16,496
Of course he did.

826
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:19,133
I just have to get these lines
done by Thursday.

827
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:20,735
I'm so proud of you.

828
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:30,277
Shawn almost fell in love
with a disaster.

829
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:32,513
Colin, Grandma.

830
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:36,050
I'd like you to meet
the newest member of our family.

831
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:38,519
We just got married.

832
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:45,893
Tell me you're joking.

833
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:46,927
We're not going to go

834
00:58:47,061 --> 00:58:48,062
on a honeymoon right away.

835
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:49,196
I still have to save up.

836
00:58:50,765 --> 00:58:52,366
I told him I didn't need one.

837
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,968
Shawn, is this a joke?

838
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:55,603
You know,
I'm not good at pretend.

839
00:58:56,237 --> 00:58:57,738
I figured Violet can
stay at our place

840
00:58:57,872 --> 00:58:59,540
until we can afford
something of our own.

841
00:58:59,974 --> 00:59:02,643
Well, it's not our place.
It's mine.

842
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:06,547
-And absolutely not.
-But she's family now.

843
00:59:07,114 --> 00:59:09,850
Oh, I did a background check.

844
00:59:11,118 --> 00:59:13,254
Ask her how many times
she's been arrested.

845
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:15,656
You've been arrested?

846
00:59:18,325 --> 00:59:19,427
I told you I had a past.

847
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:23,898
Well, maybe she can explain
to you what it's like to be...

848
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:27,034
arrested for solicitation.

849
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:32,740
Violet, are you
or are you not a prostitute?

850
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:46,754
- Let her go.
- Violet.

851
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:49,156
- Stop.
- She's my bride.

852
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,092
Well, your bride is
taking my rings

853
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:53,327
-to the nearest pawn shop.
-Doesn't make any sense.

854
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:55,362
She got a call back
from her audition today.

855
00:59:55,496 --> 00:59:57,932
-No, she's being called back
to some guy's bed.
-Don't say that.

856
00:59:58,065 --> 00:59:59,733
Shawn.

857
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:03,137
Who knows how many men
she's been with,
how many diseases she has.

858
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,206
- My God.
- Grandma.

859
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:09,009
-God. Grandma.
-Just tell her everything
will be okay.

860
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:10,744
Will it?

861
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:13,080
These are lines
from her audition today.

862
01:00:32,867 --> 01:00:34,101
Violet.

863
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,174
- Violet.
- Go.

864
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,143
What the hell
are you doing, man?

865
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:43,911
-That's my wife.
-A world girl, pal.

866
01:00:44,044 --> 01:00:46,280
Get to steppin'

867
01:00:48,682 --> 01:00:49,518
Go.

868
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:53,721
We can get it annulled.

869
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:56,490
No one will know
it ever happened.

870
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:57,592
I was...

871
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:02,163
- so stupid.
- No, no. Don't, don't.
Don't say that.

872
01:01:03,164 --> 01:01:08,269
It's hard for you
to know who to trust.

873
01:01:11,205 --> 01:01:13,040
I can't even trust myself.

874
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:16,877
That's why I'm here.

875
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:20,848
You won't be here forever.

876
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:39,634
What's going on
with your algorithms?

877
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:40,868
It's done.

878
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:43,204
That's your score.

879
01:01:45,607 --> 01:01:46,840
I'm two. That's great.

880
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:50,010
-Why am I not a one?
-Best score is ten.

881
01:01:51,979 --> 01:01:53,280
Hmm. Something's off.

882
01:01:53,682 --> 01:01:55,382
Analysis questions you answered.

883
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:58,587
How many people rejected
your profile online.

884
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:00,087
Wow, you did it wrong.

885
01:02:00,622 --> 01:02:04,158
That's an objective rating
of your history.
Two out of ten.

886
01:02:09,664 --> 01:02:11,799
Your time is a complete waste
of my money.

887
01:02:11,932 --> 01:02:14,902
I don't think so.
People should know
what they're getting into.

888
01:02:15,637 --> 01:02:18,839
Look, I can't keep shelling out
money to have you here.

889
01:02:18,973 --> 01:02:21,475
I need something that makes
our app stand out,

890
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:23,678
not make people feel like crap.

891
01:02:24,345 --> 01:02:27,948
And, and never run me
through your program again.

892
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:37,525
Don't forget the party tonight.

893
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:41,295
What happened
to your wedding pictures?

894
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,063
They're just pretend.

895
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:46,233
Everything is pretend.

896
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:50,237
You're not yourself.

897
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,176
I thought I found someone.

898
01:02:57,646 --> 01:02:59,947
It turns out she wasn't
who I thought she was.

899
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:05,486
Everyone hides who they are
until they know they're loved.

900
01:03:05,986 --> 01:03:07,154
So I thought I did love her.

901
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:11,492
Did you love her for who she is
or who you want her to be?

902
01:03:13,394 --> 01:03:17,666
Love is like friendship
that has caught on fire.

903
01:03:18,332 --> 01:03:20,301
Might want to figure out
if you're burning.

904
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:22,469
-Burning?
-If you love her.

905
01:03:25,674 --> 01:03:26,940
If she loved you,

906
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:29,977
she wouldn't have gone back
to sleeping around.

907
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,345
You're right.

908
01:03:33,715 --> 01:03:39,186
Look, I will help you find
someone that would never
cheat on you.

909
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,590
Someone you love so much

910
01:03:42,724 --> 01:03:46,894
you couldn't stand the idea
of her being with someone else.

911
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:49,029
She's out there.

912
01:03:49,698 --> 01:03:51,599
Maybe she'll be
at the party tonight?

913
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:55,704
Nah, should go
by yourself tonight.

914
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:59,674
Okay? You're an adult.
Just be careful who you talk to.

915
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:26,400
-Where's my Violet?
-Busy.

916
01:04:27,368 --> 01:04:29,103
Tell her I'm thinking about her.

917
01:04:47,689 --> 01:04:49,923
I need to know why you were
at the Pimps and Hoes Party.

918
01:04:50,525 --> 01:04:52,192
So you could break my heart.
Obviously.

919
01:04:52,326 --> 01:04:55,496
-You know my boss, Jake?
-Sure. We all do.

920
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:58,932
-How well do you know him?
-He likes to give his guests
encouragement.

921
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,403
Me and the girls
are very encouraging.

922
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,038
I need to know what that means.

923
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,810
He fixed up with Anton for us
to spend time with the parties.

924
01:05:09,276 --> 01:05:11,813
Jake thought would be a good fit
with girls from the site.

925
01:05:12,547 --> 01:05:15,282
He's not that bad.
A good tipper.

926
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,151
Have you been with him, Violet?

927
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:19,119
It doesn't matter anymore.
We're over.

928
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:21,321
-No more using each other.
-I didn't use you.

929
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:24,759
I needed a ticket out of here.
And you needed a babysitter.

930
01:05:25,527 --> 01:05:28,162
I told you not to waste
marriage on me.

931
01:05:28,295 --> 01:05:29,798
You should have told me
what you do.

932
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,699
So you can treat me
like your grandma does?

933
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:33,100
You lied about the auditions.

934
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:34,769
So I'm not
who you thought I was.

935
01:05:35,135 --> 01:05:36,503
Time to move on.

936
01:05:37,337 --> 01:05:39,440
This is obviously
where I belong.

937
01:05:40,007 --> 01:05:43,578
I miss laughing with you,
talking about the day,
having a meal.

938
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:45,446
You'll get over me.

939
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,450
Do you miss me?

940
01:05:50,017 --> 01:05:51,686
I don't miss any of my clients.

941
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,721
I wasn't a client.

942
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:58,492
A non-paying client,
the worst kind.

943
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:02,095
Now, please be like the rest
of my clients and leave.

944
01:06:12,005 --> 01:06:13,440
I thought you cared about me.

945
01:06:14,408 --> 01:06:15,976
I thought we had a future.

946
01:06:16,878 --> 01:06:18,479
I was playing you.

947
01:06:19,413 --> 01:06:22,650
Maybe you'd seen that
if you weren't so autistic.

948
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:33,460
Your face changed.

949
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:38,666
I got so mad when I thought
you had been with Jake.

950
01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:42,369
You're not just a replacement
for my grandma.

951
01:06:47,107 --> 01:06:48,242
I love you.

952
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:51,946
You're not the first guy
to say that.

953
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:54,381
But you're still
wearing the rings.

954
01:06:57,752 --> 01:06:59,019
And the wedding dress.

955
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:06,794
A girl like me isn't going to
wear this kind of dress again.

956
01:07:12,734 --> 01:07:15,202
You can't love me after
everything I've done.

957
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:18,840
You're my escape plan.
My future inheritance.

958
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:20,374
That's all.

959
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:22,476
I don't think that's all.

960
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:28,683
Well, one of us have
a special first night.

961
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:31,184
Then you lied about
that audition.

962
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:34,388
I just went through
the motions with that guy.

963
01:07:35,023 --> 01:07:36,390
Buy his time.

964
01:07:37,926 --> 01:07:41,495
And after the restaurant,
when you ran after me,

965
01:07:42,931 --> 01:07:44,599
I couldn't be with anyone else.

966
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:47,267
You got into that car.

967
01:07:49,971 --> 01:07:51,305
I pretended that I got sick.

968
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:58,713
Hmm. I've been here ever since,

969
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:02,550
telling myself you're
too good to be true.

970
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:15,429
I always thought it would be
hard to love someone.

971
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:20,735
To really love someone for real.

972
01:08:23,071 --> 01:08:24,639
But

973
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:27,542
I never thought it would be so
hard to let someone love me.

974
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:38,218
I've missed the way
you see the world,

975
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,287
your bad jokes,

976
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,323
the way you care about me.

977
01:08:59,741 --> 01:09:02,175
- They ran out
of people.

978
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:13,387
In case you want
to trace ants together.

979
01:09:24,098 --> 01:09:26,199
I wondered if we could
runaway together, but...

980
01:09:27,702 --> 01:09:29,503
I don't know why I thought
my pimp never let me go.

981
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:32,239
When were you going
to tell me about your past?

982
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:36,243
When I knew you really
loved me, I guess.

983
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:39,580
How can I really love you
if I didn't know who you were?

984
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:42,382
Hmm.

985
01:09:44,652 --> 01:09:46,319
Gluten and dairy free.

986
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,769
This is the song I wanted
to play for our first dance.

987
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:14,615
I've been practicing
desensitization techniques.

988
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,118

1022
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:36,524
Good morning, sweetie.

1023
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:40,294
I can't afford you to be sick
no more. Neither can you.

1024
01:12:40,695 --> 01:12:42,230
Come on. You've got
a star client waiting.

1025
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:43,931
-The big tipper.
-I'm with a friend.

1026
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:45,398
Her husband.

1027
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:47,902
She doesn't work
for you anymore.

1028
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:53,074
She's mine until
she pays off her debt.

1029
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:54,108
Her debt?

1030
01:12:54,942 --> 01:12:55,843
Yeah.

1031
01:12:56,577 --> 01:12:57,712
This place ain't cheap.

1032
01:12:58,546 --> 01:12:59,680
This town is pricey.

1033
01:13:02,116 --> 01:13:04,085
How much to release her
from you?

1034
01:13:06,687 --> 01:13:07,788
She ain't for sale.

1035
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:10,591
You put a price tag on her
every night.

1036
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:12,627
Five thousand?

1037
01:13:18,299 --> 01:13:19,399
Ten.

1038
01:13:20,433 --> 01:13:21,636
Then you'll let her go?

1039
01:13:24,305 --> 01:13:25,673
Are you serious about this?

1040
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:30,077
All right, anybody else
gets involved,

1041
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:33,047
and you don't see
your wife again.

1042
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:36,083
Or your fancy grandma.

1043
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:38,519
Got it?

1044
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:44,491
And you keep her off
the streets.

1045
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:51,431
For fifteen thousand
I'll keep her off the streets
under my watchful eye.

1046
01:13:55,336 --> 01:13:56,938
I'll see you real soon.

1047
01:14:04,378 --> 01:14:05,713
I love you, too.

1048
01:14:10,885 --> 01:14:14,121
Are you ready to start
the annulment process?

1049
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:19,093
Violet and I are going
to stay together.

1050
01:14:19,593 --> 01:14:21,796
I just need to pay her debt

1051
01:14:21,929 --> 01:14:23,831
so I can buy her back
from her pimp.

1052
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:26,567
Fifteen thousand dollars.

1053
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:31,205
You don't need to buy
an impossible marriage.

1054
01:14:31,339 --> 01:14:32,606
You can get that for free.

1055
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:35,276
Grandma, I know you have
that kind of money.

1056
01:14:35,643 --> 01:14:37,078
I can do five thousand

1057
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:38,980
but that's taking out
cash advances

1058
01:14:39,113 --> 01:14:40,548
and giving everything I've got.

1059
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:43,483
Well, maybe he'll give
you a discount.

1060
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:45,086
Does he take coupons?

1061
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:49,924
I have spent my entire
life taking care of you.

1062
01:14:50,758 --> 01:14:53,194
And you get married in secret.

1063
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:56,731
-Without bagpipes.
-Bagpipes?

1064
01:14:56,864 --> 01:15:02,103
You told grandpa that you'd have
bagpipes at your wedding
to honor our heritage.

1065
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:05,272
You wanted me to marry
someone who's like a woman
from the Bible.

1066
01:15:05,406 --> 01:15:08,376
-Because you'd be better off.
-Rahab was a woman
from the Bible.

1067
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:11,912
She was a prostitute,
wasn't she related to Jesus?

1068
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:13,481
And what about Mary Magdalene?

1069
01:15:13,614 --> 01:15:14,782
She had her issues

1070
01:15:14,915 --> 01:15:16,884
and she saw Jesus
rise from the dead.

1071
01:15:17,018 --> 01:15:18,019
Please.

1072
01:15:19,186 --> 01:15:21,822
If God can help someone
who isn't perfect,

1073
01:15:21,956 --> 01:15:24,725
which is all of us,
then why can't you?

1074
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:28,629
I think it's because
you don't want to love anymore.

1075
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:32,733
- Now you're being mean.
-  -"I have never been in love.

1076
01:15:32,867 --> 01:15:36,837
It is not my way
or in my nature and
I do not think I ever shall."

1077
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:38,305
Jane Austen said that.

1078
01:15:39,173 --> 01:15:40,041
I looked it up.

1079
01:15:40,641 --> 01:15:42,043
I was joking when I said

1080
01:15:42,176 --> 01:15:44,545
I wanted to live like
one of her novels.

1081
01:15:45,112 --> 01:15:48,816
Well, the joke's on the doorman
and on my wife,

1082
01:15:49,683 --> 01:15:52,053
and on your colorless paintings.

1083
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:56,357
You're late for work.

1084
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:59,160
And you better
bring back my rings.

1085
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,717
Who put all my stuff
in this box?

1086
01:16:24,985 --> 01:16:27,254
I hope you have more luck
finding your next job,

1087
01:16:27,388 --> 01:16:29,657
then you've had finding
your next date.

1088
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:33,294
You didn't get the message?

1089
01:16:34,628 --> 01:16:36,664
I think we should ask people
where they're going,

1090
01:16:36,797 --> 01:16:38,132
who they'd like to be with,

1091
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:40,367
create algorithms based
on their answers,

1092
01:16:40,501 --> 01:16:43,003
make scores about the future
instead of the past.

1093
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:45,372
We need people
looking not finding.

1094
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:46,774
Finding is bad for business.

1095
01:16:46,907 --> 01:16:49,043
This will keep them
looking for someone

1096
01:16:49,176 --> 01:16:51,145
who matches their destiny score.

1097
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:53,147
It'll be unique to our app.
I could run you some examples--

1098
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,950
I think you need to concentrate
on your own destiny, Shawn.

1099
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:58,587
And I need help with Violet,
who you hired for your parties,

1100
01:16:58,953 --> 01:17:01,155
to get her out of prostitution.

1101
01:17:05,259 --> 01:17:07,027
I bring in performers
now and then.

1102
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:09,230
What they do in their own time
is up to them.

1103
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,533
If you loan me ten thousand
against my future salary,

1104
01:17:11,665 --> 01:17:13,134
I can buy back violets freedom.

1105
01:17:13,667 --> 01:17:17,404
Future salary? Shawn
you don't work here anymore.

1106
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,941
I'm not going to tell the police
unless you do it again.

1107
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:30,985
What am I supposed to do?
Hire clowns for my parties?

1108
01:17:31,118 --> 01:17:34,388
-Clowns are not sexy.
-Your business is growing.

1109
01:17:34,523 --> 01:17:36,657
Maybe you can find a place
for them here.

1110
01:17:41,061 --> 01:17:45,933
You know what? I hired
entertainers, nothing more.

1111
01:17:47,868 --> 01:17:50,037
Get to work on this
"destiny score" okay?

1112
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:51,972
I want to see some examples.

1113
01:17:59,947 --> 01:18:02,750
I'm proud of you
for standing up to Jake.

1114
01:18:02,883 --> 01:18:06,220
He's a work in progress.

1115
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:08,055
You don't know
what he's been doing.

1116
01:18:09,223 --> 01:18:10,424
I'm working on him.

1117
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:13,662
Just... I'm working on him.

1118
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:20,602
I want to be with Violet.

1119
01:18:21,468 --> 01:18:24,138
- I know she'll need
counselling, and--
- You got me in trouble.

1120
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:29,410
My manager saw me texting you,
and I told her about your crazy
idea to buy Violet back.

1121
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:30,911
It's not crazy.

1122
01:18:31,946 --> 01:18:35,950
Yeah, well, my manager
didn't think so, either.

1123
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:38,152
She told me that the beans
from some of our coffee

1124
01:18:38,285 --> 01:18:41,989
come from a town where
the profits help keep women
out of human trafficking.

1125
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:46,493
Made me realize that
I could help someone
who needs their freedom.

1126
01:18:50,965 --> 01:18:54,368
This is for Violet's debt.
That's two thousand.
That's all I have.

1127
01:19:05,846 --> 01:19:07,881
Why does your face
look like that?

1128
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,851
You've never hugged me, bro.

1129
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,520
It's worth it.

1130
01:19:20,327 --> 01:19:21,929
I have over half.

1131
01:19:25,299 --> 01:19:28,102
Mmm. The light's too bright.

1132
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:29,870
Okay.

1133
01:19:30,871 --> 01:19:32,106
You all right?

1134
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:33,874
Hmm.

1135
01:19:36,143 --> 01:19:37,478
Where's Goldie?

1136
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:39,980
In a better place.

1137
01:19:41,148 --> 01:19:43,083
Oh, I thought I cleaned
all that up.

1138
01:19:44,118 --> 01:19:45,219
what happened?

1139
01:19:46,655 --> 01:19:48,523
Wedding gift from Anton.

1140
01:19:48,989 --> 01:19:50,958
- I'm calling the police.
- No, please.

1141
01:19:51,091 --> 01:19:54,194
The police put girls like me
behind bars, not the guys
who pimp us.

1142
01:19:54,729 --> 01:19:57,898
Anton would make the girls
and I pay for that.

1143
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,335
Maybe he'll take what I have.

1144
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:04,371
That's so sweet.

1145
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:09,143
But even if you had everything,

1146
01:20:09,276 --> 01:20:11,680
he'd kill me before
he'd let me go.

1147
01:20:13,147 --> 01:20:17,117
I overheard him talking
to a gangbanger about
moving us to Portland.

1148
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:20,054
I'm glad I could see you
before he did.

1149
01:20:21,055 --> 01:20:23,057
You're coming
to my grandmother's home.

1150
01:20:25,225 --> 01:20:26,795
That's the first place
he'd look.

1151
01:20:27,828 --> 01:20:31,332
And I don't think
she'd exactly put out
the welcome mat.

1152
01:20:32,032 --> 01:20:33,367
My brother's place, then?

1153
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:38,540
Girls have tried to run away
from him before.

1154
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:44,178
He works with other gangs,
they track women down,
then they go missing.

1155
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:57,625
You should leave
before he comes back,

1156
01:20:58,827 --> 01:20:59,993
before it gets worse.

1157
01:21:01,495 --> 01:21:02,429
Not without you.

1158
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:06,835
As long as he thinks
we're together,
he'll know how to find me.

1159
01:21:07,702 --> 01:21:11,038
Then we'll have to make it seem
like we're not together anymore.

1160
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:12,873
Like we broke up.

1161
01:21:16,678 --> 01:21:19,012
Sweetie, the case is over.

1162
01:21:19,514 --> 01:21:22,282
You're right. He needs to think
we're over each other.

1163
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:23,283
Get out!

1164
01:21:24,686 --> 01:21:27,221
Don't you get it? It was all
a lie. You're just another John.

1165
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:29,189
- Tell me you love me.
- I do love you.

1166
01:21:29,323 --> 01:21:30,525
You don't know what love is

1167
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:32,159
and I am done selling
mine to you.

1168
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:33,927
Go over there. I'll slap you.

1169
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:36,063
-Too painful, can't handle pain.
-Shush.

1170
01:21:36,196 --> 01:21:37,599
-I'm very sensitive.
-Just,

1171
01:21:37,732 --> 01:21:39,133
just turn your head and
think of a painful time

1172
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:41,068
so it feels real or pretend.

1173
01:21:41,502 --> 01:21:44,238
- That's, that's method acting
or some
- Okay.

1174
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:46,273
I never want to see
your face again.

1175
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:49,176
We're finished. Over, done.

1176
01:21:51,044 --> 01:21:53,548
- Go away.
- I wish I never met you.

1177
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:54,982
Ahh.

1178
01:21:55,884 --> 01:21:57,619
I never want to see you again.

1179
01:22:01,723 --> 01:22:03,825
You're bothering my sweetie?

1180
01:22:03,957 --> 01:22:05,092
We're finished
together for good.

1181
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,263
We're over. He gets, he gets it.

1182
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:10,665
He was just leaving.

1183
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,367
Got my fifteen g's on you?

1184
01:22:17,504 --> 01:22:18,405
He gets it.

1185
01:22:20,608 --> 01:22:21,475
I don't think so.

1186
01:22:22,476 --> 01:22:24,646
Something wrong with the way
this one thinks.

1187
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:31,018
It's like I'm beating
a freaking kill here.

1188
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,734
Oh, what's this?

1189
01:22:47,836 --> 01:22:49,002
A going away present?

1190
01:22:50,504 --> 01:22:52,072
Hmm, nice.

1191
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,577
Time for you to go away.

1192
01:23:02,049 --> 01:23:05,252
Go out the back exit,
don't cause a scene.

1193
01:23:09,824 --> 01:23:10,859
You've got a guy coming up.

1194
01:23:11,726 --> 01:23:14,294
He doesn't care what you
look like. Just wants it dark.

1195
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:17,599
All right. No faces. Anonymous.

1196
01:23:18,332 --> 01:23:20,635
I'm, I'm still sick.
I need a doctor.

1197
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:23,705
I tell you what you need?

1198
01:23:25,205 --> 01:23:27,040
Now get the freaking lights off

1199
01:23:27,174 --> 01:23:29,042
and I'm gonna bring
him up right now.

1200
01:23:34,147 --> 01:23:35,583
And take off that toy ring.

1201
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:05,305
Good night.

1202
01:25:07,675 --> 01:25:11,211
-What happened?
-We were in a bad part of town.

1203
01:25:12,947 --> 01:25:13,848
We'll be all right.

1204
01:25:16,183 --> 01:25:19,854
-Have you called the police?
-We did everything we could.

1205
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:24,191
-There must be more to this.
-Well...

1206
01:25:26,527 --> 01:25:28,863
I wondered what Violet saw
in her pimp.

1207
01:25:30,965 --> 01:25:31,866
Then it hit me.

1208
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:38,205
Look at the colors on my face.

1209
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:40,474
What do you hear?

1210
01:25:55,023 --> 01:25:56,124
Trouble.

1211
01:25:57,357 --> 01:25:59,259
I got my wife back after all.

1212
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:00,728
How did I do it?

1213
01:26:02,229 --> 01:26:03,898
Beats me.

1214
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:08,235
You've clearly suffered
brain damage.

1215
01:26:09,403 --> 01:26:11,839
Shawn, please go to the bathroom

1216
01:26:11,973 --> 01:26:14,676
and wet a washcloth
and bring back a glass of water.

1217
01:26:14,809 --> 01:26:16,778
- All right, I can do that.
- No, no, it's fine.

1218
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:27,454
Ten thousand dollars,

1219
01:26:28,455 --> 01:26:32,960
if you leave my grandson
and Seattle and never come back.

1220
01:26:35,129 --> 01:26:36,229
Mm-hmm.

1221
01:26:37,832 --> 01:26:40,935
I heard you wanted to go
to the University of Washington.

1222
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:44,872
What's their school color?
Um, that's right, the violet.

1223
01:26:45,573 --> 01:26:48,308
How would Violet like
to be a violet?

1224
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:52,479
Just leave Shawn alone.

1225
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:55,917
Their color is purple.

1226
01:26:56,884 --> 01:27:00,487
And I know marriage
won't be easy.

1227
01:27:01,022 --> 01:27:03,323
I need counselling, rehab,

1228
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:07,528
but we're in this together.

1229
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:12,734
Twenty thousand.

1230
01:27:16,804 --> 01:27:19,040
I once thought
I wanted your money.

1231
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:22,577
But now I see my husband
is priceless.

1232
01:27:29,517 --> 01:27:31,586
I know what's important to you.

1233
01:27:42,395 --> 01:27:45,265
Um, hello, Douglas.

1234
01:27:49,302 --> 01:27:50,470
It's rather late.

1235
01:27:53,574 --> 01:27:54,675
Just a moment.

1236
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:57,745
There's an Anton here
to see you.

1237
01:28:02,016 --> 01:28:06,888
Douglas, um, we're
not having visitors tonight.

1238
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,990
Please show him out.

1239
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:12,059
Who was that?

1240
01:28:12,527 --> 01:28:14,394
Violet needs
to stay here tonight.

1241
01:28:17,397 --> 01:28:20,735
-I'm getting worried.
-We just need to figure
some things out.

1242
01:28:24,105 --> 01:28:26,439
You can sleep here tonight.

1243
01:28:28,142 --> 01:28:29,076
But tonight only.

1244
01:28:41,522 --> 01:28:43,057
We need to call the police.

1245
01:28:45,392 --> 01:28:46,828
They won't do anything.

1246
01:28:49,063 --> 01:28:50,031
When I moved here,

1247
01:28:52,066 --> 01:28:56,604
I had no money and Anton
took care of everything.

1248
01:28:58,973 --> 01:29:00,541
He'll say,
I was paying him back.

1249
01:29:00,675 --> 01:29:03,343
You don't pay someone back
with your body.

1250
01:29:06,547 --> 01:29:07,915
You think I wanted to?

1251
01:29:09,784 --> 01:29:12,687
Come on, you can do better
than that. Bottoms up.

1252
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:20,661
Every time I tried to stop,

1253
01:29:20,795 --> 01:29:23,396
he told me he'd kill me
if I didn't keep going.

1254
01:29:28,401 --> 01:29:30,805
So sorry.

1255
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:39,881
I, I, I found out later
the guy from the hotel

1256
01:29:40,014 --> 01:29:42,617
did that as a service
with different gangs.

1257
01:29:44,685 --> 01:29:46,053
That's how they break you.

1258
01:30:26,493 --> 01:30:30,430
Looks like the police have
a special squad that help
with human trafficking cases.

1259
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:35,202
I was paying a debt.

1260
01:30:36,436 --> 01:30:39,340
Human trafficking is the trade
of humans for the purpose of

1261
01:30:39,472 --> 01:30:44,946
forced labor, sexual slavery or
commercial sexual exploitation.

1262
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,815
Thank you, Mr. Google.

1263
01:30:51,252 --> 01:30:52,920
Anton is downstairs.

1264
01:30:59,794 --> 01:31:01,529
-I'll talk to him.
-No.

1265
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:05,967
-He'll never leave us alone.
-That's how he talks.

1266
01:31:07,201 --> 01:31:10,604
Douglas, please
make him go away.

1267
01:31:16,344 --> 01:31:19,180
You can send a text to get help.

1268
01:31:19,714 --> 01:31:22,249
Looks like they have rehab
and other services.

1269
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:32,693
Your pajamas look a lot like
what you wore yesterday.

1270
01:31:34,795 --> 01:31:36,664
I, I might have something
that fits you.

1271
01:31:37,465 --> 01:31:39,467
I need to pick up a few things
back at my place.

1272
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,469
You can't,
you can't go back there.

1273
01:31:41,869 --> 01:31:43,704
Anton doesn't
control me anymore.

1274
01:32:32,853 --> 01:32:35,890
You thought you could still get
back here without saying hello?

1275
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:39,528
You got a backlog of customers

1276
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:41,228
just waiting to get
a taste of you.

1277
01:32:41,362 --> 01:32:44,598
I've, I've worked
for you long enough.

1278
01:32:44,732 --> 01:32:46,200
And you keep coming back.

1279
01:32:46,634 --> 01:32:49,603
You know what?
I think you might need
a little taste of some.

1280
01:32:50,337 --> 01:32:52,139
Huh? Whatever you want.

1281
01:32:52,273 --> 01:32:54,675
You need a little
pick-me-up? Mm?

1282
01:32:54,809 --> 01:32:57,178
You want something stronger?
More? Done.

1283
01:32:58,547 --> 01:33:00,014
But you still have a debt to me.

1284
01:33:01,449 --> 01:33:04,051
You only counted everything as
a debt to keep me in this life.

1285
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:07,922
- You all just do what I had to do.
-  -What about Alicia?

1286
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:09,290
Nadia?

1287
01:33:10,525 --> 01:33:11,792
When is their debt going to end?

1288
01:33:11,926 --> 01:33:13,360
You know, they've never
had it so good.

1289
01:33:13,828 --> 01:33:15,830
And you, I always treated
like family.

1290
01:33:20,401 --> 01:33:21,268
You know what?

1291
01:33:21,969 --> 01:33:23,237
Let's get you back online.

1292
01:33:24,038 --> 01:33:27,341
But this time, I'll let you
pick who you meet with.

1293
01:33:28,075 --> 01:33:29,777
Well, within reason, of course.

1294
01:33:32,913 --> 01:33:35,649
You're a small operation,
I'm moving on.

1295
01:33:37,084 --> 01:33:39,787
Look, I got a meeting
with the Westside Gang.

1296
01:33:40,454 --> 01:33:41,655
We're gonna partner up.

1297
01:33:42,557 --> 01:33:43,791
They've got a lot of connections

1298
01:33:43,924 --> 01:33:45,759
and some feel good meds.

1299
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,728
You'll like it.

1300
01:33:50,731 --> 01:33:52,066
The band's gonna be hot tonight.

1301
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:02,209
I came here to prove to myself
I'm free from you.

1302
01:34:02,643 --> 01:34:06,413
Only think you proved is
just how stupid you really are.

1303
01:34:07,214 --> 01:34:09,083
I'm smarter than you think.

1304
01:34:58,465 --> 01:35:03,904
For God so loved the world that
he gave his one and only son.

1305
01:35:04,038 --> 01:35:06,508
God is a giver.
He's a generous guy.

1306
01:35:06,641 --> 01:35:09,611
There's nothing you can do
to add to that generosity.

1307
01:35:09,977 --> 01:35:13,814
In fact, you could say it this
way that there is nothing you
could possibly do in your life,

1308
01:35:14,315 --> 01:35:18,620
that could make God love you
more or less than
he does right now.

1309
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:24,526
<i>♪ Thou hast taught me to say ♪</i>

1310
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:27,294
<i>♪ It is well ♪</i>

1311
01:35:27,428 --> 01:35:34,468
<i>♪ It is well with my soul ♪</i>

1312
01:35:35,604 --> 01:35:39,406
<i>♪ It is well ♪</i>

1313
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:45,012
<i>♪ With my soul ♪</i>

1314
01:35:46,146 --> 01:35:48,749
<i>♪ It is well ♪</i>

1315
01:35:48,882 --> 01:35:55,456
<i>♪ It is well with my soul ♪</i>

1316
01:35:56,924 --> 01:35:59,260
<i>♪ It is well ♪</i>

1317
01:35:59,393 --> 01:36:05,899
<i>♪ It is well with my soul ♪</i>

1318
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:09,169
I saw you at church.

1319
01:36:10,804 --> 01:36:14,441
Between that and counselling
I'm a walking wound.

1320
01:36:14,908 --> 01:36:16,043
A healing wound.

1321
01:36:17,044 --> 01:36:18,979
I'd love for you to sit
by me next time.

1322
01:36:20,515 --> 01:36:21,415
We'll see.

1323
01:36:30,558 --> 01:36:31,925
That looks pricey.

1324
01:36:32,826 --> 01:36:33,894
It's called designment.

1325
01:36:34,395 --> 01:36:35,863
I wanted you to have
something to wear

1326
01:36:35,996 --> 01:36:37,431
while I saved up for a real one.

1327
01:36:49,043 --> 01:36:50,144
Thank you.

1328
01:36:55,082 --> 01:36:56,483
Your friends are here.

1329
01:36:57,719 --> 01:36:58,620
What friends?

1330
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,354
Did you invite someone?

1331
01:37:04,024 --> 01:37:05,560
We're out on a day pass.

1332
01:37:06,226 --> 01:37:09,163
-From jail?
-No, grandma, from rehab.

1333
01:37:12,099 --> 01:37:13,500
Delivery.

1334
01:37:13,635 --> 01:37:17,572
- What's going on?
- Scottish afternoon tea.

1335
01:37:19,173 --> 01:37:21,710
These shouldn't be
served from a box.

1336
01:37:21,842 --> 01:37:23,877
These are for you.

1337
01:37:28,115 --> 01:37:29,651
I wish I could paint like that.

1338
01:37:30,184 --> 01:37:31,919
Maybe grandma could teach you.

1339
01:37:33,187 --> 01:37:34,321
Delicious.

1340
01:39:14,656 --> 01:39:17,257
I think we should go
to Gasworks Park tonight.

1341
01:39:17,692 --> 01:39:18,593
Hmm.

1342
01:39:19,993 --> 01:39:21,161
I rather stay in.

1343
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:23,631
You know what I love
about that place?

1344
01:39:24,398 --> 01:39:25,700
People thought
it was worthless--

1345
01:39:25,834 --> 01:39:28,302
Until someone realized it
could be beautiful.

1346
01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:30,370
Actually, I was going to say

1347
01:39:30,504 --> 01:39:33,373
until someone realized that
all they needed was a new start.

1348
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:36,711
-Oh.
-We need a new start.

1349
01:39:38,045 --> 01:39:40,280
-We got one.
-Not for everything.

1350
01:39:42,851 --> 01:39:43,984
What are you doing?

1351
01:39:46,386 --> 01:39:48,021
Now that I know you,

1352
01:39:48,823 --> 01:39:49,724
all of you,

1353
01:39:51,759 --> 01:39:52,760
will you marry me?

1354
01:39:55,028 --> 01:39:56,497
I thought we were married.

1355
01:39:57,064 --> 01:39:58,165
Yes or no?

1356
01:40:00,635 --> 01:40:01,536
Yes.

1357
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:07,441
That car is for you.

1358
01:40:16,551 --> 01:40:18,586
I hope you still like surprises.

1359
01:41:26,588 --> 01:41:28,823
Well, dearly beloved,
we're gathered here today

1360
01:41:28,957 --> 01:41:31,826
in the sight of God,
to witness the joining together

1361
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,729
-of Shawn and Violet
in Holy Matrimony--
-Oliva.

1362
01:41:35,395 --> 01:41:36,798
It's Olivia.
