00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:04,759
Hi, I'm Amanda Tapping from
the television series "Sanctuary."

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,431
In May 2007,
the series first went online

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,168
in the form
of eight 15-minute webisodes.

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,436
What you're about to see

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,741
is the second hour of those
webisodes in their original form

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,577
for the first time on television.

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,207
Enjoy.

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:27,555
Madness. There's no other word for it.
And it will be your undoing.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,029
You must understand, Gregory,
the board has been patient with you,

10
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,362
but their generosity has limits.

11
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,526
As does their imagination!

12
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:40,629
Can you not fathom the secrets
we are on the verge of unlocking?

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,269
By accepting your hysterical
and outlandish case studies as fact?

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,576
You presume too much,
Gregory.

15
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,480
I believe we are done here.

16
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,649
Try to see the larger
implications, Gregory.

17
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,625
I am, sir.

18
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:06,722
The question is, are you?

19
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,802
You're a talented doctor, Gregory.

20
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,566
It would be a tragedy
if you lost your license to practice.

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,737
Miss Magnus.

22
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,183
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

23
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,081
I don't understand.

24
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,211
Why are they always
so angry at you?

25
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,222
They're not angry, sweetheart.
They're afraid.

26
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:35,658
- Of what?
- Oh, of being wrong, mainly.

27
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,993
- Just put it out of your mind.
- How can you say that?

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,499
- They mean to end your career.
- Helen...

29
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,931
- Let it go.
- Please, father.

30
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,232
What have you done
to make them so afraid of you?

31
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,173
Tell me.

32
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,813
I can't.

33
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,055
- I said, are you sure this is it?
- Keep your voice down!

34
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,429
We're trying to remain undetected.

35
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,163
That does require
a modicum of silence.

36
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,330
Modicum. Right.

37
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,275
WILL: Why are we hiding?

38
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,173
We're on an island
in the middle of nowhere.

39
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,508
And it's a crypt, not the Pentagon.

40
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,514
A crypt potentially
containing an elixir

41
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,244
capable of prolonging life
for centuries.

42
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,116
Such secrets are rarely left
unguarded.

43
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,849
- Yeah, but why can't we just...
- Look.

44
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:56,298
Keepers of the dead. Best
to be avoided if at all possible.

45
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,876
Right.

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,382
Okay.

47
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:12,424
I got "I'm going in" and "go around,"
but what was that wiggly one you did?

48
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,959
"I'm cutting off your allowance."

49
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,221
Let's go.

50
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,271
Take the other side.
Draw them away if you can.

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,871
- You're kidding, right?
- Go quickly, before they...

52
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,749
HELEN: Ashley?

53
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,362
DRUITT'S VOICE: My daughter.

54
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,056
Get down!

55
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:35,239
I know this was not
on the brochure!

56
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,868
This is why we don't work with Ernest.
His intel is hopeless! Ashley!

57
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,044
Go to the crypt! Go!

58
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,485
Mom!

59
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,374
I'm going in!

60
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,251
Doctor!

61
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,155
This might be my first crypt,

62
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,823
but aren't they supposed
to hold dead people?

63
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,315
Yes, yes, I realize
he's left me five messages.

64
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,284
That's why I'm returning his call.

65
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,581
Okay, okay.

66
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,885
When do you expect him
back in the office?

67
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:45,294
No, no, no, don't page him.
I'll... I'll call him back then.

68
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,888
Okay, thank you.

69
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,097
- Hey.
- Hi.

70
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,408
- So, that was some mission, huh?
- Ghouls, crypt.

71
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,573
- Standard fare.
- Uh, new guy. Still not sleeping.

72
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,412
No such thing as standard fare.

73
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,042
Great.

74
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:14,057
So, I was just wondering, um,
how are you doing? Since...

75
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,651
Since I learned my dad
was a time-traveling nutjob?

76
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,227
I was going to say
"troubled soul, " but...

77
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,232
Peachy. Thanks for asking.

78
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,029
Hey, uh...

79
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,366
You know, that's some pretty serious
information to be carrying around.

80
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,629
If you ever want to just, you know,

81
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:32,541
sit down and talk
and kind of let it out, I'm here.

82
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:41,714
Here's some advice about me.
I'm not big on "sharing."

83
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:46,087
So just stick to helping the freaks.
That's why you're here.

84
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,588
Ciao.

85
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,090
See you.

86
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,272
Three not-so-dead women
found in coffins.

87
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,114
- Just another day at the office.
- All three are comatose.

88
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,020
Fortunately, brain functions
and vital organs seem to be intact.

89
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,059
- So they're normal?
- Near as I can tell.

90
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,355
The scans aren't detecting
any physical anomalies,

91
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,657
but they can only tell us so much.

92
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,199
I'm administering
a time-released stimulant.

93
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,166
It should bring them back
to consciousness slowly,

94
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,329
with as little physical
trauma as possible.

95
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,134
What about emotional trauma?

96
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,709
That's more your department,
I should think.

97
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,368
Until they awaken,

98
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,276
we have to rely on more
traditional forensic methods.

99
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,578
Now, this fellow.

100
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,244
Fond memories.

101
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,619
These creatures
detected our presence early

102
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,854
and possessed unnatural
speed and strength.

103
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:00,262
- Definitely not normal.
- Not as you would define it, no.

104
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,004
I was about to gather
some fluid samples.

105
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,078
Care to assist?

106
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,842
WILL: Uh, I'd love to, but...

107
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,246
...I'd better get back to my office

108
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,753
and get the whole head-shrinking
operation up and running.

109
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,652
As you wish.

110
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:04,454
For crying out loud! Henry!
Steve, get off.

111
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:08,897
- You okay, Ash?
- You need a mint. Henry!

112
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,903
- I know, I know, I know, I know.
- It didn't work.

113
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:17,772
- Which is why we have dry runs.
- I could have died.

114
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,970
From him?
Come on. He's a puppy dog.

115
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,939
May I?

116
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,650
Full charge...

117
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,186
Minimum level...

118
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,964
There you go.
A calibration issue.

119
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,003
These long-range acoustic devices
get a bit wonky

120
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,196
when you jostle them, so...

121
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,102
Henry, I do a lot of jostling
when I work.

122
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,539
So choose a different weapon. I got
a new case of tech nines in the truck.

123
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,440
They've still got that new gun smell
and everything.

124
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,876
That was minimum?

125
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,948
I want my usual gear
ready for Friday, including the LRADs.

126
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,607
Calibrated to handle jostling.

127
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,379
Okay, well, the regular stuff
is no problem,

128
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,215
but the sonics, you're dreaming.

129
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,915
Besides, these are only good
if you're going after...

130
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,516
No, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

131
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,855
You're not thinking
of trying to kill

132
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,896
what I think you're
thinking of trying to kill.

133
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:12,895
Just make it happen, Henry.

134
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,693
Ash, that is
a completely unsanctioned...

135
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,391
Friday.

136
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,733
I'm going to tell your mother!

137
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,535
Suck up.

138
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,539
No!

139
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,941
No, no, I'm not avoiding
the question, sir.

140
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,512
I just...

141
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:06,313
You know, I think I need
to some time to, um, travel,

142
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,215
and meet some new people,

143
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,617
and, you know, see things
that I haven't...

144
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,019
...seen before.

145
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:19,359
Uh, yes, sir. Yes.
So if you could just process...

146
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,730
Thank you. Thank you. And...

147
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,305
So much for the letter
of recommendation.

148
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:31,775
- You're needed in the infirmary.
- Okay, new rule.

149
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,176
Don't do that.

150
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,326
Hi.

151
00:13:54,033 --> 00:14:00,029
It's nice to see you're finally awake.
I'm Dr. Zimmerman. Will.

152
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,774
Are you...? Are you hungry?
What's your name?

153
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,406
Can you understand
anything I'm saying?

154
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,015
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. You're okay.
You're in a safe place.

155
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:28,131
Okay, okay. Alright, you're okay.

156
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,931
You're in a safe place. Just relax.

157
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,415
I...

158
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,878
...am Danu.

159
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,714
So you can talk.

160
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:59,460
My sisters... Tatha and Caird...
are they?

161
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,898
They're fine. Your sisters are fine.
You just woke up first.

162
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,440
You're in a medical facility.

163
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,805
We brought you here
after we found you in a...

164
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,642
...dark place.

165
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,116
Do you have any idea
how you ended up there?

166
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,890
Creatures.
They came to our village.

167
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,299
They weren't human.

168
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,460
Yeah, sounds familiar.

169
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:43,504
They took us with them,
and then...

170
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,538
...I woke up here.

171
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,170
Your village.

172
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,215
Is there anyone there...
your friends or family...

173
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,716
that we could contact?

174
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,946
- Let them know you're alright?
- I'm sorry, I just...

175
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,046
I can't remember.

176
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,955
Well, it's okay.
You just take your time.

177
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,302
This place...
It's like...

178
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,579
...nothing I've ever seen before.

179
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:29,219
There's... There is light,
but I see no candles.

180
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:35,592
There's warmth,
but there's no fire, no sunlight.

181
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,822
Danu, before you and your sisters
were taken,

182
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,455
how much do you remember?

183
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,796
I'm not certain. I...

184
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:52,608
At last mass, we were mourning
the loss of our priest to the miasmas.

185
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,735
The miasmas?

186
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,748
It's a sickness that has cursed
many villages surrounding us

187
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,841
in recent months.

188
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:06,453
- There is no cure.
- So you remember the miasmas.

189
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,855
Anything else?

190
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,259
Why can't I remember?

191
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,627
Just give it time.

192
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,549
I understand you have
quite the weekend planned.

193
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,345
Thank you, Henry.

194
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,215
He called out of concern
for your well-being,

195
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,686
something you seem
determined to sacrifice.

196
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,984
You mean I'm going
to get myself killed.

197
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,288
God, why can't you talk
like a normal person?

198
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,918
Ashley, I realize there are things

199
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,496
that need to be discussed
between us...

200
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,030
Sure, Mom.

201
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:51,501
Let's bake treats and bond
and do each other's hair...

202
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,071
Right after I go kill a bunch
of ghouls for sport.

203
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,471
Those creatures are
on the contraband list for a reason.

204
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,304
There are specific rules
governing their capture.

205
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,571
Well, a lot of things changed
since good old dad showed up.

206
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,273
That changes nothing.

207
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,215
- I had no reason...
- When he had me prisoner...

208
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,857
Mom, I froze on that island.
Okay? I hesitated.

209
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,658
Do you realize how major
a problem that is?

210
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,630
For both of us.

211
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,030
And you think that by going off
on some insane hunt

212
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,263
you'll suddenly overcome
your fears?

213
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,668
- Ashley...
- Mom, if I can't do that...

214
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,638
...I'm not worth a damn
to anybody, am I?

215
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,107
Please don't do this.

216
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,444
HELEN: These creatures exhibit

217
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,643
a terrifying propensity
for violence.

218
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,276
Any future encounters with them

219
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,117
must be undertaken
with extreme caution.

220
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,326
Physiology appears human
in base form,

221
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,759
though significant anomalies
to the face and torso

222
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:55,163
indicate the possibility of mutation
at a base genetic level.

223
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,064
Ugh. Okay, you need to...

224
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:03,766
You need to put a sock on the door
or something before you do that.

225
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,040
He's breathtaking, isn't he?

226
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:13,414
- Yeah, that's one way of putting it.
- How are our guests doing?

227
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,512
Confused. At least the one
who's awake is.

228
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,615
She mentioned a disease that
was killing people in her village,

229
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,717
called the "miasmas,"

230
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,763
which translates from the Greek
meaning "poisoned air."

231
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:30,563
- Plague, actually.
- The bubonic plague, specifically.

232
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,001
However, the last reported
serious outbreak

233
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,938
was in Scotland in 800 A.D.

234
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,238
- Meaning?
- She's crazy.

235
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,505
Is that your professional opinion?

236
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,471
Look, I know there's a lot of things

237
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,914
that are outside the realm
of our knowledge, blah blah blah.

238
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,851
But logically,
if she were from 800 A.D.,

239
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,945
she wouldn't speak English
the way we do.

240
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,581
I'm guessing that linguistics
and grammar

241
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,592
have evolved somewhat
since then.

242
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,252
- Some would say "devolved."
- Whatever.

243
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,262
The point is that
we wouldn't understand her.

244
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,323
Which makes her a very sweet,
very delusional woman.

245
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,834
Possibly.

246
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,863
If you have a theory,
please share it with the class.

247
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,408
The liquid we found
the three of them in

248
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,943
bears similar chemical properties

249
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,378
to suspended animation formulae
used by southern voodoo cults.

250
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,617
The human body cannot survive
intact for 1,200 years.

251
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,212
I don't care what kind
of magic bath products you use.

252
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,689
And I agree.

253
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,319
So, these women are either
far more than they appear,

254
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,887
or, to use your incredibly
clever vernacular...

255
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,557
Crazy.

256
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,396
The question we should
be asking...

257
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,800
...is why the keepers
were so anxious to stop us

258
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,998
from getting into that crypt.

259
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,440
What is it about these women
that they don't want us to know?

260
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,196
- HELEN: Is it true?
- And how was your evening?

261
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,033
They cannot do this.
It's beyond unfair.

262
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,870
- It's already done.
- Ignorant bastards.

263
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,704
Language, Helen.

264
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,404
You brought the Royal College
out of the Dark Ages.

265
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,710
Sanitation reforms,
treatments for smallpox, cholera,

266
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,306
those were all your incentives.

267
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,908
You can't be surprised.

268
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,978
They've been trying to rescind
my membership for a decade now.

269
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,025
It only took this long
because they lack imagination.

270
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,097
What is it?

271
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,565
Like father, like daughter,
I suppose.

272
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,904
Helen, I'm so sorry.

273
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,810
I had the highest possible marks
in the entrance exam,

274
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,440
and yet they've rejected me again.

275
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,516
You already know more than
the doctors who wrote the exam.

276
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,589
I cannot legally
practice medicine anywhere

277
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,590
without a degree
from the London School.

278
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,126
There's not a hospital or clinic
in Europe that would hire me.

279
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,629
This is my third rejection.
I can't take the exam again.

280
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,997
- Because you're a Magnus.
- I do not accept this, Father!

281
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,594
I will not settle for a life
of mediocrity and subjugation!

282
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,605
I want more.

283
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,032
Teach me.

284
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:11,245
My private research is...

285
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,091
...unorthodox, Helen.

286
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,329
It is not to be entered into lightly.
Nor with anger.

287
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:28,868
You are the most talented medical
researcher I have ever known.

288
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,239
And yet you keep your most
important work hidden from the world,

289
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,834
from me.

290
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:39,145
If you truly believe
that I have potential, Father, please,

291
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,082
help me achieve it.

292
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:56,724
Once you enter this door, you are
on a path that cannot be reversed.

293
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,181
DANU: It's as though this is all
a dream, and when we wake up,

294
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,658
everything will be the same
as it was before.

295
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,525
Why is nothing familiar to us?

296
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,565
This building, these clothes...

297
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,135
...and these rooms
are all warm without fire.

298
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,704
The light is unchanging
with the day.

299
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,273
It's a lot to digest, Caird.

300
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:41,875
I see myself in the mirror,
and I recognize my face.

301
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,246
I know Tatha and Danu,
but the person I thought I was...

302
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:50,082
You're telling me there is no village.
No sickness.

303
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,156
The little I can remember is false.

304
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,954
How can we all not feel
completely lost?

305
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,496
Danu has told us that you insist
there were no magicks involved,

306
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,657
that what we suffer
is simply a malady.

307
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,358
It's more of an emotional shield.

308
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,733
We found you in a crypt
surrounded by monsters.

309
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,035
It's normal for the human psyche
to put itself in a safe mode.

310
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,837
We want to accept
your diagnosis, doctor,

311
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,935
and we are grateful
for all that you've done.

312
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,843
- It's just...
- You're still not buying it.

313
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,411
The clinical term
is schizoaffective disorder.

314
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,752
It's a delusional state stemming
from acute post-traumatic stress.

315
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,850
People have awoken from comas
thinking they were royalty,

316
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,293
that they were aliens
from another planet,

317
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,160
even people with super powers.

318
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,463
But we are all three suffering
from the same disorder.

319
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,331
How is that possible?

320
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,098
Delusional behavior
occurring virally in groups is rare,

321
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,903
but it's not undocumented,
particularly amongst siblings.

322
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,313
Look, let me put it this way.

323
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,650
If you really were 1,200 years old,

324
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,280
then there's no way
that I would understand

325
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,222
anything you're saying right now.

326
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,453
How do you explain that?

327
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:09,430
There is no logical or physical way
that your memories can be real.

328
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,468
And the sooner you accept that,

329
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,334
the sooner we can continue
to make progress.

330
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,507
Because the truth
will out eventually.

331
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,842
It always does.

332
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,078
Excellent timing.
I'm starved.

333
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,290
- They raise my hackles.
- In a good way?

334
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,661
You know there is no good way.

335
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,135
- Progress?
- Nothing concrete.

336
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,675
Base physiology
is essentially human.

337
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,543
DNA scans indicate significant
mutations to key chromosomes,

338
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,344
likely resulting in increased
adrenal production,

339
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,785
heightened strength and reflexes,
as well as this lovely appearance.

340
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,721
All in all, be glad you missed it.

341
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,554
I'm not.

342
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,855
You were recuperating.
We managed.

343
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,864
You were lucky.
And I'm fine now.

344
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,957
I'll be the judge of that.

345
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,002
Yes, doctor.

346
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,806
Now, what remains
to be determined

347
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,776
is whether our friend's genetic
mutation is accidental in nature

348
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,437
or by design.

349
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,105
You think someone made him?

350
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,913
I think there are a lot of unanswered
questions about these creatures,

351
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,390
including the significance of this.

352
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,858
From his right hand, index finger.

353
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,519
It is old.

354
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,331
- Very old.
- That's what I thought.

355
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,133
Which is why I'll be needing
a ride later tonight.

356
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,208
Where are we going?

357
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,038
To see if your hackles are right.

358
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,748
WILL: I want you to concentrate
on the sound of my voice.

359
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:15,054
I'm going to count backwards
from five, four, three, two, one.

360
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,019
Danu, can you hear me?

361
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,321
Yes.

362
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,465
I want you to go back
to the last thing you remember

363
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,902
before you woke up here.

364
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,309
The creatures.

365
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,302
They're too strong.

366
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,642
We can't escape.

367
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,547
Why are they doing this?

368
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,086
We've done nothing wrong!

369
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,914
They're making us drink something.

370
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,552
We can't move.

371
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,692
Darkness.

372
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,007
I want you to go back further.

373
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,370
Find a memory of something
that happened

374
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,206
before the creatures took you.

375
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,607
Moonlight.

376
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,944
It's cold.

377
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,016
I'm in a field.

378
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,360
I can sense the dead.

379
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,603
Their souls extinguished.

380
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,216
Only we remain.

381
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,691
They're not nightmares.

382
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,626
DANU: That field...
All the dead...

383
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,775
We were actually there that night.

384
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,009
It's more than that.

385
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,921
We were the reason.

386
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,919
Doctor, your message was very
intriguing. You never disappoint.

387
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,964
I see you've cleaned up
since I was here last.

388
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:19,128
I know, it's so austere
and uninviting. I deplore it.

389
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,203
But when one's life is centered
around a cruel irony,

390
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,469
one has to make
a few concessions.

391
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,134
This way.

392
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,508
- After you.
- Thank you.

393
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,124
Paintings and moisture
are mortal enemies.

394
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,251
Sadly, I need both to survive.

395
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,856
Now, let me take a look
at your precious little bauble

396
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,332
and we can get started.

397
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:59,265
Oh, this is interesting.
Wherever did you find it?

398
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,608
Scotland. On a mutated human
guarding an ancient crypt.

399
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:06,707
- Scotland, you say. Curiouser.
- Ring any bells?

400
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,251
Plenty of them.

401
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,379
It's just a question
of deciding which ones to listen to.

402
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,749
The design is at least
a thousand years old,

403
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,488
predating the Norman Conquest,
I'd wager.

404
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:23,158
I know I've definitely seen
something like it before. Yes.

405
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,666
Ah!

406
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:31,071
Ringing bells, ringing bells.

407
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,878
Ding dong.

408
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,709
And voila.

409
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,320
Fifth century tapestry reproduction.

410
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,284
Now, what are they
being offered here?

411
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,090
Blood of Christ?

412
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,426
Oh, please.
Nothing so cliché.

413
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,126
No, this design was the symbol
of the Cabalis Nocturnum,

414
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,328
a quaint little subsect
of Romano-British knights

415
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,597
from the early Middle Ages.

416
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,607
Charged with protecting the world
from dark influences, I believe.

417
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,735
These warriors likely drank
from the chalice

418
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,473
as a gesture of loyalty
and faith to their cause.

419
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,516
Now, who is the man
offering it to them? A priest?

420
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,550
Bigger.

421
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,711
Think the most powerful man
in Britain at the time.

422
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,289
Hint: not King Arthur.

423
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,355
Merlin.

424
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,885
These knights were probably
rejects from Arthur's court.

425
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,554
Desperate to prove
themselves worthy,

426
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,997
they accepted a hideous task,
fighting the dark forces unleashed

427
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:34,265
by Merlin's nemesis, Morgan le Fay.

428
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,830
Evil sorceress,
avowed enemy of Arthur.

429
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,173
All-around mean-spirited bitch.

430
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,737
And who are they?

431
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,817
Those would be the Morrigan.

432
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,511
Emissaries created by Morgan

433
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,645
to wreak havoc
against Arthur's armies.

434
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,224
The very embodiment
of her hellish powers.

435
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,294
Legend has it their very presence
on a battlefield

436
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,193
would steal the souls
of Arthur's soldiers.

437
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,700
They've popped up in literature
throughout the ages,

438
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,235
most notably as the trio
of hags in Macbeth.

439
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,805
You know, boil boil,
toil, and all that.

440
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,464
So the Morrigan were witches.

441
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:15,144
Oh, no, love.
They were the witches.

442
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,348
Easy, Steve. Easy.

443
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,733
Ladies...

444
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:44,004
I'm pretty sure we have rules
about... floating and stuff.

445
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,271
Whoa, whoa!

446
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,407
What say you just come down
and we talk about this?

447
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,852
Oh, crap.

448
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,351
That's quite enough of that.

449
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,428
I had everything under control.

450
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,569
WILL: Witches, huh?

451
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,971
Been a while since we had
to clean up from some of those.

452
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,806
Hey, you must be the new guy.
Henry Foss.

453
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:59,281
Weapons, tech support, phone guy,
you name it, I either build it or fix it.

454
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,477
- Hopefully not in that order.
- Will Zimmerman.

455
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,020
Yes, I've heard about you.

456
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,555
Well, not much, actually,
but I'm sure you're up for the task.

457
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,181
More than the last guy, anyway.

458
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,351
Look at this. You see that?

459
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:14,329
I'm telling you, women plus
technology equals mess.

460
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,031
Hey, don't take this the wrong way,
but are you...? You know?

461
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:26,268
I'm just kidding. I'm a normal boring
Homo sapiens, just like yourself.

462
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,972
My great great grandfather was
Magnus' original weaponsmith

463
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,048
back in London.

464
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,641
It's all about nepotism, dude.

465
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,379
- Henry, is my lab operational?
- Not yet.

466
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,787
Then I suggest you stop talking
and go and fix it.

467
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:45,726
FYI: around here, humans
are second class citizens.

468
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,058
Go.

469
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,390
Especially men.

470
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,768
Right. Your turn.

471
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,436
Based on the supernatural
forces at work here,

472
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,005
I'd say you're lucky to be alive.

473
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,301
Yeah, I got nailed by three witches.

474
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,139
It'll make a great story
at my next medical conference.

475
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,645
Is your bravado
meant to be charming?

476
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,476
Isn't it?

477
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,081
I find no permanent damage
as a result of your injuries.

478
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,247
As I said, lucky.

479
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,022
So what did they do?

480
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,186
From what I can gather,

481
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,788
our guests unleashed powerful
psychic energy on a massive scale.

482
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,461
Had it been left unchecked, the toll
would have been quite substantial.

483
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,038
Psychic energy,
as in they can read minds?

484
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,663
I'm guessing that's how
Danu was able

485
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,605
to quickly learn our vernacular
of English,

486
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,202
and instantly pass that knowledge
on to her siblings.

487
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,873
Okay, I saw them
floating in the air,

488
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,917
I watched them destroy the lab
with their minds, I guess.

489
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,385
But as for them being
the actual Morrigan, there's no way.

490
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:21,481
The markings on the ring.
The memories of ancient battles.

491
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,116
I'm entertaining the possibility.

492
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,492
Or they could just be three
scared, lost, delusional women,

493
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,030
albeit with some freaky powers.

494
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,465
Not famous witches
from 1,200 years ago.

495
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,272
But that's not what
you want to hear, is it?

496
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,106
I beg your pardon?

497
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,175
- We looked in that crypt for...
- Elixirs.

498
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:51,311
Right. Ones that could help you
with your condition.

499
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,049
And instead, we found
three people in coffins,

500
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,624
three people who are now claiming

501
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,784
to be even older than you
by a long shot.

502
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,890
I see.

503
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:03,455
So I'm imposing my personal
agenda on the situation,

504
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,626
hoping that these three women
can somehow help me help me

505
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,567
find a cure for my longevity.

506
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,366
It's understandable.

507
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,533
If they were in fact 1,200 years old,
they may hold the key to helping you...

508
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,373
You can't possibly understand.

509
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:23,677
Life without end is not a gift.
It's a curse.

510
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:31,391
It means loneliness. Isolation.
It means being less human.

511
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,363
Now, if you can somehow prove
that these three women

512
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,628
are nothing more than misunderstood
abnormals, believe me,

513
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,534
I will be the first
to applaud your efforts.

514
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,097
But if they are
indeed who I suspect,

515
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,372
then you, more than anyone,
are in mortal danger.

516
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:50,744
Because they hate men.

517
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,908
The Morrigan were created
for one purpose only.

518
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,646
That's why you and my manservant
were so affected.

519
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,720
Well, then we'd better
hope that I'm right.

520
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:11,965
Hey.

521
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,434
You scared the crap outta me.

522
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,435
Because of my unbearable
hotness?

523
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,444
God, you're a mess.
Here, let me help you.

524
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:31,015
- So how's the shopping list going?
- Having the time of my life.

525
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:34,852
- Did I miss anything?
- Yeah, witches.

526
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,187
Cool.

527
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,657
You might want your mom
to take a look at that.

528
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,265
Later.

529
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:51,071
Hey, listen, I know you're all
about keeping up your mojo

530
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,904
and not sharing things,
but I promise you

531
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,706
you're going to be in a lot less pain
both physically and emotionally

532
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,907
if you'd just talk
about what you're going through.

533
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,211
That's all I'm saying.

534
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,580
Okay?

535
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,291
You ever look at a ghoul,
a really nasty one,

536
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:13,557
right in the eye
before you send it packing?

537
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,598
You see one of two things.

538
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:22,997
You see fear. It knows it's dead meat,
and that's kinda sad.

539
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:27,601
But others...
the really bad ones...

540
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,474
they never stop wanting
to take you down,

541
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,517
right up until the moment
you pull the trigger.

542
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,985
And those kills,
they're the sweetest.

543
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:42,957
And sometimes, when I nail
something that mean and terrible,

544
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,588
when I watch it die, I feel...

545
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:59,736
Well, it's hard to explain.

546
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,401
But trust me.

547
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,113
It's a thousand times more cathartic
than lying on a couch,

548
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,844
crying about how your life sucks...

549
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,245
...doctor.

550
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:29,262
I can only say how sorry I am
that you were the ones who found us.

551
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,103
We should never
have been disturbed.

552
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,176
Why are you sorry?

553
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,206
You were kind to us.

554
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:39,282
Never passed judgment
on our actions.

555
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:42,614
You mean your memories
of killing all those men?

556
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,745
I hate to tell you this,
but memory is probably

557
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,323
the most untrustworthy thing
our minds have to offer.

558
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:48,618
You shouldn't do this.

559
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,387
Do you want me to believe
that you're evil witches

560
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,961
from the Middle Ages?

561
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,394
Danu, before your so-called
memories returned,

562
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:58,264
you and your sisters
were kind, reasonable people.

563
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,530
You said "please" and "thank you."

564
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,333
So forgive me
if I fail to believe that...

565
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:11,038
I remember who I am, who we are.
What we've done.

566
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,343
You just refuse to accept it.

567
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,249
Battles were lost and won
because of our presence.

568
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:22,015
We were the bringers of pestilence
that destroyed men's souls.

569
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,959
My power when I act alone
is but a tiny shard

570
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,826
compared to when
we three are as one.

571
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:34,867
A thousand men marched
on Badon Hill that morning.

572
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,408
All were dead before nightfall,

573
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:43,071
all without the touch
of neither sword nor spear.

574
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,413
And now that we are free,
more will die.

575
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,283
That is our purpose.

576
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,819
When shall we meet again?

577
00:44:55,926 --> 00:45:01,193
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
When the hurly-burly's done.

578
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,324
When the battle is lost and won.

579
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,470
I told you.

580
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:16,341
I remember who I am now.

581
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,819
So that's what the couch is for.

582
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,017
Okay, you win.

583
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:33,187
They're witches from the Middle Ages.
What do we do with them?

584
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,492
Keep them secure.
Study them.

585
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,626
Understand their power,
and help them if we can.

586
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,035
Look, I realize I don't have a lot
of experience dealing with witches,

587
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,575
but I'm not sure I have the time
or the talent to turn them

588
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,144
into productive
members of society.

589
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,839
Yes, well, our work
does have its limitations.

590
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:57,850
You know what bugs me is that
before I jogged their memories,

591
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,684
they seemed...

592
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,348
...normal.

593
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,426
Well-adjusted.

594
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,587
Not homicidal life-sucking
sorceresses

595
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:11,100
who killed a thousand men
at some place called Badon Hill.

596
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,225
Badon Hill?

597
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,534
Yeah, what about it?

598
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,598
Wexford mentioned it as the site
of the final battle

599
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,143
that handed Arthur
control of Britain.

600
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,168
So the thousand men...

601
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,975
Would have been Saxons,
not Britons.

602
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,346
Wait, wait, wait,
you told me the Morrigan

603
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,477
were created to destroy Arthur,
not help him defeat his enemies.

604
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,817
What if they had no choice?

605
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:42,357
HELEN: Of course. It makes sense.
She would never have done that.

606
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,592
WILL:
Who wouldn't have done what?

607
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,794
HELEN: What do we know
about Morgan le Fay?

608
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:47,935
Uh...

609
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,336
She was an evil sorceress
who was Arthur's enemy.

610
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,931
Now, ask yourself,
who would have written that?

611
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,645
- Men?
- Men. Exactly.

612
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,977
This is revisionist history.

613
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,107
What if the Morrigan
were not created to wreak havoc,

614
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,948
but rather to restore
balance to the world?

615
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,750
It follows what other revisionist
scholars have already uncovered

616
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:07,789
through ancient history.

617
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,485
Patriarchal monarchies that were
actually run by women, for example.

618
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,892
Whoa, whoa, whoa, before you get
all Da Vinci Code on me,

619
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,488
how do you know that Morgan le Fay
wasn't just simply evil?

620
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,897
I don't.

621
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,026
But I do know
that throughout history,

622
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,503
feminine energy never
seeks to try to dominate,

623
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:26,337
but rather tries to restore harmony
to the world, to make it whole.

624
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,707
Arthur wanted to control
all of Britain.

625
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:32,748
What if Morgan was simply trying
to stop his rush to power?

626
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,249
Here it is.

627
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,918
These are Arthur's battles
in his campaign to rule Britain.

628
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,014
Looks like he lost
more than half of them.

629
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,116
How does a guy become
king of England

630
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,162
with this kind of win/loss record?

631
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,306
Henry...

632
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,302
That's better.

633
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,811
Oh. Please!
I'm just an employee.

634
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,257
Prior to Badon Hill, Arthur's armies
suffered many defeats,

635
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,986
but with very few casualties.

636
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:20,063
Most of his men simply lost the will
to fight and abandoned their posts.

637
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:23,189
- But then something changed.
- At Badon Hill.

638
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,497
A massive defeat was visited
upon the Saxons by Arthur's forces.

639
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:31,666
Now, legend says that most died,
but without any marks on them.

640
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,766
The witches changed sides?

641
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:37,973
My guess is that Merlin somehow
brainwashed these women.

642
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,476
He recognized them
as Morgan's greatest weapon

643
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,143
and tried to find a way
to control them.

644
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,220
Okay.

645
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,189
So Morgan le Fay
creates witches to do good.

646
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:52,922
Then Merlin captures them and uses
them to hand Britain to Arthur?

647
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,622
And then locks them away,

648
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,097
keeping them alive
in case they're needed in the future.

649
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,326
And the ghouls...

650
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,426
They're an incorruptible army
created by Merlin

651
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,664
to ensure that the Morrigan
would never be free again.

652
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,873
Well, no offense to Merlin,
but he didn't do a very good job.

653
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:06,874
I mean, if we can...

654
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,611
Move!

655
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,678
I should have predicted this.

656
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,811
Merlin's army is reclaiming
their prize.

657
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,479
Yeah, would have been nice
to have seen that coming.

658
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,525
Many have tried.

659
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,122
None have lived.

660
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,567
Damn!

661
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:48,077
Why the monologuing,
if you're so bad?

662
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,475
VAMPIRE:
Didn't your mother warn you?

663
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,410
About me?

664
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,812
I'm way beyond bad!

665
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:15,601
Magnus!

666
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,636
Really?

667
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,334
When you keep monsters
in your house...

668
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,241
We need to lock down
the entire facility.

669
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,471
Yeah, good idea.

670
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,003
- HELEN: Oh, for God's sake.
- WILL: What now?

671
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,037
Henry?

672
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,341
HELEN: Henry, respond.

673
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,907
Uh, problems.

674
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,542
I know. We're being overrun.

675
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,018
I need the security protocols
for the entire facility

676
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,556
operational immediately.

677
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:10,490
HENRY: Witches... being... bad.

678
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,025
Now, I believe you were about
to let us go.

679
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,095
Go help Henry in the lab.

680
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,761
Make sure the Morrigan
do not escape.

681
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,134
Or anyone else, for that matter.

682
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,366
Wait. What about you?

683
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,409
I don't like uninvited guests
in my house.

684
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,536
- How is that an answer?
- Go.

685
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,425
- Where the hell have you been?
- We need weapons.

686
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:48,691
We need Ashley.

687
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:07,043
Seriously.
A lawyer vampire.

688
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,018
The cliché factor
doesn't offend you?

689
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,180
Not if you're the first.

690
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,696
Hadn't you noticed?

691
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,995
I'm not like all the other guys
you date.

692
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,798
These pants were new.

693
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,739
Send me the bill.

694
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,697
Good career move, Will.

695
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,356
Real good.

696
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,791
Crap!

697
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,265
This is so unfair.

698
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:09,304
The more you resist,
the more you will feel pain.

699
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,273
- Let us go.
- I don't work for you.

700
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,569
Then you'll die.

701
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,378
Danu! Don't do this.

702
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,507
We will not be prisoners again.
To you or anyone.

703
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,279
That's not what's going on here.

704
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:24,148
We can help you.

705
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,848
You can't possibly
promise us freedom.

706
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:30,153
- We are who we are.
- You are not evil!

707
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,319
WILL: At least, you weren't
in the beginning.

708
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,397
TATHA: We were created
to destroy men.

709
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:39,833
No, you were created to stop a war.
But Merlin changed you.

710
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,461
He made you forget
who you really are.

711
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:46,440
Believe me, if he could transform
a monk or knight into something

712
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:47,805
out of a late night horror movie,

713
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:50,778
he can make you think
you're something your not.

714
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,778
Since when do the bringers of death
have a conscience?

715
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:55,976
CAIRD: That was before.

716
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:00,279
No, no, before is
who you really are.

717
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,590
WILL: Look, please...

718
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,928
Believe me.

719
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,335
What the?

720
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,342
Henry, Henry!
You've got to unlock it!

721
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,105
Henry, unlock it, now!

722
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,723
Henry, status!

723
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,325
HENRY: Uh, the cells are secured,
but the upper levels and the lab

724
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:48,802
are still vulnerable.

725
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,566
And the new guy wants
to let the witches out.

726
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,163
I just wanted to talk to them.

727
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,835
Magnus, I was getting
through to them.

728
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,343
Oh, please,
they were playing you.

729
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,107
Are you even qualified
to talk about this?

730
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,239
Be quiet and listen.
We are about to be overrun.

731
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:03,342
Forget about the rest of the facility.
Protect the lab at all costs.

732
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,788
And find Ashley!

733
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:10,292
Oh, okay, how do I do that?

734
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,588
Magnus?

735
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,754
Alright, how do you usually
contact Ashley?

736
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:16,263
Is there some kind of Bat Signal
or something?

737
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,231
- Of course not. She usually just...
- ASHLEY: Will, Henry!

738
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,802
- Yes!
- ASHLEY: I'm in the building.

739
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:21,893
Okay, great, so you're aware

740
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:23,870
that we're up to our necks
in crypt people, right?

741
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:24,701
Working on it.

742
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,213
No!

743
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,252
Ashley?

744
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,753
Magnus?

745
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,323
Hello?

746
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:51,154
Okay, so it's just the two of us?

747
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,455
Yeah.

748
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,326
We're so screwed.
