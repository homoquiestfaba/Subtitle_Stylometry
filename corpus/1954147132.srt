8
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,379
Mrs Travers.

9
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,771
Like pink clouds on sticks.

10
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,111
Excuse me?

11
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:21,754
The cherry blossoms,
I was trying to think of what it looks like--

12
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:23,834
The car should be here, by now.

13
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,833
May I use.. the phone?

14
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:30,740
I cancelled it.
- You--?  What?

15
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,502
Pamela!
- Mrs Travers.

16
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:36,702
Mrs Travers...

17
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:39,460
Why would you cancel the car?
- I shan't be going.

18
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,172
We've been through this.

19
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:45,547
- I've changed my mind.
- You made an agreement.

20
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:48,340
Do you understand?
A verbal agreement.

21
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,573
Why in the world are you speaking to me
as if I am a neonate?

22
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:53,353
He's going to--
- What? What is he going to do? Sue?

23
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:56,015
He is very welcome to every penny
I don't posess.

24
00:02:56,215 --> 00:03:00,974
Look----I've represented you for a long time.

25
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:04,185
I like to think of you as a friend--

26
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:07,929
I like to think of it,
believe me I know it's not reciprocated.

27
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:10,248
I would never,

28
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:13,844
suggest you do something that would cause you
anguish but there's no more money Pamela

29
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,473
-- Mrs Travers. Simply no more.

30
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:21,555
Sales have dried up, no more royalties.
You refuse to write further books so-

31
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,064
Do you understand? I'm..

32
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm..frightened,
you don't understand what that means.

33
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:31,030
I know what he's going to do to her--

34
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,216
- she'll be cavorting and twinkling!
Careening towards a happy ending like a kamikaze--

35
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,133
--We've been trying to do this deal for twenty years!

36
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:39,659
He's agreed to both your stipulations.
No animation,

37
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,790
script approval--
- Use her to pay my bills? If I believed..

38
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,290
in a hell I'll be sitting in its waiting room--

39
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,910
--script approval! He's never granted
anything like that before! I don't know what else to do!

40
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,821
Where is Polly?
- I fired her.

41
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:04,803
It's just as well. It seems
I can't afford her anymore anyway.

42
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:11,858
You don't know how much she means to me.

43
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,058
Polly?

44
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,009
Of course not Polly!

45
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,767
For God's sake.
Los...Angeles.

46
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,475
You have only to go there and work for two weeks.

47
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:27,883
Collaborate.

48
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,154
You haven't signed the rights over, yet.
- Yet!

49
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:33,657
You must make it work Mrs Travers--
- Oh I must, must I?

50
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:38,589
You need the money. I don't want you to see you--
- Stop saying money! It's a filthy, disgusting word!

51
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:40,390
I am picking up the telephone Mrs Travers--

52
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:48,964
I..I have final say?
- You do.

53
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,614
I have final say.

54
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:54,151
And if I don't like what they are doing to her?

55
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:55,951
Then, You don't sign the papers.

56
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,160
He cannot make the film unless
you grant the rights.

57
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:03,727
It's an exploratory trip--

58
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:08,284
What do you say?

59
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:14,070
I want to keep my house.

60
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:26,795
mm..hhm?
Excuse me ma'am,

61
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:29,117
have you seen my daughter?

62
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:33,624
I was quite sure,
I had left her around here somewhere!

63
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:36,602
Her name is Helen,

64
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:37,802
no, erm.. Shirley,

65
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:44,990
No, erm.. good lord;
I've quite forgotten!

66
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:47,672
Could it be Prunella?
- No!

67
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,192
Pamela?
- No, no...no. No!

68
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:54,526
I'm sure I have a special name for her..
- Ginty!

69
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:57,050
Why, thank you ma'am!
Ginty it is of course!

70
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,784
Now, have you seen her?
- It's me!

71
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,021
Gosh! So it is!

72
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:10,388
Well, thank goodness for that!

73
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:14,044
I was positive, I was going to be beheaded for losing..

74
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:20,234
Her Highness.. The Royal Princess
Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!

75
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:21,434
You can't lose me!

76
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,573
Never. I promise.

77
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:27,298
I will never lose you!

78
00:06:27,498 --> 00:06:29,476
You ready?
Are you sure?

79
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:32,800
C'mon! The adventure is about to begin!
C'mon.

82
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:48,774
Can I help you?
- I'm perfectly capable thank you.

83
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:49,974
They've used all the space;

84
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:53,110
...so greedy.
- I'll take it Madam.  I can put it up in front.

85
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,310
I don't want it up there. I would it here,

86
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,975
in the corresponding holding area
for my assigned seat!

87
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:59,995
The flight's closing in just a few moments Madam.
I'll have to take it.

88
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:03,452
You can move mine instead.
It's the grey one.

89
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:04,652
- Thank you.

90
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:15,154
Will the child be a nuisance?
It's an eleven hour flight.

91
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:20,796
Er-- no,--
- Jolly good.

92
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:31,524
I hope we crash.

93
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:36,913
Where is he carriage?

94
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:38,777
A carriage? Who needs a carriage?

95
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,871
But, there's so many...
- Every leisurely stroll is a gift, Darling!

96
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,071
It's a gift!

97
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,673
Now, Biddy..

98
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:48,873
You're coming with us?
- Mmm, hm.

99
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:50,073
Excellent!

100
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,828

102
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,722
Hurry up, everyone!
We mustn't be late the train.

103
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:06,620
All aboard!
Everybody ready?

104
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
Yes.

105
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:11,369
See you soon Katie Nanna!
- Take care, love.

106
00:08:12,944 --> 00:08:14,484
Everybody ready?

107
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:19,212

Left. Left, right left...

111
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,109
And, one, two three-
New town,

112
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,294
new job, new bank.
New life.

113
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:47,958
Come on, my little ducklings!

114
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,540
Left, right left..
C'mon, come along!

115
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,190
Hold!

116
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:25,820
Allora--

117
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,595
Ginty, Come on, my love.

Fiery dust, I see.

120
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,405
Travers? P.L. Travers?
- Mrs.

121
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,360
Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers!
Welcome to the City of Angels.

122
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,450
Let me take those.

123
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,875
I'm perfectly capable of-- Oh, nevermind.

124
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:13,775
Sun came out to say hello just to you.

125
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:16,295
Don't be preposterous.

126
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,105
It smells. Like--

127
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:22,627
Jasmine.
--chlorine and sweat.

128
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:24,706
It's dreadful.

129
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:49,860
Absurt.

130
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,955
You okay back there Mrs P.L. Travers?

131
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:58,110
It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs--
Oh, it's too hot.

132
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,970
No problemo!

133
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:04,070
No problemo! We got a brand new
air conditioning system, Missus;

134
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,670
Just about make you feel like
you're in good old Engerland again!

135
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,973
Things they can put in cars these days--

136
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:14,173
Gosh almighty.

137
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:18,599
No problemo.

138
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,765
And, here we are. Ma'm.

139
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:41,539
Thank you.
- Ma'am?

140
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:44,502
Would you like me to unpack for you ma'am?

141
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,799
Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments;

142
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,814
May I suggest, you take employment in a launderette.

143
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:55,796
Odd.

144
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,840
Oh, Dear.

145
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
For Heaven's sake...

146
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:09,244
What on earth..

147
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:22,935
Oh no, no, no.
No, no, no.

148
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,135
This will never do.

149
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:25,478
Absolutely, no pears.

150
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,839
No pears.

151
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,030
A palace!

152
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,187
Complete with mighty steed.

153
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:48,097
And chickens.

154
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:49,297
Oh, my..

155
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,382
We'll build beautiful memories here my angel.

156
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,113
Girls, come on.

157
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:04,283
--in this house, you get to share room.

158
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,876
How old do you think i am?

159
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:46,745
A five years old...
I suppose.

160
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:22,548
And you can stay there
until you learn the art of subtlety.

161
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,639
There you are.

162
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:52,451
Don't worry!

163
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:55,006
There's nothing wrong with your television set.

164
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:56,300
This is a pixie bell,

165
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,573
the sound is much too high for human ears.

166
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,811
Oh, there you are Tink!

167
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:06,212
Hey! What..Hey!

168
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:09,214
Get that stuff off of me!

169
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:12,919
You know, if you're familiar with our story
of Peter Pan.

170
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,217
You know, a little sprinkling of fairy dust
can make you fly!

171
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:21,185
Where are you going, Tink?
Haven't you forgotten something?

172
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:22,385
Off!

173
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:25,535
That's how we deal with you.

174
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:44,060
Good morning Mrs!
- It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, nevermind.

175
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,542
We're just not going to get it right are we?

176
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,120
What's that?

177
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,874
Will it be the same..

178
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:55,372
driver every day?
- Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.

179
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,855
Hey, Sun came out again!

180
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,679
You say it like you're surprised.
As if the sun is particular about whom it appears.

181
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:07,479
It seems you think that I am responsible,
for it's miraculous dawning every day.

182
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,766
For heaven's sake, it's California!

183
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:10,966
It certainly is!

184
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,540
I would so much rather be accountable for the rain.

185
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,450
Oh, that's sad.

186
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,360
Sad is entirely the wrong emotion.

187
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,480
I shan't bother explaining why;
it'll just...Zip!

188
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,890
Okey dokey.

189
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,960
The rain brings life!

190
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,335
So does the sun.

191
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:42,614
Be quiet!
- Yes ma'am.

192
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,465
I'll get that, Sir!

193
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,700
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,950
Good morning! Pamela!

195
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,330
It is so discomfiting to hear a perfect stranger
use my first name.

196
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,005
Mrs Travers. Please.

197
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:22,205
I do apologize,

198
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:26,867
Mrs Travers.
I am Don DaGradi, the script writer.

199
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:30,676
Co-script-writer.
I shall certainly be having my say Mr. DiGraydi.

200
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,876
Gradi.

201
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,567
Wonderful! I welcome your input.
- If indeed we ever sign off on a script.

202
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:38,840
Right, uhmm..

203
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,381
this is the rest of your team,
This is Dick and Bob Sherman! Music and lyrics.

204
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:48,706
Boys, this is the one and only Mrs P.L. Travers,
creator of our beloved Mary.

205
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,061
Poppins.
<i>- Who else?</i> - Mary Poppins.

206
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:52,261
Never ever, just Mary.

207
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,141
A pleasure to meet you, though I  fear
we shan't be acquainted for too long.

208
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:58,341
Why is that?
- B'cos These books...

209
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:02,806
simply do not lend themselves
to chirping and prancing.

210
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,170
No. Certainly not a musical.

211
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,836
Now, where is Mister Disney?

212
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:10,696
I should so much like to get this started and finished
as briskly as is humanly possible.

213
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:13,524
Perhaps, one of you can point me in his direction.
That'd be superb..wonderful. Thank you.

214
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:14,724
We were hoping to give you
a little tour of the studio.

215
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,920
No thank you.

216
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,340
Walt just wants to show the place off.

217
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,140
No one likes a show off.

218
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:24,225
Mrs Travers-- it's quitea long way--

219
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,885
Not a musical?

220
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:33,995
I am perfectly capable of walking.

221
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,460
Good morning.
- Good morning, Dolly..

222
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,500
Could you let Mister Disney know
I have arrived please?

223
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,140
Absolutely, please have a seat.

224
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,880
Oh, no. There's no need.

225
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,690
He'll be just a.. a moment, Mrs.Travers.
Why don't we sit.

226
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,294
She's here!

227
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:10,592
A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I may.

228
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,240
You may. Whether I heed it or not
will be another matter entirely.

229
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,493
Uhm. It's just that he can't stand being called Mr Disney.

230
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,940
We are all on a first name basis here.

231
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,120
Well,

232
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
there ya are at last!

233
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,909
Oh, my dear gal!

234
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,850
You can't imagine how excited I am to finally meet you!

235
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,347
Hum-- well, It's an honour, Mister Disney.
- Oh Walt, you gotta call me Walt.

236
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:47,682
‘Mister Disney?was my old man.
Isn't that right, Don?

237
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:48,882
Absolutely, Walt.

238
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,380
Tommie, say hello to...
the one and only Pamela Travers!

239
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,230
It's so nice to meet you.

240
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,337
Ya know, I can't believe it. P.L. Travers,
right here, in my office,

241
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,991
after all these years-- almost twenty of ‘em.

242
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,520
Yes.
- Twenty. Long. Years.

243
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,830
Wish ya coulda?seen me then Pam!

244
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,610
As lean as a whippet I was! A race horse!

245
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,210
Well, anyway...

246
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,020
here you are. Look at you!

247
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,070
I could eat you up!

248
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,140
That wouldn't be appropriate.

249
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,289
You know what.
When Diane here was...

250
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,899
seven years old--
can I get you a drink? Coffee? Soda?

251
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,813
A pot of tea would be most welcome.

252
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,903
Anyway, She was seven years old
and I was walking past her room..

253
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:39,494
and there she was on her bed reading
to her sister Sharon,

254
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:42,253
and well, thsoe gals were giggling
their little socks off!

255
00:21:42,453 --> 00:21:42,820
Tommie,

256
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,540
A hot tea for Pamela and Me.

257
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,600
She's a doll.

258
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,370
Anyways,

259
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,848
I asked them girls, what's so funny??
260
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,560
And Diane said to me, why daddy,

261
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,320
Mary Poppins!?
262
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,980
Well, I didn't even know what a Mary Poppins was!

263
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,740
And then she gave me your book.
And oh, by gosh! My imagination was caught on fire!

264
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,530
Absolutely, ON FIRE!

265
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,200
And those embers have burned ever since-- as you know.
- I do.

266
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,412
Yes.
- Twenty years!

267
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:17,612
So you keep saying--

268
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,530
A man cannot...

269
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,420
break a promise he's made to his kids.
No matter how long it takes for him..

270
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,020
to make it come true..Now,

271
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,200
You might've kept me dangling all this time,

272
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,180
but now, I gotcha!

273
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,120
Gotcha indeed!

274
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,260
Mister Disney, if you have

275
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,070
dangled then it is at the end of a rope
you have fashioned for yourself.

276
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,730
I was perfectly clear, when you approached me
20 years ago..that she wasn't for sale

277
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,900
and I was clear again when you approached me the following year,
and clear again when you approached me every annum

278
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,660
for the subsequent 18 years.
Quite honestly, I feel corralled, --

279
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,251
Oh no, Pam, the last thing I wanna do is to make you feel--
- Would you mind, my name, is MRS Travers.

280
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:58,451
I promised them.

281
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:02,751
That's a fact. You got kids?
- No, not precisely...

282
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:06,720
I have never, I absolutely never, gone back on a promise
i made to either one of my daughters.

283
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,560
That's what being a daddy is all about right?

284
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,420
Is it?

285
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,797
Our motion picture isn't just going to make my kids happy.

286
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:15,997
It's going to make ALL kids happy!
Adults too...

287
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,220
B'cos, my guys are gonna do things with it that are,
well, are revolutionary.

288
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:26,164
Pam, REVOLUTIONARY! Your Mary Poppins is gonna literally
fly off the pages of your books!

289
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,364
Thank you, Tommie.

290
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,380
This magical woman who has only lived in your head,
you're gonna be able to meet her, speak to her, hear her sing.

291
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,070
Now, this singing, I am glad you've come to that.

292
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,970
oh, Milk in first, please.

293
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,410
Then, the tea.

294
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,640
And a spoonful of sugar.

295
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,480
You don't mean for this film to be a musical?

296
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,352
I absolutely do!

297
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:50,552
No.
- No?

298
00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:51,752
No.

299
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,498
Mister Disney, Mary Poppins..

300
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:58,363
does not sing.

301
00:23:58,563 --> 00:23:59,563
Yes she does!

302
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,880
When?
- In your books!

303
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,000
Those aren't songs!
They're recitations.

304
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,589
She is not a giddy woman,

305
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,089
she does not jig about!
Singing is frivolous and wholly unnecessary,

306
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,760
for a governess, an educatress. No.
It would just ruin it.

307
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,237
I won't have her turned into
one of your silly cartoons.

308
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,230
Now...Pam,

309
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,760
I want you to know--

310
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,400
that the last thing I would do,

311
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,080
the very last thing,

312
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,512
is tarnish a story, I have cherished.
Now, the pages--

313
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:46,936
pages of your book are worn down to tissue,

314
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:51,877
They  are dog eared and falling out.
B'cos,  I have poured over them gripped, tormented.

315
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:53,077
Because I love her, Pam.

316
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,390
I love Mary Poppins,

317
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,878
you... you got to share her,
with me.

318
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,000
Nothing happens without your say so.

319
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,971
Quite right.
- It's all here, in the rights agreement.

320
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:16,333
As approved by your agent,Dermot.
- Diarmuid.

321
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:17,533
Darmitt.

322
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:20,192
A live action film. No animation.

323
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:22,582
Live action.
Here's a pen.

324
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:27,571
I'll like that on tape.
<i>- On tape?</i>

325
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:31,289
Your promise-- and all the discussions we have here
-- on tape.

326
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,290
Ah huh, there you are.

327
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,080
Mary Poppins and the Banks's,
they're family to me.

328
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,900
I understand now.
I do.

329
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:47,596
Well then!

330
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,370
Shall we begin?

331
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,590
Let's make something wonderful.

332
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,926
Let's see if that's at all possible.

333
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:05,311
Woah.

334
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:07,350
Damn.

335
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,630
Testing, one, two.

336
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,060
What is all this...

337
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,173
jollification?
- We have a whole script to get through.

338
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:33,373
It's gonna be a long day Mrs T.

339
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,560
Mrs..
Mrs Travers.

340
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,365
We could save a starving country
with benefaction from this room alone!

341
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,140
Ugh, It's so vulgar.

342
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,320
Could you, turn on--

343
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,930
Now, Let us begin.

344
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,070
Scene one.
<i>- Scene one. Ext.</i>

345
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,287
Exterior Cherry Tree Lane.
<i>- Ext? What's Ext?</i>

346
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,830
Exterior. It means
the scene is taking place outside.

347
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,290
Ah, I see, an abbreviation.

348
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,020
Oh, I'm sorry Mr DaGradi,
did you feel you should--?

349
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,923
No, No, please be my guest,
Mrs Travers.

350
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:13,123
Yes, I do think it's best.
I've the most practise.

351
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,208
Readings of my books you know?

352
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:16,408
Absolutely.
- Anyway--

353
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,050
Scene one. Exterior.

354
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,920
17 Cherry Tree Lane, London. Day.

355
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,162
Yes. That's good, that can stay.

356
00:27:25,362 --> 00:27:29,689
- That's just the scene heading!
--Though I do think we should say number 17,
instead of just 17,It's proper. Yes?

357
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:30,889
- No one's going to see it.

358
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:32,089
I will see it.

359
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:35,476
Write it down, write it down,
chop chop.

360
00:27:35,676 --> 00:27:38,387
Is that on the tape?
We got that?

361
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:40,156
Ahh..Yes.
-Very good.

362
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,356
-- onwards.

363
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:43,272
I'm sorry to interrupt.

364
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,640
Is this a joke?

365
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,881
Excuse me?
- Do you think you are a comedienne?

366
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,919
I'm sorry I don't understand.

367
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,119
Unbelievable.

368
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:56,982
I think we are all set with..with..
thank you.

369
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,300
Scene One. Exterior. <b>Number</b>

370
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,050
17 Cherry Tree Lane. London. Day.

371
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,797
Bert, a one-man band- The rumour is that
this is to be your Mr.Van Dyke. Is that right?

372
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:09,997
We do hope so!
- Well, we'll see about that.

373
00:28:10,197 --> 00:28:11,197
It's a horrid idea.

374
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,750
Dick is one of the greats.

375
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,940
Dick Van Dyke?!
- Yes.

376
00:28:19,392 --> 00:28:20,544
Robert, my dear,

377
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,508
Olivier is one of the greats, Burton, Guinness

378
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:28,400
- greats without question. I can assure you..
I can assure you--

379
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,227
that Dick Van Dyke is not!

380
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:39,367
Bert, a one-man band plays to a small gathering
outside the gates to the park.

381
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:42,288
Bert says--
You can do Bert.

382
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,462
Thank you. Ahhmm?

383
00:28:44,662 --> 00:28:45,662
Guys..shall we...

384
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,610
give it a whirl?

385
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,880
What's happening?

386
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,012
What're you doing?

387
00:28:57,144 --> 00:29:01,381
Alright Ladies and gents, comical poem,
suitable for the occasion--

388
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:02,581
--extemporized and thought up
before your very eyes!

389
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,099
Alright, here we go--

390
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,910
Room here for everyone gather around,

391
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,990
The constable's "responstable."

392
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,660
Now, how does that sound?
- No no no no... no no no.

393
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,110
Responstable

394
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,800
is not a word.

395
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:25,063
We made it up!
- well..

396
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,067
un-make it up.

397
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,261
Irresponstable.

398
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,560
There's my girl.

399
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,460
Ahhh,

400
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,120
That's it, boy. Albert c'mon.
Give Ginty a kiss.

401
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,385
There you go.

402
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,370
Poor old Albert;

403
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,830
he's your secret uncle you know?

404
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,338
But a miserable,
horrid witch turned him into a nag.

405
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,030
Why did she do that?

406
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,500
Because she hated the sound of his laugh.

407
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:48,280
Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix him?

408
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,840
We have to teach the witch
how to be happy again.

409
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,680
How?

410
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,590
I'm not quite sure darling.

411
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,330
Do you want to know
what it feels like to fly Ginty?

412
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,770
Albert. You old nag.
Come here.

413
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,770
You trust me?
- Yes.

414
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,940
Yah!

415
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,058
Nobody walks.

416
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,270
Leisurely stroll's a gift.

417
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,540
Beautiful ain't it?

418
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,410
If you like that sort of thing.

419
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,560
I do.

420
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,610
We do find it helps to have a visual.

421
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,276
Plus, It's fun!

422
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,900
No, no, no. Goodness me, no.

423
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,100
- No?

424
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,710
The Banks house doesn't look like that!
No No.

425
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,890
My house is a terraced house

426
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,800
with a pink door, white bricked

427
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,733
with a crack in the gable.
- Okay,  we get it. The house is not what you pictured.

428
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,480
The window frames are lead-lined

429
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,858
and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums
to go with the pink door.

430
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:16,058
We got that?

431
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:19,074
Oh dear, it's all a big mistake.
It's all wrong.

432
00:33:19,554 --> 00:33:21,452
It's all wrong?
- It's too grand!

433
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:25,061
The Banks's are -
normal, everyday sort of people.

434
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:26,261
This isn't normal. It isn't everyday!

435
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,952
They're not aristocrats!

436
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,160
Oh, Do I even have to say it?

437
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,590
Um-- i'm afraid so.

438
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,126
Why in the world have you made
Mrs Banks a silly suffragette?

439
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:01,326
- I wonder if Emmeline P
would agree with that adjective--

440
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,416
Quite possibly, looking back.
- It does seem

441
00:34:05,616 --> 00:34:10,738
strange that Mrs Banks allows
her children to spend all of their time

442
00:34:10,938 --> 00:34:12,040
with the nanny when she has no job to speak of--

443
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,377
Are you calling Mrs Banks neglectful?
- Yep.

444
00:34:15,577 --> 00:34:17,799
No! Of course not!
We just felt that if she had a job

445
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,299
it would go some way to explaining--
- Being a mother is a job.

446
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,640
A very difficult job and one that not everybody is up to,
that not everybody should have taken on in the first place!

447
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,250
I will NOT have her called Cynthia!
Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.

448
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,705
At least something warm,

449
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,509
something a bit..
sexy.

450
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,010
How about Mavis?

451
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,590
Sybil?
- Great.

452
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,234
Prudence?
- Gwendolyn?

453
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:44,434
Winifred!

454
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:46,950
I could go with Winifred.

455
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,060
Yes, that's because it's very good.

456
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,170
This isn't Mr Banks? This isn't him.
- Yes, that's him Mr.Banks.

457
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,840
He has a set of moustaches!

458
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,763
In the books he--
- I told the illustrator I didn't like the facial hair

459
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:02,980
but she chose to ignore me.
Now, this time around..

460
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,900
This is MY film and I shall have MY way.

461
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,287
Mrs Travers, it was a specific request, from Walt.

462
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:10,487
Why?

463
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,960
I think he identify..
- He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is clean shaven!

464
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
Does it matter?

465
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,980
Does it

466
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,350
mattterrrrrrr?

467
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,110
You can wait outside!

468
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:35,708
I shan't say it again Robert.

469
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,058
What is wrong with his leg?

470
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,925
He got shot.

471
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,125
Hardly surprising.

472
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,715
Can I expect anymore drama from anyone else?

473
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,500
Why do you do that?

474
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,540
For you my dear!

475
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:38,508
Tell me, Gintamina.

476
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,600
Which kind of kisses do you prefer..

477
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:45,981
Scratchy ones or silky ones?

478
00:36:46,181 --> 00:36:47,181
- Silky ones.

479
00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:55,228
Well then, Swish!
Swoosh!

480
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,634
A man must shave
for to spare his daughter's cheeks!

481
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:09,561
Swish!

482
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:13,173
Swish!

483
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,186
SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS.
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

484
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,368
What on earth are you talking about?
Supercali--? Supercali--

485
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,800
or whatever the infernal thing is!
- It's something to say when,

486
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,035
when you don't know what to say!
- Well I always know what to say.

487
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:35,370
If you so much as step one foot in here

488
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,440
with that tray I shall scream!

489
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,070
One cannot live on cake alone!

490
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,940
Hit me with it.

491
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,198
She has a lot of-- ideas.

492
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:50,040
Ya? What kind of ideas?

493
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,250
The name Cynthia has been changed to Winifred.

494
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,170
Fine, fine.

495
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,756
She won't approve Dick Van Dyke.

496
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,530
The sketches of the Banks house
make it look too opulent,

497
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,610
there must be no hint of romance
between Mary Poppins and Bert,

498
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,440
she wants to know why Mr Banks
has been given a moustache, <i>--I asked for that.</i>

499
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,340
Yes. They did tell her that
but she wants to know why.

500
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,330
Because, I asked for it.

501
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:25,158
Right. Of course.

502
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,490
Uh-- the tape measure Mary Poppins uses to record
Jane and Micheal's height must be a roll tape,

503
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,160
not a ruler,

504
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,860
She only wants green vegetables and broth,

505
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,230
I don't know what that is

506
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,915
but she wants it in the room from now on

507
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,688
and oh! She doesn't want the colour red in the film--

508
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:46,186
at all.

509
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,050
I've simply gone off the colour.

510
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,270
We can't make the film without the colour red!

511
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,800
The film is set in London for pete's sake.

512
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,363
- And?

513
00:38:56,563 --> 00:38:59,470
There's buses and mail boxes

514
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,680
and guards uniforms-- heck!
The British flag!

515
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,700
I understand your predicament Mr Disney, I do.

516
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,745
I just-- hm-- I don't know what it is,

517
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,910
I'm just suddenly very anti-red.

518
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,360
I shan't be wearing it ever again.

519
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,875
Is this a test Pamela?

520
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,790
Are you requiring proof

521
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,820
of how badly I wanna make you happy
so that we can create this beautiful thing together?

522
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,656
I took you at your word Mr Disney?

523
00:39:28,856 --> 00:39:32,422
and it seems my first stipulation has been denied.

524
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:33,720
There will be many more,

525
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,384
so-- perhaps we should just call it quits;

526
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,280
and I should hand you back these.

527
00:39:55,148 --> 00:39:56,523
Alright.

528
00:39:56,723 --> 00:39:59,414
No red in the picture.

529
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:00,600
What?! Walt?

530
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,400
He doesn't have the rights--

531
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,923
Quite.

532
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,720
Tommie!

533
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,190
Scotch Mist.

534
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,520
What do you think?

535
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,460
What do I think I-- what?
- You're a woman.

536
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,800
That's a canny observation Walt.

537
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,910
What am I missing here?

538
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,040
You think the female of the
species has some sort

539
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,970
of psychic insight
when it comes to others of her kind?

540
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,650
We don't.

541
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,382
You'll get yourself an ulcer with all that unriddling.

542
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:53,582
Give it up.

543
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,702
That woman.

544
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,920
Good afternoon Ma'am.
What can I fix you?

545
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,080
A pot of tea.
If you please.

546
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,870
Sure thing.

547
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,660
Thank you. Tea is a balm for the soul
don't you agree?

548
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,650
Girls, will you please just..

549
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,350
In you go.

550
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,020
Alright?

551
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:40,130
Ahoy Goffs!
- Father!

552
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,350
Ahh, that's better.

553
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,770
What a wonderful surprise!

554
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,020
Did you finish early?

555
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,490
couldn't stop thinking about
my beautiful girls on this--

556
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,720
beautiful day in this beautiful place..

557
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,120
.. and I thought to hell with it!

558
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,990
Don't you have work to do?
- But--

559
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,580
Buts are for goats my love!

560
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:11,552
I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.

561
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,080
A gift of a pear, for my lady.

562
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,051
Now...What are we playing?

563
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:26,160
-The hen got out and we've been trying
to catch her!

564
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:34,452
That's no hen!

565
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,440
That's Aunt Ellie,

566
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,543
your mother's horrendiferous sister!

567
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,190
That's a made up word!
- Yes, it is.

568
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,790
Hury! Catch her before she flies away on the--
- West Wind!

569
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:49,990
West Wind!

570
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,778
--darling, it's just that um--
a little scared--

571
00:44:20,978 --> 00:44:25,148
--Meg sweet,
I had a throat scratch

572
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:27,970
But, the bank is getting you down again?

573
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,790
Perhaps my sister--
- no!

574
00:44:33,621 --> 00:44:34,807
God no!

575
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,200
No. I can endure.

576
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:43,291
I will endure. For the girl's sake--

577
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:48,373
Just, please--
not Ellie.

578
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:07,498
She's a Foul fowl.

579
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,237
It's gotta be like a slogan!
- Her prescription for life.

580
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:16,953
An apple a day.
- A stitch in time!

581
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,084
Time and tide wait for no man.

582
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,660
Sugar!

583
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,976
Sugar?
- Yeah.

584
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:30,455
Jeff had vaccination day at school yesterday.

585
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:32,650
No ouch.
- No ouch?

586
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,620
Sugar. They put it in a cube.
- Medicine in sugar?

587
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,820
Cube's an odd word.

588
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,530
Spoonful?

589
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,820
You need sugar with sugar.

590
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,650
Well, Morning!
May I walk with you?

591
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:53,533
I'm sure your country doesn't have any laws
against it..

592
00:45:58,503 --> 00:45:59,680
Nope. Go back to the chorus.

593
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:08,304
<i>Chorus..Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down!</i>

594
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:09,190
<i>medicine..</i>

595
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,350
It's missing...?

596
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,390
WAIT! She always does what's unexpected.

597
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,920
She goes UP the bannisters.

598
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,190
So, go up.

599
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,476
<i>Just.. a... spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down.</i>

600
00:46:29,676 --> 00:46:30,676
That's it. That's it!

601
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,260
Man is in the forest.
I want you to play that..

602
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,640
for him. Walt?

603
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:42,086
It's just a chorus--
Tell us what you think.

604
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:47,270
He knows dum dum
Will help dum dum dum duuuum!

605
00:46:48,615 --> 00:46:54,565
<i>For a..a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down--</i>

606
00:46:54,765 --> 00:46:58,861
<i>the medicine go do-own,
medicine go down;</i>

607
00:46:59,061 --> 00:47:03,544
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down.</i>

608
00:47:03,744 --> 00:47:06,879
<i>In a most de da dee daaa!</i>

609
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,054
We'll work out the other lyrics.
- You see how it goes up on the word down?

610
00:47:12,784 --> 00:47:15,783
It's ironic.
- Forget ironic, it's iconic.

611
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:18,120
I won't be able to stop singing that for weeks!

612
00:47:19,492 --> 00:47:22,427
Well, It seems enormously patronising to me.

613
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,307
The very sort of annoying tune
you would have playing in your themed park I daresay.

614
00:47:26,507 --> 00:47:30,023
All giddy and carefree, encouraging
children to face the world unarmed.

615
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:35,584
All they need is a spoon and some sugar and a
brain full of fluff and they're equipped with life'stools.

616
00:47:35,784 --> 00:47:36,784
Wonderful!

617
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,390
What's your point Pam?

618
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,665
- MRS Travers! Please.

619
00:47:41,865 --> 00:47:47,045
My point is that, unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is
the very enemy of whimsy and sentiment.

620
00:47:47,245 --> 00:47:48,245
She is truthful,

621
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,923
She doesn't sugar coat the darkness in the world
that these children will eventually come to know.

622
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:56,466
She prepares them for it,
she deals in honesty!

623
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,952
One must clean one's room;
it won't magically do it itself!

624
00:48:00,152 --> 00:48:02,704
This entire script is flim flam!

625
00:48:02,904 --> 00:48:03,904
Where is its heart?

626
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,820
Where is its reality? Where...

627
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,606
.. is the gravitas?

628
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:21,850
No weight Mister Disney!

629
00:48:25,326 --> 00:48:26,843
See?

630
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,080
No whimsy or sentiment says the woman..

631
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,727
who sends a flying nanny with a
talking umbrella to save the children.

632
00:48:34,927 --> 00:48:38,732
You think Mary Poppins is saving
the children Mr Disney?

633
00:48:43,361 --> 00:48:45,395
Oh dear.

634
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,760
Mr Belhatchett!
- Good afternoon.

635
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:02,738
Allow me--

636
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,680
I want you gone.

637
00:49:37,802 --> 00:49:39,129
Ginty!

638
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:44,566
Sweet thing! What are you doing here?

639
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:48,625
You said today was ice cream day.

640
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:52,230
Ice cream day! Yes! I did!

641
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,577
What kind of father am I?
Come here.

642
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:03,811
Are you fired again?

643
00:50:05,884 --> 00:50:09,288
Ah, yes it does seem that--
- No sweetheart--

644
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:12,887
No. He isn't.

645
00:50:16,963 --> 00:50:18,891
Darling, wait inside for a second.

646
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,230
If you can't straighten up for your own sake.

647
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,320
Do it for your daughter.

648
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,603
Irresponsible.

649
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,060
We share a Celtic soul, you and I.

650
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,520
This world..

651
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,155
is just an illusion, Ginty old girl.

652
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,193
As long as we hold that thought dear,
they can't break us.

653
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,100
They can't make us endure
their reality.

654
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,630
They can bloody as it is.

655
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:20,840
Money, money, money.

656
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,110
Don't you buy into it Ginty!

657
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,100
It'll bite you on the bot!

658
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,300
I loathe this place, Mr Russell.

659
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,488
It's bringing up these-- it's..

660
00:51:51,688 --> 00:51:52,688
it's so hot and stuffy I--

661
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,280
..feel as I am being attacked.

662
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,970
These odd dreams,

663
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,670
like my subconscious is after me.
Punishing me..

664
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,050
for entertaining the idea that I might..

665
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,450
... hand her over.

666
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,600
I am at war with myself Mr Russell.

667
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,440
The script is ghastly,

668
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,402
empty pack, exactly as I expected--

669
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:27,225
Yes, a few more days and then I'll decide--

670
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:58,753
Serves me right. Money, money, money.

671
00:52:58,953 --> 00:53:01,367
Bit me on the bot.

672
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,119
<i>All around the cathedral</i>

673
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,280
<i>the saints and apostles</i>

674
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:06,064
<i>look down as she sells her wares.</i>

675
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:09,810
<i>Although you can't see it </i>

676
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,769
<i>you know they are smiling </i>

677
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:18,754
<i>Each time someone shows that he cares--</i>

678
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:25,810
<i>Though her words are simple</i>

679
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:28,380
<i> and few listen,</i>

680
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:33,400
<i> listen, she's calling to you--</i>

681
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:41,460
<i>Feed the birds, tuppence a bag</i>

682
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,490
<i> tuppence,</i>

683
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,140
<i> tuppence,</i>

684
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,350
<i> tuppence a....</i>

685
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:57,574
<i> ...bag.?/i>

686
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:00,010
That'll work.

687
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:07,052
She's going to say no isn't she?

688
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,731
The woman is a conundrum.

689
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:28,060
<i>My world was calm,</i>

690
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,220
<i>well ordered,</i>

691
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,210
<i> exemplary</i>

692
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,350
<i>Then came this person,</i>

693
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:39,820
<i>with chaos in her wake. </i>

694
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:46,220
<i>And, now my life's ambitions go</i>

695
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,190
<i> with one</i>

696
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,330
<i> fell blow</i>

697
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:56,840
<i>It's quite a bitter pill to</i>

698
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,070
<i> take.</i>

699
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,230
Inspired by someone we know?

700
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,850
You'll have to ask Bob.

701
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:06,720
She might surprise us all.

702
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,380
No! No..she won't.

703
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:12,530
You don't know that.
- No, I do. I do know it,

704
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,540
I know it only too well.

705
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,500
I've fought this battle from her side.

706
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,680
Pat Powers,

707
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,320
he wanted the mouse

708
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:27,834
and I didn't have a bean in my pocker, back then.
He was this big, terrifying...

709
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:33,027
New York producer and I was just a kid
from Missouri, with a sketch of Mickey.

710
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,049
It woulda?killed me, to give him up.

711
00:56:36,249 --> 00:56:38,800
Honest to god, that would've killed me.

712
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,394
That mouse, he is family.

713
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:51,980
Go home.

714
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:13,054
<i>The world..</i>

715
00:57:13,254 --> 00:57:16,490
<i> is an illusion Ginty, old gal.</i>

716
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,897
Ahh, the Countess- Mary Sparklestick!

717
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:36,355
Pray tell me,
what are you concentrating so hard on?

718
00:57:36,555 --> 00:57:37,555
I am laying eggs!

719
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:40,701
Really!? Fabulous!

720
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:41,940
Today, I am a hen.

721
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,297
Indeed! I can see the feathers
sprouting as we speak!

722
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,220
Helen Goff, would you lay the table for supper please?
- I'm not Helen!

723
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,491
She can't possibly lay a table;
she's busy laying eggs!

724
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,164
Helen, would you lay the table for supper please?
- She's laying!

725
00:58:05,283 --> 00:58:07,171
I'm sorry!

726
00:58:09,222 --> 00:58:10,954
I should--
- Ginty?

727
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:16,161
Don't you ever stop dreaming Ginty my love.

728
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,593
You can be anyone you want to be.

729
00:58:19,793 --> 00:58:23,239
Anyone.
- I want to be just like you.

730
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:28,566
Don't.

731
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:29,766
Don't.

732
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,730
Ya alright Mrs?

733
00:59:33,776 --> 00:59:35,193
<font color=#50BEFA>DON:</font>Mrs Travers?

734
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,420
Mrs Travers?

735
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,190
We were just saying that we'll like to play you
the song in the bank.

736
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:45,024
Would that be good?

737
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,280
Fidelity Feduciary Bank.

738
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:57,314
So you have tuppence?
May I be permitted to see it?

739
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,950
<i>No, I want it to feed the birds! </i>
Michael says,

740
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,530
Fiddlesticks boy!
Feed the birds and what've you got?

741
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,100
Fat birds!

742
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:09,220
<i>But! If you invest your tuppence</i>

743
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:13,270
<i> wisely in the bank</i>

744
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,467
<i>Safe and sound--</i>

745
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:20,465
<i>Soon, that tuppence safely invested in the bank--</i>

746
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,998
Mrs Brill said Father's presenting the medals.

747
01:00:41,198 --> 01:00:44,301
He is indeed!
On behalf of the bank.

748
01:00:44,501 --> 01:00:45,900
Maybe, he will pin one on me,
for the maple.

749
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,110
He might.
- Where is Father?

750
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,350
I think, he is practising his speech somewhere.

751
01:01:09,675 --> 01:01:14,060
<i>In the hands of the directors</i>

752
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:18,478
<i> who invest as propriety demands.</i>

753
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,735
Father--

754
01:02:38,495 --> 01:02:39,790
Why is he speaking for the bank?

755
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,620
He's the manager..Sir.

756
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,771
He looks terrible.

757
01:02:43,971 --> 01:02:46,715
Good afternoon, distinguished guests,

758
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,527
our biggest supporter, Mr Randolph Belhatchett

759
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,810
and his lovely wife,

760
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,520
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls!

761
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,790
I'm honoured to be here on behalf of

762
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,163
the Belhatchett Bank of
Australia.

763
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,300
Shortly, it will uh..

764
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,620
It'll be my very pleasant duty to present the awards
to our uhhm..

765
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:09,570
our young performers.

766
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:11,810
But before,

767
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,420
I begin,

768
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,430
I'll like to say a very few words

769
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,930
to our very youngest citizens about the er,
about the.. er

770
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:21,610
the role...

771
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,200
of the Bank in our community.

772
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,080
<i>When you deposit tuppence</i>

773
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,720
<i> in a bank account,</i>

774
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:32,020
<i>Soon..</i>
- Soon you'll see,

775
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,479
<i> that it blooms into credit of..</i>

776
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,979
a generous amount

777
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,588
<i> Semi-annually!</i>

778
01:03:41,788 --> 01:03:45,935
<i>And you'll achieve that sense of stature</i>

779
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,289
<i>As your influence expands.
To the high</i>

780
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:54,835
financial strata

781
01:03:56,205 --> 01:03:58,704
<i> That established credit now commands--</i>

782
01:03:58,705 --> 01:04:02,940
You can purchase, first and second trust deeds

783
01:04:03,165 --> 01:04:07,140
Think of the foreclosures!
Bonds! Chattels! Dividends!

784
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:10,309
Shares!
- Bankruptcies!  - Debtor sales!

785
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:13,920
Opportunities!
All manner of private enterprise!

786
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,834
Shipyards! The Mercantile!
Collieries!

787
01:04:16,835 --> 01:04:21,997
Tanneries!
Incorporations! Amalgamations!  Banks!

788
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,804
Uhmm. Thank you kindly.
Thank you.

789
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,200
It's a marvellous thing..

790
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,190
to encourage children to open accounts.

791
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,590
marvellous!

792
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,750
My daughter, the Princess Ginty--

793
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:57,099
she's-- uh.

794
01:04:57,299 --> 01:04:59,961
How old are you?

795
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,740
Come up here.

796
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:09,430
Come here, Ginty.

797
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,617
Ginty has an account--

798
01:05:22,817 --> 01:05:24,090
and that's good.

799
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,670
Give her a drink!

800
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,430
I mean.. give her a hand.

801
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:43,720
I shall return in just a few moments,
to present the awards.

802
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,660
But right now,

803
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:51,238
I need to relieve myself.

804
01:05:51,438 --> 01:05:52,438
Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will you?

805
01:05:52,638 --> 01:05:56,197
I'm busting.
There's a good girl.

806
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,020
It works.
- It's getting great.

807
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:30,226
Why did you have to make him so cruel?
He was not a monster!

808
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,160
Who are we talking about? I'm confused.

809
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,607
You all have children, yes?
- Yes.

810
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:39,850
And do those children make letters for you,
do they write letters, make drawings...

811
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,930
And would you tear up those gifts?

812
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,420
In front of them?!

813
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:49,012
It's a dreadful thing to do! I don't understand!
Why must father, tear up

814
01:06:49,212 --> 01:06:51,336
the advertisement, his children have made;

815
01:06:51,536 --> 01:06:54,804
and throw it in the fireplace!?
Why won't he mend their kite?

816
01:06:55,004 --> 01:06:57,905
Why have you made him so unspeakably, awful?

817
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,850
In glorious technicolor?

818
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:02,390
For all the world to see.

819
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:05,650
You claim to make them live--
why can't he?

820
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:08,510
They.. live well?

821
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,950
I can't bear it.
Please don't--

822
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,670
Please don't.

823
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:17,580
I'll feel like I let him down again.

824
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,650
Mrs Travers?

825
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,660
I don't suppose,
you can give me any more

826
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,802
for the pain?

827
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,340
When will enough be enough, Travers?

828
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:49,922
I've brought you something father.

829
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:54,767
Be a darling Ginty, my old pal!

830
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:55,967
Come here.

831
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:03,359
I'm sick.

832
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:06,190
Help father out won't you?

833
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,049
You know, In my washroom--

834
01:08:12,249 --> 01:08:14,842
there's a bottle of medicine
that father needs.

835
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:18,010
- Mother took it away.
- Godammit!

836
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,861
I wrote a poem father.

837
01:08:26,598 --> 01:08:29,518
It - it won first prize, at school.

838
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:34,313
Shall i read it to you, father?

839
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:20,516
Mrs?

840
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:28,666
I, uh, brought you a tea.
- It's blasphemy to drink tea from a paper cup.

841
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:37,020
Everything okay, mrs?

842
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,650
Would you like me to drive you home?

843
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,180
All the way to England?
Yes, please.

844
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:51,124
You got family, back there Mrs?
- You're an impertinent man, you know?

845
01:10:51,324 --> 01:10:52,324
You ask an awful lot of questions that have

846
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:56,230
absolutely, no relevance to you
being able to carry out your duties.

847
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:02,492
I know! I do, do that. Yes!
- And you have no barometer.

848
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:06,520
Let us say, that I haven't

849
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:13,544
family who'll notice, whether I was halfway
across the world or sitting, in my living room.

850
01:11:16,056 --> 01:11:18,263
Make a little furrow, there.

851
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,720
I gotta kid.

852
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,920
Well, most people do.

853
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,010
Jane--

854
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,840
What a terrific kid.

855
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:45,149
Beautiful, little girl.

856
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:47,720
She's got a of problems though.

857
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,446
She's Handicapped, you know?

858
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:55,806
She's in a wheelchair.

859
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:00,437
See? That's why I concern myself
with the weather so much.

860
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:05,030
Sunny day, she can sit out in the garden.

861
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,214
Rainy day, I have to leave her cooped up inside.

862
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,440
Worry about the future,

863
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,750
but, you can't do that.

864
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:20,830
Only today.

865
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,290
Hmmm.
- Yeah.

866
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,640
Now look.

867
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,340
It's a band stand.
- Ahh!

868
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,400
A river!
- Lake.

869
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,450
Hey, Hey..Hey!
I sure would like to take her there!

870
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:46,572
Wouldn't that be nice?

871
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,299
I know you gave it to him.

872
01:13:11,106 --> 01:13:12,963
Take care of your sisters.

873
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,180
I know you love your father more.

874
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:21,740
But, one day..

875
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,410
you will understand.

876
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:39,860
Mother!

877
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:53,700
Mother?

878
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:57,180
Mother!

879
01:13:58,816 --> 01:14:00,401
Mother!

880
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,390
Mother!

881
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:57,540
Mother?

882
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,470
It's time to go home.

883
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,880
I'm sorry.

884
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,950
Oh, my God!

885
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:39,000
I'm sorry.

886
01:15:58,730 --> 01:15:59,790
Mrs Travers! Yes?

887
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:04,520
Pam! Walt.

888
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,790
Mr Disney.

889
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,290
I'm Callin?to..uh check up on you.

890
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:13,438
I understand, things didn't go so well today.

891
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:15,000
Something about Mr. Banks?

892
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:17,020
They went as well as
they've gone every other day;

893
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:22,346
that I've been here. I don't recall special phone calls from you on any of those other evenings.

894
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:24,410
Pam, What's this all about?

895
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:26,310
Really?

896
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:29,770
I'm wondering what I have to do
to make you happy.

897
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:34,627
- Ha!
- And, you've been wondering that too, Aren't you?

898
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,200
You know,

899
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:39,120
you've never been to Disneyland!

900
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:41,000
That's the happiest place on Earth!

901
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,320
Tommie!

902
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,160
Cancel my morning tomorrow.
I'm taking a ride with my favorite author!

903
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,698
No, no no, please, Mr. Disney.

904
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:50,320
I cannot tell you how uninterested,

905
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,261
no, positively sickened, I am..
at the thought of visiting your...

906
01:16:53,461 --> 01:16:55,357
your dollar printing machine!

907
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:59,460
For crying out loud. When does anybody
get to go to Disneyland, with Walt Disney himself?!

908
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:05,413
Disappointments are to the soul,
what the thunderstorm is to the air.

909
01:17:05,613 --> 01:17:06,613
Hello?

910
01:17:12,952 --> 01:17:15,390
He hung up!

911
01:17:25,503 --> 01:17:26,250
Gangs, We gotta fix this.

912
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,300
Father, winds from the east.

913
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:44,891
The Aunt.

914
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,530
Now,

915
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:25,381
I've brought every new fangled treatment
available in Sydney.

916
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,630
Close your mouth please Biddy,
we are not a codfish.

917
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:46,180
Now, I see a multitude of jobs
that need to be done!

918
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:51,110
They've been so worried-- I've--
- Do stop babbling nonsense!

919
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:55,300
I'm here now
and I shall fix everything.

920
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,282
I thought I had made it quite clear,
that you two were to begin helping.

921
01:19:01,482 --> 01:19:02,482
Hmm?

922
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:06,098
Spit spot!

923
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,400
Where are we--? This isn't the way.

924
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,530
Change of venue this morning, apparently.

925
01:19:13,345 --> 01:19:15,450
Ugh.

926
01:19:32,205 --> 01:19:34,704
Wow!

927
01:19:34,705 --> 01:19:38,576
There he is!
Living, breathing.

928
01:19:39,705 --> 01:19:42,330
Oh boy!

929
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:56,565
Oh, I can get that.

930
01:19:56,850 --> 01:20:00,630
Mrs.Travers, Welcome to the Magic Kingdom!

931
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,970
Is it all like this?

932
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,273
Yup! Isn't it wonderful?

933
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,038
Do you always get everything you want, Walter?

934
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:15,240
Pretty much!

935
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:17,670
With the exception of the rights
to my books of course!

936
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:19,750
Well, War ain't over yet Pam!

937
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,760
War ain't over yet.

938
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:24,620
I love you so much! Can I--?

939
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,990
Sure, sure..there you go.

940
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:30,890
Pre-signed?

941
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,610
Hey, You should get hers too.
This woman's a bona fide genius!

942
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:39,340
Tour starts this way, Pam!

943
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:42,280
Hot dog!

944
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,980
Whoa, move along,
move along.

945
01:20:52,101 --> 01:20:54,840
Each section of the park, has a high point.
So, you can get your benefits.

946
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:59,240
In Adventureland there is a tree--

947
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:01,490
This is a fun fact. A titbit.

948
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:03,180
- Tidbit.

949
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,730
It got three million leaves,

950
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,750
four million flowers.

951
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:11,227
Gosh.
- And they said only God could make a tree!

952
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:31,150
Where did she come from?

953
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:33,480
- Who?

954
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:34,970
Oh, I think you know who.

955
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:37,640
She flew in through the window, one day.

956
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,670
Through the window huh?

957
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:44,400
It's just that easy, isn't it Mrs Travers?

958
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,200
You see those spirals?

959
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:50,420
Plated with 24 carat gold.

960
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,230
Now, I know you don't wanna be here
so I'm gonna take you to one ride--

961
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:03,398
My favourite amusement,
and then.. I'll set you free.

962
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,397
Mrs Travers, I would be honoured
if you would take a ride on Jingles, here.

963
01:22:19,597 --> 01:22:20,597
She's Mrs Disney's favourite horse.

964
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:23,560
No, thank you. I'm happy to watch.

965
01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:28,737
Now, there's no greater joy,
than that seen through the eyes of a child.

966
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:32,213
There's a child in us all.
- Maybe in you Mister Disney,

967
01:22:32,413 --> 01:22:33,413
but certainly not in me.

968
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:35,000
Get on the horse Pamela!

969
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:46,850
Now, When we first met,
you said to me they're family.?
970
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,715
I said what?

971
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:52,078
Mary Poppins,
the Banks's, they're family.

972
01:22:52,278 --> 01:22:54,409
The boys have had an idea
for your Mister Banks.

973
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:58,550
I think it'll make you happy.
- You brought me all the way out here, to tell me that?

974
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,570
Oh, no..No. I brought you all the way out here
for monetary gain.

975
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:04,280
Had a wager with the boys,

976
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:07,910
that I couldn't get you on a ride.
I just won 20 bucks.

977
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:09,110
Yah!

978
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:06,840
All the garments are half done.

979
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:48,580
Good morning, Mrs Travers!

980
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:53,400
What horrors have you in store for
my beautiful characters today?

981
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:55,190
You, sit here.

982
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,640
What're you upto?

983
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,680
We were thinking about..

984
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,910
what you said,

985
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:09,750
and..you are right.

986
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,260
Mr Banks isn't cruel. He isn't.

987
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,077
So, we've got a new ending for the film.

988
01:25:20,277 --> 01:25:23,105
Oh god, I hope you like it.

989
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:42,616
Michael says, he mended it! It's wonderful!?
990
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:17,260
However did you manage it?

991
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:50,000
He mended the kite?

992
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:52,140
<i>With...</i>

993
01:25:52,725 --> 01:25:55,224
<i> tuppence for paper and strings</i>

994
01:25:55,225 --> 01:25:59,124
<i> You can have your own set of wings.</i>

995
01:26:00,075 --> 01:26:02,574
<i> With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight!</i>

996
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:08,005
<i>with your fist holding tight,
To the string of your kite .</i>

997
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:13,220
<i>Oh oh oh oh!
Let's go fly a kite.</i>

998
01:26:13,805 --> 01:26:21,057
<i>Up to the highest height,
Let's go fly a kite.</i>

999
01:26:21,365 --> 01:26:25,068
<i> and send it, soaring </i>

1000
01:26:25,405 --> 01:26:28,165
<i>Up through the atmosphere.</i>

1001
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:32,039
<i>Up where the air is clear.</i>

1002
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:37,405
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite.</i>

1003
01:26:37,605 --> 01:26:41,067
And then, Mrs Banks runs to her house.

1004
01:26:41,525 --> 01:26:44,024
She gets the suffragettes ribbon.

1005
01:26:44,025 --> 01:26:47,815
And says,
<i>“A proper kite needs a proper tail don't you think?!?/i>

1006
01:26:48,335 --> 01:26:53,235
<i>Oh, oh oh!
Let's go fly a kite.</i>

1007
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,419
<i>Up to the highest height,</i>

1008
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:00,290
<i>Let's go fly a kite...</i>

1009
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:04,565
<i> and send it soaring,</i>

1010
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:07,759
<i>Up through the atmosphere.</i>

1011
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,310
<i>Up where the air is clear.</i>

1012
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:17,984
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite!</i>

1013
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:25,785
<i>When you send it flying up there;
All at once you're lighter than air</i>

1014
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:31,185
<i>You can dance on the breeze over
houses and trees with your fist holding tight,--</i>

1015
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:35,694
<i>To the string of your kite.</i>

1016
01:27:38,598 --> 01:27:39,550
Mr Disney! Walt!

1017
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,850
I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's just she's--

1018
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,490
She's dancing!

1019
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,114
Mrs Travers. She's dancing with Don!

1020
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:54,180
<i>Oh, Oh Oh Oh!
Let's go fly a kite.</i>

1021
01:27:54,695 --> 01:27:56,620
<i>Up to the highest height.</i>

1022
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:04,841
<i>Let's go fly a kite
and send it soaring..</i>

1023
01:28:05,315 --> 01:28:07,814
<i>Up through the atmosphere.</i>

1024
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:11,947
<i>Up where the air is clear.</i>

1025
01:28:12,147 --> 01:28:18,386
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite!</i>

1026
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:25,050
Oh! He fixes the kite!
Oh, I love it!

1027
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:30,654
Though proper English would be
-let us go and fly a kite.?
1028
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,820
<i>Let us go..and fly a..</i>

1029
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,560
But, I might be willing to overlook that.

1030
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:38,670
Alright!

1031
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:41,709
Very good!

1032
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,140
Father?

1033
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:54,350
You're quite right? You know,
It is beautiful. Exquisite.

1034
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,320
It's always new.

1035
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:09,060
So, Jolly Holiday's in?
- By all means.

1036
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:11,900
Wonderful!
- I do have a question about it actually.

1037
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:17,943
How in the world does Mister Disney
propose to train penguins to dance?

1038
01:30:18,143 --> 01:30:20,412
I've heard about his implausibly leaved trees.

1039
01:30:20,612 --> 01:30:24,975
So, I assume he does have some insane penguin wrangling
scheme but it does seem rather far fetched.

1040
01:30:25,175 --> 01:30:28,814
Can you train a
penguin to dance?

1041
01:30:29,014 --> 01:30:30,320
No.

1042
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,531
I don't think you can train--
- They're animated.

1043
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:39,190
They are what?
- Cartoons.

1044
01:30:46,218 --> 01:30:47,433
What?

1045
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:53,950
Are we getting real penguins?

1046
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:58,540
Good afternoon Mrs Travers!

1047
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,530
I'm here to see Mister Disney.

1048
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:09,680
Mrs Travers!

1049
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:12,610
I'm terribly, sorry..Walt.

1050
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:14,400
It's Alright Tommie, just close the door.

1051
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,740
Never let anybody see me smoking.
I'll hate to encourage bad habits.

1052
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:24,630
Please, sit down.
- I shall not sit in the seat of a trickster! A fraudster! A sneak!

1053
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,380
Pamela--
- MRS TRAVERS. PLEASE!

1054
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:30,900
Mrs Travers, what hasyou so upset now?

1055
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:32,740
Penguins!

1056
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:35,840
Penguins have very much upset me,
Mister Disney!

1057
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,501
Animated, dancing penguins!

1058
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:44,122
Now, you have seduced me with the music Mr Disney,
yes you have. Those Sherman boys have quite turned my head;

1059
01:31:44,322 --> 01:31:48,467
but I shall not be moved
on the matter of cartoons, Sir.

1060
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:50,020
Not.. one inch!

1061
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,270
It's a sequence--

1062
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:56,960
You promised me. You promised me
that this film would not be an animation!

1063
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,750
And it isn't!

1064
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,940
So, they're real penguins?

1065
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:05,480
No, they're animated.

1066
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:07,710
But, the actors you see...

1067
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,415
the actor is very very much real.

1068
01:32:10,615 --> 01:32:11,615
You foolish old woman.

1069
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:23,210
Pamela! Pam!

1070
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:33,520
Dolly, would you be so kind
to ring my driver, he can come collect me?

1071
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:36,630
Yes, Ma'm.
-Thank you.

1072
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,260
Here we are, Mrs.
- Thank you.

1073
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:06,640
It's been a pleasure driving you Mrs.

1074
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:10,970
No one likes a fibber.
- NO..no. No.

1075
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:13,840
I really have enjoyed it.

1076
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,883
Didn't know who you were at first
and then guess what?

1077
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:24,890
You found out?
- I was telling my daughter all about my day..

1078
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,950
and how I was driving this nice writer lady,
Mrs Travers for Mr Disney.

1079
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:30,680
and uh--

1080
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:33,610
And--

1081
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,320
And--

1082
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:43,063
And, she made me go to her bedroom
and  bring her this!

1083
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,480
Can't stop reading it. You know..

1084
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:49,780
I'm very slow mind you.

1085
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:52,410
Would you like me to sign it?

1086
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:55,400
Would you?!

1087
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:58,640
I'll be honoured.

1088
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:07,570
To..

1089
01:34:08,670 --> 01:34:09,710
Jane.

1090
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:14,012
and her dearest father--

1091
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:18,840
I've just this instant realized
I don't know your name.

1092
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,040
Ralph.

1093
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:22,200
Pamela.

1094
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,109
You're the only American
I have ever liked, Ralph.

1095
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,770
May I ask why?

1096
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:34,970
No. Now,

1097
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:36,610
take this--

1098
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,760
Albert Einstein,

1099
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:41,450
Van Gogh,
Roosevelt,

1100
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:45,250
Frida Kehlo..
- Kahlo.

1101
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:49,160
What is this?
- They all had difficulties.

1102
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:53,673
Jane, can do anything,
that anyone else can do.

1103
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:55,280
Do you understand?

1104
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,200
Oh.

1105
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:03,320
I almost forgot,
turn it aroud.

1106
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:06,680
Walt Disney!

1107
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:12,932
Hyperactive behavior and deficiencies in concentration.
It explains everything!

1108
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,450
Thank you, Mrs.

1109
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:28,830
She has come and gone, huh?

1110
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:31,180
- Yeah, Flight left 10 minutes ago.

1111
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,480
Beverly Hotel, front lemousine..

1112
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,410
First class plane ticket back to England,

1113
01:35:38,908 --> 01:35:43,516
Wait, Goff? Who's Helen Goff?

1114
01:35:43,716 --> 01:35:45,748
That's her. That's her real name.

1115
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:46,948
She acts so, hoity toity British
and she's really an Aussie.

1116
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:52,411
Then, who's Travers?

1117
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,690
I've been talking to the wrong person.

1118
01:36:18,589 --> 01:36:20,301
He is gone.

1119
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:26,080
No, no..no you mustn't.

1120
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:30,575
Let her go, Margaret.

1121
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,786
I dropped the pears.

1122
01:37:11,474 --> 01:37:13,729
I'm sorry, daddy.

1123
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Helen, dear girl...

1124
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:23,960
You promised, you would fix everything.

1125
01:38:01,570 --> 01:38:03,813
Hello, house.

1126
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:39,520
Oh, dear god!

1127
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,640
It was one heck of a job getting a seat..

1128
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:46,235
on the very next flight, let me tell you.

1129
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,650
Mrs.Travers..

1130
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:55,063
I could sure use, a nice pot
of English tea, about now.

1131
01:39:02,931 --> 01:39:03,955
Here we are.

1132
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:06,290
Allow me.

1133
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:10,205
The milk goes in first. Milk.

1134
01:39:10,405 --> 01:39:11,405
I remember.

1135
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:15,800
And, a spoonful of sugar?

1136
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:18,748
I think, I'll have whiskey.

1137
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,860
Oh well, when in Rome!

1138
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:40,202
You've come to change my mind. Haven't you?

1139
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,020
To beat me into submission.

1140
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:48,993
No, no. I've come because, you misjudge me.

1141
01:39:49,193 --> 01:39:50,193
Yeah.

1142
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,050
How do I misjudge you?

1143
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:58,000
You look at me and you see
some kind of Hollywood King Midas.

1144
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:04,598
You think, I've built an empire and that I want to use your
Mary Poppins as just another brick in my kingdom.

1145
01:40:04,798 --> 01:40:06,966
- And don't you?

1146
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,940
If that was all it was,

1147
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:13,350
would I have pursued an cranky,
stubborn dame like you for twenty years?

1148
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:16,963
I would have saved myself an ulcer!

1149
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:23,290
No, you expected me to disappoint you
and so, you made sure I did.

1150
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:28,040
Well, I think life disappoints you, Mrs Travers.

1151
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:34,068
I think it's done that a lot. And i think,
Mary Poppins is the only person in your life who hasn't.

1152
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,939
- Mary Poppins, isn't real.
- That's not true.

1153
01:40:39,139 --> 01:40:42,849
Oh, no. She's real as can be to my daughter's

1154
01:40:43,049 --> 01:40:45,280
and to thousands of other children--
adults too.

1155
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:50,143
Been there as a nighttime comfort
to a heck of a lot of people.

1156
01:40:50,343 --> 01:40:51,990
Well, Where is she when I need her?

1157
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:56,260
Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins
and who should be standing there..

1158
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:58,540
...but Walt Disney!

1159
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:02,790
Mrs Travers, I am so sorry.

1160
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:04,910
I hoped--

1161
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:11,183
this would be a magical experience for you,
for all of us.  But I let you down--

1162
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:14,840
and in doing so, I've broken
a twenty year old promise I made to my daughters.

1163
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:23,632
I've been wracking my brains,
trying to figure out why this has been so hard for you and I--

1164
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,590
Well...

1165
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:33,260
You see, I have my own Mr Banks.

1166
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:37,250
Mine had a moustache.

1167
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:43,170
So, not true that Disney
created man in his own image?

1168
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:47,550
But it is true that you created yourself
in someone else's, yes?

1169
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:55,129
Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs Travers?
Do you know Missouri at all?

1170
01:41:55,810 --> 01:42:00,460
I can't say I do.
- Well, It's mighty cold there in the winters. Bitter cold.

1171
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:07,310
My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a newspaper delivery route there.
Thousand papers. Twice daily.

1172
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:08,960
The morning and an evening edition.

1173
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:13,570
Dad, he was a tough businessman.
He was a...

1174
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:16,773
..save-a-penny anywhere you can type of fella;

1175
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:22,120
So, he wouldn't employ any delivery boys,
no, no..no. he just used me and

1176
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,390
my big brother Roy.

1177
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:29,381
I was uh, I was eight back then.
Just eight years old.

1178
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,930
Like I said, those winters were harsh..

1179
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:38,130
and old Elias didn't believe in new shoes until,
the old ones were worn right through.

1180
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:42,400
Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow drift
sometimes they were up over my head!

1181
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:45,740
We'd push through it like wading through molasses.

1182
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:50,470
And the cold and the wet would be
seeping through the shoes.

1183
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,520
Skin peeling from our faces.

1184
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,430
sometimes, I'll find myself sunk down in the snow,

1185
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:03,457
Just waking up, cuz I must've passed out
or something, I dunno.

1186
01:43:03,657 --> 01:43:06,060
Then, it's time for school, i was too cold
too wet,

1187
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:08,740
to figure out an equations and things.

1188
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:12,880
Then, it was right back out into the snow
again to get home just before dark.

1189
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,150
My mother would feed us dinner..

1190
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:20,890
..and then, it was time to go right back out again,
for the evening edition.

1191
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:25,800
You best be quick there Walt,

1192
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:31,120
get those newspapers up on that porch,
and under that store and doors..

1193
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:32,320
or poppa's gonna loose his temper again
and show you the buckle under his belt.

1194
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,825
Now, I don't tell you,
all this to make you sad Mrs Travers,

1195
01:43:45,025 --> 01:43:46,912
I don't. I love my life.

1196
01:43:47,112 --> 01:43:49,147
I think it's a miracle. And I loved my dad.

1197
01:43:49,347 --> 01:43:50,347
He was a wonderful man.

1198
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:53,610
But, rare is the day..

1199
01:43:54,230 --> 01:44:01,105
where I don't think of that little boy
delivering newspapers in the snow.

1200
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:08,513
And old Elias Disney with his strap and fist..
and I'm just so tired--

1201
01:44:08,713 --> 01:44:09,713
Mrs. Travers.

1202
01:44:09,913 --> 01:44:14,930
I'm tired of remembering it, that way.

1203
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,770
Aren't you tired too, Mrs Travers?

1204
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:25,112
We all have our tales but
don't you want to finish the story?

1205
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:29,802
Let it all go and have a life
that isn't dictated by a past?

1206
01:44:34,065 --> 01:44:36,362
It's not the children she comes to save.

1207
01:44:38,151 --> 01:44:39,812
It's their father.

1208
01:44:43,101 --> 01:44:44,965
It's your father--

1209
01:44:45,165 --> 01:44:48,509
Travers Goff.

1210
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:56,765
- I don't know what you think you know
about me, Walter.

1211
01:44:56,965 --> 01:45:00,951
You must've loved and admired him
a lot to take his name.

1212
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:02,840
It's all about him, isn't it?

1213
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:05,912
All of it. Everything.

1214
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:14,696
Forgiveness, Mrs.Travers.
It's what I learned from your books.

1215
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:17,450
- I don't need to forgive my father.
He was a wonderful man.

1216
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,760
No,

1217
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:23,141
you need to forgive Helen Goff.

1218
01:45:24,825 --> 01:45:28,480
Life is a harsh sentence to lay down for yourself.

1219
01:45:32,424 --> 01:45:35,465
Give her to me, Mrs Travers.

1220
01:45:35,665 --> 01:45:39,090
Trust me, with your precious Mary Poppins.

1221
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,640
I won't disappoint you.

1222
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:45,330
I swear, that every time a person
walks into a movie house.

1223
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,840
- from Leicester to Kansas City..

1224
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,090
they will see, George Banks being saved.

1225
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:53,850
They will love him and his kids,

1226
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:57,284
they will weep for his cares,

1227
01:45:57,940 --> 01:46:01,434
They will wring their hands,
when he loses his job.

1228
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:05,721
And when he flies that kite,

1229
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:08,680
oh Mrs Travers! They will rejoice,

1230
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,500
they will sing.

1231
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:14,580
In movie houses all over the world,

1232
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:20,519
in the eyes and the hearts of my kids, and other kids and
their mothers and fathers  for generations to come,

1233
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:24,022
George Banks, will be honoured.

1234
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:26,510
George Banks will be redeemed.

1235
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:31,360
George Banks and all he stands for will be saved.

1236
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:36,009
Maybe, not in life, but in imagination.

1237
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:38,450
Because, that's what we storytellers do.

1238
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,140
We restore order with imagination.

1239
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:46,332
We instill hope, again and again and again.

1240
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:53,110
Trust me, Mrs Travers.
Let me prove it to you.

1241
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:57,637
I give you my word.

1242
01:47:14,657 --> 01:47:17,472
Enough.

1243
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:41,110
Make those two changes,
I'm sure everything will be just fine.

1244
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:44,707
Walt, could i get your approval on that please.

1245
01:47:44,907 --> 01:47:47,910
What is it?
- Invitation list for the premiere.

1246
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:49,110
Is this everyone?

1247
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:50,310
It's not everyone.

1248
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:58,160
There'll be a premiere in London,
that'll be more convenient for her.

1249
01:48:00,251 --> 01:48:04,145
Tommie, this wasn't an easy decision for me.
But, you know what she is like.

1250
01:48:04,345 --> 01:48:09,100
We got press interviews, cameras--
I need to protect the picture.

1251
01:48:11,138 --> 01:48:12,851
- Okay.

1252
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:36,594
Just answer the door!

1253
01:48:38,551 --> 01:48:40,630
I am very pleased to hear that Pamela.

1254
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:41,830
I should think, you'll have a draft very soon.

1255
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:45,160
Polly! Where's that tea?
It's coming along marvelously!

1256
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,950
Aren't you going to pour it, for us?

1257
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:54,960
You're perfectly capable 
of pouring it yourself.

1258
01:48:58,026 --> 01:49:00,058
She's quite the worst maid I've ever had!

1259
01:49:00,258 --> 01:49:03,181
So, why do you keep her?
- I don't know, she reminds me of me.

1260
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:07,830
Do you have a title?
- Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.

1261
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:09,030
Wonderful.

1262
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:13,550
Should we start talking about, the film rights?

1263
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:16,862
NEVER again.
- Okay.

1264
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:21,453
Now, tell me, Have you got your tiara
 for the premiere?

1265
01:49:21,653 --> 01:49:22,653
Oh, I'm not going to that.

1266
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:23,880
Why not?

1267
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:27,040
Hollywood premieres are not for old trout like me.

1268
01:49:28,226 --> 01:49:30,130
 Anyway, it's not convenient.

1269
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,340
He hasn't invited you, has he?

1270
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:39,610
Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for that!

1271
01:49:46,752 --> 01:49:49,384
Can I help you?
- I'm perfectly capable, thank you.

1272
01:49:49,584 --> 01:49:50,534
As i recall.

1273
01:49:53,035 --> 01:49:55,755
Sweet of you.

1274
01:49:58,725 --> 01:50:01,224
Walt?
- Hello Dolly!

1275
01:50:01,225 --> 01:50:03,340
Walt?
- Tommie,

1276
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:06,329
 you're gonna have to move that meeting with G.E.

1277
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,615
What?

1278
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:19,150
Mrs. Travers!
- Me again!

1279
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:21,040
How wonderful to see you.

1280
01:50:22,090 --> 01:50:23,330
I'm here for my premiere.

1281
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:26,690
Great!

1282
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:29,645
I didn't receive my invitation,
but I just assumed

1283
01:50:29,845 --> 01:50:33,265
 the American postal service had
fallen down on the job, as per usual.

1284
01:50:34,190 --> 01:50:37,090
I'll have a replacement, 
sent to your hotel right away.

1285
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:41,649
You are very kind, Mr Disney.
I knew you wouldn't have forgotten me.

1286
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:48,033
Pam, how could I forget you?

1287
01:50:48,233 --> 01:50:54,390
Good evening.

1288
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:56,570
Hello, could you please order me a cab?

1289
01:50:56,770 --> 01:50:58,779
Absolutely.

1290
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:17,819
Ralph!

1291
01:51:18,019 --> 01:51:22,063
I had a feeling, a certain friend of mine
might be needing me tonight.

1292
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:30,850
Wow!

1293
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:32,340
You look like a million bucks!

1294
01:51:33,330 --> 01:51:34,320
Thank you.

1295
01:51:36,245 --> 01:51:39,206
Let's get you to that ball, huh?
- Thank you, Ralph, thank you.

1296
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:28,625
This is your night.

1297
01:52:28,825 --> 01:52:32,947
None of this would be possible
without you.

1298
01:54:57,970 --> 01:55:00,870
Sometimes, the person we love.
Through no fault of his own,

1299
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:03,230
can't see past the end of his nose.

1300
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:08,080
What's the end of his nose.

1301
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:11,573
Now, your dad is a fine gentleman.
And he loves you.

1302
01:55:11,773 --> 01:55:15,434
I don't think so.
You should've seen the look on his face.

1303
01:55:15,634 --> 01:55:17,040
It doesn't look like his own.

1304
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:21,410
Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?

1305
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:26,015
You know, i met your father..

1306
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:32,350
There he is in that cold,
heartless bank day after day,

1307
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:36,090
 hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.

1308
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:38,550
I don't want to see any living thing caged up.

1309
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:40,800
Father in a cage?

1310
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,740
They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.

1311
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,470
Bank-shaped some of 'em,
carpets and all.

1312
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:49,110
Mary Poppins, You won't ever leave us will you?

1313
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:51,760
Whatever would we do without you?

1314
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,390
<i>- I shall stay until, the wind changes.</i>

1315
01:56:30,370 --> 01:56:31,490
It's all right.

1316
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:37,626
It's all right, Mrs Travers.
Mr Banks is going to be all right. I promise.

1317
01:56:37,826 --> 01:56:38,826
No, no. It's just that-- 

1318
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:44,007
I can't, I can't abide cartoons!

1319
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:54,900
<i>Ohhh! Let's go fly a kite.</i>

1320
01:56:55,370 --> 01:56:58,752
<i>Up to the highest height.</i>

1321
01:56:58,952 --> 01:57:05,442
<i>Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring,</i>

1322
01:57:05,642 --> 01:57:08,841
<i>Up through the atmosphere..</i>

1323
01:57:09,041 --> 01:57:12,309
<i>Up where the air is clear...</i>

1324
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:41,511
Don't leave me.

1325
01:57:43,893 --> 01:57:45,661
Never.

1326
01:57:45,861 --> 01:57:50,269
 I promise.
I will never lose you.

1327
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:06,321
<i>Winds in the East 
Mist coming in--</i>

1328
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:08,180
<i>--Like something is brewing,</i>

1329
01:58:09,470 --> 01:58:10,900
<i> about to begin--</i>

1330
01:58:12,670 --> 01:58:17,565
<i>Can't put me finger, on what lies in store--</i>

1331
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:20,850
<i>But I feel what's to happen,</i>

1332
01:58:21,210 --> 01:58:25,828
<i>all happened before--</i>
