1
00:03:57,876 --> 00:04:02,556
SUNDAY 11:00 AM

2
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:18,716
Juan Pablo, your mother said to call
Pick up the clothes

3
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:22,116
-Two hundred pesos should be enough
-And the Cokes?

4
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,716
Keep the change for me

5
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,596
Come here

6
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:34,316
There's your aunt's number

7
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,196
-Call me mid-afternoon
-Yes

8
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:46,356
Check that l turned off the stove

9
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:48,156
-Yes
-Check it

10
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:49,476
Yes

11
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:55,676
The coffee maker

12
00:04:58,316 --> 00:05:00,476
Mario, did I turn off
the coffee maker?

13
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:01,676
Yes

14
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:55,516
DUCK SEASON

15
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:37,036
What?

16
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:41,196
You didn't even say hello, arsehole

17
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:58,236
Finger

18
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:03,996
Finger

19
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:09,356
Finger

20
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:41,076
-Bin Laden
-No way! You had him last time

21
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,476
-So?
-I'll go with Bush again

22
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,236
Where are you?

23
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:14,076
Pass

24
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:15,876
-It's your house
-So?

25
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:18,156
-Answer the door
-I don't give a shit!

26
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:19,956
Well. I don't give a shit either

27
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:30,116
Time out

28
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:37,636
<i>-Who is it?
-Your neighbour</i>

29
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:38,796
<i>What is it?</i>

30
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:41,356
I just came to see
if I could use your oven

31
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:42,636
Mine is broken

32
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,556
<i>No, my mum isn't home</i>

33
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:00,636
<i>-What?
-Just for fifteen minutes</i>

34
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:01,956
OK, come in

35
00:09:09,276 --> 00:09:10,236
Lock the door

36
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,196
I mean, if it's a problem,
l'd better not

37
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:29,756
Just fifteen minutes

38
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:46,556
Shit!

39
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:07,316
-I'll kill you, wanker
-Go on then!

40
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,156
Where are you?

41
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:33,236
There you are

42
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:37,476
Fucking poof. Come out!

43
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,796
Did the electricity go off?

44
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:18,796
The problem is,
without electricity...

45
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,076
...I'm going to have
to beat it by hand

46
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:22,876
It will take a little longer

47
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:55,036
What?

48
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:32,716
Hey, do you know what
sixty-three degrees is in Fahrenheit?

49
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:56,836
Can you hear that?

50
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:04,876
What is it?

51
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:09,556
The sink. The tap always drips

52
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:14,916
Are you hungry?

53
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:22,516
Why don't we order pizza?

54
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:26,036
-Large with mushrooms...
-Hey, no! Salami

55
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,436
OK, half mushroom and half salami

56
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:32,116
And two large Cokes

57
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:36,476
Nonoalco Tlatelolco housing estate

58
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,276
Niños Heroes building, flat 803

59
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:42,156
Have them knock,
because the electricity is off

60
00:14:12,556 --> 00:14:14,716
Why do you time them?
They always make it

61
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:37,676
<i>-Who is it?
-Telepizza, your friendly pizza</i>

62
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:40,156
Hello, mate

63
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:45,636
Large, half salami
and half mushroom, right?

64
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:47,796
-And two Cokes, please

65
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:52,916
-One... And here's the other
-Thanks

66
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:54,756
No, no, no...

67
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:57,996
That'll be a hundred and ninety

68
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,756
No, you were eleven seconds late

69
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,036
No. I got here
in exactly thirty minutes

70
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:06,076
Our stopwatch says you were late

71
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:09,796
-But mine says I wasn't
-So, what shall we do?

72
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:16,276
Call your parents, kid. Go on

73
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:21,596
First of all, my mother is not home

74
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:23,756
And secondly, don't call me kid

75
00:18:25,076 --> 00:18:26,276
OK, OK

76
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:43,076
What are you doing?

77
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:46,436
Sorry, I'm not leaving
until I get paid

78
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:56,156
A bet?

79
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,076
"Halo"

80
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:06,236
-What's "Halo"?
-It's a video game

81
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,756
The winner gets the pizzas
and the money

82
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:14,036
The loser gets nothing

83
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:19,796
What about football?

84
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:26,756
-Manchester
-But what about the line-up?

85
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:29,276
With a four, three, three formation?

86
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:31,676
No, we should play a five, three, two

87
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,796
-No way
-Listen...

88
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:37,436
No, because the five, three, two...

89
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:38,996
We haven't played for ages

90
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:42,236
-It doesn't matter
-If you say so

91
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,556
We'd have to pay for it

92
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:45,836
Go

93
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,516
Let's play

94
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,156
Level?

95
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,836
Amateur, pro or world class?

96
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:59,356
-World class?
-What? Is there any other?

97
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:06,196
Can you set your watch
for fifteen minutes?

98
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:15,436
Ready?

99
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:17,596
Go!

100
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:19,756
The first half is on!

101
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:34,516
Goal!

102
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:38,996
I was distracted.
I was distracted, that's all

103
00:21:57,676 --> 00:21:58,636
Goal!

104
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:01,756
One all

105
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:15,756
He sends it centre, some head
action... He's going to hit it...

106
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:17,636
Goal!

107
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:31,876
Goal!

108
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:40,716
Looks like
we'll be having free pizzas

109
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:49,476
No, careful!

110
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:04,276
Goal!

111
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:13,636
I told you not to use
that defence formation

112
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:14,996
You play, then

113
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:17,676
I'm not criticising, just advising

114
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:29,516
Golden goal!

115
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,916
Have a good stretch, man

116
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,916
-And you're up
-Here goes

117
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:56,036
He passes the ball

118
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,636
-What the hell?
-It was a goal

119
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,716
-No goal
-Of course it was, it went in

120
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:35,836
He was right at the corner

121
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:38,756
-Yeah, but it didn't go in
-It was a perfect shot

122
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:42,076
-It was clearly a goal
-But it was a goal

123
00:24:42,276 --> 00:24:43,796
It didn't go in

124
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,156
-It was about to hit the crossbar
-It's not true, it was going down

125
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:15,356
-It was already in
-Really, it was inside

126
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,636
Don't cheat now

127
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:20,396
-Don't cheat!
-No way!

128
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:31,316
Martita?

129
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,716
Tell Jorge that
I'm going to be a bit late

130
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:37,516
I had a problem with a delivery

131
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:40,396
I'll be there in ten minutes,
don't worry

132
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:41,716
OK, bye

133
00:25:47,836 --> 00:25:48,916
It was a goal

134
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,716
Don't you want to put it here?

135
00:26:59,876 --> 00:27:01,316
So it won't get cold

136
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:12,956
Pay me

137
00:27:31,036 --> 00:27:32,716
Isn't that a pretty picture?

138
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:35,716
It's horrible

139
00:27:38,716 --> 00:27:40,516
Well, it's a matter of taste

140
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:43,396
It's a matter
of who fucks over who

141
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:58,036
His parents are fighting
over who gets to keep it

142
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:02,716
Who bought it?

143
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,556
They won it in a raffle
at a Christmas party

144
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:12,316
His dad had kept both tickets,
his and his mum's

145
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:16,876
One of them won, but they
were never sure which one it was

146
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:20,836
Chivalry says it was his mother's

147
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:27,436
Let's see -
if you had two raffle tickets...

148
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:30,556
...yours and your boyfriend's,
for a car, say

149
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,156
And you won the car...

150
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:38,836
...but you weren't sure
whose ticket was whose

151
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:43,836
Don't tell me you would give it
to your boyfriend?

152
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,276
And whose party was it?

153
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:50,716
His mum's

154
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:56,716
Well then,
if his mum hadn't gone...

155
00:28:57,076 --> 00:28:59,236
...his father
wouldn't have been there

156
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:01,716
Yes, but if his mum had gone alone...

157
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:04,796
...there would only be one ticket

158
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:07,116
And maybe that wasn't
the winning ticket

159
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:20,516
What?

160
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:52,876
The alarm didn't go off

161
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:55,596
What's your name?

162
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,036
Juan Pablo

163
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:03,636
Pablito, you'll help me.
It's your fault my cake burned

164
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:09,076
You should exercise your memory

165
00:30:12,236 --> 00:30:16,796
You have to care about something
to remember it, don't you?

166
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:40,996
You'll be hours

167
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:45,876
No I won't. It says here
preparation time is forty minutes

168
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:49,196
Help me chop the strawberries, OK?

169
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:51,936
Yes, sir

170
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:54,076
I know

171
00:30:55,276 --> 00:30:56,356
I'm on my way

172
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:02,236
So that's it

173
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:24,476
Now you're fucked!

174
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:50,516
You have to sieve it well
or it will end up lumpy

175
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,356
Juan Pablo is John Paul,
like the Pope

176
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:18,316
They call me Moko, with a 'K'

177
00:32:21,996 --> 00:32:23,196
My name is Rita

178
00:32:31,956 --> 00:32:33,276
I saw the Pope once

179
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:39,636
I mean, I was really little,
when we went with my mum

180
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:42,236
He went down the Insurgentes
and we saw him

181
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:46,116
It was like a miracle, you know?

182
00:32:47,076 --> 00:32:51,236
He was going by and all of a sudden
they stopped the Popemobile

183
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:55,996
And he started walking,
you know, all holy

184
00:32:56,796 --> 00:33:00,516
And he walked and walked
and went right by me and my mum...

185
00:33:00,836 --> 00:33:02,516
...and he stared right at me

186
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:09,076
-And then what?
-Nothing

187
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:12,956
If we don't clean it up,
it will get infected

188
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:25,276
How do you separate the yolks?

189
00:33:27,316 --> 00:33:29,236
It doesn't matter,
just toss them in

190
00:33:34,156 --> 00:33:36,516
-How old are you?
-Fourteen

191
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:41,556
I'm sixteen

192
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,796
-When is your birthday?
-6th June

193
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,556
6th June?

194
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:55,276
January, February,
March, April, May, June

195
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:57,636
Sixth of the sixth of... What year?

196
00:33:57,956 --> 00:34:00,956
-'90
-1990? Let me see

197
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:04,556
Nine and nine is eighteen...
Ah, no, you're safe

198
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:06,316
From what?

199
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:09,436
From what? From being the Antichrist.
Six, six, six

200
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:28,556
I'm sorry, it squirted out.
Pardon me

201
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:32,276
-If you want, I can...
-No, leave it

202
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,556
Sure you don't want any water?

203
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:55,556
Set your watch
for twenty minutes, OK?

204
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:04,876
-Enough, I give up
-Relax

205
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:08,116
You have to be patient
to get the egg whites stiff

206
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:10,516
Yeah, but my arm hurts

207
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:14,836
But you're doing really well,
carry on

208
00:35:17,836 --> 00:35:19,156
It's almost ready

209
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:26,476
What do you do...

210
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:30,116
...in life?

211
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:32,516
-I go to school
-Is that all?

212
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:38,156
I listen to music
and play video games

213
00:35:43,196 --> 00:35:44,396
I sing in a band

214
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:47,876
A rock band

215
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:51,356
What's it called?

216
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,076
A Piece Of Cake

217
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:01,676
Hey, you fell for it!

218
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:23,036
They wouldn't charge me,
but there is a limit

219
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,956
You have to be more careful

220
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:50,436
What are those?

221
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:53,316
False nails.
I found them in the bathroom

222
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:56,556
-They're cool, aren't they?
-They're horrible

223
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,636
Well, the idea is not for them
to look pretty

224
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:03,276
Give me your arm

225
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:17,556
Relax!

226
00:37:18,156 --> 00:37:19,356
I am relaxed

227
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:30,636
Ethologists study animal behaviour

228
00:37:32,556 --> 00:37:34,436
I was going to be
a veterinarian but...

229
00:37:35,356 --> 00:37:38,516
Lucía said I should study ethology

230
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:40,116
Maybe I should have

231
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:45,996
Lucía was my girlfriend,
but we broke up because...

232
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:48,996
...she said my great aunt
drove her mad

233
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:54,876
I live with my great aunt,
Lucha Elena

234
00:37:57,956 --> 00:37:59,476
When I graduated...

235
00:38:00,956 --> 00:38:03,516
...I wanted to go back to San Juan

236
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:06,836
But my great aunt
was really sick and...

237
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:09,156
...I had to stay
and take care of her

238
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:16,596
I couldn't find work here...

239
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:22,396
...until one day an uncle
recommended me for a job...

240
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:25,436
...at a dog shelter

241
00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:43,196
We used to decide which ones lived...

242
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:44,956
...and which would be put down

243
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:48,956
At first, I wanted to...

244
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:54,916
...save a lot of dogs,
but which ones?

245
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,836
They killed them in the end anyway

246
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:05,996
There weren't any homes for them

247
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,476
It was like that for six months

248
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:33,116
And they started laying people off

249
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:39,876
The manager said
it was a budgetary luxury...

250
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:44,116
...to decide which dogs lived
and which didn't

251
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:49,476
They offered me the job of...

252
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,436
...killing the dogs

253
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:21,156
Until one day...

254
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:24,436
...I noticed...

255
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,036
...a patch one of the dogs had
between its eyes

256
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:54,196
And so I held him

257
00:41:27,396 --> 00:41:28,556
And then I quit

258
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:33,316
They needed delivery men
at the pizza parlour

259
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:36,036
"Enthusiastic young men
looking to get ahead

260
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:40,836
"Monday to Sunday from twelve
to eight with Wednesdays off"

261
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:45,476
I don't like delivering pizzas

262
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:49,036
But as my Aunt Lucha Elena says...

263
00:41:50,076 --> 00:41:54,036
..."Opportunities in life
are like bullets in a shotgun"

264
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:00,716
And I have already fired mine

265
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,516
<i>-What's this?
-My lucky coin</i>

266
00:42:26,996 --> 00:42:28,076
Keep it

267
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:35,396
Don't heat it in the microwave
or it will get soft

268
00:42:57,956 --> 00:42:58,916
Here, try it

269
00:43:06,236 --> 00:43:07,236
Is it too hot?

270
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:10,476
It's disgusting!

271
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:13,236
Stop exaggerating!

272
00:43:16,236 --> 00:43:17,436
No, it really is awful!

273
00:43:17,716 --> 00:43:20,676
One day I bought pair
of yellow parrots

274
00:43:20,876 --> 00:43:21,956
The kind that talk

275
00:43:23,156 --> 00:43:26,636
And then, about two months later,
they mated

276
00:43:26,876 --> 00:43:30,196
About six or seven little parrots

277
00:43:30,556 --> 00:43:32,716
And I thought of selling them

278
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:36,396
But the room they were in
was really cold

279
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:38,676
And they died

280
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,836
The worst part is
that the pair died too

281
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,756
But right away,
l realised that was a great business

282
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,796
-So?
-So I'm going to try again

283
00:43:50,396 --> 00:43:53,676
Look, with what I get
for my Christmas bonus...

284
00:43:53,956 --> 00:43:55,476
...I can buy another pair

285
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:58,116
But as that will be in December...

286
00:43:58,356 --> 00:44:01,236
...I will have to have saved
enough for a heater

287
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:05,156
Then, with the heater and the pair...

288
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:08,596
...I'll have to wait another
two months for them to go into heat

289
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:12,796
I hope the female is willing,
they usually are

290
00:44:13,116 --> 00:44:16,076
Then, all of a sudden,
you have six or seven baby parrots

291
00:44:16,276 --> 00:44:19,156
Then, you have to wait
another month for them to grow up

292
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,956
And when they're fully grown,
you could sell each one...

293
00:44:23,156 --> 00:44:26,516
...for 2,000 or 2,500,
depending on who buys them

294
00:44:28,636 --> 00:44:32,836
I have to save for two months
for the heater

295
00:44:33,076 --> 00:44:36,316
I have to wait until December
for the Christmas bonus

296
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:38,716
Then... July, August until December

297
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,956
Two months for them to mate,
one month for them to grow up

298
00:44:42,156 --> 00:44:43,836
Then I just need to sell them

299
00:44:43,956 --> 00:44:47,796
Then I can bring over my Aunt Eugenia
to take care of Aunt Lucha Elena

300
00:44:48,036 --> 00:44:50,556
And I can go back to San Juan.
What do you think?

301
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:52,836
I'll be gone within a year

302
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:04,676
We should make brownies,
they're easier

303
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:09,356
-You'll be making them by yourself
-What?

304
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:11,596
I already helped you make a cake

305
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:24,636
-Why don't you close your eyes?
-Why don't you?

306
00:45:25,676 --> 00:45:26,876
OK, close them

307
00:45:33,716 --> 00:45:35,756
-What?
-It feels funny

308
00:45:35,996 --> 00:45:37,556
-What does?
-Your tongue

309
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:39,116
Well, that's the point!

310
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,596
Let's try again. Close your eyes

311
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:55,916
We were in the kitchen, you know?

312
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:58,516
We were making a cake

313
00:45:58,716 --> 00:46:02,076
She was in the next chair...

314
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:03,956
...beating eggs, I think

315
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:06,716
An I saw her there all alone,
kind of bored

316
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:10,836
And I went up behind her and
started rubbing her back, like this

317
00:46:11,076 --> 00:46:13,596
Then her hair... her scalp, like this

318
00:46:13,956 --> 00:46:16,476
Then she turned around

319
00:46:17,036 --> 00:46:19,316
As she turned,
we looked at each other...

320
00:46:19,636 --> 00:46:21,196
...for three or four seconds

321
00:46:21,396 --> 00:46:24,716
And I kissed her
for about ten or fifteen seconds

322
00:46:26,236 --> 00:46:29,236
And then,
just before the kiss ended...

323
00:46:29,476 --> 00:46:32,996
...we kind of pulled apart
and I saw her eyes were open

324
00:46:33,196 --> 00:46:35,476
I asked her
why she hadn't closed her eyes

325
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,596
And she said, "Why didn't you?"

326
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:41,356
But I did have them closed.
So she said, "OK, let's try again"

327
00:46:41,556 --> 00:46:42,836
You know how it is

328
00:46:43,076 --> 00:46:47,596
And I said, "Here I come again,
but close your eyes"

329
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:52,596
So I went in again and the kiss
was about ten or fifteen seconds

330
00:46:52,836 --> 00:46:57,236
And it was really cool,
but suddenly, she pushed me away

331
00:46:57,556 --> 00:47:00,676
I said, "What? Now what?"

332
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:03,996
And she said she felt funny.
And I said, "What?"

333
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,436
An she said, "Your tongue".
But that's the point, isn't it?

334
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:10,876
I mean that's the thing
about French kissing

335
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:14,436
Then she said
"Again, but I'll do it to you"

336
00:47:14,636 --> 00:47:18,356
So I wanted to play hard to get
and I waited a while

337
00:47:18,716 --> 00:47:21,236
And then I got ready
and closed my eyes

338
00:47:21,476 --> 00:47:24,116
She has going to kiss me
and just before that...

339
00:47:24,316 --> 00:47:28,396
...I could feel her coming close,
about an inch away from my face

340
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:32,036
I didn't know what was happening.
She moved back and sucked my ear

341
00:47:32,356 --> 00:47:35,236
She stuck her tongue in like this...
Licking all around

342
00:47:37,996 --> 00:47:38,956
Then what?

343
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:42,236
Nothing

344
00:47:45,476 --> 00:47:47,036
You really fancy her

345
00:47:50,156 --> 00:47:51,356
How do you know?

346
00:47:54,836 --> 00:47:56,396
So you do fancy her?

347
00:47:57,596 --> 00:47:59,396
How can I tell if I do or not?

348
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:26,036
Did it get like this?

349
00:48:27,236 --> 00:48:28,196
No

350
00:48:28,436 --> 00:48:30,356
Well, this is a comic,
but more or less?

351
00:48:30,716 --> 00:48:33,836
-I didn't look at it
-But you felt it?

352
00:48:34,756 --> 00:48:35,716
Yes

353
00:48:38,236 --> 00:48:40,036
Then you do bloody fancy her

354
00:48:44,476 --> 00:48:45,516
What's that?

355
00:48:46,476 --> 00:48:47,996
This knocks them dead

356
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:17,156
Don't suck my ears any more

357
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:23,036
It is easier to make brownies

358
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:38,756
-Can you smell that?
-No

359
00:50:02,756 --> 00:50:04,076
Who are you thinking of?

360
00:50:05,876 --> 00:50:06,836
What?

361
00:50:07,396 --> 00:50:08,596
Are you sure?

362
00:50:18,396 --> 00:50:19,516
Is it good?

363
00:50:22,876 --> 00:50:24,076
Well, just a little

364
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:30,716
Blonde or brunette?

365
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:34,676
Blonde, right?

366
00:50:39,596 --> 00:50:41,516
Why do you all like
blondes so much?

367
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:45,436
Like Lourdes Azcona from 302...

368
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,836
...not very pretty,
but she's blonde

369
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:49,756
So everyone is in love with her

370
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,556
And I'm not biased, really I'm not

371
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:56,836
but the girl is a retard

372
00:50:57,316 --> 00:50:59,356
And I don't think she's very clever

373
00:51:00,676 --> 00:51:02,156
I don't think she really cares

374
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:05,036
Or even realises
that she isn't clever

375
00:51:06,716 --> 00:51:10,916
Because you need to be clever
to know if you are clever or not

376
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,276
I feel sorry for you

377
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:18,716
You're going to be bored to death
when you realise she's not clever

378
00:51:20,836 --> 00:51:21,916
Maybe not

379
00:51:22,276 --> 00:51:24,916
Maybe you don't care
about being with a clever woman

380
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:28,196
Or maybe you aren't clever either

381
00:51:28,996 --> 00:51:30,676
But sooner or later...

382
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:33,556
...you're going to want
to be with someone clever

383
00:51:37,956 --> 00:51:39,396
A palindrome

384
00:51:57,876 --> 00:52:00,396
1991 is a palindrome

385
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,596
I was born in a palindrome

386
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:13,596
Where's the sieve?

387
00:52:13,836 --> 00:52:15,876
I'm not going to dye
my hair, you know

388
00:52:16,836 --> 00:52:19,756
Besides, the dyes cause cancer.
Did you know that?

389
00:52:21,436 --> 00:52:24,756
Besides, it isn't just
a matter of being blonde

390
00:52:24,996 --> 00:52:28,436
-It's the easiest thing in the world
to dye your hair, but no

391
00:52:28,636 --> 00:52:30,916
You have to be a blonde
and exuberant

392
00:52:31,636 --> 00:52:35,556
Because if you're just a blonde,
guys get disappointed

393
00:52:36,396 --> 00:52:39,756
That's why I say it's not
so much the hair colour...

394
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:41,316
...it's the attitude

395
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:50,196
Aren't you going to tell me
who you were thinking about?

396
00:52:58,516 --> 00:53:01,036
Mum wants to take the picture
with her to Morelia

397
00:53:10,036 --> 00:53:11,716
My dad wants it to stay here

398
00:53:16,756 --> 00:53:18,556
That's why they are fighting

399
00:53:19,156 --> 00:53:22,276
Because that picture
has a lot of sentimental value

400
00:53:23,196 --> 00:53:25,716
It reminds them of the year
you were born

401
00:53:29,556 --> 00:53:31,756
It was in the cupboard
for thirteen years

402
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:42,596
Set it for twenty minutes, OK?

403
00:53:51,836 --> 00:53:53,276
<i>We were at the Techno Motion</i>

404
00:53:56,516 --> 00:53:57,756
<i>We were losing</i>

405
00:53:58,876 --> 00:54:00,156
<i>It was my turn and I jumped</i>

406
00:54:00,996 --> 00:54:03,116
<i>l spun around and landed on both legs</i>

407
00:54:11,156 --> 00:54:12,396
<i>And he hugged me</i>

408
00:54:19,996 --> 00:54:21,076
Who?

409
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:23,116
Flama

410
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:28,156
Sometimes the ducks feel
a great need to emigrate

411
00:54:31,356 --> 00:54:34,316
That doesn't mean that a duck
that emigrates is a bad duck

412
00:54:34,676 --> 00:54:37,516
But rather that its nature...

413
00:54:38,236 --> 00:54:39,676
...makes it emigrate

414
00:54:42,556 --> 00:54:44,596
Seeking new waters...

415
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,716
...or warmer climates

416
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:49,276
I don't know. They are ducks

417
00:54:52,996 --> 00:54:56,916
And...
are these fantasies recurring?

418
00:54:58,116 --> 00:54:59,196
More or less

419
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:07,636
<i>For example, in another
we were in the supermarket</i>

420
00:55:08,136 --> 00:55:09,436
<i>It was strange because...</i>

421
00:55:10,996 --> 00:55:13,756
<i>...there was no one but him and me</i>

422
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:24,436
<i>And we ate a plum</i>

423
00:55:32,476 --> 00:55:33,436
What?

424
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:35,436
Nothing

425
00:55:36,476 --> 00:55:37,916
No, what are you thinking?

426
00:55:49,276 --> 00:55:51,676
The pizza was for both of us,
dickhead

427
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,596
-I'm sorry
-No

428
00:55:55,636 --> 00:55:56,956
I'll make you a sandwich

429
00:55:58,996 --> 00:56:00,756
-Have you got Cheez Whiz?
-Yes

430
00:56:09,476 --> 00:56:10,556
What's up?

431
00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:15,276
Fuck, just look at this mess

432
00:56:15,556 --> 00:56:18,476
-It's not my fault
-You were with her, wanker

433
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:20,516
And you let her in, wanker

434
00:56:21,236 --> 00:56:22,436
Move it

435
00:56:23,516 --> 00:56:26,316
-No, my cake isn't done yet
-I don't give a shit

436
00:56:27,636 --> 00:56:30,276
The trouble is that your oven
is in Fahrenheit

437
00:56:32,396 --> 00:56:35,516
It's harder, because none
of the recipes are in Fahrenheit

438
00:56:36,596 --> 00:56:38,916
It's almost done, right?
How long to go?

439
00:56:40,036 --> 00:56:41,836
-Five minutes
-Five minutes

440
00:56:43,196 --> 00:56:44,996
Wait a minute...

441
00:56:50,996 --> 00:56:52,196
<i>Your cake is done</i>

442
00:56:54,196 --> 00:56:55,436
Get out!

443
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:07,316
-It's my birthday today
-Happy birthday

444
00:57:10,796 --> 00:57:11,996
At home they forgot

445
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:21,156
<i>Happy birthday, dear Rita</i>

446
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,156
<i>Happy birthday to me!</i>

447
00:57:42,436 --> 00:57:43,876
Truth is...

448
00:57:45,316 --> 00:57:46,636
...it is delicious

449
00:58:30,796 --> 00:58:31,876
Weed?

450
00:58:38,316 --> 00:58:39,756
What was in the jar?

451
00:58:45,596 --> 00:58:47,156
Did you put marijuana in it?

452
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,276
That sounds bloody brilliant

453
00:59:21,636 --> 00:59:22,716
Dry mouth?

454
00:59:58,436 --> 01:00:00,996
Taste it! Taste it!

455
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:16,316
Thirty-eight

456
01:00:18,636 --> 01:00:20,196
Thirty-nine

457
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:23,796
Forty!

458
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:56,516
Where did you get it?

459
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:58,196
It was my mum's

460
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:02,876
Your mum gets stoned?

461
01:01:03,836 --> 01:01:05,156
Only on weekends

462
01:01:17,396 --> 01:01:20,276
There are four of us,
like the Beatles

463
01:01:22,076 --> 01:01:23,636
The Beatles were all men

464
01:01:25,316 --> 01:01:26,636
John Lennon was a woman

465
01:01:31,796 --> 01:01:34,196
-Make a wish
-How?

466
01:01:34,556 --> 01:01:36,956
You think of a wish,
then think of a colour

467
01:01:37,196 --> 01:01:39,356
Bite into it
and if it's your colour...

468
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,036
...your wish comes true

469
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:42,236
Look, red

470
01:01:45,716 --> 01:01:46,676
Blue

471
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:50,036
Try again

472
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:52,676
Green

473
01:01:56,396 --> 01:01:57,476
Yellow

474
01:02:14,156 --> 01:02:15,716
Out of sixty-five sweets...

475
01:02:16,556 --> 01:02:18,356
...I didn't get any colours right

476
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:21,036
Here we are in Acapulco

477
01:02:22,796 --> 01:02:24,476
Here we are in Veracruz

478
01:02:26,316 --> 01:02:27,516
You were so sweet

479
01:02:27,756 --> 01:02:29,316
That's my cousin Julián

480
01:02:32,276 --> 01:02:34,436
Here we are in Cuernavaca

481
01:02:40,076 --> 01:02:41,036
What?

482
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:47,156
What?

483
01:02:49,796 --> 01:02:51,716
Neither of your parents is ginger

484
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,076
Who in your family is ginger?

485
01:03:03,716 --> 01:03:05,276
A grandfather, an uncle?

486
01:03:19,036 --> 01:03:21,076
Don't be a twat, you're not adopted

487
01:03:21,316 --> 01:03:22,876
Neither of my parents is ginger

488
01:03:23,116 --> 01:03:24,196
Relax

489
01:03:29,076 --> 01:03:30,636
Look. Who's this?

490
01:03:32,436 --> 01:03:33,876
My mum, when she was young

491
01:03:36,076 --> 01:03:37,676
Do you have one of your father?

492
01:03:44,436 --> 01:03:46,076
They look alike, but the hair...

493
01:03:49,036 --> 01:03:51,236
The colour changes with age

494
01:03:52,436 --> 01:03:54,676
No. Once a ginger, always a ginger

495
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:02,876
Shit!

496
01:04:14,156 --> 01:04:15,356
Who's that holding you?

497
01:04:17,156 --> 01:04:18,836
I think he's a waiter in Acapulco

498
01:04:24,716 --> 01:04:26,036
He has ginger hair

499
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:32,396
Maybe your parents went to Acapulco
and met this poor man...

500
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:35,996
...who couldn't support you
and gave you up for adoption

501
01:05:03,436 --> 01:05:04,796
Come on

502
01:05:09,796 --> 01:05:10,756
Can you see it?

503
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:19,076
Shit!

504
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,996
Are they moving?

505
01:06:00,716 --> 01:06:01,556
Are they moving?

506
01:06:24,036 --> 01:06:25,956
Do you know why ducks fly in a 'V'?

507
01:06:36,796 --> 01:06:40,356
The first duck that takes off
clears the way for the second one

508
01:06:41,636 --> 01:06:44,276
The second one clears the air
for the third one

509
01:06:44,996 --> 01:06:49,156
The third one's energy impels
the fourth and then...

510
01:06:49,356 --> 01:06:53,436
...the fifth and then the sixth

511
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:58,636
And so all the ducks go together...

512
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:01,596
...all sharing
the force of the flight

513
01:07:04,196 --> 01:07:07,076
Together they rise...

514
01:07:07,836 --> 01:07:11,196
...and soar through the skies

515
01:07:13,236 --> 01:07:14,676
And when a duck tires...

516
01:07:15,836 --> 01:07:20,116
...the lead duck
goes to the back of the flock

517
01:07:21,716 --> 01:07:23,956
And another duck takes its place

518
01:07:26,516 --> 01:07:28,636
And they take turns like that

519
01:07:28,886 --> 01:07:32,276
One by one,
to the front and then to the back

520
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:37,556
And when a duck
becomes exhausted...

521
01:07:39,476 --> 01:07:43,396
...two ducks leave the group
and fly with him

522
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:47,716
Until he recovers

523
01:07:49,516 --> 01:07:50,596
Or falls

524
01:08:40,356 --> 01:08:42,396
I have to find my real parents

525
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,596
I can't live without meeting them

526
01:09:05,316 --> 01:09:06,996
Why don't we go to Acapulco?

527
01:09:20,116 --> 01:09:21,196
Are you coming?

528
01:09:23,316 --> 01:09:24,516
I can't move

529
01:09:32,316 --> 01:09:33,396
OK, smile

530
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:35,916
Angry

531
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:37,236
Smile

532
01:09:38,796 --> 01:09:39,996
You're the same

533
01:09:44,076 --> 01:09:45,636
No fucking way!

534
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,436
Why are you so pissed off?
I told you you're not adopted

535
01:09:51,596 --> 01:09:52,796
That's the point

536
01:10:17,476 --> 01:10:18,796
So, who are you going with?

537
01:10:22,996 --> 01:10:24,196
You see that bowl?

538
01:10:25,396 --> 01:10:29,476
The other day, they spent two hours
arguing over who got to keep the bowl

539
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:42,676
But the next day,
it's not the bloody bowl

540
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:45,196
It's the dining room
or the fucking dishes

541
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:48,996
They use any fucking thing
as an excuse to fight

542
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:12,996
Let's help them decide
who gets the bloody Chinese vase

543
01:11:25,356 --> 01:11:26,556
Ten points

544
01:11:27,156 --> 01:11:29,316
That's a souvenir
from their honeymoon

545
01:11:41,716 --> 01:11:42,716
Go!

546
01:11:46,196 --> 01:11:47,436
Good shot!

547
01:12:27,996 --> 01:12:28,956
What?

548
01:12:30,276 --> 01:12:31,236
Nothing

549
01:12:53,316 --> 01:12:56,156
You haven't asked me
what happened with the cake girl

550
01:12:56,836 --> 01:12:58,596
What happened with the cake girl?

551
01:12:59,436 --> 01:13:01,956
-l gave her a big kiss
-With tongues?

552
01:13:03,956 --> 01:13:05,156
Did you like it?

553
01:13:08,276 --> 01:13:10,956
-l liked the ear thing better
-Why?

554
01:13:12,156 --> 01:13:13,356
l don't know

555
01:13:16,716 --> 01:13:17,916
Close your eyes

556
01:13:21,636 --> 01:13:23,916
-And I’ll suck your ear
-No

557
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:28,116
So you can see how it feels

558
01:13:44,316 --> 01:13:46,796
<i>-Who is it?
-Telepizza, your friendly pizza</i>

559
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:48,716
Does this look extra thin?

560
01:13:49,196 --> 01:13:50,476
You are never satisfied

561
01:13:50,836 --> 01:13:53,276
All I want is for the Cokes to be...

562
01:13:53,556 --> 01:13:55,836
...the way they should be - cold!

563
01:14:11,796 --> 01:14:12,876
Hello?

564
01:14:13,356 --> 01:14:14,556
Who's calling?

565
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:16,476
Just a moment

566
01:14:21,116 --> 01:14:21,356
-It's the manager for you
-Right

567
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:23,956
Hello?

568
01:14:25,996 --> 01:14:28,476
Yes, I had a little problem
with a delivery

569
01:14:32,876 --> 01:14:34,316
Fuck off!

570
01:14:36,716 --> 01:14:37,916
Fire me

571
01:14:41,036 --> 01:14:42,476
I don't give a shit

572
01:14:43,556 --> 01:14:45,396
-Thank you, Flama
-You're welcome

573
01:15:16,956 --> 01:15:18,636
I’m going with my mum

574
01:15:23,756 --> 01:15:25,676
What are you going to do in Morelia?

575
01:15:30,316 --> 01:15:31,556
When are you leaving?

576
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:36,196
If the removal men come this week,
on Saturday...

577
01:15:45,356 --> 01:15:46,796
No more Sundays

578
01:15:54,236 --> 01:15:59,396
SUNDAY 8:00 PM

579
01:16:09,476 --> 01:16:11,516
Out of 385 sweets...

580
01:16:11,756 --> 01:16:13,556
...I didn't guess a single colour

581
01:16:13,796 --> 01:16:17,156
-Well, it's a game
-A bit cruel, isn't it?

582
01:16:52,516 --> 01:16:53,836
Congratulations

583
01:16:55,276 --> 01:16:56,356
What for?

584
01:16:57,556 --> 01:16:58,636
For your birthday

585
01:17:01,156 --> 01:17:02,116
Thanks

586
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:04,276
No, thank you

587
01:18:02,116 --> 01:18:03,676
Your shirt, knobhead

588
