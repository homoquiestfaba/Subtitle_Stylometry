1
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:19,976
Now a certain man was sick,
named Lazarus of Bethany.

2
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,631
The town of Mary and her
sister Martha.

3
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:25,982
It was that Mary which anointed
the Lord with ointment

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,636
and wiped his feet
with her hair.

5
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,899
who's brother Lazarus was sick.

6
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:34,730
Therefore his sister sent unto
Him saying, Lord, behold!

7
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:37,733
He whom Thou loveth is sick,

8
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,910
for he hath been dead four days.

9
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:45,480
Jesus sayeth unto her, Said I
not unto thee,

10
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,309
that if thou wouldst believe,
thou should see

11
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:49,658
the glory of God?

12
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:57,057
But, I think we all have an
understanding that the Bible is

13
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:00,843
a book of miracles.
It revolves around them.

14
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:08,068
In a way, miracles are what make
us follow this Book,

15
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,027
and dedicate our lives to
its teachings.

16
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:20,488
You look like a man who enjoys
a good story.

17
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:24,318
You ever hear the one about
Lazarus?

18
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,191
They say Jesus Christ performed
quite a few miracles

19
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:29,149
when He walked the earth.

20
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,588
People in my congregation
always took to debate about

21
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:34,763
the greatest miracle.

22
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,027
Everybody always had a
different answer.

23
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:44,164
For me though?
The greatest miracle?

24
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:50,126
The power of life over death.
Resurrection.

25
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,956
It's beautiful.

26
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:55,479
Turn it over.

27
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:01,181
Isn't there a rule against
carving into something holy?

28
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,185
You know, I was going to
mention that on Sunday.

29
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,970
Do believe I'll feel a might
bit conflicted standing in

30
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:09,189
front of all those people.

31
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:14,150
Taking James into town
next time I head in.

32
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,978
Saw something at the general
store he might like.

33
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,851
Papa! There's horses outside!

34
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:29,905
What's your business
in these parts, Isaiah?

35
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,342
Jakob and I are just
lookingfor a place

36
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:34,083
to rest for the evening,
Preacher.

37
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:36,216
Nothing more.

38
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:37,739
Evening ma'am.

39
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,011
You like it boy?

40
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:53,058
Tell ya, your pa let's us
have a place to stay for

41
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:56,018
the night, I might just let
you have a go with her tomo--

42
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,193
Isabelle. James.

43
00:03:58,499 --> 00:03:59,195
Go inside now.

44
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:16,168
If it's money you want
that's fine. But my fam

45
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:19,259
Relax.
We don't want your money.

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,045
And we ain't gonna do nothing
to that pretty wife of yours.

47
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,352
Unless your name is
Reynolds we ain't got--

48
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,441
What's that about Reynolds?

49
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,706
There are some things in life
that are better left unanswered.

50
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,709
The answer to that question
is one of those things.

51
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:43,065
Now we sitting here too much
longer, we might be needing

52
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,589
something more than
a place to rest.

53
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,600
You can shack up in the barn
for the evening.

54
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,995
Should be able to find some wood
in there for a fire.

55
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:01,910
l be in there in the morning to
tend to the cows.

56
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:04,304
We'll leave everything
just like we found it.

57
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,568
Least we can do for the
hospitality, Preacher.

58
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:49,958
Would you like to start us off?

59
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:55,485
Let's let James do it tonight.

60
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,487
I think he's old enough. How
bout you?

61
00:05:58,488 --> 00:05:59,707
Of course he is.

62
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,318
Well partner? What do you say?

63
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,424
We thank you Lord for the meal
you've laid out before us.

64
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:23,339
For the food you give us
everyday.

65
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,037
Thank you for the family
you've given us.

66
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,996
Thank you for my mama and
my papa.

67
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,521
Now what the hell do
you think?!

68
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:36,396
What in the name of Jesus
Goddamn Christ

69
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,659
was going through that piss
ant ol' mind

70
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:41,401
of the great philospher
Jakob Bannon?!

71
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:45,927
No guesses?

72
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,278
Shit. I ain't got one neither.

73
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,281
WHAT DO I PAY YOU FOR, JAKOB?!

74
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:55,371
To gossip with the local
town converter?

75
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,635
Isa, I don't think--

76
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:01,377
YOU'RE GODDAMNED RIGHT
YOU DON'T THINK!

77
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:05,207
I don't think it'll lead
to nothing.

78
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,689
What's that about Reynolds?

79
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:12,127
That's what he said before
God and all of us.

80
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,522
But ... you don't think
it'll lead to nothing.

81
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:18,786
Well, hell! Just consider
me assuaged,

82
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:23,791
if you don't think it'll
lead to nothing!

83
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:29,274
Isa, you're just about to push
me to a place you don't want

84
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:30,798
to see me go to.

85
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:38,980
You ain't never had the sand
to do nothing Jakob.

86
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:40,764
You never did!

87
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:42,549
You know that ain't
the truth.

88
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:45,813
Like hell it ain't.

89
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:48,772
If you hadn't let that
son of a bitch Reynolds

90
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,471
take a chunk out of you,
we'd be clear out of town

91
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:52,341
by now!

92
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:03,352
C'mon you yellow
son of a bitch!

93
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:10,098
Isaiah, you say one
more word and I will

94
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,012
put you in the dirt!

95
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,131
No sign of 'em?

96
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,612
Last we saw of them was
after church on Sunday.

97
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:16,093
Ain't hardly nobody's
been up this way anymore.

98
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,226
Not even traders.

99
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,142
Hey Marshal. Anyone checked
with ol' Doc Morris?

100
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:23,579
He might've sent them up
to Burnham's Hope to see

101
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,754
that big doctor up there.

102
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,764
Mornng Marshal. Happen to
have seen Isaiah Bannon around?

103
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:36,461
Problems with your flock?

104
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,290
There's always a few
wolves in the mix.

105
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:42,685
I don't know any wolves who
steal from the collection plate.

106
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,514
ll, Marshal, the Lord will judge
the saints and sinners alike.

107
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:46,994
I'll leave that up to him.

108
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:47,908
Fair enough.

109
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,606
You got a moment?

110
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:51,738
Sure.

111
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,481
That's a fine looking
horse you got there.

112
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:57,831
What's his name?

113
00:10:58,527 --> 00:10:59,441
Jack.

114
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,660
That's a good strong name.

115
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,925
Now you think Jack might
like some candy?

116
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:16,545
When was the last time you saw
Marcus or Talbicia Reynolds?

117
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,244
Guess that'd be Sunday. Saw
Talb and the little girl

118
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,158
at church.

119
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:22,638
Everything okay?

120
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:24,988
Well nobody's seen 'em since.

121
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,296
Which wouldn't be unusual
for most folks, but this is

122
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,211
Talbicia we're talking about.

123
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:33,127
You can set your clock by her
trips to town.

124
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,955
Especially since Marcus
has been gone.

125
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,608
I can go down to the
house and chec-

126
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:37,697
Already been there.

127
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,787
It's covered in blood.

128
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:42,310
Like a goddamn-

129
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,967
Like someone gutted a
pig in there.

130
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:48,969
Only no bodies.

131
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,884
Alive or otherwise.

132
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:53,408
When was this?

133
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,063
Well I was over there
this morning. Why?

134
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,067
Last night Jakob and Isaiah
came to our home.

135
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,550
Needed a place to stay.
I can't say I was happy

136
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:07,204
about it to begin with
but had I known-

137
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:08,815
No, I understand.

138
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,819
In any case, Jakob said
something about Reynolds.

139
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,385
Isaiah wanted to keep it
quiet.

140
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,910
Any guesses where they
might be heading?

141
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:19,913
Not a clue.
Maybe low country.

142
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:23,525
Maybe. Or on the
dodge in the outskirts.

143
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,049
They couldn't get very far with
Jakob being the way he was.

144
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:27,572
His arm was in bad way.

145
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:32,142
You really think they
could have done something

146
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:35,102
like this to the Reynolds?
What about the-

147
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,457
Well. Thanks for your
help, Preacher.

148
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:47,157
Now you take good care
of Jack, young man.

149
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,637
Break him in good!

150
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:02,782
Isabelle: What's the word
in town?

151
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,392
There's plenty of words.

152
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,568
None of them any good.

153
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,747
Edwards said Marcus and Talbicia
hadn't been seen in days.

154
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,488
What about the girl?

155
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:14,097
folding laundry.

156
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:17,318
No sign of her.

157
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,583
No sign of anyone.

158
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,152
Just the aftermath.

159
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,241
James asked about
her at all?

160
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:31,506
Not so far. I don't think he
knows anythings happened yet.

161
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:33,769
Good.

162
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:44,780
You had no idea what they'd
done. Couldn't have.

163
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:47,609
You were just doing what
you thought was right.

164
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:48,828
Yeah.

165
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:51,700
But I know what sort of men
they are.

166
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,791
You turning them men away?
As injured as Jackob was?

167
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:58,663
Would have made you no different
than those who walked before

168
00:13:58,707 --> 00:13:59,664
the Samaritan.

169
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,980
I'm sure glad you're better at
orating verses than you are at

170
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,199
folding laundry.

171
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,941
Otherwise we'd be in trouble.

172
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,639
Yeah, well, I sure am glad
you're better at

173
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,946
folding laundry than you are
at milking cows. Otherwise...

174
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,949
we'd be out of milk and wearing
wrinkly pants.

175
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,542
Keep pressure here. I'll
go get the doctor!

176
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,804
You have to take him
otherwise--

177
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,762
If I take him with me the ride
will kill him worse than

178
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:38,938
if he stays!

179
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,289
I swear I'll be back.

180
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,465
I swear he's going to be
alright.

181
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:03,266
You said he was attacked?

182
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,137
Woman: Yes Doctor Morris.

183
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:05,312
Liked to have taken
his hand clean

184
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:06,182
off if I hadn't been there.

185
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:07,488
Doctor Morris! It's James!

186
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:08,271
He's injured.

187
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:09,272
Where is he?
What happened?

188
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:09,969
Back at the house.

189
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:11,492
Please Doctor Morris ...

190
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,103
He was attacked! There's
blood all over him!

191
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,322
Please, you've got to help
him--you've got to help him!

192
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,934
I want you to keep this wrapped
up tight. Come back tomorrow.

193
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,632
If you notice anything different
about this--odor, discoloration

194
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:23,547
anything--you make sure you
come back--

195
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:24,244
Isaiah!

196
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:27,682
Isaiah!

197
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,388
Tend to my boy.

198
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:38,998
Yes sir.

199
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:41,261
Isaiah!

200
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:45,221
I've got
this under control!

201
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:45,961
Bannon!

202
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,528
I've got this under control!

203
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:49,530
BANNON!

204
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:51,097
Lower your rifle!
You don't want

205
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,880
to be doing this!

206
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,013
Look at me you
son of a bitch!

207
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,971
Edwards:Nooooo!

208
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:13,092
I was seventeen, in
Virginia. Waiting to enlist.

209
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:15,964
I was young and
the pay was good.

210
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,881
Day comes that I'm
going to do it. I'm going

211
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:22,057
to sign that paper,
and I get crippled ill.

212
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:27,106
But I'll be damned if I don't
drag myself down there anyway.

213
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:35,070
And I see this little wisp of
a lady, taking two goats

214
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,987
to market, just being
dragged all over creation.

215
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:45,559
Walked over to give her a
hand, and she spoke to me...

216
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:50,303
Suddenly the army didn't
seem all that appealing anymore.

217
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,658
Isabelle taught me my way.

218
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,576
Said I was too sick to
enlist, and ...

219
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,232
Anyway, my place wasn't
fighting men on the frontier.

220
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,321
It was guiding spirits through
the wilderness.

221
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:13,021
Never saw any of that coming.

222
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:20,985
Always been a fault of mine.
Not to see things coming.

223
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:27,688
You saw what he did!
You were standing right there!

224
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,820
Yes, I saw that.

225
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:31,648
There were children who
saw him gun a man down

226
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:32,649
right there on the street.

227
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:33,781
I understsand that.

228
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,349
Well then you also understand
that we've got rights!

229
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:37,350
Rights?

230
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:39,308
That's right, Marshal
Edwards. Rights!

231
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:42,093
And that man you have locked
up in there committed

232
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:44,487
an act of violence! An act that
goes against the entire

233
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,272
foundation of his life!

234
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,187
And we know he let let
them stay on his land,

235
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,145
not but a day ago,

236
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,321
right after they slaughtered
the Reynoldses,

237
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,323
and then he guns one of
them down in the street

238
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,326
right out in front of God
and all the rest of us watching!

239
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,156
And if we don't do something
about it, God in Heaven will!

240
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,464
That's right Marshal! And
I think given the circumstances

241
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,292
his town is owed some justice!

242
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:09,208
And we owe it to God
in Heaven above to--

243
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,344
We owe it to God?

244
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,565
Let me make this clear.

245
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:23,134
If so much as one man steps in
that building without me

246
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:26,268
granting it, the only person
you're gonna be owing

247
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:29,402
is the doctor for pulling
lead out of your gut.

248
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,756
Now I'm going to go out
and check on this man's wife.

249
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,325
And I'm going to find out
more about what happened.

250
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,241
And when I get back,

251
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,026
there better be a prisoner
in that cell.

252
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,205
Do I make myself clear?

253
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:04,959
Isabelle?

254
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,314
Oh God. What happened?

255
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:15,361
Isabelle?

256
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,452
Isabelle?

257
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,800
What's going on? Where's
James? Where's Isabelle?

258
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:20,600
Sorry, Preacher.

259
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:09,562
HELP!

260
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:13,348
Preacher!

261
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:17,221
Goddamnit if you're not
going to use that thing

262
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,484
then give it to me!

263
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:31,497
What about the town?
What about these people?

264
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,281
These people are
already dead.

265
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:44,945
All we could do
was run.

266
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:48,035
We rode all night and all day.

267
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:52,779
Highland Mills was Hell
reaching out for us.

268
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,049
Never really sat right with me,

269
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:03,964
what happened to
all those people.

270
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,609
Something on your
mind, Preacher?

271
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,487
Hell of a night.

272
00:24:56,451 --> 00:25:02,979
I can't remember the last time
I sat down and enjoyed it.

273
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:08,202
The sounds. The stars.

274
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:15,688
Hell, now I'm in bed by
sundown and up before sunrise.

275
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:20,040
Ain't I supposed to be getting
something out of that?

276
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:26,133
Are you healthy,
wealthy or wise?

277
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,051
Still wearing this
badge, ain't I?

278
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:36,056
Probably no.
On all counts.

279
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:53,769
You know there was a lynching
one night back in town when

280
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,510
I was deputy?

281
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,908
Night like this, I guess.

282
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,350
Negro boy. Fifteen. Sixteen.

283
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,577
People said he'd been caught
stealing.

284
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,754
Chicken here. Some lumber there.

285
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,584
Shit, he'd probably take a pie
off a window sill if you left

286
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:26,410
it there.

287
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:34,375
I believed there was no
reasoning with these people.

288
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:38,118
Nothing could be said.

289
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:46,779
I was too wrapped up in holding
a job. Too green.

290
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:51,566
Too weak to push my gut into
doing anything.

291
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:06,146
Highland Mills was already
dead, Preacher.

292
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:10,629
They were ready to be
your judge and jury without

293
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,587
a moment's hesitation.

294
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:16,983
Thought that would fix the
situation.

295
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:25,426
Nothing you or I could have done
short of killing them ourselves.

296
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:35,784
Puts a mighty hurt on the
brain when you realize what a

297
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:39,527
person will do when they
believe in something.

298
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,192
Get some rest.

299
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,630
We got a ways to go tomorrow.

300
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:21,281
I don't recall when it's been so
cool this time of year, do you?

301
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:30,290
My boy, James-my son.

302
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,468
This was always one of our
favorite times.

303
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:39,038
We'd go walking out in those
woods and just kinda...

304
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:42,563
marvel at everything.

305
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:48,482
I was always struck when I saw
a herd of deer grazing. Such...

306
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,746
graceful animals.

307
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:57,883
Always put a hurt in my head
when it came time to kill one,

308
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:00,929
but I guess God put animals in
Eden for a reason.

309
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,934
Don't supposed Adam could
eat dirt all day.

310
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:13,768
James was funny out in those
woods.

311
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,164
Wintertime, he always liked...

312
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,341
watching his breath
on the cold air.

313
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,170
He'd take these...

314
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:27,608
big breaths, and just keep
blowing out 'til he was blue

315
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:30,176
in the face, just so he could
see it rising.

316
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,705
Kids'll fascinate you like
that, you know?

317
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:42,971
Absolutely amazed by the
smallest little things.

318
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:48,977
That was his purpose.

319
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:57,159
Maybe God made kids that way

320
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:59,814
so we'd appreciate the
simple things.

321
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:05,559
We grow old.
We lose faith.

322
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,824
Not James.

323
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:26,841
How 'bout you?
Got any kids?

324
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:36,024
That's a nasty hurt
you got there.

325
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,680
Got a long way to
Burnham's Hope, but...

326
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:41,943
we could probably pack
you along,

327
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,076
might be a doc down there
who can patch you up.

328
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,046
What's your name?

329
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:12,408
Yeah...

330
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,632
I thought you might say that.

331
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:47,400
Preacher!

332
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,751
Jesus himself would
have been proud of that last

333
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:36,536
shot, Preacher.

334
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:44,152
Hell of a miracle right there.
They teach that kinda thing-

335
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:51,899
You planting something?

336
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:53,988
These men deserved
to be buried.

337
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:57,992
Now I have seen and heard
some crazy shit in my time,

338
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,691
up to and including a man of God
sliding across the ground,

339
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:04,738
grabbing a rifle and killing
two people with one shot.

340
00:34:05,347 --> 00:34:08,655
But I'll be goddamned if
I am going to bury four of

341
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:12,137
those cocksuckers who
tried to rip my face off.

342
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:13,573
Five.

343
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:15,749
Five?

344
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,839
There's another one just
up over the hill.

345
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,232
I delivered him a
while ago.

346
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,582
Oh, so that's what-

347
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,367
You mean while I was
here struggling with

348
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:28,066
this bastard here, you
were delivering a sermon

349
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:30,024
to one of them out
in the woods?

350
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:09,716
No matter how far we
ran, no matter where we hid,

351
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,457
there was no getting away.

352
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:16,418
Behind your brain you'd always
hear the moans, the flood of

353
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,464
suffering and pain.

354
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:30,432
I am the resurrection and
the life.

355
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:33,957
He that liveth and believeth in
Me, though he were dead,

356
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:36,003
yet shall he live.

357
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:39,963
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in Me

358
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,140
shall never die.

359
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,101
FIttin' words.

360
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,017
Course, the last person
to say those words

361
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,411
brought a man back
from the dead.

362
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:54,935
Sure you want to be
standing next to that

363
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:56,676
sumbitch while you're
speaking them?

364
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,939
Never knew you were
into the Word.

365
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,942
Got no practical use
for what's between

366
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:04,510
chapters one and five
hundred in that book of yours.

367
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,600
I just always enjoyed
a good story.

368
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,517
And a carpenter's son bringin'
a man back to life is

369
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:13,301
damn near top of the list.

370
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,007
Ever wonder why
I never went?

371
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:25,139
What's that?

372
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,141
To church.

373
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,448
Why I never went to church.

374
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:32,146
Just figured it had something
to do with my sermons.

375
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:36,542
You're a damn fine orator,
don't sell yourself short.

376
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:46,160
Well, some people just take
a while to find their way in.

377
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:48,554
Thought you'd come around at
some point or another.

378
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:51,165
Hope you're a man of
patience.

379
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:55,169
You ever do something
as a kid in school

380
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,738
something you weren't supposed
to do, and you got caught?

381
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:02,394
All the time. I was a
hellspawn as a kid.

382
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,353
You remember how the
teacher would call you out to

383
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:08,313
the head of the class, and
you'd have to stand there while

384
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:10,837
she whipped the fire out of your
ass in front of all the

385
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,925
other kids?

386
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:15,494
I seem to recollect
something like that, yes.

387
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:20,368
See, for me, it wasn't the
whippin' that hurt.

388
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,719
It was knowin' that I was
going to turn around and

389
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:26,244
do the same shit again, and
have to go through that

390
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,332
same beatin'.

391
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:32,206
That's what I couldn't take,
sitting there in that desk.

392
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,692
Figured sitting in that pew,
might as well be chaffing my

393
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:41,911
ass with the teacher's paddle

394
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:44,610
every day for the rest
of my life.

395
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:48,222
Besides, I got my own
temple.

396
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:02,628
Think this is
Revelation? Dead rising?

397
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:05,283
Entertain me on this.

398
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,589
Fairly certain
we're short a couple

399
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:10,462
horsemen, but I don't
know. Maybe it is.

400
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,943
So if it is, don't you think
it's mighty odd that you're

401
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:14,988
still here?

402
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:18,383
Did you just oversleep
the Rapture?

403
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,298
All I know is what we're
seeing out there ain't alive,

404
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,300
and it ain't exactly dead.

405
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,389
How do you reckon
they ain't dead?

406
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:27,305
I reckon that by the fact that
they still run around and eat

407
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,306
just like normal folks.

408
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:31,918
Only in this case, it's the
normal folks they like to eat.

409
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:35,661
They're stuck in a hell of their
own. They can't pass on.

410
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:37,619
They can't be judged.

411
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:39,839
By who? You?

412
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:41,841
By the one who'll judge
the quick and the dead.

413
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:45,540
And these things-these people-
are neither one of those.

414
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:48,848
Until we deliver them,
they can't be judged.

415
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:54,027
So that's why there's all
that whispering and prayin'?

416
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:58,727
Here I thought you was just
payin' your respects and sayin'

417
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:01,469
sweet nothings, but here
you are, a fine instrument

418
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:03,602
of God, delivering them!

419
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,648
Goddamnit we got
fast ones now!

420
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:53,652
Looks like one of our
boys was a farmer.

421
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:57,743
Thought you might like

I think you need
to see this.

435
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:08,716
I was going to say
the same thing.

436
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,901
Looks like the whole
congregation held out

437
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:20,946
here for a while.

438
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:22,600
Must've put up
quite a fight.

439
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:29,215
Well, thank Jesus
for that!

440
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:39,268
I shit you
not. Catfish Pete comes

441
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:43,229
bursting through those doors,
naked as a jaybird, all covered

442
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:46,275
in hay. He sets that bottle
of moonshine down

443
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:51,585
on the table and all he says is,
"I'm going to wait till whiskey

444
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,676
dries off," and passes out!

445
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,680
Got up and gone before I
was even able to wake up.

446
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:04,816
And I haven't seen that
bastard since!

447
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:10,169
I swear to you, in all
my born days...

448
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:17,916
I wonder what ever
happened to him?

449
00:44:30,493 --> 00:44:34,541
Same thing that will
happen to us, by and by.

450
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,458
What with us taking all
those guns and rags off

451
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:39,938
of 'em everyday.

452
00:44:39,981 --> 00:44:42,070
We're bound to have
the sickness in us.

453
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:44,377
No. You have to get
bit.

454
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:48,555
Oh, now what
makes you so sure?

455
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:52,646
We've tussled with them.
I've buried them.

456
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,300
Only ones I've known
turn are those bitten.

457
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:55,518
Like who?

458
00:45:09,054 --> 00:45:09,794
Present?

459
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:13,885
Anniversary of when
we first met.

460
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:16,975
That so?

461
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:22,850
Twelve years ago. Middle of
the street in Burnham's Hope.

462
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:32,599
Well, once we find a proper bed
and a fittin' plan of action,

463
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,516
I would very much like to see
that street where the hellion

464
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:37,822
became the preacher.

465
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:40,215
Well, anyway I

466
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,004
Hold on! It's alive.

467
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,362
Think you might be able
to make good use of a

468
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:57,929
stiff drink, Preacher.

469
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:00,192
I'm considering it.

470
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,149
Wake up Padre!

471
00:46:46,412 --> 00:46:47,500
Looks like
your kind!

472
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:07,346
Goddamnit do something!

473
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:10,828
Do something,
goddamnit!

474
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:12,264
Get out!

475
00:47:13,656 --> 00:47:14,005
NOW!

476
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:56,047
Didn't think
you had it in you.

477
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:00,051
I don't.

478
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:32,344
Three shots to feed
them maggots.

479
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,217
That's not enough to last
two hours out here

480
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:38,089
much less two weeks.

481
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:41,222
Last I recall,
two and three made five.

482
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:45,923
I like to save the
extra, just in case.

483
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:49,796
You really plan to do that?

484
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:52,407
I plan to do what
I have to do, Preacher.

485
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:56,324
Whether that means eating a
bullet so I don't turn into

486
00:48:56,368 --> 00:48:58,370
one them sons of bitches,

487
00:48:58,413 --> 00:49:00,372
or you ponying it up
and doing it for me.

488
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,813
And that's why we
only have three.

489
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:29,575
Easy! Easy!

490
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:36,147
Oh
God my boy!

491
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:39,280
What
happened?

492
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:41,935
Oh god-

493
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:44,938
They just attacked us.
They just...they didn't want

494
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,853
any money or food or
anything...they just...

495
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,160
bit him all over!
My boy...

496
00:49:57,951 --> 00:49:58,517
IAN!

497
00:49:59,344 --> 00:50:00,258
My boy!

498
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:02,695
Ian! Oh god, my boy!

499
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:08,309
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

500
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:09,006
No! Wait!

501
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:12,966
Why?!

502
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:14,881
Because it had
to be done!

503
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:16,187
It had to be done?!

504
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,015
He was a human being!

505
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:20,974
As soon as he saw his
son's blood on that tarp,

506
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,542
there was no difference between
him and what's out there!

507
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,980
He'd a killed both of
us if he had the chance!

508
00:50:29,852 --> 00:50:31,463
I did what I had to do.

509
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:35,902
What you had to do?

510
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:39,645
Just like the people
who lynched that boy?

511
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:41,125
Remember?

512
00:50:46,565 --> 00:50:48,567
I goddamn remember that
very well.

513
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:52,571
You remember those pieces
of shit in that barn?

514
00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:55,835
You remember burning
them all to Hell?

515
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:59,186
Think they had a pa who
would have done anything to

516
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,580
keep them from being killed?!

517
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:14,375
And I will pretty well
remember this as long

518
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:15,333
as I breathe.

519
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:19,380
But you can get down off
of your pulpit right now.

520
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:21,513
Cause I don't want none
of your sermons about

521
00:51:21,556 --> 00:51:23,515
what's right, and
what's wrong.

522
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:26,909
Because there ain't no
goddamn Bible verses,

523
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:28,824
and no goddamn sermon,

524
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:30,826
that's going to change
the fact that we're out

525
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,828
in the middle of
this goddamn woods

526
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:34,613
with a handful of shot

527
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:37,224
and hundreds of those
beings out there

528
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:40,271
who don't care about
right and wrong!

529
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,197
These people weathered the
storm.

530
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:40,113
They're not the
only ones.

531
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:42,159
We're going to meet
them soon.

532
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,775
How much further?

533
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,692
I don't know.

534
00:52:54,997 --> 00:52:59,176
But when we get there, I'll
have that drink with you.

busting a bronco.

Kick the fire and piss

you're almost docile.

549
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:43,454
Sounds about
like seminary.

Well, young shithead that

but none of the methods.

After you bring our

Your hospitality is

Well, thank you,
Mr. Beard.

566
00:56:27,035 --> 00:56:29,821
We do appreciate the
kindness, Mr. Beard.

567
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:31,126
If it wouldn't put you out,
we'd like to bring

568
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,562
our horses in.

569
00:56:33,912 --> 00:56:36,697
Well, I'm afraid reality
keeps check on our hospitality.

570
00:56:37,002 --> 00:56:40,048
We keep all livestock outside
these walls.

571
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:43,748
figured they'll make good
bait if those savagerous

572
00:56:44,096 --> 00:56:46,228
bastards ever show up
en masse.

573
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:49,014
Gives us some time
to reinforce the gates.

574
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:51,886
We've been finding it ain't
exactly the horses they

575
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,105
enjoy eating.

576
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,716
You'd be amazed at these
desperate times.

577
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:57,588
Even for those things.

578
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:12,211
So tell me. What a...what brings
a sinbuster and a lawman

579
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:14,909
way out here to
the edge of chaos?

580
00:57:15,562 --> 00:57:17,259
Just passing through.

581
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,611
We left Highland Mills just
before harvest.

582
00:57:21,394 --> 00:57:23,440
Trying to get to Burnham's
Hope, that's all.

583
00:57:24,658 --> 00:57:27,705
Just got a little
sidetracked, you could say.

584
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:30,577
We were hoping we might
rest here a day or two

585
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:32,187
if that wouldn't trouble
you or your men.

586
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,145
Ha!

587
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:35,277
I tell you what I'll do,
gentlemen.

588
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,281
I can give you a place to
sleep on.

589
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:43,634
Might even steal a warm meal if
you catch someone snoozing.

590
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:47,246
That's a whole hell of a lot
more than you're going to find

591
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:48,769
at Burnham's Hope.

592
00:57:50,902 --> 00:57:51,642
How's that?

593
00:57:52,947 --> 00:57:56,951
A week ago, I had ten scouts
under my command.

594
00:57:56,995 --> 00:57:58,562
Sent four of them up that way.

595
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:01,826
This week, I have six scouts.

596
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:05,830
You can scratch
Burnham's Hope off the map.

597
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,832
What about the rest
of your unit?

598
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:09,486
How many men do
you have here?

599
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:10,661
Unit?

600
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:19,496
We...we found some of the things
left behind very useful in

601
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:23,848
keeping a semblence of
order around here.

602
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:29,288
The uniform goes a
long way, don't it?

603
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:33,379
Left behind. You mean
ther army's gone?

604
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:36,121
What was left of
it is, at least.

605
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,519
Most of the unit

606
00:58:43,737 --> 00:58:46,044
been gone quite a spell
when we found this place.

607
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,177
Comanche hunt.

608
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:55,488
My money is on those
filthy cockholsters

609
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,403
for starting' this mess.

610
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:01,625
More to the point,
the army never came back.

611
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:05,019
When this whole shit
storm started,

612
00:59:05,063 --> 00:59:08,501
the fellas that were left
either ran into the woods

613
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,285
or stayed here and joined us.

614
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:11,243
Who's us?

615
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:18,555
Farmers. Miners. Stragglers.
Gamblers. Whores...anybody who,

616
00:59:19,947 --> 00:59:25,083
wanted a place to rest, and
came across our humble doorstep.

617
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,521
Even the occasional padre.

618
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:33,918
Before long, we had us a
homey little commune.

619
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:37,051
And you're the mayor.

620
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:42,404
The uniform surely does
go a long way.

621
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:28,146
Oh God.

622
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:30,496
Pray for me!

623
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:33,717
Please God, have mercy!

624
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:37,808
I'm sorry, Lord! I'm sorry
I did it to them!

625
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:42,247
I'm sorry I did
it to them!

626
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:48,340
Tell Him I'm sorry, father.
Tell Him I'm sorry!

627
01:00:49,515 --> 01:00:52,692
I know that He hears you.
I'm sure that whatever you did-

628
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,476
I killed them!

629
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:57,523
I killed my babies.

630
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:02,354
I knew if I didn't, they'd be
like them demons!

631
01:01:02,963 --> 01:01:06,184
I burnt them up!

632
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:10,318
I couldn't let them become
like them monsters.

633
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:14,540
Now Satan's Satan's
waiting for me.

634
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:18,196
Lucifer on a hot bed of coals
is waiting for me!

635
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:25,290
Father, oh God, Jesus
Christ...

636
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:29,163
Please pray for me.
Please pray for my babies!

637
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:31,035
I will.

638
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:34,038
I will.

639
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:56,060
Looks like you found
yourself a new friend.

640
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:02,022
Sounds crazy as crazy comes.

641
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:04,851
When you've witnessed what she
has, and done what she's done

642
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:06,853
I don't know if you can blame
her for the way she is.

643
01:02:07,549 --> 01:02:11,728
Says the gun totin' gospel
sharp who buries the bastard

644
01:02:11,771 --> 01:02:14,165
that just tried to eat his arm.

645
01:02:17,603 --> 01:02:19,431
We all deal in different ways.

646
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:24,262
Perhaps we'l all be on trial
in the big courtroom one day.

647
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:29,093
Well that's awful fascinating.

648
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:34,402
Gotta tack that on to your
sermon, next time you're out

649
01:02:34,446 --> 01:02:37,841
there passing the collection
plate with those things.

650
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:42,236
You're an odd bird, Preacher.

651
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:45,849
A good one, but odd.

652
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:25,802
Mornin' sunshine.

653
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,893
Almost enough to make a
man feel guilty for sleepin'-

654
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:31,329
Ten hours.

655
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,941
I was hoping
for thirty.

656
01:03:43,428 --> 01:03:44,168
Thoughts?

657
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:49,477
I give this place an hour.
Maybe two.

658
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:53,003
Then those things'll come
pouring over these walls.

659
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:11,978
You up for a walk?

660
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:44,228
Wait!

661
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:57,589
Looks like we
got ourselves a native, Joseph.

662
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:03,900
Mr. Beard seems to think you're
the mongrel fucks that started

663
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:04,596
all this.

664
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:06,990
Got anything to say about that?

665
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:12,430
I asked you a question,
blanket-ass!

666
01:05:13,692 --> 01:05:15,999
What do you have to
say about that?!

667
01:05:19,263 --> 01:05:20,699
What's that, featherhead?

668
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,049
They're right behind me.

669
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:28,881
RUNNERS!

670
01:05:38,978 --> 01:05:41,938
KILL ME! KILL ME PLEASE!

671
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:56,300
Please!

672
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,786
So the ship's speeding
towards the Union blockade.

673
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,614
Smoke rolling out of it

674
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:09,617
but no danger to us
and with a good wind

675
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:11,445
we were sailing.

676
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:14,274
Well, it was then the
captain says,

677
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,582
if we don't lose these
guns, Beard, we ain't gonna

678
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:20,324
make it through the
blockade!

679
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:26,808
So, I hands him my crowbar,
and he asks, what's this for?

680
01:06:28,288 --> 01:06:32,292
Alls I says is, if he throws
those guns overboard

681
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:33,772
he's gonna need it

682
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:38,516
to pry Stonewall's pistol right
out of his arse!.

683
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:47,177
You know, I must commend you

684
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,354
on the way you
handled yourselves

685
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:52,312
out in that wood
today, gentlemen.

686
01:06:53,661 --> 01:06:57,187
To save three people
and bring them safely back

687
01:06:57,622 --> 01:07:00,886
in the middle of a runner
attack is quite impressive.

688
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:06,196
God pulled us through,
Mr. Beard. He always has.

689
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:08,807
I believe he was with
those people today.

690
01:07:15,683 --> 01:07:17,163
Seems your friend

691
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:22,864
finds something about divine
help a touch humorous.

692
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,738
Somebody was looking out
for the two of you

693
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,566
when my soldiers
was butchered.

694
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:32,744
Got nothing to do with
no fluffy Jesus God.

695
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,878
And if those men were any
measure of the caliber of

696
01:07:36,922 --> 01:07:38,880
soldiers you got in these walls,

697
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:42,928
I'd say we're all but fucked
when those things get here.

698
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:47,498
Not always a good idea to
insult your host at dinner.

699
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:51,371
'Specially when he's joined by
some of those very same

700
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:53,547
soldiers you're speakin'
ill of.

701
01:07:54,548 --> 01:07:57,812
I've seen men hanging from
nooses with more integrity

702
01:07:57,856 --> 01:07:59,727
than I saw out
in those woods.

703
01:08:03,383 --> 01:08:05,559
I apologize.

704
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:11,130
On behalf of my men,
I accept your apo-

705
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:12,871
To the men hanging.

706
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:15,091
If you'll excuse me.

707
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:32,108
Your hospitality's mighty
appreciated, Mr. Beard,

708
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:34,284
but I do believe we'll
be taking our leave tomorrow.

709
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:38,070
Sure we can't persuade you
to stay a while longer?

710
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:43,771
It's rare that we get
guests of such...cordiality.

711
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:46,383
I think we've imposed enough.

712
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:02,616
If any man walk in the day,
he stumbleth not,

713
01:09:03,095 --> 01:09:04,836
because he seeth the light
of this world.

714
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,319
But if a man walk in the
night, he stumbleth,

715
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:11,408
because there is no
light in him.

716
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:15,151
That's what is says right
here in John 11.

717
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,159
I took my babies' light
away, I did.

718
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:29,817
Can you tell that to God?
Can you make him forgive me?

719
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:37,347
Nothing can change what
you did, ma'am.

720
01:09:39,523 --> 01:09:41,699
Nothing will ever bring
your children back.

721
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:46,182
Nothing will ever wash
you clean of blood.

722
01:09:48,227 --> 01:09:52,231
We've all seen and done things
today that we would have never

723
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:53,711
thought of yesterday.

724
01:09:55,365 --> 01:09:57,628
But you can still walk with the
light in you, whatever

725
01:09:57,671 --> 01:09:58,542
that light is.

726
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:08,378
I want to hear that from God.
I want Him to hear my voice.

727
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,476
What's your name, ma'am?

728
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:25,221
Don't seem fit to have one
after what I'd done.

729
01:10:30,878 --> 01:10:32,402
But you can
call me Legion.

730
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:36,406
No ma'am.

731
01:10:37,711 --> 01:10:39,800
You're just one person
looking for grace like

732
01:10:39,844 --> 01:10:41,498
the rest of us.

733
01:10:42,194 --> 01:10:46,024
That's what separates us
from them. We will never

734
01:10:46,067 --> 01:10:46,590
quit seeking grace.

735
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:50,420
They'll walk forever as
one mind, seeking nothing.

736
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,916
Do you really believe I can
make God hear any of us?

737
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,136
No.

738
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:38,702
Papa, look!

739
01:12:47,885 --> 01:12:48,538
James!

740
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,857
I see it.

741
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:47,423
Why don't you stay
a while, Preacher?

742
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:37,777
Please! No! Don't do this!

743
01:14:37,821 --> 01:14:39,300
Three of 'em come
in this morning.

744
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:41,346
Woman, the little girl
and the old man.

745
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:44,044
Looks like her husband's got
a mighty bad hurt on the leg.

746
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:45,132
Is it a bite?

747
01:14:45,176 --> 01:14:45,655
Dunno.

748
01:14:58,145 --> 01:15:01,975
Phineas, if these two want to
stay, tell them to find a use.

749
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,326
Otherwise, they're more'n
welcome to join him outside.

750
01:15:11,028 --> 01:15:14,858
Soon after we came here, a man
shows up at the gates.

751
01:15:16,337 --> 01:15:17,600
Crazy for the Lord.

752
01:15:19,863 --> 01:15:21,386
One of yer fellas.

753
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:27,348
And he had a...bloodied arm.

754
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:30,526
Thought nothing of it. Patched
him up, put him to work.

755
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:38,055
Week later, the whole goddamn
fort wakes up to this man,

756
01:15:38,316 --> 01:15:43,539
wailing about how we're all
sinners needing to be cleansed.

757
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,891
We're all due judgement from
God Almighty Hisself.

758
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:53,418
Ordinarily, I got no problem
with these proclomations.

759
01:15:54,811 --> 01:15:57,161
Except that this old croaker
had taken it upon himself

760
01:15:57,204 --> 01:16:03,167
to lead two of those wretches,
in through the rear gate.

761
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:06,562
Lost a good man that night.

762
01:16:11,262 --> 01:16:17,268
Never did learn if the arm
was a bite or a scratch.

763
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:22,403
Did learn that either way
you turn it,

764
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:26,538
a bullet clears things
up, mighty quick.

765
01:16:27,931 --> 01:16:28,845
Gentlemen.

766
01:16:58,048 --> 01:16:59,310
Ever afraid of what
you're becoming?

767
01:16:59,832 --> 01:17:00,572
What's that?

768
01:17:01,878 --> 01:17:03,749
Is it too natural to
put a bullet in one

769
01:17:03,793 --> 01:17:05,795
of those things and not
worry about who they are,

770
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:06,796
or who they were?

771
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,885
You ain't Beard,
Preacher.

772
01:17:09,581 --> 01:17:11,322
Samuel Beard became
what he is.

773
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:12,802
He wasn't made
that way.

774
01:17:20,113 --> 01:17:22,942
This have anything to do
with that bastard congregation

775
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:24,335
you blew straight to Hell?

776
01:17:28,121 --> 01:17:30,428
Even when the
world turns to shit,

777
01:17:30,863 --> 01:17:34,650
folks will still maintain
some shade of a normal life.

778
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:39,002
These folks here still dance.
Those folks worshipped.

779
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:41,657
What for?

780
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:45,138
Shelter from the storm.

781
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:47,010
Indeed.

782
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:51,667
But they got no clue as to
the formation of that storm.

783
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:54,365
Where it came from,
where it ends.

784
01:17:55,366 --> 01:17:59,675
One day the storm takes up
and suddenly it's us out there.

785
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,201
Walking worm food, scratching
at the walls outside.

786
01:18:07,117 --> 01:18:09,772
Ever since we left Highland
Mills, you've been dancing

787
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:11,556
just like them.

788
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:15,168
Trying to do what's normal
in a time when there's

789
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:16,387
no such thing.

790
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:21,697
I don't understand what goes
through that mind of yours

791
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,220
when you're burying one.

792
01:18:24,003 --> 01:18:26,571
To be truthful, I think you're
a goddamn loon.

793
01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:28,704
No offense to God.

794
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:30,183
Or loons.

795
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:34,448
But I do understand you're
not a man who'd cut someone

796
01:18:34,492 --> 01:18:35,972
down in cold blood.

797
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:41,064
You may have a few wheels
loose on the wagon,

798
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:42,979
but you ain't a murderer.

799
01:18:47,592 --> 01:18:49,899
It's the Beards of the world
who worry me.

800
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:51,988
Samuel Beard's only a man.

801
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:55,165
When his time comes, he will
be cut down by powers bigger

802
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,340
than any of us.

803
01:18:57,428 --> 01:18:58,734
If that's any comfort
to you.

804
01:18:59,256 --> 01:19:00,605
None whatsoever.

805
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:06,002
Mr. Beard!
Mr. Beard!

806
01:19:09,092 --> 01:19:11,616
Mr. Beard! Where's Beard?!

807
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,581
Mr. Beard! You gotta pull
everyone out now!

808
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,670
Now!

809
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:23,759
I spotted them out there!

810
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:26,065
We find those
damn things all the time.

811
01:19:27,327 --> 01:19:27,371
What in the holly hell has
gotten into you-

812
01:19:28,111 --> 01:19:28,154
Scores of 'em!

813
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:30,113
Hundred. Maybe double that!

814
01:19:32,724 --> 01:19:33,551
Which way're they coming?

815
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,032
This way sir. Following
the gathering trails.

816
01:19:39,557 --> 01:19:41,777
I want everyone inside the gate
within the next half hour.

817
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:44,301
Have them bring all
the supplies and

818
01:19:44,954 --> 01:19:46,782
firewood that they can.
Leave the rest.

819
01:19:47,608 --> 01:19:49,697
Set up a standard rotation
in those towers

820
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:52,483
and along the perimeter.
Two hours on, two hours off.

821
01:19:56,922 --> 01:20:02,275
I want ever pitchfork, every
shovel and knife in this yard

822
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:03,320
immediately.

823
01:20:04,887 --> 01:20:09,108
All women and children are
pected to fight directly, or to

824
01:20:09,152 --> 01:20:12,938
supply the tower positions with
amunition and fresh supplies.

825
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,333
I want everyone armed with some
form of weapon.

826
01:20:16,594 --> 01:20:18,814
Everyone fights, everyone lives.

827
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:22,426
Abandon your post, or fail to do
your job,

828
01:20:22,469 --> 01:20:25,516
and I will end you myself.

829
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:27,997
How were they comin'?

830
01:20:30,608 --> 01:20:32,349
Headin' in through the forest,
sir. D'rectly to us.

831
01:20:33,045 --> 01:20:34,307
I'd say about
two hours out.

832
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:37,920
As soon as those farmers
are in, close the gates.

833
01:20:38,311 --> 01:20:38,834
No one in.

834
01:20:39,878 --> 01:20:40,618
No one out.

835
01:20:42,141 --> 01:20:43,839
Mr. Beard, we've still got
three scouts out there, sir.

836
01:20:44,491 --> 01:20:45,362
What about them?

837
01:20:50,193 --> 01:20:51,498
Leavin' so soon?

838
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:53,849
You want to stay around
and meet Old Scratch,

839
01:20:53,892 --> 01:20:55,198
we won't be getting in
your way.

840
01:20:55,676 --> 01:20:57,374
We figured we got a better
chance on the move.

841
01:20:57,635 --> 01:20:59,593
If we leave now-all of
us-we can put five miles

842
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:00,943
between us and them
by daybreak.

843
01:21:00,986 --> 01:21:03,510
Under my orders, no man
is to leave his post

844
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:05,599
under penalty of death
by firing squad.

845
01:21:05,643 --> 01:21:07,210
And that includes
the two of you!

846
01:21:07,732 --> 01:21:10,169
What gives you the right to
condemn these people to death?!

847
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,956
Got 'em! Three hundred yards!

848
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,059
What is it, Morgan?

849
01:21:30,581 --> 01:21:31,408
Only a few of 'em.

850
01:21:33,105 --> 01:21:34,063
Think the kid was just scared
shitless when he said hundreds?

851
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:37,066
That's all it takes to
knock in a door.

852
01:21:46,945 --> 01:21:49,034
We got about a dozen
stragglers out there.

853
01:21:49,078 --> 01:21:50,818
Some of them look to be
carrying some provisions

854
01:21:50,862 --> 01:21:52,385
we might be able to use.

855
01:21:52,777 --> 01:21:54,953
Now since you two
held your own

856
01:21:54,997 --> 01:21:58,217
pretty well in the woods,
you're going to take three

857
01:21:58,261 --> 01:22:01,090
men out there and bring
us back what we need.

858
01:22:01,525 --> 01:22:04,310
You mean to tell me that a
few rifles and some dirty shot

859
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:06,791
is worth more than the lives
of three of your men?

860
01:22:07,444 --> 01:22:08,097
You really are a
worthless cun-

861
01:22:09,663 --> 01:22:11,448
I mean to say that I want those
provisions in this yard

862
01:22:12,623 --> 01:22:14,799
in a half hour with as few
shots fired as possible.

863
01:22:15,278 --> 01:22:16,975
Now shall I further
clarify my point,

864
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:19,717
or is it pretty mother
fucking clear?!

865
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,983
Looks like we got about
a dozen roamers.

866
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:26,245
Beggin' your pardon?

867
01:22:27,812 --> 01:22:29,596
Now see, these devil
bastards come in all sorts of

868
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,641
flavors, Marshal.

869
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,382
Carpetheads.

870
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:33,600
Chinks.

871
01:22:33,644 --> 01:22:35,298
Stumblers. Runners.

872
01:22:35,646 --> 01:22:38,518
Roamers-like these is-
and lingerers.

873
01:22:38,562 --> 01:22:40,042
Lingerers are
the damndest.

874
01:22:40,303 --> 01:22:42,783
They just stick to where they
was when they fell out.

875
01:22:43,262 --> 01:22:44,916
We've come
across some of them.

876
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,612
I reckon.

877
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,441
Eventually something inside
a lingerer drives 'im away

878
01:22:48,485 --> 01:22:50,052
from the place where
he dropped off.

879
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:53,359
And then they's roamers.
Like we got here.

880
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:54,621
Ain't that right, Thomas?

881
01:22:54,665 --> 01:22:55,840
Yes sir, it is.

882
01:22:57,755 --> 01:22:59,322
I think is our
chance to exit.

883
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,497
Two problems there.

884
01:23:01,933 --> 01:23:02,760
We're without hooves and
I'm not leaving these people.

885
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:49,807
Thomas!

886
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:52,853
It's not a bite. Sumbitch
just scratched me is all.

887
01:23:52,897 --> 01:23:54,116
He ain't gonna
let you back in!

888
01:23:54,464 --> 01:23:55,465
Goddamnit it's just a
scratch!

889
01:23:57,162 --> 01:23:59,034
I can still shoot a gun! I can
still kill these cocksuckers!

890
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:00,861
This don't gotta be anyway
but quick, Thom-

891
01:24:01,514 --> 01:24:02,820
Goddamn you both!

892
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:05,040
I'm thinking now
or never, padre.

893
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:06,650
I'm thinking Beard's had a
sharpshooter trained on us

894
01:24:06,693 --> 01:24:07,651
since we left his gates.

895
01:24:10,219 --> 01:24:12,743
Like the man said, no one's
to abandon his post.

896
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:27,062
About a month.

897
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:28,933
What's that sir?

898
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,023
He'd been here about
a month.

899
01:24:33,024 --> 01:24:33,590
Tommy?

900
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:36,071
Thomas. That's it.

901
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:40,075
Came in here about a week
after I did.

902
01:24:40,858 --> 01:24:41,685
Him and his sister.

903
01:24:43,426 --> 01:24:44,775
Jillian, right?

904
01:24:45,863 --> 01:24:46,559
I reckon.

905
01:24:47,908 --> 01:24:51,434
I can still smell that soup
she used to make.

906
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:54,567
Wouldn't have thought a man
could feast so on naught but

907
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:56,265
potatoes and berries.

908
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:00,878
Beautiful woman.

909
01:25:09,278 --> 01:25:10,061
Morgan...

910
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:13,195
If any of the others
go that way,

911
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:16,111
shoot them.

912
01:25:21,812 --> 01:25:23,814
You boys haven't
seen the full show yet.

913
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:26,295
Killin's only half the fun.

914
01:25:27,165 --> 01:25:29,472
This is where the good
stuff begins.

915
01:25:37,175 --> 01:25:39,438
That must've been their
scouting party.

916
01:25:44,965 --> 01:25:48,534
You're better off
saving that shot for yourself

917
01:25:48,578 --> 01:25:50,449
you stupid son of a bitch!

918
01:26:18,477 --> 01:26:20,436
Father please protect
us inside these walls this

919
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:22,264
evening. Give us the clarity
to make the right decisions

920
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,309
and to protect one another
in dark times.

921
01:26:24,657 --> 01:26:26,224
Guide the souls oustide those
gates so that they may find

922
01:26:26,268 --> 01:26:27,791
Your glory in eternal Heaven.

923
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,489
You read to leave, or are
you just going to be

924
01:26:30,533 --> 01:26:31,534
chatting all night?

925
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:33,362
Amen.

926
01:26:34,798 --> 01:26:36,016
Don't imagine Beard's going
to let those sharpshooters

927
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:37,192
on a piss break.

928
01:26:38,758 --> 01:26:40,151
I think Beard and his shooters
are going to have a whole

929
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,935
hell of a lot more to worry
about than the two of us

930
01:26:41,979 --> 01:26:42,849
in a few minutes.

931
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:45,678
Even if we could get past
the gate, we've still got

932
01:26:45,722 --> 01:26:47,680
dozens of those things out
there waiting for us.

933
01:26:48,072 --> 01:26:50,117
Well you got your shovel
right? Should be a goddamn

934
01:26:50,161 --> 01:26:53,643
barn dance for you. C'mon,
let's take a walk.

935
01:26:54,252 --> 01:26:56,820
Battle commotion through scene.]

936
01:26:57,081 --> 01:26:58,865
That scout mentioned that
they're coming in through

937
01:26:58,909 --> 01:27:00,302
the main outlets in
the woods.

938
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:02,304
All those outlets lead to
that front gate.

939
01:27:02,565 --> 01:27:05,176
Which happens to be where Beard
has most of his men waiting.

940
01:27:05,742 --> 01:27:08,005
Now anybody not there now will
be when those fuckers hit

941
01:27:08,048 --> 01:27:11,356
the wall. Which means you're
going to head to that gate.

942
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,880
Now in about two minutes
you're going to have your

943
01:27:13,924 --> 01:27:15,186
moment to get through there.

944
01:27:16,622 --> 01:27:18,581
And what happens to everyone
else? What happens to you?

945
01:27:18,929 --> 01:27:20,757
Someone's gotta distract
Beard's men.

946
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:24,717
Once you get through there, you
get to the horses and you ride.

947
01:27:25,196 --> 01:27:26,545
Don't stop.

948
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:30,419
Ride until you get about a half
days out.

949
01:27:30,854 --> 01:27:32,247
That should give you
enough tme.

950
01:27:33,813 --> 01:27:35,119
We can funnel everyone through
the rear gate and you're right

951
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:36,207
behind us. Beard doesn't have
enough bullets for-

952
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,121
Hey, Mr. Beard says-

953
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,474
Now. If you were to go
on main road,

954
01:27:42,518 --> 01:27:44,868
it'd take you a day to
get to the crossing.

955
01:27:44,911 --> 01:27:46,217
I'd stay in the sticks.

956
01:27:46,783 --> 01:27:49,046
Put you going a day
or two more, but

957
01:27:49,089 --> 01:27:51,135
maybe you'll avoid the
bulk of them cocksuckers.

958
01:27:54,312 --> 01:27:55,226
I told you.

959
01:27:56,619 --> 01:27:58,229
I'm not leaving these people
and I'm not leaving you.

960
01:27:58,969 --> 01:27:59,622
You don't have to do th-

961
01:28:01,014 --> 01:28:02,146
Oh there's plenty of things I
didn't have to do!

962
01:28:02,494 --> 01:28:04,061
Probably shouldn't
have, either.

963
01:28:05,454 --> 01:28:06,716
But this ain't one of them.

964
01:28:10,546 --> 01:28:11,286
You don't have it in you.

965
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,810
Like hell I don't.

966
01:28:14,506 --> 01:28:17,030
When those things get here,
you're either dead or on your

967
01:28:17,074 --> 01:28:18,293
way to becoming
one of them!

968
01:28:18,989 --> 01:28:21,905
You better be goddamned
sure I don't want to see

969
01:28:22,253 --> 01:28:23,341
that happen!

970
01:28:23,385 --> 01:28:26,301
Now you get to
Burnham's Hope!

971
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:36,006
When you get there
you go to my church.

972
01:28:38,748 --> 01:28:40,184
The first one's on me.

973
01:28:52,414 --> 01:28:54,633
EDWARDS!

974
01:28:56,679 --> 01:28:58,202
EDWARDS!

975
01:29:06,863 --> 01:29:07,864
EDWARDS!

976
01:29:09,822 --> 01:29:11,346
EDWARDS!

977
01:29:12,042 --> 01:29:13,348
Watch
those close to the wall!

978
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:34,194
Guns have never been
a problem here.

979
01:29:35,239 --> 01:29:39,374
Weapons. Provisions. People.

980
01:29:39,678 --> 01:29:42,638
All stocks in trade we've
never been short on.

981
01:29:43,987 --> 01:29:46,555
Fire a bullet, reload.

982
01:29:48,078 --> 01:29:52,822
Lose a man, a whole family
shows up at the gates.

983
01:29:55,868 --> 01:29:57,392
The wheels keep turning.

984
01:29:59,437 --> 01:30:04,660
Life...goes on in circles.

985
01:30:06,836 --> 01:30:08,577
Because you love the people,

986
01:30:09,186 --> 01:30:16,715
and the sanctity within these
walls, you make sacrifices.

987
01:30:20,502 --> 01:30:21,677
I've made them.

988
01:30:23,113 --> 01:30:25,768
I've had them made in
my name.

989
01:30:27,291 --> 01:30:28,945
Not proud of it.

990
01:30:32,252 --> 01:30:36,082
Sacrifice keeps the circle in
motion.

991
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:40,522
Allows the sanctity to exist.

992
01:30:43,307 --> 01:30:47,050
Sacrifice ain't the problem.

993
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,446
Problem ain't outside
these walls.

994
01:30:53,578 --> 01:30:56,799
Problem ain't inside
the walls.

995
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:02,326
It's here.

996
01:31:04,328 --> 01:31:05,938
A man starts to forget.

997
01:31:07,505 --> 01:31:15,426
Names. Faces. Hopes.

998
01:31:15,861 --> 01:31:18,081
That's when the ground
starts to fall away.

999
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:23,826
Order never forgets.

1000
01:31:24,522 --> 01:31:27,482
You make a man real when
you give him a purpose.

1001
01:31:27,525 --> 01:31:31,007
You tell him what to do. When
to walk out those gates.

1002
01:31:31,268 --> 01:31:35,098
When to piss. When to sleep.

1003
01:31:35,707 --> 01:31:40,495
Reward him when he comes
safely home. Smite him...

1004
01:31:40,756 --> 01:31:42,584
...when he steals.

1005
01:31:42,932 --> 01:31:46,501
Our enemies made
a Hell from chaos.

1006
01:31:49,025 --> 01:31:53,769
We made a home
from order.

1007
01:31:56,206 --> 01:31:59,514
Now, I thought my orders were
clear tonight.

1008
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:03,692
All men on the line,
Marshal Edwards.

1009
01:32:04,214 --> 01:32:07,783
Too nice a night to be
takin' orders, Mr. Beard.

1010
01:32:27,977 --> 01:32:29,413
If this was the army...

1011
01:32:29,761 --> 01:32:34,418
...I'd say your nice night
just cost you your life-

1012
01:33:07,364 --> 01:33:10,367
Last time I remember
a night this nice,

1013
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:13,588
was almost twenty years
ago.

1014
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:16,416
There was this negro boy.

1015
01:33:18,636 --> 01:33:21,291
Fifteen. Sixteen years old.

1016
01:33:21,813 --> 01:33:25,338
Supposedly got caught stealin'
a chicken and some lumber

1017
01:33:25,382 --> 01:33:26,775
from a couple of farmers.

1018
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:31,649
And while everyone was so
damned concerned about sticks

1019
01:33:31,693 --> 01:33:35,914
and birds, all I could think
about was his little brother

1020
01:33:35,958 --> 01:33:38,264
screaming wildfire.

1021
01:33:39,526 --> 01:33:43,705
Couldn't have been five years
old, watching them drag his

1022
01:33:43,748 --> 01:33:45,141
brother to the rope.

1023
01:33:46,664 --> 01:33:48,405
We strung him up that night.

1024
01:33:49,928 --> 01:33:54,106
Said all number of unholy
things to him while he was

1025
01:33:54,411 --> 01:33:56,108
kickin' and screaming.

1026
01:34:11,776 --> 01:34:15,258
Don't know if he did it,
really. Never did.

1027
01:34:16,694 --> 01:34:19,915
But I do know he deserved
a bit more justice than he

1028
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:21,351
got that night.

1029
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:25,790
I know his little brother
shoulda never have seen

1030
01:34:25,834 --> 01:34:27,139
what he saw.

1031
01:34:29,446 --> 01:34:32,754
Just like I know that little
girl deserved more than to

1032
01:34:32,797 --> 01:34:38,150
watch her pa rot outside
these gates.

1033
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:51,642
And I know...

1034
01:34:53,165 --> 01:34:57,300
...there's no room in Heaven or
Hell for monsters like us.

1035
01:35:02,566 --> 01:35:04,046
Hell of a nice night.

1036
01:35:06,352 --> 01:35:07,789
Get the gates!

1037
01:35:09,225 --> 01:35:10,487
I need more ammo!

1038
01:35:27,243 --> 01:35:29,158
They're banging in the gates!

I know that what you done
was what you had to do.

1059
01:39:02,588 --> 01:39:05,026
The alternative coulda been
much worse in these times.

1060
01:39:07,115 --> 01:39:09,073
Lord knows I've seen and done
things that at any other time

1061
01:39:09,117 --> 01:39:12,120
I'd have thrown myself before
the cross and begged for mercy.

1062
01:39:14,644 --> 01:39:15,645
That doesn't matter.

1063
01:39:17,386 --> 01:39:20,563
What matters is you felt it
was what you had to do

1064
01:39:20,606 --> 01:39:23,566
at that time. At
that moment.

1065
01:39:29,093 --> 01:39:30,790
A friend of mine once said,

1066
01:39:31,791 --> 01:39:33,750
it puts a mighty hurt on the
brain when you realize what

1067
01:39:33,793 --> 01:39:35,926
a person will do when they
believe in something.

1068
01:39:38,842 --> 01:39:39,756
So.

1069
01:39:41,497 --> 01:39:45,675
If you believed that's what you
had to do, I understand.

1070
01:39:48,112 --> 01:39:50,593
And I know He's out there,
waiting, with open arms.

1071
01:40:28,152 --> 01:40:30,633
I've seen died up gamblers spend
less time in there than that.

1072
01:40:31,068 --> 01:40:32,374
Just waiting for someone.

1073
01:40:33,636 --> 01:40:34,376
No show?

1074
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,030
He's out there.

1075
01:40:37,205 --> 01:40:38,162
Where the wicked cease
from turmoil,

1076
01:40:38,206 --> 01:40:39,990
and the weary are at rest.

1077
01:40:40,686 --> 01:40:42,123
Too late to catch a train there?

1078
01:40:42,384 --> 01:40:44,038
About thirty more approaching
from the north.

1079
01:40:46,301 --> 01:40:47,215
What'd you want to do,
Preach?

1080
01:40:49,913 --> 01:40:51,654
You don't mind getting
a little dirty, do you?

1081
01:40:52,263 --> 01:40:54,091
If that were coming from any
other man, I'd say that sounds

1082
01:40:54,135 --> 01:40:55,223
like a proposition.

1083
01:40:56,093 --> 01:40:57,225
But if you were any other man,

1084
01:40:58,704 --> 01:41:00,576
I doubt we'd be digging
holes all night now, would we?

them to murder that boy,

1086
01:41:14,198 --> 01:41:15,895
is the thing that keeps
you going.

1087
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:19,943
Belief.

1088
01:41:21,771 --> 01:41:24,904
Belief pushing you to a point
you never thought possible.

1089
01:41:26,515 --> 01:41:28,430
We all got belief in something.

1090
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:31,737
You've got the Man. I've got
the Law.

1091
01:41:33,217 --> 01:41:34,914
But it's there for
all of us.

1092
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:40,442
You just better hope what
you believe in is worth it.

1093
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:43,445
Worth what you're willing
to do.

1094

What you're willing
to lose.

1095
