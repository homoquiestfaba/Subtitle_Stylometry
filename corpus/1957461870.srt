00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,562
Dear Santa Killer,

5
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:31,934
I don't know why you're
such a mean person

6
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:33,601
but you should be nicer.

7
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,205
I know Santa is gonna bring
you coal for Christmas

8
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:39,075
but please don't kill him

9
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:41,843
because I won't get
my bike if you do.

10
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:44,213
I was gonna ask him
for a cell phone

11
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:47,749
but I decided to ask him to
bring you friends instead

12
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:50,152
because then maybe you
wouldn't be so mean.

13
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:51,720
Merry Christmas.

14
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:53,089
Can you believe this?

15
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:54,290
It's just a kid.

16
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,026
It's not just a kid babe.

17
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:58,793
Yesterday it was the mail man

18
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,296
and the old lady
across the street.

19
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,897
I didn't even go outside.

20
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:03,832
It'll pass, okay?

21
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:06,701
People have a lot more
things to worry about today.

22
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,971
They don't know what
they're talking about.

23
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:12,074
They think that I hate
Christmas and I don't,

24
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,976
they think I hate
that guy and I don't.

25
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,777
He's just a random street guy.

26
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,214
They just believe something,

27
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:19,781
they believe whatever they hear.

28
00:02:19,814 --> 00:02:20,615
They're ignorant.

29
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:21,616
I get it, I get it.

30
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:23,785
But look, it'll pass, okay?

31
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,021
I promise.

32
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:27,555
Besides we have a lot
more to worry about.

33
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,258
Did you get the Advent wreath?

34
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,193
You mean the candle thingy?

35
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:32,361
Yes.

36
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:34,096
But please don't call it
that in front of my parents.

37
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,965
I think it's upstairs.

38
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,733
Do you think they'll like me?

39
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,803
Of course they will.

40
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:44,306
They didn't see
the video, did they?

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,108
I don't need them bringing
that up at dinner.

42
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:48,077
My mom cannot know about that.

43
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,247
I didn't show it to them or
anyone else for that matter.

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,915
Listen, everything's
gonna be okay.

45
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:54,649
They're gonna get
here, we'll have fun,

46
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:56,651
it will be a fun time, okay?

47
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:57,685
I hope so.

48
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:00,222
They're just
our parents Holly.

49
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,924
They don't control
our lives anymore.

50
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,228
By the way, what is this?

51
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:09,999
Why do you have this?

52
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:11,267
It's a decoration.

53
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,835
Babe, I've bought all
of these decorations.

54
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:14,769
Remember I told you.

55
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,671
No, this is not decoration.

56
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:20,242
This is a toy that's meant
to make sure kids behave.

57
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,776
But my parents used to put
this thing out all the time.

58
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,613
Babe, it's just
a toy elf, okay?

59
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:28,683
Why don't you leave the
decorating to me, okay?

60
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:29,651
You sure you
don't need any help?

61
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:31,253
No, I don't.

62
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:32,221
Go get the food.

63
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,923
It should be almost ready.

64
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:36,092
Also, I need to take this down.

65
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,093
Is that okay?

66
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:38,027
Why?

67
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,261
Babe, the decorations?

68
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:42,597
I told you my mom is,
it needs to be perfect.

69
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,201
Okay, fine.

70
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:46,135
Can you at least
call the plumber

71
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,702
and make sure they
come fix the bathroom?

72
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:49,038
Oh, yeah.

73
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:49,972
Yeah, okay.

74
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,376
All right.

75
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,311
I'm off.

76
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,345
I love you.

No, no, no, no,
don't bring the cat.

98

Why would you bring the cat?

99

doesn't know it's Christmas.

about this problem.

185
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,257
[paper rustling]

186
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:39,828
Yeah, I got the...

187
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,596
The image.

188
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,298
[Eve] Oh, don't you love it?

189
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,234
It's supposed to be a city.

190
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:53,275
I just started taking online
classes in graphic design.

191
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:55,978
Oh, it's that one?

192
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:01,483
It's a late engagement gift.

193
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:02,317
Yeah, mom.

194
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,552
It's great.

195
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:05,754
I put it up in my
office already.

196
00:14:06,923 --> 00:14:09,658
One of my clients
said that he loved it.

197
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:10,993
[Eve] A man of taste.

198
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:18,935
Lemme let you go honey.

199
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,937
Your father pulled
his back out again

200
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,371
and I need to help
him with the bag.

201
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,473
We'll be there soon.

202
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:25,307
Love you.

203
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,942
[Eve] Bye.

204
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:27,009
Bye.

205
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,811
[bell ringing]

206
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:32,380
[footsteps]

207
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:49,664
What a thief!

208
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:06,782
[bell ringing]

209
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:33,976
Hi.

210
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:35,912
Hi.

211
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:39,882
what's your name?

212
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,986
What?

213
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,987
What's your name?

214
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:46,055
I'm Holly.

215
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:48,690
Jesús.

216
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:52,929
Merry Christmas.

217
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:55,497
Merry Christmas.

218
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,871
Well, Jesús, I know
you've been out here all day

219
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:05,107
and I was just....

220
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:10,880
Would you like some hot
chocolate or some water?

221
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:12,114
I have cookies too.

222
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:17,452
Excuse me?

223
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:20,755
[slow music]

224
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,605
Did you make these?

225
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:38,007
Yeah, I did.

226
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,808
They're really good.

227
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:40,842
Thank you.

228
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,646
And did you do
all of this too?

229
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,513
Yeah.

230
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,019
I have family coming
over later so I just,

231
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,720
I wanted it to look nice.

232
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,456
Oh, that's exciting.

233
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:55,091
Yeah.

234
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:56,391
When are they coming?

235
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,961
Soon.

236
00:16:58,995 --> 00:17:01,063
Actually, six.

237
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,467
Are you married?

238
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,438
No, but I just got
engaged last week.

239
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:11,974
Oh, congratulations.

240
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:13,009
Thank you.

241
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:31,093
Listen, I just
wanted to apologize

242
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:34,196
for snapping at
you the other day.

243
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,865
It was rude and you
didn't deserve it.

244
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,070
I was having a bad day and...

245
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:44,173
I'm sorry.

246
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,977
And I also didn't
mean what I said

247
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,013
when I said I was
gonna kill you.

248
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:53,082
[laughs]

249
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,150
Of course not.

250
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:55,483
That's just a figure of speech.

251
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:56,152
Exactly.

252
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:58,087
Yeah.

253
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,959
Well, I accept your apology
and I also appreciate it.

254
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:04,961
We all have bad days.

255
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:05,827
Thank you.

256
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,530
But why did you...

257
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:11,733
I'm sorry?

258
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:13,135
Why did you have a bad day?

259
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,138
[sighs]

260
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:18,473
It was just something at work.

261
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:28,817
Well, I had a client that was
venting about her marriage.

262
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,054
Something about how her husband

263
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,722
was doing really great on job

264
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:37,994
and he got promoted the
same week she got laid off.

265
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:40,528
And she was just so angry.

266
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:45,800
I don't know, and other stuff
about how they were able

267
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,037
to put a down payment
on a new house

268
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,806
and how they were now able
to try and conceive a baby.

269
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,845
And she was shaking.

270
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:00,116
She was digging her
nails into the sofa

271
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:04,020
and her head was down
and her foot was shaking.

272
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,188
She was so angry that her life

273
00:19:06,222 --> 00:19:08,723
was going exactly the
way that she planned

274
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:10,292
but it was of no thanks to her.

275
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:13,229
I don't know.

276
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:16,198
It just rubbed me the wrong way.

277
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:23,205
I see you got a lot
of Christmas cards.

278
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:25,573
- That's very nice.
- Oh, those aren't really,

279
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:26,775
I should just...

280
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:27,642
Wait, hold on.

281
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:29,345
Santa Killer?

282
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,080
Someone really sent you this?

283
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:32,081
Yeah.

284
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:33,049
It's no big deal.

285
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:34,216
They don't really know me.

286
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,886
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

287
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:37,819
This is terrible.

288
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:40,189
No, you shouldn't apologize.

289
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,290
It's not your fault.

290
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:43,725
No, but no one should
be sending stuff like this

291
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:45,693
especially on Christmas.

292
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,196
Like I said, it's
really no big deal.

293
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,099
They probably just
saw me on the news.

294
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:52,134
Okay, how about this?

295
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:53,835
I'm gonna stop by the
new station tomorrow

296
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,237
and tell them to stop
showing that video.

297
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,704
That's not right.

298
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,374
No, no, no, no, you
don't have to do that.

299
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,841
Tomorrow's Christmas.

300
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:01,277
You should just be
enjoying a happy,

301
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,945
relaxing day with your family.

302
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:06,648
Holly, you can only be as
happy as the person next to you.

303
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,350
I'll be here again
tomorrow anyway.

304
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:11,120
I'll drop off a letter at
the station on my way over.

305
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:14,156
Wait, you have
to work tomorrow?

306
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,024
Yes ma'am.

307
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:19,028
There's not a day in the
year when people give more.

308
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,130
And it's not work, I'm
actually an architect.

309
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,697
I just volunteer.

310
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,365
It's fun.

311
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,701
The kids, they think
I'm the real Santa.

312
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,337
[chuckles]

313
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,871
Okay.

314
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,407
Thank you for everything.

315
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,841
You're a very nice lady.

316
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:34,877
You're welcome.

317
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:38,047
Well, you have
guests coming soon.

318
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,814
I'll let you get back to it.

319
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:41,250
I'll show you out the door.

320
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:52,361
Holly, you need
help with that?

321
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:57,366
Oh, yeah.

322
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,235
Actually, I can't reach it.

323
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:00,402
That would be great.

324
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:02,071
I can reach it, no problem.

325
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:08,344
[ladder creaks]

326
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:17,319
Is it crooked?

327
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,390
No, actually that's perfect.

328
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:22,258
Thank you.

329
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:24,260
Oh, of course.

330
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:29,165
Ho, ho!

331
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:33,102
[Jesús tumbles down the stairs]

332
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:37,406
Oh my God!

333
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:39,074
What happened?

334
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:39,909
Who is this?

335
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:40,775
Jesus, Nick!

336
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:42,044
I didn't see him.

337
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:43,745
Sir, are you okay?

338
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:46,315
Nick, he's bleeding.

339
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,919
It's okay, it's okay.

340
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,220
We'll call the police
and then they'll send

341
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:53,255
an ambulance and
he's gonna be okay.

342
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,324
Everything is gonna be fine.

343
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,358
You're right.

344
00:21:57,493 --> 00:22:00,062
[bell falls]

345
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,365
Nick?

346
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,100
Yeah.

347
00:22:05,134 --> 00:22:06,402
We can't call the cops.

348
00:22:06,435 --> 00:22:07,769
What?

349
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:10,973
We can't call the cops.

350
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:12,308
I think he's dead.

351
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:17,046
[panting]

352
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:19,148
I think he's dead.

353
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:20,249
No, no, no, no,
you don't know that,

354
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:22,184
he could be sleeping...

355
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:24,819
Nick, that was a brass bell.

356
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:26,088
Look at all this blood.

357
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:27,323
Then why aren't we
calling the police?

358
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:28,123
Because they'll
think I did it.

359
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:30,359
Haven't you watched
the news today?

360
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,994
I threatened him Nick.

361
00:22:32,027 --> 00:22:33,128
I threatened him.

362
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:35,397
Nobody will think that.

363
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:37,832
Nick, the letters,
the text messages.

364
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:39,734
I haven't even checked Facebook.

365
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:42,004
What do you suggest?

366
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,138
I don't know.

367
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:44,006
I need to think.

368
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:47,476
We make it look
like an accident.

369
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,078
We cover it up.

370
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:50,312
You've seen Dexter!

371
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:51,547
Dexter?

372
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,448
Honey, what are
you talking about?

373
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:53,781
I don't know, okay?

374
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:55,317
I'm scared.

375
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:57,086
We just need to think.

376
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,287
We need to think.

377
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,259
We need to calm down, we need
to take some time and think.

378
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:07,029
[door bell rings]

379
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,034
[rush music]

380
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:21,577
Are we early?

381
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,411
No.

382
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,845
Are you sure?

383
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,381
What could they
be doing in there?

384
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:27,149
They probably just want
the place to look pretty.

385
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:30,386
[rush music]

386
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:04,620
Oh, hi.

387
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,455
You must be Nick's parents.

388
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,523
Oh, hi.

389
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:08,557
Pleasure to meet you.

390
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,225
Did you knock?

391
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:11,460
Yeah, but they're busy.

392
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,462
Nonsense, what are
they doing in there?

393
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:20,936
[rush music]

394
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:54,403
- Hi.
- Hi.

395
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:55,304
[chuckles]

396
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:56,138
Hey.

397
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,005
[altogether] Hi.

398
00:24:58,474 --> 00:24:59,508
Come on in.

399
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,943
Merry Christmas!

400
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:02,478
This is so nice
to meet you Holly,.

401
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:05,080
I've heard so much about you.

402
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:06,448
Merry Christmas.

403
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:10,319
This house is adorable.

404
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:12,354
Look at these decorations.

405
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,991
Where would you like me
to take this bags up to?

406
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:17,426
No, no, no, don't.

407
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,460
I'll take them up myself.

408
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:19,328
Don't worry about that.

409
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:20,496
Don't be ridiculous,
it's four bags.

410
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:21,530
Dad, it's fine.

411
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,498
I've been working out.

412
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:24,967
Thanks Nick.

413
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,701
Good to meet you buddy.

414
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:26,502
Leave the little ones down there

415
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:27,469
Nice to meet you too.

416
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:35,978
Hi dad.

417
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:36,612
[laughs]

418
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:37,446
Hi Holly.

419
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,047
How are you?

420
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,649
You seem a little
nervous, what's the matter?

421
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:41,683
Nervous?

422
00:25:41,717 --> 00:25:42,985
[laughs]

423
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:44,353
You're so funny.

424
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:46,255
You're sure, is
everything okay?

425
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:47,389
Yeah, yeah.

426
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:48,457
Who wants wine?

427
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,491
I'll have a glass.

428
00:25:49,525 --> 00:25:50,392
Okay, great.

429
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:01,603
Hey honey, where
can I wash my hands?

430
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:02,971
You can wash them
in the kitchen sink.

431
00:26:03,005 --> 00:26:05,174
The downstairs
bathroom is broken.

432
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:10,279
Holly, this house is gorgeous.

433
00:26:10,312 --> 00:26:14,516
Look at these floors,
your kitchen, the tree.

434
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,617
You should be very proud.

435
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:18,053
Thanks mom.

436
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:53,355
And y'all flew in from where?

437
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:54,223
From Boston.

438
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:55,757
I love Boston.

439
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:56,992
That's a great city.

440
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:59,561
And Holly mentioned
you're from Texas?

441
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:01,096
Yeah, just outside of Houston.

442
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:02,364
Oh, how lovely.

443
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:03,499
[chuckles]

444
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:05,133
How was the flight?

445
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,102
Well, your father was asleep

446
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:09,404
before take-off and
I just read my book.

447
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:11,573
So it went by pretty quickly.

448
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:12,708
Ours was only two hours.

449
00:27:12,741 --> 00:27:14,209
It was great.

450
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:16,612
Holly, sweetie, can
you please give us

451
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:17,546
a tour of the house?

452
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:18,580
[cork pops out of the bottle]

453
00:27:18,614 --> 00:27:19,548
A what?

454
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:20,782
A tour.

455
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:22,251
Honey, we haven't
seen the place.

456
00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:23,519
Yeah, a tour.

457
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:24,653
That'd be great.

458
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,556
Oh well, I was thinking
that we could drink the wine

459
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:32,594
and I wanted to tell
you how Nick proposed.

460
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:35,197
[everybody chimes in excitement]

461
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,299
Holly, that'd be great.

462
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:13,669
[pours wine into a glass]

463
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:16,638
[Christmas song]

464
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:20,275
Well, as you all know,
we were on vacation

465
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:22,244
in the South of France.

466
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:25,414
And one night he decides
he wants to go explore

467
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:27,749
the roof of the hotel.

468
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:31,753
He wanted to go up there
even though it was shut down.

469
00:28:31,787 --> 00:28:34,623
So, somehow he figured
out a way to get up there

470
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:37,726
and it was so beautiful.

471
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,564
You could see the city skyline,
you could see the ocean.

472
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:45,434
So while I'm taking
all of this in,

473
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:46,868
he gets down on one knee

474
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:48,470
Aaw!

475
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:49,605
and he proposes.

476
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:50,872
[laughing]

477
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:52,474
Oh, it was so beautiful.

478
00:28:52,507 --> 00:28:53,775
We stayed up there
all night long.

479
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:55,744
We didn't wanna come down.

480
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,479
[footsteps]

481
00:28:57,512 --> 00:28:58,347
Sorry guys.

482
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:00,282
Did you change?

483
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:00,883
What?

484
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,384
No, why would I change?

485
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:04,319
[chuckles]

486
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:05,454
You're so romantic.

487
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:06,421
Oh, thanks mom.

488
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:08,323
Hey, why don't we eat?

489
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:09,725
I am hungry.

490
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:12,794
[indistinct chatter]

491
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:18,533
[laughing]

492
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:23,372
That actually reminds me of
the church I used to go to.

493
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:25,807
Just for fun Eve, humor me.

494
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:28,710
Christmas at church,
what do you envision?

495
00:29:28,744 --> 00:29:29,946
Well, not much.

496
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:32,347
A priest and some prayers.

497
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:33,649
Fair assumption.

498
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:36,652
I still have the same name
burned into my memory,

499
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:41,256
Southland Christian Church
run by father Patrick.

500
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:44,259
Anywhere around mid-December,
you would walk in

501
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:47,562
and be swallowed into a
theatrical Christmas display

502
00:29:47,596 --> 00:29:49,564
that rivaled Broadway.

503
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:51,800
Trees stretched
higher than columns,

504
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,835
tinsel around every pew

505
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:56,238
and stained glass
shining red and green

506
00:29:56,271 --> 00:30:00,509
highlighting snowflakes that
would dribble from the ceiling.

507
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:02,744
Decorations I haven't
seen the likes of

508
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:04,680
until I stepped into this house.

509
00:30:04,713 --> 00:30:06,715
Yes, well done Holly.

510
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:08,784
Oh, thank you.

511
00:30:08,817 --> 00:30:10,819
These decorations
were so impressive

512
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,889
that even non-religious families

513
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:15,390
would come and check
out the Wonderland.

514
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:17,927
Every holiday was
a sight to be seen.

515
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,696
I'll never forget
Easter was the best

516
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:24,266
with a light show and
ridiculous rock music.

517
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,268
I'm surprised it didn't
give half the audience

518
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:28,603
a heart attack to be honest.

519
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:30,272
But as my family
went year after year,

520
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:31,807
I got more curious.

521
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,811
I had to know why one of the
most visceral experiences

522
00:30:35,844 --> 00:30:38,447
of my younger years
happened in a place

523
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,717
that most people complain
about being dragged to.

524
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,954
So I went up to father
Patrick after the show

525
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:49,357
and I asked him, what's
with all the theatrics?

526
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,460
He looks at me and smiles,

527
00:30:51,493 --> 00:30:54,763
points across the way to
my girlfriend and says,

528
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:57,599
because Rudy, I have
never seen that girl

529
00:30:57,632 --> 00:31:02,304
in this church before but
she'll be in here for Christmas.

530
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:02,939
Was she?

531
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:05,741
Yes.

532
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:09,045
We broke up in July but I
saw her again in December.

533
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:10,980
She brought her whole family.

534
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:14,583
Well, I'd go to church
if it was like that.

535
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:15,851
[chuckles]

536
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:17,452
And there's free wine.

537
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:19,721
[laughing]

538
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:24,693
Speaking of which, I
wanna propose a toast.

539
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:30,665
To the newly engaged, to the
soon to be extended family,

540
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:34,503
to this marvelous house

541
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:36,805
and the much more
marvelous decorations.

542
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:38,507
[chuckles]

543
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,911
Oh, and to Nicholas for
his big photography sale.

544
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:43,980
[laughing]

545
00:31:44,013 --> 00:31:45,882
Where did you put the photo?

546
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:47,616
Actually, we do, we have...

547
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:52,854
Actually, I think
we took it down.

548
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:53,923
Where did you put it?

549
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,490
Why would you take it down?

550
00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:58,560
Babe, where did you put it?

551
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:00,796
[chuckles]

552
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:04,399
I think it's in the closet.

553
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:08,870
It's behind a lot of things

554
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:11,339
that we probably
shouldn't touch.

555
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:13,943
What do you mean?

556
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:17,880
I just don't think
that we should move it.

557
00:32:17,914 --> 00:32:18,981
Nonsense.

558
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:19,882
I wanna see it.

559
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:20,749
Which closet?

560
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:22,350
Oh, it's right there.

561
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,420
Mom.

562
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:26,621
Mom, lemme get it.

563
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:27,924
I'm sure I can handle it.

564
00:32:28,857 --> 00:32:29,926
Dad.

565
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:30,759
What?

566
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:31,693
Let her get it.

567
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:32,861
Babe, I'm sure it's fine.

568
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:39,068
Joe, can you
help me with this?

569
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:49,744
What are you guys
doing with this?

570
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:55,450
Holly volunteers for charity.

571
00:32:56,886 --> 00:32:58,486
That doesn't sound like Holly.

572
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:09,564
Your bell is rusting.

573
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:17,073
Did you lose a boot?

574
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:20,910
Actually, You know what?

575
00:33:20,943 --> 00:33:21,810
I was looking for that

576
00:33:21,843 --> 00:33:24,479
but you can just leave
that right there.

577
00:33:24,512 --> 00:33:26,015
Let's say a pretty big boot

578
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:27,749
for your foot there Sasquatch.

579
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:29,118
No one cares Joe.

580
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:31,786
Is this it?

581
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,056
This is lovely.

582
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:34,991
Okay, hold on.

583
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:36,192
Lemme just take this down.

584
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:37,525
This has to come down.

585
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:42,831
All right Joe, bring it up.

586
00:33:42,864 --> 00:33:43,698
Nice.

587
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:52,041
Why is it so important?

588
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:53,910
Because he sold it
to an art gallery.

589
00:33:53,943 --> 00:33:55,077
[chuckles]

590
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:56,511
Oh, very nice.

591
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:58,047
If you don't mind
me asking Nick,

592
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,049
how much does a photo
usually sell for?

593
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:00,917
Dad.

594
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:02,751
What?

595
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:04,020
I'm just curious.

596
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:05,754
I work in the
opposite of the arts.

597
00:34:05,787 --> 00:34:06,923
I know nothing about
this kind of stuff.

598
00:34:06,956 --> 00:34:09,824
But dad, you just don't ask
someone how much they make.

599
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:11,961
Holly, I'm not asking
him how much he makes.

600
00:34:11,994 --> 00:34:14,763
I'm just curious how much
a photo could sell for.

601
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:16,098
Dad, it's still not...

602
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:17,900
22,000.

603
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:26,608
$22,000 for a
single photograph?

604
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:29,577
That's incredible.

605
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:30,212
Thank you.

606
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:31,147
Where did you take it?

607
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,949
It's actually up on the roof.

608
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:37,053
It's a picture of the skyline
of the town at sunrise.

609
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:40,555
I would definitely
cheers to that.

610
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:42,657
Cheers!

611
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:54,003
Rudy, honey, would
you go grab a bottle?

612
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:54,937
Sure.

613
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:56,538
No, no, no, I got that.

614
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:57,974
Don't worry about it.

615
00:34:58,007 --> 00:35:00,508
You know, Holly didn't always
want to be a psychiatrist.

616
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:02,544
She wanted to work
in the arts as well.

617
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:03,545
Mom...

618
00:35:03,578 --> 00:35:05,114
That's not true.

619
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:08,583
Oh please, you were
always decorating your room

620
00:35:08,616 --> 00:35:10,119
putting on little plays.

621
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:13,889
You told us you wanted
to design Broadway shows.

622
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:15,690
Mom, I was like 12.

623
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:17,994
That was never a real
career goal for me.

624
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:19,661
But it could have been.

625
00:35:19,694 --> 00:35:21,998
You spent so much time on it.

626
00:35:22,031 --> 00:35:24,799
You had those notebooks
with the drawings

627
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,203
and remember the mannequins
with the fabrics.

628
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:31,207
With a little bit of
training and school

629
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,043
you could have gotten
better, you could've done it.

630
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:35,945
Look at him.

631
00:35:35,978 --> 00:35:39,081
He's selling pictures
for thousands a piece.

632
00:35:39,115 --> 00:35:40,049
Mom.

633
00:35:40,082 --> 00:35:41,816
I'm just saying.

634
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,953
I can see why you two
get along so well.

635
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:44,954
[cork pops]

636
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:47,622
Mom, I love my job.

637
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,158
I made the right decision.

638
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:52,194
I didn't flush away any
dreams I may have had.

639
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:53,062
Well...

640
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:54,729
Oh, me too son.

641
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:57,266
I don't know about flush
away, but sure, honey.

642
00:35:57,299 --> 00:35:58,767
If that makes you happy.

643
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,052
Woah!

644
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:17,153
Jesus, Nick!

645
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:18,220
Sorry dad.

646
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:19,155
I'm so sorry.

647
00:36:19,188 --> 00:36:20,156
Are you trying to kill me?

648
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:20,990
What?

649
00:36:21,023 --> 00:36:22,191
No.

650
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,792
No, we're not trying
to kill anyone.

651
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:28,164
Holly, do you know where
the recycling bin is?

652
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:29,065
What?

653
00:36:29,098 --> 00:36:30,832
I was gonna take
all the bottles out

654
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:32,001
to the recycling bin.

655
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:34,636
Do you know where it is?

656
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:35,371
Yeah.

657
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:36,671
It's outside on the patio.

658
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,075
Can you come show me?

659
00:36:41,077 --> 00:36:42,111
Sure.

660
00:36:46,848 --> 00:36:48,150
Is everything okay?

661
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:49,085
Yeah.

662
00:36:49,118 --> 00:36:50,019
I'm just going to help him.

663
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:51,220
You sure?

664
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:52,388
Yeah dad.

665
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:53,621
I'll be right back.

666
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:55,891
[whirring]

667
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:13,741
Come here.

668
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:14,376
Come on.

669
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,244
I'm coming!

670
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,646
What are you doing?

671
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,216
Did the plumber come
and fix the bathroom?

672
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:21,417
What?

673
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,885
Is the downstairs
bathroom fixed?

674
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:25,988
No, but of course we
paid to have it fixed.

675
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:28,224
And not only does the
downstairs bathroom not work

676
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:30,226
but now the second
floor bathroom leaks.

677
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:32,727
Oh, and the plumber
is an asshole.

678
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,264
Why are we talking
about this out here?

679
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,664
Okay, okay, whatever.

680
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:39,235
We're gonna have to
excuse ourselves,

681
00:37:39,268 --> 00:37:41,137
go upstairs and move the body.

682
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:41,971
What?

683
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:43,372
That is a horrible idea.

684
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:44,739
Why would we do that?

685
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:46,442
He's in the bathtub.

686
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:47,276
Nick!

687
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:48,444
I had no other choice.

688
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,112
I had no other option.

689
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:52,214
It's gonna take us
forever to move him

690
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:53,249
and clean it all up.

691
00:37:53,282 --> 00:37:54,250
They're gonna hear us.

692
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:57,019
We're on our fourth
bottle of wine.

693
00:37:57,052 --> 00:37:59,121
At some point, somebody
is gonna have to pee

694
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:01,257
and if they can't use
the bathroom down here...

695
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,025
We'll just distract them.

696
00:38:03,058 --> 00:38:05,427
Holly, honey, babe.

697
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:08,330
There's a dead body
in the bathtub.

698
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:10,132
How are we gonna distract
somebody from that?

699
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,833
I don't know.

700
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:13,701
But don't you think that if
we're gone for 30 minutes

701
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:16,038
someone's gonna come looking
for us to see what's wrong.

702
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:16,972
Why would you put
them in the bathroom?

703
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:19,008
What was I supposed to do?

704
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:21,843
This wouldn't be a problem if
your parents weren't so nosy.

705
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:23,412
I don't know,
maybe not in a room

706
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:25,181
that old people
use 30 times a day.

707
00:38:25,214 --> 00:38:26,848
Why are you arguing with me?

708
00:38:26,882 --> 00:38:29,418
Maybe because you put a
dead guy in the guest bathroom

709
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:31,320
when we have guests.

710
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,255
You're the one who
brought him in the house.

711
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:35,891
You're the one who knocked
him over and killed him.

712
00:38:35,925 --> 00:38:37,426
I did not kill him,
the bell killed him.

713
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:39,794
And you're the reason why
we can't go to the police.

714
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:41,497
No, no, no, the reason
we can't go to the police

715
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,399
is because of that idiot
who filmed the video.

716
00:38:43,432 --> 00:38:45,733
Jesús even said
I'm a nice person.

717
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:47,002
Who's Jesús?

718
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:48,204
The dead guy in the bathroom.

719
00:38:48,237 --> 00:38:49,205
Whatever!

720
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:51,240
Point is we have to go
upstairs and move him.

721
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:52,241
Absolutely not.

722
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:54,210
We're not touching
anything until they leave

723
00:38:54,243 --> 00:38:55,377
and we come up with a plan.

724
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:58,247
We're just gonna
have to tell them

725
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,250
that everyone's gonna have to
use the master bathroom, okay?

726
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:03,185
They won't go in there
if we ask them not to.

727
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:05,354
They won't, come on.

728
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:06,922
Okay, okay, okay, fine.

729
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:08,490
Fine.

730
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:09,325
Fine.

731
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:10,392
Fine.

732
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:22,471
[slow music]

733
00:39:25,341 --> 00:39:28,110
Well, Rudy's an accountant.

734
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:30,446
So obviously that was
a nine to five job

735
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:34,316
for many years until he
started his own firm.

736
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,318
Then it got to be more flexible.

737
00:39:36,352 --> 00:39:38,820
But you know, my hours are
just all over the place.

738
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:41,390
I pretty much
survive on no sleep.

739
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:42,424
What do you do?

740
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,260
I'm a doctor.

741
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:48,130
I do a lot of ER work and
also some scheduled surgeries.

742
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:49,098
So interesting.

743
00:39:49,131 --> 00:39:50,865
What drew you to that career?

744
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:55,904
Well, when I was young I
developed a gluten allergy

745
00:39:57,072 --> 00:39:58,507
and it just seemed
like it took so long

746
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,409
for any of the doctors
to diagnose me.

747
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:05,281
I was just so sick and every
doctor I went to just said,

748
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:11,186
eat bland foods like
toast, crackers and pasta.

749
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,521
All of them have gluten.

750
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:15,391
And then when I found out,

751
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:19,794
I thought, now, there's
some dumb doctors out there.

752
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,531
And how about I try
to be a smart one?

753
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:24,967
[laughing]

754
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,835
Oh, and by the way,
we have a delicious

755
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:28,937
gluten-free cake mom.

756
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:30,172
You're gonna love it.

757
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:32,374
I promise you this place
makes the best cakes.

758
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:35,277
Cake sounds great.

759
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:38,213
'Cause you know, on
our wedding night

760
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:41,517
I didn't get a chance
eat any of my cake.

761
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,951
It had gluten.

762
00:40:44,353 --> 00:40:47,256
That's because I was
in charge of ordering it.

763
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:48,524
[laughing]

764
00:40:48,557 --> 00:40:50,326
Well, that's alright baby.

765
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,027
I married you anyway.

766
00:40:56,398 --> 00:40:58,033
What do you two guys do?

767
00:40:58,067 --> 00:40:59,635
Well, I used to be the buyer

768
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,404
for Macy's women's
summer catalog

769
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:05,407
but I retired once Holly
went off to college.

770
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:07,242
Well, that makes perfect sense

771
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:11,046
because you're just so
fashionable and stylish.

772
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,314
Thank you.

773
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:13,916
Holly, can you
pass me the knife?

774
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,417
Oh, I got it.

775
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:17,886
Thank you.

776
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:22,291
You know, I really
do enjoy retirement.

777
00:41:22,324 --> 00:41:25,394
I have more time for
hobbies, vacations.

778
00:41:25,427 --> 00:41:27,062
It's great.

779
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:29,631
And what do you do Joe?

780
00:41:29,665 --> 00:41:31,600
I work in the
Sheriff's department.

781

[coughs]

782
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,173
You're a cop?

783
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:39,041
Yeah.

784
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:41,410
You know, that's-that's-

785
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:44,480
- Holly, you didn't
tell me that.

786
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:46,415
I told you he worked
in the government.

787
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:50,486
That's just not what
I thought that meant.

788
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,587
[chuckles]

789
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,921
Well, it's not like I'm
out there pulling people

790
00:41:52,955 --> 00:41:54,189
who are over speeding.

791
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:56,024
I work on some of
the tougher cases,

792
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:58,994
the manslaughter, homicides.

793
00:41:59,027 --> 00:42:00,262
I'm not quite a detective

794
00:42:00,295 --> 00:42:02,464
but I work very closely
with the detectives.

795
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:06,635
That's great.

796
00:42:08,303 --> 00:42:10,973

upstairs, something.

a piece of cake.

What do you have to do Nick?

799
00:42:14,977 --> 00:42:17,479
I have to go
clean something up.

800
00:42:19,314 --> 00:42:20,716
Can't that wait till later?

801
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:21,583
Nope.

[laughs]

803
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:30,659
I don't know why he's acting
a little bit strange tonight.

804
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:34,496
Maybe he had to
change his shirt again.

805

So everyone's gonna have
to use the master bathroom.

Honey, two of your
bathrooms are broken?

Yeah.

with the plumber...

Yeah.

actually on the third floor.

of these is the bathroom?

I don't know.

let me take a look at it.

up another set of stairs.

00:47:14,509 --> 00:47:16,012

you to mess with it

knows how to fix a toilet.

the one upstairs.

You know what?

897
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,679
I wouldn't want you
to hurt your back

898
00:47:50,712 --> 00:47:53,983

fixing this one here.

mother, all right?

I'll meet you downstairs.

00:48:27,549 --> 00:48:30,019
No, I need to
tell you right now.

916
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:30,852
What?

917
00:48:30,887 --> 00:48:31,787
What is it?

918
00:48:35,892 --> 00:48:37,059
Nick has cancer.

919
00:48:37,093 --> 00:48:37,894
What!

920
00:48:37,927 --> 00:48:39,828
No, I don't have cancer.

921
00:48:39,861 --> 00:48:41,563
But we don't know for sure.

922
00:48:41,596 --> 00:48:44,332
I'm like 90% sure that
I don't have cancer.

923
00:48:44,366 --> 00:48:45,634
But there's still a chance.

924
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:47,937
There's like a 10% chance.

925
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:53,341
I'm really sorry
to hear that Nick.

926
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:55,510
Can we talk about this after?

927
00:48:55,544 --> 00:48:57,779
'Cause right now
I just need to...

928
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:58,780
No dad, don't.

929
00:48:58,814 --> 00:49:01,918
Holly, a little space please.

930
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,763
[flushes toilet]

931
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:16,398
It seems to be working fine.

932
00:49:17,632 --> 00:49:20,368
Holly, honey, is
everything alright?

933
00:49:20,402 --> 00:49:21,536
Yeah mom.

934
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:25,942
What are you
guys doing in here?

935
00:49:25,975 --> 00:49:27,977
Dad just fixed the toilet.

936
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,811
Oh, wonderful.

937
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:31,746
Well, it wasn't
actually broken.

938
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:33,582
Nick?

939
00:49:33,615 --> 00:49:34,816
Yeah mom.

940
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:35,985
Nicholas?

941
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:37,619
Nicholas?

942
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:38,854
Yeah, mom.

943
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:40,822
Are you having
a tour up there?

944
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:43,658
No, no, no, no, no, no
one is getting a tour.

945
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:45,427
Holly's dad just needed
to use the bathroom.

946
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,896
Eve already went up there

947
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:48,064
I don't want us to be the only
one not getting a tour now

948
00:49:48,097 --> 00:49:49,865
But no one's getting a tour.

949
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:50,933
Why not?

950
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:54,603
Rudy, don't you wanna see
the rest of the house?

951
00:49:54,636 --> 00:49:56,738
I'm dying to.

952
00:49:56,771 --> 00:49:58,908
Well, I don't want
you to die, so go ahead.

953
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:01,043
I'm gonna sit here
and turn on the TV.

954
00:50:02,677 --> 00:50:03,880
I should've expected that.

955
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:05,847
Mom, no, no, no, no.

956
00:50:05,882 --> 00:50:06,681
Stay down here.

957
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:07,549
Stay down here.

958
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:10,119
Come back.

959
00:50:10,152 --> 00:50:10,887
Just come back downstairs.

960
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:12,889
[drip]

961
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:24,033
[drip]

962
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:32,474
[laughs]

963
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:33,910
There you are.

964
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:36,845
Well, this place is great.

965
00:50:36,879 --> 00:50:38,513
I like the bathroom.

966
00:50:38,546 --> 00:50:40,116
Is it time for the tour?

967
00:50:40,149 --> 00:50:40,950
A tour?

968
00:50:40,983 --> 00:50:41,884
Now?

969
00:50:41,918 --> 00:50:42,885
Yes honey, I want a tour.

970
00:50:42,919 --> 00:50:44,220
Why would we wait?

971
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:45,720
Mary let's look around.

972
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:46,989
Okay.

973
00:50:47,023 --> 00:50:48,124
Did Nick tell you
to come up here?

974
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:48,958
Oh, no.

975
00:50:48,991 --> 00:50:50,625
Don't worry about him.

976
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:51,928
I love this study.

977
00:50:54,562 --> 00:50:57,699
Hey, so this floor
is the guest room

978
00:50:57,732 --> 00:51:01,037
and guest bath with an office.

979
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,470
Is the master upstairs?

980
00:51:02,504 --> 00:51:03,605
It has to be.

981
00:51:03,638 --> 00:51:04,206
Let's go.

982
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,074
Oh, let's go.

983
00:51:06,574 --> 00:51:08,010
Wait.

984
00:51:08,044 --> 00:51:09,577
And I'm gonna use the
bathroom and I'll be right up.

985
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:12,014
Dad, just hurry up.

986
00:51:12,048 --> 00:51:13,682
[door closes]

987
00:51:13,715 --> 00:51:14,783
Nick, are you coming?

988
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:21,023
Don't mind me dad.

989
00:51:21,057 --> 00:51:22,058
Just doing a little
house-keeping.

990
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:24,126
[Lady] Good morning everyone.

991
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,161
[laughing]

992
00:51:25,194 --> 00:51:27,629
[Crowd] Good morning.

993
00:51:27,662 --> 00:51:28,496
[drip]

994
00:51:29,664 --> 00:51:31,733
[peeing]

995
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:34,036
Wow!

996
00:51:35,237 --> 00:51:37,006
This is incredible.

997
00:51:50,886 --> 00:51:53,089
Hey, do you mind
if I look around?

998
00:51:53,122 --> 00:51:53,923
Year, sure.

999
00:51:53,956 --> 00:51:54,756
Go ahead.

1000
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:55,623
Mom.

1001
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:56,258
What?

1002
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:58,127
This bedroom is lovely.

1003
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,962
Did you decorate it yourself?

1004
00:51:59,996 --> 00:52:01,297
Yeah, I did.

1005
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,131
Thanks.

1006
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:03,199
What a cute dresser.

1007
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,035
Pottery Barn?

1008
00:52:06,068 --> 00:52:07,303
Neiman Marcus?

1009
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:08,971
It's Ikea.

1010
00:52:09,005 --> 00:52:12,607
Oh, you going for that
whole minimalistic lifestyle.

1011
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:15,877
I saw a documentary about that.

1012
00:52:15,911 --> 00:52:18,114
I'm not really going
for anything mom.

1013
00:52:18,147 --> 00:52:20,116
Did you change the
color of the walls

1014
00:52:20,149 --> 00:52:22,084
when you guys moved in?

1015
00:52:22,118 --> 00:52:23,019
No.

1016
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:25,021
Yeah, I see that.

1017
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:30,159
Are you gonna add some rugs
or some matching curtains?

1018
00:52:32,094 --> 00:52:33,595
No, I-

1019
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:35,697
It didn't really cross my mind.

1020
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,266
[clears throat]

1021
00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:38,934
I really wish we could
have seen the place

1022
00:52:38,968 --> 00:52:41,703
before I bought
your Christmas gift.

1023
00:52:41,736 --> 00:52:43,205
I could have really
helped you out with this.

1024
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:46,342
Holly, I know you have some
trouble with this kind of thing.

1025
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:47,176
Mom.

1026
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:48,110
What?

1027
00:52:48,144 --> 00:52:49,211
Can you stop doing that?

1028
00:52:49,245 --> 00:52:50,146
I'm not a kid.

1029
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:51,147
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

1030
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,714
I'm not doing anything.

1031
00:52:52,747 --> 00:52:55,817
I'm just trying to help
you start your future.

1032
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:59,321
Look dear, people
only respect you

1033
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:02,058
as much as you respect yourself.

1034
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:05,693
Now, you might not realize
the gravity of that just yet

1035
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:08,030
but one day you will.

1036
00:53:08,064 --> 00:53:12,968
Now, it's Christmas
and you have guests.

1037
00:53:13,502 --> 00:53:14,136
Don't make that face.

1038
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:17,639
Now, let's go see this bathroom.

1039
00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:21,810
Oh, this is beautiful.

1040
00:53:25,147 --> 00:53:27,316
What's in here?

1041
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:31,887
It's beautiful.

1042
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:35,723
So much storage space.

1043
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:42,164
[fabric rustling]

1044
00:53:42,198 --> 00:53:43,299
Hey, that looks like Holly.

1045
00:53:43,332 --> 00:53:44,699
God knows you do
it every morning

1046
00:53:44,732 --> 00:53:46,969
while some of us
are trying to sleep.

1047
00:53:47,002 --> 00:53:48,170
Oh, don't you have something
more productive to be doing?

1048
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:49,004
That's funny.

1049
00:53:49,038 --> 00:53:49,871
Get away from me.

1050
00:53:49,905 --> 00:53:50,738
[channel changes]

1051
00:53:51,407 --> 00:53:54,143

[intense music]

1055
00:54:41,223 --> 00:54:42,992
Actually, I need to
use the bathroom too,

1056
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:44,393
do you guys mind?

1057
00:54:44,426 --> 00:54:45,693
Just get out!

1058
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,930
[scream]

[whirring]

1060
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:01,203
Holly White

1061
00:56:01,237 --> 00:56:02,737
You lied to me.

1062
00:56:04,173 --> 00:56:07,875
You told me this was up
on display in your office.

1063
00:56:13,983 --> 00:56:16,285
[footsteps]

1064
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:29,331
And the engagement party?

1065
00:56:29,365 --> 00:56:31,200
Well, we decided to...

1066
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:34,303
Everybody is traveling
and it's just so busy.

1067
00:56:34,336 --> 00:56:37,072
Hey mom, so how was the tour?

1068
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:39,508
[chuckles]

1069
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:41,410
I'm so, so happy Nicholas.

1070
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:43,512
And that bedroom

1071
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:46,081
[chuckles]

1072
00:56:46,115 --> 00:56:47,349
it's astonishing.

1073
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,285
Thank you.

1074
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:52,554
That cake was delicious.

1075
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:54,890
I think I'm gonna finish it

1076
00:56:54,923 --> 00:56:57,825
and then I think that it
might be time for bed.

1077
00:56:57,859 --> 00:56:59,295
That sounds like a great plan.

1078
00:56:59,328 --> 00:57:01,796
[chuckles]

1079
00:57:03,165 --> 00:57:05,367
[slow music]

1080
00:57:10,406 --> 00:57:13,008
[clock ticking]

1081
00:57:23,452 --> 00:57:25,387
Well, I'm going to bed.

1082
00:57:25,421 --> 00:57:27,289
I guess we'll see
you in the morning.

1083
00:57:27,323 --> 00:57:28,123
Goodnight.

1084
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:28,957
Goodnight.

1085
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:29,591
Goodnight honey.

1086
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:30,426
Hey, Merry Christmas.

1087
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:31,260
Goodnight guys.

1088
00:57:31,293 --> 00:57:32,261
Goodnight.

1089
00:57:32,294 --> 00:57:34,430
[footsteps]

1090
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,403
All right honey,
lets go up to the bed.

1091
00:57:41,437 --> 00:57:42,438
Mom wait, you don't have to...

1092
00:57:42,471 --> 00:57:45,207
I'm gonna be right here.

1093
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,143
I won't go upstairs, I'm
comfortable right here.

1094
00:57:49,411 --> 00:57:52,281
You two guys can
sleep in your own bed.

1095
00:57:52,314 --> 00:57:53,549
'Cause I don't want
to trek upstairs.

1096
00:57:53,582 --> 00:57:56,985
But you could sleep
in the bed upstairs.

1097
00:57:57,653 --> 00:57:59,254
[chuckles]

1098
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:02,558
Nicholas, you have
an Advent wreath.

1099
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:04,126
I didn't see that before.

1100
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,328
I'm so proud of you Nicholas.

1101
00:58:09,398 --> 00:58:11,934
Okay, well I'm going up then.

1102
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:22,244
[clock ticking]

1103
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:37,393
[bell towers clang]

1104
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:15,264
Nice call.

1105
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:17,599
Thanks.

1106
00:59:18,634 --> 00:59:20,402
We're gonna have to move him.

1107
00:59:20,436 --> 00:59:21,236
Nick.

1108
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,438
I feel like they know.

1109
00:59:24,373 --> 00:59:26,408
As long as he's in the house
we're not gonna feel safe.

1110
00:59:27,509 --> 00:59:29,011
What makes you think that?

1111
00:59:30,412 --> 00:59:32,648
I think your dad saw
the blood in the bathroom.

1112
00:59:32,681 --> 00:59:35,083
No, he would have
asked us if he did.

1113
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:35,951
No.

1114
00:59:37,386 --> 00:59:40,155
He's your dad, he would do
anything to protect you.

1115
00:59:40,189 --> 00:59:41,557
I just met him a
couple of hours ago.

1116
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,492
He's gonna think
I'm a psychopath.

1117
00:59:47,062 --> 00:59:47,763
Okay.

1118
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:48,597
Well, what are you thinking?

1119
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,568
[sighs]

1120
00:59:52,601 --> 00:59:56,271
We wait an hour or two.

1121
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:58,474
When everyone's asleep,

1122
00:59:58,507 --> 00:59:59,575
we move him to the
trunk of my car

1123
00:59:59,608 --> 01:00:03,445
and I drive him out to the
coast and you stay here.

1124
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:05,447
I'll get rid of him

1125
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:08,217
and you'll never have
to worry about it again.

1126
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:13,455
Can't we just wait
till they leave?

1127
01:00:13,489 --> 01:00:15,123
No.

1128
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:16,758
They're here for what,
another day or two?

1129
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:18,727
Who's to say they
won't come up here

1130
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,395
snooping around again?

1131
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:22,764
At least if he's gone and
your dad's suspects anything,

1132
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:24,433
there's no evidence.

1133
01:00:24,466 --> 01:00:26,068
Okay, fine.

1134
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:29,037
But we're not waiting
for just two hours.

1135
01:00:29,071 --> 01:00:31,306
My dad stays awake
way too long for that.

1136
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,307
We're waiting four.

1137
01:00:34,443 --> 01:00:35,511
Okay, fine.

1138
01:00:44,419 --> 01:00:46,655
[slow music]

1139
01:01:20,122 --> 01:01:22,124
[creak]

1140
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:54,590
[snoring]

1141
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:54,583
Nicholas?

1142
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:57,519
Talk to her! Talk to her!

1143
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:02,391
[clears throat]

1144
01:03:02,424 --> 01:03:03,659
Hey mom.

1145
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:05,227
What are you doing awake?

1146
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:07,763
I just came to get some water

1147
01:03:07,796 --> 01:03:08,864
but I see that you're doing
something so I'm gonna...

1148
01:03:08,898 --> 01:03:10,265
No, no, that's okay.

1149
01:03:10,298 --> 01:03:11,266
This is for your dad.

1150
01:03:11,299 --> 01:03:12,567
Oh, okay.

1151
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:14,536
Well, I'm gonna head back up.

1152
01:03:14,569 --> 01:03:15,771
Don't you want your water?

1153
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:18,807
No, actually I'm kinda tired

1154
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,979
so I'm gonna go back to sleep.

1155
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:24,813
Why do you have on shoes?

1156
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,720
Oh, my feet were...

1157
01:03:32,621 --> 01:03:36,491
[body sliding down stairs]

1158
01:03:36,525 --> 01:03:37,359
...cold.

1159
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:39,394
I'm gonna go back up mom.

1160
01:03:39,428 --> 01:03:40,328
Goodnight.

1161
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:40,930
I'll see you in the morning.

1162
01:03:40,963 --> 01:03:42,798
Get some rest, okay?

1163
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:03,502
What are you guys doing?

1164
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:06,104
Shh!

1165
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:07,506
It's a surprise.

1166
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:09,174
Surprise me.

1167
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:11,043
Dad, it's for tomorrow.

1168
01:04:12,177 --> 01:04:14,781
Something really
weird has been going on.

1169
01:04:14,814 --> 01:04:17,650
Nothing weird
is going on here.

1170
01:04:17,684 --> 01:04:19,518
Nick!

1171
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:20,486
Don't lie to me.

1172
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:23,021
Dad, we're not lying, okay?

1173
01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:24,423
We're nervous.

1174
01:04:24,456 --> 01:04:25,457
Right?

1175
01:04:25,491 --> 01:04:26,391
We're getting married,

1176
01:04:26,425 --> 01:04:28,393
we've never met each
other's families before,

1177
01:04:28,427 --> 01:04:29,628
wouldn't you be nervous?

1178
01:04:32,498 --> 01:04:34,500
Nothing weird is going on dad.

1179
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:37,503
We're just preparing a
surprise for tomorrow.

1180
01:04:37,536 --> 01:04:38,504
It's Christmas.

1181
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,541
Okay.

1182
01:04:42,574 --> 01:04:43,542
We'll see.

1183
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:44,376
Surprise.

1184
01:04:44,409 --> 01:04:45,410
Surprise.

1185
01:04:45,444 --> 01:04:46,411
Tomorrow.

1186
01:04:46,445 --> 01:04:47,279
Tomorrow, yep.

1187
01:04:48,648 --> 01:04:49,448
Goodnight.

1188
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:50,382
Goodnight dad.

1189
01:04:50,415 --> 01:04:51,818
[chuckles]

1190
01:04:51,851 --> 01:04:54,654
[dramatic music]

1191
01:05:00,092 --> 01:05:02,060
Nick, what is that?

1192
01:05:02,094 --> 01:05:02,795
Dad, shh!

1193
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:04,162
Go back to sleep.

1194
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:05,564
There's nothing,
it's just a surprise.

1195
01:05:06,465 --> 01:05:08,066
Oh, okay.

1196
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:11,704
[dramatic music]

1197
01:05:15,274 --> 01:05:16,308
What do we do?

1198
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:18,210
I don't know.

1199
01:05:18,243 --> 01:05:19,611
I don't know.

1200
01:05:19,646 --> 01:05:20,813
We put him back in the trunk,

1201
01:05:20,847 --> 01:05:23,448
we leave him in
there and we lock it.

1202
01:05:25,117 --> 01:05:26,051
There's no latch.

1203
01:05:34,894 --> 01:05:36,696
Oh my God, Nick!

1204
01:05:36,729 --> 01:05:38,698
Nick, your photo.

1205
01:05:38,731 --> 01:05:39,866
What about it?

1206
01:05:39,899 --> 01:05:41,199
We put him on the roof.

1207
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:42,301
We have roof access, right?

1208
01:05:42,334 --> 01:05:45,537
We can just leave him up
there until they're gone.

1209
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:46,773
I already thought about that

1210
01:05:46,806 --> 01:05:48,507
but I tried, we gotta
go through the attic

1211
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,309
and I couldn't
lift him by myself.

1212
01:05:50,342 --> 01:05:52,277
Babe, but you
didn't try it with me.

1213
01:06:44,563 --> 01:06:46,398
Do you think we're
going to jail?

1214
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:49,167
I don't know.

1215
01:06:50,402 --> 01:06:51,536
We can always run away.

1216
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,608
I don't think our parents
are gonna find him up here.

1217
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:04,216
Yeah.

1218
01:07:06,351 --> 01:07:08,220
You think we can
leave him up here?

1219
01:07:08,253 --> 01:07:10,522
Yeah, we could
for a little while

1220
01:07:10,555 --> 01:07:15,560
but eventually someone's
gonna come looking for him.

1221
01:07:17,396 --> 01:07:18,230
Yeah.

1222
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:22,334
[sighs]

1223
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:24,837
We should just take all
of our cash and just leave.

1224
01:07:26,605 --> 01:07:27,807
Where do you wanna go?

1225
01:07:30,643 --> 01:07:32,812
We could go back to
the South of France.

1226
01:07:34,446 --> 01:07:37,516
Get a little house on that
hill overlooking the ocean.

1227
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:41,420
We could retire early.

1228
01:07:44,657 --> 01:07:47,626
And do nothing but sip
espresso and people watch.

1229
01:07:49,294 --> 01:07:51,496
And go lay out on the beach
and just soak up all the sun.

1230
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,364
Yeah.

1231
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:55,902
Yeah, that sounds like the life.

1232
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:58,403
[chuckles]

1233
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:03,442
We can't afford that.

1234
01:08:03,475 --> 01:08:05,243
[laughs]

1235
01:08:05,277 --> 01:08:05,912
I know.

1236
01:08:09,782 --> 01:08:14,453
Well, no matter what
happens, I love you.

1237
01:08:17,056 --> 01:08:17,890
I love you too.

1238
01:08:28,701 --> 01:08:30,602
Nice call, moving the body.

1239
01:08:30,636 --> 01:08:32,004
You saved us.

1240
01:08:32,038 --> 01:08:35,273
No, you saved us by
getting your dad off my back.

1241
01:08:35,307 --> 01:08:36,408
[chuckles]

1242
01:08:36,441 --> 01:08:37,275
Thank you.

1243
01:08:37,977 --> 01:08:40,780
Well, on the bright side,

1244
01:08:41,981 --> 01:08:44,650
I think our parents
like each other.

1245
01:08:44,684 --> 01:08:45,918
[chuckles]

1246
01:08:45,952 --> 01:08:46,786
Who knew?

1247
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:47,720
Who knew.

1248
01:09:35,868 --> 01:09:37,870
[yawns]

1249
01:09:54,821 --> 01:09:56,789
Merry Christmas.

1250
01:09:56,823 --> 01:09:57,824
Merry Christmas.

1251
01:09:57,857 --> 01:10:00,525
[clears throat]

1252
01:10:02,829 --> 01:10:03,930
Can I ask you something?

1253
01:10:07,566 --> 01:10:09,434
You're really
religious, aren't you?

1254
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:12,437
What do you mean?

1255
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:14,874
I mean, you never
told me that you we're

1256
01:10:14,907 --> 01:10:18,811
but your parents are here
talking about the church

1257
01:10:18,845 --> 01:10:22,782
that you used to go to
and the candle thingy,

1258
01:10:22,815 --> 01:10:24,349
the picture of the cathedral.

1259
01:10:27,086 --> 01:10:28,788
I wish we could
get married there.

1260
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:35,460
Look, I'm not really religious

1261
01:10:35,493 --> 01:10:37,997
but I don't want
you to feel ashamed.

1262
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,769
Do you even think we'll
be able to get married?

1263
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:47,907
It could be something small,

1264
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:50,710
just the two of us
and the minister.

1265
01:10:50,743 --> 01:10:53,079
[church bells ring]

1266
01:10:53,112 --> 01:10:54,881
And then we can
turn ourselves in?

1267
01:10:57,482 --> 01:10:59,785
And then we can
turn ourselves in.

1268
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:09,896
I'm so happy that you're
the person I'm marrying.

1269
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:10,930
Me too.

1270
01:11:17,036 --> 01:11:18,671
[screams]

1271
01:11:18,704 --> 01:11:19,672
Hey.

1272
01:11:19,705 --> 01:11:20,505
Wait, wait, can we talk.

1273
01:11:20,538 --> 01:11:23,109
[dramatic music]

1274
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:53,139
Merry Christmas.

1275
01:11:53,172 --> 01:11:55,540
[scream]

1276
01:12:07,153 --> 01:12:08,754
Is he gonna be okay?

1277
01:12:10,022 --> 01:12:11,023
He has a pulse.

1278
01:12:11,057 --> 01:12:14,026
He's gonna need some
stitches but he'll be okay.

1279
01:12:15,527 --> 01:12:19,932
I checked for a pulse
but I guess I did it wrong.

1280
01:12:19,966 --> 01:12:21,934
Well, this certainly
is a surprise.

1281
01:12:23,869 --> 01:12:25,871
I told you something
weird was going on.

1282
01:12:27,605 --> 01:12:28,240
Dad.

1283
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:31,911
Holly, I don't wanna hear it.

1284
01:12:31,944 --> 01:12:35,881
And Nick, you two are in
a lot of trouble, okay?

1285
01:12:35,915 --> 01:12:37,917
You realize he's probably
gonna call the police,

1286
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:38,751
press charges.

1287
01:12:38,784 --> 01:12:39,617
I know I would.

1288
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:45,224
Holly dear, you invited
a random street man

1289
01:12:45,257 --> 01:12:47,559
into the house
while Nick was gone.

1290
01:12:48,626 --> 01:12:51,030
Mom, his name is Jesús.

1291
01:12:51,063 --> 01:12:54,867
He's not a street
man, he's an architect

1292
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,702
that volunteers
during the holidays.

1293
01:12:59,071 --> 01:13:02,842
I'm just saying you shouldn't
invite every Santa Claus

1294
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:05,845
from the mall into your
home for milk and cookies.

1295
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,948
Mom.

1296
01:13:08,981 --> 01:13:10,649
You can't be
behaving like this.

1297
01:13:10,683 --> 01:13:12,584
You're adults for
crying out loud.

1298
01:13:12,617 --> 01:13:14,053
You two are grounded.

1299
01:13:15,921 --> 01:13:17,723
What do you mean grounded?

1300
01:13:17,757 --> 01:13:19,992
He means you
should be punished.

1301
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,763
We're not kids anymore mom.

1302
01:13:24,663 --> 01:13:26,232
You're acting like kids.

1303
01:13:29,268 --> 01:13:31,137
This man has a life.

1304
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:38,811
He has a family wondering where
he is on Christmas morning.

1305
01:13:41,914 --> 01:13:43,816
All life is sacred.

1306
01:13:43,849 --> 01:13:46,085
Nicholas you know that!

1307
01:13:49,255 --> 01:13:50,122
[coughs]

1308
01:13:50,156 --> 01:13:51,824
It's okay, it's okay.

1309
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:52,658
You need to rest.

1310
01:13:52,691 --> 01:13:53,325
It's okay.

1311
01:13:54,293 --> 01:13:56,295
[coughs]

1312
01:13:56,328 --> 01:13:58,130
It's okay, it's okay.

1313
01:13:58,164 --> 01:13:59,999
I'm a doctor.

1314
01:14:00,032 --> 01:14:01,067
Where am I?

1315
01:14:02,168 --> 01:14:03,836
Hey.

1316
01:14:03,869 --> 01:14:05,304
Hey, it's me Holly.

1317
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:07,973
We met the other day.

1318
01:14:08,007 --> 01:14:10,009
I invited you here for...

1319
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:11,043
Cookies.

1320
01:14:14,947 --> 01:14:15,981
Yeah.

1321
01:14:17,283 --> 01:14:19,852
You're still here actually.

1322
01:14:20,786 --> 01:14:25,590
There was a really bad accident
and a misunderstanding.

1323
01:14:27,993 --> 01:14:28,961
What time is it?

1324
01:14:31,163 --> 01:14:33,232
6:30 in the morning.

1325
01:14:35,434 --> 01:14:38,137
Oh, Merry Christmas.

1326
01:14:39,105 --> 01:14:40,306
[everyone] Merry Christmas.

1327
01:14:41,373 --> 01:14:46,178
Listen Jesús, we hurt you

1328
01:14:46,212 --> 01:14:48,714
really, really
badly on accident.

1329
01:14:51,117 --> 01:14:52,351
We thought you were dead.

1330
01:14:52,384 --> 01:14:54,353
And we didn't know what to do.

1331
01:14:54,386 --> 01:14:56,021
We panicked.

1332
01:14:56,055 --> 01:14:57,356
And everybody in town's
angry at Holly for the video

1333
01:14:57,389 --> 01:14:58,824
and we're sorry.

1334
01:15:00,759 --> 01:15:02,261
Wait, it's 6:30?

1335
01:15:05,097 --> 01:15:06,132
Yeah.

1336
01:15:07,133 --> 01:15:09,301
I wanna go see my daughter
before I start my shift.

1337
01:15:09,335 --> 01:15:11,137
Honey no, no, no, no.

1338
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,805
Honey, honey, no, no, no, no.

1339
01:15:12,838 --> 01:15:13,939
Shift?

1340
01:15:13,973 --> 01:15:16,775
No, you need stitches
and some rest.

1341
01:15:17,943 --> 01:15:20,146
And if you wanna press
charges for what we did to you

1342
01:15:20,179 --> 01:15:21,647
I think it's...

1343
01:15:23,115 --> 01:15:25,084
I'm really glad
you're gonna be okay.

1344
01:15:28,454 --> 01:15:31,790
Well, of course I
would press charges

1345
01:15:36,996 --> 01:15:40,065
but it's Christmas and I
want to have a happy day.

1346
01:15:41,767 --> 01:15:45,271
And if you're not all
happy, how can I be?

1347
01:15:48,207 --> 01:15:50,910
So you're not gonna
call the police?

1348
01:15:50,943 --> 01:15:53,445
There's not a day in the
year when people give more.

1349
01:15:56,115 --> 01:16:00,119
Can I just do my shift and
get the stitches after?

1350
01:16:00,152 --> 01:16:02,054
They're always
short-staffed on Christmas

1351
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:03,122
and...

1352
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:09,061
Oh shoot, I'm gonna
need a new costume.

1353
01:16:09,995 --> 01:16:13,832
They'll replace it
with a brand new one.

1354
01:16:13,866 --> 01:16:15,301
Real fur too.

1355
01:16:18,537 --> 01:16:20,339
And they'll pay
for your stitches.

1356
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:25,077
And any other related
medical expenses.

1357
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:33,786
Also, would you and your
daughter like to join us

1358
01:16:33,819 --> 01:16:35,287
for dinner tonight?

1359
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:38,023
I'm making my casserole
and I can make some extra.

1360
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:41,160
Thank you.

1361
01:16:42,094 --> 01:16:43,229
But we were supposed to go over

1362
01:16:43,262 --> 01:16:45,197
to my brother's
house after my shift.

1363
01:16:46,265 --> 01:16:47,766
Your shift?

1364
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,369
Don't worry about
your shift, okay?

1365
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:52,471
I think I know someone
that can cover it.

1366
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:00,212
[bells ringing]

1367
01:17:00,246 --> 01:17:01,113
Merry Christmas.

1368
01:17:01,146 --> 01:17:02,414
Merry Chri...

1369
01:17:02,448 --> 01:17:03,449
Happy, okay.

1370
01:17:05,251 --> 01:17:06,085
Babe, I don't...

1371
01:17:07,253 --> 01:17:10,089
Maybe I should go
inside, maybe it's me.

1372
01:17:10,122 --> 01:17:11,423
Okay well, then go inside.

1373
01:17:11,457 --> 01:17:12,224
Babe...

1374
01:17:12,258 --> 01:17:13,225
Merry Christmas.

1375
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:14,760
Merry Christmas.

1376
01:17:15,928 --> 01:17:17,029
Happy holidays.

1377
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:19,932
We need money guys.

1378
01:17:19,965 --> 01:17:20,566
[chuckles]

1379
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:22,234
Yeah, we do.

1380
01:17:22,268 --> 01:17:23,202
A lot.

1381
01:17:23,235 --> 01:17:24,136
Yeah.

1382
01:17:24,169 --> 01:17:25,204
It is your parents' fault.

1383
01:17:25,237 --> 01:17:26,138
It is not.

1384
01:17:26,171 --> 01:17:28,474
It is your parents fault.

1385
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,211
Merry Chri...

1386
01:17:32,244 --> 01:17:33,045
Oh, come on!

1387
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:34,179
Hey, relax.

1388
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,181
Thank you.

1389
01:17:36,215 --> 01:17:37,149
Merry Christmas.

1390
01:17:37,182 --> 01:17:39,084
Babe, we gotta pay
for our almost-murder.

1391
01:17:39,118 --> 01:17:40,252
I'm not paying for anything.

1392
01:17:40,286 --> 01:17:41,287
You're the one that did it.

1393
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,221
I did not.

1394
01:17:42,254 --> 01:17:43,188
- Yes, you did.
- I did not!

1395
01:17:43,222 --> 01:17:44,323
It's your fault. You
let him in the house.

1396
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:45,257
You shut it.

1397
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,425
I went to go get you a cake.

1398
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:50,296
[Christmas music]

1399
01:18:01,273 --> 01:18:02,975
All right, okay.

1400
01:18:05,411 --> 01:18:07,012
Oh, Joseph White.

1401
01:18:08,347 --> 01:18:10,349
This bag is beautiful.

1402
01:18:10,382 --> 01:18:12,318
Well, you did send
me the link to buy it.

1403
01:18:12,351 --> 01:18:13,185
I know.

1404
01:18:14,353 --> 01:18:15,187
Thank you.

1405
01:18:17,289 --> 01:18:18,290
[chuckles]

1406
01:18:18,324 --> 01:18:19,224
Whatever.

1407
01:18:19,258 --> 01:18:21,226
I can't wait to marry you.

1408
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,195
And I can't wait to marry you.

1409
01:18:23,228 --> 01:18:25,297
[chuckles]

1410
01:18:27,232 --> 01:18:29,401
[Mary] Dinner is
almost ready guys.

1411
01:18:29,435 --> 01:18:31,036
[Eve] Absolutely.

1412
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:32,471
[Joe] It smells delicious.

1413
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:34,540
[Rudy] And why don't we take
a look at the house first?

1414
01:18:34,573 --> 01:18:36,308
[laughing]

1415
01:18:36,342 --> 01:18:38,377
Real funny dad.
