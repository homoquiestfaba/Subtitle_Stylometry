1
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:29,817
- 'Bye, Dad.
- 'Bye, Em.

2
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,222
Oh, come on. I just had it.

3
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:14,894
It's got to be here. Hey, honey,
have you seen the Stainer file?

4
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,570
- No, I haven't.
- It's got to be around here someplace.

5
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,970
Wait a minute.

6
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:26,536
I'm so Late.

7
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:30,609
Oh, boy. Okay, all
right, got everything.

8
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:33,616
All right. Okay, sport,
you have a good day.

9
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,023
- Happy birthday, Pops.
- Thanks.

10
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:03,708
There you go, Dixie.
You're safe with me now.

11
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:28,065
"My darling Jordan: I've missed you so.

12
00:04:29,177 --> 00:04:31,168
"I've returned from camp early.

13
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:37,676
"It was just too infantile
for a 14-year-old Like me.

14
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:41,584
"Life is complicated
when you Look Like...

15
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,349
"...Claudia Schiffer.

16
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,421
"Ta-ta for now.

17
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,597
"Jenny."

18
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,683
Come on, honey, Let's get that
care package mailed off to your sister.

19
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:13,749
Just a sec, Mom.

20
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,213
It's cute. Aunt Lisa gave it to me.

21
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:18,975
It's Lame, Mom. No offense.

22
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,850
I'm running to the market.
Remember, we're going to the mall Later.

23
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,491
Tiny Sprouts.

24
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,523
Okay.

25
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:33,024
I'm out of here. Love you.

26
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:45,138
Pull it up, No, up!

27
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:48,378
Dearest Emily:

28
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,442
We thought we'd give you an update
of the goings-on at camp,

29
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:55,851
We've been here for a month now,
and we realized something,

30
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:57,117
Basically...

31
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:58,988
We rule this place,

32
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:03,391
Pull it back, you invalid,

33
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,736
While you've been training
for the midget symphony...

34
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,869
...we've been doing
rigorous training of our own,

35
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:17,904
As a warm-up for my in-person
encounter with the e-mail man,

36
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:23,445
It's crucial that you, too,
change the focus of your summer studies,

37
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,184
Remember Harold,
the loser we saw eating his own snot...

38
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:30,587
...at the life-saving movie?

39
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:35,220
Check him out a year later,

40
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:36,352
Emily,

41
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,763
My heart aches for the vision
of your beauteousness,

42
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,267
I heard you're developing into
a beautiful young woman and...

43
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:46,062
That's enough, Less is more,

44
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,773
Call me,

45
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:53,144
Get your heinie back here
for the last two weeks of camp,

46
00:07:53,214 --> 00:07:55,614
You can brush up for your audition
when you get home,

47
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,151
And that, Emily Lin, is the master plan,

48
00:07:58,285 --> 00:08:00,310
- Love, Laurel,
- And Jenny,

49
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:03,989
P.S. Wwhap the o wit wwa!

50
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:05,858
Hit it, Shane,

51
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:08,522
'Bye, Emily! 'Bye!

52
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:13,757
I love you!

53
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,046
Thirty-five days until the swamp thing
is expected to hatch,

54
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:36,351
Today we're shopping for its bassinet,
My rabbit cage would serve the purpose,

55
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,118
The mother-to-be thinks not, I know,

56
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,022
The wounded toenail is much better,

57
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:49,063
I'll be playing the Mendelssohn
for the orchestra,

58
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:51,964
It's what my teacher played
to get into the symphony,

59
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,536
It requires a ton of
work, and I don't think

60
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:57,033
I'll be able to make camp this summer,

61
00:08:58,212 --> 00:09:02,114
About Harold, I'd like to know
if he plays an instrument,

62
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:05,250
And don't worry, even
though the distance

63
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:07,383
may part us, I'll still never forget:

64
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,383
Wwhap the o wit wwa!

65
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,988
Okay, 'Bye,

66
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:43,646
- Do you think she can fix this?
- I don't know if she can fix that.

67
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:52,791
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, Emily.

68
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,408
All right, Lea, you're first.

69
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:14,284
Divulge your secret.

70
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:18,052
I found a kitten. I named her Dixie,
and she's Living in my room.

71
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,227
The thing is, I'm not allowed.

72
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:24,312
My sister's allergic,
so I can't tell her.

73
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:26,428
But I had to tell someone.

74
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,329
Did you get kitty Litter?

75
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:38,871
Look at all those kids.

76
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:41,447
Those are toddlers. I am pre-adolescent.

77
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,077
I'm counting down for takeoff.

78
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,487
- Congratulations. Where to?
- China.

79
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,891
I'm digging there.

80
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:59,055
You'll be my contact here at base.
Your codename is SK-14.

81
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,727
Once I've departed,
you'll deliver a message to my parents.

82
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:06,500
Tell them I'm safe,
but not where I've gone to.

83
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:11,167
Can I count on you, SK-14?

84
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:13,175
Your secret's safe with me.

85
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,583
This is Jenny's. I gave it to her.

86
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:22,648
Can it be restrung?

87
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:27,153
You saved my Life when you repaired
my mom's antique brooch.

88
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,923
Don't worry,
Jenny never wears it anymore.

89
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,625
When she gets back from camp,
she'll never even realize it's missing.

90
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,692
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

91
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:37,534
You're the best.

92
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:40,990
Is it stealing if you
use the money to buy

93
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,373
a gift for the person you stole from?

94
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,642
What did you do?

95
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,939
I got my Dad cologne at Greenbacks
for his birthday...

96
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,245
...with the money I
stole from his wallet.

97
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:55,482
Next time you should make him a gift.
Parents Love that.

98
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,585
Anything else, Gregory?

99
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:05,454
I used the change to buy candy,
and I'm not allowed to have anything...

100
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,762
...besides fruit juice gummy bears.

101
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:10,664
So I hid it in my sleeping bag case.

102
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:15,265
You have nothing to worry about. Parents
snoop under drawers and mattresses.

103
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:17,674
Your hiding place
shows a stroke of brilliance.

104
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:25,349
We just moved here.
Wait till next week to destroy it.

105
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,486
Go upstairs and unpack, okay?

106
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:32,087
Mom, I can't find my tennis shoes.

107
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,957
- Look harder, David.
- Dad, I've Looked everywhere.

108
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,930
He can't go off to tennis camp tomorrow
without tennis shoes.

109
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,466
Just give me a sec to
find my keys, okay?

110
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:54,541
- Look at the little bears.
- I Love that.

111
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,713
Emily. Which one do you Like?

112
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:32,047
I'm trying to think neutral, since we
don't know the baby's sex, but...

113
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:34,285
This one, but I'm
getting claustrophobic.

114
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:36,418
I'll wait outside.

115
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:02,774
Excuse me.

116
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:06,815
My mom abandoned me in a Linen sale
and I'm Lost.

117
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,716
Can you tell me where
the escalators are?

118
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:15,692
It's complicated. Listen carefully.
Take about ten steps that way.

119
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:22,333
Thanks.

120
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,777
- Do you play an instrument?
- Yeah.

121
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,505
The harmonica.

122
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:13,112
- Checking out the neighborhood. 'Bye.
- Easy.

123
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,531
Nature calls. Grab the
stuff out of the trunk.

124
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:47,544
I'm not going to make it!

125
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,637
Who are you? And what are you doing?

126
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,140
None of your business.

127
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:17,309
Of course it's my business.
These are my mother's roses.

128
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,813
What is this?

129
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:22,786
Nothing.

130
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:29,258
It's a knight. Part of a chess set.
Looks expensive.

131
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,599
Irreplaceable. I have news for you:

132
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,260
There are things
that make sense to cover up.

133
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:39,499
Like drinking glasses, dishes, maybe
costume jewelry that's rarely even worn.

134
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:43,868
If you think your parents won't notice
their missing chess piece...

135
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:45,309
...you're wrong.

136
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:49,440
They'll think the movers lost it.

137
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:53,917
They'll be upset,
but they won't be able to blame me.

138
00:16:57,591 --> 00:17:00,890
If you want to properly conceal
the evidence come with me.

139
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:09,894
Come on.

140
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,650
- I need your name.
- Philip.

141
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:36,058
Did you just say, "fill it up"?

142
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,567
No, I said, "Philip."
Like P-H-I-L-I-P.

143
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:43,701
You mean, Philip.

144
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,407
- Where'd you get that strange accent?
- Chicago.

145
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,475
Interesting. I'm Emily.

146
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:54,769
A milli-what?
Like a millimeter or millipede?

147
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,913
I don't get it.

148
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,211
Emily, Like Emily Dickinson
or Emily Bronte.

149
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,384
Who are they?

150
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,650
Only the most famous female poet
and author ever to Live.

151
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:12,055
You owe me 50 cents.

152
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:14,593
- For what?
- My services.

153
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:17,637
I've Labeled your item
in case you ever need it back.

154
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,043
Okay, there you go.

155
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:34,752
Wait, is there tons of broken
stuff in there of other people?

156
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:39,115
Is that what those kids were doing
waiting in Line?

157
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:43,254
They tell me their secrets,
which often involve broken merchandise.

158
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,561
How does somebody become
a professional secret keeper?

159
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:50,365
I didn't know anybody
who could keep a secret...

160
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:53,637
...and I've never spoiled a secret
in my entire Life.

161
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:55,902
So I knew it was a marketable skill.

162
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,168
Anything of yours in there?

163
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:04,413
You know my secret.

164
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:08,485
Didn't you hear me?
I keep secrets. I don't share them.

165
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:10,455
Especially my own.

166
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,423
The girls Look Like
they're having fun at camp.

167
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,163
I'm not sure about Harold,
but I think you should go up there.

168
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:27,432
I don't believe you, Mom.
You watched my video?

169
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:30,237
You Left it on the coffee table.
I was curious.

170
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,437
That's worse than reading my mail.

171
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,574
I'm sorry, Emily, I didn't know.

172
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:39,745
Rather than ship me off, why can't you
encourage me for what really matters?

173
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,885
You have our encouragement.

174
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:44,319
Can I please be excused?

175
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:46,081
I have to change.

176
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,185
Kurt Bester's conducting Innovators
in Washington, D.C.

177
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:52,791
It's Live on PBS.
Samuel Cardon is the guest performer.

178
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,066
Neil is on his way over.
We're watching the Braves.

179
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,439
- I thought you knew.
- I've been planning this all week.

180
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:01,497
Can't you watch it someplace else?

181
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,608
Where do you suggest we go?

182
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,408
A sports bar?

183
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,716
You'd let your new child watch
whatever it wanted whenever.

184
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:10,841
Emily!

185
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:15,649
Why don't I tape the concert
while we're watching the game?

186
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:17,952
I know you can do it.

187
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:24,760
- I know it can be done.
- It's not the same if it isn't Live.

188
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,228
Who has ever heard of a family
with only one TV?

189
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,841
Please be home.

190
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:17,406
I can't believe this.

191
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:22,054
It'll turn up when we unpack the rest,
or find that missing box of photos.

192
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:24,386
Or all of David's tennis clothes.

193
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:27,118
It's over 100 years old.
You know what that's worth?

194
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:30,721
- Probably those packers.
- Come on, Don. Worry about it tomorrow.

195
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:33,459
Pop the champagne.
Let's christen our new home.

196
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,936
Hey! Look on the bright side. Burglars
could have stolen the whole thing.

197
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:44,694
Hello.

198
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:46,415
Hi. I'm Emily Lindstrom.
I Live next door.

199
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,414
- Maybe Philip told you about me.
- What are you doing here?

200
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:52,713
You didn't tell us you made
a friend already. Come on in.

201
00:21:56,556 --> 00:22:00,390
I'm Elaine and this is my husband Don.
Emily is our next door neighbor.

202
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,452
- Hi.
- Hi. It's extremely nice to meet you.

203
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:09,425
This might sound odd,
but could I borrow your TV?

204
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:14,604
Just to watch something.
The program is just about to start.

205
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:18,337
We don't have cable yet, but we can
set the TV up with rabbit ears.

206
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:28,550
I don't get it. Don't you have a TV?

207
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:33,758
My Dad thinks the Braves are
more important than the concert series.

208
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,690
You hear that, Phil?
That means classical music.

209
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:39,093
- Philip!
- Don't worry.

210
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:41,759
I wouldn't expect your son
to appreciate fine music.

211
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:44,804
When Phil's nana died,
she Left him her baby grand piano.

212
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:47,965
I've been trying to get him
to take Lessons for two years now.

213
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,306
So, Emily, do you have
brothers and sisters?

214
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:54,808
No. Yes, soon.

215
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:59,881
My parents always wanted another child,
but my mom couldn't get pregnant.

216
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:04,055
Now, at 40-something,
the miracle baby is on its way.

217
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,792
We have Philip. He's 12.

218
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:12,055
- 12 and a half.
- David's packing for camp. He's 15.

219
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:14,323
- And you're...
- 14.

220
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:19,638
- I got it.
- Channel 11, please.

221
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:21,462
Okay.

222
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:27,007
There you go.

223
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:32,818
I didn't mean to intrude on
your first night in your new home.

224
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:36,014
No, Emily. It's a pleasure having you.

225
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:38,649
If you were 21,
we'd invite you to toast with us.

226
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:41,091
Come on, honey, Let's get back to work.

227
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,859
So what are you doing?

228
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:52,396
I wouldn't normally tell a stranger,
but since I'm in your house...

229
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:56,474
I Like to pretend that
I'm in the symphony.

230
00:23:56,543 --> 00:24:00,138
I get the piece and
practice all week and...

231
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,608
...you'll see. Can you hold this?

232
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:06,414
Live from Washington, D, C...

233
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:09,017
Why don't you just get into a symphony?

234
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,580
Kurt Bestor conducts Innovators,

235
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,609
Who's this?

236
00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:47,823
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

237
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:23,125
I'm in Love, Pauline.
Samuel Cardon is a dream in concert.

238
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,687
That's not Love, Emily.

239
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:31,030
True. I have stronger feelings
for Kurt Bestor.

240
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,868
Maybe we should shift your focus
from musicians to music.

241
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,931
The Mendelssohn, to be precise.

242
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,909
Okay, just one more thing.

243
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:41,379
I don't know if this
is asking too much.

244
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,045
You sounded great.

245
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:46,449
Is there any way
you can get me into the concert?

246
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:51,081
We could go together, and you could
visit your friends backstage.

247
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,282
Then maybe I'd get to meet Kurt?

248
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,319
I wish I could, Em, but I used up my
favors for the year. Let's begin.

249
00:25:58,698 --> 00:25:59,687
Okay.

250
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,808
- What's up, Fill-it-up?
- Well...

251
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,272
...David's off to tennis camp,
and my mom's decorating stuff.

252
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,341
And my Dad started his new job.

253
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:23,716
- It's tough being the new kid.
- What do you want me to do about it?

254
00:26:24,023 --> 00:26:27,117
I don't know.
Take me downtown. Show me around.

255
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:29,784
Afraid not. I was just
going to practice.

256
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:32,625
Don't you have to take a break
once in a while?

257
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,494
I'll tell you what.

258
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:38,503
- Do you want to join me for high tea?
- I do.

259
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:40,632
What is it?

260
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:48,575
A lot of musicians take time out
for tea in the afternoon.

261
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,981
When my mom's gone,
I use her china to make it decadent.

262
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,441
- One or two?
- Two.

263
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:27,577
- May I?
- Yes, you may.

264
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:39,659
Cheers, Philip, darling.

265
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,817
Well, Looks Like you get what you wanted
after all.

266
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:02,611
Come to town with me
to replace the cups.

267
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:05,614
- How much money do you have?
- Almost $50.

268
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:07,859
Good. Bring it all.
We'll split the cost.

269
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,026
Guess we share a secret now.

270
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,929
Yeah. I guess we do.

271
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:48,490
Is there something particular
you're Looking for?

272
00:28:48,568 --> 00:28:51,332
The pattern we're Looking for
is called Crown Darby.

273
00:28:51,404 --> 00:28:54,271
Oh, shame. We've discontinued Darby.

274
00:28:54,874 --> 00:28:59,538
Maybe I can suggest my personal
favorite, Regal Royal, instead?

275
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:01,578
- Follow me.
- Sir!

276
00:29:01,848 --> 00:29:05,784
- It has to be that particular pattern.
- Oh, I see.

277
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,352
Has there been...

278
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,079
...an accident?

279
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,759
Can you call another Location?

280
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:17,420
Place a special order?

281
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:20,060
Send us to an estate sale?

282
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:28,272
Want to know the best kept secret
in town?

283
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:38,279
- My mom's very anal. She'll know.
- So, go home and tell her the truth.

284
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:41,549
- What's anal mean?
- She's fussy.

285
00:29:42,522 --> 00:29:45,320
If she doesn't turn it over,
she'll never suspect.

286
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:49,222
It comes in a set of four,
including the saucers for $14.99.

287
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:51,187
We only need two cups.

288
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:53,922
With you in my Life,
the extras should come in handy.

289
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,628
Yeah, they're Lovely.
We'll take them. Ready?

290
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:59,400
What are we going to do
with the extra money?

291
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:22,692
- Is he good?
- He's good.

292
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,496
Thank you.

293
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:04,201
Thank you.

294
00:31:05,438 --> 00:31:07,133
Thank you. I had a blast.

295
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:11,304
Come on. I want to show you
something amazing.

296
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,178
This is it.

297
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,692
This place is...

298
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,900
In 10 years, this chair will be mine.

299
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:45,740
Ten years?
You've already proven your talent.

300
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:48,610
Why don't you cash in
Like that guy we saw?

301
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:53,013
Become a street performer?
My aspirations are a Little higher.

302
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:57,723
My parents would never allow it.
They'd be mortified.

303
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:02,457
Are your parents as awful
as you make them sound?

304
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,621
They just don't get me.

305
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:07,626
Maybe they're not your real parents?

306
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:09,526
Why would you say that?

307
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:14,270
You might be one of those
switched-at-birth cases.

308
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,507
The truth is...

309
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:21,874
...all they seem to care about Lately
is the baby.

310
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:28,183
There are about a million things
I'd rather do than change a diaper.

311
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,581
Like watch Kurt Bestor conduct?

312
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,661
We have money Left,
why don't we get tickets to his concert?

313
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:40,425
It sold out months ago.

314
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,825
Emily.

315
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,333
Could you ever fall in Love with someone
who wasn't a conductor?

316
00:32:52,578 --> 00:32:54,842
I wouldn't mind if he were a pianist.

317
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,109
We could play Mozart's
violin and piano sonatas.

318
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,048
It would be so romantic
to make music together.

319
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:10,618
A-B-C-D-E-F-G.

320
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,222
Got it. I need you to teach me
this piece, Mrs. Neiderhoffer.

321
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,901
I thought we'd start with something
more rudimentary.

322
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:24,633
Not if you want to get paid.

323
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,769
One more.

324
00:33:29,682 --> 00:33:30,774
Guess what, Em?

325
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,318
We're throwing a party.
We'd Like you to help plan it.

326
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,546
What's the occasion?

327
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,181
End of summer, combo barbecue bash,
block party, baby shower.

328
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:39,485
In the front yard.

329
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:43,690
You're going to throw a party
for a child who hasn't been born yet?

330
00:33:43,763 --> 00:33:46,459
Can't you at Least wait
for its first birthday?

331
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:50,429
Baby showers are a tradition.
People bring Little gifts.

332
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:53,334
Stuffed animals, mobiles, blankies.

333
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:02,405
This is going to be
the most spoiled child on earth.

334
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:04,444
Speaking of spoiled children...

335
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:07,543
This spoiled child
would Like to eat dinner in peace.

336
00:34:08,788 --> 00:34:10,653
Emily, come back here.

337
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:16,328
- We're doing something wrong.
- It's not just us.

338
00:34:17,463 --> 00:34:20,261
She doesn't tell us anything.
She's so secretive.

339
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:24,636
You know what we should do?

340
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:27,402
We should tell her a secret.

341
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,468
Each tell her a secret of our own.

342
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,787
They're so pretty and soft.

343
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:49,943
You're sure this is
cool with the 'rents?

344
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:52,292
They're Like total animal Lovers.

345
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:00,902
Thanks.

346
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:05,533
"Dear Jenny: I hope
your modeling shoot went well.

347
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:09,905
"I can't wait to see the pictures.
I have good news.

348
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,050
"My dad has business
in your neighborhood...

349
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,751
"...and we'll finally get to meet
Like we've planned.

350
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:19,550
"I'll be at your house
next Wednesday at 2:00."

351
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:30,259
Holy guacamole!

352
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:35,540
I'm kind of in a hurry, Emily.

353
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,936
- Okay. Who's first?
- Me.

354
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:43,514
- I'm aborting my mission.
- I never thought of you as a quitter.

355
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:46,511
A shift of focus, SK-14.

356
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:50,784
I believe that we're not
the first society...

357
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:52,753
...to inhabit Cedar Street.

358
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:56,325
If word gets out,
anthropologists could take over my plot.

359
00:35:56,796 --> 00:36:00,357
I don't know who can be trusted
these days, except for you.

360
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:08,838
I've been e-mailing Jordan,
and he buys that I'm Jenny.

361
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,970
He's coming to meet me. I mean, her.

362
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:16,478
I mean, do you think
I could pass for 14 in this outfit?

363
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,432
Why are you in such
a hurry to grow up?

364
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:20,315
Because being 9 stinks.

365
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,287
Not as I remember it.

366
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:25,619
Anyway, that's no excuse for
spoiling this for your sister.

367
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:29,551
Why don't you e-mail Jordan
and tell him your entire scam?

368
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:31,721
Plead with him not to tell Jenny.

369
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:35,198
Explain to him that it could
put your Life in danger.

370
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:38,100
I could've thought of that.
Don't you have a better idea?

371
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,104
Like what? Tell him she died?

372
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,441
Dixie got a sister: Noreen.

373
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:48,843
I was at Greenbacks getting Litter
and a Lady was giving her away.

374
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:53,379
- Are you sure it's not a boy?
- How am I supposed to tell?

375
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:55,511
If Dixie gets pregnant, that's a way.

376
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,987
It'd be a dream come true.

377
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:58,816
I'd better start planning
for their future.

378
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,150
I'll keep you posted.

379
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,685
Ants.

380
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,856
Get rid of the candy.
Then go to the market and ask for Raid.

381
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:08,150
Then get yourself an
airtight container for

382
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:10,368
future stashes. I
recommend Tupperware.

383
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,425
Go! Go!

384
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:33,358
- I want to share a secret with you.
- Oh, yeah?

385
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:36,559
You want to find out what we're having?

386
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,067
Is that its face?

387
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:49,333
Well, no. Actually, that's its butt.

388
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,807
Then stop calling it, it. Tell us!

389
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:59,381
Having your first child in your 40s
is a remarkable thing.

390
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:05,880
Beautiful, isn't she?

391
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:15,533
If you ladies will
excuse me for a second.

392
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,033
I'll be right back, Caroline.
Everything looks real good.

393
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:28,041
You told him. How could you do that?

394
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:34,479
He's my doctor.
For health reasons, he has to know.

395
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:38,216
- It's my first successful pregnancy.
- What if he tells somebody?

396
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:44,590
I don't know why you think
of your adoption as such a negative.

397
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:51,698
We always said you could tell
on your own terms.

398
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:55,435
We never thought that would mean
not telling.

399
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:59,741
It's my secret, Mom.
I intend to keep it that way.

400
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:14,122
What do you think of the name Pauline?

401
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:20,890
I've always thought Martha
was a nice, solid name.

402
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,065
That's terrible.

403
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,167
How about Elizabeth?

404
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:30,339
They'd call her Libby, or Beth...

405
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:33,310
...or Lizzy.

406
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,372
Grace?

407
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:48,181
Grace.

408
00:40:13,052 --> 00:40:14,451
Can I come out?

409
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:24,087
This tortures your mom, you know.

410
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,958
She thinks you're going to tumble
to your death.

411
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:28,693
I Love it out here.

412
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,306
I...

413
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:39,473
...came out to tell you
something about myself.

414
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:42,671
A secret of my own.

415
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:44,713
What's up, Daddy?

416
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:51,383
I'm scared.

417
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:55,989
Scared of being a new father at 50.

418
00:40:57,963 --> 00:40:59,897
You sure don't act Like it.

419
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,063
Does Mom know about this?

420
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:09,740
Emily, this is a miracle baby.

421
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:13,801
I don't want to make your mom
feel unsure about my commitment...

422
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:17,108
...or the Love that I have to offer
a newborn.

423
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,414
And your mother is much younger
than I am.

424
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:25,286
I'm going to be an old man
by the time he or she goes to college...

425
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,757
...gets married, you know, all that.

426
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:31,623
This baby's going to keep you young.

427
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:34,360
That's what it's going to do.

428
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:46,475
I'm sorry I've been so impossible.

429
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:49,340
I'm really going to try
and be more accepting.

430
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,189
Shall we?

431
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:16,060
- Ladies and gents,
- The Wit Wwa Rap.

432
00:43:16,335 --> 00:43:18,132
Let's do it,

433
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,441
- "I'm Laurel
- "I'm Jenny

434
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,510
"Here's where Emmy should be

435
00:43:36,255 --> 00:43:37,813
"Wwhap the o wit wwa

436
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,121
"Come along, come along

437
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,486
"Wwhap the o wit wwa

438
00:43:42,895 --> 00:43:46,695
"We're together, so together
Yeah, together we'll be

439
00:43:46,765 --> 00:43:50,792
"What does the wit wwa mean?
It's a secret, you'll see

440
00:43:51,136 --> 00:43:55,630
"What does the wit wwa mean?
Don't you dare ask me

441
00:43:56,408 --> 00:44:00,606
"We miss you so much
now that we're two, not three

442
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:07,050
"We're together forever
Together we'll be"

443
00:44:07,452 --> 00:44:10,319
We love you,
'Bye, Emily, we love you, We miss you,

444
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:14,490
Andale, Andale. More, yeah,

445
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,620
Emily, wwhap the o wit wwa,

446
00:44:18,797 --> 00:44:21,095
You've got to tell me what that means.

447
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,724
What are you doing here?

448
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:25,599
We had plans, remember?
The door was open.

449
00:44:26,939 --> 00:44:29,407
So, what does "wit wwa" mean?

450
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,007
- That's between me and my friends.
- I'll do anything.

451
00:44:33,078 --> 00:44:35,808
No, Phil. It's personal, okay?
So just drop it.

452
00:44:38,417 --> 00:44:42,183
If you do me a favor, maybe I'll
forgive you for invading my privacy.

453
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:50,360
Bet it's a scrambled word.
I'm good at figuring out that stuff.

454
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:54,559
Would you just drop it?
You're starting to bug me.

455
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:56,362
Do you know how to use a camera?

456
00:44:56,435 --> 00:44:59,268
This is the 21st century.
I can edit, too.

457
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:03,040
Introduce yourself to my girlfriends
at camp.

458
00:45:03,108 --> 00:45:07,909
Hello, ladies, my name is Philip, aka
Fill-it-up Lenox, new kid on the block,

459
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,881
I will be filming the virtuoso today,

460
00:45:14,653 --> 00:45:16,280
The Mendelssohn,

461
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:06,169
Bravo! How'd you Like that, sweetie?

462
00:46:06,238 --> 00:46:09,537
Going to grow up and become a musician
Like your big sister?

463
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:16,377
I don't know what you're planning.

464
00:46:16,448 --> 00:46:19,781
I think more than one child per family
is irresponsible.

465
00:46:19,885 --> 00:46:24,015
I loved having brothers and sisters.
I used to play Brahms' Lullaby...

466
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:27,422
...for my baby brother every night
until he was 5.

467
00:46:27,726 --> 00:46:29,057
- Really?
- Yeah.

468
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:34,164
But children of my own
are not in the near future.

469
00:46:34,266 --> 00:46:36,757
Oh, no, Pauline, you
have to have children.

470
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:40,327
It would be genetically predisposed
to be a prodigy.

471
00:46:40,806 --> 00:46:43,274
Or at least first violinist
in the symphony.

472
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:49,537
Kurt Bestor comes from a lineage
of Irish accordion players.

473
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:53,114
What's wrong?

474
00:46:56,188 --> 00:47:01,057
Maybe we should forget
about Mendelssohn and Bestor...

475
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:03,924
...and the symphony for a moment.

476
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:09,556
Try this.

477
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,981
- That was really wonderful, Emily.
- That's how Mikey Chan got so smart.

478
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:03,749
His parents played vocabulary tapes
to the womb.

479
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,352
I have a feeling that
Grace will be a flutist.

480
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:14,692
Wit what wat.

481
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,590
The o wit wwa.

482
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,677
- Which...
- David?

483
00:48:29,247 --> 00:48:30,805
David, slow down.

484
00:48:49,534 --> 00:48:51,661
It's just so unlike him. He is...

485
00:48:53,371 --> 00:48:56,033
That's Emily. We have plans.

486
00:48:56,741 --> 00:48:58,333
Tell her it's not a good night.

487
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,401
It's okay. Go ahead.

488
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:02,875
So what are we supposed to do?
Can we get him?

489
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:05,576
No. David's okay,
that's the important thing.

490
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,688
So I realize I have a
massive responsibility.

491
00:49:12,757 --> 00:49:16,716
She's going to need guidance from
somebody who knows about pop culture.

492
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:19,093
That's not going to be
from Eddie and Caroline.

493
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,758
The thought of it
is still making you want to barf?

494
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,596
- You can tell?
- Phil!

495
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:29,840
- Do you guys want a slice?
- No. We're going to take a walk.

496
00:49:34,546 --> 00:49:35,877
What's going on?

497
00:49:37,249 --> 00:49:39,717
- Nothing.
- Yeah, right.

498
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:42,177
It's a secret.

499
00:49:51,463 --> 00:49:55,229
- Do you really want to know?
- If it's okay with your parents.

500
00:49:57,702 --> 00:49:59,670
Okay. We'll make a deal.

501
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,064
You tell me the mystery
of the wit wwa in return.

502
00:50:03,141 --> 00:50:04,472
Forget it.

503
00:50:04,676 --> 00:50:08,669
It's a big secret.
After I tell you, you'll feel obligated.

504
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,207
Try me.

505
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:20,151
My brother's getting kicked out
of tennis camp.

506
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,715
No way! What did he do?

507
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:25,961
He and some guys "borrowed"
the camp van...

508
00:50:26,598 --> 00:50:29,123
...and got beer.
But David said he only had one.

509
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,862
Are you serious? Was David driving?

510
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,599
The other guy was...

511
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:37,870
...and he wasn't really drunk
according to some tests.

512
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:40,575
But he doesn't have a driver's license.

513
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,840
That's not all. They
hit someone head-on.

514
00:50:45,817 --> 00:50:47,512
David's not hurt, but...

515
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,520
...this woman, she's a waitress.

516
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,551
She broke a couple of ribs
and totaled her car.

517
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,019
My parents don't want
anyone here to know.

518
00:50:59,464 --> 00:51:02,024
They think David will
get a bad reputation.

519
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:06,530
- He'll probably be grounded for Life.
- He should be thrown in jail.

520
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:09,731
David wasn't even driving.

521
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:13,107
What's the difference?
He let his stupid friend drive drunk.

522
00:51:13,545 --> 00:51:16,605
- They didn't kill anybody.
- They could have.

523
00:51:24,856 --> 00:51:28,519
That's a big enough secret
to give me your side of the bargain.

524
00:51:32,097 --> 00:51:35,191
- It's not that big of a deal.
- It is to me.

525
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:39,534
Why are you so freaked? You owe me.

526
00:51:42,807 --> 00:51:44,934
"We will help and promise
to help each other...

527
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:47,205
"...wherever in the world we are."
Are you happy?

528
00:51:47,612 --> 00:51:49,443
- What?
- That's what it means.

529
00:51:49,914 --> 00:51:53,680
"We will help and promise,"
W-W-H-A-P is "wwhap."

530
00:51:53,752 --> 00:51:56,778
If you take the first letter
from each word, it works.

531
00:51:57,455 --> 00:52:00,618
- It's not grammatically correct.
- We were 8 when we wrote it.

532
00:52:00,692 --> 00:52:02,387
It was a stupid secret.

533
00:52:04,195 --> 00:52:06,891
You had no right to tell me
about your brother.

534
00:52:07,232 --> 00:52:10,258
Wait. You're not going to
tell my parents I told you?

535
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:13,861
No, but you should know
something, Philip.

536
00:52:13,972 --> 00:52:16,770
A person that will do that once
will do it again.

537
00:52:52,277 --> 00:52:54,871
- Gregory?
- What? Yes.

538
00:52:54,946 --> 00:52:56,914
I bet you'd Like
some of these gummy bears?

539
00:52:56,981 --> 00:52:58,915
Look, baby. They're on special.

540
00:52:59,084 --> 00:53:01,518
Why don't you get three? Go ahead.

541
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,314
- One's enough, Mom.
- You are a good boy.

542
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:39,586
Gotcha.

543
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:46,286
Hi, I'm Jordan. Is Jenny home?

544
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:50,629
She's already dead.

545
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,930
I'll leave these on her grave.

546
00:53:53,004 --> 00:53:56,997
And if you really want to mourn,
I'd cancel your on-Line account.

547
00:53:57,075 --> 00:54:01,011
That way you can stay loyal
to her forever. 'Bye now.

548
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:28,598
Gross.

549
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:30,004
They're totaled.

550
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:34,801
Excessive bleach caused the holes.
Use one cup and wash on medium heat.

551
00:54:35,113 --> 00:54:36,375
Over and out.

552
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:40,515
I got another one.

553
00:54:41,052 --> 00:54:44,749
- A kitten?
- A cat. A black one.

554
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:48,384
The Josephsons didn't care about her.
She was always outside.

555
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:49,926
You kidnapped Midnight?

556
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:53,486
Midnight is ordinary.
I renamed her Leticia.

557
00:54:54,232 --> 00:54:56,894
They have signs up all over.
You have to give her back.

558
00:54:56,968 --> 00:55:00,927
You can't force me,
and you better not tell on me.

559
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:05,902
I wouldn't, but if you don't let her go,
you can't be a client of mine.

560
00:55:06,711 --> 00:55:08,406
Be that way! Fine!

561
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:14,279
I'm never going to steal
from my dad again.

562
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,104
Good for you.

563
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,945
It's easier to steal
straight from the store.

564
00:55:20,258 --> 00:55:22,249
Why are you telling me this?

565
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:26,385
- I got to tell someone, right?
- This isn't confession.

566
00:55:26,598 --> 00:55:30,557
I know, but what I was thinking is
whatever you want, I'll steal for you.

567
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:34,300
- It's kind of fun.
- I earn my spending money.

568
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:37,826
We have to write the
obituary by 6:00, so

569
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:40,044
we can run it in tomorrow's Chronicle.

570
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,111
You told him that she died?

571
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,612
- It was your idea.
- I didn't mean it.

572
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,013
Now you tell me.

573
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,085
You're going to have to tell Jenny.
This is not fair to her.

574
00:55:49,487 --> 00:55:54,083
She'll never speak to me again.
It'll be Like being an only child.

575
00:55:54,158 --> 00:55:55,489
I'll tell her.

576
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:59,690
Some secret keeper you are.
I should have never trusted you.

577
00:56:00,164 --> 00:56:03,463
I won't tell. You're right, Isabelle.

578
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,564
I can't tell.

579
00:56:36,034 --> 00:56:39,993
- Who are you expecting?
- My friends just got back into town.

580
00:56:47,845 --> 00:56:51,747
- Can't you just forget what I told you?
- You keep reminding me.

581
00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:54,641
Okay. I won't talk about it anymore.

582
00:56:57,221 --> 00:56:59,212
I think I'll go for the chamomile.

583
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:05,221
We're reuniting. It's girls only.

584
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,731
I get it.

585
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:16,739
Do you mind putting this on the booth
on your way out?

586
00:57:20,411 --> 00:57:23,437
Phil, I'll see you.

587
00:57:24,082 --> 00:57:25,572
Yeah. See you.

588
00:57:38,963 --> 00:57:40,954
I thought you kissed Harold.

589
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:44,862
Well, I did. But then I met Benji.

590
00:57:45,603 --> 00:57:50,131
So she decides to drop Kip,
and hook up with Big H.

591
00:57:50,608 --> 00:57:54,044
As far as I'm concerned it was
a waste of time and meant nothing.

592
00:57:54,112 --> 00:57:55,409
I was doing it for Jordan...

593
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,812
...so I'd have some experience
when we met.

594
00:57:57,882 --> 00:58:00,544
What did he do?
Go for another subscriber?

595
00:58:01,085 --> 00:58:04,418
He's not on-Line anymore.

596
00:58:05,156 --> 00:58:07,420
He just vanished without a trace.

597
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:10,650
He didn't even say good-bye.

598
00:58:11,796 --> 00:58:13,957
I'm sorry.

599
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,600
Don't worry about it,
there's more where that came from.

600
00:58:18,603 --> 00:58:20,298
The Greenbacks' special.

601
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,371
Wwhap the o wit wwa.

602
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:25,935
Don't you think
we're getting too old for that?

603
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,807
Yeah, but who gives?

604
00:58:29,147 --> 00:58:32,116
You seem different.
Did something happen?

605
00:58:32,183 --> 00:58:33,514
Nothing happened.

606
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:50,862
I thought you were grounded.

607
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:53,328
I'm allowed to come outside, Phil.

608
00:58:53,638 --> 00:58:54,798
And besides...

609
00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:57,204
...what could Mom and Dad
take away from me?

610
00:58:57,275 --> 00:58:58,902
There's nothing to do here.

611
00:58:59,377 --> 00:59:00,969
See what I mean?

612
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:03,878
Here, kitty, kitty.

613
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:08,685
No wonder you settled for
that weirdo violinist next door.

614
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,019
Dad said she's coming over to watch
a concert tonight. I can't wait.

615
00:59:15,026 --> 00:59:16,323
Nice shot.

616
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:18,394
Go get it, man.

617
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:25,227
Doesn't matter anyway.
She's a flake. She'll forget.

618
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:35,504
Are you the violin player?

619
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:39,815
No way. I'm David.

620
00:59:40,885 --> 00:59:42,614
Her name is Emily.

621
00:59:44,222 --> 00:59:46,383
- Like Emily...
- Dickinson?

622
00:59:48,092 --> 00:59:49,582
And Emily Bronte.

623
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,760
Didn't I see you at the mall?

624
00:59:54,332 --> 00:59:56,800
- Yeah, I think.
- When?

625
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:03,301
You probably have to get back
to your lesson, Emily?

626
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,603
Yeah, I do.

627
01:00:06,511 --> 01:00:09,173
We'll see you later for
the concert, right?

628
01:00:09,947 --> 01:00:12,916
No, I'm not going to be able to make it.
I'm sorry, Philip.

629
01:00:21,459 --> 01:00:23,893
Man, she is so pretty.

630
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:27,323
I don't think so. Her
hair hangs in her face.

631
01:00:28,266 --> 01:00:30,393
You're too young, man. You can't see it.

632
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:36,729
Wait a minute. You Like her, don't you?

633
01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:38,932
Emily? I don't think so.

634
01:00:40,344 --> 01:00:44,804
- Give it up, buddy. You're 12.
- David, you got it so wrong.

635
01:00:45,383 --> 01:00:47,783
Then you won't be upset
when I make my move.

636
01:00:48,152 --> 01:00:49,244
Of course not.

637
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,983
But you should give it up. She's in Love
with some middle-aged composer.

638
01:01:17,815 --> 01:01:19,214
Excuse me.

639
01:01:21,452 --> 01:01:23,147
Can't you guys read?

640
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:27,681
It says O-N-V...

641
01:01:27,792 --> 01:01:29,919
It says, "On vacation,
" you illiterate.

642
01:01:29,994 --> 01:01:33,157
That's right. In case you guys
haven't realized, I have a Life.

643
01:01:33,364 --> 01:01:35,195
What am I supposed to do with this?

644
01:01:35,266 --> 01:01:38,099
That's up to you.
I have to get rid of the stand.

645
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,835
Who wants to give me a hand here?

646
01:01:44,108 --> 01:01:45,905
I need to tell you something.

647
01:01:46,344 --> 01:01:49,040
Let me guess. You dug up human remains.

648
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:52,513
- They're not human.
- Let it be your own secret.

649
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,914
What's going on?

650
01:01:55,686 --> 01:01:58,553
I need to get rid of this,
and nobody's willing to help.

651
01:02:02,493 --> 01:02:03,619
Where to?

652
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:29,348
- Over here?
- Yeah.

653
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,409
All right.

654
01:02:32,657 --> 01:02:36,286
- So what is this thing anyway?
- I'd rather not get into it.

655
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:38,892
Secret keeper?

656
01:02:40,064 --> 01:02:43,261
- I could tell you anything?
- I'm not in business anymore.

657
01:02:43,734 --> 01:02:47,170
I don't have to tell you a secret.
We could just hang out.

658
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,639
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

659
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,145
I appreciate your help. I just...

660
01:02:59,216 --> 01:03:01,810
I told my mom
I would go someplace with her.

661
01:03:16,434 --> 01:03:19,460
- Okay. What's up?
- What do you mean?

662
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:23,939
Why was this piece mastered
two weeks ago, and suddenly...

663
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,737
I just have a lot on my mind.

664
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,509
Put that down.

665
01:03:29,413 --> 01:03:30,402
Come here.

666
01:03:34,919 --> 01:03:36,944
So. Let's talk.

667
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:39,349
I can't, Pauline. It's a secret.

668
01:03:41,092 --> 01:03:43,890
Well, whatever it is...

669
01:03:44,462 --> 01:03:47,590
...I highly encourage you to resolve it
before Monday.

670
01:03:48,132 --> 01:03:49,292
Why Monday?

671
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,627
Your audition.

672
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,374
I'll tell you what.

673
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:04,144
I'll meet you at your house on Sunday
for a run through.

674
01:04:04,515 --> 01:04:06,745
See if you can sort out
what's bothering you.

675
01:04:06,817 --> 01:04:10,947
That would be perfect. You'll already
be at my house for the baby shower.

676
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:13,216
You better be prepared
to sign autographs.

677
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:15,520
I told everybody
you were in the symphony.

678
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,284
They're dying to meet you.

679
01:04:18,496 --> 01:04:20,020
I'll see what I can do.

680
01:04:24,335 --> 01:04:26,064
You know this piece.

681
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:30,398
The next couple of days,
relax and have fun.

682
01:04:31,275 --> 01:04:32,264
Okay?

683
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:55,162
Shouldn't you be playing tennis,
or your harmonica?

684
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:58,897
I got a lot on my mind,
so I'm taking time off.

685
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:01,767
Well, I wouldn't want to take time away
from your time off.

686
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:02,931
Emily, wait.

687
01:05:04,408 --> 01:05:07,741
- Is this about Philip?
- No, it has nothing to do with Philip.

688
01:05:08,879 --> 01:05:10,437
I have a lot on my mind, too.

689
01:05:10,514 --> 01:05:13,847
I have this big audition in two days,
and I've never played worse.

690
01:05:18,923 --> 01:05:20,891
Not that I can totally relate, but...

691
01:05:21,892 --> 01:05:24,725
Maybe you're getting distracted
by all the outside stuff.

692
01:05:25,396 --> 01:05:28,194
The competition.
That weird business you have.

693
01:05:28,265 --> 01:05:29,630
Your mom having a baby.

694
01:05:31,235 --> 01:05:34,102
When I play tennis,
I don't focus on the opponent.

695
01:05:34,371 --> 01:05:37,204
Or that fight I had with my parents.
Or any of that bull.

696
01:05:37,341 --> 01:05:38,603
It's not about that.

697
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,874
You just need to
concentrate on the music.

698
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,880
What got you started in all this?

699
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:55,989
When I was 6 years old
I started ballet Lessons.

700
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,891
And I stunk as a ballerina.

701
01:05:58,596 --> 01:06:01,827
But they played this music
that was extraordinary.

702
01:06:02,366 --> 01:06:06,166
And I thought the only way I could
hear it is if I kept going to class.

703
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,803
And then we went on a trip to see
The Nutcracker.

704
01:06:09,874 --> 01:06:11,865
And you saw the orchestra.

705
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:13,165
In the pit.

706
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:17,575
I was drawn to the violin.
It excited me.

707
01:06:17,982 --> 01:06:21,315
The manipulation of the bow,
the crafting of the instrument.

708
01:06:22,286 --> 01:06:24,379
So I quit ballet Lessons.

709
01:06:24,455 --> 01:06:28,221
I got a violin for my birthday,
and started my Lessons after that.

710
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:32,359
Come on. Get off your bike.
We can walk home together.

711
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:36,798
No. I have to go home and practice.
I'm sorry.

712
01:06:44,341 --> 01:06:46,832
So Let me get this straight.

713
01:06:47,778 --> 01:06:51,805
You think it's a Tyrannosaurus.
Are you high?

714
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:54,714
Keep it down.

715
01:06:54,952 --> 01:06:56,078
Excuse me.

716
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,249
What are you doing?

717
01:06:59,356 --> 01:07:02,291
I've cashed in on
the basic economic principle:

718
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:04,884
Supply and demand.

719
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,632
I thought you'd be happy.
I'm your protégé.

720
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:17,102
- 75 cents. That is robbery.
- Inflation. Plus, I give free lemonade.

721
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,899
This is a scam. You
don't have credentials.

722
01:07:20,511 --> 01:07:22,502
- As if you did.
- Yeah.

723
01:07:30,654 --> 01:07:32,019
As you were saying.

724
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:46,666
I Love this.

725
01:07:47,671 --> 01:07:48,660
Come in.

726
01:07:50,674 --> 01:07:51,663
Say...

727
01:07:53,177 --> 01:07:56,146
...why don't you play for our guests?
Mom would Love it.

728
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,911
I don't know, Dad.

729
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:00,706
You could use a dress rehearsal,
couldn't you?

730
01:08:03,187 --> 01:08:04,779
Okay. I'll tell Mom.

731
01:08:26,076 --> 01:08:28,374
Hi, Jordan. You getting
enough to eat, buddy?

732
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:32,113
- When is the baby due?
- Two weeks from yesterday.

733
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:36,079
The last weeks just fly.
As I'm sure you remember.

734
01:08:42,926 --> 01:08:45,759
A babe in the 'hood. I can't believe it.

735
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:48,627
Save yourself the inevitable pain.
Stay away from him.

736
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:51,361
- Oh, come on. He can't be that bad.
- She's right.

737
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:56,030
That's Philip's brother. He's bad news.

738
01:08:56,106 --> 01:08:58,301
He's just my type.

739
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:03,302
Just to Let you know,
I was forced against my will to come.

740
01:09:03,614 --> 01:09:06,276
If it was up to me,
you never would have been invited.

741
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:10,116
The only reason Gregory came
was for the cake.

742
01:09:10,421 --> 01:09:12,787
- And Mikey...
- I really could care less.

743
01:09:14,758 --> 01:09:17,676
What happened? These
kids idolized you.

744
01:09:17,677 --> 01:09:20,594
Even Isabelle didn't
want to come today.

745
01:09:20,664 --> 01:09:23,724
- Did something happen between you guys?
- Why don't you ask her?

746
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:29,132
- Why don't you go get your violin?
- I want to wait for Pauline.

747
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,533
After we open the presents,
everybody'll leave.

748
01:09:31,608 --> 01:09:33,599
Pauline will understand.

749
01:09:35,446 --> 01:09:37,038
- Hey.
- Hi, Mrs. Lindstrom.

750
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,953
This is my competition?

751
01:09:46,423 --> 01:09:48,050
What are you doing here?

752
01:09:49,193 --> 01:09:52,094
I wanted a clue. I don't get you.

753
01:09:52,362 --> 01:09:53,989
What you see is what you get.

754
01:09:56,533 --> 01:10:00,936
I'm about to play for our guests.
Would you Like to watch?

755
01:10:05,609 --> 01:10:07,873
You don't realize you're pretty, do you?

756
01:10:08,812 --> 01:10:11,508
No. I mean, I'm not.

757
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,608
Why do you always turn away?

758
01:10:18,822 --> 01:10:20,346
Because you're an idiot.

759
01:10:21,358 --> 01:10:23,826
I know about the accident.
Philip told me.

760
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:36,595
You know, for a herbal tea,
Citrus Spice is pretty zesty.

761
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:42,071
Excuse us.

762
01:10:42,312 --> 01:10:45,179
- Dude, what did I do?
- David, stop.

763
01:10:49,853 --> 01:10:51,453
You were never
supposed to tell a soul.

764
01:10:51,454 --> 01:10:52,515
Tell what?

765
01:10:52,589 --> 01:10:55,183
He told me so I would tell him a secret
of my own.

766
01:10:55,259 --> 01:10:57,250
You promised never to tell anyone.

767
01:10:57,895 --> 01:10:59,362
I trusted you.

768
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:05,530
"We will help, and promise to help each
other wherever in the world we are."

769
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:08,161
She told me your stupid saying.

770
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:17,878
I'm sorry.

771
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,789
Emily! Emily!

772
01:11:32,529 --> 01:11:36,192
- Emily, can I just explain?
- Go away!

773
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:57,381
Emily. There's someone here to see you.

774
01:11:57,554 --> 01:11:59,283
No, Mom. Nobody comes in.

775
01:12:03,427 --> 01:12:05,418
Emily. It's me, Pauline.

776
01:12:13,837 --> 01:12:15,828
- Can I come in?
- Just you.

777
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:20,109
I know all this stuff
that I can't stand knowing.

778
01:12:21,812 --> 01:12:24,042
I told something I swore I never would.

779
01:12:25,082 --> 01:12:27,516
I have a secret nobody knows about.

780
01:12:29,186 --> 01:12:32,485
- Secrets hurt.
- You have no idea.

781
01:12:33,757 --> 01:12:37,249
Yes, I do. I have one of my own.

782
01:12:37,694 --> 01:12:39,685
I don't want to know about it.

783
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:42,962
I think you should.

784
01:12:46,637 --> 01:12:49,299
I didn't want to leave the symphony.

785
01:12:51,842 --> 01:12:53,104
I was Let go.

786
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,508
I'm sorry.

787
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:02,013
When you're third chair
for five seasons...

788
01:13:03,053 --> 01:13:06,614
...you start to realize
you're not exactly a principal player.

789
01:13:07,991 --> 01:13:11,324
They brought in new musicians
from Julliard.

790
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:15,394
That's when they suggested I Leave.

791
01:13:17,534 --> 01:13:20,196
Maybe you can work hard
and make a comeback.

792
01:13:20,304 --> 01:13:22,295
It doesn't matter anymore.

793
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,838
I Love being a teacher.

794
01:13:28,412 --> 01:13:31,540
I felt ashamed by how that came about.

795
01:13:34,117 --> 01:13:35,516
I should've told you.

796
01:13:38,889 --> 01:13:43,326
Your admiration just filled me up.

797
01:13:45,095 --> 01:13:46,084
Falsely.

798
01:13:48,165 --> 01:13:50,429
Keeping it from you was wrong.

799
01:13:52,602 --> 01:13:54,297
It's held me back in many ways.

800
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:03,378
You can't keep secrets about yourself
and Lead a true Life, Emily.

801
01:14:04,881 --> 01:14:07,543
And you shouldn't encourage others
to do the same.

802
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:23,729
I have a lot of explaining to do.

803
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:30,933
Are you going to make an announcement
from the rooftop?

804
01:14:31,808 --> 01:14:33,537
I Left my violin out there.

805
01:14:34,411 --> 01:14:37,437
That's another story. But we're
still going to rehearse, right?

806
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,982
In case you've forgotten,
I have an audition tomorrow.

807
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:42,017
I'll deal with my
announcement after that.

808
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:48,347
Pauline, you want to know
why you're my role model?

809
01:14:50,627 --> 01:14:53,562
Because of your discipline, your talent,
and your poise.

810
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,792
I will get into the symphony,
and it'll be because of you.

811
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:02,869
My mentor.

812
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,661
She'll be okay, Phil.

813
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:03,930
She will.

814
01:16:41,004 --> 01:16:43,996
- I am a Liar.
- You didn't mean any harm.

815
01:16:44,074 --> 01:16:45,598
No, I am a Liar.

816
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:53,112
I didn't want you to
know it was my fault.

817
01:16:55,252 --> 01:16:56,583
I'm sorry.

818
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:20,639
- Here's some water.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.

819
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,736
It's going to be okay.

820
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:29,246
She's going to be okay.

821
01:17:29,619 --> 01:17:31,849
Come on. She's going to be all right.

822
01:17:50,774 --> 01:17:53,174
Hey, Mom's taking us to the hospital.

823
01:17:53,243 --> 01:17:55,939
No. We have something
more important to do. Come on.

824
01:17:58,315 --> 01:17:59,948
Hello, may I help you?

825
01:17:59,949 --> 01:18:01,589
We got to get something
in Jenny's room.

826
01:18:01,651 --> 01:18:04,916
Well, wait! Where are you going?

827
01:18:08,858 --> 01:18:10,223
- See it?
- No.

828
01:18:10,994 --> 01:18:12,586
What are you Looking for?

829
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,203
Got it.

830
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:43,250
Hi. We're here to check in
for Emily Lindstrom.

831
01:18:48,531 --> 01:18:52,331
If you just watch the tape,
You'll be convinced.

832
01:18:52,869 --> 01:18:56,703
Emily is the most amazing violinist
you could find for your orchestra.

833
01:18:57,874 --> 01:18:59,068
All cued up to go.

834
01:19:00,043 --> 01:19:02,603
Even if this tape shows talent...

835
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:06,981
...when we audition someone
we try to find out about them.

836
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:10,349
We ask them
where their passion comes from.

837
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,082
Why they were inclined
to choose their instrument.

838
01:19:16,993 --> 01:19:19,860
Do you remember the first time you saw
The Nutcracker?

839
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:29,969
Honey, what is it?

840
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:34,838
It's the baby.

841
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:43,180
I never even asked her why she played.

842
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:56,496
Caroline, you're doing great. Push.

843
01:20:00,904 --> 01:20:04,203
Don't forget to breathe.
You're doing great, Caroline.

844
01:20:06,109 --> 01:20:07,992
Mr. Lindstrom, Emily's okay.
She's awake.

845
01:20:07,993 --> 01:20:09,875
Oh, God.

846
01:20:09,946 --> 01:20:12,176
Just a concussion.
She's going to be fine.

847
01:20:12,749 --> 01:20:14,011
Thank you.

848
01:20:16,119 --> 01:20:18,451
- Okay, Caroline. Here we go.
- It's coming.

849
01:20:18,521 --> 01:20:19,510
Push hard.

850
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,454
Almost there. Just
about, little bit more.

851
01:20:25,261 --> 01:20:27,252
You have another beautiful daughter.

852
01:20:28,898 --> 01:20:30,388
Oh, she's beautiful.

853
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,229
Oh, baby, you did it, you did it.

854
01:20:39,242 --> 01:20:41,767
We were sitting there
and nobody knew what was going on.

855
01:20:41,845 --> 01:20:46,179
We were all devastated,
and your mom's water breaks.

856
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:47,914
No way.

857
01:20:47,984 --> 01:20:52,284
It was bizarrely good timing,
at such a bad time.

858
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:55,114
Wait, what time is it?

859
01:20:58,995 --> 01:21:00,394
I missed my audition.

860
01:21:01,364 --> 01:21:03,344
It may've been a great
experience, but you

861
01:21:03,345 --> 01:21:05,323
have many years to play in a symphony.

862
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:06,391
Yeah.

863
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,307
I'm sorry if you're disappointed
I blew our secret.

864
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:18,509
Forget about it. The only thing
that matters is what it stands for.

865
01:21:24,154 --> 01:21:26,987
- Hey, Millipede.
- Hey, Fill-it-up.

866
01:21:34,597 --> 01:21:36,758
We knew you were going to pull through.

867
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:39,130
Unfortunately, a little late.

868
01:21:43,072 --> 01:21:45,700
David and I just got back
from Symphony Hall.

869
01:21:46,009 --> 01:21:48,034
It's not a sure thing, but...

870
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:51,945
...we gave them the tape of you
playing the Mendelssohn.

871
01:21:55,485 --> 01:21:56,918
It was Philip's idea.

872
01:21:58,555 --> 01:21:59,852
You're brilliant.

873
01:22:01,257 --> 01:22:04,556
David won them over with the
story about your ballet classes.

874
01:22:13,269 --> 01:22:16,796
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

875
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:21,842
- Where's Grace?
- She's getting tests.

876
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,803
Does she Look Like Emily did
when she was born?

877
01:22:30,019 --> 01:22:31,350
They wouldn't know.

878
01:22:38,661 --> 01:22:39,992
I was adopted.

879
01:22:52,408 --> 01:22:55,741
My biological parents were hit head-on
by a drunk driver.

880
01:23:01,317 --> 01:23:03,285
I was in the back seat.

881
01:23:04,487 --> 01:23:06,819
It's a miracle that I lived.

882
01:23:10,426 --> 01:23:14,055
I was just a baby. Ten months old.

883
01:23:17,567 --> 01:23:19,364
I never even knew them.

884
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:27,675
It was always easy
to keep my secret because...

885
01:23:29,512 --> 01:23:32,037
...we moved from Minneapolis
when I was 6 and...

886
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:35,745
...I threatened to run away
if they ever told anybody.

887
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:38,247
Well, you found other
reasons to run away.

888
01:23:42,091 --> 01:23:44,116
I'm really glad I came back.

889
01:23:52,435 --> 01:23:55,427
All right, troops. Everybody out.
The doc's on his way in.

890
01:23:55,505 --> 01:23:57,996
He's going to give Emily
some routine tests.

891
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:00,008
- I Love you, guys.
- We do, too.

892
01:24:02,011 --> 01:24:03,876
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye, Em.

893
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:05,674
I'll bring Grace back.

894
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,991
What happened to the drunk driver?

895
01:24:28,071 --> 01:24:29,538
He served a year.

896
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:33,607
Not even a month Later,
he got into another accident.

897
01:24:35,478 --> 01:24:37,139
That time he killed himself.

898
01:24:41,651 --> 01:24:43,642
I will never do it again.

899
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:45,819
Never.

900
01:24:48,157 --> 01:24:50,648
I wish I knew what to say
to make you believe me.

901
01:24:52,729 --> 01:24:56,256
I mean, eventuality I
would have told you.

902
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:02,665
If you want to be close to someone,
you can't keep secrets from them.

903
01:25:07,076 --> 01:25:10,910
Emily, how we doing? Bump on the head?

904
01:25:31,534 --> 01:25:33,468
Wow! You did it.

905
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,199
With help from my friend.

906
01:25:39,308 --> 01:25:41,503
And his adorable big brother.

907
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,741
This is very cool.

908
01:25:50,853 --> 01:25:52,946
There's still some unfinished business.

909
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:57,052
We'll go to everybody
and give them an ultimatum.

910
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:01,691
You think we can convince all of them
to give back the broken pieces?

911
01:26:02,665 --> 01:26:04,292
You did it, didn't you?

912
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:08,197
Plus, under the condition that they
fess up, I'm going to give a refund.

913
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:10,771
Where you going to get
that kind of cash?

914
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:14,404
Well, Pauline is on her way over
with a loaner violin.

915
01:26:43,206 --> 01:26:46,198
Thank you. Great! Thanks.

916
01:26:46,275 --> 01:26:48,106
- Very nice!
- Excellent!

917
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,247
I have some ideas for you.

918
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:55,309
Tell the manager that
you stole from him...

919
01:26:55,384 --> 01:26:59,218
...and volunteer to sweep the fronts
and clean the windows as a payback.

920
01:26:59,288 --> 01:27:02,189
And think of something
to work off the $20 from your dad.

921
01:27:02,859 --> 01:27:05,851
If you do this, I'll fork
over a refund of $5.

922
01:27:06,195 --> 01:27:07,822
You just have to pitch in $15.

923
01:27:08,798 --> 01:27:10,698
What have we got for Gregory Jones?

924
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,702
Gregory.

925
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:22,642
One broken wristwatch.

926
01:27:25,448 --> 01:27:27,245
One stained button-down.

927
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:30,881
One crystal vase.

928
01:27:35,324 --> 01:27:37,087
A jade figurine.

929
01:27:37,493 --> 01:27:38,721
I'm dead meat.

930
01:27:43,599 --> 01:27:45,567
Okay, Isabelle, here's my proposal.

931
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:48,968
Tell Jenny the entire story.
I'll even take some blame for...

932
01:27:49,138 --> 01:27:50,765
...planting the idea of her death.

933
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,367
And maybe we can do a missing
person search on the Internet...

934
01:27:54,443 --> 01:27:56,138
...and try and find Jordan.

935
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,571
Might as Well get it over with.

936
01:28:00,983 --> 01:28:03,645
We can forget about
doing your inventory.

937
01:28:04,153 --> 01:28:07,054
If you face your demons,
you're looking at $21 back.

938
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,634
I'm sorry, Emily.

939
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:26,605
If I didn't have Jenny,
I would want you to be my sister.

940
01:28:26,976 --> 01:28:28,603
Grace is lucky.

941
01:28:35,918 --> 01:28:37,078
All right, Lea.

942
01:28:37,153 --> 01:28:41,317
Do it for your sister. I heard she's
been in bed with allergies all summer.

943
01:28:41,791 --> 01:28:43,958
She's allergic to the air.
It's not my girls.

944
01:28:43,959 --> 01:28:46,125
Wait a minute. You did what?

945
01:28:46,929 --> 01:28:48,954
That sounds Like it's going Well.

946
01:28:49,932 --> 01:28:53,698
Anyway, I talked to my parents.
They said I could adopt Dixie.

947
01:28:53,769 --> 01:28:55,396
You can visit her whenever you Like.

948
01:28:55,471 --> 01:28:57,234
Phil will talk to his
parents about Nadine.

949
01:28:57,306 --> 01:28:58,637
Noreen.

950
01:29:00,142 --> 01:29:03,578
- What have we got for Lea?
- I'm not accident prone.

951
01:29:04,413 --> 01:29:08,509
I'll drop Dixie off this afternoon.
You better take extra care of her.

952
01:29:08,985 --> 01:29:10,452
Maybe you can show me how.

953
01:29:15,224 --> 01:29:18,785
Sorry, guys, we're taking cuts.
Can you really help me find Jordan?

954
01:29:18,861 --> 01:29:20,192
First things first.

955
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:31,165
Where's the trash? My mom
barely remembers this Wedgwood box.

956
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,732
- I was 7 when I broke it.
- It's the point.

957
01:29:36,879 --> 01:29:39,712
I didn't break this. It's my necklace.

958
01:29:42,551 --> 01:29:44,781
I can't believe her. When will she stop?

959
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:48,980
You guys, I still have
some clients waiting.

960
01:29:49,292 --> 01:29:51,351
- Sorry. We'll catch you later.
- Okay.

961
01:29:53,562 --> 01:29:56,554
- Wwhap the o wit wwa.
- 'Bye.

962
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:02,669
Wait a minute. Where's Mikey?
I thought everybody agreed to come.

963
01:30:17,153 --> 01:30:19,747
Guess Mikey will come by
to pick this up later.

964
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:23,752
Thank you, Philip.
I couldn't have done it without you.

965
01:30:24,493 --> 01:30:27,155
- Neither could I.
- Could have what?

966
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:30,891
Learned how to play piano.
I think I'm going to be good.

967
01:30:32,535 --> 01:30:34,730
When you're ready, we'll
play the sonatas.

968
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:37,204
If you're not too busy
with symphony rehearsals.

969
01:30:38,407 --> 01:30:40,807
I'll make time for you. Always.

970
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,043
Friends?

971
01:30:51,687 --> 01:30:52,847
The best.

972
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:10,404
- She's all yours.
- Thanks, buddy!

973
01:31:10,773 --> 01:31:14,106
And David, I'm not too young to see it.

974
01:31:24,787 --> 01:31:27,620
I never thanked you for helping me
get into the symphony.

975
01:31:31,193 --> 01:31:32,251
It's just...

976
01:31:33,195 --> 01:31:37,894
...I don't know how to because
I've never kissed anybody before.

977
01:32:11,467 --> 01:32:13,799
Mom could use some tea
while Grace is napping.

978
01:32:13,869 --> 01:32:17,361
- Good idea. I'll join her.
- That is a good idea.

979
01:32:26,482 --> 01:32:29,212
You know, Dad, Let me tell her.

980
01:32:38,461 --> 01:32:40,656
By the way, something
came for you today.

981
01:32:41,864 --> 01:32:43,388
It's up in your room.
