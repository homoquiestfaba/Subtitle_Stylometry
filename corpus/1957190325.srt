century replica

Nope.

45
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:42,600
No?

46
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,967
Have I ever
told you the story

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,900
of the Burn Castle
Christmas Clock?

48
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,567
No...but I think
you're going to.

49
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,967
(laughing)

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Well, sometime in the
late eighteenth century,

51
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:57,367
a young clock maker
and a peasant girl

52
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,333
fell madly in love
with each other.

53
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:01,600
She was the most beautiful
woman in the village

54
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,200
but her parents had already
promised her to someone else.

55
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:07,000
So the clock maker decided
that if he were to make

56
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:09,500
the most magnificent
clock ever known to man,

57
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,200
her parents
would reconsider

58
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:13,433
and break the
arranged engagement.

59
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,767
When the young woman's suitor
got wind of these plans

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,000
he whisked her off to a
villa far, far away.

61
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:24,367
And then the day before
Christmas, a gift arrived

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,933
for the young woman
and when she opened it

63
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:30,433
she found the most beautiful
clock she had ever seen.

64
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:33,100
So beautiful, thst she secretly
carried it with her

65
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,600
wherever she went from
that day forward.

66
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,400
On her wedding day,
she wept over the clock -

67
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,867
praying for a miracle.

68
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,867
And just as she walked
down the aisle,

69
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,100
the clock stopped.

70
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:50,033
Everyone and everything
in the church stopped;

71
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:53,967
frozen in time and she
ran out of the church,

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,267
bursting through the doors
in to the Town Square

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,467
and runs into the clock maker,
who's rushing towards her

74
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,833
past all the town's folk
who are frozen in time.

75
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,433
And they ran off together and
they lived happily ever after,

76
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,133
never to be seen again...
or so the story goes.

77
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,133
(laughing)

78
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,767
Oh, you know,
I've been meaning

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,733

shelf for weeks.

00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:22,567

make a great team.

Oh, that's okay.

185
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,567
We'll get it
sized tomorrow.

186
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,667
Yeah, no, I don't
think we have time.

187
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,333
Well, see, I have
another proposal.

188
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:19,600
I thought that, well;
my parents would love

189
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:20,900
to meet their future
daughter-in-law

190
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:23,167
so why don't we spend
Christmas at their house?

191
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,167
Really!?
Your parents?!

192
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,333
Oh, I'd love to get
to meet them finally!

193
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,833
Maybe we can go chop down
a Christmas tree together?

194
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,367
Or - well, they probably
already have one of those.

195
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,367
I hope we're not too late
to decorate it at least -

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,167
or maybe we could
make some decorations?

197
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,000
Or, cookies!

198
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,167
Yes, we've got
to make cookies.

199
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,967
My Dad and I
used to make

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,233
the most amazing
Christmas cookies.

201
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:42,933
They were cherrios and
marshmallows shaped

202
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,533
in the form of a Christmas
tree with this green,

203
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,300
sugar glaze on the outside.
They were to die for!

204
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,733
My mother's macrobiotic.

205
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:51,967
Oh.

206
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:54,033
Oh.

207
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:54,967
What about
Christmas stockings?

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,967
Do you have one?

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,733
I could make
you one if not,

210
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,233
it's not that hard
at all.

211
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,767
It's just some felt,
some glue...

212
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,267
What about Christmas
peanut butter fudge?

213
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,767
Think your parents
would like that?

214
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,033
I have this new recipe
I'm dying to try.

215
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,433
Oh, wait.
It's not microbiotic.

216
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,133
Macro.

217
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:08,767
Oh.

362
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,800
Take my phone, call your
fiancé, get the address.

363
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, I feel so stupid.

364
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,900
Don't, just - this kind of
thing could happen to anybody.

365
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,233
Hi, you've reached Will
Mi Please leave me a message.

366
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:44,567
Hey, Will,
it's me again.

367
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,133
You're going right
to voicemail.

368
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,733
Um, well,
I'm kind of lost.

369
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,767
They didn't find my bag and my
phone is out of commission.

370
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,567
So, I'm going to try you
again in a few minutes,

371
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
if a strange number
pops up please answer it.

372
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,667
It might just be the
future Mrs. Mitchum.

373
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:00,667
Thanks.

374
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,733
Did you say "Mitchum"?

375
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:02,500
Uh-huh.

376
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,333
You're kidding.

377
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,467
No, why?

378
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,967
I'm a Mitchum.

379
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,100
What's your
fiancé's name?

380
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,600
Will.
Will Mitchum.

381
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,133
You're engaged
to Billy Mitchum?

382
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,300
Billy's my brother.

383
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,367
Will's your brother?!

384
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,967
Will?
We never called him Will.

385
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You know, I bet he changed it
to sound more grown up.

386
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,967
Oh, Will is very
grown up.

387
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,267
This - this is freaky!

388
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,367
He never told me
he had a brother!

389
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,167
He never mentioned
he had a fiancée.

390
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,700
Well, we were gonna wait
to tell everybody together.

391
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:29,767
(laughing)

392
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I guess the cat's
out of the bag.

393
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,367
I'm Matt.

394
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,767
Alice.

395
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,167
You know what, Alice?

396
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,800
This here is fate.

397
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,467
(laughing)

398
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,467
So, how did you
and Billy meet?

399
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,267
Oh!

400
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,533
Will and I met
on "mates.com".

401
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,367
Really?

402
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Mmhmm.

403
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:50,200
Can't imagine Billy -
Willy - Will going

404
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:52,300
for internet
match making.

405
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,400
Well, believe me
I didn't either.

406
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:58,800
I mean, you know, it was a
kind of a weird time for me.

407
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,033
My Dad died
a few years ago

408
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,900
and my Mom decided
to move to Florida

409
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:08,133
to spend time
with her sister, so.

410
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:11,167
Anyway, all my friends
are doing Internet dating

411
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,200
and I thought I'd give
it a try and bingo!

412
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,433
There - there was
Will and we had

413
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:20,467
a seventy-five percent
compatibility rating so...

414
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,233
Seventy-five percent?

415
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,300
Mmmhmm.

416
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,167
So that's a going rate
for a husband online.

417
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,667
Pretty scientific.

418
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,033
Yeah, well.

419
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,233
It seems to work,
believe it or not.

420
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,100
I mean -
no, Will is great!

421
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,233
He's - he's
practical and, uh,

422
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,667
level-headed and he,
as you know,

423
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,433
he's very smart
with business.

424
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:41,733
Just like Juliet
described Romeo.

425
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:43,833
Not so much.
(laughing)

426
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:45,833
Will is very romantic!

427
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,733
I'll have you know
he sends me

428
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,967
a dozen red roses
every Friday.

429
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,600
Really?

430
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:51,633
Yeah.

431
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,367
Well, you know, I guess
Billy and I just have

432
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,467
different ideas
of what romance is.

433
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,467
To me, romance is doing
the dishes with somebody

434
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,767
or doing the laundry
together where like,

435
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,933
the simplest thing
is amazing.

436
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,867
♪

437
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,700
Let's see that ring
of yours!

438
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,933
Oh, yeah!

439
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,667
It's in my
pocket here.

440
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:18,533
Here it is.

441
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,667
Wow.

442
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,067
It's a little big, that's
why I don't have it on.

443
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,900
It's beautiful.

444
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:23,667
Thank you.

445
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,633
Can I see?

446
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,667
Mmhmm.

447
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,500
Oh! Oh!

448
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,133
Sorry!

449
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,033
I'll find it.

450
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,933
No, no. I got it.
It's right here.

451
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,733
(gasp)
Matt! LOOK OUT!

452
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:34,333
CRASH!

453
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,500
Oh, good.
You're awake.

454
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,900
You were beginning
to have me worried.

455
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,100
Who hit me in the head
with a sledgehammer?

456
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,500
Close enough.

457
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,333
We hit a tree.

458
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:57,333
Oh, gosh,
now I remember.

459
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:58,933
Are you okay?

460
00:16:58,967 --> 00:16:59,933
I'm okay.

461
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:00,933
You're both lucky.

462
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,933
It looks like both
of you have nothing

463
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,433
but a few scrapes
and bruises.

464
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:07,433
Just gonna keep you here a bit
to check for internal bleeding.

465
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,600
That doesn't
sound good.

466
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:10,600
It's just precaution,
nothing to worry about.

467
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:12,233
We'll notify
your family.

468
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:21,800
(sighing)

469
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,967
You have
clean fingernails.

470
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,500
As opposed to...?

471
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
Your fingernails
are very clean.

472
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,367
(laughing)

473
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,967
Okay.

474
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,433
Thank you, I think.

475
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,300
My father always told me
if I didn't know what

476
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,300
to say to a girl,
just compliment her.

477
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,167
(laughing)

478
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,167
I should know not
to listen to him.

479
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,700
I went to prom in a
powder blue leisure suit

480
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,967
because he told me
it looked sophisticated.

481
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,167
In 1999.

482
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,900
(laughing)

483
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,167
Wow...

484
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,000
Billy was always
better with the ladies.

485
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:01,200
Are you kidding me?

486
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:02,833
Our first date
was a disaster.

487
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,267
He spent the whole
time interviewing me.

488
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,400
Yeah?

489
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,767
"Do you want kids?",
"Do you like opera?",

490
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,333
"Would you be willing to
drop everything and be my

491
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,033
partner if my business
picks up in another state?".

492
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,333
(laughing)

493
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:16,200
Really?

494
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,000
Mmhm.

495
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:17,833
I don't know.

496
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,733
It was kind of
endearing, I guess.

497
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,433
It was refreshing that he
actually knew what he wanted.

498
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,100
Smart.

499
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,200
I should have taken that
approach with my fiancée.

500
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,433
Oh, you're engaged?

501
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,033
I was.

502
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,900
Oh. Sorry.

503
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,367
Last summer.

504
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,567
She just up and
moved to Paris.

505
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,567
You know, I would do
nice things for her,

506
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,867
and she would tell me
I was smothering her

507
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,633
so I stopped and suddenly
I was cold and uncaring.

508
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,033
She sounds confused.

509
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,233
She confused
the heck out of me.

510
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,000
You know what
the worst was?

511
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,633
I had this important
business presentation.

512
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,700
I was dressed in a suit,
had to get up in front

513
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:03,967
of a few hundred people at
this annual conference

514
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,033
and it was raining.

515
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:07,733
Don't get me wrong, I love
the rain but we forgot

516
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:10,267
the umbrella and I was
driving and so I asked

517
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,533
if I could get out at the front
door and if she could

518
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,800
get street parking,
you know, so I wouldn't look

519
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,467
like a drown rat on
stage and she refused.

520
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,900
She said she didn't
want to get all wet

521
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,533
and I thought,

522
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,333
she wouldn't even walk
through the rain for me.

523
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,600
I don't know about you,
but where I come from,

524
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,667
love walks through
the rain.

525
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,533
Yeah.

526
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,533
It should.

527
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,533
It has to.

528
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,467
I sure hope it does.

529
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:53,667
I'm sorry.

530
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,433
Don't be.

531
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:58,067
Breaking it off was the best
thing I could have done.

532
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,367
Still hurts
a little, huh?

533
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,833
Just a little
around the holidays.

534
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,533
Oh, Matt!

535
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,733
Matty, Matty, Matty.

536
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:20,533
Oh, Matty!

537
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,700
Hey, Mom--

538
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,733
We came as soon as
the hospital called.

539
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,767
Mom, I can't breathe!

540
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,133
Easy, honey.

541
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:27,933
Mom--

542
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:29,633
Give him some air.

543
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,333
Sorry, sweetie.
Are you okay?

544
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,133
It only hurts
when I laugh.

545
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,733
(laughing)

546
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,133
Just like now.

547
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,133
Oh, hi!

548
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,000
Hi!

549
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,367
We're his parents.

550
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,900
It's so nice
to meet you.

551
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,700
I've heard so much
about you both.

552
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,667
Oh Mom, Dad,
this is Alice.

553
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,167
You didn't tell me
you're bringing

554
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,433
a girlfriend home
for Christmas!

555
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,733
You didn't even tell us
you had a girlfriend!

556
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,400
No no, I'm not his --

557
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,733
Alice is
Billy's fiancée

558
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,933
Billy's...engaged?

559
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,033
Yeah.

560
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,767
He didn't tell us
anything about --

561
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,167
Well, we wanted
to surprise you.

562
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,067
Surprise!

563
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,433
Oh well --

564
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:04,367
She's surprised.

565
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,867
You certainly did that,
didn't she, Joe?

566
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,833
Sorry.

567
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,000
We never heard a word
from him, I mean --

568
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,033
So, where's
Billy now?

569
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,800
He had a work
thing come up

570
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,133
so he wasn't able
to fly in with me.

571
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,933
He was laid up
but he's coming.

572
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:19,033
I asked the nurse
to call him.

573
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:22,800
This is the most wonderful
Christmas surprise!

574
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,300
It's so nice
to meet you.

575
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,633
And you!

576
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,067
You both got pretty
good knocks on the head.

577
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,800
I want you both under
constant surveillance

578
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,100
for the next twenty-four
hours just to be sure.

579
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:34,100
No sleeping until the
observation period is over.

580
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,400
I think we can do that,
can't we, Joe?

581
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,533
Absolutely,
thanks Doc.

582
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:38,567
Yeah--

583
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
You know, it is so
perfect that you're here

584
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,367
because with Billy
being late we needed

585
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,900
an extra pairs of hands
to help trim the tree.

586
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,433
Oh, I love trimming
the tree!

587
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,200
Have you made your
Christmas cookies yet?

588
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,333
Not yet.

589
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,400
Oh! 'Cause I have all these
recipes that I brought

590
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:53,467
that I'm dying to try and
they're macrobiotic.

591
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,267
What's macrobiotic?

592
00:21:58,267 --> 00:21:59,100
Wow...

593
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:00,800
This looks like it
would have been

594
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,300
an amazing place
to grow up.

595
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,067
You like it?

596
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,233
I love it.

597
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:06,600
Mom and Dad always go
all out for Christmas.

598
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:08,467
Come on in!

599
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:11,567
I know it's not much,
but we call it home.

600
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,267
It's beautiful!

601
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,400
Maison!

602
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,667
Oh!

603
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
You know
your antiques!

604
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,267
Matt took me to a road
show for my birthday

605
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,867
and that was
my favorite.

606
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,667
I didn't know you
liked antiques!

607
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,433
I do.

608
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,000
This one is part
of a set,

609
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:27,533
I have some of the other
pieces in my store.

610
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:28,800
What?
You have a store?

611
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,767
Well, it was my
father's store.

612
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,267
I practically
grew up there.

613
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,100
Oh!

614
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,867
I'd love to see
it some time!

615
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,967
Only after I confiscate
your credit cards!

616
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,333
Oh stop!

617
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:39,300
(laughing)

618
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,033
Thank you.

619
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:40,767
Hey, hey--

620
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,500
Oh--

621
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,933
Tell me what
you think, huh?

622
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:43,967
Okay.

623
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,567
Mmmm!

624
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,633
Am I tasting --

625
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,200
(together) Allspice?

626
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:51,300
(laughing)

627
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,067
I like this
gal already!

628
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,033
Aww!

629
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,900
All right, Matt in the
living room, please.

630
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,700
Alice, you come on
upstairs with me.

631
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,567
I'm gonna get you in to
something a little more cozy.

632
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Oh, thank you.

633
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:04,433
These will
keep you warm.

634
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,767
There we go.

635
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:09,267
Ugh--

636
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:10,800
You sit right
down here.

637
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,300
Why can't we lie down
in the bedrooms?

638
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,700
Because A) that's where the
Christmas presents are--

639
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:16,733
--that's a girl, dear--

640
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,567
--and B) I have to keep
an eye on you two

641
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,367
and make sure you
don't fall asleep.

642
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,867
I'm gonna make you
some tea.

643
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,633
I don't want
to be any trouble.

644
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,733
No no, I'm gonna make
you some chamomile.

645
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,533
It will help you relax.

646
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,900
You might as well give up
and let her mother you.

647
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,667
I don't want
to be a bother.

648
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,433
Are you kidding?

649
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,067
She loves this
sort of thing.

650
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,333
How are you feeling
by the way?

651
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,333
Oh, I feel fine.

652
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:41,667
Just a little antsy;
I really want to help

653
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,933
with the Christmas
preparations.

654
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:45,700
Tomorrow there'll be
plenty to do, I promise.

655
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,933
Mom won't stop preparing
for Christmas until you

656
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:50,433
physically pry the hot
glue gun out of her hands

657
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:52,767
and force her to have
a glass of eggnog

658
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,767
and actually relax
and enjoy the holiday.

659
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,967
This is
so comfortable.

660
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Mmhmm.

661
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,333
You two aren't
sleeping are ya?

662
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:01,767
No!

663
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,600
Good!

664
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,200
Remember what
the doctor said.

665
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:06,233
Oh, and Grandpa
Charles just called;

666
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:09,367
said he cut down the best
tree in Redmond just for us.

667
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,900
I missed
the tree cutting??

668
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:11,967
You snooze you lose!

669
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,567
I love picking out
the tree!

670
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,633
So do I!

671
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,967
You know, Will actually
just bought a fake tree

672
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,900
for the shop.

673
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:18,700
What?

674
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:19,633
Mmhmm.

675
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,967
Living in the city's
really changing him.

676
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,567
I know. Well, no,
I don't think so.

677
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,167
It's just
the tree's fine,

678
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,400
it's just a little too
perfect that's all.

679
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,800
It's missing--

680
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,400
Character.

681
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,400
Yeah! Exactly.

682
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:32,600
Okay...

683
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:33,800
Here we are!

684
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,000
I thought something
light might be better

685
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,133
because of
your conditions.

686
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:40,133
Here you go honey --
careful, it's hot.

687
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:40,800
Thank you.

688
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:41,800
Here you go, Matt.

689
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:42,600
Thanks, Mom.

690
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:43,833
Thanks, Mrs. Mitchum.

691
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:47,400
Oh please, call me Penny!
We're almost family!

692
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:48,800
Thank you, Penny.

693
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,933
Ok, I'm still baking
cookies in the kitchen

694
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,433
so that's where I'll
be and I want you two

695
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,233
to keep an eye
on each other.

696
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:56,767
If one of
you falls asleep,

697
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,033
I want the other to
give me a holler

698
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:00,367
and I'll come
right in.

699
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:00,900
Ok.

700
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,833
Copy that.

701
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,467
Are you sure
I can't help?

702
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,933
No, you have to wait out
your twenty-four hours.

703
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:09,167
But enjoy this down
time because -- hoo hoo!

704
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,867
-- when Grandpa
gets here...

705
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:12,833
(laughing)
Okay.

706
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:14,833
When Grandpa gets here,
we'll have the tree

707
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,100
to put up
and decorate

708
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,467
and there are only two days
left before Christmas.

709
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,133
How long does it take
to decorate a tree?

710
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,800
A very long time.

711
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:25,700
You'll find out.

712
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,067
Should I be scared?

713
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
Be scared.

714
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,067
(laughing)

715
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,667
♪

716
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,167
Three big deals
in two days.

717
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,467
Didn't anybody tell you
there's a recession going on?

718
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,467
You're the man now.

719
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Mmhmm.

720
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,833
And the man needs
another round.

721
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,033
Well, you have
the luck.

722
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:49,033
Word on the street
is that your fiancée

723
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:50,900
owns that shop
on 23rd,

724
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:53,133
in the block Grant
Lockley wants to buy.

725
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,667
Yeah, but I thought those
are just rumors about Lockley.

726
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,533
Mm-mmm!

727
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,467
I mean, he always
uses Winters anyway,

728
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,567
so what's it matter?

729
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,567
He's desperate.

730
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,567
He wants to buy
that block, raise it,

731
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,500
and put up
a condo tower.

732
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,367
Winters can't
close the deal.

733
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,533
But I can.

734
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,833
Alice'd do anything
I tell her to do.

735
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,700
And speaking of Alice,

736
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:15,333
she's probably at my
parents' by now.

737
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,900
Just gonna
give her a call.

738
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:17,600
Yeah.

739
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:21,433
Voicemail:
Hey, it's Alice.

740
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,933
I'm either away
from my phone

741
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:25,800
or lost reception
so leave a message.

742
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:28,933
Hey, darlin', I'm so sorry
I didn't make it up tonight

743
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:31,900
but I closed this
huge deal and,

744
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:34,367
well, look I'll tell you
all about it tomorrow.

745
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,633
Um, hope my parents
are treating you well.

746
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,267
Have a great
sleep, beautiful.

747
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
I love you.

748
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,100
Message: Hello, Mr. Mitchum,
this is Doctor Stark.

749
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:49,033
I'm calling from
Beresford County...

750
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,733
Well, if it's not
Mr. Mitchum.

751
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:51,933
Mr. Lockley!

752
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,967
Well, how good
to see you, sir.

753
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,867
And, um, congratulations
on the new condos.

754
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,367
Yeah.

755
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,833
Yeah, I hear you're
on your way up.

756
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,533
Yeah, well, I'm, uh,
not doing too bad.

757
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:06,167
You know, I heard you
were having a little bit

758
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,400
of trouble on that
23rd street deal.

759
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,967
Yeah, it's not going to
work out, I'm moving on.

760
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,967
Oh, that's a pity.

761
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,167
That could have been
a lot of money.

762
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,300
Well, you know what?

763
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,400
Sometimes deals
just don't work out.

764
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,167
And you will understand
that when you,

765
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,933
um, get a little
more experience.

766
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:25,833
Right.

767
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,233
What if I told you
that I have a line

768
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:31,267
on the owner for
the antique shop?

769
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,967
She won't sell it.

770
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,500
She will to me.

771
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,033
And why is that?
Huh?

772
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:40,200
Why is that?

773
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:42,433
What, you got some
mystical power over women?

774
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,433
(laughing)

775
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:46,033
No.
She's my fiancée.

776
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,800
Well, like I said.
I've moved on.

777
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:52,600
And like I said
- what a pity.

778
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:55,533
I mean, now that
something could happen.

779
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,867
I'm going to my parents'
over Christmas and,

780
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,000
I know it's a long shot,
but on the off chance

781
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,700
that you revisit the
23rd street project --

782
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:08,667
give me a call
after the holidays.

783
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,200
Merry Christmas.

784
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:24,033
(TV sounds)

785
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:27,033
There's absolutely
nothing on.

786
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:32,033
Hey--

787
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:34,467
Dozy--
No sleeping!

788
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,467
I can't keep
my eyes open.

789
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,833
This reminds
of when I was a kid.

790
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,367
Billy and I would
have competitions

791
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,933
to see who could
stay awake the longest...

792
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,667
I always lost.

793
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,067
Awww.

794
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,567
We used to build these
elaborate forts out of pillows

795
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,500
and blankets and TV trays
-- everything we could

796
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:53,867
get our hands on
would go in to it.

797
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,500
Then we'd go get our
G.I. JOE flashlights,

798
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:59,967
and go on a mission
for cookies.

799
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,267
A mission?

800
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,867

some cookies?

Mmmmm.
These look amazing.

supposed to.

Wow, it's five-thirty
in the morning.

837
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:09,200
Only fourteen thousand
more hours to stay awake.

838

I blame the airline

That's true.

Hey, you never told me what
it was they lost of yours.

843
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,133
(sigh)

844
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,567
I spent months recreating
this Victorian music box

845
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,867
my Grandmother
used to have.

846
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,867
All in-laid wood with
a lithograph graph

847
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,367
of Victorian cherubs
on the inside

848
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,867
and I figured out how
to get it to play

849
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,133
the song that was playing
at the school dance

850
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,233
when they first met.

851
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:38,833
Oh, that's
so romantic!

852
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:39,667
Isn't it?

853
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,400
Grandpa will deny
it up and down,

854
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,900
but he's a pretty
romantic guy.

855
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,167
Just mention
8:42 to him.

856
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,867
8:42?
What's that?

857
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,667
The moment he first
saw my Grandmother.

858
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,233
He saw her then took out his
watch to see what time it was

859
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:55,700
because he knew his life would
never be the same after that.

860
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,867
Oh, I think
I'm going to cry!

861
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,300
(laughing)

862
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,767
Whenever he talks about it
he always says

863
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,067
"I took one look
at her and I knew

864
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,300
I would love her forever."

865
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,400
That's so beautiful.

866
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,400
Mmm!

867
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,667
Dropped one.

868
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,867
I can't wait to meet
your Grandfather.

869
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,700
You've got a little
icing right --

870
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:20,467
Right here?

871
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,467
On the other side.

872
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,367
Where?

873
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,067
I've got it all over
my face, right?

874
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,233
(laughing)

875
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:27,267
I got it.

876
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:30,033
Right...there.

877
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,467
There we go.

878
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,500
So what else do you do,

879
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:43,733
besides building
Victorian music boxes?

880
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:46,300
I crochet for a living.

881
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,500
I don't believe you!

882
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:48,500
(laughing)

883
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,067
I make furniture.

884
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,300
Really?

885
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,300
Mm-hmm.

886
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,567
See this table?

887
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Yeah.

888
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,400
I built it.

889
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,933
You built this??

890
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:01,000
Actually I had to,

891
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,367
after I accidently set
the old one on fire.

892
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,767
(laughing)

893
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,033
But it turned out I love
working with wood

894
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,633
and I was good at it.

895
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,133
Good thing I got my Masters
degree in finance, huh?

896
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,133
Masters?

897
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,633
Yeah.
Wasn't my thing.

898
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,133
I hate wearing suits
and that dreaded thing

899
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,933
of actually having
to talk to people.

900
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,767
(laughing)

901
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,267
Well, you're very charming.
I'm sure you did great.

902
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Thanks.

903
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,933
But I think the last
thing this world needs

904
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,967
is more bankers and
real estate agents.

905
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,767
That's funny.

906
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,567
If only Will
could hear you now.

907
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,233
I think he'd agree
with me.

908
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:39,667
Yeah, probably would--
less competition.

909
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,667
My Grandfather --
he built things.

910
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,233
Houses,
for forty years.

911
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,200
I think the only time
he wore a tux'

912
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:50,967
was when he was
at his wedding

913
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,700
and that was because
of my Grandmother.

914
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:53,500
Hmmm.

915
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,767
You should see
them together.

916
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,633
Like Bogart and Bacall
or Tracy and Hepburn.

917
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,233
I can't wait.

918
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,200
Look at this one.

919
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,700
Oh! They look
so happy together.

920
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:12,200
I know! My Grandma
was such a fox.

921
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:13,833
She really was.

922
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:16,333
This is my favorite
one right here.

923
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:17,333
Mmmmmm!

924
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:18,400
Isn't she beautiful?

925
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,900
She's gorgeous.

926
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:22,133
Wow!

927
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:24,400
Was different
then, hey?

928
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:25,600
You have her smile.

929
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:26,200
Do I?

930
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:26,867
Mmhmm.

931
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:45,033
♪

932
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:47,233
Hey.

933
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:48,767
Good morning.

934
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,900
Morning.

935
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,633
Wait,
we were sleeping.

936
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:00,100
We're okay,
we survived.

937
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,733
We weren't
supposed to.

938
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,433
(laughing)

939
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:06,767
Oh--

940
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,900
Looks like we just about made
it through the toddler years.

941
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:10,667
Yeah.

942
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,867
What are you doing?

943
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:13,933
Um --

944
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:16,067
We're just looking
over some pictures.

945
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,467
Just considering
breakfast.

946
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,067
No you were
sleeping, weren't you?

947
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,667
Nope.

948
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,833
No.

949
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:23,067
I have half a mind to
smack you up side the head!

950
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,833
Brain injury, Mom!

951
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:25,400
Doctor says you
can't slap me!

952
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,433
Come here, let me see.
Look at me.

953
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:28,667
All right.

954
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,900
How are you,
honey?

955
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:32,133
I think I'm okay.
I'm just tired.

956
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,900
I know, I know
but no sleeping yet!

957
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,900
Matt get up and
clean up this mess

958
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:38,067
before Grandpa
gets here.

959
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,633
Okay.

960
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:39,833
Now Matt!

961
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,033
Okay, okay!

962
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:43,100
Ohhhhh.
You're so busted.

963
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:45,933
Follow the finger.
Follow the finger.

964
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:47,300
Got it...
there we go.

965
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,367
Don't drop the needles!

966
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,267
Oh, it's okay!

967
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,100
Any one here want
a Christmas tree?

968
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:53,300
Very expensive!

969
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:54,100
Oh!

970
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,267
Let me help you.

971
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,500
It's beautiful!

972
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:59,700
Oh, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

973
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:01,167
Go sit!
You're injured.

974
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,300
We got this.

975
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,500
There we are.

976
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:04,933
Easy!

977
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:05,967
That's it.

978
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,767
Beautiful!

979
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,300
Oh, look at that.

980
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,667
That's
a beauty, huh?

981
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:12,633
You must be Alice.

982
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:13,600
Hi!

983
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,867
Joe told me all about
your secret engagement.

984
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,533
I have to say,
guys --

985
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,367
our Billy boy has
very good taste.

986
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,133
Awwww, thank you.

987
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:25,533
They were giving these out
at the Christmas tree farm --

988
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:26,533
Thanks, Grandpa.

989
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:27,967
And for this
special occasion,

990
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,200
welcoming our new
addition to the family.

991
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,733
(laughing)

992
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:35,733
Alice -- the
red-nosed fiancée.

993
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,133
(laughing)

994
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,167
(clapping)

995
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,600
It goes
with your hair!

996
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,833
Thanks.

997
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,767
Come on, Joe.

998
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,567
I can't hold
this up all day.

999
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,833
Well, stop wobbling
the thing

1000
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:51,367
and maybe I'll be able
to get the screws in!

1001
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,567
All right.

1002
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
All right, they're in;
you can let go.

1003
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:56,167
Ohhh!

1004
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,567
All right, decorators,
start your engines!

1005
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,767
Beautiful tree.

1006
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,533
Huh? Yeah.

1007
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:02,167
I think it's
a perfect one.

1008
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,400
The tree is... okay.

1009
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:07,567
Uh oh, look out!
We're in trouble.

1010
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,000
Our Matty only
likes those pathetic,

1011
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,167
Charlie Brown trees.

1012
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,767
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't knock it,

1013
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,167
Alice happens
to like them too.

1014
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,400
Is that so?

1015
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,700
Yeah, I've always
been a sucker

1016
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:21,200
for the loser on the
Christmas tree lot.

1017
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:24,200
I mean, I feel like if you
have a tree as beautiful

1018
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:26,200
as that one you're
already half way there.

1019
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:29,867
But if you can take a tree
that's dropping its needles

1020
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,933
and missing half its branches
and growing sideways

1021
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:36,200
and all of that --
Then by the time

1022
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:38,333
you decorate it,
and it looks so beautiful;

1023
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:40,400
it's sort of
a Christmas miracle.

1024
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:44,067
You know, I think Matt said
the same thing last year.

1025
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,033
Did you?

1026
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:46,067
Yeah...

1027
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,233
Every ornament has a story
and Grandpa's going

1028
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,067
to tell them all,
right Grandpa?

1029
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,500
Oh!
Who's that little guy?

1030
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:56,933
This is "Bo",
my first dog.

1031
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,967
I got this
when I was a boy.

1032
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,133
"Bo" always gets a
prime spot on the tree,

1033
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,233
right Grandpa?

1034
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:05,233
That's a good
spot right there.

1035
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:06,067
Excellent.

1036
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,133
Dad -- this one.

1037
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:17,200
My Debra gave me this
at a Christmas formal.

1038
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,067
That's where they met.

1039
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,000
That's right.

1040
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,300
There was a dinner
before the dance...

1041
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,167
and there she was.

1042
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,000
I took one look
at her

1043
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:30,100
and I knew I would
love her forever.

1044
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,100
You knew all that
from just one look?

1045
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,833
It worked for me,
kiddo.

1046
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,333
She had come
with another fella.

1047
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:39,867
He got
food poisoning--

1048
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,867
Oh, Dad!

1049
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,100
--and he had to leave
so I got to dance

1050
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:44,100
with her all night.

1051
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:45,200
You smoothie!

1052
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:48,100
If it hadn't been
for a little bad egg salad,

1053
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,667
I may never
have met her.

1054
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,533
It was fate!

1055
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:52,500
(laughing)

1056
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:53,467
What?

1057
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,033
You tell that story
every year, Grandpa,

1058
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:56,533
when you put up
that ornament.

1059
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,500
Get outta here!

1060
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:58,300
You do.

1061
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,133
Yeah.

1062
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:02,700
Well, it's true.
It was fate.

1063
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:03,967
And it found me at--

1064
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,133
EIGHT FORTY-TWO!

1065
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:07,133
Hey!

1066
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,300
You too?

1067
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,200
Matt told me the
story last night;

1068
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,067
I thought it
was so beautiful.

1069
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:16,200
Read what's
written on the star.

1070
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:22,967
"Eternity is where
true love exists."

1071
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,267
She had a way
with words, didn't she?

1072
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,833
You know what
I think we need?

1073
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:30,833
I think we need some of Alice
and Matt's Christmas cookies.

1074
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:31,367
Hey!

1075
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,200
Good idea!

1076
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:32,933
Be right back!

1077
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:33,833
Oh!

1078
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:35,733
I'm sorry they're
not macrobiotic.

1079
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:38,433
Wait... is that
a bad thing?

1080
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:41,733
Will told me
you were macrobiotic.

1081
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:43,733
I don't even
know what that is.

1082
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:44,633
Neither do I.

1083
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,333
Billy doesn't know

first thing in the morning

This is Doctor Stark.

00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:46,700
Driver, change of plans -
take me to the airport.

1106
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:49,600
Yes!

1107
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,233

He's coming!

1108

talked to him?

1109

No, he sent me
twelve emails though.

Twelve?
Oh, my God.

1111

He's worried sick.

1112
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't understand why
he doesn't just call me here.

1113
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:01,867
Because that's the
logical thing to do

1114
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,900
and when a man
is in love -

1115
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:05,400

with his heart!

What?

1132

Will?

Who are you?

1264

I'm Billy Mitchum.

1265
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,033
So you're not
engaged to Billy?

1266
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,167
This is--

1267
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,367
I've made a
really big mistake.

1268
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,067

I don't know this person.

1269

You're Will?
You're Billy?

1270
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,767
I'm Billy, I've never
been called "Will".

1271
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,767
But my fiancé
is Will Mitchum.

1272
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,000
I-I don't know...

1273
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,000
Uh, well.

1274
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:49,600
They are the same
name; Will, Billy.

1275
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:51,633
You can see how they
could get confused.

1276
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,733
Oh, what have
I done?

1277
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:58,167
This--

1278
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,833
This is-- I've made
a really big mistake.

1279

Alice, what
are you doing?

1283
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:13,667
I, well, I can't
stay here if I don't...

Uh...

1290
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:30,233
Does anyone have a phone
that I could use?

1291
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,267
Sure, honey,
pass me that.

00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,467
Open your mind to the
universal consciousness

1441
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,233
and a teacher
will be provided.

1442
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:10,967
Okay.
That's handy.

1443
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,967
Yes.

1444
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,333
Let's leave metaphysics
aside for the moment.

1445
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:18,433
We're just very happy
that you are here

1446
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:19,433
and that you're safe.

1447
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:20,967
We were awfully
worried about you.

1448
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,833
Come!

1449
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:23,233
Let's have a drink
to celebrate.

1450
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:24,067
Oh, a drink...

1451
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,833
Yeah.

1452
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:26,367
Yeah, that
sounds good.

1453
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:30,867
I was absolutely amazed when
Will told me what happened.

1454
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,000
I mean, how does one end up
at the wrong house?

1455
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,833
(blender whirring)

1456
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:39,867
But then I remembered:
there are no accidents.

1457
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,767
Everything happens
for a reason.

1458
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,667
Well, it's a funny
story actually.

1459
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,000
I, um, I had my phone
ruined at the airport

1460
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:50,467
because somebody accidentally
spilled coffee on it

1461
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,033
and then I went to check
what the address was

1462
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:56,967
of the house I was supposed
to go to and I, um, --

1463
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,033
Is this one of those
energy smoothies?

1464
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:00,367
Hmm?

1465
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,533
Oh, no.

1466
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:05,400
It removes all the, um,
clogged, undigestive matter

1467
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:08,200
and the bacteria that gets
into your intestines

1468
00:55:08,233 --> 00:55:10,500
and clogs them up.

1469
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:12,700
It's just like
your chakras, huh?

1470
00:55:12,733 --> 00:55:14,400
No, not really.

1471
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:19,900
Happy holidays to the
newest member of our family;

1472
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:21,567
welcome, Alice.

1473
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,500
Thank you so much.

1474
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:24,767
Cheers.

1475
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:29,767
It's my own recipe.

1476
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:33,867
It's a blend
of yeast extract,

1477
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,200
root vegetables,
and fermented bran.

1478
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,533
That's... that's very...
macro-delicious.

1479
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,533
Oh, thank you
so much!

1480
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:45,967
I'm so glad you like it.
There's plenty more.

1481
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:47,633
Good.

1482
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:49,733
Who left the suitcase right in
front of the front door?!

1483
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:50,733
We're in here, Roy!

1484
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:51,567
Yes, yes, yes.

1485
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,600
Ugh.

1486
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,333
Hey!
Will, my boy!

1487
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:57,600
Dad.
Good to see you.

1488
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:58,900
Good to see you too.

1489
00:55:58,933 --> 00:56:01,133
Dad.
This is Alice.

1490
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:04,767
Hello, Mr. Mitchum.
It is so nice to meet you.

1491
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,533
Mmmmm!

1492
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:07,367
Well, please,
call me Roy.

1493
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,200
Roy.

1494
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:08,767
(laughing)

1495
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,567
Here you go.

1496
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,367
Oh--

1497
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,400
One more.

1498
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:12,267
Oh.

1499
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,767
(cell phone ringing)

1500
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,200
Oh, uh,
is that mine?

1501
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:16,767
Mine.

1502
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,200
Oh.

1503
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:17,967
That's you.

1504
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,767
Hmm?

1505
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,800
It's mine?

1506
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:23,200
Oh yup,
here we go.

1507
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:24,967
Uh, Roy Mitchum?

1508
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,567
It's me.

1509
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,300
Yeah, yeah.

1510
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:28,100
No, no - now's
a good time.

1511
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:30,367
Yeah, no, your
timing's great.

1512
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,800
Yeah, no, I'm just putting
the proposal together now.

1513
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:35,600
Like father, like son.

1514
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:36,600
That's incredible.

1515
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:37,633
Mmhmm.

1516
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:40,400
Drink up.

1517
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:41,333
Oh.

1518
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:43,500
I'll have it by
the end of the night.

1519
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,800
Ahhh, my old room.

1520
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:51,233
(chuckling)

1521
00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:53,233
Had a lot of good
memories here.

1522
00:56:53,267 --> 00:56:54,600
Oh, wow!

1523
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:57,067
I never took you for
the sporting type!

1524
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,000
Mmhmm.

1525
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:02,033
Hey, that is my very
first sales award.

1526
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,000
I sold two hundred
pounds of fertilizer

1527
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:07,033
and I wasn't even
a Weebalow yet.

1528
00:57:07,067 --> 00:57:08,433
A weebalow?

1529
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:09,467
Yeah.

1530
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:12,333
It's the highest you
can go as a Cub Scout

1531
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:13,833
before you get
to Boy Scouts.

1532
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:16,700
I was a Bear Cub, which
is one before Weebalow.

1533
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,833
That's so sweet.

1534
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:21,967
You know, I was learning
responsibility

1535
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,600
and accounting from
a very early age.

1536
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:26,167
Maybe if you'd been
a Weebalow

1537
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,033
your store would
be in the black.

1538
00:57:28,467 --> 00:57:31,067
Sometimes in life
you just gotta sell.

1539
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:34,200
I'm going to go
take a shower.

1540

all that the wrong way.

And what way
would that be?

1550
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:13,233
Alice. I'm a salesman.
I sell - that's what I do.

1551
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:14,667
And I'm good at it.

1552
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,900
Well, I'm great
at it actually.

1553
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:22,567
You are a collector -
a buyer, if you will.

1554
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:27,033
And you hold on to things
just a little too tightly.

1555
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:31,667
Sometimes, you
just gotta let go.

1556
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,700
And you'll get there.

1557
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:36,267
Hey, with my help, you
could be one of the best.

1558

Now, why don't you let me
make it up to you, hmm?

Do you want to go
for a walk with me?

Never been.

Yeah.

It's way too cold
tonight, hmm?

01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,700
Isn't it?

1620
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:10,667
Yeah!

1621
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,667
Wow...

1622
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,767
And peaceful.

1623
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,567
As a kid I could just
look at it for hours;

1624
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,333
get lost in
my own world.

1625
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,100
That's lovely.

1626
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,700
Then I thought, "What'd
make this better but--?"

1627
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:27,800
A bench?

1628
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,300
A place
to watch it from.

1629
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:31,600
The wood's from an old
ship, the bolts are

1630
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:34,100
from a church that
burned down in a fire.

1631
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:35,700
Wait, you built this?

1632
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,233
It's just a bench.

1633
01:01:38,933 --> 01:01:40,933
"Here we will sit
and let the sounds

1634
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:43,533
of music creep
in our ears."

1635
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:44,900
"Soft stillness
and the night,

1636
01:01:44,933 --> 01:01:47,267
become the touches
of sweet harmony."

1637
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,433
(chuckles)

1638
01:01:48,467 --> 01:01:50,400
Merchant of Venice.

1639
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:51,900
The lady knows
her Shakespeare.

1640
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:54,200
Aw, this isn't
just a bench.

1641
01:01:54,233 --> 01:01:55,433
Sit, please.

1642
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,133
You know, I would love
to have these in my store.

1643
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:03,733
I'm sure
I could sell these.

1644
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:04,400
Yeah?

1645
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,933
Yeah!
Absolutely.

1646
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:07,967
Good eye.

1647
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,733
This bench -
this, I got right.

1648
01:02:11,767 --> 01:02:14,133
I'd say you get
a lot right.

1649
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,800
I mean, you're
doing what you love;

1650
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,400
you're good at it.
It's working for you.

1651

living the dream.

make you laugh?

1654
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,600
Yeah.
Absolutely.

1655
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:35,167
I once ran for student
council just so I could

1656
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,167
put up signs:
"They will wear hair nets"

1657
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,967
for the cafeteria
staff 'cause, like,

1658
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,767
who wants a hair
in their tater-tots?

1659
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,600

is very important.

1664
01:02:55,467 --> 01:02:56,567
Yes.

1665
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,100
Especially after
I spilt coffee on you,

1666
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:01,467
wrecked your blouse -
not to mention your phone,

1667
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,267
almost killed you
in a car accident.

1668

(laughing)

1669
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:06,533
Amazing doesn't even
begin to sum it up.

1670
01:03:09,733 --> 01:03:12,800
Hey, you know what came
into my store the other day?

1671
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,967
A replica of the Burn
Castle Christmas clock.

1672
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,333
Are you serious?

1673
01:03:17,367 --> 01:03:18,767
You're familiar
with it?

1674
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:21,533
Of course.

1675
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,633
Uh, the clock maker who fell
in love with a woman

1676
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,133

promised to another.

1677

frozen in time.

to regret saying this but,

1681

01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,467
"Makes good money."

1796
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:27,133
Yeah, well.

1797
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,300
A love letter that gushing
could only come from my wife.

1798
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,867
Well you're only
supposed to write one thing,

1799
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,600
there are other things
that I could have said.

1800
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:38,833
Yeah, but you chose
to write that, so--

1801
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:42,133
Okay, your turn;
go ahead.

1802
01:09:49,433 --> 01:09:50,400
"She's very low
maintenance."

1803
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:52,033
What is that
supposed to mean?

1804
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:53,600
How'd you know
it was me?

1805
01:09:53,633 --> 01:09:54,900
Maintenance is misspelled.

1806
01:09:54,933 --> 01:09:57,200
Oh--
Uh, well.

1807
01:09:57,233 --> 01:09:59,767
You know, I just
feel that, you know,

1808
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,833
you fill in your time
on your own you don't seem

1809
01:10:02,867 --> 01:10:04,267
to need anybody
around so...

1810
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,000
Maybe I haven't
had a choice.

1811
01:10:06,033 --> 01:10:07,300
Uh huh--

1812
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,067
Well, I go in to work everyday
so I can make the good money.

1813
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,267
Okay, my turn.

1814
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:13,433
Let's see what
we have here.

1815
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:19,233
"Is very easy
on the eyes."

1816
01:10:19,267 --> 01:10:20,100
Ah.

1817
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:22,233
Thank you, Roy.

1818
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:25,067
Very welcome.
Ha ha.

1819
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,100
Next.

1820
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:29,633
"Loves my son."

1821
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,200
Yup, that's-
that's true.

1822
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,167
And last,
but not least,

1823
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,400
"is a multi-millionaire?"

1824
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,500
Surprise!

1825
01:10:45,633 --> 01:10:47,133
I don't understand?

1826
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,333
Ahem.

1827
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,600
Excuse me, Dad.

1828
01:10:50,633 --> 01:10:53,500
Mom. Dad. Alice.

1829
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:56,267
Uh, you know, I was going
to wait until Christmas

1830
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,333
but I guess I can give you your
present a little bit early.

1831
01:11:00,367 --> 01:11:03,033
You may noticed I've been
doing a lot of texting

1832
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:04,300
and phone calling.

1833
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:07,667
Well, I haven't exactly
been wasting my time here.

1834
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:12,133
I closed a huge deal
with Grant Lockley.

1835
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,133
Fantastic!

1836
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,133
As you know, he's been
trying to develop

1837
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:17,200
the entire block that
your store is on.

1838
01:11:17,233 --> 01:11:20,300
He's got all the other
property owners on board -

1839
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:22,300
YOU are the only
hold out.

1840
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:23,533
And?

1841
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:28,433
And I used that as leverage to
get him to pay top dollar.

1842
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:30,667
Your little store--

1843
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,233
How does
3.5 million sound?

1844
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:36,167
Holy!
(laughing)

1845
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:36,733
Boom!

1846
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:38,533
Honey,
well done!

1847
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:40,167
Chip off
the old block, son!

1848
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:40,933
Thanks, Dad!

1849
01:11:40,967 --> 01:11:41,933
Congratulations!

1850
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:44,333

know what to say.

1851
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:46,133
I'm speechless.

1852
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,500
Well, you can say 'yes?'

1853
01:11:48,033 --> 01:11:49,567
I--

1854
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,933
You know, I think I
need some alone time

1855
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:55,167
to-to process this.
It's a really big decision.

1856
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,333
You know, the store's been
in my family for a long time.

1857
01:11:58,367 --> 01:12:01,233
Hey, I totally understand.

1858
01:12:01,267 --> 01:12:03,967
I mean, I-I appreciate and
respect the fact that

1859
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,333
you want to respond
and not react.

1860
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:08,800
That is the responsible
thing to do.

1861
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,367
Hey, just remember:
you and I are going

1862
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,967

family memories, hmm?

old store's gone,

1864

you'll still have
your old memories.

1865
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,233
I'm gonna just
take a walk.

the walking?

1867
01:12:26,233 --> 01:12:27,267
She's a city girl.

Really?

I didn't think he would ever

I don't know if we make
our own fates

or if it's written
down somewhere,

1894

years before
we're born.

1895

I do know one thing

1897
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:18,867
life is about timing.

1898

Young at heart.

1904

(laughing)
Yeah.

1905
01:14:42,133 --> 01:14:43,467
Merry Christmas.

Grandpa Mitchum.
The other Mitchum.

He was just in
the neighborhood.

Oh, well, uh.
Listen--

I know you've had a
big day, but before

1911
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:03,433
you give me your answer,
if you'll just come with me.

1912
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:05,933
I have another
gift for you.

1913
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:08,100
I really don't know how
many more surprises

1914
01:15:08,133 --> 01:15:10,267
I can take
from one day.

1915
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,300
I think you're going
to like this one.

1916
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:21,167
It's okay; sit.

1917
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,767
Perfect.

1918
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,100
Now, I know we don't normally
do the present thing

1919
01:15:34,133 --> 01:15:37,567
in my family but I
thought because this

1920
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,600
is a very special holiday that
I would make an exception.

1921
01:15:42,933 --> 01:15:45,433
But before you open it,

1922
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:47,133
I want to apologize.

1923
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,467
That was just
so stupid of me

1924
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:56,200
to present the offer
without any warning.

1925
01:15:56,233 --> 01:16:00,467
I mean, uh, especially
in front of my parents.

1926
01:16:02,367 --> 01:16:04,600
It put a lot of
pressure on you.

1927
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:06,367
And it's perfectly
understandable

1928
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,000
that you'd get upset.

1929
01:16:09,033 --> 01:16:12,667
It's just...
well, you know

1930
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,800
I always want to
take care of you.

1931
01:16:16,633 --> 01:16:17,967
You know that, right?

1932
01:16:21,233 --> 01:16:22,867
Go ahead.
Open it.

1933
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:37,033
What is this?

1934
01:16:37,067 --> 01:16:41,467
It's a lease for store that's
just three blocks away.

1935
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,633
It-It's bigger and has way
more street traffic flow.

1936
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:48,467
And with the money that
you get from the old store

1937
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,233
you can buy lots
of additional stock,

1938
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:52,333
you can hire a
few people to help.

1939
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:55,367
Alice - it would
be a real store.

1940
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,700
A "real" store?

1941
01:16:57,733 --> 01:17:00,967
One that would turn
over a steady profit.

1942
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,800
You could have your own
cafe - with your own theme;

1943
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:07,400
no fifties style
Jane knockoff.

1944
01:17:07,433 --> 01:17:09,767
But, it wouldn't be
my Father's store.

1945
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:14,133
But it would be a darn good
compromise, wouldn't it?

1946
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:19,233
It would definitely
be a compromise.

1947

Come on.

1948
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:23,867
