00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:11,467
â™ª

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,267
Have a merry,
merry Christmas!

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,967
Buh bye,
Merry Christmas!

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,233
Ugh--

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,467
(on phone)
Yeah, great.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,600
I'll arrange the inspection
and I'll get those papers

7
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:28,967
over to you
within the hour.

8
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:30,967
All right.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,633
Great.
Talk to you then.

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,600
Wow, a Christmas tree!

11
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,300
Yeah--

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,333
It's beautiful!

13
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:38,500
Well, it's fake.

14
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:39,333
Oh.

15
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,567
But, I did buy
a bottle

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,733
of blue spruce scented
deodorizing spray.

17
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:46,467
Don't you just
think of everything?

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,300
Mmm-hmmm.

19
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,767
It's perfect!

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,167
It's just a little too perfect
don't you think?

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
You're the expert.

22
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,733
Maybe if I just cut a
few of the branches off?

23
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,033
What do we got here?

24
00:00:58,067 --> 00:00:59,100
Where?
Oh!

25
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,100
That's a late eighteenth
century replica

26
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,467
of the Burn Castle
Christmas Clock.

27
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,767
This must be worth
a small fortune.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,933
Did you see?

29
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,533
Look at all the little
hand-painted pictograms.

30
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,300
What does something
like this sell for?

31
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,333
Oh I can't - I don't think
I could ever sell this.

32
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,633
This is beautiful.

33
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,533
Remember asking me
to tell you

34
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,333
to stop doing that
thing you do?

35
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:21,633
I know, I know -
but this is different.

36
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:22,900
This is very special.

37
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:23,933
Alice...

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,833
I know, you're right.

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,367
Being right doesn't
mean that I'm not sorry.

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,167
(laughing)

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Thanks.

42
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,133
Hey did, um,

43
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,967
that developer
ever call you?

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,733
Nope.

45
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:42,600
No?

46
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,967
Have I ever
told you the story

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,900
of the Burn Castle
Christmas Clock?

48
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,567
No...but I think
you're going to.

49
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,967
(laughing)

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Well, sometime in the
late eighteenth century,

51
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:57,367
a young clock maker
and a peasant girl

52
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,333
fell madly in love
with each other.

53
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:01,600
She was the most beautiful
woman in the village

54
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,200
but her parents had already
promised her to someone else.

55
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:07,000
So the clock maker decided
that if he were to make

56
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:09,500
the most magnificent
clock ever known to man,

57
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,200
her parents
would reconsider

58
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:13,433
and break the
arranged engagement.

59
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,767
When the young woman's suitor
got wind of these plans

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,000
he whisked her off to a
villa far, far away.

61
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:24,367
And then the day before
Christmas, a gift arrived

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,933
for the young woman
and when she opened it

63
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:30,433
she found the most beautiful
clock she had ever seen.

64
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:33,100
So beautiful, thst she secretly
carried it with her

65
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,600
wherever she went from
that day forward.

66
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,400
On her wedding day,
she wept over the clock -

67
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,867
praying for a miracle.

68
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,867
And just as she walked
down the aisle,

69
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,100
the clock stopped.

70
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:50,033
Everyone and everything
in the church stopped;

71
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:53,967
frozen in time and she
ran out of the church,

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,267
bursting through the doors
in to the Town Square

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,467
and runs into the clock maker,
who's rushing towards her

74
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,833
past all the town's folk
who are frozen in time.

75
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,433
And they ran off together and
they lived happily ever after,

76
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,133
never to be seen again...
or so the story goes.

77
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,133
(laughing)

78
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,767
Oh, you know,
I've been meaning

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,733
to organize that
shelf for weeks.

80
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:22,567
Yeah, well, we
make a great team.

81
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,033
We make the best.

82
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,067
The best.

83
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,900
Thank you.

84
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,067
You're welcome.

85
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,200
Hey, do you have the
store's books ready?

86
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:31,033
I haven't gotten
around to it yet.

87
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,400
I KNOW!

88
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:36,100
I know it's important;
I will do it. I promise.

89
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,933
Hey, uh, what's the square
footage of this place again?

90
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't know.

91
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:43,933
I think it's, like, 1,200
or something, why?

92
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,300
(phone ringing)

93
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,000
Sorry.

94
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,033
It's all right.

95
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,500
Oh, man.
It's Mike Harper.

96
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,333
Meeting him for
squash, I gotta go.

97
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,100
Oh--

98
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:52,500
Listen,
I'll see you later.

99
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,600
Don't forget: 7:30
tonight, Earth Works.

100
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:55,633
Got it!

101
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,100
Mike!
Will Mitchum here.

102
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,500
You ready
to do this?

103
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:11,700
â™ª

104
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,333
Hey! Guess who just
sold the Weston condo

105
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,133
for two hundred
K over asking?

106
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,533
That's amazing!

107
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,400
Congratulations,
we have to celebrate!

108
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,500
Absolutely.

109
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,867
You know, you have to
try the tofu plate here.

110
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,133
You'll swear it's
just like kobe beef.

111
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:26,333
Wow!

112
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,967
Did you ever call
that developer?

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,067
Mmmhmm.

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,033
I told him I'm not interested
in selling the shop.

115
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:31,867
That's smart.

116
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,967
He's not offering
nearly enough.

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,833
Antiques may have
relative value

118
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,767
but commercial real estate
in Brooklyn does not.

119
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,567
Oh, this is lovely.

120
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Isn't it?

121
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,567
I just don't think I could
ever sell my father's store

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,167
for any amount
of money.

123
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,533
I mean, it's all
I have left of him.

124
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:52,333
Hmmm.

125
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:53,567
Thank you.

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,933
Well, just as long
as you know

127
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:58,000
you can get money
out of that store.

128
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,400
That's all I'm saying.

129
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,267
Oh.

130
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,267
Oh--

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Thank you.

132
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,367
That was nice.

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,633
Thank you.

134
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,200
Alice--

135
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,200
Yup.

136
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:11,800
I have something
to ask you.

137
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,133
Oh, what?

138
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:16,733
Pssst!
SNAP!

139
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:20,400
Um, what's this,
after dinner salad?

140
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,267
(chuckling)

141
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,200
If you could just
move your chair -

142
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,767
just move in to the light,
just a little bit?

143
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,033
That is perfect.

144
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:27,867
Ahem.

145
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:32,200
(tapping on glass)

146
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,233
Ladies and gentlemen,

147
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,700
may I have your
attention please?

148
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:35,733
Ahem.

149
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:38,633
My name is Will Mitchum
and I am madly in love

150
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:39,900
with Alice Chapman.

151
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,333
Will, what
are you doing?

152
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,767
It's true.
It's so true.

153
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,300
And I know this is
going to sound corny,

154
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,967
but, love is corny so I'm
going to say it anyways.

155
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,600
You told me that your
favorite jelly belly flavor

156
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:57,067
was toasted marshmallow
because you love the taste

157
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,800
of the charred skin
on the outside

158
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,167
and totally got the melt
in your mouth middle

159
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,667
and that's because
that's you, Alice.

160
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,933
Indomitable exterior.

161
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,233
Yet tender
on the inside.

162
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,633
Will this is crazy,
what are you doing?

163
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,700
Love is crazy, baby.

164
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Alice.

165
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,100
You are my sun,
my rain, my life.

166
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:26,467
â™ª

167
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,967
Will you marry me?

168
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
Uhhh...

169
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,867
Wow, I-I don't
know what to say.

170
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,000
I mean--

171
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,633
uh...yeah?

172
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:44,700
(laughing)

173
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,633
Of course, yes.

174
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:47,333
Yes.

175
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,100
Yes.

176
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,367
Two carrots - get it?

177
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,867
I arranged that
with the restaurant.

178
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,300
Yeah, yeah,
I get it.

179
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,333
Wow.

180
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,700
(applause)

181
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,700
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

182
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:10,300
â™ª

183
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,300
Oh.

184
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,300
Oh, that's okay.

185
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,567
We'll get it
sized tomorrow.

186
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,667
Yeah, no, I don't
think we have time.

187
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,333
Well, see, I have
another proposal.

188
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:19,600
I thought that, well;
my parents would love

189
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:20,900
to meet their future
daughter-in-law

190
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:23,167
so why don't we spend
Christmas at their house?

191
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,167
Really!?
Your parents?!

192
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,333
Oh, I'd love to get
to meet them finally!

193
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,833
Maybe we can go chop down
a Christmas tree together?

194
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,367
Or - well, they probably
already have one of those.

195
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,367
I hope we're not too late
to decorate it at least -

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,167
or maybe we could
make some decorations?

197
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,000
Or, cookies!

198
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,167
Yes, we've got
to make cookies.

199
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,967
My Dad and I
used to make

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,233
the most amazing
Christmas cookies.

201
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:42,933
They were cherrios and
marshmallows shaped

202
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,533
in the form of a Christmas
tree with this green,

203
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,300
sugar glaze on the outside.
They were to die for!

204
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,733
My mother's macrobiotic.

205
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:51,967
Oh.

206
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:54,033
Oh.

207
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:54,967
What about
Christmas stockings?

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,967
Do you have one?

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,733
I could make
you one if not,

210
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,233
it's not that hard
at all.

211
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,767
It's just some felt,
some glue...

212
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,267
What about Christmas
peanut butter fudge?

213
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,767
Think your parents
would like that?

214
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,033
I have this new recipe
I'm dying to try.

215
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,433
Oh, wait.
It's not microbiotic.

216
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,133
Macro.

217
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:08,767
Oh.

218
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,967
Oh - whoa,
whoa, whoa!

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,767
This is amazing!
I can't believe this!

220
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,767
What?

221
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,767
I finally got an offer
on the Harris estate!

222
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,900
Oh, that's great!

223
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,367
I gotta make a counter offer
ASAP - gimme your phone.

224
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,967
My phone?

225
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,767
Yeah.

226
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:22,867
Thank you.

227
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,467
So this is my parents'
address in Beresford.

228
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,400
You go--

229
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,733
And I'll be there
as soon as I can.

230
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,000
What - you're
not coming?

231
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,267
But - but I don't
even know your parents!

232
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,567
I can't, what--
I mean...?

233
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,100
Don't worry about it!
It's not like they bite.

234
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,900
Just take a cab
from the airport

235
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:41,433
and I'll be on the next
flight right behind you.

236
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,233
I just can't
barge in and say

237
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,733
"Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm gonna marry your son."

238
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:47,233
What if they
don't like me?

239
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,100
How could anyone
not like you?

240
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:52,133
And just wait until you
tell them how I proposed.

241
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,833
They are going
to LOVE it!

242
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,833
See you in Beresford.

243
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,467
O-okay?

244
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:00,267
I love you!

245
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,467
Love you too!

246
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:14,833
â™ª

247
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:17,033
Hey, Will, it's me.

248
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,533
â™ª

249
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:20,167
Whoa...

250
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,467
Sir, can I help you?

251
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,467
I'm at the Beresford
airport. I just landed,

252
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,300
and you're not going
to believe this,

253
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,567
but they've lost
my luggage.

254
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,867
Sir, can I help you?

255
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,067
Uh, I hope so.

256
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,333
Maybe if you get this
message you could let

257
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,100
your parents know I'm going
to be running a little late

258
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:37,400
'cause I have to file a claim
now and there's a big line.

259
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:40,200
Um, ok, I'm going to check
the carousel one more time

260
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:43,000
but nothing's come down the
shute in twenty minutes

261
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,900
so I don't have a lot of hope.
I'm rambling...all right.

262
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:46,967
I'll let you go.

263
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,667
If you get this
message, call me.

264
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Okay, have
a good flight.

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,867
(sighs)

266
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,967
I paid an extra fee
when I checked in.

267
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,833
They wrapped it up
in fragile tape

268
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:59,600
how do you lose
something like that?

269
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,100
Sir, it's not lost,
simply misplaced.

270
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,367
But, that's
the same thing!

271
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,133
I am trying
to help you, sir.

272
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,633
I'm trying to tell you
that if it's not here

273
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,400
by Christmas then
it's a total loss.

274
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,167
It is our policy
to compensate you

275
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,667
for the value of your package
if it's not recovered.

276
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,233
It's priceless.

277
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,233
Was it insured?

278
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,900
No.
I made it.

279
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:17,767
Okay?

280
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,500
I spent six
months making it,

281
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,900
working on every little
detail until it was perfect.

282
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,700
Ok, sir, please
fill out this form.

283
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,700
If it's not recovered
the airline will assess

284
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,533
the monetary value
of your package -

285
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,167
It's not about
the money.

286
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,167
It's a special gift
for my Grandfather.

287
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,400
Would you like
to borrow a pen?

288
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,533
Sure.

289
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:41,633
Thanks.

290
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:46,867
Thank you for flying
with us and Happy Holidays.

291
00:10:46,900 --> 00:11:07,167
â™ª

292
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,567
I feel like I'm
writing my memoirs.

293
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,833
Pardon?

294
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,767
This form... it's huge.

295
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,767
It's not enough that
they lose your valuables.

296
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,533
Now you have
to write an essay

297
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,400
in order to maybe
get them back.

298
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,567
Insult to injury.

299
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Exactly.

300
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,967
I'm really sorry
they lost your package.

301
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Me too.

302
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,633
I mean, I'm sorry
they lost your bag.

303
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:33,633
Oh!

304
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,367
Mine was just clothes.
Nothing important.

305
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,167
(sighing)

306
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,167
Hey, I'll see you around.

307
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:50,800
Merry Christmas.

308
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,700
Yeah.
Merry Christmas.

309
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:56,667
"See you around?"
Come on, Matt.

310
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,467
That's like,
amateur hour.

311
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,400
Come up with
something clever.

312
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,800
Something witty...

313
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,533
Like...

314
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:06,867
Hey, would you
like to--?

315
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,300
(both screaming)

316
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,533
I'm so sorry!

317
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:11,833
Uh...

318
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:14,467
Please tell me this is
just a little tiny stain

319
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,467
that's barely
noticeable?

320
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,833
And can just be dabbed out
with a tissue?

321
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,000
It would have to be
a pretty big tissue.

322
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,467
I am so sorry!

323
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,633
I'm about to meet
my future family!

324
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,500
This is the only
outfit I have!

325
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,833
â™ª

326
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,533
This is totally
my fault.

327
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:38,800
Yeah,
it kind of is.

328
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,567
What can I do
to fix things?

329
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,067
Do you own
a dry cleaners?

330
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,067
No. But I could
take you to one?

331
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,200
No wait! I know.

332
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:48,067
I'll buy you a new shirt -
I know the perfect store!

333
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,833
Is it on the way
to Beresford?

334
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:50,200
Beresford?

335
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:50,833
Uh-huh.

336
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:51,733
That's where
I'm going!

337
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:52,333
Ok.

338
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:53,500
You can ride
with me!

339
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,333
Great!

340
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,833
We'll stop and
buy you a new shirt,

341
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,167
you can be
at your...

342
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,700
Future in-laws.

343
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,867
You're engaged.

344
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,633
Okay.
That makes sense.

345
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,400
So, only fifteen or
twenty minutes away.

346
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,933
No, you know what?
It's fine.

347
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,967
Just bad timing.
Don't worry about it.

348
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:07,933
So where is he?

349
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,533
Who?

350
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:09,700
Your fiancÃ©?

351
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,867
Oh, he had a meeting.
He'll be on the next flight.

352
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,633
Oh, I'm sorry.

353
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,800
No.

354
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,200
It was an important meeting.
He had to close a deal.

355
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,400
A big deal.

356
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,300
Oh, no!

357
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,533
Oh, please tell me
this is not happening!

358
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,533
It's just a phone.
I'll get it fixed.

359
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,533
No, I have no idea
where I'm going!

360
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,033
My address was
in here!

361
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,533
I don't know where I'm
supposed to go right now.

362
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,800
Take my phone, call your
fiancÃ©, get the address.

363
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, I feel so stupid.

364
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,900
Don't, just - this kind of
thing could happen to anybody.

365
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,233
Hi, you've reached Will
Mi Please leave me a message.

366
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:44,567
Hey, Will,
it's me again.

367
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,133
You're going right
to voicemail.

368
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,733
Um, well,
I'm kind of lost.

369
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,767
They didn't find my bag and my
phone is out of commission.

370
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,567
So, I'm going to try you
again in a few minutes,

371
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
if a strange number
pops up please answer it.

372
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,667
It might just be the
future Mrs. Mitchum.

373
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:00,667
Thanks.

374
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,733
Did you say "Mitchum"?

375
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:02,500
Uh-huh.

376
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,333
You're kidding.

377
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,467
No, why?

378
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,967
I'm a Mitchum.

379
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,100
What's your
fiancÃ©'s name?

380
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,600
Will.
Will Mitchum.

381
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,133
You're engaged
to Billy Mitchum?

382
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,300
Billy's my brother.

383
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,367
Will's your brother?!

384
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,967
Will?
We never called him Will.

385
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You know, I bet he changed it
to sound more grown up.

386
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,967
Oh, Will is very
grown up.

387
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,267
This - this is freaky!

388
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,367
He never told me
he had a brother!

389
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,167
He never mentioned
he had a fiancÃ©e.

390
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,700
Well, we were gonna wait
to tell everybody together.

391
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:29,767
(laughing)

392
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I guess the cat's
out of the bag.

393
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,367
I'm Matt.

394
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,767
Alice.

395
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,167
You know what, Alice?

396
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,800
This here is fate.

397
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,467
(laughing)

398
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,467
So, how did you
and Billy meet?

399
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,267
Oh!

400
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,533
Will and I met
on "mates.com".

401
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,367
Really?

402
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Mmhmm.

403
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:50,200
Can't imagine Billy -
Willy - Will going

404
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:52,300
for internet
match making.

405
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,400
Well, believe me
I didn't either.

406
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:58,800
I mean, you know, it was a
kind of a weird time for me.

407
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,033
My Dad died
a few years ago

408
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,900
and my Mom decided
to move to Florida

409
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:08,133
to spend time
with her sister, so.

410
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:11,167
Anyway, all my friends
are doing Internet dating

411
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,200
and I thought I'd give
it a try and bingo!

412
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,433
There - there was
Will and we had

413
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:20,467
a seventy-five percent
compatibility rating so...

414
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,233
Seventy-five percent?

415
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,300
Mmmhmm.

416
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,167
So that's a going rate
for a husband online.

417
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,667
Pretty scientific.

418
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,033
Yeah, well.

419
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,233
It seems to work,
believe it or not.

420
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,100
I mean -
no, Will is great!

421
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,233
He's - he's
practical and, uh,

422
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,667
level-headed and he,
as you know,

423
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,433
he's very smart
with business.

424
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:41,733
Just like Juliet
described Romeo.

425
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:43,833
Not so much.
(laughing)

426
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:45,833
Will is very romantic!

427
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,733
I'll have you know
he sends me

428
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,967
a dozen red roses
every Friday.

429
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,600
Really?

430
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:51,633
Yeah.

431
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,367
Well, you know, I guess
Billy and I just have

432
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,467
different ideas
of what romance is.

433
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,467
To me, romance is doing
the dishes with somebody

434
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,767
or doing the laundry
together where like,

435
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,933
the simplest thing
is amazing.

436
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,867
â™ª

437
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,700
Let's see that ring
of yours!

438
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,933
Oh, yeah!

439
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,667
It's in my
pocket here.

440
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:18,533
Here it is.

441
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,667
Wow.

442
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,067
It's a little big, that's
why I don't have it on.

443
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,900
It's beautiful.

444
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:23,667
Thank you.

445
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,633
Can I see?

446
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,667
Mmhmm.

447
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,500
Oh! Oh!

448
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,133
Sorry!

449
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,033
I'll find it.

450
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,933
No, no. I got it.
It's right here.

451
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,733
(gasp)
Matt! LOOK OUT!

452
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:34,333
CRASH!

453
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,500
Oh, good.
You're awake.

454
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,900
You were beginning
to have me worried.

455
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,100
Who hit me in the head
with a sledgehammer?

456
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,500
Close enough.

457
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,333
We hit a tree.

458
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:57,333
Oh, gosh,
now I remember.

459
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:58,933
Are you okay?

460
00:16:58,967 --> 00:16:59,933
I'm okay.

461
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:00,933
You're both lucky.

462
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,933
It looks like both
of you have nothing

463
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,433
but a few scrapes
and bruises.

464
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:07,433
Just gonna keep you here a bit
to check for internal bleeding.

465
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,600
That doesn't
sound good.

466
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:10,600
It's just precaution,
nothing to worry about.

467
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:12,233
We'll notify
your family.

468
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:21,800
(sighing)

469
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,967
You have
clean fingernails.

470
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,500
As opposed to...?

471
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
Your fingernails
are very clean.

472
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,367
(laughing)

473
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,967
Okay.

474
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,433
Thank you, I think.

475
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,300
My father always told me
if I didn't know what

476
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,300
to say to a girl,
just compliment her.

477
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,167
(laughing)

478
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,167
I should know not
to listen to him.

479
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,700
I went to prom in a
powder blue leisure suit

480
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,967
because he told me
it looked sophisticated.

481
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,167
In 1999.

482
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,900
(laughing)

483
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,167
Wow...

484
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,000
Billy was always
better with the ladies.

485
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:01,200
Are you kidding me?

486
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:02,833
Our first date
was a disaster.

487
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,267
He spent the whole
time interviewing me.

488
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,400
Yeah?

489
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,767
"Do you want kids?",
"Do you like opera?",

490
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,333
"Would you be willing to
drop everything and be my

491
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,033
partner if my business
picks up in another state?".

492
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,333
(laughing)

493
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:16,200
Really?

494
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,000
Mmhm.

495
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:17,833
I don't know.

496
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,733
It was kind of
endearing, I guess.

497
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,433
It was refreshing that he
actually knew what he wanted.

498
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,100
Smart.

499
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,200
I should have taken that
approach with my fiancÃ©e.

500
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,433
Oh, you're engaged?

501
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,033
I was.

502
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,900
Oh. Sorry.

503
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,367
Last summer.

504
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,567
She just up and
moved to Paris.

505
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,567
You know, I would do
nice things for her,

506
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,867
and she would tell me
I was smothering her

507
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,633
so I stopped and suddenly
I was cold and uncaring.

508
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,033
She sounds confused.

509
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,233
She confused
the heck out of me.

510
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,000
You know what
the worst was?

511
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,633
I had this important
business presentation.

512
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,700
I was dressed in a suit,
had to get up in front

513
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:03,967
of a few hundred people at
this annual conference

514
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,033
and it was raining.

515
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:07,733
Don't get me wrong, I love
the rain but we forgot

516
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:10,267
the umbrella and I was
driving and so I asked

517
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,533
if I could get out at the front
door and if she could

518
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,800
get street parking,
you know, so I wouldn't look

519
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,467
like a drown rat on
stage and she refused.

520
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,900
She said she didn't
want to get all wet

521
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,533
and I thought,

522
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,333
she wouldn't even walk
through the rain for me.

523
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,600
I don't know about you,
but where I come from,

524
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,667
love walks through
the rain.

525
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,533
Yeah.

526
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,533
It should.

527
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,533
It has to.

528
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,467
I sure hope it does.

529
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:53,667
I'm sorry.

530
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,433
Don't be.

531
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:58,067
Breaking it off was the best
thing I could have done.

532
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,367
Still hurts
a little, huh?

533
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,833
Just a little
around the holidays.

534
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,533
Oh, Matt!

535
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,733
Matty, Matty, Matty.

536
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:20,533
Oh, Matty!

537
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,700
Hey, Mom--

538
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,733
We came as soon as
the hospital called.

539
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,767
Mom, I can't breathe!

540
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,133
Easy, honey.

541
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:27,933
Mom--

542
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:29,633
Give him some air.

543
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,333
Sorry, sweetie.
Are you okay?

544
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,133
It only hurts
when I laugh.

545
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,733
(laughing)

546
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,133
Just like now.

547
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,133
Oh, hi!

548
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,000
Hi!

549
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,367
We're his parents.

550
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,900
It's so nice
to meet you.

551
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,700
I've heard so much
about you both.

552
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,667
Oh Mom, Dad,
this is Alice.

553
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,167
You didn't tell me
you're bringing

554
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,433
a girlfriend home
for Christmas!

555
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,733
You didn't even tell us
you had a girlfriend!

556
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,400
No no, I'm not his --

557
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,733
Alice is
Billy's fiancÃ©e

558
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,933
Billy's...engaged?

559
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,033
Yeah.

560
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,767
He didn't tell us
anything about --

561
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,167
Well, we wanted
to surprise you.

562
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,067
Surprise!

563
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,433
Oh well --

564
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:04,367
She's surprised.

565
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,867
You certainly did that,
didn't she, Joe?

566
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,833
Sorry.

567
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,000
We never heard a word
from him, I mean --

568
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,033
So, where's
Billy now?

569
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,800
He had a work
thing come up

570
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,133
so he wasn't able
to fly in with me.

571
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,933
He was laid up
but he's coming.

572
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:19,033
I asked the nurse
to call him.

573
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:22,800
This is the most wonderful
Christmas surprise!

574
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,300
It's so nice
to meet you.

575
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,633
And you!

576
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,067
You both got pretty
good knocks on the head.

577
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,800
I want you both under
constant surveillance

578
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,100
for the next twenty-four
hours just to be sure.

579
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:34,100
No sleeping until the
observation period is over.

580
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,400
I think we can do that,
can't we, Joe?

581
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,533
Absolutely,
thanks Doc.

582
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:38,567
Yeah--

583
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
You know, it is so
perfect that you're here

584
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,367
because with Billy
being late we needed

585
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,900
an extra pairs of hands
to help trim the tree.

586
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,433
Oh, I love trimming
the tree!

587
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,200
Have you made your
Christmas cookies yet?

588
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,333
Not yet.

589
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,400
Oh! 'Cause I have all these
recipes that I brought

590
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:53,467
that I'm dying to try and
they're macrobiotic.

591
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,267
What's macrobiotic?

592
00:21:58,267 --> 00:21:59,100
Wow...

593
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:00,800
This looks like it
would have been

594
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,300
an amazing place
to grow up.

595
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,067
You like it?

596
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,233
I love it.

597
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:06,600
Mom and Dad always go
all out for Christmas.

598
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:08,467
Come on in!

599
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:11,567
I know it's not much,
but we call it home.

600
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,267
It's beautiful!

601
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,400
Maison!

602
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,667
Oh!

603
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
You know
your antiques!

604
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,267
Matt took me to a road
show for my birthday

605
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,867
and that was
my favorite.

606
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,667
I didn't know you
liked antiques!

607
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,433
I do.

608
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,000
This one is part
of a set,

609
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:27,533
I have some of the other
pieces in my store.

610
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:28,800
What?
You have a store?

611
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,767
Well, it was my
father's store.

612
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,267
I practically
grew up there.

613
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,100
Oh!

614
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,867
I'd love to see
it some time!

615
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,967
Only after I confiscate
your credit cards!

616
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,333
Oh stop!

617
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:39,300
(laughing)

618
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,033
Thank you.

619
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:40,767
Hey, hey--

620
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,500
Oh--

621
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,933
Tell me what
you think, huh?

622
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:43,967
Okay.

623
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,567
Mmmm!

624
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,633
Am I tasting --

625
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,200
(together) Allspice?

626
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:51,300
(laughing)

627
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,067
I like this
gal already!

628
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,033
Aww!

629
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,900
All right, Matt in the
living room, please.

630
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,700
Alice, you come on
upstairs with me.

631
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,567
I'm gonna get you in to
something a little more cozy.

632
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Oh, thank you.

633
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:04,433
These will
keep you warm.

634
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,767
There we go.

635
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:09,267
Ugh--

636
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:10,800
You sit right
down here.

637
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,300
Why can't we lie down
in the bedrooms?

638
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,700
Because A) that's where the
Christmas presents are--

639
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:16,733
--that's a girl, dear--

640
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,567
--and B) I have to keep
an eye on you two

641
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,367
and make sure you
don't fall asleep.

642
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,867
I'm gonna make you
some tea.

643
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,633
I don't want
to be any trouble.

644
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,733
No no, I'm gonna make
you some chamomile.

645
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,533
It will help you relax.

646
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,900
You might as well give up
and let her mother you.

647
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,667
I don't want
to be a bother.

648
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,433
Are you kidding?

649
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,067
She loves this
sort of thing.

650
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,333
How are you feeling
by the way?

651
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,333
Oh, I feel fine.

652
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:41,667
Just a little antsy;
I really want to help

653
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,933
with the Christmas
preparations.

654
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:45,700
Tomorrow there'll be
plenty to do, I promise.

655
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,933
Mom won't stop preparing
for Christmas until you

656
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:50,433
physically pry the hot
glue gun out of her hands

657
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:52,767
and force her to have
a glass of eggnog

658
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,767
and actually relax
and enjoy the holiday.

659
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,967
This is
so comfortable.

660
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Mmhmm.

661
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,333
You two aren't
sleeping are ya?

662
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:01,767
No!

663
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,600
Good!

664
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,200
Remember what
the doctor said.

665
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:06,233
Oh, and Grandpa
Charles just called;

666
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:09,367
said he cut down the best
tree in Redmond just for us.

667
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,900
I missed
the tree cutting??

668
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:11,967
You snooze you lose!

669
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,567
I love picking out
the tree!

670
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,633
So do I!

671
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,967
You know, Will actually
just bought a fake tree

672
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,900
for the shop.

673
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:18,700
What?

674
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:19,633
Mmhmm.

675
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,967
Living in the city's
really changing him.

676
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,567
I know. Well, no,
I don't think so.

677
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,167
It's just
the tree's fine,

678
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,400
it's just a little too
perfect that's all.

679
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,800
It's missing--

680
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,400
Character.

681
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,400
Yeah! Exactly.

682
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:32,600
Okay...

683
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:33,800
Here we are!

684
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,000
I thought something
light might be better

685
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,133
because of
your conditions.

686
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:40,133
Here you go honey --
careful, it's hot.

687
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:40,800
Thank you.

688
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:41,800
Here you go, Matt.

689
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:42,600
Thanks, Mom.

690
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:43,833
Thanks, Mrs. Mitchum.

691
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:47,400
Oh please, call me Penny!
We're almost family!

692
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:48,800
Thank you, Penny.

693
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,933
Ok, I'm still baking
cookies in the kitchen

694
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,433
so that's where I'll
be and I want you two

695
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,233
to keep an eye
on each other.

696
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:56,767
If one of
you falls asleep,

697
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,033
I want the other to
give me a holler

698
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:00,367
and I'll come
right in.

699
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:00,900
Ok.

700
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,833
Copy that.

701
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,467
Are you sure
I can't help?

702
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,933
No, you have to wait out
your twenty-four hours.

703
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:09,167
But enjoy this down
time because -- hoo hoo!

704
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,867
-- when Grandpa
gets here...

705
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:12,833
(laughing)
Okay.

706
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:14,833
When Grandpa gets here,
we'll have the tree

707
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,100
to put up
and decorate

708
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,467
and there are only two days
left before Christmas.

709
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,133
How long does it take
to decorate a tree?

710
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,800
A very long time.

711
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:25,700
You'll find out.

712
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,067
Should I be scared?

713
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
Be scared.

714
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,067
(laughing)

715
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,667
â™ª

716
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,167
Three big deals
in two days.

717
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,467
Didn't anybody tell you
there's a recession going on?

718
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,467
You're the man now.

719
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Mmhmm.

720
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,833
And the man needs
another round.

721
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,033
Well, you have
the luck.

722
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:49,033
Word on the street
is that your fiancÃ©e

723
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:50,900
owns that shop
on 23rd,

724
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:53,133
in the block Grant
Lockley wants to buy.

725
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,667
Yeah, but I thought those
are just rumors about Lockley.

726
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,533
Mm-mmm!

727
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,467
I mean, he always
uses Winters anyway,

728
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,567
so what's it matter?

729
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,567
He's desperate.

730
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,567
He wants to buy
that block, raise it,

731
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,500
and put up
a condo tower.

732
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,367
Winters can't
close the deal.

733
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,533
But I can.

734
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,833
Alice'd do anything
I tell her to do.

735
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,700
And speaking of Alice,

736
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:15,333
she's probably at my
parents' by now.

737
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,900
Just gonna
give her a call.

738
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:17,600
Yeah.

739
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:21,433
Voicemail:
Hey, it's Alice.

740
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,933
I'm either away
from my phone

741
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:25,800
or lost reception
so leave a message.

742
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:28,933
Hey, darlin', I'm so sorry
I didn't make it up tonight

743
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:31,900
but I closed this
huge deal and,

744
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:34,367
well, look I'll tell you
all about it tomorrow.

745
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,633
Um, hope my parents
are treating you well.

746
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,267
Have a great
sleep, beautiful.

747
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
I love you.

748
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,100
Message: Hello, Mr. Mitchum,
this is Doctor Stark.

749
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:49,033
I'm calling from
Beresford County...

750
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,733
Well, if it's not
Mr. Mitchum.

751
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:51,933
Mr. Lockley!

752
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,967
Well, how good
to see you, sir.

753
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,867
And, um, congratulations
on the new condos.

754
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,367
Yeah.

755
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,833
Yeah, I hear you're
on your way up.

756
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,533
Yeah, well, I'm, uh,
not doing too bad.

757
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:06,167
You know, I heard you
were having a little bit

758
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,400
of trouble on that
23rd street deal.

759
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,967
Yeah, it's not going to
work out, I'm moving on.

760
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,967
Oh, that's a pity.

761
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,167
That could have been
a lot of money.

762
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,300
Well, you know what?

763
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,400
Sometimes deals
just don't work out.

764
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,167
And you will understand
that when you,

765
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,933
um, get a little
more experience.

766
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:25,833
Right.

767
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,233
What if I told you
that I have a line

768
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:31,267
on the owner for
the antique shop?

769
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,967
She won't sell it.

770
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,500
She will to me.

771
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,033
And why is that?
Huh?

772
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:40,200
Why is that?

773
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:42,433
What, you got some
mystical power over women?

774
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,433
(laughing)

775
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:46,033
No.
She's my fiancÃ©e.

776
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,800
Well, like I said.
I've moved on.

777
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:52,600
And like I said
- what a pity.

778
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:55,533
I mean, now that
something could happen.

779
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,867
I'm going to my parents'
over Christmas and,

780
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,000
I know it's a long shot,
but on the off chance

781
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,700
that you revisit the
23rd street project --

782
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:08,667
give me a call
after the holidays.

783
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,200
Merry Christmas.

784
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:24,033
(TV sounds)

785
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:27,033
There's absolutely
nothing on.

786
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:32,033
Hey--

787
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:34,467
Dozy--
No sleeping!

788
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,467
I can't keep
my eyes open.

789
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,833
This reminds
of when I was a kid.

790
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,367
Billy and I would
have competitions

791
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,933
to see who could
stay awake the longest...

792
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,667
I always lost.

793
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,067
Awww.

794
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,567
We used to build these
elaborate forts out of pillows

795
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,500
and blankets and TV trays
-- everything we could

796
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:53,867
get our hands on
would go in to it.

797
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,500
Then we'd go get our
G.I. JOE flashlights,

798
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:59,967
and go on a mission
for cookies.

799
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,267
A mission?

800
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,867
You feel like
some cookies?

801
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,300
Let's go
on a mission.

802
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,300
Okay! Let's do it!

803
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,633
Shhh.

804
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,933
Shhh.

805
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:14,900
Shhh.

806
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:15,933
Help me up.

807
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:32,533
â™ª

808
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:33,433
Okay...

809
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,700
Eggs and butter
are in there.

810
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,733
Copy that.

811
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,533
And I think the
bowls are in there.

812
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:40,267
Okay.

813
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:50,733
â™ª

814
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,533
Shhh!

815
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:53,433
Shhh...

816
00:29:53,467 --> 00:30:10,333
â™ª

817
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,767
(laughing)

818
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:23,367
â™ª

819
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,967
Eggs!

820
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,533
Eggs?

821
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:25,133
Shhh!

822
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,900
Shhhhhh.

823
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,333
Okay.

824
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:34,233
Bwaa!

825
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,900
What are you doing??

826
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:42,600
Ahem.

827
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,300
You'd probably be
a lot quieter

828
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,967
if you just turned
the light on.

829
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,767
Sorry.

830
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,933
Sorry, Mom.

831
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,200
Mmmmm.
These look amazing.

832
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:55,633
Should we let them cool
before we ice them?

833
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,800
Well, you're
supposed to.

834
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,633
Want some milk
with that?

835
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,333
Yes, please.

836
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:04,600
Wow, it's five-thirty
in the morning.

837
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:09,200
Only fourteen thousand
more hours to stay awake.

838
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:11,633
I blame the airline
completely for this.

839
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:15,533
Yeah, but, you never would have
triple icing Christmas cookies.

840
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:16,800
(laughing)

841
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,033
That's true.

842
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:22,033
Hey, you never told me what
it was they lost of yours.

843
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,133
(sigh)

844
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,567
I spent months recreating
this Victorian music box

845
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,867
my Grandmother
used to have.

846
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,867
All in-laid wood with
a lithograph graph

847
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,367
of Victorian cherubs
on the inside

848
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,867
and I figured out how
to get it to play

849
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,133
the song that was playing
at the school dance

850
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,233
when they first met.

851
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:38,833
Oh, that's
so romantic!

852
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:39,667
Isn't it?

853
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,400
Grandpa will deny
it up and down,

854
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,900
but he's a pretty
romantic guy.

855
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,167
Just mention
8:42 to him.

856
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,867
8:42?
What's that?

857
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,667
The moment he first
saw my Grandmother.

858
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,233
He saw her then took out his
watch to see what time it was

859
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:55,700
because he knew his life would
never be the same after that.

860
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,867
Oh, I think
I'm going to cry!

861
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,300
(laughing)

862
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,767
Whenever he talks about it
he always says

863
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,067
"I took one look
at her and I knew

864
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,300
I would love her forever."

865
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,400
That's so beautiful.

866
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,400
Mmm!

867
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,667
Dropped one.

868
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,867
I can't wait to meet
your Grandfather.

869
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,700
You've got a little
icing right --

870
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:20,467
Right here?

871
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,467
On the other side.

872
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,367
Where?

873
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,067
I've got it all over
my face, right?

874
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,233
(laughing)

875
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:27,267
I got it.

876
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:30,033
Right...there.

877
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,467
There we go.

878
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,500
So what else do you do,

879
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:43,733
besides building
Victorian music boxes?

880
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:46,300
I crochet for a living.

881
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,500
I don't believe you!

882
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:48,500
(laughing)

883
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,067
I make furniture.

884
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,300
Really?

885
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,300
Mm-hmm.

886
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,567
See this table?

887
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Yeah.

888
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,400
I built it.

889
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,933
You built this??

890
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:01,000
Actually I had to,

891
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,367
after I accidently set
the old one on fire.

892
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,767
(laughing)

893
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,033
But it turned out I love
working with wood

894
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,633
and I was good at it.

895
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,133
Good thing I got my Masters
degree in finance, huh?

896
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,133
Masters?

897
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,633
Yeah.
Wasn't my thing.

898
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,133
I hate wearing suits
and that dreaded thing

899
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,933
of actually having
to talk to people.

900
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,767
(laughing)

901
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,267
Well, you're very charming.
I'm sure you did great.

902
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Thanks.

903
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,933
But I think the last
thing this world needs

904
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,967
is more bankers and
real estate agents.

905
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,767
That's funny.

906
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,567
If only Will
could hear you now.

907
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,233
I think he'd agree
with me.

908
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:39,667
Yeah, probably would--
less competition.

909
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,667
My Grandfather --
he built things.

910
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,233
Houses,
for forty years.

911
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,200
I think the only time
he wore a tux'

912
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:50,967
was when he was
at his wedding

913
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,700
and that was because
of my Grandmother.

914
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:53,500
Hmmm.

915
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,767
You should see
them together.

916
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,633
Like Bogart and Bacall
or Tracy and Hepburn.

917
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,233
I can't wait.

918
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,200
Look at this one.

919
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,700
Oh! They look
so happy together.

920
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:12,200
I know! My Grandma
was such a fox.

921
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:13,833
She really was.

922
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:16,333
This is my favorite
one right here.

923
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:17,333
Mmmmmm!

924
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:18,400
Isn't she beautiful?

925
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,900
She's gorgeous.

926
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:22,133
Wow!

927
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:24,400
Was different
then, hey?

928
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:25,600
You have her smile.

929
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:26,200
Do I?

930
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:26,867
Mmhmm.

931
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:45,033
â™ª

932
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:47,233
Hey.

933
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:48,767
Good morning.

934
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,900
Morning.

935
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,633
Wait,
we were sleeping.

936
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:00,100
We're okay,
we survived.

937
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,733
We weren't
supposed to.

938
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,433
(laughing)

939
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:06,767
Oh--

940
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,900
Looks like we just about made
it through the toddler years.

941
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:10,667
Yeah.

942
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,867
What are you doing?

943
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:13,933
Um --

944
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:16,067
We're just looking
over some pictures.

945
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,467
Just considering
breakfast.

946
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,067
No you were
sleeping, weren't you?

947
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,667
Nope.

948
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,833
No.

949
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:23,067
I have half a mind to
smack you up side the head!

950
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,833
Brain injury, Mom!

951
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:25,400
Doctor says you
can't slap me!

952
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,433
Come here, let me see.
Look at me.

953
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:28,667
All right.

954
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,900
How are you,
honey?

955
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:32,133
I think I'm okay.
I'm just tired.

956
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,900
I know, I know
but no sleeping yet!

957
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,900
Matt get up and
clean up this mess

958
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:38,067
before Grandpa
gets here.

959
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,633
Okay.

960
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:39,833
Now Matt!

961
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,033
Okay, okay!

962
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:43,100
Ohhhhh.
You're so busted.

963
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:45,933
Follow the finger.
Follow the finger.

964
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:47,300
Got it...
there we go.

965
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,367
Don't drop the needles!

966
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,267
Oh, it's okay!

967
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,100
Any one here want
a Christmas tree?

968
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:53,300
Very expensive!

969
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:54,100
Oh!

970
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,267
Let me help you.

971
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,500
It's beautiful!

972
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:59,700
Oh, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

973
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:01,167
Go sit!
You're injured.

974
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,300
We got this.

975
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,500
There we are.

976
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:04,933
Easy!

977
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:05,967
That's it.

978
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,767
Beautiful!

979
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,300
Oh, look at that.

980
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,667
That's
a beauty, huh?

981
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:12,633
You must be Alice.

982
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:13,600
Hi!

983
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,867
Joe told me all about
your secret engagement.

984
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,533
I have to say,
guys --

985
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,367
our Billy boy has
very good taste.

986
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,133
Awwww, thank you.

987
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:25,533
They were giving these out
at the Christmas tree farm --

988
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:26,533
Thanks, Grandpa.

989
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:27,967
And for this
special occasion,

990
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,200
welcoming our new
addition to the family.

991
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,733
(laughing)

992
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:35,733
Alice -- the
red-nosed fiancÃ©e.

993
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,133
(laughing)

994
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,167
(clapping)

995
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,600
It goes
with your hair!

996
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,833
Thanks.

997
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,767
Come on, Joe.

998
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,567
I can't hold
this up all day.

999
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,833
Well, stop wobbling
the thing

1000
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:51,367
and maybe I'll be able
to get the screws in!

1001
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,567
All right.

1002
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
All right, they're in;
you can let go.

1003
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:56,167
Ohhh!

1004
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,567
All right, decorators,
start your engines!

1005
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,767
Beautiful tree.

1006
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,533
Huh? Yeah.

1007
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:02,167
I think it's
a perfect one.

1008
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,400
The tree is... okay.

1009
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:07,567
Uh oh, look out!
We're in trouble.

1010
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,000
Our Matty only
likes those pathetic,

1011
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,167
Charlie Brown trees.

1012
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,767
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't knock it,

1013
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,167
Alice happens
to like them too.

1014
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,400
Is that so?

1015
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,700
Yeah, I've always
been a sucker

1016
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:21,200
for the loser on the
Christmas tree lot.

1017
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:24,200
I mean, I feel like if you
have a tree as beautiful

1018
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:26,200
as that one you're
already half way there.

1019
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:29,867
But if you can take a tree
that's dropping its needles

1020
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,933
and missing half its branches
and growing sideways

1021
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:36,200
and all of that --
Then by the time

1022
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:38,333
you decorate it,
and it looks so beautiful;

1023
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:40,400
it's sort of
a Christmas miracle.

1024
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:44,067
You know, I think Matt said
the same thing last year.

1025
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,033
Did you?

1026
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:46,067
Yeah...

1027
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,233
Every ornament has a story
and Grandpa's going

1028
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,067
to tell them all,
right Grandpa?

1029
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,500
Oh!
Who's that little guy?

1030
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:56,933
This is "Bo",
my first dog.

1031
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,967
I got this
when I was a boy.

1032
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,133
"Bo" always gets a
prime spot on the tree,

1033
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,233
right Grandpa?

1034
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:05,233
That's a good
spot right there.

1035
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:06,067
Excellent.

1036
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,133
Dad -- this one.

1037
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:17,200
My Debra gave me this
at a Christmas formal.

1038
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,067
That's where they met.

1039
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,000
That's right.

1040
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,300
There was a dinner
before the dance...

1041
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,167
and there she was.

1042
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,000
I took one look
at her

1043
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:30,100
and I knew I would
love her forever.

1044
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,100
You knew all that
from just one look?

1045
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,833
It worked for me,
kiddo.

1046
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,333
She had come
with another fella.

1047
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:39,867
He got
food poisoning--

1048
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,867
Oh, Dad!

1049
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,100
--and he had to leave
so I got to dance

1050
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:44,100
with her all night.

1051
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:45,200
You smoothie!

1052
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:48,100
If it hadn't been
for a little bad egg salad,

1053
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,667
I may never
have met her.

1054
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,533
It was fate!

1055
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:52,500
(laughing)

1056
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:53,467
What?

1057
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,033
You tell that story
every year, Grandpa,

1058
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:56,533
when you put up
that ornament.

1059
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,500
Get outta here!

1060
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:58,300
You do.

1061
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,133
Yeah.

1062
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:02,700
Well, it's true.
It was fate.

1063
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:03,967
And it found me at--

1064
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,133
EIGHT FORTY-TWO!

1065
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:07,133
Hey!

1066
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,300
You too?

1067
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,200
Matt told me the
story last night;

1068
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,067
I thought it
was so beautiful.

1069
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:16,200
Read what's
written on the star.

1070
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:22,967
"Eternity is where
true love exists."

1071
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,267
She had a way
with words, didn't she?

1072
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,833
You know what
I think we need?

1073
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:30,833
I think we need some of Alice
and Matt's Christmas cookies.

1074
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:31,367
Hey!

1075
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,200
Good idea!

1076
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:32,933
Be right back!

1077
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:33,833
Oh!

1078
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:35,733
I'm sorry they're
not macrobiotic.

1079
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:38,433
Wait... is that
a bad thing?

1080
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:41,733
Will told me
you were macrobiotic.

1081
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:43,733
I don't even
know what that is.

1082
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:44,633
Neither do I.

1083
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,333
Billy doesn't know
what that means.

1084
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,167
Well, why would
Billy say that?!

1085
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,167
I don't know.

1086
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,267
He's probably just
messing with ya.

1087
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,733
Is that funny?

1088
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:54,900
I don't get it.

1089
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,033
Well, we'll ask him
when he gets here.

1090
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:00,800
She's not
macrobiotic?

1091
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:08,767
Voicemail:
Hey, it's Alice.

1092
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,400
I'm either away
from my phone

1093
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:12,967
or I lost reception
so leave a message.

1094
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,967
Alice, I know you're probably
furious with me but,

1095
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,533
listen, I will be there
first thing in the morning

1096
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:21,567
with some very, very good news
that I think will make you

1097
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,767
totally forgive me
for being so late.

1098
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,700
Tell Mother to buy some
champagne and put it on ice

1099
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:29,400
because we are gonna
want to celebrate.

1100
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:31,267
All right, I'll talk
to you soon.

1101
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,233
Message: Hello, Mr. Mitchum.
This is Doctor Stark.

1102
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,267
I am calling from
Beresford County hospital

1103
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,800
on behalf
of Alice Chapman.

1104
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,467
There's been
an accident --

1105
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:46,700
Driver, change of plans -
take me to the airport.

1106
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:49,600
Yes!

1107
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,233
He's on an airplane!
He's coming!

1108
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:53,067
What? You actually
talked to him?

1109
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,400
No, he sent me
twelve emails though.

1110
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:56,600
Twelve?
Oh, my God.

1111
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:57,733
He's worried sick.

1112
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't understand why
he doesn't just call me here.

1113
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:01,867
Because that's the
logical thing to do

1114
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,900
and when a man
is in love -

1115
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:05,400
he thinks only
with his heart!

1116
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:06,400
(laughing)

1117
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:08,967
This is so cute; look
at the two of them!

1118
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,367
Oh, I know,
I know...

1119
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,033
Okay, let me guess.
This...

1120
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:13,333
This one is Will,
right?

1121
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:14,433
Wrong!
No, no, no.

1122
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:15,167
No?

1123
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,033
That is Billy,
that is Matt.

1124
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:18,367
I would never
have guessed.

1125
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,533
I know.

1126
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:21,833
Look it; they were so
close when they were young.

1127
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:22,633
(laughing)

1128
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:23,833
Their little faces!

1129
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:24,867
I know!

1130
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,433
Did they have a falling
out or something?

1131
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:28,633
What?

1132
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:30,833
The weird thing is he never
mentioned he had a brother.

1133
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:33,167
Oh, no, no, they just
grew up, that's all.

1134
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,933
They both went down
very different paths

1135
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:37,200
but they're still really
close in their own way.

1136
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,467
Aren't you?
Yes, you are!

1137
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,467
(laughing)

1138
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,467
â™ª

1139
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,467
Your parents have so many
beautiful antiques;

1140
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,067
I'd love for you guys
to come see my store.

1141
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,867
I'm definitely coming by the
next time I'm in the city.

1142
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,567
I think you'll
really love it.

1143
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,867
It was
my father's store.

1144
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,867
I worked there as a
teenager; I loved it.

1145
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,433
After he passed away my Mom
tried running it for a while

1146
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:05,333
but it wasn't really her
thing so she gave it to me.

1147
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:06,533
That's quite a gift.

1148
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:07,867
I know.

1149
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,233
It really is,
but it's a lot harder

1150
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,333
than I thought
it would be.

1151
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,333
I mean, I'm
barely holding on.

1152
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,100
I thought it was an
established business?

1153
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:19,233
Well, it is.

1154
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:21,900
But it's a lot more than
just running the store;

1155
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:25,600
it's buying merchandise
and going to auctions

1156
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:28,267
and checking out
estate sales.

1157
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:31,367
When my father was around
I stayed at the store

1158
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,100
while he did all that
but now it's just me.

1159
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:36,400
Well, can't you hire
somebody to help?

1160
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:38,733
No, I can't afford it.

1161
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,733
I worked
for pocket change.

1162
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,767
Regular employees
won't do that.

1163
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:45,067
(sighs)

1164
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,933
I just keep praying something
will happen to change things.

1165
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:48,300
Something will happen.

1166
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:49,433
CRASH!

1167
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,133
OH NO!

1168
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,367
Don't move.

1169
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,533
There's shards
everywhere.

1170
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,033
Wait, I'll go get
a broom.

1171
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:55,033
No, I'll get it.

1172
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:56,533
Let's get you
to higher ground.

1173
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:57,167
What??

1174
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,333
I'll take care of it.

1175
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,833
What happened?

1176
00:43:01,033 --> 00:43:02,733
What are you doing??

1177
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:04,533
Alice broke your
favorite dish.

1178
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:05,933
That was your
favorite dish?!

1179
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:06,967
I'm so sorry!

1180
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,967
It was totally her favorite
and you broke it!

1181
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,800
He's just messing
with you.

1182
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,233
That's not nice.

1183
00:43:12,267 --> 00:43:14,067
Matt, help me
clean this up.

1184
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,767
It's almost time to play
Christmas messages.

1185
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,167
You're going
to play, right?

1186
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,967
I'll just stay here.
You guys play.

1187
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,467
I'm gonna stay
and clean up.

1188
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,267
No! No, no, no!
You have to.

1189
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:27,767
It's Christmas; a time when
families love and give

1190
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,567
and share with each other.
And you are part of that.

1191
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,967
â™ª

1192
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,500
I've never heard
of this game.

1193
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,100
That's because Mom
made it up.

1194
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,967
I did not make it
up, smarty-pants,

1195
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,433
my Grandfather did and
then he passed it down to me

1196
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:46,600
and then I passed it
down to you

1197
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:47,667
and then to you.

1198
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,533
Dad, would you
take that for me?

1199
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:52,667
Now, how this goes is
everybody writes out

1200
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,600
something nice about
everybody in the room.

1201
00:43:57,633 --> 00:44:01,367
And then that person
has to try and figure out

1202
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,167
who said what
about whom.

1203
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,333
That sounds like fun.

1204
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:06,200
Yeah, it is.

1205
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:07,600
Here we go.

1206
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:22,533
â™ª

1207
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:23,633
There we go--

1208
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:24,500
Okay.

1209
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:26,833
Are we ready?

1210
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:28,133
Dad!
You go first!

1211
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:29,133
All right.

1212
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,300
Pass me the cup.

1213
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:30,900
This one?

1214
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:31,833
That one, yeah--

1215
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:34,200
"Is a trouble maker."

1216
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:34,900
(laughing)

1217
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:36,233
...and damn proud
of it!

1218
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:37,633
(laughter)

1219
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:38,567
Nailed that one!

1220
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,633
Such a troublemaker.

1221
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,467
(laughter)

1222
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,900
"Taught me
everything I know."

1223
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:47,067
...darn right I did - and
she turned out beautifully!

1224
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,133
Sweetheart.

1225
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,933
"Knows the best stories."

1226
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:56,667
...you got it
for yourself!

1227
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,733
(laughing)
That's right!

1228
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,600
And last but not...

1229
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,067
"is young at heart."

1230
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,100
It's true.

1231
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:10,500
Okay, okay, okay -
who's next?

1232
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:11,667
Alice - you.

1233
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,067
Really? Okay.

1234
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,067
We're all family.

1235
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,100
All right.

1236
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,967
"Loves Christmas traditions
and has a Debra spirit."

1237
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:25,600
It's true and she is.

1238
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:26,900
Thank you.

1239
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,300
Aww, that's
really sweet.

1240
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:36,700
"Appreciates the
value of old treasures."

1241
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,933
Well, it's true.

1242
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:38,600
Yeah.

1243
00:45:38,633 --> 00:45:39,700
(laughter)

1244
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:40,700
Thank you.

1245
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:48,533
â™ª

1246
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:50,367
"Is kind of amazing."

1247
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,567
â™ª

1248
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,400
(doorbell)

1249
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:58,567
Oh!
That must be Billy!

1250
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,600
Ha ha!

1251
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:02,200
Oh, Billy!
Welcome home!

1252
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:05,933
Will Mitchum!

1253
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,167
Ahhhhh!

1254
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:09,933
Who are you?

1255
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,167
You're not Will!

1256
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:12,767
Who's Will?

1257
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:13,933
Alice, what--

1258
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:15,733
My fiancÃ©.

1259
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:16,733
What's going
on here?

1260
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:18,733
Where is he?
Will?

1261
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:19,733
What's going on?

1262
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:20,933
This is not funny.

1263
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:22,233
Who are you?

1264
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:24,167
I'm Billy Mitchum.

1265
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,033
So you're not
engaged to Billy?

1266
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,167
This is--

1267
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,367
I've made a
really big mistake.

1268
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,067
I'm at the wrong house.
I don't know this person.

1269
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:39,767
You're Will?
You're Billy?

1270
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,767
I'm Billy, I've never
been called "Will".

1271
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,767
But my fiancÃ©
is Will Mitchum.

1272
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,000
I-I don't know...

1273
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,000
Uh, well.

1274
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:49,600
They are the same
name; Will, Billy.

1275
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:51,633
You can see how they
could get confused.

1276
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,733
Oh, what have
I done?

1277
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:58,167
This--

1278
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,833
This is-- I've made
a really big mistake.

1279
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:05,367
That's okay.

1280
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,900
Uhhhh...
I have to go.

1281
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:08,633
No, no!

1282
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:10,800
Alice, what
are you doing?

1283
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:13,667
I, well, I can't
stay here if I don't...

1284
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,233
Alice, wait, wait--

1285
00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:17,533
Alice, don't be silly.

1286
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:19,367
We love having you here.

1287
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,167
Grandpa's right;
you fit right in.

1288
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,700
It's a pleasure.

1289
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:25,233
Uh...

1290
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:30,233
Does anyone have a phone
that I could use?

1291
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,267
Sure, honey,
pass me that.

1292
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,433
Alice, what are
you going to do?

1293
00:47:37,467 --> 00:47:38,767
I don't know.

1294
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,433
(crying)
I'm really sorry.

1295
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:45,367
Alice--

1296
00:47:48,467 --> 00:47:49,600
This is weird.

1297
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
Yeah.

1298
00:47:55,067 --> 00:47:56,033
Okay.

1299
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:57,367
I'll see you soon.

1300
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,333
Hey.

1301
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:03,233
Hi.

1302
00:48:04,733 --> 00:48:07,467
Hot chocolate always makes
everything a little better.

1303
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,567
Thank you.

1304
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,100
Well--

1305
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,800
He'll be here
in a few minutes.

1306
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:16,967
Your Will?

1307
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,600
â™ª

1308
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:23,633
I am so embarrassed.

1309
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,600
Don't be.

1310
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,467
How could I have made
such a colossal mistake?

1311
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:33,733
It's one for the books,
that's for sure.

1312
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:35,900
(laughing)

1313
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:37,433
The whole family's
sorry you're not

1314
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:39,300
gonna spend Christmas
with us.

1315
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,867
Especially me.

1316
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:44,167
I'm sorry too.

1317
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:48,100
I don't suppose there's
some way you could,

1318
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,900
I don't know, come
visit us on Christmas

1319
00:48:50,933 --> 00:48:53,900
or maybe I could
go to your place?

1320
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:55,300
Well, I don't know.

1321
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,300
It's probably not
a very good idea.

1322
00:48:57,933 --> 00:48:58,933
No.

1323
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,933
No, I guess
you're right.

1324
00:49:06,867 --> 00:49:08,500
I meant what
I wrote you.

1325
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,533
Oh, the note game.

1326
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:16,767
It was kind
of a letter.

1327
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:25,333
â™ª

1328
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:26,267
Oh!

1329
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,333
There's Will!

1330
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:28,467
Will!

1331
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:31,767
Hey!

1332
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,733
Hi--

1333
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,267
Are you okay?

1334
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,533
Yeah, I'm okay.

1335
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,500
My parents had no
idea where you were,

1336
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:39,567
we were worried sick,

1337
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,167
I left you, like,
fifteen messages.

1338
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,667
Why didn't you
call me back?

1339
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,933
I left you a message!

1340
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:45,700
I told you my
phone got ruined,

1341
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:46,967
I didn't get
the messages!

1342
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,800
Matt spilled coffee
on it. Well --

1343
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:49,467
Who's Matt?

1344
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
Oh!

1345
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:53,967
He's this great guy who offered
me a ride into Beresford.

1346
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,800
He overheard me say that
I was the future Mrs. Mitchum

1347
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,367
- his last name
is Mitchum!

1348
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,367
He has a brother
named Billy, so...

1349
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,133
(laughing)

1350
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:02,833
You went
to the wrong house!

1351
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:05,567
Well, Mitchum's a
really common name.

1352
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,400
And so is William
or Will, or Billy.

1353
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:11,600
I thought that I was
at your family's house.

1354
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,467
Could you imagine me growing
up in a place like this?

1355
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:15,867
Wait, Alice!

1356
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,100
Oh!

1357
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:20,333
No one leaves
without a parting gift!

1358
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,867
You're so sweet!
Thank you.

1359
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,333
Penny, Joe, Grandpa,

1360
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:27,000
this is my... Will.

1361
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:28,867
Nice to meet you,
Will.

1362
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,733
Hi.

1363
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:31,200
Yeah.
You're a lucky man.

1364
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:32,400
Oh, well,
thank you.

1365
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:35,200
Yeah. It's nice
to meet you folks too.

1366
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:38,200
I apologize if there's
been any inconvenience

1367
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:39,400
Alice has caused you.

1368
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:41,367
Inconvenience?!
Are you kidding?

1369
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,067
She's been an absolute joy
to have around!

1370
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,933
Look, I uh...

1371
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:48,100
Well, I think--

1372
00:50:49,067 --> 00:50:50,767
Well, I think
this should cover

1373
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,067
any expenses you
might have incurred.

1374
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:53,867
Oh, no, no!

1375
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,233
We loved
having Alice here.

1376
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:57,633
Huh. Okay.

1377
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:59,867
Alice, there are shortbreads
and pecans in there.

1378
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,200
Just for the rest of the
holidays, you know?

1379
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:05,200
Now don't eat them all in
the car on the way home!

1380
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:06,267
Okay, we won't!

1381
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,233
Thank you.

1382
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:09,433
Um, thank you
so much!

1383
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,367
Oh sweetie,
thank you, darling.

1384
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,467
And letting me decorate
the Christmas tree

1385
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,900
and including me
in the notes game.

1386
00:51:17,933 --> 00:51:18,967
Thank you.

1387
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,400
Alice--

1388
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:23,267
Come on, we really
got to get going.

1389
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,300
Okay--

1390
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,300
Um--

1391
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,100
Hang on!

1392
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:31,533
Um, I'll be right back.
I forgot something!

1393
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,933
Lovely home.

1394
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:38,833
Hey.

1395
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:40,933
What'd you forget?

1396
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:45,567
This.

1397
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:48,133
Merry Christmas.

1398
00:51:48,167 --> 00:52:08,267
â™ª

1399
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:34,533
(car doors closing)

1400
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:35,767
(car alarm setting)

1401
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:39,867
Okay...

1402
00:52:43,567 --> 00:52:44,400
Oh...

1403
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:48,567
This is where
it all began.

1404
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:50,000
Wow.

1405
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:50,867
Mmmm--

1406
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:54,000
She's around
here somewhere.

1407
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:54,867
Uh...

1408
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,900
Mother?

1409
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:01,933
Oh, Mother?

1410
00:53:03,933 --> 00:53:05,067
Mother?

1411
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,667
Please don't
touch that.

1412
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,533
Oh.

1413
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,900
Sorry.

1414
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,033
Mother.

1415
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:18,767
Will, my love.

1416
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,733
I have missed
you terribly.

1417
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,200
Alice, this is my
Mother, Judith.

1418
00:53:25,233 --> 00:53:28,367
Mother, this is
Alice - my fiancÃ©e.

1419
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:28,800
Oh...

1420
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,033
Oh!

1421
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,600
Sorry I meant
to tell you

1422
00:53:31,633 --> 00:53:33,067
that Mother's cleaning
her chakras.

1423
00:53:33,467 --> 00:53:34,467
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1424
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,800
Did I track
something in?

1425
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:37,700
Oh, no, Alice.

1426
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:41,033
Chakras are the spiritual
portals on our body

1427
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:44,233
which allow us to tap into
the wellspring of prana;

1428
00:53:44,267 --> 00:53:46,200
the universal life force.

1429
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:48,567
And they need cleaning
once in a while?

1430
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,800
Mmm-hmm.

1431
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:50,700
Okay.

1432
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:52,200
Too much contact
with other peoples'

1433
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:54,433
auras can cause
them to, um...

1434
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:55,633
Clog up?

1435
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,133
Close down.

1436
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:59,067
Mother's studying
under a guru.

1437
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,133
Oh, wow.

1438
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:02,500
I've never even
met a guru.

1439
00:54:02,533 --> 00:54:04,567
Oh, Alice.

1440
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,467
Open your mind to the
universal consciousness

1441
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,233
and a teacher
will be provided.

1442
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:10,967
Okay.
That's handy.

1443
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,967
Yes.

1444
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,333
Let's leave metaphysics
aside for the moment.

1445
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:18,433
We're just very happy
that you are here

1446
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:19,433
and that you're safe.

1447
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:20,967
We were awfully
worried about you.

1448
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,833
Come!

1449
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:23,233
Let's have a drink
to celebrate.

1450
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:24,067
Oh, a drink...

1451
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,833
Yeah.

1452
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:26,367
Yeah, that
sounds good.

1453
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:30,867
I was absolutely amazed when
Will told me what happened.

1454
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,000
I mean, how does one end up
at the wrong house?

1455
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,833
(blender whirring)

1456
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:39,867
But then I remembered:
there are no accidents.

1457
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,767
Everything happens
for a reason.

1458
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,667
Well, it's a funny
story actually.

1459
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,000
I, um, I had my phone
ruined at the airport

1460
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:50,467
because somebody accidentally
spilled coffee on it

1461
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,033
and then I went to check
what the address was

1462
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:56,967
of the house I was supposed
to go to and I, um, --

1463
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,033
Is this one of those
energy smoothies?

1464
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:00,367
Hmm?

1465
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,533
Oh, no.

1466
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:05,400
It removes all the, um,
clogged, undigestive matter

1467
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:08,200
and the bacteria that gets
into your intestines

1468
00:55:08,233 --> 00:55:10,500
and clogs them up.

1469
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:12,700
It's just like
your chakras, huh?

1470
00:55:12,733 --> 00:55:14,400
No, not really.

1471
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:19,900
Happy holidays to the
newest member of our family;

1472
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:21,567
welcome, Alice.

1473
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,500
Thank you so much.

1474
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:24,767
Cheers.

1475
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:29,767
It's my own recipe.

1476
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:33,867
It's a blend
of yeast extract,

1477
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,200
root vegetables,
and fermented bran.

1478
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,533
That's... that's very...
macro-delicious.

1479
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,533
Oh, thank you
so much!

1480
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:45,967
I'm so glad you like it.
There's plenty more.

1481
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:47,633
Good.

1482
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:49,733
Who left the suitcase right in
front of the front door?!

1483
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:50,733
We're in here, Roy!

1484
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:51,567
Yes, yes, yes.

1485
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,600
Ugh.

1486
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,333
Hey!
Will, my boy!

1487
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:57,600
Dad.
Good to see you.

1488
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:58,900
Good to see you too.

1489
00:55:58,933 --> 00:56:01,133
Dad.
This is Alice.

1490
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:04,767
Hello, Mr. Mitchum.
It is so nice to meet you.

1491
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,533
Mmmmm!

1492
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:07,367
Well, please,
call me Roy.

1493
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,200
Roy.

1494
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:08,767
(laughing)

1495
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,567
Here you go.

1496
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,367
Oh--

1497
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,400
One more.

1498
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:12,267
Oh.

1499
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,767
(cell phone ringing)

1500
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,200
Oh, uh,
is that mine?

1501
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:16,767
Mine.

1502
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,200
Oh.

1503
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:17,967
That's you.

1504
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,767
Hmm?

1505
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,800
It's mine?

1506
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:23,200
Oh yup,
here we go.

1507
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:24,967
Uh, Roy Mitchum?

1508
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,567
It's me.

1509
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,300
Yeah, yeah.

1510
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:28,100
No, no - now's
a good time.

1511
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:30,367
Yeah, no, your
timing's great.

1512
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,800
Yeah, no, I'm just putting
the proposal together now.

1513
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:35,600
Like father, like son.

1514
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:36,600
That's incredible.

1515
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:37,633
Mmhmm.

1516
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:40,400
Drink up.

1517
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:41,333
Oh.

1518
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:43,500
I'll have it by
the end of the night.

1519
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,800
Ahhh, my old room.

1520
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:51,233
(chuckling)

1521
00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:53,233
Had a lot of good
memories here.

1522
00:56:53,267 --> 00:56:54,600
Oh, wow!

1523
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:57,067
I never took you for
the sporting type!

1524
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,000
Mmhmm.

1525
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:02,033
Hey, that is my very
first sales award.

1526
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,000
I sold two hundred
pounds of fertilizer

1527
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:07,033
and I wasn't even
a Weebalow yet.

1528
00:57:07,067 --> 00:57:08,433
A weebalow?

1529
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:09,467
Yeah.

1530
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:12,333
It's the highest you
can go as a Cub Scout

1531
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:13,833
before you get
to Boy Scouts.

1532
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:16,700
I was a Bear Cub, which
is one before Weebalow.

1533
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,833
That's so sweet.

1534
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:21,967
You know, I was learning
responsibility

1535
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,600
and accounting from
a very early age.

1536
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:26,167
Maybe if you'd been
a Weebalow

1537
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,033
your store would
be in the black.

1538
00:57:28,467 --> 00:57:31,067
Sometimes in life
you just gotta sell.

1539
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:34,200
I'm going to go
take a shower.

1540
00:57:35,467 --> 00:57:36,500
Alice--

1541
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:38,633
Alice!

1542
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:39,467
SLAM!

1543
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,700
Alice, come on.

1544
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:56,067
â™ª

1545
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,467
(knocking)

1546
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,233
Hey.

1547
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:01,800
Listen, um,

1548
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,567
I think you might have taken
all that the wrong way.

1549
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,367
And what way
would that be?

1550
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:13,233
Alice. I'm a salesman.
I sell - that's what I do.

1551
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:14,667
And I'm good at it.

1552
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,900
Well, I'm great
at it actually.

1553
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:22,567
You are a collector -
a buyer, if you will.

1554
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:27,033
And you hold on to things
just a little too tightly.

1555
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:31,667
Sometimes, you
just gotta let go.

1556
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,700
And you'll get there.

1557
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:36,267
Hey, with my help, you
could be one of the best.

1558
00:58:37,867 --> 00:58:41,267
Now, why don't you let me
make it up to you, hmm?

1559
00:58:41,533 --> 00:58:44,133
Do you want to go
for a walk with me?

1560
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:45,300
A walk?

1561
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:47,367
Tonight?

1562
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,300
Yeah!

1563
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,633
There's this beautiful
tree all lit up

1564
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:51,267
in that park
over there.

1565
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,133
Oh.
Never been.

1566
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:56,367
Isn't this the house
you grew up in?

1567
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,400
Yeah.

1568
00:58:58,967 --> 00:59:00,433
Yeah, look, it's just -

1569
00:59:00,467 --> 00:59:02,667
It's way too cold
tonight, hmm?

1570
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,933
Maybe we'll go tomorrow.

1571
00:59:03,967 --> 00:59:04,900
Yup.

1572
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:09,567
All right.
Good night.

1573
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Yeah...

1574
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:16,633
SLAM!

1575
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:37,600
â™ª

1576
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:47,600
Hey.

1577
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:51,300
Come--
Come--

1578
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:58,800
â™ª

1579
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:00,433
What are you
doing here?

1580
01:00:00,467 --> 01:00:02,767
My sleep schedule's
totally messed up.

1581
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,600
Yeah, staying up
for twenty-four hours

1582
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:06,000
will do that to you.

1583
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:09,000
I know, I feel like I'm on
Tokyo time, or something.

1584
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:10,100
Yeah.

1585
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:11,500
How did you find me?

1586
01:00:11,533 --> 01:00:12,600
I followed you.

1587
01:00:12,633 --> 01:00:13,300
You did?

1588
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,333
Yeah.

1589
01:00:15,233 --> 01:00:16,233
No.

1590
01:00:16,567 --> 01:00:18,533
There's only three
Mitchum's in this town.

1591
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:20,300
The other two Mitchum's
are on vacation.

1592
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:21,400
(laughing)

1593
01:00:21,433 --> 01:00:22,867
At least that's what
the police officer told me

1594
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,133
when he thought I was
breaking into their house.

1595
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:26,300
Oh, no!

1596
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,633
Maybe it was the flashlight
in the window that did it.

1597
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:29,800
I think so.

1598
01:00:30,867 --> 01:00:33,533
You wanna go for
a walk or something?

1599
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:34,567
Yeah.

1600
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:42,367
First time I came here
at night, I was ten.

1601
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:45,033
I snuck out; my parents
would have killed me

1602
01:00:45,067 --> 01:00:46,367
if they ever
found out.

1603
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,100
(laughing)

1604
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:48,133
So, it's a tradition?

1605
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:49,000
Not really.

1606
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:50,633
Just had some
things on my mind.

1607
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:52,667
I wanted to get
out of the house.

1608
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,667
Yeah.
Me too.

1609
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,000
What are these?

1610
01:00:55,033 --> 01:00:56,200
Blocks of snow.

1611
01:00:56,233 --> 01:00:57,367
Covered?

1612
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,700
Tomorrow's the
barefoot Christmas festival.

1613
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:02,633
By then these will be
beautiful snow sculptures.

1614
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:03,300
Wow.

1615
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:03,867
Yeah.

1616
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,067
That's neat.

1617
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:05,867
(gasp)

1618
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,933
That tree
is beautiful!

1619
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,700
Isn't it?

1620
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:10,667
Yeah!

1621
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,667
Wow...

1622
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,767
And peaceful.

1623
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,567
As a kid I could just
look at it for hours;

1624
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,333
get lost in
my own world.

1625
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,100
That's lovely.

1626
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,700
Then I thought, "What'd
make this better but--?"

1627
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:27,800
A bench?

1628
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,300
A place
to watch it from.

1629
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:31,600
The wood's from an old
ship, the bolts are

1630
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:34,100
from a church that
burned down in a fire.

1631
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:35,700
Wait, you built this?

1632
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,233
It's just a bench.

1633
01:01:38,933 --> 01:01:40,933
"Here we will sit
and let the sounds

1634
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:43,533
of music creep
in our ears."

1635
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:44,900
"Soft stillness
and the night,

1636
01:01:44,933 --> 01:01:47,267
become the touches
of sweet harmony."

1637
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,433
(chuckles)

1638
01:01:48,467 --> 01:01:50,400
Merchant of Venice.

1639
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:51,900
The lady knows
her Shakespeare.

1640
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:54,200
Aw, this isn't
just a bench.

1641
01:01:54,233 --> 01:01:55,433
Sit, please.

1642
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,133
You know, I would love
to have these in my store.

1643
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:03,733
I'm sure
I could sell these.

1644
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:04,400
Yeah?

1645
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,933
Yeah!
Absolutely.

1646
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:07,967
Good eye.

1647
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,733
This bench -
this, I got right.

1648
01:02:11,767 --> 01:02:14,133
I'd say you get
a lot right.

1649
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,800
I mean, you're
doing what you love;

1650
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,400
you're good at it.
It's working for you.

1651
01:02:19,433 --> 01:02:21,033
You're kinda
living the dream.

1652
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:22,433
Huh.

1653
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,867
Do I really
make you laugh?

1654
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,600
Yeah.
Absolutely.

1655
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:35,167
I once ran for student
council just so I could

1656
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,167
put up signs:
"They will wear hair nets"

1657
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,967
for the cafeteria
staff 'cause, like,

1658
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,767
who wants a hair
in their tater-tots?

1659
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,600
It's just gross.

1660
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:45,033
(laughing)

1661
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:48,767
Well, personal hygiene
is very important.

1662
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,167
It really is.

1663
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:55,433
So I'm amazing, huh?

1664
01:02:55,467 --> 01:02:56,567
Yes.

1665
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,100
Especially after
I spilt coffee on you,

1666
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:01,467
wrecked your blouse -
not to mention your phone,

1667
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,267
almost killed you
in a car accident.

1668
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,200
(laughing)

1669
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:06,533
Amazing doesn't even
begin to sum it up.

1670
01:03:09,733 --> 01:03:12,800
Hey, you know what came
into my store the other day?

1671
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,967
A replica of the Burn
Castle Christmas clock.

1672
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,333
Are you serious?

1673
01:03:17,367 --> 01:03:18,767
You're familiar
with it?

1674
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:21,533
Of course.

1675
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,633
Uh, the clock maker who fell
in love with a woman

1676
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,133
who was already
promised to another.

1677
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:28,800
And everyone was
frozen in time.

1678
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,800
Yeah, that's
the one.

1679
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:31,833
Yeah...

1680
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:37,433
Listen, uh, I'm probably going
to regret saying this but,

1681
01:03:37,467 --> 01:03:39,867
uh, I'm just going
to say it.

1682
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,333
I think you're about
to make a huge mistake.

1683
01:03:45,633 --> 01:03:48,833
Listen, I think you
are an amazing guy --

1684
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,433
Don't throw that word
around loosely.

1685
01:03:50,467 --> 01:03:52,533
I'm not.
I promise.

1686
01:03:54,067 --> 01:03:57,833
I wish the world were the same
as the clock maker's but --

1687
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,433
Well, why?
Why can't it be?

1688
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:02,867
All I know is that Will
and I have a life together,

1689
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,367
we make a great team --

1690
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,467
You don't believe that.

1691
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,667
You don't know
what I believe.

1692
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:10,733
So much for fate.

1693
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,133
Well, maybe fate's just
something people make up

1694
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,833
to explain the way
things worked out.

1695
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,067
I have to go.

1696
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:27,233
â™ª

1697
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,167
There you are.

1698
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:40,633
Hey, Grandpa.

1699
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:42,600
Couldn't sleep
either, huh?

1700
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:48,867
"Eternity is where
true love exists."

1701
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:52,500
Matty, I want you to do
your grandfather a favour,

1702
01:04:52,533 --> 01:04:59,300
read this over and over then
put it back where it belongs.

1703
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,600
I love you, son.

1704
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:24,433
â™ª

1705
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:48,967
(phone ringing)

1706
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,433
Hello?

1707
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,033
Hello?

1708
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,633
Who is it?

1709
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,167
Oh--
Are you?

1710
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,167
Hello?

1711
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,267
Penny?

1712
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:02,633
Oh, Alice, honey!
Is that you?

1713
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,867
Yeah.
I just wanted to call

1714
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,667
and wish you guys
a Merry Christmas.

1715
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,567
Oh, thank you.
Same to you.

1716
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,567
Oh, I just wish
there was some way

1717
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,200
you could spend it
with us.

1718
01:06:13,233 --> 01:06:14,833
I know, well.

1719
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:16,733
I'll be thinking
of you guys anyway.

1720
01:06:16,767 --> 01:06:17,733
Hey, is Matt there?

1721
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:18,767
Matt?

1722
01:06:21,233 --> 01:06:24,067
Um, you know what, hon'?
I just sent him out

1723
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,000
to do a little last minute
grocery shopping for me.

1724
01:06:27,033 --> 01:06:29,400
You know, Christmas Eve -
I always forget something.

1725
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:32,400
But I can get him to call
you when he gets in?

1726
01:06:32,433 --> 01:06:33,400
No, no.
That's okay.

1727
01:06:33,433 --> 01:06:36,200
Just tell him to have
a Merry Christmas.

1728
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:37,667
(sighs)

1729
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,200
Okay, hon', I will.

1730
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:42,400
And if by any chance you find
yourself a little free time

1731
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:45,300
and you can come by...
the door's always open.

1732
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,867
Okay, thanks.

1733
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:48,633
Bye.

1734
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:49,733
Buh-bye.

1735
01:06:51,267 --> 01:06:53,100
Hey.

1736
01:06:53,933 --> 01:06:57,033
I owe you an
apology for yesterday.

1737
01:06:57,067 --> 01:06:58,867
Oh, no. That's fine,
you were right.

1738
01:06:58,900 --> 01:06:59,633
Just forget it.

1739
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:00,500
Are you sure?

1740
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:01,533
Yup.

1741
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:03,200
You're still my girl?

1742
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:04,400
Of course.

1743
01:07:08,267 --> 01:07:10,367
Hey! Did you get
my email?

1744
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:30,433
â™ª

1745
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,400
Well, it's Christmas
Eve everyone.

1746
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:43,433
That coffee? I could
use some more coffee.

1747
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:45,900
This will give you more
energy than coffee, honey.

1748
01:07:45,933 --> 01:07:47,933
Okay, if you say so.

1749
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:51,100
Will, please tell your Father
that he should give his body

1750
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,867
the nourishment
that it needs.

1751
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,300
Let's play
a Christmas game!

1752
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,233
Oh, Alice.

1753
01:07:56,267 --> 01:07:58,100
I don't think anybody's
in the mood -

1754
01:07:58,133 --> 01:08:00,367
It's Christmas Eve; time
for families to love,

1755
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,033
to share, and to give.

1756
01:08:02,067 --> 01:08:03,400
We're playing.

1757
01:08:04,033 --> 01:08:06,767
There can be a new Mitchum
Christmas Eve tradition.

1758
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,067
Judith, where do you keep
your pens and paper?

1759
01:08:09,967 --> 01:08:11,700
Please get some,
thank you.

1760
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:12,667
Okay.

1761
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,167
Now the other
Mitchums taught me this,

1762
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,533
it's very simple.

1763
01:08:15,567 --> 01:08:18,700
All you need to do is
write down something

1764
01:08:18,733 --> 01:08:21,300
that you like about
everybody around the table.

1765
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,633
Really? Well, I'm just
going to finish this memo.

1766
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,133
And pop it
in their glass.

1767
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,400
And then you have to
guess who said what.

1768
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:28,467
Here you go.

1769
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,500
Okay.

1770
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:31,933
Oh, lovely.
Thank you.

1771
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:37,500
It's really lots
of fun.

1772
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:40,000
It'll put everyone in
the Christmas spirit.

1773
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,100
Thank you.

1774
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,533
Oh, Alice --

1775
01:08:43,567 --> 01:08:44,533
WRITE!

1776
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:45,367
'Kay.

1777
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:51,333
â™ª

1778
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:53,033
Now, you wanna
go first, Roy?

1779
01:08:53,067 --> 01:08:54,700
All right--
Yep--

1780
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:55,767
Now remember,

1781
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,300
the object is you have
to guess who said what.

1782
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,567
"Is very charming."

1783
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,233
Oh, that must be
you Alice.

1784
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:05,067
(laughing)

1785
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,567
Huh? Huh?
Uh huh.

1786
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,167
Okay, I think I like this game
better already.

1787
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,367
Go again.

1788
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,900
"Knows all the loop
holes in the tax code."

1789
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:15,600
(laughing)

1790
01:09:15,633 --> 01:09:17,767
Actually, I wish
I did, there's a couple

1791
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,767
that I missed
over the years.

1792
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,767
You're the best, Dad.

1793
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,167
Thank you, son.
Thank you.

1794
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,200
That's so sweet.

1795
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,467
"Makes good money."

1796
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:27,133
Yeah, well.

1797
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,300
A love letter that gushing
could only come from my wife.

1798
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,867
Well you're only
supposed to write one thing,

1799
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,600
there are other things
that I could have said.

1800
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:38,833
Yeah, but you chose
to write that, so--

1801
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:42,133
Okay, your turn;
go ahead.

1802
01:09:49,433 --> 01:09:50,400
"She's very low
maintenance."

1803
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:52,033
What is that
supposed to mean?

1804
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:53,600
How'd you know
it was me?

1805
01:09:53,633 --> 01:09:54,900
Maintenance is misspelled.

1806
01:09:54,933 --> 01:09:57,200
Oh--
Uh, well.

1807
01:09:57,233 --> 01:09:59,767
You know, I just
feel that, you know,

1808
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,833
you fill in your time
on your own you don't seem

1809
01:10:02,867 --> 01:10:04,267
to need anybody
around so...

1810
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,000
Maybe I haven't
had a choice.

1811
01:10:06,033 --> 01:10:07,300
Uh huh--

1812
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,067
Well, I go in to work everyday
so I can make the good money.

1813
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,267
Okay, my turn.

1814
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:13,433
Let's see what
we have here.

1815
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:19,233
"Is very easy
on the eyes."

1816
01:10:19,267 --> 01:10:20,100
Ah.

1817
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:22,233
Thank you, Roy.

1818
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:25,067
Very welcome.
Ha ha.

1819
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,100
Next.

1820
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:29,633
"Loves my son."

1821
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,200
Yup, that's-
that's true.

1822
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,167
And last,
but not least,

1823
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,400
"is a multi-millionaire?"

1824
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,500
Surprise!

1825
01:10:45,633 --> 01:10:47,133
I don't understand?

1826
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,333
Ahem.

1827
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,600
Excuse me, Dad.

1828
01:10:50,633 --> 01:10:53,500
Mom. Dad. Alice.

1829
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:56,267
Uh, you know, I was going
to wait until Christmas

1830
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,333
but I guess I can give you your
present a little bit early.

1831
01:11:00,367 --> 01:11:03,033
You may noticed I've been
doing a lot of texting

1832
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:04,300
and phone calling.

1833
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:07,667
Well, I haven't exactly
been wasting my time here.

1834
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:12,133
I closed a huge deal
with Grant Lockley.

1835
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,133
Fantastic!

1836
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,133
As you know, he's been
trying to develop

1837
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:17,200
the entire block that
your store is on.

1838
01:11:17,233 --> 01:11:20,300
He's got all the other
property owners on board -

1839
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:22,300
YOU are the only
hold out.

1840
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:23,533
And?

1841
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:28,433
And I used that as leverage to
get him to pay top dollar.

1842
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:30,667
Your little store--

1843
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,233
How does
3.5 million sound?

1844
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:36,167
Holy!
(laughing)

1845
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:36,733
Boom!

1846
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:38,533
Honey,
well done!

1847
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:40,167
Chip off
the old block, son!

1848
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:40,933
Thanks, Dad!

1849
01:11:40,967 --> 01:11:41,933
Congratulations!

1850
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:44,333
I, uh, wow-- I don't
know what to say.

1851
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:46,133
I'm speechless.

1852
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,500
Well, you can say 'yes?'

1853
01:11:48,033 --> 01:11:49,567
I--

1854
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,933
You know, I think I
need some alone time

1855
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:55,167
to-to process this.
It's a really big decision.

1856
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,333
You know, the store's been
in my family for a long time.

1857
01:11:58,367 --> 01:12:01,233
Hey, I totally understand.

1858
01:12:01,267 --> 01:12:03,967
I mean, I-I appreciate and
respect the fact that

1859
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,333
you want to respond
and not react.

1860
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:08,800
That is the responsible
thing to do.

1861
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,367
Hey, just remember:
you and I are going

1862
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,967
to have our own new
family memories, hmm?

1863
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,633
And when the
old store's gone,

1864
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,967
you'll still have
your old memories.

1865
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,233
I'm gonna just
take a walk.

1866
01:12:24,467 --> 01:12:26,200
What's with
the walking?

1867
01:12:26,233 --> 01:12:27,267
She's a city girl.

1868
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:30,700
Hey - I know you'll make
the right decision!

1869
01:12:30,733 --> 01:12:53,733
â™ª

1870
01:13:03,067 --> 01:13:04,200
Alice?

1871
01:13:04,233 --> 01:13:05,233
Grandpa!

1872
01:13:05,267 --> 01:13:07,967
I mean what, what
do I call you now?

1873
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:10,967
"Grandpa" works
just fine.

1874
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,100
What are you
doing here?

1875
01:13:13,133 --> 01:13:14,667
I brought you
something.

1876
01:13:15,633 --> 01:13:17,467
Something Matt
wanted you to have.

1877
01:13:18,467 --> 01:13:19,667
Really?

1878
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,800
I didn't think he would ever
want to speak to me again.

1879
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,867
In time, kiddo,
in time.

1880
01:13:28,067 --> 01:13:29,167
You know what,
Grandpa?

1881
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,633
I really feel like I have
screwed everything up.

1882
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:33,800
Big time.

1883
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:37,933
Why, what
have you done?

1884
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:40,767
I just feel like I met the
most wonderful person

1885
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,133
in the world and
the timing's all wrong.

1886
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,667
I mean, I'm engaged.

1887
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,067
Okay, so what are you
going to do about it?

1888
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,100
Alice!

1889
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:51,667
Is everything okay?

1890
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,233
I'll be in
in a minute.

1891
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:02,933
Alice, I don't know how
the universe works.

1892
01:14:02,967 --> 01:14:05,300
I don't know if we make
our own fates

1893
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:08,500
or if it's written
down somewhere,

1894
01:14:08,533 --> 01:14:10,167
years before
we're born.

1895
01:14:10,767 --> 01:14:12,433
Maybe a little
of both.

1896
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:15,233
I do know one thing
for sure--

1897
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:18,867
life is about timing.

1898
01:14:20,367 --> 01:14:25,300
And timing is everything
in love and loss.

1899
01:14:27,267 --> 01:14:28,467
Thank you.

1900
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:33,867
Thank you for coming.

1901
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,900
Oh, Alice!

1902
01:14:36,933 --> 01:14:37,767
Yeah?

1903
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:40,100
Young at heart.

1904
01:14:40,133 --> 01:14:41,733
(laughing)
Yeah.

1905
01:14:42,133 --> 01:14:43,467
Merry Christmas.

1906
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:48,933
Who was that?

1907
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:51,233
Grandpa Mitchum.
The other Mitchum.

1908
01:14:51,267 --> 01:14:53,233
He was just in
the neighborhood.

1909
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:57,367
Oh, well, uh.
Listen--

1910
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,733
I know you've had a
big day, but before

1911
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:03,433
you give me your answer,
if you'll just come with me.

1912
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:05,933
I have another
gift for you.

1913
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:08,100
I really don't know how
many more surprises

1914
01:15:08,133 --> 01:15:10,267
I can take
from one day.

1915
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,300
I think you're going
to like this one.

1916
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:21,167
It's okay; sit.

1917
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,767
Perfect.

1918
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,100
Now, I know we don't normally
do the present thing

1919
01:15:34,133 --> 01:15:37,567
in my family but I
thought because this

1920
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,600
is a very special holiday that
I would make an exception.

1921
01:15:42,933 --> 01:15:45,433
But before you open it,

1922
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:47,133
I want to apologize.

1923
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,467
That was just
so stupid of me

1924
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:56,200
to present the offer
without any warning.

1925
01:15:56,233 --> 01:16:00,467
I mean, uh, especially
in front of my parents.

1926
01:16:02,367 --> 01:16:04,600
It put a lot of
pressure on you.

1927
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:06,367
And it's perfectly
understandable

1928
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,000
that you'd get upset.

1929
01:16:09,033 --> 01:16:12,667
It's just...
well, you know

1930
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,800
I always want to
take care of you.

1931
01:16:16,633 --> 01:16:17,967
You know that, right?

1932
01:16:21,233 --> 01:16:22,867
Go ahead.
Open it.

1933
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:37,033
What is this?

1934
01:16:37,067 --> 01:16:41,467
It's a lease for store that's
just three blocks away.

1935
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,633
It-It's bigger and has way
more street traffic flow.

1936
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:48,467
And with the money that
you get from the old store

1937
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,233
you can buy lots
of additional stock,

1938
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:52,333
you can hire a
few people to help.

1939
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:55,367
Alice - it would
be a real store.

1940
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,700
A "real" store?

1941
01:16:57,733 --> 01:17:00,967
One that would turn
over a steady profit.

1942
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,800
You could have your own
cafe - with your own theme;

1943
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:07,400
no fifties style
Jane knockoff.

1944
01:17:07,433 --> 01:17:09,767
But, it wouldn't be
my Father's store.

1945
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:14,133
But it would be a darn good
compromise, wouldn't it?

1946
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:19,233
It would definitely
be a compromise.

1947
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,067
Come on.

1948
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:23,867
Be logical.

1949
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:30,567
You can't tempt fate.

1950
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:36,067
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

1951
01:17:37,933 --> 01:17:38,933
Alice--

1952
01:17:43,133 --> 01:17:44,533
Alice, come on.

1953
01:17:44,567 --> 01:18:03,533
â™ª

1954
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:17,567
(clock ticking)

1955
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,333
(crying/sniffling)

1956
01:18:21,367 --> 01:18:31,667
â™ª

1957
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:56,000
(clock ticking/
heart beating)

1958
01:18:56,033 --> 01:18:58,367
Grandpa:
Life is about timing,

1959
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,833
and timing is everything

1960
01:19:00,867 --> 01:19:03,233
in love and loss.

1961
01:19:03,267 --> 01:19:20,200
â™ª

1962
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,433
What's going on
with you, Alice?

1963
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:44,867
I can't...

1964
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,400
I can't do this.

1965
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,667
We don't have to
do the new store.

1966
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,700
I mean--

1967
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:53,767
It was just an idea.

1968
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:56,600
I mean...us.

1969
01:19:57,733 --> 01:19:58,733
Oh...

1970
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,267
I'm sorry.

1971
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,367
I knew this was coming.

1972
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:07,033
You did?

1973
01:20:09,633 --> 01:20:10,500
Yeah.

1974
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:14,633
Ever since you left--

1975
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:19,467
It's like everything's
been off.

1976
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:25,700
You know, uh,
our rhythm.

1977
01:20:25,733 --> 01:20:26,467
Our--

1978
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,600
Timing.

1979
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,067
Yeah.

1980
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,167
â™ª

1981
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:37,133
(clock ticking)

1982
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:38,767
What's that in your hand?

1983
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:40,700
Is that a clock?

1984
01:20:42,233 --> 01:20:45,533
(clock ticking/
heart beating)

1985
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:54,700
â™ª

1986
01:20:54,733 --> 01:20:56,333
I have to go.

1987
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,800
I'm so sorry.

1988
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:18,933
â™ª

1989
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:46,633
Matt?!

1990
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:55,067
â™ª

1991
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,067
Matt?!

1992
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:00,633
â™ª

1993
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:01,733
(laughing)

1994
01:22:02,467 --> 01:22:04,567
(laughing)
Matt!

1995
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:12,800
â™ª

1996
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:14,733
You came
in this snow.

1997
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:16,967
It was raining.

1998
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,067
I know.

1999
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:21,733
I've been ever here since
I gave the clock Grandpa

2000
01:22:21,767 --> 01:22:22,733
to give to you.

2001
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:24,333
You were here?
I was here!

2002
01:22:24,367 --> 01:22:27,200
Well, we must have
just missed each other!

2003
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:30,000
Well, someone once told
me timing is everything.

2004
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:31,833
I've heard that
somewhere before.

2005
01:22:31,867 --> 01:22:34,400
Matt, I've spent so much
time lately pretending

2006
01:22:34,433 --> 01:22:36,900
to be something I'm not
because I thought it was

2007
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:40,400
what I was supposed to be.
I almost forgot who I am.

2008
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:42,600
I mean, I did forget
who I am.

2009
01:22:43,233 --> 01:22:46,200
I'm the girl
who loves family.

2010
01:22:46,233 --> 01:22:49,033
I'm the girl who
loves romance,

2011
01:22:49,067 --> 01:22:52,567
and antiques,
and history.

2012
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:57,367
And most importantly
I'm the girl who loves you,

2013
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,000
Matthew Mitchum.

2014
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:02,000
I love you,
Alice Chapman.

2015
01:23:03,133 --> 01:23:06,100
Merry Christmas!

2016
01:23:06,133 --> 01:23:16,367
â™ª

2017
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,667
(laughing)

2018
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:23,267
You have to tell me how you got
the clock to stop working.

2019
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:24,400
Wait, it stopped working?!

2020
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:25,233
Yeah.

2021
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:26,800
Are you serious,
let me see it!

2022
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:27,800
Yeah.

2023
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:35,900
â™ª

2024
01:23:35,933 --> 01:23:37,967
You know what time
this is, don't you?

2025
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,967
Yeah, it's a couple of
minutes before midnight.

2026
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,267
Eleven fifty-eight?

2027
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,400
Do you remember what happened
at eleven fifty-eight?

2028
01:23:43,433 --> 01:23:45,133
Oh my goodness!

2029
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:48,033
The moment we met,
just a couple of days ago.

2030
01:23:49,433 --> 01:23:53,467
You are my destiny.

2031
01:23:53,500 --> 01:24:04,567
â™ª

2032
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,933
(laughing)

2033
01:24:06,967 --> 01:24:27,000
â™ª

2034
01:24:40,133 --> 01:24:41,100
We have to go,

2035
01:24:41,133 --> 01:24:43,100
your parents are gonna
be here any minute

2036
01:24:43,133 --> 01:24:45,867
and I have to pick up
my Mom at the airport.

2037
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,400
You think they'll
like each other?

2038
01:24:47,433 --> 01:24:48,400
Of course they will--

2039
01:24:48,433 --> 01:24:50,200
Relax, we have
a couple more minutes.

2040
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:52,200
We really don't,
we're going to be late.

2041
01:24:52,233 --> 01:24:52,900
Come here!

2042
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:54,500
Seriously;
we have to go.

2043
01:24:54,533 --> 01:24:56,467
Let me just inventory
this crate.

2044
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,267
Oh, where'd
you get it from?

2045
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,067
Just another estate sale; it
was a blind bid that I won.

2046
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,700
Well, this is cute.

2047
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:06,700
Yeah.

2048
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:08,433
Yeah.

2049
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,167
What is that?

2050
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,000
It's, uh...

2051
01:25:14,033 --> 01:25:15,767
Is that what
I think it is?

2052
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,867
I think so...

2053
01:25:17,533 --> 01:25:20,133
It's a Civil War
era wedding ring.

2054
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,500
Do you have any idea
how much this is worth?

2055
01:25:24,533 --> 01:25:25,567
I do.

2056
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,767
I just don't know
if I could sell it.

2057
01:25:30,033 --> 01:25:33,200
(laughing)

2058
01:25:33,233 --> 01:25:35,800
I love you.

2059
01:25:36,233 --> 01:25:47,200
(clocks chiming)

2060
01:25:47,233 --> 01:25:50,033
(laughing)

2061
01:25:50,067 --> 01:26:01,333
