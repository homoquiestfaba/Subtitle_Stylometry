1
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,377
- STAT COM confirms radio
transmission from Raven team.

2
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:11,071
Gentlemen, insertion
was successful.

3
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,969
Our men are in position.

4
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:14,833
All that's left now
is the fireworks.

5
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:18,078
- You're sure cocky
about all this.

6
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:22,530
- It's all been thought
out, rethought out,

7
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,222
and re-rethought out.

8
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:26,120
We planned for
every contingency.

9
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:29,675
666 decoder is ours.

10
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,509
- Well, not ours really.

11
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,820
At least, not for long.

12
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:40,997
Certainly not for the
price Adeeb is paying us

13
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:42,585
to hand over that little puppy.

14
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,865
- You guys are sure quick
to crack open the champagne.

15
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:52,733
All we've done is get
men into enemy territory.

16
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,321
They haven't even
retrieved the decoder,

17
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:56,150
let alone gotten out.

18
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,222
- They'll get out,
with the decoder.

19
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:02,984
These cats will.

20
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:10,302
- You're putting a lotta
stock in him, Bill.

21
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:11,234
- I didn't make him
Raven team leader

22
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:12,960
because he's got a nice smile.

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,997
- We can't all choose
our subordinates based

24
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:17,930
on whether or not we
want to sleep with them.

25
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,069
- Ah, hell.

26
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,001
You gonna keep
giving me a hard time

27
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,555
about that girl in accounting?

28
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:23,453
Did you see the body on her?

29
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:25,490
- Alright, alright,
enough of that.

30
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,422
We're making decisions
here that will

31
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:28,976
affect the rest of our lives.

32
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:31,599
- In less than one hour the
extraction will be complete,

33
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,153
the decoder will
be on its way here,

34
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,018
and you gentlemen will be
on a road paved with gold.

35
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,784
As soon as we turn the device
over to our Iranian friend.

36
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:06,176
- Let's kick some ass.

37
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,595
- Hey, sergeant.

38
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,714
Raven, right flank!

39
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:16,263
Raven, cover!

40
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:29,310
Deuce, the ammo truck!

41
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,348
- Spike!

42
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:40,770
Move.

43
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,599
- Moving.

44
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:46,604
- Cover.

45
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:50,504
Move!

46
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,367
- Moving.

47
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,846
- Move!
- Moving!

48
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:36,101
- Move.
- Moving!

49
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:37,862
- Move.

50
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:38,690
- Moving.

51
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:42,142
Move.
- Moving.

52
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,986
- Move.
- Moving.

53
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:06,994
- Go!

54
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,799
- Martin, get down!

55
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,320
Steve!

56
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,149
- Oh, god.

57
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:01,704
- Hang in there,
buddy, hang in there!

58
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,189
Come on.

59
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:05,018
Steve.

60
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,388
- Where's the rest of 'em?

61
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:06,217
- They're dead.

62
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,704
- Alright, we got four minutes

63
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,223
to get in there and get that--

64
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:13,914
- Didn't you hear what I
said, you son of a bitch?

65
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:17,573
- I feel worse about it than
you do, now stack 'em up!

66
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:32,415
You know what we
want, where is it?

67
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,284
Where is it?

68
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:41,183
- Bullseye!

69
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,977
I got it.

70
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:48,777
- You got a lotta chutzpah.

71
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:52,573
A lotta chutzpah!

72
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:53,540
Didn't help.

73
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,750
- Soviet 666 codebreaker.

74
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,890
Oh, yeah.

75
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,478
- These two pieces
are codependent.

76
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:01,721
- Ah.

77
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,308
You have one without the other,

78
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,310
it ain't worth a
shit, but together.

79
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,278
Together, shit.

80
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:09,625
This little booger can
infiltrate and seize control

81
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,732
of any computer defense
network known to Man,

82
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,457
including Uncle Sam's,
you know what I'm sayin'?

83
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:16,736
- I know what you're saying.

84
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,082
The mother of all decoders.

85
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,809
50 million bucks.

86
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:23,777
Time to boogie.

87
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,537
We won't need her
anymore, waste her.

88
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:29,990
- We got what we came for.

89
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,133
- I said waste her!

90
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,037
- How'd you know?

91
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:42,969
I didn't.

92
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,182
Move!

93
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,562
- Moving!

94
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:55,913
- Connor!

95
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:58,639
You son of a bitch!

96
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:03,265
You'll make it.

97
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,924
You're with a hell
of a soldier, Mike.

98
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:21,559
Where the hell is that chopper?

99
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,251
- Raven, this is my last job.

100
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,080
I'm out.

101
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:27,565
- What?

102
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:29,084
- I quit, as of now.

103
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:32,466
Glad you didn't
decide that 15 minutes ago.

104
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:34,020
- I'm telling you, this is it.

105
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,124
I'm out of Raven team.

106
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:38,645
- What are you talking about?

107
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:39,577
I recruited you.

108
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,821
You're the best I ever saw.

109
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,753
- I used to be the best, I
can't do this any longer.

110
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:45,341
You saw me hesitate.

111
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,929
I can't kill anymore.

112
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,486
- You know what you need?

113
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:54,488
You need a little vacation.

114
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:55,282
So do I!

115
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,769
We gotta go somewhere, you know?

116
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:00,978
Together.

117
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:04,188
Where they wear nothing
but thong bikinis.

118
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:05,879
You'd look good
in a thong bikini.

119
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:08,813
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

120
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:12,437
I don't see the glory
in killing kids anymore.

121
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:13,680
We're just mercenaries.

122
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,612
We're paid killers.

123
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:16,096
- We're not mercenaries.

124
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,029
Mercenaries get a hell of a
lot more money than we do!

125
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,862
We are paid government
operatives and we're
not paid enough.

126
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,242
You know why they took us?

127
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:26,935
Because we are the best.

128
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,769
We were sent to get this gizmo

129
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,151
because we are indestructible!

130
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:50,786
Where the hell you been?

131
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:51,787
Stealing this chopper.

132
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:52,753
Where are the others?

133
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:54,548
- Taking harp lessons.

134
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:55,825
I'm gonna make
some sand castles!

135
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,195
Whoa!

136
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:23,267
- It's over, Raven!

137
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,199
- What?

138
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:26,822
- I said I'm out, I'm out!

139
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:28,617
- Okay.

140
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:30,999
You're out, I'll go with ya!

141
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,241
- You're coming with me?

142
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:35,624
- Yeah, and we're gonna
take this gizmo, too.

143
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:36,936
- We can't do that!

144
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,076
That has to go back
to the company!

145
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,284
- Are you crazy?

146
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,286
This is worth 50 million bucks!

147
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:43,528
You know what the
company's gonna do?

148
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,392
They're gonna give
it to the Iranians!

149
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:47,187
- You're full of shit, Raven!
- No, you're full of shit!

150
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:50,121
You just come down in
a little white balloon?

151
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,640
What's the matter with you?

152
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,849
You know how much this thing
is worth on the black market?

153
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:57,163
- I said, I'm gettin'
out, not sellin' out!

154
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:58,819
- Alright, you're out!

155
00:15:58,819 --> 00:15:59,648
- I'm out!

156
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:05,102
- Don't make me do this
the hard way, Deuce!

157
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,578
Gah!

158
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,069
Ah!

159
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,745
- Hey.

160
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:38,333
- I didn't mean to wake you.

161
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,093
- What's the matter?

162
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:43,165
- Dreams.

163
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:44,511
- Bad dreams?

164
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:48,929
Wanna talk about it?

165
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,139
- No.

166
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:55,660
- Make friends with
your nightmares, Martin.

167
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:57,800
- I know.

168
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:01,080
- You and your secrets.

169
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,737
I never met anyone
with so many secrets.

170
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:08,328
- I just don't like
talking about my past.

171
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:12,056
- Well, we've been
together almost a year

172
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:15,611
and sometimes I feel like I
don't know anything about you.

173
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:19,960
How about I tell you about
the dream I've been having?

174
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,583
It's the one where.

175
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:28,176
- I kind of like that dream.

176
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,041
Yeah.

177
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:48,368
- Martin, why don't you ever
tell me about your dreams?

178
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:51,130
You know, dreams tell
a lot about a person.

179
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,752
I always hear you saying things.

180
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:55,237
- I talk in my sleep?

181
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:57,481
- Sometimes.

182
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:01,416
You say Raven.

183
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,385
So I guess you're
not gonna tell me?

184
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:07,767
- It's not for you, babe.

185
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:21,470
- Someday I want a
family like that, Martin.

186
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,782
What are you afraid of?

187
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:24,473
- Afraid of the bubble bursting.

188
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,616
Losing the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

189
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:31,929
I don't wanna lose you.

190
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:33,344
- Hey.

191
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:35,588
You're not gonna lose me.

192
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,430
I gotta go.
- Okay.

193
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:13,419
- Hey.

194
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,420
What are ya doin'?

195
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:17,595
- I'm buffalo hunting,
what does it look like?

196
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,148
- Looks like you're watching me.

197
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:21,668
- Sorry, man, I don't know
what you're talking about.

198
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:25,776
- You gotta bait that hook
if you wanna catch something.

199
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:27,605
- I don't remember asking
for a fishing lesson.

200
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:30,229
And what are you, Tarzan,
the neighborhood watch?

201
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,816
- Oh, we just don't
get too many strangers

202
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:33,508
fishing this stretch
of the beach.

203
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,960
You catch much with a Nikon
Reflex and a telephoto lens?

204
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,065
- You know, I don't
have to talk to you.

205
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:41,032
I don't have to tell you squat.

206
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,275
I didn't know I had
to get permission

207
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,484
to do something
on a public beach!

208
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,939
- It's a private beach.

209
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:56,393
I'd like to keep it that way.

210
00:20:58,153 --> 00:20:59,154
- Can I have my ball?

211
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,915
Hey, mister, can I have my ball?

212
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:07,818
- Don't let me catch
you hear again.

213
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:13,410
- Thanks.

214
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,036
- Martin, I'll see you later!

215
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:45,821
- I don't believe it.

216
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,518
Yes, sir.

217
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:53,346
- I want this call traced.

218
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:05,669
I knew you weren't dead.

219
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:09,293
- I'm gonna make this
fast, so don't try

220
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:10,984
to trace it, Billy Gilley.

221
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:13,573
I want the other half of that
decoder and I want it now.

222
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:14,402
- Other half?

223
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,025
We didn't get either piece.

224
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:20,477
I even sent a SEAL team
out to search that lake

225
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:23,480
and all we found was a wrecked
chopper and a dead pilot.

226
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,758
- Okay, that's the
way you want it.

227
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:28,001
I'm gonna take out the Four
Star group and I'm gonna

228
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:30,659
take 'em out one at
a time, you included.

229
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,041
- Raven, listen to
me for a minute.

230
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,836
- You won't know
when I'm gonna start.

231
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,700
When I finish, there
won't be enough left

232
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,218
for the ants to have a picnic.

233
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:41,152
Sweet dreams, asshole.

234
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:45,812
- Katz.

235
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:06,246
- You've been a real
trooper, Marsha.

236
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:08,421
Hanging in here all
these crazy hours.

237
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:11,459
I'm gonna be sorry
to see you go.

238
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,943
- No problem, Senator.

239
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:16,153
The agency explained what was
involved when they called.

240
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:18,811
Although, I don't think I
could do this full time.

241
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:19,812
- I wish you could.

242
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,471
You're the best
temp I've ever had.

243
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:26,094
Hell, you're the best
secretary, period.

244
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:27,716
- Well, Senator, thank you,

245
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:30,339
but I'm sure your regular
assistant is terrific.

246
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:31,617
- You know what I'm thinking?

247
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:34,654
The least I can do is
buy you a nice dinner.

248
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:36,000
What's your favorite restaurant?

249
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,243
- Oh, no, Senator, really--
- Now, come on.

250
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:39,141
You've gotta be just
as hungry as I am.

251
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:42,593
Let's wrap this up and
go get something to eat.

252
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,530
- Senator Berg's office.

253
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,049
- Bill Gilley for the senator.

254
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:52,431
- Well, I'll see if
the senator's still in.

255
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,847
I believe he may
have left already.

256
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:05,029
- How about the Carriage House?

257
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:07,894
Now, that's the best
restaurant on the hill.

258
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,758
- I love the Carriage House.

259
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:11,967
Shall I say you'll call
back in the morning?

260
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,935
- Late in the morning.

261
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,353
- I'm sorry, Mr.
Gilley, but I believe

262
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:21,460
that he's already left.

263
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,772
- Bill, what's going on?

264
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:25,256
- We've got a situation here.

265
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,466
There's a plane leaving Dallas
at 11:45 tomorrow morning.

266
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,708
Be on it.

267
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,847
- What the hell are
you talking about?

268
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:31,953
- Now, hold on, slow down.

269
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:33,575
I can't just drop everything.

270
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,649
I've got a full plate here.

271
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:40,375
- I don't care about
your full plate.

272
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,583
Be on that plane.

273
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,274
And leave your little
black book at home.

274
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:44,931
You take the time
to unzip your fly

275
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:47,762
on this trip and you
may find yourself dead!

276
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,632
- You're right, I am starving.

277
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:22,900
- I will call you on the
Selby contracts tomorrow.

278
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,729
Okey-doke?

279
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:31,530
Hello.

280
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,704
- Adeeb, Bill Gilley.

281
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:36,120
- I told you never to
call me on this phone.

282
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,433
- I've got good news,
terrific news actually.

283
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,400
- Are you a fool?

284
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,438
I will not discuss this
matter on a cellphone.

285
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,026
- Alright, we can
discuss it in person.

286
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:46,545
I'm free tomorrow afternoon.

287
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:49,824
- You are anything
but free, Mr. Gilley.

288
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:52,620
And we will meet
when I am available.

289
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,796
Tomorrow night.

290
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:03,285
- Alright, I can make it
tomorrow night, no problem.

291
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:04,114
See you then.

292
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:07,496
- Idiot.

293
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,159
- I've been waiting
for you, senator.

294
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:49,987
You're late.

295
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,818
You know, you're not
supposed to keep me waiting.

296
00:26:52,818 --> 00:26:54,095
- I'm sorry.

297
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:56,545
- Well, I'm sorry, but
sorry doesn't cut it.

298
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:59,238
Now get over here,

299
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:03,069
and undress me.

300
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:05,140
- Darling, you are special, mm.

301
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:30,847
- What?

302
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:38,475
- It's locked.
- It's locked, so what?

303
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,344
- Oh my god, he's alive!

304
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:48,209
- Are they busy?

305
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:49,210
- Very busy.

306
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:52,454
- Come on, baby, you're
starting to scare me here.

307
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:55,147
- He's gonna kill us!

308
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:58,288
- What a way to go!

309
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:06,425
- Scared the shit outta me.

310
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:11,810
You know, I oughta
get more for this.

311
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,949
He was a little bull,

312
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:14,743
ripped the film right
outta my camera.

313
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:18,575
Luckily, I took
more than one roll.

314
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,927
They were living
together in La Jolla.

315
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:29,068
He's a nine-to-fiver,
a boat mechanic.

316
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:32,969
Goes by the name
of Martin Grant.

317
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:34,971
- She's a hot little pincushion,

318
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:36,938
works in the Federal
Building Downtown.

319
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:42,495
- The Federal Building?

320
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:45,291
- Yeah, works on the
staff of a Senator Mixton.

321
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:49,848
Her name is Cali,
it's Cali Goodwin.

322
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,160
- Why'd you take so many
pictures of the broad?

323
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:53,990
- Pretty girl.

324
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:03,551
- The senator and I
go back a long way.

325
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:04,828
- Yeah, like I give a shit.

326
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:07,624
Look, why don't you
give me my money,

327
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:08,867
let me get outta here.

328
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,178
You got everything you
want in the envelope.

329
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:18,635
I'll tell you something,
Katz, you give me the creeps.

330
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,500
- I give you the creeps?

331
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:23,260
That's too bad.

332
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:27,333
It's too bad I don't
give you the runs.

333
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:29,266
- What the hell is this?

334
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,095
- A new diet.

335
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:35,376
- Hey, man, what are you doing?

336
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:39,173
Come on, Katz, I mean I've
known you since I was thin.

337
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:42,314
- That's right.

338
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:43,729
I'd shoot you in the belly.

339
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,457
Take about five years
to reach your heart.

340
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,151
I left you a nice headstone.

341
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:06,683
- I can't believe that crazy
bastard just killed Tom,

342
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:09,928
just like that.

343
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,311
- He just played
golf two weeks ago.

344
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,382
Tom joined this
new country club.

345
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:17,763
He and Jenny were so excited.

346
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:19,454
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he was a great guy.

347
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:20,697
And he knew every dirty joke,

348
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:22,250
and he got laid three
or four times a day

349
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,494
and now he's dead, which
is what we're going to be

350
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:26,772
if we don't figure out
what we're going to do.

351
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,159
- Can you spare one of those?

352
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,408
- So, what are we gonna do?

353
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:43,927
- I haven't the faintest idea.

354
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:48,967
- When he first surfaced I
thought it was good news.

355
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,451
I thought we'd finally
get off the hot seat

356
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:53,937
with the deed by being able
to offer him something.

357
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:57,113
That Raven would be looking to
go back to business as usual.

358
00:32:57,113 --> 00:32:58,459
- Business as usual?

359
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,978
For that maniac, it's murder.

360
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,256
He's gotten back to
business as usual.

361
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:07,226
Why did he turn on us?

362
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:08,779
This I don't understand?

363
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,367
- Why?

364
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:11,299
Because he figured
out that we sent him

365
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:13,336
on a one-way mission that's why.

366
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:17,581
- Well, we intended
for him to come back.

367
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,135
After all, we
needed the decoder.

368
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:20,377
- Yes, we needed
him to come back.

369
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:21,585
I think he knew that.

370
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:22,517
I think he also
knew it was the last

371
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:23,587
thing we needed him to do.

372
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,352
- Alright, we should
feed him to Adeeb.

373
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:31,940
We'll get 'em both
off our backs.

374
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,012
- Now, I spoke with Adeeb.

375
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,841
- You did, when?

376
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,843
- Yesterday, before Tom
got himself blown up

377
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:41,433
and I realized how
flipped out Raven was.

378
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:43,607
- How did it go?

379
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:44,919
- Oh, it went great

380
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,093
since I thought I
was gonna be able

381
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,611
to deliver the decoder to him.

382
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:52,582
- You told him we
had the decoder?

383
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:54,066
- I thought we would.

384
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,379
I thought Raven was just
setting us up for the big bucks.

385
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:58,105
Then he hung up on me,
but I thought he'd call

386
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:59,899
back and try to
jack up the price.

387
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:03,351
So, yeah, yeah, I told him we
would be able to deliver it.

388
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,735
In fact, I set up a
meeting for tonight.

389
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:14,569
I think I'm ready
for one of those now.

390
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:20,023
- Shit, in a hand cart.

391
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,407
You'll have to keep
that appointment.

392
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:27,099
- Me, what am I
gonna say to him?

393
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,205
Does he think I
have the decoder?

394
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:31,034
- Just do what you
always do, bullshit.

395
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,794
You're a senator
for Christ's sake.

396
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:34,831
- Sheez.

397
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:38,352
- Alright, forget it.

398
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:40,492
I'll handle it myself.

399
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:44,289
- Alright, alright.

400
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:46,774
What do we do about Raven?

401
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:48,500
- Well, that's what
we're here for.

402
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,708
Between the three of us we must

403
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:52,228
have an IQ that
totals at least 100.

404
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:53,815
I think we should be
able to out think Raven.

405
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:55,265
We've done it before.

406
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:56,853
We should be able to do it now.

407
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:12,040
Thank you for seeing me, Adeeb.

408
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,460
If I'm early, I could
always wait out in--

409
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,841
- Say what you have to say.

410
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:21,291
I have already waited too long

411
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,293
for you to tell me
where the decoder is.

412
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,918
- Perhaps this should
wait until you're through.

413
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,302
- Do not concern
yourself with Miko.

414
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,650
She speaks only Japanese.

415
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:40,414
Now, where is it?

416
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,832
- I guarantee you'll have
it by the end of the week.

417
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:46,523
That is what you
told me two years ago

418
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:48,767
when I paid for it in full.

419
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:50,907
- And we had a
setback as I told you.

420
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:53,323
We lost our whole
team on that mission.

421
00:35:53,323 --> 00:35:54,566
The device has been recovered.

422
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:55,946
There are just a
few small matters

423
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,984
to be concluded and
the decoder is yours.

424
00:35:58,984 --> 00:36:03,126
A little late, but just as
valuable, perhaps even more so.

425
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:06,992
- You have used up
all my goodwill.

426
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:11,410
The entire Four Star team
is running on borrowed time.

427
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,137
I only waited to see
if the device surfaced

428
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:17,209
somewhere else on the market,
perhaps to a higher bidder.

429
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:21,593
You and the others would
have heard from me again.

430
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,596
- Let's not start
with the threats.

431
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,737
First of all, no one was
screwing anyone here.

432
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:29,877
You paid for the device, it
was always coming to you.

433
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:31,189
- Two years late.

434
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,776
- But here, nonetheless.

435
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,778
And by the end of the
week, like I said.

436
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:37,643
- You've had enough time.

437
00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:41,026
In 72 hours, I will have
the decoder which I paid for

438
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:44,167
or you, Mr. Gilley,
will have much trouble,

439
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,065
which you have paid for.

440
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:48,136
- What the hell is 24
hours, more or less?

441
00:36:48,136 --> 00:36:48,965
- Exactly.

442
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:56,662
One of my assistants will
call you with the particulars.

443
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:22,136
- Keep it coming.

444
00:37:38,014 --> 00:37:39,222
- I'll see you tomorrow.

445
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,328
You finished already?

446
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:43,122
- Yeah, it was just
the bleeder valve.

447
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:44,365
- Guess your outta here then.

448
00:37:44,365 --> 00:37:46,850
- That I am, got me
a hot date tonight.

449
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,990
- Don't let your
girlfriend find out.

450
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,440
- A year as of today.

451
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,271
- How did a bum like you end
up with a sweetheart like that?

452
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:57,136
Martin.

453
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:58,586
- What?

454
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:00,105
- How did a bum like you end
up with a sweetheart like that?

455
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:02,176
- Uh, we kept bumping
into each other

456
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:04,143
and she finally asked
me out to dinner.

457
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:06,560
I've been hooked ever since.

458
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,251
- So you got a
surprise for tonight?

459
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:09,701
- Surprise.

460
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:11,530
Yeah, I'd say I have a
little surprise for her.

461
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,464
- I bet you do.

462
00:38:19,193 --> 00:38:22,127
- Martin, it's beautiful.

463
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:23,508
I don't know what to say.

464
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:25,924
- Yes, might be a good answer.

465
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:30,238
- Yes, I'll marry you.

466
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,251
- Have I told you
how much I love you?

467
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:45,184
- I think you just did.

468
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,980
- You mean the world to me.

469
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:51,329
What do you say
the two of us start

470
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,469
our lives fresh, somewhere else?

471
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:57,507
- What do you mean?

472
00:38:57,507 --> 00:38:58,612
- Let's move.

473
00:38:58,612 --> 00:38:59,716
Anywhere you wanna go.

474
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,271
- Oh, sweetheart,
I don't wanna move.

475
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:04,445
This is our home.

476
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,932
If this is about the
nightmares you've been having,

477
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:11,797
I have something
special for you, too.

478
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:12,626
'Kay?

479
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:13,454
- Yeah.

480
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,354
- Come here.

481
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:20,530
Open it.

482
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:30,022
It's a dreamcatcher.

483
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:31,714
We can hang it over
our bed and it'll

484
00:39:31,714 --> 00:39:33,509
catch all your bad dreams.

485
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:35,338
- It's wonderful.

486
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,306
Tonight, Mrs. Grant,

487
00:39:39,998 --> 00:39:41,482
I've got a feeling my nightmares

488
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:43,208
are gonna be a
million miles away.

489
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:45,106
- I hope so.

490
00:41:12,331 --> 00:41:13,160
Martin?

491
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,300
Promise me something.

492
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:18,441
- What is it?

493
00:41:20,132 --> 00:41:22,894
- Promise me someday there'll
be no secrets between us.

494
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:14,290
- I knew you were still alive.

495
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,533
- Let me ask you something.

496
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,674
Do you get paid by the
barnacle or by the hour?

497
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,850
- You sent the fat guy with
the elephant lens, didn't you?

498
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,196
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

499
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:25,404
- Oh, sure you do.

500
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:26,544
I thought the CIA
had finally caught up

501
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,994
to me until, uh, the paper read

502
00:42:28,994 --> 00:42:31,031
that a private eye
was found dead.

503
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:32,170
Then I knew it was you.

504
00:42:33,378 --> 00:42:34,621
- Long time no see.

505
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:36,657
- Not long enough, Raven.

506
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:41,282
- Well.

507
00:42:41,282 --> 00:42:46,218
You went from crack commando
to Popeye the sailor.

508
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:48,393
It was a great career move.

509
00:42:48,393 --> 00:42:50,429
- Puppets, that's all we were.

510
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,398
- Great, you finally got it.

511
00:42:53,398 --> 00:42:56,919
You know, when they
found the helicopter

512
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:58,092
they thought I was dead.

513
00:43:00,405 --> 00:43:01,993
Funny thing happened
to you on your way

514
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:04,961
to this stylish job you got.

515
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:07,274
You forgot to give your half of

516
00:43:07,274 --> 00:43:09,897
the decoder back to the company.

517
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:12,417
- Well, I wish I could help you,

518
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,626
but it kinda got
lost in the water.

519
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,007
- Is that what you told 'em?

520
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:17,318
That's good.

521
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:19,597
You see, 'cause I
have the other half.

522
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,943
And that makes us partners.

523
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:22,289
We're millionaires.

524
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:27,087
- We've had this conversation,
Raven, and you shot me.

525
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:28,191
- You grabbed the gun.

526
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,436
- You're doing exactly
what they want you to do.

527
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:32,264
Sell it.

528
00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:35,613
- How many barnacles
do you have to scrape,

529
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,339
kid, to get millions of dollars?

530
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:39,893
- It's not gonna happen, Raven.

531
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:44,691
- I don't think you
know about this.

532
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:49,454
A few days ago, a senator,
Burke, he was wasted.

533
00:43:50,179 --> 00:43:51,456
It's gonna happen again.

534
00:43:51,456 --> 00:43:52,388
Gonna go from Four
Star to Three Star

535
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:54,424
to Two Star and then No Stars.

536
00:43:55,736 --> 00:43:57,876
- Just getting rid of
your competition, huh?

537
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,917
- I don't have any competition.

538
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:06,402
- I don't have the device.

539
00:44:13,305 --> 00:44:14,859
- Of course, you do.

540
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,448
- Get out of here, Raven,

541
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:19,484
I've got work to do.

542
00:44:23,868 --> 00:44:25,076
- Great to see you, kid.

543
00:44:26,594 --> 00:44:28,217
Just a word of advice.

544
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:31,427
You know that beautiful
gal that you're dating.

545
00:44:37,122 --> 00:44:39,884
I'd be careful if I were you.

546
00:44:39,884 --> 00:44:40,712
She's a bitch.

547
00:44:58,626 --> 00:44:59,835
- Listen up, now.

548
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:01,629
I mean, it's going
on as we speak, bro.

549
00:45:01,629 --> 00:45:05,461
I'm talking about UN
tanks on US soil, man.

550
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:08,533
Training, practicing maneuvers.

551
00:45:10,604 --> 00:45:12,571
- You know, you talk too much.

552
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:15,264
- Well, baby, maybe
you don't talk enough.

553
00:45:15,264 --> 00:45:17,162
- I let this do my talking.

554
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:20,545
- You know something, Eva?

555
00:45:20,545 --> 00:45:22,547
We got a cause
going on here, baby.

556
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:26,033
We stand for something, just
in case you fucking forgot!

557
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:28,277
- What is it, Gary,
you worried about me?

558
00:45:28,277 --> 00:45:29,554
Huh?

559
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:30,831
- What about you, Hub?

560
00:45:32,074 --> 00:45:34,076
- I got no beef with you.

561
00:45:34,076 --> 00:45:35,733
- Here's some beef
for you, baby.

562
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:44,742
- Alright, children,
put your toys down.

563
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,812
Put 'em down!

564
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,574
Go load the van.

565
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,614
Hey.

566
00:45:59,135 --> 00:46:00,205
You alright?

567
00:46:00,205 --> 00:46:01,172
- We need to talk.

568
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:03,484
- Later.
- No, now!

569
00:46:03,484 --> 00:46:05,417
- I love it when you
talk rough to me.

570
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:06,246
- Do you?

571
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:07,868
I can barely remember.

572
00:46:09,905 --> 00:46:11,769
- Why don't we talk when
the men are not around?

573
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,115
- What men, they're scum.

574
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:14,979
- Why don't we talk when
the scum is not around?

575
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:17,429
- Whatever they are,
they're fanatics!

576
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:19,190
You know, they're fighting
for this cause and that.

577
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,847
Things they don't
even understand

578
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:22,745
but they will kill for that.

579
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:24,574
- Takes all kinds.

580
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,749
- No, it only takes one kind.

581
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:29,717
Our kind.

582
00:46:29,717 --> 00:46:34,377
We kill for money, none
of which I've seen yet.

583
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:38,796
You did say more than
I could ever spend.

584
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,143
- I said more than
we can ever spend.

585
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:43,386
If you're gonna quote
me, quote me correctly.

586
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,666
- There are many things I
can quote you saying to me.

587
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:50,531
- You know the difference
between us and the scum?

588
00:46:50,531 --> 00:46:51,360
- Hm?

589
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,740
- We know when.

590
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,259
- We know when, what?

591
00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:57,435
- We know when to shoot,
we know when to lay low.

592
00:46:58,436 --> 00:46:59,817
We know when to pull out.

593
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:04,407
We know when to let go.

594
00:47:05,512 --> 00:47:06,340
Now.

595
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:12,864
This could mean millions,
millions for us.

596
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:13,934
We got one shot.

597
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:16,764
I've been planning
escaping for so long

598
00:47:16,764 --> 00:47:20,009
I can't remember, and I'm
not gonna let you blow it

599
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:22,736
'cause you can't control
yourself for one week

600
00:47:22,736 --> 00:47:26,084
or one month, or however long
it takes for this to go down.

601
00:47:27,465 --> 00:47:32,021
Now, you are a great
lady, but not that great.

602
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:36,957
And if you believe that,
I got some swamp property

603
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,718
in Florida I'll sell you.

604
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:47,761
Now, I got a call
on next senator.

605
00:47:47,761 --> 00:47:49,038
- Mixton.

606
00:47:49,038 --> 00:47:50,384
- Mixton, right.

607
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:03,259
- Senator, here are the
demographics from the committee.

608
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:09,231
Night.

609
00:48:09,231 --> 00:48:10,059
- Good night.

610
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,379
- Coffee Young Center,
may I help you?

611
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:20,967
Hi, Al, it's Cali.

612
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:21,829
- Hi, how are you?

613
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:23,176
- Very well, thank you.

614
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,902
Did he tell you the news?

615
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,179
Yes, he did.

616
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:27,905
- Isn't it wonderful?

617
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,871
- It's great.

618
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:30,079
When are you getting married?

619
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:30,942
- Well, we haven't
set a date yet.

620
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:33,600
Could I talk to Martin?

621
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,532
- Yes, hold on.

622
00:48:34,532 --> 00:48:35,360
Hey, Martin!

623
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:40,710
Guess who?

624
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:44,991
- Hello?

625
00:48:44,991 --> 00:48:46,233
- Hey, you.

626
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:47,407
- Hey, baby,
what are you doing?

627
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:49,305
- Ooh, not much.

628
00:48:49,305 --> 00:48:52,032
Financial meetings, board
meetings, committee meetings.

629
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:54,000
How 'bout you?

630
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,002
- Chris craft, Hatteras,
and Bay liners.

631
00:48:57,693 --> 00:48:58,521
- I love you.

632
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,697
- Did you call just
to tell me that?

633
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:02,629
And what if it was?

634
00:49:02,629 --> 00:49:04,942
- I'd say you made my day.

635
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:05,804
Good.

636
00:49:05,804 --> 00:49:06,736
Then I'll see you later?

637
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,566
You can bet on it.

638
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:09,532
- Okay, buh-bye.

639
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:46,086
- Step over here please.

640
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:48,813
- I got a plate in my knee
and a plate in my shoulder.

641
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:55,993
- Hey, you got a plate
in your knee and a

642
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,925
plate in your shoulder.

643
00:49:57,925 --> 00:49:58,857
- Is there an echo in here?

644
00:49:58,857 --> 00:49:59,858
I think I just said that.

645
00:49:59,858 --> 00:50:00,687
Hello.

646
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:01,515
Thank you.

647
00:51:48,277 --> 00:51:49,589
- Have this delivered
to the senator

648
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:51,936
after his meeting and
hold all of my calls.

649
00:52:04,638 --> 00:52:05,570
- Where's Katz?

650
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:06,847
- He's supposed to be with you.

651
00:52:06,847 --> 00:52:08,332
- I didn't see him.

652
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,233
- Yeah?

653
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,752
- I'm out.

654
00:52:14,752 --> 00:52:15,580
Blow it.

655
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,998
- Katz is out, blow it.

656
00:52:21,034 --> 00:52:22,415
- To freedom.

657
00:52:22,415 --> 00:52:23,795
- To freedom.

658
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:48,095
- It's too late now.

659
00:52:48,095 --> 00:52:49,580
I'll get that first
thing in the morning.

660
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,546
Thanks.

661
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:02,040
This is WGYN Radio
with a newsflash.

662
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,973
Minutes ago, the
Federal Building located

663
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:07,494
in Downtown San Diego
suffered a massive explosion.

664
00:53:07,494 --> 00:53:10,601
No word on survivors but
the casualties are mounting.

665
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:11,602
- Oh my God!

666
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:12,430
Martin!

667
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:21,922
Once again, a major explosion

668
00:53:21,922 --> 00:53:24,131
has rocked Downtown San Diego.

669
00:53:24,131 --> 00:53:26,203
So far there are four deaths.

670
00:53:33,071 --> 00:53:34,556
Most of the damage was localized

671
00:53:34,556 --> 00:53:37,041
to California senator
Wilbur Mixton's wing.

672
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:40,217
It is believed his entire
staff has been killed.

673
00:54:05,483 --> 00:54:06,312
- Sir.

674
00:54:44,108 --> 00:54:44,936
- Hi.

675
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:48,285
Nice pad.

676
00:54:51,598 --> 00:54:54,429
- You son of a bitch, you killed
all those innocent people.

677
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,190
- We rang the fire alarm.

678
00:54:58,053 --> 00:55:00,020
Most of the people got out.

679
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,884
- Cali was in that building.

680
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:05,509
- As for Cali, I told you it was

681
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:08,201
gonna happen at the boat yard.

682
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:09,858
You shoulda warned her.

683
00:55:11,169 --> 00:55:12,239
- You're crazy.

684
00:55:14,725 --> 00:55:15,691
Uh huh.

685
00:55:17,175 --> 00:55:18,763
I am crazy.

686
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:22,353
You'd do well to member that.

687
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:28,325
Now where is the other
half of the decoder?

688
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,430
- I told you, I don't have it.

689
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:44,133
- You have it alright.

690
00:55:45,272 --> 00:55:47,344
And you better start
remembering where it is

691
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,348
'cause if you don't, I'm gonna
start blowing up buildings

692
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:55,213
and this time I'm not
gonna ring any fire alarms.

693
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,412
You hear me?

694
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,378
Get it together!

695
00:56:56,378 --> 00:56:57,862
You know, you're full of shit!

696
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:00,037
I said, waste her!

697
00:57:00,037 --> 00:57:01,832
- Cali was in that building.

698
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:03,316
- Most of the people got out.

699
00:57:16,709 --> 00:57:19,988
Where is the other
half of the decoder?

700
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,583
- Alright, Katz, you want it,

701
00:57:31,517 --> 00:57:32,414
you got it.

702
00:58:01,132 --> 00:58:03,134
- Adeeb, my friend.

703
00:58:03,134 --> 00:58:04,446
Good to see you again.

704
00:58:06,344 --> 00:58:09,209
- How long is it since you've
been in my neck of the woods?

705
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:10,694
- Enough of your pleasantries,

706
00:58:10,694 --> 00:58:12,489
I have already been through it.

707
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,214
It has been one year
since we last met.

708
00:58:14,214 --> 00:58:16,941
It has been two
years since I paid

709
00:58:16,941 --> 00:58:18,736
your group for the codebreaker.

710
00:58:18,736 --> 00:58:20,220
And don't think
that doesn't bother

711
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,843
me just as much as it does you.

712
00:58:21,843 --> 00:58:24,604
- Two years and I
still do not have it.

713
00:58:24,604 --> 00:58:26,848
- I have agents working
on it right now, Adeeb.

714
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:29,989
We're close, we're
very, very close.

715
00:58:39,757 --> 00:58:41,621
We're very close.

716
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:43,140
Believe me, I want this thing.

717
00:58:48,939 --> 00:58:50,181
As promised.

718
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:52,252
- Well, you had
better work faster

719
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:54,738
as you do not have
that much time.

720
00:58:56,153 --> 00:58:58,327
- Wait a minute, are
you threatening me.

721
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,102
Look.

722
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:15,828
Calm down.

723
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:23,939
This is supposed to
be a friendly business meeting.

724
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:25,182
Right?

725
00:59:25,182 --> 00:59:29,013
Adeeb, friends don't
threaten one another.

726
00:59:29,013 --> 00:59:33,431
- All I meant was I want
the decoder or my money

727
00:59:33,431 --> 00:59:35,917
before the rest of
you are executed.

728
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:36,745
- Executed.

729
00:59:37,919 --> 00:59:40,577
- You are in a bit of
trouble, my friend.

730
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,200
Two of your associates
have already been killed.

731
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,615
- Well.

732
00:59:44,615 --> 00:59:46,893
Look, I have people looking
into that, believe me.

733
00:59:46,893 --> 00:59:48,792
Nothing is gonna happen to me.

734
00:59:54,867 --> 00:59:57,386
- I got Sklar in my sights.

735
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:58,387
- Everybody, set in.

736
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,873
- Check.

737
01:00:00,873 --> 01:00:02,115
- Check.

738
01:00:02,115 --> 01:00:03,358
- We just have to
be a little patient.

739
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:05,394
Just both of us, a
little more patient.

740
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:07,293
Just give me a little more time.

741
01:00:09,813 --> 01:00:12,436
- Alright, it's your kill shot.

742
01:00:12,436 --> 01:00:13,299
On your call.

743
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:17,337
- Always with you, it's--

744
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:20,237
- Son of a bitch!

745
01:00:20,237 --> 01:00:21,238
- What is happening?

746
01:00:30,557 --> 01:00:31,489
- Deuce?

747
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:33,043
- What the hell is going on?

748
01:00:33,043 --> 01:00:34,320
- Don't fall apart.

749
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,218
Everybody stick to
business, alright?

750
01:00:36,218 --> 01:00:37,530
I got the senator.

751
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:18,019
- Hello, senator.

752
01:01:21,022 --> 01:01:21,850
- Katz.

753
01:01:25,336 --> 01:01:27,511
I knew it, I knew it.

754
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:31,342
I told the others you didn't
die in a chopper crash.

755
01:01:31,342 --> 01:01:33,206
I've been hearing
that a lot lately.

756
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:34,829
I'm indestructible.

757
01:01:34,829 --> 01:01:36,485
Sorry, you're not.

758
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:37,555
- Wait a minute,
hold it, hold it.

759
01:01:37,555 --> 01:01:39,005
Don't get crazy.

760
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:41,767
- Well, there's crazy
good and crazy bad.

761
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:43,285
I'm crazy good.

762
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:44,562
It keeps me sharp.

763
01:01:44,562 --> 01:01:46,150
- Listen, I can
still help you, Katz.

764
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:49,878
I got connections,
contacts, important people.

765
01:01:49,878 --> 01:01:50,776
- Pop quiz.

766
01:01:52,363 --> 01:01:55,642
Who can take this country
down faster than anybody?

767
01:01:57,886 --> 01:02:00,130
- Bzzz, times up.

768
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:03,443
Corrupt officials like you
that don't care anything

769
01:02:03,443 --> 01:02:06,964
about this country, just
care about themselves.

770
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:09,311
Well, I'm taking
you off the ballot.

771
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:10,243
- Please, man.

772
01:02:10,243 --> 01:02:12,004
Christ, have some compassion.

773
01:02:12,004 --> 01:02:13,212
- Compassion?

774
01:02:13,212 --> 01:02:15,421
Oh, I took that in night school.

775
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:18,044
I failed it.

776
01:02:19,011 --> 01:02:20,667
Say good night.

777
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:33,059
Raven.

778
01:02:36,373 --> 01:02:37,754
- Hello, Deuce?

779
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,100
I thought that was you.

780
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,377
Where are you?

781
01:02:40,377 --> 01:02:41,723
- Close by.

782
01:02:42,897 --> 01:02:45,900
This Raven team isn't
as good as we were.

783
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,661
You're right,
you did me a favor.

784
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:51,733
Now I don't have
so many partners.

785
01:02:52,907 --> 01:02:54,771
Just you and me
kid, right, 50-50?

786
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,013
- Sure.

787
01:02:56,013 --> 01:02:57,325
Come on out, we'll
talk about it.

788
01:02:58,257 --> 01:02:59,741
I don't think so.

789
01:03:00,673 --> 01:03:02,192
We'll talk later.

790
01:03:02,192 --> 01:03:02,986
Gotta run.

791
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:12,512
- Who are you?

792
01:03:12,512 --> 01:03:15,205
Who are you?

793
01:03:15,205 --> 01:03:16,447
The FBI?

794
01:03:17,517 --> 01:03:19,796
You work for the
government, you scumbag?

795
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:23,144
Why don't you kill me?

796
01:03:23,144 --> 01:03:24,870
Go ahead, do it.

797
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:29,046
- My fiance was
in that building.

798
01:03:32,084 --> 01:03:35,052
- Don't take it personally,
it was business.

799
01:03:37,054 --> 01:03:38,090
- It was murder.

800
01:03:39,022 --> 01:03:41,576
- It was part of a job.

801
01:03:41,576 --> 01:03:43,750
- You must be proud of yourself.

802
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,718
Killing innocent
people for money.

803
01:03:46,788 --> 01:03:48,169
And what did you get for it?

804
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:51,448
Nothing.

805
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,519
Where is Katz headed?

806
01:03:55,107 --> 01:03:57,488
- You got all the king's men,

807
01:03:57,488 --> 01:03:59,801
but you didn't get
the king himself.

808
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:01,976
- You should think about
who you're dying for.

809
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:05,255
Katz doesn't give
a shit about you.

810
01:04:07,602 --> 01:04:09,017
How does it feel to be used?

811
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:13,539
You heard him, you're
all expendable.

812
01:04:13,539 --> 01:04:17,405
- Go to hell.

813
01:04:17,405 --> 01:04:18,233
Hey!

814
01:04:20,201 --> 01:04:22,824
Don't let them take me alive.

815
01:04:32,523 --> 01:04:33,697
- Where is he?

816
01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:39,634
- At base in Carlsbad.

817
01:04:39,634 --> 01:04:43,017
A closed down
warehouse, 1500 Cherry.

818
01:05:25,197 --> 01:05:26,439
- Okay, thanks.

819
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,650
- It's a warzone.

820
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:33,515
- It was a war, Russ,
with heavy casualties.

821
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:36,898
We've got one dead
senator, Robert Sklar.

822
01:05:36,898 --> 01:05:39,521
Shot at close range,
execution style.

823
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:43,456
A multi-billionaire
oil sheik, Adeeb Husay.

824
01:05:43,456 --> 01:05:46,494
Four dead John Does
and one dead Jane Doe.

825
01:05:47,874 --> 01:05:49,255
- That's a mess.

826
01:05:49,255 --> 01:05:50,843
- Yeah, a bloody one.

827
01:05:52,017 --> 01:05:53,708
- Let's get outta here.

828
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:57,194
- Okay.

829
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:11,484
- Okay, the commanders
are connected

830
01:06:11,484 --> 01:06:13,970
to a group of
anti-government militants.

831
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,454
Agents in San Diego are trying

832
01:06:15,454 --> 01:06:17,490
to link these terrorists
to the bombing last week.

833
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,423
- Okay.
- Now one member, Gary Alban,

834
01:06:19,423 --> 01:06:21,218
has a warehouse in Carlsbad.

835
01:06:22,323 --> 01:06:24,808
- Call Jim Jacobson
in Washington.

836
01:06:24,808 --> 01:06:27,707
Tell him I need a
federal warrant to
search those premises.

837
01:06:27,707 --> 01:06:29,986
And a SWAT team to meet
us there in two hours.

838
01:06:31,194 --> 01:06:32,678
- Two hours?

839
01:06:32,678 --> 01:06:33,990
- Did I stutter?

840
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:41,998
- Two hours.

841
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:04,096
- Cali!

842
01:10:06,029 --> 01:10:06,857
- Ah!

843
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:08,790
Untie me.

844
01:10:12,691 --> 01:10:14,417
- Very touching.

845
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:15,314
Drop it, Deuce.

846
01:10:16,695 --> 01:10:18,559
Drop the knife or
I'll put a hole

847
01:10:18,559 --> 01:10:20,733
right between her
pretty little eyes.

848
01:10:23,115 --> 01:10:23,943
Thank you.

849
01:10:31,434 --> 01:10:33,953
I was keeping her
for my trump card.

850
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,543
Got a great little broad there.

851
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:39,096
Had a wonderful talk with her.

852
01:10:39,096 --> 01:10:41,133
Now she knows
everything about you.

853
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:45,517
I had my way with
her a couple times.

854
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:48,830
You're not gonna buy that, huh?

855
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:51,454
I didn't think you would.

856
01:10:51,454 --> 01:10:53,594
- I just wanted out.

857
01:10:53,594 --> 01:10:54,802
- Uh huh.

858
01:10:54,802 --> 01:10:56,286
Well, I just wanted
the other half

859
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:58,357
of this goddamn decoder!

860
01:11:00,739 --> 01:11:02,188
- Move in!

861
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:08,816
- Cali, this way.

862
01:12:00,523 --> 01:12:05,113
Go!

863
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:50,780
- Freeze, freeze!

864
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:53,127
Up against the car, come on.

865
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:06,105
- You have the right
to remain silent.

866
01:13:55,845 --> 01:13:56,846
- Mr. Katz.

867
01:13:57,847 --> 01:13:59,296
- Yo.

868
01:13:59,296 --> 01:14:00,332
- Russ Cormack here.

869
01:14:01,782 --> 01:14:05,475
Listen, tied up a couple of
my boys in knots back there.

870
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:06,821
Said you wouldn't talk.

871
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:07,650
Cigarette?

872
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:09,686
- Yeah.

873
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:15,796
- Virginia boy, huh?

874
01:14:15,796 --> 01:14:16,624
- Mm-hmm.

875
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:20,214
- In and out of detention halls.

876
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:22,699
At 16, you lied about your age.

877
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:24,805
Turned to professional boxing.

878
01:14:24,805 --> 01:14:27,601
Invited by the judge to
enlist in the military.

879
01:14:27,601 --> 01:14:28,981
- Oh yeah.

880
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:32,364
- 18, you're in Vietnam,
explosives expert.

881
01:14:33,572 --> 01:14:34,573
Three tours of duty.

882
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:40,199
Worked for the Phoenix
Program as an assassin.

883
01:14:41,407 --> 01:14:43,927
Cited for over 108 kills.

884
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:47,690
Jesus, how can one man
kill that many people?

885
01:14:51,141 --> 01:14:53,454
- I was just doing what
the Man told me to do.

886
01:14:54,766 --> 01:14:56,112
And I was good at it.

887
01:14:57,044 --> 01:14:58,390
- Yeah.

888
01:14:58,390 --> 01:14:59,840
Yeah, I bet you were.

889
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,946
Two Brown Stars,
two Silver Stars,

890
01:15:02,946 --> 01:15:04,879
four Purple Hearts.

891
01:15:06,363 --> 01:15:10,816
Made a Lieutenant Colonel,
then in 1976 the file ends.

892
01:15:10,816 --> 01:15:11,852
Nothing.

893
01:15:11,852 --> 01:15:13,439
Zip.

894
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:17,029
So what did you do, fall
off the face of the Earth?

895
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:55,689
- Come on, babe, we're here.

896
01:16:04,836 --> 01:16:07,493
- What are we doing
at my brother's place?

897
01:16:07,493 --> 01:16:09,772
- It's the safest
place I could think of.

898
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:11,567
Doesn't look like
anybody's home.

899
01:16:26,029 --> 01:16:26,858
- Hey.

900
01:17:00,685 --> 01:17:02,790
- I'd like to tell you,
Russ, I really would

901
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,930
cause you're a
very likable fella,

902
01:17:06,104 --> 01:17:10,384
but, uh, that's
top secret and if

903
01:17:10,384 --> 01:17:15,078
I told you I'd have to kill ya.

904
01:17:15,078 --> 01:17:16,977
- You're a very funny guy.

905
01:17:16,977 --> 01:17:17,874
- Yeah, I'm funny.

906
01:17:19,393 --> 01:17:22,638
- Matter of fact, I'm opening
in Tahoe on the ninth,

907
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,226
that is if I, you know,
get out of all this mess.

908
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:27,401
You will come see me, won't ya?

909
01:17:27,401 --> 01:17:28,229
- Nah.

910
01:17:30,853 --> 01:17:31,681
What is this?

911
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,201
- Oh, that.

912
01:17:34,201 --> 01:17:39,206
Well, that's classified, Russ.

913
01:17:40,069 --> 01:17:41,622
I can't tell you about that.

914
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:44,694
- Russ, these guys
are with the CIA.

915
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:48,111
- Wait, wait, wait,
hold it, hold it.

916
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:49,872
- Agent Cormack,
I'm William Gilley.

917
01:17:49,872 --> 01:17:51,701
I have papers from
Washington giving me custody

918
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:52,668
of the suspect.

919
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:53,841
- Hey, Gilley, how they hanging?

920
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:55,498
Watch him, Russ,
he's an asshole.

921
01:17:57,983 --> 01:17:59,019
- You know this guy?

922
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:01,573
- I'll take that, too.

923
01:18:01,573 --> 01:18:03,195
- No, no, my case.

924
01:18:04,541 --> 01:18:05,370
- Not anymore.

925
01:18:11,134 --> 01:18:12,688
- We'll talk outside.

926
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,359
- I bought some time.

927
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:31,327
I need to think about
what we're gonna do next.

928
01:18:32,846 --> 01:18:34,261
- Can I ask you a question?

929
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:36,332
Yeah.

930
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:38,990
- Is your name even Martin?

931
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,098
Is anything you
ever told me true?

932
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:47,239
You lied to me!

933
01:18:48,309 --> 01:18:49,138
- Listen to me.

934
01:18:52,762 --> 01:18:55,213
I never lied to you when
I said that I loved you.

935
01:19:12,575 --> 01:19:13,403
- Don't touch me.

936
01:19:15,509 --> 01:19:17,304
- I needed to start over, Cali.

937
01:19:19,858 --> 01:19:22,550
I thought I could leave
it behind and move on.

938
01:19:24,138 --> 01:19:27,659
I thought maybe if you
didn't know about my past,

939
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,215
but knew what was in my heart
everything would be okay.

940
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:34,839
I was wrong.

941
01:19:49,163 --> 01:19:50,337
- You did well, Agent Cormack.

942
01:19:50,337 --> 01:19:51,717
You helped us a great deal.

943
01:19:53,996 --> 01:19:55,376
- So long, Russ.

944
01:19:55,376 --> 01:19:57,585
- I'll see that your
efforts are duly noted.

945
01:19:59,242 --> 01:20:01,003
- That is the
biggest crock a shit

946
01:20:01,003 --> 01:20:02,763
you heard in your entire career!

947
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:04,869
Thanks, Miller.

948
01:20:06,077 --> 01:20:07,319
Not one thing that
man said since he

949
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:09,390
parachuted into this
case makes sense.

950
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,565
- Of course not, he's CIA.

951
01:20:12,911 --> 01:20:14,948
They've got black
belts in bullshit.

952
01:20:17,467 --> 01:20:18,710
You wanna get some sushi?

953
01:20:20,091 --> 01:20:21,368
- You know, we busted our
humps in this case and

954
01:20:21,368 --> 01:20:23,094
that Agent Gilley up
here like the prince

955
01:20:23,094 --> 01:20:24,509
of darkness and snapped it
off our bladders and you want

956
01:20:24,509 --> 01:20:26,752
to get something to eat
like it never happened.

957
01:20:26,752 --> 01:20:30,239
- It didn't happen, not if
that's the way they want it.

958
01:20:31,688 --> 01:20:34,001
- How much you wanna bet by
the time we clock in tomorrow

959
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:36,176
this case won't even be
in the computers anymore?

960
01:20:36,176 --> 01:20:37,004
- I know.

961
01:20:39,282 --> 01:20:41,181
- How about that sushi?

962
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:42,389
I'll pay.

963
01:20:42,389 --> 01:20:43,286
- You'll pay?

964
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,255
- Did I stutter?

965
01:20:52,226 --> 01:20:53,055
- Yeah, I got it.

966
01:20:53,055 --> 01:20:54,711
We're on our way.

967
01:20:54,711 --> 01:20:57,093
Alright, let's get
this show on the road.

968
01:20:57,093 --> 01:20:58,681
- We're gonna talk, Billy Boy.

969
01:20:58,681 --> 01:21:00,372
- Get in the car, Katz.

970
01:21:00,372 --> 01:21:02,858
- Who's gonna put me in
the car, Heckle and Jekyll?

971
01:21:04,894 --> 01:21:06,068
- Get in the car, boys.

972
01:21:08,415 --> 01:21:10,658
You wanna talk,
come on, let's talk.

973
01:21:13,454 --> 01:21:15,008
- You got some set of
balls, you know that?

974
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:17,389
- I heard that before,
but never from a man.

975
01:21:17,389 --> 01:21:18,874
- Did you really think you
were gonna go into business

976
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,737
for yourself and I was
just gonna let you do it?

977
01:21:20,737 --> 01:21:24,155
- Let me do it, let me?

978
01:21:24,155 --> 01:21:27,089
- Every mission I ever
had I set up myself.

979
01:21:27,089 --> 01:21:28,469
I call all the shots.

980
01:21:28,469 --> 01:21:31,265
- You egomaniacal
prick, you work for me!

981
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:33,336
I backed up that mission
to snatch that decoder!

982
01:21:33,336 --> 01:21:34,890
I provided the intel
and the recon and you

983
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,684
were supposed to
deliver it to me!

984
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:39,618
- It was a one-way mission,
you son of a bitch!

985
01:21:39,618 --> 01:21:41,344
Nobody was gonna come
out of that alive

986
01:21:41,344 --> 01:21:43,036
and if they did come out
alive you wouldn't have

987
01:21:43,036 --> 01:21:45,176
let them stay alive, would ya?

988
01:21:45,176 --> 01:21:48,420
I lost four good men over
there, four good soldiers!

989
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:53,667
And I lost whatever
was left of my goddamn

990
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:55,772
conscience 'cause you killed it!

991
01:21:59,086 --> 01:21:59,915
- Jesus.

992
01:22:02,434 --> 01:22:04,816
Well, no matter what you
thought was happening,

993
01:22:04,816 --> 01:22:07,474
looks like we're going to
be working together again,

994
01:22:07,474 --> 01:22:08,682
unless you'd rather go back in

995
01:22:08,682 --> 01:22:10,304
there and face
that federal beef.

996
01:22:14,274 --> 01:22:15,827
- Going where?

997
01:22:15,827 --> 01:22:16,621
- Big Bear.

998
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:20,418
We got a job to finish.

999
01:22:20,418 --> 01:22:21,867
It'll be just like old times.

1000
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,594
- You can bet on it.

1001
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:48,411
- Hey.

1002
01:22:50,241 --> 01:22:51,897
You're right.

1003
01:22:51,897 --> 01:22:54,624
I shoulda told you
everything and I'm sorry.

1004
01:22:58,145 --> 01:22:59,664
I promise no more secrets.

1005
01:23:01,562 --> 01:23:03,875
- Is the person I fell
in love with even real?

1006
01:23:07,085 --> 01:23:07,948
- Yeah.

1007
01:23:10,606 --> 01:23:11,434
Come here.

1008
01:24:06,627 --> 01:24:09,009
When did you
lose your conscience?

1009
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:11,563
The moment I met you.

1010
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:24,990
Billy Gilley.

1011
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:33,585
You are an asshole.

1012
01:24:43,423 --> 01:24:45,494
- Good morning.

1013
01:24:47,185 --> 01:24:48,428
- Good morning.

1014
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:42,654
- How about some coffee?

1015
01:25:42,654 --> 01:25:43,897
- That'd be great.

1016
01:26:29,598 --> 01:26:30,771
- Water's on the stove.

1017
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,015
- They got something
to eat in there?

1018
01:26:34,706 --> 01:26:35,604
- Not a whole lot.

1019
01:26:42,024 --> 01:26:42,852
Come here.

1020
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:52,137
- What was that?

1021
01:26:57,315 --> 01:26:58,316
- Stay here.

1022
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,436
- No way.

1023
01:27:14,436 --> 01:27:15,816
- Don't look so
surprised, Martin.

1024
01:27:15,816 --> 01:27:18,923
Deep inside, you knew
something was wrong, didn't ya?

1025
01:27:18,923 --> 01:27:20,994
You just didn't face it.

1026
01:27:20,994 --> 01:27:21,857
Turn around!

1027
01:27:24,377 --> 01:27:25,481
- Hey, Deuce.

1028
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,763
You coming back like a song.

1029
01:27:31,763 --> 01:27:33,040
- More like the clap.

1030
01:27:34,594 --> 01:27:37,182
- I tell you the difference
between me and the clap?

1031
01:27:37,182 --> 01:27:38,391
- What's that?

1032
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:40,220
- You get rid of the clap.

1033
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,601
- That's very amusing, boys.

1034
01:27:43,879 --> 01:27:45,190
You two didn't really
think the company was

1035
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:48,193
just gonna forget about
Raven team, did you?

1036
01:27:48,193 --> 01:27:50,092
You made history
with your kill ratio.

1037
01:27:51,162 --> 01:27:54,027
Now, come on,
mercenaries can't quit.

1038
01:27:54,027 --> 01:27:55,615
It just doesn't happen that way.

1039
01:27:58,549 --> 01:28:00,827
You were easy to
keep tabs on, Grant.

1040
01:28:00,827 --> 01:28:02,277
- Fuck you, Bill.

1041
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,382
I wouldn't exactly call a
year of deep cover work easy,

1042
01:28:04,382 --> 01:28:06,246
especially living with this guy.

1043
01:28:06,246 --> 01:28:07,903
He's a fucking nut!

1044
01:28:07,903 --> 01:28:09,939
- I told you, she's a bitch.

1045
01:28:11,113 --> 01:28:13,736
- You know, I don't
get guys like you.

1046
01:28:13,736 --> 01:28:16,877
They sent me in to
gain your trust.

1047
01:28:16,877 --> 01:28:19,017
They thought you'd be
tough to get close to.

1048
01:28:19,915 --> 01:28:21,572
What a no-brainer.

1049
01:28:22,435 --> 01:28:24,575
- What took you so long, Cali?

1050
01:28:24,575 --> 01:28:26,887
Why didn't you just kill
me when you found me?

1051
01:28:28,233 --> 01:28:29,200
- Oh, you know the
answer to that one, Greg.

1052
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,995
You two have something we want.

1053
01:28:30,995 --> 01:28:33,722
Your last mission was to
obtain a Soviet 666 codebreaker

1054
01:28:33,722 --> 01:28:36,932
for Washington, but somehow
Washington never got it.

1055
01:28:36,932 --> 01:28:38,382
- Washington was
never gonna get it,

1056
01:28:38,382 --> 01:28:41,143
were they, Billy Gilley?

1057
01:28:41,143 --> 01:28:43,973
I wanna introduce you to the
man behind the Raven team.

1058
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:49,738
As a planner of
covert operations,
no one can touch you.

1059
01:28:49,738 --> 01:28:52,016
As a human being,
nobody wants to.

1060
01:28:52,016 --> 01:28:52,948
- And thanks to
you, Katz, the last

1061
01:28:52,948 --> 01:28:54,743
surviving member of Four Star.

1062
01:28:54,743 --> 01:28:55,882
- What does that make you?

1063
01:28:55,882 --> 01:28:58,022
The Lone Star?

1064
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:01,784
- We want the device, Grant.

1065
01:29:01,784 --> 01:29:06,064
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1066
01:29:06,064 --> 01:29:07,514
- I remember somewhere
somebody told me

1067
01:29:07,514 --> 01:29:12,347
that if you don't have both
devices, it's not worth a shit.

1068
01:29:13,486 --> 01:29:15,142
- Well, that's too bad
because I destroyed it.

1069
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:16,109
- No, you didn't.

1070
01:29:17,731 --> 01:29:20,527
- I smashed that piece
of shit in 1000 pieces.

1071
01:29:21,908 --> 01:29:25,290
- That was a $50 million device.

1072
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,740
- It's worth a
lot more than that

1073
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:29,364
on the international market,
isn't it, Billy Gilley?

1074
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,606
- Shut up!

1075
01:29:35,853 --> 01:29:38,856
Now, tell me the truth,
Grant, and I'll let you live.

1076
01:29:46,795 --> 01:29:48,624
I told you to shut up.

1077
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:54,596
Now, where is it, Grant?

1078
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:59,704
Would you like me
to shoot him again.

1079
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,612
- Okay, you can have it.

1080
01:30:10,612 --> 01:30:13,166
It's in my duffle bag
in the back of my truck.

1081
01:30:16,307 --> 01:30:17,481
- Smart decision, Grant.

1082
01:30:21,139 --> 01:30:23,348
See, Cali, he isn't as
dumb as you said he was.

1083
01:30:26,248 --> 01:30:27,732
Watch them closely.

1084
01:31:07,427 --> 01:31:08,255
Kill them.

1085
01:31:17,092 --> 01:31:18,473
- Separate the two, guys.

1086
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,336
Johnny, takes the
cuffs off of him.

1087
01:31:20,336 --> 01:31:22,304
Make it look like
they shot each other.

1088
01:31:53,059 --> 01:31:53,853
- Come on.

1089
01:31:56,787 --> 01:31:58,720
Ah shit, Raven, it's
just a flesh wound.

1090
01:32:03,725 --> 01:32:07,798
- Well, you did good, Deuce,
but we both got screwed.

1091
01:32:07,798 --> 01:32:08,626
- No, we didn't.

1092
01:32:10,248 --> 01:32:11,077
They did.

1093
01:32:30,717 --> 01:32:31,546
- Yeah.

1094
01:32:33,237 --> 01:32:35,032
Was that meant for me?

1095
01:32:35,032 --> 01:32:38,242
Makes you
wonder, don't it?

1096
01:32:38,242 --> 01:32:39,519
- No, whatever.
