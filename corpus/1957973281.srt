will not smoke anymore on school campus.

- Ms. Lehua,

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
this is not the first time
she's been in my office.

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,280

first time for this.

Mr. Taketa, please.

108
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,930
- Of what?

109
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,860
- Of Hawaii.

110
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,690
A little different than the postcards, no?

111
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,023
- Oh, you could say that.

112
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:17,350
- I will, it's a little
different than the postcards.

114
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,210
Hey, you want some advice?

115
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,760
Don't do that, especially around me.

116
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,720
- Do what?

117
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,670
- Look around like that, bruh.

118
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,170
- Why not?

119
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,240
- Because the locals, they
think you're challenging them

120
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,260
if you look 'em in the eye.

121
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,270
- Really?
- Really.

122
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,740
- What else?

123
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,690
- Well, you know that guy this
morning in the parking lot?

124
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,160
The one that got beat up?

125
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,493
All he did was say this one
local walked like he was real.

126
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,890
Some cousin heard it in passing.

127
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,600
Jacob got the crap beat at him.

128
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,250
- By that big dude with no neck.

129
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,390
- Shut the hell up, man.

130
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,950
I'm telling you serious.

131
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,230
- Well, what about the beaches?

132
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,070
- No way, bruh.

133
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,170
They're way worse than here.

134
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,040
- If you want to go to the beach,

135
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,840
you gotta use the one by the hotel.

136
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,210
Don't even think about
going to one in town.

137
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,043
- Why?

138
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:12,090
- Because if the waves don't
kick your ass, the locals will.

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,240
- Well, you know, maybe
we could study sometime

186
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,463
because I know a lot of Hawaiian words.

187
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,010
- That would be good.

188
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,450
- Okay.

189
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,430
All right then, so I'll see you later.

190
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

191
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,033
- Bye.

192
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:48,750
- [Aku] What's up?

193
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,583
What's up, haole?

194
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,201
Come on, try and take me, bruh.

195
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,034
Come on, come on.

196
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:53,850
- No, dude, I'm not
trying to start anything.

197
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,280
- You already started something, dude.

198
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,113
You think you're good enough

199
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:58,880
for one killer local girl like Lehua?

200
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,783
- Huh, come on, haole
boy, what you got, huh?

201
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,830
- Hey, Aku, what's up?

202
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,663
- Nothing, Zulu.

203
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:08,160
This skinny haole boy is causing trouble.

204
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,567
- Oh, go easy, bruh.

205
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,910
Even haole's gotta piss.

206
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,990
- Look dude, I'm not-

207
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,140
- What's that haole boy?

208
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,111
You got something to say, huh?

209
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:17,460
Huh, you got something to say?

210
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,963
- He's got nothing to say.

211
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:23,302
(speaks in foreign
language) Enough already.

212
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:25,084
- You watch your step, haole boy.

213
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,233
You watch it.

214
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,825
(Zulu sighs)

215
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:36,870
- Aku is like the volcano, bruh.

216
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,460
Very pissed off.

217
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,233
- I guess he is a little angry.

218
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,603
- A little angry.

219
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,390
- You're Zulu, right?

220
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,650
- Right.

221
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,483
- Thanks, Zulu.

222
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,530
I think you just saved me

223
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,843
from getting my ass kicked in a major way.

224
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,723
- It's all right, Mark Thompson.

Hey.

- What are you doing here?

256
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,730
- I came to see my brother.

257
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,410
- He's in the hospital.

258
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,760
- He's the guy that you
pulled outta the water.

259
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,660
- You're kidding.

260
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,280
How weird.

261
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,113
- I know.

262
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,260
- Well, how is he anyway?

263
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,280
- He's doing okay.

264
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,112
He's like sleeping and
snoring really loud. (laughs)

265
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:19,620
- (laughs) That's good I guess.

266
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,520
- That's it, check out the front desk.

267
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,060
- Hey, Mark.

268
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,123
He's not gonna remember
what happened, but I will.

269
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,723
And I just wanna thank
you from both of us.

270
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,393
- Well, thanks.

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,320
Hey, hey.

Oh.

- This is Ronnie Boy and Keao.

276
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,700
- Mark Thompson.

277
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,753
- From California.

278
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,543
- Hey, you remembered.

279
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:56,700
- Hey, how'd you know
how to do that stuff?

280
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,720
- Do what?

281
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,100
- You a lifeguard or something?

282
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,600
- Yeah, like a "Baywatch".

283
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,500
- Me?

284
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,860
No, I took a class once in CPR.

285
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,720
I guess I just kind of remembered.

286
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,550
- Let me ask you something.

287
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,669
How'd you kiss that big
tuna fish on the lips?

288
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:12,379
(group laughing)

289
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:14,910
- Well, it wasn't easy, let me tell you.

290
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,390
I just pretended I was
kissing Pamela Anderson.

291
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,860
- Who's that?

292
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,613
- You know the girl on
"Baywatch", the blonde.

293
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:29,909
- Oh.

294
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:32,850
(Ronnie laughing)

295
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,500
- You the guys that saved Judge Ali's son?

296
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,400
- Yeah, that's right we're the heroes.

297
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:38,733

298
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:42,316

(birds chirping)
(waves splashing)

300
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,613
- So how's school?

301
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,560
- Okay, I guess, it's only been a month.

302
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,090
- Uh-huh.

303
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,860
Mark, are you taking your pills?

304
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,510
- [Mark] Ma.

305
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,163
- Are you taking your pills?

306
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:24,945
(gentle music)

307
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:28,380
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

308
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,100
- These haole guys get captured
by these head hunter guys,

309
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,020
taken to this village,

310
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,270
except the head hunters
are cannibals, okay?

311
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,760
So they covered this one haole with mud,

312
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,120
stick on a spit and roast him haole style.

313
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,980
But the guy's still alive.

314
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,150
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,658
- Hey, so listen, they
take this other haole,

316
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:49,020
and they take all his clothes,

317
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,486
and then they 'em run.

318
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:53,757
So naked haole takes off running, huh?

319
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,100
They give him a head start
and then they chase him down.

320
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,140
But the guy catches the first two guys

321
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,190
and takes their spears.

322
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,023
- Is this a true story?

323
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:01,560
- No, it's a movie, bruh.

324
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,850
- What's it about?

325
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,684
- It's about these haoles

326
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,040
get captured by the African warriors,

327
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,603
and one of the haoles is stuck like a pig

328
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:09,933
and roasted on a fire.

329
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,207
- Cool.

330
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:14,707
(Mark laughs)

331
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,167

332
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,323
Thank you.

333
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,213
- Thanks, Tutu.
- Thanks, Tutu.

334
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,820
- Why do you call her Tuti?

335
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,710
- Not Tuti, you. (speaks
in foreign language)

336
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,940
Tutu.

337
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,770
- What everybody calls her, bruh.

338
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,970
Means grandma.

339
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,830
- Well, how am I supposed to know?

340
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,770
- Here, you can borrow this one.

341
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,910
- What do you mean?

342
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,020
- Said you wanted to surf, right?

343
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,870
- Oh, this is so rad.

344
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,689

Later he goes back to the same
bank and pays off his truck.

starts bragging about how
he got his truck for free.

All this time he is talking

406
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,840
So he gets busted and
now he's in shackles.

550
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,670
Although I haven't been accepted yet.

551
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,840
What about you guys?

552
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,940
- I'm gonna get a job.

553
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,730
My brother Kimo works at
a hotel, he can get me in.

554
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,780
- Construction business my father.

555
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,163
- If he ever comes back.

556
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,113
I'm gonna surf and smoke, bruh.

557
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,190
- Where are we anyway?

558
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,340
- This is Queen's Bath.

559
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,460
We call it that 'cause this is
where the alii used to bathe.

560
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,960
See that mountain right there?

561
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,113
It's Hualalai, the mountain that saves.

562
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,340
It's the only thing
between us and the volcano.

563
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,890
In the old days, it used
to keep the Hawaiian safe.

564
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,830
When they walked this side of the island

565
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,070
in the honor of the goddess Pele

566
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,070
not supposed to carry pork on the trail.

567
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,870
Even today, they still believe that.

568
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,240
- What'll happen if you carry pork across?

569
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,094
- Something bad will happen

570
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:51,844
or the Menehune gonna do something.

571
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,690
- What's that?

572
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,340
- Menehunes are these little people,

573
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,350
they live in the trees and the rocks.

574
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,460
When you're not looking

575
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,910
they take things from you or
do things that piss you off.

576
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,743
- Really?

577
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,450
- Look, there's one now.

578
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:12,510
(group laughing)
(upbeat music)

579
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,343

580

582
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,115
- Hey!

583
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,902
(rock thuds)
(Keao groans)

584
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:27,939
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

585
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:30,689
(group laughing)

586
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,916
- [Ronnie's Dad] Where is the beer, huh?

587
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:37,749
You bitch!

588
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:38,582
(glass shattering)

589
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:39,782
Better be here.

590
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:41,610
You better not be hiding him again.

591
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,552
I'll kick your fat ass.

592
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:45,325
- Later, bruh.

593
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:47,265
- [Ronnie's Dad] Oh,
you're gonna be sorry.

594
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:48,803
(glass shattering)

595
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,303
(dog barking)

596
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,940
(door clicks)

597
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,834
(door bangs)

598
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,806
(muffled rapping)

599
00:30:57,806 --> 00:30:59,556
- Hey baby, come sit.

600
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:01,620
(muffled rapping)

601
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,120
- No, mom got something to do.

602
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:07,036
(muffled rapping)

603
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:14,455
(muffled rapping)

604
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:19,465
(muffled rapping)

605
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:26,700
You and your low life
friends smoke my stash?

606
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,950
- Hey, hey, show a little respect.

607
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,783
- Respect?

608
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:30,690
Hey, go to hell!

609
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,223
- Hey.
- And you go with her.

610
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,300
Stay the hell outta my room.

611
00:31:36,707 --> 00:31:39,870
- Don't, don't worry, baby.

612
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,673
I'll get you some more.

613
00:31:41,673 --> 00:31:44,906

616
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,210
- [Lehua] Hey, Mark, it's Lehua.

617
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,043
Are you there?

618
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,053
I thought you were gonna meet me.

619
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:56,670
I mean, I'm used to Hawaiian
time, but this is ridiculous.

620
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,200
- Oh.

621
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,520
- [Lehua] Okay, I'll see you later.

622
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,884
(dial tone humming)

623
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:04,252

624
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:05,820
(phone ringing)

625
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,960
- [Ronnie's Dad] What, huh?

626
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,873
I'll take you on.

627
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:10,053
Think I'm afraid of you?

628
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:10,886
Ha.

629
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:13,765
(glass shattering)

630
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:18,015
(Tutu singing in foreign language)

631
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:21,474
Yeah, that's right.

632
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:23,393
I'll take you all on.

633
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:25,416
Come on, we go!

634
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:26,778
Come on, you bitch!

635
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,588
What, you want some
more, you want some more?

636

(wood thudding)

639
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:38,991
(Tutu singing in foreign language)

640
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,492
Come on!

641
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:41,667
Kick your ass!

642
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,102
What you scared?

643
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:45,421
You better be scared?

644
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,851
I'm gonna kill all of you!

645
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:48,851
That's right all of you!

646
00:32:53,716 --> 00:32:55,716
- Hey, Maile, come here.

647
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:57,894
Come on.

648
00:32:57,894 --> 00:32:58,893
I wanna ask you something.

649
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,250
Remember me from school?

650
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,843
- No, I don't, haole, boy.

651
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,710
- Well, I'm a friend
of your sisters Lehua.

652
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,543
I'm looking for her.

653
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:18,376
Do you know where she is?

654
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:19,870
- You know Lehua?

655
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,720
- Yeah, from school.

656
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,553
How you doing?

657
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,950
- Hey, look, haole.

658
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,783
- Mark.

659
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:28,170
Call me Mark.

660
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,220
- You're Mark?

661
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,770
- Yeah, I was supposed to pick
her up after dance rehearsal,

662
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,603
but I'm late.

663
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,220
- You're Mark?

664
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,960
- Yeah, why?

665
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,250
What'd she say about me?

666
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,083
- Nothing.

667
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,880
She didn't say nothing.

668
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,950
- Really nothing at all?

669
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,783
- Nope.

670
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,803
- Well, listen, tell her I stopped by.

671
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,043
Thanks, Maile.

672
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,503
Guess I'll see you later at school.

(truck engine revving)

674
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,403
- I know where Lehua might
be, but you gotta take us too.

675
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:28,522
(birds chirping)

676

(dog barking)

677
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,920
- Lehua's here?

678
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,333

706
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:29,040

707
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,120
- Johnny.

708
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,953
Bring me another beer.

709
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:31,786
Bring up for my friend too.

710
00:35:31,786 --> 00:35:33,220
- Oh.

711
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,887
(both laughing)

712
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,313

713
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,313
I'll talk to you later.

714
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,193
I gotta go.

721
00:36:28,092 --> 00:36:31,350
- Then an extraordinary thing happened.

722
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,800
King Kamehameha the Great died in 1819.

723
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,080
Now the new king, Liholiho

724
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,860
and two of Kamehameha wives
openly broke the kapu system

725
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,740
by eating together at a formal feast.

726
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,870
They were supported in
their actions by Hewahewa,

727
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,090
the highest kahuna nui in the land.

728
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,780
Now, Hewahewa was the one who actually

729
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,280
torched the first heiau,

730
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,850
the sacred altar used
for human sacrifices.

731
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,030
The Hawaiians had had
enough cruelty and evil.

732
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,863
As a matter of fact,

733
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:03,810
this was six months before
the first missionaries arrive.

734
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,800
- [Mark] What?

735
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,314
- Zulu, see me after class.

736
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:09,981
(Ronnie laughs)

737
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,393
Zulu, come here.

738
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,483
Come.

739
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,973
This is some information about
a class I'm teaching tonight.

740
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,560
It's to help parents and
students fill out applications

741
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,400
and prepare for the SATs, the
scholastic aptitude tests.

742
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,290
- I don't need an aptitude test.

743
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,090
- You do if you're going to college.

744
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:44,969
(traffic humming)

745
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,709
(water rippling)

746
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:52,209
(door clicks)

747
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,340
(door bangs)

748
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,523
- Mark, I wanted to talk to you all day.

749
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,743
I know what happened and I know
why you got hurt last night.

750
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,650
I may have led you on and I'm sorry.

751
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,150
But the truth is, is that
I wanted the same thing,

752
00:38:15,435 --> 00:38:16,268
(gentle brooding music)

753
00:38:16,268 --> 00:38:17,460
but everything's different.

754
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,050
And so much has changed now.

755
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,970
Most of all, I want us to be friends.

756
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,370
And you don't have to answer me now,

757
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,833
but promise me that you'll think about it.

758
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,503
Please.

759
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,133
- So I'll see you afterwards, yeah?

760
00:38:41,164 --> 00:38:41,997
- Okay.

761
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:49,714
Lehua.

762
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:50,547
- Yeah.

763
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:04,822
(slow drum music)

764
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:09,155
(group singing in foreign language)

765
00:39:10,376 --> 00:39:14,709
(group singing in foreign language)

766
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:18,990
- We welcome you with our warmest aloha

767
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,283
to our land Hawaii.

768
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,713
Beloved to its people.

769
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,723
Priceless is its beauty from
the mountains to the sea.

770
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,833
Beauty captivating the hearts
of those who behold her.

771
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,343
This is our land Hawaii.

772
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,443
Beloved to its people.

773
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,333
- Cool.

774
00:39:42,237 --> 00:39:43,770
- See those guys on the other side?

775
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,453
- Yeah.
- Those are my brothers.

776
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,936
Alan and Sam.

777
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:50,958
- Yeah, they look like you.

778
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,535
- Yeah, handsome you mean.

779
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:53,368
- Exactly.

780
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,380
So I learned about the different tests

781
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,330
and what to say on the applications.

782
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,220
- I can't believe you kept this a secret.

783
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,230
- It's not a secret, bruh.

784
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,230
Just wanted to see if I liked it or not.

785
00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:08,622
Hey, you guys, this is the guy.

786
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:09,622
- Hey.
- Hey.

787
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,210
- Mark.

788
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,739
- Welcome, welcome.

789
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:14,939
- Nice to meet you, man.

790
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:19,230
(group laughing)

791
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,640
Cool.

792
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,110
Hey, is that you?

793
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,397
- [Zulu] Yeah, me, Ronnie Boy, and Keao.

794
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:25,489
- You kidding?

795
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,239
(group laughing)

796
00:40:30,582 --> 00:40:32,249
- Hey, haole, haole.

797
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,490
Hey, shh.

798
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,770
My mom over here, my tutu, and my papa.

799
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,670
This is Mark.

800
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,503
- Aloha, Mark.

801
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,303
- Hi, Mark.
- Boys, sit down.

802
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,083
Alan, (speaks in foreign
language) call prayer, please.

803
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,610
- Dear Lord, thank you for this
food and everything we have.

804
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,320
We are truly grateful.

805
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,900
Please help Kimo get the
promotion he is up for.

806
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,800
And please help Zulu get into college.

807
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,300
Mahalo and amen.

808
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,631
- Amen.
- Amen.

809
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,798
- Amen.
- Amen.

810
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,383
(group cheering)

811
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:15,133
(hands slapping)

812
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,768
- Hey, never mind, pass the opakapaka.

813
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:23,685
(group chattering)

814
00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:27,270
- [Mark] What is this?

815
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,830
- You gonna try this stuff
right here, it's poi, bruh.

816
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,663
- What's this?

817
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:30,809
- Poi.
- Poi?

818
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:32,082
- Just eat it.

819
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,365
- Just eat it, okay.

820
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,899
- It's fine, bruh.

821
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:36,003
- It's purple.

822
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,871
(Zulu laughs)

823
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:42,204
(group singing in foreign language)

824
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:51,134
(group singing in foreign language)

825
00:41:57,112 --> 00:41:59,292
(group singing in foreign language)

826
00:41:59,292 --> 00:42:04,292
(birds chirping)
(group chattering)

827
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:09,992
- Zulu.

828
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,750
You enjoy that sermon?

829
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,583
- Yeah.

830
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,100
Not bad.

831
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,510
A little long though.

832
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,610
- Kinda long.
- Yeah.

833
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:24,843
Hey, Mr. Kaneko.

834
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:27,193
- Yeah, Zulu.

835
00:42:27,193 --> 00:42:29,943
- I just wanna thank you,
uh, for what you did for me.

836
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,190
You know, telling me about the class.

837
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,628
- You're welcome.

838
00:42:35,628 --> 00:42:37,378
I was happy to do it.

839
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,690
My boss is calling, I gotta go.

840
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,801
You take care.

841
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:45,134
- Aloha.
- Aloha.

842
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:46,994
Yeah.

843
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:51,784
(knuckles tapping)

844
00:42:54,054 --> 00:42:55,080
(door clicks)

845
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,533
- Hi guys.
- Hi, Mrs. Thompson.

846
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,730
- Listen, this is the last
time I'm gonna tell you,

847
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,010
Mrs. Thompson is my ex-mother-in-law.

848
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,220
I'm Bonnie, okay?

849
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,070
- Okay, Bonnie.
- Okay.

850
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,180
Listen, Mark's almost ready.

851
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,780
Go in and make yourself at home.

852
00:43:09,578 --> 00:43:11,995
(door bangs)

853
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,073
- Oh yeah.

854
00:43:20,256 --> 00:43:23,673
(laughs) Hey, come here.

855
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,867
Hey look.

856
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:28,700
- [Ronnie] Who's that, bruh?

857
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,790
- Hey, hey, hey.

858
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,390
What about Paulina, she know I'm butch.

859
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,554
- Bruh, what is this all
you can talk about now?

860
00:43:33,554 --> 00:43:34,387
(floor rattling)

861
00:43:34,387 --> 00:43:36,086
- Shh, shh, shh.

862
00:43:36,086 --> 00:43:36,919
- What?

863
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,203
What is it?

864
00:43:49,054 --> 00:43:51,554
(door clicks)

865
00:43:54,556 --> 00:43:57,180
(suspenseful music)

866
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,630
Hey, maybe we should-
- Shh.

867
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:02,151
- [Ronnie] Mark?

868
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,204
Mark?

869
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:25,817
Zulu, Zulu, call 911!

870
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,750
- What's happening to him?

871
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,900
Bruh, I think he's dying.

872
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,763
Look at him, look at him.

873
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,443
- Bruh, they're on their way.

874
00:44:56,423 --> 00:44:59,256
(waves splashing)

875
00:45:00,235 --> 00:45:05,235
(birds chirping)
(brooding music)

876
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,580
- Ma'am, is this your son?

877
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,900
- Yes.
- Well, it seems that

878
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,700
he suffered some sort of seizure.

879
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,053
- Mark's an epileptic.

880
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,073
He's been out there all day.

881
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,970
I told him you were okay,

882
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,920
but I don't think he wants to
hear it from anybody but you.

883
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:01,384
(gentle music)

884
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,720
- It's really not as bad as it seems.

885
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,193
I've had it all my life.

886
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,190
I have these pills I take.

887
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,133
If I take the pills, I
don't have the seizures.

888
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,670
However, the pills make
me really, really tired,

889
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,323
so sometimes I don't take them.

890
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,683
It's a lifelong thing.

891
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,223
Forever.

892
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,673
- Bruh, you should have told me.

893
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,103
- I'm sorry.

894
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,953
I have trouble telling people.

895
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,090
I don't want people to
treat me any different.

896
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,980
I didn't mean to scare you.

897
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,650
- (laughs) I wasn't scared.

898
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,480
Keao was scared, not me.

899
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,709
- (laughs) I'll bet.

900
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:15,466
(Ronnie laughs)

901
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:16,695
(hand slaps)

902
00:47:16,695 --> 00:47:18,366
(fast tempo drum music)

903
00:47:18,366 --> 00:47:23,366

00:47:58,294 --> 00:48:02,627
(Lehua singing in foreign language)

00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:08,473
(Lehua singing in foreign language)

912
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:11,223
(group clapping)

913
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:23,772

(fire roaring)

914
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:31,164
Hey.

915
00:48:31,164 --> 00:48:31,997
Look at you.

916
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:34,230
- Bruh, I'm sound man.

917
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:36,330
- No.
- You guys were great.

918
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,680
- Thanks.

919
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,260
Although I don't think
anybody really cared.

920
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,463
- Ah, what do they know?

921
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:48,210
- (laughs) Hey.

922
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,563
- Hey, where's Ronnie?

923
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:53,310
- I don't know, he's
around here somewhere.

924
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,332
- Hey, don't touch a
valuable merchandise, okay?

925
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,820
- What is this?
- Hey, hey.

926
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,310
- Hey, Zulu, will you watching stuff?

927
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,080
Lehua and I are gonna get a drink?

928
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,619
- Yeah, okay, boss.

929
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:05,970
(Mark laughs)
(flames roaring)

930
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:06,803
- Are you feeling okay?

931
00:49:06,803 --> 00:49:08,343
- I'm not feeling too good.

932
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,070
- You still want something to drink?

933
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:12,470
- I need to find a bathroom.

934
00:49:17,902 --> 00:49:20,340
(ominous music)

935
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,450
- Aloha, sir.

936
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,723
Might I interest you in a piece
of aji tuna or yellow tail?

937
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,753
Aji's said to be an aphrodisiac.

938
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,920
Hey, you know, it just might help you

939
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,358
in your quest to pop Lehua. (laughs)

940
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:37,121
(tray thudding)

941
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:38,608
- What's up?
- Hey!

942
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:39,447
Cut that out!

943
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:41,243
- What you want some too, huh?

944
00:49:41,243 --> 00:49:42,843
- What is going on here?

945
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,970
- Nothing, sir.

946
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:48,810
- Nothing, you, you, you're fired.

947
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:49,643
Get out.

948
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,003
Get out.

949
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:04,650
Now I'm gonna have to get
somebody to clean up this mess.

950
00:50:06,238 --> 00:50:08,525
(Ronnie laughs)

951
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:10,921
- Bruh, I can't believe you hit his tray.

952
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:11,921
- Me either.

953
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:16,528
(bell ringing)

954
00:50:16,528 --> 00:50:21,195
- [Announcer] Okay, break is
over, back to class please.

955
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,824

956

959

- Go, go!

960
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:47,216

1014
00:53:54,455 --> 00:53:55,685
- What?

1015
00:53:55,685 --> 00:53:56,650
- Mark, get off!

1016
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,690
- No way.

1017
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,340
- Mark, you're on Heiau.

1018
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,173
- So?

1019
00:54:00,173 --> 00:54:01,231
Heiau, Heiau.

1020
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,240
- So it's sacred ground.

1021
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,323
No haole's allowed.

1022
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:07,740
- Oh, what'll happen to me?

1023
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,510
- Mark, get down before I pound your face.

1024
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,073
- Oh, you and what army?

1025
00:54:12,557 --> 00:54:15,028
(Mark groaning)

1026
00:54:15,028 --> 00:54:17,738
- Ronnie, get off him.

1027
00:54:17,738 --> 00:54:19,321
Ronnie, let him go.

1028
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:23,940
(foot thuds)
(Mark groaning)

1029
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,210
Ronnie, what's the matter with you?

1030
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,310
I told you to get off.

1031
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,640
- Who died and made you king?

1032
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,406
What's your problem, you psycho?

1033
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:35,456
- Stupid haoles like you with no respect.

1034
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:38,856
- Bruh, you know sacred ground, okay?

1035
00:54:38,856 --> 00:54:40,440
- Yeah, what are you defending him for?

1036
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,090
You should be on my side not his.

1037
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,873
- Not on anybody's side, Ronnie.

1038
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,563
- Fine, ever since he's
been here, you've changed.

1039
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,130
He's the one of putting
crazy ideas into your head.

1040
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,360
- You're the one who's crazy.

1041
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,160
- What ideas, bruh?

1042
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,750
- Like going to college.

1043
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,310
- I didn't have anything to do with that.

1044
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,650
I didn't find out until you did.

1045
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,020
- Yeah, but he never would've
done it if it weren't for you.

1046
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,700
- It's not my fault.

1047
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,710
Besides what do you care
if he goes to school?

1048
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,605
It's none of your business.

1049
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:11,310
- Typical haole attitude.

1050
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:14,871
Do what you want and to hell
with everybody else, yeah?

1051
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:16,457
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

1052
00:55:16,457 --> 00:55:18,796
- I know one thing.

1053
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:23,796
You're always gonna be a haole.

1054
00:55:28,118 --> 00:55:30,618
(dog barking)

1055
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,570
- Hey, how's it?

1056
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:31,830
- Hey.

1057
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,960
- Listen, Ronnie Boy
gets mad sometimes and-

1058
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,037
- I don't wanna talk about him.

1059
00:56:36,037 --> 00:56:38,475
- Okay, okay, we won't talk about him.

1060
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:41,430
Hey, listen bruh, you want
to go run an errand with me?

1061
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,443
It'll be fun, promise.

1062
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,533
- Okay, get in.

1063
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:55,530
Let me ask you something,
what do you think about Lehua?

1064
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:56,940
- What do you mean?

1065
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,830
Like do I like her or something?

1066
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,630
- Well, you've known her
for a long time, right?

1067
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,000
- Yeah, since third grade.

1068
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,610
- Well, do you think she'd, I don't know.

1069
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,530
- Oh, you like her or something?

1070
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,880
- Well, yeah.

1071
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,400
It's just, I don't know if she likes me.

1072
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,690
- [Keao] She does.

1073
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:13,860
- What do you mean?

1074
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,760
- She told me.

1075
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,960
We talk all the time.

1076
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,043
At least once a week.

1077
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,530
- Well, what'd she say?

1078
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,903
- I don't know nothing specific.

1079
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,000
- Really?

1080
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,230
But what'd she say?

1081
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,940
- I just told you.

1082
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,842
- Oh man, I don't believe it.

1083
00:57:28,842 --> 00:57:29,675
- Shh.

1084
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,860
- What is it?

1085
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,050
- No more talking, bruh, okay?

1086
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,739
Be right back.

1087
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:38,406
(ominous music)

1088
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,310
Bruh, Yellow Bob.

1089
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,415
- Is that pot?

1090
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,248
(Keao laughs)

1091
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,567
(gun bangs)
(suspenseful music)

I'm sick of you and your drugs.

1122
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,640

now, haole boy, is that it?

I don't need no lectures.

1125

1127
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,280
Ronnie's right.

1128

All you haoles, you're the same.

1129
01:00:09,507 --> 01:00:11,070
All you guys can think about is yourself.

1130
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,180
- You and Ronnie are so quick

1131
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,500
to blame the haoles for everything.

1132
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,760
Have you ever thought that your problems

1133
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,170
are your own damn fault?

1134
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,370
You're so naive.

1135
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,403

1136
01:00:18,403 --> 01:00:19,530
I never liked you anyway.

1137
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:20,460
Oh that's right.

1138
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,410
The only reason we hang with
you 'cause you got a truck.

1139
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,610
You're the one who's naive.

1140
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,730
- Why because I won't risk my
life for some stupid drugs?

1141
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,080
- You don't know anything.

1142
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,390
Oh, what you think Lehua is just fat.

1143

01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:51,250
- Yo, let go!

1272
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:55,203
- Come on, let's go.

1273
01:07:56,849 --> 01:07:59,764
(truck door clicks)

1274
01:07:59,764 --> 01:08:02,681
(truck door bangs)

1275
01:08:15,153 --> 01:08:15,986
(group chattering)

1276
01:08:15,986 --> 01:08:18,120
- As we approach the
end of the school year,

1277
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,300
I feel an obligation to
teach you a few things

1278
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:24,540
that might actually be useful to you.

1279
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,250
Although you have to
promise not to tell anyone

1280
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,550
on the school board, okay?

1281
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,720
This whole semester
we've been talking about

1282
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,870
the true Hawaiian and the true Hawaii.

1283
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:35,100
Well, I've got some personal beliefs

1284
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,630
I'd like to share with you.

1285
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:39,480
And that is, there's
only one race of people

1286
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,050
on God's green earth, the human race.

1287
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:46,350
And I think it's stupid
to divide us by race

1288
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,439
because we're all related, yeah.

1289
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:52,606
(man singing in foreign language)

1290
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,431

1296
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:20,325
(dog barking)
(water bubbling)

1297
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,650
- [Friend] So cute.

1298
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,086
- [Zulu] What's up, mama?

1299
01:09:27,086 --> 01:09:27,919
- Hey.

1300
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:32,220
- Hey, Mark.

1301
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,510
- Hey.

1302
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:34,800
You talk to Keao?

1303
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,210
- Nope.

1304
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,210
He won't talk to me.

1305
01:09:38,214 --> 01:09:39,690
He won't talk to anyone.

1306
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:40,950
- Why not?

1307
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:41,783
- Don't know.

1308
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,965
- So that's it, he's just dropping out.

1309
01:09:44,965 --> 01:09:46,327
- Don't know.

1310
01:09:46,327 --> 01:09:48,033
- You don't seem too worried.

1311
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:51,200
- He always comes back, bruh.

1312
01:10:01,556 --> 01:10:03,889

(Ronnie's Dad yelling)

1322
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,281
- [Ronnie's Dad] Can't find
nothing around this dump!

1323
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:57,864
I said clean it up!

1324
01:11:59,404 --> 01:12:01,169
What, you deaf?

1325
01:12:01,169 --> 01:12:03,402
Look in here, clean this bitch!

1326
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,945
(hand slaps)

(surf board thuds)

1334
01:13:19,473 --> 01:13:21,000
- Mom, let me see.

1335
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,053
He hit you again?

1336
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,023
- I told her not to marry him.

1337
01:13:26,404 --> 01:13:29,404
(suspenseful music)

1338
01:13:30,628 --> 01:13:31,559
(Ronnie grunting)

1339
01:13:31,559 --> 01:13:34,059
(board thuds)

1340
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:41,928
- Then on January 17th, 1893,

1341
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:48,150
a group of businessmen backed
by former sons of missionaries

1342
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:52,530
and the US Marines overthrew
Queen Lili'uokalani.

1343
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:55,080
They put her in a room in her own palace.

1344
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,500
And that's where she wrote
the famous Queen's Prayer.

1345
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,970
Zulu, what is it?

1346
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:02,010
- This is the application.

1347
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:03,180
I need a letter to go with it.

1348
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,190
- When's the letter due?

1349
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,600
- The 14th.

1350
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,890
- And what's today's date?

1351
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:09,810
- June 2nd.

1352
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,090
- Which means that I've got about 12 days

1353
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,590
to write the letter.

1354
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:15,030
- Yes, sir.

1355
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:16,563
- Zulu, it shall be done.

1356
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:20,070
- Yeah, thanks, Mr. Kaneko.

1357
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:21,480
Hey, sorry.

Excuse me.

1363
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,452
Hey, we're your haole boyfriend, bruh?

I saw you laugh.

- I didn't.

1409
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,573

Zuli said, "He won't see anybody

1416

and he is not taking any calls."

I feel really bad.

1419

But you know you got a lot to do today.

1420
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:25,803
You gotta graduate.

1421
01:18:27,183 --> 01:18:28,434
Ugh.

1422
01:18:28,434 --> 01:18:30,210
- I don't know if I can go.

1423
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,593
I just don't feel like it.

1424
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:35,220
- You don't get it, do you?

1425
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:40,413
You are going, we're going together.

1426
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:43,943

(both laughing)

1428
01:18:52,135 --> 01:18:54,610
- I told you I don't feel like it.

1429
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:57,750
- Mark, don't be so selfish.

1430
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,370
Come on, do it for Bonnie.

1431
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:00,240
It means a lot to her.

1432
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,073
Come on.

1433
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:03,803

Look at you.

You look so cute.

(Lehua and Mark laughing)

1437
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:13,763

- Baby.

1442
01:19:22,851 --> 01:19:23,684

1443
01:19:23,684 --> 01:19:24,517
- The baby.
- What?

1444
01:19:24,517 --> 01:19:26,100
- Mark, I'm scared.

1445
01:19:47,634 --> 01:19:50,884
(upbeat ukulele music)

1446
01:19:52,365 --> 01:19:53,452

1447
01:19:53,452 --> 01:19:55,656
This is the hospital.

(group laughing)

1452
01:20:16,809 --> 01:20:18,642
- Quiet please, quiet.

1453
01:20:20,866 --> 01:20:23,449
(gentle music)

1454
01:20:26,439 --> 01:20:29,836
(machine beeping)

1455
01:20:29,836 --> 01:20:33,007
(Mark groans)

1456
01:20:33,007 --> 01:20:34,174
- [Lehua] Hey.

1457
01:20:35,389 --> 01:20:36,993
- Hey.

1458
01:20:36,993 --> 01:20:38,859
(Lehua groans)

1459
01:20:38,859 --> 01:20:42,689
- Tell me everything's okay.

1460
01:20:42,689 --> 01:20:44,356
- Everything's okay.

1461
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:47,520
(Lehua panting)

1462
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,020
Hey.

1463
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,763
It's okay, the baby's fine.

1464
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,680
- I'm so glad you were here.

1465
01:20:56,545 --> 01:20:57,378
- Me too.

1466
01:20:59,971 --> 01:21:02,804
(chains clanging)

1467
01:21:15,428 --> 01:21:17,928
(door clicks)

1468
01:21:23,618 --> 01:21:26,035
(door bangs)

1469
01:21:36,127 --> 01:21:36,960
Hey.

1470
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:44,280
Look, I'm sorry to trick you,

1471
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,683
but I wanted to see you before I left.

1472
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,450
- How'd you get in here?

1473
01:21:52,349 --> 01:21:54,963
- Lehua's father pulled
a few strings for me.

1474
01:21:57,362 --> 01:22:01,247
He says he owes me, calls me
the lifesaver of his children.

1475
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:05,663
- How is she?

1476
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:08,344
Lehua.

1477
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,633
- Good.

1478
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,313
The baby's fine.

1479
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,073
Very small but cute.

1480
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,740
She was in an incubator for a while,

1481
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,123
but everything's okay now.

1482
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:25,830
- What's her name?

1483
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:29,310
- Oh, you'll like this.

1484
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:32,733
Lilly named after Queen Lili'uokalani.

1485
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:36,364
(gentle music)

1486
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:38,813
- So what?

1487
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,520
Are you going to mainland now?

1488
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,203
- Uh, yeah.

1489
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,970
I got into school, believe it or not.

1490
01:22:52,783 --> 01:22:56,280
- I believe it, bruh.

1491
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,513
- We'll see how it goes.

1492
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,663
But I'm coming home for Christmas.

1493
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:12,360
Look, Ronnie, I wanted to apologize

1494
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,950
for saying all the things that I did

1495
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:15,540
and acting like an idiot.

1496
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:16,563
- That was my fault.

1497
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:24,570
I'm sorry for choking you at Waipi'o.

1498
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:26,613
- Ronnie, I-
- Let me finish.

1499
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,170
Sorry for choking you at Waipi'o,

1500
01:23:33,297 --> 01:23:34,713
and for hitting you.

1501
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:40,593
I, I didn't mean it, bruh.

1502
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,043
I don't wanna be like my father.

1503
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,230
- I don't want to be
like my father either.

1504
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,210
- So what's that?

1505
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:05,453
- This.

1506
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:10,383
It's a video I made.

1507
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:13,563
I gave one to Zulu and Keao.

1508
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:16,173
Sort of a gift.

1509
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:23,183
- For what?

1510
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:28,107
- Just a gift from your
haole friend, okay?

1511
01:24:31,263 --> 01:24:33,794
(Ronnie chuckles)

1512
01:24:33,794 --> 01:24:34,627
- Okay.

1513
01:24:35,992 --> 01:24:38,659

1514
01:24:54,483 --> 01:24:57,233
