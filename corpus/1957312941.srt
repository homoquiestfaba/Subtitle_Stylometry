2216
01:39:12,644 --> 01:39:16,182
<i>He is, of course,
Mr. Alan McGee.</i>

2217
01:39:16,215 --> 01:39:18,151
And roll VT.

2218
01:39:18,184 --> 01:39:19,419
ALAN: Beaming lights.

2219
01:39:19,452 --> 01:39:21,353
PRESENTER: Alan McGee,
the man with a masterplan,

2220
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:24,291
whose Creation Records
went supersonic

2221
01:39:24,323 --> 01:39:28,960
by taking him from Brit Rail
employee to Britpop president.

2222
01:39:28,995 --> 01:39:30,196
But some might say he went from

2223
01:39:30,229 --> 01:39:32,397
rolling with it
to rolling in it,

2224
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:36,036
by selling his shares
little by little to Sony

2225
01:39:36,068 --> 01:39:37,669
before collapsing the label.

2226
01:39:37,703 --> 01:39:40,105
- Did he slide away?
- Whoa, wait a minute, whoa.

2227
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:41,206
Is this a stitch-up?

2228
01:39:41,241 --> 01:39:42,408
PRESENTER: Leaving
the bands all around

2229
01:39:42,442 --> 01:39:43,676
- the world without contracts.
- What is that?

2230
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:45,310
- No.
- What is your first question?

2231
01:39:45,345 --> 01:39:47,247
PRESENTER:
One thing's for sure.

2232
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:50,317
Creation Records didn't live
forever, know what I mean?

2233
01:39:50,349 --> 01:39:52,785
Stop that racket.

2234
01:39:52,818 --> 01:39:56,022
You can edit it in afterwards.
What's your first question?

2235
01:39:56,054 --> 01:39:58,924
Uh, what
happened with Creation?

2236
01:39:58,957 --> 01:40:00,359
Why did you shut it down?

2237
01:40:05,598 --> 01:40:07,100
It was mine.

2238
01:40:07,132 --> 01:40:09,102
I made it. I folded it.

2239
01:40:09,135 --> 01:40:10,236
No one got hurt.

2240
01:40:10,269 --> 01:40:12,871
Most of the bands
got re-signed to Sony.

2241
01:40:12,904 --> 01:40:14,741
We didn't need Creation anymore.

2242
01:40:14,773 --> 01:40:16,975
Yeah, but why kill it?

2243
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:18,812
It doesn't make any sense.

2244
01:40:18,845 --> 01:40:19,913
Why not?

2245
01:40:19,946 --> 01:40:23,116
Look, I built the biggest
independent record company

2246
01:40:23,148 --> 01:40:24,783
out of nothing.

2247
01:40:24,817 --> 01:40:28,020
I discovered and signed
the world's biggest act,

2248
01:40:28,054 --> 01:40:31,190
and reignited a record industry
I was told was dying.

2249
01:40:31,224 --> 01:40:35,362
CD sales went up 800%
between '89 and '99

2250
01:40:35,394 --> 01:40:36,495
with me on the charts.

2251
01:40:36,528 --> 01:40:38,931
And overseas sales
made the UK more money

2252
01:40:38,965 --> 01:40:40,033
than the motor industry.

2253
01:40:40,065 --> 01:40:42,602
My bands did that,
and everyone else,

2254
01:40:42,635 --> 01:40:45,705
Pulp, Blur, Radiohead,
benefitted.

2255
01:40:45,737 --> 01:40:49,875
I got a whole country
into E's and dance music.

2256
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:52,745
And then I got them
into coke and rock and roll.

2257
01:40:52,778 --> 01:40:55,247
And once I'd done that,
I got political,

2258
01:40:55,282 --> 01:40:57,217
and went and put
some of the biggest cunts

2259
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,185
on God's green earth
into government.

2260
01:40:59,218 --> 01:41:01,321
Mandy Mandelson, what a tool.

2261
01:41:01,354 --> 01:41:02,689
(WHISPERS) He said cunt.

2262
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,857
Tony Blair, they made out
they cared about social justice,

2263
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:08,126
when all they cared about
was keeping hold of power

2264
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:10,296
and lining their own pockets.

2265
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:12,732
Who got them to make
a new deal for the musicians?

2266
01:41:12,764 --> 01:41:13,665
I did.

2267
01:41:13,698 --> 01:41:15,568
Despite George Martin's
objections.

2268
01:41:15,602 --> 01:41:18,237
That's government policy.
I changed that.

2269
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:21,108
Anyway, Blair
had me ex-communicated,

2270
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:23,910
because I tried to turn
Malcolm McLaren

2271
01:41:23,943 --> 01:41:25,345
into Mayor of London.

2272
01:41:25,379 --> 01:41:26,746
Ex-communicated!

2273
01:41:26,779 --> 01:41:28,547
Who does he think he is,
the bastard Pope?

2274
01:41:28,581 --> 01:41:30,450
See, you give them
a little bit of power,

2275
01:41:30,483 --> 01:41:32,819
they lose all touch
with reality.

2276
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:34,319
Christ, look at me!

2277
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:36,422
I lost it
when I got a bit of power

2278
01:41:36,455 --> 01:41:37,991
running a record label.

2279
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:43,663
I know how those fuckers think.

2280
01:41:44,296 --> 01:41:45,498
Look, Gemma,

2281
01:41:48,068 --> 01:41:53,707

the way that you fit
into your environment,

2305

rather than try and change
your environment?

01:43:15,255 --> 01:43:19,592
I mean, friends, family.
Build a bridge.
