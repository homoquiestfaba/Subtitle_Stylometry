00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:04,584
(MultiCom Jingle)

00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:16,227
(exciting music)

3
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:18,469
(booming)

4
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:21,492
(clock ticks)

5
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:23,710
- My name is Josh Kirby.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,035
I was just your average ninth grader.

7
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:29,415
My biggest problem was
getting good grades,

8
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:31,147
and my idea of excitement

9
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:34,279
was racing my bicycle.
(bell rings)

10
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:35,581
Yes!

11
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,833
I never thought time
would catch up with me,

12
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,909
but I couldn't have imagined
that hundreds of years from now

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,107
mankind would invent the Nullifier,

14
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:47,406
a device capable of controlling

15
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,465
or destroying the universe.

16
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,284
- [Irwin] Prepare for the storm.

17
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,162
- [Josh's Voiceover] A
scientist named Irwin 1138

18
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:56,872
tried to disassemble
and hide the Nullifier,

19
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:58,310
but even he couldn't stop.

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,624
- [Irwin] Dr. Zoetrope!

21
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:01,517
(zinging)

22
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:03,498
(exciting instrumental music)

23
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:04,618
- Give me the Nullifier.

24
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:06,377
- You're too late, Zoetrope.

25
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:07,832
- It's never too late for me.

26
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:09,589
(zooming)

27
00:01:09,589 --> 00:01:10,608
- Irwin and Zoetrope

28
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:13,128
have been chasing each other
across the time stream,

29
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:16,190
trying to be the first to
find the Nullifier's pieces.

30
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,298
This time they're gonna land in 1995.

31
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:21,381
The place, my front yard.

32
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:26,429
Now I'm going along for
the ride of all time.

33
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:28,016
(zooming)

34
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:30,287
What's goin' on, where are we?

35
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,706
- I hope you're prepared
to do battle, young man.

36
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:34,581
This will be a war through time,

37
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:38,461
and Dr. Zoetrope will take no prisoners.

38
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:41,739
(booming)
(exciting instrumental music)

39
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:44,444
- [Josh] But we've got
help from a warrior.

40
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:46,365
- My name is Azabeth Siege.

41
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,572
- Oh, she's amazing!

42
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:52,373
And a magical creature called
Prism to show us the way.

43
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:55,492
Together, we're on a quest through time,

44
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:57,405
visiting different worlds to fight

45
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:59,948
for the Nullifier's pieces.

46
00:01:59,948 --> 00:02:03,767
- I'm obviously in the right
place and the right time.

47
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,699
- Because if Zoetrope ever
assembles the Nullifier,

48
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:09,419
he'll conquer time itself.

49
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,276
I've gotta try and save the universe.

50
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:15,109
(exciting instrumental music)

51
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:31,169
(swords clang)

52
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:35,002
(exciting instrumental music)

53
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:56,516
I was just a 14-year-old kid
before my adventure began,

54
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,599
but now I'm Josh Kirby, Time Warrior.

55
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:04,152
(upbeat exciting music)

56
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:16,819
- [Narrator] On the last chapter

57
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:19,152
of Josh Kirby, Time Warrior.

59
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,190
- 70,379 AD.

60
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:27,343
(yells)

61
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:29,007
- Yeah, what was that thing?

62
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,381
I thought we were still on Earth.

63
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,229
- We are still on Earth, Josh,

64
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:34,516
but the Earth of the far future.

65
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,561
(yelling)

66
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:40,376
(exciting instrumental music)

67
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,500
- Come on, you big bully,
catch me if you can!

68
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,123
- Listen to me, boy,

69
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,839
there are forces at work here
which you cannot understand.

70
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,696
- Well, come along you two.

71
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:50,707
Time is one thing we
can't afford to waste.

72
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,412
(zinging)

73
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:54,816
- Prism, don't touch that button!

74
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,755
I don't believe it!

75
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,593
Prism's gone rogue!

76
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:02,176
(tense instrumental music)

77
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,939
- Help!

78
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:04,943
Help!

79
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,026
- Josh Kirby!

80
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:09,620
Hold on, Josh Kirby!

81
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,046
(Josh yells)

82
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,578

83
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:17,745

00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,197
(groaning)

88
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:53,156
- Ow, serious near head injury.

89
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:56,584
It's definitely better than hyper-time

90
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,909
with a toy box soundtrack.

91
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,899
(sighs)

92
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:01,732
Ow.

93
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,012
(tense tinkling music)

94
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:13,478
- [Man] Growl!

95
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,935
(tense tinkling music)

96
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:20,541
- Yeah, probably just the wind.

97
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,915
(tinkling)

98
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,680
Yeah, yeah, or else I'm hearing things.

99
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,906
Hey, wouldn't be surprised

100
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:29,592
with the number of head
shots I've taken today.

101
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:31,256
(slow tinkling music)

102
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:33,249
♫ Dancing in the forest

103
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:36,312
♫ Under the blue sky

104
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,678
♫ Sing with the birds

105
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:43,428
♫ And floating like a butterfly

106
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,817
♫ Living in a dreamworld

107
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:49,023
♫ Red and blue dreamworld

108
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:52,262
♫ Oh it's good to be a toy

109
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,845
♫ In Toy World

110
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,576
♫ Toy World, Toy World

111
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:02,115
♫ Oh happiness and joy world

112
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:05,323
♫ Oh it's good to be a toy

113
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:08,903
♫ In Toy World
- Uh, hello?

114
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:10,356
- [Doll] Hello.

115
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:11,412
- Who's there?

116
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,446
- [Doll] Who's there?

117
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:15,148
- No, wait, I just saw you.

118
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:17,593
- [Doll] I just saw you.

119
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:19,548
- [Josh] Now this place is really weird.

120
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,781
- [Doll] Maybe you're weird.

121
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:22,742
- Excuse me?

122
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,325
- [Doll] Excuse me?

123
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,521
- Now, look, my name's Josh,

124
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,264
and I'm afraid I'm lost.

125
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,264
- Don't be afraid, Josh.

126
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:33,377
- Hi.

127
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:36,293
Well, I, I-I didn't really
mean that I was afraid.

128
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,002
You know, not of you anyway.

129
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,772
- Well, maybe you should be.

130
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:42,983
(laughing)
(playful music)

131
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:44,919
- What the heck did you do that for?

132
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,261
- Because it's funny, why else?

133
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:49,017
- Well, I don't know, maybe you're nuts!

134
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,591
- Oh, sticks and stones, moans and groans.

135
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,035
Call me Annie and hold still.

136
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:55,880
Can't be too careful these days.

137
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,121
Cooties, ya know.

138
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:59,930
I mean, I've had my
shots, but what about you?

139
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,166
I don't know your assembly
date, your batch number,

140
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,709
your power supply.

141
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,788
These are important considerations
for a modern-day doll.

142
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,067
- My batch number?

143
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:10,418
- Oh, please, you think
you can just waltz in here

144
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:12,211
like some kind of studly action figure,

145
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:13,629
chase me around my own house,

146
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,727
and then pull the blank-face routine?

147
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:16,912
Come on, Josh.

148
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,910
I mean, sure, you're cute, darn cute,

149
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,407
but you're only,

150
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:22,318
(twinkling music)
(gasps)

151
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:23,735
oh, you're a non.

152
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,849
- A non?

153
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:28,682
- Non-toy.

154
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,311
- And what's that make you?

155
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,152
- [Annie] Unzip me.

156
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:35,023
- What?

157
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:37,648
- Just do it and you'll see.

158
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:40,358
- All right, if you insist.

159
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:41,191
- Lower.

160
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,479
(zipping)
(exciting music)

161
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,546
(beeping)

162
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:48,965
- Holy smokes, you mean you're a?

163
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,215
- That's right.

164
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:52,980
- You're a living doll!

165
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,647
- Oh, why thank you, Josh.

166
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:58,514
(giggles)

167
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:00,474
- [Josh] Oh, uh, Annie, listen,

168
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,401
I'm kind of confused right now,
so if you could clue me in--

169
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:06,529
- Just think, a non-toy here with me.

170
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,069
Oh, I'm so excited I could rip a stitch!

171
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:12,917
- How about we start with where we are?

172
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,188
What do you call this place?

173
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,389
- Lookout behind you.

174
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,470
- Look outta what?

175
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,520
- Growl!

176
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
(yells)

177
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:24,334
- Boys will be boys,
and bears'll be bears.

178
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,093
Josh meet Theo.

179
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:27,732
- Get off me!

180
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,222
(growls)

181
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:30,479
- He likes to play.

182
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,917
- Hi, Theo.

183
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,490
You know, I don't really think ambushing

184
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,736
a poor, defenseless kid
exactly counts as play.

185
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:37,675
- Well he's a hungry bear.

186
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:39,673
Maybe he thought you'd be good to eat.

187
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,855
- Toys don't eat.

188
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,160
- Well, obviously you're not up

189
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,130
on the latest toy technology.

190
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,673
Show him, Theo.

191
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,523
(mumbling)
(playful music)

192
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,926
- This Teddy's a treat, he can really eat.

193
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,805
(Theo mumbles)

194
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:57,710
Oh boy, this place is really weird.

195
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,000
- No it's not, you silly, it's Toy World.

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,159
(giggles)

197
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,038
(zooming)

198
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,205
- [Irwin] Thank goodness
you're back, Prism.

199
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,278
Come on, you can do it, little friend.

200
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:09,241
- Does he have it?

201
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,721
Has he found the position for Josh Kirby?

202
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:12,336
- Not possible.

203
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,619
The mysterious depths of
Prism's tracking powers

204
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:16,879
still have to be fully fathomed.

205
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,109
- We must succeed, we must!

206
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,260
- I understand, young lady,

207
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,260
but you must realize the
difficulty of our task.

208
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,920
The odds of our stumbling upon poor Josh

209
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,803
among the eons of hyper-time

210
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:32,470
are precisely one in 5,487,600--

211
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:35,817
- Yes, yes, I understand.

212
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:37,280
- And three.

213
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,002
(Prism chirps)

214
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:44,169
And then, of course, there's
still Dr. Zoetrope 366.

215
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:50,303
There is the off chance that
Zoetrope's slightly superior

216
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:52,627
intellect may enhance his ability

217
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,412
to pinpoint Josh's location.

218
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:57,328
- Oh, then what you are
saying is hardly encouraging.

219
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:00,883
- Perhaps, but we do have one advantage,

220
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:03,298
the unparalleled and infallible technology

221
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,911
of my time pod's instrumentation.

222
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:08,471
All invented by myself, of course,

223
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:11,246
which will undoubtedly
lead us to Josh first

224
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:12,833
and prove once and for all

225
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,666
that I am more than Zoetrope's equal.

226
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,266
(zinging)

227
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,519
(alarm beeps)

228
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,379
What?

229
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,997
- Well, is this the
unparalleled or infallible part?

230
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,637
- But,
(beeping)

231
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:28,163
my electronic circuits.

232
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:29,774
- As the fourth code of Kang states,

233
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:33,102
that which is unparalleled
cannot be infallible.

234
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:36,385
(alarm beeps)

235
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:38,635
(giggling)

236
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,508
- [Josh] Uh, how long
til my clothes are dry?

237
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:46,689
- Oh, not long, should
be right this afternoon.

238
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:49,742
- You mean I have to stay
in these clothes all day?

239
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,157
I look like Pinocchio.

240
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:54,157
(sighs)

241
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:57,401
What are you doing?

242
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,552
- Orange pekoe, quite refreshing.

243
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,424
(Theo mumbles)

244
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:02,582
- It's all this guy Zoetrope's fault.

245
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:04,446
A real evil genius, you know?

246
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:07,959
Determined to twist time around
his little demented finger.

247
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,581
He also destroyed my CBL bracelet,

248
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,089
which means I should
still be in limbo land,

249
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:13,371
but that's another story.

250
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:14,679
- Sounds serious.

251
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,499
- Yeah, no kidding.

252
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:17,848
I've gotta get back to the time pod,

253
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:20,618
so my friends and I can stop him,

254
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:22,043
(playful music)

255
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:23,550
put everything back to normal.

256
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,172
- One lump of sugar or two?

257
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:27,179
- The entire universe is in peril,

258
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,180
and all you can do is drink pretend tea?

259
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,709
Hello!

260
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,440
Have you heard a word I've said?

261
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,984
- Every word, Josh.

262
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:37,427
You're obviously a raving lunatic non-toy

263
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:40,168
who should be rushed
to Gepetto immediately.

264
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:41,501
- Who's Gepetto?

265
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:43,350
- Oh.

266
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,777
- Why, he who builds all toys, of course!

267
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:48,572
The merry maker, the top
tinker, the clever creator--

268
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:49,802
- Yeah, I got it.

269
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,861
- And he's the only non-toy in Toy World,

270
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:53,378
except for you.

271
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:54,885
- Yeah, maybe he can help me.

272
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:56,866
- He can do anything.

273
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,609
- All right, let's go meet this Gepetto.

274
00:12:58,609 --> 00:12:59,601
We haven't got much time.

275
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:03,126
- But you haven't touched your tea.

276
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,839
- I know that, Annie.

277
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,250
I'm just waiting for it to cool.

278
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,914
In the meantime,

279
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,936
I have something to tell you both,

280
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:13,940
something a little scary,

281
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,690
make that very scary.

282
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:20,358
You see, Dr. Zoetrope is also a toy maker,

283
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:22,924
and right now he's searching
for the parts to a toy bomb

284
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:25,275
that could easily destroy all of Toy World

285
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,505
and the toy universe.

286
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:30,225
It's called the Nullifier.

287
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:33,172
A brilliant scientist named Irwin 1138

288
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:34,519
tried to disassemble and hide

289
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,745
all of the six Nullifier pieces.

290
00:13:36,745 --> 00:13:40,578
(dramatic instrumental music)

291
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:52,062
- Prepare for the storm.

292
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:55,895
(dramatic instrumental music)

293
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,303
(beeps)

294
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:12,136
(dramatic instrumental music)

295
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:18,439
(beeps)

296
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,272
(dramatic instrumental music)

297
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:25,596
- [Josh] Irwin 1138's plan

298
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:27,807
was to scatter the pieces all across time.

299
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,140
(swooshing)

300
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,780
(beeps)

301
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:40,890
(ringing)

302
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,987
(slow dramatic music)

303
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:55,074
(beeps)

304
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:04,141
(swooshing)
(dramatic music)

305
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:06,485
- Next.

306
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:11,375
(dramatic instrumental music)

307
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,860
(beeps)

308
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:21,106
(dramatic instrumental music)

309
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:26,789
Next.

310
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,812
(swooshing)

311
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:32,645
(dramatic instrumental music)

312
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,380
(beeping)

313
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,375
(swooshing)

314
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,625
We need another 93 seconds.

315
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,557
Seal the door.

316
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:00,126
- [Josh] Dr. Zoetrope, an
even more brilliant scientist,

317
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:01,828
has been doing everything in his power

318
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:03,795
to reassemble the Nullifier pieces

319
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:05,831
and destroy the universe.

320
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:09,664
(exciting instrumental music)

321
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,057
(popping)

322
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:12,912
(yelling)
- [Irwin] Quick,

323
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:14,931
load the final component!

324
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:16,090
- [Man] Let's go.

325
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,923
(dramatic instrumental music)

326
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:24,133
(thuds)
(yelling)

327
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:24,966
Let's go!

328
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,386
- [Irwin] Dr. Zoetrope!

329
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:30,010
(zings)
- [Man] Man, run!

330
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,651
(zinging)
Go!

331
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,818
(zooming)

332
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,141
(beeps)

333
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:44,240
(zinging)
(dramatic music)

334
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:47,940
- [Man] Brother!

335
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,498
(zinging)
(groans)

336
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:50,930
(tense music)

337
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,087
- [Man] I can't hold him off!

338
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:56,109
(dramatic instrumental music)

339
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,464
- [Man] Come on, we gotta get outta here!

340
00:17:57,464 --> 00:17:58,297
This way!

341
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:00,532
(dramatic instrumental music)

342
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:01,645
(men yell)

343
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,895
- Irwin, you're a lunatic.

344
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:06,821
- You're too late, Zoetrope!

345
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:09,030
- It's never too late for me.

346
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,746
(zinging)
(dramatic music)

347
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:12,829
(groans)

348
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,206
(footsteps thud)
(dramatic music)

349
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,940
(rapid beeping)

350
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:27,538
(tense instrumental music)

351
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:33,233
In the name of all of
creation, twisted old man,

352
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,816
what have you done?

353
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:38,090
(swooshing)

354
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:43,193
- And it's my job to keep
it from being put together.

355
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:44,026
Ah,

356
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,029
so,

357
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:50,339
don't you think we should be on our way?

358
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,339
- I say, shall we dance?

359
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:54,765
- Yeah!

360
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:56,046
- What?

361
00:18:56,046 --> 00:18:57,883
When did he talk?

362
00:18:57,883 --> 00:19:00,003
- [Annie] Since he wanted to dance silly.

363
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:04,170
(Theo mumbles)
(playful music)

364
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:07,143
- I can't believe this.

365
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,886
The fate of everything that
ever has been or ever will be

366
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:12,547
is up for grabs and you guys are dancing!

367
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:15,907
- Oh, come on, Josh,
lighten up and shake a leg.

368
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:20,074
(playful music)
(Theo mumbles)

369
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:22,735
- Just a sec.

370
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:26,127
(laughing)

371
00:19:28,187 --> 00:19:29,448
Wait a minute!

372
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:31,698
(laughing)

373
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,221
- What is it?

374
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,059
- It's a piece of the Nullifier.

375
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,884
- How did you know it was there, old man?

376
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:40,801
- I didn't.

377
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:43,888
(laughing)
Not really.

378
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:46,930
It was like, it was like
I was meant to find it.

379
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,180
(laughing)

380
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,504
(swooshing)

381
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:57,933
(alarm beeps)

382
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,085
- Well, that should do it.

383
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:01,895
Try it, Prism.

384
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:06,062
(alarm beeps)
(Prism mumbles)

385
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,677
Excellent!

386
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:17,816
We're back in business.

387
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,723
(rumbling)
(dramatic music)

388
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:20,556
- What now?

389
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:21,756
- Blast!

390
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:24,840
The gravitational repulsors
are still on the faulty side.

391
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,992
The debris from the time stream

392
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,270
is going to batter us senseless

393
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,723
if we don't get out of here soon.

394
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:30,847
- No, we cannot leave here
until we locate Josh Kirby.

395
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,178
- Well then we'd better locate him quickly

396
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,170
or it'll be too bad for all of us.

397
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,857
(dramatic instrumental music)

398
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:39,667
(booming)

399
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,417
- So, what's it like?

400
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,271
- What's what like?

401
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:47,194
- You know, being non-toy,

402
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:48,194
truly alive.

403
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:52,163
- Well, that's a hard one, Annie.

404
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:54,797
Wouldn't you rather know
about the periodic table

405
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,223
or the Aztecs?

406
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,703
- Idiotic table of spaztecs?

407
00:20:58,703 --> 00:20:59,703
- Nevermind.

408
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:05,071
Well, I, I guess life is
different for different people.

409
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:06,289
I mean, everybody wakes up in the morning

410
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:07,444
and brushes their teeth,

411
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:09,172
but then there's about a million decisions

412
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:11,625
that have to be made.

413
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,792
It gets kind of confusing, but

414
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:15,920
I guess, I guess life's
what you make of it,

415
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,744
as my dad would say
over and over and over.

416
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,911
- Oh, it sounds wonderful.

417
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:22,242
- It does?

418
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:23,246
- Well, sure.

419
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:25,851
I mean, what you're saying is
that non-toys can do anything

420
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,100
if they try hard enough.

421
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,102
Us toys just keep doing the
same things over and over

422
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:33,296
because it's how we're made.

423
00:21:33,296 --> 00:21:34,900
It's all we know.

424
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,164
After awhile it gets kind of.

425
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:38,248
- Tiring?

426
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:39,619
- Exactly.

427
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:41,551
A modern-day doll needs stimulation,

428
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,750
and I'm just not getting any.

429
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,625
- Well, I don't know, Annie,

430
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,522
you seem pretty full of life to me.

431
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:49,497
- Hah, I'm just a toy.

432
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:51,035
Could a real person do this?

433
00:21:51,035 --> 00:21:53,629
(ripping)
(chiming music)

434
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:56,329
- Uh, yeah, well, you made your point.

435
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:58,978
- I mean, toys don't
learn, toys don't grow.

436
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:01,446
We play the same games,
sing the same songs,

437
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:04,299
and dance the same dances forever.

438
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:06,164
- Well it's no cakewalk
being human either,

439
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:07,682
or non-toy, I mean.

440
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:10,306
There's a lot of problems
you can't even imagine.

441
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:12,978
- Now you sound like Gepetto.

442
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:16,281
- Look, all I'm saying is you
toys get to have nonstop fun.

443
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:18,575
You don't have to worry
about tests or bullies

444
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:20,385
or the ozone layer.

445
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:23,512
- What I wouldn't give
for those problems, Josh.

446
00:22:23,512 --> 00:22:26,706
To awaken and face the
challenges of a new day,

447
00:22:26,706 --> 00:22:28,980
to labor for one's dreams,

448
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,683
to achieve one's desires,

449
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,266
to feel the warm touch
of a non-toy caress,

450
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,982
to share with that special someone

451
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:43,053
a physical and emotional
bond of pure passion,

452
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:44,970
the power of true love.

453
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:47,442
- Well, Annie,

454
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:50,667
I suddenly feel very
thankful for being human.

455
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:54,656
- I say, Josh old chap, look over here.

456
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:58,208
- Oh, can we continue
this discussion later?

457
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,318
- Sure, I guess so.

458
00:22:59,318 --> 00:23:00,678
- Okay.

459
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:03,570
(playful music)

460
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,396
- Yes, yes, yes.

461
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:06,824
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, look.

462
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:08,921
Gepetto's castle.

463
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,317
(magical music)

464
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:11,542
- Wow, nice place.

465
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,666
- Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet.

466
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,916
(playful upbeat music)

467
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,144
- So how do we get in there?

468
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:28,448
- I ask the questions around here.

469
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,791
- Whoa, an egg that talks?

470
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:31,791
- Eggxactly.

471
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,031
- Okay, what's the question?

472
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:36,879
- Knock knock.

473
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:38,021
- Who's there?

474
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:39,447
- I don't know.

475
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:40,599
- I don't know.

476
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,678
- I don't know who?

477
00:23:41,678 --> 00:23:43,188
- I don't know who you are,

478
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,481
so you can make an eggxit.

479
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:48,427
- Oh, come on, Egg, do we have to beg?

480
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,391
- Eggxcruciating, isn't it?

481
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:52,476
(chuckles) This is Toy World,

482
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:54,461
remember the yolk's on you.

483
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:57,711
(upbeat playful music)

484
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:10,251
- [Theo] Hello, chaps, hello!

485
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,739
- Hi, I'm just visiting.

486
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,989
Hi, I'm a toy-boy, boy-toy,

487
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,186
well, if you wanna get technical about it,

488
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:19,788
nevermind.

489
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:22,439
(laughing)
(excited chattering)

490
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:25,029
- Hey, Theo!
- Give me five, oh!

491
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:26,485
- Hi!

492
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:28,895
(playful music)

493
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:30,228
- [Annie] Hello.

494
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:34,510
- Hi, I'm from out of town.

495
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,646
Oh, that's a nice beak

496
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:36,479
you got there.
- Thank you.

497
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,984
- That's nice, that's
nice, hi, nice to see ya,

498
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:39,175
nice to see ya.

499
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:40,675
Oh boy, hi, hello.

500
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,649
This is great, this.

501
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,693
(excited chattering)
(gentle music)

502
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,160
Hey!

503
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,993
Hey there!

504
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:52,123
You must be Gepetto, right?

505
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,440
- Why, yes.

506
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,760
And for some reason I can't imagine,

507
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,488
you're not a toy.

508
00:24:57,488 --> 00:24:58,655
- Well, no, I.

509
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:00,671
- Not a toy?

510
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:03,496
(drumming and whistle music)

511
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:04,962
I don't like it.

512
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,336
I don't like it one bit.

513
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:10,463
(drumming and whistle music)

514
00:25:10,463 --> 00:25:13,931
Request permission to prepare
the interrogation room, sir!

515
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:17,412
- Oh, Jason, we don't even
have an interrogation room.

516
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:20,099
- It's Jack, not Jason.

517
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:21,432
What he meant was,

518
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,766
it's not quite operational yet,

519
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:25,670
but it could be!

520
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,548
Jack,

521
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:27,853
Action Jack,

522
00:25:27,853 --> 00:25:29,769
private first class.

523
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:33,268
(patriotic drumming and whistle music)

524
00:25:33,268 --> 00:25:35,809
(crunching)
(chuckles)

525
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:36,684
(groans)

526
00:25:36,684 --> 00:25:38,017
Nice to meet ya.

527
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:42,239
- Yeah, yeah, a real pleasure.

528
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,072
Look, uh,

529
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:46,141
I need your help.

530
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:49,789
See, I don't know how I got
here and, uh, I'm kinda scared.

531
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:51,834
I've gotta get back to my
friends in the time pod,

532
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:54,577
and you seem to be the
man running the show.

533
00:25:54,577 --> 00:25:56,305
- Did you say show?

534
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,362
I almost forgot. (chuckles)

535
00:25:58,362 --> 00:25:59,937
- It's a matter of
intergalactic life and death.

536
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:02,312
- Did you say death?

537
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,848
- Start the show.

538
00:26:03,848 --> 00:26:04,681
- Ah, no!

539
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:09,255
- Almost there.

540
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:13,047
Attention friends, it's showtime.

541
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:18,974
(upbeat horn music)
(excited chattering)

542
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,941
(chuckles)

543
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:29,421
- Sir, what I have to tell you
is really important honest.

544
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,411
See, there's this incredibly
powerful Dr. Zoetrope--

545
00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:34,440
- Forget it, kid, it's showtime.

546
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,920
The old coot won't hear a word

547
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,226
until all this shiny happy crap is over.

548
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:41,831
- Uh, just a suggestion, uh,

549
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:44,040
maybe you're due for an attitude tuneup.

550
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,931
(chuckles)

551
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:45,764

(chain clangs)

552
00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:48,722
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, relax.

00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:28,443
I'm gonna explode.

567
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:30,260
- Really?

568
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:33,130

(Theo mumbles)

583
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,208

Hello?

Hah, they're all dancin'.

- Oh, no!

606
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:50,327
- Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt.

607
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:53,360
(dramatic instrumental music)

608
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Except maybe that toast.

609
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:57,849
- Who are you?

610
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,698
And what do you want?

611
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:02,590
- And where'd you get
that awesome hardware?

612
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,062
- I'm here for one reason
and one reason only.

613
00:32:05,062 --> 00:32:06,583
He knows who he is

614
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,659
and I know he's here.

615
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,159
- [Theo] Oh, dear.

616
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:14,262
- No need to look so hard, Dr. Zoetrope.

617
00:32:14,262 --> 00:32:16,635
I'm right in front of
your time-twisted nose.

618
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,132
- Hello, Joshua.

619
00:32:18,132 --> 00:32:21,024
You know what I want, just
cooperate and hand it over.

620
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,872
(dramatic instrumental music)

621
00:32:22,872 --> 00:32:23,872
- Cooperate?

622
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,751
But only if all the toys
are willing to never again

623
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:28,602
dance in the sunshine!

624
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:29,921
And if you're willing to kiss goodbye

625
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:32,621
this beautiful place we call Toy World.

626
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:34,776
Theo, Theo, Theo,

627
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,193
oh, thanks, Theo.

628
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,371
- You have no idea what
you are saying, young man.

629
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:41,538
- Oh yes I do.

630
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:45,171
Unless you toys are with me,

631
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,842
the universe is doomed to destruction

632
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,984
at the hands of this madman.

633
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:50,163
(tense music)

634
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:51,876
So what do you say?

635
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:55,594
Are you ready to join
with me and stop him?

636
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:58,898
Uh, like I said, are you ready
to stand up for yourselves

637
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:00,759
and stop this maniac?

638
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,744
(Theo mumbles)

639
00:33:02,744 --> 00:33:04,855
(dramatic music)

640
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:07,445
Like I said, are you ready
to stand up for yourselves

641
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:08,872
and stop this maniac?

642
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:11,705
- [Zoetrope] Oh, give it up, Josh.

643
00:33:13,298 --> 00:33:14,965
- It's no use, Josh.

644
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:19,544
My children are the same as
I when it comes to violence.

645
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:21,270
We just say no.

646
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,587
- Hey, speak for yourself, pal.

647
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:25,233
- Yeah, but this is serious.

648
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:26,538
- Toys don't fight.

649
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:27,879
They play.

650
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:30,746
- Face it, kid, you're outgunned.

651
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:32,996
- The component, Josh, now.

652
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:35,546
- No way.

653
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,442
- Then you leave me no choice.

654
00:33:37,442 --> 00:33:38,275
- [Theo] Ooh.

655
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:39,108
(zinging)

656
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:40,701
(laughs)
- [Zoetrope] What?

657
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:42,273
(laughs)

658
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:46,959
- Your weapons are useless
here, my metallic friend.

659
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,800
- What are you talking
about, you old fool?

660
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,145
- Long ago, I installed an
energy field around Toy World,

661
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:58,312
a field which disrupts all
offensive armaments of any kind.

662
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:03,210
This is a happy place, free from violence,

663
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,627
and that's how it shall stay.

664
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:08,049
- All right,

665
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:09,002
new game, everyone.

666
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:10,166
- [Theo] New, new game?

667
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:13,459
- Keep this glass bone away
from the big, scary looking guy.

668
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:14,349
What do ya say?

669
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:15,898
All right.
- Oh, new game!

670
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:17,782
(laughing)
(playful music)

671
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:19,336
- Come here, no, no, no, no!

672
00:34:19,336 --> 00:34:21,033
(laughing)

673
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,305
- Here ya go, Mr. Maniac.

674
00:34:23,305 --> 00:34:26,632
- [Zoetrope] Somebody better
give me that Nullifier now!

675
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:29,469
You don't know who you're playing with.

676
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:32,678
- Nice going, Josh, nice going!

677
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:34,022
- I thought so.

678
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,351
- I will crush this old man's head!

679
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:37,191
(yelling)

680
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,714
Give me my Nullifier now!

681
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:40,547
Come here!

682
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:41,380
(yelling)

683
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,457
If I get my hands on you,

684
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,626
you will rue the day
you ever messed with me!

685
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,876
Do you know who I am?

686
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,686
Do you know who I am?

687
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,799
(laughing)

688
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:54,135
Joshua, you have just
signed your death warrant.

689
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,119
- Let's go, let's go!

690
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,634
- [Zoetrope] When I get my hands on you.

691
00:34:56,634 --> 00:34:57,467
- Let's go.

692
00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:59,598
- [Zoetrope] Oh, you leave me no choice.

693
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,313
- Come to Daddy.

694
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:04,137
(dramatic instrumental music)

695
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:05,509
Oh no!

696
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:07,593
- The Nullifier component
is indestructible, Josh.

697
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:09,251
You however are not.

698
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:12,339
Tell your childish friends to
give me the component at once

699
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:13,216
or else.

700
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:15,175
(dramatic instrumental music)

701
00:35:15,175 --> 00:35:16,008
My stars,

702
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:19,081
where's your crowd displacement lock?

703
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:21,706
- You let him go this instant!

704
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,189
(yells)
(gooey splattering)

705
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:26,411
- (chuckles) This is gettin' really good.

706
00:35:26,411 --> 00:35:27,362
- I'm soaked!

707
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:30,074
(laughing)

708
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:31,630
Joshua!

709
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,697
I'm not kidding, Joshua!

710
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:37,330
(laughing)
(footsteps stomp)

711
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,689
- [Josh] Hey, toss it
over here, you clown!

712
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:43,856
(playful music)
(laughing)

713
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,426
(slow instrumental music)

714
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:51,758
When will I learn?

715
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,858
- [Gepetto] Direct drive!

716
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:55,709
- Hurry up, Gepetto, he's headed this way.

717
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:58,999
(tense music)
(clicking)

718
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:01,606
- Joshua, I may not be able to see you,

719
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:05,197
but I can still hear you,
and I'm coming for you, boy.

720
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,430
(clicking)
(playful music)

721
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,420
I can still hear you, Joshua!

722
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,136
You cannot escape me!

723
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,906
(clicking)
(playful music)

724
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:14,739
Joshua!

725
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:17,070
Joshua!

726
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,770
You cannot escape me!

727
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,037
(playful music)
(clicking)

728
00:36:27,037 --> 00:36:29,081
- [Theo] (laughs) Forward, forward!

729
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:31,333
(laughs) Pretty good.

730
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:34,405
(playful music)

731
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:35,296
(swooshes)

732
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:38,329
- Very well, my little mechanical friends,

733
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,496
how would you like to play a new game?

734
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:43,114
(toys cheer)

735
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:45,527
It's an extremely satisfying
activity I like to call

736
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:48,172
mind slavery of an inferior species.

737
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,139
(toys gasp)

738
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:52,129
Your puny brains belong to me now.

739
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:55,228
You will serve my every whim.

740
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:58,835
- [Toys] Our puny brains
belongs to us now.

741
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:01,480
We will serve our every whim.

742
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,616
(laughing and cheering)

743
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,879
- My stars, they have no minds to control.

744
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,284
(yelling and clapping)

745
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:09,710
- Mind slavery sure is a lot of fun!

746
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,249
(laughing and cheering)

747
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:13,166
- Hey, bud,

748
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,869
you wanna play with these toys,

749
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,487
you talk to me.

750
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,995
- And who are you?

751
00:37:19,995 --> 00:37:24,619
- Action Jack, AKA the one
toy who's a little too human

752
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,221
for his own good.

753
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:28,238
- I'm listening.

754
00:37:28,238 --> 00:37:30,653
- Your basic toy is a simple creature,

755
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:33,134
motivated by two things,

756
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:34,877
the desire to have fun

757
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,127
and the fear of punishment.

758
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:39,685
- Fear, you say?

759
00:37:39,685 --> 00:37:42,432
- [Jack] I thought that
would get your attention.

760
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:44,611
- All right, folks,

761
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:47,769
after a brief consultation
with my associate here,

762
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:51,785
I have decided there will be
no more games in Toy World.

763
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:53,693
(groaning)

764
00:37:53,693 --> 00:37:56,793
And there won't be any more
singing or dancing either.

765
00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:58,682
(groaning)

766
00:37:58,682 --> 00:38:01,044
- Oh, nice touch, Doc.

767
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:04,402
- These new rules will be
in effect forever and a day,

768
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:05,235
unless,

769
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:08,212
unless all of you help me capture

770
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:09,942
that evil non-toy Josh Kirby.

771
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:11,711
(groaning)
(gasping)

772
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:12,947
- We're sorry, sir.

773
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:14,824
We didn't mean to offend you,

774
00:38:14,824 --> 00:38:16,979
but we'll do as you command.

775
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:19,048
- A wise decision.

776
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:22,861
But just in case anyone changes
their mind, remember this.

777
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:25,028
Disassembly is a heartbeat away.

778
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:29,641
(gasping)
(groaning)

779
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,178
(swooshing)

780
00:38:32,178 --> 00:38:34,008
(gasping)
(groaning)

781
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:36,758
(dramatic music)

782
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:42,829
- Attention, friends,

783
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:43,996
it's showtime!

784
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,652
(zooming)

785
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:50,235
(Prism chirps)

786
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,268
- We have been searching aimlessly

787
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:56,856
and we are running out of time.

788
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:58,242
- Perhaps we might fare better

789
00:38:58,242 --> 00:39:01,232
without this continuous commentary.

790
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:04,045
- I am simply trying to
ignite a source of heat

791
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:05,387
beneath your hindquarters.

792
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:06,717
- What?

793
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:09,667
- It's just an expression.

794
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:10,500
- Look,

795
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:14,672
I am trying every trick
in the time travel book

796
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:15,922
to locate Josh.

797
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:21,038
It is mildly embarrassing to
admit that I'm not certain

798
00:39:21,038 --> 00:39:22,985
we could continue to protect the Nullifier

799
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:27,060
and to defeat Zoetrope
without Josh's assistance.

800
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,416
Besides which,

801
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:32,327
I've actually grown quite fond of the boy.

802
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:33,327
- As have I,

803
00:39:34,587 --> 00:39:37,154
and I let him down, I
should've protected him.

804
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:38,427
- Nonsense!

805
00:39:38,427 --> 00:39:41,061
Josh's disappearance was Zoetrope's doing.

806
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:43,435
- No, no, do not try and coddle me.

807
00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:45,093
The ninth code of Kang is quite Specific

808
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,271
regarding all failure.

809
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:49,438
If one snoozes, one loses.

810
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:55,915
(sad instrumental music)

811
00:39:57,808 --> 00:39:59,655
- Oh, stop this at once!

812
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:00,782
- To atone for my negligence,

813
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:02,430
I must perform the
sacred act of repentance.

814
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,557
- Please, child, it's not worth it.

815
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:06,148
(dramatic music)

816
00:40:06,148 --> 00:40:10,315
(chants in Kangian)
(Prism squeals)

817
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:16,181
What are you doing?

818
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,065
- The Kangian chant of the forlorn.

819
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,455
(chants in Kangian)

820
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,305
- Let me revise that, my child.

821
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:29,849
It's really not worth it.

822
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:32,849
(chants in Kangian)

823
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:37,724
- [Josh] Hey, this thing actually
gets pretty good mileage.

824
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:40,358
- [Gepetto] She's one
of a kind, GM original.

825
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:42,278
Gepetto Motors, that is.

826
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:44,945
(playful music)

827
00:40:47,803 --> 00:40:51,702
- Look, I enjoy a good getaway
just as much as the next guy,

828
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,837
but Zoetrope won't give up.

829
00:40:53,837 --> 00:40:55,593
He'll be right back on
me and the component

830
00:40:55,593 --> 00:40:57,601
in no time at all.

831
00:40:57,601 --> 00:41:00,438
I've gotta find a way to get
back to the time pod somehow.

832
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,260
- Well, I say we take
care of that big bully

833
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,739
once and for all.

834
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:06,621
- That certainly would help
return life back to normal,

835
00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:07,596
wouldn't it?

836
00:41:07,596 --> 00:41:08,953
- [Theo] Oh, oh, oh.

837
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:11,750
- As Mama Gepetto used to say,

838
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,167
"There's no defense like a good offense."

839
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:17,609
- Wait, Gepetto!

840
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:23,631
Didn't you say you and the
toys were strictly nonviolent?

841
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:24,548
- Well, uh,

842
00:41:27,716 --> 00:41:31,866
there's always, uh, shades of gray, Josh.

843
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:34,957
Like what Annie did back
there in the courtyard.

844
00:41:34,957 --> 00:41:36,793
- Oh, that was nothing,

845
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:38,714
just icing on the cake.

846
00:41:38,714 --> 00:41:41,578
- Unfortunately, icing
alone won't be enough

847
00:41:41,578 --> 00:41:43,526
to defeat our unwanted visitor.

848
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:46,598
That's why Josh and I are
going into Nightmare Forest.

849
00:41:46,598 --> 00:41:48,339
- [Annie And Theo] Nightmare Forest!

850
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,972
- Nightmare Forest?

851
00:41:49,972 --> 00:41:54,129
- Now, now, it's the
only place I can possibly

852
00:41:54,129 --> 00:41:57,693
cook up something to deal
with this Dr. Zoetrope.

853
00:41:57,693 --> 00:41:59,623
And after, we'll take care of him.

854
00:41:59,623 --> 00:42:03,220
Perhaps, we can get you
back to this time pod

855
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,880
you keep talking about.

856
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,104
(sad instrumental music)

857
00:42:10,104 --> 00:42:10,937
- Annie.

858
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:12,996
Hey, Annie.

859
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:17,514
(sad instrumental music)

860
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:19,372
Hey, Annie.

861
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:21,402
- Hello.

862
00:42:22,983 --> 00:42:26,176
- Um, back there on the courtyard,

863
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,798
well, you probably saved my life.

864
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:30,197
- I had to.

865
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:33,530
You were in danger and I care about you.

866
00:42:35,337 --> 00:42:38,870
- Well that's a very non-toy thing to say.

867
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,554
Look, whatever Gepetto's got up his sleeve

868
00:42:41,554 --> 00:42:43,557
in this nightmare place,
I'm sure it'll work out.

869
00:42:43,557 --> 00:42:45,520
- But I won't be with you.

870
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,179
Toys can't enter Nightmare Forest.

871
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:51,429
- Well, I'll come back, I promise.

872
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:54,707
And then, then we can
have some tea together.

873
00:42:54,707 --> 00:42:58,040
At least by then my clothes will be dry.

874
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,138
- Can't you just move into
the gingerbread house with us

875
00:43:01,138 --> 00:43:04,061
and live happily ever after?

876
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:06,898
- Well, I'd like that a lot, Annie,

877
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:08,967
but there's a time-displaced
universe in jeopardy

878
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:10,987
and it's gotta be saved.

879
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:12,343
- Growl!

880
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:15,458
(playful music)

881
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,291
Here.

882
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:20,821
- Oh, good idea.

883
00:43:21,776 --> 00:43:23,495
In case you two get lost,

884
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:26,293
just leave a trail of these
nuts and bolts behind you

885
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:28,334
and that way you'll be
able to find your way back

886
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:29,294
to Toy World.

887
00:43:29,294 --> 00:43:30,775
- [Theo] Mm-hmm.

888
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,295
- Thanks a lot, Theo.

889
00:43:32,295 --> 00:43:33,807
Where'd you get these anyway?

890
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:35,069
- Oh.
- I'm ready!

891
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:37,444
(thuds)

892
00:43:37,444 --> 00:43:39,111
- Oh, oh, nevermind.

893
00:43:41,105 --> 00:43:43,355
- Well, goodbye, my friend.

894
00:43:47,046 --> 00:43:51,213
(rumbling)
(slow dramatic music)

895
00:43:57,478 --> 00:44:00,468
- We'll have to make the
rest of our journey on foot.

896
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:04,179
Nightmare Forest is too dense
for four-wheel transport.

897
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:05,609
- [Josh] Nightmare Forest, huh?

898
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:06,667
How'd it get the name?

899
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,900
- Several reasons,

900
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,317
actually, here's one of them.

901
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:14,374
- Ugh, it's pretty gruesome.

902
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:16,608
- Super Ninja model, 323,

903
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:18,525
advanced hi-yah action.

904
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,998
- You know, this place
gives me the creeps.

905
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:25,498
- Ah, Johnny Command play set,

906
00:44:26,948 --> 00:44:31,169
early model, prior to self-relubrication.

907
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,336
(slow dramatic music)

908
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,375
- You're gonna build a toy
to battle Dr. Zoetrope,

909
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,471
aren't you?

910
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,638
- In a manner of speaking.

911
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:43,076
- Oh, excellent!

912
00:44:43,076 --> 00:44:45,972
I mean, with all this
stuff, we're halfway there.

913
00:44:45,972 --> 00:44:47,972
Oh, check this baby out.

914
00:44:49,068 --> 00:44:50,985
The Zapazoid BFG-9,000.

915
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:53,323
Way cool, or what?

916
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,554
- Oh, I'm afraid that
thing falls decidedly

917
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:57,750
in the what category.

918
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,667
We are not here to rearm Toy World.

919
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:03,884
- But you just that we
were gonna take on Dr. Z

920
00:45:03,884 --> 00:45:07,285
with some totally cool,
psycho-mutant power toy, right?

921
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:09,425
- I said nothing of the sort.

922
00:45:09,425 --> 00:45:12,320
There's more than one way
to, uh, skin a scoundrel,

923
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,153
young boy,

924
00:45:14,197 --> 00:45:17,447
and my way does not include a Zapazoid.

925
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,247
- Gepetto,

926
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:22,387
your weapon disrupter shield
may have put the kibosh

927
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,346
on Zoetrope's blaster,

928
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,129
but he's the most brilliant
man in the 25th century.

929
00:45:27,129 --> 00:45:28,679
He's got about a million other tricks

930
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:31,313
up his time-armored sleeve
and the brain to use 'em.

931
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:33,397
How are you gonna beat all that?

932
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,811
- I'm sure I'll think of something,

933
00:45:35,811 --> 00:45:37,561
something nonviolent.

934
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:40,917
- Come on, Gepetto.

935
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:43,507
What's wrong with a little
fight fire with fire?

936
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,905
The universe is at stake here,

937
00:45:44,905 --> 00:45:47,445
and we've gotta fight
for what we believe in.

938
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:49,884
(slow tense music)

939
00:45:49,884 --> 00:45:52,874
- [Gepetto] Fire with fire, you say?

940
00:45:52,874 --> 00:45:54,082
- You bet.

941
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:55,575
It's our duty to fight the good fight.

942
00:45:55,575 --> 00:45:58,636
- Where do you think you are, Josh?

943
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:02,092
What do you think this
Nightmare Forest is?

944
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,900
It's a graveyard,

945
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,782
one of thousands just like it.

946
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:09,662
When there weren't enough
people left to fight each other,

947
00:46:09,662 --> 00:46:12,554
they built attack bots to finish the job,

948
00:46:12,554 --> 00:46:15,187
except they built them
too well, I'm afraid.

949
00:46:15,187 --> 00:46:17,886
And when the robots were
done with the humans,

950
00:46:17,886 --> 00:46:20,688
they went after each other.

951
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:22,105
- What about you?

952
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:24,979
- Me?

953
00:46:24,979 --> 00:46:28,229
Uh, I was, uh, fortunate you might say.

954
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:32,784
I built the most vicious killer toys

955
00:46:32,784 --> 00:46:34,867
on the face of the earth.

956
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:37,222
It's true.

957
00:46:38,501 --> 00:46:41,820
Do you know what I felt
when my mechanical army

958
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,244
had conquered the land

959
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:46,718
and I was the only non-toy left?

960
00:46:46,718 --> 00:46:48,403
Victorious?

961
00:46:48,403 --> 00:46:49,802
Triumphant?

962
00:46:49,802 --> 00:46:52,802
Because I had fought the good fight?

963
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:55,258
No.

964
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,690
I felt lonely,

965
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:03,024
incredibly, horribly lonely.

966
00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:09,824
That's why I changed my ways, Josh,

967
00:47:09,824 --> 00:47:12,968
and changed all the toys
into the fun-loving creatures

968
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:14,135
you see today.

969
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,849
Ultimately, war achieves nothing.

970
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:20,682
Never has, never will.

971
00:47:21,744 --> 00:47:22,577
- Yeah.

972
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,846
You're right, I don't need this thing.

973
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:27,573
(boings)

974
00:47:27,573 --> 00:47:29,656
(laughs)

975
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:35,199
You know, I do think, though,

976
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,546
there are some things worth fighting for.

977
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:39,192
Like the Nullifier.

978
00:47:39,192 --> 00:47:40,849
I've gotta do everything I can

979
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:42,783
to keep those components
from being put together.

980
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:44,568
I've got to!

981
00:47:44,568 --> 00:47:47,501
- Well then perhaps we should
each pursue our own method

982
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:50,888
of defeating Dr. Zoetrope, huh?

983
00:47:50,888 --> 00:47:52,555
- Yeah, yeah, maybe.

984
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:55,551
Look, you go, you go follow your plan,

985
00:47:55,551 --> 00:47:59,087
and I'll try and figure out my plan.

986
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,254
- Sounds like a good plan.

987
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:04,661
(birds hoot and chirp)

988
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:06,171
(laughing)

989
00:48:06,171 --> 00:48:09,272
- Let's get going, you
lazy toys and animals.

990
00:48:09,272 --> 00:48:10,689
Move it, move it!

991
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,031
Come on, let's take up the slack.

992
00:48:15,031 --> 00:48:17,528
Let's get moving, you lazy toys!

993
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,487
(yells)
(whip snaps)

994
00:48:19,487 --> 00:48:21,214
Rollin', rollin', rollin',

995
00:48:21,214 --> 00:48:23,260
let's keep those toys a rollin'!

996
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,508
Come on, let's move that wagon, boys!

997
00:48:25,508 --> 00:48:27,880
Let's go, ah!
(whip snaps)

998
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,800
Think of this as an
exercise in discipline,

999
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,379
my erstwhile equals.

1000
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:34,451
You get to exercise, I get to discipline.

1001
00:48:34,451 --> 00:48:35,562
Hah!

1002
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:38,536
(laughs)
(whip snaps)

1003
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:40,537
- Let's see what this primitive inventor

1004
00:48:40,537 --> 00:48:44,395
has to offer the greatest
intellect of the 25th century.

1005
00:48:44,395 --> 00:48:45,982
Hmm.

1006
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:47,723
Possibly useful.

1007
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:49,520
A remote hologram projection device

1008
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,400
with a bizarre voice activated code.

1009
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,979
Crystal, crystal in my claw,

1010
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:57,091
where's the one I'm searching for?

1011
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:59,834
(tense instrumental music)

1012
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:03,306
Crystal, I think we'll
widen out for a full shot.

1013
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:06,889
(tense instrumental music)

1014
00:49:09,518 --> 00:49:13,553
Action Jack, adjust course
to the following coordinates.

1015
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:16,053
(birds chirp)

1016
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:19,438
- Ah.

1017
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:27,714
Boy, a pink egg.

1018
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,112
(chuckles)

1019
00:49:30,112 --> 00:49:33,529
That's something you don't see every day.

1020
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:36,300
(yells)

1021
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,195
(playful music)

1022
00:49:39,195 --> 00:49:41,007
(chuckles)

1023
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:42,802
That was a close one.

1024
00:49:42,802 --> 00:49:44,724
- [Theo] What?
(Yells)

1025
00:49:44,724 --> 00:49:46,807
(groans)

1026
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:51,746
- Don't ever sneak up
on me like that again!

1027
00:49:51,746 --> 00:49:53,294
- I'm sorry, I was just, uh--

1028
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:54,912
- Look what you made me do!

1029
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:59,079
You think it's easy climbing
trees to get all these eggs?

1030
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:01,398
Say,

1031
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,815
do you realize where you are?

1032
00:50:05,195 --> 00:50:09,278
This is rather brave of
you to venture this close

1033
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:12,514
in Nightmare Forest.

1034
00:50:13,754 --> 00:50:17,279
- I thought perhaps I could help.

1035
00:50:17,279 --> 00:50:18,446
- Oh, you did?

1036
00:50:21,025 --> 00:50:23,358
Well that's wonderful, Theo.

1037
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:26,341
And it is brave, too.

1038
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:29,715
Come on, you can help me.

1039
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,380
We've got to stand by our friends,

1040
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,297
even if it's difficult or scary or.

1041
00:50:37,345 --> 00:50:39,579
- Or we have to fight?

1042
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:43,022
- Yes, sometimes we even have to fight.

1043
00:50:43,022 --> 00:50:44,393
I don't like it,

1044
00:50:44,393 --> 00:50:46,491
but I know it's what we have to do

1045
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:48,209
when faced with evil.

1046
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:51,830
(gentle chiming music)

1047
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,997
(Theo softly talks)
(playful music)

1048
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:03,599
(clicking)
(playful music)

1049
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:10,932
- [Theo] Mmm.

1050
00:51:12,841 --> 00:51:15,419
(thuds)
(groans)

1051
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:16,502
- It slipped.

1052
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:18,325
Sorry.

1053
00:51:20,574 --> 00:51:23,760
Hey, you're not eating
that stuff, are you?

1054
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,341
- Uh, no, mm-mm.

1055
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:27,752
- Come over here and give me a hand.

1056
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,419
(playful music)

1057
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,003
- [Theo] What, what?

1058
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:34,834
- Push down on this spring here.

1059
00:51:34,834 --> 00:51:37,501
(playful music)

1060
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:41,161
- Oh, oh.

1061
00:51:41,161 --> 00:51:45,082
(thuds)
(yells)

1062
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:46,606
(groans)
Uh-oh.

1063
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:48,599
(groans)

1064
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:50,721
I'm sorry, I forgot we were--

1065
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:54,617
- Um, look, uh, maybe you
should go and help Josh, huh?

1066
00:51:54,617 --> 00:51:56,004
- But I wanted to help you.

1067
00:51:56,004 --> 00:51:59,754
- Well, you'll be helping
me by helping Josh.

1068
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,166
He went that way.

1069
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:06,333
(footsteps crunch)
(birds chirp)

1070
00:52:07,195 --> 00:52:09,611
(Prism squeals)
- Prism,

1071
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:12,012
Prism, get ahold of yourself.

1072
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:13,497
What's a matter, you're
having an allergic reaction

1073
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,538
or something?
(Azabeth chants)

1074
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:16,815
You are,

1075
00:52:16,815 --> 00:52:19,391
you are having an allergic
reaction to the vibrations

1076
00:52:19,391 --> 00:52:21,377
of Azabeth's chanting.

1077
00:52:21,377 --> 00:52:23,627
(chanting)

1078
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:28,813
Doesn't one of the 21 codes
mention something about

1079
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,230
enough is enough?

1080
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:34,628
- Of course not.

1081
00:52:34,628 --> 00:52:38,907
Kang never would have endorsed
such a weakness of spirit.

1082
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:41,897
(chanting)

1083
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:42,730
Although,

1084
00:52:43,805 --> 00:52:46,887
it may have been referred
to in the 13th code.

1085
00:52:46,887 --> 00:52:47,739
- May have?

1086
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:51,704
- We can never know, for number
13 is the lost code of Kang.

1087
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:54,871
(chanting in Kangian)

1088
00:52:56,916 --> 00:53:01,083
(groans)
(chanting)

1089
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:06,651
(dramatic instrumental music)

1090
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:08,777
- Oh, this is great.

1091
00:53:08,777 --> 00:53:10,987
Gepetto tells me there's
an old shortwave radio

1092
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,056
back at his tower in Toy World,

1093
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,782
and I figure maybe I can
use it to communicate

1094
00:53:14,782 --> 00:53:16,802
with the time pod, but, no,

1095
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:21,092
instead I get lost and have
no idea as to where I'm going.

1096
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:24,109
There's got to be some way
out of this crazy place.

1097
00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:27,942
(dramatic instrumental music)

1098
00:53:29,427 --> 00:53:31,923
(crunching)

1099
00:53:31,923 --> 00:53:35,756
(dramatic instrumental music)

1100
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:44,109
(thuds)

1101
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:45,692
- Mmm, scrumptious.

1102
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:48,818
I would prefer a touch more rust,

1103
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:52,328
but uninvited guests
shouldn't make much fuss.

1104
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:55,580
- G-G-Go ahead, y-you might as
well have the rest of these.

1105
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,006
(yells)

1106
00:53:57,006 --> 00:53:58,954
- Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are done.

1107
00:53:58,954 --> 00:54:01,219
Now it's time for riddle fun.

1108
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:03,440
(tense music)

1109
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,224
Answer right, you'll learn the score.

1110
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:08,174
Answer wrong, you'll be no more.

1111
00:54:08,174 --> 00:54:09,847
- [Josh] What's the question?

1112
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:11,697
- How do you think one
would get to Toy World

1113
00:54:11,697 --> 00:54:13,644
without the proper attire?

1114
00:54:13,644 --> 00:54:14,811
- Well, I, uh.

1115
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:16,754
- Answer!

1116
00:54:17,951 --> 00:54:22,190
- Okay, okay, just a
second, I, I know this one.

1117
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,369
It's easy really.

1118
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:25,838
How does one get to Toy World?

1119
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:29,155
Oh, yeah, yeah, there's no doubt about it.

1120
00:54:29,155 --> 00:54:30,477
It's to run!

1121
00:54:30,477 --> 00:54:34,644
(exciting dramatic music)
(laughing)

1122
00:54:39,853 --> 00:54:42,719
(groans)

1123
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:44,452
(thuds)

1124
00:54:44,452 --> 00:54:47,508
(exciting instrumental music)

1125
00:54:47,508 --> 00:54:50,608
- Not bad, young friend,
but you know the refrain,

1126
00:54:50,608 --> 00:54:53,504
without pain there is no gain.

1127
00:54:53,504 --> 00:54:56,178
(dramatic instrumental music)

1128
00:54:56,178 --> 00:54:58,921
- Well isn't there some
way we can talk this out?

1129
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,730
- Another riddle, you want?

1130
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,993
Until I shall rhyme,

1131
00:55:01,993 --> 00:55:04,681
who would you wager is a warrior of time?

1132
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:07,162
- Warrior of time,
let's see, uh, Zoetrope?

1133
00:55:07,162 --> 00:55:10,370
- (laughs) Sorry, strike one.

1134
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:12,346
- Then it's gotta be Irwin, right?

1135
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:13,650
Yeah, Iriwn 1138.

1136
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:18,012
- (laughs) Nice try, strike two!

1137
00:55:18,012 --> 00:55:19,877
- But there's no one else!

1138
00:55:19,877 --> 00:55:21,605
(yells)

1139
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:23,634
(dramatic instrumental music)

1140
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:26,597
- (laughs) Time's up, little pup!

1141
00:55:26,597 --> 00:55:28,160
- Just a second, okay?

1142
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,405
(yells)
(dramatic music)

1143
00:55:30,405 --> 00:55:34,014
Whoa, whoa, don't I get one more strike?

1144
00:55:34,014 --> 00:55:37,333
- Ah, shall I truly be
forced to follow this course?

1145
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,771
- Yes, a final request for the condemned

1146
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:40,389
is absolutely mandatory.

1147
00:55:40,389 --> 00:55:41,557
Whoa.

1148
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:43,321
- Last chance, young friend.

1149
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:44,492
So do we attend,

1150
00:55:44,492 --> 00:55:46,439
the one who is a warrior of time

1151
00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:49,319
is the same one who
arrived improperly attired,

1152
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:52,337
and he's staring into your eyes right now.

1153
00:55:52,337 --> 00:55:53,967
- Yeah, but there's no one else here!

1154
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,217
Except you and,

1155
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:57,121
(dramatic music)

1156
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:58,492
and me.

1157
00:55:58,492 --> 00:56:00,236
(zapping)

1158
00:56:00,236 --> 00:56:02,319
(groans)

1159
00:56:04,323 --> 00:56:05,311
- Good guess.

1160
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:08,061
(dramatic music)

1161
00:56:09,371 --> 00:56:11,318
- How did you get there?

1162
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:12,950
- Josh, I've told you before.

1163
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:15,213
The universe is in peril and
I must do all that is possible

1164
00:56:15,213 --> 00:56:16,046
to save it.

1165
00:56:16,046 --> 00:56:17,421
- Save it?

1166
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:20,588
Oh, jeez, first Mr. Troll and now you?

1167
00:56:22,035 --> 00:56:24,130
Except Mr. Troll kind of went to pieces.

1168
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,723
- His job was done.

1169
00:56:25,723 --> 00:56:27,576
He gave what you asked for.

1170
00:56:27,576 --> 00:56:29,085
- Excuse me?

1171
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,715
I asked for that?

1172
00:56:30,715 --> 00:56:32,498
A near death experience?

1173
00:56:32,498 --> 00:56:34,116
- Your clue, remember?

1174
00:56:34,116 --> 00:56:36,738
Evidently Nightmare Forest
saw fit to send you one,

1175
00:56:36,738 --> 00:56:38,738
albeit unconventionally.

1176
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,462
- Oh okay,

1177
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:46,226
so I'm some kind of warrior
who doesn't know how to dress?

1178
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:49,188
Oh, now I understand everything.

1179
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:51,886
- Joshua, don't you wonder
how you can still exist

1180
00:56:51,886 --> 00:56:54,053
without your CDL bracelet?

1181
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,016
(tense music)

1182
00:56:57,016 --> 00:56:58,543
- Yeah, every now and then.

1183
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:00,749
- It's impossible for you
to be here without one.

1184
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:02,313
I believe that's the proper attire

1185
00:57:02,313 --> 00:57:05,538
your frightful friend was referring to.

1186
00:57:05,538 --> 00:57:07,265
- Yeah, but if it's impossible?

1187
00:57:07,265 --> 00:57:08,664
- How can you still exist?

1188
00:57:08,664 --> 00:57:10,530
There's only one possible answer,

1189
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,818
however improbable it may be,

1190
00:57:12,818 --> 00:57:16,507
and that answer saved
your neck a minute ago.

1191
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:18,470
- What are you saying?

1192
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,970
- You, Josh Kirby,

1193
00:57:20,881 --> 00:57:22,798
you are a time warrior.

1194
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:26,322
- Oh, a time warrior, oh.

1195
00:57:28,163 --> 00:57:31,319
- One in a billion,
young Kirby, that's you.

1196
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:33,062
A mere mortal with the awesome ability

1197
00:57:33,062 --> 00:57:35,778
to traverse the time stream with ease,

1198
00:57:35,778 --> 00:57:37,862
even bend it at your own will.

1199
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:41,291
A gladiator whose arena is
the temporal web itself.

1200
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,208
Unlike the other 999,999,999 of us,

1201
00:57:47,337 --> 00:57:49,956
the molecules of your body
are not time specific.

1202
00:57:49,956 --> 00:57:53,259
Therefore, unlimited in their
movement across the length

1203
00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:56,102
and breadth of the time stream.

1204
00:57:56,102 --> 00:57:58,187
It's quite remarkable, isn't it?

1205
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:00,628
What's even more remarkable
is why nature would choose you

1206
00:58:00,628 --> 00:58:04,468
to bestow such a profound
a natural gift upon.

1207
00:58:04,468 --> 00:58:07,105
That one really escapes me.

1208
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:07,938
Perhaps,

1209
00:58:09,188 --> 00:58:11,998
it's connected to a
pathetically high quotient

1210
00:58:11,998 --> 00:58:13,915
of temporal immaturity.

1211
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:19,787
Your temporal senses are so undeveloped

1212
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,942
that they can fit in anywhere.

1213
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:25,865
- Then that's how I transported
myself out of limbo.

1214
00:58:25,865 --> 00:58:27,784
And that means I can zap
myself to the time pod

1215
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:29,168
any time I want, right?

1216
00:58:29,168 --> 00:58:31,088
- Unfortunately, Josh,
although you do seem

1217
00:58:31,088 --> 00:58:34,121
to possess the powers to utterly
control the forces of time,

1218
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:37,287
they are subject to certain limitations.

1219
00:58:37,287 --> 00:58:38,631
- Such as?

1220
00:58:38,631 --> 00:58:40,676
- It's quite complicated.

1221
00:58:40,676 --> 00:58:43,540
It has do to with
chrono-quantum recharging,

1222
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,214
but those are limits you're
going to have to discover

1223
00:58:45,214 --> 00:58:46,366
on your own,

1224
00:58:46,366 --> 00:58:49,810
kind of like a babe learning
to walk for the first time.

1225
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,413
You see, even a time warrior

1226
00:58:51,413 --> 00:58:52,892
whose powers are checked and balanced

1227
00:58:52,892 --> 00:58:54,622
by the higher laws of the universe

1228
00:58:54,622 --> 00:58:57,709
is a very powerful being indeed.

1229
00:58:57,709 --> 00:59:00,709
That is why I'm offering you a deal.

1230
00:59:02,412 --> 00:59:03,707
- You are?

1231
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,118
- Equal partnership.

1232
00:59:05,118 --> 00:59:07,614
With my intellect and
your mastery of time,

1233
00:59:07,614 --> 00:59:10,494
we can reassemble the Nullifier posthaste.

1234
00:59:10,494 --> 00:59:12,235
(dramatic music)

1235
00:59:12,235 --> 00:59:14,977
- Do you really believe I would
help you destroy everything

1236
00:59:14,977 --> 00:59:17,459
that ever was, is, and will be?

1237
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:20,341
If you do, you're not as
smart as you think you are.

1238
00:59:20,341 --> 00:59:22,661
- That old imbecile Irvin 1138

1239
00:59:22,661 --> 00:59:24,745
is not trying to save the universe,

1240
00:59:24,745 --> 00:59:27,128
he's trying to save his job,

1241
00:59:27,128 --> 00:59:29,145
and he will do anything to achieve that.

1242
00:59:29,145 --> 00:59:31,971
As long as the Nullifier
component remains inactive,

1243
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:34,576
the Supreme Prefect controls everything

1244
00:59:34,576 --> 00:59:35,659
and everyone.

1245
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:39,564
Join me and I'll prove it to you.

1246
00:59:40,434 --> 00:59:44,219
I'm offering you a pact of ultimate power.

1247
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:46,672
(tense music)

1248
00:59:46,672 --> 00:59:48,059
- Ah, what the heck?

1249
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:51,323
Maybe you're right, I mean,
we could be some team.

1250
00:59:51,323 --> 00:59:52,914
- I can see it now.

1251
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:54,497
Zoetrope and Kirby.

1252
00:59:56,258 --> 00:59:57,632
- Oh, really?

1253
00:59:57,632 --> 00:59:58,837
Well don't you think, uh,

1254
00:59:58,837 --> 01:00:01,179
Kirby and Zoetrope kind of
has a better ring to it?

1255
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:02,402
- No.

1256
01:00:02,402 --> 01:00:04,254
- Well, I guess I might
just have to reconsider.

1257
01:00:04,254 --> 01:00:07,189
(dramatic music)

1258
01:00:07,189 --> 01:00:09,179
- Well does that mean the deal's off?

1259
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:12,784
Pity, but a refusal was
not entirely unexpected,

1260
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:14,236
as you can see.

1261
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,722
- No, wait, Dr. Zoetrope, I can't hang on!

1262
01:00:16,722 --> 01:00:18,709
(groans)
(dramatic music)

1263
01:00:18,709 --> 01:00:20,629
- I really wish I could help you, Joshua,

1264
01:00:20,629 --> 01:00:22,631
but as you probably figured out by now,

1265
01:00:22,631 --> 01:00:24,375
I'm just a holographic image.

1266
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,076
- Oh, oh, this is bad.

1267
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:27,514
(groans)

1268
01:00:27,514 --> 01:00:28,940
And this is worse.

1269
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,586
(dramatic music)

1270
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:32,917
All right, I've gotta do something.

1271
01:00:32,917 --> 01:00:34,920
I'm a time warrior, right?

1272
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,087
Right, I, I hereby summon my powers to

1273
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:41,472
transport me to the time pod.

1274
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:43,611
(tense music)

1275
01:00:43,611 --> 01:00:46,878
Okay, okay, maybe Zoetrope was wrong.

1276
01:00:46,878 --> 01:00:48,620
Maybe I'm not a time anything.

1277
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,323
Maybe I'm just plain old Josh Kirby

1278
01:00:50,323 --> 01:00:52,172
about to meet his maker.

1279
01:00:52,172 --> 01:00:53,005
Oh!

1280
01:00:53,005 --> 01:00:54,353
(dramatic instrumental music)

1281
01:00:54,353 --> 01:00:55,422
If there's some way out of here,

1282
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:57,781
anything, somebody please show it to me.

1283
01:00:57,781 --> 01:01:00,767
- I say, old bean, are you
down there for the view?

1284
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:01,600
- What?

1285
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,729
The view sucks!

1286
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:03,729
Help me out!

1287
01:01:05,354 --> 01:01:09,521
(exciting music)
(groans)

1288
01:01:13,615 --> 01:01:14,920
Solid ground,

1289
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,745
I'll never leave you again.

1290
01:01:17,745 --> 01:01:19,458
Thanks a million, Theo.

1291
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,350
But, I thought Annie
said toys couldn't enter

1292
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,714
Nightmare Forest.

1293
01:01:22,714 --> 01:01:24,511
- I was just too hungry to keep up.

1294
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:25,550
(bells jingle)

1295
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,925
Hey, what's that?

1296
01:01:26,925 --> 01:01:29,652
- I don't know, it
sounds like sleigh bells.

1297
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,433
(bells jingle)

1298
01:01:31,433 --> 01:01:33,664
- [Jack] Push, you
weak-kneed little sissies!

1299
01:01:33,664 --> 01:01:35,654
I'll whip the stuffing out of ya!

1300
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:38,055
Ha! (laughs)

1301
01:01:38,055 --> 01:01:40,071
(whip snaps)
(dramatic music)

1302
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:40,988
- Zoetrope.

1303
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:43,774
You know the way back to Toy World, right?

1304
01:01:43,774 --> 01:01:46,750
- Like the back of my paw, mate.

1305
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,329
Oh, let's hustle!

1306
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,590
(dramatic instrumental music)

1307
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:55,049
(footsteps thud)
(dramatic music)

1308
01:01:55,049 --> 01:01:56,393
- He's gone.

1309
01:01:56,393 --> 01:01:57,420
No sign of a body,

1310
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,657
no sign of the Nullifier
component, nothing.

1311
01:01:59,657 --> 01:02:04,238
- Hey, Doc, (chuckles) nothing
escapes my new and improved

1312
01:02:04,238 --> 01:02:06,085
plastic tracking ability.

1313
01:02:06,085 --> 01:02:08,940
They are headed back to Toy World.

1314
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,309
- Blast it!

1315
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,121
I cannot allow Josh to escape

1316
01:02:12,121 --> 01:02:14,249
with the Nullifier component again.

1317
01:02:14,249 --> 01:02:17,376
- This Josh Kirby, this
non-toy, is our friend.

1318
01:02:17,376 --> 01:02:20,131
He only wants to get back
home to where he belongs.

1319
01:02:20,131 --> 01:02:22,642
It's that nasty maniac, Dr. Zoetrope,

1320
01:02:22,642 --> 01:02:24,380
who's been causing all the problems.

1321
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,674
He's the one we have to watch out for.

1322
01:02:26,674 --> 01:02:27,797
And furthermore,

1323
01:02:27,797 --> 01:02:30,871
(exciting music)

1324
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:32,621
oh, Josh, my darling!

1325
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:35,570
You've come back to me!

1326
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:38,876
Oh, I've played this moment
in my mind a thousand times,

1327
01:02:38,876 --> 01:02:42,089
wondering what to say, how
to express my feelings,

1328
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:44,585
and now that you're here it's so obvious

1329
01:02:44,585 --> 01:02:47,120
there is but one true
message for me to give

1330
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,452
from my heart to yours,

1331
01:02:49,452 --> 01:02:50,702
you look awful.

1332
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:52,427
- Annie.

1333
01:02:52,427 --> 01:02:54,445
- And you're kinda smelly.

1334
01:02:54,445 --> 01:02:56,491
- Look, Annie, we don't have much time.

1335
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:57,847
Zoetrope will find us soon,

1336
01:02:57,847 --> 01:03:00,385
so show me to Gepetto's tower, quick!

1337
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:01,824
(playful upbeat music)

1338
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:03,513
An old shortwave radio,

1339
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,569
there's got to be one
around here somewhere.

1340
01:03:06,569 --> 01:03:08,560
(clattering)
(playful music)

1341
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:12,143
- I say, old chap, you
mean this old thing?

1342
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:14,829
- Way to go, Theo!

1343
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:17,342
Oh, no,

1344
01:03:18,238 --> 01:03:20,076
I should've known.

1345
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:22,314
What else would I find in Toy World?

1346
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:24,618
- Oh, don't be blue, Josh.

1347
01:03:24,618 --> 01:03:26,933
This isn't the non-toy
I've grown so fond of

1348
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:28,551
in so short a time.

1349
01:03:28,551 --> 01:03:31,705
The Josh Kirby I've come to
know is a scrappy non-toy

1350
01:03:31,705 --> 01:03:34,684
who doesn't give up no
matter what the odds.

1351
01:03:34,684 --> 01:03:36,204
- Darn straight.

1352
01:03:36,204 --> 01:03:37,795
You're right, Annie.

1353
01:03:37,795 --> 01:03:39,179
Nobody's gonna laugh at Josh Kirby

1354
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:41,679
for giving up without a fight.

1355
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,764
(upbeat rhythmic music)

1356
01:03:44,764 --> 01:03:47,244
- Oh, I've missed you too, Josh,

1357
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:50,204
but don't you think we should dance later?

1358
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:52,852
- Gepetto would never say
he had a shortwave radio

1359
01:03:52,852 --> 01:03:55,062
and mean a toy one,

1360
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:57,969
so there's got to be a real one somewhere.

1361
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:01,386
(playful rhythmic music)

1362
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:07,089
(Theo mumbles)
(playful rhythmic music)

1363
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:23,578
- Does it look like this?

1364
01:04:23,578 --> 01:04:26,748
(playful rhythmic music)

1365
01:04:26,748 --> 01:04:27,581
- Oh!

1366
01:04:29,746 --> 01:04:31,820
Oh, Annie, you're beautiful!

1367
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,653
(bells jingle)
(sighs)

1368
01:04:32,653 --> 01:04:34,372
- What's that sound.
(whip snaps)

1369
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:36,006
(bells jingle)

1370
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:37,432
- Trouble.

1371
01:04:37,432 --> 01:04:41,599
(toys groan)
(dramatic music)

1372
01:04:45,784 --> 01:04:47,661
- [Jack] Whoa!

1373
01:04:47,661 --> 01:04:51,828
(toys groan)
(sad music)

1374
01:04:53,409 --> 01:04:54,242
Fall in!

1375
01:04:55,218 --> 01:04:58,467
- I can't say much for
your troops, Sergeant Jack.

1376
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:00,143
I'll take over from here.

1377
01:05:00,143 --> 01:05:02,211
- Ah, give me a chance, my liege.

1378
01:05:02,211 --> 01:05:03,912
All this lily-livered bunch needs

1379
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:05,796
is a little helping hand,

1380
01:05:05,796 --> 01:05:07,755
a little incentive,

1381
01:05:07,755 --> 01:05:08,742
(groaning)

1382
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:10,059
(squeaks)

1383
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:11,784
a little organization.

1384
01:05:11,784 --> 01:05:14,337
Now you toys on my left,

1385
01:05:14,337 --> 01:05:17,439
you're Infantry A, battering ram division.

1386
01:05:17,439 --> 01:05:20,441
All you toys on my
right, you're Infantry B,

1387
01:05:20,441 --> 01:05:22,073
ladder squad.

1388
01:05:22,073 --> 01:05:23,419
- Pardon me, sir,

1389
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:27,352
but we haven't a
battering ram or a ladder.

1390
01:05:27,352 --> 01:05:28,850
(toys groan)

1391
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:31,483
- Why don't you let me worry about that?

1392
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:33,210
(tense music)
(toys groan)

1393
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:36,293
(playful fast music)

1394
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:42,865
- Theo, organize all the toys

1395
01:05:42,865 --> 01:05:44,675
and get 'em to lock all the buildings.

1396
01:05:44,675 --> 01:05:46,332
- Aye aye, Captain Josh.

1397
01:05:46,332 --> 01:05:49,415
(playful fast music)

1398
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,998
- Here goes something.

1399
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:57,549
Attention, attention,

1400
01:05:57,549 --> 01:06:00,704
this is Josh Kirby calling the time pod.

1401
01:06:00,704 --> 01:06:02,473
Come in, time pod
(static hums)

1402
01:06:02,473 --> 01:06:06,473
(yells)
(thuds)

1403
01:06:09,343 --> 01:06:11,894
- Looks like Chuckles is
all through chuckling.

1404
01:06:11,894 --> 01:06:13,063
(laughs)
(thuds)

1405
01:06:13,063 --> 01:06:16,355
- Repeat, this is Josh Kirby.
(static hums)

1406
01:06:16,355 --> 01:06:18,400
Come in, time pod.

1407
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,071
(yelling)
(gasps)

1408
01:06:20,071 --> 01:06:22,282
- Holy Gepetto, this is terrible!

1409
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:24,943
(clattering)
(yelling)

1410
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:26,585
Poor Chuckles!

1411
01:06:26,585 --> 01:06:30,752
(yelling)
(dramatic music)

1412
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:35,200
(whizzes)

1413
01:06:36,091 --> 01:06:36,924
Yeah!

1414
01:06:36,924 --> 01:06:39,028
Eat sugar, punk!

1415
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:42,237
- Mayday, mayday, this
is a time stream SOS

1416
01:06:42,237 --> 01:06:46,130
for Irwin, Azabeth, and
Prism in the time pod.

1417
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:48,875
Can you hear me, time pod?

1418
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:50,927
Please respond!
(static hums)

1419
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:55,671
(chanting)
(rumbling)

1420
01:06:55,671 --> 01:06:56,921
(sighs)

1421
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:58,213
- I'm afraid it's no use.

1422
01:06:58,213 --> 01:07:00,415
(chanting)

1423
01:07:00,415 --> 01:07:02,379
I said I'm afraid it's no use.

1424
01:07:02,379 --> 01:07:04,219
(chanting)

1425
01:07:04,219 --> 01:07:05,052
I said!

1426
01:07:05,052 --> 01:07:07,452
(chanting)

1427
01:07:07,452 --> 01:07:09,744
(sighs)

1428
01:07:09,744 --> 01:07:11,966
I'm afraid the time may
have come for us to continue

1429
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:15,491
the Nullifier quest without Josh Kirby.

1430
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:19,504
(chanting)
(rumbling)

1431
01:07:19,504 --> 01:07:22,254
(dramatic music)

1432
01:07:23,171 --> 01:07:24,841
- Come on, get on with it.

1433
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:25,788
- Yes, sir!

1434
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:28,147
All right, troops, this way, come on.

1435
01:07:28,147 --> 01:07:29,860
Let's go, let's go.

1436
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:34,027
(dramatic music)
(soft chattering)

1437
01:07:38,838 --> 01:07:41,983
- All right, Irwin, Azabeth, Prism,

1438
01:07:41,983 --> 01:07:45,036
I know you're out there so answer.

1439
01:07:45,036 --> 01:07:46,822
I've got another Nullifier component.

1440
01:07:46,822 --> 01:07:47,889
I need you.

1441
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:49,992
The universe needs you!

1442
01:07:49,992 --> 01:07:51,454
(clattering)

1443
01:07:51,454 --> 01:07:52,287
Oh no.

1444
01:07:52,287 --> 01:07:54,787
(tense music)

1445
01:07:57,835 --> 01:08:00,214
(static scratches)

1446
01:08:00,214 --> 01:08:01,047
Nothing.

1447
01:08:02,873 --> 01:08:06,425
(playful dramatic music)

1448
01:08:06,425 --> 01:08:10,147
I've been stuck in this
cockamamie Toy World all day

1449
01:08:10,147 --> 01:08:13,120
and it's been the worst
12 hours of my life!

1450
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:17,287
- [Annie] 11 hours, 59 minutes,
and 35 seconds, to be exact.

1451
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:20,758
- Really?

1452
01:08:20,758 --> 01:08:23,214
(playful dramatic music)

1453
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:27,274
- We toys wind up, run
on batteries, springs,

1454
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:30,894
we have an excellent sense of time.

1455
01:08:30,894 --> 01:08:32,740
- Look, Annie, I, uh,

1456
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,362
I didn't mean what I said.

1457
01:08:34,362 --> 01:08:35,953
I-I-I just got frustrated.

1458
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:36,786
I'm just.

1459
01:08:36,786 --> 01:08:39,738
(cuckoo clock chimes)

1460
01:08:39,738 --> 01:08:41,155
- 12 hours, Josh.

1461
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,140
(beeps)

1462
01:08:45,193 --> 01:08:47,242
(zinging)

1463
01:08:47,242 --> 01:08:48,075
- Annie!

1464
01:08:48,075 --> 01:08:49,395
Annie, it's working!

1465
01:08:49,395 --> 01:08:51,699
- Josh, what's happening?

1466
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:53,510
- What did Zoetrope say?

1467
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:55,839
Quantum, quantum recharging?

1468
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,228
(beeps)

1469
01:08:57,228 --> 01:08:58,886
Yeah, it's been exactly 12 hours

1470
01:08:58,886 --> 01:09:01,946
since I used my powers to
zap myself out of limbo!

1471
01:09:01,946 --> 01:09:05,509
(beeping)
(dramatic music)

1472
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:08,968
Annie, I need to get outside and higher.

1473
01:09:08,968 --> 01:09:10,422
This signal's not strong enough!

1474
01:09:10,422 --> 01:09:11,659
(beeping)

1475
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:15,826
(dramatic music)
(soft chattering)

1476
01:09:19,601 --> 01:09:22,222
- What are you up to, young Kirby?

1477
01:09:22,222 --> 01:09:23,935
(dramatic music)

1478
01:09:23,935 --> 01:09:25,224
- Yes!

1479
01:09:25,224 --> 01:09:27,198
- Lieutenant Jack, on the roof!

1480
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,107
Primary target sighted!

1481
01:09:29,107 --> 01:09:30,396
(dramatic music)
- Infantry B!

1482
01:09:30,396 --> 01:09:31,933
Routine 64, now!

1483
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:34,293
Come on, you three,
you've just been drafted.

1484
01:09:34,293 --> 01:09:35,226
In we go.

1485
01:09:35,226 --> 01:09:37,079
Let's get to work!
(claps)

1486
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:39,301
(chattering)
(dramatic music)

1487
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:41,178
Pick up the pace, ya lazy muffin heads.

1488
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:42,824
This ain't no picnic.

1489
01:09:42,824 --> 01:09:46,789
(chattering)
(dramatic music)

1490
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:47,871
(beeping)

1491
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:48,871
- All right.

1492
01:09:49,943 --> 01:09:52,631
This is Josh Kirby, time warrior,

1493
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:54,359
calling the time pod.

1494
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:57,471
Do you hear me?
(static zings and beeps)

1495
01:09:57,471 --> 01:09:59,308
I've got another component.

1496
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:00,808
Please, answer me!

1497
01:10:01,775 --> 01:10:05,166
- Come on, get up there before
I dismantle every one of you.

1498
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,824
Get up there!

1499
01:10:06,824 --> 01:10:08,689
- How about some dessert?

1500
01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:10,255
(gooey plopping)
(playful music)

1501
01:10:10,255 --> 01:10:14,422
(laughing)
(playful music)

1502
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,124
(beeping)

1503
01:10:18,124 --> 01:10:20,278
- We're holdin' off the
forces of evil here,

1504
01:10:20,278 --> 01:10:22,817
but we need some serious backup.

1505
01:10:22,817 --> 01:10:24,626
Josh to the time pod!

1506
01:10:24,626 --> 01:10:27,013
You've gotta come through for me!

1507
01:10:27,013 --> 01:10:29,874
(chanting)
- Booster rockets primed,

1508
01:10:29,874 --> 01:10:32,182
chrono circuits set.

1509
01:10:32,182 --> 01:10:36,349
(beeping)
(chanting)

1510
01:10:41,027 --> 01:10:42,385
(beeping)

1511
01:10:42,385 --> 01:10:43,218
- Hello?

1512
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,090
Can you hear me out there?

1513
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:47,528
(beeping)

1514
01:10:47,528 --> 01:10:49,611
- [Irwin] Will engage in 30 seconds.

1515
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:51,550
Prepare for the storm.

1516
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:52,383
- Irwin.

1517
01:10:53,251 --> 01:10:57,418
(beeping)
(tense music)

1518
01:10:58,725 --> 01:11:01,644
All right, it's now or never, folks.

1519
01:11:01,644 --> 01:11:04,291
Let's see what this time
warrior stuff is all about.

1520
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:05,708
Come in time pod!

1521
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:10,531
(dramatic music)
(zinging)

1522
01:11:10,531 --> 01:11:11,904
Cool.

1523
01:11:11,904 --> 01:11:13,229
- It's true.

1524
01:11:13,229 --> 01:11:15,799
He is a time warrior.

1525
01:11:15,799 --> 01:11:16,842
- [Josh] Hello?

1526
01:11:16,842 --> 01:11:19,020
Come in time pod.
(chanting)

1527
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,910
- Wait a minute.

1528
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,135
- What is it?

1529
01:11:22,135 --> 01:11:23,934
- [Azabeth] Who turned down the radio?

1530
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:26,634
- Time pod doesn't have a
(beeping)

1531
01:11:26,634 --> 01:11:27,856
radio.

1532
01:11:27,856 --> 01:11:30,145
- [Josh] Hello, hello!

1533
01:11:30,145 --> 01:11:32,812
Josh to time pod, please answer!

1534
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,137
- Josh Kirby!

1535
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:36,602
- Astounding.

1536
01:11:36,602 --> 01:11:38,332
Let me try and locate the source.

1537
01:11:38,332 --> 01:11:40,828
Prism, Prism, assist me, quickly!

1538
01:11:40,828 --> 01:11:43,578
(dramatic music)

1539
01:11:51,175 --> 01:11:53,425
- Enough of this spectacle.

1540
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:55,385
(thuds)

1541
01:11:55,385 --> 01:11:57,907
(yells)

1542
01:11:57,907 --> 01:11:58,740
- Josh!

1543
01:11:58,740 --> 01:11:59,954
- [Theo] Are you all right?

1544
01:11:59,954 --> 01:12:03,150
- Thanks a lot, Theo, sorry about that.

1545
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:04,960
- There, there.

1546
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,115
(toys chatter)

1547
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:08,267
- No.

1548
01:12:08,267 --> 01:12:10,857
- Josh, hand me the Nullifier component.

1549
01:12:10,857 --> 01:12:11,845
- Never!

1550
01:12:11,845 --> 01:12:13,767
- I'll get it for you myself, sir liege.

1551
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:15,934
(zinging)

1552
01:12:18,128 --> 01:12:19,745
(toys gasp and cheer)

1553
01:12:19,745 --> 01:12:21,532
- Come on, guys.

1554
01:12:21,532 --> 01:12:24,380
(toys chatter)

1555
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,704
- [Zoetrope] Blast.

1556
01:12:26,704 --> 01:12:27,704
- All right!

1557
01:12:28,704 --> 01:12:31,831
- [Irwin] Josh, Josh, are you all right?

1558
01:12:31,831 --> 01:12:33,849
- Never better, Irwin old pal.

1559
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,877
Looks like you came right in time.

1560
01:12:36,877 --> 01:12:39,952
- Hey, infantry, let's
attack this alien spaceship!

1561
01:12:39,952 --> 01:12:41,543
Let's go, let's go!

1562
01:12:41,543 --> 01:12:43,627
- What if we don't want to?

1563
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:44,846
- Excuse me?

1564
01:12:44,846 --> 01:12:47,658
- Maybe we're tired of being your slaves.

1565
01:12:47,658 --> 01:12:49,909
(soft chattering)

1566
01:12:49,909 --> 01:12:52,033
- Do you have anything better to do?

1567
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:52,866
(playful music)

1568
01:12:52,866 --> 01:12:55,178
- [Chuckles] Why, yes, I think we do.

1569
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:57,801
(playful music)

1570
01:12:57,801 --> 01:13:01,912
♫ We are the toys of Toy World
- Oh, my, no!

1571
01:13:01,912 --> 01:13:05,093
♫ Happiness and joy world
- Yes!

1572
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:08,549
♫ A toy for every boy and girl

1573
01:13:08,549 --> 01:13:11,132
♫ In Toy World

1574
01:13:12,362 --> 01:13:15,542
(playful music)

1575
01:13:15,542 --> 01:13:19,246
(toys laugh)
(Prism mumbles)

1576
01:13:19,246 --> 01:13:22,812
- I fail to grasp the
meaning of this ritual.

1577
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:24,364
- Catchy tune though.

1578
01:13:24,364 --> 01:13:26,750
♫ Happiness and joy world

1579
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:30,261
♫ Toy World, Toy World

(playful upbeat music)

1582
01:13:44,866 --> 01:13:47,609
- Ah, I can't take it anymore!

1583
01:13:47,609 --> 01:13:49,609
(thuds)

1584
01:13:50,463 --> 01:13:51,641
- Oh!

1585
01:13:51,641 --> 01:13:53,817
Oh, nice right hook!

1586
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:55,090
I mean paw.

1587
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:55,970
- Give me five.

1588
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,672
- [Annie] Josh, help me!

1589
01:13:58,672 --> 01:14:01,676
- Turn off that music and
give me the Nullifier, Josh,

1590
01:14:01,676 --> 01:14:04,983
or this raggedy Annie
gets a lot raggedier.

1591
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:07,650
(playful music)

1592
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:14,583
- Yeah, turn off the music.

1593
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:17,931
(music screeches)
(toys groan)

1594
01:14:17,931 --> 01:14:19,632
- The Nullifier, Josh,

1595
01:14:19,632 --> 01:14:21,977
before I am forced to
do something irreparable

1596
01:14:21,977 --> 01:14:23,621
to this lovely toy.

1597
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:26,903
(dramatic music)

1598
01:14:26,903 --> 01:14:28,466
(clicking)

1599
01:14:28,466 --> 01:14:31,017
(clattering)

1600
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:32,469
- Gepetto!

1601
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:35,219
(exciting music)

1602
01:14:39,931 --> 01:14:43,403
- Release that toy this
instant, you brute.

1603
01:14:43,403 --> 01:14:45,169
- Nice bluff, toy maker.

1604
01:14:45,169 --> 01:14:46,941
Too bad we both know
those weapons are useless

1605
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:48,679
under your energy field.

1606
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:50,683
- But they're not weapons,

1607
01:14:50,683 --> 01:14:53,743
at least not in the conventional sense.

1608
01:14:53,743 --> 01:14:56,843
(dramatic music)

1609
01:14:56,843 --> 01:14:58,351
Bombs away!

1610
01:14:58,351 --> 01:15:00,768
(toys cheer)

1611
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:04,635
- [Zoetrope] What's going on here?

1612
01:15:04,635 --> 01:15:07,553
(playful music)

1613
01:15:07,553 --> 01:15:09,517
(toys cheer)

1614
01:15:09,517 --> 01:15:10,818
The next one that hits me!

1615
01:15:10,818 --> 01:15:13,301
- Come on, get up and fight like toys!

1616
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:15,904
(playful music)
(toys cheer)

1617
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:18,031
- Do you hear me?

1618
01:15:18,031 --> 01:15:19,375
Do you hear me?

1619
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:21,322
(playful music)

1620
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:23,583
I'm coming for your first, pinhead.

1621
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:27,750
(playful music)
(yelling and cheering)

1622
01:15:29,054 --> 01:15:30,013
Stop it!

1623
01:15:30,013 --> 01:15:32,539
Desist this this minute!

1624
01:15:32,539 --> 01:15:35,621
This is gonna block my engines!

1625
01:15:35,621 --> 01:15:36,454
Stop it!

1626
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:40,155
Josh Kirby, Josh Kirby!

1627
01:15:42,063 --> 01:15:43,896
Stop this madness now!

1628
01:15:45,781 --> 01:15:47,343
Will this do, Josh Kirby?

1629
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:49,071
You haven't seen the last of me.

1630
01:15:49,071 --> 01:15:49,988
I swear it!

1631
01:15:51,998 --> 01:15:54,986
(dramatic music)
(zinging)

1632
01:15:54,986 --> 01:15:59,153
(toys cheer and laugh)
(playful music)

1633
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,984
- Uh-oh.

1634
01:16:03,984 --> 01:16:08,151
(playful music)
(toys laugh and cheer)

1635
01:16:14,265 --> 01:16:16,173
(laughs)

1636
01:16:16,173 --> 01:16:18,919
(gooey splattering)

1637
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:21,586
(playful music)

1638
01:16:25,063 --> 01:16:27,313
(laughing)

1639
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:34,209
Perhaps the same sort of
allergic reaction Prism had

1640
01:16:34,209 --> 01:16:37,073
has affected this time and place.

1641
01:16:37,073 --> 01:16:37,990
- Possibly.

1642
01:16:39,586 --> 01:16:41,604
- [Rabbit] I'm gonna get you.

1643
01:16:41,604 --> 01:16:43,854
(laughing)

1644
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:50,542
(playful music)
(laughing)

1645
01:16:52,217 --> 01:16:56,196
- And in recognition of
countless acts of valor,

1646
01:16:56,196 --> 01:16:59,103
executed in the name of friendship,

1647
01:16:59,103 --> 01:17:01,936
I hereby declare you honorary toy.

1648
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:08,071
(cheering)
(Jack groans)

1649
01:17:08,071 --> 01:17:09,511
- Thanks a lot, Gepetto.

1650
01:17:09,511 --> 01:17:11,019
Oh and try and cheer up, will ya?

1651
01:17:11,019 --> 01:17:13,033
(laughs)

1652
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:15,616
(gentle music)

1653
01:17:16,489 --> 01:17:18,150
You take care of yourself, Theo.

1654
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:19,753
- Cheerio, dear boy.

1655
01:17:19,753 --> 01:17:22,336
(gentle music)

1656
01:17:25,978 --> 01:17:27,760
- I'm gonna miss you most of all, Annie.

1657
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,712
- Oh, Josh, you're the only
non-toy I've ever loved.

1658
01:17:31,712 --> 01:17:34,295
(gentle music)

1659
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:38,377
- I think it's high time we departed.

1660
01:17:38,377 --> 01:17:39,556
Don't you?

1661
01:17:39,556 --> 01:17:41,547
- Let's hear it, toys!

1662
01:17:41,547 --> 01:17:43,797
(cheering)

1663
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:46,876
- Thanks a lot, everyone.

1664
01:17:46,876 --> 01:17:49,474
Toy World's been, well, different.

1665
01:17:49,474 --> 01:17:51,502
(cheering)

1666
01:17:51,502 --> 01:17:53,545
I'd love to stay, everyone,

1667
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:55,602
but there are three more
of these deadly components

1668
01:17:55,602 --> 01:17:57,455
to hunt down.

1669
01:17:57,455 --> 01:18:00,205
(exciting music)

1670
01:18:01,305 --> 01:18:03,337
- That is absolutely correct,

1671
01:18:03,337 --> 01:18:06,260
and it is time for a reality check.

1672
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,917
Let's get a move on.

1673
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:09,947
- Nice to see you again, Azabeth.

1674
01:18:09,947 --> 01:18:12,697
(exciting music)

1675
01:18:15,842 --> 01:18:17,654
Bye, everyone!

1676
01:18:17,654 --> 01:18:21,821
(exciting music)
(toys cheer)

1677
01:18:23,381 --> 01:18:24,445
- [Toy] Bye.

1678
01:18:24,445 --> 01:18:25,721
- Bye.

1679
01:18:25,721 --> 01:18:28,905
(exciting music)

1680
01:18:28,905 --> 01:18:31,949
(swooshing)

1681
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:34,782
- A time warrior, are you certain?

1682
01:18:35,981 --> 01:18:37,505
- That's what it looks like.

1683
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,340
I mean, it's not like I'm
suddenly warlike or anything,

1684
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,525
but sending that radio
message felt pretty cool.

1685
01:18:42,525 --> 01:18:45,789
- A just and noble warrior
always is cool headed,

1686
01:18:45,789 --> 01:18:49,091
but in keeping with
the fifth code of Kang,

1687
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:51,451
those who abandon the truth once

1688
01:18:51,451 --> 01:18:53,466
may never find it again.

1689
01:18:53,466 --> 01:18:55,715
Therefore, I must inform you that it was

1690
01:18:55,715 --> 01:18:57,528
the telekinetic astral projections

1691
01:18:57,528 --> 01:19:00,625
of my tech-warrior consciousness

1692
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,248
generated by the Kangian
chant of the forlorn

1693
01:19:03,248 --> 01:19:04,882
that reached out across the time stream

1694
01:19:04,882 --> 01:19:07,838
and enabled you to contact us.

1695
01:19:07,838 --> 01:19:08,671
- What?

1696
01:19:09,736 --> 01:19:12,122
You, you've gotta be kidding.

1697
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:15,840
I mean, I fought a desperate
fight against all odds

1698
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,964
to come up with some sort
of communications device

1699
01:19:17,964 --> 01:19:20,765
that my one in a billion time
warrior powers could work on.

1700
01:19:20,765 --> 01:19:21,818
And you're telling me--

1701
01:19:21,818 --> 01:19:24,120
- Would you two modulate your intercourse?

1702
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,208
If Josh is right,

1703
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:28,045
his newfound powers might
prove invaluable to me,

1704
01:19:28,045 --> 01:19:29,295
uh, I mean, us.

1705
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,121
- Yeah, yeah, wouldn't that be cool?

1706
01:19:34,121 --> 01:19:38,162
If I could walk up to
the time pod view window

1707
01:19:38,162 --> 01:19:40,001
and look out and close my eyes

1708
01:19:40,001 --> 01:19:42,168
and concentrate for a second,

1709
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:44,581
and then be able to open them and say,

1710
01:19:44,581 --> 01:19:46,998
hey, Dr. Zoetrope's after us!

1711
01:19:47,943 --> 01:19:51,838
- Huh, I suppose that
would be a useful talent.

1712
01:19:51,838 --> 01:19:53,821
- Then consider this a free preview,

1713
01:19:53,821 --> 01:19:56,252
'cause Zoetrope really is after us.

1714
01:19:56,252 --> 01:19:57,500
(booming)

1715
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,181
- Commission the fissures to action!

1716
01:19:59,181 --> 01:20:02,170
(zooming)

1717
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,380
Hang on everybody!

1718
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,793
(zooming)
(dramatic music)

1719
01:20:07,793 --> 01:20:10,810
Fear not, I think I've located
a time stream escape route.

1720
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:11,897
Look, it's even locked for us.

1721
01:20:11,897 --> 01:20:13,312
- Step on it, Irwin.

1722
01:20:13,312 --> 01:20:14,145
Turn the pod around.

1723
01:20:14,145 --> 01:20:14,978
- What?

1724
01:20:14,978 --> 01:20:15,888
Zoetrope's right behind us.

1725
01:20:15,888 --> 01:20:17,123
- Irwin, turn it around!

1726
01:20:17,123 --> 01:20:20,005
(rumbling)
(whistle blows)

1727
01:20:20,005 --> 01:20:21,349
- Just because you're a time warrior,

1728
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:22,720
doesn't mean to say you know more

1729
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,363
about temporal navigation than I

1730
01:20:25,363 --> 01:20:26,627
do!

1731
01:20:26,627 --> 01:20:27,715
(dramatic music)

1732
01:20:27,715 --> 01:20:29,619
We're not turning!

1733
01:20:29,619 --> 01:20:31,307
- What are you waiting for?

1734
01:20:31,307 --> 01:20:33,075
Go ahead and use one of
your one in a billion

1735
01:20:33,075 --> 01:20:35,297
time warrior powers and save us!

1736
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,668
(dramatic music)

1737
01:20:37,668 --> 01:20:39,978
- Look, there's something
about chrono-quantum recharging

1738
01:20:39,978 --> 01:20:41,050
and a time limit.

1739
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:43,079
- Oh, well, I might have known.

1740
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:45,052
As the 15th code of Kang clearly states,

1741
01:20:45,052 --> 01:20:46,645
if you lay claim to a title,

1742
01:20:46,645 --> 01:20:49,527
be prepared to defend it at
any hour of the day or night.

1743
01:20:49,527 --> 01:20:51,436
(dramatic music)

1744
01:20:51,436 --> 01:20:53,038
- Sorry.

1745
01:20:53,038 --> 01:20:55,232
(train rumbles)

1746
01:20:55,232 --> 01:20:57,982
(dramatic music)

1747
01:20:59,374 --> 01:21:00,844
- [Narrator] On the next chapter

1748
01:21:00,844 --> 01:21:03,516
of Josh Kirby, Time Warrior.

1749
01:21:03,516 --> 01:21:05,752
(zooming)

1750
01:21:05,752 --> 01:21:09,157
(zinging)
(dramatic music)

1751
01:21:09,157 --> 01:21:10,677
- [Azabeth] They're everywhere!

1752
01:21:10,677 --> 01:21:12,048
- Hey, what are we gonna do?

1753
01:21:12,048 --> 01:21:13,408
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

1754
01:21:13,408 --> 01:21:16,120
- Well think harder, we're in trouble!

1755
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,412
(groans)

1756
01:21:17,412 --> 01:21:18,824
- No!

1757
01:21:18,824 --> 01:21:20,758
(zooming)

1758
01:21:20,758 --> 01:21:23,819
- My beautiful time pod ruined.

1759
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:25,613
- You mean we're stuck here?

1760
01:21:25,613 --> 01:21:28,363
(dramatic music)

1761
01:21:29,341 --> 01:21:31,446
Azabeth, who's this clown?

1762
01:21:31,446 --> 01:21:34,875
- This is Akira Storm, the
keeper of the 21 codes of Kang.

1763
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:36,093
- Take them away.

1764
01:21:36,093 --> 01:21:36,926
- Akira!

1765
01:21:38,068 --> 01:21:40,635
- But you simply have
to get us out of here.

1766
01:21:40,635 --> 01:21:42,097
- I'll see what I can do.

1767
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:42,978
(booming)

1768
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:44,757
- Dreadnaught, the enslaver and his forces

1769
01:21:44,757 --> 01:21:46,111
had us under constant siege.

1770
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:48,324
(booming)

1771
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:50,338
- You know what I want.

1772
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:53,712
The enslavement of your
entire planet. (laughs)

1773
01:21:53,712 --> 01:21:55,099
(yelling)

1774
01:21:55,099 --> 01:21:58,143
(dramatic music)

1775
01:21:58,143 --> 01:21:59,789
(zinging)

1776
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:02,020
- I cannot stand idly by
as my friends rot away

1777
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,640
in some jail cell!

1778
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,000
You must release them.

1779
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,589
(yelling)

1780
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,672
(groans)

1781
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,528
It is a fight to the death.

1782
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:14,404
(yelling)
(clanging)

1783
01:22:14,404 --> 01:22:15,956
- [Josh] Fight to the death?

1784
01:22:15,956 --> 01:22:20,288
(yelling)
(clanging)

1785
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,743
You can't do it!

1786
01:22:21,743 --> 01:22:23,743
(yells)

1787
01:22:24,653 --> 01:22:27,174
(groans)
(thuds)

1788
01:22:27,174 --> 01:22:29,876
(dramatic music)

1789
01:22:29,876 --> 01:22:32,988
(yells)
(clanging)

1790
01:22:32,988 --> 01:22:34,694
- [Azabeth] I hope Josh
Kirby knows what he's doing.

1791
01:22:34,694 --> 01:22:36,395
(booming)

1792
01:22:36,395 --> 01:22:38,658
- I doubt very much that
he knows what he's doing,

1793
01:22:38,658 --> 01:22:40,182
but he has a plan nonetheless.

1794
01:22:40,182 --> 01:22:41,015
- Scram!

1795
01:22:41,015 --> 01:22:42,537
(dramatic music)

1796
01:22:42,537 --> 01:22:44,638
- You realize if you fail,

1797
01:22:44,638 --> 01:22:45,993
you're sending our last means of escape

1798
01:22:45,993 --> 01:22:47,599
right into enemy hands?

1799
01:22:47,599 --> 01:22:48,905
- Run!

1800
01:22:48,905 --> 01:22:51,655
(dramatic music)

1801
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,950
- Relax, pal, I'm a time warrior.

1802
01:22:58,009 --> 01:23:00,759
(exciting music)

1803
01:26:45,512 --> 01:26:48,345
