1
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,911
My name is Mary Lennox.

2
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,072
I was born in India.

3
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,310
It was hot...and strange...

4
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,877
...and lonely in India.

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,638
I didn't like it.

6
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,997
Nobody but my servant...

7
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,270
...my ayah, looked after me.

8
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,991
My parents didn't want me.

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,719
My mother cared only to go to parties...

10
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,197
...and my father was busy
with his military duties.

11
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,438
I was never allowed to go to the parties.

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,194
I watched them
from my mother's bedroom window.

13
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,795
I was angry, but I never cried.

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,116
I didn't know how to cry.

15
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,510
-l left my fan. You didn't have to come.
-l wanted to.

16
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,713
My parents always thought
about themselves.

17
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,111
They never thought about me.

18
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,158
If only I could've known...

19
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,152
...that in a few moments
I would lose them forever.

20
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,913
Earthquake!

21
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,279
The families of the lndian earthquake
orphans should please go to Dock 2.

22
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,959
We're here, Mary! Can you believe it?

23
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,678
She's so sour. l heard that she never cried
when her parents died.

24
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,115
''Mistress Mary, quite contrary....''

25
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,272
Numbers 38 and 39...

26
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,356
...George and Amy Brent.

27
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,232
Numbers 40 and 41...

28
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,036
...Timothy and Thomas Burke.

29
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,592
-Here we are!
-Here we are!

30
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,758
Oh, my boys, my boys.

31
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,671
Number 43, Mary Lennox.

32
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,350
''Mary, Mary, quite contrary

33
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,996
''How does your garden grow?

34
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,792
''With silver bells

35
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,878
''And cockleshells

36
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,475
''And pretty maids all in a row.''

37
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,319
Number 43...

38
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,433
...Mary Lennox.

39
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,556
Please, just step aside.

40
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,719
Number 44...

41
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,393
...Adam Snow.

42
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,079
Mary Lennox?

43
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,472
ls that Mary Lennox?

44
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,914
Number 43.

45
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,393
Yes, Mary Lennox.

46
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,152
l've come to claim her.

47
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,790
l'm Mrs. Medlock,
housekeeper of Misslethwaite Manor...

48
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,152
...for the Lord Archibald Craven...

49
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,912
...her uncle and guardian.

50
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,753
What a queer, unresponsive little thing.

51
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,839
And, my word, a plain piece of quince.

52
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,919
Her mother was a beauty.

53
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,468
She certainly didn't hand much of it down.

54
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,917
She might improve as she gets older.

55
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,513
Children change.

56
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,030
She'll have to change quite a bit.

57
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,876
There's not much to improve her
at Misslethwaite Manor.

58
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,594
Come along.

59
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,038
It's a pity for you that
you haven't any other place to go.

60
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,554
Your uncle won't trouble himself
about you.

61
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,232
That's for sure.

62
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,994
He never troubles himself about anyone.

63
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,078
As if having a crooked back...

64
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,312
...wasn't cross enough for a man to bear,
but she had to up and die on him.

65
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,437
Your aunt is dead.
Didn't your mother tell you?

66
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,908
Strange.

67
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,034
Not telling you that
her own twin sister was dead.

68
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,271
My mother didn't have the time
to tell me stories.

69
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,359
Oh, at last.

70
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,038
There's Misslethwaite.

71
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,559
You'll go straight to bed for a few hours.

72
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,870
You probably haven't gotten much rest.

73
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,429
There's your breakfast.

74
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,556
l'm still in my nightgown.

75
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,669
You can change after you eat.
There are new clothes in the wardrobe.

76
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,193
Who'll dress me?

77
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,429
You can't dress yourself?

78
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,750
Of course not. My ayah dressed me.

79
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,114
Nonsense.

80
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,952
As old as you are?

81
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,350
What do they do with children in lndia?
Carry you around in a basket?

82
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,113
How dare you talk to me
with such disrespect!

83
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,519
Nobody's going to carry you
around Misslethwaite Manor.

84
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,830
We've far too much work already.

85
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,230
So you'll have to look after yourself.

86
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,471
There are 100 rooms here.
This one and no other is yours.

87
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,076
Don't expect to see your uncle
because it's certain you won't.

88
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,039
You are not to touch anything,
or to go wandering and poking about.

89
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,472
The house seemed dead...

90
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,108
...like a spell had been cast upon it.

91
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,509
It looked just like my mother's room.

92
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,390
This must have been my aunt's.

93
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,356
The dressing tables were the same.

94
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,548
They even had twin ivory elephants.

95
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,555
Mother.

96
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,398
What are you doing? What did l tell you?

97
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,678
l heard someone crying.

98
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,556
Dogs.

99
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,676
No, someone! A person crying.

100
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,590
You heard nothing of the sort.

101
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,155
Now...

102
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,995
...you stay where you are told,
or l'll come and box your ears.

103
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,874
Good afternoon.

104
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,276
l brought you something to eat.

105
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,349
You haven't touched your porridge.

106
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,399
Didn't you want it?

107
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,719
Are you my servant?

108
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,910
l'm Mrs. Medlock's servant.

109
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,232
She's Lord Craven's.

110
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,351
But l'll be doing the housemaid's work
up here and waiting on you a bit.

111
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,233
Waiting on me makes you my servant then.

112
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,674
You are strange.

113
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,478
Hey, l know that.

114
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,234
Mrs. Medlock gave me the place
out of kindness to me mother.

115
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,319
She said she could never have done it
if there was a grand missus here.

116
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,515
l'd never be let out of the kitchens...

117
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,910
...and certainly not upstairs.

118
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,468
Stop it!

119
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,309
What're you doing?

120
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,153
l thought all girls liked to be tickled.

121
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,390
What would you like to wear?

122
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,154
Black...

123
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,672
...black or black?

124
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,039
Are you blind?

125
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,992
They're all black.

126
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,548
And l won't be laughed at, servant.

127
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,678
My name's Martha.

128
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,515
l won't tickle you. l promise.

129
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,910
What do they wear in lndia?

130
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,351
When l heard you were coming,
l thought you'd be a native.

131
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,475
What?

132
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,554
You thought l was a what? You....

133
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,349
You....

134
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,351
You daughter of a pig!

135
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,750
You needn't be like that.
l've nothing against natives.

136
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,270
My mother says all of us are family.

137
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,753
l've never seen a native.

138
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,193
l was pleased to think l was.

139
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,750
You don't know anything about anything!
None of you know nothing!

140
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,714
Please.

141
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,633
Don't be vexed.

142
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,789
l don't know anything about anything...

143
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,958
...like you said.

144
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,512
l'm sorry, miss.

145
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,428
l'm too common and l talk too much.

146
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,432
l beg your pardon, miss.

147
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,516
l don't know when exactly
your uncle will call for you.

148
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,434
My uncle?

149
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,240
Mrs. Medlock said
he wouldn't want to see me.

150
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,639
But he does.

151
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,113
Your uncle's decided not to see you today.

152
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,839
When will l see him?

153
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,234
Tomorrow?

154
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,151
No. He'll be gone tomorrow.

155
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,239
After the mistress died ten years ago...

156
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,755
...Lord Craven wouldn't see people.

157
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,429
There's nobody to ease his sorrow.

158
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,513
He spends most of his time
away from home now.

159
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,154
Poor man.

160
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,719
They say he's cursed.

161
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,478
Better put your sweater on.
lt's cold outside.

162
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,670
But l've got no one to play with.

163
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,598
No one to play with?

164
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,348
Let me out of here.

165
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,192
Dickon, my brother...

166
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,238
...goes up on the moor
by himself for hours.

167
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,797
That's how he made friends
with all his animals.

168
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,269
Who?

169
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,914
Dickon...

170
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,719
...me younger brother.

171
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,710
Pull it down!

172
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,360
You have no idea
how curious he is about you.

173
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,796
What do you think you're doing?

174
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,313
There you are!

175
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,437
l wondered where you'd gone.

176
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,638
What do you mean?
You knew perfectly well where l was.

177
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,358
Your scarf, miss.

178
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,275
There.

179
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,671
Thou is ready to go out now.

180
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,399
l can't see.

181
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,876
To get to the gardens...

182
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,470
...you must go through there...

183
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,189
...then around the outside of the house.

184
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,671
Run along now. Have fun.

185
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,952
What's beyond there?

186
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,433
Another garden?

187
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,439
Where's the door?

188
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,034
You there!

189
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,680
-Where's the door to that other garden?
-What?

190
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,392
The one with all the ivy.
l didn't see a door.

191
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,875
There isn't one.

192
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,757
There has to be a door somewhere.

193
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,832
No one's been inside that place
for ten years.

194
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,075
Why?

195
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,149
Why?

196
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,919
Because when she died, the master
gave orders to shut it up forever.

197
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,394
Who died?

198
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,193
My aunt died.

199
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,236
lt was her garden, wasn't it?

200
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,954
Look at me.

201
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,553
Answer me, you!

202
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,598
lt's revolting how these people
behave toward me.

203
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,148
Of course...

204
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,470
...orders couldn't keep him out.

205
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,558
He's the only one goes in there nowadays.

206
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,833
lf you know the way...

207
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,148
...show me.

208
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,154
Who's there?

209
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,719
He hates it.

210
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,110
Why does Lord Craven hate her garden?

211
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,914
-We're not supposed to talk about it.
-Why not?

212
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,991
l've got a present for you.

213
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,316
Mother sent it over to you.

214
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,075
What's it for?

215
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,630
You mean, all they've got is
elephants and tigers in lndia?

216
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,195
They've not got skipping ropes?

217
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,834
Come here.

218
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,789
Watch.

219
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,153
Now, you try.

220
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,236
Thank you, Martha. Thank your mother.

221
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,912
You are strange.

222
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,711
lf you'd been any other child...

223
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,110
-...you'd have given me a kiss.
-Do you want me to kiss you?

224
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,069
What's that?

225
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,832
Go on now, Miss Mary.

226
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,314
Go, go.

227
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,438
l've never skipped before.

228
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,353
Well, he's impressed.

229
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,708
Cheeky little beggar. Look at him.

230
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,074
What about him?

231
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,031
l can't think why, but...

232
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,828
...he's decided to make friends with thee.

233
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,914
He has?

234
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,472
l've never had any friends.

235
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,393
That l believe.

236
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,948
Show me.

237
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,998
Please show me the way in.

238
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,873
Thank you, robin.

239
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,711
l need more.... Martha!

240
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,748
l need more plasters! More towels!

241
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,559
Did you see what l found, pretty robin?

242
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,432
You're getting on well enough
with that this morning.

243
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,919
Tastes nice today.

244
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,075
Listen.

245
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,154
Hear that?

246
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,233
lt's the wind.

247
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,391
Sometimes it sounds like
someone's lost out in the moor...

248
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,279
...and crying.

249
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,356
Poor little Betty Butterworth...

250
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,598
...the scullery maid.

251
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,035
She's had a toothache all morning.

252
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,232
l need your help. Come on.
Get this child outside at once!

253
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,958
Come on, Martha, please!

254
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,275
Soot.

255
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,632
He doesn't know thee. You frightened him.

256
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,358
l frightened him?

257
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,476
Come.

258
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,993
He won't hurt you.

259
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,031
-He'll bite me.
-He won't.

260
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,193
But he's filthy and dirty.

261
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,555
No, he's soft. You'll like it.

262
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,032
There. l did it.

263
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,678
Like that, Miss Mary.

264
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,873
l know you, too.
You're Martha's brother, Dickon.

265
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,435
The robin says he's been waiting for you.

266
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,715
The animals tell me all their secrets.

267
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,631
He wouldn't tell you my secret.

268
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,517
About what, Miss Mary?

269
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,474
A garden.

270
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,558
l've stolen a garden.

271
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,599
Maybe it's dead, anyhow.

272
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,511
-l don't know.
-l'd know.

273
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,918
Promise you won't tell?

274
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,228
Promise.

275
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,755
Nobody?

276
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,029
Not a soul.

277
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,352
lt's a secret garden.

278
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,352
Secrets are safe with me.

279
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,393
-And you'll know if it's alive?
-'Course.

280
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,115
Wait here.

281
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,438
This garden's not dead.

282
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,592
lt's as alive as you or me.

283
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,551
See? This part's wick.

284
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,274
See the green?

285
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,915
Wick?

286
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,314
What's wick?

287
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,669
Alive.

288
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,954
Full of life.

289
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,799
There'll be so many roses
in there this summer...

290
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,598
...you'll be sick of them.

291
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,115
Look!

292
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,638
There's a picture of my mother
and my aunt sitting here.

293
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,551
They say that's how she died.

294
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,709
How?

295
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,599
From falling off it.

296
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,000
For the first time since coming from India...

297
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,237
...I dreamed about my mother.

298
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,188
She was here...

299
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,953
...in the garden...

300
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,191
...and the garden was a jungle.

301
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,713
Come to me.

302
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,839
Are you a ghost?

303
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,748
Are you?

304
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,199
Who are you?

305
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,152
What are you doing here?

306
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,914
l live here.

307
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,435
Who are you?

308
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,114
l'm master of this house,
while my father's away.

309
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,599
Your father?

310
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,913
He's my uncle.

311
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,196
Nobody told me he had a son.

312
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,634
Come here.

313
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,359
What's your name?

314
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,792
l'm Mary Lennox.

315
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,873
What's your name?

316
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,274
l'm Colin Craven.

317
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,794
Our mother's were sisters. Twins.

318
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,109
Twins?

319
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,350
Nobody told me she had a twin.

320
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,268
-Why were you crying?
-l can't sleep.

321
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,914
Plump my pillows for me, Cousin Mary.

322
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,392
-What?
-My pillows.

323
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,798
My covers got twisted.

324
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,835
l don't know what to do about it.

325
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,675
-l'll get Martha, or Mrs. Medlock.
-No!

326
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,714
Why not?

327
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,276
Medlock wouldn't allow you in here.

328
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,956
She'd be afraid you'd upset me...

329
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,998
...and make me more ill.

330
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,991
-Do l? l'll go.
-Stop!

331
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,754
Stay here!

332
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,753
How old are you?

333
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,115
Ten.

334
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,439
We're the same age.

335
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,032
What's your mother like?

336
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,314
She's dead.

337
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,559
Mine's dead, too.

338
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,673
Do you see that cord?

339
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,915
Pull it.

340
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,473
That's my mother.

341
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,109
My father never wants to see me
because...

342
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,431
...l don't look anything like her.

343
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,238
But you, you look like her.

344
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,036
Why do you keep a curtain over her?

345
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,719
She smiles too much.

346
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,392
Smiles too much?

347
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,315
How can anybody smile too much?

348
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,153
Sometimes l hate her.

349
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,752
-She died when l was born.
-l thought she died in her garden.

350
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,034
Garden?

351
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,555
What garden?

352
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,313
Oh, just a garden.

353
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,311
There are so many of them here.

354
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,913
-Are there?
-Of course.

355
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,348
Don't you go outside?

356
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,395
Never.

357
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,913
What's wrong with you?

358
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,353
l'm going to die.

359
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,875
From what?

360
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,389
Everything.

361
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,471
l've spent my whole life in this bed.

362
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,312
You don't know how to walk?

363
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,914
You are real?

364
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,836
My dreams are so real sometimes.

365
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,831
Shall l pinch you to prove it?

366
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,069
See?

367
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,911
How did you know to pull the weeds?

368
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,549
lt looked like it was strangling.
l don't even know what it is.

369
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,400
A lily. lt's an Empress-of-lndia lily.

370
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,799
Empress of lndia?

371
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,677
These bulbs are lilies, too.

372
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,475
We'll plant them all around your lily.

373
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,516
She'll have her own ladies in waiting.

374
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,953
lt's just like the rhyme:

375
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,190
''Mistress Mary, quite contrary

376
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,191
''How does your garden grow?

377
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,992
''With silver bells and cockleshells

378
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,036
''And pretty maids all in a row.''

379
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,755
On the boat coming here,
they used to sing that song at me.

380
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,550
l wasn't as contrary as they were.

381
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,911
l met my cousin last night.

382
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,792
You've seen Colin?

383
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,998
Did you know about him?

384
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,396
Everybody knows about him.

385
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,391
But hardly anybody's seen him.

386
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,160
He said his mother died when he was born.

387
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,119
She fell off the swing.

388
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,428
He was born too soon.

389
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,272
He's not at all like you.

390
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,148
His cheeks are whiter than ice and marble.

391
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,718
Whiter than these little hairs.

392
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,233
Those are the roots.

393
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,153
Set it in there.

394
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,590
Let it grow this way, Miss Mary.

395
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,916
How tiresome to be shut indoors.

396
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,793
It's too stuffy!

397
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,111
I'll faint if I don't get
some light and fresh air.

398
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,430
At least we can open the windows.

399
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,631
No, get away from there!

400
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,073
Don't touch them.

401
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,673
They're nailed shut.

402
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,955
My lungs can't take the spores.

403
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,115
Spores?

404
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,875
The wind carries them. When you
breathe the air, you swallow them.

405
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,439
They get stuck in your lungs.

406
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,115
Before l got out into the wind,
even my hair was scrawny.

407
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,639
Your hair?

408
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,110
-Hair is dead.
-lf hair is dead...

409
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,278
...then how come it keeps growing
even after you die?

410
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,036
Well, maybe not your hair!
By then you might be bald.

411
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,952
Don't be stupid.

412
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,034
l'll be dead before l'm old enough
to be bald.

413
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,788
l'll get a lump on my back like my father.

414
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,313
Then l'll die.

415
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,956
l hate how you talk about dying.

416
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,999
Everyone thinks l'll die.

417
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,277
lf everyone thought that about me,
l wouldn't do it.

418
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,555
Here.

419
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,835
Put this on.

420
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,599
Everyone has to wear one.
Medlock's orders.

421
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,678
-But she's not here to see me.
-Put it on.

422
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,231
lt makes my face itch.

423
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,035
l can't stand it!
l didn't give you any germs last night!

424
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,912
Put on the mask.

425
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,997
Stop talking to me as if you were a rajah
with jewels stuck all over you.

426
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,350
l'll talk to you any way l please.

427
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,068
Where are you going?

428
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,151
Back outside to be with Dickon.

429
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,713
He tames animals like the animal charmers
in lndia.

430
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,155
He knows everything about gardens.

431
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,470
Does he know about my mother's garden?

432
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,069
-What?
-You said my mother had a garden.

433
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,436
How would he know about it?
lt's locked. No one's allowed in there.

434
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,670
-l'll make them unlock it.
-No, don't do that.

435
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,988
Why not?

436
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,036
lf you make them open the door like that,
if everyone knows...

437
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,310
...it wouldn't be a secret anymore.

438
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,512
Don't you see how much better it is
if it's a secret?

439
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,232
You have to.
Maybe you can't even keep a secret.

440
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,038
Master Colin, we've brought the machine
for your legs.

441
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,315
l don't want it.

442
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,311
Now, don't be like that.

443
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,677
You know how important it is
for your circulation.

444
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,919
l've got some nice, fresh flannels, too.

445
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,198
Your father returns today.

446
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,872
He won't want to see me.

447
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,832
Perhaps he will.

448
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,390
The machine. Wake up, girl!

449
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,711
Oh, l forgot my herbs.

450
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,877
-l'll get them for you.
-No, thank you.

451
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,475
Last time, you brought too many roots
and almost no leaves.

452
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,433
What are you doing down there,
Miss Mary?

453
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,633
Where's your mask?

454
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,275
lf Mrs. Medlock finds out....

455
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,511
The world's coming to an end.

456
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,033
She won't let you come back.

457
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,556
But you're master until your father
gets home, you could make her--

458
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,073
Go! Just go!

459
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,597
She'll think l disobeyed her.

460
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,512
She'll fire me for sure.

461
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,439
Please! Go!

462
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,508
His Lordship's arrived! He's here!

463
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,237
Come along, Miss Mary.

464
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,354
Come along.

465
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,032
Miss Mary, Your Lordship.

466
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,115
Calm down.

467
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,828
Come here.

468
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,632
You needn't be afraid.

469
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,555
Come here.

470
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,434
My God!

471
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,355
Your eyes!

472
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,592
They're so much....

473
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,319
l had no idea.

474
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,673
Wait a moment.

475
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,992
They never sent me your picture.

476
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,674
Mother had no time
to get my picture taken.

477
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,155
Medlock wants me to send you
to some sort of boarding school.

478
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,437
Please. Let me stay.

479
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,639
l don't do any harm.

480
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,835
Harm?

481
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,511
What harm could you do?

482
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,391
There's nothing for a child here.

483
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,993
l don't need much.

484
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,113
All l need is....

485
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,874
Could l...?

486
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,072
Could l have a bit of earth?

487
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,229
Bit of earth?

488
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,878
To plant seeds in.

489
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,912
To make things grow.

490
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,791
Take your bit of earth.

491
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,674
Don't be foolish and expect anything
to come of it.

492
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,399
May l take it from anywhere
so long as it's not wanted?

493
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,754
Anywhere!

494
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,792
Well.... Go! Go!

495
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,389
You can go.

496
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,112
Good-bye. Good-bye.

497
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,037
l'll be away until the winter.

498
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,229
He said l can!

499
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,912
l can have my bit of earth!

500
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,910
Who said?

501
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,596
My uncle. l asked him and he said ''yes.''
l can plant seeds anywhere l like.

502
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,556
Blue flowers, pink flowers...

503
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,471
...purple flowers, yellow flowers...

504
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,438
...cornflowers, foxgloves,
any kind we want.

505
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,073
lt's raining.

506
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,830
The rain will help our flowers grow.

507
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,950
ln lndia when it rained,
my ayah would tell me stories.

508
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,994
ln one of the stories there was a god
who reminds me of you.

509
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,799
When he was growing up...

510
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,350
...he had to be kept a secret,
so no one would see him.

511
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,834
Really?

512
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,228
-Why?
-Because his uncle wanted to kill him.

513
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,477
His uncle dreamed the young god
would take over heaven.

514
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,600
-Where did he hide?
-He lived with some cows.

515
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,270
Was he different from other people?

516
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,118
Only on the inside.

517
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,238
When you looked down his throat
you could see the universe.

518
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,153
The universe couldn't fit
down anybody's throat.

519
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,952
Down his it could.

520
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,469
How?

521
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,517
He'd have to be bigger than the whole
universe to fit it down his throat.

522
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,196
You said he looked like everybody else
on the outside.

523
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,319
That's right. lt's inside
that he was different.

524
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,837
-lt doesn't make sense.
-lt doesn't have to make sense.

525
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,639
lt's the idea of it.

526
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,199
lt's so stupid.

527
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,670
-No, it's not. lt's magic.
-You can't be that stupid.

528
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,233
l am not stupid!

529
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,074
You don't understand. You don't want to!

530
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,034
You can't leave!

531
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,553
You wouldn't dare!

532
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,874
Wouldn't l?

533
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,117
-l'll have them drag you back in.
-Will you, Mr. Rajah?

534
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,149
Fine.

535
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,918
That's just fine.

536
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,352
Then l won't even look at you.

537
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,396
l'll stare at the floor.

538
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,190
l'll clench my teeth together
and never tell you one thing.

539
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,197
Not even about seeing your father.

540
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,554
Yes, you will.

541
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,235
Tell me.

542
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,952
He didn't come to see me.

543
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,238
l'll die 'cause he doesn't like me.

544
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,435
He likes me.

545
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,039
But he's my father!

546
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,758
Maybe if you weren't so rude.

547
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,114
l'm not rude!

548
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,910
Yes, you are! You're so sour!

549
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,552
You won't even open your windows
and let the sunshine in.

550
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,676
How can l? lt's raining out.

551
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,116
-Even if it weren't raining.
-lf it weren't raining, maybe l would.

552
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,839
-You never have.
-Does that mean l never would?

553
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,353
l'm not sour.

554
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,591
Will he ever see Colin?

555
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,199
-He's afraid to fall in love with him.
-He's afraid to love his son?

556
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,630
Sometimes when he's here,
he stays alone for a week.

557
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,390
But Colin wants to see him.

558
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,790
Sometimes, he stays longer.

559
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,072
Longer than a week?

560
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,189
Ten years ago...

561
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,636
...when his wife died,
he locked himself in for over a month.

562
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,670
Colin was such a weak baby,
everyone thought he'd die.

563
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,271
His father couldn't bear losing him, too.
He'd suffered so much already.

564
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,752
My poor little boy.

565
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,718
That was the night the rain stopped,
the night spring came to Misslethwaite.

566
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,831
My poor uncle fled from it...

567
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,310
...as if he were escaping the spring.
