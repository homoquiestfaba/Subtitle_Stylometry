00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:26,782
Dad? Hey, Dad!

4
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:29,660
Hey, Danny!

5
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:32,162
- Mom says you have to come home.
- What's up?

6
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:33,455
She said now.

7
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:36,333
So you wanna race?

8
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,793
Come on!

9
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:58,897
Come on, Danny! Push her!

10
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:27,384
I won! I beat you, Dad!
Hey, Mom! I beat him!

11
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:50,574
- Nestor.
- Long time,John.

12
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:52,576
How have you been?

13
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:11,095
Stanley Nussbaum,
John Brennick.

14
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:15,432
Is this a joke?

15
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:18,394
Danny, go and take care
of the horses.

16
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:25,859
Target in ten minutes.

17
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:31,240
How dare you bring
a Men-Tel executive into our home.

18
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:35,285
- Former. Please.
- Stanley's a sympathizer.

19
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,789
He's carrying the plans
for Men-Tel's new power station.

20
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:40,958
We've got to get him
to resistance H.Q

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,711
Have you lost your mind
coming here?

22
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:47,423
You know Men-Tel is still
looking for us. They even want Danny.

23
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:50,592
I know that,
but they're vulnerable now.

24
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:53,137
Their oil is drying up,
their coal will be gone soon...

25
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,099
and without their power station,
Men-Tel has no power.

26
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:58,809
Look,John...

27
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:01,979
I know you've done more for the
resistance than anyone could ask...

28
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:04,815
but we need your help again.

29
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,152
Taking out that power plant
would be a big win for us.

30
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:11,113
What are you talking about?
You can't win.

31
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,324
They control everything
and everyone.

32
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,827
I told you this was a waste of time.
Let's get outta here.

33
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:19,830
- You have no right to even be here.
- No?

34
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:23,959
How long do you think it will be
before they find you here?

35
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:26,295
There where are you gonna hide?

36
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:30,382
It'll be dark soon.
May be you should go.

37
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:37,514
- You said we were done with the boat.
-Just get in.

38
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,730
I'd feel a whole lot better
if you were coming with us,John.

39
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,523
Yeah, me too.

40
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:50,027
How well do you know that woman?

41
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,156
We fought together in Mexico.

42
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,534
What if she's right?
What if Men-Tel finds us here?

43
00:04:58,702 --> 00:05:01,205
We'll move again.

44
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,375
I don't want Danny to spend
his whole life running.

45
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,876
Come on.

46
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:13,175
Come on, Danny! Let's go!

47
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:15,678
Go, go!

48
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,497
Clear!

49
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:08,814
- You got it?
- Yeah.

50
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:26,332
Clear!

51
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:32,963
- What are you doing?
- I've gotta hold them off.

52
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:34,673
Open the grate!

53
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:49,021
- I'm not leaving without you.
- I love you, Danny.

54
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:51,940
- Your mom will take care of you.
- You're supposed to!

55
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:53,609
I can't see!

56
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,277
Don't do this.

57
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,696
I lost you once.
I won't let it happen again.

58
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,699
Go, go!

59
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:11,669
- Any sign of them?
- It's an old waterworks. Booby-trapped.

60
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:14,713
Blue Leader, this is Eagle One.
Vehicle on the move outback.

61
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:16,674
- Looks like our guy.
- Eagle One, you're up.

62
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:17,966
Roger that.

63
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:37,528
-Stop!He wants him alive!
- Tell him that.

64
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:42,866
Where'd he go? Can you see him?

65
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,868
I don't know. I've lost him.

66
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:50,791
Where is he?

67
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:55,170
I'll get him on the infra red.

68
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:57,256
He's locked on.

69
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:11,020
- Eagle Two?
- Already on him.

70
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:28,203
Blue Leader,
looks like we got him.

71
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,711
There's movement down there.
We got him, all right.

72
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:42,384
Brennick's in the net.
We're going in.

73
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:47,264
Torch the place.
Destroy the evidence.

74
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:56,690
Go, go, go!

75
00:08:57,983 --> 00:08:59,943
I'm picking him up now.

76
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:24,635
Prisoner number 27609.

77
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:25,970
Brennick, John W.

78
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:28,847
You are charged with sedition,
sabotage, escape...

79
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:33,811
and aiding and a betting the fugitive
identified as Brennick, Karen.

80
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:36,522
You are also charged
with secondary reproduction...

81
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:39,024
and the unlawful possession
of Men-Tel property...

82
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:44,363
consisting of male offspring
identified as Brennick, Daniel.

83
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:47,992
- How do you plead?
- Does it make any difference?

84
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,327
Your query is
an acknowledgement of guilt.

85
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:52,371
The minimum sentence is death.

86
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,873
Adjudication complete.

87
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:10,347
Prepare for implantation.

88
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:17,354
Prisoner number 27609.
Brennick, John W.

89
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:22,776
You'll now be equipped with the Men-Tel
Corporation's new neural implant.

90
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,531
The implant is designed for
behavior modification and control.

91
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:30,075
Activation is
a discretionary function.

92
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,455
Implantation complete.
Testing behavior modification.

93
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:37,082
Look at the light.

94
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:39,835
Slight pain? Thank you.

95
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:45,174
Prisoner number 27609.
Brennick, John W.

96
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:47,593
Orientation is now complete.

97
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:50,179
Failure to observe
any rule or regulation...

98
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,181
of the Men-Tel correctional code...

99
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:55,434
will result
in behavior modification.

100
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:58,228
Please exit
through the open doorway...

101
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,230
and have a nice day.

102
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:25,172
- Let's go.
- Where the fuck are we?

103
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:27,383
Shut your hole. Move on out.

104
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:36,183
- What the hell--
- Get used to it.

105
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:53,117
Take a bedroll and move out.

106
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,671
Are you out of your mind,
bringing Brennick there?

107
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:09,091
Susan. How nice to hear from you
after all this time.

108
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,509
Daddy all right?

109
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:12,011
Fuck Daddy.

110
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:16,807
Why on Earth would you wanna bring
the only man ever to escape...

111
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,727
from a Men-Tel prison
to my power station?

112
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,146
Is that what we're calling it
these days?

113
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:23,689
Listen carefully.

114
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:25,691
If it hadn't been
for your father and me...

115
00:12:25,774 --> 00:12:28,610
Brennick's escape
would have cost you your career.

116
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,738
If any thing goes wrong this time...

117
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,699
it won't just be your job;
it'll be your ass.

118
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:35,367
The new prisoners...

119
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,953
have completed their orientation,
Mr. Teller.

120
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:40,622
Laborers, ZED. Laborers.

121
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:44,293
Next think you know,
they'll want a fucking union.

122
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:49,381
I'm Dr. Preminger, and this is
the Men-Tel Prison Network.

123
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:53,052
All right, everybody, step out.

124
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:59,016
- Where to?
- They're all the same.Just pick one.

125
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:03,312
Our first-class living accommodations
combine all the comforts of home...

126
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:06,190
with an urturing environment.

127
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:09,485
And when it comes to food...

128
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:12,905
our commissary
has been certified triple-A...

129
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:15,991
by Men-Tel's Department
of Prison Nutrition.

130
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:18,035
The patented diet
provides each guest...

131
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:21,872
with Men-Tel's recommended
daily requirement of nutrients--

132
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:24,208
What's up, my role-playing,
incarcerated brother?

133
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:25,417
Marcus Jackson.

134
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:33,008
Oh, big fella.

135
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,767
Should kick your ass.
Lucky for you I got a back problem.

136
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:43,936
Damn!

137
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:47,272
Girlfriend.

138
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:54,989
They got you, too, huh?

139
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:13,716
- Your wife and son get away?
- I think so.

140
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,885
What about Nestor?

141
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,055
The boat took a direct hit.

142
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,099
When I came up,
they were both gone.

143
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:25,227
- I guess they made it.
- Guess again.

144
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,608
What happened to him?

145
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:35,863
- They screwed up his implant.
- He might be the lucky one.

146
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:40,284
So. How're we gonna get outta here?

147
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:42,786
"We"?

148
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:46,999
Just like Mama used to make.

149
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:49,251
Are we supposed to eat this shit?

150
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:55,174
That's my food, bitch!

151
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:01,221
Damn!

152
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:05,059
Everyone, back in your seats!

153
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,395
There's a disturbance
in the commissary.

154
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,606
Shall I institute
behavior modification?

155
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:13,317
ZED, I'm dining.

156
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:18,072
Unauthorized physical contact
is a violation.

157
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:22,993
Prisoners failing to desist will be
subject to behavior modification...

158
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:25,079
commencing in five seconds.

159
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:30,209
Four, three, two, one.
Commencing.

160
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:39,343
Let him go.

161
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,188
Get down!

162
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:54,024
Get down on the floor!

163
00:15:58,237 --> 00:16:00,155
Give her a little more juice.

164
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:16,380
A screw's a screw, fish.

165
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:19,049
You just messed up, bad.

166
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:23,804
Thanks.

167
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:28,934
He played knick-knack on my shoe
With a whack-whack

168
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:32,521
ZED, have Brennick brought up here.

169
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:40,321
Unauthorized access
is a violation.

170
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:46,160
Guess you've done this before.

171
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:48,662
Kill the pain zone, ZED.
609.

172
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:51,957
Prisoner 27609, authorized.

173
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:04,053
Thank you, Mr. Sato.
Wait outside, please.

174
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:13,812
Who are you?

175
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:17,232
My name is Teller.

176
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:21,362
I'm the administrator of
this godforsaken institution.

177
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:27,284
Ten years ago, I ran
all of Men-Tel's prison facilities...

178
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,244
including The Fortress.

179
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:33,791
- Until you destroyed it.
- I'm so sorry.

180
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,085
You will be...

181
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,754
once I get them here.

182
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:44,093
I beat you, Dad.

183
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:51,934
- You son of a bitch!
- Unauthorized contact is a violation.

184
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,232
Thank you, ZED.

185
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,985
You're welcome.
As you instructed...

186
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,112
order has been restored
in the commissary...

187
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:05,781
and the new prisoners have been
returned to their cells...

188
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:07,825
to await your welcoming address.

189
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:12,705
Good evening.

190
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:16,709
For those of you who've
just arrived, welcome.

191
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,294
Let me explain a few simple rules.

192
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:21,547
Number one.

193
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,509
Pursuant to a charter between your
governments and Men-Tel Corporation...

194
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:30,472
your death sentences have been
stayed for as long as I see fit.

195
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:32,850
Plan accordingly.

196
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,476
Rule number two.

197
00:18:34,518 --> 00:18:37,021
Physical contact
with members of staff...

198
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:38,397
is strictly forbidden.

199
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,651
Anyone violating this rule
will be asked to leave.

200
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:50,075
Oh, my God.

201
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:54,705
What the hell's that?

202
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,707
We're in space.

203
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:01,503
This is some real bullshit.

204
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,107
Rule number three.

205
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:26,695
You are 26,000 miles
from the nearest bus station...

206
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:29,323
surrounded by an airless,
irradiated vacuum.

207
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:32,368
While there may be those
amongst you who think otherwise...

208
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:34,161
there can be no escape.

209
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:38,207
Thought to the contrary
will be discouraged.

210
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,459
Thank you and good night.

211
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:45,214
Welcome home.

212
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:53,889
- Good morning.
- Delete 225, ZED.

213
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:58,477
Prisoner number 225. Ho, Sally.
File deleted.

214
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,605
One down, 119 to go,
eh, Gordo?

215
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:03,816
I gotta tell you.
I don't think that's funny.

216
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:06,151
- Did you see the way she died?
- Who gives a shit?

217
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:09,655
He put her through the chemical
disposal unit, for Christ's sake!

218
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:12,116
Another scumbag
gets what's coming to him.

219
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:16,036
Or in this case, her.
I think.

220
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,205
Nobody deserves
to go out like that.

221
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,669
You're breaking my heart.
Now go wake them up.

222
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:26,255
Anda-one, anda-two, anda-three.

223
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,674
Now keep it up.

224
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:32,428
Strenuous exercise program...

225
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:36,974
will help combat the effect
of our artificial gravity.

226
00:20:37,057 --> 00:20:40,978
Stretch and flex.
Stretch and flex.

227
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:46,775
Feel the burn.

228
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:49,945
Once more.

229
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,613
You gotta be kidding!

230
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,618
All right.

231
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,620
Rise and shine, you shitheads!

232
00:20:58,662 --> 00:21:02,624
We're gonna have some fun today.
Line up when you hear your name.

233
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:07,796
- Mr. Gordon?
- Rivera, E. Marks, P.

234
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,842
Martinez, C. Unit One.
Going that way.

235
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:14,678
Polk, M. Wells, H. Taz, M.

236
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:17,890
Brennick,J.Jackson, M.
Unit Two. You're in the elevator.

237
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:20,517
The rest of you go with Mr. Parker.

238
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:27,316
Thought I recognized you.
We were in the joint together.

239
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:31,695
Think you can get out of
this one, hotshot?

240
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:33,739
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

241
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:36,367
I guess I have one of those faces.

242
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,243
Can you free that tightening already?

243
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:49,004
Now this is difficult,
so pay attention.

244
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:52,549
You cut this up, and you put it
in there. You got it?

245
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:56,345
Not you. The four of you
follow me.

246
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:59,181
- Where we go?
- Field trip.

247
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:04,478
Just for the record, I ain't
the least bit happy about this.

248
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:06,522
I'll make a note of it.

249
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:11,694
No safety lines, guys.

250
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:13,737
Stay close to something
you can grab.

251
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:25,624
Man, these people don't know what kind
of asses they're putting their risks in.

252
00:22:40,514 --> 00:22:44,560
Okay, just take it easy this time.
That's right.

253
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,563
That's right.
Now just a little bit to the right.

254
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:52,735
Yo, Brennick! Wait up!

255
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,078
Easy.

256
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:13,797
- What was that?
- Stay with us, Marcus.

257
00:23:17,968 --> 00:23:22,139
- Better take it easy on those bolts.
- Why? You the bolt police?

258
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:25,976
They're packed with explosives.
It'll blow your hand off.

259
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:26,977
Look!

260
00:23:28,937 --> 00:23:30,773
- Kiss my ass.
- One fragment...

261
00:23:30,814 --> 00:23:34,068
could shatter you helmet
or puncture your suit.

262
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:37,071
You'd last a minute out here, tops.

263
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:47,206
What that guy
said about you this morning.

264
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:50,167
About you escaping.
Is it true?

265
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,336
Not any more.

266
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:54,338
But you could do it again,
right?

267
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:14,066
Have we killed anybody
since I left?

268
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:15,567
You know...

269
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,071
I've been wondering about you.

270
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:21,073
What are you doing up here,
anyway?

271
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:23,701
Man's got to make a living.

272
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:28,247
This ain't a living, pal.
It's a life.

273
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:31,542
You're either one of us,
or you're one of them.

274
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:36,338
So you better figure out which is which
before someone else does it for you.

275
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,383
What is this?
Is this a threat?

276
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:43,095
Second warning.
Meteor shower approaching.

277
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,764
Asshole. We've got
four prisoners out there.

278
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:48,934
It's not like we're gonna run out.

279
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:50,769
Let's get out there!

280
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:53,897
Prisoners must return to the station
immediately. This is the second warning.

281
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:57,026
- Did you ignore the first one?
- Forget about it. It's just a shower.

282
00:24:57,067 --> 00:25:00,571
Warning.. All exterior personnel...

283
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:03,407
must proceed
to the nearest airlock immediately.

284
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:06,076
Any personnel remaining
outside the station...

285
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:09,496
will be subject to projectile injuries
above survivable levels.

286
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,749
- Help me!
- Let's go!

287
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:15,169
Warning! Warning!
All exterior hatches...

288
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:17,755
will be automatically sealed
in 30 seconds.

289
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:22,968
- Let's go, man!
- Preparing for lock down.

290
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:24,511
Come on, come on.

291
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:31,727
Warning.. All air locks
will be sealed in 15 seconds.

292
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:33,812
Meteor fragments
have now reached the perimeter.

293
00:25:33,937 --> 00:25:37,941
Fatal meteorite densities
are imminent.

294
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:42,279
This is the final warning. There are now
ten seconds until lock down.

295
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,115
Proceed to the nearest airlock
immediately.

296
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,618
Stand clear of all airlock doors.

297
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:50,287
Locking mechanisms
have now been activated.

298
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:52,289
Stand clear of all airlock doors.

299
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:02,132
- Open the door!
- Mac Dan's still out there!

300
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:05,844
- Open the door!
- We can't It's sealed!

301
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,348
Open goddamned the door!

302
00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:18,649
What the fuck?

303
00:26:18,774 --> 00:26:20,818
I give that one a 9.5.

304
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:22,987
What about you, Gordo?

305
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,659
This some real bullshit.

306
00:26:44,008 --> 00:26:45,926
Be back in five.
Keep it moving.

307
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,454
Let's go. Hook 'em up.

308
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:19,543
Get it to the scanner.
There's still two loads to go.

309
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:51,241
She's a beauty, ain't she?

310
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:53,911
- She yours?
- I wish.

311
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:56,580
Got my old tug
parked out by the back door.

312
00:27:57,414 --> 00:28:00,584
Challenger-class piece of shit.

313
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:03,128
I flew a Challenger
in the air corps.

314
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:05,464
- Yeah? What squad?
- 37th.

315
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,549
Double deuce myself.

316
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:09,760
-J. Hickey.
-John Brennick.

317
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,762
Nice to meet ya.

318
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:14,390
So, you miss it?

319
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,433
The air corps?

320
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:19,478
- Beats this.
- I guess.

321
00:28:19,603 --> 00:28:22,022
Gotta be better
than what I'm doing.

322
00:28:22,106 --> 00:28:23,440
Fucking iceman.

323
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:27,111
- "Iceman"?
- Fly to the moon, pick up the ice...

324
00:28:27,111 --> 00:28:30,114
melt it on the way here
and dump it in the tank.

325
00:28:30,197 --> 00:28:32,825
Shit, shower and shave,
and do it all over again.

326
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:36,286
You don't go to Earth?

327
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:39,832
My old wreck? It'd be
a one-way fuckin' trip.

328
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:44,586
Move your asses.

329
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:48,090
- Good talking to you.
- Back at you, pal.

330
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:59,226
How well do you know that pilot?

331
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,645
I just met him.

332
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:03,647
What were you talking about?

333
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:06,650
Nothing much. Boy talk.

334
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:08,652
Yeah.

335
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,654
What about the cameras
in the lab?

336
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:14,116
And the latch on the container?

337
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,077
You're imagining things.

338
00:29:25,044 --> 00:29:26,545
That's mine.

339
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:37,890
That's mine too.

340
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:53,364
- Nobody likes a smart guy.
- You must be very popular.

341
00:29:55,908 --> 00:29:59,244
- You disrespecting me, punk?
- I'm not looking for any trouble.

342
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,997
Found you, anyway.

343
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:05,542
Warning.. Unauthorized physical contact
is a violation.

344
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,587
Behavior modification
will commence in five seconds.

345
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,756
Suspended.

346
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,225
You fuckin' broke my rib!
You broke my nose!

347
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:25,938
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

348
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:28,565
Let me see.
You may have broken it.

349
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:32,611
Why did you suspend
behavior modification?

350
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:35,948
- Because it amused me.
- Violence amuses you?

351
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,743
It has its moments.
Who's that with Brennick?

352
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:41,787
Rivera, Elena.

353
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,289
Convicted of terrorism
and sedition...

354
00:30:44,415 --> 00:30:46,625
in connection
with the Durango uprisings.

355
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:50,254
Were any of our other guests
implicated in Durango?

356
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:55,509
"What a tangled web we weave."

357
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:59,471
- I'm afraid I do not understand.
- I should hope not.

358
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,571
Why are you treating me like this?

359
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:18,157
Treating you like what?

360
00:31:18,282 --> 00:31:20,659
We're here together...

361
00:31:20,784 --> 00:31:22,661
in this horrible place.

362
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:28,375
Can't we at least try to make things
a little more tolerable for each other?

363
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:39,887
Not this time.

364
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:47,061
You know, you're never
going to see her again.

365
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:49,813
Yes, I will.

366
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:55,027
Or I'll die trying.

367
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:08,499
What's the status
of my favorite fugitives?

368
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,542
The latest recovery team
was detained...

369
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:13,212
by local authorities
north of the border.

370
00:32:13,337 --> 00:32:16,715
A further incursion could result
in a formal complaint to the embassy.

371
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,509
I don't care.

372
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,220
She's an escaped convict,
a multiple breeder.

373
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:25,557
Her illicit offspring is the property
of the Men-Tel Corporation.

374
00:32:25,683 --> 00:32:29,728
This will not be over
until they're all here.

375
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:33,148
One big, happy family.

376
00:32:44,243 --> 00:32:46,537
I really need to talk to you.

377
00:32:52,084 --> 00:32:53,752
I'm sorry about last night.

378
00:32:56,046 --> 00:32:58,382
Just once I wish someone would
feel about me...

379
00:32:58,424 --> 00:33:01,135
the way you feel about your wife,
you know?

380
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:05,389
What are you doing?

381
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,105
I'm going out in the container.

382
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:15,107
You're nuts.
You'll suffocate in there.

383
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:19,111
I won't be in there
long enough to suffocate.

384
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:22,281
I'm gonna hijack the shuttle
as soon as it leaves the station.

385
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:23,949
Using what?

386
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:27,745
- Help me grab his weapon.
- Load 'em up.

387
00:33:30,956 --> 00:33:34,460
What's wrong with your encoder?
This goddamn thing won't work.

388
00:33:37,087 --> 00:33:40,257
- You can't talk to her like that.
- All I said was "damn."

389
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:43,469
- You said "goddamn."
- Don't let it happen again.

390
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:46,347
- Or we'll report you.
- Report me?

391
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:50,601
Are you two sniffing paint up here?
You better sort your shit out fast.

392
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,812
Good as new.

393
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:59,818
Like taking candy from a baby.

394
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:07,493
Think. What if you're caught?

395
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:11,455
I don't have any choice here.

396
00:34:11,497 --> 00:34:14,124
Teller's after my wife and son...

397
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:18,170
and he's going to get them
unless I get to them first.

398
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:20,506
Are you gonna help me or not?

399
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:25,010
Cover me up.

400
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:34,687
- Where's Brennick?
- Still packing.

401
00:34:34,812 --> 00:34:36,689
- What are you looking at? Help her.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:34:36,814 --> 00:34:39,191
I got it. Here we go.

403
00:34:39,274 --> 00:34:41,235
- Watch it.
- Right this way.

404
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:48,701
Let's go.

405
00:34:48,742 --> 00:34:50,035
- What was that?
- Pull it out.

406
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,454
- It's just--
- Pull it out!

407
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:58,252
Let's go!

408
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:02,756
Open it.
I said open it, goddamn it!

409
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,679
Oh. There it is. Sorry.

410
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:11,598
It's just my encoder.

411
00:35:11,724 --> 00:35:13,851
Do we have a problem?

412
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:15,602
No, sir. No problem.

413
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,486
Miss Combs, do you have any idea
what it costs...

414
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,364
to keep prisoners
just standing round idle?

415
00:35:27,406 --> 00:35:30,242
113.5 credits per prisoner.

416
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:33,120
A rhetorical question, ZED.
Thank you.

417
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:35,122
You're welcome.

418
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:42,129
Just try to keep things moving.

419
00:35:48,344 --> 00:35:50,471
You heard the man.
Seal it up, and let's go.

420
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:04,795
Shit.

421
00:37:12,386 --> 00:37:14,722
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

422
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:19,810
But thank you for pointing out
the defects in our security.

423
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,565
You two? Fired. Mr. Gordon.

424
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,026
Cut all the prisoner's rations
in half...

425
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:29,528
and double their work day.

426
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,030
Thank you.

427
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,950
What do I do with him?

428
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:39,246
Put him in the hole.

429
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:48,881
Move!

430
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,772
You caught Brennick
trying to escape?

431
00:38:46,814 --> 00:38:49,483
I suppose you've called up
to congratulate me.

432
00:38:49,608 --> 00:38:51,819
Now tell me what happened.

433
00:38:51,944 --> 00:38:55,155
What happened is I've got Brennick
cooking in the box...

434
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,657
Like a Honey baked ham.

435
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,659
I shipped enough reflector plates...

436
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,828
to create a downlink
the size of Rhode Island.

437
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:03,372
I'm on target
to beat our transmission date.

438
00:39:03,455 --> 00:39:07,084
So is it so hard
to say "well done"?

439
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:11,338
Fine. You did a good job.
What next?

440
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:14,842
I'd quite like to finish
the other generator.

441
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:17,428
Would you get serious?

442
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:21,515
It won't cost you a dime. I have all the
labor and materials I need right here.

443
00:39:21,598 --> 00:39:25,185
Al I'll need from you
is an electron accelerator.

444
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:26,353
What for?

445
00:39:26,437 --> 00:39:29,690
Well, I'll be able to use it...

446
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:32,151
integrate the two generators.

447
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:35,321
We'll be able to quadruple
our power output overnight.

448
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:39,325
You know as well as I do there's
no such thing as too much power.

449
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:42,369
I can't disagree with you there.

450
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:46,498
Go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

451
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,709
Do give my love to Daddy.

452
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:05,309
My man, question.

453
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:07,353
Is it warmer than this
up in the hole?

454
00:40:09,813 --> 00:40:11,815
Would you like to find out?

455
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,194
Asshole.

456
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:45,432
Quit using up all the hot water.

457
00:40:45,557 --> 00:40:49,061
- Danny asleep?
- Why? Feeling bashful?

458
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:53,649
I won. I beat you, Dad.

459
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:57,611
What are you talking about?
You can't win.

460
00:40:57,695 --> 00:40:59,947
They control everything
and everyone.

461
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:02,282
I'm not leaving without you.

462
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:15,629
Shall I release him from the hole?

463
00:41:15,713 --> 00:41:19,883
He's already exceeded normal
life expectancy by seven hours.

464
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:21,677
Show me Brennick.

465
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:27,141
Why, suppose he's about done.

466
00:41:27,224 --> 00:41:29,143
All right. Get him out.

467
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:37,526
Keep it moving.

468
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:40,612
I've got a tug full of water
waiting for you jerk-offs to finish.

469
00:41:46,118 --> 00:41:48,329
- I thought you might be dead.
- No such luck.

470
00:41:48,412 --> 00:41:51,373
- Tell me about it.
- Mind your own business.

471
00:41:51,457 --> 00:41:53,334
First of all,
this is my business.

472
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:57,004
We're working round the clock because
John got a hankering to see his wife.

473
00:41:57,087 --> 00:42:00,299
At least he had
the courage to try.

474
00:42:00,382 --> 00:42:02,301
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

475
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:05,387
It means he cares about someone
other than himself...

476
00:42:05,471 --> 00:42:07,556
which is more than
I can say for you.

477
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,684
I ain't see no fan mail
come down here for you, either!

478
00:42:10,768 --> 00:42:12,936
Instead of
arguing with each other...

479
00:42:14,396 --> 00:42:17,983
maybe we should be trying to find
a way out of this place.

480
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:21,570
Yeah. Before things
get any worse around here.

481
00:42:25,157 --> 00:42:28,702
There's a contusion
on the subject's right patella.

482
00:42:28,786 --> 00:42:31,622
There's a small abrasion
on the subject's left hip.

483
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:34,291
There's still some evidence
of dehydration...

484
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,961
but the effects of hypothermia
have almost disappeared.

485
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:40,005
There is some
residual skin blemishes...

486
00:42:40,047 --> 00:42:42,883
resulting from
cosmic radiation burns.

487
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:45,928
There are no other
apparent malfunctions.

488
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:48,639
Prisoner number 27609...

489
00:42:48,722 --> 00:42:51,308
you are authorized
to return to the workforce.

490
00:42:51,392 --> 00:42:53,602
Have a nice day.

491
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:15,708
Mr. Karensky would like
a word with you.

492
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:16,834
I'm listening.

493
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:25,592
Mr. Karensky feels your escape attempt
has done us all a great disservice.

494
00:43:30,556 --> 00:43:33,225
Mr. Karensky believes you are now
indebted to him...

495
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:36,312
for the additional hours
we all have had to work.

496
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:46,739
Mr. Karensky believes that the woman
will be fair recompense...

497
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:49,491
for the inconvenience
you have caused.

498
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:51,118
She is not mine to give.

499
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,788
Then perhaps...

500
00:43:54,872 --> 00:43:57,124
you can take her place.

501
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:03,047
That's flattering,
but I think I'll pass.

502
00:44:15,684 --> 00:44:19,897
- What did they want?
- Something about relations.

503
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,857
International relations.

504
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,318
It's no joke.

505
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:28,572
Those Russians will cut your heart out
just to see the look on your face.

506
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:31,075
I don't think it's my heart
they're interested in.

507
00:44:34,787 --> 00:44:38,248
Jesus! If you don't get the dirty,
filthy thing out of here--

508
00:44:38,332 --> 00:44:40,292
I told you keep that sucker
outta my food!

509
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:43,295
- I tried. He won't eat it.
- He's eating something.

510
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:45,631
- Look at the size of that motherfucker.
- Knock it off.

511
00:44:45,714 --> 00:44:47,466
It's just a bug.

512
00:44:47,549 --> 00:44:50,010
Bug, my ass. Roachzilla, maybe.

513
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,974
You notice anything funny
about those security cameras?

514
00:44:58,811 --> 00:44:59,687
Yeah.

515
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:03,983
They're not even focusing
on what we do.

516
00:45:04,024 --> 00:45:06,151
Then how do they monitor us?

517
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:11,407
I tell you one thing.
You better figure it out...

518
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,493
before we have to learn how to say
"I'm your bitch" in Russian.

519
00:45:14,576 --> 00:45:17,246
I'm Dr. Preminger.

520
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:20,624
Today's topic..
Learning to love your self.

521
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:24,628
I would like each and everyone of you
to take a good look at the wonder--

522
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,797
Would you please shut up?

523
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,717
At least you didn't have to listen
to that while you were in the hole.

524
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,677
Reach down and grab--

525
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,680
- Yo, shut up!
- Partner, she can't hear you.

526
00:45:34,763 --> 00:45:36,974
Every god damn day.
Shut up!

527
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,033
- Feel better now?
- Yeah, it was worth it.

528
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:02,666
- What's that?
- A frequency modulator.

529
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,169
That's a channel changer to you.

530
00:46:05,961 --> 00:46:09,506
Why would they need a channel changer
if they've only got one channel?

531
00:46:10,716 --> 00:46:13,093
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Step on out.

532
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:15,638
Let's move it.
We have a lot of work to do.

533
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:17,681
I need you to listen up.

534
00:46:17,723 --> 00:46:19,183
Not you.

535
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:22,061
- What's up?
- Boss wants him on hard labor.

536
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,775
This whole area
needs to be completed.

537
00:46:27,858 --> 00:46:31,487
We need the wires repositioned
and the wall panels put back up.

538
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,489
So listen up.

539
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:38,243
You know the drill.

540
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:53,258
Been waitin' a long time for this!

541
00:47:00,557 --> 00:47:03,727
You're a dead man.
Really. A dead man.

542
00:47:05,104 --> 00:47:08,273
Unauthorized physical contact
is a violation.

543
00:47:08,399 --> 00:47:10,985
Shall I suspend
behavior modification?

544
00:47:11,652 --> 00:47:13,404
You're learning.

545
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:16,573
Behavior modification suspended.

546
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:46,061
Hold it!

547
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,341
How do you wanna go?

548
00:48:25,643 --> 00:48:27,728
Look out!

549
00:48:46,038 --> 00:48:48,165
Guess that makes us even.

550
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:51,877
Even, my ass.
What the hell happened down here?

551
00:48:52,002 --> 00:48:54,254
You know what happened.
Where were you?

552
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:56,924
On my break.
You got a problem with that?

553
00:48:57,007 --> 00:48:59,551
And where was ZED?

554
00:48:59,677 --> 00:49:03,764
My apologies. We've been experiencing
some technical difficulties.

555
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:08,060
I'm sure all these problems
will be eliminated shortly.

556
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:19,863
Hey, Colonel Sanders. I heard
you fried that redneck motherfucker.

557
00:49:19,905 --> 00:49:23,033
- Where are the others?
- They down at the snack shack.

558
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:24,994
It's all-you-can-eat lobster
tonight.

559
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,171
What do you want, bozo?

560
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,216
Food, not this shit.

561
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:42,594
How bad do you want it?

562
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:44,847
Hey, Kev. Come here
and look at this.

563
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:48,058
Bezinsky and Sato.
This ought to be good.

564
00:49:48,892 --> 00:49:51,645
- What are you working on?
- A remote.

565
00:49:51,729 --> 00:49:56,400
- Where did you get it?
- The tuner I got from the TV.

566
00:49:56,442 --> 00:49:59,903
The keypad and stuff
I got from the new work area.

567
00:49:59,945 --> 00:50:01,905
Go sit down.

568
00:50:04,074 --> 00:50:07,244
If not for this, I'd tear off your head
and shit down your throat.

569
00:50:14,293 --> 00:50:17,755
Would you suspend behavior mode
on 27321, please?

570
00:50:17,796 --> 00:50:19,757
My pleasure, Mr. Sato.

571
00:50:20,924 --> 00:50:25,596
Behavior modification for
prisoner 27321 has been suspended.

572
00:50:30,142 --> 00:50:31,435
Your move, bozo.

573
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,487
Let's get outta here.

574
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:53,957
Pass it from the right wing
in to the center.

575
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:55,959
- Goal!
- There you go.

576
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:58,170
That's what I'm talking about.

577
00:51:00,714 --> 00:51:02,675
I'm good, man.
I'm good.

578
00:51:22,194 --> 00:51:25,030
Is that one of
those independent films?

579
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,502
Kiss my ass.

580
00:51:45,134 --> 00:51:47,344
We tapped into
their surveillance system.

581
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,848
Are you all right?
I heard about what--

582
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:55,102
- How do you do that?
- Ask him.

583
00:51:56,103 --> 00:52:00,190
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Girl, you better recognize my skills.

584
00:52:00,274 --> 00:52:03,610
I can build a radio station out of
a milk carton and two condom wrappers.

585
00:52:11,076 --> 00:52:14,997
- What's up with the Russians?
- They're not even watching.

586
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,291
The fight's a diversion.

587
00:52:17,374 --> 00:52:19,126
They're up to something.

588
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:34,266
Damn. It's like they got cameras
inside their heads.

589
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:54,453
What are you doing?
Turn it back!

590
00:52:55,537 --> 00:52:58,457
Yo, that's me.

591
00:52:58,457 --> 00:53:00,793
- Kill it.
- No doubt.

592
00:53:00,793 --> 00:53:05,464
- What's wrong?
- The implants they gave us.

593
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:08,842
They tap into the optic nerve.

594
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:10,844
They see what ever we see.

595
00:53:34,118 --> 00:53:35,828
That's enough!

596
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:41,000
You ever touch me again,
and I'll kill you.

597
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:46,005
- You got it?
- Yeah. I understand you completely.

598
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:55,681
Well, that was entertaining.

599
00:53:55,764 --> 00:53:57,683
Come on, Newman.
Go for a walk.

600
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:04,023
With the right parts, could you stitch
together some kind of video recorder?

601
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:06,025
With my eyes closed.

602
00:54:08,694 --> 00:54:10,863
That would be the way to do it.

603
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:19,913
ZED, what's the prognosis
on the second generator?

604
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,834
There seems to be an anomaly
in the acquisition files.

605
00:54:23,876 --> 00:54:25,044
- Anomaly?
- The output figures...

606
00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:27,171
for the new electron accelerator...

607
00:54:27,212 --> 00:54:29,381
are well in excess
of our power requirements.

608
00:54:29,423 --> 00:54:31,675
Planning for the future.

609
00:54:31,717 --> 00:54:34,428
I cross-referenced the acquisition file
with future projections...

610
00:54:34,553 --> 00:54:36,430
and found no relevant data.

611
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:41,060
I haven't had a chance to file
all our future plans as yet.

612
00:54:41,185 --> 00:54:43,896
It's difficult for me to function
at full efficiency...

613
00:54:43,896 --> 00:54:47,066
if I don't have access
to all relevant data.

614
00:54:49,276 --> 00:54:52,279
Now let's get
one thing straight here.

615
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:55,574
I decide what's relevant data,
not you.

616
00:54:55,574 --> 00:55:00,746
So don't bore me with these
anomalies unless I ask you to.

617
00:55:02,247 --> 00:55:03,957
Is that clear?

618
00:55:09,755 --> 00:55:11,882
That's it, guys.
We're on playback.

619
00:55:18,138 --> 00:55:20,599
You guys owe me big time.

620
00:55:27,147 --> 00:55:30,943
That scanner chip only has
about four minutes recording time.

621
00:55:30,943 --> 00:55:32,945
So everyone listen up.

622
00:55:36,448 --> 00:55:38,075
I'm sorry, man.

623
00:55:47,668 --> 00:55:51,005
Do you think this uniform
makes me look fat?

624
00:55:52,965 --> 00:55:57,136
What we have to do first
is find a way around ZED.

625
00:55:57,219 --> 00:56:00,556
Forget about ZED. What are we
gonna do for transportation?

626
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:04,476
We're going to hijack
the Venture Star.

627
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:08,022
-'Cause it worked so well the last time?
-There has to be another way.

628
00:56:08,147 --> 00:56:10,691
Like what?
" Beam me up, Scotty"?

629
00:56:10,816 --> 00:56:13,277
The Russians have a shuttle.

630
00:56:14,987 --> 00:56:16,196
Excuse me?

631
00:56:16,322 --> 00:56:18,407
What makes you think
they have a shuttle?

632
00:56:20,075 --> 00:56:22,328
Because I'm a lieutenant...

633
00:56:22,328 --> 00:56:25,664
with the Russian
Federal Security Service.

634
00:56:26,832 --> 00:56:31,337
I have been watching them plot
while they're playing chess.

635
00:56:31,378 --> 00:56:33,547
It's an old gulag trick.

636
00:56:33,672 --> 00:56:35,841
Most of what they say is garbage...

637
00:56:35,924 --> 00:56:38,802
but when they touch the queen,
it's relevant.

638
00:56:38,844 --> 00:56:41,138
Pretty hard to crack
if you don't know the rules.

639
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,349
Then let's talk to them.

640
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:45,351
I gotta stay undercover.

641
00:56:46,685 --> 00:56:48,562
If they figure out who I am...

642
00:56:49,688 --> 00:56:50,856
they'll kill me.

643
00:56:54,443 --> 00:56:56,528
Then I'll do it.

644
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:04,244
Your chess stinks.

645
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:12,086
You have a skill.

646
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:16,757
I might as well just shuttle...

647
00:57:17,841 --> 00:57:19,718
my pieces off the board.

648
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:25,557
That's an unusual choice of words.

649
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,267
A metaphor, perhaps.

650
00:57:27,893 --> 00:57:31,397
Words, they seem meaningless.

651
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:33,232
But can we escape...

652
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:36,402
their consequences?

653
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:43,742
That's it.

654
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:46,245
We're on playback.
Now we can talk.

655
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:51,166
You were right.
Their shuttle arrives tomorrow.

656
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,293
Tomorrow?

657
00:57:53,335 --> 00:57:55,295
Man. So what's their plan?

658
00:57:55,337 --> 00:57:57,589
If they had a plan,
they wouldn't need us.

659
00:57:57,631 --> 00:58:03,137
- So what's our part?
- I told them we knew how to bypass ZED.

660
00:58:03,178 --> 00:58:07,599
- Did it occur to you that we don't?
- Yes, but we've got 24 hours.

661
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:10,436
All we need are the codes
to Teller's office...

662
00:58:10,477 --> 00:58:13,480
and ZED's security casing.

663
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:18,986
Ain't that a bitch? Man, give me back
my rag! What's wrong with you?

664
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:21,613
- Leave him alone, Marcus.
- Leave him alone, my ass.

665
00:58:21,655 --> 00:58:24,283
He's a damn klepto.
Look at this shit!

666
00:58:24,325 --> 00:58:26,994
Oh, oh, oh! Fuck!
What the f--

667
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:28,495
Newman!

668
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:39,173
- Where did you get this?
- I found it.

669
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:44,345
- What is it?
- An implant. Our ticket home.

670
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,849
Pick it up, ooh, ooh

671
00:58:48,932 --> 00:58:51,518
Pick it up, all right
Party over here

672
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:53,562
Party over there

673
00:58:53,687 --> 00:58:56,398
Who's the man
with the mike in his hand

674
00:58:56,523 --> 00:58:59,693
Don't even think about it.

675
00:59:00,861 --> 00:59:03,030
Damn thing would quit movin'.

676
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:07,034
- What exactly are we trying to do here?
- Don't hurt him!

677
00:59:07,117 --> 00:59:09,870
You better get the hell out of my face.
I ain't gonna hurt this damn thing.

678
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:12,331
Just trying to tap into
his nervous system here.

679
00:59:12,373 --> 00:59:13,499
Why?

680
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,919
Who's the only person on this
station that gets edible food?

681
00:59:17,044 --> 00:59:20,172
- Teller. So?
- The roach must be eating something.

682
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:29,890
- Can't you get a better picture?
- "Can't you get a better picture?"

683
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:33,018
Can you do it your damn self?

684
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,355
Now let's see what's on the menu.

685
01:00:01,922 --> 01:00:04,425
Ooh, ooh! All right! Go!

686
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:11,056
Must be the cold water.

687
01:00:17,104 --> 01:00:20,607
I'm going to Teller's office.

688
01:00:20,649 --> 01:00:23,152
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

689
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:37,249
Unauthorized access is a violation.

690
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:40,961
Behavior modification
will commence in five seconds.

691
01:00:41,086 --> 01:00:44,089
It's just me, ZED.
Suspend.

692
01:00:44,131 --> 01:00:46,634
Suspended.

693
01:00:53,974 --> 01:00:55,559
He's at Teller's door.

694
01:01:01,148 --> 01:01:03,984
This is useless.
We can't see a thing.

695
01:01:06,528 --> 01:01:09,114
- So?
- We're just about ready.

696
01:01:09,156 --> 01:01:12,868
We've linked the two transmitters
and calibrated the aiming device.

697
01:01:12,993 --> 01:01:15,371
All we need now
is the firing pin.

698
01:01:15,496 --> 01:01:18,999
So when does
the accelerator arrive?

699
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,669
She's sending it up tomorrow
with the next load of prisoners.

700
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,671
She has no idea what
we're planning to do with it.

701
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:31,470
Can I help you?

702
01:01:31,512 --> 01:01:33,639
I wouldn't mind getting
a piece of that myself.

703
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:37,643
Well, thank you for
sharing that with me, Mr. Sato.

704
01:01:37,685 --> 01:01:39,770
You can go now.

705
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,275
So hard to get
good help these days.

706
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,988
I believe I have already advised you
that the new electron accelerator...

707
01:01:49,029 --> 01:01:51,865
considerably exceeds
our power requirements.

708
01:01:51,991 --> 01:01:56,537
Now she's sulking.
ZED, lock down.

709
01:02:06,797 --> 01:02:08,215
Newman?

710
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,517
Newman's dead.

711
01:02:21,478 --> 01:02:24,732
It was for a good cause, you know.

712
01:02:24,815 --> 01:02:28,569
Good cause, my ass.
We ain't seen shit!

713
01:02:28,652 --> 01:02:30,904
If that shuttle arrives
and we don't have the codes...

714
01:02:30,988 --> 01:02:33,240
the Russians will kill us all.

715
01:02:33,324 --> 01:02:35,868
The Russians will be
the least of our problems.

716
01:02:35,909 --> 01:02:37,870
What was that, Stan?

717
01:02:37,911 --> 01:02:43,625
Buckle my shoe.
Close the door.

718
01:02:43,751 --> 01:02:45,627
Stan, you're a genius.

719
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,049
We didn't have to see the codes.
We heard them.

720
01:02:56,513 --> 01:02:58,724
Right this way, ma'am.

721
01:02:58,766 --> 01:03:02,061
Take me to his office. There's going
to be some changes around here.

722
01:03:04,104 --> 01:03:06,607
- Susan?
- Peter.

723
01:03:06,732 --> 01:03:09,735
I've come up to take over
this operation.

724
01:03:10,778 --> 01:03:12,237
You can't.

725
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:14,823
I've been working on
this project for ten years.

726
01:03:14,948 --> 01:03:18,452
My idea to turn the prison
into a power station.

727
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,788
My idea to use
the convicts as labor.

728
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:22,790
My idea to tie in
the second generator.

729
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:26,502
You think I'm just going to stand by
and let you walk away with it?

730
01:03:26,627 --> 01:03:30,130
Peter, until this moment I didn't
think you actually had any balls.

731
01:03:30,964 --> 01:03:32,841
Too bad they're not as big as mine.

732
01:03:32,966 --> 01:03:35,636
So sit down,
shut up and pay attention.

733
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:37,638
Do you think I wouldn't
have found out...

734
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,140
about your black op that
captured Brennick in Canada?

735
01:03:40,265 --> 01:03:43,936
Stalking his wife and son,
overriding ZED...

736
01:03:43,978 --> 01:03:46,021
executing inmates.

737
01:03:46,146 --> 01:03:48,148
If anyone else finds out
about what you've been doing...

738
01:03:48,273 --> 01:03:51,026
you'll be a resident here
instead of the super.

739
01:03:51,151 --> 01:03:53,696
- Do you understand me?
- Absolutely.

740
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:58,117
Good! Then let's unpack that
electron thing and show me to my room.

741
01:04:00,911 --> 01:04:04,081
Do you remember the first code?

742
01:04:04,164 --> 01:04:07,960
Two, three, six.
Pick up sticks.

743
01:04:08,002 --> 01:04:10,546
Good. The second.

744
01:04:12,423 --> 01:04:15,884
Nine, two, four.
Open the door.

745
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:19,305
He's never going to remember.
Let one of us go.

746
01:04:19,346 --> 01:04:22,558
He's the only one who can cross the pain
zone without having his brain fried.

747
01:04:22,683 --> 01:04:24,935
No brain, no pain.

748
01:04:25,936 --> 01:04:27,354
You ready?

749
01:04:31,275 --> 01:04:33,110
There you go.

750
01:04:33,193 --> 01:04:38,157
Man, this motherfucker's
cross-eyed.

751
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:43,662
Gotta be kiddin' me.
This shit ain't gonna work.

752
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:48,208
It'll be fine.
Go and get 'em, Stan.

753
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,377
Go.

754
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:02,890
- Huh?
- Unauthorized access.

755
01:05:02,973 --> 01:05:05,017
- Kev, check this out.
- Behavior modification...

756
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,103
will commence in five seconds.

757
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:10,439
- Four, three, two--
- Oh, forget it.

758
01:05:10,564 --> 01:05:14,109
- It's just the nitwit.
-Suspended.

759
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,994
I've done levels 432, 659 and 224.

760
01:05:24,078 --> 01:05:25,954
- Hello.
- And I got nothing.

761
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,916
- Everything's negative?
- Yes.

762
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:31,794
- Why don't you help check it?
- Will do.

763
01:05:33,087 --> 01:05:35,923
- Nice.
- Not now, you dingbat.

764
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:46,475
Pick up sticks.
Pick up sticks.

765
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:53,524
Six, Two, three, six.

766
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:55,234
Six.

767
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,487
Come on, Stanley.
Come on.

768
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:02,783
Open the door.
Open the door.

769
01:06:06,578 --> 01:06:10,582
Let's go.
Paul, get the Russians.

770
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,253
Go to heaven.

771
01:07:00,632 --> 01:07:04,637
Warning. Warning. Unauthorized entry
is a level one violation.

772
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,515
Commencing behavior modification.
Warning.

773
01:07:10,684 --> 01:07:15,314
Warning. Unauthorized entry
is a level one violation.

774
01:07:15,356 --> 01:07:17,941
- Behavior modification...
- Get out of the way!

775
01:07:18,025 --> 01:07:19,610
will achieve terminal status
in five seconds.

776
01:07:19,693 --> 01:07:21,570
- Cut the power!
- I'm trying!

777
01:07:21,695 --> 01:07:24,281
Don't hurt her!
She's nice!

778
01:07:24,365 --> 01:07:27,242
One. Administering.

779
01:07:30,204 --> 01:07:32,915
Get to the shuttle station now!

780
01:07:37,336 --> 01:07:39,380
- Come on, Stanley!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

781
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:42,925
Rivera has that repressive,
compulsive thing.

782
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:45,177
- What?
- You know, where you have to...

783
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:47,429
wash your self over and over again.

784
01:07:49,473 --> 01:07:51,600
Damn it.

785
01:08:40,524 --> 01:08:42,651
Son of a bitch.

786
01:08:47,614 --> 01:08:48,866
Okay.

787
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,830
Come on!
Where the hell are they?

788
01:08:58,625 --> 01:08:59,752
Hey!

789
01:09:02,963 --> 01:09:05,257
We're not going without the others.

790
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:15,976
Mr. Karensky regrets that we will be
unable to accommodate your friends.

791
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:20,481
But, of course, you understood that.
Nikolai?

792
01:09:22,483 --> 01:09:24,693
Good-bye, pig!

793
01:09:30,491 --> 01:09:33,327
I got a feelin' that's
not a Russian salute.

794
01:10:09,446 --> 01:10:13,867
Nice shot, though I say it myself.

795
01:10:18,038 --> 01:10:21,667
Damn! That's the first time
I was happy I missed a ride.

796
01:10:32,845 --> 01:10:34,972
Don't die on me, Max.

797
01:10:35,055 --> 01:10:39,268
My name is Yuri Rienkov.

798
01:10:43,564 --> 01:10:47,359
Abandoned by his colleagues
and murdered in cold blood.

799
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:50,863
Heartrending.
Don't you think so, Mr. Tubman?

800
01:10:53,532 --> 01:10:57,995
- You traitorous son of a bitch.
- What in the hell is going on here?

801
01:10:58,078 --> 01:11:01,373
- Susan!
- That weapon was not authorized.

802
01:11:01,415 --> 01:11:03,375
It's clever, though, isn't it?

803
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:06,545
A hundred trillion volts
of electromagnetic pulse...

804
01:11:06,587 --> 01:11:10,257
powered by vast amounts of
Men-Tel's cheap electricity.

805
01:11:10,341 --> 01:11:12,801
And now you've brought me
the firing pin.

806
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:16,388
I can burn any target
in the Northern Hemisphere.

807
01:11:18,557 --> 01:11:21,518
Gentlemen,
let's get this over with.

808
01:11:21,602 --> 01:11:23,646
Let go of me!

809
01:11:36,617 --> 01:11:38,535
I didn't mean for it
to end this way.

810
01:11:38,619 --> 01:11:40,954
You must be very disappointed.

811
01:11:41,038 --> 01:11:42,498
Please!

812
01:11:45,709 --> 01:11:47,628
- Guess again.
- Good-bye,John.

813
01:12:09,483 --> 01:12:11,735
- Next.
- No!

814
01:12:18,826 --> 01:12:20,494
Get her off me!

815
01:12:34,299 --> 01:12:37,052
Whoo! That hurt, didn't it?
Didn't it?

816
01:12:45,352 --> 01:12:46,603
You bitch!

817
01:12:56,488 --> 01:12:57,781
Fuck you!

818
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:22,598
Mr. Sato, get ZED
to restore surveillance.

819
01:13:22,681 --> 01:13:24,892
Mr. Tubman, toss these
three miscreants into the hole.

820
01:13:24,975 --> 01:13:28,896
Mr. Gordon, have someone
clear this up, will you?

821
01:13:37,571 --> 01:13:40,324
So it was a setup
from the beginning, Nestor.

822
01:13:40,407 --> 01:13:44,078
- You used me to find Brennick.
- Wasn't me. Told you.

823
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:46,205
You were the closest one
to Brennick.

824
01:13:46,246 --> 01:13:48,248
If anybody could lead us to him,
it was you.

825
01:13:48,332 --> 01:13:50,334
Too bad about the wife
and kid though.

826
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:52,711
You know what?
You a real humanitarian, bro.

827
01:13:52,753 --> 01:13:55,130
Do I look like your brother,
convict?

828
01:14:07,518 --> 01:14:11,814
Prisoner number 27609,
Brennick, John, W.

829
01:14:11,897 --> 01:14:14,525
- File deleted.
- Good-bye.

830
01:14:23,909 --> 01:14:25,661
Nice and easy now.

831
01:14:36,255 --> 01:14:37,631
Look out!

832
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:44,388
It can't be that hard!

833
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:46,098
Sorry.

834
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:14,418
ZED?

835
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,140
Systems check.

836
01:15:37,358 --> 01:15:39,902
An explosion in airlock 17
has compromised...

837
01:15:39,985 --> 01:15:42,946
the structural integrity
of that entire sector.

838
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:47,451
Orbital deterioration will become
critical in approximately ten minutes.

839
01:15:47,534 --> 01:15:49,453
- What?
- An explosion in airlock -

840
01:15:49,536 --> 01:15:52,331
I heard you.
Can you seal off that sector?

841
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:56,251
The damage to my system precludes me
from initiating structural repairs.

842
01:15:56,335 --> 01:16:02,049
Sealing doors 16 and 18
will have to be closed manually.

843
01:16:03,217 --> 01:16:05,678
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get out of this place...

844
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:08,013
before it blows up.

845
01:16:08,055 --> 01:16:12,851
Relax. The construction's modular.
ZED can seal up the damaged section.

846
01:16:12,893 --> 01:16:14,937
Besides, where are you
going to go?

847
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:21,110
Brennick, wait!
Stay with me.

848
01:16:21,193 --> 01:16:23,195
I'll call my office.
They'll send someone to come get us.

849
01:16:23,237 --> 01:16:26,740
- And then what?
- Then I'll pardon you.

850
01:16:26,865 --> 01:16:29,535
You are gonna pardon me?

851
01:16:31,412 --> 01:16:34,373
- No, thanks, lady.
- Brennick, wait!

852
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:38,293
The station's orbit
will continue to deteriorate...

853
01:16:38,377 --> 01:16:40,754
until both sealing doors
are secured.

854
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,589
- Sir, the prisoners--
- Not now.

855
01:16:42,673 --> 01:16:44,591
We have a damaged sector
in the new wing.

856
01:16:44,675 --> 01:16:47,720
- We'll have to seal it off manually.
- Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Teller.

857
01:16:47,761 --> 01:16:50,055
There's an outgoing
transmission from sector 17.

858
01:16:50,097 --> 01:16:52,891
- Outgoing? Retrieve it.
- Are you listening to me?

859
01:16:52,933 --> 01:16:56,061
Of course, Susan. You want me
to send a spaceship up there...

860
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:59,440
because your stepson
tried to kill you...

861
01:16:59,523 --> 01:17:02,067
but a prisoner named Beswick
saved your life, right?

862
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:04,445
- It's Brennick, you idiot!
- Brennick.

863
01:17:04,528 --> 01:17:06,697
- I'll have to get back to you on this.
- Wait, wait!

864
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:10,576
ZED, behavior modification...

865
01:17:10,617 --> 01:17:12,494
highest level.

866
01:17:12,578 --> 01:17:14,163
John Brennick.

867
01:17:14,246 --> 01:17:18,375
I'm sorry, but that file has
been deleted from the system.

868
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:20,419
By whom?

869
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:24,923
You said delete all casualties.

870
01:17:26,467 --> 01:17:30,429
Casualties means dead, you cretin!

871
01:17:33,807 --> 01:17:35,768
Yo! Wait up!

872
01:17:35,809 --> 01:17:38,520
Come on!

873
01:17:40,814 --> 01:17:43,609
Oh, damn!
What the hell you do that for?

874
01:17:43,651 --> 01:17:47,363
- I'm sorry! I didn't know it was you!
- You're lucky it was your head.

875
01:17:47,446 --> 01:17:52,159
Listen. Get everyone to the water tank.
We're going out on the tug.

876
01:17:52,242 --> 01:17:57,956
ZED, why didn't you
tell me about this?

877
01:17:57,998 --> 01:18:00,542
You instructed me
not to report anomalies...

878
01:18:00,626 --> 01:18:03,045
unless specifically requested
to do so.

879
01:18:03,128 --> 01:18:06,465
Orbital deterioration will become
critical in approximately eight minutes.

880
01:18:06,507 --> 01:18:10,469
- What?
- Have you developed a hearing defect?

881
01:18:10,511 --> 01:18:12,972
Unless you want the station
to collapse like an egg carton...

882
01:18:13,013 --> 01:18:16,308
you better get up there
and seal off the damaged section!

883
01:18:18,018 --> 01:18:19,979
Now where you goin'?

884
01:18:21,021 --> 01:18:23,524
I've been hiding
from Men-Tel for 10 years.

885
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:25,651
I'm not gonna let my son
grow up that way.

886
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:30,155
Besides, someone has
to turn off the lights.

887
01:18:31,532 --> 01:18:34,326
You can't use those up here!
You'll pierce the hull!

888
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:37,329
The last thing I'm worried about
is another prick in the hull.

889
01:18:37,371 --> 01:18:42,042
You seal this.
I'll start on the other one.

890
01:18:51,802 --> 01:18:54,054
Bingo.

891
01:18:54,138 --> 01:18:57,391
Look what crawled out
of the recycle bin.

892
01:18:58,517 --> 01:19:02,104
Don't be stupid.
The whole place is about to go down.

893
01:19:02,187 --> 01:19:03,605
Nah.

894
01:19:05,482 --> 01:19:07,443
Just you.

895
01:19:07,526 --> 01:19:09,528
Lethal dose.

896
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:13,449
Drop your weapon, Sato.

897
01:19:13,532 --> 01:19:17,244
I am not going to let you
kill another man in cold blood.

898
01:19:20,748 --> 01:19:25,669
Didn't I tell you never
to touch me again?

899
01:19:47,107 --> 01:19:49,735
Everyone! Keep moving!

900
01:20:02,915 --> 01:20:04,833
ZED, show me Brennick!

901
01:20:07,044 --> 01:20:09,755
Wait a minute. D-2.

902
01:20:12,299 --> 01:20:15,761
ZED? Stop them!

903
01:20:15,803 --> 01:20:18,931
I'm sorry. My system requirements
are presently overloaded.

904
01:20:18,973 --> 01:20:22,267
Orbital deterioration
will become critical in four minutes.

905
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:35,948
Stanley, come on.

906
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:41,453
I can't-- I-- I can't--

907
01:20:41,495 --> 01:20:44,665
Shit! Don't say a word.

908
01:20:48,293 --> 01:20:51,463
- Stanley, let's go! Let's go.
- Come on!

909
01:20:51,505 --> 01:20:53,882
- Go!
- Okay.

910
01:21:25,539 --> 01:21:27,374
Where's Sato and Gordon?

911
01:21:27,499 --> 01:21:30,544
- Sato is missing, and Gordon is dead.
- Damn it!

912
01:21:33,213 --> 01:21:36,258
You get up there and seal it off.

913
01:21:36,383 --> 01:21:38,260
Let's go! Keep movin'!

914
01:21:38,385 --> 01:21:40,846
- Let's go! Get outta here!
- Don't look down!

915
01:21:40,888 --> 01:21:42,890
Come on, Stanley!
Let's go!

916
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:45,267
He can't just have disappeared.

917
01:21:45,392 --> 01:21:48,479
- Perhaps he is at the new transmitter.
- Patch me through then.

918
01:21:48,562 --> 01:21:51,273
I'm afraid you will
have to do that manually.

919
01:21:51,398 --> 01:21:53,734
You denied me access to
the transmitter area six days ago.

920
01:21:53,817 --> 01:21:58,072
Because you were reporting everything
I did to the Men-Tel Corporation.

921
01:21:58,155 --> 01:22:00,240
Reporting is an automatic function.

922
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,827
I have no control over it.

923
01:22:03,911 --> 01:22:08,374
ZED, you betrayed me.

924
01:22:13,587 --> 01:22:15,589
Whoa!

925
01:22:15,673 --> 01:22:18,175
You left the water running.

926
01:22:19,593 --> 01:22:21,887
Access restored. Find him.

927
01:22:23,097 --> 01:22:26,767
I have located John Brennick
in the transmitter control room.

928
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:30,813
Not my gun!

929
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:40,447
Orbital deterioration
will become critical in one minute.

930
01:22:40,572 --> 01:22:42,992
- Help me!
- Not now. Brennick's got the weapon.

931
01:22:43,117 --> 01:22:45,411
Forget Brennick!
We gotta seal the door!

932
01:22:45,452 --> 01:22:49,957
Teller, think!
The weapon is pointed at Earth!

933
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,335
Now what's he gonna do with it?
Help me.

934
01:22:54,795 --> 01:22:58,465
Total orbital collapse
will occur in ten seconds.

935
01:22:58,507 --> 01:23:01,677
Nine, eight, seven...

936
01:23:01,802 --> 01:23:04,555
six, five, four...

937
01:23:04,638 --> 01:23:06,015
three, two--

938
01:23:08,475 --> 01:23:10,686
The damaged sector
has been secured.

939
01:23:10,811 --> 01:23:13,022
Orbital stability
is being restored.

940
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:23,657
ZED's coming back on-line.
We've got to get out of here now.

941
01:23:23,782 --> 01:23:25,701
- What about Brennick?
- He's dead.

942
01:23:25,826 --> 01:23:28,287
I saw it myself.
Teller shot him twice.

943
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:31,081
Look, I'm the president of Men-Tel!

944
01:23:31,165 --> 01:23:33,709
I'm ordering you to get off
of this space station now--

945
01:23:35,669 --> 01:23:38,339
We're not going anywhere,
you bitch.

946
01:23:58,525 --> 01:24:00,069
What the hell's he doin'?

947
01:24:08,035 --> 01:24:10,037
The panels?

948
01:24:30,557 --> 01:24:34,395
It's over,John.
Step away from the controls.

949
01:24:37,398 --> 01:24:38,899
Get over there!

950
01:24:40,734 --> 01:24:42,361
Ten years.

951
01:24:45,739 --> 01:24:48,409
I feel like I know you...

952
01:24:48,534 --> 01:24:52,955
better than anyone
I've known in my whole life.

953
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,624
I wouldn't bet on that.

954
01:25:06,593 --> 01:25:10,931
A massive power surge has destroyed
all of the station's critical functions.

955
01:25:10,973 --> 01:25:14,268
All personnel must
evacuate immediately.

956
01:25:14,268 --> 01:25:19,106
A massive power surge has destroyed
all of the station's critical functions.

957
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:22,109
All personnel must
evacuate immediately.

958
01:25:25,446 --> 01:25:29,950
Prisoner number 27609,
Brennick, John, W.

959
01:25:30,034 --> 01:25:33,329
You are charged with sedition,
sabotage, escape...

960
01:25:33,454 --> 01:25:37,791
with aiding and abetting fugitive
identified as Brennick, Karen.

961
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:40,252
You are also charged with--

962
01:25:44,465 --> 01:25:47,676
Teller! It's over!
Get up the stairs!

963
01:25:47,801 --> 01:25:51,597
You get up there,
and you bring him down!

964
01:25:57,311 --> 01:25:59,313
Have a nice--

965
01:26:01,398 --> 01:26:04,318
Prisoner number 27609--

966
01:26:09,823 --> 01:26:11,909
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

967
01:26:14,828 --> 01:26:17,373
You traitorous piece of shit!

968
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:25,673
- Take my hand!
- I'm sorry.

969
01:26:25,798 --> 01:26:27,841
- Take my hand!
- Sabotage, escape--

970
01:26:30,135 --> 01:26:32,471
Identified as Brennick--

971
01:26:52,866 --> 01:26:54,076
I'm losin' it!

972
01:26:55,869 --> 01:26:58,080
- We've got him!
- Hurry up!

973
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:02,584
Cut it loose!

974
01:27:13,637 --> 01:27:14,763
Hold on!

975
01:27:19,184 --> 01:27:21,687
- Dial the system!
- Everybody, hold on!

976
01:27:39,288 --> 01:27:41,123
Mom, look.

977
01:27:41,206 --> 01:27:43,542
- It's a shooting star.
- Ahh.

978
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:46,128
You can make a wish.

979
01:27:46,253 --> 01:27:47,713
I wish--

980
01:27:47,796 --> 01:27:50,299
If you tell anyone,
your wish won't come true.

981
01:27:56,805 --> 01:27:58,891
I wish my dad would come home.

982
01:28:05,856 --> 01:28:07,816
Take us home.

983
01:28:22,581 --> 01:28:25,084
- Oh, Danny, Danny, Danny!
- Dad!

984
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:28,420
-== Spell Checked by ==-
-== HxHPRC ==-
-== The best of the best! ==-

985
01:28:28,504 --> 01:28:31,757
-== Have a nice time! ==-
-== Good-by! ==-
