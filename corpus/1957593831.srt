Hello, Mr. Snow Man?

14
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,000
I have a blizzard going here.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,700
Mr. Snow Man, I have
a blizzard going here.

16
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,560
I need a lot more snow, say
50% more snow, you got that?

17
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,393
- Jane!

18
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:21,961
- [Jane] Your turn.

19
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:26,180
- When do I get to play a
real part instead of just

20
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,680
being your stand-in or hangin'
around in the background?

21
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,850
- Maybe when I think you're ready.

22
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,123
- [Director] Come on, Blanche.

23
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,070
- Maybe you'd better go with her.

24
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,790
- [Director] Alright, going one more time.

25
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,576
I need some help, people,
we gotta make this thing.

26
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,150
Let's go, let's go!

27
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,263
- Honey, the parts will get bigger.

28
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,140
- Not in her pictures.

29
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,030
I really, really don't understand her.

30
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,580
Sometimes she's nice and
then she gets really mean.

31
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,663
I think she's crazy.

32
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,822
The way she treats everybody,
even you and Daddy.

33
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:05,077
- Please, we need you on your
sister's marks, thank you.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,730
- We promised your
sister a real part, Jane.

35
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,219
- We did, Jane.

36
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,390
- Blanche is clumsy.

37
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,223
- [Director] Okay, Blanche.

38
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:24,560
Take your sister's position
on the bed, please.

39
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:50,866
- Whoa, whoa, sky bombers, sky bombers!

40
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:57,941
- I'd like to live at the beach always.

41
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,444
- Maybe we could!

42
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:00,667
- Daddy?

43
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:03,030
- No, Blanche, it's just
too far from the studios.

44
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,222
- It might be nice for the girls.

45
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:08,600
- Yeah, but when Blanche
begins her acting lessons,

46
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,500
it'll be just too inconvenient.

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,737
- Now me, and let's do it like Betty Boop.

48
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:15,570
- Okay.

49
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:18,985
Get your nose.

50
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:21,722
(girls giggle)

51
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,113
Okay.

52
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,635
Put your lips together.

53
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:27,718
(laughs)

54
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,455
(father laughs)

55
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:35,001
- Good job, Blanche, good job!
(Blanche yelps and giggles)

56
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:40,001
Good job. (laughs)
(bell rings)

57
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:43,133
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream?

58
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,159
Oh, oh, oh, ice cream, ice cream.

59
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:50,159
We scream, we all scream, oh!
(somber orchestral music)

60
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,244
- I know, but I didn't know what to do.

61
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:38,911
You'd gone and I didn't think
you were ever coming back.

62
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:59,723
You won't leave, now that you're here?

63
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:02,433
- No.
- You promise you'll stay?

64
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:03,266
- Always.

65
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:06,588
- Oh, Bill.

66
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:09,716
Bill.

67
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:16,730
Ah, I didn't hear you come in.

68
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,259
- How could you, with
that damn thing blaring?

69
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,092
- Bill.

70
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:24,045
Bill.

71
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:27,660
- That one of your turkeys?

72
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,367
- I can see so many things
Tony could've improved upon,

73
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,703
that would've, might've helped the movie.

74
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,310
- Like not releasing it, you mean.

75
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,573
- Oh, it wasn't that bad.

76
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,400
Host of the series says
they're making some videos

77
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,260
out of my movies.
- Really?

78
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,610
- Jane, Jane, would you
please get a video recorder?

79
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,923
I've asked you so many
times, it would be fun.

80
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:55,290
I wanna see some old movies.
- Oh, great.

81
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,810
We could have a film festival
of your films, Blanche.

82
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,153
- No need to be sarcastic.

83
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,220
Anyway, you seem to have
forgotten that you had parts

84
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,547
in most of my movies.

85
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,190
- They weren't parts, Blanche,
they were scraps, leftovers.

86
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,210
- Some of them were big.

87
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,040
- And then cut to nothing,
you took care of that.

88
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,270
You, the editor, the director,
you were in it together.

89
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,170
- That's not true.
- Yeah, that is true, Blanche.

90
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah, you shot my scenes,

91
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,210
so I could be cut out of the film later.

92
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,080
Yeah, I know that trick.

93
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,487
You seem to forget I was a star
when your billing was still

94
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,567
"pioneer child killed by stampede."

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Just really glad that Daddy never lived

96
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,847
to see what you did to my career.

97
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:39,378
(man whistles jauntily)

98
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:48,784
(collar rattles)
(dog barks)

99
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:50,123
(dog barks)
- Tweak!

100
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,780
Come here, boy, come here, come on.

101
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,550
That's my baby boy.
- Frank, Frank.

102
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,350
Come over here, quick, quick, quick!

103
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,490
Do you know who that is?

104
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,973
- I wanted to die, I
couldn't face it alone.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,235
- No.

106
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:11,435
- That's Blanche Hudson.

107
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:14,530
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,510
Don't be so smug, you love
living nextdoor to a movie star.

109
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,760
- Sweetheart, I wouldn't
know her if I fell over her.

110
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,363
I've hardly ever seen her.

111
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,257
- I saw her, I did, I saw her once.

112
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,740
Frank, Frank, I'm watchin' the TV.

113
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,570
- You know, the only one
I've ever seen is that sister

114
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,880
draggin' herself around like
a ratty old flower child.

115
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,713
- Now, be nice.

116
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,290
- She looks like she got
trampled at Woodstock.

117
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,230
- Shh!
(Frank laughs)

118
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,520
- [Frank] I heard she was a lush.

119
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,480
- Do you know that I got one
of those trashy newspapers

120
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,440
from the supermarket.

121
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,080
They did a whole week
on Where Are They Now?

122
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,460
It said that Jane Hudson
deliberately tried to kill

123
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,520
her sister Blanche in
that so-called accident

124
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,813
and only succeeded in paralyzing her.

125
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,923
- Now, please!

126
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,503
Oh, please, can I have the TV?

127
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,593
- Nope.

128
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,073
Watch upstairs, I got work to do.

129
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:17,002
(Blanche moans)

130
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,123
- Bye bye.

131
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,710
Jane, did you take your pills?

132
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,160
- You'll miss your big scene.

133
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:13,572
(moody string music)

134
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,232
Ow.

135
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:24,091
Ow.

136
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,573
- Miss Hudson, I'm Connie
Trotter from right next door.

137
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,040
I don't mean to bother you,
but I was just making some

138
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,220
cookies and after seeing
your sister's film on TV,

139
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,520
I couldn't resist sharing
what I do real well

140
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,970
to thank your sister for
what she does real well.

141
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,108
(chuckles) I kinda rehearsed that.

142
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,560
Did you know that there's a retrospective

143
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,196
of your sister's films on?
- Yeah, I know.

144
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:23,196
- Um, you know, I have a video
cassette of Dark Sunrise,

145
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,710
the movie that your sister
did with William Carol.

146
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,480
I was pretty young when all
your sister's films came out,

147
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,920
but I have become a real fan
through TV and I was wondering

148
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,900
if maybe she was--
- She doesn't give autographs.

149
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,420
If that's what you're after.

150
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,660
- Oh, would you and your
sister like to come over

151
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,720
to our house for dinner some night?

152
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,160
My husband and I would really like that.

153
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,233
- I don't go out much and she
doesn't go out at all anymore.

154
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,060
Thanks for the cookies.

155
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,780
- You have to hold the
bottom of the bag, because,

156
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,903
because it's greasy.

157
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:59,333
- "Dear Miss Blanche Hudson.

158
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:03,607
"My mother told me to
watch your old films.

159
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,887
"And I did.

160
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,118
"And I was..."

161
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,201
(laughs)

162
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,677
(dog whines)

163
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:17,753
- Frank, Frank.

164
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,663
I just went over there,
right, and I brought her...

165
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:26,889
- Jane!

166
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:33,990
(phone rings)
Jane?

167
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,137
Jane, would you come up here, please?

168
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,873
- What is it now?

169
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:50,733
- Come here.

170
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,677
Jane, was that our
nextdoor neighbor I heard?

171
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,233
- [Jane] You didn't
wanna see her, did you?

172
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,440
- I could've said hello.

173
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,120
- When they moved in, you
said they were gawking at you

174
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,980
in the backyard, you
didn't wanna see anybody.

175
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,090
- That was six months ago, I looked awful.

176
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,143
- You don't look any better now. (laughs)

177
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,713
- Could you wash my hair?

178
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:27,193
Oh, do something different.

179
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,070
Do you remember when we were
kids we used to go to the ocean

180
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,480
we'd get sandy and we'd come
back and we'd get showered

181
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,763
and I'd do your hair
and then you'd do mine.

182
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:43,265
- Yes.

183
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,510
- Why do you always try to hurt me?

184
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,713
- I didn't say anything.

185
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,933
- It's unfair.

186
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,862
It was just an accident,
I've never blamed you.

187
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,302
- I don't wanna talk about the accident.

188
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:03,385
- I've never blamed you for anything.

189
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:07,483
(hairdryer blows)

190
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,900
(both laugh)

191
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:20,130
- [Jane] Do you remember,
at the beach, we would get

192
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,403
on Daddy's shoulders and
one of us on one shoulder--

193
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:27,273
- And he would walk out into
the water as far as he could,

194
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:29,632
and the waves would hit us!

195
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:32,049
(both laugh)

196
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:37,260
- And then he'd fall and we'd laugh!

197
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,063
Oh, god, how we laughed.

198
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,877
- Can I look?

199
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:51,290
Can I look?
- Okay.

200
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,123
- Okay.

201
00:15:56,164 --> 00:16:00,081
(melancholic orchestral music)

202
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:07,171
What have you done?

203
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,253
- What do you mean?

204
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,980
- [Blanche] It's way too short.

205
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,263
- No, it's not, I think it looks great.

206
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:16,733
- It's awful, it's way too short!

207
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,983
What have you done?

208
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,206
- You never think I do anything right!

209
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,510
- Jane!

210
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,343
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,103
I'll even it out somehow, I'm sorry!

212
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,490
- How'd you get in?

213
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,210
- Miss Hudson told me where
you keep the extra key.

214
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,110
Don't worry, I put it back.

215
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,060
- Yeah?

216
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,853
Well, she was gettin'
herself all pretty for ya.

217
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,020
Now you ruined it.

218
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,710
- Yeah, well my schedule
got all screwed up

219
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,020
on account I got a call
back for that series.

220
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,710
- Yeah, well, I've been there.

221
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,673
I wouldn't quit my day job just yet.

222
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,983
- How're you doin' today, Blanche?

223
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:23,208
What happened to your hair?

224
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,703
- I cut it.

225
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,570
Did you get your series?

226
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,700
- Well, I got a call back.

227
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,860
- Oh, that's wonderful.

228
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,288
- Yeah, well, your sister didn't seem

229
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:41,617
to think it was any bid deal.

230
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:43,660
- Oh, Dominick, you'll get
that series, I know you will.

231
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,785
- Thanks.

232
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:47,618
Alright.

233
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,603
Ready?

234
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:53,484
Up and over.

235
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,040
Blanche.

236
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,290
Did you talk to Dr.
Shelby about your sister?

237
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,003
- Not yet.

238
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,750
- She's gettin' worse, you know.

239
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,003
Saw an open bottle of vodka downstairs.

240
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,810
You know, the doctor said
she might do somethin' crazy

241
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,930
if she started drinkin' again.

242
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,568
- I thought she was getting better.

243
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:15,700
- Yeah.

244
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,533
Well, she's not.

245
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:25,792
I found this on the floor downstairs.

246
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,023
- What ever made her do this?

247
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,120
- Sick mind, that's the
kind of stuff you see

248
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,320
scratched on public toilets.

249
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,280
- She's perverted a lovely fan letter.

250
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,780
- Mm-hm, reads like hate mail.
- But why?

251
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,033
- Like I said, nuts-oh.

252
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,077
Maybe she knows about
you sellin' the house.

253
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:53,220
(Blanche gasps)

254
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,540
- She couldn't.

255
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
- Your health drink!

256
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,523
Right on time.

257
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,292
(dog barks)

258
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,670
I'm gonna put a contract out on that mutt.

259
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,680
- (chuckles) Doesn't bother me.

260
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,791
- Hey, Bruno, you wanna strangle it?

261
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,807
I'll give you $10.

262
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:16,626
- [Dominick] Dominick, and
I don't mistreat animals.

263
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,270
- [Jane] Oh, I forgot,
you have principles.

264
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,267
I'll give you 20.

265
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:23,065
(door closes)

266
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,990
- [Dominick] She's not kiddin', you know.

267
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,450
- You won't change your mind?

268
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,690
There are two rooms for
you in the new house.

269
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,540
- You keep your word, I'll keep mine.

270
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,050
Gotta find a place that'll take care

271
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,250
of your sister properly.

272
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,303
- I will, today, I'll call Dr. Shelby.

273
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,443
- What?

274
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,973
My sister said what?

275
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:59,300
Now you listen to me, our
credit is good all over town.

276
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,210
So when I hang up from you,
I am gonna call another

277
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,210
liquor store and order a
case of vodka or maybe two,

278
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,127
because you are really bugging me,

279
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:08,273
and I do not like your attitude.

280
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,620
You've got five seconds to decide.

281
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,830
Oh, good, thank you.

282
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,993
Usual order, thank you.

283
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,410
That feely-touchy stuff you do up there,

284
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,660
is it doing her any good?

285
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,480
- Without the therapy, she'd waste away.

286
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,844
- Maybe I'd better ship
her off to Lourdes.

287
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:34,870
- That'd be a waste of time.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

288
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,700
A lot of charlatans around
who say they're doing good,

289
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,920
when really they're just
stealing from nice people,

290
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,353
when they are supposed to be helping them.

291
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:44,186
- Miss Hudson wants to know

292
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:45,500
when the cleaning people are comin' back.

293
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,670
- A couple weeks, when
are you comin' back?

294
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,777
- I don't know, hard for me to set a time,

295
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:51,340
what with my call backs.

296
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,900
- Oh, I see, so you're
just gonna pop in whenever

297
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,330
you want to, even if it's
not convenient to me, huh?

298
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,130
Oh, sure, hell, you do what you want!

299
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,975
You just come by whenever you want.

300
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:01,308
As long as we're still here!

301
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:05,142
(door closes)

302
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,430
(dark string music)

303
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,750
- Thank you, darling.

304
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,501
Thank you.

305
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,486
- Room service.

306
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:10,653
(music swells and intensifies)

307
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:13,486
(Blanche screams)

308
00:22:16,153 --> 00:22:16,986
- Jane!

309
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,112
Jane!

310
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:26,065
Jane!

311
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,015
Jane!

312

336
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,430
I may not drive straight, have accidents--

337
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,420
- I never said that you did--

338
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,253
- I may not drive straight,
but I can still think straight.

339
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:27,540
- What're you getting at?

340
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,380
- You thought I didn't know
about you selling the house,

341
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,363
but I did, I know everything you do.

342
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,440
First you get rid of the house
and then you get rid of me.

343
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,373
- Jane, I didn't want to upset you.

344
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:42,210
This house is so expensive.

345
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,956
Some of my investments haven't worked out.

346
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:49,530
I just thought that--
- Yeah I bet you just thought.

347
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,233
- I got a letter from my business
manager and he said that--

348
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,860
- No, you didn't, I get the mail first.

349
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,050
- Oh, well, maybe it was a
telephone call, I don't remember.

350
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,883
- Liar.

351
00:25:57,883 --> 00:26:00,740
You're just a liar, you
always were a liar, Blanche.

352
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,870
I'll telephone your
business manager downstairs.

353
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,260
I wouldn't want you to tire
yourself with so much talking.

354
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,490
When I was a little
girl, I was a big star.

355
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,253
A bigger star than you ever were,

356
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:18,373
and I didn't have to kiss a lot
of wet sloppy mouths either.

357
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,160
My money bought this
house and always remember

358
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,113
that my money got you started.

359
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,443
Miss Big Fat Rotten-Movie Star.

360
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:41,580
(dog barks)

361
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,590
Hey, what you gonna do
about that damn dog?

362
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,520
- The barking bother you?

363
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,339
- Yeah, it bothers me and
bothers my sister, too.

364
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:50,950
- Well, we were thinking
about obedience school.

365
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,240
- You better do more than think about it.

366
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,100
- We're looking at several.
- Well, look harder.

367
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,103
Make it a quest.

368
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:03,326
(dog snarls)

369
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:51,093
(funky electronic music)

370
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:23,273
Hm, Blanche Hudson movie, I wouldn't.

371
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:28,300
Do you have machines here?

372
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,670
- Video machines?
- Yeah!

373
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,760
- No.
- Well, where can I get one?

374
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,240
- Beats me, try the Yellow Pages.

375
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,587
- You try the Yellow Pages,
make a list for the customer.

376
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:38,693
Go on, go on, go on!

377
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,770
- [Jane] Um, excuse me, I was wondering.

378
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,330
Do you have any Baby
Jane Hudson films here?

379
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,040
- Blanche Hudson, I'm
sorry, I wish we did.

380
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,010
- You remember them?
- Sure I do.

381
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,863
Northern Outpost, there was a
whole series of Outpost films.

382
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,773
Trail Through the Pine, no,
Trail Through the Trees.

383
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,373
Now, what was that song she
sang in Northern Outpost?

384
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:06,340
I always identified her with that song.

385
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,588
It was sort of a lullaby.

386
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:12,088
♪ Tomorrow's not far away ♪

387
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,910
- You're Baby Jane Hudson.

388
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,723
- Yeah.

389
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,173
- I'm honored.

390
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,963
I'm Billy Korn, with a K.

391
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,800
- Hello, Billy.
(Billy laughs)

392
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,750
See, I was planning, um,

393
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,920
one day soon I'm gonna
get my career goin' again,

394
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,100
and I thought that if I could
look at some of my old films--

395
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,770
- I thought big movie
stars had screening rooms

396
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,920
right in their homes.
- Oh, I do!

397
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,410
Daddy built me an underground
movie theater, but the prints'

398
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,180
all scratchy and since they
put my sister's films on tape,

399
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,863
I figured that they'd put mine on, too.

400
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,643
Seems they didn't!

401
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,110
- Oh, Miss Hudson, if I can
get Braindead over there

402
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,350
to look after things, can
I buy you a cup of coffee?

403
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,183
- Gotta go home.

404
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,230
- Well, uh, there's some right over there.

405
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,580
I'll pour us two cups
and walk you to your car.

406
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,823
I've been out here for a long time now.

407
00:30:36,823 --> 00:30:38,770
It's just starting to pay off.

408
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,690
I've gave up on agents,
I'm a personal manager now,

409
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,550
for myself and a couple other clients.

410
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,070
I figure I can sell myself
better than anybody else.

411
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,483
Got some good contacts, too.

412
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,460
So, just, uh,

413
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,260
what did you mean about getting
your career going again?

414
00:30:55,948 --> 00:30:58,740
- Well, I haven't really thought about it.

415
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,403
Maybe a one-woman show?

416
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,180
Could do a couple of songs
from the early films,

417
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,820
and there was a song that
I recorded with my sister.

418
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,737
That was real popular.
- There Should Be Love.

419
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:12,220
(laughs) I've got the
score on an old album.

420
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,800
Music was second nature to me.

421
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,210
Hell, I've done everything,
I've booked acts,

422
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,610
written acts, choreographed, accompanied.

423
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,290
- You've done all that?
- Sure!

424
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,060
You know the business, boom or bust.

425
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,594
I had a bad year, got
overextended, so here I am.

426
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:29,003
(chuckles) You gotta pay the
rent, but I'll get it together.

427
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,913
- Thanks, Billy.

428
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,980
- You know, maybe we oughta talk.

429
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,000
I know your work, I know what you can do.

430
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,650
I bet I could create something
we'd both be proud of.

431
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,270
- Really?

432
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,193
- Can I call you?

433
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,210
- Yeah.

434
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,773
Yeah, you can call me.

435
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,593
Here.

436
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,103
- (laughs) Why not?

437
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:20,939
(chuckles)

438
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:26,656
(dark string music)

439
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:43,347
(Blanche groans)

440
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,345
- Hello.

441
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:09,730
It's Blanche, Blanche Hudson,
can I speak to Dr. Shelby?

442
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,250
You've gotta help me,
I've got to speak to him.

443
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,583
Well, interrupt him!

444
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,430
I'm sorry, I don't mean to
be rude, it's an emergency.

445
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:20,833
Come on, come on.

446
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,560
Dr. Shelby?

447
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,043
Yes, it's about Jane,
she's drinking again.

448
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,340
She's hostile, she's...

449
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:38,700
Well, I don't know if
she's taking her pills.

450
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,388
Not yet, she isn't violent
yet, but she's unbalanced.

451
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:43,638
I'm frightened.

452
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,700
Could you come over, please,
could you come over here?

453
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:51,879
Oh, thank you.

454
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,813
Bye.

455
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:54,646
(yelps)

456
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:56,580
- You are trying to get
them to take me away!

457
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,413
- No, I'm not.

458
00:33:57,413 --> 00:34:00,450
No, Jane, I had to make,
my legs, they're so bad.

459
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,780
The circulation's so bad, I
had to get a prescription.

460
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,090
- Yes, a prescription for me, you mean,

461
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,877
'cause you wanna keep me doped up!

462
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,347
- Oh, Jane, you know those pills help you.

463
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:10,330
- I know what you and
Dr. Shelby have planned!

464
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,641
- No, we weren't planning anything.

465
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:15,100
- Stop lying, will you
stop lying, Blanche!

466
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,250
Stop lying!
- I'm not!

467
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:20,370
I'm just trying to remind you,
Jane, that when you do take

468
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,578
those pills, you know, you're
not so neurotic or paranoid,

469
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:27,710
and you're not imagining that
everyone's trying to lock you

470
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,160
up or put you away, you know?

471
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,003
A chemical imbalance, it's very common.

472
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,350
Oh, god, you are so lucky
there is something you can take

473
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,363
that will help you.

474
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,270
Oh, god, you're so lucky there's something

475
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,438
you can take to help you.

476
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:47,400
(yelps)

477
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,490
- Yeah, that was very good,
Blanche, that was a very sly

478
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,350
reworking of the shrink
you played in Other Faces.

479
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,610
I'm gonna give you seven
out of a possible 10

480
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,193
for performance and zip for originality.

481
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,300
You always were a
personality actress, Blanche.

482
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,323
Same performance.

483
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,847
Different outfit.

484
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,790
I know that performance backwards.

485
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:14,270
Oh, hello, this is Blanche
Hudson again, I'm sorry.

486
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,437
Is Dr. Shelby still there?

487
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:21,359
And you thought I couldn't act.

488
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,610
Oh, hello, Dr. Shelby.

489
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,393
Thank god I caught you in time.

490
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:32,143
I was feeling a little
hysterical, that's all.

491
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:37,143
Being alone and all that, but
Jane's here now and I'm fine.

492
00:35:37,673 --> 00:35:39,170
- Dr. Shelby!

493
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,710
- Yes, Jane, I have Dr.
Shelby on the phone.

494
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,793
I was feeling a little
deserted, I'm alright now.

495
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:49,269
Thank you.

496
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:01,434
- Help!
(dramatic music)

497
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:02,897
Help me!

498
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:05,217
Somebody help me, please!

499
00:36:05,217 --> 00:36:08,217
Oh, help me, help me, help me, help!

500
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:11,400
Help, help, help!

501
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:14,660
(screams)

502
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:40,150
- When we were kids
and I was still a star,

503
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,337
you had to depend on me.

504
00:36:42,337 --> 00:36:46,530
The house, food, clothes on your back.

505
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,280
It all came from me and
you hated me for that.

506
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,090
You never thanked me for anything.

507
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,490
I paid for your acting classes,

508
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,853
for Mother and Daddy's funeral.

509
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,080
I paid for everything.

510
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,563
And now you have to depend
on me for everything again.

511
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,200
One thing I'm happy about, though.

512
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,490
Daddy died while I was still a star.

513
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,873
And you were still my stand-in.

514
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,100
See how funny life is, Blanche?

515
00:37:24,302 --> 00:37:27,135
We're right back where we started.

516
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:15,222
(peaceful electronic music)

517
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,763
(knocks)

518
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,910
- [Billy] Oh.

519
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,113
Hi. (chuckles)
- Billy.

520
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,578
You got any cigarettes?
- Well, sure.

521
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:49,411
Sure.

522
00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:52,313
Here you go.
- Thanks.

523
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,590
We're still waiting for our money.

524
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,730
- Well, I haven't gotten paid yet.

525
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,060
- Well, somebody got paid.

526
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,850
Me and Tom are on your
local news stands nude.

527
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,470
- You got paid for the session.

528
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,538
- We want 250 more for each
publication, we count four here.

529
00:39:05,538 --> 00:39:08,140
- I'm onto something, it'll be ready cash.

530
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,745
- You got a week, Billy,
then things get ugly.

531
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:12,642
(chuckles) We're underage.

532
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,330
(Billy chuckles)

533
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,590
You can meet the new kid
tonight, he's got some film,

534
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,670
but you gotta be a better
broker than you've been.

535
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,003
- Okay, okay.

536
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:26,907
Yeah.

537
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:35,188
(phone rings)

538
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:39,437
(phone rings)

539
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:42,317
(phone rings)

540
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:44,500
(phone rings)

541
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,410
- Hello?

542
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,932
- Miss Hudson, it's Billy Korn.

543
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:50,580
- Oh, hello, Mr. Korn.

544
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,730
- Please, call me Billy, Miss Hudson.

545
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,773
- Oh, (chuckles) sorry, Billy.

546
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,473
If I call you Billy, you'll
have to call me Jane.

547
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,710
- Alright. (chuckles)

548
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,690
Jane. (chuckles)

549
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,810
I thought we should get
together as soon as possible.

550
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,250
You know the business, time is money.

551
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,543
- Yeah, well, how about right now?

552
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,150
No, tell you what, give
me an hour, make it two?

553
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,050
- Alright.

554
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,940
- Yeah, you have my
address, 168 North Plymouth.

555
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,403
Uh-huh, bye.

556
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,973
- Jane.

557
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:45,543
(dark string music)

558
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:55,532
- It's good.

559
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,050
- Is the scarf new?
- No.

560
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:07,228
But the belt is new.

561
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:42,453
- Mrs. Trotter!

562
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:45,469
(upbeat electronic music)

563
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,277
Mrs. Trotter!

564
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:50,777
(upbeat electronic music)

565
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,510
- Billy!

566
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,790
Billy, we want you to meet someone.

567
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,669
- I can't, I've got an appointment.

568
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:07,502
- But this is the boy I
was telling you about!

569
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:16,979
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

570
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,335
- [Billy] Hm.

571
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:58,475
(doorbell rings)

572
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,308
- Hi.

573
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,863
Remember this outfit?

574
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,693
Northern Outpost?

575
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,063
All the Outpost films, I wore this outfit.

576
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,823
Had it made years ago.

577
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,513
Put it on for you.

578
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:24,013
- That was nice. (chuckles)

579
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,610
I just love these fine old homes.

580
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,850
This is what Hollywood used to be.

581
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,060
- It was a wonderful time.

582
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,680
- I could've been Ray
Moland or Robert Taylor

583
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,990
taking my constitutional up your street.

584
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,233
I really felt like I was back in the 40s.

585
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:47,410
- You didn't drive?

586
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,323
- No, my car's with my mechanic.

587
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,820
- Well, come into the living room.

588
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,653
- Oh.

589
00:43:56,605 --> 00:43:59,740
Oh, this is wonderful.
(Jane giggles)

590
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,190
Now, this was your parents' house?

591
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,870
- Oh, yeah, yeah, but I
paid for it, you know,

592
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,862
with all the money that I
earned, we all lived here,

593
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:09,230
but of course, it wasn't
smart enough for my sister

594
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,450
when she became Miss High
and Mighty, so she moved out.

595
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,030
- Oh, she doesn't--

596
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,570
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

597
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,020
But when I had my episode,
she moved back in to take care

598
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,722
of me but now I'm taking care
of her, isn't that somethin'?

599
00:44:22,722 --> 00:44:25,490
(chuckles) Here, look here, it's Daddy.

600
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,163
- Oh.
- Isn't that great?

601
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,570
Oh, I have all kinds, I've
got cream cake and caramel.

602
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,570
I just love petit four, I
usually buy half a dozen,

603
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,410
but I just limit myself to one a day.

604
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,380
Got these today.
(buzzing)

605
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,580
Here.

606
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,890
- Oh.

607
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:49,350
I'll try the, uh, the caramel. (laughs)

608
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,460
- Oh, this is Daddy's favorite chair.

609
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,340
I bought it for him.
(buzzing)

610
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,190
Here, why don't you go
ahead and help yourself.

611
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,690
I'll be right back, then you just join me

612
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,200
in the rehearsal room over there?

613
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,113
I'll be there.

614
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,040
- Who's downstairs?
- It's none of your business.

615
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,723
Is it so hard to believe
somebody would come to visit me?

616
00:45:24,952 --> 00:45:27,070
- What are you trying to do to me?

617
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,803
- You mean what are you doing to me?

618
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,933
Listen to this damn buzzer for
20 years and I am sick of it.

619
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,100
Oh, you didn't want your dinner?

620
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,490
I made it just the way you like it.

621
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,673
Mm!

622
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,270
Onions and seasoning, this is good.

623
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:51,780
I'll save it for Tweak when he gets back

624
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,047
from obedience school.

625
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:54,783
- What?

626
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,510
- Yeah, ran into our nextdoor
neighbor this afternoon,

627
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,583
and he says they found a
dog school that takes rats.

628
00:46:02,908 --> 00:46:04,980
- I'm hungry!

629
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,520
- Well, of course you're hungry,

630
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,127
you don't eat what I put out for you!

631
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,970
- You're trying to kill me.
- (chuckles) No.

632
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,508
- Yes, you are, you're
trying to starve me to death!

633
00:46:13,508 --> 00:46:15,420
You're frightened to eat!

634
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,840
- I'm not trying to starve you to death.

635
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,147
That would be a silly thing to do.

636
00:46:18,147 --> 00:46:22,740
- Oh, yes, yes, it would,
because if something happened

637
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,100
to me, something bad, there
wouldn't be any money.

638
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,960
- Yeah, there'd be money.
- Oh, but not for you!

639
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,970
Because they'd have to
put you away somewhere,

640
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,120
and I wouldn't be there
to sign the checks!

641
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,123
What do you think of that?

642
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:51,354
- Yep.

643
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:55,363
- Good.

644
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:57,313
Then you bring me some dinner.

645
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,063
- I'm gonna have my career
again, what do you think of that?

646
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:21,408
♪ My love will go with you ♪

647
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:23,928
♪ Protect you and such ♪

648
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:28,928
♪ I'll see you in the morning's day ♪

649
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:32,594
♪ Tomorrow is not far away ♪

650
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,170
- You remembered.

651
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,220
- And not a dry eye in
the house, I'll bet.

652
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,870
- They'll expect me to sing that.

653
00:47:42,508 --> 00:47:44,520
- It's a little dated. (chuckles)

654
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,540
- Oh, what about a new arrangement?

655
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,750
- Well, it's a lullaby, you
can't really update that.

656
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,890
You know, we oughta get the
business part out of the way

657
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,890
before we go on.
- What business part?

658
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:57,013
- You know, the ugly
money part. (chuckles)

659
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:59,860
- (giggles) What'll it cost?
- Well, I wanna try it out.

660
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,320
Test it at a club, a cabaret,
a showcase kind of thing.

661
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,680
That's when the agents come.
- Really?

662
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,400
- Do a couple of songs,
'cause that's all the time

663
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,090
they'll give us, you
know, see what happens.

664
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,880
- Is that expensive?
- It could run...

665
00:48:13,597 --> 00:48:14,973
$1,000.

666
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,450
But that's for the spot,
you know, advertising,

667
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,030
paying the lighting man,
the costumes, arrangements,

668
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,280
choreography, everything.

669
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,173
If you want a little time, think it over?

670
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,800
- When could we do it?
- When they got room.

671
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,190
The owner's a friend of mine,
you want me to make a call?

672
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,240
- Oh.

673
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,840
- You know, this is the kind
of break that could put us

674
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,090
both right over the top.

675
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,283
- Really?
- Really.

676
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:46,705
- Yeah, go ahead, you make
that call, phone's in the hall!

677
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:47,788
There.
- Okay.

678
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,540
- Mrs. Trotter, this is your
neighbor, Blanche Hudson.

679
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,060
I need your help, I'm
unable to use the phone.

680
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,050
Could you please call Dr. Shelby for me?

681
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,850
His number is 555-6314.

682
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,500
And ask him to come over at once.

683
00:49:19,453 --> 00:49:23,093
(gasps) Please, don't tell
my sister about this message.

684
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,780
For me, his number is 555-6314.

685
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,900
And ask him to come over at once.

686
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,160
- [Billy] Okay, I'll find
out and I'll call you

687
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,833
later tonight, (laughs) alright.

688
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,400
- Look at this, Sword of Excellence award.

689
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,653
I won it when I was a little
girl for the Outpost films.

690
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,440
- Real nice.

691
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,670
Listen, Jane, I've got
good news and bad news.

692
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,320
They want both you and your sister.

693
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,117
- No, my sister's in a
wheelchair, it's my act, not hers.

694
00:50:04,117 --> 00:50:05,680
- I'll talk to him.

695
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,903
I told you, Luther the
owner's a friend of mine.

696
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,949
- Well, when do we do it?
- Wednesday.

697
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:09,820
- What? So soon?

698
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,920
- I know almost all the songs
already and the choreography.

699
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,130
Everything.

700
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:19,130
You could do Orphan of Love
and, uh, There Should Be Love.

701
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,353
- The music's on the piano,
There Should Be Love.

702
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,410
- Alright! (laughs)

703
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,243
Okay.

704
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,613
Medium bounce.

705
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,763
(upbeat piano music)

706
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:47,230
(laughs) Okay.

707
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:51,189
- Again.
(upbeat piano music)

00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:54,135
♪ There should be love ♪

709
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:57,687

710
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,551

♪ You should be there ♪

714
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,673
I did sing beautifully
when I was very young.

715
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:27,363
- I know.

716
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,218
(chuckles) I know.

717
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,353
It's okay.

718
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:38,263
Jane, you could lip-sync to the record.

719
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,440
- Who'd sing Blanche's part?
- Oh.

720
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,470
- We were on the record together!

721
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,610
- Alright, oh!

722
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,330
Alright, we'll black out
one side of the stage.

723
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:51,570
You'll be in a spotlight
and Blanche's voice just

724
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,440
comes out of the darkness.

725
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,520
- Will that work?
- Jane, you're a star.

726
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,570
Your sister's a star,
they're after an event.

727
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,320
Now, let's give 'em one.

728
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,420
You leave it to Billy.

729
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,013
- You're so nice.

730
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,050
(Billy chuckles)

731
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:11,830
- Um... (chuckles)

732
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:16,763
Well, I hate to bring this up
but I'm gonna need some money.

733
00:52:18,092 --> 00:52:18,925
- When?

734
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,810
- [Billy] Tomorrow?

735
00:52:21,817 --> 00:52:22,734
- Tomorrow?

736
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:24,990
Um...

737
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,603
Tomorrow I give you half?

738
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,720
- That'll be fine.

739
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,313
Oh, I should be going.

740
00:52:39,313 --> 00:52:42,160
- I'll drive you, where do you live?

741
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,874
- Oh, you just drop me in Hollywood.

742
00:52:44,874 --> 00:52:45,707
- Yeah?

743
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:56,079
Where do you want me to stop?

744
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,735
Just here?

745
00:52:57,735 --> 00:52:58,568
Here?

746
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,920
- Okay, so I'll come
by tomorrow around 10,

747
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,090
and we could go to the bank together.

748
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,720
- What do they want?
- No they don't want anything.

749
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,817
Go away, go on.
- They scare me.

750
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,410
- Jane, you go on home,
alright, there's no reason

751
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,850
why you should ever have
to see any of this, okay?

752
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,030
Go on, hey, get away from there.

753
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,250
Go on, Jane.

754
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,393
Jane, just drive off, just go home, go on.

755
00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:34,635
(horn honks)
(tires screech)

756
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,740
- You alright, lady?

757
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,753
- I wanna go home!

758
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,573
- Where's home?

759
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,010
- Plymouth Street!

760
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,573
- That's easy.

761
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,953
That's highland over there.

762
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:04,443
Take a right, you go straight down.

763
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,880
- Right, thanks.

764
00:54:10,508 --> 00:54:11,341
- Hey, lady!

765
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:12,697
Do you want me to go with you?

766
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,036
(Jane sighs)

767
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,043
(door unlocks)

768
00:54:47,043 --> 00:54:50,376
- I've gotta go out, important business.

769
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:52,983
Get you breakfast later.

770
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,633
Sorry, I'm in a rush.

771
00:55:44,794 --> 00:55:48,377
(melancholic string music)

772
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:42,225
My sister wants it all in
cash today, she endorsed it.

773
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:45,600
- Well, usually she deposits
her monthly allowance.

774
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,330
If she doesn't, she normally calls us.

775
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:51,530
- She endorsed it, there
isn't a problem, is there?

776
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,363
- No.

777
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,283
Wait just a moment.

778
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,890
Fine, how would you like that?

779
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,506
- Big bills.

780
00:58:16,506 --> 00:58:17,339
- Okay.

781
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:28,838
Thank you.

782
00:58:30,196 --> 00:58:33,196
(dark string music)

783
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,777
(music swells and intensifies)

784
00:58:57,832 --> 00:59:00,665
(Blanche screams)

785
00:59:05,423 --> 00:59:06,770
- [Billy] You can just
drop me right over here.

786
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:10,090
Yeah, just right around
here, just right here.

787
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:12,820
Yeah, this is good, alright.

788
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,450
Okay.
- I'll see ya.

789
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,300
- I'll be over in just a little while,

790
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,540
and we'll have a rehearsal, alright?

791
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,170
Now, you know, Jane, they
still want your sister

792
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,420
to be part of the act.
- What do you mean, Billy?

793
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,160
We talked about it, you said--
- Relax, no, relax, relax.

794
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,840
I told them, I told them.
- You told me before that--

795
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,060
- I told them Blanche was disabled.

796
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,680
- You said before that they wanted her,

797
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,570
and I don't want her in it.
- Jane, it's all fixed.

798
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,964
- She's in a wheelchair, Billy.

799
00:59:32,964 --> 00:59:35,439
Billy, she's in a wheelchair
and I don't want her in there.

800
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:38,820
- Jane, I fixed it,
everything's okay, it's okay.

801
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,990
- It better be.
- Yes.

802
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,006
Jane, Jane!

803
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:44,423
(horn honks)

804
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:50,690
Jane?
(horn honks)

805
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,523
Jane!

806
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,293
She's crazy.

807
00:59:58,293 --> 00:59:59,126
Crazy.

808
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,470
- Everything grows so
fast here in California.

809
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:35,720
Especially all the weeds.

810
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,383
- I wonder where I dropped this.

811
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,680
- The winds that you have
here in California are really

812
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,250
something, what are they
called, they're something,

813
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,650
they happen in October,
it's Spanish, it's...

814
01:00:59,631 --> 01:01:01,048
- [Jane] Blanche?

815
01:01:30,247 --> 01:01:33,664
(dark atmospheric music)

816
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,083
- Hello!

817
01:02:16,173 --> 01:02:17,006
Jane?

818
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:22,101
Jane, Dominick.

819
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,780
- (yelps) What are you doing here?

820
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,050
- [Dominick] Told me I
could come whenever I want,

821
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:41,660
'cause of my crazy schedule.

822
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,270
- I don't remember.
- Well, you did.

823
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,164
- She doesn't wanna see you.
- What are you talking about?

824
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:47,997
- Well...

825
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,463
She's got another therapist.

826
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,620
- Well, nobody called me.

827
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,350
- Oh, I know, I'm sorry, I should have.

828
01:03:00,154 --> 01:03:01,570
- [Dominick] What's the matter?

829
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,607
- Well, nothing's the
matter, you gotta go now.

830
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:08,520
- [Dominick] You haven't been
takin' your pills, have you?

831
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,000
- None of your business!

832
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,100
- Why are you so anxious to get rid of me?

833
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,200
- I got things to do, I gotta rehearse!

834
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,073
- So, rehearse.

835
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,357
- I told you, she does not wanna see you.

836
01:03:18,357 --> 01:03:20,300
- [Dominick] Yeah I think I'll
let her tell me that herself.

837
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,100
- This is my house!
- It's half your house.

838
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,143
I'm gonna go talk to the
other half, you calm down.

839
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:34,403
Jane.

840
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,240
Jane, come on, move.

841
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,738
- Hey, don't--
- Move.

842
01:03:39,738 --> 01:03:40,571
(knocks)

843
01:03:40,571 --> 01:03:41,404
Blanche, Blanche?

844
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,290
Why'd you lock this door?

845
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,800
- I don't have to tell you anything.

846
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,670
- Where's the key?
- I don't have the key.

847
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,327
- Jane, give me that key.
- I don't have it.

848
01:03:49,327 --> 01:03:51,900
Hey, that's my purse, that's
my personal things in there!

849
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,400
There's nothin' in there, I...

850
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:01,080
(suspenseful music)

851
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,913
(Blanche mumbles)

852
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:05,863
- Blanche.

853
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:09,583
I'm so sorry.
(Blanche mumbles)

854
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:10,633
I'm gonna get you up.

855
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,630
You stay right there, you understand me?

856
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:20,620
I warned you, Blanche.

857
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,090
I warned you something
like this might happen.

858
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,473
It's okay, you're safe now.

859
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,461
I'm gonna take care of
you just like I promised.

860
01:04:28,461 --> 01:04:31,294
(Blanche screams)

861
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:35,686
(dramatic music)

862
01:04:43,157 --> 01:04:45,324
(screams)

863
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:55,754
(groans)

864
01:05:01,215 --> 01:05:03,965
(Blanche grunts)

865
01:05:05,678 --> 01:05:09,178
(Billy whistles jauntily)

866
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:33,555
(Billy whistles jauntily)

867
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:56,540
(doorbell rings)
(suspenseful music)

868
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:59,290
(doorbell rings)

869
01:06:54,328 --> 01:06:55,161
- Hello?

870
01:07:18,474 --> 01:07:19,867
(Jane yelps)

871
01:07:19,867 --> 01:07:22,040
- What are you doing here?
- I was looking for you.

872
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,170
We had a rehearsal, you know,
the side door's not locked.

873
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,360
And you weren't around,

874
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,483
I thought something might
have happened to you.

875
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:30,807
What's the matter?

876
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,250
- What about posters?

877
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,880
You said there'd be posters.

878
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,012
- There's not enough time.

879
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:43,000
Posters are for the real
gig, Wednesday night is about

880
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,830
reacquainting you with the public again.

881
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:47,593
It's for agents and casting people.

882
01:07:52,021 --> 01:07:53,948
- What about my dressing room?

883
01:07:53,948 --> 01:07:55,610
- [Billy] The dressing
rooms are already taken.

884
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:56,863
This is just a showcase.

885
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:02,269
- You mean there's somebody
else on the same bill?

886
01:08:02,269 --> 01:08:03,102
I didn't know there'd be
anybody on the same bill.

887
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:05,950
- It's better having more
than one on the same bill.

888
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,730
There's less pressure this way.

889
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:09,410
Jane, I know you're scared.

890
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:12,470
It's been a long time, but
you're gonna be wonderful.

891
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:15,410
Jane, now do you believe me, hm?

892
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:18,370
You know, we don't have a
lot of time, so do you think

893
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:21,460
you can pull yourself
together enough to rehearse?

894
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,293
Jane?

895
01:08:23,453 --> 01:08:26,120
(chain rattles)

896
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,557
"Hudson sisters had a song
together in the film and that

897
01:08:53,557 --> 01:08:56,570
"was There Should Be Love,"
then the spot on the curtain,

898
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,708
then the music and now.

899
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:00,640
(upbeat pop music)

900
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,810
Jane, Jane.

901
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:05,130
On the music, the intro is
when you come down the stairs.

902
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:07,465
Right, come down now, yeah.

01:09:21,646 --> 01:09:23,310
- She's not wearing that outfit.

908
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:24,717
- No.

909
01:09:24,717 --> 01:09:28,050
No, she's wearing the actual
dress she wore in the film.

910
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,660
- [Luther] I've been
hearing some things about

911
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,450
your Jane Hudson, did
you get your money yet?

912
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:34,190
- Had. (chuckles)

913
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:35,493
My back rent ate that up.

914
01:09:36,599 --> 01:09:37,700
- How many times have you done this?

915
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,056
When are you gonna learn?
- Why?

916
01:09:39,056 --> 01:09:40,820
What're you talking about?

917
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:44,190
- She's crazy.

918
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,740
Tried to run down her sister
after one of those Hollywood

919
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:51,740
parties, then she drove off,
didn't see her for three days.

920
01:09:51,906 --> 01:09:53,150
I bet she doesn't even remember doing it.

921
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:55,470
- That's old news, cheap gossip.

922
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,370
That story's been around
longer than you have.

923
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:58,990
- Did you know that they
found her shacked up

924
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,800
with an actor she was makin' a movie with?

925
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,750
- So, what's so special about that?

926
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,930
- [Luther] She was drunk
and crazy, a raving lunatic.

927
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:09,080
They had to lock up the
silly broad in an asylum.

928
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,653
Her sister had her released.

929
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,560
Imagine that, after all she'd done to her.

930
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,483
- Must be love, like the song says.

01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,390
- That's not true, Jane.

934
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,343
Luther loved you and he loved your act.

935
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:34,483
You still owe me $500, you know, Jane?

936
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,823
So, you will bring it tonight, won't you?

937
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,547
Good.

938
01:10:40,547 --> 01:10:45,150
Alright, now, we're on
between 9:30 and 10,

939
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,183
so be there by nine, alright?

940
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:49,690
Okay.

941
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:50,623
Bye, Jane.

942
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,113
- Oh, Billy?

943
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,360
See you tonight?
- Yeah.

944
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,890
- Oh, have our money, or
we'll a couple of phone calls.

945
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,180
- We wouldn't want you
be in jail on crutches.

946
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,480
- Okay.

947
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,610
Okay.

948
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,710
You'll get your money.

949
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:26,250
- Blanche, what do you think?

950
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,083
Blanche?

951
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,313
Blanche.

952
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,577
What do you think?

953
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:46,926
(Blanche mumbles)

954
01:11:55,481 --> 01:11:59,350
- Want some water, please,
give me some water.

955
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:00,893
- Oh, you always make trouble.

956
01:12:05,346 --> 01:12:08,096
(water splashes)

957
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:10,703
Here.

958
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,110
Here.

959
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:19,773
It's gonna be my second debut.

960
01:12:22,191 --> 01:12:24,330

961
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:25,213
Wish me luck!

962
01:12:32,756 --> 01:12:35,673
(hums melodically)

963
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:08,223
- Hey!

964
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:11,417
That's not the entrance, lady!

965
01:13:11,417 --> 01:13:12,890
That's for the talent!

966
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:13,853
- I know that.

967
01:13:15,714 --> 01:13:19,100
(muffled jazz music)

968
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:19,933
Billy?

969
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:22,934
Oh, excuse me, I'm looking for Billy Korn.

970
01:13:22,934 --> 01:13:23,767
- Shh.

971
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:33,793
- I'm looking for my manager.
- Shh, shh, shh.

972
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,903
- Oh, have you seen my manager?

973
01:13:56,419 --> 01:13:57,480
(knocks)
- Occupied.

974
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,700
- Billy?
- Oh, Jane, thank god.

975
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,680
You're late, you're on next.
- What?

976
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,513
- Got your props?
- No!

977
01:14:02,513 --> 01:14:04,780
- [Billy] Go get it, wait
in the wings for your cue!

978
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,613
- Okay.

979
01:14:19,278 --> 01:14:20,450
- One minute to go.
- Okay.

980
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,283
- Here's your dummy mic.
- I got it.

981
01:14:22,283 --> 01:14:24,884
- Uh, you hold this, right?

982
01:14:24,884 --> 01:14:25,717
- Oh.

983
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:32,833
- Are you okay?
- Of course I'm okay.

984
01:14:38,388 --> 01:14:41,388
(audience applauds)

985
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,430
- [Host] Along the Way was
made during the sixties.

986
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:48,770
It starred Blanche and Jane Hudson,

987
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:52,150
stars of different eras
and sisters in real life.

988
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:54,240

01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,447

Like no time has passed.

1029
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:58,653
I remember the woodsy
sawdust smell of the set.

1030
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:03,850
And also lamps that had been on too long.

1031
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,653
And they smelled to me like wax melting.

1032
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:12,170
And I can feel the hugs and I
can hear the congratulations

1033

everywhere I went 'cause
I was so important then.

1034

All of my pictures made money.

1035
01:18:19,205 --> 01:18:21,940
That's why they gave me this award.

1036
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:25,723

01:19:44,651 --> 01:19:45,901
Blanche Hudson.

1041
01:19:57,763 --> 01:19:59,846
What has she done to you?

1042
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:14,737

- [Jane] Blanche?

1047
01:21:11,053 --> 01:21:14,714
- I came back for the
money you owe me, Jane.

1048
01:21:14,714 --> 01:21:15,680
- What money?

1049
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,660
- It's not a lot of money, Jane.

1050
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,834
Not to you, it isn't.

1051
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:21,347
But it is to me.

1052
01:21:21,347 --> 01:21:23,193
- Always about money, Blanche.

1053
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,433
- I need it badly, Jane.

1054
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:30,233
If you don't have it, maybe
we could work something out.

1055
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,363
I wanna be your friend, Jane.

1056
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:41,072
I consider myself a very
good friend, am I right?

1057
01:21:41,072 --> 01:21:45,905
(flesh squelches)
(gasps)

1058
01:21:48,047 --> 01:21:50,130
(groans)

1059
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:55,949
(music swells)

1060
01:22:16,713 --> 01:22:17,546
- Billy.

1061
01:22:49,311 --> 01:22:51,811
(birds tweet)

1062
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:16,089
Blanche?

1063
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,063
Blanche, we can go away now.

1064
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:33,203
Just like you wanted.

1065
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,963
Everyone's gone.

1066
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:38,823
They've all gone.

1067
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,563
Do you hear me, Blanche?

1068
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:43,770
Do you hear what I said?

1069
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,513
We can go to the beach.

1070
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,313
You like the beach, remember?

1071
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:08,590
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

1072
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:11,913
Say yes.

1073
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,863
- Yeah.

1074
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,423
- Gotta go now.

1075
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:23,913
Gotta leave now.

1076
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:28,023
The dark here.

1077
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,623
It's always cold and dark.

1078
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:33,563
Wanna see the sun.

1079
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,150
Don't wanna be cold anymore.

1080
01:24:40,271 --> 01:24:41,104
- Yeah.

1081
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:03,380
- [Jane] Look what I got for you.

1082
01:25:04,429 --> 01:25:05,262
There.

1083
01:25:08,641 --> 01:25:10,037
- Jane.

1084
01:25:10,037 --> 01:25:11,953
I'm thirsty, please.

1085
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,980
- [Jane] Find someplace to get it.

1086
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,423
- Stop someone, please.

1087
01:25:20,784 --> 01:25:22,770
I need a doctor.

1088
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:26,480
- [Jane] No, 'cause then
they'll make me go away,

1089
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,813
and I wanna stay with you.

1090
01:25:31,113 --> 01:25:32,033
- I'm dying.

1091
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:34,610
- And I'll be alone.

1092
01:25:36,918 --> 01:25:39,335
(bell rings)

1093
01:25:46,463 --> 01:25:48,880
(bell rings)

1094
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,460
- Listen.

1095
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:07,700
That night I was driving
in the car and you weren't.

1096
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:12,700
You were full of drink,
full of dope and I hated you

1097
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:17,530
because you had so much
love when we were young

1098
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:22,530
and you tried to keep
me from having anything.

1099
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:26,630
- [Jane] Do you remember we
used to find bottles that were

1100
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:30,080
all worn, smooth from the ocean?

1101
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,110
They were like samphires and emeralds,

1102
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:33,360
and that kind of stuff?

1103
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,140
I liked that, those were the best times.

1104
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:38,500
- I lied to you, I cheated you.

1105
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:43,500
I wanted you dead, I
wanted to run you down.

1106
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:48,570
- [Jane] No I was driving that
car, Blanche, and I hurt you.

1107
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:52,490
- No, I was behind the wheel,

1108
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:56,422
and you were too drunk.

1109
01:26:56,422 --> 01:26:59,560
- No, that's not the way it was, Blanche.

1110
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,393
- I was...

1111
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:05,857
Thrown out of the car
and you were too drunk

1112
01:27:07,327 --> 01:27:10,860
and you were frightened and you ran away,

1113
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:15,860
and when they found me, I let them believe

1114
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:21,140
you did it and they found
and you were frightened

1115
01:27:22,498 --> 01:27:27,498
and confused and I was lying by the car,

1116
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:29,800
and they assumed you did it.

1117
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,633
- No.

1118
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,080
- What you thought...

1119
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:36,880
You did...

1120
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:40,053
I did.

1121
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,373
To myself.

1122
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:47,777
Because I wanted to hurt you.

1123
01:27:57,333 --> 01:28:01,833
- You mean, all these years,
we could've been friends?

1124
01:28:03,868 --> 01:28:06,817
(melancholic string music)

1125
01:28:06,817 --> 01:28:10,085
(Blanche sobs)

1126
01:28:10,085 --> 01:28:12,418
(Jane sobs)

1127
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:56,870
- Here you are, okay.
- Thanks!

1128
01:29:11,373 --> 01:29:14,123
(Blanche groans)

1129
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,618
There, I got us strawberry.

1130
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,213
You like strawberry.

1131
01:29:19,213 --> 01:29:20,046
Here.

1132
01:29:27,239 --> 01:29:28,072
- Jane.

1133
01:29:31,495 --> 01:29:32,328
I'm sorry.

1134
01:29:34,076 --> 01:29:35,576
I'm so very sorry.

1135
01:29:38,675 --> 01:29:41,258
- Nose will get red in the sun.

1136
01:29:48,154 --> 01:29:50,404
(chuckles)

1137
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:00,260
Maybe we could live at the beach.

1138
01:30:02,704 --> 01:30:06,037
(dark orchestral music)

1139
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:16,713
- Miss?

1140
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:19,680
Miss?

1141
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,960
Is that your white Cadillac over there?

1142
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,309
- Yeah.

1143
01:30:23,309 --> 01:30:24,409
- Are you Miss Hudson?

1144
01:30:25,595 --> 01:30:27,830
- (chuckles) Yeah.

1145
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:31,900
I'm Baby Jane Hudson and this
is my sister, Blanche Hudson.

1146
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:33,133
She's a movie star, too.

1147
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:39,330
- See if she can talk.
- Miss, can you hear me?

1148
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:40,720
Can you hear me?

1149
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,780
Miss.

1150
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,830
- Call for an ambulance.
- Right.

1151
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:47,620
This is 14-23 requesting
an ambulance, Venice Beach.

1152
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,400
100 feet north of the pier.

1153
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,450
It's a code three, we have a woman down.

1154
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:54,170
Pulse is low, breathing shallow.

1155
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:56,930
- [Dispatch] Yeah, we copy
14-23, what have you got?

1156
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:59,900
- [Officer] That's code three,
just north of Venice Pier.

1157
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,300
- [Dispatch] We copy, 14-23.

1158
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,767
- You're gonna be alright, miss.

1159
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:32,279
Miss Hudson!

1160
01:31:34,563 --> 01:31:35,563
Jane Hudson!

1161
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:55,942
- Papa!

1162
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,542
Let's live at the beach.

1163
01:32:10,542 --> 01:32:11,375
Can we?

1164
01:32:34,488 --> 01:32:37,821
(dark orchestral music)
