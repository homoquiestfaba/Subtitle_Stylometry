00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Claire of the Moon

1
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,783
Hello, can I help you? 

2
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,066
Cabine 4?

3
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,108
Yes...

4
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:30,451
Am I interrupting?

5
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:33,620
Amy, I can't do this by myself,
you know.

6
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:38,956
Oh, sorry, I did not know
we had the visit.

7
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,875
Dr. Benedict, I believe that...
this is your roommate 

8
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:46,418
Good morning.

9
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:51,786
Oh, I'll handle it.

10
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:56,747
Research...

11
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:05,231
Need any help?..

12
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:07,962
With your luggage.

13
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:12,214
No. No, I am fine.

14
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,415
Well, I'll better go back than.

15
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:45,982
Are you sure?

16
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:48,244
I can get a place nearby...

17
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:51,246
There is still so much to do...

18
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,737
Amy, it can wait that I come back...

19
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:55,811
Now I want you to leave before dark.

20
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:59,896
Non. And don't forget to call 
Sam when you get back to town.

21
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:09,256
Well ... Have fun, I guess...

22
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,372
Listen.. If I finish these reports
maybe I can...

23
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,394
Amy,... everything is under control.

24
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,405
Thank you for your help.

25
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:32,862
Wow, it's Claire Jabrowski!

26
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:39,220
Tara ... Tara O'Hara ... from the 
Writers Convention of Atlanta

27
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:41,930
Yes, how could I 
forget.

28
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:47,079
I never imagined you here
in this wild place. Not after L.A. 

29
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:49,278
Well, one jungle is as good
as the next.

30
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:52,811
I read all your books.
I loved them all.

31
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:53,749
Thank you.

32
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:55,135
Adrienne King.

33
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:57,595
Shilo.

34
00:06:57,803 --> 00:06:59,846
Shilo Starbright

35
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:06,600
Isn't it fascinating how those holistic types
comes with such conceptual names.

36
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:08,361
Unlike you.

37
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:13,406
Lynn Schroeder. I am excited to be here.

38
00:07:13,406 --> 00:07:17,137
I never ... well... I have published 
a short stories ...

39
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:22,348
But really to be in a company of
such celebrities! It's great.

40
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:24,964
Oh, isn't that...

41
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:29,321
Noel Benedict, Doctor of Love...

42
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:36,971
I have never read "The Naked Truth"
myself 

43
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:42,474
But from reliable soruces I heard that 
she simply left it all hang...

44
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,372
Simply every which way?

45
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,175
Personally I think she is frustrated
eunuch.

46
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:53,271
I think you got it wrong.
A eunuch means a castrated man.

47
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:58,253
If the shoe fits ...
I say wear it..

48
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:07,633
It is not a trivial sex therapist
circuit TV, you know, she is delusional...

49
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:08,363
Excuse me.

50
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,503
If you need anything ...
you yell!

51
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:22,214
But make it in the afternoons,
I am late-riser!

52
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:28,634
All cottages on the east side
are retreat cottages..

53
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:32,188
Those on the west side belong to locals

54
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:41,308
and many locals think that we are 
just group of crazy chicks 
trying to find a meaning of life!

55
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:47,395
Just remember girls,
when you are having one of those blocks

56
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:51,022
we are here to work.

57
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:53,450
All work and no play.

58
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,847
Usually gets published!

59
00:08:57,234 --> 00:09:04,529
Every Tursdays and Thursday at 17h we
have informal meetings 

60
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,230
where we discuss everything from syntax 
to playtex!

61
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:17,255
Optional, of course... but I can tell you
everybody starts 

62
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:22,758
looking foward to it after lonely, solitary
hours of neverending torture!

63
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:29,585
Well that was all for the
intiation. Any questions?

64
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:22,322
Excuse me. I could never 
work with loud music.

65
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,302
Sorry.

66
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:30,222
Well, I should get back to it.

67
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:31,681
Unless you want to hang out tonight.

68
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:35,319
I wanted to check out the local
coloure.

69
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:38,372
Thank you but...

70
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:41,416
You are dedicated, upright and disciplined.

71
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:49,201
So am I, but only when the mood
strikes me!

72
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,637
That's it. You wrote "Life can
ruin your hair".

73
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,681
It's been a while.

74
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:11,682
I saw you on Oprah.

75
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,133
Sells copy...

76
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,220
Did you... read it?

77
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:27,743
No, it wouldn't be your genre.

78
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:31,454
Great title.

79
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:35,800
It seamed appropriate at the time.

80
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:42,908
I was ... deeply miserable at therapy.

81
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:46,056
Has been known to have that effect.

82
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:16,209
You are up?

83
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:18,200
I am up, right.

84
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,880
Does the noise bother you?

85
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:26,590
I was about to take a break.

86
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:29,425
You have been up long?

87
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:30,509
Since 5h.

88
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,823
My God ... It's crazy.

89
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:42,839
Perhaps you might grind
your coffee at night.

90
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:02,141
Excuse me...

91
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:08,029
Is it really necessary to have
two going at the same time?

92
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,042
I am really focused here...
Can we do this later?

93
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:22,777
Sorry.

94
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:25,195
Don't be.

95
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:30,594
Just remember, never ending agony
is so addictive.

96
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:36,243
I am over that, Maggie... Really.

97
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:40,725
But it's so attractive to you, Noel.

98
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:46,165
Mysterious to the therapist
in terms of fine art... 

99
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:48,875
And for what?

100
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:53,680
Definitely not the "Object of Passion"

101
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:01,767
Obsessing over something you can't have
is the biggest turn on.

102
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:07,166
You create passion like you sniff it.

103
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:17,609
No possession, no intents, nothing.
It never existed, Noel.

104
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:26,395
Maggie... you are such god dam pain in the ass
when you play shrink.

105
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:36,172
But I am a lovable pain in the ass.

106
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:45,573
Dating?

107
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:47,741
Not seriously.

108
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:51,065
Sleeping around?

109
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:54,453
Occasionally.

110
00:15:56,016 --> 00:15:58,132
But no one in particular?

111
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:02,624
Maggie, what possessed you to put that
woman in my cabin?

112
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,304
Uh, I was wondering when will
you ask that question.

113
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:09,346
What were you thinking?

114
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,473
I thought that she will be good for you.

115
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,849
Get you out of yourself, I don't know...

116
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:18,195
I do, you get shit out of me. 

117
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:20,675
She is rude

118
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:26,022
...unorganised... she smokes like a truck driver

119
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:30,285
She is so... straight

120
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:32,588
But interesting...

121
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:36,538
But interesting as a black widow

122
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:37,977
Dangerous, ha?

123
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:40,144
Intolerable.

124
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,941
I know you'll like her.

125
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:29,140
Noel... I am sorry.

126
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:30,505
I mean about earlier.

127
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:34,747
No... it is not a problem

128
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:37,447
Well, it is actually...

129
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:40,886
I get so...

130
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:45,993
so, like nothing else exists.

131
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,643
I am not used to co-habitating

132
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,459
It is difficult, isn't it?

133
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:05,504
Sharing paradise with a stranger.

134
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:21,325
And for those of you who are suffering 
writing crisis or playing on weed


135
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:22,451
there is, always,  Humpwhale Inn.

136
00:18:22,763 --> 00:18:27,255
Planty of Hemingway's colloquialism
and ... trouble

137
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:32,706
But for tonight, this is the part when 
we go around and sample 

138
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:36,260
brillian bits of our marvelous 
inquiery minds.

139
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:43,212
And for those of us less refined, 
"get the dirt".

140
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:47,506
Non, no, no. Don't tell me. Let me guess.

141
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:51,904
I wouldn't dream of it.

142
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:54,374
Scorpion.

143
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,793
Astrology is just so...

144
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:00,732
Cosmique.

145
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:02,660
Isn't it, though?

146
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:06,402
Is this the part where you are
suposed to guess what I am?

147
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:09,143
Oh, but I know what you are.

148
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,813
It's a two step of communication:
one forward, one back

149
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:18,575
Until any progress made, it's 
forgotten.

150
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:21,421
Innuendo marquise the water.

151
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:25,975
Eskimos have 300 words that indicate snow.

152
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:29,842
And although we think of English
as complex language

153
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:37,065
there is a great need for more words
to accurately accomodate saddlety.

154
00:19:58,107 --> 00:20:02,620
Well, I've been playing around with this idea,
a long time.

155
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,654
I mean, I am only a housewife...
I am usualy so buissy.

156
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:12,522
I only had time for an outline.
I hope to get first draft while I am here.

157
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,585
while the twins are away.

158
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:19,296
Anyway,... it's about this planet.

159
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,590
Where men have to go through 
child birth...

160
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,394
in order to be allegeable
for what I call Alpha society

161
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:35,149
Derrick Rochester gray eyes poured
burning questions

162
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:44,279
through the black hair that felt over his
forehead, giving him appearance of a pirate.

163
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:51,084
And then she saw his throbbing menhood.

164
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:56,598
visible through his lean masculine 
thighs 

165
00:20:57,942 --> 00:20:59,693
he leaned his hand...

166
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:02,695
the valce was begining ...

167
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:09,438
Dare she dance this dance of forbidden love?

168
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:11,201
Words

169
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:12,775
Float

170
00:22:12,786 --> 00:22:14,578
Meaningless

171
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:17,997
Labels...

172
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:19,039
Separate...

173
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:23,239
Language binds..

174
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:28,284
But if there is none?

175
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:34,516
That is so...

176
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,801
Spiritual.

177
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:44,845
Personally, I think that we should
create a women language dictionary...

178
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:48,868
To incorporate all the nuances we
have no words (yet) for.

179
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,807
Oh, shit, I can see it now...

180
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:58,467
Men pulling out their little pocket translators...
stashed well behind their...

181
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,729
Maggie, don't be such a separatiste.

182
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:05,554
Men are just as interested in clear
communication as we are.

183
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:08,702
Than why we are having such god dam 
time understanding one another?

184
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,735
Because, we comunicate in two 
different languages.

185
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:16,842
So, they are different. But only thing 
important is language of loving.

186
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:18,926
Universal dance...

187
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:21,021
The primal connection.

188
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,825
You are talking about the Evil deed?

189
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:29,953
No, she is talking about great debate.

190
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:36,405
Well, so far as I am concerned that is
the only language we need.

191
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:40,667
That is probably what cave woman
said right after she was raped!

192
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:43,721
Maggie!

193
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:50,913
What about Dr. Benedict? You wrote
"Naked truth".

194
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:53,028
Stared quite a fire.

195
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:55,519
Noel is like that.

196
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,146
Tell me Doctor?

197
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:03,565
Don't you think that some things
are better left unsaid?

198
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:10,277
Yes. And I noticed how well you did
in that economy of expresions in ...

199
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:11,664
What was it?

200
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:13,998
"Lust in the night"

201
00:25:19,024 --> 00:25:20,889
Can I help you find something?

202
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:22,776
Aspirine.

203
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:53,574
Rough night?

204
00:25:56,565 --> 00:25:59,786
No pain, no gain.

205
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:02,214
There might be easier way?

206
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:04,090
You would know, right?

207
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:06,862
That is what you do, isn't it?

208
00:26:07,394 --> 00:26:09,603
You and your fucked up shrinks.

209
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,731
That is not term that I apply to
my practice.

210
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:21,214
Let's just say that I have never met a shrink
that is less fucked up than people they try to fix.

211
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,633
We are only human.

212
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:34,211
If a suregon was missing a piece of himself
like a hand or an eye,

213
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:37,556
I would expect him to find a different profession.

214
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:40,235
We are all missing pieces.

215
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,956
That does not mean that we can't 
help other to find theirs.

216
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:47,395
You therapysts...

217
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:52,846
You are so good in handing out aspirine,

218
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:55,233
and the obvious.

219
00:26:56,421 --> 00:27:00,788
If I was so obvious, I doubt 
you would be struggling so succesfuly.

220
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,337
I want another room.

221
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:16,161
What?

222
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:19,361
I am not in the mood for
experimental co-habitation.

223
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,687
Maggie! I can't get any work done.

224
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,834
She is intrusive, running in
all hours at night,

225
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:30,898
a slut ...

226
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:33,545
common garden version of a slut.

227
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:47,553
Do you suppose that we might get
an understanding?

228
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:48,825
I doubt it.

229
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,993
A compromise?

230
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:56,662
Look, we are just opposites.
You stay North, I'll stay South.

231
00:27:58,048 --> 00:28:01,154
Than pearhaps you might help so the
things smooth a little bit.

232
00:28:01,154 --> 00:28:04,114
You shrinks just love rules, don't you?

233
00:28:04,427 --> 00:28:09,138
Be spontaneour... Love life... Embrace it.
But do it by the rules.

234
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,868
Are you finished?

235
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:16,454
I came here to work.

236
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:20,446
But it is extremely difficult to be 
this fragmented.

237
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:24,542
I would like that situation is
bearable for both of us.

238
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:37,925
Good. First of all, our schedules are
completely different.

239
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:40,468
Your hours are completely opposite of mine.

240
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:45,981
I think that we can work something out, so
to respect each others phases and schedules.

241
00:29:58,427 --> 00:30:02,440
What? Have you forgotten women's 
movement?

242
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,482
Not at all.

243
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:10,152
We've been apoligizing ever since. 
Like a child discovering it's independence

244
00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:15,551
crawls bravely out but when spots
a bit of danger runs back to its mother.

245
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:21,586
We don't allow anyone, including 
ourselves, any individuality.

246
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,452
You mean sexual preference?

247
00:30:24,452 --> 00:30:25,974
All of it.

248
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:30,883
Theoretically, we are evolved group of women
who are, from one reason, or another

249
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:37,501
find a judgment with one another lifestyles,
work, compromises.

250
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:40,482
Some compromises are not worth it.

251
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:44,265
By that you refer to my lesbianism.

252
00:30:44,473 --> 00:30:48,549
If I've made any other choice that would 
have been the most costly compromise I could have made.

253
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:54,917
You are scandalized by my choices.
I don't take it personaly.

254
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,752
But you have illustrated my point.

255
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,598
Even lesbians don't allow much diversity
within our sub-culture.

256
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:06,652
We are simply too affraid to take
our power.

257
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,591
Maybe collectively.

258
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:16,731
But individualy there is an enormous
power in being a female.

259
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:20,118
If you know how to use it.

260
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:21,952
Exactly.

261
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:27,653
And I am not talking about rough
feminine wiles.

262
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:31,458
I mean taking they rules and 
shaving it back to they asses!

263
00:31:34,449 --> 00:31:38,837
I don't know. It just gives
me the willies.

264
00:31:38,837 --> 00:31:48,363
I mean, I am as open minded as the next person, 
but there is just something... unnatural about it.

265
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:52,719
I don't get it. She looks as normal as
you and me.

266
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:56,544
All I can say is: "What a waste!"

267
00:31:57,409 --> 00:31:59,066
Well Mrs O'Hara, for such an open
minded soul,

268
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:05,424
you talk like ignorant, misguided,
bigot.

269
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:08,019
She is very attractive.

270
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,573
I guess that I don't get it.

271
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,419
Maybe she was abused or something.

272
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,765
Boy, you are from the suburbs, 
aren't you?

273
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:23,069
Personally, I think it is a defect 
of nature.

274
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:31,605
Well, who would better know about defect
than a southerner.

275
00:32:31,814 --> 00:32:33,658
Mizz Tara?

276
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,063
It's from a client.

277
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:13,347
It is good.

278
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:16,880
Strong... energetic.

279
00:33:19,757 --> 00:33:22,216
I didn't mean to intrude.
I was just...

280
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:23,102
Wondering.

281
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:30,627
I begin to thing you were right 
about these meetings.

282
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:33,837
Oh, women can't help themselves.

283
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:37,746
Bitchiness, must be the Y chromosome!

284
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:46,375
You know, we are out numbered.

285
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:51,555
Yes, I don't know if you noticed

286
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:57,329
but we are surrounded by dangerously
bizzare women.

287
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:06,866
Do you want a drink?

288
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:12,160
Scotch, ok?

289
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:14,797
Yes.

290
00:34:37,268 --> 00:34:41,771
I would say that you have balls
but you'll probably take it wrong

291
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:44,512
What do you mean?

292
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,836
Tonight, being so out.

293
00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:50,755
Oh... that...

294
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:57,269
Well, it would not do any good to my clinets
and readers if I hide behind protocol.

295
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,907
That is not a problem, isn't it?

296
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,876
Not for me.

297
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,482
Some women...

298
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:08,410
Oh... don't worry.

299
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:12,110
I don't have any inner homophobia.

300
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,144
That's what you shrinks call it,
inner homophobia?

301
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:21,720
I am into what ever feels good 
at the moment.

302
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,055
And after that?

303
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:31,100
I wait for the next moment.

304
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,919
Tell me about this pornography thing.

305
00:35:45,347 --> 00:35:47,515
It is extension of the theory, actually.

306
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:48,286
About what?

307
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,902
Our cultural struggle with intimacy.

308
00:35:51,986 --> 00:35:55,467
The only way to achieve the most
powerful excitement is through taboo.

309
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,699
Pornography is being one level above erotic.

310
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:02,607
Close.

311
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:04,326
And...

312
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:07,120
What si erotic?

313
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:09,423
You tell me.

314
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:16,625
Hmh. You are supposed to be an expert on
this one Doc.

315
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:52,488
Please, don't stop.

316
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,396
I am finished.

317
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,803
I had no idea.

318
00:36:57,908 --> 00:36:59,482
That I have a sensitive side?

319
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,038
Don't let that fool you.

320
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:11,040
You have an extraordinary talent.

321
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,051
Oh, no please.

322
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:16,772
No, I am serious. I adore Chopin.

323
00:37:18,732 --> 00:37:20,181
He is my favorite.

324
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:23,203
So wonderfully tormented.

325
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,613
Well, torture is his appeal.

326
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,125
Is that a particular obsession?

327
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:41,786
Well... let's just say it has had its moments.

328
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:11,000
"She done you wrong"...

329
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:13,418
Excuse me?

330
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,878
"Tore out your heart"...,

331
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:22,986
"Shred it in pieces, with her own feelings faints"...,

332
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:36,473
"Drop it into nearest damp in
the rest of the broken heart...".

333
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,924
How descriptive! You must be a writer.

334
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:54,368
Yes, I can see it in your eyes... wild 
imagination, stormy monologues

335
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:59,996
And your eyes paint a baren landscape, darling.

336
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:04,102
With each brush wrapping around 
your heart.

337
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:16,411
Sorry. Sad music always affects me that way.

338
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,299
You know, whatever she did...

339
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:23,321
Fuck her.

340
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:27,928
Is that your answer for everything?

341
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:33,660
All I am saying is that 

342
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,767
no one is worth loosing your "joie 
de vivre" ,... Noel.

343
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:47,897
So... this way you "hang"?

344
00:39:48,835 --> 00:39:50,565
I never hang.

345
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:55,328
No, I suppose you don't.

346
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,519
What do you do?

347
00:40:03,145 --> 00:40:07,700
Oh, I don't think its a big mystery, Doc.
It is probably the same thing you do.

348
00:40:08,012 --> 00:40:09,722
I, somehow, doubt that.

349
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:12,546
Different tools, same game.

350
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:14,943
It isn't.

351
00:40:16,215 --> 00:40:16,934
Isn't it?

352
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:21,040
The attraction between men and women is clear.

353
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,469
And between women and women?

354
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:35,090
It can be... dangerously ... simply for ever.

355
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,448
Hello, ladies! Mind that we join you?

356
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:44,595
Come on, honey, seat down!

357
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:52,203
It is the swelling of the crotch.

358
00:40:54,788 --> 00:41:00,719
Well, we have a whole system to
size them up according our preferences.

359
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:03,960
Well tell us all about your system, Tara?

360
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,099
It is just a little scale: 1 to 10.
10 being the larges.

361
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:20,386
Take that lumberjack over there. He is 7.

362
00:41:20,386 --> 00:41:23,794
7?... He has got to be at least 9!

363
00:41:24,492 --> 00:41:27,233
Well, that depends on what you are used to.

364
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:33,737
Ok, Ok. Maybe 8. Of course, if it crucked
I would have to track it.

365
00:41:33,841 --> 00:41:35,800
And you can never tell.

366
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,270
That is the truth.

367
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,386
It may be very disappointing.

368
00:41:39,386 --> 00:41:44,368
Few months ago I went out with one I was sure 
to be 8, maybe 9.

369
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,547
He was this short, for 5!

370
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:57,093
Darling, why are you looking to the table?

371
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:00,356
All this girl talk make you unconfortable?

372
00:42:00,856 --> 00:42:03,816
Why should it?... I am a girl!

373
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:17,219
Oh, everyone... this is Brian Markquist, another
beach comer from New York.

374
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:17,771
Ladies.

375
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:20,221
- Hello, New York.
- Hello.

376
00:42:22,586 --> 00:42:26,505
You see Adrienne, there is more culture
around here than we thought.

377
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:27,402
Apparently...

378
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:30,841
What are you doing around here?

379
00:42:31,164 --> 00:42:34,051
Brian is ethical real estate broker,

380
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,251
for non profit land deals.

381
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:38,158
How about a round here?

382
00:42:39,221 --> 00:42:42,712
Southern .... comfort.

383
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:49,779
Brian, this is Dr Noel Benedict.

384
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:51,571
Ah... your roommate.

385
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:56,782
You write as well as practice medicine?

386
00:42:57,564 --> 00:43:01,775
Dr Benedict writes about all the
medicine she practices.

387
00:43:02,744 --> 00:43:04,849
- Noel is a psychiatrist.
- Oho

388
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:10,540
Well, it was really nice to meet you,
but I have to go back to work.

389
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,406
No, don't let me interrupt. I just stop
by to say hay.

390
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,377
No, I have to go.

391
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:20,566
I am sure you'll have no problem
coming back.

392
00:43:21,952 --> 00:43:22,567
Yes...

393
00:43:26,205 --> 00:43:27,403
No problem.

394
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,641
You hate men?

395
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,414
Not at all.

396
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:56,461
But, you couldn't wait to get out
of his presence.

397
00:43:59,265 --> 00:44:01,016
I just couldn't see any point staying.

398
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:08,270
What is it?

399
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:10,729
What?

400
00:44:12,803 --> 00:44:14,388
That makes you what you are?

401
00:44:18,275 --> 00:44:19,567
I am not exactly sure.

402
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,444
So, what's the theory, Doc ?

403
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:31,574
Depends on what makes you feel safeties, 
I suppose. Environment...

404
00:44:32,668 --> 00:44:34,868
History of abusive relationships with men. 

405
00:44:36,129 --> 00:44:38,046
Genetic which bears out more and more.

406
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:41,361
Non of which really matters.

407
00:44:43,341 --> 00:44:44,821
So, forget the speeches.

408
00:44:48,156 --> 00:44:49,240
What do you think?

409
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:52,033
Roll the dice.

410
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:15,630
When did you know?

411
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:20,257
Its little personal.

412
00:45:22,373 --> 00:45:24,082
I thought it was your job.

413
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:37,162
Ok. What do you want to know?

414
00:45:44,135 --> 00:45:45,323
How did it started?

415
00:45:53,588 --> 00:45:54,536
I was 27 years old.

416
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:59,497
She was ah... a patient.

417
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:08,669
There was something engagingly tragic 
about her.

418
00:46:11,077 --> 00:46:12,671
I felt instantly.

419
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:21,030
It is, after all, why I joined this profession.

420
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:27,429
So I may guiltlessly indulge my obsession
with tragedy.

421
00:46:27,742 --> 00:46:29,618
Compulsion to fix it.

422
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,236
I thought that it was the case, you know.

423
00:46:36,705 --> 00:46:38,404
She was so damn fascinating.

424
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,543
And I was hooked to her so utterly,

425
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:52,204
that I found myself rearranging my entire
life around that one appointment.

426
00:46:55,174 --> 00:46:58,196
Wednesdays, at 5 pm.

427
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:07,879
Than one wednesday

428
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:11,506
almost a half hour late,

429
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:14,330
she walks in,

430
00:47:17,259 --> 00:47:18,499
no aplogises.

431
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:28,473
She knew that I was waiting, and that
I would ... continue to wait.

432
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:32,371
It didn't matter.

433
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,177
She was apsolutely stunning.

434
00:47:40,053 --> 00:47:44,618
And I knew what she was going to say, 
she was leaving...

435
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:48,818
Leaving town... she was...

436
00:47:50,048 --> 00:47:51,028
... getting married.

437
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:59,157
She walked over to me, and said:

438
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:04,149
"It is better this way"

439
00:48:08,787 --> 00:48:10,194
Then she kissed me.

440
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:19,460
One kiss?

441
00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:24,035
One kiss...

442
00:48:28,048 --> 00:48:30,622
I didn't know a thing about myself
until that kiss.

443
00:48:32,936 --> 00:48:35,177
Didn't know what I want until that kiss.

444
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:40,440
I felt to be utterly arouse.

445
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,288
For I didn't understand any of it...

446
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:50,394
till that moment.

447
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,131
He used to beat my mother.

448
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,091
I hated her.

449
00:49:09,748 --> 00:49:11,301
I hated her ignorance.

450
00:49:14,563 --> 00:49:16,700
And I hated her for leting him 
do that to her.

451
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:22,067
Did he abuse you?

452
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,328
No.

453
00:49:26,184 --> 00:49:27,768
He was afraid of me.

454
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,113
Afraid?

455
00:49:33,063 --> 00:49:35,033
That is how I learned about my power,
you see.

456
00:49:35,554 --> 00:49:36,367
13 years.

457
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:43,079
At 13 years...

458
00:49:47,216 --> 00:49:48,467
I was pure instinct.

459
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:52,063
I didn't have a verb for that.

460
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:54,668
But I knew...

461
00:49:55,106 --> 00:49:57,639
as suerly as I was unique female...

462
00:49:57,649 --> 00:50:01,214
that men were compelled... 

463
00:50:01,902 --> 00:50:07,592
to battle people and things, in some primal
bleeding way.

464
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:17,869
But beside their brutal force, they were... lost,

465
00:50:18,734 --> 00:50:26,071
lonely, pathetic little creatures,

466
00:50:28,948 --> 00:50:31,720
forever extinguished from their mother's 
breasts.

467
00:50:41,027 --> 00:50:44,425
And when I knew that I don't hate the, 
but I pitty them.

468
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:47,531
I understood power. I knew it.

469
00:50:56,202 --> 00:50:58,099
And I let him know that I know it.

470
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:08,542
He never even laid a hand on me.

471
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:36,391
I think I drunk most of it, didn't I?

472
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:39,372
No. I had some. Maybe a glass.

473
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:44,385
You tell me what were you like in 
high school?

474
00:52:20,082 --> 00:52:23,469
I've never seen two people
more ill suited.

475
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:29,733
Maggie, you know that whenever you
get into this stuff it turn in one big drama.

476
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:31,515
So I got nothing better else to do.

477
00:52:35,465 --> 00:52:39,155
Why don't you go to living room, while
we get coffee and argue some more?

478
00:52:55,132 --> 00:52:56,498
Quite a pair.

479
00:52:57,873 --> 00:53:02,762
Yes... They have been partners for almost
20 years now.

480
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:06,482
How long have you know them?

481
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,088
Ever since I first started coming here.

482
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,818
5 years ago.

483
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:14,685
Maggie is a character.

484
00:53:16,602 --> 00:53:19,146
And teddy-bear, underneath that fire.

485
00:53:21,668 --> 00:53:24,232
And... what about you?

486
00:53:26,024 --> 00:53:27,150
Underneath that all?

487
00:53:32,163 --> 00:53:33,560
How is the probe?

488
00:53:37,135 --> 00:53:39,959
You know... the intimacy thing.

489
00:53:41,293 --> 00:53:44,805
Oh... well... ok, I suppose.

490
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,568
Oh, shit, girl. Don't sound so
enthusiastic.

491
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:53,956
I am just bored with it.

492
00:53:56,468 --> 00:54:00,648
It is kind hard to write about 
something you are not experiencing, isn't it?

493
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:04,473
I am sure that Noel's senses and recalls  
are just fine.

494
00:54:05,181 --> 00:54:06,474
So... come on...

495
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,330
Oh, don't be so god damn mysterious.

496
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:15,072
That is just it, there is no mystery.

497
00:54:15,812 --> 00:54:20,690
A relationship of communication 
to intimacy is simply being overlooked.

498
00:54:21,774 --> 00:54:24,973
Most of us are so vulnerable
and filled with neurosis,

499
00:54:25,192 --> 00:54:27,829
that we are not really equiped to
truly comunicate.

500
00:54:28,423 --> 00:54:31,779
No problem. We simply match neurosis.

501
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,250
Equal in all things.

502
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:38,710
Equality has nothing to do with intimacy.

503
00:54:39,794 --> 00:54:42,619
In fact, intimacy would be far easier 

504
00:54:42,629 --> 00:54:44,901
if we would understand honesty of inequality.

505
00:54:45,818 --> 00:54:47,673
- So now eqality doesn't exist?
- Let's just be honest and except it.

506
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:54,385
You like to do this to me, and I
like it done.

507
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,981
Ok, Doctor.

508
00:54:58,534 --> 00:55:04,203
Than what particular Petri dish creates
this elusive state of intimacy?

509
00:55:06,913 --> 00:55:07,851
Halula. Tango.

510
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,314
Quite often the most direct road.

511
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:20,400
So, intimacy is only possible
during the sexual act?

512
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,495
That is exactly what I am not saying.

513
00:55:24,475 --> 00:55:27,539
Men are probably more dishonest during
sex than in any other time.

514
00:55:27,966 --> 00:55:34,105
We all are searching ... with this 
insatiable hunger to be intimate.

515
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:42,339
Truly intimate. But you have to see how 
far we want to go to achieve it.

516
00:55:43,475 --> 00:55:45,049
What a dready prognosis.

517
00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:50,489
So, how do we find it?

518
00:55:51,344 --> 00:55:55,263
Different ways. Some of us get it
from our friends. 

519
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,556
Rare few get it from our lovers.

520
00:55:59,682 --> 00:56:01,516
Others fuck strangers.

521
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:09,166
If we open ourselves to someone, 
we run a risk of being judged.

522
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:13,616
We have to justify what erotizes us.

523
00:56:14,482 --> 00:56:17,838
And what if we want somethnig from 
our partner that disgust them?

524
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:19,453
And what if it doesn't?

525
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:25,425
Don't you think it is possible to find
accord of minds during the act of sex ?

526
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:29,073
Great sex does not equal intimacy.

527
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:32,919
So you say that men and women can't achieve
intimacy.

528
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:37,036
It can be imitated, it can be simulated.

529
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:40,506
But men and women will never speak same language.

530
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:44,967
And so, men and women can never achieve
true intimacy.

531
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:48,563
So that rare achievement is reserved only 
for dykes?

532
00:56:50,439 --> 00:56:53,138
That would be the logical conclusion.

533
00:56:54,681 --> 00:56:57,797
Pearhaps it comes back down to our language
problem...

534
00:56:57,797 --> 00:57:01,320
Excuse me, Doctor, but I think that
your rhetoric sucks.

535
00:57:33,285 --> 00:57:34,338
I am sorry.

536
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:36,954
About last night.

537
00:57:40,477 --> 00:57:42,259
None of it was directed to you.

538
00:57:42,259 --> 00:57:42,947
Wasn't it?

539
00:57:43,885 --> 00:57:45,313
It is not a lesbian issue.

540
00:57:45,313 --> 00:57:47,022
Well, it seemed you reffer it 
as one...

541
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:49,576
It is issue of communication.

542
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:56,642
When you think of two women making love, 
you imagine some pretty wild sex.

543
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,718
Truth is that they feel just as exposed
and vurnelable.

544
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:06,314
Anyway, I just wanted to apologise.

545
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:12,098
I thought I might buy you a dring
in that place that you are so fond of.

546
00:58:28,316 --> 00:58:30,629
I read your book.

547
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:43,855
Very enlightening. Not my cup of tea,
but it is rather fascinating.

548
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:47,472
Tell me something.

549
00:58:49,546 --> 00:58:55,132
This Butch/femme thing. It sounds
simulated to me.

550
00:58:55,664 --> 00:58:57,759
You are reffering to male role playing.

551
00:58:59,228 --> 00:59:03,251
In some cases it is. But it has one critical
distinction.

552
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:08,056
In our world butches like to give pleasure, 
not to take it.

553
00:59:20,626 --> 00:59:22,585
I find so easy to drink here.

554
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:24,909
Bars do have that effect.

555
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,662
No, I mean here... at the beach.

556
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:55,634
So, what are you working on?

557
00:59:56,989 --> 00:59:58,813
This is leading to a pep-talk.

558
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:02,482
No... Come on... What is it?

559
01:00:02,492 --> 01:00:03,347
It is work in progress.

560
01:00:05,015 --> 01:00:06,151

561
01:00:06,776 --> 01:00:09,861
More views on contemporary dysfunction.

562
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:12,613
Not quite...

563
01:00:15,447 --> 01:00:17,000
It is...

564
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:18,908
a novel.

565
01:00:23,598 --> 01:00:25,724
What is this novel about?

566
01:00:25,724 --> 01:00:26,651
Sex!

567
01:00:28,809 --> 01:00:30,768
A sizzling sexual pad?

568
01:00:31,988 --> 01:00:36,845
Sure. Some Tara O'Hara sanitized sex.

569
01:00:38,585 --> 01:00:40,638
I hardly think that is your métier.

570
01:00:40,743 --> 01:00:41,576
What is?

571
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:52,864
Oh, I would say very rough, raw, down
and dirty sort of sex.

572
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:55,824
Well, as a therapyst,

573
01:00:56,616 --> 01:01:07,664
I suppose that you have exact definition 
of rough, raw, down and dirty sort of sex.

574
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,259
Yes, it's called fucking.

575
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:15,585
Ouch, that sounds like a nasty habit.

576
01:01:26,685 --> 01:01:29,280
Lesbians do fuck, don't they?

577
01:01:33,709 --> 01:01:37,659
Tell me, how do they exactly
without proper apparatus?

578
01:01:39,546 --> 01:01:43,152
It doesn't take great deal of 
imagination to figure that one out.

579
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:48,561
I've been wondering... If they are so
well adjusted.

580
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,063
Why are they so attached to their dildos?

581
01:01:53,262 --> 01:01:55,826
Dildos have nothing to do with penises.

582
01:01:57,066 --> 01:01:58,504
It is about penetration.

583
01:01:58,504 --> 01:02:00,359
It feels good.

584
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:05,320
Sex is sex.

585
01:02:08,322 --> 01:02:12,835
Maybe for you, but sex between women
is as raw as it gets.

586
01:02:16,754 --> 01:02:17,692
What are you doing?

587
01:02:19,807 --> 01:02:21,246
Answering your questions.

588
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,998
This is not about me.

589
01:02:25,415 --> 01:02:26,457
- Isn't it?
- No.

590
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:31,262
Than why such potent curiosity?

591
01:02:35,045 --> 01:02:37,369
Merely... academic.

592
01:02:39,662 --> 01:02:40,392
Merely.

593
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:43,977
What are you afraid of Claire?

594
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:53,281
It is a gift of light.

595
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:54,167
It's a shame.

596
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:55,730
Exactly.

597
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:56,939
How can you say that?

598
01:06:56,939 --> 01:07:01,171
No, you allow that your intellect
betray your hearts.

599
01:07:02,838 --> 01:07:05,621
Romance is a gift of feeling.

600
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:10,155
And no matter how you get there 
it's divine intervention.

601
01:07:10,832 --> 01:07:13,219
The pure radiance of it.

602
01:07:14,146 --> 01:07:15,741
It is a matter of semantiques.

603
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,473
It is a matter of camouflage.

604
01:07:22,067 --> 01:07:28,279
I wouldn't think that pragamtic of
your orientation would think any different.

605
01:07:28,488 --> 01:07:33,470
You think that there is no "to die for"
lesbian romantics?

606
01:07:34,752 --> 01:07:36,648
You the worst kind.

607
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:41,213
We used to have one pine, 
and we got two.

608
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:44,590
Romance the second power.

609
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:50,448
You... always do this. You have to
tire apart everything.

610
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,804
It's the only way to get there, darling.

611
01:07:55,179 --> 01:07:58,181
We are still being culturated as
women who lounge to bond,

612
01:07:58,181 --> 01:08:01,422
mate, regardless of our sex orientation.

613
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:04,799
But straight women are better 
in boundaries.

614
01:08:05,404 --> 01:08:10,646
You are right. But it is not matter of choices.
The boundaries are imposed.

615
01:08:10,959 --> 01:08:14,096
Which is what makes them so f....
uptight and rigid.

616
01:08:14,305 --> 01:08:16,358
I am certanly not!

617
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:21,361
I wouldn't have write kind of novels I do
if I was uptight and rigid.

618
01:08:22,601 --> 01:08:23,893
Then come here, darling.

619
01:08:24,612 --> 01:08:25,290
What?

620
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,926
Come here.

621
01:08:32,731 --> 01:08:33,450
Now, you. Come.

622
01:08:38,954 --> 01:08:43,591
Two of you are sorority sister who
knew each other 5 years ago.

623
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:47,729
You have just run to each other 
at Kennedy Airport.

624
01:08:49,105 --> 01:08:53,816
You look at one another. It takes 1 minute
to remember.

625
01:08:55,171 --> 01:08:56,536
But then you remember.

626
01:08:57,234 --> 01:09:06,677
This is the woman who stayed up all night
when you has your first big hangover.

627
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,316
You look one another, and than you hug.

628
01:09:15,036 --> 01:09:16,307
So hug.

629
01:09:22,915 --> 01:09:26,688
You are best friends. For God's sake.

630
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,944
Let's give them a hand, folks.

631
01:09:37,652 --> 01:09:43,093
1 point of 5 on hug meter.
Skin contact 20%.

632
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:47,502
Scenario 2.

633
01:09:50,493 --> 01:09:51,608
BJ and I.

634
01:09:53,682 --> 01:09:57,580
We are two lesbians who just met at the
parking lot.

635
01:09:59,216 --> 01:10:04,792
We've spent entire evening discussing
Martina'a outer brilliance 

636
01:10:05,532 --> 01:10:07,804
and wondered if she would have
won Wimbledon for the 10th time

637
01:10:07,815 --> 01:10:10,702
if Judy's wasn't so premeditated. 

638
01:10:13,214 --> 01:10:16,632
And now it is time to bid at you.

639
01:10:30,963 --> 01:10:34,746
This, ladies, is hugess completess.

640
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:38,603
Note the full body contact.

641
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:41,729
Position of our legs.

642
01:10:43,314 --> 01:10:45,950
We feel one another.

643
01:10:48,212 --> 01:10:50,119
Softness

644
01:10:51,693 --> 01:10:52,840
The warmth.

645
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:57,436
And they just met at the
park lot?

646
01:10:59,718 --> 01:11:03,470
And now I want to know... straight women
as so open and unhibited, 

647
01:11:03,971 --> 01:11:09,130
Why the hug as opposite end of a magnet?

648
01:11:09,338 --> 01:11:14,518
You made your point. Can we go back
to the original issue?

649
01:11:14,935 --> 01:11:17,457
Yes. Please.

650
01:11:17,457 --> 01:11:18,395
What?

651
01:11:19,062 --> 01:11:22,418
Semantiques of romance in literature?

652
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:29,016
Or that throbbing bullshit you write
to alienate women from themselves.

653
01:11:30,725 --> 01:11:34,206
No, I fall on the 1st amandman.

654
01:11:34,884 --> 01:11:38,021
Seems, lesbians love to attack my work.

655
01:11:39,053 --> 01:11:41,544
I think that it is just fascinating.

656
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,649
I am sure you do, darling.

657
01:11:45,296 --> 01:11:48,485
It will probably end up on one
of your door stops.

658
01:11:48,818 --> 01:11:51,424
Only in reverse.

659
01:11:51,434 --> 01:11:56,791
Where the straight heroine would
convert poor confused dyke

660
01:11:57,281 --> 01:12:02,086
who has been following said heroine
on a cross-country tour

661
01:12:02,086 --> 01:12:06,818
with some muscle idiot pirate
named Blake Swashbuckle.

662
01:12:08,141 --> 01:12:12,456
There is nothing wrong in 
women loose dull of their

663
01:12:12,456 --> 01:12:16,771
unfulfilled lifes for couple of hours
with one of my books.

664
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,419
Nothing, except themselves.

665
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,722
We don't want to loose our sense 
of humor, do we?

666
01:12:25,005 --> 01:12:29,612
Fantasy is healthy. Right Doc?

667
01:12:30,289 --> 01:12:32,061
As long as we know where to draw the line.

668
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:38,002
That is right, draw the line.

669
01:12:39,763 --> 01:12:41,316
But cleaning up,

670
01:12:42,264 --> 01:12:44,599
never changes the way it was, darling.

671
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:57,419
It never has, it never will!
If you eat pussy, you eat pussy!

672
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:11,895
Do you think it's true?

673
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:14,991
What?

674
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:15,856
What she said.

675
01:13:16,544 --> 01:13:17,179
About?

676
01:13:19,014 --> 01:13:21,150
About the way that straight women hug.

677
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,403
Maybe an over generalisation.

678
01:13:34,032 --> 01:13:35,679
I think it is true.

679
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:13,952
I just came to get some aspirine.

680
01:15:15,818 --> 01:15:16,662
Headache?

681
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,694
Aha, impossible.

682
01:15:18,694 --> 01:15:21,383
Well, here, sit down.

683
01:15:24,593 --> 01:15:25,531
Go ahead.

684
01:16:08,044 --> 01:16:08,961
Relax.

685
01:16:29,577 --> 01:16:30,557
Better?

686
01:16:31,891 --> 01:16:33,590
Yes... Much.

687
01:16:38,686 --> 01:16:39,489
Thank you.

688
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:41,198
I am bored.

689
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:45,784
Yeah, I am like that myself.

690
01:16:54,955 --> 01:16:55,873
Got any ideas?

691
01:17:07,233 --> 01:17:09,453
2 and 2.

692
01:17:09,453 --> 01:17:11,152
How about 3 for 5.

693
01:17:14,081 --> 01:17:16,332
This time let's make it more
interesting.

694
01:17:17,728 --> 01:17:19,156
What do you have in mind?

695
01:17:20,021 --> 01:17:22,419
How about a frendly weigher?

696
01:17:24,826 --> 01:17:28,891
The winner gets a shot of Tequilla

697
01:17:30,152 --> 01:17:32,153
and a loser

698
01:17:32,163 --> 01:17:34,321
has to part 

699
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:38,334
with a fantasy.

700
01:17:40,105 --> 01:17:41,314
You are on?

701
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:04,212
So much for the winner.

702
01:18:06,693 --> 01:18:08,069
Come on.

703
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:09,726
Out with it.

704
01:18:10,726 --> 01:18:13,749
And not some housewife masturbation
fantasy, either.

705
01:18:16,219 --> 01:18:19,721
Ok... It is in the bar.

706
01:18:19,721 --> 01:18:22,504
Dark, smokey, sweaty.

707
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:26,881
After a day of intense heat.

708
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:32,582
Kind of day when a earth explodes
when you step on it in the deepest summer.

709
01:18:34,802 --> 01:18:37,554
At the end of a dancing night.

710
01:20:21,329 --> 01:20:25,071
You are the winner why, the hell, 
am I so drunk.

711
01:20:35,389 --> 01:20:36,921
Your turn.

712
01:20:56,536 --> 01:21:00,393
It is a restaurant or public place.

713
01:21:03,842 --> 01:21:05,041
Starts with the eyes.

714
01:21:07,907 --> 01:21:09,439
Always the eyes.

715
01:22:44,523 --> 01:22:48,827
Well, at least we have one thing in
common.

716
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:57,999
Anonymity.

717
01:23:17,478 --> 01:23:19,375
Are you going to Maggie's party?

718
01:23:19,375 --> 01:23:20,251
- No.
- No?

719
01:23:22,023 --> 01:23:25,285
It's friday night. I don't want to
miss any excitement of Humpwhale Inn.

720
01:23:26,421 --> 01:23:29,443
No. That would be such a tragedy.

721
01:23:39,772 --> 01:23:41,367
Her husband left her.

722
01:23:41,794 --> 01:23:44,587
It seems that after few weeks of
taking care of kinds

723
01:23:44,587 --> 01:23:48,151
he found himself feeling
suffocated.

724
01:23:48,151 --> 01:23:49,590
Jesus Christ!

725
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:51,789
Drink it!

726
01:24:40,107 --> 01:24:42,671
Men are shit.

727
01:24:44,224 --> 01:24:50,863
That is right, darling. You just 
speak out whatever comes to your mind.

728
01:24:50,863 --> 01:24:51,937
Not all men!

729
01:24:52,145 --> 01:24:53,333
Aren't they?

730
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:57,742
It may seem tough right now.
But there are many ways to heal.

731
01:24:58,117 --> 01:25:03,558
The prayers... crystals.
I could re-calibrate your heart chakra.

732
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:05,517
Sounds like realignment.

733
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,122
Well, it is in a way.

734
01:25:08,446 --> 01:25:10,395
But it will start the process sooner.

735
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:15,012
Rebearthing might be a good idea, too.

736
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,148
When you are next time around...

737
01:25:17,148 --> 01:25:19,347
There be no next time around.

738
01:25:20,463 --> 01:25:21,620
Sure there will.

739
01:25:23,402 --> 01:25:25,226
Come on, let's dance.

740
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:29,457
Go on, honey, it will do you good.

741
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,623
Come on, Noel, dance with me.

742
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,418
- No. I don't want to.
- Oh, come on.

743
01:25:53,418 --> 01:25:58,035
Strip down that cool professional 
attitude and get down girl.

744
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:35,726
Fuck you you fucking son
of a bitch!!!

745
01:29:14,466 --> 01:29:16,186
Strike out?

746
01:29:17,145 --> 01:29:19,031
Not exactly.

747
01:29:20,532 --> 01:29:25,076
But reality... such a poor substitution.

748
01:29:26,702 --> 01:29:28,453
Did you get what you were
looking for?

749
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:31,653
No. No, I didn't.

750
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:37,896
Do you even know what you want?

751
01:29:47,474 --> 01:29:50,059
Maybe you can help me figure
that out ... Doc.

752
01:29:51,789 --> 01:29:53,759
I never mess with straight women.

753
01:29:53,759 --> 01:29:54,186
No?

754
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,729
Why not?

755
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,335
It takes to many straight priviledges.

756
01:30:04,796 --> 01:30:09,580
What if... they are just following their
destiny?

757
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:15,542
Destiny? I think you are confusing that 
with fleeting interest.

758
01:30:17,741 --> 01:30:22,285
What about your... Oh, what was that
exotic supposition?

759
01:30:23,755 --> 01:30:27,079
Ah yes, a vampire theory.

760
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:28,601
In one of your books.

761
01:30:28,601 --> 01:30:31,603
It's not my theory, it's allegory.

762
01:30:31,603 --> 01:30:34,490
Whatever... It does have merit.

763
01:30:34,917 --> 01:30:35,678
Who for?

764
01:30:36,595 --> 01:30:38,190
Oh, I think that...

765
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:41,337
converting someone it can be the highest
seduction.

766
01:30:42,682 --> 01:30:47,080
You pierce the skin, you suck 
the passion from them...

767
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,228
And you leave them wanting.

768
01:30:53,761 --> 01:30:54,501
Forever.

769
01:30:58,597 --> 01:31:00,733
Until it becomes uncomfortable.

770
01:31:05,152 --> 01:31:07,122
And the husband finds out.

771
01:31:08,248 --> 01:31:10,051
Opening doors can be very exciting.

772
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:11,896
But not for me.

773
01:31:12,907 --> 01:31:17,013
Beside, I never get involved with 
women who tried both sides of the fence.

774
01:31:21,099 --> 01:31:24,402
Sounds that you never get involved, 
at all.

775
01:31:25,226 --> 01:31:27,477
You mean fucking for a quick
thrill.

776
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,447
That myth has been destroyed.

777
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:36,722
You think that if you just talk about, 
that it will happen, don't you Noel?

778
01:31:37,837 --> 01:31:41,672
If you just reind your little 
hypothesis amd theorems tight enough,

779
01:31:41,672 --> 01:31:44,111
distill them into final intellectual
analyses...

780
01:31:44,111 --> 01:31:45,956
and it will... boom... 
it will just happen.

781
01:31:49,229 --> 01:31:50,938
Like sponataneous combustion.

782
01:31:53,835 --> 01:31:59,411
It takes heat for that, Noel. Heat.

783
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,324
You can't look me in the eyes, can you?

784
01:32:15,201 --> 01:32:16,910
You are afraid of me.

785
01:32:20,433 --> 01:32:21,736
Claire...

786
01:32:24,019 --> 01:32:25,738
Don't flatter yourself.

787
01:33:56,569 --> 01:33:57,612
Shit.

788
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:38,593
Just more tourment.

789
01:34:39,249 --> 01:34:40,708
It is more than that.

790
01:34:41,657 --> 01:34:42,980
You play...

791
01:34:43,647 --> 01:34:44,471
To you.

792
01:34:47,108 --> 01:34:49,390
My dear prof. Lindfield used to
bellow.

793
01:34:50,203 --> 01:34:54,581
You must connect with the keys Claire. 
Make the music you.

794
01:34:54,935 --> 01:34:58,968
The notes are your blood.
A music is your heart.

795
01:35:27,922 --> 01:35:29,193
What is that?

796
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,519
It is not finished.

797
01:35:35,707 --> 01:35:36,604
Yours?

798
01:35:40,731 --> 01:35:43,524
Well, actually it's...

799
01:35:45,327 --> 01:35:46,661
It's yours.

800
01:35:51,633 --> 01:35:56,979
I called it "Mystery of Noel"

801
01:36:03,598 --> 01:36:05,515
How about Claire's mystery?

802
01:36:06,558 --> 01:36:10,112
Is that a shrink thing always answering
question with question or

803
01:36:10,112 --> 01:36:12,061
is that just an annoying habit?

804
01:36:21,649 --> 01:36:23,348
- You know "Clair de lune"?
- Moonlight.

805
01:36:28,497 --> 01:36:30,342
It is an appropriate theme...

806
01:36:37,596 --> 01:36:39,430
Claire reaching for the moon.

807
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:43,297
Play it.

808
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:03,641
Who is affraid now?

809
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:14,641
Title by *** THaLia ***
