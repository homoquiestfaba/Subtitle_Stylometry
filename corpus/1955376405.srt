00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,032
[screams]

2
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,138
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

3
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,952
[squeaking]

4
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,669
lt's over, Sarah.
lt's finally over.

5
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,465
[music]

6
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,803
A cab. Come on.

7
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,139
Taxi!

8
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:45,938
31 5 Rosebud.

9
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:00,452
[music]

10
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,629
So, uh, pretty big
blaze back there.

11
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,923
Really? We hadn't noticed.

12
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,598
What are we going to do, Mark?

13
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,934
We're just gonna pretend
like nothing happened.

14
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,979
Go home, go to sleep,
get up, and go to class.

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,356
But what if one of those
creatures got out?

16
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,900
How? We burned that place
down to the ground.

17
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,111
Nothing could have escaped
that inferno.

18
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,863
l just hope you're right.

19
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,156
We're here.

20
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,344
Try and get some sleep.

21
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,470
We'll talk about things
in the morning.

22
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,556
Okay.

23
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,536
[TV noise]

24
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,579
[creaking]

25
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,876
Well, well, well,
if it ain't Cinderella.

26
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,669
l can explain, Stepfather. l--

27
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,921
Shut up!

28
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,054
You know what your mother
said to me before she died?

29
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,722
- No, sir.
- She said--

30
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,350
[high-pitched voice]
"Take care of my precious daughter."

31
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,852
[regular voice]
Precious-frickin' daughter!

32
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,479
lt's 3 o-friggin' clock
in the morning.

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,107
- You don't understand.
- Oh, l understand.

34
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:54,983
You've been out
hanging around

35
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:59,238
with that bunch of frat-brat
college idiots again.

36
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,490
Shit! Look at that dress!

37
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,616
That was your mother's favorite!

38
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,582
Go and get cleaned up
and go to bed.

39
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,510
[music]

40
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,624
[sighs]
l told you to go to bed.

41
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,209
l don't want to see your face
till morning.

42
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,795
l'll deal with you then.
Now get out of here.

43
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,300
You're pushing it, Sarah.

44
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,467
Now you better get out of here.
l'm warning you.

45
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,220
Uhh!

46
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,596
[choking]

47
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:16,606
Sarah!

48
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,655
Let go of him!

49
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,870
[gasping]

50
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,591
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah--

51
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,925
Aah!

52
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,860
[rumbling]

53
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,405
Aah!

54
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,619
[crying]

55
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,666
Mark, you said it was over!

56
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,668
You said it was over!

57
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,137
MAN: l'm afraid the facts
speak for themselves,

58
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,638
good people of the jury.

59
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,268
This girl's loving, caring stepfather--

60
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,687
a man, l might add,
who one neighbor described

61
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,022
as a "kind, generous person"--

62
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,775
l told her not to use
the hand story.

63
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,403
We could have built
a great manslaughter case.

64
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,738
MAN: ...when this vicious,
cold-blooded,

65
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,867
shameless act took place!

66
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,161
And what is her only defense?

67
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,705
Ladies and gentlemen,

68
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,374
empty excuses.

69
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,295
And she blames it...

70
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,338
on a hand.

71
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,968
A hand that the accused claims

72
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,471
followed her home
from a wax museum

73
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,847
which she admittedly was at

74
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,852
when it very mysteriously

75
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,104
burned to the ground...

76
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,109
- killing--
- Objection, your honor!

77
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,197
My learned colleague
has forgotten the case yet again.

78
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,574
Does the burning down
of the wax museum

79
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,576
have any bearing whatsoever

80
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,913
on whether the accused killed
her stepfather or not?

81
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:22,626
Your Honor, the latest body count
at the Waxworks is 200.

82
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,295
200 people.

83
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:30,509
200 human lives.

84
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,178
And l think that if this defendant,

85
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,931
the accused,

86
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,933
is in any way involved--

87
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:38,975
Objection!

88
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,269
Objection sustained.

89
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,231
Please delete that last remark
from the record.

90
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,650
Sarah didn't kill anyone,
you idiots!

91
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,695
lt was the waxworks themselves!

92
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,906
- They came alive!
- Order!

93
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,199
l saw it!

94
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,535
Let go of me!
She's telling the truth!

95
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,579
Do you understand me?
She's telling the truth!

96
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,331
Just leave her alone!

97
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,084
She didn't do anything,
l tell you!

98
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,001
Come on! Let go!

99
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,993
Silly question,
but how do you feel?

100
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,080
Look, Sarah, it's gonna work out.

101
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:43,999
lt's got to.

102
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,923
Cabbie,
64 Wargrave Road, please.

103
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,757
Thanks.

104
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,136
Where?

105
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,846
Sir Wilfred's.

106
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,724
This is the only room
we haven't checked.

107
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,060
What are we supposed
to be looking for?

108
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,733
l don't know. He just told me to come
here if there was ever any trouble.

109
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,069
Good afternoon, Mark.

110
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,904
- Afternoon, Sarah.
- Sir Wilfred?

111
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,364
Hope you're both doing well.

112
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,199
Put it this way,
if you're watching this,

113
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,035
you're a darn sight
better off than l am,

114
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,703
'cause l must be dead.

115
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,622
Help yourself.

116
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,499
l'm sure l'm not allowed
to touch this stuff where l am.

117
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:31,421
Always fancied
a pair of wings, though.

118
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,840
Won't have to travel around
in this damn thing.

119
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,178
Hopefully, we did
destroy the Waxwork

120
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,221
and killed all those creatures

121
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,057
ending our Mr. Lincoln's chance

122
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,267
of letting all that evil loose
on the world, right?

123
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,394
Well, sort of.

124
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,813
lf you two are here,

125
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,733
it probably means that
something has gone wrong,

126
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,653
in which case you're going to
need all the help you can get

127
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,655
if you want to continue
the fight against evil.

128
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,491
You may not know it yet, Mark,

129
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,909
but l have left all this to you.

130
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,870
- You did?
- Yes.

131
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,330
Most importantly,

132
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,998
you have inherited
your grandfather's

133
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,834
and my secret collection
of strange artifacts

134
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,337
which we have collected
in our many adventures

135
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,297
through the supernatural.

136
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,592
There may be something there
that will help you in your quest.

137
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,219
Adios and good luck.

138
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,180
Wait! Aren't we supposed to--

139
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,058
Ooh. Nearly forgot.

140
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,310
How to get through
the secret chamber?

141
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,189
Just followAlice through
the looking glass.

142
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,065
Ta-ta for now.

143
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:50,917
Alice?

144
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,420
Who the hell is Alice?

145
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,547
Through The Looking Glass

146
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,882
is the second
Alice ln Wonderland book.

147
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,843
the one where she travels
to another world

148
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,885
through a mirror.

149
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,137
A mirror.

150
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,986
l don't see anything.

151
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,427
[rumbling]

152
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,215
Van Helsing?

153
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,350
[muffled scream]
[squeaking]

154
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,605
Hey, Sarah, look at this.

155
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,609
What is it?

156
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,362
lt's a Cartagrian time door opener.

157
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,697
Cartagrian?

158
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,573
l don't know what it means.

159
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,284
lt must be some medieval expression
or something.

160
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,579
lt says it was used by angels,
both light and dark,

161
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,247
to travel through time.

162
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,040
So?

163
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,669
So maybe if we went down
to the remains of the Waxwork,

164
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,380
we could use this to open one
of Mr. Lincoln's time doors.

165
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,381
You're joking.

166
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,341
Why not? We've been
in and out of time before.

167
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,510
- But, Mark--
- Listen, Sarah,

168
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,512
if we don't find some evidence
to support your story,

169
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,723
one of two things is gonna happen.

170
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,224
You're gonna rot in jail,

171
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,226
or they're gonna give you
the electric chair.

172
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,187
l'm sorry.

173
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,064
l'm sorry,
but that's the way it is.

174
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,025
We gotta do something
about this.

175
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,943
But remember what happened
the last time.

176
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,653
Forget the last time.

177
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,487
This is gonna be different.

178
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,281
How do you open this thing?

179
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,581
[click]

180
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,875
Wow. Look at that.

181
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,846
[music]

182
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,476
Look! lt even worked here!

183
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,147
Come on!

184
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,149
No, Mark! lt's not
the same kind of time door

185
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,233
as in the last one!

186
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,195
lt's probably because
it's in a different location.

187
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,780
Mark, promise me
we're not running!

188
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,948
What have we got to lose?

189
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,825
- Mark, l don't want to run!
- Come on!

190
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,888
Mark! Mark!

191
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,390
Sarah!

192
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,476
[squeaking]

193
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,436
Aah!

194
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,985
[squeaking]

195
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,279
MAN: Catch the ball, son.

196
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,658
There you go.

197
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,161
That's it. Come on.

198
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,497
Hi!

199
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,916
Come on. lt's time
to come home to Mommy.

200
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,545
Come on home, hon.

201
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,214
Come on, honey.

202
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,091
Come on.

203
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,802
lt's time to come home
to Mommy. Please?

204
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,846
[loud thud]

205
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,642
lt's time to come home, Mark.

206
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,696
We did it, Sarah.

207
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,322
We did it!

208
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,160
Sarah?
[pounding]

209
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,123
[thunder]

210
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,928
[doors creak]

211
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,389
Baron Von Frankenstein?

212
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,641
Well, l--

213
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,894
Yes?

214
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,854
l am Victor Frankenstein.

215
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,522
[thunder]

216
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,902
And how may l help you, sir?

217
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,113
l'm Herr Vogel,
Burgomeister of lngolstadt.

218
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,365
Pleasure to meet you,
Herr Vogel.

219
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,575
Now please,

220
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,869
it is far too late an hour
for a social visit.

221
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,496
Do state your business.

222
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,664
All right, Baron, l will.

223
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,583
There have been rumors
in the village

224
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,543
that there's something--

225
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,920
Ooh.

226
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,343
Elizabeth, please,

227
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,886
go back to your chamber.

228
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,098
Don't be too long, my darling.

229
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,932
Sarah?

230
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,854
Herr Vogel was just leaving.

231
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,272
lsn't that right, Herr Vogel?

232
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,154
[doors creak]

233
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,326
lt's all right, Henry.

234
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,620
Go with Felix.

235
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,705
Felix?

236
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,290
[growls]

237
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,667
[thunder]

238
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,257
Let go!

239
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,932
l saw the way you looked
at the baroness.

240
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,559
- Don't think the baron doesn't know.
- Let go!

241
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,270
Let go!

242
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,856
Feed him and clean his hay.

243
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,608
[growling]

244
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,946
You know how the baron
hates the smell.

245
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,739
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

246
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,088
[growls]

247
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,052
Excuse me?

248
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,977
[growls]

249
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,604
Oh, you're hungry.

250
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,648
You're hungry.
Uhh...

251
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,359
Okay, Uh, l'm gonna
find you something.

252
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,445
Stay calm.
l'm gonna get you something.

253
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,161
[growls]

254
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,787
What the hell am l gonna
feed him at this hour?

255
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,667
Hey, l know. l know.

256
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,544
We could send out for a pizza.

257
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,880
- [growls]
- Oh! Okay! Okay!

258
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,132
Okay. Okay.
Uh...

259
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,508
l'm gonna--
l'm gonna find you something.

260
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,844
[growls]

261
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,180
ls that what he feeds you?

262
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,060
Slop coming up.

263
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,729
Augh!

264
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,400
[growls]

265
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,736
l--l can't feed you that.
lt's disgusting.

266
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:51,624
Okay.

267
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,167
This should be better.

268
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,670
Frankenstein's notebook.

269
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:17,525
[growls]

270
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,286
[thunder]

271
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,583
[Felix laughs]

272
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,920
FELlX: He has much trouble
running the village.

273
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,089
Why is he the Burgomeister?

274
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,049
He can't even control
a few peasants!

275
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,332
Wake up.

276
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,709
Sarah.

277
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,211
- [muffled scream]
- Shh! No! No, no, no.

278
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,505
lt's okay.
lt's okay. lt's me.

279
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,382
lt's okay. lt's okay.

280
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,093
Henry, what are you doing here?

281
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,720
lf the baron finds us--

282
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,805
Sarah, don't do this to me.

283
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,182
lt's me, Mark, remember?

284
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,769
Remember the Waxwork?
The court case?

285
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,395
Look, you've been affected
by the time leap.

286
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,438
But you must be strong.

287
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,945
Mark.

288
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,406
What happened?

289
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,408
Where are we?

290
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,619
You believed in all of this.

291
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,536
lt possessed your mind.

292
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,164
Come on, let's get back
to the 20th century.

293
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,665
But the evidence.

294
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,251
Frankenstein's notebook.

295
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,754
A step-by-step guide
on how to reanimate dead flesh--

296
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,005
And you should see
what's in his cellar.

297
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,715
You're serious.

298
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,509
Think about it.

299
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,302
lf we can reanimate dead flesh,

300
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,221
then the prosecution's case
is out the window.

301
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,641
But if you don't
like the book idea,

302
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,683
we can always try
and take the monster.

303
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,770
Now come on.

304
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,833
The hallway is the first place
l remember appearing.

305
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,459
There should be
a time door down there.

306
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,298
All l can remember
is a falling sensation.

307
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,677
You don't think maybe
we should have

308
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,137
prepared all this
a little more, do you?

309
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,596
Don't worry. lt's gonna
turn out fine.

310
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,808
Shh.

311
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,520
The time door must be
around here somewhere.

312
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,647
[pounding]
[crowd yelling]

313
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,067
Elizabeth?

314
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,655
But, Victor--

315
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,491
You slut!

316
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,996
With Henry Clevell,
my best friend!

317
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,497
Have you no shame?

318
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,749
Maybe if you spent
more time with me

319
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,210
instead of that 8-foot slab
of brain-damaged flesh,

320
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,755
l would not have to seek pleasures
elsewhere, would l?

321
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,049
But with him?

322
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,719
Nowjust a second here!

323
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,892
l warned you, Baron.

324
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,020
Now we must ask that you turn over
the monster peacefully,

325
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,105
or we must take him by force.

326
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,273
Never!

327
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,610
After him!

328
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,161
Open the door, you idiot!

329
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,211
Felix!
Unchain the monster!

330
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:10,925
Sarah!

331
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,057
Sarah, don't let us down.

332
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,683
Remember who you really are.

333
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,814
Elizabeth--

334
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,566
Don't Elizabeth me.

335
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,242
Sarah, there's
a time door over--

336
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,744
[growls]

337
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,625
Mark, look out!
Behind you!

338
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,335
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

339
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,337
Don't worry.

340
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,838
Remember, Sarah?

341
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,507
Back in the Waxwork?

342
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,176
lf you don't believe in this
then it isn't really happening.

343
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,595
Here, l'm gonna show you.

344
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,681
Come on.
Come on, hit me.

345
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,932
- Huh?
- Hmm?

346
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,017
Mark, l don't know if this
is such a good idea.

347
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,353
- Hit me.
- Huh?

348
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,355
Come on! Hit me!

349
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,023
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

350
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,029
Don't listen to a word l say.

351
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,615
Just run like hell
to the time door!

352
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,409
ln the wall!

353
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,161
Come on!

354
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,871
Augh!

355
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,623
Let go of him, you beast!

356
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,793
Forget about me, you fool!

357
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,086
Run to the time door!

358
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,840
Quick! Kill Henry,
you piece of rotting cartilage!

359
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,635
Did you hear what l said?
Kill him!

360
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,346
Kill him!

361
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,976
Are you listening to me,
you ugly freak of death?

362
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,436
Do it now!

363
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,772
l made you! l gave you life!

364
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,202
Felix!

365
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,955

00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,364
There might be some tools in here.

554
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,284
You know, l'll--

555
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,621
l'll never forget the first
paranormal experiment

556
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,080
you showed me in college.

557
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,582
You tried to convince me
in your dorm room

558
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,420
that the ghost of Magellan
was bending spoons. Ha.

559
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,506
Of course,
l knew it was fake, but...

560
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:59,010
l didn't want to embarrass
you in front of Sally--

561
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,470
Aah!

562
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,933
[groans]

563
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,894
That was the wrong rope, Douglas.

564
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,784
Sorry.

565
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,746
That's all right.
No harm done.

566
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,665
Accidents do happen,
you know? l...

567
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,000
...l do hate nosebleeds, though.

568
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,336
lt's gonna get infected.

569
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,046
No time for that now, Douglas.

570
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,422
All right, now listen to me.

571
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,216
She'll kill us all.

572
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,467
This was the night--

573
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,593
[pop]
Aah!

574
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,679
...her mother murdered her.

575
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,138
- Big piece coming.
- Right, l understand.

576
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,473
Hoy-hah!

577
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,517
You see...

578
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,061
until the body
is read the committal,

579
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,813
her tormented soul--

580
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,897
[pop]
Uhh!

581
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,400
...will remain here
with her father's,

582
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:59,696
attacking anyone
who's here in the house.

583
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,825
That's why this was
such a perfect place

584
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,326
for our paranormal experiment,
you see?

585
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,620
So why don't we just read her
the committal?

586
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,790
Well...we could...

587
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,084
if we knew where her father
hid the body.

588
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,171
Well, we could just--

589
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,464
Whoa!

590
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:21,759
Are you all right?

591
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,761
Yeah.

592
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,269
[music]

593
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,105
That's it!

594
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,482
What?

595
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,694
The diamond
underneath the diamond.

596
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,709
You found her, Douglas!

597
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,587
Quickly. Read the body
the committal.

598
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,672
l've got a Bible somewhere.

599
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,090
lt's in my jack--

600
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,222
[low-pitched, evil voice]
Too late, raw thing.

601
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,767
Nobody's going to save
my daughter!

602
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,646
Douglas, stop her--
him-- it.

603
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,606
Just save the Bible.

604
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,663
[coughs]

605
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,710
Huaahh!

606
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:46,302
Ahh! Aah!
Aahhhhh! Ow!

607
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,351
Quick! Water! Quick!
Ho ho ho!

608
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,228
Ohh-whoo!

609
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,271
- Water!
- Douglas!

610
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,365
Sorry.

611
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,493
lt's all right.

612
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,287
- lt's uh--
[sighs]

613
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,205
lt's going numb.

614
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,459
Just start reading.

615
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,086
lt's almost dawn.

616
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,092
What do l do now?

617
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,510
Read directly to the bones.

618
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:32,056
Page 21 0,
chapter 1 3, verse 7.

[reading gibberish]

620
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,981
Douglas, the book
is upside-down.

621
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,566

You've done it!

640
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,049
You broke the evil spell.

641
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,350
l have to go.

642
00:48:59,144 --> 00:48:59,977
Where to, Douglas?

643
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:01,812
You wouldn't understand.

644
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,606
l don't understand.

645
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,691
You'll be all right?

646
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,777
Oh, uh...

lt's only a flesh wound.

Please take care of him.

651
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,454
Okay.

and tell it to self-destruct.

00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:52,863
Right.

655
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,117
You know, l've been figuring,
that meal we ate,

656
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,618
the same day we brought
on this cargo.

657
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,955
That must have been how the aliens
impregnated some of the crew.

658
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,456
Lucky you and l didn't have
any of that soup.

659
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,667
Soup?

00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,961
[gags]

661
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,463
There. Supply tent is set
to blow in three minutes.

662
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,673

Sarah.

667
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,320
Are you all right?

668
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,280
l've been looking for you everywhere.

669
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,532
Yes. l'm fine.

670
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,658
How did you find me?

671
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,285
Trust me, it wasn't easy.

672
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,828
Have you got the book?

673
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,539
- The book?
- Frankenstein's notebook.

674
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,791
Um...

675
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,502
Well, the Loch Ness monster
kind of ate it.

676
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,462
- lt did?
- Yes.

677
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,589
But l did get something great
from Haiti.

678
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,757
You're gonna love this. Look.

679
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:42,014
What is it?

680
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,892
lt's a voodoo petro coffin
for bringing the dead back to life.

681
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,227
l've got an instruction booklet

682
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,437
and the eye of newt, magic crystals,
and everything.

683
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,066
Wait until the prosecution
gets a load of this.

684
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,654
You can't imagine some of the places
l had to lug this thing through.

685
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,239
lt's not light, you know.

686
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,200
C'mon. Let's go.

687
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,868
But how are we going to get back?

699
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,040
l don't know, but you look stunning.

700
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,462
l'm afraid l've lost the time door opener.

701
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,505
Great!

702
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,799
Then we're never gonna find
our way back home.

703
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,678
Why didn't l stay and face up
to something for once in my life?

704
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,139
The only thing you would have faced
would have been the electric chair.

705
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:48,933
Sorry.

706
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:53,854
China told me James, Gemma,
they all died in that Waxwork.

707
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,606
So that's it: guilt.

708
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,274
You think you're responsible
for their deaths?

709
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,945
Sarah, what happened
in the Waxwork was not your fault.

710
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,905
Then l'll be found not guilty.

711
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,284
lf the world was fair, yes,

712
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:08,661
but it isn't.

713
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,537
And face it, Sarah.

714
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:13,040
No one's gonna believe your stupid
story about dead flesh walking,

715
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,583
not without some evidence
to prove it.

716

00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:00,838
Stop it!

719
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,675
Let her go!

720
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,698
Has Scarabis also taken
the one you loved?

721
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,117
- Scarabis?
- Yes.

722
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,119
The one they call The Master.

723
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,414
He took my Lenore, you know,

724
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,958
many, many moons ago.

725
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,168
lt was shortly after that

726
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:46,133
we found her horribly rotten and
abused body in Bedlow's Swamp.

727
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,385
The Master is no mortal.

728
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,637
He is the Devil himself.

729
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,349
Where can l find this Scarabis?

730
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:56,810
The Castle of Poe,
a place of much evil.

731
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,313
l must go.

732
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,775

Go east through the forest.

You will find it.

736
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:18,999

744

So bloody bored.

752
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:03,770
So tell me.

753
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,026
How do you think l'm going to look
on the throne of England?

754
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,153
Absolutely divine, Master.

755
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,446
That will have to change.

757
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,868

The Sergeant is here.

lt's just that tonight is so important.

776
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:32,025
But l don't want
to marry the king.

777
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,278
You will do as you are told,
Madeline.

With Philip, you say?

783
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,050
We should have killed
that meddling boy a long time ago.

784
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:00,554
Well, it would only have made
Madeline more difficult.

785
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,722
We'll do it
when the time is right.

We gotta get you out of here.

is up to some pretty bizarre stuff.

in here while you were out cold.

01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,750
No, it's not any of our problem

l mean, it's not our problem

849
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,811
what kind of diabolical scheme
he's planning

850
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,105
to unleash upon civilization, is it?

851
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,361
Did you know the king
is supposed to ask

852
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,530
for my hand in marriage
at dinner tonight?

853
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,324
Fascinating.

854
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,660
Excuse me?

01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:42,956
This guy must be pretty good.

l'll spare you the gory details,

858
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,459
but if he's done
what it says in here,

859
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,795
he should be able to change shape
with any living thing

860
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:49,963
within a given proximity.

861
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:51,840
Now, why would he
want to do that?

862
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,592
Mark, it's none of our business.

863
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,137
History has worked itself out
without us,

864
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,014
and we know that
because we studied it in class

865
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,515
700 years from now.

866
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,351
So please, let's just
find some kind of evidence

867
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,770
and figure out how we're going
to get back to the 20th century

868
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:09,149
before one of these worlds
possesses us forever, okay?

869
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,817
All right. Okay.

870
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:14,320
You know, sometimes l think
you actually enjoy all this hero stuff.

871
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,530
- What--
- l mean--

872
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,948
Well, well, well!

01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:34,883
we really do need to talk.

What are you going
to do with him?

880
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:40,305
That, my dear Madeline,
depends on you.

- Me?
- Yes.

882
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,018
You see, if your brother is
to ever achieve real happiness,

883
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,687
then you must willingly
marry the king.

884
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:50,231
And a happy brother
is a happy George.

885
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,193
- But what's that to Mark?
- Who?

886
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,986
- Philip.
- lt's simple.

887
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:57,322
You see, if you stop thinking
with your pussoir

888
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,616
and be a good girl

889
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,619
then l will make sure
that Philip escapes.

916
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:35,248
This is a heavy thing
to fly around with.

917
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,624
What a mess you're in.

918
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,126
Would you mind telling me
what's going on?

919
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,295
l'm not allowed
to tell you too much.

920
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:45,758
ln fact, this is the last time your grandfather
or l are ever allowed to help you.

921
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:47,343
- Grandfather?
- Yes.

922
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:48,720
l think you met him earlier.

923
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,306
The beggar. He was--

924
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,765
Exactly!

925
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,767
l'm afraid from here on in,
you're on your own.

926
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:56,728
On my own in what?

927
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,604
When you first used
Solomon's locket,

928
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:01,566
you opened a doorway
to another universe, Cartagra.

929
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,444
Cartagra.

930
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:06,863
A place where the true battle
between good and evil

931
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,531
is played out for eternity.

932
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:10,116
l still don't--

933
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:12,785
Let me try putting this in a more,
oh, earthly way.

934
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:17,081
Sarah and you have actually stumbled
into God's Nintendo game.

935
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,291
No.

936
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,960
Oh, yes! Where He
and the Devil fight it out,

937
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:24,714
using their various time warriors
as different characters,

938
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:28,092
forever trying to tip that delicate
balance one way or another.

939
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,803
And if evil ever wins
one of these battles, then--

940
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:34,223
The results in the real world
are more than horrific.

941
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,267
Earthquakes, floods, war.

942
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:37,894
Then this isn't real.

943
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,145
You tell me.

944
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,898
Ah! There.

945
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:51,491
Thank you.

946
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:55,995
ls there a way back?

947
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:57,997
Yes. But be careful.

948
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:00,124
Even though each locket
enables its owner

949
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:03,669
to indefinitely open time doors
around Cartagra,

950
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,672
it can only be used
to open the main door,

951
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:09,801
the one that joins
the two universes, twice.

952
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,719
You've already opened it once.

953
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,763
That's okay.
We only need the trip back.

954
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:19,352
Before you do go rushing back
to your world, Mark, remember,

955
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:22,146
it is one of the greatest
privileges ever

956
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,482
to be chosen as a time warrior.

957
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,316
You mean He--

958
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:31,656
l mean, God wants me to be
a time warrior?

959
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,200
Maybe you're one already, Mark.

960
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:36,744
And Sarah?

961
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:38,913
What about her?

962
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:42,417
l think she has too much left to settle
in her own world, don't you?

963
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,627
But what--

964
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:46,254
l know.

965
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,630
And l'm sure when the time comes,

966
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:48,965
you will make the right decision.

967
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:52,051
Well, l have to go now.

968
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,679
What? Sir Wilfred,

969
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,764
how do l get the locket
to open the main door again?

970
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,559
Take a minute to think about it,

971
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,893
then guess.

972
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:44,645
Wine! More
wine the table 'round!

973
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:55,239
My liege.

974
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,020
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

975
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:09,522
Are you all right?

976
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,524
lt's all right. He just fainted.

977
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:12,733
Let's take him out of here.

978
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:15,736
His Majesty will be fine.

979
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,406
Let the music continue.

980
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,326
Tsk tsk tsk.

981
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,871
Now, you wouldn't want
your boyfriend's death

982
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:27,456
to be the main event
of the evening,

983
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:28,708
now would you, my flower?

984
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,296
[shouting]

985
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,297
MARK: Give me the key!

986
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:42,555
Uhh!

987
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,869
[cheering]

988
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,461
Do you guys
know how to fight?

989
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,920
Yeah!

990
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,507
Let's go kick some butt!

991
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,220
MAN: What? What'd he say?
Kick some what?

992
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,931
ln here. ln here.

993
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,232
lt's probably a fever.

994
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:38,611
We must keep him
away from drafts.

995
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,333
Don't you fools know anything?

996
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,259
Let no one in.

997
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,804
l'll fetch my physician.

998
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,897
Hurry up. Hurry!

999
01:18:28,161 --> 01:19:07,658
[chanting]

1000
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,857
[shouting]

1001
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:44,320
Be on guard.

1002
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:06,050
Gather up the rest!

1003
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,636
Gather up the rest!
Hurry!

1004
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:13,182
So what do you want?

1005
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,559
The girl.
l just want the girl.

1006
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:17,937
Girl? What girl?
This is where the king rests.

1007
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:20,356
The king?
What's wrong with him?

1008
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,901
He's sick,
if it's any of your concern.

1009
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:26,445
The king's life is in danger.
You must believe me.

1010
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:29,198
Scarabis is trying to
impersonate the king.

1011
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,324
He's using Black Magic.

1012
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,159
Black Magic.

1013
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,744
l know it sounds crazy,
but you must believe me!

1014
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:34,578
Check his room!

1015
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:36,831
Just do that for me.
Check his room.

1016
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:42,044
All right.
All right, l will.

1017
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:46,549
Your Majesty!

1018
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:47,800
Your Majesty.

1019
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:51,595
Danger, eh?

1020
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,806
Your Majesty, Scarabis
is trying to impersonate--

1021
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,057
Take these rebels prisoner.

1022
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:55,891
Wait.

1023
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,102
The boy has done no harm.

1024
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,813
Right or wrong,
he was only trying to help.

1025
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:03,816
Take him to one
of the castle rooms.

1026
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:05,985
Give him some food and drink.

1027
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,280
l would like to hear more.

1028
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,532
As you wish, Your Majesty.

1029
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:14,326
Your crest ring.

1030
01:21:14,494 --> 01:21:15,995
Where is your crest ring?

1031
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,830
Ring?

1032
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:20,833
What are you talking about?

1033
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,339
Tell your men to follow me.

1034
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:31,719
Well, follow him, then!
Follow him!

1035
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:37,182
[guards talking]

1036
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:39,768
Don't let this man out of your sight.

1037
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:41,896
Have you gone mad?

1038
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,606
l'm the king!

1039
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,441
l shall have your head for this.

1040
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:46,901
You heard me.

1041
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,486
But-- But...

1042
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:50,696
But he's the king.

1043
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:51,780
Hello?

1044
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,616
H-H-Hello?

1045
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:03,751
Now to make sure The Master
retains your identity forever.

1046
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,461
Hey, Torquemada.

1047
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,129
Huh?

1048
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,673
Try picking on someone
your own size.

1049
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:11,634
Mon Dieu!

1050
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,180
- Out of my way!
- After him!

1051
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:23,979
You all right, Your Majesty?

1052
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,941
Yes. Yes.

1053
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,318
Who is this brave young man?

1054
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,739
He and his friend uncovered
Scarabis' plan to take over the throne.

1055
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,741
l can't thank you enough.

1056
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:37,451
lt was an honor.

1057
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:41,747
Your Majesty.

1058
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:46,961
Where is Scarabis?

1059
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,129
The man l asked you to hold?

1060
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:51,715
Where is he?

1061
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,053
Uh...he left.

1062
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,430
l mean, he was the king,
wasn't he?

1063
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:00,808
l mean, l couldn't have
stopped him...

1064
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,185
...could l?

1065
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,980
Just tell your men
to take the castle.

1066
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,023
Hold everybody,
including the king.

1067
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:10,609
Do as he says.

1068
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:12,987
Crikey.

1069
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:19,326
And release the prisoners.

1070
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,452
KlNG: All of them.

1071
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:22,496
They fight for England.

1072
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,254
l don't know how to thank you.

1073
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:32,256
No problem.

1074
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:35,509
Hmm.

1075
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:41,348
The Master must have
a secret escape somewhere.

1076
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:02,703
Ow!

1077
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:08,667
Open the altar.

1078
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:10,169
Of course, Your Majesty.

1079
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:35,778
Aah!

1080
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:46,872
Scarabis, let the girl go.

1081
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,061
[punches landing]

1082
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:07,369
Mark.

1083
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,037
Mark, speak to me.

1084
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,789
Get away from that idiot.

1085
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,792
My future wife kneels to nobody.

1086
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,422
Future what?

1087
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:20,340
l'm your sister.

1088
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:23,802
But when l became king,

1089
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,762
you would have also
been my wife.

1090
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:29,933
And together, we'd have had
pure, beautiful children

1091
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:31,852
to rule this country with.

1092
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,979
You're-- You're sick!

1093
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,314
Moi?

1094
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:37,107
Yes, you!

1095
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:40,736
