1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:07,139
(slow solemn music)

2
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,724
(school bell ringing)

3
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:40,172
- [VOICEOVER] I
believe in control,

4
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,341
the only force mighty
enough to bring order

5
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,710
in the chaos that is my world.

6
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,130
- Congrats!

7
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,832
- Oh, thanks.

8
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,601
- "Oh thanks." Like
it's not a big deal?

9
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,703
- It's really not.

10
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,772
- To some people, it is.

11
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,466
- Hey Lyla.

12
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:41,533
Sorry about the...

13
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,801
- Oh, please.

14
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,404
I'd much rather
be your VP anyway.

15
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:46,505
- Okay.

16
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:50,309
Alright ladies, settle
down, settle down.

17
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:53,245
Alright, see we're all here.

18
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:57,249
Oh, I had a chance to read
these and I have to say,

19
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,685
these are really, really great.

20
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,490
Thought-provoking and
critically engaging.

21
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:08,193
I am very, very
impressed with your work.

22
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:15,767
Now, anyone who's interested
in a little extra credit

23
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,137
should consider
applying to Columbia's

24
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,506
annual Young Writer's Program.

25
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:26,311
They're accepting applicants
for their pre-college workshop.

26
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,718
I think you'd be a great fit.

27
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,153
Yes, Lyla.

28
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,354
- If we apply, can we
come by after school

29
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,922
for some extra one-on-one help?

30
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:40,259
(girls giggling)

31
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,261
- Um,

32
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,462
you can use the rest
of the class time

33
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,264
to work on the assignment.

34
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:48,800
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

35
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,571
- I got a freaking B+,
can you believe it?

36
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,373
- You did so bad.

37
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,474
- Well, what did you get?

38
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,476
- Um,

39
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,443
I passed.

40
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:02,281
- He said he wasn't
gonna be easy on us.

41
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:05,484
- Well, you got
an A, didn't you?

42
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,419
- Of course she did.

43
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,523
(hip-hop music)

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,494
- [Boy In Car] Hey Belle!

45
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,562
- Oh my God.

46
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:20,399
- [Boy In Car] Look what I got.

47
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,670
Want a ride?

48
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,737
- [Girl With Ponytail]
You have to say yes.

49
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,739
- Say no.

50
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:38,885
- Hi guys.

51
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,320
Hey Gus, nice car.

52
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,821
- [Gus] Come on, get in.

53
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,323
- No way.

54
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,557
- Well, why not?

55
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,393
(car engine revving)

56
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,362
Look, I'll just drive you home.

57
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,397
- Gus, you don't have a license.

58
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,498
[Gus Scoffing]

59
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,566
- Yeah, I do.

60
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,268
- No, you don't.

61
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,636
You have a permit, you're
supposed to be driving

62
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,971
with a parent.

63
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,272
- Yeah, well yeah
yeah, whatever.

64
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,873
Just come on, get in.

65
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,582
- Sorry.

66
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,496
Then, Mr. Davy said
I had a good chance

67
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,431
at getting into the program, so

68
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,033
I'm gonna apply for the summer.

69
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,668
- [Belle's Dad]
Well, that's perfect.

70
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,005
- Which means I have to go
to Columbia for the workshop,

71
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,673
which means I already
have a good chance

72
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,609
at getting in there for college.

73
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,479
I know it's early, but
you have to start thinking

74
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,982
about college early, because
one thing affects another

75
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,717
and everything else.

76
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:48,921
- Hmm.

77
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:55,427
- Why don't you ever ask me
how my day at school goes, dad?

78
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:59,765
- We know we don't have
to worry about you, Belle.

79
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,433
- I got elected class president.

80
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,303
- [Belle's Dad] That's great,
sweetie, congratulations.

81
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,305
- Thanks.

82
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,443
- President of the school, wow.

83
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,378
My baby is so smart.

84
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,447
- Not of the school,
dad, just my class.

85
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,915
Like the freshman class.

86
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,017
(phone buzzing)

87
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:19,985
- [Belle's Dad] Sorry.

88
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:20,987
Yeah, Bob.

89
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:32,064
- [VOICEOVER Of Belle] Name:
Annabelle. Grade: freshman.

90
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,902
Class: English Honors.
Teacher: Mr. Davy.

91
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,441
My role model...

92
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:49,381
My role model is my mom
because she is the person

93
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,351
in my life who
cares most about me.

94
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:57,489
She is smart, beautiful,
and hard-working,

95
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,060
everything I wanna be.

96
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,731
She helped me make
pins and posters

97
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,766
for my presidential campaign,

98
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:11,370
helped me write my speech,
and even baked cupcakes

99
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,437
for the PTA.

100
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,378
She wants to see me
succeed and pushes me

101
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,114
to live up to my full potential.

102
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,983
I try to make her proud.

103
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,830
(ominous music)

104
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,933
- Mom, mom can I come in?

105
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,538
Mom! I'm coming in!

106
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,043
Mom.

107
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,984
Dad, where's mom?

108
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,589
- Uh, in the darkroom.

109
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:14,092
- No she's not, I
was just in there.

110
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,026
- I don't know, sweetie.

111
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,561
She must have stepped out.

112
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,763
- All her photos,
everything's gone.

113
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,666
- You know, she must have
had an exhibition tonight.

114
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,236
- She didn't tell me about it.

115
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,251
Mom.

116
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,261
Hey mom, it's your Anabelle.

117
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,730
Just wanna know when
you were coming home.

118
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,599
I got some really good
news at school today.

119
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,736
Call me back when you get this.

120
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:01,306
Oh! I'm applying for
this writer's program

121
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,277
and I've been working on my
application essay all day.

122
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,314
I should really take a break,
but I kinda wanna finish it.

123
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,752
Are you at an exhibition?

124
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,721
I can come visit.

125
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,825
Call me back when you get this.

126
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,839
Mom, I didn't get to tell
you about the PTA meeting.

127
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,309
It's Friday at seven and
I'm gonna give my speech

128
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,144
as class president.

129
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,582
Oh, that's my good news, I
got elected class president.

130
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:48,053
So if you get home early,
maybe we can go to dinner

131
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,288
or something to celebrate.

132
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,159
I mean, it's not president
of the school, but

133
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,161
it's still good, right?

134
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,267
Mom, where are you?

135
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,789
- Everything alright?

136
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,791
- Fine.

137
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,232
- You can take a break
every once in a while.

138
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,934
- That's alright.

139
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,673
- Belle, if you ever
need someone to talk to,

140
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,975
well, you know where I
am, so you can always...

141
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,111
- I'm good, Mr. Davy.

142
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,113
Thanks.

143
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,368
Is mom home?

144
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,242
Have you talked to her?

145
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,277
- Yeah, this morning.

146
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,281
- Really? Why hasn't she
been answering my calls?

147
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,383
- She just needs time.

148
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,019
- For what?

149
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,254
- For herself.

150
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,390
Belle, you know how she is.

151
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,966
(sighing)

152
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,400
(ominous music)

153
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,492
- So, are you guys doing
a theme for the dance?

154
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,194
- Belle and I haven't
really discussed it.

155
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,864
We'll probably talk about
it at the next meeting.

156
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,533
- A fire-hot freshman theme,
kinda like an inferno!

157
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,368
- Are you going with Gus?

158
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,335
- To the dance?

159
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,904
- No, to the moon.

160
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,242
- She doesn't even wanna
go with him anyway, right?

161
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,211
- Yeah, of course.

162
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,647
- I don't know.

163
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,082
In some sort of weird way,
they're kind of cute together.

164
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,284
- You're too good for him.

165
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,919
There's so many other
cute Briary boys.

166
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,153
- That your parents won't hate.

167
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,122
- Oh yeah, what's up
with your mom anyway?

168
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,891
Heard she hasn't been
home in like a week.

169
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:47,525
- Where'd you hear that?

170
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:48,860
- Small town.

171
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,031
- Yeah well, she's
away on business.

172
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,401
- Photographers
do business trips?

173
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,369
- [Blonde Girl] Where'd she go?

174
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,171
- Anybody want the rest?

175
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,973
I had a big breakfast.

176
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,274
- I'll take it.

177
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,915
(girls chatting)

178
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,217
- Hey Belle.

179
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,551
- Hey Gus.

180
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,886
- [Gus] What's going on, Belle?

181
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,221
- Nothing much, Gus.

182
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,322
- [Gus] Want a ride?

183
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,623
- Not today, Gus.

184
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,930
(computer alert beeping)

185
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:28,259
(ominous music)

186
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,449
- [Mr. Davy] Next on
the agenda, committees.

187
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,284
Now, we're looking for
parents who have not yet

188
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,521
signed up for a committee
to help with fundraising.

189
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,489
- Is your mom still heading
publicity this year?

190
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,124
- [Belle] Yes, of course.

191
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,161
- When is she coming
back from her trip?

192
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,395
- I'm not sure.

193
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,997
- [Lyla] Haven't
you talked to her?

194
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:06,999
- Yes.

195
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,785
I left a message.

196
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:13,470
- A message, so you haven't
actually spoken to her?

197
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,142
She didn't really leave
for work, did she?

198
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,210
- Excuse me.

199
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,447
- [Mr. Davy] And now,
I'd like to turn it over

200
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,182
to our headmaster...

201
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,753
- [Headmaster] Welcome
to the first PTA meeting

202
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,121
of freshman year.

203
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,457
(applause)

204
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,424
- Where's Belle?

205
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,474
- I think she went
to the bathroom.

206
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,477
- Now?

207
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,158
- Hey, uh, nervous?

208
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,461
- I'm good.

209
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,699
- Yeah, you are, but
do you know that?

210
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,234
- Know what?

211
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,468
- You're good.

212
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,571
Okay, (mumbles)
- I gotta make my speech.

213
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,540
- Look, how about
we get out of here?

214
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,043
How about I drive you home?

215
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,248
Look, you know you
don't have to do

216
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,151
anything you don't
want to, right?

217
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:44,629
- Now, I'll turn it
over to our executive

218
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,365
board freshman class president

219
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,467
who will give a
couple of remarks

220
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:54,272
discussing some of the upcoming
events this year, so...

221
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,474
(applause)

222
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,846
- Thanks, I got this.

223
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,518
Thanks, Mr. Davy.

224
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,456
Firstly, I just want to
thank all the parents

225
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,558
in attendance today
who are so engaged

226
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,327
in their children's education.

227
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,232
- [VOICEOVER Of Belle]
I want to believe

228
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,500
my mom is coming back.

229
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:26,637
I mean, it's not like
she's done this before,

230
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:30,141
but for some reason,
I'm not surprised.

231
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,414
No matter how involved
in my life she was,

232
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,883
she's always seemed distracted,

233
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:45,590
not really listening, there,
but not like really there.

234
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,698
Well, she was there for
everyone else to see,

235
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,400
but come to think of it, I...

236
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:02,673
I don't remember the
last time she hugged me.

237
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,414
- [Lyla] What are you doing?

238
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,549
- [Belle] Nothing.

239
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,551
- Your dad let me in.

240
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:25,723
New hobby?

241
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,391
- It's my mom's.

242
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,361
- [Lyla] She won't get mad?

243
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,629
- No, she said I could use it.

244
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:32,964
- You talked to her?

245
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,968
- Yeah, she just gotta
figure some stuff out.

246
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,970
- Right.

247
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,542
- Um, so do you wanna do
just traditional pink and red

248
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,310
or red and black?

249
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,812
I was actually thinking we
could do something classy.

250
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:51,282
Maybe black and white
with pink and red accents,

251
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:55,753
but Olivia's so set on red-hot
theme, that I don't know.

252
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,754
- Right.
- Yeah.

253
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,989
I found this great website.

254
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,658
Here, I'll show you
some of my ideas.

255
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,662
- [Lyla] Who is this person?

256
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,531
- [Belle] Who?

257
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,667
- This person, right there.

258
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,008
- I don't know who that is.

259
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,809
- But why are you on this page?

260
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,645
- I mean, it's just...

261
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,882
- Why does it say
your name is Ana?

262
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,484
- Nobody uses their real names.

263
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,785
- So you lie?

264
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,054
- Well, Ana is the
first part of my name,

265
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,689
so technically, no.

266
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,592
- Wow.

267
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,595
- It's not a big deal.

268
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:40,031
- You're not planning
on killing yourself

269
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,465
or anything, right?

270
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,366
- What? No.

271
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,618
Why would you say that?

272
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:44,869
- I don't know, it
just looks like that.

273
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:46,937
- No, it's just thinspo.

274
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,041
- Right.

275
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:53,077
- Thinspiration, just
inspiration to keep thin.

276
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,446
- I know what thinspo is.

277
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,586
- Don't tell anyone?

278
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:06,792
- Of course.

279
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:13,464
- [Mr. Davy] How does the 25th

280
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,001
work for you?

281
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,370
We should set up a meeting
of the executive council.

282
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,371
I was thinking we
could get started

283
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,340
on the dance early this year.

284
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,575
It is our big fundraiser
for the spring trip,

285
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:27,078
and I was wondering if your mom

286
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,412
could give us some of the photos

287
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,514
that she has from
last year's dance

288
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,716
to help them with his year's.

289
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,884
I didn't see her
at the PTA meeting.

290
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,619
- Oh, she was there.

291
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:36,821
- She was?

292
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:37,823
- Mhm.

293
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,493
You know what?

294
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,627
I'll tell her to bring it
to back-to-school night.

295
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,963
- Sounds great.

296
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,469
- So how are you gonna
pull that one off?

297
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,104
- What do you mean?

298
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,774
- You're only lying to yourself.

299
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,453
(energetic music)

300
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,130
- [Belle] Let's go.

301
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,998
- Uh, are you sure?

302
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,832
(school bell ringing)

303
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,834
- Hurry up.

304
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:32,143
(car engine revving)

305
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,577
- [Girl On Left] That is Belle.

306
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,612
- [Girl With Gray Bag]
That can't be Belle.

307
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,714
- Well, that's Gus's car.

308
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:40,651

I'm glad I ran into you,
I still haven't received

340
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,575
your essay for the
application yet.

341
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,577
- Oh, I'm not finished.

342
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,248
- Okay, well please hurry.

343
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,916
That deadline is
fast approaching.

344
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:21,218
- Of course. I'll
have it done soon.

345
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,053
- [Mr. Davy] Perfect.

346
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,317
- (Imitating whipping
sound) Whipped!

347
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,586
- Joey, just shut up.

348
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,087
- You know, you smell like ass.

349
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:57,888
- Oh yeah?

350
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,024
Well, you are an ass.

351
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,559
- How precious.

352
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:05,129
- Joey, I swear to God,
if you don't leave me...

353
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:07,565
- Uh oh, uh oh, preppy's
gonna get serious.

354
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,767
- Joey, get the
hell out of my room.

355
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:10,968
- [Joey] Yeah, well
tell someone who cares.

356
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,270
- Joey, get out of my room now.

357
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,339
- You get out.

358
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:16,640
(Gus sighing)

359
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,242
- [Gus] God!

360
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:22,313
(Joey imitating whipping sound)

361
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,197
- Really?

362
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,636
- Hey Belle, how was your break?

363
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:46,670
- Great.

364
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,339
- We didn't hear
from you at all.

365
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:51,375
I was the lucky one who
didn't get a present.

366
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:54,378
- Oh, I'm so sorry,
I completely forgot

367
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,713
about our Secret Santa.

368
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:58,115
- Yeah, and the student
council meeting.

369
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,684
- Don't worry, I'll be there.

370
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,319
- It was yesterday.

371
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,290
Are you still planning
for the dance?

372
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,958
- Yeah, of course.

373
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,927
- Okay, because it just
seems like Lyla's been doing

374
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,829
all the work and the party
committee was just wondering

375
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:14,131
if we should listen to
her because you haven't

376
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,166
really been telling
us what to do.

377
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,235
- Yeah, I spoke to Lyla.

378
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,171
Just listen to her.

379
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:25,843
(school bell ringing)

380
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,980
(slow solemn music)

381
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,421
- Next.

382
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,661
Come on, put that down. Step up.

383
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,105
85.2

384
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,976
- What?

385
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:00,377
- You're 85.

386
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,345
- Really?

387
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,780
- [Nurse] Yep.

388
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,792
(computer alert beeping)

389
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,166
- Excuse me, hi, yes.

390
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,284
This is Mr. Davy, I'm looking
for one of my students,

391
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,953
Anabelle.

392
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,924
I was wondering what class
she's in this period.

393
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:56,226
The freshman, that's right.

394
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,304
- You wanted to see me?

395
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,139
- Yes, have a seat.

396
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,913
I was going over
the applications

397
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,915
for the program the other day,

398
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:20,851
and I couldn't find your essay.

399
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:24,354
So I was wondering
when you handed it in.

400
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,357
- I didn't.

401
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,130
- Why not?

402
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,237
Do you still want to?

403
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,905
Do you want me to
pull a few strings?

404
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,507
Want me to get you
some more time?

405
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,509
- No,

406
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,244
that's okay Mr. Davy.

407
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,513
- Are you sure?

408
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,254
Is everything alright?

409
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,256
- Fine.

410
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,459
- Belle, I know you're
upset about the grade

411
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,127
you received this
marking period,

412
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,630
but that doesn't mean
that you should give up.

413
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:07,632
- I know.

414
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:11,501
- Look, when I was

415
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:16,607
first starting out, I wanted
to be a science teacher,

416
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:22,246
but I got stuck
teaching English instead

417
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,550
which turned out to be okay

418
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,487
because I still got to
do what I wanted to do.

419
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,556
I got to teach you guys.

420
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:39,296
I guess what I'm saying
is life isn't perfect

421
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,365
and you can't always
get what you want,

422
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,634
but you can get pretty close.

423
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,275
- What took you so long?

424
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,277
- Sorry,

425
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,946
a teacher kept me.

426
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:58,115
- Was it Mr. Davy?

427
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:00,350
And give you that rose?

428
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,986
- Do you have to smoke in here?

429
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,256
- You kinda stress me out.

430
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,091
- It's nasty.

431
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,427
- So open the window.

432
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,628
- It's freezing.

433
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,231
- You complain way too much.

434
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,334
- You really shouldn't smoke.

435
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,402
- Why, because
you don't like it?

436
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,037
- No,

437
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,372
well, yeah, but it's
not good for you.

438
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:26,410
- Well starving yourself
isn't good for you neither.

439
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,054
So I was wondering,

440
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,093
wanna go to the dance?

441
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,429
- Is this a trick question?

442
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,197
- Uh, why you gotta
make it so difficult?

443
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,465
- Are you asking
me if I wanna go

444
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,200
or if I wanna go with you?

445
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,169
- Do you wanna go to the
dance with me? Yes or no.

446
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:55,205
- Yes, yes, I wanna go with you.

447
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:56,440
- Cool.

448
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,841
- [Belle] What
changed your mind?

449
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,241
- You know, I just
thought I'd steal you

450
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,445
before Mr. Davy gets a chance.

451
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,213
- [Belle] Shut up.

452
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,014
- Make me.

453
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,248
- Shut up.

454
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,183
- No, hey make me, make me,
- No stop!

455
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,185
- Come one, make me, come on.

456
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:28,205
(slow solemn music)

457
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:02,706
- So, I really need
to lose a few pounds

458
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,775
to fit into this gorgeous
dress that I tried on.

459
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,510
But it's gonna be
totally worth it

460
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:09,312
when somebody actually
asks me to go.

461
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,681
- You should ask Belle
to teach you her secrets.

462
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,116
You could do that, right?

463
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:15,218
You slimmed down from
all that thinspo.

464
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
- Oh.

465
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:19,523
I mean, it was just nothing.

466
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:21,792
I was just stressed.

467
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:25,228
- What? When I'm
stressed, I eat more.

468
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,834
- So, are you

469
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,471
guys have any date to the dance?

470
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:35,506
- [Curly-Haired Girl] We
should all go together.

471
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,540
- [Girl With Ponytail]
No, I have a date.

472
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,574
- [Curly-Haired Girl] Who?

473
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,142
- Ryan asked me.

474
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,678
Does that mean Gus is going too?

475
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,816
- [Curly-Haired Girl]
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,

476
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:49,352
that's amazing, can
you guys believe this?

477
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,288
- [Girl With Ponytail]
I mean, it's a bad idea.

478
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,689
- [Curly-Haired Girl] Come
on, it's not a bad idea.

479
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,191
- [Girl With Ponytail]
It's not a bad idea,

480
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,327
it's a great idea.

481
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,462
- [Curly-Haired Girl]
It's okay, I mean come on,

482
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,564
be happy for her.

483
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:04,367
- Now, to get us in the
mood for Valentine's Day,

484
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,605
we are going to be reading
some of your love sonnets.

485
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,377
(speaker drowns out)

486
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,717
Who would like to go first?

487
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,721
Great, Belle, thank you
so much for volunteering.

488
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:25,856
Why don't you come up to
the front of the class

489
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:27,424
to present for us.

490
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,865
(girls gasping)
- [Classmates] Oh my God.

491
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,583
- Did I...

492
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:55,819
Did I pass out?

493
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:56,821
- Mhm.

494
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:16,373
- I think I'm still
queasy from biology.

495
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,542
We're dissecting frogs.

496
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:21,811
- Everything okay?

497
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,180
- She's fine.

498
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,416
I just called her
father, he's on his way

499
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,717
to pick her up.

500
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,953
- Oh no, you didn't
have to do that.

501
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,388
- Oh yes she did.

502
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,324
School protocol,
right Nurse Duffy?

503
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:37,861
Mind if I have a moment
to speak with Belle?

504
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,697
Thank you.

505
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,546
Belle, I'm worried about you.

506
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,415
- Well you shouldn't be.

507
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:02,319
- You've been missing
class quite frequently.

508
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,753
- Kids miss class all the time.

509
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:07,624
- Not kids with perfect
attendance records.

510
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:11,528
How's everything
with your friends?

511
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,530
- [Belle] Fine.

512
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:16,600
- How are things
at home? How's dad?

513
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:22,005
- I don't know.

514
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:24,441
- [Mr. Davy] You don't know?

515
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,843
- I haven't seen him lately.

516
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,715
- Well, what about mom?

517
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,829
Belle, you're a really wonderful
role model for this school.

518
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,330
- I should get going.

519
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,398
- All the girls look up to you.

520
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,933
- I have to go...

521
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,001
- And I know your mom would
be very proud if she knew...

522
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,003
- Enough!

523
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,477
- I'm here if you wanna talk.

524
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,714
(cellphone alerts beeping)

525
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,035
(rock music)

526
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,638
- She doesn't need you, Gus.

527
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,675
All she needs is a
car and a way out.

528
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,378
Don't be stupid, okay?

529
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,463
You really think she's
gonna give a shit

530
00:39:09,464 --> 00:39:10,547
about you as much as
you care about her?

531
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:11,614
Huh? Do you?

532
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,591
(Belle's dad clearing throat)

533
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:22,992
- I'm fine, dad.

534
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:26,463
- [Belle's Dad] What's
the problem now?

535
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:28,898
- I just forgot
to eat breakfast.

536
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,668
- Why aren't you eating?
We have food in this house.

537
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,704
- It's not a big deal,
I'm just stressed.

538
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,606
- You're stressed?

539
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,742
You don't have to pay the bills.

540
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:39,976
You don't have to
get the groceries.

541
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,378
You don't have to
do the laundry.

542
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,146
You don't have one
person to worry about.

543
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,548
You go to school, you
keep your room clean,

544
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,016
you do your homework, that's it.

545
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,551
- Don't you think that's
hard enough sometimes?

546
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,053
- Then why don't you spend
more time on your work

547
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,755
and less time in the darkroom?

548
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,390
- Dad, come on.

549
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,824
- What are you
trying to be anyway?

550
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:58,128
You trying to be more
like your mother?

551
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,033
I don't want you
in there anymore.

552
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,468
- Dad!

553
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,403
- You've gotta learn to
be responsible, Belle.

554
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:08,671
- I'm trying really hard.

555
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,473
- Look, I've gotta
get back to work,

556
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:13,009
but I need you to eat something.

557
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,748
- I'm really not that hungry.

558
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,986
- The nurse said I have to
watch you eat it, Belle.

559
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:27,090
- I'll eat it in a little bit.

560
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:49,647
- One bite.

561
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:14,604
Thank you.

562
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,144
I'll be home in time for dinner.

563
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:24,681
I love you.

564
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:35,692
(Belle coughing and gagging)

565
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:50,540
(foreboding music)

566
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:32,775
- Hey dad.

567
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,745
I think you should be
on your way home by now,

568
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,280
but if you're staying
late, that's cool.

569
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,381
Just...

570
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:42,085
I ordered in tonight, just
call me back when you get this

571
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:46,255
and maybe I can call them
to come a little later.

572
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,093
Never mind.

573
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:57,834
- Hey, ready to go?

574
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:01,371
- Where?

575
00:44:02,374 --> 00:44:05,375
Oh, I forgot, I
forgot to call you.

576
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:09,879
I'm gonna have to
cancel tonight.

577
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,117
- You're kidding, right?

578
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,353
- Well, my dad is on
his way home, so...

579
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:18,655
- So?

580
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:22,959
- So he sort of picked
me up from school today

581
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,661
after I fainted.

582
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:26,396
- Wait, you fainted?

583
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,833
Why didn't you call me?

584
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:41,411
You know, when he wasn't
there for you, I was.

585
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:49,952
(door hinges squeaking)

586
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:08,438
- Oh, back so soon?

587
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:11,340
What happened?

588
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:15,912
- It's just her stupid dad.

589
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:20,183
Can't mess with the pops.

590
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:19,876
(toilet flushing)

591
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:59,081
(ominous music)

592
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:21,437
(rock music)

593
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,351
- Hey girls.

594
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:44,287
- Oh, hi Mr. Davy.

595
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,688
- Where's Belle today?

596
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,292
- I don't know, we haven't
really seen her much lately.

597
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:51,795
- Is that so?

598
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:54,297
- Yeah, she's been hanging
out with her boy toy.

599
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:55,299
- Shut up.

600
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,151
- Well, if she's not
in school tomorrow,

601
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,969
please let her know that she
will not be going to the dance.

602
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:02,605
She should be
setting an example.

603
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:10,379
- Are you messaging her?

604
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:11,447
- Of course.

605
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:22,358
(cellphone alert beeping)

606
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:41,077
- Can I get my
girlfriend for like,

607
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,611
five minutes please?

608
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:58,762
Hey.

609
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:05,501
- Can you untwist this please?

610
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:07,503
- Okay.

611
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:21,217
There you go.

612
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:38,267
So do you like the movie so far?

613
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,469
- [Belle] It's
okay, it's boring.

614
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:43,406
- But you're the one
that suggested it.

615
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:47,076
- Well, I suggested it
because you like it.

616
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:49,745
- Okay, then what
do you wanna watch?

617
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,814
People kissing in the rain
or something like that?

618
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:52,816
- No.

619
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,639
- (Sighing) Okay, seriously.

620
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,107
Are you ever gonna
put that thing down?

621
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:19,109
- Um, no.

622
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,744
- Hey, do you want my zip-up?

623
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,446
- I'll just turn the heat up.

624
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,547
- But it's hot.

625
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:01,450
- I'll just get a sweater then.

626
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,385
- Okay, what's
with your attitude?

627
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:04,587
- Sorry I'm not perfect!

628
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,788
- You could just be
a little nicer to me.

629
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,389
- Well, I can't
please everybody.

630
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:09,525
- What? Okay, what
is your problem?

631
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,494
- So now, I have a problem?

632
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:15,197
- Look, that's not
what I said, it's just...

633
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:16,199
God, um.

634
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,301
Okay, how about this?

635
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,670
How about I'll just
pause the movie

636
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,405
and you can go get your sweater?

637
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:25,341
- Don't bother, I'm just
gonna go to the darkroom.

638
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:26,909
I've got stuff to do.

639
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:28,611
- Wait, hold up. Stuff to do?

640
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,412
What, is it more
important than me?

641
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:31,514
- I guess.

642
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:34,550
- Alright fine.

643
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:35,484
I guess I'm not important enough

644
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,520
to take you to the dance then.

645
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:39,022
- What?

646
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:40,523
- You heard me, I
said I'm not going.

647
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:42,892
- [Belle] Stop, stop
being ridiculous.

648
00:52:42,894 --> 00:52:45,294
- Really? 'Cause I was thinking
the same thing about you.

649
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:46,629
- What's that supposed to mean?

650
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:48,597
- You can be so smart sometimes,

651
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:51,267
but yet, so dumb
at the same time.

652
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,535
- I'm dumb? You're dumb.

653
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,603
I'm not the one failing
out of high school.

654
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,605
- I'm missing my math test
right now because of you.

655
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:57,573
- Whatever.

656
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,687
You're dumb!

657
00:52:59,688 --> 00:53:01,800
- I'm not dumb enough
to starve myself

658
00:53:01,801 --> 00:53:04,121
and think that it's gonna bring
my mommy back or something.

659
00:53:10,922 --> 00:53:13,589
(Belle crying)

660
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:20,829
- [Automated Voice] Your
call has been forwarded

661
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:23,599
to an automated voice message.

662
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:10,246
(banging on door)

663
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:12,414
- [Gus] Belle, open the door.

664
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,882
Belle, come on, open the door.

665
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,618
- I'm fine, get out!

666
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:40,976
- Come on, Belle, open the
(screaming)

667
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,378
- [Belle] Mom.

668
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,514
- [Belle's Dad] No
sweetie, it's just me.

669
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,477
- I'm sorry.

670
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:19,581
- [Belle's Dad] It's
okay. It's okay, sweetie.

671
00:55:22,687 --> 00:55:24,520
- I really messed up.

672
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,490
- You're perfect.

673
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:37,499
(foreboding music)

674
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:46,608
- Hey Gus.

675
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,993
- [Gus] Hey Lyla.

676
00:55:47,994 --> 00:55:49,377
- I heard you were going
to the dance with Belle.

677
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,546
- Okay look, I don't have
time for this right now.

678
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:52,514
- Where is Belle anyway?

679
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:53,549
- Don't worry about it.

680
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,583
- [Lyla] Wasn't
she with you today?

681
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:55,451
- Well yeah, she was.

682
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:57,553
- [Lyla] Another fight?

683
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:58,987
- Why don't you just
stay out of it, okay?

684
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,556
- That's not what
you usually say.

685
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:01,890
- [Gus] What do
you want from me?

686
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:03,092
- Just a concerned friend.

687
00:56:03,094 --> 00:56:05,828
(Gus scoffing)

688
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,534
- [Gus] Look Mr. Davy,
we need to talk, okay?

689
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,369
- Gus, right.

690
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,036
I heard a lot about you.

691
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,471
- [Gus] One and only.

692
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:16,661
- Look, I'm sorry.

693
00:56:16,662 --> 00:56:17,850
I don't have time
for whatever trouble

694
00:56:17,851 --> 00:56:19,039
you've gotten
yourself into now, I...

695
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,610
- Just give me two
minutes, just two minutes.

696
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:23,712
- Don't they have
counselors over at Briary?

697
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,080
I really don't
have time to spare

698
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:27,015
for any of you
boys, I apologize.

699
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:28,550
- Yeah, that's right.

700
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,819
Focus most of your time
on these ladies, huh?

701
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:32,020
- Excuse me?

702
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:33,622
That was extremely
disrespectful.

703
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,124
(Gus scoffing)
Hey.

704
00:56:35,126 --> 00:56:38,460
I take my job seriously.
I worked very hard for it.

705
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:40,496
- Okay look, I know
you don't like me,

706
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:43,799
right back at ya, this
is very important.

707
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:47,836
- What do you mean?

708
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:48,637
- Belle, I've scheduled
a follow-up meeting

709
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,406
with the nurse today.

710
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:51,774
I'd appreciate it if you
saw her after school.

711
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:53,976
- But I'm supposed to help

712
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:55,944
set up for the
dance after school.

713
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,179
- Without a pass from the nurse,

714
00:56:57,181 --> 00:57:01,183
you won't even be
allowed into the dance.

715
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:02,618
School policy.

716
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:07,156
(cellphone alert beeping)

717
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:09,124
- Did you steal
those from the gym?

718
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,526
- I'll give them back.

719
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:12,961
- [Brunette Girl]
That's not the point.

720
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:14,530
- [Lyla] Drink plenty
of water to add weight

721
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,598
without adding calories.

722
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,438
- I can't believe
we're doing this.

723
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,639
- I find it quite
admirable, actually.

724
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:24,673
- [Brunette Girl] Olivia!

725
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:26,208
- What?

726
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,610
If I can't go to the dance,
we might as well help Belle.

727
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:29,845
- Why can't you go to the dance?

728
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:31,547
- You failed math, didn't you?

729
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:33,048
- [Brunette Girl] Whatever.

730
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,950
Like, as soon as
this dance is over,

731
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,785
you have to eat something and

732
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,787
we'll get you help and
we'll tell someone.

733
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,489
- [Belle] No, I'm
fine, stay out of it.

734
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:42,624
- [Olivia] I don't think
that's an option anymore.

735
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:45,761
- Why don't you just
eat something now?

736
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,631
- Really, I'm okay,
and thank you.

737
00:57:52,203 --> 00:57:55,571
Okay, now give me
all of your change.

738
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:10,486
- [Nurse] Have a seat.

739
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,627
- Alright class.

740
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:21,897
I'd like to congratulate
a very special student

741
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:24,900
for getting into the
Columbia program.

742
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:27,603
I'd like to share that
Lyla has been accepted

743
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:28,837
and will be taking part

744
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,072
in this great
opportunity this summer.

745
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,607
So let's go ahead
and give her a hand.

746
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:34,610
(class applauding)

747
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:40,115
- Do I need to undress.

748
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:42,184
- [Nurse] Not necessary.

749
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,226
- So will I be able
to go to the dance?

750
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:54,663
(school bell ringing)

751
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:01,570
Hey Gus.

752
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:02,771
I'm sorry again.

753
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:06,909
Can we please go
together tonight?

754
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:08,745
Call me.

755
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:17,185
(cellphone alert beeping)

756
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:19,755
(Gus sighing)

757
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,363
- I can do your hair next.

758
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:05,000
- Nah, I think I'm just
gonna leave it alone.

759
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:11,106
- Since when do you smoke?

760
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,808
- Helps with nerves.

761
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,344
- [Lyla] What are
you nervous about?

762
01:00:15,346 --> 01:00:17,312
- And it doesn't
make me that hungry.

763
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:18,747
- There we go.

764
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:41,169
Is that from the
Columbia program?

765
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,374
I thought you didn't apply.

766
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:46,376
- I didn't.

767
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,016
- Did you get in?

768
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:01,991
Course.

769
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,860
What do you think?

770
01:01:08,732 --> 01:01:10,365
- Looks great.

771
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:13,168
- Try yours on so
we can compare.

772
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:36,158
- I can't wear this.

773
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,426
- [Lyla] Why not?

774
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:40,362
- I don't like it anymore.

775
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:42,798
I think I'm just gonna
wear something else.

776
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,467
- You spent all your
allowance on that dress.

777
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,402
Isn't that why you've been
practically starving yourself?

778
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:48,837
- What?

779
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:49,805
No.

780
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:51,073
I mean, yeah, I used the money,

781
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,742
but I didn't do it for a dress.

782
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:56,713
- Then why?

783
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:58,780
For Gus?

784
01:01:58,782 --> 01:01:59,782
- For me.

785
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:01,818
- Oh.

786
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:06,722
Well, just throw a
jacket on over it.

787
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:14,496
(dance music)
(students chatting)

788
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:12,487
♪ I wasn't counting
on breaking your heart

789
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:18,160
♪ Now, I'm just counting on luck

790
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,828
- Belle, what are
you doing here?

791
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,296
- Why shouldn't I be?

792
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,098
- Do you have a note?

793
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:28,537
Where'd you get this?

794
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:30,338
- The nurse.

795
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,573
- Where's Gus?

796
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:34,910
- He couldn't come.

797
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:37,546
- Don't pull this shit
with me, I need the car.

798
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:39,080
- Hell no.

799
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:40,448
- Joey, I need the car.

800
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,917
Please, just give me the keys.

801
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:43,451
- Why, so you can see
your little girlfriend?

802
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:44,986
- Come on Joey.

803
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,391
- Do you still think
I can give my speech

804
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:53,461
to the class on behalf
of the executive council?

805
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:59,034
(upbeat rock music)

806
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,444
- [Gus] Hey, where's Belle?

807
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:44,279
- Why don't you just
leave her alone already?

808
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:45,547
- I need to talk to her,
do you know where she is?

809
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,115
- Maybe, maybe not.

810
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:48,450
- You know, you're
unbelievable. You know that?

811
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:49,885
- You love it.

812
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,628
- Hello, and welcome
to our school dance.

813
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,675
I had a fantastic year
with you all here.

814
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,977
There have been
many great moments,

815
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:17,612
like the time when...

816
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:23,952
(Belle sighing)

817
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:27,422
- Alright, everybody settle
down for just a second.

818
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,456
We'll continue.

819
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,158
For now, oh,

820
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,361
I'd like to thank Dear Luna
for so graciously being here,

821
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:34,996
so let's go ahead
and give them a hand.

822
01:05:34,998 --> 01:05:37,999
(crowd applauding)

823
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:39,267
Thank you, gentleman.

824
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,435
- I'm gonna talk, I have
a speech and everything.

825
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,636
- But Mr. Davy
said I could do it.

826
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:43,505
- It's okay, I can
do it. I'm fine.

827
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:45,240
- I know, but you haven't
been here for the meetings.

828
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:46,374
I spent weeks on this.

829
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,409
- I know, but I have to do it.

830
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:48,376
- Why? Nobody even cares.

831
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:49,411
- I care.

832
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:51,246
- Well, so do I.

833
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:52,480
- Since when?

834
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:53,281
- Since you fell off
the face of the earth

835
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,215
and I took your place.

836
01:05:54,217 --> 01:05:56,851
- Now, I'd like to welcome up

837
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,486
your freshman class
president to say a few words.

838
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:02,457
(crowd applauding)

839
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:05,593
- Maybe next election, Lyla.

840
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:10,498
- You know what? I'm so
done with this. You win.

841
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,568
Thinner is the winner.

842
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,306
- What?

843
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,374
- Ally?

844
01:06:19,376 --> 01:06:20,608
Yeah, it's me.

845
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:24,512
- What?

846
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:25,613
- I'm Ally.

847
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:32,020
Exactly.

848
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:34,155
You can starve yourself
until you're nothing.

849
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:37,559
It's all I ever wanted
you to be anyway.

850
01:06:44,134 --> 01:06:47,102
(crowd whispering)

851
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:10,725
- [VOICEOVER Of Belle]
I believe in control,

852
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:12,160
the only force mighty enough

853
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:15,663
to bring order in the
chaos that is my world.

854
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:19,267
I believe that
I'm the most vile,

855
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:22,804
worthless, and useless
person ever to have existed

856
01:07:22,806 --> 01:07:25,540
on this planet and that
I am totally unworthy

857
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,410
of anyone's time and attention.

858
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,715
I believe in oughts,
musts, and shoulds,

859
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:38,153
as unbreakable laws to
determine my daily behavior.

860
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:43,091
I believe in perfection
and strive to attain it.

861
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:46,161
I believe in salvation
through starvation.

862
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:48,530
I believe in calorie counters
as the inspired word of God

863
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:50,432
and memorize them accordingly.

864
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:52,067
I believe in bathroom
scales as an indicator

865
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:54,836
of my daily successes
and failures.

866
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,806
I believe in Hell,
'cause sometimes,

867
01:07:57,808 --> 01:07:59,607
I think I live in it.

868
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:04,412
I believe in a holy
black and white world.

869
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:08,249
The losing of weight,
recrimination for sins,

870
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:12,287
elongation of the body

871
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:16,591
and a life ever fasting.

872
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:20,462
(Belle screaming)

873
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:23,465
(photos ripping)

874
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:52,594
(Belle sobbing)

875
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,344
- Let's not tell mom about this.

876
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:48,416
- You still think
she might come back?

877
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:49,517
- Actually, no.

878
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:56,758
It's okay though.

879
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,732
Can I have my bag?

880
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:15,877
- You know, you gave
us all quite a scare.

881
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,519
- Belle, you know you're
not supposed to have that.

882
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:28,489
- I'm sorry, I just wanted
to see if it was still there.

883
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,525
- If what was still there?

884
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:34,529
- Nothing, never mind.

885
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:35,697
- Belle, you have
someone here to see you.

886
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:37,665
Are you up for visitors?

887
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:38,667
- Okay.

888
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:43,739
- Hi there.

889
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:47,475
- It's okay, Dad.

890
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:49,644
I'm fine for now, thanks.

891
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:02,457
- You're doing great, we just
don't wanna trigger a relapse.

892
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:06,861
- But she wouldn't go through
this again, would she?

893
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:07,863
- Most do.

894
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:13,868
- What do you want from me?

895
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:14,936
- I'm sorry.

896
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,606
I'm really sorry.

897
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,441
- You knew it was me.

898
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,445
You knew I was Ana.

899
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:30,585
You were the only
one who knew, and

900
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:32,553
you took advantage of it.

901
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:35,823
- Everyone's a little insecure.

902
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,759
I didn't know anyone took
it that seriously, Belle.

903
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:40,361
I never imagined you,
of all people, would.

904
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:42,530
- Then you did know, Lyla

905
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,868
and you pushed me even further.

906
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:53,641
- You didn't tell anyone
it was me, did you?

907
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:56,477
- Do you realize how many
people look up to you?

908
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:59,547
Do you realize how many
followers you have?

909
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:01,783
How many girls must
be doing crazy things

910
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:03,785
because what you told them?

911
01:12:03,787 --> 01:12:05,353
What you posted?

912
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:13,728
I mean, I don't think we
could ever be friends again.

913
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:20,702
- You're so lucky.

914
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:29,043
I could never be that skinny.

915
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:53,701
(cell phone alert beeping)

916
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:01,809
- [Belle's Dad]
Belle, dinner's ready!

917
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:34,776
- [Belle] Smells great, dad.

918
01:13:34,778 --> 01:13:35,778
- Hey.

919
01:13:37,781 --> 01:13:39,614
I hope you like it.

920
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,120
Swirl.

921
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,640
Not terrible?

922
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:29,630
- [Gus] Did you get
any of my messages?

923
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:33,034
- I didn't really
wanna speak to anyone.

924
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:37,506
- Figures.

925
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,676
So how you feeling?

926
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,080
- Better.

927
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,483
- That's good.

928
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:54,689
(girls whispering)

929
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:26,053
- Hey, Belle.

930
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,689
- Hey.

931
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:34,729
- I received a letter
from the writer's program.

932
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:38,165
You didn't have to apply for me.

933
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:39,167
- I know,

934
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:44,539
but I also know how much
you really wanted it.

935
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:51,112
Sometimes, we tend to
get a little off-track

936
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:54,015
and that's when we could
use the help of others

937
01:15:54,017 --> 01:15:56,817
to straighten us out again.

938
01:15:56,819 --> 01:15:59,086
- I'm done being on the
track everyone thinks

939
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:01,055
I want to be on.

940
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,723
- No, I understand.

941
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:11,065
- I didn't get it.

942
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:21,008
- That's okay.

943
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:26,281
- I know.

944
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:31,285
(slow solemn music)

945
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:42,630
- [VOICEOVER Of Belle]
For the longest time,

946
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:45,600
I've tried to be perfect
because I thought that

947
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:47,969
making even one
little mistake meant

948
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:51,138
disappointing the
people who love me.

949
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,877
But the people who love you
will accept your B pluses

950
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:58,713
and rejection letters

951
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:02,650
just as much as your
presidential victories.

952
01:17:10,393 --> 01:17:12,159
I guess, at the end of the day,

953
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:15,763
I can't really say
who my role model is.

954
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:21,035
Even the people we look up
to most, believe in most,

955
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:23,104
disappoint us sometimes.

956
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:28,843
But that's okay,
because I know my worth

957
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:30,945
isn't measured by numbers,

958
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:34,682
numbers of friends,
votes, likes, or pounds.

959
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:42,923
If we think that way, when
will smart be smart enough?

960
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:45,826
When will skinny
be skinny enough?

961
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:54,702
Sometimes, you
have to be reminded

962
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:58,372
to turn around and see
how far you've come.

963
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:18,192
I'm Belle, I'm in recovery,
I'm worth something.

964
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:22,864
We all are.
