1
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,395
Brewskis!

2
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,216
Sandy! Hey!

3
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,843
Hi, how are you?

4
00:00:57,934 --> 00:00:59,677
I want you to meet Miranda.

5
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,892
- Muriel.
- Hi.

6
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,604
Have you seen Dean around?

7
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,647
He's just running on Dean Standard Time.

8
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,441
Nice car.

9
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,403
Don't screw with the car.

10
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,741
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,667
I never forget a face. Got that?

12
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,241
Got it.

13
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,499
Get this!

14
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,102
Where have you been?

15
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:52,985
I was having a little heart-to-heart
with the coach.

16
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,610
But I was thinking only of you.

17
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,200
You'd better have been.

18
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,630
You'll have to do something
about that car, Laird.

19
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,127
- It drives.
- It's driving the property values down.

20
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,096
Remember, we have an image to maintain
at Stonewood High.

21
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:05,309
Don't worry, Collins,
I've been buying my lottery tickets.

22
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:08,146
When I accepted the principalship
of Stonewood High

23
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,315
I accepted the burden
of maintaining standards here.

24
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,647
We are educators here, Freeman.

25
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:18,272
Miss Gallant and I have been seeing
each other for eight months.

26
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,481
I see.

27
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:22,233
Well, either she goes, or you do.

28
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,654
Jesus! Gimme a break!

29
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:28,366
I guess Stonewood could use
a new head of the Math department.

30
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,785
Goodbye, Mr. Freeman. You're fired.

31
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,705
Screw you, Singleton.

32
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:40,006
Complimentary angles,

33
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,963
they're like partners in a dance.

34
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,934
If you know one, the other one follows.

35
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,185
But without both, you have nothing.

36
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,186
Together, you have what?

37
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,899
- Egghead.
- A right angle.

38
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,986
Right. The most useful angle
in trigonometry.

39
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,064
Does everyone understand?

40
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,108
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,866
Good. Glad you're so excited about it.

42
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:10,167
Remembering that,
you get the key equation,

43
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,252
the basis of all measurements,
all navigation.

44
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,874
- Without the right angle...
- Those buns!

45
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,088
...Columbus would've
never discovered America

46
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,627
and the astronauts
would have never landed on the moon.

47
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,343
Okay.

48
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:28,139
How about the difference between

49
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:31,561
an adjacent and a nonadjacent
complimentary angle?

50
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,682
- Yes, Sandy.
- Here she goes again.

51
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:41,903
I was wondering how you would feel
about a teacher posing for a calendar?

52
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,192
I mean, if it was for a good cause.

53
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:51,576
Posing for calendars has no relevance
to what we're doing in class today.

54
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,459
Please pay attention.

55
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:54,791
I am.

56
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,830
See you.

57
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,220
So, Miss Farnsworth, the English...
Welcome, weary warrior.

58
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,806
Accent on the weary.

59
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:14,434
Don't let the little bastards get you down.

60
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,184
Thanks, Farnsworth.

61
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,854
It's not the little bastards
you have to worry about.

62
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:24,070
Singleton has invited Freeman
to depart these honored halls

63
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,529
for cause.

64
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:34,368
Kevin, can you make sure
Rudy's doing his homework?

65
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,585
The race is on!
Heading down the back stretch!

66
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:41,129
It's Rudy! It's Dad!
They're over the whoopdedoos!

67
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:44,467
But wait, Rudy's got mud in his eye!
He can't see. He's gonna crash. Look out!

68
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:48,765
Hey, guys, what's going on
in there? Is Rudy doing his homework?

69
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:51,513
Okay, Mom!

70
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,516
All right.

71
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,847
Back to the books, Hot Rod!

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,158
- He settled down?
- Yes. Have you?

73
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,443
You off?

74
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,949
Mmm-hmm.

75
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,119
Okay.

76
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,542
Just remember,
you have a family to support.

77
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:19,125
How could I forget?

78
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:23,750
- Bye.
- I'll see you later.

79
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,430
Yes, I know he's handsome.

80
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,887
No, you cannot talk to Dean.
He is my date.

81
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,139
No, really,
he's getting me some ice cream.

82
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:41,397
What kind?

83
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:43,063
Chocolate fudge.

84
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,231
Oh, my God! You have such control.

85
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:50,613
What about Dean?
Is he fooling around again?

86
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:54,577
No, things are great.
We're going to the springs this weekend.

87
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,374
Wait just a second.

88
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,753
He's talking to some ditz.

89
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,839
Doesn't he know my ice cream is melting?

90
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,769
- Who is it?
- Well, I don't know her, so...

91
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,309
- Details.
- What kind of details?

92
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,273
On a scale of 10.

93
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:22,484
Looks, four.

94
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:26,271
Breasts, nine.

95
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:30,777
Purse, bargain basement, definitely.
I can't see her tush, so don't ask.

96
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,203
Wait just a second.
She's giving him her phone number.

97
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,201
How can he do that?

98
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:43,833
I've got to go.

99
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,301
Okay. Here you go.

100
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,645
So, who's the girl?

101
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:01,561
What?

102
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,061
Oh, oh, oh.

103
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:07,153
Nobody.

104
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,573
Well, she's somebody.

105
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:13,609
I went to grade school with her.

106
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,324
Nobody is somebody
you went to grade school with?

107
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,494
Yeah.

108
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:22,575
Now, this is dripping everywhere!

109
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,378
- Want me to get you another one?
- I don't want another one!

110
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:29,550
How many times am I gonna put up
with your fooling around?

111
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:32,553
- No. You know what it is?
- Yeah!

112
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,050
- It's you!
- It's you!

113
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,474
- It's you, Sandy. Would you shut up?
- No! You shut up!

114
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:44,189
- Would you get back in the car, please?
- Not if you had the last Ferrari on earth.

115
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,184
I'm not gonna go chasing...

116
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:47,736
Look at this!

117
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,368
Sandy!

118
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:01,832
Hi. There's this new wild dance club
called No Man's Land. You wanna come?

119
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:07,585
Yeah.

120
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,340
Sandy!

121
00:09:16,683 --> 00:09:19,174
Sandy, meet the Low Rider Brothers.

122
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,973
This is Jose Uno and Jose Dos!

123
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,806

00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:28,340
- You know him?
- That's my math teacher!

172
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:29,586
Oh!

173
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:32,261
- No.
- What?

174
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:37,145
- He's looking this way!
- But we just got here!

175
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:42,724
I told you you wouldn't find
any Beverly Hills people here.

176
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:06,045
All right! The old place is going good.
Hey, space!

177
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:11,553
Now, it's time to take the Galaxy trip.
You know the man and you know the place.

178
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,640
So, let's just pick it up and head for space.

179
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,939
Ramone, you gonna join us tonight?

180
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:29,239
You think you can dance your way
into my mind, too, man? You're crazy.

181
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,869
Jacket, Blade.

182
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,416
Thank you, Book.
- Have fun!

183
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:45,624
I got the goods.

184
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,527
Well,

185
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:16,411
let's do it.

186
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:21,156
The square of cosine theta plus

187
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:24,121
the square of sine theta,

188
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,714
equals one.

189
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:33,092
This establishes the relationships. Here,
the theta symbol stands for the angle.

190
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:34,971
Okay? Good.

191
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:38,721
Because remembering that,
we get the key equation.

192
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,602
It's simple.

193
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:44,606
And what do we know
about the symbol theta?

215
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:13,166
I'm sorry!

216
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,966
What is it, Mr. Laird?

217
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:20,005
Can you give us the proof
of the Law of Sines?

218
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:22,837
What?

219
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:27,638
What's with you today, Sandy?
The proof of the Law of Sines, please.

220
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:37,437
Saved by the bell.

221
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,282
Don't forget, Chapter 8, Page 43.

222
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:43,036
Do problems 8 through 20.

223
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:54,585
Hey, Kevin,
Principal Singleton wants to see you.

224
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:58,381
- Did he say why?
- I don't know. Could be your car.

225
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:01,336
Give it a rest, Collins.

226
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,505
Seriously, Kevin, beware.

227
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:05,555
The man has something on his mind.

228
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:10,431
Miss Taylor,
did Singleton want to see me?

229
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:13,059
- He's been expecting you.
- Thank you.

230
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:19,191
Come in.

231
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:25,572
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes, Mr. Laird. Please, sit down.

232
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:29,905
Your personnel file.

233
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,905
Yes, sir.

234
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:34,746
Not great

235
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:37,546
not bad, either.

236
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,880
I'll make this short. You heard we need
a new head for the math department.

237
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:44,429
Mr. Freeman's job.

238
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:47,219
Mr. Freeman has abdicated his position.

239
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,395
- I want you to fill in.
- I don't know, sir.

240
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:54,137
I feel like I'm wearing
a dead man's shoes here.

241
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:57,399
More money.
You could buy yourself a new car.

242
00:21:57,527 --> 00:22:00,481
- Yes, but, sir, you see...
- Don't thank me, Laird.

243
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:02,445
Just don't let me down.

244
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:04,573
I hate to be let down.

245
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:08,077
I'll try not to, sir.

246
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:22,790
Aren't we a little old
to be playing Miami Vice?

247
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:24,296
Why are you avoiding me?

248
00:22:24,387 --> 00:22:29,096
I'm giving you time to catch up on your
phone calls with Little Miss Drive-in.

249
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:33,717
- She's not in your class.
- That's very true. Nor are you.

250
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:37,269
Will you move your tricycle, little boy?

251
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:45,153
Rudy?

252
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:47,492
Still awake?

253
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:52,447
- Hey, champ!
- Hi.

254
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,949
How's that arithmetic coming?

255
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:57,035
Great, I just finished it.

256
00:22:57,128 --> 00:22:59,417
All right, I'm glad to hear it.

257
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,961
- I'll see you in the morning, okay?
- Yeah.

258
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,208
- Good night, buddy.
- Okay, good night.

259
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:05,333
Dad?

260
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,140
All the other dads stay home at night.
How come you always have to go out?

261
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,806
- I have a special job, Rudy.
- Then how come you dress like a greaser?

262
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:19,474
Where'd you hear that word, Rudy?

263
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:22,734
That's what they call
the Mexican kids at school.

264
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,943
Rudy, when I was your age

265
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:27,781
they used to call me a greaser.

266
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:30,868
- They called you a greaser?
- Yeah.

267
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:36,616
Let me show you something.
Remember I told you I was adopted?

268
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:38,916
Yeah, they chose you special.

269
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:41,797
That's right.

270
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:45,714
These are your grandparents.

271
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:49,551
That's my mother and father.

272
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:51,420
Mexicans?

273
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,469
They're from Mexico.

274
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:58,144
When they came to America,
they had a little boy.

275
00:23:58,314 --> 00:23:59,643
That's me.

276
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,648
My name was Carlos Gutierrez,
and people called me a greaser.

277
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:08,151
Jeez, Dad.

278
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,320
Jeez, Dad.

279
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:14,614
How about giving your dad a hug?
Come here.

280
00:24:24,883 --> 00:24:26,211
Get to bed!

281
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:30,466
- You need your beauty sleep! All right?
- Okay.

282
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:32,844
- See you in the morning, okay?
- Okay.

283
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:35,134
- Good night.
- Good night.

284
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,518
Good night!

285
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,601
I'll be home about midnight.

286
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:47,612
God, this family does so much together.

287
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:50,446
A quick supper, if we're lucky.

288
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:57,034
You knew what you were getting
when you bought the package.

289
00:24:57,498 --> 00:25:01,828
I thought I was getting this
wonderful, caring, selfless husband.

290
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:05,212
Now, I realize...

291
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:08,215
Linda, what is this?

292
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:13,717
- You know I have to be at the club.
- I think it's just an excuse!

293
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:17,847
To go down there and prove
you're still 18, still número uno!

294
00:25:18,353 --> 00:25:20,511
Well, you're not 18 anymore.

295
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:24,555
That's right, I'm 32 years old.
I love my wife and I love my son.

296
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:27,475
I'm doing something I need to do!

297
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:32,024
I thought you understood
how much this means to me.

298
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:33,737
I'm sorry.

299
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:38,113
You do what you have to do.

300
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:48,924
You're wonderful, you know that?
I know what you're going through.

301
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:55,387
I want you to keep an eye on Rudy tonight.
He might need you.

302
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:56,967
- Okay.
- See you.

303
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:16,612
- You're out of your mind!
Why, thank you.

304
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:19,778
Where did you get that thing?

305
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,537
Leslie, when you are going fishing,
you've got to have the right bait.

306
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:27,996
Sandy! Tall, dark, and handsome
is one thing.

307
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:30,960
Tall, dark, and handsome
and your math teacher is another!

308
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,834
Trust me, Leslie, all male species
have the same weaknesses.

309
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:36,419
Sure.

310
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:39,298
Face it, you're gone on him!

311
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:42,140
You better hope Dean doesn't find out.

312
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:44,898
Dean. After that stunt he pulled,

313
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:47,691
I don't even care.

314
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:50,812
You wouldn't be doing this
to get Dean jealous?

315
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:52,066
Me?

316
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,312
Leslie...

317
00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:58,322
- You obviously don't know me very well.
- I know you.

318
00:26:59,204 --> 00:27:00,911
So? How do I look?

319
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,488
Killer.

320
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,370
Dean!

321
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:15,759
This is gonna be so much fun!

322
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:18,087
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

323
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:24,059
- All right, don't open the door yet, okay?
- Okay!

324
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:31,189
Maria! No!
Just a minute.

325
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:38,282
Go. Coming!

326
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,028
- Leslie.
Go!

327
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,537
Coming!

328
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,336
Why, Dean, what are you doing here?

329
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:56,675
- How you doing, Leslie? Where's Sandy?
- Sandy who?

330
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:02,134
Don't do that to me, Leslie.
Don't play stupid. Her car's right there!

331
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:04,597
Shit!

332
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:07,261
Sandy! What did I do?

333
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:27,454
You don't need to go to school, babe.

334
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:30,827
What do you mean, Ramone?
It's a good thing what I'm doing, babe.

335
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,542
I love you just the way you are, baby.

336
00:28:37,594 --> 00:28:41,010
Hey! Look who decided
to come slumming again.

337
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:50,229
You know, Ramone,
if you lightened up a little

338
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:53,181
you'd be surprised how far you could go.

339
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:56,193
Like a coconut? Brown on the outside

340
00:28:56,863 --> 00:28:58,986
white on the inside, like you?

341
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:02,442
I'm not impressed
with your macho biker attitude, bro.

342
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:06,568
I think you're here for the girls, man.

343
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:09,036
And what'd you promise them, man?

344
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:12,872
A cycle? A job as a secretary?

345
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:14,208
What?

346
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:16,713
I promise them a chance!

347
00:29:18,718 --> 00:29:21,090
What could you promise them, tough guy?

348
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,879
A career flipping burgers
and washing cars their whole life?

349
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:28,309
You can just save that for the chicks, man.

350
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:39,107
I think I just lost a dance partner!

351
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:43,154
You wanna dance with me, Blade?

352
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:45,860
Sure, Pink Toes. Let's get it!

353
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,955
- You wanna dance, Ricochet?
- Come on!

00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:31,300
So, what's this little game
you're playing with me, Sandy?

402
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:34,887
I just want to have fun.
Why can't we have fun together?

403
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:41,017
Come on. Math class is over.

404
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:44,064
Then comes Biology.

405
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,237
And if you're lucky,

406
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:54,154
Anatomy.

407
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:56,912
School's out!

408
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:09,335
- Where's your car?
- I didn't bring it! I took a cab!

409
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:13,044
- All right, I'm taking you home!
- I don't want to go home!

410
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:24,059
Maybe she don't wanna go with you, man.

411
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:26,935
Stay out of this, Ramone.

412
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:29,564
Are you gonna try and stop me, Professor?

413
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,487
Come on, baby,
you wanna have a good time?

414
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:38,568
Yeah.

415
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:40,236
Sandy.

416
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:44,532
This is the '90s, man.
A chick's got a right to choose.

417
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:46,579
And she chooses me!

418
00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:50,129
You get back inside, Ramone,
before someone gets hurt.

419
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:56,803
Now, there you go again, man!
Ordering people around!

420
00:34:57,974 --> 00:35:01,343
Now, why don't you go back
to Wonder Bread Land, Blade!

421
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:05,228
You don't wanna do this, Ramone!
Get in there!

422
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,644
Okay, sucker.

423
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:13,405
Come on, man.

424
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,374
Come on, man!

425
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:37,168
I don't believe it, man! You're a homey!

426
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:41,511
Everybody comes from somewhere,
Ramone.

427
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,599
What happened here?

428
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,189
Nothing.

429
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:54,029
Nothing?

430
00:35:54,531 --> 00:35:55,859
Nothing.

431
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,622
Hey, where you going?

432
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:14,289
Get on!

433
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:18,878
Hope you know what you're doing.

434
00:38:15,171 --> 00:38:16,713
So, here you go.

435
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:20,206
Come on. The night's just starting.

436
00:38:20,301 --> 00:38:22,009
Not for you, Sandy.

437
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:26,046
Okay.

438
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:32,225
You've seen some things tonight, Sandy.

439
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:36,148
I hope I can trust you
to keep this between us.

440
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,065
There is nothing that I would like more.

441
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,866
Good night, Sandy.

442
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:12,594
What do you want, Dean?

443
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:15,811
Is it anybody that I know?

444
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:19,814
Blade.

445
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:27,148
All right, I come over here, okay,

446
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:32,614
to get things straight between us,
and you're out riding around with a biker?

447
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:35,496
And you're dressed like a slut.

448
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:41,253
Look, if you're trying to make me jealous,
you're doing a damned good job of it.

449
00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:46,721
Can we forget about all this? Please?

450
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:54,133
Let's take a jog down to the Drive-In.

451
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:57,852
We'll get a soda and we'll talk.

452
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:00,266
Maybe we could, you know...

453
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:02,309
Yeah.

454
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:04,904
Afterwards...

455
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:11,316
Shit! God damn it, Sandy.

456
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:23,082
- Come on, man.
- Yes.

457
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,589
Give it up, kid.

458
00:40:25,677 --> 00:40:27,835
Be cool, man. Let me do this, man.

459
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:30,385
Just be cool. Let me do this, man.

460
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:31,932
Check it out.

461
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,639
Galaxy High is now in session.

462
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,979
Take a book.

463
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:42,766
Tom Sawyer? Didn't he play
offensive tackle for the Raiders?

464
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:45,731
No man, that's the dude from Magnum P.I.

465
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:50,742
Blade. Can I keep this for a couple of days?

466
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:54,030
- It's supposed to be back by the morning.
- Please, just this once?

467
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:56,873
Come on, you know I got trouble
with that history stuff.

468
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,283
Okay. But I want it back
by the end of the week.

469
00:40:59,377 --> 00:41:02,746
- Guaranteed. Thanks...
- Take a seat.

470
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:05,460
I know you've been busy
with your English assignments.

471
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,337
- I thought you'd like this one.
- Beats that Shakespeare.

472
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:11,631
That definitely isn't
the English language I know.

473
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:16,308
- What are we doing in six weeks?
- Taking the GED.

474
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:19,929
- Taking the GED?
- Passing the GED.

475
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:22,265
Yeah. Which means what, Ricochet?

476
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:25,193
We all get our high...

477
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:26,566
Spit it out.

478
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:28,065
...school diplomas.

479
00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:32,319
Right. I'm working on a little surprise
for you, so we can take a practice test.

480
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,785
Yeah.

481
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:35,613
Anyway, where did we leave off last time?

482
00:41:35,705 --> 00:41:37,614
Rectangular coordinate systems.

483
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:39,747
Hey, keep it down.

484
00:41:40,293 --> 00:41:43,164
- I'm trying to play some pool here, man.
- Is that so?

485
00:41:43,254 --> 00:41:44,713
That's right.

486
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:51,088
Looks to me
like you're gonna lose your shot.

487
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:55,720
Damn.

488
00:41:58,061 --> 00:42:01,145
It's too bad you don't know
the rectangular coordinate system.

489
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:04,397
Yeah? So, you think with your degree
you can make this shot?

490
00:42:04,484 --> 00:42:08,778
It's a piece of cake. If you know
the rectangular coordinate system.

491
00:42:09,364 --> 00:42:11,606
Okay. Let's see you make it.

492
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,819
Got to set it up first.

493
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,659
See, first, I need to decide
which ball that I wanna hit.

494
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:22,744
What is this?
You hit the eight ball right here, man.

495
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:25,457
Where?
Right here, man? Or right here?

496
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,631
It's not good enough.

497
00:42:29,092 --> 00:42:31,761
You need to define it
in relation to something.

498
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:33,505
To what does it relate?

499
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,423
It's the cue ball.

500
00:42:37,475 --> 00:42:40,476
- It starts at the cue ball?
- I believe so.

501
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:42,845
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

502
00:42:44,357 --> 00:42:48,686
- How long is this stick?
- This stick? 60 inches.

503
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,150
60 inches.

504
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:57,194
The cue ball is halfway up the stick,
which means?

505
00:42:57,662 --> 00:42:59,204
It's 30 inches.

506
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:02,491
Come on. Take the shot.

507
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:06,332
Hey, chill out, man.
I'm dealing with a system here.

508
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:08,369
Yeah?

509
00:43:09,716 --> 00:43:13,760
Deal with this.
I bet you can't make the shot.

510
00:43:16,556 --> 00:43:19,047
- It's covered.
- Shoot, I wanna get a piece of this.

511
00:43:19,142 --> 00:43:21,431
- Drop your money in there.
- Me, too.

512
00:43:22,562 --> 00:43:24,970
Pick up my stakes there,
and hold them for me...

513
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:26,227
My pleasure.

514
00:43:26,316 --> 00:43:29,566
...while I try to decide
what direction this stick is.

515
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:34,738
Let's make this
the zero-degree direction, right here.

516
00:43:34,824 --> 00:43:35,903
Okay.

517
00:43:36,534 --> 00:43:39,369
But let's make this a three-cushion shot.

518
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:41,747
Okay. Covered.

519
00:43:41,915 --> 00:43:46,078
Vertex number one, vertex number two,
and vertex number three.

520
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:52,464
Wait a minute. I need to decide
which angle that I need to use.

521
00:43:53,384 --> 00:43:56,800
What the hell are you doing?
You know I don't allow gambling in here.

522
00:43:56,888 --> 00:43:59,461
Gambling? This is education.

523
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:04,592
Like, how to use
a protractor to measure angles

524
00:44:05,438 --> 00:44:06,849
by degrees.

525
00:44:13,196 --> 00:44:14,987
37 degrees.

526
00:44:16,074 --> 00:44:17,817
Gonna be tough.

527
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,787
44 degrees.

528
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:31,417
This is too damn good to pass up.

529
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:35,838
I got me a $100 bill here,
says you ain't gonna make it.

530
00:44:38,888 --> 00:44:41,593
Grab it quick, Book, before he backs out.

531
00:44:45,436 --> 00:44:46,895
Thanks, Book.

532
00:45:20,305 --> 00:45:23,259
And that is
a rectangular coordinate system.

533
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:29,682
Thank you, Book.

534
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:33,066
Thank you all.

535
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:35,812
Class dismissed.

536
00:45:38,781 --> 00:45:41,735
Damn. That dude walked off
with all our cash.

537
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:44,698
Blade!

538
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:50,662
Game ball.

539
00:46:21,658 --> 00:46:23,152
How'd it go?

540
00:46:25,036 --> 00:46:27,954
One of my students
from Stonewood showed up.

541
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:34,243
Singleton's not gonna like you
teaching down at the club.

542
00:46:34,337 --> 00:46:37,836
That's right. But I'll take care of that.

543
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:43,009
You got something
you wanna take care of with me?

544
00:46:45,974 --> 00:46:50,932
Did I ever show you my
rectangular coordinate system?

545
00:46:51,521 --> 00:46:54,012
I love it when you talk dirty to me.

546
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:10,532
And then he said
it was up to me if I told anyone.

547
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:14,534
- Broadcast news.
- You promised.

548
00:47:15,879 --> 00:47:17,955
You're squishing my octopus roll.

549
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:20,373
Okay. I said I wouldn't talk.

550
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:23,719
I just don't understand
why all men have to lie.

551
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:28,132
Pretending to be this straight teacher,
when he's really a Latin lover.

552
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:30,935
You should have seen the way...
What is it?

553
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:32,050
Sandy.

554
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:34,803
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

555
00:47:36,816 --> 00:47:38,725
- Alone.
- Don't mind me.

556
00:47:40,737 --> 00:47:42,112
All right.

557
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:45,775
Imagine meeting you here.

558
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:48,572
I'd like to see you in my classroom,
after school.

559
00:47:48,661 --> 00:47:49,942
Of course.

560
00:47:56,878 --> 00:47:59,795
Just follow the directions on your screens.

561
00:48:00,882 --> 00:48:05,793
And if you have any questions,
you can refer to Figure 4-2, on Page 39.

562
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:08,222
I'll be back in just a few minutes.

563
00:48:08,306 --> 00:48:10,797
Egghead, you can handle any problems
until I get back.

564
00:48:10,892 --> 00:48:13,976
- Yes, sir, Mr. Laird. Sure thing.
- Thank you.

565
00:48:18,316 --> 00:48:19,894
"Yes, sir, Mr. Laird. "

566
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:23,567
Egghead, if you tell me what to do,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

567
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:26,489
This is some boring shit.

568
00:48:26,574 --> 00:48:29,361
Computers are only as boring
as the people that use them.

569
00:48:29,452 --> 00:48:32,738
You better get over yourself.

570
00:48:33,248 --> 00:48:37,080
Excuse me, Egghead,
were you talking to me?

571
00:48:37,877 --> 00:48:40,629
Just out of curiosity,
were you talking to me?

572
00:48:40,713 --> 00:48:43,917
Like, check this out. Hit the function.

573
00:48:46,886 --> 00:48:48,262
Bust a move.

574
00:48:49,055 --> 00:48:51,807
- You could almost dance to that.
- Almost?

575
00:48:59,941 --> 00:49:01,435
Check this out.

576
00:50:14,974 --> 00:50:16,967
Yes, Superintendent?

577
00:50:19,479 --> 00:50:22,646
You have only one class
with improved test scores.

578
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:25,310
Oh, yes, Laird's class.

579
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:27,939
He's been promoted
to head of the Math department.

580
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:31,979
I want to know what this teacher's doing
that's different from the others.

581
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:33,866
Certainly, no problem.

582
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:37,486
I'll arrange a dinner with Laird at my club.

583
00:50:38,164 --> 00:50:41,996
I don't want to see how he eats.
I want to see how he teaches.

584
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:47,330
Yes, of course. Come with me.

585
00:50:56,891 --> 00:50:58,469
Singleton!

586
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:08,644
This is Laird's classroom.

587
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:14,189
Egghead!

588
00:51:24,544 --> 00:51:27,213
- Where is your super teacher?
- Where's Laird?

589
00:51:29,132 --> 00:51:31,208
I think he's in the bathroom.

590
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,316
This is interesting.
Where did you get this program?

591
00:51:55,408 --> 00:51:57,614
Mr. Laird designed it, sir.

592
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:05,323
- Laird.
- Principal Singleton.

593
00:52:07,045 --> 00:52:09,536
Superintendent Leland, Kevin Laird.

594
00:52:10,173 --> 00:52:11,632
Mr. Laird.

595
00:52:12,217 --> 00:52:14,458
Well, welcome, Superintendent.

596
00:52:14,886 --> 00:52:19,049
I guess, we'll have to be on our
special behavior today, class.

597
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:24,264
Nothing special required, Mr. Laird.

598
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:27,604
We're just interested in seeing
how you teach here.

599
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:32,644
Great. Class, why are we studying
double angle identities?

600
00:52:35,073 --> 00:52:37,908
Well, imagine, we finally get the big one.

601
00:52:38,117 --> 00:52:40,691
Stonewood High is hit. Result?

602
00:52:40,912 --> 00:52:43,284
A crack opens
down the middle of the classroom.

603
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:48,248
Make it Rodeo Drive, and Sandy is
trapped at Gucci's, which is now on fire.

604
00:52:48,336 --> 00:52:49,747
- Why me?
- Don't worry.

605
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,957
Dean's on his way to the rescue,
and all he has is a protractor.

606
00:52:53,049 --> 00:52:55,291
What are you gonna do?

607
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:57,678
- I'll build a bridge.
- Good.

608
00:52:57,762 --> 00:53:00,300
How long does the bridge have to be?

609
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:04,382
- I don't know.
- Use your protractor. And what else?

610
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:08,811
- Telephone pole?
- Excellent.

611
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,107
Now, what is the angle of the pole
to the street?

612
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,109
The angle?
The angle of the pole to the street.

613
00:53:16,906 --> 00:53:18,317
That'd be...

614
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,198
90!

615
00:53:23,246 --> 00:53:24,788
90 degrees.

616
00:53:24,873 --> 00:53:26,331
Exactly. Very good.

617
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:32,003
Tomorrow, we'll explore
how to derive an unknown solution

618
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:34,630
from a known angle.

619
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:40,630
Class dismissed.

620
00:53:44,434 --> 00:53:48,052
They actually stayed after the bell.
I don't believe it.

621
00:53:53,818 --> 00:53:56,736
- You wanted to talk to me?
- Yes, Sandy. Come in.

622
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:07,617
What about?

623
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:11,574
I need to explain something to you.

624
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,663
Should I be taking notes?

625
00:54:17,842 --> 00:54:21,840
You're not the first student
to ever have a crush on her teacher.

626
00:54:22,055 --> 00:54:26,847
It's not exactly the teacher
that I have a crush on.

627
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:30,935
That's actually what I want to
talk to you about.

628
00:54:31,022 --> 00:54:36,017
You see, you don't really know what it is
that I'm doing down there in that barrio.

629
00:54:36,945 --> 00:54:38,984
You don't give up, do you?

630
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:44,606
I guess I'm just spoiled.
I'm not used to being told "No. "

631
00:54:46,538 --> 00:54:48,329
I'm telling you now.

632
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:54,165
All right, tell me one other thing.
No teacher-student bullshit.

633
00:54:54,254 --> 00:54:55,368
Okay.

634
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,879
Do you find me attractive?

635
00:55:13,231 --> 00:55:15,437
Sandy, this is going nowhere.

636
00:55:17,777 --> 00:55:19,521
Wait just a second.

637
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,235
Hey, Senor Kevin.

638
00:55:24,993 --> 00:55:28,196
- You didn't forget about...
- No. I know. The usual.

639
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,639
Hi.

640
00:55:52,187 --> 00:55:53,218
Sandy!

641
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,061
What are you doing in my car?

642
00:55:56,149 --> 00:55:59,648
I just thought maybe you could take me
for another ride.

643
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:03,523
This isn't funny.
Are you trying to ruin my life?

644
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:07,154
- No.
- Then please, just get out of my car.

645
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:09,404
I don't want to get out of your car.

646
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:12,829
Get out of my car now,
or I'm gonna throw you out.

647
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:14,291
I'll scream.

648
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,708
- No, you wont.
- Try me.

649
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,421
Wait. What is it you want from me?

650
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:21,586
Blade,

651
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,714
and your body, the way you moved,

652
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,514
you were so sexy:

653
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:37,606
- Come on, nobody's here. We can...
- I'm a married man. Okay?

654
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:39,441
But you're perspiring.

655
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:43,654
I'm perspiring because it's hot in here.
I'm wearing a tie, and...

656
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:44,817
Uh-oh!

657
00:56:44,906 --> 00:56:45,985
Shit.

658
00:56:50,578 --> 00:56:52,618
Principal Singleton.

659
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:57,703
Superintendent Leland
was very impressed today.

660
00:56:57,961 --> 00:56:59,075
Yeah.

661
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,744
You must get really close to your students

662
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,413
to generate that kind of enthusiasm.

663
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:07,836
- No, not really, sir.
- No?

664
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:11,713
Don't be modest. You really had them
eating out of your hand.

665
00:57:15,562 --> 00:57:16,937
You all right?

666
00:57:18,439 --> 00:57:20,099
It's the cafeteria food.

667
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:23,856
- Yes, well, I won't keep you. Good night.
- Good night, sir.

668
00:57:26,364 --> 00:57:29,400
- That was fun, wasn't it?
- No, that's not fun.

669
00:57:30,034 --> 00:57:34,032
I've been very fair with you.
I want you out of my car, right now.

670
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:39,239
You know, I wish you would decide

My Galaxy program's about to get busted.

685

If this whole thing blows up in your face,

686
00:58:22,003 --> 00:58:24,541
you should know
you did something good for the kids.

687

Something better
than anyone's ever done before.

688

Got good news.

689
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:33,218
You know that bus you wanted?

690
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:34,962
I got it.

691
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:38,469
- You never let me down, do you?
- Be okay.

692
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:40,764
Thanks, buddy.

693
00:58:47,987 --> 00:58:51,937
Hello.
Sandy, it's Dean. How's it going?

694
00:58:52,825 --> 00:58:53,905
Fine.

695
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:57,116
I was just thinking to myself,

696
00:58:57,539 --> 00:59:02,331
I'm in my car and you're in your car.
I thought maybe we could get together.

697
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,125
- What do you say? Where are you?
- I'm headed east.

698
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:07,787
East?

699
00:59:08,842 --> 00:59:12,175
Well, I could join up with you later.
What do you say?

700
00:59:14,347 --> 00:59:17,514
You're gonna have to do
better than that. Goodbye.

701
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:21,017
Sandy! Sandy!

702
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:31,728
Hello.

703
00:59:31,823 --> 00:59:34,610
Leslie. It's Dean. How's it going?

704
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:35,815
Fine.

705
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:40,371
Yeah, I was thinking to myself here,
hey, I'm driving around in my car

706
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:44,532
and, you're at your house, I just broke
the whole thing off with Sandy.

707
00:59:44,627 --> 00:59:47,332
- I thought maybe we could get together.
- When?

708
01:00:18,077 --> 01:00:20,200
The least you can do is dance with me.

709
01:00:20,288 --> 01:00:23,787
The least you could do is
to stay out of my life, Sandy.

710
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:28,079
You wanna dance?

711
01:00:29,422 --> 01:00:30,537

There's plenty of fish in the sea.

742
01:03:20,468 --> 01:03:24,382
I don't know what happened.
I mean, we were getting along fine.

743
01:03:25,473 --> 01:03:27,300
Everything was smooth.

744
01:03:28,268 --> 01:03:32,431
That was until she got into that
weird club trip down in East LA.

745
01:03:33,648 --> 01:03:34,846
East LA?

746
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:38,734
She goes to this club there,
No Man's Land.

747
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:44,611
- But I'm not done yet.
- Get out of the car.

748
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:46,859
- How will I get home?
- Out!

749
01:03:51,749 --> 01:03:53,292
You dickhead.

750
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:11,389
Okay, hold it down.

751
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:14,386
Stick together and keep it quiet.

752
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:29,535
- Right on time.
- You ready for the second shift?

753
01:04:29,621 --> 01:04:31,779
- I don't see anybody.
- Thanks, amigo.

754
01:04:31,873 --> 01:04:33,284
My pleasure.

755
01:04:35,293 --> 01:04:37,332
Qué pasa, Uncle?

756
01:04:40,048 --> 01:04:41,625
You rotten kid.

757
01:04:57,398 --> 01:04:58,643
Come on.

758
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:02,569
Take a seat,

759
01:05:03,988 --> 01:05:05,233
quietly.

760
01:05:10,078 --> 01:05:11,192
Okay.

761
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:14,407
Tonight we're gonna take
a simulated GED exam.

762
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:18,408
Are you sure we're ready for this?

763
01:05:18,837 --> 01:05:21,707
I don't even know how to work
one of these things.

764
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:24,289
They're supposed to be idiot-proof.

765
01:05:25,385 --> 01:05:29,169
If I wasn't convinced that you're ready,
I wouldn't have brought you in here.

766
01:05:29,264 --> 01:05:32,549
These computers are your friends.
They work for you.

767
01:05:33,351 --> 01:05:34,976
Book, come here.

768
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:41,058
Pass these out, please.

769
01:05:42,777 --> 01:05:45,778
- And one more thing.
- What now, Blade?

770
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:53,613
Something I bought with the money
that you all bet against me, last night.

771
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,824
- Thanks, Blade.
- Check it out.

772
01:05:59,919 --> 01:06:01,248
"Galaxy High. "

773
01:06:04,632 --> 01:06:08,251
And when I tell you that
you're gonna pass your GED,

774
01:06:08,428 --> 01:06:10,136
you're gonna pass.

775
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:13,056
All of you.

776
01:06:22,984 --> 01:06:24,312
Nothing.

777
01:06:26,571 --> 01:06:29,488
- I smell Polo.
- There goes the neighborhood.

778
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:34,243
Nice wheels, man.

779
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:43,330
Keep your eye on the car. Here's $5.

780
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:44,827
$5?

781
01:06:44,923 --> 01:06:46,251
Five whole dollars.

782
01:06:46,341 --> 01:06:48,499
That's a whole $1.60 for me, right?

783
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:50,883
And $1.65 for me.

784
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:53,136
You get more than me? How come?

785
01:06:53,223 --> 01:06:54,847
What are you guys, comedians?

786
01:06:54,933 --> 01:06:56,475
Funny stuff.

787
01:06:56,601 --> 01:06:58,510
Just don't touch the car!

788
01:06:58,603 --> 01:07:00,430
'Cause I never forget a face.

789
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:01,850
Got it,

790
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:03,763
Paco?

791
01:07:05,485 --> 01:07:08,818
Yeah. We'll take real good care
of your car, man.

792
01:07:34,013 --> 01:07:35,211
Can I help you?

793
01:07:35,306 --> 01:07:37,976
It's all right, I'm just looking for a girl.

794
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:40,306
My girlfriend.

795
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:42,055
What's her name?

796
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:43,309
Sandy.

797
01:07:43,398 --> 01:07:44,856
She has short hair?

798
01:07:44,983 --> 01:07:47,189
Yes, she has short hair. Okay?

799
01:07:47,277 --> 01:07:49,150
Yeah? Well, she's gone.

800
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:52,195
Wait a second! You know another guy?

801
01:07:52,282 --> 01:07:54,607
A guy named Blade? Drives a bike?

802
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:59,279
Hey, visiting time's over, kid.
Your girlfriend ain't here.

803
01:08:00,707 --> 01:08:02,201
Thanks a lot, buddy!

804
01:08:08,923 --> 01:08:10,002
Hey!

805
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:13,425
You interested in Blade, man?

806
01:08:15,138 --> 01:08:17,095
You interested in Blade?

807
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:19,804
Maybe.

808
01:08:19,893 --> 01:08:22,977
He just took this cute,
fine piece to Stonewood, bro.

809
01:08:24,063 --> 01:08:26,222
- Stonewood High School?
- Yeah!

810
01:08:26,441 --> 01:08:27,769
- You sure?
- Yeah!

811
01:08:30,486 --> 01:08:32,609
- Thanks.
- Cool!

812
01:08:33,907 --> 01:08:34,986
Cool.

813
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,443
Just trying to help.

814
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:47,248
"Don't

815
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:48,875

Eric? It's Dean!

819
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:08,644
Get Clay and the others and meet me
at the high school as soon as you can.

820

Look out for Sandy and Mr. Laird!

821
01:09:14,948 --> 01:09:16,857
Here's your dollar, vato.

822
01:09:20,078 --> 01:09:23,411
Hey, Uncle Big! I heard Ramone
telling that gringo where Blade is.

823
01:09:23,498 --> 01:09:24,577
What?

824
01:09:29,629 --> 01:09:30,660
Ramone!

825
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,921
You need your butt kicked!

826
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:39,384
If you wanna screw up your life,
that's fine!

827
01:09:39,472 --> 01:09:42,224
But you start messing
with other's dreams, that sucks!

828
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:45,428
I see you studying on the side.
Who do you think you're kidding?

829
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,263
You're not a bad kid, Ramone.

830
01:09:47,355 --> 01:09:50,190
But you're not the brightest candle
on the cake!

831
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:52,979
Why do you think Blade tries
so hard with you?

832
01:09:54,237 --> 01:09:56,064
He thinks you got potential.

833
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:57,815
College potential.

834
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:02,363
He never said that.

835
01:10:02,662 --> 01:10:05,829
I don't even know why
he tries with your worthless ass.

836
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:08,868
Get the hell out of here!

837
01:10:11,212 --> 01:10:12,410
Get out!

838
01:10:13,506 --> 01:10:15,546
Make something of your life.

839
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:50,784
Right triangle, what is it?

840
01:10:53,588 --> 01:10:55,082
What do you think, Double J?

841
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:57,746
Don't you think this is a waste, man?

842
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:01,553
It's only a waste if you don't try.

843
01:11:01,804 --> 01:11:04,260
If you don't,
it'll be the same old mopping floors.

844
01:11:04,349 --> 01:11:08,892
And burning yourself on a French-fry
machine for the next 50 years.

845
01:11:09,562 --> 01:11:11,021
That's right.

846
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,648
Look, if you screw up

847
01:11:14,526 --> 01:11:16,648
you just go back to the basics,

848
01:11:16,736 --> 01:11:18,942
the old pass, dribble, shoot!

849
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:20,941
Right triangle, what is it?

850
01:11:21,032 --> 01:11:22,574
Any triangle
with a right angle.

851
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:23,773
Which is?

852
01:11:23,868 --> 01:11:25,695
Ninety degrees, homey!

853
01:11:25,912 --> 01:11:28,450
Right! Which means?

854
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,912
The other two angles
add up to 90 degrees.

855
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,159
Hey, look!

856
01:11:38,299 --> 01:11:40,458
Hey, look. There's that girl.

857
01:11:40,552 --> 01:11:42,129
Uh-oh.

858
01:11:55,483 --> 01:11:57,523
Would you like to join us?

859
01:12:20,967 --> 01:12:22,592
So where were we?

860
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:26,387
The other two angles
add up to 90 degrees.

861
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:28,805
Right! Which means what?

862
01:12:29,017 --> 01:12:30,511
Acute angles.

863
01:12:31,186 --> 01:12:34,222
Acute angles,
right triangle, sine, cosine,

864
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:36,606
what are all of these?

865
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:37,806
Tools.

866
01:12:37,901 --> 01:12:39,229
To do what?

867
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:40,856
Build a bridge.

868
01:12:41,696 --> 01:12:43,439
Go to the moon!

869
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:44,813
All right!

870
01:13:05,929 --> 01:13:07,921
Let's go to school, boys!

871
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:22,940
It's just really amazing what you've done.

872
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:24,986
I'm glad you understand.

873
01:13:29,369 --> 01:13:30,400
Dean.

874
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:36,037
You wanna know what we think
of teachers that hit on their students?

875
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:37,406
Assholes...

876
01:13:40,797 --> 01:13:42,836
What do you want with him, Opie?

877
01:13:43,091 --> 01:13:44,419
When you can have me?

878
01:13:44,509 --> 01:13:47,130
He's not worth it.

879
01:13:58,439 --> 01:14:00,313
Come on, mother.

880
01:14:04,821 --> 01:14:06,813
All right!
Come on man!

881
01:14:06,906 --> 01:14:08,104
Come on, man!

882
01:14:24,924 --> 01:14:26,549
You broke my nail!

883
01:14:40,398 --> 01:14:41,643
Get off me.

884
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:45,896
Let's get them!

885
01:14:49,782 --> 01:14:51,277
Mom!

886
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,574
They make them so cheap these days.

887
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,120
I didn't know you know that move, man!

888
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:17,423
Theft of school property.

889
01:15:17,519 --> 01:15:19,641
Gang war on the front lawn.

890
01:15:20,271 --> 01:15:22,394
Possible relations with a minor.

891
01:15:22,482 --> 01:15:26,182
And worst of all,
all of it on the 11:00 news!

892
01:15:27,987 --> 01:15:29,897
You have my resignation.

893
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:31,567
Resignation?

894
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:33,693
You're fired.

895
01:15:43,586 --> 01:15:45,662
Well, old fellow,

896
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:49,252
when you let yourself care too much

897
01:15:49,384 --> 01:15:51,127
they always get you.

898
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:53,379
They got me.

899
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,215
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

900
01:15:58,726 --> 01:16:01,300
This used to be a really fine school

901
01:16:01,729 --> 01:16:03,354
thirty years ago.

902
01:16:04,858 --> 01:16:06,897
Take care of yourself, boyo.

903
01:16:06,985 --> 01:16:08,395
You too, Farnsworth.

904
01:16:08,486 --> 01:16:10,894
- You were one of the good ones.
- Thanks.

905
01:16:14,993 --> 01:16:17,566
So watch those nice buns of yours, Laird.

906
01:16:18,413 --> 01:16:20,655
Farnsworth, I didn't know you cared.

907
01:16:24,627 --> 01:16:27,498
I guess we'll just pick it up
at the sines and the cosines.

908
01:16:27,589 --> 01:16:30,543
If you'll turn to Page 52, please.

909
01:16:35,096 --> 01:16:37,219
- Mr. Collins?
- You're late.

910
01:16:37,473 --> 01:16:39,715
I'm here to talk to the class.

911
01:16:40,185 --> 01:16:42,722
I have a petition to bring back Mr. Laird.

912
01:16:42,812 --> 01:16:45,101
Oh, my God! You've gotta be kidding.

913
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,648
- Miss Thomas.
- Listen.

914
01:16:48,568 --> 01:16:52,779
There's been a big misunderstanding here,
and I was a large part of that.

915
01:16:52,864 --> 01:16:56,067
And, Mr. Laird, he was just trying

916
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,780
to teach some kids that needed a break.

917
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:01,325
And I think that we're all just
a little spoiled

918
01:17:01,414 --> 01:17:04,450
and we don't realize that
there are people who need help.

919
01:17:04,542 --> 01:17:07,745
Very touching. If you want
to save the world, do it on your time.

920
01:17:07,837 --> 01:17:09,996
If you don't mind,
I'm teaching a class here.

921
01:17:10,089 --> 01:17:12,415
Please take a seat, Miss Thomas.

922
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:14,964
Take a seat.

923
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:26,807
Miss Thomas...

924
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:41,818
I blew it.

925
01:17:42,705 --> 01:17:44,912
Must be great being a hero

926
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,872
but it doesn't exactly pay the rent.

927
01:17:50,505 --> 01:17:53,956
Right now, we're looking at about
$114 in the bank.

928
01:17:55,343 --> 01:17:57,501
It doesn't tide us over.

929
01:18:00,515 --> 01:18:02,139
I'm sorry, Linda.

930
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:06,599
When I look at those beautiful kids

931
01:18:10,233 --> 01:18:12,806
I remember what it was like in the barrio.

932
01:18:13,361 --> 01:18:15,686
On the outside, always looking in.

933
01:18:18,032 --> 01:18:19,776
It'll be all right.

934
01:18:21,202 --> 01:18:22,696
You're my hero.

935
01:18:36,426 --> 01:18:38,050
They fired Kevin.

936
01:18:38,553 --> 01:18:41,637
Yeah, I figured something
like that'd happen.

937
01:18:43,391 --> 01:18:46,226
We've got to make
them give him his job back.

938
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:47,853
How're you gonna do that?

939
01:18:47,937 --> 01:18:50,891
- He's got to have friends.
- Sure, he's got friends.

940
01:18:51,065 --> 01:18:54,316
Honey, Kevin's got more friends
than he knows about.

941
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:35,273
It's hit the fan this time.

942
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,770
Under control.

943
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:38,818
You call this "under control"?

944
01:19:38,905 --> 01:19:40,696
I've already fired Laird.

945
01:19:40,782 --> 01:19:43,451
Laird, your best teacher?

946
01:19:45,703 --> 01:19:48,704
I think it's going to be time
to face the music.

947
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:15,810
Wait a minute!

948
01:20:16,985 --> 01:20:18,313
You can't come in here.

949
01:20:18,403 --> 01:20:22,270
- What the hell is going on here?
- I'm sorry, I couldn't stop them.

950
01:20:22,365 --> 01:20:23,693
Just listen to us.

951
01:20:23,783 --> 01:20:25,325
Absolutely not.

952
01:20:25,493 --> 01:20:26,572
Excuse me.

953
01:20:28,204 --> 01:20:29,912
What do you want to talk about?

954
01:20:29,998 --> 01:20:33,580
- We're here to talk about Mr. Laird.
- Yeah, Blade.

955
01:20:33,668 --> 01:20:36,206
You can just as well talk to the police.

956
01:20:36,921 --> 01:20:38,914
Hold on there, Singleton.

957
01:20:39,632 --> 01:20:41,625
They've come all this way.

958
01:20:42,218 --> 01:20:45,089
- Let's hear them out.
- I think that would be a big mistake.

959
01:20:51,561 --> 01:20:54,681
What would you like to tell us?
And what is this

960
01:20:55,523 --> 01:20:57,397
"Laird, Blade" business?

961
01:20:57,483 --> 01:20:59,725
It's a nickname, for God's sake!

962
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:03,022
So, Mr. Laird is Blade?

963
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:04,692
Yeah, that's right.

964
01:21:05,074 --> 01:21:07,862
Blade, he got these kids learning again!

965
01:21:08,328 --> 01:21:11,613
He opened up Galaxy High,
and he made it the place to be!

966
01:21:11,706 --> 01:21:14,114
Oh, nothing but bull... Manure.

967
01:21:15,627 --> 01:21:17,584
You have to admit,
it's a pretty big stretch.

968
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:20,208
See? They don't believe nothing, man.

969
01:21:21,257 --> 01:21:23,927
If you don't believe it,
why don't you test them?

970
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:26,881
Why don't you just let them prove
that's what he was doing?

971
01:21:26,971 --> 01:21:29,379
We don't have to prove anything.

972
01:21:29,474 --> 01:21:30,553
Why not?

973
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:35,227
Why don't you put these kids up against
those snotty Stonewood students?

974
01:21:35,563 --> 01:21:37,057
Make it a contest.

975
01:21:38,066 --> 01:21:39,145
Are you scared?

976
01:21:39,234 --> 01:21:41,985
We don't want to humiliate your kids.

977
01:21:45,698 --> 01:21:46,896
Try us.

978
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,898
I like it.

979
01:21:49,536 --> 01:21:51,575
- On one condition.
- Name it.

980
01:21:51,913 --> 01:21:53,491
A Superquiz

981
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:57,742
with exactly the same kids
who fought last night.

982
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:00,246
Only this time,

983
01:22:00,672 --> 01:22:03,423
we'll have them duke it out
with their brains.

984
01:22:03,967 --> 01:22:06,173
Laird is a math teacher.

985
01:22:06,261 --> 01:22:09,297
Why not let him prove himself
in his own field?

986
01:22:09,764 --> 01:22:10,927
Great!

987
01:22:11,599 --> 01:22:13,971
And the wonderful thing is, Singleton,

988
01:22:14,477 --> 01:22:18,012
you'll be proving that Mr. Laird's
methods don't work.

989
01:22:19,482 --> 01:22:21,024
Because if they do,

990
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,477
he has his job back.

991
01:22:59,647 --> 01:23:01,936
May I have your attention, please.

992
01:23:02,025 --> 01:23:06,402
I would like to welcome you to this
special Stonewood High Superquiz.

993
01:23:12,202 --> 01:23:14,443
Let's try and keep it down.

994
01:23:14,537 --> 01:23:19,116
I would also like to introduce
the chief executive of our school system,

995
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:21,202
Superintendent Leland.

996
01:23:22,629 --> 01:23:25,333
We need to come up with something
to get them psyched.

997
01:23:25,423 --> 01:23:27,380
Let's do a chant!
Like, Stonewood, Stonewood.

998
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:30,040
- Stonewood. Stonewood...
- Rocks.

999
01:23:30,136 --> 01:23:31,215
Rocks!

1000
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,349
May we have the contestants
on stage, please.

1001
01:23:37,685 --> 01:23:39,180
So, anyway...

1002
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:41,844
Let's kick some butt! Come on, let's go.

1003
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,018
Show them who's boss!

1004
01:24:12,762 --> 01:24:15,218
Now, then, the rules are quite simple.

1005
01:24:15,306 --> 01:24:18,889
The Superquiz format
used by the Academic Decathlon.

1006
01:24:19,185 --> 01:24:20,845
Two contestants per question.

1007
01:24:20,937 --> 01:24:23,854
Point goes to the first team
that answers correctly.

1008
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,775
And the first team
to reach eight points, wins.

1009
01:24:27,068 --> 01:24:30,022
May I have
the first two contestants, please?

1010
01:24:36,995 --> 01:24:39,367
Fagan, get up there.

1011
01:24:39,455 --> 01:24:41,365
All right, Fagan.

1012
01:24:46,087 --> 01:24:48,412
So what do you wanna know?

1013
01:24:49,507 --> 01:24:51,049
First question.

1014
01:24:51,384 --> 01:24:53,341
You plotted the position of a star

1015
01:24:53,428 --> 01:24:57,378
in relation to the background stars
six months ago, and again last night.

1016
01:24:57,473 --> 01:25:01,720
The angle of shift of the star's
position is eight-tenths of a second.

1017
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:06,059
How would you determine the distance
of this star from the Earth?

1018
01:25:07,066 --> 01:25:08,976
Galaxy High. Go ahead.

1019
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:12,278
With a big tape measure.

1020
01:25:19,329 --> 01:25:20,408
Geek!

1021
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:21,945
Okay!

1022
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:26,417
If I couldn't find no tape measure, I guess
I'd have to use the trigonometric parallax.

1023
01:25:26,503 --> 01:25:29,076
I'd start with a right triangle formed
by the sun,

1024
01:25:29,172 --> 01:25:31,663
the stars,
and the position of the Earth last night.

1025
01:25:31,758 --> 01:25:34,675
My angle of interest is
0.4 seconds, and the far side

1026
01:25:34,761 --> 01:25:37,252
is the distance from the Earth to the sun,
or one astronomical unit.

1027
01:25:37,347 --> 01:25:41,558
The near side is the distance
from our solar system to the star.

1028
01:25:41,643 --> 01:25:45,094
You measure the ratio, far side over
near side, for a right triangle

1029
01:25:45,188 --> 01:25:47,346
when the angle of interest is 0.4 seconds.

1030
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:48,982
Something like that.

1031
01:25:52,445 --> 01:25:53,476
Yes.

1032
01:25:55,156 --> 01:25:56,485
Correct.

1033
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:08,870
Point, Galaxy High.

1034
01:26:09,003 --> 01:26:12,004
Man, they're trying to burn us
with tough ones.

1035
01:26:13,174 --> 01:26:14,419
Next pair.

1036
01:26:14,509 --> 01:26:16,585
Who do you wanna go?
You wanna go next?

1037
01:26:16,678 --> 01:26:17,923
You're going.

1038
01:26:25,895 --> 01:26:28,433
- You need a vacation, big guy.
- Yeah, yourself.

1039
01:26:28,523 --> 01:26:30,397
Your shoes are untied.

1040
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,349
Thanks.

1041
01:26:34,237 --> 01:26:37,024
Describe the Cartesian
Coordinate System.

1042
01:26:37,115 --> 01:26:39,688
Wait a minute. Hold up!

1043
01:26:41,578 --> 01:26:43,072
Go ahead, Rod.

1044
01:26:44,956 --> 01:26:48,621
It's a system where points
on a plane are identified

1045
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:51,461
by pairs of numbers
that represent distances

1046
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:53,914
from two perpendicular lines.

1047
01:26:54,007 --> 01:26:55,834
Point, Stonewood High.

1048
01:27:00,972 --> 01:27:03,380
- They cheated!
- Stonewood rocks!

1049
01:27:19,157 --> 01:27:22,360
Come on, let's hurry up
and get this shit out of here.

1050
01:27:30,084 --> 01:27:32,373
If point number one
on a map of Stonewood

1051
01:27:32,462 --> 01:27:34,704
is Fieldstone A venue at Taft Boulevard

1052
01:27:34,797 --> 01:27:38,665
and point number two
is Beverly Drive at Choate Boulevard

1053
01:27:38,843 --> 01:27:41,928
and point number three
forms an equilateral triangle,

1054
01:27:42,013 --> 01:27:43,804
where is that third point?

1055
01:27:44,516 --> 01:27:48,098
How do you expect these kids to know
Beverly Hills geography?

1056
01:27:48,478 --> 01:27:51,479
Mr. Laird, you are not involved
in this contest.

1057
01:27:51,564 --> 01:27:53,687
I must remind you to remain quiet.

1058
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:58,191
Clay?

1059
01:27:58,279 --> 01:28:00,817
Point number three
of the equilateral triangle

1060
01:28:00,907 --> 01:28:04,323
would be Stonewood High.

1061
01:28:06,913 --> 01:28:08,822
Correct.
Point, Stonewood High.

1062
01:28:13,586 --> 01:28:14,997
Come on, Eric.

1063
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:17,413
We trashed you before,
we'll trash you again.

1064
01:28:17,507 --> 01:28:19,583
- Come on!
- Yeah, right now!

1065
01:28:21,094 --> 01:28:23,715
Wait. Hold it!

1066
01:28:23,805 --> 01:28:25,429
- Please!
- Sit down!

1067
01:28:26,599 --> 01:28:29,517
You are disqualified, young man,
for ungentlemanly behavior!

1068
01:28:29,602 --> 01:28:31,013
Now, step down!

1069
01:28:31,604 --> 01:28:33,727
Point, Stonewood High.

1070
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:54,574
- Next.
- Randy, come on.

1071
01:28:57,547 --> 01:29:01,710
So, how about you and me get together
in the parking lot when this is over?

1072
01:29:08,725 --> 01:29:11,097
May we have the question, please?

1073
01:29:11,436 --> 01:29:13,428
The next question is,

1074
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:17,308
the abscissa of a point in a plane
is the distance

1075
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,357
of the point from the x-axis.

1076
01:29:19,444 --> 01:29:22,813
The ordinate is the distance of the
point from the y-axis.

1077
01:29:22,906 --> 01:29:26,820
Given an equation 2x plus 3y equals 12,

1078
01:29:27,035 --> 01:29:29,989
what are the coordinates of the solution?

1079
01:29:33,249 --> 01:29:35,491
You got the question wrong.

1080
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:41,714
Young lady, if you can't answer
the question, leave the microphone.

1081
01:29:42,175 --> 01:29:46,007
No, see, you reversed them.
The abscissa is the vertical line,

1082
01:29:46,221 --> 01:29:49,921
from the point in the plane
from the y-axis.

1083
01:29:50,433 --> 01:29:52,924
Anyway, it don't matter. The answer is

1084
01:29:53,228 --> 01:29:56,098
the abscissa of the point is - 3

1085
01:29:56,189 --> 01:29:58,146
and the ordinate is 6.

1086
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:04,608
Singleton,

1087
01:30:04,697 --> 01:30:05,895
she's right.

1088
01:30:07,325 --> 01:30:09,401
Correct. Point, Galaxy High.

1089
01:30:12,747 --> 01:30:15,748
She never raised her hand, man!

1090
01:30:26,594 --> 01:30:27,923
Tie score.

1091
01:30:28,513 --> 01:30:31,086
Remember that the first team
to reach eight, wins.

1092
01:30:31,182 --> 01:30:35,262
Which means that this next question
is the final deciding question.

1093
01:30:36,437 --> 01:30:37,552
Yeah!

1094
01:30:37,647 --> 01:30:38,927
Okay, I'll go.

1095
01:30:46,906 --> 01:30:49,528
I believe you are
the only team member left.

1096
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:54,203
Ramone, you got to do this.

1097
01:30:58,751 --> 01:31:00,744
Is this a forfeit? I think it is!

1098
01:31:00,837 --> 01:31:02,461
We win. Thank you.

1099
01:31:06,885 --> 01:31:09,257
Just a moment, please.

1100
01:31:09,345 --> 01:31:11,005
Is this a forfeit?

1101
01:31:27,614 --> 01:31:29,108
Last question.

1102
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,526
Describe for me
the rectangular coordinate system.

1103
01:31:54,974 --> 01:31:56,303
Galaxy High?

1104
01:32:02,482 --> 01:32:05,103
The rectangular coordinated system...

1105
01:32:05,276 --> 01:32:06,355
The what?

1106
01:32:08,446 --> 01:32:10,355
...or whatever you call it...

1107
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:14,074
Say you wanna hit the eight ball?

1108
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,571
What?

1109
01:32:15,662 --> 01:32:18,746
You wanna figure out where
the eight ball is on the pool table...

1110
01:32:18,831 --> 01:32:21,998
I fail to see what this has
to do with the question.

1111
01:32:22,836 --> 01:32:24,164
Go on, son.

1112
01:32:26,589 --> 01:32:28,878
The exact position of the eight ball

1113
01:32:28,967 --> 01:32:32,667
can be spotted if you measure
how far it is from the cue ball

1114
01:32:32,762 --> 01:32:35,087
which you can do with the cue stick.

1115
01:32:35,598 --> 01:32:40,225
But I don't have one,
so you have to pick a direction

1116
01:32:40,478 --> 01:32:43,147
straight to the right of the cue ball.

1117
01:32:45,483 --> 01:32:49,730
And that you call the zero direction,
the zero-degree direction.

1118
01:32:50,905 --> 01:32:54,654
And, you measure the angle
between the zero-degree direction

1119
01:32:55,994 --> 01:32:59,160
and the line from the cue ball
to the eight ball.

1120
01:33:00,164 --> 01:33:01,493
That's it!

1121
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:02,912
What's it?

1122
01:33:04,294 --> 01:33:06,701
The Rectangular Coordinate System.

1123
01:33:09,632 --> 01:33:12,633
I'm afraid I cannot consider
this a correct answer.

1124
01:33:16,764 --> 01:33:18,342
Singleton,

1125
01:33:20,435 --> 01:33:23,222
you'd better consider that
a correct answer!

1126
01:33:26,482 --> 01:33:29,020
The winner is Galaxy High.

1127
01:33:56,095 --> 01:33:57,127
Hey, hey, hey.

1128
01:33:58,014 --> 01:34:01,513
Blade, come on up. Give us a speech, man.

1129
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:27,535
Let them have it, bro.

1130
01:34:35,593 --> 01:34:37,467
You guys surprised me.

1131
01:34:39,973 --> 01:34:41,882
I'm really proud of you guys.

1132
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:56,191
I was born Carlos Gutierrez

1133
01:34:57,323 --> 01:34:58,521
in East LA.

1134
01:35:01,286 --> 01:35:03,859
And I fought my way all through life.

1135
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,909
When I was 14,

1136
01:35:09,961 --> 01:35:11,336
my parents died.

1137
01:35:13,256 --> 01:35:15,047
I dropped out of school

1138
01:35:18,178 --> 01:35:20,669
and then I was adopted
by my mom and dad.

1139
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,883
And I became Kevin Laird.

1140
01:35:25,226 --> 01:35:27,515
The guy you all know me as now.

1141
01:35:30,356 --> 01:35:32,812
Through a little of their encouragement,

1142
01:35:34,527 --> 01:35:36,852
they made me get an education

1143
01:35:39,157 --> 01:35:42,407
and that's what made
the difference in my life.

1144
01:35:43,369 --> 01:35:46,240
And whether I'm Laird or Gutierrez,

1145
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:49,825
I'm the same man

1146
01:35:52,504 --> 01:35:54,543
because of education.

1147
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:57,250
You have the desire,

1148
01:35:58,426 --> 01:36:00,253
the willingness to grow.

1149
01:36:02,347 --> 01:36:04,304
That's what's important.

1150
01:36:05,266 --> 01:36:07,425
It's not your name,

1151
01:36:08,561 --> 01:36:10,305
your accent

1152
01:36:11,064 --> 01:36:12,558
or your color.

1153
01:36:16,653 --> 01:36:20,235
And it's certainly not
the neighborhood that you live in.

1154
01:36:24,661 --> 01:36:26,570
'Cause we're all human.

1155
01:36:28,456 --> 01:36:30,579
I want you guys to remember that.

1156
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,744
And just for once,

1157
01:36:32,836 --> 01:36:35,623
I'd love to see my two worlds
come together.

1158
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:42,469
What do you say?

1159
01:36:53,273 --> 01:36:54,553
Let's do it.

1160
01:37:45,617 --> 01:37:47,325
