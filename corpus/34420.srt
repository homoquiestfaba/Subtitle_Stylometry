1
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,672
''I am.

2
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,477
Come into...

3
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,951
my garden.

4
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:41,190
My sister.

5
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,529
My spouse.

6
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,562
I have...

7
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,040
gathered...

8
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,505
my myrrh...

9
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,014
with...

10
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,675
my...

11
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,078
spice.

12
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,317
I have...

13
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,586
eaten...

14
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,464
my...

15
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,627
honeycomb...

16
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,607
with my...

17
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,843
honey.

18
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,338
I sleep...

19
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,174
but...

20
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,482
my heart...

21
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,349
weakens.

22
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,855
My beloved...

23
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,861
put in...

24
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,802
his hand...

25
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,864
by the hole...

26
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,968
of the...

27
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,445
door.

28
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,641
My sister.

29
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,043
My love.

30
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,049
My dove.

31
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,859
My beloved.

32
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,593
My--''

33
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,086
Though he were dead,
yet shall he live...

34
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,451
and whosoever liveth
and believeth in Me...

35
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,821
shall never die.

36
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:58,295
For as much as it has pleased
Almighty God of His great mercy...

37
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:03,358
to take unto Himself the soul
of our dear brother here departed...

38
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,905
we therefore commit his body
to the ground.

39
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:11,170
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

40
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,209
In certain hope of the resurrection
to eternal life.

41
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,696
Venus must have heard my plea

42
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,531
She has sent someone

43
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,697
Along for me

44
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,522
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

45
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,065
You should take it easy.
You're gonna be drunk.

46
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,043
I know. I wanna be drunk.

47
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,614
You're gonna get sick.

48
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,616
No, I won't.

49
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,822
Don't you think maybe you
should help your mother?

50
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,325
Yeah.

51
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,481
I'm all right, Nicky.

52
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,656
Is there anything I can do?

53
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,088
If you'll take...

54
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,427
some food through.

55
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,024
That lot should eat something before
the drink gets the better of them.

56
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,966
- I will, ta.
- Right.

57
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,974
He was a great bloke, your dad.

58
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,634
I know.

59
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,373
I didn't really know him,
but everybody says that he was just...

60
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,383
a nice guy.

61
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,390
- What are you drinkin'?
- I'm drinkin' wine.

62
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,391
Wine? You wanna move on
to the hard stuff.

63
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,393
- Hard stuff?
- Yeah. Whiskey.

64
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,868
This is the gear.
I'm tellin' ya.

65
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,830
- So what do you do, eh?
- I'm at school.

66
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:33,344
Jesus. Really? I would have
thought you were 22, 23.

67
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,716
Hey, have you ever
been in Tropicoco?

68
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,756
- No.
- Well, you know the Animals?

69
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,793
Chas Chandler. Have you heard of him? Me
and him are like this. I'm tellin' you.

70
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,523
- I can get us in anytime you want.
- Wow.

71
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,294
- We can go tonight, if you want.
- Ask me mum.

72
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:03,675
- Where'd you get the tie?
- This is from Carnaby Street.

73
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,886
Nicky, love.
Nic, come here.

74
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,087
Come in here.
Come on.

75
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,632
Now, this is Bob's mum, Grace.
This is Nic.

76
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,430
- Hello, Grace.
- Our Susan's boyfriend, you know?

77
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,438
- And Arthur, his dad.
- Hello, Bob. Nice to meet you.

78
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,269
He's a nice lad.

79
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,275
What do you do for a living, Bob?

80
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,809
- It's Nic, man.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

81
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,179
- Nick with an ''N.''
- With an ''N''? Ah.

82
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,809
Bob, what do you do for a living?

83
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,718
Um, nothing.

84
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,951
-He plays the guitar. Bob Dylan's songs.
-Badly.

85
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,654
- You gonna help us with the washin'?
- I was lookin' for Susan.

86
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,391
No. Stay and help us. Oh, look at him.
Look at him. Look at this!

87
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,229
Hey, June, come here.
Feel this.

88
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:12,441
Look how smooth!
Have you started shaving yet, son?

89
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,842
Aye.

90
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,849
Hey, I'm sorry, love.

91
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,942
- I'm gonna have some more.
- Susan.

92
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,611
- What about her?
- Where is she?

93
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,623
She's went to bed 'cause
she was drinking far too much...

94
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,626
on which,
I need another sherry.

95
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,629
I said, ''If you're sick--'' 'cause
she looked like she was gonna hoick...

96
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,291
on that new carpet,
''I'll rub your bloody nose in it.''

97
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,064
So I've sent her to bed and
she should be sleepin'. All right?

98
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,798
So if she is--

99
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,069
Grace, man, just lay off.

100
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,407
- So if she's sleepin', let her sleep.
- I will. Thanks.

101
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,071
Good night.

102
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,784
He'd kill me.
No. Look. Oh, look.

103
00:10:55,888 --> 00:11:00,291
Have you noticed the way he walks?
He must practice in the mirror.

104
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,673
Piss off, sunshine.

105
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,341
Jesus! Fuck!

106
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,686
Not on my fucking jacket!

107
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,316
Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.

108
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,624
Fuck! It's all over
my best shirt.

109
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,047
So, how was the meeting?

110
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,918
It was fine, I think.

111
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,725
Meaning?

112
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,560
Meaning fine.

113
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:41,129
Meaning, I think they like the project.
They'd like to work with me.

114
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,677
They're having a meeting on the budget.
They'll call later with an answer.

115
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,905
Where are they gonna call you?

116
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,411
- Where are they gonna call you?
- At the cottage.

117
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:01,052
I thought we agreed
not to give out that number...

118
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,390
unless it's an emergency.

119
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,665
- I think it was important.
- Everything in your life is important.

120
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,897
I don't think it qualifies
as an emergency.

121
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,564
Shut up.

122
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,343
I'm gonna pee.
Does Michael want to come?

123
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,812
Mikey, do you wanna go? No?

124
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,632
When you grow up...

125
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,703
would you like
to be a policeman?

126
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,973
Yes, sir.

127
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,316
Have you actually...

128
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,582
ever seen a dead body?

129
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,282
No, sir.

130
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,887
Would you like to see a dead body?

131
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,519
Yes, sir.

132
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,461
I thought so.

133
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,969
A body that has been
in the River Tyne for three weeks...

134
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,597
swells up to
at least twice its size.

135
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,904
By the time the chemicals,
the fish--

136
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,537
those that survive
the River Tyne--

137
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,606
Well, it makes our job
of recognition...

138
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,449
that little bit more difficult.

139
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,080
Now, boys...

140
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,352
this woman...

141
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,487
has been stabbed to death
with a bread knife.

142
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,292
Ninety percent of crimes--
murders--

143
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,802
are committed by people
who know each other...

144
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,169
love each other...

145
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,936
like your mums and your dads.

146
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,646
Now this chap here...

147
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,716
went to the central station...

148
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,717
went to the gentlemen's toilet...

149
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,620
locked himself in a cubicle, took off
his right shoe, his right sock...

150
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,386
put the muzzle of the gun
in his mouth...

151
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,984
and with his big toe,
he pulled the trigger.

152
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,813
Come on! Hurry up!

153
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,886
Come on, Nic. There's been
an accident at the factory!

154
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,952
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yeah. Okay.

155
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,139
Sorry.

156
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,102
You better go soon,
or you'll miss your bus.

157
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,104
I'll get the next one.

158
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,775
- No.
- Let me.

159
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,916
- They'll wake up.
- No, they won't.

160
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,491
- I love you.
- You're just saying that.

161
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,493
No, I'm not. I do.

162
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,709
Oh, shit.

163
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,499
Hello, Dad.

164
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,139
You all right?

165
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,148
Susan, get me some water, please.

166
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,857
Here.

167
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,706
- Jesus fuckin' Christ!
- Shh.

168
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,795
Shh. You're all right.

169
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,765
Hello, Nic.
How are you doing?

170
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,594
Fine, Mr. Brown.
How are you?

171
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,872
Oh, you know.

172
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,203
Where's my swimsuit?

173
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,571
In that beach bag.
I took it in.

174
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,245
It's not in the beach bag.

175
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,658
Which beach bag?
I couldn't find it.

176
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,991
- Well, we only have one.
- No, there wasn't. There were two.

177
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:18,811
He's crying whether he's happy
or whether he's sad.

178
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,621
Why did you tell him?

179
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,219
- Hey, excuse me--
- Fuck off!

180
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,515
Fuck off!

181
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,062
Listen, I've got a gun.

182
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,931
Sorry.

183
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,469
Sorry!

184
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,526
Come on Nic. There's been
an accident at the factory!

185
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,071
Hey!

186
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,888
It is a mistake, a sin.

187
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,659
Of course, you are right...

188
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,601
and I agree with you,
but I sympathize with the mother.

189
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:05,437
Fifteen years old and no family
and no father has come forward.

190
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,102
They say she sinned
with everyone in the village...

191
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,111
how could they tell
who the father was?

192
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,510
They say it is Gio's.

193
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,140
She has no money,
what else could she do?

194
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,652
Give them to the Lord.
To split them in that way.

195
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:21,884
Twins should stay together.
And to send one of them to England.

196
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:26,429
That place of heresy.
It's a sin I tell you, a sin.

197
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,201
They're now treating as murder...

198
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:43,405
the death of a suspected Loyalist
terrorist inside the Maize prison.

199
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:47,142
The body of David Keyes was found
in his cell early yesterday.

200
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,480
Initially, it was thought
that he had hanged himself...

201
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,781
and officials from
the Northern Ireland office...

202
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,788
said there was no evidence
of foul play.

203
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,291
But following a postmortem examination,
the R.U.C. announced...

204
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,261
they've begun
a murder investigation.

205
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,264
The public inquiry
into the killing...

206
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,426
of the black teenager,
Stephen Lawrence, started today.

207
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:10,268
He was stabbed to death in
a racist attack in South London in 1993.

208
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,968
The inquiry was ordered last year
by the home secretary...

209
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,772
after Stephen Lawrence's family
claimed the police failed...

210
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,645
to gather sufficient evidence
in the hours after his death.

211
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,277
The Vatican is expected
to ask forgiveness from Jews today...

212
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,878
over allegations
that it failed to speak out...

213
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,447
against the Nazi holocaust
during the Second World War.

214
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,756
After ten years of consultation,
it's issuing a document...

215
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:37,926
giving the Roman Catholic Church's
first official response to the claims.

216
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,265
The imprisoned Israeli
nuclear technician, Mordecai Vanunu...

217
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:45,000
has been moved out of solitary
confinement for first time in 12 years.

218
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,372
Israeli agents abducted him
from Europe...

219
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:51,106
and he was sentenced to 18 years
in prison for revealing details...

220
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,672
of the Israeli nuclear weapons
program to the Sunday Times.

221
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,310
Traffic's very slow
anticlockwise on the M25...

222
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,356
in Hertfordshire between
St. Albans and the A405.

223
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:04,018
Drivers are slowing down to look at
a car involved in an earlier accident.

224
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:09,324
- Terminal two, Heathrow, please.
- All right, darling.

225
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:36,882
Hello.

226
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,289
Luca?

227
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,526
Fuck off!

228
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,382
Hello.

229
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:12,758
Listen, don't hang up. Everything
took much longer than I thought.

230
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,058
I had to pick up the film
from the lab at 1:00...

231
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,895
and the truck wasn't ready when
they said it was going to be.

232
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:21,334
So why didn't you ring?

233
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,872
Baby, baby, don't give Luca
a hard time.

234
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:29,879
You know I'd rather be in bed with you
than doing this boring stuff.

235
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,316
So why didn't you ring?

236
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,010
There wasn't a phone
I could get to, baby.

237
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,609
And your mobile?

238
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,852
Are you going to forgive me?

239
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,485
No, probably not.

240
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:47,655
But we'll get over it.
What the fuck do you want?

241
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,029
Listen, I can't make it
to the airport in time...

242
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,193
to meet with the English director.

243
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,204
And Charles is shooting
a commercial all day and--

244
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,570
You can't ask Maria...

245
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:03,203
because you slept with me
and she found out.

246
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:07,449
I can't. My car is being serviced.

247
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:12,352
It's okay. Take a taxi.
Listen, someone's got to meet the guy.

248
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,954
I was going to wash my hair.

249
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,856
Good idea. There's plenty of time.

250
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,725
Impress him with your English.
You need this job.

251
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,628
No, Luca, you need this job.

252
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:28,727
They haven't decided
on a sound recordist yet.

253
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:32,569
Baby, don't be cruel to Luca.

254
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:36,442
Gotta go now. Okay, okay.

255
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,537
No, wait a moment.

256
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,848
Oh, dear.

257
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:43,062
Very nice, charming people.
I like Italians.

258
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,811
I wanna talk to you right away.

259
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,458
Well, I'm in the Rome Airport.
It's full of Italians.

260
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,962
Yeah, I will get in touch.

261
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,935
Nicholas?

262
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,440
Claudia.

263
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,443
Hi. It's good to see you.

264
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,740
Good to see you.

265
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,372
Are you all right?

266
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,350
Yeah. It's the pollen
or something.

267
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:34,947
I feel such a fool.
I have bad reactions sometimes.

268
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:38,926
It's all right.
I'm authorized to take you to dinner.

269
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,428
Come on, then.
Let's go.

270
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,089
Let's go.

271
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,419
You must be Luca.

272
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,682
You know, these roads are crazy.

273
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:40,751
I was once on a mountain road in Egypt,
and we came around a corner very fast--

274
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:44,765
there's one lane, not two lanes--
and this guy was sitting there.

275
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,631
He just decided to stop on the bend
and eat his dinner.

276
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:52,867
You know, sitting in the road
with a juggernaut, this big lorry...

277
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:56,103
on the curve of the mountain,
you know.

278
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,304
It's crazy.

279
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:01,781
This is beautiful.

280
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:05,115
I could stay here
for a very long time.

281
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:11,818
That's a good point, but I would
take a slightly different line...

282
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:15,226
that when you were talking
about the batteries--

283
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:18,061
I mean, we could carry them out.

284
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,364
I know that means we're putting
a greater strain on our own engines....

285
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:25,270
and therefore using more fuel,
therefore creating more emissions.

286
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:30,038
It's a real problem,
but we have to weigh up...

287
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:33,478
the environmental...

288
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,948
evangelism...

289
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:39,919
the benefit of that
from the movie we're making...

290
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,048
as opposed to
the actual impact we make...

291
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:47,720
bringing our cameras and vehicles
to the places we want to film.

292
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,855
When we were in Antarctica...

293
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:54,459
we were very conscientious
about not leaving any scrap...

294
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:56,902
of waste.

295
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:59,633
I mean, we carried out
our own shit.

296
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:30,029
It's absolutely one thing
talking about...

297
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,472
all these Third World countries,
but the fact of the matter is...

298
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:37,443
some of our worst experiences
have actually come from Europe.

299
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,776
Paris, for example.

300
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:43,113
Tell you what's funny.
Have you ever been homeless in Paris?

301
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,379
Now that's a fricking trip.

302
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:49,548
Eventually I met this guy who
let me crash with him. Really cool guy.

303
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:53,253
And he took me out
to a few places and stuff.

304
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:56,331
I became aware that
Paris sort of functions...

305
01:13:56,432 --> 01:14:00,869
on this totally sort of
different level sometimes.

306
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,698
They have a great time.

307
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:07,265
But it's weird how it was so separated
from mainstream Parisian society.

308
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,970
Harassment by police and stuff--

309
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:14,276
You know, that was like
being in a Third World nation.

310
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:17,443
Or what was supposed to be
a Third World nation.

311
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:20,818
Here's another thing. What is this
Third World nation bollocks?

312
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:39,463
Beautiful today though, isn't it?

313
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:45,777
The thing about the Indonesians,
they've got 13,000 islands...

314
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:50,011
and they're still expanding
and clearing the forests...

315
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,815
more rapaciously than
the Japanese ever did in Borneo.

316
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,287
It's a wicked situation.

317
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:01,021
And the Dani are really
being hounded into extinction.

318
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:05,259
You've gotta remember, these people
were only discovered in the early '50s.

319
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,198
They're Stone Age people.

320
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,634
There was an American flyer...

321
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:13,469
who crash-landed,
came across them.

322
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,099
It's extraordinary.

323
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:19,044
You know, one of the things
about their diet...

324
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:22,412
is that there were
no large mammals on Irian Jaya.

325
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:26,078
So the cannibalism, although
it had taken on a ritualistic...

326
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,156
symbolic significance...

327
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:32,454
it was actually about
their need for protein.

328
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:36,053
When they bring in
a prisoner from another tribe...

329
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:39,395
they tie them up
and then get the small children--

330
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,969
the four-year-olds
and five-year-olds--

331
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:46,268
to beat the prisoners...

332
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:49,070
to become very used
to the cruelty...

333
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:53,273
to assimilate this capacity...

334
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:56,179
to kill without any emotion.

335
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:58,252
It's very effective.

336
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:02,551
And then the beaten, broken bodies
are dragged into these fire pits...

337
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:05,626
where they're baked
on the hot rocks.

338
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:19,431
Listen. Just pick up everything
you've got and get in the gym.

339
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,974
Come on. Out.

340
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:23,670
Just take everything with you.

341
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,606
- Not ready, Nic?
- No, sir.

342
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,617
- What's the problem?
- Not well, sir.

343
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:38,187
Not well? Again?

344
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:39,692
Sir.

345
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:41,853
Have you got a note?

346
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:45,399
Lost it, sir.
My mother said that--

347
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,934
I'm not interested.

348
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:50,561
What to do?
What do you think?

349
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:54,335
- Don't know, sir.
- Here's what we'll do.

350
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,036
You strip off,
then come in the gym.

351
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:59,636
- Yes, sir.
- All right?

352
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:12,089
Everybody does P.E.

353
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:13,387
And I mean everybody.

354
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:19,693
The reason we do P.E. is to
keep our bodies fit and healthy.

355
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:22,861
And also get rid of any
excess fat we might have.

356
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:28,007
Boys, take one shoe off.

357
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:32,237
This may teach you a lesson.

358
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:35,043
And then again,
maybe it won't.

359
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,948
But I've tried everything with you.
l've bent over backwards to help you.

360
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:39,953
- Haven't I?
- Yes, sir.

361
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,287
Now, run to the end
and back to me...

362
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,292
until I say stop.

363
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:23,438
Luca, that's the new Sennheiser.

364
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:26,742
I've used it. Thought it was incredible.
How do you find it?

365
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:34,554
Hey, hotshot.

366
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:37,386
I was in that spaghetti western too.

367
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:41,223
Speaking of spaghetti, I thought
your pasta was incredible. Thank you.

368
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,269
I hope your sound recording
is half as good.

369
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:54,105
Luca, what's the hurry?

370
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:56,513
Take it easy.

371
01:30:56,617 --> 01:31:00,451
Put on some nice music and just relax.
This isn't good for the equipment.

372
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:04,954
Where?

373
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:20,803
This is what you English call
''field recording,'' yes?

374
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,307
That's right.

375
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:40,493
You fucking whore.

376
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:42,654
What are you?
A fucking whore!

377
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,963
Don't touch!

378
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,793
Stop! Stop!

379
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:46,917
What is it?

380
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,462
Oh, dear God.

381
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,123
Shit!

382
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:57,093
No, don't move him.
Don't move him. Shit!

383
01:32:57,204 --> 01:33:00,367
Press. Press firmly.
Do what you can.

384
01:33:07,715 --> 01:33:09,615
It's in the front.

385
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:36,034
Do you speak English?

386
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:47,646
We have to stop the bleeding!

387
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:38,226
We're very sorry.

388
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:42,767
My friends and me...

389
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:46,437
we will go...

390
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:50,408
but we will come back with polizi.

391
01:35:58,352 --> 01:35:59,683
We...

392
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:02,483
need to go...

393
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,820
but we will come back.

394
01:36:08,362 --> 01:36:11,354
We are very sorry.
This was an accident.

395
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:16,234
Yes.

396
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,077
One moment.

397
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:36,215
What's going on?

398
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:38,951
He wants one of us to stay.

399
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:41,550
It's his only guarantee
we're gonna come back.

400
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:44,426
- Makes sense.
- I'll stay.

401
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:46,762
- Men, I've got a plan.
- What?

402
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:49,927
Let's get in the car
and fly away as soon as we can.

403
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:51,937
It's very simple.
I'll stay here.

404
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:54,872
If you guys don't stop,
you can be back here--

405
01:36:54,975 --> 01:36:57,569
Why should you stay?
I'll stay.

406
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:59,578
He should stay.
He was driving.

407
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:03,377
- No, I'm going to stay.
- Absolutely not.

408
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:07,215
Because I'm a woman I should be treated
differently? This is the best idea.

409
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:10,119
I am just as guilty
as everyone else, okay?

410
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:12,920
It would be much less volatile
with a woman staying here.

411
01:37:13,027 --> 01:37:15,291
It won't be threatening
or aggressive.

412
01:37:15,396 --> 01:37:17,660
I will stay.

413
01:37:17,765 --> 01:37:19,790
It's my project.
I'm the producer.

414
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,959
It would be a relief
to be out of the car.

415
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:24,401
I'll be fine.
Look, I'm here.

416
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,473
How long will you be?
