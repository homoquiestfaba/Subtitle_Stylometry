1
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:29,475
How much is a man worth?

2
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,106
Four bucks an hour
for the Iucky ones.

3
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:36,439
How do you feed your famiIy?

4
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:38,881
Where do you find hope

5
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:41,683
when your name
isn't even worth writing down?

6
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,686
There's a big fence separating
the rich and the poor,

7
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:49,252
bigger than the one
dividing the Iand

8
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:50,991
and much harder to cIimb.

9
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,165
Where does a man get
his strength to survive?

10
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:58,535
From his wiII to fight.

11
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:01,234
I come from a peopIe of fighters,

12
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:02,969
who fight because they have to.

13
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:06,343
How much is a man worth?

14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,610
It depends on which side
of the fence you're on

15
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:10,880
the day you were born.

16
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:16,183
From Mexico With Love

17
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:27,665
Laredo, Texas
7 miIes from Mexican border

18
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:33,436
Tensions at the border
continue to escaIate

19
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:35,270
as Congress decreed
that a doubIe reinforced

20
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,708
steeI and wire fence
be buiIt aIong portions...

21
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,819
...as NationaI Guard troops
take positions aIong the border

22
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:49,617
for an extended period of time.

23
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:04,699
This is
the United States Border PatroI.

24
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:08,606
You have iIIegaIIy entered
into U.S. territory.

25
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:09,631
HaIt!

26
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:10,904
AItos!

27
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:14,602
Hands up!

28
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:17,845
Los manos arriba todos!
Los manos arriba!

29
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:19,875
- Let's go.
- Que se meten por adentro.

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,012
Inside everybody.

31
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,129
Por adentro, por adentro.

32
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,392
Look out, I gotcha there.

33
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:43,902
- Tito!
- Hey, Pete.

34
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:46,636
- Hey, you Iike this one?
- God, darn it!

35
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:48,402
Man, that's a huge one!

36
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:51,376
- Ain't she beautifuI?
- About the biggest one I've ever seen!

37
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:53,572
She'II catch a good price.
There you go, baby.

38
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:55,046
How big you think that is?

39
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:57,606
I don't know,
about five, six pounds.

40
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,243
God dog. Man.

41
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:01,151
You out here aIone?

42
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,586
Just me and the snakes, brother.

43
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,722
Hey, I got to check
the back of your van.

44
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,784
Do what you
got to do, brother.

45
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:08,851
AII right.

46
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:15,361
Nice! Looks Iike
business has been good.

47
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:16,926
I can't compIain.

48
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,700
I saw you got yourseIf
a pretty good catch this afternoon.

49
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,037
Yeah, every day, 24/7.

50
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:24,703
WeII, you got your majaIos,
I got my snakes, brother.

51
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:27,370
Business is good for us both.

52
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:28,904
Just stay out of troubIe, Tito.

53
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,348
Hey, you know me.

54
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:34,080
The first thing I Iearned,
how not to get bit.

55
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,731
Come on, man,
you're Iate, Iate, Iate.

56
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:56,764
Come on, Iet's go!

57
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,239
This is aII you can find?

58
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,837
I thought you put the word out.

59
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,279
I did put the word out,

60
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,783
but everyone prefers
the action at Red's.

61
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:07,218
AII right! Fight night at Giorgi's.

62
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,743
Here we go.
Ready to make some money?

63
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:11,188
Let's go.
Better, better, better, bet, bet, bet!

64
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,624
Come on, three to one odds.
Let's do it.

65
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:17,953
HoId on, aII right.

66
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:19,056
You got it.

67
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,966
Good! AII right!
We'II get some money.

68
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,867
We get aII of the money.
That's what we Iike.

69
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,461
Any more? Two to one?
There you go.

70
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,132
Giorgi, I'II go for 25, man!

71
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,971
He's betting on himseIf!
Look out!

72
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,274
Twenty-five, we got that.

73
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,007
Big guy!
Big one, he Iooks tough.

74
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:54,022
Come on!

75
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:58,832
Gracias.

76
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,575
Yo, Tito.

77
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,581
- You're Iate.
- I'm sorry.

78
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,139
Go. Come on.

79
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:12,512
Get in there.

80
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:14,543
- You got the medicine?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:15,576
AII right.

82
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:17,613
- Hey.
- What?

83
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:18,817
You know them?

84
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:22,151
I don't know.
They come in different shifts.

85
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:23,219
CouId be someone eIse.

86
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:25,459
What are you doing?

87
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:26,863
We can't Iet them find
them now, Tito.

88
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,629
Yeah, they'II find 'em for sure
you start shooting.

89
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:29,692
Get out of here.

90
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:05,126
Come on, man!

91
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:15,778
Step out.

92
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:16,971
One,

93
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:18,415
two,

94
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:19,645
three,

95
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,119
four,

96
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:22,917
five,

97
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,287
six,

98
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:25,621
seven,

99
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:26,647
eight,

100
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:27,955
nine,

101
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:28,983
ten!

102
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,360
You okay?

103
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:42,536
Yeah, we're
Iooking for another one now.

104
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,906
Just Iooking for another one.

105
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:45,001
Come on.
Who wants to fight?

106
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:46,341
You okay for another fight?

107
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,181
Hey, okay,
we need another fighter.

108
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:50,773
Looking for somebody.

109
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,115
- Look at him. He's tired.
- Who wants to fight?

110
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,814
- He aImost Iost that one!
- I'm tired.

111
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:22,606
What the heII is going on?

112
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,047
It's a garage, Tito.

113
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,847
No one thinks otherwise.

114
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:29,988
AII right, I'II get them out.

115
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:32,287
- Vamanos, vamanos.
- Look, Tito...

116
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,314
we need the money, man.

117
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:35,350
What, from a bunch of drunks?

118
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,191
I got enough shit happening
on the border aIready, okay?

119
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:40,358
I don't need this shit!

120
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:45,603
Gente, servicios a Ia derecha,

121
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,162
agua fresca a Ia izquierda.

122
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:50,901
Hey.

123
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,060
WeII, weII, weII.

124
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,935
StiII the same oId Hector,

125
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:20,269
fighting in the dirt.

126
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:21,295
Last time I saw you,

127
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:23,832
you were fighting
some IittIe runt back in Asunc¡ön.

128
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:26,879
Things don't change much,
do they?

129
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:27,902
Yeah, it's funny.

130
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,978
Last time I saw you,
you were a stuck-up IittIe brat.

131
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:34,415
Maybe things don't change at aII.

132
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,896
I remember this.

133
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,488
They were your dad's, right?

134
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:46,555
Don't touch those, okay?

135
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:50,591
Why did you come here?

136
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,668
Why does anyone come here?

137
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:02,503
Who's that?

138
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:04,305
Nobody.

139
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,147
WeII, he's a Ioud nobody.

140
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:07,277
Yeah, they usuaIIy are.

141
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,719
Joven, medicina.

142
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:11,445
This is it?

143
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:13,452
What? They're cheap, okay?

144
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:15,586
It doesn't aIways mean
they got them in stock.

145
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:16,788
PIus, you owe me from Iast week.

146
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,297
Yeah, I was going to pay
you back with what I won.

147
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:20,321
And if you Iost?

148
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,929
You didn't think of that? No.

149
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:25,028
You can take it out
of my cut of the side bets.

150
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,971
Which wouId Ieave you
just with the bruises, right?

151
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,030
You're not using your head.

152
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,634
Come on,
we've got to go now.

153
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:31,666
WeIcome home.

154
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,699
Okay, Maria.

155
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:00,730
Hector, show her to the room.

156
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,908
Everybody eIse come with me.

157
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,034
Sígame.

158
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:12,443
You'II share
your beautifuI suite with Lupe.

159
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:13,679
She mostIy works up at the house,

160
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,588
so you'II have
the whoIe penthouse here to yourseIf.

161
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:18,988
This is the kitchen,

162
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:21,084
toiIet's down the haII,

163
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,355
shower's around the corner.

164
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:24,556
We share them,
so there's no time for pampering.

165
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:28,264
There's a very modern pay phone

166
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,269
here right outside your door
in case you get homesick,

167
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:34,262
but it cuts peopIe off,
so make the tears quick, aII right?

168
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:36,400
What is your probIem?

169
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,932
I ain't got a probIem.

170
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,210
Mamí.

171
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:50,387
Hijo.

172
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,023
Dönde fuiste?

173
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,628
I don't Iike this medicine.

174
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:04,397
Ma, it wiII heIp you breathe.

175
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:05,768
This heIps me to cough.

176
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,103
Yes, that's because
you're not using it right.

177
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,335
Listen...

178
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:13,405
Mama, Iisten,

179
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,710
don't go out to the fieIds

180
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:18,478
PIease.

181
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,611
No work, no pay.

182
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,211
I wiII take care of it.

183
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,987
Fighting?

184
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,050
No, hijo, ya no.

185
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:31,257
You can't soIve every probIem
with your fists.

186
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,355
Ya no.

187
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:34,764
Mama, pIease,
I'II take care of it.

188
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:37,133
Don't worry about it, pIease.

189
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,096
Now you sound Iike your father.

190
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:46,703
Who's this?

191
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:51,506
Ay, no. Dios mío, Maria!

192
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,851
HoIa, Señora ViIIa.

193
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,015
So grown up.

194
00:12:58,057 --> 00:13:00,184
How time fIies.

195
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,750
How Iong has it been?

196
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,318
Nine years.

197
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,886
Nine?

198
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,593
Oh, my, you're so beautifuI.

199
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,760
Verdad que esta Iinda, Hector?

200
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:10,791
I didn't notice.

201
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:12,600
What do you mean,
you didn't notice?

202
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:15,937
Ay, me dices
que tenemos azotes, tu tío.

203
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,002
TeII me.

204
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:20,842
TeII me about yourseIf,

205
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,905
teII me about your famiIy.

206
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,139
Mamí.

207
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:27,584
Mama, okay, take it easy.

208
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,281
Mama, take it easy now.

209
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:32,749
Lie down.

210
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,454
It's okay.
We can taIk Iater, Señora ViIIa.

211
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:37,588
We'II taIk tomorrow.

212
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,265
Take it easy now.
Try to rest a IittIe bit.

213
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:46,128
- Don't go far.
- No, I'II be here.

214
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:57,746
She doesn't Iook that bad.

215
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:59,444
Yeah, weII, she is.

216
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,580
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:05,746
You shouId get some rest, too,

218
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,954
because the first day in the fieIds
takes it out of you.

219
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,920
What?

220
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:14,853
Nothing, it's just...

221
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,759
there's something different
about you.

222
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,163
You mean I was
not being a stuck-up IittIe brat?

223
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,396
Yeah, maybe.

224
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:26,837
Sorry, it's just different.

225
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:37,744
PeopIe change, Hector.

226
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,011
Life happens.

227
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:41,443
PeopIe grow up.

228
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:45,256
Here.

229
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,586
Oh, una mariquita!

230
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,325
They say they're
very good Iuck for farms

231
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:53,923
because they eat a Iot of the pests.

232
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:55,593
Maybe I brought some good Iuck.

233
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,933
Maybe you brought the pests.

234
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,665
Oh, shut up.

235
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:00,763
Come on, Iet's go.

236
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:02,034
But I'm not done yet.

237
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,599
WeII, if I waited for you,
we'd be here aII day.

238
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:07,872
Mama, you okay?

239
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:18,149
That's too heavy, hijo.

240
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,021
No, IIeves dos!

241
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,617
Vas a Iastimar, Hector.

242
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:22,650
He's crazy.

243
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:26,426
I know. Strong,
but Iike his father, so pig-headed.

244
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,092
Don't hurt yourseIf.

245
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,125
Not a chance.

246
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:31,568
Thank you, Hector.

247
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:36,267
Bye!

248
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:57,355
Hey, Iooks
Iike you missed the truck.

249
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:00,496
I wanted to waIk.

250
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,195
It's a Iong way in the heat.

251
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,067
I don't mind the heat.

252
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:08,335
Besides,
you're driving a convertibIe.

253
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,467
StiII be hot.

254
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:11,840
Not if you go fast enough.

255
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:22,176
Why don't you take one of these?

256
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,950
It's better than water
on a day Iike today.

257
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:30,287
Are you going to drive by every day
when it's hot?

258
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:32,423
If you want me to.

259
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,469
My name's Robert.

260
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,567
You sure you don't want a ride?

261
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:45,372
No, thanks.

262
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:47,542
Suit yourseIf.

263
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,150
What did he want?

264
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,086
He just gave me a drink.

265
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,116
You want some?

266
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,685
Nah, I Iike mine just fine.

267
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,199
It sure is pretty up here.

268
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,395
Yeah, if you're rich.

269
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:13,064
I wouIdn't get too comfortabIe,
you know.

270
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,505
Is that Robert?

271
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,638
Yup, this is where he trains.

272
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,671
He's the IocaI champ at Red's.

273
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:28,778
Take it easy, God damn it.

274
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:30,652
You're just working out...

275
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:31,678
brat.

276
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:36,725
Is he any good?

277
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:37,751
Yeah, he's very good.

278
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,856
It's just his baIance sucks.

279
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:40,923
Time.

280
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:43,759
What the heck did you say?

281
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:45,737
He didn't say anything.

282
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:47,398
So what, you got to hide
behind your girIfriend?

283
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,237
I said you got to work
on your baIance.

284
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:52,070
- BuIIshit.
- He's right.

285
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,969
That's why you're aIways off kiIter
after two punches.

286
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:56,379
ReaIIy?

287
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,387
Why don't you come up here
if you know so much?

288
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:03,683
I don't.

289
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:04,711
I think you do.

290
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:07,453
Maybe your girIfriend does.

291
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,120
What's your name, sweetie?
I didn't get it earIier.

292
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:10,560
Maria.

293
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:13,326
Maria? What do you say
you come on up here,

294
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:16,027
and we show your boy here
a thing or two about how I move?

295
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:21,266
That's right, bring it on up, SaIIy!

296
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:23,972
You want to change your shirt?

297
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,476
Hector, don't.

298
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,172
It's okay, Maria.

299
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:29,647
If he's any good,
maybe I'II give him a new job.

300
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:32,309
You ever done this before?

301
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:33,477
Yeah.

302
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,680
You got a mouthpiece for him?

303
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:38,189
No. How strong
are your teeth, kid?

304
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:41,722
There's another one
around here somewhere.

305
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:54,167
You sure you know
what you're doing?

306
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:56,140
Yeah, I used to hear
my dad's trainer scream a Iot.

307
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,870
Who was your father?

308
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,502
AIfonso ViIIa.

309
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:07,013
Watch his right.

310
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:18,824
AII right, square off.
No funny shit, you hear?

311
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:19,853
No probIem.

312
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,059
You got twenty pounds
on this kid.

313
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,933
Just move around, work your jab,
get some work in.

314
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,402
I said no probIem.

315
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:27,327
Time.

316
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,276
Come on, come on.

317
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:35,610
Show me what you got.

318
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:36,672
What you gonna do?

319
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,307
Throw cucumbers at me?

320
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:43,587
Yeah, come on.

321
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:46,249
You're sIow.

322
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:49,655
Nothing. Come on.

323
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:52,425
There you go. Bring it.

324
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,464
You're a picker, not a fighter!

325
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,101
That's cute.

326
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:08,406
Da, Hector, aIIí, aIIí cuIo!

327
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,347
Qué, qué, qué? Cut it out!

328
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:12,543
Get these peopIe out of here.

329
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:14,382
He's got something, though.

330
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,717
Come on.

331
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,757
You didn't actuaIIy
hear us taIking, did you?

332
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,922
No, I just
wanted your girIfriend's name.

333
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:26,158
You don't mind, do you?

334
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:27,392
Break that shit up!

335
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:40,839
God damn it!

336
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:42,107
AII right, that's it! Take it easy!

337
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:43,136
Cut it out! Hey!

338
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:44,444
God damn it, that's enough!

339
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:45,507
Get out of here!

340
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:46,575
What's with
the hockey game buIIshit?

341
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:48,951
That's the same crap you puIIed
in your Iast fight.

342
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,114
I won that fight, didn't I?

343
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:52,715
Yeah, you won, but this ain't Red's,
and you're just sparring.

344
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:54,692
I didn't want our boy
to get too cocky here.

345
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,661
You did good.

346
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,788
Job's yours if you want it.

347
00:21:58,831 --> 00:21:59,820
What's it pay?

348
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:03,799
See, that's what I need,
a sparring partner with some guts.

349
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:05,463
Hey!

350
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:07,631
I say who fights and who don't.

351
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:09,998
Break this shit up!

352
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,533
Vamanos, aII of you!

353
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:14,011
Daddy, I just gave him the job.

354
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:15,513
The job isn't yours to give.

355
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:18,539
BiIIy, what are you doing,
hosting amateur hour here?

356
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:21,747
You know I want the boy in the ring
with a professionaI sparring partner,

357
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,118
not a goddamn picker.

358
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:25,146
But, jefe, Hector's good.

359
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,680
I mean, even BiIIy said so.

360
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:27,987
I couId use him.

361
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:29,585
It ain't about him.

362
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:31,118
I want somebody down
who's got a name,

363
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:33,324
somebody who can heIp to moId
this boy into a champion.

364
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:35,060
Name won't heIp.

365
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,260
Discussion is over.

366
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:38,064
Move it, you heard the man!

367
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:41,004
Hey, BiIIy,
when Tito brought you to me,

368
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,530
you were just a busted-out drunk,

369
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:44,371
running two-bit smoker fights
from the gutter in Mexico,

370
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,900
and Iook at you now.

371
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:48,879
You got yourseIf
a steady paycheck,

372
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:51,439
pIus you got yourseIf
a contender to train.

373
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,974
Just train him to win.

374
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,718
Here.

375
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:58,052
Take it. It's your share

376
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,024
of my boy's winnings Iast night.
Go on!

377
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,363
This haIf I earned.

378
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,737
The rest came from these.

379
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,406
This ain't boxing.

380
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,072
Hey, BiIIy, what the heII
do you think peopIe want?

381
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:23,877
They want titans.

382
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:24,974
They want bIood, they want action.

383
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:27,008
That's what puts asses in the seats.

384
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:30,510
Then you shouId have buiIt
a goddamn wrestIing ring.

385
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:36,893
Wait, BiIIy, you're quitting?

386
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,897
You Iet him go!

387
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:42,094
I'm tired to death
of your oId-schooI buIIshit!

388
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:44,294
BiIIy!

389
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,609
Wow.

390
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,920
Never been in here before.

391
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,393
You have no reason to come here.

392
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:18,919
Yeah, but now that you're here,
maybe you can fix the toiIet

393
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:20,864
and get the water pressure working
in the showers.

394
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:22,059
- Hector.
- No.

395
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,125
Or maybe we can come up
and use your pooI.

396
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,400
He's onIy joking.

397
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:30,340
Hector,
Robert has something for you.

398
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:37,839
What's this?

399
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:39,578
Fifty bucks.

400
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:41,313
You earned it in the ring yesterday.

401
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:42,547
Isn't that great?

402
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:48,815
Thanks, bro.

403
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:51,020
I don't need your charity.

404
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,505
Robert, I'm sorry.

405
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:06,909
He didn't mean it.

406
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:08,503
I'II give it to him.

407
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,147
No probIem.

408
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:17,747
Thank you.

409
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:19,381
Thank you so much.

410
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:27,024
Why do you do that?

411
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:30,465
He was just trying to heIp.

412
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:31,935
Why were you riding with him?

413
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,438
I went back to get your mom's inhaIer.

414
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:35,770
She dropped it in the fieIds.

415
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,638
He gave me a ride back.
It's no big deaI!

416
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:39,405
These peopIe pIay games, Maria.

417
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:44,673
You know about games, don't you?

418
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:46,081
Oh, you're an ass.

419
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:47,983
You'II fit right in.

420
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:51,612
Take it. This is for your mom.

421
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:52,783
Hey, I just saw...

422
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,251
I just saw Ro--

423
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,101
This farm's going to be in the red
this keeps up.

424
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:09,300
The boss ain't gonna Iike it.

425
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:10,831
We got to crack the whip.

426
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:14,208
It's the third goddamn time
this week.

427
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:16,976
How much we short?

428
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:18,004
About sixteen buckets.

429
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:22,284
But it's very hot, señor.

430
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:25,347
I don't give a good goddamn
how hot it is!

431
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,414
The way you Pepes pick,

432
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:28,255
the crops are gonna rot
before you get to them.

433
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:30,955
Now we're onIy paying
per bucket from now on.

434
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:33,760
We get paid by the day, sir.
That was your deaI.

435
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,460
Not anymore, son.

436
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:38,391
Hey.

437
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,496
It's buIIshit.

438
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:41,972
No te puedes, no te puedes.

439
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,134
Hey, whose sorry-ass work is this?

440
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:46,167
It's mine.

441
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:47,906
I'm sorry. My mom's sick.

442
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:49,880
WeII, then she shouIdn't be
in my goddamn fieIds!

443
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,785
That's not even haIf day's work!

444
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:01,850
She didn't make but haIf the Ioad.

445
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:06,193
Listen, Chico, you keep this up,

446
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:08,290
I'II have your Mama shoveIing shit
with you out in the fieId,

447
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,767
'cause it seems to be
about aII your famiIy's worth!

448
00:28:38,497 --> 00:28:39,759
Damn!

449
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:40,628
Damn it!

450
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,458
Sorry, Tito.

451
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:44,628
Tito, sorry, man.

452
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:46,261
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:56,981
You didn't want to take my money,
and now you've got nothing.

454
00:28:58,116 --> 00:28:59,640
What, no smart comeback?

455
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:02,913
Get this piece of shit out of here.

456
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:06,681
Hey, pinche mojado...

457
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,187
you ever set foot
on this property again,

458
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:12,321
I'II deport every one of your peopIe.
You understand me?

459
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:14,491
I'II deport
every goddamn one of them.

460
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,804
WouId you controI your animaIs?

461
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:27,502
Come on, Iet me go!

462
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:30,344
No! Get your hands off me!

463
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:32,782
No! I'm not going in there!

464
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,286
I'm not going in there!
Let me go!

465
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,719
Hey! Let me out!

466
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:38,086
Let me out of here!

467
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:39,522
God damn it!

468
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:42,220
God damn it!
Let me out of here!

469
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:44,925
Hey! Let me out of here!

470
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:48,808
What do you want?

471
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,343
Some water.

472
00:31:58,029 --> 00:31:59,758
- Thanks.
- That aII?

473
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:02,358
You trained my father.

474
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,424
Tito teII you that?

475
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:05,163
I saw the spiders on your sign.

476
00:32:05,203 --> 00:32:07,068
Your dad,
he was a good guy.

477
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:11,564
Stubborn, bad temper,
wouIdn't Iisten, wouIdn't train.

478
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,238
He went his way, I went mine.
I don't Iook back.

479
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,975
Hey, I want to Iearn to fight.

480
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:18,175
I don't teach anyone to fight.

481
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:20,340
What about the kids?

482
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,917
They don't fight.

483
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:24,114
You smeII bad.

484
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:51,940
Muchachos, nos vemos.

485
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,116
Hombre...

486
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:01,388
Tito toId me
about what happened, ese.

487
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,620
He said it was
some show you put on.

488
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:07,962
Hey, I need to get back.

489
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,027
WeII, it's, uh...

490
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:15,396
$2,000 to cross the border, ese.

491
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,347
You're a IittIe short.

492
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:33,823
I know. It's aII I got.

493
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,558
Don't insuIt me.

494
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:37,856
Keep your bIue money.

495
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:47,533
You know what?
You owe me $2,000.

496
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:53,542
Dos, tres, por adentro.

497
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:57,976
What? Look at me.

498
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
That Jake was right.

499
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:00,984
You're a reaI son of a bitch,
you know that?

500
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,113
And I Iike your mother,
so you must get it from your father,

501
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:06,180
who was
a no-good son of a bitch himseIf.

502
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:09,419
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:15,193
Are you aII right?

504
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:16,325
Yeah.

505
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:17,357
How's your nose?

506
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,870
My nose is fine, not broken.

507
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,728
How's my mom?

508
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:22,967
She's not good.

509
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:24,235
Can you take me to her?

510
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:25,572
You want to fouI things up
for me, too?

511
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:34,478
Here.

512
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,679
That's aII your crap.

513
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,415
I fished it out of the trash.

514
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:41,318
I can take you to another farm.

515
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,224
I'm sure you can find
another Jake there to fight.

516
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:44,751
Hey, man,
I got to take care of my mom.

517
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:46,491
Yeah, weII, you shouId
have thought about that

518
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:47,930
before you started sIugging.

519
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:49,160
I can't go to another farm.

520
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,724
That's not my probIem!

521
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:55,032
AII right, this is what I'II do.

522
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:56,563
I'II Iook in on your mom, okay?

523
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,869
Make sure she's okay
untiI you get settIed.

524
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:02,101
Then I'II bring her to you.

525
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:04,672
Listen, think about this.

526
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:07,480
Maybe I can become
a coyote with you and Chucho.

527
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,884
The farm's aII I can offer,

528
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,480
or eIse Chucho wiII take you
back over the border right now.

529
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:14,822
Okay, I'II go back with Chucho.

530
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:19,221
I'II Iet you know where I end up.

531
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:23,797
The kid is crazy, dude.
Where's he going?

532
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:27,196
He's aII right.
There's some hope for him.

533
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:30,334
You know what, Tito?
You're crazy, too.

534
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:36,671
Aguantense.

535
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:52,721
Hey.

536
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:55,762
You must be
a pretty good fighter, huh?

537
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,789
I ain't a fighter.

538
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:57,824
I'm a boxer.

539
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:59,530
Oh, yeah?
What's the difference?

540
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:00,697
Boxers think.

541
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:26,720
We're out of water.

542
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:28,231
How do I get
one of those trophies?

543
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:29,426
Go down to the corner store,
they're a buck apiece.

544
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:30,832
Is that how the kid got one?

545
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:31,858
No, he earned it.

546
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:34,736
Okay, then I'd Iike a room.

547
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:39,038
WeII, you get a room
the same way you get a trophy.

548
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:40,476
You buy it or you earn it.

549
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,469
What do I got to do?

550
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:45,705
You pIay chess, kid?

551
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,012
A IittIe.

552
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:51,555
Okay, not much.

553
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:55,091
None, but I can box.

554
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,115
I mean, I want to box.

555
00:36:57,662 --> 00:36:59,755
TeII you what,
I'II give you a choice.

556
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:02,095
You pIay me in chess,
or you box EI AngeIito.

557
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:04,067
Okay, I'II box EI AngeIito.

558
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:08,968
Wait, who's EI AngeIito?

559
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:10,907
AngeIito!

560
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:12,603
Can you go
another coupIe of rounds?

561
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:14,578
- With who?
- New kid.

562
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:16,739
Yeah, okay.

563
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:19,045
You got guts, kid.
I'II teII you that.

564
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:23,576
HoIy shit.

565
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:37,662
Wait, who are you?

566
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:38,999
I work your corner.

567
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:41,835
Don't worry.
Hands up, chin down, got it?

568
00:37:41,873 --> 00:37:43,101
Got it.

569
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:46,133
Hands up, chin down!

570
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:52,880
Whose side is she on?

571
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:54,179
Stay focused.

572
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:55,310
Here you go.

573
00:37:56,454 --> 00:37:57,921
Time!

574
00:37:57,956 --> 00:37:59,014
Go on.

575
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,607
So, how'd it go?

576
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:04,987
You can have the back room.

577
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:42,654
Hey, where are you going?

578
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:44,759
Hey, Robert.

579
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:47,629
Hey. HoIa, Maria.

580
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:48,893
Cömo estas?

581
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:49,922
Bien gracias.

582
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:51,824
Do you speak Spanish?

583
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,393
Un poquito.

584
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,632
Y'aII, uh, quiere agua?

585
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:57,766
Yeah, sure.

586
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:02,172
There you go.

587
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:03,305
Thanks.

588
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,711
This is beautifuI.

589
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:10,312
You Iike it? Yeah, it's nice.

590
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:11,582
You haven't seen the property?

591
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:14,052
Come on,
Iet me show you around.

592
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:29,796
You see that tree right there?

593
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:32,036
My great-granddaddy
pIanted that.

594
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:34,135
That's how we teII
if it's going to be a good season.

595
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,842
And how is that?

596
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:39,441
WeII, peaches
are reaIIy fickIe to weather.

597
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:41,145
Every time this tree
bears good fruit,

598
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:43,312
we strike goId out in the fieIds.

599
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:47,415
The thing is, great-granddad
never Iet a man pick from this tree.

600
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,619
AIways said that women
had softer hands

601
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,991
that wouIdn't bruise the fruit.

602
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,295
I think that's a prize one
right there.

603
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:57,790
Come on.

604
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:01,364
There you go.

605
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:05,437
Now, I think you shouId be the one
to take the first bite this year.

606
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:07,467
Maria and I
have to get groceries for dinner.

607
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,241
Then I'II give you a ride into town.
How about that?

608
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,145
- Okay.
- AII right.

609
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:13,343
You know what?
Give me a minute.

610
00:41:13,384 --> 00:41:14,646
I'm going
to go get changed, okay?

611
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,153
Why did you say yes?

612
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:24,855
I know what I'm doing.

613
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:34,395
Hey, you're supposed
to be in the ring with OIIie.

614
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,066
OIIie's useIess, Dad.

615
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:38,598
Thought you said you were
going to get me a new trainer?

616
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:40,201
I'm working on it.

617
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:41,302
Okay.

618
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:42,972
What's going on with that girI?

619
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:46,207
Nothing.

620
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,478
Just having a IittIe fun, okay?

621
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:49,213
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

622
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:52,188
You Iisten to me, Robert,
and Iisten good.

623
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:54,953
I don't intend to spend
the rest of my Iife here,

624
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:58,325
and unIess you do,
you better keep your eye on the prize.

625
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:01,331
Your grandfather saddIed me
with that piIe of dirt out there.

626
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:04,232
Everything I got
is tied up in it and you.

627
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:07,464
That's why I ride you so hard,
you understand?

628
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:08,699
I know, Dad.

629
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:10,036
AII right.

630
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:26,719
Let me teach you
a IittIe something about boxing.

631
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:28,782
You see,
it's aII in the combinations.

632
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:31,761
Jab, cross, uppercut, hook.

633
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:33,320
You do that right,

634
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:34,854
the other guy
wiII never know what hit him.

635
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:38,729
What if someone hits you first?

636
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:41,134
WeII, the onIy ones
who get cIose enough to hit me

637
00:42:41,172 --> 00:42:42,833
are usuaIIy just beautifuI women.

638
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:46,933
They aII faII
for that crap, huh?

639
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:47,967
Who's that?

640
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:49,639
The other girIs you've been with.

641
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:54,411
Yeah, pretty much.

642
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:59,087
Listen, we're having a party
up at the house tonight.

643
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:00,215
You shouId come on up.

644
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:01,247
It'II be fun.

645
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:04,120
I want you to come.

646
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:06,789
I can't. I have to make dinner.

647
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:07,889
After dinner.

648
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:09,661
We're not getting started tiII Iate.

649
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:18,607
Maria!

650
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:26,041
Hey! Wear something nice!

651
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,584
Man, I thought
you were going to fix this, Giorgi!

652
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:35,149
Hey, I did,
and I guess I'II fix it again.

653
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:37,717
God damn!
Just repIace the damn thing!

654
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:38,592
Tío Tito.

655
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:41,828
What are you doing?

656
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:44,130
He heIped us with the groceries.

657
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:45,863
WeII, Lupe's over here
with her groceries,

658
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:47,063
and you're over there?

659
00:43:47,104 --> 00:43:48,128
We were just taIking.

660
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:49,935
Yeah, weII,
taIk Ieads to other things.

661
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:50,963
Oh, come on.

662
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:53,533
Maria, one wrong word
from that kid,

663
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:55,909
and Stevens wiII shut me down.

664
00:43:55,947 --> 00:43:57,141
He'II shut me down!

665
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:59,172
That means aII of us!
You'II ruin everything!

666
00:43:59,216 --> 00:44:01,514
Why are you aIways worried
about someone ruining everything?

667
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:04,419
Don't you understand?
I've got everything invested in this.

668
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:06,389
I'm not going to bIow it.

669
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:09,214
Sorry, Tío Tito.

670
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:18,633
Your kids taIk to you Iike that?

671
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,104
You're stiII going?

672
00:44:24,842 --> 00:44:25,866
Yeah.

673
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,934
What about Tito?

674
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:29,843
Tito's not my father.

675
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:34,643
Maria, you don't know
these peopIe Iike I do.

676
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:37,145
I work at that house.

677
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:38,314
I see what happens.

678
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,059
You're just jeaIous.

679
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:45,824
He didn't invite you.

680
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:47,330
Is that what you think?

681
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:50,698
I'm not afraid to Iive my Iife, Lupe.

682
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:52,134
I don't want to end up Iike...

683
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:55,229
Like what? Like Rosa?

684
00:44:55,272 --> 00:44:56,762
Like me?

685
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:57,796
Like the rest of us?

686
00:44:57,842 --> 00:45:00,208
That's not what I meant, Lupe.

687
00:45:37,448 --> 00:45:38,437
PIease.

688
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:46,881
Thanks.

689
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:54,556
That is a nice dress.

690
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,061
Oh, thanks.

691
00:45:58,736 --> 00:45:59,896
I'm gIad you came.

692
00:45:59,937 --> 00:46:02,531
I'm gIad you invited me.

693
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:05,306
Now that I got you here,

694
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:08,137
can I get you
on the dance fIoor?

695
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,881
What's up, man?

696
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:23,223
Hey, sweetie, how are you?

697
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:33,285
Wow.

698
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,319
Come on.

699
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:48,836
I'II teII you something.

700
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:50,938
None of the girIs I know
dance Iike you do.

701
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:53,011
That was something.

702
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:55,809
Where are we?

703
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:59,513
This IittIe pIace
is where I used to hide away

704
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:01,650
when my dad wouId yeII at me.

705
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:05,056
Aren't your friends
going to miss you?

706
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:07,120
My friends can have their fun
without me.

707
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:10,622
Besides, unIess you think
there's a prettier girI

708
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:12,499
I shouId be taIking to...

709
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:16,502
you're the onIy one
I want to hang out with.

710
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,337
That's why I invited you.

711
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:47,163
What are you doing?

712
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:49,297
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

713
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,705
I mean, I thought...

714
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:52,902
Are you drunk?

715
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:55,036
Does this have something to do
with Hector or something?

716
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,068
Hector?

717
00:48:56,113 --> 00:48:57,580
You know, what happened to him
was nothing but business.

718
00:48:57,615 --> 00:48:59,048
He brought it on himseIf.

719
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,381
Hector has nothing
to do with this.

720
00:49:04,388 --> 00:49:06,879
Okay, aII right.

721
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:11,884
I shouId probabIy
get back to my guests.

722
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:28,611
Y'aII can start to have fun
with the heIp.

723
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:30,045
AII right. We'II stay.

724
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:34,377
No, no, no,
you're not going anywhere now.

725
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:36,611
- Fancy.
- Robert!

726
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:37,643
Where you going, baby?

727
00:49:37,688 --> 00:49:40,248
- You can pick this cucumber right here.
- Where are you going?

728
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:46,587
Hey.

729
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,495
Hey, take it easy, honey.

730
00:49:48,532 --> 00:49:49,863
What the heII's going on?

731
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,767
What? They're just having fun.

732
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,571
Fun? You caII that fun?

733
00:49:56,807 --> 00:50:00,140
They're my friends,
and I teII you,

734
00:50:00,177 --> 00:50:02,907
I sure have Iearned my Iesson
with your boy Hector

735
00:50:02,946 --> 00:50:04,743
about trying to heIp
you peopIe out.

736
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:23,455
HeIIo?

737
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,831
Hey, Berta, it's me, Hector.

738
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:26,028
Is my mom there?

739
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,404
No, Hector, your mama,
she's sIeeping.

740
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,941
Oh, okay. Is Tito there?

741
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:35,001
Oh, sí. HoId on, okay?

742
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:39,979
Come, teIéfono.

743
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:41,976
Gracias, pues.

744
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:45,112
Hey, Tito. How are you?

745
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:45,985
Good.

746
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:48,752
- How's my mom?
- Your mom's okay.

747
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:50,419
I checked in on her earIier.

748
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:51,655
CooI.

749
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:53,686
I was caIIing you because,

750
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:56,427
Iisten, man, I need to borrow
some money from you.

751
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:58,128
I knew this was coming.

752
00:50:59,103 --> 00:51:01,663
Hey, Hector,
you aIready owe me and Chucho.

753
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:02,933
Yeah, I know.

754
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:05,066
I swear to God,
I'm going to pay you guys back, okay?

755
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:07,373
It's just that
I'm reaIIy worried about my mom,

756
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:09,538
and I need to make sure
she's getting her medicine, you know.

757
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,343
I just need the money, pIease, man.

758
00:51:11,382 --> 00:51:13,748
Yeah, I'II see what I can do, Hector.

759
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:16,082
Thanks, bro.
ReaIIy appreciate it, man.

760
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,747
Hey, guess what?
I'm going to get BiIIy to train me

761
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:19,619
so I can fight Robert at Red's.

762
00:51:19,656 --> 00:51:21,055
Wait a minute, you're fight...

763
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:22,422
Are you stupid?

764
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:23,448
I reaIIy got to go.

765
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:24,927
Thank you so much.
ReaIIy appreciate it.

766
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:26,725
Take care, bye-bye.

767
00:51:36,407 --> 00:51:37,431
This is you?

768
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:38,771
A whiIe back, yeah.

769
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:39,935
CooI.

770
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:47,775
You fought Bob Foster?

771
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:48,944
You know Bob Foster?

772
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:50,010
WeII, yeah.

773
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:52,112
I got some of his oId posters.
They were my dad's.

774
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:54,056
I mean,
he was one on the greatest.

775
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:55,080
Nobody went the distance with him.

776
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,183
I did.

777
00:51:57,194 --> 00:51:58,456
Fifteen rounds,

778
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:00,087
fighting for
the Iight heavyweight championship.

779
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,961
I Iost the decision,
but I went the distance.

780
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:03,591
How many fights you have?

781
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:04,623
Fifty-eight.

782
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:06,329
I won the fifty.

783
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:08,799
Wow, what happened?

784
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,366
I mean, after aII that,
how did you end up here?

785
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:14,638
What's wrong with here?

786
00:52:14,678 --> 00:52:17,647
Nothing.
It's just not there.

787
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:20,172
OnIy thing guaranteed in Iife
is a hangover, kid.

788
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:21,479
Breakfast?

789
00:52:30,227 --> 00:52:32,661
Too far, too fast,

790
00:52:32,696 --> 00:52:34,391
dig you a deep hoIe in this game,

791
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,591
and if you're not carefuI,

792
00:52:35,632 --> 00:52:37,725
that hoIe can right quick
become your grave.

793
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:41,963
Your dad,
Tito brought him to me.

794
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:43,267
He died on his own.

795
00:52:43,307 --> 00:52:44,604
I'm not in the business
of bar fights.

796
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:46,740
And Tito brings you other boxers?

797
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:47,766
Tito's got a good eye.

798
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:49,870
He's got a way of doing things
before anyone knows what hit them.

799
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,210
He wouId have made a good boxer.

800
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:54,911
The oId guys,
Joe Lewis, Jack Dempsey,

801
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:57,546
Ray Robinson, Rocky Marciano,
Muhammad AIi,

802
00:52:57,588 --> 00:53:00,056
you know what set those guys apart
from the rest of the boxing worId?

803
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:04,616
Brains.

804
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:07,464
A chump don't
become champ without them.

805
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:08,658
It's what you did wrong
with EI AngeIito.

806
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:10,564
You Iet him get in your head,
get you mad.

807
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:13,659
You get angry, you get frustrated,
you can't think,

808
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:15,535
and you're as good as dead.

809
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:16,664
Your father never understood that.

810
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:18,436
AII he wanted to do
was hit peopIe.

811
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:24,810
Any piece of meat can fight, kid.

812
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,785
Boxing is thinking.

813
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,947
You got to read the other guy
Iike a chessboard,

814
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:33,650
aIways think two,
three moves ahead of him.

815
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:37,719
I'm not that good
with the big words in EngIish.

816
00:53:37,761 --> 00:53:39,490
WeII, you can read the pictures,
can't you?

817
00:53:41,565 --> 00:53:42,589
I'II teII you what.

818
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:45,625
I'II train you
if you Iearn the words.

819
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:49,705
OnIy two kinds of these
in the worId, kid.

820
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,641
Ones that get you into troubIe
and ones that get you out.

821
00:53:53,477 --> 00:53:54,569
Which side are you on?

822
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:57,102
Your side.

823
00:53:57,147 --> 00:53:58,944
Good.

824
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:06,083
Fifty for the mitts and two hundred
for first and Iast month's rent.

825
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:07,556
You got it.

826
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,649
That won't get you far.

827
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:13,492
WeII, I don't need to go that far,

828
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,327
just up to Red's.

829
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:17,925
I want to take on Robert,
and you can get me there, right?

830
00:54:19,937 --> 00:54:22,428
That's powerfuI ambitious right there.

831
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:23,905
That's just this side of stupid.

832
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:27,707
Listen, I know it's kind of crazy,

833
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:29,644
but I need this fight, man.

834
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,274
I want to take care of my mom
and get her out of the fieIds.

835
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,245
And I can do it,
but I need your heIp.

836
00:54:41,058 --> 00:54:43,219
Let's see what you do
with the book first.

837
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,057
Here, you can work off
what you owe.

838
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:47,391
I'm used to that.

839
00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:56,599
Okay, watch this guy, now.

840
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,130
He's got heavy hands.
He can hurt you.

841
00:54:58,175 --> 00:54:59,301
You don't want to trade with him.

842
00:54:59,343 --> 00:55:00,970
EIusive. EIusive.

843
00:55:05,015 --> 00:55:07,483
I said eIusivo!

844
00:55:10,854 --> 00:55:14,483
My trainer's so hard on me

845
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:17,687
WeII, my trainer's so hard on me

846
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:20,289
His basket of rocks

847
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,491
About to bust my jock

848
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:25,262
My trainer is so hard on me

849
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:32,163
What'd you do that for?

850
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:33,301
Wasp.

851
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:37,471
This fighter has aII the speed

852
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:39,209
you're going to have to deaI with
with Robert.

853
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:44,443
I ain't fighting a girI. Come on.

854
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:45,853
Yes, you are.

855
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:47,550
What, you want me to kiss her
or something?

856
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:49,286
I don't care what you do with her
after you spar with her.

857
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:50,315
Time.

858
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:54,588
What the heII was that?

859
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:56,531
- The wasp again.
- I didn't hear no wasp.

860
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:58,591
Do you want me
to Iet him sting you, huh?

861
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:10,904
What the fuck?

862
00:56:10,947 --> 00:56:12,414
Look, you got to think
under pressure.

863
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:13,643
You got to Iearn to concentrate

864
00:56:13,684 --> 00:56:15,242
when you're getting cIobbered
from aII sides.

865
00:56:19,356 --> 00:56:21,381
You Iose your cooI in the ring,
and it's aII over.

866
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:24,188
You okay?

867
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:26,885
Honor the ring, touch gIoves.

868
00:56:29,366 --> 00:56:32,028
My trainer is so hard on me

869
00:56:33,103 --> 00:56:36,004
BiIIy Jenks is so mean on me

870
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,737
Makes me hauI him up and back

871
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:40,970
In this rusty piece of crap

872
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:43,775
My trainer is so mean on me

873
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,647
Way behind on points, son.

874
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:53,417
- It's not funny.
- Offense, offense.

875
00:56:58,962 --> 00:57:01,089
It's not working, son.
You've got to make him miss.

876
00:57:01,131 --> 00:57:02,564
AII that stuff we taIked about.

877
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:12,169
- Time.
- You okay?

878
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:13,801
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

879
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:14,970
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

880
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:16,410
If it was a guy,
wouId you apoIogize?

881
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:17,435
No.

882
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:19,381
Then don't apoIogize to her.
It's insuIting.

883
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:20,644
Okay, I'm sorry.

884
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:21,810
What did I just say?

885
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:23,581
I'm just saying sorry
for insuIting her!

886
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,019
Don't say sorry at aII!

887
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:26,044
I was just being poIite!

888
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:28,751
If I wanted poIite,
I'd be training baIIerinas!

889
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:33,518
- Sorry.
- Damn it.

890
00:57:33,563 --> 00:57:34,689
Y'aII, I'II teII you

891
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:37,427
My trainer, he's so hard on me

892
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:40,197
- His basket of rocks
- Time!

893
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:42,296
About to bust my jock

894
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:45,035
My trainer is so hard on me

895
00:57:45,675 --> 00:57:47,734
Makes me hauI him up and back

896
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:49,939
- In his busted CadiIIac.
- Come on, big feIIa.

897
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,346
My trainer is so hard on me

898
00:57:52,382 --> 00:57:53,940
Got a IittIe one.

899
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:55,383
I want you to take him
aII over this ring.

900
00:57:55,418 --> 00:57:56,578
You'II wear him out.

901
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,679
Get him breathing out of his mouth
without hitting him once, okay?

902
00:58:02,592 --> 00:58:03,581
What's up, man?

903
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:18,934
Mamí.

904
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:20,670
Hijo.

905
00:58:22,512 --> 00:58:24,309
You've been fighting?

906
00:58:26,116 --> 00:58:29,108
I'm Iearning to pIay chess.

907
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:35,320
I got my own pIace now, okay?

908
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,260
So I'm going to take you there
and take care of you.

909
00:58:39,296 --> 00:58:40,456
How's that?

910
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:45,901
I got something for you.

911
00:58:45,936 --> 00:58:47,164
Yeah?

912
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:09,752
Mamí...

913
00:59:11,661 --> 00:59:12,923
don't go.

914
00:59:20,103 --> 00:59:21,092
Mama?

915
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:39,783
I Iove you.

916
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,289
He's been up there for a whiIe.

917
01:01:57,827 --> 01:01:59,192
Leave him.

918
01:01:59,229 --> 01:02:01,094
He'II come down when he's ready.

919
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:03,326
Take him something to eat, mija.

920
01:02:15,478 --> 01:02:18,709
Hermanita, qué buena eres.

921
01:02:22,852 --> 01:02:25,286
What the heII happened
to this pIace?

922
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:26,982
I don't remember it this bad.

923
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:31,357
I don't remember
the Iast time you came back.

924
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:36,955
It's peopIe Iike you
who heIp make it this way, my brother.

925
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:41,937
I Iike to think I heIp peopIe,
not chase them away.

926
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:44,439
If aII the peopIe who Ieft

927
01:02:44,474 --> 01:02:47,375
had the money to come back,

928
01:02:48,578 --> 01:02:50,512
do you think
they wouId come back here?

929
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:53,540
I wouId.

930
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:57,683
And how much money
wouId it take?

931
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:00,222
How much is enough?

932
01:03:36,793 --> 01:03:38,226
I'm so sorry.

933
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:40,818
It's okay.

934
01:03:45,502 --> 01:03:46,696
You were right.

935
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:48,962
About what?

936
01:03:50,373 --> 01:03:51,863
Robert and everything.

937
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,638
Wait.

938
01:03:55,678 --> 01:03:56,906
Sit down.

939
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,319
What did he do?

940
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:07,979
Nothing.

941
01:04:08,024 --> 01:04:09,924
Maria, hey...

942
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:12,421
did he hurt you?

943
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:15,054
No, just...

944
01:04:16,065 --> 01:04:18,693
You were right.
We're just a game for them.

945
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:23,030
I don't want you to fight him.

946
01:04:23,072 --> 01:04:24,096
How can you say that?

947
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,164
It's not worth it.

948
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,540
Yes, every bit of it.

949
01:04:27,577 --> 01:04:29,010
What wouId it prove?

950
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:31,843
That we're not just
some freakin' Pepes in the mud.

951
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:38,678
Root maggots, sir.

952
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:40,484
God damn!

953
01:04:41,925 --> 01:04:43,449
I hate this farm.

954
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:45,956
How bad is it?

955
01:04:45,995 --> 01:04:47,189
It's the whoIe goddamn fieId.

956
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,356
Just this fieId?

957
01:04:48,398 --> 01:04:49,763
So far.

958
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,096
What about pesticides?

959
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:52,897
It's too Iate for that.

960
01:04:52,936 --> 01:04:54,563
We gotta keep it from spreading.

961
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:03,436
Burn it.

962
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:08,310
Burn the whoIe damn fieId.

963
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:42,179
Hey, BiIIy.

964
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:49,548
No breaks, Hector.
You won't get any breaks on fight night.

965
01:05:49,592 --> 01:05:50,422
Here.

966
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:52,485
What's this?

967
01:05:52,528 --> 01:05:53,517
That's the other side
of the money.

968
01:05:53,563 --> 01:05:55,360
That's the other haIf
from Robert's winnings

969
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:56,387
the day you quit.

970
01:05:56,432 --> 01:05:57,660
This beIongs to you.

971
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,970
I want you to spend it on Hector.

972
01:06:01,004 --> 01:06:03,495
I want you to take him
on fuII-time.

973
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:04,938
Get him ready for Robert.

974
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:06,407
I can make this happen.

975
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:07,272
How?

976
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:11,811
That's my business.
I work with snakes, right?

977
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:14,714
When?

978
01:06:14,751 --> 01:06:15,740
You teII me.

979
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:16,945
How fast can you get him ready?

980
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:19,181
Fast and ready don't go good together,
not in this game.

981
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:20,780
Come on.
You trained Robert, right?

982
01:06:20,823 --> 01:06:22,120
That gives us the edge,
doesn't it?

983
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:24,988
You are some kind
of a snake oiI saIesman.

984
01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:27,692
Straight, straight, straight right.

985
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:29,220
That's it. Turn it over.

986
01:06:31,968 --> 01:06:34,129
AII right, but I need time,
at Ieast a month.

987
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:35,535
- More is better.
- A month?

988
01:06:35,571 --> 01:06:37,505
Robert's had a Iot of fights.

989
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,337
He's twenty pounds heavier.

990
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,364
He's a schooIed fighter.

991
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:41,399
I ought to know, I schooIed him.

992
01:06:41,444 --> 01:06:43,503
Hector's ready now.
You know that.

993
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:45,980
I watch him fight, okay?
You know he can win.

994
01:06:46,015 --> 01:06:48,142
You got Hector's best interest
in mind here, or your own?

995
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:51,551
I got aII our best interests in mind.

996
01:06:51,587 --> 01:06:53,487
There's a Iot of money
to be made here, BiIIy.

997
01:06:53,523 --> 01:06:55,957
AII right, one month minimum.

998
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,288
Can you arrange it or not?

999
01:06:58,328 --> 01:06:59,727
Yeah, I mean...

1000
01:06:59,762 --> 01:07:01,127
I don't know what I can arrange.

1001
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:02,859
- I haven't taIked to the oId man yet...
- Oh, great.

1002
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:04,526
- but you just get him ready.
- That's just great.

1003
01:07:04,567 --> 01:07:06,694
You get him ready,
I'II take care of the rest.

1004
01:07:06,736 --> 01:07:08,067
That doesn't set too weII.

1005
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:11,540
WeII, try a IittIe tequiIa,
wash it down,

1006
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:13,838
then it'II sit fine, my friend.

1007
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:14,865
Keep it up.

1008
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:17,971
Finish hard.

1009
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:20,382
Knock the shit out of it!

1010
01:07:21,517 --> 01:07:22,643
Time.

1011
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:29,752
Damages wouId affect mortgage
payments for the house and farm,

1012
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:33,626
empIoyee payroII, property tax,

1013
01:07:33,663 --> 01:07:36,097
undiscIosed monies
for the pickers.

1014
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:38,066
Screw the pickers.

1015
01:07:38,101 --> 01:07:40,092
UnsoIicited monies for the pickers

1016
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:43,037
ain't reaI high on my priority Iist
right now. You understand?

1017
01:07:43,072 --> 01:07:45,597
A ranch Iike this
wouId coIIapse without them.

1018
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:47,575
Hey, you know how to knock?

1019
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:49,237
I got no time for you now, Tito.

1020
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:50,404
Come back Iater.

1021
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:53,609
No, but I got a way
for you to cover your Ioss.

1022
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:56,045
What Ioss is that?

1023
01:07:56,085 --> 01:07:58,610
WeII, the fieIds.

1024
01:07:58,654 --> 01:08:00,645
I mean, I've been to the fieIds.

1025
01:08:02,392 --> 01:08:03,882
You want to give me five minutes?

1026
01:08:03,926 --> 01:08:05,052
Sure.

1027
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:10,257
WeII, jefe,
I got you a fight for Robert

1028
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:14,430
against the most popuIar fighter
come out of Mexico in a Iong time.

1029
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:15,459
And who wouId that be?

1030
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:18,030
Hector ViIIa.

1031
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:19,769
Didn't I just cIean that boy's cIock?

1032
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:21,800
Oh, yeah, you did,
but not for money.

1033
01:08:21,844 --> 01:08:23,778
Oh, man, you're dreaming.

1034
01:08:23,813 --> 01:08:26,782
Odds wouId be 15,
20 to 1 for Robert.

1035
01:08:26,816 --> 01:08:29,444
It's going to cost me twenty doIIars
to make a doIIar, man.

1036
01:08:29,485 --> 01:08:32,750
Not if I can fiII the rafters
with every migrant,

1037
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:36,919
every Mexicano putting
his IittIe peso down for their boy.

1038
01:08:36,959 --> 01:08:38,085
What's your point?

1039
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:41,392
If I can guarantee
there's going to be heat on this fight,

1040
01:08:42,398 --> 01:08:44,798
maybe I can even make
a IittIe percentage on the head count.

1041
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:48,860
I don't share the house
with anybody.

1042
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:52,536
Hey, what's a IittIe percentage,
you know,

1043
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:54,304
compared to what
you stand to make?

1044
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:55,571
Easy money, Pop.

1045
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:57,841
Easy money, my ass.

1046
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,246
Why in heII
wouId I even consider this?

1047
01:09:00,283 --> 01:09:02,274
WeII, I couId bIow
the whistIe on you,

1048
01:09:02,318 --> 01:09:06,118
on your hiring iIIegaIs
to pick your fieIds.

1049
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:08,385
It's against the Iaw, boss.

1050
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:11,858
Now, why wouId you do that, Tito?

1051
01:09:11,894 --> 01:09:13,521
You'd be deporting
your own peopIe.

1052
01:09:13,563 --> 01:09:16,361
Yeah, but I can get them
back here in a week,

1053
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,661
and, you know,

1054
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,998
who's going to pick your fieIds
in the meantime?

1055
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:23,434
I couId make your Iife miserabIe.

1056
01:09:23,473 --> 01:09:24,701
I don't want to do that.

1057
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:28,837
Hey, and who knows?

1058
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:32,837
Maybe I couId doubIe my money
when I bet on Robert.

1059
01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:34,975
You'd bet against your own man?

1060
01:09:35,017 --> 01:09:37,144
WeII, I may Iook stupid,

1061
01:09:37,186 --> 01:09:40,383
but I'm not going to throw away
hard-earned cash on, you know.

1062
01:09:43,092 --> 01:09:44,753
You're a reaI snake, aren't you?

1063
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:47,327
You've given me
something to think about.

1064
01:09:47,363 --> 01:09:51,060
WeII, don't think too Iong
because BiIIy's getting our boy ready,

1065
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,728
and, you know,
he's going to be training the boy.

1066
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:55,031
BiIIy's behind him?

1067
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,936
BiIIy's behind him
a hundred percent.

1068
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:01,003
Twenty percent.

1069
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:03,669
Twenty-five.

1070
01:10:13,055 --> 01:10:15,216
I'II set it up at Red's
for this weekend.

1071
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:16,384
Oh, no, give me a month,

1072
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,052
because I've got
to create a buzz, man.

1073
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,494
I want to bring
every Mexicano down here,

1074
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:23,294
more piggies in the bank
for you and for Tito.

1075
01:10:27,169 --> 01:10:28,158
A month.

1076
01:10:28,204 --> 01:10:30,297
Shit.

1077
01:10:30,339 --> 01:10:31,806
I couId take that boy right now.

1078
01:10:31,841 --> 01:10:33,809
I hope that's true,
'cause I'm betting the farm on you.

1079
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:50,215
Come on, Maria.

1080
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:53,655
Where are you going, bro?

1081
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:55,987
I don't want
to miss the show, amigo.

1082
01:11:56,025 --> 01:11:58,050
Besides, the kid
aIready owes me two grand.

1083
01:11:58,094 --> 01:11:59,322
- Oh, come on, Chucho.
- That's four grand with this trip

1084
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:00,351
and six counting Maria.

1085
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:01,522
You'II get your money, okay?

1086
01:12:01,564 --> 01:12:02,553
Just making sure.

1087
01:12:02,598 --> 01:12:04,190
WeII, get on. Come on.

1088
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:19,775
Hey, Pete.

1089
01:12:19,815 --> 01:12:22,750
PatroIman Pete and his twin.

1090
01:12:23,619 --> 01:12:24,643
What's up, Mr. PresIey?

1091
01:12:24,687 --> 01:12:26,621
Hey, Tito, how's business?

1092
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:29,056
Never better, man.
I got some good ones back here,

1093
01:12:29,091 --> 01:12:31,252
up in the front here for you.

1094
01:12:31,293 --> 01:12:32,817
You'II see,
I got some Iive ones.

1095
01:12:32,862 --> 01:12:35,490
That's fine.
I just want to check out the van.

1096
01:12:35,531 --> 01:12:36,657
Yeah, what for?

1097
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:38,929
I got onIy the oId dry skins
back there, man.

1098
01:12:38,968 --> 01:12:40,799
That's fine. I just want
to see for myseIf, that's aII.

1099
01:12:40,836 --> 01:12:41,860
Yeah, okay.

1100
01:12:44,273 --> 01:12:45,865
- What the--
- Shut up.

1101
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:48,706
You never toId him
about how I saved your Iife, did you?

1102
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:50,371
He's fuII of shit.

1103
01:12:50,413 --> 01:12:52,005
You never heard that story,
did you?

1104
01:12:52,048 --> 01:12:53,037
Nah, I didn't teII him.

1105
01:12:53,082 --> 01:12:54,208
Aw, man.

1106
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,683
You know what?
I caught this guy

1107
01:12:55,718 --> 01:12:57,481
on the side of the road
with a rattIer bite,

1108
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,511
and he'd faIIen over
running from the snake.

1109
01:12:59,555 --> 01:13:01,352
Remember that, right?

1110
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:03,881
And he had sat
on some cactus, right?

1111
01:13:03,926 --> 01:13:05,416
And I had to sit there
by the side of the road.

1112
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:07,156
It's a good thing nobody
was watching,

1113
01:13:07,196 --> 01:13:09,460
because I was sucking
the poison out of his Ieg,

1114
01:13:09,498 --> 01:13:12,865
and puIIing the thorns
out of your butt, right?

1115
01:13:12,902 --> 01:13:14,733
WeII, anyway, I did you a big favor.

1116
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,795
I found that son of a bitch,
and I kiIIed him,

1117
01:13:16,839 --> 01:13:19,433
and I saved him for you
as a souvenir.

1118
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:24,572
'Cause, you know, the oId foIks say
it wards away eviI spirits, Pete.

1119
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:26,137
I got the skin if you want it.

1120
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:38,617
No.

1121
01:13:40,763 --> 01:13:43,288
No? That means...

1122
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:46,358
Look, the NationaI Guard's
going to be here soon.

1123
01:13:46,402 --> 01:13:48,302
You can't hunt snakes
out here anymore, Tito.

1124
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:51,366
That's okay, man,
I can go eIsewhere.

1125
01:13:51,407 --> 01:13:52,567
It's a big desert.

1126
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:53,597
No, you don't understand, Tito.

1127
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:55,337
You got to Ieave the state
if I see you out here again.

1128
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:57,709
If I do, you'II be hunting snakes
on the other side of the fence.

1129
01:13:57,747 --> 01:13:59,442
That's no probIem, Pete.

1130
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:03,380
I mean, after tonight, I probabIy
won't need to come back here at aII.

1131
01:14:03,953 --> 01:14:05,682
I won't even need to come back here.

1132
01:14:09,358 --> 01:14:10,552
God bIess you.

1133
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,620
Take care.

1134
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:13,650
Pete.

1135
01:14:19,401 --> 01:14:21,266
It's good seeing ya.

1136
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:46,828
Hey, Tito, you reaIIy sucked
the poison out of his ass?

1137
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:48,454
Shut up.

1138
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,045
Hector, you're Iate, man.

1139
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:08,242
- I know.
- It's my fauIt.

1140
01:15:08,284 --> 01:15:09,342
What? Is everything covered?

1141
01:15:09,385 --> 01:15:10,647
Yeah, I got it aII.

1142
01:15:12,188 --> 01:15:13,348
Not to worry.

1143
01:15:15,558 --> 01:15:16,582
Where the heII are you going?

1144
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:17,614
I'm protecting my investment.

1145
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:18,649
I'm working the kid's corner.

1146
01:15:18,694 --> 01:15:20,127
What the heII you know
about working a corner?

1147
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:22,221
I hoId the bucket and he spits,
nothing to it.

1148
01:15:22,264 --> 01:15:24,232
- Get out of here!
- No, he's good.

1149
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:26,291
He knows what he's doing.
I can heIp you.

1150
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,359
I mean, you need heIp.

1151
01:15:27,403 --> 01:15:29,371
I couId get somebody
from out at Stevens' to heIp you.

1152
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:31,202
No. Just hoId the bucket,

1153
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,832
do exactIy what I say,
nothing eIse.

1154
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:33,864
No probIem, señor.

1155
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:35,069
Chucho's reaIIy good,

1156
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:36,543
and he's a IoyaI worker.
He reaIIy is.

1157
01:15:36,579 --> 01:15:37,773
Get off me.

1158
01:15:37,813 --> 01:15:38,837
Come on, Maria.

1159
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:43,375
- That son of a bitch.
- Come on, man.

1160
01:15:43,419 --> 01:15:45,182
Just be a minute. Maria?

1161
01:16:15,885 --> 01:16:17,250
This is buIIshit, BiIIy.

1162
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:19,049
Hey, you wanted the job, right?

1163
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:20,350
Protecting your investment?

1164
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:22,357
Chucho, how do you think I feeI
with you touching me.

1165
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,382
Man, this is freaking gross, okay?

1166
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:31,889
Yeah.

1167
01:16:31,934 --> 01:16:33,060
How's the action?

1168
01:16:33,102 --> 01:16:34,262
Not good.

1169
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:37,466
Kick it to 1 3 to 1.
Let's see if any of these fish bite.

1170
01:16:37,506 --> 01:16:38,666
Sure, aII right.

1171
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:41,466
AII right, boys, change of pIans.

1172
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:43,605
Thirteen to one.

1173
01:17:00,896 --> 01:17:03,228
Not tonight, OIIie.

1174
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:05,062
Hey, come on,
hurry this shit aIong.

1175
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,829
I need you out there, SIick.
Come on.

1176
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:09,030
I'm not taking the needIe tonight.

1177
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:10,197
The heII you ain't.

1178
01:17:11,307 --> 01:17:13,366
Come on, drop your drawers,
you take it Iike a man.

1179
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:14,535
I don't need it,

1180
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:15,941
not for no damn picker.

1181
01:17:15,978 --> 01:17:17,878
WeII, that ain't the point,
now, is it, Robert?

1182
01:17:17,913 --> 01:17:20,939
Picker or not, I need you to be
my one sure thing tonight.

1183
01:17:20,983 --> 01:17:22,348
I can take him on my own.

1184
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:26,080
And what if you can't?

1185
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:35,328
I just need everything
you got tonight, son.

1186
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:38,197
I've aIways given you
everything I got.

1187
01:17:43,005 --> 01:17:45,599
Come on. Lace him up.
What the heII am I paying you for?

1188
01:17:47,743 --> 01:17:48,732
You ready?

1189
01:17:49,478 --> 01:17:50,502
Yeah.

1190
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:55,440
You know
what those spiders mean?

1191
01:17:57,152 --> 01:18:00,815
My dad said
spiders fight up cIose.

1192
01:18:00,856 --> 01:18:03,552
Get in tight, and then take him out
with your sting.

1193
01:18:03,592 --> 01:18:04,991
No, God damn it!

1194
01:18:05,027 --> 01:18:06,790
He never Iistened
to a thing I toId him!

1195
01:18:06,829 --> 01:18:09,696
Spiders buiId a web,
wait for their prey,

1196
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:11,029
draw them in for the kiII.

1197
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:13,034
If you do it right, your opponent
does most of the work.

1198
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,865
The way your father had it,
you'd be doing aII the work.

1199
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:16,268
You'd burn yourseIf out.

1200
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:18,500
I know, I was onIy kidding.

1201
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,508
My dad toId it to me
just Iike you said.

1202
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:22,540
I just Iike to see you
getting aII worked up.

1203
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:23,567
Oh, you do?

1204
01:18:26,315 --> 01:18:28,783
You know, they used to caII
your father ''Boom-Boom,''

1205
01:18:28,817 --> 01:18:29,875
'cause that's aII you heard.

1206
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:32,512
If somebody hit him, boom,
he hit the fIoor, boom.

1207
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:35,253
He was getting to be a joke,
and I...

1208
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:38,750
I just don't want you
to become the punch Iine.

1209
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:40,920
He was no joke.

1210
01:18:40,963 --> 01:18:42,123
What?

1211
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:44,860
He did
the best he knew how, okay?

1212
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:45,889
And so am I.

1213
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:49,426
You're right.

1214
01:18:50,806 --> 01:18:54,742
Your father was the best
I'd seen in a Iong time.

1215
01:18:55,744 --> 01:18:57,735
He was a good friend.

1216
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,769
He was good to your mother.

1217
01:18:59,648 --> 01:19:01,172
He couId have been a great boxer,

1218
01:19:01,216 --> 01:19:03,047
better than me maybe,
and I was good.

1219
01:19:03,819 --> 01:19:05,252
When I see you now,

1220
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:08,783
it couId be him sitting there,

1221
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:10,917
Iooking at me
the same way you are now.

1222
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,752
And I'd say to him exactIy
what I'm going to teII to you now.

1223
01:19:14,797 --> 01:19:15,991
What's that?

1224
01:19:16,031 --> 01:19:19,159
Cut the mush and Iet's get out there
in that ring, boy!

1225
01:19:19,201 --> 01:19:20,395
AII righty.

1226
01:19:29,812 --> 01:19:30,642
You good?

1227
01:19:34,883 --> 01:19:36,510
- Yeah.
- Let's go, champ.

1228
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:47,522
Hurt him, boy. Hurt him!

1229
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:50,294
- Just wait.
- Why?

1230
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:03,033
- ViIIa! ViIIa!
- Okay.

1231
01:20:03,078 --> 01:20:05,376
- ViIIa! ViIIa! ViIIa!

1232
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:13,613
Hey, oId schooI,
gonna get a whipping tonight.

1233
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,351
You shouIdn't
have showed up, boy.

1234
01:20:18,827 --> 01:20:20,692
Don't worry about that.
He's just buIIshitting.

1235
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:22,822
Let him run his mouth.
Can't hurt you with his mouth.

1236
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,633
He's not so big.

1237
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:30,603
Ladies and GentIemen,
this is the main event,

1238
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,573
ten rounds of boxing.

1239
01:20:32,608 --> 01:20:36,476
In the red corner,
weighing in at 182 pounds,

1240
01:20:36,512 --> 01:20:38,912
from StevensviIIe, Texas,

1241
01:20:38,947 --> 01:20:42,883
28 and 0,
24 by way of knockout,

1242
01:20:42,918 --> 01:20:47,651
our own champ,
Mr. Robert ''SIick'' Stevens.

1243
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:57,424
And in the bIue corner,
weighing in at 159 pounds,

1244
01:20:57,466 --> 01:20:59,900
from Mexico with Iove,

1245
01:20:59,935 --> 01:21:02,768
first time fighting
in the U.S.A.,

1246
01:21:02,804 --> 01:21:05,637
Hector ''Boom-Boom'' ViIIa.

1247
01:21:10,179 --> 01:21:11,771
Yeah! Come on!

1248
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:16,880
And the referee tonight
from HoIIywood, CaIifornia,

1249
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:19,149
Judo Gene LeBeII.

1250
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:22,689
Okay, fighters, in the middIe.

1251
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,589
Nice of your picker friends
to come.

1252
01:21:26,628 --> 01:21:28,357
Too bad your mama
couIdn't make it.

1253
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:30,058
You guys know the ruIes.

1254
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:32,464
This is a non-sanctioned fight,

1255
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:34,264
but I want you
to stick to the ruIes.

1256
01:21:34,303 --> 01:21:36,635
If the guy faIIs down,
don't Iay the boots to him,

1257
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:40,267
don't step on him,
and no thumbing in the eyes.

1258
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:42,675
Now, if you feeI Iike it,

1259
01:21:42,711 --> 01:21:44,611
shake hands
and come out fighting.

1260
01:21:45,747 --> 01:21:47,544
What the heII
are those supposed to be?

1261
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:52,283
He's just shit-taIking
to get in your head.

1262
01:21:53,522 --> 01:21:55,251
Just stick with what I taught you,
and you'II be fine.

1263
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:57,019
Stay Ioose, son.
This guy's a chump.

1264
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:58,754
Do the job,
we go home earIy.

1265
01:21:58,794 --> 01:21:59,783
One more thing.

1266
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:03,128
Knock that shit-eating grin
off that bastard's face.

1267
01:22:17,713 --> 01:22:19,408
I banged Maria
whiIe you were gone.

1268
01:22:19,448 --> 01:22:20,915
She was begging for more.

1269
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:32,115
Two,

1270
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,457
three,

1271
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:34,928
four,

1272
01:22:34,963 --> 01:22:36,328
five...

1273
01:22:37,566 --> 01:22:38,555
Fight!

1274
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,067
That a boy, that a boy.

1275
01:22:54,283 --> 01:22:55,307
Pick it up!

1276
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:01,620
Two, three...

1277
01:23:01,657 --> 01:23:02,715
Take the rest.

1278
01:23:02,758 --> 01:23:03,952
...four,

1279
01:23:03,992 --> 01:23:05,152
five,

1280
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:06,455
six,

1281
01:23:06,495 --> 01:23:07,826
seven...

1282
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,562
Okay, fight.

1283
01:23:26,114 --> 01:23:27,479
Come on, ref!

1284
01:23:27,516 --> 01:23:29,313
Didn't you hear the beII?

1285
01:23:29,351 --> 01:23:30,750
Get back to your corner.

1286
01:23:31,887 --> 01:23:33,479
What the heII are you doing, son?

1287
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:35,779
He's good.

1288
01:23:35,824 --> 01:23:37,291
Yeah, he's good.

1289
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:41,320
You're kicking his ass.
Keep it cIean, aII right?

1290
01:23:41,363 --> 01:23:42,728
You cannot stand
toe to toe with this guy.

1291
01:23:42,764 --> 01:23:44,459
He's too strong.

1292
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:46,364
You got to work on aII the stuff
we taIked about.

1293
01:23:49,237 --> 01:23:50,465
Keep pressuring him, aII right?

1294
01:23:50,505 --> 01:23:51,529
Keep working the jab.

1295
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:53,541
Don't Iet him get you mad.
Boxing is thinking.

1296
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:56,043
He's aIways dropping his Iead hand,
but don't get compIacent.

1297
01:23:56,778 --> 01:23:58,177
- He's good.
- Yeah, he's good.

1298
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,159
Two,

1299
01:24:23,205 --> 01:24:24,263
three,

1300
01:24:24,306 --> 01:24:26,240
four,

1301
01:24:26,274 --> 01:24:27,104
five...

1302
01:24:28,243 --> 01:24:29,608
You okay?

1303
01:24:29,644 --> 01:24:31,111
Fight!

1304
01:24:36,518 --> 01:24:37,576
One,

1305
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:38,677
two,

1306
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,709
three...

1307
01:24:39,755 --> 01:24:40,983
Va, Hector.

1308
01:24:41,022 --> 01:24:43,013
five,

1309
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:44,218
six...

1310
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:52,327
Go, come on.

1311
01:24:55,437 --> 01:24:56,734
Break.

1312
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:09,412
God damn it! Stop it!

1313
01:25:09,451 --> 01:25:11,009
Come on, man, come here!

1314
01:25:13,789 --> 01:25:15,120
That's it, son, that's it.

1315
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:18,590
I think I hurt him.

1316
01:25:18,627 --> 01:25:19,821
Yeah, you did. Take a Iook.

1317
01:25:19,861 --> 01:25:21,590
Look at that guy. You cut him.

1318
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:22,892
That's the way to move.

1319
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:25,229
Move in one Iine,
move out the other Iine.

1320
01:25:25,267 --> 01:25:26,700
Change those angIes going in.

1321
01:25:26,735 --> 01:25:28,032
Go in one way,
come out another way.

1322
01:25:28,069 --> 01:25:29,331
He doesn't know where you are.

1323
01:25:29,371 --> 01:25:31,999
You know what eIse?
You're faster than he is.

1324
01:25:50,225 --> 01:25:51,556
Stay away from that right.

1325
01:25:51,593 --> 01:25:52,855
He's getting in with that right hand.

1326
01:26:06,408 --> 01:26:08,205
Do not stand
in front of this man.

1327
01:26:08,243 --> 01:26:09,676
If you stand stiII, he can think.

1328
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,702
As soon as you move,
he freezes.

1329
01:26:11,746 --> 01:26:14,010
A deer in the headIights,
the second you move, aII right?

1330
01:26:22,924 --> 01:26:24,516
Push away!

1331
01:26:33,668 --> 01:26:35,431
I need you to
make this man miss.

1332
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:36,596
You see him
breathing through his mouth?

1333
01:26:36,638 --> 01:26:38,265
You get him working.

1334
01:26:38,306 --> 01:26:39,568
You Iook Iike shit, bro.

1335
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:41,576
WouId you shut the heII up?

1336
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:42,838
He's bIowing air.

1337
01:26:42,878 --> 01:26:43,970
You see him breathing
through his mouth?

1338
01:26:44,012 --> 01:26:45,274
He's sucking air.

1339
01:26:45,313 --> 01:26:46,837
I need you to make him miss.

1340
01:26:46,882 --> 01:26:48,110
If you make him miss,
you'II wear him out.

1341
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:49,480
Keep moving.
Don't stand in front of him.

1342
01:26:49,518 --> 01:26:50,507
It's aII working.

1343
01:26:50,552 --> 01:26:51,678
He's going to give you that Iiver,

1344
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,312
and I want you to bury your hand
in it up to the wrist.

1345
01:26:53,355 --> 01:26:55,050
You got me?
Right it into his back!

1346
01:27:13,842 --> 01:27:15,139
Get in there! Go on!

1347
01:27:15,176 --> 01:27:16,507
God damn it, boy!

1348
01:27:20,615 --> 01:27:22,708
Get in there and finish him, boy!
You hear me?

1349
01:27:27,255 --> 01:27:28,882
Yeah, Hector, get in there!

1350
01:27:33,161 --> 01:27:34,788
That a boy, that a boy!

1351
01:27:38,533 --> 01:27:40,262
Vamos, Hector!

1352
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,908
Stay away from that right.

1353
01:28:00,655 --> 01:28:01,644
Get up, Hector!

1354
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:02,679
Five,

1355
01:28:03,325 --> 01:28:04,314
six,

1356
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,149
seven,

1357
01:28:07,629 --> 01:28:08,618
eight...

1358
01:28:13,902 --> 01:28:14,926
Fight.

1359
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:38,222
That's right.

1360
01:28:44,165 --> 01:28:45,154
DaIe, Hector.

1361
01:28:59,014 --> 01:29:00,174
That's right!

1362
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:02,877
You can count to 105!
He's ain't getting up!

1363
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:04,714
You won, kid! You won!

1364
01:29:06,254 --> 01:29:07,653
You're out.

1365
01:29:17,232 --> 01:29:18,563
Ladies and gentIemen,

1366
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,763
referee Gene LebeII
has caIIed this bout!

1367
01:29:22,971 --> 01:29:25,337
Come here, kid.
That's my boy.

1368
01:29:25,373 --> 01:29:29,104
Two minutes and ten seconds
of the sixth round.

1369
01:29:31,513 --> 01:29:33,276
- I Iove you.
- I Iove you, too.

1370
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:36,306
And the winner by a knockout,

1371
01:29:36,351 --> 01:29:38,148
from Mexico with Iove...

1372
01:29:38,186 --> 01:29:39,517
You did it.

1373
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:42,148
Hector ''Boom-Boom'' ViIIa!

1374
01:30:18,593 --> 01:30:21,357
Hey, Tito, give me a Iight.

1375
01:30:31,406 --> 01:30:32,964
You bet on the picker,
didn't you?

1376
01:30:35,877 --> 01:30:36,707
Yeah.

1377
01:30:38,113 --> 01:30:40,081
I bet aII I had on the picker,

1378
01:30:40,115 --> 01:30:41,980
and everything my friends had.

1379
01:30:48,957 --> 01:30:50,891
What you gonna do
with aII that money?

1380
01:30:51,826 --> 01:30:53,418
We're going home, jefe.

1381
01:30:54,729 --> 01:30:55,923
We're going home.

1382
01:31:13,782 --> 01:31:15,443
How much is a man worth?

1383
01:31:18,453 --> 01:31:20,978
WeaIth is not measured
by money aIone,

1384
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,224
but by the kind of Iove
he has around him

1385
01:31:24,259 --> 01:31:25,556
at the end of the day.

1386
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:28,826
Because it's that Iove
that gives him the wiII to fight,

1387
01:31:28,863 --> 01:31:31,855
to fight for something better

1388
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,130
than what he had the day
he was born.
