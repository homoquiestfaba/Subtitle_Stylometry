1
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,826
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?!

2
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,131
- You're a punk, Sam!
- Get off.

3
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,396
I ought to kill you!
You fucking dickhead!

4
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,506
- I told you to never touch my camera!
- Stop!

5
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,973
Didn't I?! Fucker! You little wimp!
Bitch! Pussy! I told you!

6
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,276
I ought to fucking kill you!
And I will kill you, you little punk,

7
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,006
if I ever catch you fucking
with my camera again.

8
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,481
- He's so gonna cry.
- Step on him!

9
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,449
- Get out of my way!
- Relax, man.

10
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,420
Are you OK?

11
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,495
You ever stare at the ceiling
till it started looking kind of funny?

12
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,869
Like it was breathing.
Like it was saying something.

13
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,474
Like it was saying,
"Rocky,

14
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,010
you gotta do something
about what's been going on."

15
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,885
Something's gotta happen, Sam.

16
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,087
Something's gotta give.

17
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,820
We can call the police.

18
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,027
Police wouldn't do jack.

19
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,667
I wish I was bigger.

20
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,798
I'm bigger.

21
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,904
Not to mention the fact
that I'm smarter.

22
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,540
If you do something,
he'll just get you.

23
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:33,269
Did you ever used to get me
when we used to play hide-and-seek?

24
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,573
- No.
- He wouldn't have any better luck.

25
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,211
Wanna know my secret hiding spot?

26
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,388
The roof.

27
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,826
The disappearing man.

28
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,923
Exactly.

29
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,140
So high. Oh, my God.

30
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,509
Rocky's thinking about
doing something to George.

31
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,717
I don't get how the teachers

32
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,852
can just let him get away with that.

33
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,088
Teachers don't care.

34
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,954
They have him in detention
for 15 minutes for a week.

35
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,353
Something's gotta give.

36
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,394
If you could snap your fingers
right now,

37
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,196
and he would drop dead in his tracks,
would you do it?

38
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,074
Are we still on for Saturday?

39
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,814
Yeah, of course.

40
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,989
So, what are we gonna do?

41
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,656
I'll figure something out,

42
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,382
and I'll surprise you.

43
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,563
Hey, you know that fat kid, George,

44
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,037
who they keep holding back
from graduating middle school?

45
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,641
Yeah, I hate that guy.

46
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,435
He beat up Sam.

47
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,340
No.

48
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,674
Hey, you know
when we were at Rollins,

49
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,544
that crazy kid
chased me across the field

50
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,184
and cracked my head
open with a bat.

51
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,082
- Finally, an explanation.
- Yeah, anyway...

52
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,450
- He's a real pig.
- I say we smoke that ham.

53
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,920
Yeah? Make some
ham sandwiches?

54
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,617
Pork chop-ify him.
Spam-icize him.

55
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,595
- Link sausage-ize him!
- Squeal, piggy! Squeal!

56
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,961
No, screw that guy.

57
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,000
You'd really like to do that,
wouldn't you, Clyde?

58
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,365
- You're projecting, Marty.
- Projecting?

59
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,007
That's when you say something
that someone else...

60
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:47,077
You say that they want to do, when
you're the one who wants to do it.

61
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,770
No, no, no. That's good.
That's good.

62
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,347
Hold up, Rocky. Back up.
I got something for you.

63
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,075
Just a little...

64
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,811
- Oh, you son of a bitch!
- I was just projecting.

65
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,355
Oh, you asshole!

66
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,320
Later.

67
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,294
Wait up, man!

68
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,865
Let's go get some ice cream.

69
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,561
OK, Dave.

70
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,707
Hey!

71
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,264
Hey!

72
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,343
- Where were you guys?
- Get beat up today?

73
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,536
See any new scars?

74
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,541
- Got any more gum?
- I'm chewing the whole pack.

75
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,287
Why, you want some?

76
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,392
Tasty.

77
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,560
OK,

78
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:45,864
Jennifer Lopez or the girl
who sits behind you in school?

79
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,733
J. Lo.

80
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,645
OK, I think I got one.

81
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,515
Tie him to a tree,
pour some honey on his face,

82
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,309
and leave him there
all day and night.

83
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,611
- Why?
- It's for the bugs,

84
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,310
so they'd get on him
and bite him.

85
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,786
- No, we can't do that.
- Why not?

86
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,118
Well, what if a bear came?

87
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,294
Shut up.

88
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,266
You know,

89
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,834
if we hurt him,
we'd be just as bad as him.

90
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,269
So we need to hurt him
without really hurting him.

91
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,205
I mean, if you could think
of something like that, then...

92
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,208
Then what?

93
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,376
I don't know.

94
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,645
All right, Heather Locklear

95
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,016
or Shannen Doherty?

96
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,621
Don't know who
Heather Locklear is.

97
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,919
You don't...? Dude!

98
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,006
So, what do you say?

99
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,940
I think it's a totally wild plan.

100
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,283
It's also the only plan
my brother would agree to.

101
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,285
He's just a little fucking
Gandhi, isn't he?

102
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,958
Like a fucking white
Martin Luther King.

103
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,522
All we need now is a boat.

104
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,754
Hey, my neighbor's got a boat
in her back yard that she never uses.

105
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,331
- Does that mean you're in?
- Do you actually think he'll go for it?

106
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:25,595
Oh, please. George'll get a hard-on
as soon as he picks up the phone.

107
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,933
Rock will throw on some of
that "sweet boy" charm of his.

108
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,042
Kid's desperate. Stupid.
It's human nature.

109
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,681
All I know is, is I'm getting a hard-on
just thinking about it.

110
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,612
Your mom don't need
the car Saturday, does she?

111
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,220
The only thing my mom needs
on Saturdays is Valium.

112
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,189
What do you think, Clyde?

113
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:50,624
Do we want to give Georgie Porgie a
little taste of his own medicine? Huh?

114
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,525
Be some good, clean fun,
don't you think?

115
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,199
Yeah, he deserves it, doesn't he?

116
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,334
If there's one thing
that can't be argued,

117
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,767
it's that that fat freak deserves
whatever he's got coming to him.

118
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,902
Dude, what'd I tell you?

119
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,875
You don't smoke herb.

120
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,014
Yeah, so get it out of my face.

121
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,251
Faggot.

122
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,853
Clyde-o,

123
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,894
I'm just fucking with you.

124
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,566
You're not a faggot, all right?

125
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,737
OK?

126
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,869
Fist bump?

127
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,306
Fist bump?

128
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,843
OK, zero kilter.

129
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,608
Besides, I like your dads, Clyde.

130
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,685
I never knew any homosexual men
personally until I met them.

131
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,583
They're not so bad.

132
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,351
Don't you think so, Rocky?

133
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,340
Clyde, don't worry about Marty.

134
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,374
It's just B.S.

135
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,248
OK? Come on. It's B.S.

136
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,044
OK? It's B.S.! B.S.! Come on!

137
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,009
OK?

138
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,526
Hello? George?

139
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,197
Hey, hey. This is Rocky Maris,
Sam's older brother.

140
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,309
Yeah. I got your number
off the call list.

141
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,741
Is that OK? Great.

142
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,972
Well, what I wanted to call
you about was...

143
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,377
Is that I'm inviting you to...
To a party for Sam.

144
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,554
Now, I know that you two have
been having some trouble lately.

145
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,813
But you know what?

146
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,923
He's always talking about
how cool you are.

147
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,525
And it would really mean a lot
to him if you could come.

148
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,251
It's his birthday.

149
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,430
It's on Saturday at noon.

150
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,326
We can pick you up if you'd like.

151
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,360
We're going boating.
We're going on a boating trip.

152
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,434
You like boating?

153
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,669
Yeah, awesome.
So the only thing

154
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,934
that I can really ask you to do,
is not tell too many people.

155
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,840
Because we didn't really invite
a lot of people, and...

156
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,948
And, you know, everyone knows
everybody in this town.

157
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,482
And you tell your parents,

158
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,621
parents will tell other parents,
and those parents will tell their kids.

159
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,756
And pretty soon everyone
who didn't get invited

160
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,188
will be sitting at home, crying.
We don't want that, do we?

161
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,658
There you go.
So do you want me to pick you up

162
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,195
at noon? Awesome!

163
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,924
So I will see you at noon, George.

164
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,763
Awesome. Have a great day. Bye.

165
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,303
- Oh, God.
- What did he say?

166
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,805
He said he would love to go.

167
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,170
He'd love to go.

168
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,970
Oh, I'd love to go.

169
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,307
I'd love to... If you could just...

170
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,719
I'd love, love, love to go.

171
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,220
Oh, I'd love to go! Come here.

172
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,388
- Say "uncle."
- Uncle.

173
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,324
- Uncle who?
- Uncle Martini!

174
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,908
Kiss my ass, Mr. Shaham.

175
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,037
Kiss my ass, Mr. Estes.

176
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,982
Kiss my ass, Ms. Johnson.

177
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,078
Kiss my ass, Mr. Rosenthal.

178
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,855
Shit.

179
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,424
Hey! What's up with my shooter,
twerp face.

180
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,759
Target practice.

181
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,129
It's 11 a.m. In the morning
for chrissakes.

182
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,033
Most people are doing cartwheels
by 11, Kile.

183
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,170
Aren't you supposed to be
in school?

184
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,808
Fuck school.

185
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,676
I don't see you in school.

186
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,780
And besides, you're not Dad.

187
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,077
Come here.

188
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,344
Come here!

189
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,427
Yeah, you're right, I'm not Dad.

190
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,300
Dad didn't yank as hard as I do.

191
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,805
I don't really want to hear about Dad,
you understand?

192
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,436
- You understand?
- Yes.

193
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,640
Now, hand me my gun.

194
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,247
Look, stupid.

195
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,940
You ever take this
without my permission again,

196
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,017
I guarantee it, you'll be sorry.

197
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,753
- You understand?
- Yeah.

198
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:44,945
- You get it?
- Yes.

199
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,077
Kiss my ass, Kile.

200
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,353
Things to say to Sam
on our date.

201
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,660
One.

202
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,488
So...

203
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,963
Sam, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

204
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,028
Two.

205
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,531
Are you happy

206
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,674
or sad

207
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,775
that we're leaving
Rollins next year?

208
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,709
Three.

209
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:50,454
So, what's your father do
for a living again?

210
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,216
Oh, he has a car-stereo company.

211
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,756
Do you believe in God?

212
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,199
That's a weird question.

213
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,673
So, what's it like being a male?

214
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,178
OK, stupid question.

215
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,119
My name is George.

216
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,064
This is the inside of my mind.

217
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,731
This is my mother.

218
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,006
My mom works out every day.

219
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,696
And this is my street.

220
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,168
This is the street I live on.

221
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,276
- What are we doing?
- You're gonna like this.

222
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,043
Isn't that George Tooney?

223
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,811
Yeah, he's coming
to the river with us.

224
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,891
- Why?
- Sammy, don't you tell

225
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,355
your girlfriend nothing?

226
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,227
- What's he talking about, Sam?
- You should've told her, Sam.

227
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,457
All right, everyone.
He's coming. Be nice to him.

228
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,568
Millie, it's supposed to be part
of the surprise. We...

229
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,295
Happy birthday, Sammy.

230
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,802
Hi, George.
Glad you could make it.

231
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,745
You know everybody?

232
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,316
- Yeah, sure. Hey, everybody.
- Hey.

233
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,249
- What's happening, George?
- Hey, Georgie.

234
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,253
- Hi, George.
- Hey, Millie.

235
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,360
We ready?

236
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,876
- What are you doing?
- Making a documentary.

237
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,679
- Of what?
- Of things.

238
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,944
Like Sam opening his present.
Go ahead and open it.

239
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,088
Yeah, Sam, go ahead and open it.

240
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,724
You already opened
all your other presents at home.

241
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,633
Stream Machine's top of the line.

242
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,534
I have one at home,
so we can have a war sometime.

243
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,208
- Isn't it excellent?
- Oh, yeah, thank you, George.

244
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,107
You must've blown your whole
allowance on that thing, huh, George?

245
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,613
How much you bagging
a week now, 40, 50 bucks?

246
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,883
It's very sweet of you, George.

247
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,222
I got it at Funco.

248
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,892
- You can return it if you want.
- Oh, no, it's perfect.

249
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,926
Well...

250
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,391
...it's a beautiful day
for a boat trip with some buddies.

251
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,340
Hey, Marty?

252
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,277
My mom made me sign
one of those contracts.

253
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,509
It's just, like... You know, I'm not
allowed to get in a car with a driver

254
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,483
- who's been drinking.
- Oh, it's cool.

255
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,747
My mom gave me permission
to drink and drive.

256
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,120
- You don't have to worry about it.
- Your mom must be pretty stupid

257
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,386
to give you permission
to drive inebriated.

258
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,326
No, you're right, George.
My mom is pretty stupid.

259
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,599
In fact, she's got one of those
learning-disability things.

260
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,033
Must be a bad LD.

261
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,538
I have an LD,

262
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,610
but I should know you're
not supposed to drive drunk.

263
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,110
I see stuff all backwards and shit.

264
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,217
Like, instead of seeing "stop"
on a stop sign,

265
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,647
I see "pots."

266
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,652
My doctor says it's

267
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,985
a genetic variation,
like for evolution.

268
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,155
So maybe I'm a superior being.

269
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,888
The future of the race.

270
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,128
Like, if aliens came down
and they had a...

271
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:11,036
A language,
a super-advanced language,

272
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,177
that said you had to read
this way to that way,

273
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,369
instead of that way
to this way.

274
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,562
Shit.

275
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,279
Yo, kidlings.

276
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,453
What are you guys doing here?

277
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,126
Eating mini beef tacos.

278
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,754
Finest mini beef tacos
in the world here.

279
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,030
Yummy.

280
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,061
What, did you steal
Mom's car again?

281
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,204
- Why do you care?
- I don't give a fuck.

282
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,297
Who's the minors?

283
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,338
It's just my brother
and some of his friends.

284
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,510
What are the paddles for?

285
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,077
We're going cow spanking.

286
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,046
Cow spanking, what's that?

287
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,808
It's like cow tipping,

288
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,213
only we spank.

289
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,380
Really.

290
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,558
Come on, let's just get the smokes
and get out of here.

291
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,226
Camels.

292
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,996
While you boys are out
cow spanking,

293
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,792
Kile and I are gonna go
pussy hunting.

294
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,937
- Good for you, Jasper.
- Hey, don't get sassy with my boy.

295
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,442
You ever been pussy hunting?

296
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,742
No, I didn't think so.

297
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,074
You know how I knew?

298
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,013
Because you gotta have some bait
to catch one.

299
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,981
That's great.

300
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,679
Grow up, Jasper.
Let's go, Marty.

301
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,145
Jesus, Jasper.
Why do you have to...?

302
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,551
Dumb fucks.

303
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,283
Why do you have
to act so retarded?

304
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,359
Have fun cow spanking, boys.

305
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,067
- Oh, man. That was awesome.
- You see that shit?

306
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,149
- So whose road is this?
- It's just a road.

307
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,722
Hey, you guys ever hear about

308
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,491
when Rocky and I
were kicking it out here?

309
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,329
We got some poison oak
on our hands.

310
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,266
This is a disgusting story.

311
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,201
Anyway, so we were out here,

312
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,275
and we got some poison oak
on our hands.

313
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,240
With all the beers we were drinking,

314
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,573
well, naturally,
we had to take a piss.

315
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,751
Now, I don't know
if you're hip, Millie,

316
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,976
but when a guy pisses,

317
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,747
he has to hold his pisser
in his hands.

318
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,446
- Like so:
- Thanks, Marty.

319
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,182
No, wait, I'm not finished yet.

320
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,621
Next morning when we woke up,

321
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,693
we both had totally chapped,
rash-y nuts.

322
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,888
Hey, lucky you didn't run out
of toilet paper,

323
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,795
have to wipe your butt
with your hand.

324
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,807
Ouch, ouch!
I just got stung by something.

325
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,537
- You all right?
- Yeah.

326
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,050
You guys just go ahead.

327
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,946
Better make sure it's not a tick.

328
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,780
Lyme's disease, you know.

329
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,014
Look, all right, there'll be three circles
around the bite if it's Lyme's disease.

330
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,852
But, like, you gotta watch out
because you could

331
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,823
just straight drop dead
from Lyme's disease.

332
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,553
Thanks, George.

333
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,925
Oh, if it is a tick and it gets dug in,

334
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,725
we might need to take my tweezers

335
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,426
and, like, put it under a flame
until it gets, like, red hot,

336
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,403
and then burn the thing to death
so it'll let go before we pull it out.

337
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,568
Can you leave us alone
for a second?

338
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,339
Thanks.

339
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,611
Seems like George is having
a good time.

340
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,585
What are you trying
to say, Clyde?

341
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,058
Fat boy's gonna get
what he's got coming.

342
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,262
I don't see a stinger.

343
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,537
Sam, what's going on here
with George?

344
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,468
Oh, it's nothing bad.
It's just a joke.

345
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,232
What kind of joke?

346
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,910
Well...

347
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,177
...we're planning on stripping him,
throwing him in the river,

348
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,678
and then we're gonna make him
run home naked.

349
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,876
- We have a plan. It involves a dare.
- A dare?

350
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,679
Yeah. See, the only reason
I didn't tell you before...

351
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,050
Who said I wanted to be
part of this?

352
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,226
All right, what about this?

353
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:31,784
What's that?

354
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,362
"If you could snap your fingers
right now,

355
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,033
"and he would drop dead
in his tracks, would you do it?"

356
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,499
- It's totally mean, Sam.
- He's mean.

357
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,729
He's a stupid fat kid.

358
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,669
He's got problems.

359
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,206
But he's obviously...

360
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,406
Promise me you won't
do anything to him.

361
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,675
It's not just me.

362
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,251
Promise, or I go back to the car.

363
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,784
All right, I promise.

364
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,222
I'll tell Rocky.

365
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,578
Can't wait to get her on the river
and start paddling.

366
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,842
- Hey, Rock, you wanna go untie us?
- Sure.

367
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,692
- There any life jackets?
- No, I don't think we'll need them.

368
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,094
Come on, sweetheart.
Gotta learn to live life on the edge.

369
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,065
He doesn't smoke, Marty.

370
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,929
Why don't you speak
for yourself, faggot?

371
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,309
I gotta keep my eye on you.

372
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,009
These are really strong.

373
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,947
Come on, Rock,
he's not such a bad guy.

374
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,553
He's acting like a nice guy, Sam.

375
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,724
In reality, he's not.

376
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,786
You a...

377
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,329
You a cigarette virgin, George?

378
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,430
No. No, I'm not, man.

379
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,330
I've smoked before.

380
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:21,004
I... No, I once cold smoked

381
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,174
an entire pack
of American Spirit Menthols.

382
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,605
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

383
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:31,873
What if I told you American Spirit
doesn't make menthols?

384
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,241
They don't?

385
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,147
It's OK if you've never
smoked before, George. I never have.

386
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,352
Well, I have.
All right, I'm not lying.

387
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,794
You know, maybe they weren't
menthols, but they were definitely

388
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,327
- American Spirits.
- Right.

389
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,395
The only reason why
he's being nice to us

390
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:53,503
is because he sees this as
an opportunity to get something.

391
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:56,196
To get friends.
Everybody wants that.

392
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,171
OK, what if you were
his friend, Sam?

393
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,179
I mean, he'd still go around school,
beating everybody else up.

394
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,177
And that's actually
if you'd be his friend.

395
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,543
I don't care what you say.
I don't wanna do it.

396
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,651
- Millie thinks it's a bad idea too.
- Oh, well, if Millie thinks...

397
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,617
- Millie thinks what's a bad idea?
- Nothing.

398
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,549
You pansies untie the knot yet?

399
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,660
Chop, chop, come on.

400
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,124
Hey.

401
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,858
Hey, Rock, you know,
I got a knife

402
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,732
that'll slice through that
like butter.

403
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,133
That's OK, George.

404
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,103
I think we got it.

405
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,106
Well, it's got, like, a bone saw,

406
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,404
scissor, pick ax,
I mean, everything.

407
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,638
It's OK, George.

408
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,383
OK.

409
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,928
I'll talk to Marty about it, OK?

410
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,067
Give me your oar.

411
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,971
- Nice.
- Thank you, George.

412
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,836
Yeah, I once skipped
a rock on this lake,

413
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,478
it skipped, like,
a thousand times.

414
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,646
Let's get her in the water.

415
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,045
Aye, aye, capitan.

416
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,415
Calling off the plan.
I'll tell you later.

417
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,318
It's all taken care of.

418
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,667
Hey! You guys should take
your shoes off

419
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,303
if you don't want
to get them wet.

420
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,599
Too late. They're soaked.

421
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,535
This is gonna be fun,
don't you think?

422
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,305
Yeah. But whoever didn't
bring life jackets

423
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,040
on a boat trip's a moron.

424
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,521
Hey, you know
I have athlete's foot?

425
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,686
- Get in.
- You are so disgusting.

426
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,290
Oh, my gosh.

427
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,724
Row, two, three, four!

428
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,287
One, two, three, four...

429
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,690
Sam loves it, don't you lie

430
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,484
Rocky is a pimp

431
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,353
Clyde is a fag

432
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,200
Yeah, you love it, don't you?

433
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,627
He spit all over the lens.

434
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:16,740
Shut up, Rocky, this is
what's gonna get me on MTV.

435
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,342
You need go-go dancers.

436
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,173
This is expensive.

437
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,818
OK, now you have to stop.

438
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,488
Send your donations
to George Tooney, Oregon.

439
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,681
Love one.

440
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,124
I always thought I was really
talented in that sense.

441
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,560
You agree, right? Up top.
Maybe later.

442
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,940
I'm glad the way
this day's turning out.

443
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,976
It's a nice day.

444
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:01,049
Yeah, if nothing else,
it's a nice day.

445
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,855
Can you guys taste
how sweet the air is?

446
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,158
Smells like cherry blossom.

447
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:15,628
How do you know what
cherry blossoms smell like, George?

448
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,933
It's obvious.

449
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,265
I don't know.

450
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,873
What is a cherry blossom?

451
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,704
It's the blossom on a cherry.

452
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,345
No, I thought it was
its own kind of plant.

453
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,174
What do you think, Marty?

454
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,577
I think I'm bored as fuck.

455
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,883
I also think I got some more beer
in my pack.

456
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,554
- Anyone want one?
- Yeah.

457
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,517
- You drinking, Sammy?
- Yeah, sure.

458
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,284
I thought you...
Didn't you want a beer?

459
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,176
Hey, Sammy.

460
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,741
If you're really feeling
like a party animal...

461
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,848
...you wanna smoke
a birthday doobie?

462
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,576
Sam doesn't smoke weed, Marty.

463
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,652
- Rocky, chill out.
- There's younger people

464
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:15,121
- on this trip, Marty.
- All right, fuck-face, calm down.

465
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,655
- I've been stoned before.
- Oh, yeah?

466
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:22,094
Yeah. Yeah. I smoked a whole blunt
myself once. Yup.

467
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,030
I... I hallucinated that there was...

468
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,999
There was a little blue guy
on my shoulder,

469
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,366
fucking tap dancing.

470
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,269
But, no, I don't smoke weed
after that,

471
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:35,003
because, like, my doctor says
it stunts your growth.

472
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,148
- So I'm waiting until I'm 24.
- Yeah.

473
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,681
Because, you know, that's when
you stop growing.

474
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:49,289
Have you ever been stoned, Millie?

475
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,258
Would you please get that
out of my face?

476
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,994
All right, go ahead, turn it off.

477
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,246
Sure is a beautiful river.

478
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,118
Oh, you guys, look!

479
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,153
- What?
- What?

480
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,689
What?

481
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,660
I thought I saw a water snake.

482
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,135
Sam.

483
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,972
Millie.

484
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,666
Thanks.

485
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,610
- Here.
- Thanks.

486
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:22,448
All that boating really gets
your appetite up.

487
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,245
You've just been sitting in the boat.

488
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,287
I've been shifting my weight
the whole time,

489
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,720
trying to keep us level.

490
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,655
Yeah, you've really been
working hard.

491
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,456
As if your pussy ass
has been doing anything.

492
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,336
Did you make these yourself?

493
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:47,510
You'II... You'll have to give me
the recipe sometime.

494
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,074
It's peanut butter and jelly.

495
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,519
Oh, yeah.

496
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,528
Nothing beats a good piss
in the river.

497
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,795
Except, of course,
a good romping session

498
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,527
of a stupid, ugly, dumb,
pathetic piece of shit.

499
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,639
- Yeah, we gotta talk about that.
- Yeah?

500
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,040
What's to talk about?

501
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,278
I want to call it off.

502
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,345
I'm not laughing.

503
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,307
I'm dead serious.

504
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,041
Wait a minute.

505
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,516
First, you get me all juiced up.

506
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,916
You make me steal my mom's car.

507
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,819
You get me out here
on a Saturday

508
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,256
when I could be at home
watching TV.

509
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,122
- Marty, come on.
- Then you have me steering

510
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,060
the fucking Titanic all across the river
with a bunch of munchkins

511
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,963
who are totally sober
and bringing me down.

512
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,139
Now, you mean to tell me
we don't even get to do

513
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,830
what we came out here for?

514
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,010
I had no idea the guy
was gonna turn out so nice.

515
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,702
Check it out, Rock,
he's not nice!

516
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:59,246
He's a spoiled, retarded punk
who beat up your brother.

517
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,315
OK, maybe I feel a little sorry
for him now.

518
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,111
OK, well, then I'm gonna
give you two choices:

519
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,312
You're either hard as hell
and you're yanking my chain,

520
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,785
or you're the limpest dick
I've ever met in my life.

521
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,323
- Everyone wants to call it off.
- Well, everyone is a vagina!

522
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,223
You don't even have
a real grudge against him.

523
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,557
If you were any kind
of a good brother,

524
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,167
you wouldn't let Sammy boy
get the shit kicked out of him

525
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,237
and then stroke the beater-upper's dick
all day long.

526
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,432
- Just remember the plan's off.
- Yeah.

527
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,013
I just wonder if,
when push came to shove,

528
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,909
if you'd have my back.

529
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,918
Hey, Clyde.

530
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:41,114
Remember when you were in the
fourth grade, and I was in third, and I...

531
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,486
I smacked you across the face
with a bat?

532
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,458
- How could I forget?
- Maybe you had that thing

533
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,632
where you forget
from getting hit in the head.

534
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,824
- Amnesia?
- Yeah.

535
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,300
Anyway, I was trying to remember.

536
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,598
- Why'd I do it?
- I don't know.

537
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,968
You must've done something.

538
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,406
No, I never do anything to anybody.

539
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,443
That's stupid.
Of course you do.

540
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,481
Look, it's not stupid, George.
You just attacked me.

541
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,515
A kid doesn't just attack
for no reason.

542
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,619
You always attack for no reason.

543
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,285
I know it's your birthday, Sam,
but shut your trap.

544
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,494
Hey! You pussies done
with your sammies?

545
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,332
Does it look like we're done
with our sandwiches?

546
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,508
Yeah, I'm gonna get the boat
back in the water.

547
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,734
You ladies can join me
whenever you want.

548
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,006
Why'd you drop the anchor?

549
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,871
Because I felt like it.

550
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,124
Hey, Sammy.

551
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,790
What you say we bust out
that Stream Machine.

552
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:35,229
- Yeah, OK.
- Clyde, can you give it to me?

553
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,982
All right.

554
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,554
Put that away.

555
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,023
All right, first, we must charge
the propulsion system.

556
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,593
And then take aim
and run a preliminary test.

557
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,129
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

558
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,631
Don't fucking squirt
that thing at me again!

559
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,139
Hey, what do you guys say
we play some Truth or Dare?

560
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,443
Yeah. Yeah, I love that game.

561
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,779
- OK, then, let's do it.
- Let's not.

562
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,752
People's feelings always end up hurt
when we play this game.

563
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,219
Yeah, she's right.

564
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,121
God, Sam and Millie

565
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,785
are a couple of little
wet pussies, aren't they?

566
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,026
Clyde, do you wanna start?

567
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,603
I don't know. I'm kind of with
Millie and Sam on this one.

568
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,843
Pussy number one,
pussy number two,

569
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,272
pussy number three.

570
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,447
Go ahead, Clyde. Start the game.

571
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,148
OK, then.

572
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,256
Rocky, truth or dare?

573
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,662
Truth.

574
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,097
All right, I want you to tell us,

575
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,272
in 20 words or more,

576
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,941
what you were thinking
the last time you beat off.

577
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,579
Susie Johnson.

578
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:27,410
But that's...
That's not even 20 words.

579
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,245
It's, like, two.

580
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,021
OK, I imagined that
she followed me into the locker room,

581
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,558
went into the stall.

582
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,286
She got on her knees.
I sat on the toilet.

583
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,524
- That's 20.
- All right, Rocky, it's your turn.

584
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,794
OK, Sammy. Truth or dare?

585
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,340
Dare.

586
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,376
I dare you to French kiss
Millie for ten seconds.

587
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,344
Man.

588
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,142
It's pretty exciting.

589
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,651
- It's OK.
- What? It's OK.

590
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,585
Wait, did you hear that?
It's OK.

591
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,727
She wants it.

592
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,396
This is what I paid for? Come on!

593
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,258
- Come on!
- Let's go!

594
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,626
I want my money back.

595
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,734
OK. There you go.

596
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,871
There you go! Ten.

597
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,596
Nine,

598
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,173
eight, seven,

599
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,641
six, five,

600
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,212
four, three,

601
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,349
two...

602
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,749
Oh, shit. Oh, man.

603
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,527
Yo, Rock. Rock, I just had
an amazing flash

604
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:50,132
of what your brother and Millie would
look like all hot and bothered in bed.

605
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,762
- That's gross.
- Sammy, go. It's your turn.

606
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,871
Wait, wait, maybe... Maybe we
shouldn't call him Sammy anymore.

607
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,906
Maybe we should call him
"lover boy."

608
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,779
OK, then.

609
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,470
Marty.

610
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,150
- Truth or dare?
- Dare.

611
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,784
All right.

612
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,121
I dare you to pull down
your pants and your underwear,

613
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,417
and show us that famous dick of yours
for at least ten seconds.

614
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,924
Ten seconds.
Wow, you are a killer, Sam.

615
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,561
All right, I will do it,

616
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:23,426
because I am proud of my boys.
But if I do,

617
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,626
I don't want anyone else
wimping out on their dares.

618
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,566
So let's see the penis.

619
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,605
- Bring on the penis!
- All right.

620
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,507
Millie, close your eyes.
Marty doesn't want to go to jail.

621
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,043
No cameras.

622
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,209
We ready?

623
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,054
That's sick.

624
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,393
- Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
- Oh! OK. OK.

625
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,222
All right.
You fucking asshole.

626
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,902
- It was hairy as a chimp!
- Yeah, was it?

627
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,594
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

628
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,568
It looked like a giant frog.

629
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,709
All right, assholes.
That was pretty funny, douche bag.

630
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,309
- At first I thought it was all deformed,
- Thank you.

631
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,742
- Because it was just so fucking ugly.
- OK. All right.

632
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,939
Have you gotten out
all your stupid chuckles yet?

633
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,414
Have I gotten out all
my stupid chuckles? No!

634
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,554
All right. Well, whenever you're done,
let me know, because it's my turn next.

635
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,247
"Whenever you're done, let me know,
because it's my turn next."

636
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,857
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, well, what are you doing?

637
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,584
- Stop imitating me.
- "Stop imitating me."

638
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,023
- Enough is enough!
- "Enough is enough!"

639
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,960
Is that what your dad says to you?

640
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,827
You don't know shit about my father.

641
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,872
If you ever say anything
about my father again, I will kill you.

642
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,305
Do you understand?

643
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,747
Marty, I...

644
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,680
I was just messing around with you.

645
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,689
OK, messing boy.

646
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,451
I dare you to strip butt naked
and jump in the river.

647
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,560
Marty, leave him alone.

648
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,361
I did my dare.

649
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,159
Now he does his.
Those are the rules, Clyde.

650
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,529
Marty, why don't you
just calm down?

651
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,535
- OK, the game's over.
- The game'll be over in a minute!

652
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:15,010
Right after fat-ass here takes
his clothes off and gets in the bath.

653
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,640
Chill out, Marty, all right?

654
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,680
Because you know what?
I didn't even pick dare, all right?

655
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,980
I pick truth.

656
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,818
You want a truth?

657
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,621
OK, I'll give you a truth.

658
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,333
The truth is, lard-fart,

659
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,761
is that we didn't invite you out here
because we've been secretly in love

660
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,303
- with you all these years.
- Marty, don't do this.

661
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,533
We invited you out here
because you smacked Sammy boy

662
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,871
- right there in the cranium.
- Marty, stop.

663
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,515
So we came up with a plan
to mess you up.

664
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,375
Is that true, Sam?

665
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,513
Yeah.

666
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,420
But then we changed our minds
because we liked you.

667
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,128
Wait, you...? You tricked me?

668
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,161
Yes, we tricked you.

669
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,526
And, yes, all these suckers here
changed their minds,

670
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,759
but I didn't change mine.

671
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:17,573
I'm a man who likes to
follow through with his plans.

672
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,612
What have you been planning?

673
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,787
We were planning
on stripping you,

674
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:38,052
throwing you in the river,
then making you run home naked.

675
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,596
- It's not funny.
- Oh, it's super-duper funny to me.

676
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,565
- I'm sorry, George.
- You're not sorry!

677
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,675
I'm sorry.

678
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,783
Is...? Is it even your birthday?

679
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,543
No.

680
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,524
You're a fucking lying
son of a bitch, Sam!

681
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,853
All right? And I hope you
fucking go to hell!

682
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,622
- Don't make things worse, George.
- Shut the fuck up, Millie.

683
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,857
You fucking stupid JAP cunt!

684
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,694
Sit down, George.
You're out of control.

685
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:21,462
Shut the fuck up, Clyde!
You faggot!

686
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,799
Fucking skinny,
butt-munching faggot!

687
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,838
I hate you, you know that?
I really do!

688
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,273
Because all you do is
fucking prance around school,

689
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,878
talking about your fucking
faggoty, fairy fathers!

690
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,810
I'll tell you what!
I don't want to hear

691
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,644
about your fucking fathers
and how their assholes work.

692
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,616
All right? It makes me sick!

693
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:41,552
And I... I fucking hope they
fucking die of fag disease!

694
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,851
Yeah!

695
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:54,167
And... And speaking
of dead fathers...

696
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:58,532
...I just remembered
why bonehead, white-trash,

697
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,802
fucking donkey-dick Marty
got so fucking freaked

698
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,072
when I started talking
about his daddy.

699
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,908
His Neanderthal

700
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,146
drunk dad put a gun in his mouth

701
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:17,225
and splattered his brains
all over the wall.

702
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:25,291
You know, I almost forgot
that my mom told me that.

703
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:29,495
She said, "His daddy splattered
his brains all over the wall."

704
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:34,302
I thought it was sad at first.
But, now, I like it.

705
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,410
His daddy splattered
his brains

706
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,707
all over the wall.

707
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,385
- His daddy splattered his brains
- Shut up, George.

708
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,180
- All over the wall.
- George, come on. Shut up.

709
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,414
His daddy splattered his brains
all over the wall!

710
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,252
- Stop it, George!
- All over the wall!

711
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,360
- His daddy splattered his brains
- No one talks to people like that.

712
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,497
- All over the wall!
- Shut the fuck up, George!

713
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,167
- Shut the fuck up!
- All over the wall!

714
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:01,235
All over the wall!
His daddy splattered his brains

715
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,871
- Shut up!
- All over the wall!

716
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,301
- Marty!
- Stop it!

717
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,033
- Marty! George!
- All over the wall!

718
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,007
Shut the fuck up!

719
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:12,747
- Help! Help!
- That's what happens

720
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,645
when you fuck with Martini Blank!

721
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,820
- Help, help! Please!
- Martini Blank's friends back him up.

722
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,323
- That's what friends do, fuck-o.
- Help!

723
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,255
- Help! Help! Help!
- That's why you're in the water.

724
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:28,129
- Because you've got none.
- Help! Fucker!

725
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,394
Help!

726
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,504
Help! Help!

727
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,509
Help! Help!

728
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,682
Please help.

729
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,503
Shit, you guys,
he's not coming up!

730
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,908
Help!

731
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,780
Guys, help, now! Hurry!

732
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,452
Get him up.

733
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,426
George.

734
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,190
- Oh, shit.
- Do you know what you're doing?

735
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,962
One, two, three, four...

736
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,105
Help!

737
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,703
Help!

738
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,945
Help!

739
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,381
Can anyone help us?

740
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,943
- Help!
- One, two, three, four.

741
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,646
One, two, three, four.

742
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,493
Come on.

743
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,428
Wake up. Come on, wake up!

744
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:21,995
Wake up.

745
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:24,673
Shit.

746
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,804
Wake up!

747
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,578
Wake up!

748
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,681
Wake up! God, wake up!

749
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,621
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

750
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,154
Wake up, wake up!

751
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,225
Wake up! Wake up,
wake up, wake up!

752
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,019
Wake up!

753
00:55:53,181 --> 00:55:55,672
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you!

754
00:55:59,887 --> 00:56:03,118
We can never be forgiven
for what we did.

755
00:56:04,092 --> 00:56:06,424
You didn't do anything.

756
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:08,953
I don't wanna be here.

757
00:56:09,163 --> 00:56:11,654
I don't wanna be here.

758
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:14,897
I wanted to kill him before
I threw him over. Now he's dead.

759
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,037
Maybe this was his time to go.

760
00:56:17,238 --> 00:56:19,263
Maybe it was his fate.

761
00:56:19,841 --> 00:56:22,036
Why would it be his fate?

762
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:26,208
Because everything happens
for a reason, Rock.

763
00:56:26,948 --> 00:56:28,438
I don't know.

764
00:56:43,831 --> 00:56:45,799
I'm sorry.

765
00:56:48,202 --> 00:56:50,136
I'm sorry.

766
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:55,040
I'm sorry.

767
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:55,599
Anybody know what time it is?

768
00:58:08,783 --> 00:58:11,581
What if we say
we were playing Truth or Dare,

769
00:58:12,186 --> 00:58:14,916
and then we dared him
to jump into the river,

770
00:58:15,122 --> 00:58:18,023
and he did, and he drowned.

771
00:58:24,966 --> 00:58:26,365
What the hell are you doing?

772
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:28,364
Looking for his fucking
video camera.

773
00:58:29,237 --> 00:58:31,831
If it gets found, then everybody
finds out what we did.

774
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:33,370
Everyone's gonna find out
what we did,

775
00:58:33,574 --> 00:58:35,303
regardless if the video camera
gets found, Marty.

776
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,705
Not if we don't want them to.

777
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:41,247
Are you joking?

778
00:58:41,449 --> 00:58:43,883
Look, this was a prank that went
wrong. We come completely clean.

779
00:58:44,085 --> 00:58:47,816
No one's got a ton of sympathy
for guys who throw fat kids in the river.

780
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:51,048
All right? If we turn ourselves in,
we're all screwed.

781
00:58:51,759 --> 00:58:54,091
What do you think's
gonna happen, Marty?

782
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:56,923
Superman's gonna fly around
Earth and turn back time?

783
00:58:57,131 --> 00:59:02,763
No. I don't think Superman's
going to turn back time.

784
00:59:05,873 --> 00:59:07,238
Think we gotta bury the body.

785
00:59:26,394 --> 00:59:28,954
Rocky, if we bury the body, it's gonna
look like we did it on purpose.

786
00:59:29,163 --> 00:59:32,155
If we bury the body,
we're not gonna look like anything.

787
00:59:32,366 --> 00:59:34,561
Out of sight, out of mind.

788
00:59:34,769 --> 00:59:37,761
Yeah, well, maybe out of your mind,
you stupid fuck.

789
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:48,048
Look, we just committed
a major fucking crime.

790
00:59:48,249 --> 00:59:50,547
And if any one of us cracks,
we are all gonna be screwed.

791
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:53,845
Look, it was an accident. Kids like us
have accidents all the time.

792
00:59:54,055 --> 00:59:56,319
This wasn't just an accident.

793
00:59:56,524 --> 00:59:59,618
All right? We schemed this,
from the beginning.

794
00:59:59,827 --> 01:00:03,126
All right, so fine, we schemed.
No one has to know that.

795
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:05,365
They're gonna figure it out.

796
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,597
Somebody's bound to crack when
they start asking a million questions.

797
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:11,795
Put Sammy boy in a lie detector.

798
01:00:12,006 --> 01:00:14,406
Look, the idea
of burying the body is nuts.

799
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:16,509
Going to jail
and getting raped every night

800
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:19,976
for the rest of your cute,
little, fucking lives is nuts.

801
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:22,274
I think you're nuts.

802
01:00:58,252 --> 01:00:59,947
So that's it?

803
01:01:00,154 --> 01:01:03,555
We're just gonna pretend
like we're all innocent.

804
01:01:05,292 --> 01:01:07,817
- Shut up.
- No.

805
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:10,156
- Shut up.
- No!

806
01:01:10,865 --> 01:01:13,163
If you've got a better idea,
then you better spit it out

807
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:16,200
- because no one else does.
- Marty, come on.

808
01:01:16,404 --> 01:01:18,964
- Do you have one?
- Shit, Marty. Get off. Come on.

809
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:22,199
If you've got a better idea,
I'll listen. Do you?

810
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:23,741
- No.
- Then do you agree

811
01:01:23,944 --> 01:01:26,208
that we have to go
with the best idea we've got?

812
01:01:27,515 --> 01:01:30,382
Yes. Get off.

813
01:01:39,994 --> 01:01:42,986
You always gotta go
with the best idea you've got.

814
01:01:45,232 --> 01:01:47,166
Otherwise you're just left

815
01:01:47,368 --> 01:01:51,031
laying around
not knowing what to do.

816
01:02:59,807 --> 01:03:01,775
I can't do it.

817
01:03:01,976 --> 01:03:03,841
It's not safe.

818
01:03:07,414 --> 01:03:09,746
It's a big joke anyway.

819
01:04:09,643 --> 01:04:11,804
I think that's deep enough.

820
01:06:54,274 --> 01:06:56,640
Hey, you guys wanna help?

821
01:07:09,923 --> 01:07:11,515
First thing we gotta do
when we get back

822
01:07:11,725 --> 01:07:13,750
is deal with Jasper
and my brother.

823
01:07:14,228 --> 01:07:15,957
How?

824
01:07:16,163 --> 01:07:18,154
Gotta make sure they forget
they ever saw George with us.

825
01:07:18,365 --> 01:07:19,696
What the fuck
you gonna do? Huh?

826
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,597
Hit them over the head with a rock,
hope they get amnesia?

827
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:04,110
Thanks.

828
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,913
All right, this is the way
it's gonna work.

829
01:08:43,117 --> 01:08:45,813
We drop everybody off
at their houses.

830
01:08:46,019 --> 01:08:47,987
Everybody's gonna sit tight
until I go make sure

831
01:08:48,188 --> 01:08:50,622
everything's "copathetic"
with Kile and Jasper.

832
01:08:50,824 --> 01:08:53,588
The word's copacetic, Marty.

833
01:08:54,495 --> 01:08:56,019
Yeah.

834
01:09:31,165 --> 01:09:32,564
Millie...

835
01:09:32,933 --> 01:09:34,764
...mum's the word.

836
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:14,869
Peg, can I get the phone?

837
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:23,207
Shit.

838
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:28,813
- Kile?
- Hey, Marty.

839
01:10:29,022 --> 01:10:30,751
- What's cooking?
- Hey, you little fucker.

840
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:33,449
How'd the cow spanking go?

841
01:10:35,295 --> 01:10:36,262
What?

842
01:10:40,734 --> 01:10:43,567
Looks fantastic.

843
01:10:49,643 --> 01:10:51,201
You OK?

844
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:52,844
You look a little...

845
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,111
No, I'm fine.

846
01:11:00,053 --> 01:11:04,046
Clyde, if something's up,
it's OK to tell us about it.

847
01:11:15,602 --> 01:11:18,093
This is so fucked.

848
01:11:18,305 --> 01:11:19,704
Fuck!

849
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:32,074
I don't even know...

850
01:11:33,987 --> 01:11:36,080
I don't even know.

851
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,550
Hey.

852
01:11:42,963 --> 01:11:45,488
Maybe you guys
could take me home?

853
01:12:10,424 --> 01:12:12,688
Wish we knew what to do.

854
01:12:17,531 --> 01:12:19,499
We know what to do.

855
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:23,067
You know what we did, Rocky.

856
01:12:26,406 --> 01:12:28,772
What are you trying to say, Sam?

857
01:12:47,094 --> 01:12:49,927
You have to trust me
on this one, Sam.

858
01:12:52,566 --> 01:12:54,932
I'm your big brother.

859
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:05,437
But I don't trust you.

860
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,891
Where you going?

861
01:14:10,877 --> 01:14:12,310
What do you want?

862
01:14:13,547 --> 01:14:15,310
To talk.

863
01:14:15,515 --> 01:14:17,107
We have nothing to talk about.

864
01:14:17,851 --> 01:14:20,911
It was your guys' plan.
I was just there.

865
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:24,115
That doesn't mean
I have to tell on you.

866
01:14:24,324 --> 01:14:26,656
And that's your problem.

867
01:14:27,894 --> 01:14:29,418
Are you done?

868
01:14:30,997 --> 01:14:33,192
Can I come in?

869
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:03,788
Do you remember when you said
we could never be forgiven?

870
01:15:08,902 --> 01:15:10,494
That might be right.

871
01:15:12,706 --> 01:15:14,196
I don't know.

872
01:15:16,676 --> 01:15:20,271
The only thing I do know is that
I'm not sure about anything.

873
01:15:21,281 --> 01:15:23,613
What do you want us to do?

874
01:15:23,817 --> 01:15:25,785
Go back and unbury the body?

875
01:15:25,986 --> 01:15:28,147
He's dead.

876
01:15:31,424 --> 01:15:33,016
You know...

877
01:15:35,428 --> 01:15:38,295
...when we graduate
high school

878
01:15:38,498 --> 01:15:42,662
and go to college and become doctors
and lawyers and all that...

879
01:15:47,574 --> 01:15:50,270
...what do you think it'd be like?

880
01:16:30,817 --> 01:16:32,648
- Hey.
- Hey, Marty.

881
01:16:32,852 --> 01:16:35,480
- Good to see you.
- How you doing, Mr. Maris?

882
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:37,350
- How are you?
- I'm good.

883
01:16:37,557 --> 01:16:39,354
Are...?
Is Rocky and Sam home?

884
01:16:39,559 --> 01:16:41,151
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The whole gang's here.

885
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:43,955
They're listening to music
in the bedroom there.

886
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:46,928
- Do you mind if...? Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah.

887
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:04,810
What's going on here?

888
01:17:05,018 --> 01:17:07,248
Why don't you sit down?

889
01:17:10,256 --> 01:17:12,986
What, so I go off to make sure
all our business is taken care of,

890
01:17:13,193 --> 01:17:15,286
and all of a sudden
you guys form a new club?

891
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:20,625
- We've come to a decision.
- You've come to a decision?

892
01:17:22,302 --> 01:17:24,532
What, are you kidding me?

893
01:17:26,306 --> 01:17:28,604
We already decided.
I talked to Jasper and Kile.

894
01:17:28,808 --> 01:17:30,799
They're not gonna say anything.

895
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:33,206
Everything is going to be OK.

896
01:17:33,413 --> 01:17:36,814
No. Everything is not
gonna be OK.

897
01:17:38,118 --> 01:17:39,745
So, what?

898
01:17:40,687 --> 01:17:42,587
All you guys decide to squeal
or something?

899
01:17:42,789 --> 01:17:44,416
We have to, Marty.
It's the only way...

900
01:17:44,624 --> 01:17:48,219
No, there is no "only way", Sam.
That's crap.

901
01:17:48,995 --> 01:17:51,486
OK? You know that's crap.

902
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:08,743
All right.

903
01:18:10,684 --> 01:18:12,914
Screw all of you, then.

904
01:18:17,824 --> 01:18:19,951
- Marty, hang on.
- No!

905
01:18:23,997 --> 01:18:26,022
- Where you going?
- Away from you.

906
01:18:28,234 --> 01:18:30,361
You suck.

907
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:32,731
You know that, right?

908
01:18:34,574 --> 01:18:36,940
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know, drive to Mexico.

909
01:18:37,143 --> 01:18:39,407
What do you think?

910
01:18:41,548 --> 01:18:43,482
I don't know what to think.

911
01:18:45,351 --> 01:18:47,251
Well, if you don't know
what to think,

912
01:18:47,454 --> 01:18:50,582
then you probably shouldn't
be making decisions.

913
01:19:33,066 --> 01:19:36,502
What do you think about
letting me borrow your gun?

914
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:42,566
- Hey.
- Yeah.

915
01:22:29,075 --> 01:22:30,872
Easy, man.

916
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:49,893
He was saying terrible things.

917
01:22:50,096 --> 01:22:52,462
Things that shouldn't
have been said.

918
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:03,334
When your brother
knocked George overboard...

919
01:23:04,243 --> 01:23:06,507
...would you say he was

920
01:23:06,713 --> 01:23:08,943
in control

921
01:23:09,148 --> 01:23:11,412
or out of control?

922
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:19,558
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

923
01:23:19,759 --> 01:23:20,987
Excuse me, Sam.

924
01:23:32,205 --> 01:23:35,766
Never seen him
more out of control in my life.

925
01:24:07,707 --> 01:24:10,073
My name is George.

926
01:24:12,912 --> 01:24:14,504
And this...

927
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:19,711
...is the inside of my mind.

928
01:24:24,757 --> 01:24:28,625
The inside of my mind
has a zillion things.

929
01:24:52,952 --> 01:24:57,013
The inside of my mind
has a zillion things about it.

930
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:59,323
But...

931
01:25:00,593 --> 01:25:02,720
...people that don't
see inside my mind

932
01:25:02,929 --> 01:25:07,263
don't know there are
a zillion things and...

933
01:25:10,303 --> 01:25:12,203
You know, since no one
sees inside my mind,

934
01:25:12,405 --> 01:25:14,839
no one really knows.

935
01:25:23,983 --> 01:25:25,541
But...

936
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:28,313
...one day people will know.

937
01:25:32,959 --> 01:25:37,419
One day people will know
because that's my master plan.

938
01:25:42,802 --> 01:25:46,169
To film it all.

939
01:25:46,372 --> 01:25:52,311
To document every aspect
of the life that is me.

940
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:56,409
And put it in a time capsule
in my back yard.

941
01:25:56,616 --> 01:26:00,177
And so that one day, some...

942
01:26:00,586 --> 01:26:03,749
...alien,
or some highly evolved species,

943
01:26:03,956 --> 01:26:06,857
will find it and...

944
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:12,254
understand.
