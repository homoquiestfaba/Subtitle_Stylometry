[whooshing]

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:09,274
Hip Hop music

3
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,618
"Women who
know basketball players."

4
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,521
You know I call it
that 'cause

5
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:43,589
ain't none
of them married.

6
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,990
Not one wife on
the show.

7
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,861
- You saw it?
- I did.

8
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,296
The crazy one.

9
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,266
She remind me of--

10
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,134
Ladies.

11
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,669
Top of the morning
to you, Markita?

12
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,704
How's everything?

13
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,405
I'm good.
Great.

14
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,607
Sheila.

15
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,941
Looking mighty
"grrr," girl.

16
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,110
"Grrr," yes.

17
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,411
How you doing, sir?

18
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,579
Good, if you need
coffee or tea,

19
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,915
just let Markita know,
she'll take care of you.

20
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,250
( woman )
Take your mail.

21
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,786
I'll take my mail-- are you
gonna get me my coffee?

22
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,822
Gavin, I don't
do coffee.

23
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,657
What do you mean you--
I've never done coffee.

24
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:19,691
So what do you do?

25
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:20,792
I mean, I hired
you for a reason.

26
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,961
You asked me to
remind you of your 10:00 a.m.

27
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,030
meeting with Makell Williams
from marketing

28
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,932
about your little
"Man Of The Year" thingie

29
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,200
that magazine did
last week.

30
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,368
Oh, that's good.

31
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,403
So this is me reminding
you of your 10:00 a.m.,

32
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,804
but it's been
pushed to 3:00.

33
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,473
No, no, no, no, 3:00 p.m.
is not good.

34
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,475
I have a late
lunch with Dre at 3:00 p.m.

35
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,643
No worries, I took
care of it.

36
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:38,844
She's coming at noon.

37
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:41,113
Jo, I'm not hungry
at noon, Jo.

38
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,815
You also asked me to send
your mama flowers.

39
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,450
You used the word "mama."
I did, okay.

40
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,718
I took your mother flowers
at the hospital

41
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,819
and she
wants to see you.

42
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,621
Jo, that's why I said
"send" flowers,

43
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,323
not "take,"
"send" flowers.

44
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,325
"Send," "take," you know,
it's like two different things.

45
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,526
She got the flowers.

46
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,061
I under--
okay, do me a favor.

47
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,430
Change my 3:00 p.m. back
to 10:00 a.m.

48
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,798
and get
my mother on the phone.

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,966
Did you modify
anything else?

50
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,669
Oh, yes,
there's one other thing.

51
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:06,171
You have a friend waiting for
you in your office.

52
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,440
She said her
name was Rochelle Davis.

53
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,108
Rochelle-- what?

54
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,594
Come with your
mama, come with your mama.

55
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,063
Boyz II Men up
in here?

56
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,698
Ash, what
do you think?

57
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,965
Uh, no.

58
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,701
Well, what do
you see?

59
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,077
- Hey, mama.
- Huh?

60
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,212
Hey, I like these.

61
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,880
You do?

62
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,415
You do?

63
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,250
You do?

64
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,985
Come on, let's go
find the other one.

65
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,358
All right.

66
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,660
Jeans and a Sunday hat.

67
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,994
Oh, my God.

68
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,736
Lord, please
don't let them come over here.

69
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,771
I swear I'll be good, I'll go
to church and everything.

70
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,861
My bad!
Dang, stupid.

71
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,398
Ah!

72
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,900
Whoa, what are
you wearing?

73
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,169
Look, please don't
tell Rochelle.

74
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,037
You know
my summer style.
I'll pay you!

75
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,739
I'll pay you!

76
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,508
No, you look.

77
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,209
Gavin...

78
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,412
What kind
of outfit is that?

79
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,679
Where's your neck?

80
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,814
Right?

81
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:56,982
For Halloween.

82
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,116
Yeah, we're having a
costume party

83
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,818
and I wanted to be ready,
you know.

84
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,852
I'm going retro.

85
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:01,920
You coming, right?

86
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:02,921
You can come, too.

87
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,923
It's gonna be called
Flashlight.

88
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,358
Hey, Gavin.

89
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,693
I found that other shoe.

90
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,761
It was in
the furniture section

91
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,331
for some other reason
or other.

92
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,001
Aren't you gonna introduce
me to your friends?

93
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,272
Ashley, Rochelle,
my mama.

94
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,374
Hi, Mrs. Miller.
Hi, ladies.

95
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,542
See, I told you you
wouldn't be the only one

96
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,343
school shopping here.

97
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,913
( laughing )

98
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,781
She is so funny.

99
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,118
She's such a joker, you need
to stop joking so much.

100
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,386
Joking about what?

101
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:37,856
Who wears platform
heels to high school?

102
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,492
I was just telling them
about the party we're having,

103
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,693
you know, the
Halloween party.

104
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,028
Flashlight.

105
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,364
Da-de-da-de-da-de-da-da-da

106
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,700
Ooh, boy,
you can't sing.

107
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:49,968
What flashlight party?

108
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,269
Nuh-uh, not in
my house.

109
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,705
Here, go try this on.

110
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,541
I'm not having a bunch of Bebe's
kids running wild

111
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,377
humping and grinding
all up in my house.

112
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,079
Look, no disrespect?

113
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,647
Teen pregnancy
is high enough without

114
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,317
my house and me contributing,
thank you very much.

115
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,718
Teen pregnancy?

116
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,153
Grinding and
humping, Mama?

117
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,354
Really?

118
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,456
It was really nice to
meet you, Mrs. Miller.

119
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,758
I know your
hands are full.

120
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,560
Bye, ladies.

121
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,963
Bye, Gavin.
What a herb.

122
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,197
Who's Herb?

123
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,000
Mama?

124
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,468
This don't fit.

125
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,770
Go try it on
again, try.

126
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,305
Here.

127
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,711
Hey.

128
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,012
Gavin.

129
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,780
How are you?

130
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,592
It's nice to see you.
Wow, hey.

131
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,060
Why don't you
have a seat, huh?

132
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,132
Uh, wow.

133
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,101
How have you been?

134
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,636
How did you find
me, I'm--

135
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:01,473
Wow, I haven't seen you since,
like high school.

136
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:05,110
Yeah.
Oh, I'm just visiting.

137
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,812
You aren't
upset with me?

138
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,148
For what?

139
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,149
Well--

140
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:15,253
<i>Gavin, your</i>
<i>mother's on line one.</i>

141
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,122
One minute, girl.

142
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,490
I'll be right with you.

143
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:19,658
Um, yes, Bobby?

144
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,059
<i>Bobby Jo.</i>

145
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,827
Okay, Bobby Jo.

146
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,430
I can call you
Bobby or Jo.

147
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,099
<i>No, Bobby Jo...</i>
<i>we've gone over this.</i>

148
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,201
Bobby Jo, right, okay.

149
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,038
<i>Oh, hello, hi.</i>

150
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,172
<i>Tell her I know</i>
<i>it's real.</i>

151
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,675
Can you tell my mother
that I'm actually

152
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,411
in with someone
and they're pretty special

153
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,947
and I'll call her right
back, okay?

154
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:42,981
<i>Oh, really?</i>

155
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,249
<i>Well, she said</i>
<i>it's urgent.</i>

156
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,955
Quick, you know what--
it's just like--

157
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,022
It's Mom.

158
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,291
<i>Hey, Mom,</i>
<i>how are you?</i>

159
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,926
Yeah, well...

160
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,897
the doctor says my
pressure's through the roof.

161
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,265
But you know what?

162
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,399
I feel fine.

163
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,534
Ma'am, I need you to lay
back down.

164
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:03,902
The doctor
hasn't released you.

165
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,236
What?

166
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,671
You have a blood clot
in your leg that is traveling.

167
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,239
It could cause a stroke
if it's not treated.

168
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,774
Okay, you know what,
you know what?

169
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,776
Until you get your degree
and become a doctor,

170
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,111
you come back and
tell me then.

171
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,846
It's too early in
the morning, Mom.

172
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,381
Can you just, like,
do what they say?

173
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,949
Just lay back
and relax.

174
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,418
Everything'll be fine.

175
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,053
<i>( mother )</i>
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>that Pauletta called me</i>

176
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,422
and told me that Uncle was
riding his bike the other day

177
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,257
and got
hit by a truck?

178
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,961
What-- who-- oh-- Granny's
uncle Uncle?

179
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,130
That-- man, he's like 93.

180
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,531
<i>Is he still alive?</i>

181
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,501
Gavin Enzell Miller,

182
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,203
don't you dare
laugh at the fact

183
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,071
<i>that a 93-year-old man</i>

184
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,007
got hit by a truck.

185
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,241
Oh, we laughing at her?

186
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,643
We're having a
meeting here.

187
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,177
We're good, Mother--
Mother, listen.

188
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,579
What do you
expect him to do?

189
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,347
Stay stuck in that house,
trapped there until he dies?

190
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,483
<i>I hope you don't</i>
<i>expect that of me.</i>

191
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,051
No, Mom.

192
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,119
Mom.

193
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,420
No, hey.

194
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,088
Mom, no, no, no,
look, listen.

195
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,356
I'm not laugh-- I'm laughing
at something.

196
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,558
We were in here being-- I'm
with a friend and--

197
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,427
Yeah, no,
I'm not laughing at you.

198
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,195
Something else, yeah.

199
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,065
Yeah, well, you go keep kikiing
about something else.

200
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,667
I'm gonna
go see my uncle.

201
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:13,805
So, yeah, what I'll do,
Mom, I'll call Pauletta,

202
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,340
check in on Unc,

203
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,343
and when I do that,
I'll give you a call back, Mom.

204
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,512
That's what I'm gonna do because
I'm in a meeting.

205
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,780
Gavin.

206
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:25,316
<i>Mom, I said I'll check on</i>
<i>it, I'll check on it.</i>

207
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,352
Okay.

208
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,887
All right.

209
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,822
I'm so sorry.

210
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,863
How many eggs
you want?

211
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,131
( Georgia )
Hmm?

212
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,299
How many eggs
you want?

213
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,534
Every morning you
ask me the same question

214
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,335
and every morning the answer
is still the same,

215
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,738
so let me
set the record straight.

216
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,275
I'm gonna have two eggs for
the rest of my life, Gary.

217
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:51,342
Okay?

218
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,610
Two eggs?
Two eggs.

219
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,679
Always two,
it's always been two.

220
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,981
You want a little hot wing
with that egg?

221
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,084
You better stop.

222
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,085
Mmm, here it is
right there.

223
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,053
( boy )
Mama.

224
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,888
Mama!

225
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,690
The kids.

226
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,192
I don't know what you're
embarrassed by.

227
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,728
It took two eggs to
make the both of you.

228
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,062
And a hot wing.

229
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,964
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

230
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,503
Oh, and just because it's
almost summer,

231
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,671
don't think
you're gonna be lounging around

232
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:20,805
and hanging out.

233
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:21,940
Mm-hmm.

234
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,308
Mama, what are you
talking about?

235
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,576
Your test.

236
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,810
You need to be studying.

237
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,245
Mm-hmm.

238
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,546
I don't, really.

239
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,814
Excuse me.

240
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,649
Get smart with your
studying, not with your mother.

241
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:32,851
Get smart.

242
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,285
Mama, I will pass
the test.

243
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,854
I promise.

244
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,992
And that's how it starts.

245
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,962
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

246
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,430
On a plate, sir.

247
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,874
Come here.

248
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,211
Muah.

249
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,714
If my lip
breaks out in a rash,

250
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,682
I'm calling Child
Protective Services.

251
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,017
( Georgia )
Oh, shut up.

252
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,385
I don't know where his lips
have been.

253
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,920
I can show you,
better not tell you.

254
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,289
Okay, stop.

255
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,957
Aren't you forgetting
someone?

256
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,594
No.

257
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,363
Gavin.

258
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,331
Wait up.

259
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,332
Come here.

260
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,333
( kissing )

261
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,401
Go on, baby.

262
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,370
Come on, man.

263
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,505
I ain't trying to be
waiting on you.

264
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,410
I don't even know why
I even stopped by, you know.

265
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,650
Talking about
you and I--

266
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,587
I really feel
bad about what happened.

267
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,658
I mean, I know I caused you
a lot of trouble and I--

268
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,330
I feel like
it was my fault.

269
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,799
I, um...

270
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,635
I never got to say
it, but...

271
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,042
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,145
But you're really busy,
so I'm gonna go.

273
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,787
You didn't deserve that.

274
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,589
Can I take you
to dinner?

275
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,124
Well, if
I can make it my treat.

276
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,627
Okay.

277
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,495
I'll be in town
'til Friday.

278
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,970
Call me.

279
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,805
Oh, wow.

280
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:43,214
We'll see you Tuesday.

281
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,782
Have a good day.

282
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,732
You again, Miss Miller?

283
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,101
You again, Nurse Reed?

284
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,235
Whatever.

285
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,170
Proceed.

286
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,171
Behave.

287
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,172
You behave.

288
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,173
You behave.
You behave.

289
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,175
You...
You behave.

290
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,543
Okay, hold up.

291
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,479
Not today.

292
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,080
Proceed.

293
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,424
Hi, how
are you today?

294
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,426
Hey, sweetie--
Can I get you anything

295
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,727
while you're waiting for
your guest?

296
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,830
Yes, I would
like a French connection

297
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:38,036
and a tequila sunrise with
a shot of Patron silver

298
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,672
and a splash of pineapple.

299
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:41,673
Thank you.
You got it.

300
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,141
All right.

301
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,309
( Dre )
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

302
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,679
So, so sorry... traffic
was crazy,

303
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,547
silly, quite honestly.

304
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:54,786
Wow, you
look absolutely exquisite.

305
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,054
Thank you.

306
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,856
Tell me again why you
do not have my kids.

307
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,024
Wow.

308
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,492
Because we're
BFFs, remember?

309
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,194
Wow.

310
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,707
What's up?

311
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,275
Stop, stupid.

312
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,509
Dang.

313
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,644
Whatever.

314
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,645
What is all of
this anyway?

315
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,946
Who you trying to
look cute for?

316
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,314
You know it's too hot
for all of this.

317
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,583
Nobody, shut up.

318
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,019
What's up, Dre?

319
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,253
So is this it?

320
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,655
Oh, yeah.

321
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,157
Look, I can't say my
dad is the most stylish brother.

322
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,093
Anything is better
than this.

323
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,829
'Sup?

324
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,297
What?

325
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,531
Dang.

326
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,192
But you know you look
good, right?

327
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,028
Just trying to keep
up with the "Man Of The Year,"

328
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,662
that's all.

329
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,631
Congratulations,
by the way.
Thank you.

330
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,899
This is--
It's nice.

331
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,267
It's pretty impressive.

332
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,468
You know I don't really
care much

333
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,903
for all that kind
of stuff,

334
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,405
but I can tell you,
it does help with business.

335
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,773
I did a blog for
the magazine.

336
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,641
Actually, they
want me to write an article,

337
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,877
write more of a blog,
actually, for it, so...

338
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,478
Wow, okay.

339
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,679
I don't know, I'm really
thinking about

340
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,814
turning some of that stuff
into a book.

341
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:30,848
As you should.
Yeah.

342
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,784
"The Adventures
of Gavin Miller."

343
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:35,553
That's a story
for sure.
It is, it is.

344
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,555
I've been thinking a
lot about high school lately.

345
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,090
Really?

346
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,591
Yeah.

347
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,560
Why is that?

348
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,266
Stop, stop.

349
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,835
Oh, you
get on my nerves.

350
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,271
I can't believe you got me up
here at school

351
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,839
on a Saturday.

352
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,674
Don't trip,
it's only for an hour.

353
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,209
Well, I told Thor to meet
us up here.

354
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,811
What you
do that for?

355
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,546
'Cause it's boring.

356
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:02,780
All right, well, you be the one
to tell my mama

357
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,215
why I didn't
get into Morehouse.

358
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,550
What?

359
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,552
Boy, you could pass that test
with your eyes closed.

360
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,087
Stop it.

361
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,388
You're gonna pass
the test.

362
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,489
Don't worry
about it, all right?

363
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,857
All right.

364
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,729
What's up?

365
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,532
Look at your cousin,
what's wrong with him?

366
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,401
Come on, it's a
public place.

367
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,871
Oh, God.

368
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,107
Mo.

369
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,477
Mo!

370
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,978
What, fool?

371
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,713
Can't you see I'm busy?

372
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,248
I thought you were on
house arrest.

373
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,249
And I thought
you were supposed to stay

374
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:39,517
out my business, Dre.

375
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,855
The future president of
the United States,

376
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,523
ladies and gentlemen.

377
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,731
Hey, check this
out, remix.

378
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,566
You

379
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,936
You got a disease

380
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,472
And you say it's
just a rash

381
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,241
But you got it
up your ass

382
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,043
Oh baby you

383
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,814
( woman )
Hey, Dre.

384
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,415
What's up?
What?

385
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,519
Hey.

386
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,686
Hey.

387
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:19,423
Oh, these are so cute,
your overalls.

388
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,625
So what's up?

389
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,393
You taking dance, too?

390
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,262
Yeah, you?

391
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,698
Yeah.

392
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,600
Okay.
Let's go.

393
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,801
I ain't dealing with
these herbs.

394
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,036
Oh, wait a minute.

395
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,741
When did y'all get
to be friends?

396
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:37,842
We're not.

397
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,077
Well, she can be
friends with me.

398
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,613
Word?
What's up, girl?

399
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,015
Dang, you smell good.

400
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,984
Stop, don't play.

401
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,786
So um...

402
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,555
I'll call you later.

403
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,056
I guess.

404
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,159
I love the one-strap thing,
that's so cute.

405
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,730
Did she say
anything about me?

406
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,965
I don't know.

407
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,367
Why don't you go
ask her yourself?

408
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,669
No, it's cool.

409
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,571
You need to be hanging out
with some girls anyways.

410
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,173
If you don't want me
around, you can just say so.

411
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,241
Girl, stop playing.

412
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,509
You know that's not
what I'm saying.

413
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,677
What's up with
you today anyway?

414
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,278
Nothing.

415
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,980
Hey, so I've been thinking
about it, right?

416
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,349
And it's time for you
to hook me up

417
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,885
with your
fine-ass sister Natalie.

418
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,220
Natalie?

419
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,088
Boy, please, you
tripping.

420
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,523
You couldn't get
with Natalie if she had one eye,

421
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,558
a wooden leg
and a kickstand.

422
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,160
Oh, he got you.

423
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,228
( woman )
Gavin!

424
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,200
Are you serious?

425
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,835
What's up?

426
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,575
Okay, a little
deep, I get it, I get it.

427
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,143
I'll come up.

428
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,612
I'll lighten that.

429
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,013
How's your mom?

430
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,214
My mom is good.

431
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,649
She's doing okay, I'm
gonna see her later,

432
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,718
thank you for asking.

433
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,455
Yes, for
the lady, please.

434
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,557
Enjoy.
Wow.

435
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,392
You remembered.

436
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,694
Of course I did.

437
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,697
Cheers.

438
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,532
Cheers.

439
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,277
What?

440
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,779
I had someone stop past
my office today.

441
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,814
Okay.

442
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,384
Who was that?

443
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,553
Rochelle Davis.

444
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,189
Yeah.

445
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,191
You knew that was
gonna happen.

446
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,260
Yeah, well.

447
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,329
You sure you
want to do that?

448
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,464
Do what, I haven't said
anything yet.

449
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,099
I'm just saying, you
wouldn't have brought it up

450
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,568
if you weren't
trying to explore it.

451
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,903
Blogging, reminiscing.

452
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,571
I'm just taking the girl
to dinner.

453
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,041
I'm not marrying her.

454
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,876
I'm waiting on you.

455
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,514
Whatever.

456
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,582
Anyway.
Right.

457
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,052
Listen, just don't call
on the BFF

458
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,187
to come
pick up the pieces.

459
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,423
Okay.
People don't change.

460
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,293
( school bell ringing )

461
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,698
Yo, where'd Gavin go?

462
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,865
I don't know.

463
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:15,966
He not
even in here.

464
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,034
He got me up here
on a Saturday.

465
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,469
I'm not
even taking this test.

466
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:20,071
You should just
take it.

467
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:21,238
And then next year, all
you gotta do

468
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,673
is take four classes.

469
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,108
Why do you
think I'm here?

470
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,681
Oh, my God.

471
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,816
Thor.

472
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,217
Why is he here?

473
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,752
Who, Rasheed?

474
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,554
He's cool.

475
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,724
Hey, let's get this
show on the road.

476
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:40,825
Time is money.

477
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:41,892
Well, I guess you ain't
got no time

478
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,961
'cause you sure
as hell ain't got no money.

479
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,529
You need to pull your
shoes up.

480
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,697
On top of
that, you need to give

481
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,399
Fred Sanford back his
toughskins.

482
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,767
You expecting a flood?

483
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:50,968
Man, don't worry
about it.

484
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,236
At least your
mama wasn't complaining

485
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,071
when they was down around my
ankles last night.

486
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,439
And who
told your big ass

487
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:56,874
to wear a striped
shirt anyway?

488
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,843
Over there looking
like a big ass circus tent.

489
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,644
( laughing )

490
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,780
Man, shut up,
just wait.

491
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,348
Hey look,
your mama's so poor,

492
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,950
I saw her at the 99 cent store
the other day

493
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,752
complaining about
higher prices.

494
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,453
Ha, ha, ha!

495
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,922
Wahh-wahh,
man, that was whack.

496
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,991
Hey man, why your mama named
you Thor anyway?

497
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,960
What's your
brother name, He-Man?

498
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:18,028
All right, all right,
settle down.

499
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,740
I like your hair
down like that.

500
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,812
I mean, you look pretty.

501
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,151
Dre.

502
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,753
( laughing )

503
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,655
You got dissed,
homey.

504
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,157
Let it go.

505
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,358
Here man, let me help
you pick your face

506
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
up off the ground.

507
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,595
Man, stop, stop
playing.

508
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,030
You look pretty,
Dre.

509
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,699
You usually look like a
boy, and I like boys,

510
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,101
but today you look
like a girl,

511
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,969
and I like girls,

512
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,205
so I guess I like
you, too.

513
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:02,506
Get slapped.

514
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,241
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

515
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,709
Get slapped.

516
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,212
I'm turning back
into a man, Rasheed!

517
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:09,980
Am I pretty now?

518
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,415
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey...

519
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,757
...Don't sit here.

520
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,459
Take these.

521
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,035
Rochelle.

522
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,337
Hey.

523
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:37,041
Rochelle.

524
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:39,109
Hey, I didn't know you was
taking this test.

525
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,078
Why would you?

526
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,681
( bell ringing )

527
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,653
There's an old saying.

528
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,590
That "Youth is wasted
on the young."

529
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:56,360
Don't let
that be the truth.

530
00:24:56,362 --> 00:25:01,165
You all need to be preparing
for college now.

531
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,601
Because after
high school, time flies

532
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,035
and before you
know it,

533
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,405
you'll have a full-time job
that doesn't hardly pay enough,

534
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:12,142
you'll have a ridiculous
amount of bills,

535
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:16,013
kids and a wife

536
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,382
will suck even
more money out of you.

537
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,650
Rochelle!

538
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:23,721
And you'll wonder where
your dreams went at all.

539
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,691
Hey, Rochelle!

540
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,298
What?

541
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,233
You looking real
stupid right now.

542
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,372
I'm out.

543
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,775
Hey, where you going?

544
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,210
Hey, Dre.

545
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,479
Hold up.

546
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:50,114
Wait!

547
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,782
Wait!

548
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,757
Does anyone else feel
compelled to take Saturday off?

549
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,761
( Georgia )
I need help and
you know that.

550
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:05,329
These boys are not free.

551
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,330
( Gary )
Ugh.

552
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:09,033
Stop all that
noise, man.

553
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,868
Ain't nothing out there.

554
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,903
I been looking.

555
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,440
Shoot, this world...

556
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:19,009
( Gavin )
Home wasn't quite
home sweet home.

557
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:22,246
How many times
we gotta go over that?

558
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,516
Why you gotta keep--
I need help, Gary.

559
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:27,718
Kids ain't free.

560
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,424
I mean, you know, Isaiah's
my responsibility, okay?

561
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,492
Gavin, you know...

562
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,027
you need to talk
to his daddy.

563
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,329
Excuse the hell
out of me.

564
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:39,763
Come on, baby.
No, no, no, no.

565
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,699
Excuse the hell
out of me.

566
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,067
Excuse the
hell out of me.

567
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,235
So I guess I shouldn't be
taking care of your broke ass.

568
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,204
No, let's be real, you want
to keep it real?

569
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,606
You want to
keep it real?

570
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,741
'Cause Isaiah's your son
and Gavin is mine,

571
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:51,942
so I'm
gonna keep it real.

572
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,877
I mean, after all, you got a
mama and you got a daddy

573
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,646
and I'm not your wife,

574
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,448
so I guess I shouldn't
be taking care of you either.

575
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,716
Am I right?

576
00:26:58,718 --> 00:26:59,917
And for what?

577
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,352
So you can go out
there and try to find yourself

578
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:02,920
while the rest of
the world works?

579
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,088
Huh?

580
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,457
Playing second fiddle
in, of all places, "The Keg"

581
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,158
in a band that ain't
going nowhere.

582
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,393
How you know
where we're going, Georgia?

583
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,028
I said it, in a band that
ain't going nowhere.

584
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,630
Why you say things
like that to me?

585
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,565
Now all of a sudden--
You know what?

586
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:18,469
Now all of a sudden, Gavin
is not your responsibility.

587
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,304
Well, check this out.

588
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,373
You knew it was a
package deal.

589
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,041
You knew it
from the very beginning.

590
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,443
You knew it coming in here,
and I'm sorry,

591
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,680
I mean, not just coming
in here, coming in my home,

592
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:32,783
through my door in my house
that I pay for

593
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,318
and now
you want to tell me

594
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,720
that Gavin is not my
responsibility.

595
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,455
Well, check this out.

596
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:39,723
You know what?

597
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:40,924
You can get to stepping.

598
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,192
That's right.
Come on, come on--

599
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,293
Get off me!

600
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,762
No, fuck you, get off me!

601
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,030
Gavin, Gavin,
Gavin, Gavin!

602
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,965
Gavin, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

603
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,600
You a man now, boy, you
a man now?

604
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,301
Stop, sit down, Gary.

605
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,403
You better keep your
hands off my mama.

606
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:53,570
You what?
Stop, stop.

607
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,072
Boy, you lucky I'm not
in my right mind.

608
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,473
I'll whoop your
ass, boy.

609
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,574
Gary, sit down.
You better sit--

610
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,677
You know what, you
know what?

611
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,412
Stop, stop, stop it--
Gary, sit down.

612
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:02,880
I know when I'm
not wanted.

613
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,148
Mm-hmm.

614
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,382
Okay, Gavin, stop, stop.

615
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,450
Gavin!

616
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,618
Stop.

617
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,186
Stop.

618
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,721
It's okay.

619
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,856
Just calm down.

620
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,591
So that's it?

621
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,427
Everything's cool now?

622
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,362
You're just gonna
let him stay?

623
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,431
It's complicated.

624
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,766
It's complicated, you
don't understand.

625
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,702
Let me handle it.

626
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,704
I'll make it right.

627
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,505
Let me handle it.

628
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,007
I understand.

629
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,282
Now you see this,
right here?

630
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,217
My son.

631
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,119
My baby.

632
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:47,257
( sobbing )

633
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,258
( knocking )

634
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,532
( knocking )

635
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,770
Oh God.

636
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,938
You're kidding, right?

637
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,446
What?

638
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,516
Hey, can I crash?

639
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:48,585
You know my mama don't
want no boys sleeping over.

640
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,020
We've been best friends
since kindergarten.

641
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,889
Your mama know me.

642
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:55,893
I'll leave
before she wake up.

643
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,361
( door closing )

644
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,531
Shh!

645
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:01,765
Man.

646
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,170
Thanks.

647
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,955
What's the matter?

648
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,491
Nothing, just...

649
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,393
thinking.

650
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,461
Nothing or are you
just thinking?

651
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,699
My mama and Gary got into
another fight

652
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:38,135
and I jumped in.

653
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,436
She took up for him
after he said

654
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:42,406
I wasn't
his responsibility.

655
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,274
Why would she
do that?

656
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,176
He didn't say that.

657
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,846
Look, I heard him
say it.

658
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,714
Well, were they drinking?

659
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,316
What you think?

660
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:53,951
You already know
he was.

661
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,619
Then he didn't
mean it.

662
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:58,989
I mean, people say all
kind of stuff when they drunk.

663
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,359
He meant it.

664
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,594
You know what, I don't
even care,

665
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:07,030
I can't
stand him anyway.

666
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,533
I didn't tell anyone
I already took the exit exam

667
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,002
and passed it.

668
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,871
I don't even have to do
senior year.

669
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:14,938
I'm ready to
just graduate early

670
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,673
and just bounce already.

671
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,075
What?

672
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,610
That scholarship to
Morehouse only requires me

673
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,745
to pass the exit exam.

674
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:23,814
I don't even have to take
the aptitude test.

675
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:27,184
But you're still
taking it?

676
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:28,752
Yeah.

677
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:29,753
For what?

678
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:30,854
For fun?

679
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,289
I guess.

680
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:35,726
Oh, God, you're such
a herb.

681
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:36,927
I don't know.

682
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,662
I'm just buying time.

683
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:40,597
I'm only here for
you anyways.

684
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,698
'Cause I know that when we
go to college,

685
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,500
we gonna
lose each other.

686
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,768
Nuh-uh.

687
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,304
Dre, you're going
to UCLA.

688
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,106
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

689
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,070
( footsteps )

690
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,072
Hurry!

691
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,675
Get in there.

692
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,376
No, get in the closet.

693
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,911
Wait!

694
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:01,878
Hey, you know what?

695
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,747
I'm gonna
just leave, 'cause--

696
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,182
No.

697
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:06,383
I don't want you to
get in trouble.

698
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:07,684
No, stay.

699
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,920
Get some sleep.

700
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:12,189
All right.

701
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:14,758
On this side, though.
On this side.

702
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,006
She a skizza.

703
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,741
No boys in here.

704
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:34,211
She ain't got no
butt anyway.

705
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,179
Miss, can I go to
the bathroom?

706
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,714
Please?
Go ahead.

707
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,149
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

708
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,684
Hit the music on
your way out.

709
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,152
Yes, ma'am.

710
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,453
( music blasting )

711
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,856
Ladies, that's
enough warm-up.

712
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,224
I want to see
what you got.

713
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,558
First positions, please.

714
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,760
Can I
be in front?

715
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:52,195
Of course.

716
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,734
Five, six, seven, eight.

717
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,736
One, two.

718
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:00,971
Very nice.

719
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:03,240
Three, four, five,

720
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:06,476
six, seven, eight, one--

721
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:07,978
Every rehearsal should
be treated

722
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,380
like you were
on stage at Carnegie Hall.

723
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,750
Five, six, seven.

724
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,186
Rochelle, really?

725
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:17,988
Looking very sloppy.

726
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,523
Four, five.

727
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:21,191
Beautiful, nice arms.

728
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:25,095
Seven, eight,
one, two.

729
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,030
Nice pique turns,
Andrea.

730
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,266
Very nice, excellent.

731
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:32,502
Six, seven, eight.

732
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,604
One, two.

733
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,173
Good job.

734
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:40,777
Four, five, six,
seven, eight.

735
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,145
No lazy hands.

736
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,547
One, two.

737
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,919
Very, very nice,
ladies, good job.

738
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,921
I'm back,
what'd I miss?

739
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,189
( woman )
Everything.

740
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,790
Cool.

741
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,158
( Rochelle )
My solo was good.

742
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,360
( woman )
You did good.

743
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,329
Thank you.

744
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,697
She can't even
do a split.

745
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,099
I know.

746
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,301
( woman )
Your friend ghetto,
let's go, girl.

747
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,702
Thank you,
Ms. Harris.

748
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,637
Yeah, but none of this
in my class, okay?

749
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,073
Call me, call me.
Bye, girls.

750
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,908
Hoo hoo, Cherish, baby.

751
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,143
Hey, let me get
your number.

752
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:16,179
No.
Wait.

753
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:17,848
Hello, come on.

754
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,250
No?

755
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:22,419
Hoo hoo, damn.

756
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:27,224
Dre, what up?

757
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,758
Hey, that was dope.

758
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,660
Where'd you learn to do
all them turns and stuff?

759
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,662
Goodbye, I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

760
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,264
( woman )
Bye, Ms. Harris.

761
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,899
And that's fresh.

762
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,000
Thanks.

763
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,669
You know the show is
next week, right?

764
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:40,670
You nervous?

765
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,405
Kind of.

766
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:45,342
Look, Gavin came to my house
last night, right?

767
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,843
Like 2:00
in the morning.

768
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,612
Word?
Yeah.

769
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:50,147
I knew
something had to be wrong.

770
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,781
He said his mom...

771
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,350
Hey.
...and Gary--

772
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:55,385
Mind if I talk to
Dre for a minute?

773
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,820
Go ahead.

774
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,321
Alone.

775
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,925
You gonna be outside?

776
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,727
Yeah.

777
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,462
Old fake
ass Wonder Woman.

778
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,867
Hey, so.

779
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,503
I was just wanting to
ask you something.

780
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,804
I mean, I know we're not
the best of friends,

781
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,440
but we cool, right?

782
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,975
What you getting at?

783
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,177
Well, I was just
wondering.

784
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,244
Are you and Gavin--

785
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:22,379
Are you guys like
a thing?

786
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,547
Are y'all just friends?

787
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:24,981
I mean, I know you guys
are friends,

788
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:26,716
but I just
thought that I'd come to you

789
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,351
and ask, like,
you know,

790
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,455
'cause I don't want to step
on anybody's toes or anything.

791
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:33,456
But, um...

792
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,058
Why do you care?

793
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,460
I mean, what's up with you
and my cousin Maurice?

794
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,696
I don't
want to go out with Mo.

795
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,732
I mean, Gavin, he's always,
you know, flirting

796
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,835
and he's cute,
and we cool, so...

797
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,571
So I don't really
think it's any of your business.

798
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,072
You know what?

799
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,874
I told you not to try
and ask her.

800
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,242
You know
she likes him.

801
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:55,779
Why you think she always
running up behind him?

802
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,380
You were right.
I know.

803
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,782
He's fair game.

804
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,617
You know, you better off
with Maurice anyway.

805
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,719
I'm telling you,
don't mess with that herb.

806
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,788
He's not a herb.
He is a herb!

807
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,057
He can't dress,
he's goofy,

808
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,659
he doesn't have a job
and he doesn't have a car.

809
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,894
What?

810
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,796
Hold up, you got
it twisted.

811
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,798
Gavin got like a 2000 on
his SATs

812
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,534
and will probably
skip senior year altogether.

813
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:18,768
He don't work 'cause his
mama want him

814
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,971
to focus on school.

815
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:22,672
And don't worry
about him not having a car.

816
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,007
You ain't got no car.

817
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:26,610
He's still a loser.

818
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:27,611
You know what?

819
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:30,180
I'm gonna give
you a pass.

820
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:31,248
I'll meet you outside.

821
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,720
Hold up, I'm coming.

822
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:40,156
Listen, don't
say I ain't ask you.

823
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,491
Your loss.

824
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:50,767
And most important,
everyone please remain qui-et.

825
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,172
Thank you.

826
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:59,709
That means no talking.

827
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:02,846
No note passing.

828
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:05,915
No party planning.

829
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,718
No nothing.

830
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,091
Thank you.

831
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,863
( loud thudding )

832
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,231
Whoa, I'm here,
I'm here!

833
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,500
This is not a rest
home, sir.

834
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,502
You may want to
try reading your book sometime.

835
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:28,505
I'm afraid osmosis isn't gonna
work in this case.

836
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,178
Upton Sinclair's
"The Jungle."

837
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,314
A very interesting
read about child labor

838
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,050
laws in the 1900s.

839
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,251
A little beyond your realm
of understanding,

840
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:44,120
don't you think?

841
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,889
Actually, child-labor laws
didn't even exist

842
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,290
before "The Jungle."

843
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,059
Sinclair's book
brought attention not only

844
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,360
to the maiming
of children,

845
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,129
which was commonplace
in the meatpacking plants,

846
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,898
but it also shed a light on
the mistreatment of

847
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,533
impoverished
workers in general,

848
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,401
prompting legislation to be
passed implementing

849
00:38:58,403 --> 00:38:59,636
a federal minimum wage

850
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:04,174
and implementing
age restrictions on employers.

851
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:08,211
But I guess that's what you
meant, right, Mr. Katz?

852
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,647
Try getting some rest
at night, Gavin.

853
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:14,751
Who knows what you might
learn if you actually tried?

854
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,187
Put the book away.

855
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,692
This is a timed test.

856
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,461
I'll be watching.

857
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,430
( woman )
So?

858
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,531
Yeah, I'm gonna
be there.

859
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,999
Okay, good.

860
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,334
Who else coming?

861
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,602
I'mma be there.

862
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:33,603
Oh, okay.

863
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:34,904
You trying
to play me, Sam?

864
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:35,905
What's up, Dre?

865
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,207
Hey.

866
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,942
Ew, stank.

867
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:40,443
You coming to my party?

868
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,312
I don't know yet.

869
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:44,447
Okay, I see I need
to call you.

870
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,949
Call me.

871
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:48,017
Bye, Thor.

872
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,387
Why you such a whore?

873
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,655
Hey, she came up to me.

874
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,157
What's up with you?

875
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,326
Nothing.

876
00:39:56,328 --> 00:39:58,161
Okay.

877
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:59,429
What's up, Dre?

878
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,364
So anyways.

879
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,133
So like I was saying
earlier, right?

880
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,235
Apparently his mom and
Gary got into it

881
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,403
and they was--

882
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,704
What?

883
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,506
Don't you
see I'm talking, dang?

884
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:10,540
My bad.

885
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,075
One thing, though,
real quick.

886
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,543
What is it?

887
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:14,677
They're having
a dance over--

888
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,012
I mean, they're having
a party over here.

889
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,180
Yeah, and...?

890
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:18,281
You going?

891
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,950
I don't know.

892
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,318
Is that it?

893
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,586
Look, I don't know.

894
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,155
I thought maybe we
could go together.

895
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:28,191
Uh, who brings
sand to the beach?

896
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:30,093
Why you always acting
like you all that?

897
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,728
All stank and shit, huh?

898
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,763
Look, I'm feeling
you, all right?

899
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,131
The party is B-Y-O-B

900
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,933
and I like to drink
to my taste

901
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,736
and not let anybody
make decisions for me.

902
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:40,937
You feel me?

903
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,439
Don't talk to
me like that.

904
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,742
You must got me twisted
with someone else, fool.

905
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,010
Whatever.

906
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:48,678
Later for you, buster.

907
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,281
I'm out.

908
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,585
Rasheed.

909
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,024
Look, I don't drink,

910
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:05,895
but maybe you can
dance with me.

911
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,465
A slow one so I can
feel on your booty?

912
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,667
Don't push it.

913
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:13,636
Oh, that's what I'm
talking about.

914
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:16,072
You old fake ass
Christopher Williams.

915
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,374
Hey, you gotta show
'em who's boss.

916
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,376
Use that lightskinnedness
to your benefit.

917
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,778
What?

918
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,646
Oh, you
like it rough, huh, Dre?

919
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,114
Whatever.

920
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,083
Listen, so Gavin's over
my house, right?

921
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,185
Telling me how his
mom and Gary were fighting,

922
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,688
he jumped in, his mom ends up
taking up for Gary

923
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,456
after he said that
he wasn't his responsibility

924
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:34,624
or his daddy,

925
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:36,559
totally stabbing G in
the back, right?

926
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,528
Word?
Yeah, so check it.

927
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,063
He's at my house and he's
all upset

928
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:42,465
telling me how he wants to
graduate from school early

929
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:44,367
and go to college,
I mean...

930
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,635
Look, long story short.

931
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,704
Too late.
What?

932
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:49,072
You get on my nerves.

933
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:50,406
Listen.

934
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,242
So I go to give
him a hug, right?

935
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,277
And y'all did it.

936
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,812
Ooh, I know y'all
did it.

937
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,413
And that fool
didn't tell me shit neither.

938
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:58,848
No, stupid, we didn't
do it.

939
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,817
Holding out.
Ahh, you get on my nerves.

940
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:03,820
Listen!

941
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:06,022
He kissed me.

942
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,091
Oh, well,
there you go right there.

943
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:09,993
What more do you need?

944
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,896
What's the problem?

945
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:15,331
What else happened?

946
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,568
Nothing.

947
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,304
Nothing!

948
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,839
All right, he was feeling
on my titties

949
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,240
and my mom came to
the door--

950
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:26,109
Oh snap, G got to rub
on your titties?

951
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:27,977
What you mean
"got to"?

952
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:31,548
Ooh, I knew I shouldn't have
told you, stupid.

953
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,417
Look, I
was just playing.

954
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:36,319
I don't know what
to do.

955
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:39,923
Just tell
him how you feel.

956
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,591
You think I should?

957
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:43,159
Yeah.

958
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,886
( Dre )
"We've been friends for some
time, I mean,

959
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:46,089
and I was thinking--"

960
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,791
No, you can't
start out like that, Dre.

961
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,027
Everybody starts out
like that.

962
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,298
"What up?

963
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,967
You wanna be
with me or not?"

964
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,636
Shit, that's too harsh.

965
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,270
He'll think I'm
a bitch.

966
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,295
"I love you."

967
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:28,031
"I love you?"

968
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:30,566
Come on, Dre, you can't--
( Gavin )
Dre!

969
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:31,668
Where you been, girl?

970
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,036
I been looking
for you all day.

971
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,604
I got my test back.

972
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,343
Hey.

973
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,678
Hey.

974
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,513
Hey, I passed my test.

975
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:47,950
Good for you.

976
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:50,386
So how's everything
with your moms?

977
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,088
Fine, I guess.

978
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,556
She called us up making
it up to me on the strength

979
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:56,092
by taking us shopping at the
Slawson swap meet this weekend.

980
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:58,061
Word?

981
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:59,395
Well, praise God,

982
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:00,863
I mean, something
good gonna come out of it.

983
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,799
What you trying to say?

984
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,333
Nothing.

985
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:05,702
What?

986
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,205
So you coming to the party?

987
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,940
You know we gotta
celebrate.

988
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:12,475
I don't know.

989
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:14,110
You didn't ask me.

990
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:15,645
Girl, come on with
all of that.

991
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,280
You want me to
pick you up?

992
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:18,581
With what car?

993
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,516
Your mom buying you a car
at the swap meet, too?

994
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:22,919
Thor gonna take us.

995
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,922
Well, all right, I mean,
yeah, I'll do it.

996
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:27,390
You better not
flake out, either.

997
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,058
I'm not.

998
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,132
So I wanted to talk to you
about the other night.

999
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:39,869
Me, too.

1000
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:41,804
You can go--
Oh, you go--

1001
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:46,142
No, go ahead, go ahead.

1002
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:48,578
So you know you're
my girl, right?

1003
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,913
You're always
there for me.

1004
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,949
And that's dope,
for real.

1005
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,217
Like, I don't know what
happened the other night

1006
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,319
but I never
saw you like,

1007
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,721
like a girl until
the other night.

1008
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:00,590
It was so weird.

1009
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,126
When did you get
that banging body?

1010
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:05,695
I must have slept.

1011
00:46:05,697 --> 00:46:09,999
What I'm trying to say is,
I know it was a mistake.

1012
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,068
I shouldn't have got
at you like that.

1013
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:17,006
Like what?

1014
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:19,375
I shouldn't have kissed
you, all right?

1015
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:23,279
I apologize and I
just don't want to lose you.

1016
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:28,117
You're my best friend,
so I'm sorry.

1017
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,353
Will you forgive me?

1018
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:32,121
Yeah, sure.

1019
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,290
All right, cool.

1020
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,493
So what did you want
to say?

1021
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:40,163
Same thing,
you said it.

1022
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:42,932
Well, you said you wanted
to talk to me, too.

1023
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:46,202
What did you want
to say, Dre?

1024
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:48,404
Nothing, you said it.

1025
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:49,806
Look, I--

1026
00:46:49,808 --> 00:46:52,108
I forgot I can't go.

1027
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,044
I gotta go somewhere
with my sister.

1028
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:57,647
No, wait!

1029
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:59,916
We was just up front.

1030
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:02,151
Hey, we coming to
get you still.

1031
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,452
So be ready!

1032
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,035
( woman )
Natalie?

1033
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:21,204
Andrea?

1034
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:22,438
Who's that?

1035
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,073
It's me, Mama, Dre.

1036
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:25,775
Okay.

1037
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,482
Hi, baby.

1038
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:36,018
I gotta pee!

1039
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,554
Are you okay?

1040
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:42,258
Yeah, yeah.

1041
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,160
Okay, I'll be out here.

1042
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:46,362
( sobbing )

1043
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:57,006
( singing )

1044
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,663
Dre.

1045
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:22,598
Andrea!

1046
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,733
Ugh!

1047
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,167
What?

1048
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:26,636
Don't quit your day job.

1049
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:27,637
Oh, my goodness.
Whatever.

1050
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:29,405
Yanay called.

1051
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,773
Well, I'm
being dark right now.

1052
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:32,208
Hold my calls.

1053
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,343
Oh, okay...

1054
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:35,711
but Gavin called.

1055
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:37,079
Huh?

1056
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,547
Gavin called.

1057
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:39,949
Why'd you tell
him we had to go somewhere?

1058
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:41,350
Why didn't
you give me the phone?

1059
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:42,852
Because I was on
the phone

1060
00:48:42,854 --> 00:48:44,720
and I thought you
were being dark right now.

1061
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:46,289
What did he say?

1062
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,590
You didn't tell him we
didn't have to go nowhere,

1063
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,759
did you?
Yes.

1064
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,727
He said to tell you
they're on the way.

1065
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,296
I told him
I wasn't going.

1066
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:55,231
Like I care.

1067
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,466
Ooh, thank you, I'm
borrowing this.

1068
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:58,868
Get on my nerves, dang.

1069
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,741
All right, Dre.

1070
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,743
Look, he's on his way.

1071
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:11,080
Pull it together, you
got this, come on.

1072
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:12,148
You can do this.

1073
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,587
Okay.

1074
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:20,122
Now you know
what they say the best cure

1075
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,658
for a broken heart
is, right?

1076
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,960
Revenge.

1077
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:26,028
But I
don't want revenge.

1078
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,129
That's really cute.

1079
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,297
That is really cute.

1080
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,598
Yes, you do, honey.

1081
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,967
Let's get it together.

1082
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,835
You are my little
sister, okay?

1083
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,637
Need I say more?

1084
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,372
You got to represent.

1085
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:38,307
Come on now, we gonna get
you right,

1086
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,643
we are
gonna hook you up.

1087
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,111
Yeah, it's gonna take
a little work.

1088
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,546
All right,
it's gonna take a lot of work,

1089
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:44,680
but you gonna be fly
tonight, okay?

1090
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:46,882
I'm not letting
you go out like that.

1091
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:47,950
Oh, no.

1092
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:49,885
( knocking )

1093
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,020
Who is it?

1094
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:53,723
Gavin.

1095
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:55,291
Hi, honey.

1096
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,994
Hey, Mrs. Devine.
How you doing, come on in.

1097
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:02,231
Look how big you are.

1098
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:04,066
How come you don't come
to see me anymore?

1099
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:05,668
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm
gonna come back.

1100
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,204
I'm gonna come
see you more often.

1101
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:09,972
All right, you better.

1102
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:12,341
Andrea, Gavin is here.

1103
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,442
I like that shirt.

1104
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,144
Thank you.
She's coming.

1105
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:16,245
Hey, Gavin.

1106
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:19,315
Okay, Dre, stop playing
and hurry up.

1107
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:20,549
Come on!

1108
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,918
She right behind me.

1109
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,320
Uh-uh.

1110
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:26,722
What-- what you up to?
What do you mean?

1111
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:29,125
Look at all you was
doing coming down those stairs.

1112
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:30,292
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1113
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:31,961
I don't know what you're
talking about.

1114
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:58,287
Have a good time.

1115
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,990
Bye!

1116
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:02,558
Look at you,
you did that?

1117
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,626
I did good, right?

1118
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:04,627
Yes, you did.

1119
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:06,629
She looks pretty.

1120
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:08,464
Well, it's my sister, you
know I'm gonna come through.

1121
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,325
Gavin.
Hey, Rochelle.

1122
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:38,427
You look good.
You look good, too.

1123
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,096
Wanna dance?

1124
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,532
Why you always tripping
on me, huh?

1125
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,201
Embarrassing me
in front of my boys.

1126
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:46,268
What's up with that?

1127
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,237
If I made it
easy, you wouldn't want it.

1128
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:50,039
How else I'm supposed to
know you're for real?

1129
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:52,641
Oh, so you want me to act
like the crutch or something?

1130
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,009
What's wrong with that?

1131
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,256
So what's up,
you still on your boy

1132
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:09,058
or are you ready to move on
to bigger and better things?

1133
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,363
Everybody can see
it, Dre.

1134
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:16,765
It ain't no secret.

1135
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,134
He the only one that
don't know...

1136
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:19,735
or don't care.

1137
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:22,204
Word.

1138
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,606
We're just friends.

1139
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,249
Slow down, mama.

1140
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,985
I don't like to carry
you home.

1141
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:38,087
See, my party is dope.

1142
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:00,409
Thank you for bringing
the alcohol.
I got you, I got the ID.

1143
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,811
I know, we're pretty good.
( Mo ) Woo woo!

1144
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:05,214
Yeah.

1145
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,215
No, no, no, no, no.

1146
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:07,416
No, Mo, don't be coming
up in here

1147
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:08,817
starting no shit tonight,
all right?

1148
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,452
Man, ain't nobody about
to start nothing.

1149
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:11,587
Yeah, right.

1150
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:12,955
You always
starting shit.

1151
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,023
Man, look,
quit playing, Yinay.

1152
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:15,191
No, it's Yanay.

1153
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:16,892
Don't start no shit.

1154
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,127
Yo, where's
Rochelle at, Yanay?

1155
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:19,595
I don't know where
she is.

1156
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:20,896
Mo, I'm not
playing, come on--

1157
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:24,099
Yo!

1158
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,401
Whatever, punk.

1159
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:26,402
Hey, Rochelle!

1160
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:27,403
Shit.

1161
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:28,404
Ashley, come on.

1162
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:30,773
Rochelle!

1163
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,976
Hey yo, Dice,
there she go right there.

1164
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,924
I'd be
calling the police.

1165
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:51,493
None of them fools
got heat.

1166
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:52,995
It's all right,
baby, I got it.

1167
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,710
What's up, fool--
Why you on my girl?

1168
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:08,777
You need to kick
back, man.

1169
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,416
Quit tripping, Mo.

1170
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,918
What's up?

1171
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,453
Nah, move, Dre.

1172
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:18,587
What you want,
a slanga?

1173
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:19,722
We can go right now.

1174
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:20,589
What's up?
( man )
Man, hold up, homey.

1175
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,724
Watch out, homey.

1176
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:23,125
( Mo )
Man, that's my team, boy.

1177
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,127
No, what you need to do
is get your girl.

1178
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:27,529
She the one hanging
all over Gavin's nutsack.

1179
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:28,897
No, you didn't, you--
Oh, you-- You wasn't?

1180
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,899
You wasn't?

1181
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:31,900
Nah, baby, listen,

1182
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:33,936
he just asked me
to dance, so what's up?

1183
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,571
Come on, man, they
was just dancing.

1184
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:38,340
Yo, watch out, man, watch
out, man, watch out.

1185
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:40,276
Scandalous.

1186
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:41,543
Come on.

1187
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:43,479
You lucky I'm fresh
out, Peewee.

1188
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:44,913
You better watch
your back.

1189
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,082
Man, whatever, you ain't
gonna do nothing.

1190
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:48,284
That's why I'm gonna tell
auntie Shannon

1191
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:49,918
you was out
here acting a fool.

1192
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,020
Man, go and tell Auntie.

1193
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:52,087
And matter of fact, why
don't you tell her

1194
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:53,522
you was over
here getting pissy drunk

1195
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:55,057
and being fresh while
you snitching?

1196
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,292
Whatever.

1197
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:58,894
She gonna whip your ass
is what she gonna do.

1198
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,529
Go on, walk over there and walk
two feet in front of me.

1199
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,670
Can't believe you, man.

1200
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:09,672
Leave you alone
for a second.

1201
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,242
Still?

1202
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:14,410
Man, look, go.

1203
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:15,711
Downstairs.

1204
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,517
Come on, Junior.

1205
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:23,452
Don't even
talk to me right now, Dre.

1206
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:26,388
I just saved your ass from
getting whooped.

1207
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,123
Look, you
didn't save me from shit.

1208
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,591
I didn't?

1209
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:30,859
Oh, I didn't, Gavin?

1210
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:31,994
Ain't nobody scared
of him.

1211
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:33,195
Let's just bounce,
come on, man.

1212
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:34,430
Whatever.

1213
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:35,664
If it wasn't for you and that
fake-ass bitch,

1214
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,633
it wouldn't
have happened anyway.

1215
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:39,668
Where she at now, huh?

1216
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,070
You see
her, 'cause I don't.

1217
00:55:41,072 --> 00:55:42,438
I know
you ain't talking.

1218
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,473
I saw you over there putting on
a show for everybody,

1219
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:46,342
shaking your monkey
for the whole world to see.

1220
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,943
Y'all might as well have been
just humping

1221
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:49,478
right there
on the dance floor.

1222
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,347
And since when
did you start drinking anyway?

1223
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,482
Don't worry about me and what
I'm doing with my monkey.

1224
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:54,616
I'm not.

1225
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:55,918
Whatever.

1226
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,052
Hey Dre, you okay?

1227
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:59,621
She's fine, partner.

1228
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:01,990
Don't speak for me.

1229
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,625
Man, let them just
talk it out.

1230
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:04,827
You need a ride home?

1231
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:06,228
No, she don't need
no ride home, bro.

1232
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,229
Just keep it pushing.

1233
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,497
( woman )
Dre, come on, baby.

1234
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,366
I said don't speak for
me, I don't need you.

1235
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:12,601
Dre, come on.
Stop grabbing me.

1236
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,770
No, 'cause you want to try
to play all protective now.

1237
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:16,071
What, you jealous?

1238
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:17,339
Hmm?

1239
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,308
Well, we're
just friends, remember?

1240
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:20,776
Oh, you jealous now
'cause somebody's

1241
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:22,344
paying me
some attention, huh?

1242
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:23,946
Now you want to notice
I exist?

1243
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:24,980
Hey Dre, don't
do this here.

1244
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:25,981
Why not?

1245
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:27,249
I'm already saying what
everybody else

1246
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:29,118
thinks anyway, right?

1247
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,186
I mean, come on.

1248
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:33,655
We've been
friends forever, Gavin.

1249
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:36,291
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

1250
00:56:36,293 --> 00:56:38,327
Taking up for you
while these fools talked about

1251
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:41,163
your stupid ass jokes
and your whack ass gear.

1252
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:43,232
I'm the one who let you
in in the middle of the night

1253
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:45,100
knowing my mama would
kill me.

1254
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:47,202
When your mama
and stupid ass step daddy

1255
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:49,538
was fighting all
the goddamn time.

1256
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,974
Everybody here
thinks you're a scrub.

1257
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:54,343
Everybody.

1258
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:57,246
I saw past that and I
loved you anyway.

1259
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,753
Nah, she'll be fine.

1260
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,422
Let her go.

1261
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,066
( gunshots )

1262
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:21,503
( screaming )

1263
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,921
Call 9-1-1,
call 9-1-1!

1264
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:41,890
Rasheed!

1265
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:44,092
( Thor )
Is he okay?

1266
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,327
( woman )
Dre.

1267
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:46,462
Oh my--

1268
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:51,900
Hey, go get help!

1269
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:58,106
Call 9-1-1!

1270
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:00,843
( crying )

1271
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,113
Oh, my God!

1272
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,418
Damn, Maurice.

1273
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,653
Come on, man!

1274
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,422
Come on, man, stay
with me!

1275
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,460
( man )
They on their way.

1276
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:20,195
( Dre )
Oh, my God...

1277
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:16,451
( crying )

1278
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,231
( Georgia )
And that's when he came
running home screaming about

1279
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:05,067
"anus beef, anus beef."

1280
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:08,170
And I told him, no,
baby, it's "angus beef."

1281
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:11,306
Ain't no such thing
as ass beef.

1282
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:13,775
But if a man
could have an ass beef,

1283
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:17,179
I'd marry him in a heartbeat,
yes, I would.

1284
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:18,981
That's why
I'm not married now.

1285
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:20,182
Let me tell you something.

1286
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:21,249
I'm done
with the marriage thing.

1287
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:22,384
Are you married?

1288
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:23,719
( knocking )
We never even talked about--

1289
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,253
I told you, I don't want
any of that nasty-ass Jell-O

1290
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:26,421
and I don't have to pee.

1291
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:27,990
( Gavin )
It's me, mother.

1292
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:29,257
Please don't throw
anything, okay?

1293
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:30,626
Oh...
How are you?

1294
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,728
Hi, baby, oh....

1295
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,129
Come to say hi.

1296
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,397
And thank you for the
flowers, but you know what--

1297
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,032
Hey Glenn, how you
doing over there?

1298
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:39,201
Your dyke assistant
already sent me--

1299
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:41,236
What?
Flowers.

1300
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:42,938
You don't need to, 'cause
the lady already brought 'em.

1301
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,339
Why you calling her
a dyke, ma, why--

1302
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:45,607
You don't say that.

1303
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:47,109
'Cause she is
a dyke.

1304
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:48,744
Everybody's so politically
correct these days.

1305
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:49,945
Everyone's so sensitive.

1306
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:51,413
You gotta call
orientals Asians,

1307
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:53,915
you gotta call
the Mexicans Latinos.

1308
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,884
Mother, do you want
somebody calling you colored?

1309
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:56,885
Or negro?

1310
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:59,621
I am a colored negro.

1311
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:01,189
Look at this,
look at this color.

1312
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:03,992
I'm a mocha-chocha-latta
ya-ya.

1313
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,094
Creole Lady Marmalade.

1314
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:07,362
I can't come
to visit my mama

1315
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:09,831
without you talking
crazy, huh?

1316
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,601
Oh, oh, please tell me you
checked on Uncle.

1317
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:13,635
Oh yeah,
I did, I did.

1318
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:14,803
He's doing quite well.

1319
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:16,405
They're taking him to
a convalescent home.

1320
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:18,540
Amazingly enough, he just
broke his wrist,

1321
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:19,841
so he's okay.

1322
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,176
So why they taking
him to a convalescent home

1323
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:22,611
if he just broke
his wrist?

1324
01:01:22,613 --> 01:01:24,079
Why they want
to put him in there for that?

1325
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:25,647
You know what, they're trying
to kill him, that's all.

1326
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:26,848
They're trying to get
rid of him

1327
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,283
so they don't
have to be responsible,

1328
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:29,551
that's all it is.

1329
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:30,952
He's 93 and he doesn't
want to be

1330
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:33,121
so they're just gonna let him
go there to die.

1331
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:35,390
You're just so positive,
Ma, woo!

1332
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:36,892
Could you
get more positive?

1333
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:38,727
He's gonna be fine.

1334
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:42,864
Look at you, looking all
cute with your little suit on.

1335
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,800
Looking all snazzy, where
you going?

1336
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:46,868
Just got off of work, went
and had lunch with Dre.

1337
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,170
She said "hi," by the way.

1338
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:50,005
Oh, really, what'd you
tell her?

1339
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:51,039
I told her you were good.

1340
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,374
I told her you
were doing fine.

1341
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,408
And you didn't tell her I
was in the hospital

1342
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,676
with a blood clot
in my leg

1343
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,144
and about ready to die?

1344
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:57,646
Well, Mama, I didn't tell
her you were sick.

1345
01:01:57,648 --> 01:02:00,215
You said you were fine,
why would I tell her that?

1346
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,451
Anyway... how is she?

1347
01:02:02,453 --> 01:02:04,119
She's doing good, she's...

1348
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:05,520
you know, she's hanging
in there, she's fine.

1349
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:07,422
Mm-hmm.

1350
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,725
You should marry
that girl.

1351
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:11,460
Mom, we're just
friends, I keep telling you--

1352
01:02:11,462 --> 01:02:13,095
Gavin Enzell Miller,

1353
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:15,664
for someone I raised to
be so smart, you are so stupid.

1354
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:16,965
Okay, Ma.

1355
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,667
You're supposed to marry
your best friend.

1356
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:19,868
And let me tell
you something.

1357
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,203
Yes.

1358
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:22,771
You have never had
a friend as good as Andrea.

1359
01:02:22,773 --> 01:02:24,573
Name one,
huh, who's been with you

1360
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:26,675
from back then
to now?

1361
01:02:26,677 --> 01:02:28,110
Hmm?

1362
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:29,711
Yeah, someone's quiet now.
Okay, look.

1363
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:33,181
Mom, Dre isn't
interested in me, okay?

1364
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:35,317
Actually, I'm gonna go meet
a friend from high school, so...

1365
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:36,785
Who?

1366
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,887
Ma, you wouldn't know
if I told you, so...

1367
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:40,956
Honey, I don't
mean to be rude,

1368
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,724
but you weren't that
popular in high school,

1369
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,459
so I
know all your friends.

1370
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:45,961
Who?

1371
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:48,130
Rochelle Davis.

1372
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:49,431
Hmm.

1373
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,233
See, that's exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

1374
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:53,135
I'll call you later.
Okay.

1375
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:54,836
I'll visit you,
all right?
Okay.

1376
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:56,738
All right, take care
of yourself.
Okay, bye, stupid.

1377
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:00,742
I love you.
I love you too, stupid.

1378
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:02,811
That's my son...

1379
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:04,479
Stupid.

1380
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,827
What's up, Mr. Michaels,
how's everything?

1381
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:53,128
How you doing,
Mr. Miller?

1382
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,596
Great, great, great,
excellent.

1383
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:55,797
What are you having, sir?

1384
01:03:55,799 --> 01:04:00,902
I am going to take a Jack
and Coke to start.

1385
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,938
How's everything been?
Good, yourself?

1386
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,139
Good, I'm excellent,
excellent.

1387
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:05,240
Excellent.

1388
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:07,542
Thank you,
sir, appreciate it.

1389
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:09,411
Cheers to everyone.

1390
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:10,812
Cheers.
Indeed.

1391
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:15,217
( phone ringing )

1392
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:36,331
Oh, man.

1393
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,647
Thank you.

1394
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,052
Mr. Miller?

1395
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:58,186
Yeah, sir?

1396
01:05:58,188 --> 01:05:59,688
Your guest,
Ms. Davis, called.

1397
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:03,925
She won't be able to
meet you this evening.

1398
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:05,493
She called the restaurant?

1399
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:09,230
Yes, a little while ago.

1400
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:12,867
She-- she called here.

1401
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:14,636
Yes.

1402
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,104
Why would she do that?

1403
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,772
She has my number.

1404
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:22,711
I'm sorry, I don't know.

1405
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:25,146
Okay, come on, man,
me and you, man to man.

1406
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,448
Sir?

1407
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,384
If you're a chick, right,

1408
01:06:29,386 --> 01:06:31,820
and you got this
dude that you have been

1409
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:34,723
seeking out for years,

1410
01:06:34,725 --> 01:06:37,959
you sought
after him and you have--

1411
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:39,127
you have his number.

1412
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:40,695
Why would you--

1413
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:43,431
You know, just call, say
you can't make it.

1414
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:47,836
Why would,
why would you not call?

1415
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,005
( Dre )
Guilt.

1416
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:52,807
That's what I was
looking for.

1417
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:54,709
Guilt.

1418
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:57,145
Guilt.

1419
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:59,180
He's guilty.

1420
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,322
What do you want, Dre?

1421
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:09,290
Why'd you come here?

1422
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:11,126
You want to rub
it in my face?

1423
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:12,460
What, are you
stalking me now?

1424
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,896
Maybe a little
bit of both...

1425
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:17,699
and surely you cannot
be surprised.

1426
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,534
Dre, come on.

1427
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:22,237
Ask me a whole
bunch of questions.

1428
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,172
I had five drinks.

1429
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:25,740
Oh.

1430
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:28,643
Okay.

1431
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:31,746
I don't know, I guess I'm
just like Mike Jones.

1432
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:35,417
Back then,
they didn't want me.

1433
01:07:35,419 --> 01:07:37,085
They still don't
want me, Dre.

1434
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:43,224
All the fame and success.

1435
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,293
It's like I'm still
the same me,

1436
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:50,231
same scrub I was
in high school.

1437
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,368
Same package.

1438
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:56,805
I guess just shined
up a little bit,

1439
01:07:56,807 --> 01:08:00,075
made it a little better,
you know.

1440
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:02,110
I don't know what
I was thinking, though.

1441
01:08:02,112 --> 01:08:04,712
I kept-- I don't
even like her.

1442
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:07,315
I was just wondering, like,
if I could show her.

1443
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,483
You know what?

1444
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:11,186
You don't owe
her any explanation.

1445
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:12,487
And you definitely don't
have to apologize

1446
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:15,523
for being who you are.

1447
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:21,963
That's right.
That's right.

1448
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:24,132
That's right, girl.
Whoa!

1449
01:08:24,134 --> 01:08:25,900
Wow, okay.

1450
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:27,435
All right, can we--

1451
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,503
Check, please.

1452
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,071
Thank you.

1453
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,610
No, wait.

1454
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,178
Just lean, lean.

1455
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,513
No, no, not that way,
the other way.

1456
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,014
Lean the other way.

1457
01:08:40,016 --> 01:08:41,850
There you go, there
you go.

1458
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:48,189
Oh, that's me, Dre.

1459
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:51,226
Come on, Dre.

1460
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:55,830
Me and you, Dre,
me and you, Dre.

1461
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:57,565
It's me and you, Dre.

1462
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:58,733
Yeah, me and you.

1463
01:08:58,735 --> 01:08:59,901
Wow, okay.

1464
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:02,704
Hold on, hold
on, hold on.

1465
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:05,473
I love you, Dre.
I know, I know.

1466
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:08,409
I always loved you.
I know, I know.

1467
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:09,978
Wow, you know
how long I've waited

1468
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,615
to hear you say that,
but not with that breath?

1469
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:15,216
Mm-hmm.

1470
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:16,284
Walk me over here, Dre.

1471
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,775
Oh.

1472
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:52,987
Ow.

1473
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,898
Well, it's about time
somebody got up.

1474
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

1475
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:07,335
Yeah, no, okay.

1476
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:08,703
Listen, don't worry, I've
seen it all before

1477
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,105
and then some.

1478
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:13,308
What-- did we...

1479
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:15,210
'Cause that's my shirt.

1480
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:16,878
Did we?

1481
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,713
Please don't tell
me you forgot.

1482
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,182
Am I that-- was--

1483
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:23,117
You don't remember?

1484
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:24,652
What?
It was us, we--

1485
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,754
you don't remember
under the sheets.

1486
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:30,558
You don't remember having
your tongue in places--

1487
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,428
Wow.

1488
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,496
Ew... no!

1489
01:10:35,498 --> 01:10:36,931
No, we did not.

1490
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:38,266
Girl, dang.

1491
01:10:38,268 --> 01:10:40,501
I had to bring your drunk
behind home last night...

1492
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:43,605
I see.
...after you embarrassed me.

1493
01:10:43,607 --> 01:10:45,506
So where are your clothes?

1494
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:48,509
Oh, they're in the
washing machine.

1495
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:50,511
Yeah, you spilled all
your drinks on me.

1496
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:51,879
Thank you very much.

1497
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:53,481
It's starting to come
back to me now.

1498
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:55,149
Yeah, I see, I see.

1499
01:10:55,151 --> 01:10:56,784
Oh wow,
it smells good.

1500
01:10:56,786 --> 01:10:59,020
It does, yeah,
I can cook.

1501
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:00,455
You saved me again
last night.

1502
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:01,623
Why did you do that?

1503
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,728
That is what friends
do, isn't it?

1504
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,363
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1505
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:16,938
What I said to you
last night on the couch...

1506
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,306
when I told you
I love you.

1507
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:19,774
Uh-huh.

1508
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:23,177
I meant that.
Okay.

1509
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:27,215
When I kissed you in
your room, I knew.

1510
01:11:27,217 --> 01:11:28,516
I just didn't have--

1511
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,653
Whoo-hoo!

1512
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:47,762
I heard she stood
him up the other night

1513
01:12:47,764 --> 01:12:50,131
and he got pissy drunk
in Uzone

1514
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:52,500
and had
to get escorted out.

1515
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:54,035
Of the restaurant?
Yes!

1516
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,570
Girl, stop it.

1517
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:57,105
But that's not how
the story ends.

1518
01:12:57,107 --> 01:12:58,740
Okay, tell it.

1519
01:12:58,742 --> 01:13:00,174
I saw them together
last night.

1520
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:01,676
Are you kidding?
Mm-hmm.

1521
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:04,078
And miss thing in
there, she mad.

1522
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,881
Ladies, top
of the morning, Nadine.

1523
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,349
Markita.

1524
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,584
Hello, ladies,
how are you?

1525
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,853
Good, good.

1526
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:16,958
Rochelle is in
your office.

1527
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,060
Give me a second,
then come get me.

1528
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,862
Oh.

1529
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,263
Okay.

1530
01:13:22,265 --> 01:13:24,265
I got permission, this
gonna be fun.

1531
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:26,768
( Gavin humming )

1532
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:32,540
Gavin.

1533
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:36,310
I'm really sorry
about last night.

1534
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:38,679
I, um...

1535
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,282
I didn't know
what to do,

1536
01:13:41,284 --> 01:13:43,317
but I just couldn't leave
you like that, so--

1537
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:45,486
Thank you.

1538
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:46,654
Thank you.

1539
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:49,390
Pardon me.
For what?

1540
01:13:49,392 --> 01:13:50,691
You know, if I explained
it to you,

1541
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:54,095
you probably wouldn't
understand.

1542
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:56,998
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1543
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,633
a lot of work
to attend to today.

1544
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:00,601
Hey.

1545
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:01,903
Sorry to interrupt.

1546
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:04,572
You're not interrupting,
my guest was just leaving.

1547
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:05,573
Good.

1548
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:06,774
Andrea's on line one.

1549
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,777
Thank you, I'll take it.

1550
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:14,549
Yes, baby, how are you?

1551
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:17,919
Hold on for one
sec, please.

1552
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:19,287
You're excused.

1553
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:22,490
Don't you even want to
know why I'm here?

1554
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:23,825
No.

1555
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:26,327
<i>( Dre )</i>
<i>Was that Rochelle?</i>

1556
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:29,330
<i>He was fair game,</i>
<i>but you lose.</i>

1557
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:31,065
<i>Call me later, baby.</i>

1558
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:32,400
What can I say?

1559
01:14:32,402 --> 01:14:33,801
Yes I will, darling.

1560
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:34,936
I love you.

1561
01:14:34,938 --> 01:14:36,504
Have a good one.

1562
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:37,505
Wait for it,
wait for it.

1563
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:39,507
Oh.

1564
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:40,675
Have a good day.

1565
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:42,009
Bye.

1566
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:45,546
We know it's
real, honey.

1567
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:47,148
Too much.

1568
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,349
Too much.

1569
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:50,751
Miss thing!

1570
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:52,353
She's overdressed for
the meal of the day.

1571
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:53,588
That's all I'm
gonna say.

1572
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:54,856
I'm just gonna put
it out there.

1573
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:56,090
All right, ladies, let's
get back to work, okay?

1574
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:57,325
We're dressed
appropriately.

1575
01:14:57,327 --> 01:14:58,493
That's how we get down.

1576
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:02,797
I sing
doo-doo-doo

1577
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:13,107
Yes, can you please cancel
all of my appointments?

1578
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,476
I am leaving
for the day.

1579
01:15:15,478 --> 01:15:16,944
<i>( Bobby Jo )</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1580
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,187
( man )
Yo, G!

1581
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,095
What's up, big boy?
I'm good, baby.

1582
01:15:34,097 --> 01:15:35,796
What's going on, man,
good to see you, man.

1583
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:36,998
All right.

1584
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,967
So, wow, where you
been, bro?

1585
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:42,103
You know,
still around the way.

1586
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:43,738
Yeah, I see.

1587
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:44,906
You're looking good, man.

1588
01:15:44,908 --> 01:15:46,140
You're holding
it together.

1589
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:47,875
No, man, that's
you, man.

1590
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,110
Everything good?

1591
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:52,280
Yeah, I can't complain, man,
I can't complain.

1592
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:54,048
How's that beautiful little
friend of yours, Dre, man?

1593
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,216
You know, I'll take her
off your hands

1594
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,617
while you're bullshitting.

1595
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:57,885
I see nothing's changed.

1596
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,020
Well, you still
remember Dre, yeah?

1597
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:02,056
She's-- she's totally
off-limits.

1598
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,324
Okay.

1599
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:04,792
What about that pretty
little assistant

1600
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:06,193
you got back
there at the office?

1601
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:08,362
Bobby Jo?

1602
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:11,899
That's how
you found me, huh?

1603
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,035
You know, I'm gonna wish
you luck on Bobby Jo.

1604
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:17,305
You're on
your own on that one.

1605
01:16:17,307 --> 01:16:19,340
Really.

1606
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:20,508
Well.

1607
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:21,876
I don't know how they pick
"Man Of The Year," man,

1608
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,911
but I really
must say, man,

1609
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,047
that's a good look on you,
my dude.

1610
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:28,816
Thanks man,
I appreciate it, I really do.

1611
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:30,585
What do they give you,
like a gold watch

1612
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:32,453
and two tickets to the
Poconos or something?

1613
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:33,521
It doesn't work
that way.

1614
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:41,262
( Gavin )
The things you never bother to
pay attention to in high school

1615
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:44,966
mean the most when you
finally grow up.

1616
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:46,287
Congratulations, Gavin,
on "Man Of The Year."

1617
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:48,255
You are probably one of
the smartest people

1618
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:49,924
I have ever met.

1619
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:51,726
No lie, before I meet
with you

1620
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:52,960
I catch up
on news headlines

1621
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:56,130
just to see what you're
up to.

1622
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:58,632
Is that right?

1623
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:00,034
"Man Of The Year."

1624
01:19:00,036 --> 01:19:01,302
Wow.

1625
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:03,270
Well, I have
to tell you, Gavin,

1626
01:19:03,272 --> 01:19:05,339
I mean, if it wasn't for you,
I'd be broke

1627
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:08,943
and not only that, I really
appreciate your soft side.

1628
01:19:08,945 --> 01:19:11,779
Really, really touched
my heart,

1629
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:15,516
you supporting the nonprofit
for you, know, GSU,

1630
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:18,018
protecting the kids in Haiti

1631
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:21,188
and giving them moral
support and uplifting them.

1632
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,757
I really appreciate it.

1633
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,558
You're really, really
an amazing guy.

1634
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,483
