1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:02,801
Bittersweet melody playing

2
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,080
# Music #

3
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,317
# Music #

4
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,690
# Music #

5
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:41,600
# Music #

6
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,875
ANNOUNCER:
High and inside for ball one.

7
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,911
Doesn't look like Leonard
was trying to get...

8
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,812
( snoring softly )

9
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,882
...but it just didn't want
to break for him.

10
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,284
Toes the rubber,
starts his wind-up

11
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,187
and delivers a fastball
low and outside.

12
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,790
Just missed the corner
for ball two.

13
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,826
Looks like he's
a little bit uncomfortable

14
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,094
with his rotator.

15
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,064
Still having trouble
with that shoulder.

16
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,398
( snoring continues )

17
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,401
Certainly seems to have trouble
finding the plate

18
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,502
that's for sure.

19
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,837
( whispers ):
Come on.

20
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,372
He's already walked
four batters.

21
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,941
It appears
that's going to be all

22
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,944
as Leonard is going to be pulled
by manager Frank...

23
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,447
ELLEN:
Sometimes I think
the day he made my daddy

24
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,716
God wasn't thinking straight.

25
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,487
( door rattles )

26
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:12,957
She's coming
home today.

27
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,526
She's coming home?
Uh-huh.

28
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,727
How come?

29
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,362
They've done all they can
for her for now.

30
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,465
What's romantic fever,
Aunt Nadine?

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,666
What?

32
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,468
What Mama has--
romantic fever.

33
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,637
( laughs ):
It's not "romantic fever."

34
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,038
It's rheumatic fever.

35
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,139
What is it?

36
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,441
It's a heart thing.

37
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,443
She's had it
since she was your age.

38
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,844
I thought you knew that.

39
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,646
I thought it
was "romantic."

40
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,682
( indistinct background
conversation )

41
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,124
( phone ringing,
background announcements )

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
What are you doing?

43
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,462
Waiting.

44
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,596
Mama's with her.

45
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,730
We can't go in yet.

46
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,365
Hi, Ellen.

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,767
Well, can I go in?
No.

48
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,402
Well, move over.

49
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,906
If I was my mother, I'd stay
right here in the hospital--

50
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:05,944
folks patting your head
and bringing you fruit baskets.

51
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,146
I would stay right here.

52
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,998
( drawers opening and closing )

53
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,004
( panting softly )

54
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,205
You don't look to me

55
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,940
like you should
be leaving here.

56
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,309
You look like
the dickens.

57
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,677
I'm okay.

58
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:24,545
The doctor told me
you need

59
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,715
plenty of bed rest
and no exertions.

60
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,183
Now, I want...

61
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:32,353
I want you to come
home with me.

62
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,954
What for?

63
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,391
The same reason
as always--

64
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:38,059
to live.

65
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:40,478
What about Ellen?

66
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,681
My offer is the same
as always, too.

67
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,584
You expect me to go
and live with you

68
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,819
and leave her with him?

69
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:51,155
Well, she's his daughter.

70
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,724
She's my daughter, too.

71
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,176
Trash begets trash.

72
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,361
It don't matter
who he sires it on.

73
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,931
I'm too tired
for this, Mama.

74
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,436
It's the last time
I make the offer.

75
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,937
( laughs )

76
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,556
Well, that'll
be a relief.

77
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:22,270
( door opens and closes )

78
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,412
Thanks, honey.

79
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,443
Oh!

80
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,147
Looks like Charlotte
turned her down again.

81
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,381
( sighs )

82
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,864
You don't have
to come in.

83
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,965
Are you sure?

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,700
I'm fine.

85
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,274
We'll call you later.

86
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,876
Okay. Bye.

87
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,077
Bye-bye.

88
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:37,344
Bye.

89
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:44,552
( distant train whistle
blowing )

90
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:47,789
( television playing )

91
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:59,667
It's off the wall,
inside corner...

92
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:00,935
Hey.

93
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:02,971
Hey. How you doing?

94
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,640
Not too bad.

95
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,142
Well, you're just in time
for lunch.

96
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,811
What we having?

97
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:14,415
I had to cook for my own self
the whole time you was gone.

98
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,854
Maybe you can lie down
a bit first.

99
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,589
I'm fine, honey.

100
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,258
Let's go see
what we got, huh?

101
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,561
( clatters )

102
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:34,502
( sighs )

103
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:48,650
This place is a mess
since you been gone.

104
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,551
It needs a good cleaning-up.

105
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,939
I can't stand
being in a mess.

106
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,540
It reminds me

107
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,875
of when I was a kid.

108
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,911
I tried to keep it
cleaned up.

109
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,145
I know.

110
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,347
I could see that
when I first came in.

111
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,650
Well, you ought to teach her

112
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,318
how to do it right.

113
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,806
What are you looking at?

114
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:15,760
Why don't you eat?

115
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,881
I don't have
an appetite.

116
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,210
What was it you turned
your mama down about?

117
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,478
What, honey?

118
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,246
At the hospital.

119
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,582
Aunt Betsy said

120
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,884
you turned your mama
down about something.

121
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,386
You can tell she was
real ticked off.

122
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,688
Well, she wanted me

123
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,123
to come and live
with her.

124
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,992
Well, why don't we--

125
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,760
you and me?

126
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,029
We'd be much better
off over there.

127
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,064
Can't.

128
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,431
But why not?

129
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,067
She's got that
humongous house

130
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,336
and you wouldn't
have to be cooking
or cleaning or whatnot.

131
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,138
( panting )

132
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,272
Are you okay?

133
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,308
I'm just catching
my breath.

134
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,377
I don't think you should've
turned her down, Mama.

135
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,080
Had to, hon.
Always had to.

136
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,314
How come?

137
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,917
Oh, 'cause...

138
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,452
she won't take you in, too.

139
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,172
I don't like you
knowing that.

140
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,724
Why won't she
take me in, too?

141
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,779
She thinks you're more
your daddy's daughter than mine

142
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,816
and she has an intense dislike
of your daddy.

143
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,518
I think you know that.

144
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:33,621
She's sure got it wrong
about me and him.

145
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,808
If you wasn't here,
I'd run away.

146
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,427
You know

147
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:41,762
you're my favorite person
in the whole world.

148
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,314
You know that?

149
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,817
You're my favorite
person, too.

150
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,752
You're smart
and you're strong

151
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,555
and you can get along
no matter what happens.

152
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,325
I absolutely know that.

153
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:59,196
You remember I told you
that, won't you?

154
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,048
Mm-hmm.

155
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,978
Hey.

156
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,352
Mmm.

157
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,487
Here. You want
anything else?

158
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:27,959
No, thank you, hon.

159
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,561
I'll read you
something, okay?

160
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,813
From the Bible?

161
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,681
Mm-hmm.
My favorite part.

162
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,616
You want to hear
my favorite part?

163
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:36,984
Sure do.

164
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,356
"To everything
there is a season

165
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:46,177
"and a time to every purpose
under the heaven.

166
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:50,248
"A time to be born
and a time to die

167
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,199
"a time to plant

168
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,102
"and a time to pluck up
that which is planted

169
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:58,656
"a time to kill
and a time to heal

170
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:02,176
"a time to break down
and a time to build up

171
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:05,279
"a time to weep
and a time to laugh

172
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:09,466
a time to mourn
and a time to dance."

173
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:17,041
I think I'll just have myself
a little nap.

174
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,277
You sure you don't
want nothing else?

175
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,778
No, thank you, hon.

176
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,812
I'm fine.

177
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,557
I'll stay here with you.

178
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,761
Just for a little while,
I'll stay here with you.

179
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,966
I hate it so
when people say they're fine.

180
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,986
You know they're not
and they know it, too.

181
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,556
( tires screeching )

182
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:06,273
( thunder crashing )

183
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,690
Why's all the lights out?

184
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,695
( bumps into furniture )

185
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,316
How's a man supposed to see
in the pitch dark?

186
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,920
( stumbling )

187
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,904
( knocking )

188
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:30,408
Come on, get up.

189
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,075
Other people got to get in here,
too.

190
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,578
I'll sleep where I want to.

191
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,380
Get up.
You can go sleep in your truck.

192
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,585
I sleep where I want to!

193
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,439
( whimpering softly )

194
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,463
I sleep where I want to!

195
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,421
Mama, get back in the bed.

196
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,755
Mama.

197
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,923
Shh.

198
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,261
( Charlotte sobbing )

199
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,595
It's okay. Shh.

200
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:31,251
( grunting )

201
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,236
Shh, Mama.

202
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,539
( sobbing )

203
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,607
Shh.

204
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:03,267
The first day

205
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,719
of every month
my daddy's brother Rudolph

206
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:09,122
would bring some cash money
in an envelope

207
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,793
and I would make sure I would
get it before my daddy did.

208
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:20,434
I figured out
what I needed and I took it.

209
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:25,305
You got the lights and the gas
to be paid up, food and extras.

210
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,341
And I'd let him have the rest.

211
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,505
( exhales loudly )

212
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,459
Mama?

213
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,596
Mama?

214
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,386
Mama?

215
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,043
( sobbing )

216
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,858
I should have taken
better care of her.

217
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:54,561
I should have just
put my foot down and said

218
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,680
"Look here, Mama,
you can't be doing

219
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,333
"all this cooking
and cleaning up and what-not.

220
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:03,087
You have to be in bed getting
rested like Aunt Betsy said."

221
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,324
I should have put my foot down.

222
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,877
I think that'll be on my mind
for quite a long time.

223
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,163
Mama, I have to go.

224
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,332
Not now, sweetie.

225
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,333
Can't we stop?

226
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,535
Hold it, pumpkin,
all right?

227
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,471
"...Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

228
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:40,473
all the days of my life..."

229
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,977
( sobbing ):
My baby.

230
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:46,230
"Earth to earth

231
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,884
"ashes to ashes, dust to dust

232
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,620
"in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection

233
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,273
"to eternal life
through our lord Jesus Christ

234
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,692
"who shall change
our mortal body

235
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:01,511
"that it may be like

236
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,980
"unto his glorious body

237
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,548
"according
to the mighty work

238
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:09,386
whereby he is able to subdue
all things to himself."

239
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,723
Oh, you rotten piece of trash!

240
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,409
You're the one who
should be in that box

241
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,743
you scum!

242
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,080
Why is it that

243
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:23,400
somebody like my daughter dies
and you don't?!

244
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,253
You took off
and ruined her!

245
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,589
Ruined her life!

246
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:29,923
Broke her heart!

247
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,925
Scarred her soul!

248
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:36,529
May God in his wisdom
strike you dead

249
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:39,016
If somebody else
don't do it for us first!

250
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:46,456
Seemed to me
she might have got hold

251
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,091
on her natural meanness

252
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,261
for her own daughter's funeral
at least.

253
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:55,649
I guess she hated my daddy
more than she loved my mama.

254
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:57,651
It didn't seem proper to me.

255
00:18:57,686 --> 00:19:01,855
I think at a funeral everybody
should love everybody else.

256
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,634
( bell ringing )

257
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,657
Starletta, wait up.

258
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:21,692
Bye.
Bye.

259
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,662
My mama says
your mama passed on.

260
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,997
Uh-huh.

261
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,999
That's why
you wasn't at school?

262
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,333
Uh-huh.

263
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:33,169
My mama said to say
she's real sorry

264
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,338
and she hopes
she'll come by soon

265
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,173
to say it her own self.

266
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,508
Okay.

267
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:41,344
You're going to have to catch up
on your homework.

268
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:42,613
How you doing?

269
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,563
Fine.

270
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,257
What's in the box?

271
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,195
Just some beads

272
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,614
And things.

273
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:02,849
My Mama used to let me
play with that.

274
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:06,570
She won't be letting you
play with it anymore.

275
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,391
You tell your daddy

276
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:14,428
the message is
plain and simple.

277
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:17,697
Now get it right.

278
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:19,950
You listening?!

279
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,553
You tell him

280
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:28,325
that I'd rather some tramp
had my Charlotte's things

281
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,694
than any of you bunch

282
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,730
that drink and carry on
like trash.

283
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,757
I'm sorry, hon.

284
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,560
( door opens )

285
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,895
( door closes )

286
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,416
Hi, honey!

287
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:16,450
Hi.

288
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:17,551
I just stopped by

289
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,470
to see how you
getting along.

290
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,921
Is your daddy here?

291
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:23,257
He's not home much anymore.

292
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,624
Where is he?

293
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:25,742
I don't know.

294
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,678
Sometimes he comes
home to sleep

295
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,381
but I think
all he's doing now

296
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,716
is drinking and sleeping.

297
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,903
What you doing?

298
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,203
Playing catalog.

299
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,271
What's that?

300
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,723
First I pick out
a little family

301
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,260
and then house stuff
and clothes.

302
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,030
Sleepwear and fancy jackets
for the man and pantsuits

303
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,699
and I outfit everybody--

304
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,017
the mom and the dad
and the kids.

305
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:52,352
The kids are cute.

306
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:57,374
Next, they get some camping
equipment and a waffle iron

307
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,210
and bedroom suits and some toys.

308
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,061
And the daddy
who works in a factory

309
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:03,863
and the mama--
she works at a bank.

310
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:06,382
They like to dress up
after work.

311
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,019
And I also find the best values.

312
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,054
That's real clever.

313
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,406
How you doing
for food?

314
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:14,441
Okay.

315
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:18,161
You eating regular?

316
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,163
Sure.

317
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,464
What are you eating?

318
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,417
Frozen stuff
from the store

319
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:26,052
in tin things.

320
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,204
TV dinners?!

321
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,122
I guess.

322
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,840
How are you fixed
for money?

323
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,742
Uncle Rudolph's
still bringing it.

324
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:33,844
He is?

325
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,045
Not as much as before, though.

326
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,715
Why is he giving us
the money anyway?

327
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,084
It's not Rudolph
giving you the money.

328
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,186
I thought
you knew that.

329
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,322
How am I supposed to know?

330
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,190
Nobody tells me anything.

331
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,191
Who is?

332
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,427
Your grandma.

333
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,679
She's the one

334
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:54,798
that's been giving us
all the money?

335
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,916
For your mother.

336
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,169
Mama's dead.

337
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,606
Well, I guess
she just...

338
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,074
doesn't have it
in her heart

339
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,409
to starve a child,
despite her feelings.

340
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,144
Don't tell her
I told you that.

341
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,746
It's supposed
to be a secret.

342
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,247
Well, how could
I tell her?

343
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,617
She hasn't hardly said
two words in a row

344
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:14,984
to me in my whole life.

345
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,521
Well, she never been
too good about children

346
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,555
even her own.

347
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,757
Except for your mother,
Charlotte.

348
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,292
She was her favorite.

349
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,377
The sun never set

350
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:24,378
on Charlotte.

351
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:25,679
Which one
of these hats

352
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,681
do you think looks
better on her?

353
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:31,151
This one or...

354
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:32,619
or this one?

355
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,074
BETSY:
We got to do something.

356
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,058
NADINE:
Like what?

357
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:39,042
I don't know. Something.

358
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,477
She can't be on
her own over there

359
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,945
with that drunk,
eating TV dinners.

360
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,879
It's Charlotte's fault

361
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,414
for marrying him
in the first place.

362
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,782
That's water and
bridges, Nadine.

363
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,850
We're talking about now.

364
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,352
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it.

365
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,353
Why not?

366
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:50,387
He's her father.

367
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,404
He needs a stepstool

368
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,706
to look a worm
in the eye.

369
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,874
He's still her father.

370
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,475
She should be
with real family.

371
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,660
Why don't you take her?

372
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,411
Me?

373
00:24:58,446 --> 00:25:00,680
Might do you good
to have a kid around.

374
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:01,931
Why would you say that

375
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,684
knowing how I feel
about children?

376
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:06,253
If I wanted a kid,
I would have gotten married.

377
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:07,470
Besides, if I took her

378
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,572
I'd have to deal
with Mama all the time.

379
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,407
The less I do
with Mama, the better.

380
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,676
Why can't you take her?

381
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,710
No. Dora hates her.

382
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,178
My nerves couldn't stand it.

383
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,613
Also, she makes me nervous.

384
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:17,781
I guess I know
what you mean.

385
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,882
She can be weird
sometimes.

386
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,416
She reminds me
of Charlotte sometimes

387
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,618
when Charlotte was her age.

388
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,186
You were always
jealous of Charlotte.

389
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,088
Oh, look who's talking.

390
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,706
Let's not get into it.

391
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,191
Water and bridges.

392
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,129
Big smile now.

393
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:34,998
Good!

394
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,584
Do you believe
in Santa Claus?

395
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,720
( chuckles ):
Sure I do. You?

396
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,622
Uh-uh. I'm glad I don't.

397
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:44,024
Like my daddy says

398
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:47,093
"Wish in one hand
and spit in the other.

399
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,796
See which one
gets filled up first."

400
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:52,498
I won't be going
spitting in my hand.

401
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:53,833
That's disgusting.

402
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:56,769
My mama said she believed
in Santa Claus

403
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,438
lots longer than I did.

404
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,908
I think she wanted me
to believe in him longer.

405
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:03,576
But that was
in the old days

406
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:04,777
when she was little.

407
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,778
Things change.

408
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,513
I think you're
missing something

409
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:09,249
not believing
in Santa Claus.

410
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:11,501
I'm going to
believe in him

411
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,036
as long as I can.

412
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,971
Then you got
a good wishing hand.

413
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,473
You want to see
what I got

414
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,907
for your Mama and daddy?

415
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,578
See?

416
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,679
Ooh!

417
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,497
It's pretty.

418
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:26,666
What's it for?

419
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,268
Putting spoons in.

420
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:32,305
I believe
my mom's got one of them.

421
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,307
Well, now she's got two.

422
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,934
Hey, boy, hey!

423
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:02,318
A merry Christmas!

424
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:04,454
It is Christmas Day,
isn't it?

425
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:05,588
Why, of course.

426
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,457
I knew I hadn't
missed it!

427
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,693
All the spirits
have done it all

428
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:10,927
in one night!

429
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,815
It couldn't be like
it used to be with Mama

430
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,701
but it's a long time
till next Christmas.

431
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,470
Maybe things will turn around
by then.

432
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,373
( laughing )

433
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,759
Well, would you look
here at this?

434
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,578
( chuckling )

435
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:29,879
Always use
one of these.

436
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,449
Keeps your spoons
from dripping on the stove.

437
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,551
I figured maybe
you can use one.

438
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:38,388
Never can have enough
of these.

439
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,589
Well, it looks to me

440
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,875
like we got
one more present here.

441
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,960
Says... "To Ellen, from Santa."

442
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,261
I think this child here

443
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,464
is the only one
we know called "Ellen."

444
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,799
Ain't that right?

445
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,000
DAVINA:
Right as rain.

446
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:50,917
For me?

447
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,053
You have been a good girl,
right?

448
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,271
What is it?

449
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,273
DAVINA:
Well, open it up, child.

450
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,341
BOTH:
Open it up!

451
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,376
STARLETTA:
Open it up!

452
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,085
Oh, it's a sweater!

453
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,654
It sure is.

454
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,671
Can I put it on?

455
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:13,773
I'd like to put it on right now

456
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:14,858
if that's okay.

457
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:15,959
Put it right on.

458
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,662
STARLETTA:
Color's pretty, Mama,
ain't it?

459
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,164
Oh, it just suits
her perfect.

460
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,650
Couldn't be prettier.

461
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:27,820
I was sort of in need
of a sweater.

462
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:30,623
I have to go
pretty soon.

463
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:32,492
Got to get home.

464
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:33,826
Your daddy
home tonight?

465
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:35,761
Haven't seen hide
nor hair of Daddy

466
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,929
in two or three days.

467
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,598
Well, why don't you
stay here?

468
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,667
What are you gonna
when you get back?

469
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,718
I'll stay busy.

470
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,871
You come on back here
whenever you want to.

471
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:46,172
If your daddy
ain't home

472
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,307
when you get there

473
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,492
you come right on back
over here, you hear?

474
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,394
You come right on back.

475
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,395
To stay?

476
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,330
How do you mean, honey?

477
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,532
To stay, all the time,
here.

478
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:57,901
Yeah.

479
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,536
Why would you want
to stay here

480
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,871
all the time,
sweetheart?

481
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,339
I like it
much better here

482
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,407
now that my mom's
not home anymore.

483
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,276
You got to be missing
your mama real bad.

484
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,577
We know that.

485
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:12,382
Honey, we would take you in
in a minute if we could.

486
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,449
Why can't you?

487
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,318
Don't you like me enough?

488
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,087
'Course we like you.

489
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,021
We're very fond, Ellen.

490
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,106
You know that.

491
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,793
It's okay
if you don't.

492
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:24,895
No hard feelings.

493
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,963
Truth of it is,
we wouldn't be allowed

494
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,431
to take you in
permanent.

495
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,800
Allowed by who?

496
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,702
Other folks.

497
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,870
What other folks?

498
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,104
Who'd care?

499
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,773
There's folks that just
wouldn't tolerate it.

500
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,142
Well, why the heck not?

501
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,712
'Cause we're different colors,
you and us.

502
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,547
But that don't matter anymore.

503
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:45,699
We got integration.

504
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:48,884
Not altogether,
honey.

505
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,737
Not altogether.

506
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,808
But it wouldn't be
anybody's business but us.

507
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:57,894
There's those would make it
their business

508
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,495
and that's just the way of it.

509
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,464
Now you're welcome
to come here

510
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,432
and visit us
anytime you please

511
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,967
but that other part...

512
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:07,470
Well, it ain't in the cards
just yet.

513
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,409
Now y'all finish
your food

514
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:14,377
so we can get

515
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,845
some of that
sweet potato pie.

516
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,233
"To everything
there is a season

517
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:23,853
"and a time to every purpose
under the heaven.

518
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,922
"A time to be born
and a time to die;

519
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,291
"a time to plant

520
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,995
"and a time to pluck up
that which is planted;

521
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,665
"a time to kill
and a time to heal;

522
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,719
"a time to break down
and a time to build up;

523
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,872
"a time to weep
and a time to laugh;

524
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:45,975
"a time to mourn...

525
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,144
and a time to dance."

526
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:37,994
This one's for you.

527
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,663
This one's for
your lowlife brother.

528
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,898
May he choke on it.

529
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,733
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.

530
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,481
Now, who told you
you could do that?

531
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:34,016
Who told you you could do it?

532
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,484
Nobody told me.

533
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,552
I had to.

534
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,238
Oh, you had to.

535
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:39,805
You had to steal my money.

536
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:41,541
I wasn't stealing.

537
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,192
Stuff had to be paid.

538
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,277
They shut down the
electric last month.

539
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:46,379
Don't you remember?

540
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:48,715
Get in the closet.

541
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,765
Get in there!

542
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,699
Get in there!

543
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,703
I pay the bills
around here!

544
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,005
Any bills to be paid,
I pay them!

545
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,407
You understand that?!

546
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,059
I'm the man
of this house!

547
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,347
I didn't hit you.

548
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,299
You hear me?

549
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:09,719
I didn't hit you.
Remember that.

550
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,670
In the dark I gathered my head

551
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,373
and all that spinning
and flying out from me

552
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,259
and wondered.

553
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:19,829
Oh, you have to wonder
what this world's come to.

554
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,024
Hello.

555
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,860
This is Ellen.

556
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,562
I-I'm fine.

557
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:54,931
How are you?

558
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,704
I was wondering
if I-I could come stay with you.

559
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,775
Okay.

560
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,944
What do you want to do
this weekend?

561
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,279
Well, do you still have
that fancy bathtub

562
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,614
with the thing in it?

563
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,781
The Jacuzzi?

564
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,116
I guess.

565
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:16,285
Must be neat to have
a bath in that.

566
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,455
You want to take a bath
in my Jacuzzi?

567
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,206
You got it.

568
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:22,875
Just make yourself
right at home.

569
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,944
Then we'll go shopping.

570
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,046
What happened to your face?

571
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,414
I fell.

572
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,087
( humming )

573
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:39,225
Having fun?

574
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,393
Uh-huh.

575
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:41,860
( humming )

576
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,230
We're going to have
a lovely day tomorrow

577
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,632
and then I'll take
you back after supper.

578
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,735
Take me back where?

579
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:51,337
Home.

580
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:52,272
Home?

581
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:55,191
After supper tomorrow.

582
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:57,694
I asked if I could come
and stay with you

583
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,028
and you said fine.

584
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,197
And I got all the stuff
I brought back

585
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,798
in your bedroom closet.

586
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,568
Oh, hon, I meant you could
stay for the weekend

587
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,054
and then go back home.

588
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:09,388
Really?

589
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:12,341
What did you
think I meant?

590
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,144
That I could come
and stay with you.

591
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:19,281
Well, sorry about
that misunderstanding.

592
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,585
Me, too.

593
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,528
JULIA:
Little more clay slip,
Jocelyn.

594
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,281
These are looking great,
you guys.

595
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,820
Try a little more color
right in there

596
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:43,089
why don't you?

597
00:35:43,124 --> 00:35:44,740
Which color?

598
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,142
Surprise me.

599
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,283
Wow.

600
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,253
What happened
to your face, Ellen?

601
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,454
I fell.

602
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,757
Let me see.

603
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,126
It's okay.

604
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,313
We only want to help you, Ellen.

605
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,031
You understand that, don't you?

606
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,634
We know things have been
a bit difficult for you

607
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,202
since your mother passed on.

608
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,037
We just want to do
whatever we can

609
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,223
to help you
through this difficult time.

610
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,657
You can tell us the truth,
Ellen.

611
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:20,393
You don't have to be frightened.

612
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,378
You remember last winter

613
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,348
when the lady
from Social Services came by

614
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,283
to talk to your dad?

615
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,184
No.

616
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,618
Well, she did.

617
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,337
We understand
you've been having

618
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:32,789
some difficulties at home.

619
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,291
Now, did you really
fall down the stairs?

620
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,068
My daddy did it.

621
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,236
But I'm used to it.

622
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,138
Don't everyone get in an uproar

623
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,406
about it.

624
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,975
Do you have somewhere
you could spend the night, hon?

625
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,095
Well, I live in a house
just like everyone else.

626
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,930
No, Ellen,
not your house.

627
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,182
Let's get someone to come
pick you up after school

628
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,568
and I'll take care of getting
your things from your house.

629
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:04,654
Who do you know to call?

630
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,656
Do you have
any aunts or uncles, say?

631
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,742
I already wore out my welcome.

632
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:12,494
Can I have a word, gentlemen?

633
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,751
Okay, hon, it's settled.

634
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,805
We've decided
what to do with you.

635
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:56,555
Home sweet home, kiddo.

636
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,808
What about my daddy?

637
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,477
We'll take care of that.

638
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,146
Don't you worry, okay?

639
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,349
He probably won't miss me
for about a month, anyways.

640
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,718
Miss Hammond, I presume.

641
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,720
This is my husband, Ellen.

642
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,057
Roy, say hello
to Ellen Hammond.

643
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,358
Hello, Ellen Hammond.

644
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,692
Hi.

645
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,695
Two's company,
three's a joy.

646
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,763
Come in.

647
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,066
Come in, come in,
come in, come in.

648
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,908
This is the guest room.

649
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,713
So here's what's happening.

650
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:41,217
Social Services is going
to talk to your dad tomorrow.

651
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,219
You know what
Social Services is?

652
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,388
They take care of folks
who need taking care of.

653
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:49,058
Right. Then I'm going
to go over to your house

654
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,192
with one of them

655
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,128
and we're going
to get your stuff

656
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,528
and bring it over here.

657
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,531
You can make a list
of anything you especially want

658
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,368
any of your stuff,
and we'll get it.

659
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,036
Well, I could go with you.

660
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,537
It'd be lots quicker.

661
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,039
No, uh-uh.

662
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,375
It'll take some time
to work things out

663
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,710
but everything's going
to be fine, okay?

664
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,380
Just... go with the flow.

665
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,382
Bathroom's downstairs.

666
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,716
So when you're ready

667
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,452
why don't you come down
and help me fix dinner?

668
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,409
ELLEN:
What's he doing
out there?

669
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,277
Drying lettuce.

670
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:29,215
You're not from
around here, are you?

671
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,217
We're from Connecticut.

672
00:39:31,252 --> 00:39:32,818
We always liked the South.

673
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:34,386
So when we finished college

674
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,388
we decided to
settle down here

675
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:38,056
and have a family.

676
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:40,392
I used to be
a flower child.

677
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:42,561
You know what
a flower child is?

678
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:43,895
A kid with flowers.

679
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:46,064
Not exactly.

680
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,399
Close, though.

681
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:49,401
But now I have
to be low-key

682
00:39:49,437 --> 00:39:51,903
so I can hold
a steady job.

683
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:54,906
Oh, boy,
when I was young, kiddo

684
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:57,576
I wanted to save the world.

685
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,077
What from?

686
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:00,112
Well...

687
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:03,215
From people like your father.

688
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,384
You mean there's
more like him?

689
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:07,637
Lots more. Too many.

690
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,038
My Aunt Nadine says

691
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,040
my daddy was a mistake
for a person.

692
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,875
Right on, Aunt Nadine.

693
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,711
So, you have a
birthday coming up.

694
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,213
Boy, I forgot.

695
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,548
How'd you know?

696
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,716
Your school records.
I looked it up.

697
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,553
What do you have in mind
by way of a celebration?

698
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,488
What would you do
if you was me?

699
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,589
Were me.

700
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,257
Were me.

701
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,293
How about a party?

702
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:33,028
The only girl good enough
to invite is Starletta.

703
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,264
Starletta wouldn't be a party
by herself.

704
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,999
We'll find out.

705
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,417
Hey, do you like gardening?

706
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:39,868
We have a vegetable garden.

707
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,071
I used to help my mama.

708
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,990
She liked to work
in the garden

709
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,992
in the morning
when it was cool.

710
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,727
( laughing ):
She...

711
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,729
She would pull up the weeds

712
00:40:49,764 --> 00:40:52,531
and put them in little piles
along the rows

713
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:57,520
and my job was to pick up
the piles and dispose of them.

714
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,389
When the beans were grown,
ready to pick

715
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:02,407
she'd let me help pick them.

716
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:05,410
She'd give me an example
of a good bean

717
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:09,081
to hold up in one hand
while I picked with the other.

718
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:11,617
If I wasn't sure
about a particular bean

719
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:14,052
if it was at the right stage
for picking

720
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:18,056
I could just hold up my example
of a good bean and know.

721
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:21,727
It took a long time
to pick that way.

722
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:25,230
My Mama always hummed
in the garden.

723
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:27,099
That was when I was little.

724
00:41:30,638 --> 00:41:33,021
What's a flower child?

725
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,312
I didn't have a birthday
last year.

726
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:41,897
How come?

727
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,232
My mama was too sick.

728
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,335
Okay, have a look-see.

729
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,836
What am I looking at?

730
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,705
You're looking
at euglena.

731
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,340
It's my favorite.

732
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,577
I think it might make
a nice name for a girl.

733
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:55,894
Euglena.

734
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,897
I might keep it in mind
if I ever get a baby girl.

735
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:02,401
I also have diatoms on a slide
and one of a paramecium

736
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,436
but euglena's my favorite.

737
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,639
Come and get it, birthday girl.

738
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,844
( no audio )

739
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:43,041
( honking )

740
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,529
STARLETTA:
Thank you, guys.

741
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,864
Starletta, hold on.

742
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,499
Cake, balloons.

743
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:51,483
Thank you.

744
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,785
( honking )

745
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,952
Bye.

746
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,771
Bye, darling.

747
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,077
I'm real pleased
you looked up
my birthday.

748
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,244
Me, too.

749
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,446
( both laughing )

750
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,689
( "Tennessee Waltz" playing )

751
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:17,760
( singing incoherently )

752
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,829
( tires screeching )

753
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,498
( bottle shattering )

754
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,067
( toots horn )

755
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,002
Watch out, you dummy!

756
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:29,304
( tires screeching )

757
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:36,428
# The Tennessee Waltz. #

758
00:43:36,464 --> 00:43:38,763
( dog barking )

759
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:40,783
( glass breaking )

760
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:43,001
( tires screeching )

761
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,572
( shouting ):
Ellen!

762
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:48,190
What in the world?

763
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,425
( kids murmuring )

764
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,559
Ellen!

765
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:53,795
Ellen!

766
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,098
Ellen Hammond!

767
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:59,035
You better get out here
right now!

768
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,004
You better
get on out here!

769
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,372
Ellen, you better get out here
right now!

770
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:04,473
You don't want me

771
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,075
coming in there.

772
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,976
Call the police.

773
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,878
You all get back
to your desks.

774
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:11,980
Back to your desks
right now.

775
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,215
( kids murmuring )

776
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,350
Ellen?

777
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,053
Do you know
this person?

778
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,820
He's my daddy.

779
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,540
You get your little britches
out here right now

780
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,643
before I count to three
or you're going to rue the day!

781
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:27,696
One...

782
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:30,365
two...

783
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,968
Daddy, go home! You're getting
everyone in an uproar.

784
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,369
Go home.

785
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,504
Three!

786
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,640
Hey! Hey, I'm counting here!

787
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,675
I said three.
Get out here!

788
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,877
Oh, you're asking for it now.

789
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:43,813
You're asking for it!

790
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:50,869
Hey, I just want
my kid out of there.

791
00:44:50,904 --> 00:44:52,671
Ain't nobody going
to stop me, all right?

792
00:44:52,707 --> 00:44:53,672
Mr. Hammond, please.

793
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:55,774
I will get my little
baby girl out, all right?

794
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,242
Mr. Hammond, please.

795
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,377
Please, nothing.

796
00:44:58,412 --> 00:44:59,911
That's my baby girl
in there.

797
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,913
You understand?
I'm going to get her out.

798
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,382
I can take care of her.

799
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,301
( sirens wailing )
Hey! I got money.

800
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:06,268
I got money.

801
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:07,435
I understand, sir...

802
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:11,206
( yelling continues )

803
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:12,741
That's a public school.

804
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,877
My girl is
in a public school.

805
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,247
( crowd gasping )

806
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,348
You want some of me?!

807
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,850
Want a piece of me?!

808
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,252
Oh, my.

809
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,553
( sputtering )

810
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:27,389
Get your damned hands
off of me!

811
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,890
They stole
my little girl!

812
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:30,392
She's in for it now.

813
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:31,877
You ain't got the right!

814
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:35,064
They stole my little girl!

815
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,766
I'm her father!

816
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,902
Hey! They stole
my little girl!

817
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,537
That's my little girl!

818
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:50,879
Here.

819
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,018
You're sure there isn't
going to be any problem?

820
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,953
That would be
very unlikely.

821
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,622
I don't want there
to be any problems.

822
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:04,593
It would be
very unlikely.

823
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:08,463
ELLEN:
Who believes it?

824
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:09,998
ROY:
The authorities--

825
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,282
the legal authorities.

826
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:12,684
They generally believe

827
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,737
that children should be
with their families

828
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,304
when it's
at all feasible.

829
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,440
Well, if we were walking
down the street

830
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,409
everybody would think
we was a family.

831
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,711
We think so, too.

832
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:25,313
This is such a bummer.

833
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,716
They going to send me
back to my daddy?

834
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:29,919
No. Not your daddy.

835
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,486
Well, who, then?

836
00:46:38,812 --> 00:46:40,512
Your Honor,
I just want you to know...

837
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,963
I'm not really interested...

838
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,032
He has no right
to say anything...

839
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:45,317
Would you...?

840
00:46:45,352 --> 00:46:47,769
( arguing continues )

841
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,540
( pounding gavel )

842
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,575
( arguing continues )

843
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:55,110
Would you please sit down?

844
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,212
They just want to take her...

845
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,214
OFFICER:
Sir, sit down!

846
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,068
( arguing continues )

847
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:05,387
They talked
mainly above my head

848
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:06,972
and usually, I can jump in

849
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,207
and hang on
to what people are saying

850
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:13,028
but I felt so dazey in my head
that not a word made sense.

851
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:16,799
Then the judge
who was up in the box

852
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,969
he talked right to me
for the first time.

853
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,905
Ellen, honey

854
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,941
I have grandchildren of my own--

855
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:28,360
six of them,
to be exact--

856
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:30,663
and if any
solitary one of them

857
00:47:30,698 --> 00:47:32,898
was ever in a,
in a difficult situation

858
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,049
and needed caring
in a special way

859
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:36,418
because of that situation

860
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,454
I wouldn't hesitate
for one minute

861
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,241
to clasp him or her to my bosom

862
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,509
and cherish and protect
him or her.

863
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:46,695
The family is

864
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:49,164
the cornerstone of society

865
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,916
and when it begins to crumble

866
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,851
we are bound to rush in
with mortar

867
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:55,854
and bricks and whatever
else there is to hand

868
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:57,472
to shore it up.

869
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,607
I know that
you're old enough

870
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,743
and clever enough
to understand

871
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,178
and I'll say it again:

872
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:08,450
The family is
the cornerstone of society.

873
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:11,186
Do I get a chance
to say something?

874
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,154
No, you don't.
Now, hold it
right there, please.

875
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,957
But, Judge...
Just hold, please.

876
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,059
What could she possibly
have to say, Judge?

877
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,593
This matter
has been concluded

878
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:19,694
as far as I can see.

879
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,664
Can't we please find out
what's on her mind?

880
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,715
After all she is the bone
of contention here!

881
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:26,535
And I think it's only fair
that she gets to put

882
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,238
her two cents in.

883
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,273
Now you speak right up, honey.

884
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:44,252
All that stuff you've
been saying about the family

885
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,221
and the cornerstone
of society?

886
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,656
I heard about that in school

887
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,824
but if you don't mind me
saying as families

888
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,628
you've got us mixed up
with a different bunch of folks.

889
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:53,862
Judge...

890
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,130
Shh!

891
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,180
Ever since my mama died

892
00:48:56,216 --> 00:48:58,466
things have been
like she used to say sometimes:

893
00:48:58,502 --> 00:48:59,868
"Up in the air."

894
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,103
When I asked her
what was going to happen

895
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,472
about one thing or another,
she'd often say

896
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,059
"Well, that's up in the air
just at this moment."

897
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:10,479
Well, then, along came
Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs

898
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,614
and they just pulled me
right down

899
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,849
from all that floating.

900
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,017
Judge, I protest!

901
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,284
JUDGE:
Mrs. Nelson.

902
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,353
Please!

903
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,023
I can't figure out why
my mama's mama wants me.

904
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,491
She don't even like me.

905
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,426
I don't even remember her
looking at me nice

906
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,261
in my whole life
though I don't know why.

907
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,130
Have we had enough of this?

908
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,297
Have we?

909
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,533
Mrs. Nelson,
justice for all in my court.

910
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,035
Please. Justice for all!

911
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,603
Plus, it beats me

912
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,706
why a person can't live
with whoever they like best

913
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,641
and who likes them best

914
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:42,844
so I'm just hoping
you'll let me.

915
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,915
I guess that's all my two cents.

916
00:49:58,846 --> 00:50:01,262
Kid's got a mouth on her,
ain't she?

917
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:08,053
( sighs )

918
00:50:09,323 --> 00:50:11,490
Honey... Ellen.

919
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:13,775
I surely do appreciate
your giving us

920
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:16,878
your side of the story,
and you may be even right

921
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:19,214
about a couple of things
here and there

922
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:24,102
but the fact of the matter is
that when it comes to family

923
00:50:24,138 --> 00:50:26,455
blood is blood

924
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,940
and the law

925
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:30,725
is the law.

926
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:35,397
When you grow up,
you'll understand

927
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:39,251
and I surely hope
you'll thank me for it.

928
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,154
My ruling stands.

929
00:50:42,189 --> 00:50:43,872
This hearing
is concluded.

930
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,074
( pounds gavel )

931
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,242
That's okay.

932
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,550
I'd rather go
to reform school

933
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,120
or get on a chain gang
than go stay with her.

934
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,470
So would we.

935
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:00,838
She makes a knot in me

936
00:51:00,874 --> 00:51:02,540
just thinking
about her face.

937
00:51:02,575 --> 00:51:03,608
We'll have visits.

938
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,177
I wouldn't count on letting
her visit if I was you.

939
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:07,195
Were you.

940
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,431
Were you.

941
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:26,708
When does school
start again?

942
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,109
Well, it just ended

943
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:31,813
and I sure am looking forward
to the summer at your house.

944
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,449
I asked you
when school starts.

945
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,285
I do not need
the commentary.

946
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,524
If I'd have known then
all I know about her now

947
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,027
I would have jumped out
of that big car moving

948
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:48,030
and hightailed it.

949
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:07,632
It's big.

950
00:53:07,668 --> 00:53:09,067
Good thing, too.

951
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:13,037
You won't be under my feet
every minute of the day.

952
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:15,407
Show her where
she's staying.

953
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,009
Maybe some of her mama
will rub off on her

954
00:53:18,044 --> 00:53:20,044
staying in that room.

955
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,047
Yes, ma'am.

956
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:24,782
How you doing,
Miss Ellen?

957
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:25,967
Remember me?

958
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,270
We done met before.
I'm Mavis.

959
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,687
Taking
my mama's clothes.

960
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:31,356
That's me.

961
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:33,225
Come on along, then.

962
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,978
This place is heaps fancier
than the one you was living in.

963
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,513
Does anyone else
live here?

964
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,849
Just your grandma...
till you, now.

965
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,450
I ain't much
to fill it up.

966
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,687
( laughs ):
Need a lot more like you
to fill up this place.

967
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,788
Don't you live here?

968
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,222
Lord, no, child.

969
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,925
Me and Alvin
got our place out back.

970
00:53:52,879 --> 00:53:54,046
Who's Alvin?

971
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:55,514
Alvin's my husband.

972
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:57,115
Drives your grandma's car.

973
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,785
Here you go.

974
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,935
Oh!

975
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,438
Used to be
your mama's room.

976
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,872
You knew my mama?

977
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,975
Since she was about
like you are now.

978
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,711
And this was
her bedroom?

979
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,945
Sure was.

980
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,681
Not a lot of changes, neither.

981
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,416
Not since the night
she run off.

982
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,568
Run off where?

983
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:18,419
To be with your daddy...

984
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,122
'fore he was your daddy

985
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:22,024
of course.

986
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:31,800
Yeah, I know Miss Charlotte
good as I know myself.

987
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:35,203
I never knowed nobody
sweet like your mama.

988
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,172
Smart as a whip, too.

989
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,339
She was?

990
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,440
Lord, yes.

991
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,176
Maybe you're
smart like her

992
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,045
since you were
her little girl.

993
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,546
I don't know.

994
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,414
Yep, your mama

995
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,217
was her mama's favorite
of the bunch

996
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,987
and you know, the others
didn't care for that--

997
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,922
not Miss Nadine,
Miss Betsy

998
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,290
Not even Mr. Robert.

999
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:57,492
Who's he?

1000
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:58,860
Mr. Robert?

1001
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:01,329
That was your grandma's boy.

1002
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,464
He passed a long time ago.

1003
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,401
Throwed off a horse
at the age of 16.

1004
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:11,473
Between me and you
and the fence post

1005
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:14,442
I'd say your grandma
went peculiar

1006
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,578
the night Miss Charlotte run off

1007
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:20,081
and since she passed--
rest her soul--

1008
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,950
well, I'd call her
downright touched

1009
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,652
your grandma.

1010
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:26,988
Don't you go telling her
I said that.

1011
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,891
Lord, child.

1012
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:33,494
You look just like your mama.

1013
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:37,215
Got them beautiful eyes.

1014
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,986
Why don't you
go wash up a bit

1015
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:42,954
then come on down
to the kitchen

1016
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:47,409
and I'll introduce you
to Rosaleen.

1017
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:50,111
Rosaleen does the cooking

1018
00:55:50,147 --> 00:55:52,680
I do the taking care.

1019
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,492
Reverend,
how is your missus?

1020
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:39,261
Much better.
Thanks for asking.

1021
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:40,328
I'm so glad.

1022
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:41,663
Good morning,
Miss Ellen.

1023
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:42,730
Good morning.

1024
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,500
( background conversation )

1025
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:48,403
( baby crying )

1026
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,707
You go sit down and
give this baby to me.

1027
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,075
Aw...

1028
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,545
( baby wailing )

1029
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,879
Here we go.

1030
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,447
We're going to sit down.

1031
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:01,032
Yes. We're going to sit down.

1032
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:04,435
Things are going
to be okay.

1033
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:07,906
( chatting quietly to baby )

1034
00:57:11,912 --> 00:57:13,311
Stop that.

1035
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,714
( baby continues crying )

1036
00:57:15,749 --> 00:57:20,318
Aw, yeah, girl.
You'll be fine.

1037
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,419
Yes, you are.

1038
00:57:21,454 --> 00:57:23,187
You're going to be fine.

1039
00:57:23,223 --> 00:57:26,074
Absolutely,
my little honey bun.

1040
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:30,278
You'll be having your dinner
in here on Sundays.

1041
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:34,415
The other days, you'll eat
in the kitchen with the help.

1042
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,950
You hear me?

1043
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,118
Uh-huh.

1044
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,887
"Uh-huh"?

1045
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,223
That's trash talk.

1046
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:42,624
Say, "yes, ma'am."

1047
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,659
Yes, ma'am.

1048
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,561
And in case
you have it in your mind

1049
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,996
that you'll be lazing
around here

1050
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,933
like the Queen of Sheba,
get it right out.

1051
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:56,420
Idle hands do
the devil's mischief.

1052
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:58,456
Don't you break that.

1053
00:58:00,444 --> 00:58:02,844
Why aren't you eating?

1054
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,846
I'm not awful hungry
just at present.

1055
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,282
Oh.

1056
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:10,935
I hate picky eaters.

1057
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:13,822
We'll need
to work you up an appetite.

1058
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:16,056
Am I going to be working?

1059
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:17,425
Oh, you bet.

1060
00:58:18,979 --> 00:58:20,345
Am I going to get paid?

1061
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,780
"Paid"?!

1062
00:58:21,815 --> 00:58:24,799
You're getting
your room and board.

1063
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,935
Huh!

1064
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,920
You're a greedy one, aren't you?

1065
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,108
What will I be working at?

1066
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:36,211
( whirring )

1067
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,313
She didn't pay me a cent

1068
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,648
but I kept figuring up

1069
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,917
how much I was worth
by the hour.

1070
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:01,903
( tinkling )

1071
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,522
( giggles softly )

1072
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:06,741
You being
real careful, child.

1073
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:09,744
She hasn't broken a thing yet
in these couple of weeks.

1074
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,946
Don't bear thinking
about it if she did.

1075
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,548
Can I make
a telephone call?

1076
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,349
You're not to be
calling far.

1077
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:16,784
I don't know
anybody far.

1078
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,185
Who you calling,
sweetheart?

1079
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,854
Just a friend
of mine.

1080
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,489
I'd say you better
be doing it

1081
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,291
while your grandmama's
not home.

1082
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,592
I'd say
that's the way.

1083
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:25,826
( murmuring agreement )

1084
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:32,901
( phone ringing )

1085
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,269
JULIA:
Hello?

1086
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,204
It's me-- Ellen.

1087
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,573
Oh, it's so good
to hear your voice.

1088
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:40,007
How you doing, sweetie?

1089
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:43,344
I was wondering
if you want to visit my mama.

1090
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,129
What do you mean, hon?

1091
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,449
Well, it would have
to be Thursday

1092
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:48,682
this one coming.

1093
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,385
It'll be the first year
since she's passed.

1094
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,838
Thursday is when her mama
gets her hair fixed

1095
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:54,939
so she won't know.

1096
00:59:54,975 --> 00:59:57,191
I don't think
your grandmother would mind

1097
00:59:57,227 --> 00:59:59,110
you going to visit
your mother, hon.

1098
00:59:59,145 --> 01:00:00,962
Don't count on it.

1099
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,964
There ain't much
she doesn't mind.

1100
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,499
Isn't much.

1101
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:05,967
( sighs )

1102
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,236
Isn't much.

1103
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,405
Can we get some flowers
to put down?

1104
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:15,943
There it is, over there.

1105
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,427
I would have loved
to have known your mom.

1106
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:37,365
She would have been
real fond of you.

1107
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,267
I'm going to take
a little walk.

1108
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:41,502
Why don't you hang out here
for a while?

1109
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:49,276
I think the two of you

1110
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,613
would have gotten along
real good.

1111
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,247
Maybe you're looking down on me

1112
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:56,918
and feeling fairly okay
about me being her friend

1113
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:00,304
but she ain't anything like you.

1114
01:01:00,339 --> 01:01:03,457
She could never be
my mama like you.

1115
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:07,295
But Julia, she'd be my...
first second choice

1116
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,580
if you know what I mean.

1117
01:01:09,615 --> 01:01:12,967
But don't you worry
about me being with your mama.

1118
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,536
I'm going to manage it
one way or another.

1119
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:18,172
And like you used to say,
"Nothing's forever"

1120
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,710
Though it does seem like it
sometimes.

1121
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,181
I'm doing okay in school.

1122
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:30,117
Don't worry, okay?

1123
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:42,429
LEONORA:
He's been put away
for a long time

1124
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,031
your trash of a father.

1125
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,001
Beat a man to death

1126
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,669
fighting in a tavern.

1127
01:01:48,704 --> 01:01:50,772
They threw the book at him.

1128
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:58,045
ELLEN:
As long as they
threw away the key

1129
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,081
after they threw the book.

1130
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,718
Pass.

1131
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,887
One, no trump.

1132
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:06,921
Pass.

1133
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,775
That's 700 points
for our side.

1134
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,844
You want to
play another?

1135
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,278
Excuse me, ma'am.

1136
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,514
There's somebody
here to see you.

1137
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:34,448
Who?

1138
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,184
Mr. Rudolph, ma'am.

1139
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,252
( sighs )

1140
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:39,670
Excuse me, ladies.

1141
01:02:39,705 --> 01:02:40,954
Hannah?

1142
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,123
Oh...

1143
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,542
Oh, thank you.

1144
01:02:44,577 --> 01:02:46,294
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:49,364
What the devil
do you want?

1146
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:50,848
Our business
is concluded.

1147
01:02:50,884 --> 01:02:52,450
Yes, ma'am.
I understand.

1148
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:54,385
I just come by
to drop something off.

1149
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,386
What?

1150
01:02:55,421 --> 01:02:56,754
Uh, something
for Ellen.

1151
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:57,755
What?!

1152
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,824
Her... Bill's medal.

1153
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,543
What are you
talking about?

1154
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,177
The medal he
got in 'Nam--

1155
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,612
Vietnam.

1156
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,347
Bill was a veteran, you know.

1157
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,516
And should have
come back in a box.

1158
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:11,319
Not walking to torment
my daughter some more

1159
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,820
till the day she died.

1160
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,405
Well, with the house
up for sale

1161
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:16,373
I've been over there
cleaning up some

1162
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:18,676
and that's how I come
across it-- the medal.

1163
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,077
I thought
it'd be nice

1164
01:03:20,112 --> 01:03:21,362
for Ellen
to have it--

1165
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:22,363
Her daddy's Purple Heart.

1166
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:23,831
Get out of my house.

1167
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:24,832
Get out!

1168
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,066
Y-Yes, ma'am.

1169
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,901
I'll just leave that
right there.

1170
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,204
That's for you, Ellen.

1171
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,725
( card players chatting )

1172
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,727
HANNAH:
Well, we need
to make up.

1173
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:27,328
WOMAN:
Have another one here.

1174
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,563
Thank you, honey.

1175
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,065
I hope nobody's peeked
a look at my cards.

1176
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,433
( laughing )

1177
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:38,673
What in the dickens
is that woman doing?

1178
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,875
She didn't have
to do that.

1179
01:04:48,702 --> 01:04:51,285
( playing hymn )

1180
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:04,098
# O perfect love #

1181
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:08,569
# All human thought
transcending #

1182
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:13,374
# Lowly, we kneel #

1183
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:18,479
# In prayer before thy throne #

1184
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:23,500
# That theirs may be #

1185
01:05:23,535 --> 01:05:29,106
# The love
which knows no ending #

1186
01:05:29,142 --> 01:05:35,713
# Whom thou
for-er-more doth join #

1187
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:42,103
# In one. #

1188
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:43,705
PASTOR:
Please be seated.

1189
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,207
Please listen
as I read

1190
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,542
Chapter four,
Verse five...

1191
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,011
Who's that lady?

1192
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,779
What lady?

1193
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:54,015
That one there
with all the kids.

1194
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,817
LEONORA:
What do you care?

1195
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,969
I was just wondering.

1196
01:05:59,005 --> 01:06:02,973
She looked
like a real special mama.

1197
01:06:03,009 --> 01:06:06,911
I bet she was the perfect one
for all those kids.

1198
01:06:06,946 --> 01:06:10,714
She was like someone
having a nice dream

1199
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:13,800
and they turn out to be real.

1200
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,661
( groaning )

1201
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:45,333
( gasping and sighing )

1202
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:49,570
( groaning )

1203
01:06:53,076 --> 01:06:54,692
Ma'am?

1204
01:06:57,163 --> 01:07:00,097
( moaning )

1205
01:07:00,132 --> 01:07:03,884
Ma'am?

1206
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,119
Mavis!

1207
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:06,186
Mavis!

1208
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:11,409
Don't know what happened, ma'am,
but we got her into bed though.

1209
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,227
Mavis is seeing
to her right now.

1210
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,195
Well, did you call a doctor?

1211
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:16,530
Sure did-- same doctor was here

1212
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:17,915
when she had the flu
last winter.

1213
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,066
Says he's on his way over.

1214
01:07:36,336 --> 01:07:38,001
She still alive?

1215
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,824
What's happened?

1216
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:44,925
Your mama
has suffered a stroke.

1217
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:46,577
Shouldn't she be
in the hospital?

1218
01:07:46,612 --> 01:07:47,578
Certainly.

1219
01:07:47,613 --> 01:07:48,679
Have you made arrangements?

1220
01:07:48,715 --> 01:07:49,863
She wouldn't let me.

1221
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:51,465
Wouldn't let you
put her in a hospital?

1222
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,551
Adamant refusal
was her response

1223
01:07:53,586 --> 01:07:55,485
to my repeated suggestion.

1224
01:07:55,521 --> 01:07:57,671
Says hospitals
are where you die.

1225
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,039
BETSY:
How bad off is she?

1226
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,474
It was a relatively

1227
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,408
mild incident.

1228
01:08:01,443 --> 01:08:02,543
Can we see her?

1229
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,161
I've given her
a sedative.

1230
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:06,547
I'll leave a couple
of prescriptions.

1231
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,366
Fill them
as soon as possible.

1232
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:09,500
Give them to me.

1233
01:08:09,535 --> 01:08:11,769
I'll go get them
at the drugstore.

1234
01:08:11,804 --> 01:08:13,304
I'll be back
in the morning.

1235
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,222
Prevail on her
to be hospitalized

1236
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,591
if you can.

1237
01:08:27,153 --> 01:08:29,520
What a bummer.

1238
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,941
( sighing )

1239
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:36,977
Well, isn't this a mess?

1240
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:39,046
It could have been
worse, I guess.

1241
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,314
I-It didn't kill her.

1242
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,149
I've heard of people
with strokes--

1243
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:43,350
they'd rather be dead.

1244
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:44,601
Not to mention the people

1245
01:08:44,637 --> 01:08:46,137
who have to take
care of them.

1246
01:08:46,172 --> 01:08:47,305
The timing's rotten.

1247
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:48,973
My trip-- New Orleans--
I'm leaving Monday.

1248
01:08:49,008 --> 01:08:50,408
Do you think you
might want to think

1249
01:08:50,443 --> 01:08:51,508
about canceling
that, Betsy?

1250
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,826
Let's see how it goes.

1251
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:54,161
He said it was mild.

1252
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:56,697
Probably one of us should
move in here for a while.

1253
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:57,998
Who did you
have in mind?

1254
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:58,999
What about you?

1255
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,000
Uh-uh.

1256
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:01,168
Well, I'm
not doing it.

1257
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,936
A nurse, then--
around the clock.

1258
01:09:02,971 --> 01:09:05,005
Fine. There's no refund
on the airfare.

1259
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,473
I wonder if she
made a will.

1260
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:07,508
She'd better have.

1261
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,210
Maybe you should call
the lawyer.

1262
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,044
You helped him, didn't you?

1263
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,880
ELLEN:
Helped who? What?

1264
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:17,534
Your daddy, that lowlife.

1265
01:09:17,569 --> 01:09:19,620
Helped him how?

1266
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:23,057
To kill my Charlotte.

1267
01:09:25,061 --> 01:09:27,477
I never did.

1268
01:09:27,513 --> 01:09:30,231
There. You best take
better care of me

1269
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,915
than you did your mama.

1270
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:02,162
Can I ask you
a question?

1271
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:04,031
Like what?

1272
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:08,536
Well, I know you hated my daddy.

1273
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,587
But what about me?

1274
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,640
Can't you see I'm not like him?

1275
01:10:15,994 --> 01:10:21,582
All I know is, when I look
at your face, I see that trash

1276
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:25,786
and everything
he did to my Charlotte.

1277
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,939
But I didn't do anything.

1278
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:35,929
You set up there in that house
like the world owed you a living

1279
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:40,001
and you left her to die.

1280
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:44,772
Then someone comes
to my house

1281
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,574
and tells me
that they found you

1282
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:50,978
all laid up next to her
like a little idiot.

1283
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:56,466
That lowlife never got
what was coming to him

1284
01:10:56,501 --> 01:10:59,453
but I swear...

1285
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:03,958
you will never stop paying
for your part.

1286
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:07,644
Heigh-ho.

1287
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,365
I've got you now.

1288
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,667
Sometimes I was scared
that she was right

1289
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:16,303
about me not taking
better care of my mama.

1290
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:19,956
So I tried the best I could
to take of her

1291
01:11:19,992 --> 01:11:23,427
figuring maybe Jesus
would give me a break

1292
01:11:23,462 --> 01:11:26,062
when it came my time to pass.

1293
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:52,055
( moaning )

1294
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,543
( moaning )

1295
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:02,015
( stops moaning )

1296
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:35,215
Aunt Nadine?

1297
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,167
This is Ellen.

1298
01:12:37,203 --> 01:12:39,136
She's passed.

1299
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:09,933
Well, at least you didn't die

1300
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:11,935
and lay up in the house
all alone

1301
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,970
no one to hear you
stop breathing.

1302
01:13:14,006 --> 01:13:16,540
I think everyone should have
someone there

1303
01:13:16,575 --> 01:13:18,675
to know
when they stop being alive.

1304
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:22,012
So here I am.

1305
01:13:22,048 --> 01:13:27,084
You'll look nice when they come,
pretty as a picture.

1306
01:13:29,221 --> 01:13:32,423
I don't want a soul to say
that I didn't do my part...

1307
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:34,842
to the fullest.

1308
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:05,472
Later on I reminded Jesus

1309
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:08,091
that I did lots better
for my grandma

1310
01:14:08,127 --> 01:14:09,627
than I did for my mama.

1311
01:14:09,662 --> 01:14:12,596
I hoped
he'd give that some thought

1312
01:14:12,632 --> 01:14:16,232
and help me find somebody good
who could love me.

1313
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,343
If you do

1314
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,611
I'll run away!

1315
01:14:27,646 --> 01:14:29,113
Now calm down,
honeypie.

1316
01:14:29,148 --> 01:14:30,414
Calm yourself down.

1317
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:32,216
How could you
do that to me?

1318
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:34,201
Well, because
somebody has to.

1319
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,385
I hate her!

1320
01:14:35,421 --> 01:14:36,520
Oh, now listen--

1321
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,088
I'm not too crazy
about her myself.

1322
01:14:39,124 --> 01:14:42,008
Oh, but if there was
any other solution

1323
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,345
I'd jump at it,
believe you me.

1324
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,381
But the judge says
we have to take her--

1325
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,583
and we're stuck
with it, baby.

1326
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,071
I think that room's
going to do you fine--

1327
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:12,155
don't you, Ellen?

1328
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,156
Uh-huh.

1329
01:15:13,191 --> 01:15:14,675
Though I'm getting
real weary

1330
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,411
of packing and unpacking
my stuff in so many places.

1331
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:20,213
NADINE:
Is that bag
everything you have?

1332
01:15:20,248 --> 01:15:22,349
ELLEN:
All my worldly
possessions.

1333
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,985
Just stay out
of my room, is all.

1334
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,687
Well, why shouldn't I?

1335
01:15:26,706 --> 01:15:29,539
We have to pick you up a few
more things-- some clothes.

1336
01:15:29,575 --> 01:15:30,757
Would you
like that?

1337
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,175
I'm growing out of stuff.

1338
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,811
Maybe some of Dora's dresses
might fit you

1339
01:15:34,847 --> 01:15:36,563
that she doesn't
wear anymore.

1340
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,215
She's not wearing my clothes.

1341
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,934
Well, there's some things that

1342
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,635
you don't wear
anymore, pumpkin.

1343
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,520
I don't care if
I wear them or not.

1344
01:15:43,556 --> 01:15:45,605
She's not wearing
any of my clothes.

1345
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:48,325
Well, who wants to wear
your old clothes anyways?

1346
01:15:48,361 --> 01:15:49,493
NADINE:
Girls, girls.

1347
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:50,961
We'll go shopping
next week.

1348
01:15:50,996 --> 01:15:53,096
You'll need new things
for school anyway

1349
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,514
which, need I remind you

1350
01:15:54,549 --> 01:15:56,282
starts again
the week after next.

1351
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,384
Who wants to be reminded
of that?

1352
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,854
Well, I kind of favor school.

1353
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,288
You would.

1354
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,041
Smarty-pants.

1355
01:16:04,076 --> 01:16:07,911
Well, you could turn me loose
in the store with some money

1356
01:16:07,946 --> 01:16:10,864
and I could get exactly
what I have to have.

1357
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,065
NADINE:
We'll see.

1358
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,034
Come and get it.

1359
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:22,075
Is that my imagination
or are your hands shaking

1360
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,560
the teensiest
little bit?

1361
01:16:23,595 --> 01:16:26,680
They've been doing that
now and again of late.

1362
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:28,515
Wonder what that could be?

1363
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,183
Are you feeling nervy?

1364
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,559
Could you please
pass me the bread?

1365
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,637
Stay out of my room.

1366
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:53,273
( chanting ):
How many doughnuts did it take?

1367
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:55,175
You got new jeans.

1368
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,577
They're cool.

1369
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,278
Where you at now?

1370
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:00,280
At my Aunt Nadine's.

1371
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,449
She's Sora Banning's mother.

1372
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:03,784
She stay there, too?

1373
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,285
Certainly.
It's her house.

1374
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,620
Poor you.

1375
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:08,789
She told me to stay out
of her room--

1376
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,123
so I went right in

1377
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:12,325
the first chance I got
when they were gone.

1378
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,628
I rambled through that room
top to bottom.

1379
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,430
Romance books in the back
of her underwear drawer.

1380
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,882
You name it.

1381
01:17:18,917 --> 01:17:20,800
She ain't got
a secret from me.

1382
01:17:20,835 --> 01:17:24,271
Her mama would be shocked
at the stuff I came across.

1383
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,005
Hi.

1384
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,340
Hi.

1385
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,042
Isn't the first day
of school

1386
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:30,444
just about
the worst day

1387
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,578
of the year?

1388
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:32,912
You can say
that again.

1389
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:34,397
How you doing,
Starletta?

1390
01:17:34,433 --> 01:17:35,833
How are you,
Miss Hobbs?

1391
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:37,367
I'm very well,
thank you.

1392
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:39,837
Ellen, stay after class
for sec, okay?

1393
01:17:39,872 --> 01:17:40,838
Okay.

1394
01:17:40,873 --> 01:17:42,072
ll right.

1395
01:17:42,107 --> 01:17:43,740
So then what
did he say?

1396
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:45,876
Honey, you don't
want to know.

1397
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,677
We're talking nightmare.

1398
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,765
( bell rings )

1399
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,768
Okay, everybody,
smocks in the basket.

1400
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:59,139
Don't forget to bring in
autumn leaves tomorrow.

1401
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,741
Ellen, I'll see you
after school, okay?

1402
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:02,776
Bye.

1403
01:18:19,678 --> 01:18:21,478
So, Que pasa?

1404
01:18:21,513 --> 01:18:22,479
What?

1405
01:18:22,514 --> 01:18:23,564
It's Spanish.

1406
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:25,231
It means
"What's happening?"

1407
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,067
What's happening...

1408
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:28,201
Que pasa?

1409
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:29,202
Okay.

1410
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:31,337
How's it going?

1411
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:33,774
Well, Dora hates my guts.

1412
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,343
What's your Aunt Nadine like?

1413
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,379
She wouldn't be anyone's
first pick for a mama

1414
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:40,847
if you had your pick.

1415
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:42,716
She got me some new clothes.

1416
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:43,750
This is new.

1417
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:44,918
Cool.

1418
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:45,685
Ugh.

1419
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,120
Um...

1420
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:50,190
I found the most
beautiful dress

1421
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:51,241
I ever saw.

1422
01:18:51,277 --> 01:18:53,610
And it was just with
the ordinary dresses

1423
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:56,079
and I said,
"This is the dress for me."

1424
01:18:56,115 --> 01:18:57,614
And the price was right.

1425
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,016
And it's like...

1426
01:18:59,051 --> 01:19:02,585
it's just the kind of dress
you catch someone's eye with.

1427
01:19:02,621 --> 01:19:03,636
And when
I put it on

1428
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:04,938
and I looked
in the mirror

1429
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:06,206
I just said

1430
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:09,242
"Lord, I could just fall
right in love with myself."

1431
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,315
I have something
to tell you.

1432
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,653
Roy and I
are going away.

1433
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,623
Well, where to?

1434
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:26,359
Atlanta, Georgia.

1435
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:28,562
An old friend of ours
from college

1436
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,329
has a terrific
job for Roy.

1437
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:31,798
So, we're
going to go.

1438
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:35,535
And we're going to have a baby.

1439
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,623
You are?

1440
01:19:39,658 --> 01:19:41,057
Yeah.

1441
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:42,425
Around next spring.

1442
01:19:42,461 --> 01:19:46,547
Well, if it's a girl baby,
Euglena's a good name.

1443
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:48,982
We'll put it on the list.

1444
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,170
I wish you weren't going.

1445
01:19:54,205 --> 01:19:56,556
We'll write to you.

1446
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:58,391
Will you
write back?

1447
01:20:00,345 --> 01:20:02,762
Boy, are we going to miss you.

1448
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,501
Thanks for wanting
to keep me that time.

1449
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,838
You're a keeper.

1450
01:20:19,798 --> 01:20:21,365
Hello, Mrs. Abigail.

1451
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,366
Hello, Reverend.

1452
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,134
ELLEN:
Do you know
that lady?

1453
01:20:24,169 --> 01:20:25,469
What lady?

1454
01:20:25,504 --> 01:20:27,804
Her with
all the girls.

1455
01:20:27,839 --> 01:20:30,007
It's a foster family.

1456
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:31,341
A foster family?

1457
01:20:31,377 --> 01:20:33,910
Mama says she'll
take in anything

1458
01:20:33,945 --> 01:20:36,779
from crippled orphans
to stray cats.

1459
01:20:36,815 --> 01:20:40,133
Oldest girl has a baby
out of wedlock.

1460
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,734
Take them in where?

1461
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,853
DORA:
In her house, stupid.

1462
01:20:43,888 --> 01:20:45,822
You know where
she lives?

1463
01:20:45,857 --> 01:20:47,390
In a big blue house

1464
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:50,043
by the school
the little kids go to.

1465
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:51,678
Why?

1466
01:20:51,714 --> 01:20:53,063
Just wondering.

1467
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:55,032
I'm trying
to figure out

1468
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:56,800
how to get
a new mama.

1469
01:20:56,835 --> 01:20:58,051
Can't get a new mama.

1470
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:00,387
Only got one mama
and your one's dead.

1471
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:02,689
I think maybe
you can get a new one

1472
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:04,591
if you figure it out right.

1473
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,267
I was a bit confused.

1474
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,770
Then I figured out the way
it must be.

1475
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:36,673
It must be that
the foster family lived in it

1476
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,075
but somebody named Montford
owned it.

1477
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:41,277
And then I knew
I'd got it right.

1478
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,106
Hi.

1479
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:57,744
Are you looking
for somebody, darlin'?

1480
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,079
No, ma'am.

1481
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:01,547
Just riding around
hither and yon.

1482
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:17,897
WOMAN:
You see
what I mean?

1483
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,499
MAN:
It's most curious.

1484
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:20,800
When did
this start?

1485
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:22,135
Last week sometime.

1486
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:24,855
She does it on everything
she turns in.

1487
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:26,489
Have you asked her
about it?

1488
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:28,491
No. I try to be
careful about her.

1489
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:30,493
She's had a hard time,
this child.

1490
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,696
Her family dying off
right and left.

1491
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:34,965
You know, I never once
seen her smile.

1492
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,700
How has she progressed
socially

1493
01:22:36,735 --> 01:22:38,468
since last term,
would you say?

1494
01:22:38,503 --> 01:22:40,503
Same as ever,
as far as I can tell.

1495
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,806
The only child she seems
at all close to

1496
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:45,142
is that colored girl,
Starletta Douglas.

1497
01:22:45,177 --> 01:22:47,077
Emotionally isolated--

1498
01:22:47,112 --> 01:22:50,080
insecure as to her
social skills...

1499
01:22:50,115 --> 01:22:52,382
traumatic
home environment.

1500
01:22:52,417 --> 01:22:54,151
You're the doctor.

1501
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:57,003
MAN:
So how are you
today, Ellen?

1502
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,171
Fine.

1503
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:00,040
I understand
from Mrs. Cudahy

1504
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,908
and some of your other teachers

1505
01:23:01,944 --> 01:23:04,744
that you still don't seem
to be making any progress

1506
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:06,095
in the social way.

1507
01:23:06,131 --> 01:23:08,348
I don't want to be social.

1508
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:12,018
I might after I get
my own business straight.

1509
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:14,354
What business is that?

1510
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:16,089
Personal stuff.

1511
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:21,177
I think he liked it
when I wasn't too friendly--

1512
01:23:21,212 --> 01:23:23,597
because if everyone was
friendly and sweet

1513
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:24,898
he wouldn't have a job.

1514
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,733
I understand from your teachers

1515
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:30,070
that you've taken to signing
your papers differently.

1516
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,537
Did you realize that?

1517
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:34,407
Well, sure I realized it.

1518
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:38,078
You've been signing "Foster"
as your last name.

1519
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:39,745
You do realize that?

1520
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:43,884
Well, I guess I know
my last name, all right.

1521
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:46,519
Uh-huh, okay...

1522
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,388
Then tell me your name.

1523
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:51,208
Ellen Foster.

1524
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:54,711
But that isn't your last name.

1525
01:23:54,746 --> 01:23:56,829
Your name
is Hammond.

1526
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:57,930
Hmm?

1527
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,567
Ellen Hammond.

1528
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:03,236
Would you like
to talk about it?

1529
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:05,738
About what?

1530
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:07,707
About why you're
using that name.

1531
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:11,444
You see, Ellen--

1532
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,379
sometimes children
such as yourself

1533
01:24:13,414 --> 01:24:14,814
who've experienced

1534
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:16,116
a high degree
of distress

1535
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,084
tend to have
identity problems.

1536
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:19,853
It's not uncommon
for such a child

1537
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,204
to pretend he's...

1538
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:23,773
She's somebody else, you see?

1539
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,959
So what matters is
that you open up

1540
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,328
and talk to me.

1541
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:31,364
Get that pain out
of Ellen Hammond

1542
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:35,168
and she won't have
to be Ellen Foster.

1543
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:36,820
Hmm?

1544
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,839
Tell me what you're thinking.

1545
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:40,073
It's okay.

1546
01:24:41,677 --> 01:24:46,045
It may not be the name
God or my mama gave me

1547
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,381
but that's my name now.

1548
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:51,684
My old family
kind of wore the other one out.

1549
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:53,002
And I figured

1550
01:24:53,038 --> 01:24:55,322
I could start practicing
my new name

1551
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:56,789
of my new family

1552
01:24:56,824 --> 01:24:59,726
for when they are
my new family.

1553
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:03,162
Foster.

1554
01:25:03,197 --> 01:25:06,032
It's a clean, fresh name.

1555
01:25:12,957 --> 01:25:16,525
I notice your hands
are trembling a bit.

1556
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:20,246
Are you frightened,
Ellen?

1557
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:23,366
No.

1558
01:25:23,401 --> 01:25:24,851
I used to be scared

1559
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:28,087
but I'm getting to be
not so scared anymore.

1560
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,157
See, Ellen, the problem
isn't in the name.

1561
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:32,108
The problem is

1562
01:25:32,143 --> 01:25:34,661
why you think
you need a new name.

1563
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,629
Well, I just told you.

1564
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:39,332
You're the one who's mixed up.

1565
01:25:39,368 --> 01:25:44,070
Well, why don't we discuss it
some more next week.

1566
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:47,740
I don't plan on discussing
anything with you next week

1567
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:49,208
or any other time.

1568
01:25:49,243 --> 01:25:51,177
Excuse me.

1569
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,413
So long.

1570
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,759
Oh, yes!

1571
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:09,763
Sweet pumpkin, that's
a perfect place for that one.

1572
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:11,781
It's pulling down the branch?

1573
01:26:11,816 --> 01:26:13,566
So what?

1574
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:16,469
Ellen, what would you like
for Christmas

1575
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,037
by way of a present?

1576
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:19,639
Well, you already got me

1577
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,458
all that stuff
and clothes and all.

1578
01:26:22,493 --> 01:26:24,110
But it's Christmas!

1579
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:26,729
Everybody in this house
gets a present

1580
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:28,564
don't they, pumpkin?

1581
01:26:28,599 --> 01:26:31,183
Well, I could use
a handypack of white paper.

1582
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:33,403
Oh! Writing paper?

1583
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:35,021
No. The painting kind?

1584
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:37,307
I only got four sheets left.

1585
01:26:37,342 --> 01:26:39,359
Is that all?

1586
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:41,511
It's all I can think of
right now.

1587
01:26:41,546 --> 01:26:42,729
Oh.

1588
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:45,465
How you doing
with that tinsel, sweetie?

1589
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,250
Good.

1590
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,302
( gasping ):
Oh!

1591
01:26:49,338 --> 01:26:52,021
It's sweet.

1592
01:26:52,023 --> 01:26:54,741
Perfect.

1593
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:59,678
All that mattered was that
this time would be different

1594
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:01,180
from last year.

1595
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,449
And what with Christmas spirit

1596
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:07,553
I figure maybe they'll both
get to like me after all...

1597
01:27:07,588 --> 01:27:12,692
though you have to be careful
with dreaming like that

1598
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:16,029
especially with people
you don't know good.

1599
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,801
I'm going to make them
a present.

1600
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,369
What you going to make?

1601
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:24,937
I'm going to make them
a picture

1602
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:26,373
for them to hang
on the wall.

1603
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:28,474
Miss Hobbs always said
you were real good

1604
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:29,525
at picture painting.

1605
01:27:29,561 --> 01:27:30,910
It has to be a picture

1606
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:33,062
of something friendly
they'd like.

1607
01:27:33,098 --> 01:27:35,548
Maybe some cats
or a bunch of flowers.

1608
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:39,552
I don't think they'd care for
one of my experiment pictures

1609
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:40,820
or a brooding ocean.

1610
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:42,087
A what?

1611
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:43,556
Well, that's where the ocean

1612
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:46,526
looks real strong and beautiful
and sad all at the same time.

1613
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:49,312
They wouldn't like it
'cause it looks so evil

1614
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:51,031
when you first look at it.

1615
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:52,432
They would miss the point.

1616
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:54,200
I paint a lot
of brooding oceans.

1617
01:27:54,236 --> 01:27:56,736
And I can paint cats
a heap easier

1618
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,072
than brooding oceans anyways.

1619
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:00,824
So, they get fuzzy cats.

1620
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,509
King me.

1621
01:28:02,544 --> 01:28:03,659
( door opens )

1622
01:28:03,694 --> 01:28:06,162
Let me see how you're
doing there, sweetie.

1623
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:09,049
( gasping ):
Oh, you're the
Christmas angel.

1624
01:28:09,084 --> 01:28:10,683
Look how perfect
that is.

1625
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:11,884
( chuckling )

1626
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,353
Um, I want to give you
my present tonight

1627
01:28:14,388 --> 01:28:16,655
instead of waiting
for tomorrow, okay?

1628
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:19,408
Oh! Well, that'd be
very nice, Ellen.

1629
01:28:19,444 --> 01:28:20,443
You bet.

1630
01:28:23,615 --> 01:28:24,614
( giggling )

1631
01:28:24,649 --> 01:28:26,682
So, what do
you think?

1632
01:28:26,717 --> 01:28:27,750
Uh...

1633
01:28:27,785 --> 01:28:30,519
Well, Ellen,
that's really nice.

1634
01:28:30,554 --> 01:28:32,421
Did you trace it?

1635
01:28:32,456 --> 01:28:34,040
No, I didn't trace it.

1636
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:38,078
I painted it my own self
for you and your mama to hang

1637
01:28:38,113 --> 01:28:39,862
anywhere you see fit.

1638
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,865
Why, it's awful
sweet of you, honey.

1639
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,935
We'll hang that up first
thing in the morning.

1640
01:28:45,971 --> 01:28:47,954
What's wrong with right now?

1641
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:51,006
Well, that picture
needs a frame, honey.

1642
01:28:51,042 --> 01:28:54,010
A picture as pretty as that
calls for a nice frame.

1643
01:28:54,129 --> 01:28:56,262
I already got
some nice frames

1644
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:58,498
I made out of
colored paper.

1645
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,282
You can pick
the one you like best.

1646
01:29:00,284 --> 01:29:02,568
We can assemble
the whole business tonight.

1647
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:04,554
We going to put some old

1648
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:07,273
tacky paper frame
on our wall?

1649
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:09,175
Oh, Dora, be nice.

1650
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:10,243
This is so cute!

1651
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:11,945
It's not supposed to be cute.

1652
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,213
She's lying, Mama.

1653
01:29:13,248 --> 01:29:15,231
I bet she traced those cats.

1654
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:16,933
No, I did not trace them.

1655
01:29:16,968 --> 01:29:18,735
I painted them my own self

1656
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,354
and you're just too stupid
and selfish and fat

1657
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:23,456
to appreciate a present
made special for you

1658
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:26,459
instead of spending a fortune
on something out of the store!

1659
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:29,395
How dare you speak to my Dora
in that manner!

1660
01:29:29,431 --> 01:29:30,696
You need a good
spanking.

1661
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:32,064
Touch me, I'll kill you.

1662
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,200
I had enough getting beat up
from my own daddy.

1663
01:29:34,236 --> 01:29:35,435
Don't you dare
kill my Mama!

1664
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:37,237
You killed your own
mama and my grandma.

1665
01:29:37,272 --> 01:29:39,172
NADINE:
I want you
out of here.

1666
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,273
Do you hear me?!

1667
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:41,558
I didn't want you to begin with

1668
01:29:41,593 --> 01:29:43,192
and neither did Betsy;
nobody wants you.

1669
01:29:43,228 --> 01:29:45,661
I'll call that judge
first thing in the morning

1670
01:29:45,696 --> 01:29:48,280
right in his own home,
Christmas or no Christmas

1671
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:49,782
and get you
out of my house.

1672
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:51,718
Mama, there's
butter in my hair.

1673
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,820
Oh, baby,
I'm so sorry.

1674
01:29:57,174 --> 01:30:01,494
You won't have to be calling
any judges.

1675
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:53,045
# Joy to the world! #

1676
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:56,032
# The Lord has come #

1677
01:30:56,067 --> 01:31:00,970
# Let earth receive her king #

1678
01:31:01,005 --> 01:31:05,741
# Let every heart
prepare him room... #

1679
01:31:05,776 --> 01:31:08,260
Hi, pookie...hi...

1680
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,763
# And heaven and nature sing #

1681
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:16,102
# And heaven and heaven
and nature sing #

1682
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:18,103
# Joy to the world! #

1683
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:20,239
# The Savior reigns #

1684
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:22,124
( doorbell rings )

1685
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:24,994
# Let men their songs employ #

1686
01:31:25,029 --> 01:31:31,000
# While fields and floods,
rocks, hills and plains #

1687
01:31:31,035 --> 01:31:32,568
# Repeat the sounding joy... #

1688
01:31:32,603 --> 01:31:33,569
Yes?

1689
01:31:33,604 --> 01:31:35,004
Is Mrs. Foster home?

1690
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:37,673
You must have the wrong house.

1691
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:40,042
Nobody named Foster
lives here.

1692
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:42,828
Isn't this the
Foster family house?

1693
01:31:42,864 --> 01:31:45,564
Oh, well, yeah,
we're the foster family

1694
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,533
but her name is Montford.

1695
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:49,818
It says it right
on the mailbox.

1696
01:31:49,854 --> 01:31:51,804
Didn't you see
the mailbox?

1697
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,256
I guess I had it
figured out wrong.

1698
01:31:54,292 --> 01:31:55,341
Is she home?

1699
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:56,375
What's this?

1700
01:31:58,112 --> 01:31:59,812
Somebody looking for you.

1701
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:01,981
# What child is this... #

1702
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:03,482
Are you looking
for me?

1703
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,485
Why don't you come on in
out of the cold

1704
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:07,820
for starters?

1705
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:14,460
What's your name?

1706
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:15,811
Ellen.

1707
01:32:15,846 --> 01:32:17,496
Are you lost, honey?

1708
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:18,764
No, ma'am.

1709
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:20,566
And you're looking for me?

1710
01:32:20,602 --> 01:32:21,567
Mm-hmm.

1711
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,602
You look a bit familiar.

1712
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:26,339
Have I seen you
someplace before?

1713
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:27,606
Maybe at church.

1714
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:29,842
And I was outside
your house one time.

1715
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:31,244
Yes, now I remember.

1716
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:33,846
Well, why don't you
take your coat off

1717
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:35,848
and tell me
what's happening?

1718
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:37,249
"Que pasa?"

1719
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:38,884
Who taught you that?

1720
01:32:38,919 --> 01:32:40,353
A friend of mine.

1721
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,489
Oh, my, what
a pretty dress!

1722
01:32:43,525 --> 01:32:46,842
I wanted to look good.

1723
01:32:46,877 --> 01:32:48,944
You like hot chocolate?

1724
01:32:48,979 --> 01:32:51,280
I'm very fond
of hot chocolate.

1725
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:54,483
My mama used to say
that hot chocolate's

1726
01:32:54,519 --> 01:32:58,020
one of the most comforting
things in life...

1727
01:32:58,056 --> 01:32:59,422
on-on a cold day.

1728
01:32:59,457 --> 01:33:03,342
Tell me, honey, have you
run away from home?

1729
01:33:03,378 --> 01:33:05,978
No, but I need
a place to stay.

1730
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:09,448
What do you think
about me staying here?

1731
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:11,283
Are you sure you
didn't run away?

1732
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:12,685
I bet your
mama and daddy

1733
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:14,921
are pretty worried
about you right now.

1734
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:17,656
My mama's dead
and my daddy's in jail

1735
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:20,893
and I've been thrown
out of my aunt's house.

1736
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:22,645
She showed me the door.

1737
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,146
I see.

1738
01:33:24,181 --> 01:33:27,650
And how did you know
to come here?

1739
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:30,235
I seen you in church,
you and your girls

1740
01:33:30,237 --> 01:33:33,155
and I asked Dora who you
were and she told me--

1741
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,540
that's my cousin--

1742
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:37,827
and I figured since you already
got some girls my size

1743
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,228
you might be able

1744
01:33:39,264 --> 01:33:40,830
to squeeze
me in, too.

1745
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,498
I see.

1746
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:46,568
Well, I usually have children
referred to me by the court.

1747
01:33:46,604 --> 01:33:49,288
I never had a situation
like this.

1748
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:52,642
Well, I got something
to help you make up your mind.

1749
01:33:52,677 --> 01:33:54,143
Really?

1750
01:33:54,178 --> 01:33:55,961
It's $166 there.

1751
01:33:55,997 --> 01:33:57,296
You can count it.

1752
01:33:57,332 --> 01:34:00,949
I saved it up from when before
my daddy was in jail.

1753
01:34:00,985 --> 01:34:02,601
Various sources
here and there.

1754
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,687
Julia and Roy gave
me an allowance.

1755
01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:06,021
They've gone off now.

1756
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,356
They're friends of mine.

1757
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:09,158
I want to pay you
this money

1758
01:34:09,193 --> 01:34:11,861
so we can keep this
all on the up and up.

1759
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,996
That way, you and
me can be even.

1760
01:34:14,032 --> 01:34:15,915
You get the money

1761
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:19,969
and I can stay here till
I graduate from high school.

1762
01:34:20,004 --> 01:34:22,188
How does that sound to you?

1763
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:25,658
Look, you put this
back in your pocket.

1764
01:34:25,693 --> 01:34:27,860
No deal, huh?

1765
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:31,330
Tell you what
I'm going to do.

1766
01:34:31,366 --> 01:34:34,866
I have to get lots more
information about this situation

1767
01:34:34,902 --> 01:34:36,536
and first thing
in the morning

1768
01:34:36,571 --> 01:34:38,855
I'm going to call
County Social Services

1769
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:41,157
and see if we can't
get the ball rolling.

1770
01:34:41,192 --> 01:34:43,242
I can't promise you anything.

1771
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:45,745
That's okay.
I'm used to it.

1772
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,289
It's okay, honey.

1773
01:34:59,710 --> 01:35:01,310
You're safe here.

1774
01:35:19,013 --> 01:35:21,981
Nobody else put up a fight
to get me.

1775
01:35:22,016 --> 01:35:24,600
Surprise, surprise.

1776
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:29,721
There've been more
than plenty of days

1777
01:35:29,757 --> 01:35:32,825
when my new mama
has put my hands in hers

1778
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:37,763
and said if we relax
and breathe slow together

1779
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:40,433
I could slow down shaking.

1780
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:42,568
And it always works.

1781
01:35:42,603 --> 01:35:45,488
Every day,
I try to feel a little better

1782
01:35:45,523 --> 01:35:48,524
about all that went on
when I was little.

1783
01:35:48,559 --> 01:35:53,111
I will eventually get it
straightened out in my head.

1784
01:35:58,453 --> 01:36:02,688
I came a long way to get here.

1785
01:36:02,723 --> 01:36:05,725
That will always amaze me.
