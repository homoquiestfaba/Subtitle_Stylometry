00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,760

ADMISSION WAS
HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,778
AND THERE SEEMED TO BE AN
OVER-EMPHASIS PLACED ON
ATHLETICS.

12
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,713
SO WHEN MY COUNSELOR SUGGESTED

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,751

MY CHANCES OF GRADUATING...

GOOD MORNING,
THIS IS DEAN GOLDMAN.

WALLY CROWDER,

739
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:15,053
WAS INVOLVED IN A TERRIBLE CAR
ACCIDENT ON SEAVEY ROAD.

740
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:19,190
(Dean Goldman) 
WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION AT
THIS TIME,

741
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,227
HOWEVER, THE POLICE HAVE
CONFIRMED...

742
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,728
(Staverman) 
...THAT HE WAS TAKEN BY
AMBULANCE

743
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,697
TO ST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL.

744
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:29,067
HE WAS TRAVELING ALONE
AT THE TIME...

745
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,736
(Goldman) 
IT APPEARS THAT NO OTHER
VEHICLES WERE INVOLVED,

746

AND NO ONE ELSE WAS INJURED.

THIS IS A VERY SAD DAY FOR ALL
OF US.

752
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,819

HOLD OUT GOOD THOUGHTS

754
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,825
WE HOPE TO GET WORD FROM THE
HOSPITAL SHORTLY

755
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,060

DISEASE AND POVERTY

ARE PUSHING IN ON US.

WHEN WE OUGHT TO HAVE

797
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:26,844
A MARVELOUS WORLD
OF PEACE AND LOVE.

798
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,747
WHAT'S WRONG?

799
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:33,051

THAT QUESTION:  WHY?

800
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:37,355
WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME OF US?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WORLD?

801
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:40,691
IS THERE AN ANSWER TO IT ALL?

802
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,060
DOES ANYBODY CARE?

803
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,597
DOES ANYBODY REALLY LOVE YOU?

804
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:50,635
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
IMPORTANT TO GOD.

805
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:55,206
JUST AS THOUGH YOU WERE THE ONLY
PERSON THAT EVER LIVED.

806
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:58,109
AND GOD LOVES YOU.

807
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:02,013
AND HE WANTS TO FORGIVE YOU OF
YOUR FAILURES AND YOUR SINS,

808
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:05,850
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE TIME
THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER.

809
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:09,220
HE'S WILLING TO
FORGIVE YOU TONIGHT.

810
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,091
AND COVER IT UP AS THOUGH
IT HAD NEVER HAPPENED.

811
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,894
GOD DOESN'T JUST SAY, "I LOVE
YA, I FORGIVE YA."

812
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,063
HE DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

813
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,300
HE SENT HIS SON, CHRIST,
TO DIE ON THE CROSS.

814
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,935
AND WHEN CHRIST DIED
ON THAT CROSS,

815
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:28,139
HE TOOK YOUR SINS AND MY SINS
ON HIMSELF.

816
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:31,409
AND HE TOOK MY SINS
AND YOUR SINS

817
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:34,779
AND BURIED THEM
IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA.

818
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,715
AND HE FORGETS THEM.

819
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:41,219
WELL, YOU SAY, "BILLY, I KNOW
THAT JESUS DID ALL THAT FOR US

820
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,988
BECAUSE HE LOVED US.
I KNOW THAT.

821
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,157
BUT WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO?"

822
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:49,527
FIRST - YOU HAVE TO
REPENT OF YOUR SINS.

823
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:52,063
JESUS SAID, "I CAME NOT
TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS,

824
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:54,398
BUT SINNERS, TO REPENTANCE."

825
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,167
SOME LITTLE BOY SAID,

826
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,803
"REPENTANCE MEANS BEING
SORRY ENOUGH TO QUIT."

827
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,172
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD DEFINITION.

828
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:04,876
AND THEN THE SECOND THING
IS FAITH.

829
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:08,012
WITHOUT FAITH, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO PLEASE GOD.

830
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,181
YOU SAY, "WELL, WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?"

831
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:12,717
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WORK UP.

832
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,719
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU DO WITH
YOUR HEAD.

833
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,754
IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DO WITH
YOUR BODY.

834
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,156
WITH YOUR HEART.

835
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,991
WITH YOUR EMOTIONS.

836
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,692
WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE, YOU
SAY,

837
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,395
"I GIVE MYSELF TO CHRIST."

838
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:29,400
THE THIRD THING--
YOU MUST OBEY HIM.

839
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,435
YOU MUST LIVE FOR HIM.

840
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,804
AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TONIGHT

841
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,840
TO RECEIVE CHRIST
INTO YOUR HEART.

842
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:40,545
AND LIVE FOR HIM THE BEST YOU
CAN WITH HIS HELP.

843
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:43,314
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU
TO STAND TO YOUR FEET.

844
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:46,250
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO
JOIN ANY ORGANIZATION

845
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,818
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

846
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:52,056
I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO RECEIVE
CHRIST INTO YOUR HEART.

847
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,791
TONIGHT IS A GOOD STARTING PLACE

848
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,293
WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE

849
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,161
AND MANY THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE PRAYING.

850
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,630
YOU CAN GET STARTED AND SAY,

851
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,067
"LORD, I WANT TO START,

852
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,670
MAYBE AFRESH OR ANEW WITH YOU.

853
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,838
I'VE BEEN SORT OF A FAILURE
UP 'TIL NOW.

854
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,974
I BELIEVE,
BUT I HAVEN'T BELIEVED.

855
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:13,978
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
TONIGHT, IS TO GET STARTED."

856
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:17,415
YOU SAY, "BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PRAY."

857
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:20,718
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PRAY LIKE A PREACHER.

858
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,554
YOU JUST TALK TO GOD

859
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,791
AS THOUGH HE WERE YOUR BEST
FRIEND WHICH HE IS.

860
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,426
TELL HIM EVERYTHING.

861
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:29,794
SAY, "LORD I LOVE YOU.

862
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:32,396
I... I PRAISE YOU.

863
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,232
I THANK YOU."

864
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,135
AND THEN SAY, "LORD,
I NEED SOME HELP.

865
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,237
PLEASE HELP ME."

866
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,474
PRAY IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS.

867
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,544
AND HE'LL HELP YOU.

868
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:48,946
HE ANSWERS EVERY PRAYER.

869
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,552
YOU GET THE GAS,

870
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:55,953
THROW IT UP ON THERE...

871
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,989
VAROOM!!

872
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,896
MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

873
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,232
WE'RE GOING TO
KEEP THIS REAL SHORT.

874
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,468
AFTER DISCUSSIONS
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

875
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:12,703
AT WESTBURY PARK HIGH SCHOOL,

876
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:16,007
WE HAVE DECIDED TO CANCEL
THIS YEAR'S HOMECOMING.

877
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:17,441
[many students]
WHY? WHAT FOR?

878

 STAYED THERE.

1051
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,298
WELL, HERE'S SOMETHING

1052
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:23,700
I NEVER THOUGHT
   I'D BE ABLE TO RETURN--

1053
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,970
YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

1054
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:33,110
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME A LOT
   WALLY.

1055
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,648
NOBODY DESERVES THIS MORE
   THAN YOU.

1056
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,353
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY, WALLY?

1057
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,590
THANKS, JORDY.

1058
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,427
I'M GENUINELY TOUCHED.

1059
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:59,736
HEY-- I WONDER HOW MUCH THIS
THING IS WORTH MELTED DOWN?

1060
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,675
SO, MAY I HAVE THE HONOR?

1061
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:08,578
BY ALL MEANS.

1062
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:14,851
♪ [violins
rising in intensity] ♪

1063
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,487
(Jordy) 
Y'KNOW, GOD MADE EACH OF US
UNIQUE...

1064
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,556
AND WE SPEND OUR WHOLE LIVES

1065
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,825
TRYING TO BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

1066
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:24,528
THIS WAS MY HOMECOMING.

1067
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:27,864
FINDING THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE
LOVE OF HIS FOLLOWERS.

1068
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:32,702
TO BE ACCEPTED...
JUST AS I AM.

1069
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:35,539
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO FOLLOW
SOMEBODY.

1070
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:38,842
THE WAY HOME IS SIMPLE.

1071
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:42,646
JESUS SAID IT BEST...

1072
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:44,815
"FOLLOW ME."
