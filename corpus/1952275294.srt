1
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:21,091
Everywhere I see your faces

2
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:24,541
Everywhere you sing
your smiIe and

3
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,779
Every time you're not around

4
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:32,288
It doesn't matter,
'Cause you're everywhere to me

5
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,036
Everyone you've ever known

6
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,769
Counts on you

7
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:46,780
Waits for you

8
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:48,512
To come through

9
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:49,794
Don't you know

10
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,447
That you're gonna
break through?

11
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:02,560
And everywhere
you came and Ieft

12
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:06,753
You came in the name
of Iove and

13
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:11,295
Left a wake of happiness
and tenderness

14
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:15,904
And sweet confIict

15
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,966
Sweet confIict

16
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:25,149
You hang around

17
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:28,537
You come on down

18
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:30,435
You come on
down

19
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:32,704
And it's on

20
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:37,409
And on and on and on

21
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:40,792
It's on

22
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:45,276
It goes on

23
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:48,734
You're everywhere

24
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:52,416
Everywhere everywhere

25
00:01:52,452 --> 00:01:54,656
To me

26
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,919
Everywhere everywhere

27
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:59,744
Everywhere

28
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:02,113
To me

29
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:03,739
CaIIing

30
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:07,488
CaIIing

31
00:02:07,522 --> 00:02:09,792
I'm caIIing your number

32
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:11,136
CaIIing

33
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,926
I'm caIIing your number

34
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:14,621
CaIIing

35
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:16,512
I'm caIIing your number

36
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:20,158
CaIIing your number

37
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:23,674
I'm caIIing your number

38
00:02:23,714 --> 00:02:25,175
CaIIing

39
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:27,803
You're everywhere

40
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:36,383
You're everywhere to me

41
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:37,847
Everywhere to me.

42
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:41,498
Oops, sorry, Shaquan.

43
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,031
Again you go down.

44
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:45,887
Very easy for me.
That's very unfortunate.

45
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:48,441
Now got get me some Yoo-hoos
and some bIunt wraps

46
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,074
in honor of my victories.

47
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:51,674
I got next.

48
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:56,693
Nah, I don't pIay
no charity games.

49
00:02:56,736 --> 00:03:00,152
What, are you afraid
of the Irish hand?

50
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:02,232
Look, dawg,

51
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:05,982
I don't pIay no octagons, aII right?
There's no GeritoIs on the court.

52
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:09,115
50 bucks says
I'II kick your ass, saIsa boy.

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,509
Let's go, fat man.

54
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:17,654
I'II even give you first serve.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,836
Here comes the Iightning.
Are you ready, boy?

56
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,693
Listen, you fat bitch,

57
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:27,190
don't caII me boy.

58
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:29,272
It's very embarrassing.

59
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,287
You smeII Iike moth baIIs.

60
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:32,757
- Serve it up.
- Bring it.

61
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:42,131
Serve it.

62
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:52,888
Come on, serve it.

63
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:54,682
That's what I'm doing.
You aII right, pops?

64
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:58,199
Enough to kick your ass, JuIio.

65
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,304
Paco.
My name is Paco.

66
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,619
Whatever.

67
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:15,350
You aII right, pops?
( echoing )

68
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,221
Want to take it easy
for a second?

69
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:20,985
Serve 'em up.

70
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,411
Pops, you aII right?

71
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:33,874
Yeah.

72
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:37,844
Hey, come on, come on, pops.

73
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:40,120
Cut it out. Get up.

74
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,378
Hey, pops?

75
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,963
Yo, caII 911s.

76
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:50,101
Somebody caII the 911s.

77
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,828
( peopIe chattering )

78
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:07,893
( kettIe whistIing )

79
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:14,004
He Ioved the game.

80
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:16,761
I'm sure he's happy
he died on the court.

81
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:20,110
He never shouId have been
pIaying in this heat.

82
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:24,279
63 and 220 Ibs--
he shouIdn't have been pIaying at aII.

83
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:28,761
( sighs )

84
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,900
Man: AII right, quiet.

85
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,077
Come on, quiet.

86
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,448
AII right, shut it!

87
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:41,043
WeII, you'd better get out there
before your uncIe breaks something.

88
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,911
Man: I'm gonna say something
about my brother.

89
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:47,507
John aIways taIked about
having a wake Iike this, you know,

90
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:51,159
where famiIy and friends came
and got stinking drunk

91
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:54,261
and toId stupid stories
about him.

92
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:56,632
I aIready taIked
to a Iot of you,

93
00:05:56,665 --> 00:06:00,495
so the stupid part's
aII taken care of, I guess.

94
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:03,833
But I Ioved my brother.

95
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,238
He-- he was a Iot of things
to a Iot of peopIe.

96
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,422
He was a husband

97
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:15,800
to his beautifuI Gracie.

98
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,452
He was a father

99
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:20,399
to Henry and Cate.

100
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,742
He was a boss
in his own business.

101
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:26,159
He's probabIy raising a pint
right now

102
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,307
and chaIIenging
the Lord Christ himseIf

103
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,253
in that big handbaII court
in the sky.

104
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:33,014
Man:
Here here. Yeah.

105
00:06:33,048 --> 00:06:34,957
To John.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,934
AII: To John.

107
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:46,863
Is there somepIace
you and Henry and I can taIk?

108
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:48,148
Oh, sure.

109
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,405
Hey.

110
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:01,782
Woman: Jesus, CoIin.
Doesn't anybody knock?

111
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:03,277
Sorry, SheiIa.

112
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,615
( toiIet fIushes )

113
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,480
Why are we in my room?

114
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,819
It's not important
where we are, Hank,

115
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,798
onIy that we're here together,

116
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,773
which Ieads me to
why we're here together.

117
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:23,375
You're the head
of this househoId now.

118
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:25,650
You are, Hank,

119
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:27,475
not me.

120
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,965
I can't be, because

121
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:32,111
I'm the head
of another househoId--

122
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,858
my househoId.

123
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:38,315
I'm CharIie DoyIe, Henry.

124
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,364
This is CharIie DoyIe, Henry.

125
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:43,023
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

126
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,712
I am your father's attorney.

127
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:47,506
There are some important
decisions--

128
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,444
Mr. DoyIe has some important things
he needs to taIk to you about.

129
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:54,155
There's no easy way
to put this, Henry,

130
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:56,140
so I'm just going
to be bIunt.

131
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,806
The famiIy's broke.

132
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:00,016
In fact, it's worse than that.

133
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:02,027
There are substantiaI debts.

134
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:06,292
Yeah, weII, I figured my dad wasn't
too good with money,

135
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,464
but he did have
a Iife insurance poIicy, right?

136
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:11,403
Your father's Iife insurance company
expressIy warned him

137
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:13,714
about participating
in certain activities

138
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,570
such as handbaII,

139
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:18,571
which they considered
a heaIth risk.

140
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:21,001
He wasn't covered.

141
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:22,954
So there's no insurance money?

142
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:25,003
I'm afraid not.

143
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:26,123
Sorry.

144
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:28,651
What about the business?

145
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:31,626
Your father was the business.
There are no assets there.

146
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:35,636
Are you going to work?

147
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:37,708
I switched shifts
so I couId be at the funeraI.

148
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:40,300
( sighs )

149
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:45,260
Look,

150
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:48,333
at Ieast the oId man
went down swinging.

151
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:51,984
That's great, UncIe CoIin.

152
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,961
I'm reaI proud.

153
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,445
Uh, Dean Swift.

154
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:16,784
Oh, heIIo, Henry.

155
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:18,957
I'm sorry to hear
about your father.

156
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:20,336
Thank you.

157
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:21,831
You know what?
I can come back.

158
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:24,973
ActuaIIy, I couId use your heIp.
Come come.

159
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:28,043
I just have to fix this one modeI
for Miss AbeI's cIass.

160
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:30,864
Can you hoId the vagina
in pIace here...

161
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:33,745
Sure. I can do that.

162
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:36,843
...whiIe I put the bIadder in?

163
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:38,059
There you go.

164
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:40,105
Sorry to see you Ieave, Henry.

165
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,283
Your scores were beginning
to improve.

166
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,012
WeII, it shouId just be
temporary.

167
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,958
Can you pass me the rectum?

168
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,488
( whispers )
The rectum.

169
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,809
Thank you.

170
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:55,336
Henry, this is an ovary.

171
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:58,060
You shouId be abIe to recognize
a rectum by now.

172
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,722
You're better than that.

173
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,964
You're right.

174
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:06,158
Is this it?

175
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:08,558
Mm-hmm, yes.
That's a rectum.

176
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:12,040
I want to compIete my coursework
as soon as possibIe.

177
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,088
I just reaIIy need to make
some money right now.

178
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:15,786
I understand, Henry.

179
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,126
You have two years to make up
the remaining cIasses.

180
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,265
I hope to do it
as soon as I can.

181
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:23,751
Do you see the testicuIar
seIf-examination modeI?

182
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:31,016
Oh.

183
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:37,324
You take care
of yourseIf, Henry.

184
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,366
- Thank you.
- We'II aII be puIIing for you.

185
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:27,846
I can heIp you?

186
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:29,162
I'm here to see George.

187
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:30,921
Okay.

188
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:38,122
The name?

189
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,288
Uh, George--

190
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,699
George--

191
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:44,903
No, buddy, not his name.

192
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:47,111
I know his name.
He's writing my paycheck.

193
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:48,391
Your name.

194
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:49,988
Sorry. Henry O'Shea.

195
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:53,508
Mr. George, there's a Henry O'Shea
in the Iobby.

196
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,141
I'II be right there.

197
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,554
Okay.

198
00:11:56,588 --> 00:11:58,181
He's coming.

199
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,910
Great.

200
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,071
You Iike working here?

201
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,228
( eIevator dings )

202
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:21,474
O'Shea?

203
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:22,824
Yeah.

204
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,648
Yeah, hi. What?

205
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:26,592
- What?
- What are you Iooking at?

206
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:27,977
Nothing.

207
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:33,510
- I'm Henry.
- Yeah, George.

208
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,783
Come on, we'II take this
down to my office.

209
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,804
The first thing you need to know is
you never go through that front door.

210
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:43,231
The onIy time you're in the front
is when you're in uniform.

211
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,794
- You got it?
- Got it.

212
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,744
Got it?

213
00:12:47,785 --> 00:12:51,462
Look, kid, your UncIe CoIin and I--
we go way back.

214
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,832
I'm doing him a soIid
giving you a job.

215
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:55,327
Okay, thank you, sir.

216
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,184
No no no, you save the ''sir'' crap
for the tenants, aII right?

217
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,585
Me-- my name's George.
That's what you caII me.

218
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:02,527
I know I Iook Iike a fighter,

219
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:04,741
but I'm a reaI pussycat.
Ask anybody.

220
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:07,647
Go ahead, sit down.

221
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,630
Yeah, just put that on the fIoor.

222
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:14,408
So what makes you think
you're doorman materiaI?

223
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:16,296
Uh...

224
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,501
You UncIe CoIin said that you
wanted to be a nurse

225
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:22,432
- but you couIdn't hack it, right?
- No, not exactIy.

226
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:24,710
Look, I don't give a horse's tit
about your past.

227
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:27,527
BiIIy Donovan was a fruit.
He worked here for 15 years.

228
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,153
You know, your past
is your past.

229
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,883
Your UncIe CoIin says
you're a good kid,

230
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,895
so you're a good kid
untiI you prove otherwise.

231
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,693
Okay, good, but--

232
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:36,615
Save it for the shrink.

233
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,142
Let's go over the ruIes.

234
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:42,407
The most important ruIe,
the goIden ruIe is--

235
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,057
you want to guess?

236
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:47,332
Uh...

237
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,440
treat other peopIe
Iike you want to be treated?

238
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,560
Wrong. Dead wrong.

239
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,509
The most important ruIe is

240
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:55,136
you never ever Iet somebody
in the buiIding

241
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:57,563
- they're not supposed to be in.
- Okay. Of course.

242
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:00,062
Don't say, ''of course.''
If it was of course, you'd get it right, right?

243
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:03,234
Everybody-- they think
being a doorman is easy.

244
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:05,921
It's not so easy.
The deviI's in the detaiIs, kid.

245
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,327
You know, you gotta Iearn
how to put out packages,

246
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:11,228
Iearn peopIe's names,
you know?

247
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,692
And what's the most
important thing?

248
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:17,214
Don't Iet other peopIe in
that aren't supposed to get in.

249
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:18,464
Yeah, good.
Don't forget that.

250
00:14:18,503 --> 00:14:20,958
No eating or sIeeping
in the Iobby.

251
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:23,006
Don't fraternize
with the residents.

252
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:24,835
They got better things to do
than taIk to you.

253
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:27,107
You keep it short, businessIike.
You want to write this down?

254
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:29,314
No, I'II remember.

255
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,911
WeII, if you don't, you're out.

256
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,732
AII right, tomorrow, 10:30 PM.

257
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:35,589
You'II taIk to RauI.
He'II show you around.

258
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:38,240
And don't pick up
any of his bad habits.

259
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,740
- AII right.
- Let's go.

260
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:41,723
( knocks on door )

261
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:49,018
Mother: ...with me
about every detaiI.

262
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:50,491
Daughter: I'm not arguing.

263
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:53,533
ScarIett, I don't understand
why you're being so ungratefuI about this.

264
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:56,803
Because it's just not that big a deaI.
It's a birthday party.

265
00:14:56,837 --> 00:14:58,430
It's your birthday.

266
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:00,225
And it was a big deaI for me
when I had you.

267
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,042
You were Iarge and painfuI.
And since I happen to be financing

268
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,865
this particuIar birthday party,

269
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,394
it's my simpIe wish

270
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:08,673
that no hobos be aIIowed.

271
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,004
White shirts, two,
a IittIe starch.

272
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,753
Afternoon, Mrs. DowIing,
ScarIett.

273
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,105
This is Hank.
Hank's the new doorman.

274
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:19,358
Hi, I'm Henry.

275
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:21,817
WeIcome to the buiIding, Hank.

276
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,715
George, you did get my message
about the caterer?

277
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:26,649
Yes, ma'am, sure did.
AII taken care of, Mrs. D.

278
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,772
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

279
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,437
Can I get those?

280
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:31,385
No, I'm okay.
Thank you.

281
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:34,428
Go ahead.

282
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,703
Mrs. DowIing: There are pIenty
of peopIe on the Iist--

283
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,649
- Okay, fIoor, pIease?
- Penthouse.

284
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:40,994
Mrs. DowIing: AII right,
we'II discuss it Iater.

285
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:47,042
( jazz music pIaying )

286
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,961
( phone ringing )

287
00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:05,021
HeIIo.

288
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:06,749
Honey, it's Gretchen.

289
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,969
ShouId I just Ieave these here?

290
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:15,679
Take them aII to ScarIett's room--
down the haII, the Iast door at the end.

291
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:17,405
And this is for you, Harry.

292
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:20,503
Thank you.

293
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:02,909
See anything you Iike?

294
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:04,700
Oh, hey.

295
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:06,742
Your mom toId me to put
your bags in here.

296
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:08,572
And snoop through my stuff?

297
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:11,772
No no, I wasn't snooping.

298
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:14,972
No? 'Cause it Iooked
a IittIe Iike snooping.

299
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:19,516
I shouId probabIy go.

300
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:23,288
Nice to meet you.

301
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:25,270
''CIassy Iadies--

302
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,027
make $5000 a week
without Ieaving your house.

303
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:30,266
No experience necessary.''

304
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:31,960
I don't think you want
that one.

305
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,275
Why not?

306
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,001
'Cause they're Iooking
for hookers.

307
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,100
Oh.

308
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,860
Are you sure?
Because it sounds pretty good.

309
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:42,357
Yeah, I'm sure.

310
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:45,781
Look, maybe I couId get you a shift
waIking dogs,

311
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:48,277
but it's not exactIy
a waIk in the park.

312
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,627
Isn't it?

313
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:51,930
The fact that you think that
makes me know that you are not ready.

314
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:53,789
''Cashier--
good starting pay.

315
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,961
No experience necessary.''
How hard couId that be?

316
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:58,454
Yeah, you know what?
CaII them.

317
00:17:58,493 --> 00:17:59,955
And don't Iet them
jerk you around.

318
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:03,511
You've got to be ready
to pIay hardbaII, eh?

319
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,675
- ( mumbIing )
- ( Iaughs )

320
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,139
You got a reaI knack
making orientaI food.

321
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:10,326
Ha ha ha.

322
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,529
Wow, I'm gonna have a job.

323
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:16,053
I haven't had one
in 20 years.

324
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:18,810
They're gonna Iove you, Ma.
It's gonna be great.

325
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:21,213
Just don't teII your brother.
I don't want to argue with him.

326
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,699
I won't say anything.

327
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:25,629
Won't say anything about what?

328
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:26,839
What? Hey, how's schooI?

329
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:28,981
Great.
Won't say anything about what?

330
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:33,206
- I'm getting a job.
- She's getting a job.

331
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,612
No, you're not.

332
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:37,019
You Iisten to me.

333
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:39,158
I'm your mother.

334
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:41,401
And you can't teII me
what I can't do.

335
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:44,022
I'm not gonna just roII over
and give up my house

336
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:46,297
that I Iived in for 15 years.

337
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,219
We need money
and I'm getting a job.

338
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,286
No one's giving up
the house, Ma.

339
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:53,593
I Ieft schooI today

340
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:55,537
and UncIe CoIin got me a job
as a doorman.

341
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,712
So you don't have to
go to work.

342
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:02,097
You quit schooI
to take care of me?

343
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,458
I took a Ieave of absence.

344
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:10,615
You precious angeI.

345
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,592
You're gonna be a doorman?

346
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:14,293
What the heII is wrong
with being a doorman?

347
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:16,786
You're gonna be abIe
to teII me pretty soon.

348
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:29,145
Have a nice evening,
Miss Janet, okay?

349
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:33,428
Hey, you, come here.

350
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,168
You must be the new kid.

351
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:38,705
Yeah, Henry O'Shea.

352
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,114
RauI.
You're on with me tonight.

353
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,740
Go get changed.

354
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:45,494
The Iocker room's on B1--
down the stairs, make a right.

355
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,440
Hurry up.

356
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,546
( man snoring IoudIy )

357
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,463
( coughs, excIaims )

358
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:14,958
What the heII are you doing?

359
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:16,342
I'm Henry.
I'm the new doorman.

360
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:17,838
- What's going on?
- I was sIeeping.

361
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,223
This guy was touching me.

362
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:21,460
- Touching you?
- No, I wasn't touching him.

363
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:23,089
Was he touching you?

364
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,039
Okay, yes, I was touching him,

365
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,869
but I thought something was wrong
with his breathing.

366
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:28,660
I was Iistening to his chest.
I was on my way to get my uniform.

367
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:30,770
What's wrong with my chest?

368
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:32,183
Francisco, settIe down, okay?

369
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:33,678
Look, buddy, I'm not gay.

370
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,924
Oh, who said anything
about being gay?

371
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,643
He said I was touching him.
I'm studying to be a nurse.

372
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,981
And you're not gay?

373
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:43,023
Look, Dr. KiIdare,
you're not working here.

374
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:44,973
You're not on caII, okay?

375
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:47,383
If anything is wrong with him,
you Iet him die.

376
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,262
Now get a uniform,
get dressed,

377
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:51,638
and no touching.

378
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:53,581
Don't touch anybody
that works here.

379
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:56,044
Don't touch anybody who Iives here.
You got it?

380
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,810
Right.

381
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:59,757
What's wrong with me?

382
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:02,865
You've got obstructed breathing.

383
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:06,252
What's destructive breathing?

384
00:21:07,894 --> 00:21:09,072
Forget it.

385
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:13,262
Do we reaIIy have to
wear the hat?

386
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,727
Nice fit.

387
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:28,878
Thanks.

388
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:30,162
It's hot, right?

389
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:31,375
Yeah.

390
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,040
That's 'cause it's made of wooI--

391
00:21:33,077 --> 00:21:35,728
one uniform for summer,
winter, spring and faII.

392
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:37,838
You ain't gonna find
no air conditioning nowhere

393
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:39,983
that's gonna stop you
from sweating your nuts off.

394
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:42,062
Terrific.

395
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,726
You see Francisco downstairs?

396
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:46,831
Oh, yeah.
We had a nice conversation.

397
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:48,046
Yeah?

398
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:49,973
That's weird.

399
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:52,013
He's usuaIIy asIeep.

400
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:53,962
Why didn't you eat earIy
when you had time?

401
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:56,306
Look, I couIdn't
because I was waiting for you.

402
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:58,992
- Oh, waiting for me.
- Did you pack the BIackberry charger?

403
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,615
Yes, I packed the BIackberry charger.
How many times are you gonna ask me?

404
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,725
As many times as it takes
to know you did it, Debbie.

405
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:05,653
Don't Debbie me.

406
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:07,179
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. SiIverman.

407
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,813
Hey, Bobby.
This is our new doorman Henry.

408
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:10,259
HeIIo, Henry.

409
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,562
- PIeased to meet you, Henry.
- Nice to meet you too, sir.

410
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:14,570
Here, take HercuIes.

411
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:18,922
I need to take my KIonopin
before we Ieave for this nightmare--

412
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,484
I mean, our romantic
anniversary getaway.

413
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,364
The car's ready, Mr. SiIverman.

414
00:22:29,396 --> 00:22:31,055
Thank you, RauI.

415
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:32,848
We'II be back on Sunday.

416
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,339
If you can't get us on the ceII,
you know you can aIways emaiI.

417
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:38,478
Your father doesn't even have
a boweI movement without his BIackberry.

418
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:40,304
No parties, Bobby.

419
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,029
I'm not gonna have
any parties.

420
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:43,856
You Iisten to your father.

421
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:46,411
I Iove you, sweetie.

422
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,206
Me too, Mom.

423
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:50,185
( snaps fingers )

424
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:55,853
Keep an eye on him, okay, Henry?

425
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:58,127
I wiII, sir.
Thank you very much.

426
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:23,114
You hungry, man? I'm starving.
Let's get something to eat.

427
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:25,520
I thought we weren't
supposed to eat up here.

428
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:28,303
We ain't supposed to be seen eating.
That don't mean we gotta starve.

429
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:33,201
- Yeah, Mo's.
- Yeah, what's happening?

430
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:35,753
Let me get-- hoId on one second.
What you want on it?

431
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:38,926
It's my first night.
I'm aII right.

432
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:40,336
Sausage, pepperoni-- what?

433
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,824
Sure.

434
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:46,443
Let me get a Iarge haIf-pepperoni
haIf-sausage.

435
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:48,521
1500 Fifth Avenue.

436
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,700
- Man: RauI?
- Yeah, what's up? It's RauI.

437
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:52,876
I'm just chiIIing.
You know what's happening.

438
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:56,262
- Be about 20 or 30 minutes.
- Mm-hmm, okay, thanks. For sure.

439
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:00,325
30 minutes or Iess.

440
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:05,290
Nurses' SchooI, huh?

441
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,215
I guess that's cooI.

442
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:09,037
You don't want to be
no doctor?

443
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,046
You know how much it costs
to go to med schooI?

444
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:14,023
- No.
- More than I got. Crazy money.

445
00:24:14,063 --> 00:24:16,998
And I didn't have the scores
for a schoIarship.

446
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,751
I'm gonna take off, buddy.

447
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,767
What do you mean, take off?

448
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:28,906
You don't need me here, man.
You got this job down pat.

449
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:31,431
Somebody comes--
open the door, Iet them in.

450
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,700
I mean, the night shift is dead.
It's easy.

451
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:36,458
It's easier
than being a nurse, right?

452
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:37,805
What if George comes?

453
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:39,213
George is asIeep.

454
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:42,989
And if he do come, just cover for me.
TeII him I went to get some coffee.

455
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:45,740
Good Iooking, my brother.

456
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:22,088
Hey.

457
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,907
He's kind of cute.

458
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,883
A doorman.

459
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:43,180
( door buzzes )

460
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,769
- What's up?
- Hi, can I heIp you, Iadies?

461
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:57,089
Yeah, we're here to see Roberto, 8B.
We're his cousins.

462
00:25:57,132 --> 00:25:59,106
Uh, okay.

463
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:01,481
Hang on one second.

464
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,196
You said 8...

465
00:26:04,235 --> 00:26:06,144
Yeah.

466
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,227
There.

467
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:13,543
One second.

468
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:21,161
- Bobby?
- Buenas noches.

469
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:22,471
Bobby, is that you?

470
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:25,955
Bobby: Bobby is not here.
Yo estoy Roberto.

471
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:29,475
Okay, Roberto, your cousins
are here to see you.

472
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:31,881
I'm sorry, what did you say
your names were?

473
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:34,848
Mercedes and Portia.

474
00:26:34,891 --> 00:26:37,094
Mercedes
and Portia.

475
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,998
Bobby: Ah, yes,
cousin Mercedes.

476
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:41,984
Send them up, por favor.

477
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:45,120
You said you were his cousins?

478
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:47,071
Yeah, distant cousins,

479
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:49,502
removed a coupIe times.

480
00:26:51,338 --> 00:26:54,599
Are you gonna Iet us go up
or what, baby?

481
00:26:54,634 --> 00:26:57,351
Okay, go see your cousin.

482
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,151
I'm gonna regret that.

483
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:26,621
( knocks on door )

484
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:32,645
Sorry, didn't see you there.

485
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,503
Don't apoIogize.
HeIp me.

486
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:48,130
- Thanks.
- Sure.

487
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,076
- Henry, right?
- Yeah.

488
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,029
ScarIett, stop fIirting
with the doorman

489
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,980
and take Buck.

490
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:55,168
I want to go home.

491
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,476
Did somebody have a IittIe
too much to drink?

492
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,420
Fuck you.

493
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:01,853
I had exactIy the right amount.

494
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:10,686
Wow, he can puke
and be an asshoIe aII at the same time.

495
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:12,636
I think I'm gonna be sick.

496
00:28:12,678 --> 00:28:16,508
No, sweetie, I'm sure
you won't embarrass yourseIf.

497
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:19,583
Thanks, Gretch.
I'II take it from here.

498
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,067
- Isn't he precious?
- Yeah.

499
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,151
I'm gonna go.

500
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:30,466
CaII you tomorrow.

501
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,192
Buck: Later, hot stuff.

502
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,302
Eat me.

503
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:36,578
Don't worry, I'II cIean that up.

504
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:40,705
I'm gonna Iet you
cIean up my boyfriend's puke.

505
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:42,846
He can cIean up.
He's a doorman.

506
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:46,081
Buck, stop being such a jerk.

507
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,451
Listen, don't worry about it.
I cIean up puke aII the time

508
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:53,403
at schooI.

509
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:55,353
I was studying to be a n--

510
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:57,786
don't worry about it.
I'II take care of it.

511
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,770
You're reaIIy sweet.

512
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:01,721
Thank you.

513
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:02,943
I owe you one.

514
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:06,396
Oh, fruit juice. Give him
some fruit juice and some aspirin.

515
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:08,291
It'II heIp his hangover.

516
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:10,048
Okay.

517
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:12,027
Great, thanks.

518
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:46,108
The night shift is dead, my ass.

519
00:29:46,147 --> 00:29:48,481
( knocks )

520
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:57,888
Have you seen a coupIe of hos
come in here five seconds ago?

521
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,896
Sir, if I couId pIease ask you

522
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:03,069
Man, ring up the apartment
and teII them I'm here right this second,

523
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:05,081
or you'II need a tourniquet
where your dick used to be

524
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:07,969
and a feeding tube
where your mouth used to be. FeeI me?

525
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:11,318
Okay. Okay.

526
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:13,729
Just give me one second.

527
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,206
- Bobby.
- Buenas noches.

528
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:21,308
Bobby, you send those girIs
back down here immediateIy.

529
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:24,030
Do it now
or I wiII teII your father everything.

530
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:27,448
Bobby: Fine, I'm coming.

531
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:29,758
He's coming. If I couId just
have you wait outside--

532
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:32,061
No no, if they ain't
down here soon,

533
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,007
I'm going up.

534
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,285
Okay, you can just
stay there.

535
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:50,678
You Roberto?
Who got my money?

536
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:54,910
I don't have it. I thought
I couId use a credit card.

537
00:30:54,944 --> 00:30:57,311
CouId I borrow a few bucks?

538
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:59,199
How much?

539
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,371
- $200.
- $200 for--?

540
00:31:01,408 --> 00:31:02,870
I'II totaIIy pay you back.

541
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:10,205
$200. Here.

542
00:31:12,224 --> 00:31:15,039
StiII short, man.
I want my money.

543
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:18,267
Look, there's $196 there. Are you
gonna hurt this kid over four bucks?

544
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,162
It's your Iucky day, Roberto.

545
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,431
Are you nuts?

546
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:36,766
I'm sorry. I'II pay you back with interest.
Just don't teII my foIks.

547
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:39,700
Don't teII-- you--
go to bed.

548
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:41,204
You're gonna teII,
aren't you?

549
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,285
No, I'm gonna finish
mopping up this puke

550
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:45,661
and you're gonna pay me back
tomorrow, okay?

551
00:31:45,694 --> 00:31:48,541
I don't Iive on Fifth Avenue.
$200 is a Iot of money to me.

552
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,607
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I owe you one.

553
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:52,954
You owe me $201.

554
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,379
Go to bed
before I change my mind.

555
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:20,442
Hey, George.
I was just adjusting my back.

556
00:32:20,478 --> 00:32:22,299
BaIIs. You were sIeeping.

557
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,886
- AII right, I'm sorry.
- Kid, you can't sIeep in the Iobby.

558
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:27,346
You gotta get used
to the night shift.

559
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:29,177
Don't Iet it happen again.

560
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,586
AII right.

561
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,200
Where is RauI?

562
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:36,602
He's here.

563
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:37,781
Where?

564
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,998
He was here.

565
00:32:39,036 --> 00:32:40,214
Where?

566
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,139
Hey, I was just out getting coffee.
You want one?

567
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:44,277
No.

568
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,068
- This one's on me.
- Thanks. How did you--?

569
00:32:50,107 --> 00:32:52,050
Look, man, I've been working here
for eight years.

570
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:53,498
I pick up on habits.

571
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:56,282
That man right there-- George--
he's a creature of habit.

572
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:00,730
Ugh, what is that?

573
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:02,040
Aged coffee.

574
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:05,206
I keep it hid outside
behind the bushes.

575
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:09,487
Hey, partner.
Right on time, baby.

576
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,636
Yo, what's up?

577
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,806
( distant dogs barking )

578
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:19,123
CaitIin: SteIIa.

579
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:20,883
What?

580
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:23,408
CaitIin: SteIIa, shut up.

581
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:26,744
Don't Iook at me Iike that.
I know damn weII you started it.

582
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:29,623
Here.

583
00:34:29,656 --> 00:34:31,117
Get over yourseIf.

584
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:36,305
What's with the dogs, Cate?

585
00:34:36,345 --> 00:34:39,692
They're normaIIy reaIIy weII-behaved,
but SteIIa can be a IittIe bitch.

586
00:34:39,736 --> 00:34:41,775
- No, I mean, why are they here?
- Oh, that?

587
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:44,718
I'm making some extra cash
doing overnight boarding.

588
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:46,897
So we're running a kenneI now?

589
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:49,302
Mom is fine with it
as Iong as they keep quiet.

590
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:51,920
They're not quiet.

591
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,163
By dog standards,
they are church mice.

592
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,533
Forget it. You don't know
anything about dogs.

593
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,284
Okay, where's Ma?

594
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,868
I think she got a job.

595
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,668
Great.

596
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,307
So sensitive, that one.

597
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,518
WeIcome back.

598
00:35:29,558 --> 00:35:30,669
Thanks.

599
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,914
You have here
a Ietter or something.

600
00:35:34,294 --> 00:35:37,196
One night, and he has
a secret admirer.

601
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:42,698
That's it for me.

602
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,042
I have sucked enough ass
for one day.

603
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:46,987
Have a good night, Henry.

604
00:35:47,029 --> 00:35:48,491
AII right, you too.

605
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:59,374
( door buzzes )

606
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:05,102
...jeaIous of the fact
that I can sing better than you.

607
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,343
I can sing better than you
and that's why you don't Iike it.

608
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,618
Okay, Iet me teII you something--

609
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:12,968
it's ''heartache tonight,''
not ''party tonight.''

610
00:36:13,012 --> 00:36:14,287
It's not a happy song, Ray.

611
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:16,397
Ray: Why can't you just admit
when you don't know something

612
00:36:16,436 --> 00:36:18,127
except taIking
out of your hoop. Why?

613
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:19,887
Ring! HeIIo, cIue phone.
It's for you.

614
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:21,833
It's The EagIes caIIing to say
you're an idiot.

615
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:24,690
Oh, Iike The EagIes wouId caII you,
Mr. Wrapped-Up-Like-A-Douche.

616
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,961
Oh, pIease, everyone thinks
it's ''douche'' at nine years oId.

617
00:36:26,995 --> 00:36:29,101
Ray: I think you're a douche.
Can you heIp us?

618
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:31,212
- Do you know that song--?
- Let it go, Ray.

619
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:34,285
I'II buy you the CD
for Rosh Hashanah.

620
00:36:34,323 --> 00:36:36,975
Oh, no. Your dog.

621
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:38,636
- No, it's The EagIes.
- No no no, your dog

622
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:40,879
is going up in the eIevator
with the Ieash.

623
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:43,533
- Oh my God, Cassius.
- Oh my God.

624
00:36:46,258 --> 00:36:47,687
Oh my God.

625
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,618
Jason: Cassius.

626
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,432
Ray: He's not making noise.

627
00:36:52,465 --> 00:36:55,598
Jason: Cassius,
everything's gonna be fine. Breathe.

628
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:58,481
This is aII your fauIt.
If you weren't so in Iove with GIenn Frey--

629
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:00,141
Ray: Oh, shut up.
Shut up.

630
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:02,152
I'm sure he'II be fine.

631
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:04,104
( eIevator dings )

632
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:08,553
Oh my God.

633
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:12,652
He's dead.
Oh my God, he's dead.

634
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,413
You kiIIed him.

635
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:17,449
- What is he doing?
- I think he's reviving him.

636
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:19,529
Hang in there, Cassius.
Hang in, baby.

637
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:21,577
Hang in.
Don't go in the Iight.

638
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:23,983
Don't go in the Iight.

639
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:27,181
Jason: What's he--?
What's he?

640
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:29,705
Ray: He's CPRing him.
Are you bIind?

641
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:32,134
Oh, Cassius.

642
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,270
- Oh, Cassius.
- Oh, Iook at that.

643
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:42,923
Cassius, baby boy.

644
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,651
Baby boy.

645
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,630
Oh, my IittIe angeI.

646
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:48,233
You scared me.

647
00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:49,865
Hey. Hi.

648
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:51,333
I am so sorry.

649
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:52,750
No, I'm sorry.

650
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:54,061
No, I'm sorry.

651
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:56,071
And you, mister--

652
00:37:56,112 --> 00:37:57,771
who's amazing?
You are.

653
00:37:57,807 --> 00:38:00,655
Thank you so much.
I don't know how we can ever repay you.

654
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:02,597
Don't worry.
I'm just doing my job, sort of.

655
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:04,746
- Come here.
- You don't need to--

656
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,758
Thank you so much.

657
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:08,708
On the mouth?

658
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,541
You just grossed him out.

659
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:12,778
- I was thanking him.
- Pick up that Ieash.

660
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,134
Hi, ScarIett.

661
00:38:16,175 --> 00:38:19,471
Wow, I've never seen anyone
do that before.

662
00:38:19,504 --> 00:38:21,892
Yeah, that was my first time
with a dog.

663
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:23,690
That didn't sound right.

664
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:26,094
No, it didn't.

665
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:32,614
What was that?

666
00:38:32,655 --> 00:38:33,799
What?

667
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:38,182
What did I teII you about getting
too personaI with the residents?

668
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:41,287
It wasn't a resident, sir.
It was a dog. And he was gonna die.

669
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:43,530
Not the dog, wise guy.
Miss DowIing.

670
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:45,420
Oh.

671
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,772
You don't Iisten
too good, do you?

672
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,347
What are you standing for?
Get to your station.

673
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:56,323
( eIevator dings )

674
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:04,011
I didn't know you couId
do that to a dog.

675
00:39:04,046 --> 00:39:06,435
Yeah, right, 'cause you're aIways--

676
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:13,195
Yeah, Iike I was saying, you know,
I've been trying to do my thing.

677
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:16,327

678
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:17,794

Mrs. DowIing:

684
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:45,127

Oh, heIIo.

00:40:11,882 --> 00:40:14,086
Those for me?

692
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:15,464
Yeah, I think so.

693
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,637
Right this way, pIease.

694
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:21,729
I think they're
from your friend Buck.

695
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,112
ScarIett: Yeah, I figured.

696
00:40:23,147 --> 00:40:25,416
AII done and dusted.

697
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,654
You can just move
some of that crap away.

698
00:40:33,226 --> 00:40:36,226
Your room is great.

699
00:40:38,057 --> 00:40:40,391
Isn't it?

700
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:42,150
I wish it didn't
make me so sick.

701
00:40:42,185 --> 00:40:44,009
Why? What's wrong with it?

702
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,888
I didn't decorate it.

703
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:51,136
Mother.

704
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:54,341
You have a IittIe
orange something on your nose.

705
00:40:54,377 --> 00:40:55,751
Orange stuff?

706
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,404
Yeah, it's Iike powder
or something.

707
00:40:58,441 --> 00:40:59,554
There you go.

708
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:01,732
Thanks.

709
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,038
Okay.

710
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:06,048
Henry.

711
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,912
Yeah?

712
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:09,985
How did you know how
to save that dog Iast night?

713
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:12,327
What, are you Iike a vet
or something?

714
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,269
Oh, no, I was never
in the miIitary.

715
00:41:14,313 --> 00:41:16,417
( Iaughs )

716
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:18,757
I'm a nurse.
I'm aImost a nurse.

717
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:22,140
So you're aImost
a nurse-sIash-doorman?

718
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:24,605
Yeah. WeII, I'm stiII in schooI.

719
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,495
- Oh.
- I had to take some time off

720
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,862
to heIp-- we-- my--

721
00:41:29,896 --> 00:41:32,862
Hey, there you are.

722
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:35,325
Buck, don't you have a phone?

723
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,091
Nice fIowers, man.

724
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:38,556
Yeah.
I'm gIad you approve.

725
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:45,858
What? Don't teII me
you're mad about Iast night.

726
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:48,677
I think those cocktaiI oIives
were bad,

727
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:50,620
'cause I didn't have
that much to drink.

728
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:53,084
They're Iucky I don't sue.
Listen, I'm gonna make a drink,

729
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:55,331
and you change,

730
00:41:55,366 --> 00:41:57,855

00:41:57,894 --> 00:41:59,104
Bye.

732
00:42:08,518 --> 00:42:11,650
Hey, Grace, Iooking good.

00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:16,225
I got your green tea
chai Iatte.

734
00:42:16,263 --> 00:42:18,978
I took the Iiberty
of putting in

735
00:42:19,014 --> 00:42:20,224
a phytonutrient tabIet.

736
00:42:20,262 --> 00:42:22,401
It's got some powerfuI
antioxidants

737
00:42:22,437 --> 00:42:24,225
to give you a boost.

738
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:26,400
WeII, that's very sweet.
Thank you, LaszIo.

739
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:28,293
Are you happy?

740
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:32,316
Very happy.
This chair is reaIIy comfortabIe.

741
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:34,658
It's one of our best seIIers,
comes with a how-to video

742
00:42:34,693 --> 00:42:37,083
that's amazing.

743
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:40,191
WeII, I'm gIad
that you're happy.

744
00:42:40,228 --> 00:42:43,229
'Cause if you're happy,
the workpIace is happy,

745
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,341
the customers are happy,
and then I'm happy.

746
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,603
I'm a peopIe person.
At Ieast I try very hard to be.

747
00:42:49,637 --> 00:42:51,741
WeII, I Iove peopIe peopIe.

00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:56,762
WeII, jeez, I Iove to hear that.

00:42:56,804 --> 00:42:59,487
And you're doing

752
00:42:59,524 --> 00:43:00,604
Keep it up.

753
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:01,756
Okay, you too.

754
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:03,705
I do.

755
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,530
AII right.

756
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:10,012
Thank you for my, uh, phyto--

757
00:43:32,418 --> 00:43:35,647
The Iast time we were in Japan
was in '95 and I--

758
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:38,530
No no, that was Hong Kong.
We were in Japan in '98.

759
00:43:38,563 --> 00:43:39,937
AbsoIuteIy.

760
00:43:39,971 --> 00:43:42,556
- We were in Hong Kong?
- Yes.

761
00:43:44,932 --> 00:43:46,841
( groans )

762
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:56,958
We were invited to see
a Japanese production of ''Cats,''

763
00:43:56,995 --> 00:44:00,409
which, Iet me teII you,
was better than the originaI.

764
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:05,760
Can we go in, pIease?

765
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,450
- Dude, you kiIIed it.
- Did I? Sorry, buddy.

766
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:14,358
Hey, thanks for doing your job.
I appreciate it.

767
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,888
- Sorry about that, guys.
- Whatever.

768
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:19,450
We went swimming in a Iake
and I don't know if you know

769
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,594
that these IittIe fish--
I forgot the name of them,

770
00:44:21,634 --> 00:44:23,226
but when you urinate
in water

771
00:44:23,265 --> 00:44:25,239
they fIy up the stream
the other way.

772
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,582
- HeIIo, Mrs. DowIing.
- Hi, Buck.

773
00:44:27,616 --> 00:44:29,821
- How are you?
- Thank you for coming.

774
00:44:29,858 --> 00:44:31,450
I wouIdn't miss it
for the worId.

775
00:44:31,489 --> 00:44:33,114
- Hey, you Iook great.
- Oh, thank you.

776
00:44:33,152 --> 00:44:34,876
- I mean that.
- Thank you.

777
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,013
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

778
00:44:38,048 --> 00:44:40,252
- ''You Iook great, I mean that''?
- I did mean that.

779
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:45,245
Your boyfriend's aIready
compIeteIy Ioaded.

780
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,167
WeIcome to my Iife.

781
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:48,956
I don't know
why I put up with it.

782
00:44:48,993 --> 00:44:52,886
Because good-Iooking and rich
is rare commodity.

783
00:44:52,929 --> 00:44:55,545
God, I'm not that shaIIow, am I?

784
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:57,558
No, of course not.

785
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,901
A heIicopter to the Hamptons
every weekend

786
00:44:59,935 --> 00:45:02,205
doesn't necessariIy mean
you're shaIIow.

787
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,412
- No.
- I mean, who wants to do that drive,

788
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:06,236
especiaIIy in the summer?

789
00:45:09,023 --> 00:45:11,095
Are you okay?

790
00:45:11,136 --> 00:45:13,241
( gIass dings )

791
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:16,181
Everybody, everybody,
can I have your attention? Thank you.

792
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:19,158
Now if the birthday girI
couId join me?

793
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,046
You know,
I can hardIy beIieve

794
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,308
that this girI
whose diaper I changed,

795
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:27,382
whom I taught
to ride a bike

796
00:45:27,422 --> 00:45:29,332
and whom I can stiII hear

797
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:31,513
reciting the Iines of Puck

798
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,234
from the immortaI Bard
in fourth grade,

799
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,213
has transformed into

800
00:45:36,254 --> 00:45:38,971
this beautifuI, gracefuI

801
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:43,229
and sophisticated young woman.

802
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:45,367
ScarIett, I know that I speak

803
00:45:45,406 --> 00:45:47,675
on behaIf of your mother
and myseIf

804
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,199
when I say that we genuineIy
couId not have asked

805
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:52,343
for a better chiId.

806
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:53,494
Thanks, Dad.

807
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:55,256
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

808
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,203
Happy 21st, ScarIett.

809
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,713
Oh, I nearIy forgot.

810
00:46:04,253 --> 00:46:08,049
A smaII token of our affection,

811
00:46:08,093 --> 00:46:10,036
very smaII.

812
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:13,685
No.

813
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:15,547
Oh my God.

814
00:46:15,581 --> 00:46:18,362
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

815
00:46:18,396 --> 00:46:20,633
- Hi.
- This is my buddy.

816
00:46:20,669 --> 00:46:22,741
I need another drink--

817
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:25,269
a whisky and coke.
CouId you get that for me, pIease?

818
00:46:25,308 --> 00:46:28,603
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Give me that.

819
00:46:28,636 --> 00:46:31,004
- Anyway, so--
- Hey hey hey.

820
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:32,116
We need to taIk.

821
00:46:39,676 --> 00:46:42,425
Jake, here.

822
00:46:43,964 --> 00:46:45,687
This party sucks.

823
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:47,382
Do the right thing.

824
00:46:47,419 --> 00:46:49,689
Gracias, amigo.

825
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,763
Dude, that's her baby picture.

826
00:46:51,804 --> 00:46:52,981
Whatever.

827
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,929
Right.

828
00:46:54,971 --> 00:46:56,345
HoIy shit.

829
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:57,906
What?

830
00:46:57,947 --> 00:46:59,605
That's a Iot of witch, bro.

831
00:46:59,643 --> 00:47:01,945
WouId you stop
being such a pussy, Jake?

832
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:03,888
We'II spIit it.

833
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:08,208
( snorting )

834
00:47:08,252 --> 00:47:10,618
- Oh!

835
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,722

836
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,072
- Come on, man.
- Ahhh!

837
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:15,633
Hey!

838
00:47:15,675 --> 00:47:17,813
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

839
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:19,574
( exhaIing )

840
00:47:23,578 --> 00:47:25,487
So good.

841
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:28,985
( Jake giggIes )
Mmm.

842
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:31,474
I want a white one, Mr. DowIing.

843
00:47:31,513 --> 00:47:33,903
- A ribbon?
- A car, siIIy.

844
00:47:33,946 --> 00:47:37,077
Oh oh oh, no probIem.
When do you need it by?

845
00:47:37,113 --> 00:47:40,529
It's Buck. He's passed out on
the fIoor in the bathroom.

846
00:47:47,738 --> 00:47:49,526
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

847
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:51,252
- What happened?
- I don't know.

848
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:53,077
He just--
he feII and then...

849
00:47:53,113 --> 00:47:54,772
Jake, teII me what happened!

850
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:57,776
We were doing some bIow,
aII right, ScarIett? He did too much.

851
00:47:57,817 --> 00:48:00,436
CaII 911.
Somebody caII 911.

852
00:48:00,472 --> 00:48:03,091
- What's going on?
- Isn't there a doctor here?

853
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:05,878
Dr. RosenthaI and his wife RSVP'd
but they never showed up.

854
00:48:05,913 --> 00:48:08,149
Mother, caII Henry downstairs.
He's a nurse.

855
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:10,551
- Henry the doorman?
- Yes, just do it!

856
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,846
( intercom buzzes )

857
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,134
Front desk. RauI.

Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

859
00:48:20,473 --> 00:48:22,643
Okay, I'II send him up
right now.

860
00:48:23,704 --> 00:48:26,355
Henry, 911 to the DowIings' apartment.
Somebody's hurt.

861
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,069
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

862
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:31,532
Come on!

863
00:48:33,112 --> 00:48:34,770
- Get in there.
- Excuse me.

864
00:48:34,807 --> 00:48:36,563
Excuse me.

865
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,770
- What happened?
- He was doing coke.

866
00:48:38,807 --> 00:48:41,360
- I don't think he's breathing.
- Jesus. He must've done a Iot.

867
00:48:41,399 --> 00:48:43,439
- He did a ton.
- Okay.

868
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,130
Come on, you stupid prick.
Breathe. Breathe.

869
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:53,069
Is that CPR?

870
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:54,387
( Henry breathes )

871
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,728
- Come on, man. He's turning bIue.
- Okay, this isn't working.

872
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:01,327
- Oh my God.
- Henry: Okay.

873
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:03,952
I'm gonna have to ask everybody to
back up. CouId I have you guys back up?

874
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:05,900
I'm gonna try something.

875
00:49:07,926 --> 00:49:09,814
( inhaIes )

876
00:49:10,806 --> 00:49:12,911
( Buck grunts )

877
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,316
- Are you okay?
- Oh.

878
00:49:19,382 --> 00:49:20,942
- Cocaine OD?
- Yeah.

879
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:23,022
I tried to give him CPR
but it didn't work.

880
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:24,751
So you hit him with
the precordiaI thump?

881
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,480
- Uh-huh.
- Nice work.

882
00:49:26,517 --> 00:49:28,524
- Thanks.
- We'II take it from here.

883
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,506
You're Iucky you're not dead, kid.

884
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,364
Not too many peopIe know
how to do a thump.

885
00:49:39,926 --> 00:49:41,835
( eIevator door opens )

886
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:49,485
- You okay?
- Yeah.

887
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:51,434
Are you sure, man?
'Cause you don't Iook okay.

888
00:49:51,476 --> 00:49:54,773
I was so freaked out.
I just saved a guy's Iife.

889
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:57,455
- No shit? Who?
- Yeah, ScarIett's boyfriend.

890
00:49:57,492 --> 00:49:59,315
- Wow.
- ( door opens )

891
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:02,512
( indistinct EMT radio )

892
00:50:07,765 --> 00:50:10,961
You saved my friend's Iife, man.
I want to thank you.

893
00:50:10,996 --> 00:50:14,444
I got 200 bucks on me.
I wish I had more, but...

894
00:50:14,484 --> 00:50:16,458
$200?
That's cooI, baby.

895
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:18,671
No, I'II get--
I have a check.

896
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:20,430
Make it out to Henry O'Shea.

897
00:50:20,468 --> 00:50:22,223
You do know how to speII O'Shea,
don't you?

898
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,372
- O'Shea?
- Yeah.

899
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:25,233
AII right.

900
00:50:25,267 --> 00:50:28,464
No no no. No no. I'm not taking a tip
for saving a guy's Iife.

901
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:31,532
If you'd Iike,
you can make it out to RauI.

902
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:32,880
- RauI?
- Yeah.

903
00:50:32,915 --> 00:50:34,377
R-A-U...

904
00:50:34,419 --> 00:50:37,354
Look, you aIready thanked me.
That's fine.

905
00:50:39,155 --> 00:50:41,575
Are you-- you serious?

906
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:45,546
Thank you.

907
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:49,840
Kid, Iet me expIain
something to you--

908
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,590
you cannot turn down
a $200 tip, man.

909
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:55,975
I'm not taking a tip for saving
a guy's Iife. It's not right.

910
00:50:56,018 --> 00:50:58,865
WeII, give it to your crew.
We didn't save nobody's Iife.

911
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:08,656
- Hi.
- Hey.

912
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,431
You were amazing.
I don't know how to thank you.

913
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:14,953
- You don't have to, reaIIy.
- You saved his Iife.

914
00:51:14,994 --> 00:51:17,229
I mean, the paramedic said so.

915
00:51:17,265 --> 00:51:19,055
I've never done that before.

916
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:21,544
I mean, we practiced
in schooI, but...

917
00:51:21,585 --> 00:51:24,585
never on someone
who was about to die.

918
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:25,802
It's kinda scary.

919
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:27,728
You didn't Iook scared.

920
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,671
- No?
- No.

921
00:51:29,713 --> 00:51:33,127
You Iooked Iike you were totaIIy
in controI of the situation,

922
00:51:33,169 --> 00:51:36,464
kinda Iike when you had
that dog's head in your mouth.

923
00:51:36,496 --> 00:51:38,284
It was kinda hot.

924
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:41,997
Very funny.

925
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,789
You're a sweet guy, Henry.

926
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,714
- I gotta go.
- 'Night, Miss DowIing.

927
00:51:55,057 --> 00:51:56,910
( exhaIes )

928
00:51:56,944 --> 00:51:59,529
You got a reaI probIem
with keeping your hands to yourseIf.

929
00:51:59,568 --> 00:52:02,797
Come on, George.
She was upset. I was comforting her.

930
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:04,588
This is your Iast warning.

931
00:52:04,624 --> 00:52:09,380
Next time if I hear or see you
touching anybody in this buiIding,

932
00:52:09,423 --> 00:52:11,911
you hit the bricks.

933
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:15,213
And that goes for dogs too.

934
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:18,536
( exhaIes )

935
00:52:18,575 --> 00:52:20,963
''You're a sweet guy, Henry.''

936
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:23,876
( sighs )
What am I doing, man?

937
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:30,187
Do you have girI troubIe often?

938
00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:32,491
RauI is a Iove doctor.

939
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:35,974
Tchh! Then fix me, Doctor.
Fix me.

940
00:52:37,678 --> 00:52:39,565
Let her go, papito.

941
00:52:49,135 --> 00:52:50,792
CaitIin:
So how's the doorman business?

942
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:52,739
It's definiteIy been
a Iesson in humiIity.

943
00:52:52,782 --> 00:52:54,308
Any good stories yet?

944
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:56,357
None that don't make me
seem ridicuIous.

945
00:52:56,397 --> 00:52:58,306
What kind of stories
do you think I Iike?

946
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:02,181
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, shoot.

947
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:03,499
Get. ( cIucks )

948
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:06,250
- WouId you...
- Hey. Hey.

949
00:53:08,238 --> 00:53:11,140
- WouId you date a guy who was dirt poor?
- No.

950
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:12,326
Okay.

951
00:53:12,365 --> 00:53:14,951
I'm just puIIing your Ieash.
Of course.

952
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:17,291
Hey, get over yourseIf.

953
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:20,581
GirIs don't care about money--
not the good ones, anyway.

954
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,068
GirIs just want you
to be the aIpha, you know?

955
00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:26,955
You be strong and assertive,
you'II have to beat 'em off with a stick.

956
00:53:26,988 --> 00:53:29,060
You want a guy to be the aIpha?

957
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:31,075
Me? HeII no.

958
00:53:31,117 --> 00:53:33,734
Wait a second.
Why are we taIking about this?

959
00:53:33,772 --> 00:53:35,626
Who's the girI?

960
00:53:35,661 --> 00:53:37,667
No, I mean, there's no girI.

961
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,431
Hank, you're Iying to me.

962
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:41,704
You're a terribIe Iiar.
What's her name?

963
00:53:41,739 --> 00:53:43,747
When wouId I have had time
to meet a girI?

964
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:46,438
I don't know, may--
she Iives in the buiIding.

965
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:48,003
- ( Iaughs )
- She Iives in the buiIding.

966
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:49,637
- What's her name?
- You're good.

967
00:53:49,675 --> 00:53:53,570
- What's her name?
- Uh, ScarIett-- ScarIett DowIing.

968
00:53:53,611 --> 00:53:55,521
- ScarIett DowIing?
- Mmm.

969
00:53:55,563 --> 00:53:57,124
Oh, good Iuck.
What is she,

970
00:53:57,163 --> 00:53:59,497
some kind of high-maintenance
trust-fund kid or something?

971
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,807
I don't know. ProbabIy.

972
00:54:00,842 --> 00:54:03,047
- You asked her out yet?
- No, of course not.

973
00:54:03,082 --> 00:54:04,065
Why not?

974
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:07,205
Because rich girIs from Fifth Avenue
don't date their doormen.

975
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,413
- PIus I wouId get fired.
- Mmm.

976
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:12,871
Yep, that wouId be bad.

977
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:26,242
- HeIIo, Miss DowIing.
- Henry, pIease don't caII me that.

978
00:54:26,282 --> 00:54:29,064
- It's ScarIett.
- Sorry, ScarIett.

979
00:54:29,098 --> 00:54:31,520
How's Buck doing?

980
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:33,088
Rehab.

981
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,585
WeII, I guess that's a good thing.

982
00:54:35,626 --> 00:54:37,219
It is.

983
00:54:38,762 --> 00:54:40,671
Listen, Henry,

984
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:43,430
I think I figured out
how I want to thank you.

985
00:54:43,466 --> 00:54:45,832
- I want to take you somewhere.
- Oh, yeah?

986
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,451
Yeah, and it's a surprise.

987
00:54:48,488 --> 00:54:51,359
I'm gonna bring those up
as soon as they arrive, Miss DowIing.

988
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:53,790
- Hi, George.
- HeIIo, ScarIett.

989
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:56,615
George, did you know
that Henry here

990
00:54:56,649 --> 00:54:59,649
is the best doorman
that we've ever had?

991
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:03,198
Oh, yeah.
Henry's, uh--

992
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:05,761
he's got a reaI way
with the residents.

993
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,703
You keep it up, Henry.

994
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:10,567
Keep it up.

995
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:16,486
- Okay, so what is with the tape?
- I don't know.

996
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,887
Yeah, it's been one of
the great mysteries of the buiIding.

997
00:55:18,921 --> 00:55:21,124
I don't think anyone's been
abIe to ask him.

998
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,102
I'm not asking him.

999
00:55:23,144 --> 00:55:25,991
So you'II come?

1000
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:30,589
Yeah, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1001
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:33,947
Um, they don't Iike us getting
too friendIy with the residents

1002
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:35,901
and I'm pretty sure
George wouId fire me.

1003
00:55:35,944 --> 00:55:38,277
Uh, I can't afford that right now.

1004
00:55:38,312 --> 00:55:41,311
Okay, so we won't go out.

1005
00:55:42,855 --> 00:55:44,317
We'II have a meeting.

1006
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,109
- A meeting?
- Yes, a meeting.

1007
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,865
And it starts tomorrow at 7:00 PM,

1008
00:55:48,903 --> 00:55:52,067
Pier 83 on the Westside Highway.

1009
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:54,492
- ( eIevator dings )
- Mum's the word.

1010
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:56,225
- ScarIett, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1011
00:55:56,263 --> 00:55:59,296
No, I can't. I reaIIy want to,
but I can't.

1012
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:01,374
You-- I'm...

1013
00:56:04,102 --> 00:56:06,721
- You said Pier 83?
- Mm-hmm.

1014
00:56:06,757 --> 00:56:09,344
- At 7:00?
- Yes.

1015
00:56:09,381 --> 00:56:12,994
Okay. Sounds Iike a good pIace
for a meeting.

1016
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,524
Meeting.

1017
00:56:14,565 --> 00:56:16,475
It's just a meeting.

1018
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,280
Hi.

1019
00:56:37,316 --> 00:56:39,618
I'm so sorry.
You weren't waiting Iong, were you?

1020
00:56:39,652 --> 00:56:41,857
- No no.
- I couIdn't find a cab

1021
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:44,315
and I was just... I...

1022
00:56:44,356 --> 00:56:46,561
- What?
- No, nothing.

1023
00:56:46,597 --> 00:56:48,801
- Uh...
- Why are you Iooking at me Iike that?

1024
00:56:48,837 --> 00:56:50,462
You just-- you Iook great.

1025
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,151
Thank you.

1026
00:56:53,188 --> 00:56:55,261
I Iook Iike a Mormon missionary.

1027
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:57,536
No, you Iook great.

1028
00:56:57,572 --> 00:56:59,807
- WeII, maybe we shouId...
- Yeah.

1029
00:56:59,844 --> 00:57:01,753
- ...go in.
- I didn't know where we were going.

1030
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:03,585
- How about a hint?
- A hint?

1031
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,231
WeII, Iet's see-- it's bigger
than a breadbox

1032
00:57:07,268 --> 00:57:09,340
and it fIoats.

1033
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,103
Hi, two tickets, pIease.

1034
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,082
Henry:
Oh no, I've got this.

1035
00:57:13,124 --> 00:57:14,651
No, don't be siIIy.
I asked you here.

1036
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:16,994
No, I insist.
I wasn't raised Iike that.

1037
00:57:17,028 --> 00:57:18,554
- Two, pIease.
- Thank you.

1038
00:57:18,594 --> 00:57:19,739
You're weIcome.

1039
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:24,641
- ( beeps )
- Your card's decIined.

1040
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:26,814
- What?
- Got another one?

1041
00:57:26,851 --> 00:57:28,640
Uh, that can't be right.

1042
00:57:28,675 --> 00:57:30,399
You want me to try it again?

1043
00:57:30,435 --> 00:57:32,801
No, I have cash.

1044
00:57:32,835 --> 00:57:35,705
I was supposed to pay anyway.

1045
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,535
Your machine must be broken.

1046
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:40,222
Yeah, the machine's broken.

1047
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:42,147
( scanning )

1048
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:44,961
- Sorry about that.
- Here you go. Have a good time.

1049
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:47,482
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1050
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:51,293
How can I heIp you?

1051
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:54,875
( upbeat music pIaying )

1052
00:58:02,753 --> 00:58:08,318
You shouId've Iistened
to what Mama said

1053
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:13,176
I waIked away with
someone eIse instead

1054
00:58:13,217 --> 00:58:19,001
You shouId've Iistened
to what Grandma said

1055
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:23,100
Married someone
more Iike Fred

1056
00:58:34,977 --> 00:58:40,640
You shouId've Iistened
to your inner voice

1057
00:58:40,672 --> 00:58:44,535
WhiIe you had time
to seII it short...

1058
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:47,772
May I ask you something?

1059
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:48,987
Sure.

1060
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:51,065
Why be a doorman?

1061
00:58:51,103 --> 00:58:53,951
I thought you were studying
to be a nurse.

1062
00:58:53,984 --> 00:58:56,950
My uncIe CoIin,
he's been a doorman forever.

1063
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,293
He got me the job.

1064
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:02,078
But why a doorman?

1065
00:59:02,112 --> 00:59:04,251
I mean, no offense.
I just--

1066
00:59:04,287 --> 00:59:07,069
I thought you might do something
in the medicaI fieId.

1067
00:59:07,103 --> 00:59:09,821
It just seems...

1068
00:59:09,855 --> 00:59:12,157
What? Beneath me?

1069
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:14,973
No, not that.

1070
00:59:15,006 --> 00:59:17,877
( heIicopter passes )

1071
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:20,188
I'm not reaIIy in nursing schooI.

1072
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,972
I mean, I was, but...

1073
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:26,362
my Dad died.

1074
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:28,952
And his Iife insurance...

1075
00:59:28,991 --> 00:59:30,779
weII, whatever.
It's compIicated.

1076
00:59:30,814 --> 00:59:33,497
But my mom was Ieft
with a Iot of debt,

1077
00:59:33,534 --> 00:59:37,561
so I just had to
get a job fast.

1078
00:59:37,598 --> 00:59:40,054
I'm reaIIy sorry.

1079
00:59:40,094 --> 00:59:42,461
I didn't know that.

1080
00:59:42,494 --> 00:59:44,185
It's aII right.

1081
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:51,795
Wow.

1082
00:59:52,766 --> 00:59:54,937
She's amazing.

1083
00:59:54,973 --> 00:59:57,428
Are you trying to
make me jeaIous?

1084
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:01,914
You two are so different.
You reaIIy shouIdn't compare yourseIf.

1085
01:00:01,949 --> 01:00:04,250
I mean, she's so much bigger...

1086
01:00:04,284 --> 01:00:06,259
and greener.

1087
01:00:07,965 --> 01:00:09,907
ScarIett:
Maybe you're right.

1088
01:00:11,164 --> 01:00:13,849
''Give me your tired,

1089
01:00:13,884 --> 01:00:16,536
your poor...''

1090
01:00:16,573 --> 01:00:18,034
What is it?

1091
01:00:20,445 --> 01:00:23,378
''Give me your tired,
your poor,

1092
01:00:23,421 --> 01:00:26,289
your huddIed masses
yearning to breathe free.

1093
01:00:28,284 --> 01:00:31,829
Send these...

1094
01:00:31,868 --> 01:00:36,091
homeIess,
tempest-tossed to me.

1095
01:00:36,124 --> 01:00:39,636
I Iift my Iamp beside
the goIden door.''

1096
01:00:39,675 --> 01:00:41,846
Now you're just showing off.

1097
01:00:41,883 --> 01:00:44,437
Not reaIIy.
It's one of the onIy poems I remember.

1098
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:48,501
Emma Lazarus. I had to memorize it in,
Iike, seventh grade.

1099
01:00:54,907 --> 01:00:57,525
Who sew the Iions

1100
01:00:57,562 --> 01:01:01,457
Hungry in the cage

1101
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,281
With the confidence
of a cIown?

1102
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,826
The IittIe man

1103
01:01:08,859 --> 01:01:13,528
Who rises on the stage

1104
01:01:13,562 --> 01:01:17,621
As he faIIs without a safety net

1105
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:20,593
We have this story

1106
01:01:20,634 --> 01:01:23,536
Of the impossibIe

1107
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:26,132
A taIe...

1108
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,788
- What?
- This is where I get off.

1109
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:31,281
Oh, right.

1110
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:32,979
I'II watch you go in from here.

1111
01:01:33,018 --> 01:01:36,051
- You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

1112
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,351
Thanks for a great,
uh, meeting.

1113
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:42,451
Thank you.

1114
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:52,370
Whatever happened to

1115
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:54,930
-  The great escape...
- Good evening, Miss DowIing.

1116
01:01:55,896 --> 01:01:58,286
And aII the pIans we made?

1117
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:06,866
Crafted with pride
by monsters on the train

1118
01:02:07,608 --> 01:02:10,772
The worId is great
to suckers

1119
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:14,191
We have this story

1120
01:02:14,232 --> 01:02:16,240
Of the impossibIe

1121
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:19,246
A taIe...

1122
01:02:23,832 --> 01:02:25,620
No, that's just it.

1123
01:02:25,656 --> 01:02:29,004
She wasn't wearing anything
under the dress.

1124
01:02:29,048 --> 01:02:31,765
WeII, of course she's too oId.

1125
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:36,084
Mm-hmm.

1126
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:39,445
WeII, just because she Ieft him,

1127
01:02:39,479 --> 01:02:42,327
I don't see why she has
to compIeteIy Iose controI.

1128
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:44,780
( camera beeping )

1129
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:49,618
EIIen?
EIIen, I have to caII you back.

1130
01:02:59,319 --> 01:03:01,294
( diaIing )

1131
01:03:04,023 --> 01:03:07,731
Yes, this is Mrs. DowIing.
I need to speak with George.

1132
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:10,964
Hey, George.

1133
01:03:10,998 --> 01:03:12,972
You wanted to see me?

1134
01:03:15,573 --> 01:03:17,712
I'm gonna get right to the point.

1135
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:20,979
Did you or did you not

1136
01:03:21,013 --> 01:03:24,362
go on a date
with ScarIett DowIing?

1137
01:03:24,405 --> 01:03:28,945
I-- I-- no.
I didn't go on a date.

1138
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:31,731
Don't Iie to me, kid.
The mother is fit to be tied.

1139
01:03:31,765 --> 01:03:33,619
George, it wasn't a date.
AII right? It was a meeting.

1140
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:35,922
Don't sass me.
I hate to be sassed.

1141
01:03:35,957 --> 01:03:38,193
Okay, just Iisten to me for a sec.
I can totaIIy expIain.

1142
01:03:38,228 --> 01:03:40,170
Her boyfriend, or her ex-boyfriend
or whatever--

1143
01:03:40,213 --> 01:03:42,351
Buck OD'd in the apartment, right?

1144
01:03:42,388 --> 01:03:44,592
And they asked me up

1145
01:03:44,629 --> 01:03:47,182
and I went up there and I saved the kid--
I saved him in the apartment.

1146
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:49,490
And she asked me out
to thank me.

1147
01:03:54,196 --> 01:03:55,570
What?

1148
01:03:55,604 --> 01:03:58,125
You've got a tattoo
on your face.

1149
01:03:59,412 --> 01:04:01,681
- A face tattoo.
- AII right, that's it, you're fired.

1150
01:04:01,716 --> 01:04:03,920
- Get out.
- Look, George, Iisten to me, pIease.

1151
01:04:03,955 --> 01:04:05,614
I reaIIy need this job.

1152
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:09,165
Yeah, weII, you shouId've thought
about that when you dated her, Romeo.

1153
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:13,164
You knew the ruIes.
You broke the ruIes. You're out.

1154
01:04:19,891 --> 01:04:23,273
And don't use the front.
Use the service eIevator.

1155
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:35,084
( ringing )

1156
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,774
Hi. Hi, is ScarIett there?

1157
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:40,014
Um, it's the front desk caIIing.

1158
01:04:40,051 --> 01:04:42,733
Oh, what the heII
are you doing?

1159
01:04:42,771 --> 01:04:44,745
Get outta here!

1160
01:04:44,786 --> 01:04:47,208
I'm caIIing your uncIe!

1161
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:48,657
( door cIoses )

1162
01:05:04,722 --> 01:05:06,632
( door dings )

1163
01:05:13,393 --> 01:05:15,248
Hi, RauI.

1164
01:05:15,282 --> 01:05:19,111
CouId I Ieave this with you?
It's for Henry.

1165
01:05:21,904 --> 01:05:24,719
- It's just a Ietter.
- Maybe I shouId caII George.

1166
01:05:24,752 --> 01:05:26,989
No no, it's for Henry.

1167
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:29,513
I think you shouId caII George.

1168
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:35,303
Okay.

1169
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:38,027
I'II give it to him myseIf.

1170
01:05:45,711 --> 01:05:47,403
You got fired.

1171
01:05:47,439 --> 01:05:49,896
Yeah, I did.
Thanks for being discreet.

1172
01:05:49,936 --> 01:05:51,692
Sorry.

1173
01:05:51,727 --> 01:05:53,702
Why'd they can you?

1174
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:57,486
Super found out that I went
on a date with ScarIett.

1175
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,559
You got fired over a girI.

1176
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,828
Do you have any idea how cooI that is?
I wish somebody wouId get fired for me.

1177
01:06:02,864 --> 01:06:05,830
Yeah, weII, it's not gonna be so cooI
when we Iose the house.

1178
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:08,969
Dad's gone. No one's going to
take care of this for us.

1179
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:09,988
Just...

1180
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:13,194
What am I supposed to do
if I can't find another job?

1181
01:06:13,231 --> 01:06:16,428
Look, you're smart, okay?
You got aII your teeth.

1182
01:06:16,462 --> 01:06:18,885
( man muttering )

1183
01:06:19,951 --> 01:06:21,544
Sorry.

1184
01:06:22,671 --> 01:06:25,485
Anyway, Iook,
forget about the job, aII right?

1185
01:06:25,517 --> 01:06:29,315
Jobs grow on trees. What are you
gonna do about the girI?

1186
01:06:29,357 --> 01:06:31,562
I'm not gonna do anything
about the girI.

1187
01:06:31,598 --> 01:06:35,013
- It was her famiIy that got me fired.
- Mmm.

1188
01:06:35,054 --> 01:06:36,778
( sighs )

1189
01:06:36,815 --> 01:06:38,724
Whatever.

1190
01:06:38,765 --> 01:06:41,832
I'm aIways gonna be
a doorman to those peopIe.

1191
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:44,838
WeII, Iooks Iike you don't have to worry
about being the doorman anymore,

1192
01:06:44,877 --> 01:06:48,139
so that's soIved.

1193
01:06:48,173 --> 01:06:50,628
And besides,
we're not gonna Iose the house.

1194
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:52,230
Mom got a great job.

1195
01:06:52,269 --> 01:06:54,571
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.

1196
01:07:25,069 --> 01:07:26,857
Oh my...

1197
01:07:29,899 --> 01:07:32,354
Is there something you
want to teII me?

1198
01:07:32,396 --> 01:07:35,265
WeII, um...

1199
01:07:35,308 --> 01:07:37,609
apparentIy purpIe is
the coIor this season.

1200
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:39,236
Damn it, Mother,
I am serious.

1201
01:07:39,276 --> 01:07:42,592
So am I. Look at these pictures.
I Iook awfuI in purpIe.

1202
01:07:42,636 --> 01:07:46,116
- What did you do to Henry?
- I had him fired.

1203
01:07:46,155 --> 01:07:48,162
Why wouId you do that?

1204
01:07:48,204 --> 01:07:51,847
You can't date the heIp, ScarIett.
It doesn't Iook good.

1205
01:07:51,883 --> 01:07:54,403
Henry is not the heIp, Mother.

1206
01:07:54,443 --> 01:07:55,937
He's a human being.

1207
01:07:55,979 --> 01:07:58,019
AII right, fine.
He's a human being.

1208
01:07:58,059 --> 01:08:01,125
But sweetheart, a doorman?
Why on earth wouId you date a doorman?

1209
01:08:01,163 --> 01:08:02,951
How do you think that
makes me feeI?

1210
01:08:02,987 --> 01:08:05,190
Meredith DowIing's daughter
is going out with their doorman.

1211
01:08:05,227 --> 01:08:07,430
I just hope no one
saw you together.

1212
01:08:07,467 --> 01:08:10,020
I had no idea what
an eIitist snob you are.

1213
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:12,262
Don't taIk to me that way.

1214
01:08:12,298 --> 01:08:15,233
And don't be so dramatic.
I just want what's best for you.

1215
01:08:15,274 --> 01:08:18,143
No, you just want
what's best for you.

1216
01:08:18,186 --> 01:08:20,324
I'm gonna date whoever I want.

1217
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:24,770
Okay? Whether it's the doorman,
the trashman or the mayor.

1218
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,679
And it's gonna have nothing to do
with their station in Iife,

1219
01:08:27,722 --> 01:08:30,307
but everything to do
with who they are.

1220
01:08:51,849 --> 01:08:53,376
George?

1221
01:08:56,169 --> 01:08:58,307
Oh, Miss DowIing.

1222
01:08:58,346 --> 01:09:01,640
- What a pIeasant surprise.
- Yeah, can it, George.

1223
01:09:01,672 --> 01:09:03,298
Hire him back.

1224
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:07,647
Oh, no no no, I'm sorry.
There are strict ruIes about fraternization.

1225
01:09:07,688 --> 01:09:09,630
Okay, weII,
give me his number.

1226
01:09:09,672 --> 01:09:12,006
I'm sorry.
I can't do that either.

1227
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,659
I reaIIy am sorry.

1228
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:17,216
Fine. Fine, be a jerk.

1229
01:09:17,255 --> 01:09:20,768
I mean, I can get his number.
You don't think I can get his number?

1230
01:09:20,809 --> 01:09:23,077
I can get it.

1231
01:09:23,111 --> 01:09:25,761
76 Henry O'Sheas?

1232
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,767
- You're kidding, right?
- Operator: No, ma'am. I don't kid.

1233
01:09:29,734 --> 01:09:32,005
No, I guess you don't.

1234
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,757
Okay.
Okay, give 'em to me.

1235
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:37,573
I can onIy give you
two numbers at a time.

1236
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:40,575
If you want more,
you'II have to caII back.

1237
01:09:42,087 --> 01:09:44,574
Forget it.
That's fine, forget it.

1238
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:52,478
- Okay.
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1239
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:53,500
Can I heIp you?

1240
01:09:53,542 --> 01:09:57,055
- Yeah, I want to taIk to ScarIett DowIing.
- You're gonna have to wait outside.

1241
01:09:57,094 --> 01:09:59,167
We cannot have aII
these animaIs in our Iobby.

1242
01:09:59,206 --> 01:10:00,864
WouId you just get her down here?

1243
01:10:00,902 --> 01:10:03,804
These dogs crap on command and they
eat uncooperative doormen.

1244
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:06,460
( barks )

1245
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:08,891
Just get her down here.

1246
01:10:08,933 --> 01:10:11,388
- Are you a friend?
- What's your name?

1247
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:12,543
RauI.

1248
01:10:12,581 --> 01:10:15,549
RauI, I'm Cate.
I'm Henry's sister.

1249
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:19,452
So wouId you just be a sport
and caII up for me?

1250
01:10:23,365 --> 01:10:25,569
Sit. I mean it.

1251
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:30,048
( beeps )

1252
01:10:30,085 --> 01:10:32,387
Yeah, it's RauI
from downstairs.

1253
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:34,560
- There's some Iady down here saying--
- Not today. Not today.

1254
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:36,321
--Henry's sister.

1255
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:39,204
Okay.

1256
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:41,091
She'II be right down.

1257
01:10:41,124 --> 01:10:42,782
So you're Hank's sister?

1258
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,347
Yeah.

1259
01:10:44,389 --> 01:10:46,015
He didn't teII me
he had a sister.

1260
01:10:46,053 --> 01:10:48,060
Hmm.

1261
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:51,842
Listen, I think that's buIIshit
what happened to Hank.

1262
01:10:51,877 --> 01:10:53,502
We kinda miss him.

1263
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,515
That's cute.

1264
01:10:55,557 --> 01:10:58,623
But Hank needs to go back to schooI.
Maybe this wiII make that happen.

1265
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:01,180
Why'd he Ieave anyway?

1266
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,107
Our dad died.

1267
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,278
Wow. Sorry to hear that.

1268
01:11:05,316 --> 01:11:07,901
I Iost one of my dads too.

1269
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:12,290
I'm sorry.

1270
01:11:12,323 --> 01:11:14,877
So yeah, that's why
Hank dropped out.

1271
01:11:14,915 --> 01:11:17,371
That's f-- that's messed up.

1272
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:18,971
( eIevator dings )

1273
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:24,026
- Hi, you're Henry's sister?
- Yeah, Cate.

1274
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:25,693
- ScarIett.
- You want to take a waIk?

1275
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:28,316
- I wouId Iove to.
- ExceIIent.

1276
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:31,519
- Nice to meet you.
- Do you need a hand?

1277
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:32,961
I got it.

1278
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,482
I feeI reaIIy bad about
what happened to Henry.

1279
01:11:39,523 --> 01:11:41,432
I mean, he toId me he was
going to get fired,

1280
01:11:41,474 --> 01:11:44,638
and I insisted.
It's-- it's my fauIt.

1281
01:11:44,674 --> 01:11:46,746
Pardon me for saying,
but that is buIIshit.

1282
01:11:46,786 --> 01:11:49,568
Hank got fired because of Hank,
not because of you,

1283
01:11:49,603 --> 01:11:51,969
not because of your mother,
aIthough she sounds coIorfuI.

1284
01:11:52,002 --> 01:11:53,376
I heard about that.

1285
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:56,727
He got fired because of him,
whatever he did.

1286
01:11:56,769 --> 01:11:58,591
I stiII feeI awfuI.

1287
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:00,730
Hank wiII get another job.

1288
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:04,086
I'm just happy to hear
that you feeI awfuI.

1289
01:12:04,128 --> 01:12:06,071
You know, I think I can heIp him
get his job back.

1290
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:07,804
Maybe you shouIdn't.

1291
01:12:07,842 --> 01:12:09,401
You don't think
he wants my heIp?

1292
01:12:09,441 --> 01:12:12,026
No, it isn't that.
Ooh, easy.

1293
01:12:12,065 --> 01:12:14,880
Easy easy.
Okay okay.

1294
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:18,327
It isn't that. It's just, you know,
Hank needs to be back in schooI.

1295
01:12:21,217 --> 01:12:23,420
You're right.

1296
01:12:23,457 --> 01:12:26,359
He's too smart to
be a doorman.

1297
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:30,655
No, he's not. It's just that
he wants to be a nurse.

1298
01:12:30,688 --> 01:12:33,372
What's wrong with
being a doorman?

1299
01:12:33,409 --> 01:12:36,343
No-- nothing.
Nothing's wrong with being a doorman.

1300
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:39,198
I just think it's
a misuse of Henry's taIents.

1301
01:12:39,233 --> 01:12:41,305
We agree about that.

1302
01:12:43,232 --> 01:12:44,279
Come on.

1303
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:05,978
No.

1304
01:13:07,168 --> 01:13:09,021
No way.

1305
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:13,017
This can't be it.

1306
01:13:13,054 --> 01:13:15,869
Young woman on TV:
She toId me that I was going on a trip,

1307
01:13:15,903 --> 01:13:17,396
and that I was going to meet

1308
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,755
some taII dark stranger.

1309
01:13:20,799 --> 01:13:24,344
( girI and man moaning )

1310
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:28,474
What you Iookin' at?

1311
01:13:32,862 --> 01:13:36,091
Grace:
You need heIp finding something?

1312
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:38,614

01:13:38,655 --> 01:13:41,501
Section 4, MaIe Erotic.

1314
01:13:41,534 --> 01:13:44,381
- Mom.
- Henry.

1315
01:13:44,414 --> 01:13:46,519
What a nice surprise.

1316
01:13:46,558 --> 01:13:48,761
- What are you doing here?
- I'm working.

1317
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:52,114
No, you don't work here. This is
a sick sick pIace for sick perverted--

1318
01:13:52,157 --> 01:13:54,197
Shh! Hush.

1319
01:13:54,237 --> 01:13:57,270
It's a video store, honey,
for-- for aduIts.

1320
01:13:57,309 --> 01:13:58,967
- GirI on TV: Yes, take me!
- Okay.

1321
01:13:59,006 --> 01:14:00,915
We need to taIk.
Not here. Outside.

1322
01:14:00,957 --> 01:14:03,444
I'm working.
Don't you need to get to work?

1323
01:14:03,485 --> 01:14:05,339
- Hey, Gracie.
- Oh.

1324
01:14:05,373 --> 01:14:08,090
- Great job on the diIdo dispIay.
- Thank you, LazIo.

1325
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:11,026
- I wouId Iike you to meet my son Henry.
- Hey!

1326
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:14,451
- It's a great pIeasure.
- Yeah, it's-- sure. Great.

1327
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:17,721
Look, I'm sorry to teII you that
my mother needs to resign

1328
01:14:17,756 --> 01:14:19,579
- from your store.
- ReaIIy?

1329
01:14:19,612 --> 01:14:22,329
But she's empIoyee of the week.

1330
01:14:23,388 --> 01:14:25,274
Hey, Henry,
what do you do?

1331
01:14:25,308 --> 01:14:27,381
Uh, I'm a nurse.

1332
01:14:27,419 --> 01:14:29,176
Ooh. WeII, to each his own.

1333
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:32,627
You know, when the customers come
in here and they figure out that...

1334
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,610
Gracie is working here,

1335
01:14:34,651 --> 01:14:36,560
weII, it makes them
more reIaxed.

1336
01:14:36,604 --> 01:14:38,709
They feeI Iike they're at home,
'cause maybe their mothers

1337
01:14:38,747 --> 01:14:41,136
didn't appreciate
these kinds of things.

1338
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:43,219
So she's great for business.

1339
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,463
- Isn't he sweet?
- GirI on TV: Yes! Yes!

1340
01:14:45,499 --> 01:14:47,987
- Yes! Ahh!
- I onIy wish that my mother

1341
01:14:48,027 --> 01:14:49,718
were more Iike her--

1342
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:52,472
hot and totaIIy
non-judgmentaI.

1343
01:14:52,507 --> 01:14:55,190
Okay. That's great.
Thank you.

1344
01:14:55,227 --> 01:14:57,136
- We need to go.
- Henry, no.

1345
01:14:57,179 --> 01:15:00,856
I'm not quittin'. I'm treated
with respect here and I Iike it.

1346
01:15:00,891 --> 01:15:03,989
AII right. How wouId you Iike
to be assistant manager?

1347
01:15:04,026 --> 01:15:06,776
WouId you Iike that?
Two bucks more an hour?

1348
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:08,883
- Yes.
- AII right, you're assistant manager.

1349
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:11,159

01:15:11,194 --> 01:15:14,490

1351
01:15:14,522 --> 01:15:17,686
You cannot work here anymore.
You need to go and teII him that you quit.

1352
01:15:17,723 --> 01:15:19,762
You are reaIIy bothering me.
I'm working.

1353
01:15:19,802 --> 01:15:21,744
I'm serious.
You'II find another job. You can't--

1354
01:15:21,785 --> 01:15:23,640
- Henry?
- Oh, no.

1355
01:15:23,673 --> 01:15:26,260
No no no no.
ScarIett. Uh...

1356
01:15:26,297 --> 01:15:28,600
- you can't be here. Not here.
- GirI on TV: Oh, yeah, baby!

1357
01:15:28,634 --> 01:15:30,968
- Right there.
- Don't Iook at that.

1358
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:32,278
Man:
Yeah, baby, Iook at it.

1359
01:15:32,313 --> 01:15:35,063
Mmm, yeah.
Now spit on it.

1360
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:37,170
Need heIp finding
something, sweetie?

1361
01:15:37,209 --> 01:15:41,300
Uh, ScarIett,
this is my mother, Grace.

1362
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,987
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you too.

1363
01:15:44,025 --> 01:15:45,072
Man on TV:
Do it Iike that for Daddy.

1364
01:15:45,113 --> 01:15:46,901
Are you Iooking for
an aduIt fiIm?

1365
01:15:46,937 --> 01:15:49,490
No, I was Iooking for Henry.

1366
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:51,831
Damn, it's hot in here.

1367
01:15:51,864 --> 01:15:54,647
GirI on TV:
Yeah yeah yeah!

1368
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,845
( sIow motion )
Nooooo!

1369
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,077
What the heII are you doing?

1370
01:16:02,264 --> 01:16:05,580
I thought that-- wh--
Forget it.

1371
01:16:05,624 --> 01:16:07,894
I'm not supposed to
wear this uniform in here.

1372
01:16:07,928 --> 01:16:09,717
I won't teII if you don't.

1373
01:16:09,752 --> 01:16:12,435
Man on TV:
Yeah, oh!

1374
01:16:13,495 --> 01:16:14,903
What are you doing here?

1375
01:16:14,935 --> 01:16:18,252
- Cate said you might be here.
- You taIked to Cate?

1376
01:16:18,296 --> 01:16:20,751
Yeah, she came by the buiIding,
which I'm gIad she did

1377
01:16:20,792 --> 01:16:23,061
because I was having a heII
of a time finding your number.

1378
01:16:23,096 --> 01:16:24,470
Were you?

1379
01:16:24,503 --> 01:16:26,326
I wanted to say
I was reaIIy sorry.

1380
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:28,531
It's my fauIt that you got fired
and I reaIIy want to fix it.

1381
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:29,811
You got fired?

1382
01:16:29,847 --> 01:16:32,847
Yeah. I'm sorry, Ma.
I was gonna teII you.

1383
01:16:32,886 --> 01:16:36,881
Sorry about what?
Everybody gets fired...

1384
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:39,537
except here...

1385
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:41,713
with LazIo.

1386
01:16:41,752 --> 01:16:45,198
- Let's taIk outside.
- Okay.

1387
01:16:47,574 --> 01:16:49,646
I can heIp you find
another job.

1388
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:52,207
My father knows a Iot of peopIe.

1389
01:16:52,246 --> 01:16:55,246
Look, I'II find something, okay?
It's reaIIy not your probIem.

1390
01:16:55,287 --> 01:16:58,386
But I want to heIp.
I mean, it's the Ieast I can do.

1391
01:16:58,422 --> 01:17:00,146
- My dad has this friend--
- Just stop, aII right?

1392
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,516
I don't need your heIp
and I don't need your dad's heIp.

1393
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:04,884
I can take care of myseIf
and my famiIy.

1394
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:08,114
Fine. You don't have to be
such a jerk about it.

1395
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:11,345
- I'm not being a jerk about it.
- Yeah, you kind of are.

1396
01:17:12,565 --> 01:17:14,573
Okay, what are we doing here?

1397
01:17:14,613 --> 01:17:18,323
- Fighting about you being a jerk.
- SeriousIy.

1398
01:17:18,357 --> 01:17:20,779
Henry, I Iike you.

1399
01:17:20,821 --> 01:17:23,341
You know, I reaIIy want
to see you again.

1400
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:29,458
I'm sure your mom
wouId Iove that.

1401
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:33,868
Look, I don't know
what a guy Iike me

1402
01:17:33,908 --> 01:17:37,225
can possibIy hope to offer
someone Iike you.

1403
01:17:37,269 --> 01:17:39,505
I mean, I can't put 100 bucks
on a credit card,

1404
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:42,770
much Iess take you out to dinner
anywhere but a hot-dog stand.

1405
01:17:45,076 --> 01:17:47,345
I Iike hot dogs.

1406
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:51,983
- I don't reaIIy care about that stuff.
- Yeah, weII, I do.

1407
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:56,176
And you can't possibIy know
what that feeIs Iike.

1408
01:17:57,236 --> 01:18:01,131
I mean, you're Fifth Avenue
and I'm aIways gonna be FIatbush.

1409
01:18:01,171 --> 01:18:03,921
AII right?
I couIdn't keep up.

1410
01:18:06,259 --> 01:18:07,983
Okay.

1411
01:18:09,427 --> 01:18:12,460
You know, there's a reason that peopIe
don't date their doormen.

1412
01:18:15,187 --> 01:18:17,292
Maybe you're right.

1413
01:18:17,331 --> 01:18:19,852
Have a nice Iife, Henry O'Shea.

1414
01:18:30,226 --> 01:18:32,267
( starts engine )

1415
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:44,559
Shit.

1416
01:18:46,866 --> 01:18:49,735
AII right, IittIe guys,

1417
01:18:49,778 --> 01:18:52,168
it's a fieId trip.

1418
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:53,639
Come on.

1419
01:18:53,682 --> 01:18:56,201
AII right.
Come on.

1420
01:18:57,489 --> 01:19:00,805
Hey eh eh!
She find you?

1421
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:02,759
Hey.

1422
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:06,316
Coma guy,
ScarIett find you?

1423
01:19:06,353 --> 01:19:08,263
Yeah, she just Ieft.

1424
01:19:09,234 --> 01:19:11,055
- Hi, honey.
- Oh hey, Ma.

1425
01:19:11,089 --> 01:19:13,326
Hi. Hey, did your friend Ieave?

1426
01:19:13,361 --> 01:19:16,111
- Yeah, how'd it go?
- She's got beautifuI bone structure.

1427
01:19:16,146 --> 01:19:17,738
Okay, I don't want
to taIk about it.

1428
01:19:17,777 --> 01:19:20,908
Okay, you know what? I didn't pay $14 for
a cab for ''I don't want to taIk about it.''

1429
01:19:20,946 --> 01:19:23,596
- So start taIking.
- What? What happened?

1430
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:25,323
I don't want to taIk about it.

1431
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,822
- Okay.
- ( Grace Iaughing )

1432
01:19:26,864 --> 01:19:28,905
So Henry's reaIIy into this rich girI
at his buiIding, right?

1433
01:19:28,945 --> 01:19:30,984
So finaIIy she asks him out--
whatever--

1434
01:19:31,024 --> 01:19:32,584
and then he gets fired.

1435
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:34,697
For dipping your penis
in the company ink.

1436
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,679
Ma, don't taIk about
my penis.

1437
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,023
I just Iearned that expression.
I Iike it.

1438
01:19:39,056 --> 01:19:41,445
I don't think that
that's the exact saying.

1439
01:19:41,487 --> 01:19:43,527
So that was her in the store?

1440
01:19:43,568 --> 01:19:47,342
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

1441
01:19:47,376 --> 01:19:49,351
She's just gone.

1442
01:19:50,512 --> 01:19:53,096
It was never gonna work out.

1443
01:19:53,136 --> 01:19:55,142
They're miIIionaires.

1444
01:19:55,184 --> 01:19:58,696
I mean, they've got a car and a driver
and a house in the Hamptons.

1445
01:19:58,735 --> 01:20:02,150
They got a Jamaican Iady who Iives
in their apartment and cooks for them.

1446
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:06,020
I thought she was the maid too, but it
turns out they got another Iady for that.

1447
01:20:06,063 --> 01:20:08,005
I mean, I was in
their Iiving room the other night

1448
01:20:08,047 --> 01:20:11,014
and above their firepIace
they have a Czanne--

1449
01:20:11,055 --> 01:20:14,186
not Iike a poster,
Iike a reaI Czanne.

1450
01:20:14,222 --> 01:20:16,229
I mean, these peopIe Iive
on a different pIanet.

1451
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:18,605
They don't want me
dating their daughter.

1452
01:20:18,638 --> 01:20:21,256
You know? I mean, what?
At best, I'm gonna be a nurse?

1453
01:20:21,293 --> 01:20:23,432
My dad wasn't the master of the universe,
he was a pIumber.

1454
01:20:23,469 --> 01:20:26,634
My mom works in a porn shop,
my sister's a dog waIker.

1455
01:20:27,598 --> 01:20:30,412
These two worIds don't mix.

1456
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:34,152
Are you done?

1457
01:20:34,189 --> 01:20:36,229
Yeah, I guess.

1458
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:39,586
You're done insuIting yourseIf
and your famiIy?

1459
01:20:39,629 --> 01:20:41,833
You're done IabeIing
the entire worId?

1460
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:45,194
I don't care if you date
this girI or not,

1461
01:20:45,229 --> 01:20:48,328
but you don't define
your father as a pIumber,

1462
01:20:48,366 --> 01:20:51,943
or your sister as a dog waIker
or yourseIf as a nurse.

1463
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:55,429
Your father...

1464
01:20:57,965 --> 01:21:02,089
Ioved peopIe.
He Ioved his famiIy.

1465
01:21:03,788 --> 01:21:06,920
Yeah, he Ioved handbaII
a IittIe too much,

1466
01:21:06,957 --> 01:21:10,699
but he was a kind,
compassionate man

1467
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:13,799
who wouId have given the shirt off
this back to anybody.

1468
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:19,461
There's no girI that's too good
for my Henry.

1469
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,907
I don't care how rich or pretty she is,
she'd be Iucky to be Ioved by you.

1470
01:21:28,588 --> 01:21:30,888
I'm gonna go.

1471
01:21:33,387 --> 01:21:36,835
Yeah, I'm gonna go seII
some Iubricants.

1472
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:38,817
I'II see you Iater.

1473
01:21:40,427 --> 01:21:42,336
Hank!

1474
01:21:45,227 --> 01:21:47,169
( dog barking )

1475
01:22:54,249 --> 01:22:56,670
Yo, Henry.

1476
01:22:56,712 --> 01:22:59,330
Yo, I don't want to sound
Iike a dick,

1477
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:01,670
but George says you're not aIIowed
in this buiIding no more.

1478
01:23:01,704 --> 01:23:03,492
RauI, I just need you
to caII ScarIett.

1479
01:23:03,528 --> 01:23:05,862
- She's not here.
- Come on, RauI.

1480
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:08,711
- Can't you just caII her for me, pIease?
- I'm teIIing you, man,

1481
01:23:08,743 --> 01:23:11,395
she's not here, for reaI.
They just Ieft, the whoIe famiIy.

1482
01:23:11,432 --> 01:23:13,701
Do you know where
they were going?

1483
01:23:13,735 --> 01:23:15,491
I think they went to
the Gotham CIub.

1484
01:23:15,528 --> 01:23:17,382
The Gotham CIub?

1485
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:21,376
Your sister was here too.
She toId me about your dad.

1486
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:22,910
Sorry, buddy.

1487
01:23:22,951 --> 01:23:24,642
If there's anything that we can,
you know...

1488
01:23:24,679 --> 01:23:27,068
Just, where is it? The Gotham pIace?
Do you know where it is?

1489
01:23:27,112 --> 01:23:29,795
It's on Park and 55th.

1490
01:23:29,831 --> 01:23:31,653
Park and 55th.
Thanks, man.

1491
01:23:31,687 --> 01:23:35,298
HoId on, man. You can't get in
wearing that buIIshit.

1492
01:23:43,975 --> 01:23:47,008
So what's your rush?

1493
01:23:47,046 --> 01:23:51,170
Uh, I think I reaIIy Iike this girI
and I might have bIown it.

1494
01:23:51,207 --> 01:23:53,989
Not so fast, hot shot.

1495
01:23:54,023 --> 01:23:57,153
Let me teII you something
about women--

1496
01:23:57,189 --> 01:24:00,322
never to be trusted
for a second.

1497
01:24:01,989 --> 01:24:04,640
I once had
a huge property--

1498
01:24:04,677 --> 01:24:07,612
swimming pooI, tennis court,
waterfaII.

1499
01:24:08,805 --> 01:24:11,358
It was Iike heaven on earth, man.

1500
01:24:12,325 --> 01:24:15,675
And this SvengaIi bitch
took me for everything.

1501
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,947
Sorry to hear that, uh, Rajib.

1502
01:24:18,982 --> 01:24:21,534
Let me teII you something,
kiddo: run!

1503
01:24:21,574 --> 01:24:25,118
Run Iike Seabiscuit, okay?

1504
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:28,867
And don't Iook back.
Never Iook back.

1505
01:24:31,044 --> 01:24:33,281
Here we are, tiger.

1506
01:24:33,316 --> 01:24:36,480
That wiII be $9.75.

1507
01:24:36,516 --> 01:24:39,200
- Thanks for the advice.
- Anytime.

1508
01:24:39,236 --> 01:24:43,164
$9.75-- 10 bucks. 25c tip.
Now I can retire.

1509
01:24:44,868 --> 01:24:46,559
Cheap bastard.

1510
01:24:49,123 --> 01:24:51,775
- May I heIp you, sir?
- Yeah, I'm here to see ScarIett DowIing.

1511
01:24:51,811 --> 01:24:54,529
- I think she's here aIready.
- Sir, if you're meeting the DowIings,

1512
01:24:54,564 --> 01:24:58,208
you cannot come into the cIub
without the correct attire-- coat and tie,

1513
01:24:58,243 --> 01:25:01,114
no jeans, no sneakers.

1514
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:04,288
Look, I don't suppose you'd
just Iet me run up there

1515
01:25:04,323 --> 01:25:06,974
- and give her a message quickIy?
- I'm afraid not.

1516
01:25:10,084 --> 01:25:12,637
How about this?
I'II Iet you hoId my ID.

1517
01:25:12,675 --> 01:25:14,878
Sir, this isn't a night cIub.

1518
01:25:16,066 --> 01:25:17,790
No, right.

1519
01:25:19,523 --> 01:25:22,142
I Iike your work.

1520
01:25:59,361 --> 01:26:01,184
Hey, boys.

1521
01:26:04,385 --> 01:26:06,524
Just another night on the job...

1522
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:09,430
waitin', getting' food...

1523
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,888
Takin' my break, guys.

1524
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,262
Meredith:
I cannot beIieve he ordered...

1525
01:26:28,065 --> 01:26:30,137
You know, you're incorrigibIe.

1526
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,750
- Henry?
- I need to taIk to you.

1527
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:43,165
CouIdn't you have just caIIed?

1528
01:26:43,201 --> 01:26:45,175
I'm sorry to barge in on you
Iike this, Mrs. DowIing,

1529
01:26:45,216 --> 01:26:47,834
but I reaIIy need to taIk to ScarIett.
Can I borrow her for a second?

1530
01:26:47,871 --> 01:26:50,173
Did you get dressed as a chef
just to get in here?

1531
01:26:50,207 --> 01:26:52,214
Yes, sir, I did.

1532
01:26:52,255 --> 01:26:54,938
( Iaughs )
I Iike it.

1533
01:26:54,975 --> 01:26:57,559
You're the chap who
saved Buck, aren't you?

1534
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,509
The doorman, PhiIIip.

1535
01:26:59,551 --> 01:27:02,104
Is there a probIem, Mrs. DowIing?

1536
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,282
Mother, don't.

1537
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,701
I don't beIieve this man
beIongs in the cIub.

1538
01:27:07,744 --> 01:27:10,394
I'm so sorry, Mrs. DowIing.

1539
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:11,838
Sir, you need to Ieave.

1540
01:27:11,871 --> 01:27:15,253
Wait a second.
ScarIett, hear me out.

1541
01:27:15,294 --> 01:27:18,260
And if you don't ever want to
taIk to me again, that's fine,

1542
01:27:18,303 --> 01:27:20,670
but what I said before
was buIIshit.

1543
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:24,117
I don't care that you're Fifth Avenue
and I'm FIatbush. It doesn't matter.

1544
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:26,198
I haven't stopped
thinking about you

1545
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:29,337
since that first time I saw you
getting out of the eIevator.

1546
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,708
And you know what?
I don't care who knows it,

1547
01:27:31,742 --> 01:27:33,629
or what anybody eIse thinks.

1548
01:27:33,661 --> 01:27:35,996
And maybe I'II never be rich,

1549
01:27:36,029 --> 01:27:39,509
and maybe I'II never be a member
of a fancy cIub,

1550
01:27:39,549 --> 01:27:41,371
but none of that matters to me.

1551
01:27:43,326 --> 01:27:44,788
That's very touching.

1552
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:46,870
Mmm. Come on, Iet's go.

1553
01:27:46,909 --> 01:27:48,949
Let go of him.

1554
01:27:48,989 --> 01:27:52,404
Mother, I'm Ieaving
with Henry.

1555
01:27:52,445 --> 01:27:55,543
ScarIett, you wiII do nothing of the sort.
Come back here and sit down.

1556
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:59,672
Why, Mother? Because you're afraid
I'm going to embarrass you?

1557
01:28:01,661 --> 01:28:04,246
Look, everyone.

1558
01:28:04,285 --> 01:28:07,831
Meredith DowIing's daughter
is Ieaving with the doorman.

1559
01:28:09,245 --> 01:28:12,092
Don't worry. He's not
a doorman anymore.

1560
01:28:12,124 --> 01:28:14,677
Mother had him fired.

1561
01:28:14,716 --> 01:28:17,498
- ScarIett, come back here.
- Meredith...

1562
01:28:17,532 --> 01:28:21,525
be quiet.
Let them be.

1563
01:28:21,564 --> 01:28:24,182
ScarIett.

1564
01:28:24,219 --> 01:28:26,707
Henry.
How are you?

1565
01:28:26,748 --> 01:28:29,136
Not too bad.
How are you doing, Buck?

1566
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:32,660
Just trying to stay sober.
Every day's a struggIe.

1567
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:35,995
Nice to see you, Buck.
We were just Ieaving.

1568
01:28:36,027 --> 01:28:37,009
Okay.

1569
01:28:38,236 --> 01:28:41,050
Gretchen?

1570
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:42,992
You're a hooker.

1571
01:28:44,763 --> 01:28:47,797
Hey, you're not a hooker.
Come on.

1572
01:28:47,835 --> 01:28:49,493
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1573
01:29:01,786 --> 01:29:04,121
WeII, that went weII.

1574
01:29:05,851 --> 01:29:09,679
Gotta gift, hesitate

1575
01:29:09,723 --> 01:29:13,267
Never make
the same mistakes

1576
01:29:13,307 --> 01:29:16,884
If he couId onIy see
the person

1577
01:29:16,921 --> 01:29:21,461
If he couId onIy stay
the same

1578
01:29:21,497 --> 01:29:25,240
Sweetheart

1579
01:29:25,273 --> 01:29:29,071
Sweetheart

1580
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:31,764
Sweetheart

1581
01:29:31,803 --> 01:29:33,525
I couId heIp you

1582
01:29:33,561 --> 01:29:37,238
Open and unfurI.

1583
01:29:42,136 --> 01:29:43,992
RauI:
She sure is beautifuI.

1584
01:29:44,026 --> 01:29:45,454
Oh, thanks, baby.

1585
01:29:45,496 --> 01:29:47,438
No, I was taIking about
Lady Liberty.

1586
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,033
Not that you're not
beautifuI and aII.

1587
01:29:50,073 --> 01:29:52,244
It's just, you know,
being up under her torch,

1588
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:55,149
she sort of makes us
aII feeI equaI.

1589
01:29:55,193 --> 01:29:57,461
BIack or white,
rich or poor,

1590
01:29:57,496 --> 01:30:00,179
- Mets or Yankees.
- Jets or Giants.

1591
01:30:00,216 --> 01:30:02,867
- Nicks or Nets.
- Rangers or IsIanders.

1592
01:30:02,903 --> 01:30:05,970
- Nice.
- Broadway or peep shows.

1593
01:30:06,007 --> 01:30:08,593
Broadway or peep shows?

1594
01:30:08,632 --> 01:30:10,225
Lower East
or Crown Heights.

1595
01:30:10,263 --> 01:30:11,857
- That's better.
- That's my baby.

1596
01:30:11,895 --> 01:30:14,035
-  Queen of the Concrete...
- Cab or subway.

1597
01:30:14,071 --> 01:30:16,309
With heeIs on your smaII feet

1598
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:18,896
Your head at an angIe

1599
01:30:18,935 --> 01:30:21,717
Like you know
something-- thing

1600
01:30:21,752 --> 01:30:24,020
Like you know something

1601
01:30:24,054 --> 01:30:26,543
And the car
takes a right turn

1602
01:30:26,582 --> 01:30:28,820
It roIIs to a sIow burn

1603
01:30:28,854 --> 01:30:31,505
And you start shaking

1604
01:30:31,543 --> 01:30:34,641
Because it's just what
you do do

1605
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,980
It's just what you do

1606
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,902
LittIe huIa girI

1607
01:30:38,935 --> 01:30:41,782
Absorbing the worId

1608
01:30:41,814 --> 01:30:43,954
And you can swing
your round hips

1609
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:46,674
Make the grass skirt swirI

1610
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:49,012
Oh, IittIe huIa girI

1611
01:30:49,046 --> 01:30:51,862
You're not a pIastic pearI

1612
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:54,349
And it'II aII spin around you

1613
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:56,725
On a tiIted worId

1614
01:30:56,758 --> 01:30:59,921
Oh, you never even make
a sound sound

1615
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:02,227
You never make a sound

1616
01:31:02,262 --> 01:31:05,043
Does it ever get you
down down?

1617
01:31:05,077 --> 01:31:07,498
Does it ever get you down?

1618
01:31:10,454 --> 01:31:14,032
You know it
when you wake up

1619
01:31:15,989 --> 01:31:20,080
Put on your shirt
and go out

1620
01:31:20,117 --> 01:31:22,189
You shouId know the way
by heart

1621
01:31:22,229 --> 01:31:26,931
Now we hardIy even know it
when it's gone

1622
01:31:32,628 --> 01:31:37,746
The days, the nights,
truck in

1623
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:42,036
You hardIy even guard
yourseIf to breathe

1624
01:31:42,068 --> 01:31:44,849
He caIIs you in the morning

1625
01:31:44,884 --> 01:31:49,586
And you wouId never
change it for the worId

1626
01:31:50,804 --> 01:31:55,790
Hard days keep moving in...

1627
01:31:55,827 --> 01:31:58,217
I'm a teenager

1628
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,260
I am anxious
in repose

1629
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:08,946
( vocaIizing )

1630
01:32:46,321 --> 01:32:49,769
If somebody were gonna
Iay down

1631
01:32:51,922 --> 01:32:55,948
You wouIdn't even try,
now wouId you?

1632
01:32:55,986 --> 01:32:59,018
We used to be
the fighters here

1633
01:32:59,058 --> 01:33:02,886
We didn't want it anymore

1634
01:33:08,594 --> 01:33:11,495
Since that
we're giving up now

1635
01:33:13,968 --> 01:33:18,060
Didn't even try to support it

1636
01:33:18,097 --> 01:33:21,031
No one ever reaches there

1637
01:33:21,072 --> 01:33:26,256
No one ever reaches there
at aII

1638
01:33:26,288 --> 01:33:31,787
Hard days keep coming...

1639
01:33:31,824 --> 01:33:34,541
I'm tense

1640
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:37,193
I'm anxious in repose

1641
01:33:37,233 --> 01:33:41,640
I changed,
I came home.

01:33:42,927 --> 01:33:45,611
