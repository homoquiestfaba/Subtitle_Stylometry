1
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:22,763
Sebastian, Sebastian, stop pouting.

2
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:25,682
Sorry. I'm such a dope.

3
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:30,812
You are not a dope. 
 You're just misguided.

4
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:33,398
All the reports from your teachers 
 say the same thing:

5
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:38,904
"Sebastian would make an exceptional 
 student if only he would follow orders."

6
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,450
I can't believe you fed the school 
 hamster an overdose of Viagra.

7
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:46,703
I was testing the reproductive system 
 for a science experiment...

8
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:50,916
- and I wanted to see how big-- 
 - Enough! Enough!

9
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,460
Fortunately for you, 
 you are moving to a new town.

10
00:00:53,544 --> 00:00:57,381
You will have a chance to start anew. 
 It's time to shape up.

11
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:02,469
Speaking of shaping up, 
 how's Mrs. Freeman doing?

12
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:05,514
I see she's lost some weight.

13
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:07,683
- She looks good. 
 - Thank you.

14
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:10,352
I gotta tell ya, 
 it's a really great thing...

15
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:12,646
she's doing for the community, 
 censoring books and all.

16
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:15,107
That Catcher in the Rye novel 
 really screwed me up.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,237
Mrs. Freeman knows 
 what's best for young minds.

18
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,865
Which comes to my point.

19
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:26,243
I was wondering what you planned 
 on doing with my file?

20
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:28,495
- It's not very favorable and-- 
 - And...

21
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:32,958
you'd prefer if I didn't forward it 
 to your new school.

22
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,669
I've thought long and hard about it...

23
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,213
and I've decided to send it.

24
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:42,634
I mean, if you've really changed, 
 you'll rise above your past mistakes.

25
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:43,969
How can I ever thank you, sir?

26
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:47,931
Well, you have got a plane to catch, 
 and I have got some work to do.

27
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:52,811
So, you just remember, Sebastian:

28
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,234
The future is what you make of it.

29
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:04,156
The future is what I make of it. 
 The future is what I make of it.

30
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,617
Got it.

31
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,702
I'll never forget you, sir.

32
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:11,205
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

33
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:15,792
Pansy.

34
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:23,967
Ed Freeman.

35
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,428
What the fuck have you done tome, 
 you fucking asshole?

36
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,596
What's wrong, pumpkin?

37
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:30,057
Have you seen my picture 
 in the school yearbook?

38
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,101
Uh, yes, you look wonderful.

39
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:36,146
Wonderful? 
 I'm naked, you fucking idiot!

40
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:38,273
Fuck.

41
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:42,569
I'm the laughingstock of the community. 
 How could you have let this happen?

42
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:46,615
You weaselly little piece of shit! 
 You'll pay for this!

43
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:51,870
Ed, I hate you!

44
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:55,165
Asshole!

45
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:05,217
Don't think you are gonna get away 
 with this stunt.

46
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,053
- So where you heading? 
 - New York City.

47
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:10,931
- And I'm sending your file! 
 - For you.

48
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:13,684
- Thanks. 
 - You are finished!

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,438
Bye-bye.

50
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:07,738
- Sebastian Valmont? 
 - Yeah.

51
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:11,366
I'll take care of the driver, sir. 
 Your family's expecting you.

52
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,911
Which apartment?

53
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:16,580
The whole building, sir.

54
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:20,209
Of course. 
 What was I thinking?

55
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:25,047
Oh, my God!

56
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,733
Sebastian Valmont 
 to see you, sir.

57
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:48,403
- Ah, good to see you again, son. 
 - Good to see you, too, Dad.

58
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:51,615
How's your mother?

59
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:56,745
Oh, Dr. Rappaport thinks she's gonna 
 be in rehab for the long haul.

60
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:59,831
Thanks for taking me in. You know, 
 foster homes just aren't my thing.

61
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:01,750
Think nothing of it.

62
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,795
Man, you really hit 
 the mother lode this time, Pops.

63
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:10,217
Sebastian, I would like you to meet 
 the love of my life.

64
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:13,428
This is Tiffany.

65
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:16,265
Well, it's a pleasure 
 to finally meet you.

66
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:19,434
I see you have your father's 
 beautiful blue eyes.

67
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:21,311
Thank you.

68
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:25,524
My, what a precious little 
 kitty you have.

69
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,152
Would you like to pet her?

70
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:33,156
Some other time. 
 Sebastian, come meet Kathryn.

71
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,205
I've heard so much about you. 
 Welcome to the family.

72
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:47,754
I've always wanted a brother, but they 
 were sold out of them at Bloomingdale's.

73
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:51,300
- Is that a real Steinway? 
 - I wouldn't play anything else.

74
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:54,052
- May I? 
 - Be my guest.

75
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:56,013
Kathryn is an exquisite pianist, 
 Sebastian.

76
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,639
Really?

77
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,186
Cute.

78
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,035
I think it needs a tuning.

79
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,125
Mother, Sebastian must be famished. 
 Shouldn't we check on dinner?

80
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:27,920
I think that's a wonderful idea.

81
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:33,842
I'm so excited you'll be starting 
 Manchester with me tomorrow.

82
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:36,511
It's a wonderful institution...

83
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,680
- with wonderful teachers. 
 - Wonderful.

84
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:41,350
Kathryn is president 
 of the student body.

85
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,352
Let's not forget president 
 of the French Club.

86
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:47,314
I live for extracurricular activities.

87
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:50,484
Student body president? 
 I thought you were a sophomore.

88
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:54,363
I am. I believe one should not 
 be hampered in achieving one's goals...

89
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:57,783
simply by the paltriness 
 of one's years.

90
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:00,744
- You mean "dearth." 
 - Excuse me.

91
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:04,873
Well, paltriness 
 implies insignificance...

92
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:08,210
but really it's your lack of age 
 that shouldn't hamper you...

93
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:09,711
from achieving your goals.

94
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:13,173
Careful with those SAT words. 
 They can be deadly.

95
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:15,217
Thank you.

96
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,220
Isn't Kathryn just the best, son?

97
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:23,058
- Yeah, she's a real peach, Dad. 
 - I love you, Step daddy.

98
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:29,815
I'm a little tired from all the travel. 
 Do you mind if I turn in?

99
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:34,987
Not at all. I know you have 
 a big day ahead of you tomorrow.

100
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,531
I'll show you to your room.

101
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,160
Hey, you little asshole. 
 What do you think you're doing?

102
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:44,955
- I was not-- What? 
 - You hear me? Get down there!

103
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,081
Do not fuck with me.

104
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,208
So...

105
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:53,463
he outdoes you at piano, 
 he outdoes you at vocabulary.

106
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:55,465
I guess I overestimated you.

107
00:07:57,134 --> 00:08:00,178
And don't sulk. 
 It's a sign of weakness.

108
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,723
Yes, Mother.

109
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:08,896
No, everything's fine. 
 I was just checking up on you, Mom.

110
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:11,648
Look, I promised 
 I'd take care of you, right?

111
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:14,985
Well, I'm gonna talk to Dad 
 and get you into a better facility.

112
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,487
It's the least he can do.

113
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:21,491
I love you too.

114
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:35,047
- What the-- 
 - Let's get something straight!

115
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,967
I may not have fooled you, but I've got 
 a great thing going with the rentals.

116
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,345
I don't have a curfew, they never 
 bother me about my homework...

117
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:43,263
and I've got a five-figure allowance.

118
00:08:43,347 --> 00:08:47,935
No one-- and I mean no one-- is about 
 to threaten my cushy lifestyle...

119
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:50,437
especially not some 
 two-bit hick loser.

120
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,023
- But-- 
 - I don't wanna hear it.

121
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:55,943
Now, as for school, 
 you stay out of my face...

122
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:58,779
and we'll get along just fine, 
 but if you cross me once...

123
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:03,617
I'll bury your sorry ass, 
 understood?

124
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,037
All right. I'm glad we could have 
 this little discussion.

125
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:12,042
Hmm. Not bad.

126
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,771
- What's the matter? 
 - This collar's too tight.

127
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:36,858
Oh, I guess you're only used to wearing 
 mesh shirts where you come from.

128
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:42,197
More SAT vocabulary builders?

129
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:46,368
For your information, this happens 
 to be my orientation speech.

130
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:47,744
Who are you orienting?

131
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,664
Please, be more stupid.

132
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:53,625
I am the student body president.

133
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,087
Ivy League schools eat this 
 extracurricular crap up for supper.

134
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:00,549
You do know 
 what an Ivy League school is?

135
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:12,895
Stop!

136
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:18,442
Gordon Anderson-- 
 looking good.

137
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:23,572
Do me a favor. 
 Pretend you don't know me.

138
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:59,274
My God, you're beautiful.

139
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:04,738
- Excuse me? 
 - Oh, I said you were beautiful.

140
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,282
Thank you.

141
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:13,080
Excuse me, but what did you mean 
 by that remark?

142
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:16,750
- What remark? 
 - That I'm beautiful.

143
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,796
- Well, aren't you? 
 - Well, yeah.

144
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,049
I mean, no, no, but--

145
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:27,886
Never mind.

146
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,056
You're very strange.

147
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,059
I know.

148
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,064
Are you here to see 
 the headmaster?

149
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:42,651
Yeah. 
 I heard he's a total joke.

150
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:44,695
I wouldn't know.

151
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,198
The headmaster will see you now.

152
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:55,038
I must say that in all my years 
 in education...

153
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,666
I have never seen a file 
 quite like this.

154
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,753
4.0 GPA, president of several clubs...

155
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,798
all-star snowboarding 
 for your county...

156
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:08,427
as well as several glowing letters 
 from your teachers...

157
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,512
including your former principal.

158
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,473
We were very close, he and I, sir.

159
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:16,852
- Yes, it's most impressive. 
 - Thank you.

160
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:20,230
Perhaps a little too impressive.

161
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:23,358
Thank you.

162
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,821
That aside, I'm sure an enterprising 
 young man like yourself...

163
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:30,365
would be a welcome addition 
 here at Manchester.

164
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:34,161
- Thank you, sir. 
 - Come in.

165
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:41,877
You had a few grammaticals, 
 but nothing reprehensible.

166
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,962
Thank you, honey.

167
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:48,550
Sebastian, I'd like you to meet 
 my daughter, Danielle.

168
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:50,219
You're both in the same class.

169
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,804
You look familiar. 
 Have we met?

170
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:55,307
No, I don't think so.

171
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,392
Are you sure?

172
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,146
Must've been someone else. 
 Well, I'd better get going.

173
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,983
It was very nice meeting you, sir. 
 Ma'am.

174
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,780
- Good luck, Sebastian. 
 - Thank you, sir.

175
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:21,416
-Seems like a nice kid. Don't you think? 
 -We'll see.

176
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:27,381
With our almamater 
 we will grow

177
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:33,136
Hail to thee 
 O stars of pride

178
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,138
Hail to thee

179
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:39,643
Manchester

180
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:42,104
Be seated.

181
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:47,818
We will now hear from 
 your new student body president...

182
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,820
Kathryn Merteuil.

183
00:13:55,409 --> 00:14:00,372
Fellow students, faculty, 
 administrators and custodians...

184
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:05,460
I would personally like to welcome 
 each and every one of you...

185
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:09,423
to what I think will be 
 Manchester's proudest year.

186
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:12,050
- She is such an inspiration. 
 - I consider...

187
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:14,136
each and every one of you...

188
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:17,306
members of my Manchester Prep family.

189
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,644
With that said, I feel it is 
 our responsibility to...

190
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:26,481
reach out and accept 
 all new students...

191
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:28,984
as members of--

192
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:33,155
And accept all new students as--

193
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,368
- Settle down, people. 
 - Please.

194
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,497
As I was saying, I consider 
 each and every one of you...

195
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,875
members of my Manchester Prep--

196
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:49,296
- Are you all right? 
 - Sorry. It happens when I get nervous.

197
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,298
Guess I just need a bubble gum fix.

198
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:55,761
Keep going. 
 You're doing great.

199
00:14:55,844 --> 00:15:00,933
Thanks. Once again, 
 as I was saying...

200
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:06,021
I consider each and every one 
 of you members...

201
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:08,440
of my Manchester Prep family.

202
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:12,486
With that said, I feel that it is 
 our responsibility to reach out...

203
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,655
and accept all new students--

204
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:18,867
Somebody! 
 Somebody do something!

205
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,087
Somebody call 91 1 or something.

206
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,089
Good going, Danielle.

207
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,523
Bravo!

208
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,861
Terrific.

209
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:08,083
Right. Sparing me 
 the Cliff Notes synopsis....

210
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,878
who can tell me what this means?

211
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,631
Mr. Winkler.

212
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,758
Jekyll was a doctor...

213
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,553
and he developed this potion 
 that transformed into...

214
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:22,764
Edward Hyde, his evil side.

215
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,810
My gosh, did that answer suck.

216
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:30,772
Now come on, 
 I know you've got it in you.

217
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:34,943
What themes can be discussed here?

218
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,403
Miss Sherman.

219
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:40,115
I think Stevenson is talking 
 about the duality of man.

220
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:42,492
Man has both good and evil in him.

221
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:46,538
If man cannot suppress his evil 
 instincts, he is inevitably doomed.

222
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:50,292
- Wrong! 
 - Care to elaborate on that?

223
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:52,961
Nowhere in the novel does Stevenson 
 mention good over evil.

224
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,005
In fact, it's just the opposite.

225
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,841
Jekyll loved Hyde so much 
 that he protected him from the world.

226
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,093
He protected Hyde 
 so he wouldn't hurt people.

227
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:02,804
Please. 
 He loved hurting people.

228
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,849
- Then why does Jekyll kill himself? 
 - Where does it say that in the book?

229
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,937
- The end! Mr. Utterson found his body. 
 - Utterson was idiotic.

230
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,814
- Your point is idiotic. 
 - All right, all right.

231
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:15,359
Break it up, you two.

232
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,611
Wow! 
 Am I losing my mind...

233
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:20,405
or did we just witness an intellectual 
 debate in this classroom?

234
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:25,327
Although I disagree 
 with your conclusions, Mr. Valmont...

235
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,995
I do appreciate 
 your warped point of view.

236
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,997
As for you, Miss Sherman...

237
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,668
I think you could be a little more 
 tolerant of other people's opinions.

238
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:38,674
Hey, fellas, welcome back. 
 Hey, Rene, good to see you.

239
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:42,302
Assistant Headmaster Mueller!

240
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:52,813
Steve.

241
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:56,024
I thought I told you 
 not to call me by my first name.

242
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,861
- We need to talk. 
 - Later. I'm busy right now.

243
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:05,284
- Stop that. 
 - I said, we need to talk.

244
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,452
What is it?

245
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:12,791
Do you see something wrong? 
 I have gym.

246
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:16,587
You know I loathe gym. 
 We Merteuils do not like to perspire.

247
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,924
What is this "we Merteuils" nonsense? 
 You're a student. Try acting like one.

248
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:23,594
- Excuse me? 
 - Look, Kathryn, rules are rules.

249
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:27,097
- I'm sorry, but you're going to gym. 
 - I understand.

250
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:33,437
- You do? 
 - Yes. But it's a bit strange...

251
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:38,108
'cause isn't it against the rules for 
 someone of your age to seduce a minor...

252
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:40,861
like you did to me 
 this summer in the Hamptons?

253
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:45,866
Now you know that's not entirely true. 
 It was you who seduced me.

254
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:48,368
You know, you're right.

255
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:50,662
It was me who seduced you.

256
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,332
But then again, 
 who will the school board believe?

257
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:55,626
It's my word against yours.

258
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:59,463
Think about it, Steve. Something 
 like this could ruin your career...

259
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:02,049
not to mention your marriage.

260
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:07,512
But I guess if you can bend 
 the rules a little, then so can I.

261
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,395
- I'll see what I can do. 
 - You're the best.

262
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:04,945
This meeting of the Manchester Tribunal 
 will now come to order.

263
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,947
- Kathryn Merteuil presiding. 
 - Thank you, Blaine.

264
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:11,952
Fellow students 
 of affluence and popularity...

265
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:15,747
I welcome you to this year's first 
 meeting of the Manchester Tribunal.

266
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:18,792
As your new leader, 
 I promise to do my best...

267
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:23,255
to weed out the geeks, 
 losers and underprivileged...

268
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:26,925
and toss their fat asses 
 out of our school.

269
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,149
-Here's the latest shipment, Mrs. Gagin. 
 -Thank you.

270
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:45,152
Could you re-shelf these for me? 
 Thanks.

271
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,677
- My God! A cartoon cock? 
 - Hi.

272
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:17,476
- Are you all right? 
 - You scared me to death.

273
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:23,732
- You dropped this. 
 - I didn't drop it.

274
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,777
Yes, you did, 
 but it's all right.

275
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,779
Sexual curiosity is 
 nothing to be ashamed of.

276
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:34,201
I'm not ashamed, and I have 
 a very healthy sexual curiosity.

277
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:36,411
Really?

278
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,873
- So what are you doing here? 
 - I work here.

279
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:43,543
Do you think you can take a 1 5-minute 
 break and join me for a cup of coffee?

280
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:47,089
I'd love to, but unfortunately 
 I have a lot of work to do around here.

281
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:52,928
Mrs. Gagin, do you mind if Danielle 
 joins me for a coffee break?

282
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,598
Please, go right ahead. 
 There's nothing to do right now.

283
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,477
- Thank you. 
 - You don't quit, do you?

284
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,939
Whatever happened to "be nice 
 to the new kid in school"?

285
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:12,072
- Fifteen minutes. 
 - Go.

286
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,785
Next.

287
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:22,583
Michael Keen, freshman. 
 Former BMOC of his junior high school.

288
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:26,003
Don't let his bad acne dissuade you, 
 though. His father owns the Coliseum.

289
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,302
Let's get him a facial and see if he can 
 score front-row tickets to Hole. Next.

290
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:39,016
Sebastian Valmont, sophomore. 
 Son of Edward and Corrine.

291
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,392
- Go on. 
 - I can't.

292
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:44,146
He's a transfer student, and I don't 
 have any more information on him yet.

293
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:47,524
Don't you know anything else about him? 
 He is your stepbrother.

294
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:50,652
I've only known him for a day. 
 He's a total loser.

295
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:52,738
I mean, he shops at the Gap.

296
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:56,241
Stay on him and see 
 what you can find out.

297
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:57,784
- Will do. 
 - Next.

298
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,080
Cherie Clayman, freshman.

299
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:07,336
Daughter of Hubert and Bunny. 
 Annual family income--

300
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:08,962
Well?

301
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:11,006
$850 million.

302
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:15,511
- She's richer than Kathryn. 
 - I heard that.

303
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,307
She has a GPA of 1 .3, 
 and not only is she a virgin...

304
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,142
but she never even kissed a boy before.

305
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:24,811
Okay, this girl is 
 a walking Teletubby...

306
00:23:24,895 --> 00:23:27,522
just begging to be made 
 an example of.

307
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,984
I think I'll oversee 
 this one personally.

308
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:34,947
When I get through with her, she will be 
 the premiere slut at Manchester Prep.

309
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:43,705
Next order of business: grievances. 
 Yes, Lauren?

310
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,669
Well, it appears we're having a bit 
 of trouble with the new school chef.

311
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:51,713
Mr. Washington seems to think 
 that sushi...

312
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:55,384
is an inappropriate meal 
 for growing girls and boys.

313
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,096
All those in favor of sending 
 Mr. Washington...

314
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,223
back to his hot dog stand, say aye.

315
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,100
- Aye! 
 - Aye.

316
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:07,688
Okay, bye-bye, Mr. Washington. 
 Hello, Mr. Yakamoto.

317
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:17,614
So, what's a nice girl like you doing 
 at a snobbish school like Manchester?

318
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:22,452
It's called free tuition. 
 Besides, it's not as bad as it seems.

319
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:26,206
My dad took over the place 
 a year after my mom passed away.

320
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,624
I'm sorry.

321
00:24:29,793 --> 00:24:31,211
Your turn.

322
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:36,925
Okay. Folks split up ten years ago. 
 Mom has a drug problem.

323
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:40,846
And everyone thought it would be best 
 if I moved in with my dad.

324
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,681
You get along with him?

325
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:45,851
I don't really know him. 
 He's on his fourth marriage.

326
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:48,103
- To Kathryn's mom? 
 - Yeah.

327
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:55,402
I know this is rude, but what's it like 
 growing up with all that money?

328
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:58,113
Well, you know, 
 I'm only one day into it.

329
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:02,242
Sorry to disappoint you, my dear, 
 but Richie Rich I'm not.

330
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:05,579
And I thought I was 
 the only one at Manchester.

331
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:10,834
You ever get the feeling 
 you're being watched?

332
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,669
- Yours? 
 - Hers.

333
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:19,801
There you are, silly goose. 
 I've been looking all over for you.

334
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:23,472
Hi, Danielle. 
 How's the used bookstore?

335
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,355
- Don't let her get to you. 
 - She doesn't.

336
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:35,859
Maybe it makes me uncool, but I don't 
 care what your stepsister thinks of me.

337
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,820
Actually, I think 
 that makes you very cool.

338
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:44,159
Well, I'd better get going. I don't 
 want her to make me hitch a ride home.

339
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:47,788
- Thanks for coffee. 
 - Yeah. I'll call you later.

340
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:50,207
- But you don't have my number. 
 - Don't underestimate me.

341
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,710
Don't underestimate Kathryn.

342
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,213
- Let's go. 
 - See you.

343
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,048
Bye.

344
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,723
Nice first day, retard?

345
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:10,227
It was great! This uptight bitch 
 got gum stuck in her hair.

346
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,353
Touch?.

347
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,820
Hi.

348
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:23,907
Cherie, it's Kathryn, from school. 
 No, I don't hate you.

349
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:26,702
As a matter of fact, I was just 
 appointed your big sister.

350
00:26:26,743 --> 00:26:30,330
Can you come out tonight? 
 It's a school event. Great!

351
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:33,166
I'll pick you up at 8:00. 
 See you, sweetie.

352
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,794
You're going out with the girl 
 who spit gum in your hair?

353
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:39,131
Keep your friends close 
 and your enemies closer.

354
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:43,802
Come on, Kathryn. She's just a freshman. 
 Pick on someone your own size.

355
00:26:43,886 --> 00:26:47,055
Like you? 
 In due time.

356
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,644
So, you have a thing 
 for boring virgins.

357
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,564
Danielle is a virgin, you know?

358
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:58,692
Careful, Kathryn. 
 I'm better at this than you.

359
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:02,404
Ooh. 
 You actually have a backbone.

360
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:06,575
- Don't push me, Kathryn. 
 - Any time you want to start a war--

361
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,244
I'll keep it under consideration.

362
00:27:20,964 --> 00:27:22,925
36:1 5. Yeah!

363
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,265
Good evening, Master Sebastian. 
 And how was your evening jaunt?

364
00:27:30,307 --> 00:27:32,809
Not bad, Henry. Not bad at all. 
 Where are the folks?

365
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:35,103
Dinner with a sheik. 
 Cook has your meal ready.

366
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:38,565
Will you be showering 
 before or after dinner, sir?

367
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:40,234
- I hadn't really thought about it. 
 - Very well.

368
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:43,946
Anything I can do to make your evening 
 more relaxing, just let me know.

369
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:45,948
Thanks, Henry.

370
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,795
This way, sir.

371
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:05,425
Please make yourself comfortable. 
 G?nter has prepared sweetbread mousse.

372
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:18,105
It's like dinner at the Adams Family.

373
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:28,699
Guys. Hello? Anyone?

374
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:32,536
Yes, sir. 
 Is everything all right?

375
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:35,789
Henry, I think I'll get something later, 
 go out or something.

376
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:38,333
Very well, sir. If you need the car, 
 just let Frederick know.

377
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,877
Sure.

378
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:52,472
No, it's not like that at all.

379
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:55,934
- Well, of course, I miss you. 
 - You do?

380
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:58,770
We'll get together very soon. 
 I promise.

381
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:02,065
- Okay. 
 - What are you wearing?

382
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:06,486
- Just-- Edward! 
 - I have to go.

383
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,364
- I didn't hear you knock. 
 - I didn't.

384
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:12,492
- That was my accountant on the phone. 
 - Wow!

385
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,621
You guys must have 
 a really tight relationship.

386
00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:20,542
Now, look, son, 
 don't make me regret taking you in.

387
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:25,422
Well, I see that old habits die hard, 
 or, in your case, don't die at all.

388
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:30,636
I'm your father, and I demand to be 
 treated with some respect.

389
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:35,474
- A man has needs-- 
 - Look, Dad, spare me the melodrama.

390
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:37,226
But, a word of advice?

391
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:41,855
You got a pretty good thing going here. 
 I wouldn't screw it up, if I were you.

392
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:51,698
You know, Sebastian, I really like 
 these father-son chats.

393
00:29:51,782 --> 00:29:53,992
You're a real role model.

394
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:04,670
Would you sit the fuck down!

395
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:18,684
Thanks, Moose.

396
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:20,185
Shut up, losers.

397
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:45,502
One mineral water, one iced tea.

398
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:49,923
This sure doesn't taste 
 like an iced tea.

399
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:52,926
It's from Long Island. 
 Here, have another.

400
00:31:05,856 --> 00:31:09,568
- What's the latest, Kathryn? 
 - Me, as usual.

401
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:11,236
Court, I'd like you to meet 
 Cherie Clayman.

402
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,073
How's it going, Cherie?

403
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:17,492
Excuse me.

404
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,578
I think we should adjourn 
 to the ladies' room.

405
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:22,247
- But I don't have to go. 
 - I do.

406
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:25,417
So what do you need my help for? 
 Ow!

407
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:27,169
- Want some more? 
 - No.

408
00:31:28,045 --> 00:31:29,504
- Back in a flash. 
 - Right.

409
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:37,346
- So how do you know he likes me? 
 - I can see it in his eyes.

410
00:31:38,472 --> 00:31:41,642
If you say so. 
 So what do I do about it?

411
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:44,144
You're gonna have to let him fuck you.

412
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:49,441
But I've never even been 
 to first base with a guy.

413
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:52,277
Well, so we'll start with first base 
 and then we'll move on.

414
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:57,574
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

415
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:07,417
- Ready? 
 - Ready.

416
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:16,468
- That was easy. 
 - Okay, we're gonna try this again.

417
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:18,470
This time I want you 
 to close your eyes.

418
00:32:18,554 --> 00:32:20,639
Court's gonna stick his tongue 
 in your mouth.

419
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:24,434
I want you to massage his tongue 
 with yours. Okay?

420
00:32:24,518 --> 00:32:26,728
Ready.

421
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:33,110
You idiot! 
 These are $300 pants.

422
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,028
I'm sorry.

423
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:37,739
Oh, God! 
 Stupid bitch.

424
00:32:39,616 --> 00:32:41,743
He hates me.

425
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:47,082
There, there. Shh.

426
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:59,428
- Hello? 
 - I told you not to underestimate me.

427
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:02,222
- You're unbelievable. 
 - Thank you.

428
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:09,229
Oh, come on. The TV series MASH 
 was way better than the movie.

429
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:11,148
- If you say so. 
 - I do.

430
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,733
What time is it?

431
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:16,361
- It's 1 0:30. 
 - We've been talking for over an hour.

432
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:17,863
Whoo. Call the police.

433
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:22,367
Ha-ha. I should get going. 
 Homework.

434
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:25,078
Hey, listen, what are you up to 
 on Saturday?

435
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:27,915
I'm looking for a tour guide 
 to show me the sights.

436
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:29,917
Oh, I can't, I have plans.

437
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,379
Come on, you gotta rescue me from my 
 psycho stepsister. At least a few hours.

438
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:39,134
Look, don't you think we should 
 take this slower?

439
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:41,303
You know, I don't really know you and--

440
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:46,099
Take what slow? 
 I wasn't asking you on a date.

441
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:48,143
- I just wanted to make a new friend. 
 - I know, I wasn't--

442
00:33:48,185 --> 00:33:51,772
- Man, are you conceited. 
 - No, I'm not conceited. It's just--

443
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:56,902
- I have to go. 
 - Hello? Hello?

444
00:33:56,985 --> 00:33:59,446
Always make an impression.

445
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:04,785
- Psycho stepsister? 
 - Evening.

446
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:08,789
Evening. 
 Oh, she shot you down.

447
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,874
Exactly the opposite.

448
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:14,962
So what's on the agenda? 
 Matinee of The Lion King?

449
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:18,382
Man, you really have it 
 out for her, don't you?

450
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:22,803
It must really burn your ass that 
 with all your money and popularity...

451
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:26,306
she still won't have anything 
 to do with you.

452
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,517
Face it, Kathryn-- 
 she's outclassed you.

453
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,395
How dare you talk to me like that, 
 you son of a bitch?

454
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,480
Well, this has been fun.

455
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,318
Unfortunately, I have some work to do, 
 and you have to go throw up.

456
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:41,530
After all, it was a very big salad 
 you had for dinner.

457
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:46,201
- Have you been spying on me? 
 - Oh, my God, I ate a crouton!

458
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:49,663
We'll see who gets the last laugh, 
 brother dear.

459
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:06,722
Oh, no, I'm sorry!

460
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:10,142
It's all my fault. I wasn't thinking. 
 I'll get it. I'll clean it up. Sorry.

461
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:13,228
It's okay. It's okay.

462
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:17,983
- Stop crying. 
 -Just don't tell anyone.

463
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:21,486
What is this, Ben Hur? 
 Do they beat you here?

464
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,489
Please don't tell anyone.

465
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:28,785
Min Lin, relax.

466
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:31,788
Christ, it's like 
 a fucking Godzilla movie.

467
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:39,713
- You girls know the routine? 
 - Seduce.

468
00:35:39,796 --> 00:35:41,381
And destroy.

469
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:45,761
Shut up.

470
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:53,185
Mm, very nice.

471
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:56,355
Who the fuck are you? 
 And you?

472
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:58,857
I'm Sarah, and this is Gretchen.

473
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,444
We had a sleep over at Kathryn's, 
 and we're running a little late.

474
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,112
Do you mind if we share your shower?

475
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:11,536
- Yeah. Yeah, be my guest. 
 - Thank you.

476
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:22,464
Ooh, pass me the loofah.

477
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:33,141
Hey.

478
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,564
So, what year are you guys?

479
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:41,066
- We're seniors. 
 - Cool.

480
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:46,446
How do you like Manchester, Sebastian?

481
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,948
It's--

482
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:51,576
It's-- it's unbelievably--

483
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,330
- Unbelievably what? 
 - Unbelievably hard.

484
00:36:56,665 --> 00:37:01,003
- It certainly is. 
 - Rock hard. Down, boy.

485
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:07,176
So, you guys sisters?

486
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:12,055
More like kissing cousins.

487
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:15,976
Whoa!

488
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,481
Slippery when wet.

489
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:26,528
So, you're seeing Danielle Sherman?

490
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,822
Who?

491
00:37:28,906 --> 00:37:31,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, trying to.

492
00:37:31,742 --> 00:37:36,872
- She's a sweet girl. 
 - You guys would make a great couple.

493
00:37:36,914 --> 00:37:39,124
Just too bad you're gonna 
 miss out on all the action.

494
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:42,419
- What action? 
 - Oh, come on.

495
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:46,965
With the exception of Danielle, 
 Manchester Prep's a virtual whorehouse.

496
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:50,427
As the school motto goes...

497
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:53,180
"If you don't snort it, suck it."

498
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,436
- Careful. 
 - He splurged.

499
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:02,981
But you won't have to worry since you'll 
 be dating the headmaster's daughter.

500
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:05,859
No. Guess not.

501
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:07,736
- See you on campus. 
 - Ring toss.

502
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:09,738
Score.

503
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:12,157
Yes!

504
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:16,536
Thanks for, you know, sharing.

505
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,790
- Here, sis, I'll dry you off. 
 - Thanks.

506
00:38:19,873 --> 00:38:21,542
Shit.

507
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:32,469
Breakfast was late, 
 my skirt is mussed...

508
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:34,596
and I needed the car last night.

509
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:37,724
- I'm sorry, Miss Merteuil-- 
 - No excuses!

510
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:41,728
Now, just because my mother is out 
 of town does not mean you can slack off.

511
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:45,107
Each lapse, each oversight, 
 will be reported.

512
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:47,192
Good, you haven't left.

513
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,737
What's this? 
 Saddam addressing the troops?

514
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:53,157
- Allow me, sir. 
 - No, it's all right, Henry.

515
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,785
There, there, sir. Pay close attention. 
 The perfect Windsor is an art.

516
00:38:56,868 --> 00:39:00,455
- Rough night last night? 
 - There was a pea under my mattress.

517
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,625
- I'll look into it, sir. 
 - No, Henry, it was great. It was a ten.

518
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:07,546
Can we go now, 
 or do we send Kapoor in our place?

519
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:10,299
I almost forgot. 
 Here are your allowances.

520
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,887
What's this? 
 Annual? Semiannual?

521
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:20,267
- Weekly, of course. 
 - This is amazing.

522
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,271
The leftovers, sir. 
 It's what I like to call mad money.

523
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:26,273
Yeah, mad.

524
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:31,111
Unless you use it 
 to make someone happy.

525
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:33,530
For the Windsor and the advice.

526
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:36,825
Thank you, sir. 
 Thank you very much. Very kind.

527
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,870
Tutor me in French? 
 Tutor me in French?

528
00:39:39,953 --> 00:39:42,497
Danielle! Oh, my gosh, 
 am I glad I found you?

529
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:45,292
Look, I am flunking French, 
 like tres flunking it.

530
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:48,378
- Last quiz: D-minus. 
 - Have you been studying?

531
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:53,091
Of course, I study like crazy, but it 
 just goes in one hole and out the other.

532
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:56,011
- Well, I wish I could help you. 
 - You can! You can tutor me.

533
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:59,556
Mom said I can pay you, unless 
 that's like too totally insulting...

534
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,892
because, you know, we've got money, 
 and you're the headmaster's daughter...

535
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:04,311
and headmasters make, like, zilch.

536
00:40:04,394 --> 00:40:06,188
Thanks.

537
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,442
Tutor me, please, please. 
 I'll pay you $200 an hour, $200.

538
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:14,154
Stop. Of course I'll tutor you. 
 The money doesn't matter.

539
00:40:14,238 --> 00:40:18,450
Going rate will be fine. God, why does 
 everything have to be about money?

540
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,118
'Cause it's cool.

541
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:28,418
- Do you hear a phone? 
 - Yeah.

542
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:31,338
Oh, wait. 
 Sounds like it's coming from here.

543
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:34,758
- I don't have a phone. 
 - You do now. "Answer me."

544
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,761
Oh, my God, so cool. 
 Is it your birthday or something?

545
00:40:39,554 --> 00:40:40,973
- Hello? 
 - Do you like the phone?

546
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:43,934
I might, 
 if it comes with an explanation.

547
00:40:44,017 --> 00:40:45,727
It does, actually.

548
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:47,688
I think I may have 
 real feelings for you.

549
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:50,899
- It's Sebastian Valmont, isn't it? 
 -Just a second, okay?

550
00:40:50,983 --> 00:40:52,734
- Sorry. 
 - Not you. Her.

551
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:55,571
- Who's her? 
 - Look, I can't do this from a phone.

552
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:57,948
But it's a good phone. Digital.

553
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,994
- Where are you? You can't be too far. 
 - Look down.

554
00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:09,501
Oh, it is Sebastian Valmont.

555
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:12,087
Don't move. 
 I'm coming down there.

556
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:19,553
- Move, Einstein. 
 - Hey!

557
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:22,180
Where are you?

558
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:24,182
- Close your eyes. 
 - Why?

559
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:26,226
- Just trust me. Close your eyes. 
 - I'll look silly.

560
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,520
Close them now.

561
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:39,198
Danielle, wait!

562
00:41:45,454 --> 00:41:49,625
It's like they say: 
 The best laid plans sometimes suck.

563
00:42:00,344 --> 00:42:02,304
Miss Merteuil.

564
00:42:04,848 --> 00:42:08,810
- But I'm excused from gym. 
 - Gym, yes. Ballet, no.

565
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,357
Well, there must be something 
 I can do to change your mind.

566
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,361
I think you've got the wrong guy. 
 Now get your ass to ballet.

567
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:22,032
Mr. Erwick.

568
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:27,663
I was very clear. Keep me out of gym...

569
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:31,124
- and ballet. 
 - I can't do anything, all right?

570
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:34,336
Hargrove called me into his office. He's 
 suspicious, I heard it in his voice.

571
00:42:34,378 --> 00:42:37,464
- Why do you think that is? 
 - Well, I'm not sure.

572
00:42:37,547 --> 00:42:39,842
The Disciplinary Committee, of course.

573
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:41,844
You stuttered and stammered 
 like a completely whipped fool...

574
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:45,013
and then when you voted, it was obvious 
 you voted the way I wanted you to vote.

575
00:42:45,097 --> 00:42:49,893
But that's how you did want me to vote. 
 Oh, my God, I'm a mess.

576
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:53,230
You're always one step ahead of me. 
 I don't know what to do anymore.

577
00:42:53,313 --> 00:42:55,273
It's a dirty old man's catch-22.

578
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:57,526
Shut up, Steve. 
 Get control of yourself.

579
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:00,153
I can't. 
 I'm falling apart.

580
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:05,367
My wife doesn't turn me on anymore, 
 my kids hate me. I should just quit.

581
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:08,328
Stop blubbering. 
 I'll go back to gym and ballet.

582
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:12,541
- You will? 
 - The excuse slips were just a test.

583
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:16,169
The day will come when I'll need you 
 for a favor-- a big favor--

584
00:43:16,253 --> 00:43:18,171
and you'll do it without question.

585
00:43:23,427 --> 00:43:26,596
Of course. 
 I worship you, Kathryn.

586
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,016
Worship works best 
 on your knees, Steve.

587
00:43:34,104 --> 00:43:38,066
Please be quiet. I'm trying to imagine 
 I'm with someone attractive.

588
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,651
Sorry.

589
00:43:44,281 --> 00:43:46,283
Hello!

590
00:43:46,325 --> 00:43:48,285
Anybody!

591
00:43:57,169 --> 00:43:59,212
Oh, my God, she is terrible.

592
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,424
If it's so bad here, 
 why don't you guys just quit?

593
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:04,551
It's steady employment, sir.

594
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:07,387
This is a good address. 
 We could be down in the 50s!

595
00:44:07,471 --> 00:44:10,057
Or worse, Scarsdale.

596
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,267
Ladies there make me crazy!

597
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:15,687
All the time sending me to the market 
 looking for gefilte.

598
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:18,649
My father-- 
 fisherman for 20 years--

599
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:20,776
he never caught one gefilte.

600
00:44:20,817 --> 00:44:22,569
What is a gefilte?

601
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,198
- Three kings. 
 - Man!

602
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,283
- That beats my two pairs. 
 - I got crap.

603
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:29,826
Full house, jacks over threes.

604
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:31,828
You win again, Master Sebastian.

605
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,123
You know, Henry, I really wish 
 you'd quit with the "master" thing.

606
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:38,127
But sir, it's your title. 
 It shows privilege.

607
00:44:38,168 --> 00:44:39,795
Yeah, well, 
 what has it gotten me?

608
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:42,381
I poured all my money into gifts 
 and didn't get the girl.

609
00:44:42,464 --> 00:44:46,385
Danielle hates my wealth 
 or resents it or something.

610
00:44:46,468 --> 00:44:48,762
Perhaps it's not my place 
 to speak, sir.

611
00:44:48,845 --> 00:44:50,806
No, Henry, please. 
 I'm desperate here.

612
00:44:51,765 --> 00:44:54,560
Well, maybe she doesn't want to feel 
 like she's being bought.

613
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,147
- You think that's it? 
 - I don't know. Women are complicated.

614
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:02,985
It's been my experience, sir, 
 that women are more interested...

615
00:45:03,026 --> 00:45:06,154
in the soul of a man 
 than in his trappings.

616
00:45:11,368 --> 00:45:13,870
What is going on around here?

617
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:18,167
I had to ring and ring. 
 And where were you, Frederick?

618
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:19,835
I paged you four times.

619
00:45:19,877 --> 00:45:22,587
I had to take a cab. 
 A cab!

620
00:45:22,671 --> 00:45:24,464
I'm sorry, we were just--

621
00:45:24,548 --> 00:45:27,509
Get out of here, 
 all of you.

622
00:45:27,593 --> 00:45:30,345
And you can be damned sure 
 my mother's gonna hear about this.

623
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:33,390
- No, she won't. 
 - What did you say?

624
00:45:33,432 --> 00:45:35,726
You're not telling anybody 
 about this.

625
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,353
This was my idea. 
 I ordered them to play cards.

626
00:45:38,437 --> 00:45:41,481
And to drink Mother's 
 prized 1939 Neufdu Pape?

627
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:44,151
Great year. 
 Blitzkrieg, wasn't it?

628
00:45:44,234 --> 00:45:46,153
Don't get smart.

629
00:45:46,236 --> 00:45:49,198
Whether you realize it or not, 
 you are still a guest in this house.

630
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:52,784
You know, you treat these people like 
 dirt. No wonder they don't respect you.

631
00:45:52,868 --> 00:45:58,123
We pay them for service, not respect. 
 Maybe someday you'll learn that.

632
00:45:58,207 --> 00:46:00,667
And one day you'll realize 
 that they're human beings.

633
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,548
Just give me a second here.

634
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:09,843
Party's over.

635
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:16,308
You know, I don't get it.

636
00:46:19,353 --> 00:46:21,605
Look, if you hate your mother 
 so much...

637
00:46:21,688 --> 00:46:24,399
why work so hard 
 to be just like her?

638
00:46:24,441 --> 00:46:26,068
Is that what you think I'm doing?

639
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:29,613
Well, you're obviously trying 
 to prove something to someone.

640
00:46:29,696 --> 00:46:32,116
No one's this mean, unless--

641
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:34,743
unless there's a whole bunch 
 of pain and suffering behind it.

642
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:38,121
You think you have it so tough, having 
 to come into this strange house...

643
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:40,999
with strange people-- 
 try growing up here.

644
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:46,004
Try spending every moment of your life 
 just making up for just being here.

645
00:46:46,088 --> 00:46:49,424
- That doesn't make any sense. 
 - No, it doesn't, does it?

646
00:46:49,466 --> 00:46:52,511
You feel out of place, Sebastian? 
 You want to fit in?

647
00:46:52,594 --> 00:46:54,221
Guess what. So do I.

648
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:04,606
What a mess.

649
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:09,987
- Hello. 
 - Sebastian? It's Cherie.

650
00:47:10,028 --> 00:47:13,615
News flash. Danielle is 
 totally, madly in love with you.

651
00:47:13,657 --> 00:47:15,784
Madly in love with me? 
 She hates me.

652
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:19,204
- Every move I make is the wrong move. 
 - Yeah, but she told me stuff..

653
00:47:19,288 --> 00:47:23,709
Every time she thinks about you, every 
 time she sees you, she gets all moist.

654
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:25,460
" Moist"?

655
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:27,629
Her eyes-- 
 she gets tears in them.

656
00:47:29,006 --> 00:47:31,800
But look, time's running out. 
 You gotta move now.

657
00:47:31,842 --> 00:47:35,971
She'll be in the city tonight-- dinner 
 with her favorite aunt, Riverside Cafe.

658
00:47:37,848 --> 00:47:40,726
I figure if you go there, 
 bare your soul--

659
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:44,938
No gifts though. 
 She hates that money thing. Hello?

660
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,127
Closet street performer.

661
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,670
Now you know all my secrets.

662
00:48:08,712 --> 00:48:11,131
How did you know I was here?

663
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:15,427
Nope. Already know. 
 Cherie the blabbermouth.

664
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:18,680
Weird girl, but if you get beyond 
 all the "totallys" and "oh, my Gods"...

665
00:48:18,722 --> 00:48:20,474
there's real truth there.

666
00:48:20,557 --> 00:48:22,476
- I have to catch my train. 
 - Let me come with.

667
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,311
I'll make sure 
 you get home all right.

668
00:48:24,394 --> 00:48:28,357
You can come as far as the station and 
 only if you can do it without talking.

669
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,818
Not another word-- 
 that's my condition.

670
00:48:31,902 --> 00:48:33,612
Condition accepted.

671
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:44,206
All right, all right! Stop! I give up, 
 okay? We can talk. Stop playing.

672
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:47,960
You know, I think this is 
 the most romantic city on earth--

673
00:48:48,043 --> 00:48:52,839
millions of strangers meeting 
 in restaurants, parks, sidewalks--

674
00:48:52,923 --> 00:48:57,052
a romance born every five seconds, 
 every heartbeat.

675
00:48:57,094 --> 00:48:59,304
I mean, God, 
 is this a great city or what?

676
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:03,767
This is exactly what I'm talking about. 
 You spout BS on a continuous basis.

677
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,352
Only because I can't say 
 what I really want to say.

678
00:49:05,435 --> 00:49:08,897
- Say it! 
 - Okay.

679
00:49:08,939 --> 00:49:12,359
I wanna know what happened 
 at school, in the courtyard.

680
00:49:12,442 --> 00:49:14,361
I kissed you, 
 and you just ran off.

681
00:49:16,113 --> 00:49:20,409
I'm crazy about you! I'm trying 
 everything I can to make you like me.

682
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,662
Be yourself. Be honest. 
 Why is that so difficult?

683
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:28,208
I don't know. 
 Maybe I'm scared.

684
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,880
You know, I'm new here, right? 
 New to this city...

685
00:49:33,964 --> 00:49:35,591
new at school...

686
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:38,385
living in a house full 
 of certifiable wackos...

687
00:49:38,469 --> 00:49:40,387
and I don't have any friends...

688
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,432
at least, any I can trust.

689
00:49:43,515 --> 00:49:45,559
And I'm confused.

690
00:49:45,642 --> 00:49:48,979
God's honest truth, 
 I'm in a state of perpetual confusion.

691
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:52,274
So what are you scared of?

692
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:57,112
Missing my train. 
 See you at school. Bye.

693
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:12,461
As you know, 
 your mother gets home tonight.

694
00:50:12,502 --> 00:50:15,505
And you want me to keep quiet 
 about the poker game.

695
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:18,842
I don't like these ideas 
 Sebastian's putting in your head.

696
00:50:18,926 --> 00:50:21,470
- I mean no disrespect. 
 - Well, I'm offended.

697
00:50:21,512 --> 00:50:24,514
Leave. 
 I'll finish alone.

698
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:29,144
Min Lin, wait.

699
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:32,731
Why don't you and I get to know each 
 other, like with Sebastian last night?

700
00:50:32,814 --> 00:50:36,151
- Do I have to? 
 - Come on, it'll be fun.

701
00:50:36,193 --> 00:50:38,111
Here.

702
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:46,161
I'll jump right in. 
 Where are you from-- China, Japan?

703
00:50:46,203 --> 00:50:47,788
Cambodia actually.

704
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:51,917
Cambodia-- wonderful country. And when 
 did you come to our United States?

705
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,294
My family fled through Vietnam.

706
00:50:54,378 --> 00:50:58,924
Ultimately, we were 1 20 crammed 
 into a boat the size of your pantry.

707
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:03,470
Oh, my gosh, that reminds me of this 
 time in Denver, coming home from Aspen.

708
00:51:03,554 --> 00:51:06,848
The first-class lounge was packed. 
 We almost had to fly coach.

709
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,645
Anyway, so your family fled 
 the Khmer Rouge?

710
00:51:12,896 --> 00:51:16,358
Nothing subtle 
 about that shade of rouge.

711
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,612
See? We do have a lot in common.

712
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:23,740
Will there be anything else, 
 Miss Kathryn?

713
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:26,618
No, that's all.

714
00:51:29,746 --> 00:51:31,248
I'm glad we did this, 
 aren't you?

715
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:34,918
Oh, yes. 
 Very enlightening.

716
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:38,714
Bitch.

717
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:45,721
You got all your pronouns mixed up.

718
00:51:45,762 --> 00:51:48,724
"Nous " is "we." 
 "Vous " is "you."

719
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:52,936
Unless it's someone 
 you're crazy, madly in love with...

720
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,565
in which case it's "tu, " 
 as in you and Sebastian.

721
00:51:56,606 --> 00:51:58,650
I swear, that thing 
 with the phone-- so cool.

722
00:51:58,734 --> 00:52:00,319
I mean, if it had been 
 me and some guy--

723
00:52:00,402 --> 00:52:02,279
I would have piddled 
 right there on the spot.

724
00:52:02,321 --> 00:52:04,323
Oh, wait, 
 did I show you my doodle?

725
00:52:04,406 --> 00:52:06,950
- Excuse me? 
 - My doodle, my sketch.

726
00:52:11,788 --> 00:52:13,582
Wow.

727
00:52:13,624 --> 00:52:16,918
- You've got some talent, Cherie. 
 -Just tell me:

728
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,421
I mean, do you really like him? 
 Is this it?

729
00:52:19,463 --> 00:52:22,049
- Is it the real thing? 
 - Like I even know what that is.

730
00:52:22,132 --> 00:52:24,301
Knees go weak, mouth goes dry...

731
00:52:24,384 --> 00:52:27,429
you get that little tingling feeling 
 in that special place.

732
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:32,809
He's just so slick, 
 so sure of himself.

733
00:52:32,893 --> 00:52:34,853
I have a lot of trouble 
 trusting him.

734
00:52:34,937 --> 00:52:37,731
He can't just come out and talk to me, 
 say what he's really feeling...

735
00:52:37,814 --> 00:52:39,775
and neither can I.

736
00:52:41,276 --> 00:52:43,278
Okay, chapter three.

737
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,281
Read the translation 
 of the first passage.

738
00:52:47,282 --> 00:52:52,788
" Love is a sublime melting pot in which 
 men and women are fused together.

739
00:52:52,871 --> 00:52:57,334
The lover is a priest, the ravished 
 virgin a trembling sacrifice."

740
00:52:57,376 --> 00:53:00,128
A priest and a virgin?

741
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,297
That's sick!

742
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:11,014
Move. Move.

743
00:53:16,687 --> 00:53:20,774
- Hi, Mr. Nagao! 
 - Hello, ladies!

744
00:53:20,857 --> 00:53:24,319
I make a special 
 eel and cuke roll today.

745
00:53:28,323 --> 00:53:30,909
It's so sad about Mr. Washington.

746
00:53:30,993 --> 00:53:34,663
I mean, the fact that they found 
 a dead rat in that student's sloppy Joe.

747
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,459
He'll never work again.

748
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:42,629
So, you never told us 
 how it went with Cherie.

749
00:53:42,713 --> 00:53:46,842
- Did you bury her? 
 - Let's say she's on her way to ruin.

750
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:52,347
- Everything's set for this weekend. 
 - What are you talking about?

751
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:55,350
Uh, duh. 
 I told my mom how much fun we had...

752
00:53:55,392 --> 00:53:58,353
and she invited you and your mom over 
 for nonfat lattes.

753
00:53:58,395 --> 00:54:00,772
Your mom told my mom 
 that you can sleep over.

754
00:54:00,856 --> 00:54:04,359
I got the new Hanson album! 
 Okay, I gotta go.

755
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:08,530
Gordon Anderson promised he'd show me 
 his one-eyed snake, whatever that is.

756
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,366
Okay, see you.

757
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,205
Wow, Kathryn, 
 you really showed her.

758
00:54:26,423 --> 00:54:29,968
Don't talk. Don't say a word.

759
00:54:30,052 --> 00:54:31,970
It's my turn to explain.

760
00:54:33,597 --> 00:54:37,935
All I've done is hound you 
 about being honest...

761
00:54:37,976 --> 00:54:41,271
when I couldn't do it myself.

762
00:54:41,355 --> 00:54:45,776
That kiss in the courtyard, Sebastian-- 
 it was more than just a kiss.

763
00:54:46,985 --> 00:54:49,530
- I'll say. 
 - No, let me finish.

764
00:54:49,613 --> 00:54:52,491
You see...

765
00:54:52,574 --> 00:54:55,285
it was my first kiss.

766
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:58,747
I wanted it to be perfect 
 and right and with the right boy...

767
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:01,917
and, while you might have been the right 
 boy, the rest was totally not right.

768
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,919
I embarrassed you.

769
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,963
I embarrassed myself.

770
00:55:06,004 --> 00:55:09,007
Because I know you're used to girls 
 with all this experience...

771
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:11,426
and you've probably been 
 kissing girls forever...

772
00:55:11,468 --> 00:55:13,595
and that's what I was 
 afraid to tell you.

773
00:55:18,684 --> 00:55:20,769
I happen to think 
 this is wonderful, all right?

774
00:55:20,811 --> 00:55:24,272
So you weren't exactly 
 up-front and honest. Join the club.

775
00:55:24,356 --> 00:55:26,024
I wanted it to be perfect...

776
00:55:26,775 --> 00:55:29,945
not the tail end of some prank.

777
00:55:29,987 --> 00:55:32,364
Does that make any sense?

778
00:55:32,447 --> 00:55:33,699
Yeah.

779
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:37,703
You know, some things can't 
 be orchestrated.

780
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:42,207
Some things have to be 
 spontaneous, like a kiss.

781
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:44,585
Like the kiss we're 
 about to have right now.

782
00:55:55,846 --> 00:55:57,806
Say something, quick.

783
00:55:58,515 --> 00:56:00,017
I can't.

784
00:56:00,893 --> 00:56:03,479
I have to go. Last bell.

785
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,567
Okay, but...

786
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:13,447
just back away 
 so I know you're not running away.

787
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:29,755
That was wonderful--

788
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:32,007
just precious.

789
00:56:32,049 --> 00:56:33,800
How long were you there?

790
00:56:35,093 --> 00:56:38,180
"I've never kissed a boy before-- 
 I mean, the right boy...

791
00:56:38,221 --> 00:56:41,683
and you've probably been 
 kissing girls forever."

792
00:56:41,725 --> 00:56:45,687
You must feel like a terrible dope, 
 leading on that poor, lovesick girl.

793
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:47,939
You don't know 
 what you're talking about.

794
00:56:48,023 --> 00:56:51,777
Here's a prediction: A few weeks 
 of hand-holding and chaste smooching...

795
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,530
and you'll be so bored and horny 
 you'll mess the whole thing up.

796
00:56:54,571 --> 00:56:57,908
Of course, I could 
 wipe her off the map tomorrow....

797
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:01,495
but I think I'll let this little romance 
 just flicker out all on its own.

798
00:57:01,578 --> 00:57:05,332
I like the girl, okay? I like her a lot. 
 You screw it up, and I'll screw you up.

799
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:07,876
Nobody ever threatens me.

800
00:57:09,252 --> 00:57:11,630
I just did-- 
 or weren't you listening?

801
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:18,053
- You do realize this means war. 
 - Then war it is.

802
00:57:25,018 --> 00:57:26,895
Lovely.

803
00:57:32,985 --> 00:57:35,112
Well, I feel badly for you, 
 I really do...

804
00:57:35,195 --> 00:57:38,949
but Byron needs to be groomed 
 every day at 3:00.

805
00:57:39,032 --> 00:57:41,618
Well, you'll just have to reschedule 
 your daughter's birthday.

806
00:57:41,702 --> 00:57:44,413
Now, I want him saddled 
 and ready to ride when I arrive.

807
00:57:44,496 --> 00:57:47,457
Don't keep me waiting. 
 Idiot!

808
00:57:49,126 --> 00:57:51,753
There's a new student at Manchester-- 
 Cherie Clayman.

809
00:57:52,504 --> 00:57:53,755
Did she die?

810
00:57:53,797 --> 00:57:57,259
- I take it you don't like her. 
 - I can't stand her.

811
00:57:57,301 --> 00:58:01,680
She's actually very sweet, 
 so I'm turning her into the school slut.

812
00:58:01,763 --> 00:58:04,141
- Well, she's now your new best friend. 
 - Why?

813
00:58:05,434 --> 00:58:09,521
You're not hitting up the Claymans 
 for a donation to Manchester.

814
00:58:12,024 --> 00:58:14,693
Sorry, Mother. 
 I think it's an excellent idea.

815
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:19,531
- The Claymans will join us at 7:00. 
 - You invited them here?

816
00:58:19,615 --> 00:58:21,742
Mother, they're from California.

817
00:58:21,825 --> 00:58:23,619
Kathryn, I need this.

818
00:58:23,702 --> 00:58:27,956
Just 20 million more and we can break 
 ground on the Tiffany Merteuil Library.

819
00:58:32,669 --> 00:58:35,923
Well, you ladies seem to be 
 enjoying yourselves.

820
00:58:36,006 --> 00:58:38,425
You must be tense, Sebastian.

821
00:58:38,509 --> 00:58:40,636
Yeah, well, you'd be too 
 if you were failing gym.

822
00:58:40,677 --> 00:58:43,263
I mean, who ever heard of fencing 
 as a sport?

823
00:58:43,347 --> 00:58:45,974
Perhaps a massage would help.

824
00:58:47,684 --> 00:58:49,645
I've never had a massage before.

825
00:58:50,687 --> 00:58:53,815
You can have my table. 
 I'm suddenly not in the mood.

826
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:57,653
"Mycket, " not "myckesh. "

827
00:58:57,736 --> 00:59:00,405
Kathryn, if you're not going to say it 
 correctly, don't say it at all.

828
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:02,991
It just makes you look foolish.

829
00:59:03,075 --> 00:59:05,202
Thank you 
 for the correction, Mother.

830
00:59:08,539 --> 00:59:10,123
Now, if you'll excuse me.

831
00:59:14,044 --> 00:59:16,004
I think I could get used to this.

832
00:59:19,174 --> 00:59:20,259
Hi.

833
00:59:22,177 --> 00:59:24,846
Dead puppies, 
 dead puppies, dead puppies...

834
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:27,182
old nuns in their underwear--

835
00:59:35,565 --> 00:59:37,693
I thought you'd left.

836
00:59:37,776 --> 00:59:40,362
- Is that Sonja or Ingrid? 
 - It's Tiffany.

837
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:44,032
- I hope you enjoyed your massage. 
 - I think I'll go take a shower.

838
00:59:44,908 --> 00:59:48,120
We've had so little time together, 
 Sebastian.

839
00:59:48,203 --> 00:59:51,748
We can't be a happy family if we don't 
 get to know each other a little better.

840
00:59:51,832 --> 00:59:56,295
You're right, Mom. 
 We should talk more, Mom.

841
00:59:56,378 --> 00:59:59,631
With your father working on the yacht so 
 much, I'll have plenty of time for you.

842
01:00:00,716 --> 01:00:02,885
You know, some nights 
 he doesn't even come home.

843
01:00:04,595 --> 01:00:06,555
He loves that yacht.

844
01:00:06,638 --> 01:00:08,849
I'm glad he found something 
 he's so committed to.

845
01:00:09,892 --> 01:00:12,394
Well, the right woman will do that.

846
01:00:12,436 --> 01:00:16,398
- And you think I'm the right woman? 
 - Definitely. He's a changed man.

847
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,570
Of course. Without me he'd still be 
 in Miami giving charters to geriatrics.

848
01:00:21,653 --> 01:00:24,740
It's not the money, it's you. 
 He loves you.

849
01:00:24,782 --> 01:00:28,994
You're a smart boy, Sebastian. You seem 
 to understand your father very well.

850
01:00:29,077 --> 01:00:30,746
I hope so.

851
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:36,335
So do I, because if you're wrong, you're 
 both going to end up out on the street.

852
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:42,049
She spanked me.

853
01:00:45,552 --> 01:00:50,015
- Oh, baby. Oh, that feels so good. 
 - Oh, yeah, you like that, huh?

854
01:00:50,098 --> 01:00:53,519
- Dad, you here? 
 - Fuck! Fuck!

855
01:01:01,777 --> 01:01:04,404
Hey, son, how's it goin'?

856
01:01:04,488 --> 01:01:07,116
- In bed already? 
 - Oh, it's just a catnap.

857
01:01:11,036 --> 01:01:12,579
What are you doing?

858
01:01:12,663 --> 01:01:17,126
Oh, I'm just looking for the cat.

859
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:20,087
Here, puss, puss, 
 puss, puss, puss.

860
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,547
I hope you're not suggesting 
 I'm having an affair.

861
01:01:22,631 --> 01:01:25,634
- I'm not suggesting anything. 
 - I'm your father...

862
01:01:25,676 --> 01:01:27,886
and I will not be treated 
 like a criminal!

863
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,806
Criminal.

864
01:01:35,352 --> 01:01:37,646
You could have fooled me.

865
01:01:37,688 --> 01:01:40,607
And behind door number three 
 we have--

866
01:01:43,193 --> 01:01:46,488
- Hello. 
 - Sebastian, meet Lilly...

867
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:49,408
my first mate.

868
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:52,244
Lilly, I'm Sebastian, 
 Edward's son.

869
01:01:53,745 --> 01:01:58,750
Oh, my God, you have your father's eyes. 
 Are you a Libra?

870
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:01,169
Let's just cut right to the chase, 
 shall we?

871
01:02:01,211 --> 01:02:04,006
He offered to sail you 
 around the world, didn't he?

872
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:05,549
How did you know?

873
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:08,343
Leave right now, 
 or you're grounded for a week.

874
01:02:08,427 --> 01:02:11,972
- Did he tell you he's married? 
 - I was waiting for the right time.

875
01:02:13,015 --> 01:02:14,892
You lied to me?

876
01:02:14,933 --> 01:02:17,352
More an error of omission. 
 You see, she's very sick.

877
01:02:17,394 --> 01:02:20,606
I may be single any day now.

878
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,108
Go to hell!

879
01:02:25,527 --> 01:02:29,114
Sebastian, you think you could 
 help me out here?

880
01:02:32,034 --> 01:02:35,162
Okay, okay, 
 I know we talked about this...

881
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:37,748
but you're a man, 
 and you have to understand--

882
01:02:38,707 --> 01:02:40,501
You have to understand.

883
01:02:40,584 --> 01:02:44,504
It's not just your life anymore, Dad, 
 it's mine too. Don't screw it up for me.

884
01:02:44,588 --> 01:02:49,676
Absolutely. You can count on me, son. 
 The keys, please?

885
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:56,391
You know, you made your bed. 
 Now lie in it.

886
01:03:06,777 --> 01:03:10,072
Well, this sucks.

887
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:17,621
I can't believe I was so stupid.

888
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:20,207
I really thought your dad liked me.

889
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:21,917
It's not your fault.

890
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:26,380
He's the master of deceit. He should be 
 in the Pathological Liars' Hall of Fame.

891
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,924
He was in the Hall of Fame?

892
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:31,260
- Never mind. 
 - Can I ask you something?

893
01:03:31,301 --> 01:03:33,929
- Sure. 
 - Why are men such jerks?

894
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:36,348
I mean, is it genetic or something?

895
01:03:36,431 --> 01:03:40,018
You know, they promise you the world, 
 that you're the one for them...

896
01:03:40,102 --> 01:03:43,564
and that their wives 
 don't understand them anymore.

897
01:03:43,647 --> 01:03:46,191
And I fall for it every time.

898
01:03:47,276 --> 01:03:50,654
I'm like a doormat. 
 They're always coming and going...

899
01:03:50,696 --> 01:03:54,199
and coming and going, 
 and coming and--

900
01:03:54,283 --> 01:03:56,618
My life sucks.

901
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:00,747
Lilly, you don't need a man 
 to be happy.

902
01:04:00,831 --> 01:04:04,251
If you're not happy alone, you're 
 not gonna be happy with someone else.

903
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:07,879
You're a very attractive woman. 
 You could have anyone you want.

904
01:04:07,963 --> 01:04:10,132
You just have to wait 
 for the right guy to come along.

905
01:04:12,176 --> 01:04:16,054
- You think I'm attractive? 
 - I think you're beautiful.

906
01:04:16,138 --> 01:04:18,348
You're so sincere.

907
01:04:18,432 --> 01:04:20,934
You're not like your father at all.

908
01:04:25,189 --> 01:04:29,484
Okay. 
 Glad you were paying attention.

909
01:04:29,526 --> 01:04:31,820
Do you wanna 
 come back to my place?

910
01:04:31,904 --> 01:04:35,657
I'd love to, but I have 
 an oral report due in the morning.

911
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:37,701
Oh, I'm great at orals.

912
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:39,661
- Yeah. 
 - Try me.

913
01:04:39,703 --> 01:04:41,496
No, thank you.

914
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,665
Listen, I'm gonna split. 
 Are you gonna be okay?

915
01:04:43,707 --> 01:04:45,459
Yeah, I'll be fine.

916
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:49,338
Psycho.

917
01:04:57,095 --> 01:05:00,557
I lived in Fresnomy whole life. 
 Les too.

918
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,768
But we wanted more for Cherie, 
 so when Les sold the biz...

919
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:05,729
we decided to move 
 to the Big Apple.

920
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:07,356
And how are you finding Manchester?

921
01:05:07,397 --> 01:05:11,026
Oh, it's no problem. 
 Our driver-- he takes me right there.

922
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:13,820
She's asking you 
 if you like it, honey.

923
01:05:13,904 --> 01:05:17,366
Oh, yeah, it's the best. 
 And Kathryn's been, like, so super-nice.

924
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:19,409
You know, some girls-- 
 they told me to stay away from her...

925
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:22,120
like she had 
 permanent PMS or something.

926
01:05:22,204 --> 01:05:24,998
Ew, gross! But she's been, 
 like, totally awesome!

927
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:29,044
I can tell she's going to be 
 very popular.

928
01:05:29,086 --> 01:05:32,339
- Oh, I won't be as popular as you. 
 - " Popular" is such a bore.

929
01:05:32,422 --> 01:05:36,343
The important thing is school spirit, 
 and nobody has as much as my mother.

930
01:05:36,426 --> 01:05:39,262
I do a little work 
 for the school fund-raising committee.

931
01:05:39,304 --> 01:05:40,931
You are so modest.

932
01:05:41,014 --> 01:05:44,560
Mother's already raised half the money 
 needed for the new school library.

933
01:05:44,643 --> 01:05:46,728
How much money have you raised?

934
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:50,524
Well, she barely has to do anything. 
 The parents practically throw it at her.

935
01:05:51,483 --> 01:05:53,569
Why do they throw money at you?

936
01:05:53,652 --> 01:05:57,364
Because charity is smiled upon 
 by the ladies who lunch.

937
01:05:57,447 --> 01:06:00,409
Society, Cherie. 
 You know-- the social ladder?

938
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,828
Oh, yeah. My mom said 
 now that we're rich...

939
01:06:02,911 --> 01:06:04,913
we gotta start climbing that thing.

940
01:06:04,997 --> 01:06:08,667
- Ow! What? 
 - Isn't she precious?

941
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:22,014
- Would you excuse me? Pardon me. 
 - Certainly.

942
01:06:24,308 --> 01:06:27,102
So, how much money do you need?

943
01:06:27,144 --> 01:06:30,897
Oh, I didn't invite you over here 
 to discuss fund-raising, Bunny...

944
01:06:32,316 --> 01:06:35,861
but if you'd care to make a donation, 
 we'd certainly consider it.

945
01:06:35,944 --> 01:06:39,698
Really? Why, thank you.

946
01:06:39,782 --> 01:06:41,616
My pleasure.

947
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,292
Oh, hi, honey. How was your day? 
 I can explain this.

948
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:54,463
There's no need to explain. 
 I know you love my mother very much.

949
01:06:54,546 --> 01:06:55,714
Yes. Exactly.

950
01:06:55,797 --> 01:06:58,967
And Sebastian and I are 
 just getting close.

951
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:02,637
I know you'd never do anything 
 to break up our happy home.

952
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:05,891
- Oh, no, never. 
 - So let's make sure it stays happy.

953
01:07:05,974 --> 01:07:08,352
I want you to take Mother to dinner 
 at Au Troquet for dinner tomorrow night.

954
01:07:08,393 --> 01:07:12,356
I'll make reservations at 8:00. At 8:45, 
 an accordion player will pass by.

955
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:14,983
When he does, request 
 " Under My Thumb" by the Rolling Stones.

956
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:17,027
Mick Jagger makes Mother 
 all hot and bothered.

957
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:18,737
-Jagger. Got it. 
 - While she's listening...

958
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:22,950
slip this on her finger, then kiss her-- 
 eight seconds, no tongue.

959
01:07:23,033 --> 01:07:25,869
Are you getting all this? 
 After dinner, grappa-- one glass--

960
01:07:25,953 --> 01:07:30,165
then bring her home, make love to her-- 
 two Viagra-- any questions?

961
01:07:30,249 --> 01:07:33,669
Just in case, 
 I've written it all down for you.

962
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,004
Now, who's your favorite daughter?

963
01:07:36,046 --> 01:07:37,339
You are.

964
01:07:45,305 --> 01:07:47,516
What a shame.

965
01:08:04,116 --> 01:08:05,701
Morning!

966
01:08:07,452 --> 01:08:08,829
Great day, isn't it?

967
01:08:08,912 --> 01:08:13,125
Bite me, rich boy!

968
01:08:14,585 --> 01:08:18,088
Ah, New York-- 
 a wonderful town.

969
01:08:19,757 --> 01:08:22,885
- You look fabulous. 
 - Thank you.

970
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:25,262
- You got everything? You all set? 
 - Yeah.

971
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:30,058
You ought to take some money, just 
 in case you need a cab, miss the train--

972
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:33,854
- Don't worry, Dad. I'll be fine. 
 - Come on, this is my job-- to worry.

973
01:08:37,608 --> 01:08:42,404
- What's wrong? 
 - Nothing. Just thought about your mom.

974
01:08:42,446 --> 01:08:44,573
- Go on. Have a good time. 
 - Okay.

975
01:08:44,615 --> 01:08:47,159
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

976
01:08:51,288 --> 01:08:53,665
Sebastian thought you'd like it 
 better than the train.

977
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:55,626
Wow.

978
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:58,337
I am so excited. 
 You know, I'm kind of nervous.

979
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,215
- I've never been on a horse before. 
 - Don't worry.

980
01:09:01,298 --> 01:09:03,801
I won't let anything bad 
 happen to you.

981
01:09:03,884 --> 01:09:06,053
If I like it, 
 then I'll have Daddy buy me a horse...

982
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:08,472
then we can spend 
 every weekend together.

983
01:09:08,555 --> 01:09:10,682
You'll love it. I promise.

984
01:09:17,105 --> 01:09:18,982
Very good, Cherie.

985
01:09:19,066 --> 01:09:22,778
Back on the horse now. I think 
 we're ready to try advanced jumping.

986
01:09:22,861 --> 01:09:26,782
I don't know. 
 He keeps throwing me off.

987
01:09:27,741 --> 01:09:30,827
All right. 
 If you're going to be a scaredy-cat...

988
01:09:30,911 --> 01:09:35,958
I guess we'd better 
 go back to the basics-- Manuela?

989
01:09:40,295 --> 01:09:42,464
Nice horsey.

990
01:09:46,385 --> 01:09:49,638
Okay. Now, using the stirrups...

991
01:09:49,721 --> 01:09:53,809
I want you to push up and down 
 in the saddle-- that's called posting.

992
01:09:53,892 --> 01:09:56,353
Now we need to add 
 the back and forth motion.

993
01:09:56,395 --> 01:10:00,190
When you hit the saddle, 
 push backward, then forward.

994
01:10:00,274 --> 01:10:04,903
Up and down, back and forth, 
 faster, faster.

995
01:10:04,987 --> 01:10:09,825
Up and down, back and forth, 
 faster, faster.

996
01:10:26,884 --> 01:10:30,512
Good. This time I want you 
 to really grind into the saddle.

997
01:10:30,554 --> 01:10:33,265
- Okay. 
 - Up and down, back and forth...

998
01:10:33,348 --> 01:10:35,726
faster, faster.

999
01:10:39,771 --> 01:10:41,106
- How does that feel? 
 - Okay.

1000
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:46,570
Up and down. 
 I think I'm getting it.

1001
01:10:46,612 --> 01:10:49,698
- Posting is fun. 
 - Faster, faster.

1002
01:10:52,909 --> 01:10:55,454
Really fun.

1003
01:11:03,378 --> 01:11:04,963
Are you okay?

1004
01:11:07,633 --> 01:11:09,301
I've never felt better.

1005
01:11:10,552 --> 01:11:12,554
Now I know why girls like horses.

1006
01:11:24,566 --> 01:11:25,859
Wait.

1007
01:11:27,236 --> 01:11:29,154
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

1008
01:11:31,448 --> 01:11:34,326
- It's cool. 
 - I'm sorry.

1009
01:11:35,118 --> 01:11:37,746
It's just that yesterday was 
 my first kiss...

1010
01:11:37,788 --> 01:11:40,499
and now you're practically 
 touching my breast.

1011
01:11:40,582 --> 01:11:42,876
At this rate, your dick will be 
 in my mouth by lunch.

1012
01:11:44,253 --> 01:11:45,838
Anyone for lunch?

1013
01:11:45,921 --> 01:11:48,090
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1014
01:11:48,173 --> 01:11:51,427
Listen, Danielle, we can take this 
 as slow as you want.

1015
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:54,221
I like you. 
 I've no need to rush things.

1016
01:11:54,304 --> 01:11:57,849
That's not my problem. 
 I want to rush things.

1017
01:11:57,933 --> 01:12:01,645
I'm tired of being the only virgin 
 in the sophomore class at Manchester.

1018
01:12:01,728 --> 01:12:06,233
Are you telling me that everyone 
 in the sophomore class has done it?

1019
01:12:06,316 --> 01:12:09,737
Well, it sure feels like it.

1020
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:14,450
I don't know. Ever feel 
 like you're at war with yourself?

1021
01:12:15,325 --> 01:12:18,370
- Constantly. 
 - I mean, there's one side of me...

1022
01:12:18,453 --> 01:12:23,750
that wants you to throw me down 
 right here and rip my clothes off.

1023
01:12:23,834 --> 01:12:29,089
Then there's this other side of me that 
 thinks I should wait till I'm married.

1024
01:12:29,173 --> 01:12:31,300
Which side should I choose, 
 Sebastian?

1025
01:12:31,341 --> 01:12:33,135
You really want me to answer that?

1026
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:35,429
Come on, be my friend.

1027
01:12:35,512 --> 01:12:38,056
Listen, Danielle...

1028
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,017
I know exactly 
 what you're going through.

1029
01:12:40,058 --> 01:12:43,061
We all have two sides. 
 I struggle with my dark side every day.

1030
01:12:43,145 --> 01:12:45,772
But that was the old me.

1031
01:12:45,856 --> 01:12:49,026
Believe it or not, 
 I have you to thank for it.

1032
01:12:49,109 --> 01:12:52,029
You showed me that it was okay 
 to be a decent person.

1033
01:12:52,112 --> 01:12:54,156
How dark was your past?

1034
01:12:55,324 --> 01:12:56,908
Pitch black.

1035
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:01,079
I'm thinking--

1036
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:05,918
I think 
 I'm falling in love with you.

1037
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:08,128
But I'm afraid to take the chance 
 to get hurt.

1038
01:13:08,212 --> 01:13:12,925
- I'm afraid of getting hurt too. 
 - Listen, let's make a pact.

1039
01:13:13,008 --> 01:13:16,512
We'll take it slow, 
 and we won't hurt each other.

1040
01:13:18,388 --> 01:13:20,891
God, we sound like 
 a cancelled television series.

1041
01:13:31,401 --> 01:13:33,028
You don't have to do this.

1042
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:35,698
I want to.

1043
01:13:39,743 --> 01:13:41,870
Hello?

1044
01:13:41,953 --> 01:13:44,706
Hi, Daddy. 
 I know, I'm running late.

1045
01:13:44,748 --> 01:13:47,709
Tell Aunt Gloria we can 
 still make the 2:00 mass.

1046
01:13:47,751 --> 01:13:51,505
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there. 
 I love you too.

1047
01:13:53,424 --> 01:13:56,552
- You gotta go? It's okay. 
 - Sorry. Call me later?

1048
01:13:56,593 --> 01:13:59,846
- Sure. 
 - Okay.

1049
01:14:01,973 --> 01:14:04,101
- Toodles. 
 - Bye-bye.

1050
01:14:06,061 --> 01:14:08,272
Oh, my balls.

1051
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:26,081
- Here's something you might like. 
 - Dolce.

1052
01:14:26,164 --> 01:14:29,376
How '98 of you. 
 Do you carry any real fur?

1053
01:14:29,459 --> 01:14:31,795
No, all of our fur is faux.

1054
01:14:31,879 --> 01:14:35,507
Of course. 
 The animals-- how silly of me.

1055
01:14:36,467 --> 01:14:37,718
I figured you'd be here.

1056
01:14:37,801 --> 01:14:40,262
- What's up? 
 - It's about Sebastian.

1057
01:14:40,345 --> 01:14:42,097
Give me the dirt.

1058
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,725
Your stepbrother has 
 quite the checkered past.

1059
01:14:44,808 --> 01:14:48,186
I mean, the fact that he was able to 
 pay off that overnight delivery guy...

1060
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:50,564
and switch his school file?

1061
01:14:50,647 --> 01:14:52,900
That's impressive 
 even by my standards.

1062
01:14:52,983 --> 01:14:56,028
- That's just the tip of the iceberg. 
 - Well done.

1063
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:57,613
Cash or charge?

1064
01:15:11,043 --> 01:15:13,295
- I'll be there in an hour. 
 - Sounds great.

1065
01:15:13,378 --> 01:15:15,297
The new James Van Der Beek film's 
 playing in town.

1066
01:15:15,339 --> 01:15:17,841
Perfect. 
 You're sure your dad won't mind?

1067
01:15:17,883 --> 01:15:21,720
No, he's out of town for the night. 
 It's just me and Mr. Whiskers.

1068
01:15:21,804 --> 01:15:26,975
- " Mr. Whiskers"? 
 - My pussy, silly.

1069
01:15:27,017 --> 01:15:30,062
Okay, well, I'll see you soon. 
 All right. Bye.

1070
01:15:32,147 --> 01:15:36,568
The school virgin's home alone with her 
 pussy, and I'm taking her to see Dawson.

1071
01:15:36,652 --> 01:15:39,363
God, I've become a total fag.

1072
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:47,579
- I guess I misjudged you. 
 - What are you talking about?

1073
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:53,001
How'd you get this?

1074
01:15:53,043 --> 01:15:55,462
I have my ways.

1075
01:15:55,546 --> 01:16:00,384
- Kathryn, I'm trying to start over-- 
 - Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, please.

1076
01:16:00,426 --> 01:16:03,929
Spare me any sob stories.

1077
01:16:04,012 --> 01:16:06,181
Oh, dear. 
 I guess something like this...

1078
01:16:06,223 --> 01:16:10,185
could destroy your 
 squeaky-clean reputation at Manchester.

1079
01:16:10,227 --> 01:16:14,731
And that school psychologist's report 
 about your mom-- it's too bad.

1080
01:16:14,815 --> 01:16:17,985
How will she pay for rehab when I tell 
 Mommy where some of her money's going?

1081
01:16:18,068 --> 01:16:21,405
- You're playing with fire, Kathryn. 
 - Poor Sebastian's mom is going to be...

1082
01:16:21,488 --> 01:16:23,866
homeless and eating leftovers 
 out of the garbage.

1083
01:16:23,907 --> 01:16:25,992
You don't know what I'm capable of.

1084
01:16:26,076 --> 01:16:28,537
Yes, I do.

1085
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,789
I read your file.

1086
01:16:30,872 --> 01:16:33,667
It turns me on.

1087
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,711
- Fuck off. 
 - Going to see Danielle?

1088
01:16:35,794 --> 01:16:38,046
Leave her out of it!

1089
01:16:39,798 --> 01:16:43,677
Looks like we've hit 
 a sensitive spot.

1090
01:16:43,761 --> 01:16:47,389
Do you really think 
 you can change, Sebastian?

1091
01:16:47,431 --> 01:16:51,977
Face it: 
 You and I are two of a kind.

1092
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,730
We're just not cut out 
 for good deeds.

1093
01:16:56,148 --> 01:16:58,150
I know the drill.

1094
01:16:58,233 --> 01:17:00,068
You'll date Danielle...

1095
01:17:00,152 --> 01:17:05,074
probably sleep with her after-- 
 what--you think eight months?

1096
01:17:05,115 --> 01:17:09,369
And then you'll get bored, 
 and you'll break her heart.

1097
01:17:09,453 --> 01:17:11,913
Why don't you 
 just spare her the pain?

1098
01:17:11,997 --> 01:17:14,249
And do what? 
 Date you?

1099
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:16,835
We could make a good team.

1100
01:17:18,962 --> 01:17:22,007
What do you plan on doing 
 with my file?

1101
01:17:22,091 --> 01:17:24,259
Do I sense a merger in the air?

1102
01:17:24,301 --> 01:17:25,761
Perhaps.

1103
01:17:27,888 --> 01:17:31,308
You do realize you're my stepsister.

1104
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,769
You know what they say about incest.

1105
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:39,942
Is there any line you won't cross?

1106
01:17:39,983 --> 01:17:44,530
Only one: 
 never in the butt.

1107
01:17:44,613 --> 01:17:46,949
That's a good line.

1108
01:17:48,408 --> 01:17:51,411
The Bradys never had it so good.

1109
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:05,300
- I can't do this. 
 - Not with your pants on.

1110
01:18:06,385 --> 01:18:09,054
- I gotta go. 
 - You fucking pussy!

1111
01:18:09,137 --> 01:18:11,306
- I gotta get outta this house. 
 - What, is this about Danielle?

1112
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:15,060
You don't understand, Kathryn. 
 I love her.

1113
01:18:15,143 --> 01:18:19,940
- You have a funny way of showing it. 
 - Fuck you. I won't let you corrupt me.

1114
01:18:20,023 --> 01:18:21,817
Don't you see? 
 You can't change.

1115
01:18:21,859 --> 01:18:25,738
- I can try. 
 - Well, you're gonna die trying.

1116
01:18:39,251 --> 01:18:41,795
- Hello? 
 - Hello, Danielle?

1117
01:19:06,403 --> 01:19:09,073
- Sebastian, you're soaking. 
 - We have to talk.

1118
01:19:09,156 --> 01:19:11,575
Well, come inside 
 before you catch yourself pneumonia.

1119
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:17,664
Here.

1120
01:19:17,748 --> 01:19:18,999
Thanks.

1121
01:19:21,585 --> 01:19:24,087
What's wrong?

1122
01:19:24,171 --> 01:19:26,632
I don't know, it's--

1123
01:19:26,715 --> 01:19:29,968
It's okay. 
 You can talk to me. Go slow.

1124
01:19:31,762 --> 01:19:36,058
I just-- 
 I feel like I'm losing it.

1125
01:19:36,099 --> 01:19:38,143
You know, I gotta get outta New York. 
 I gotta get outta school.

1126
01:19:38,226 --> 01:19:40,354
It's Kathryn, isn't it?

1127
01:19:40,437 --> 01:19:43,398
I don't think I can beat her.

1128
01:19:43,482 --> 01:19:47,027
Sebastian, do you believe 
 in a higher power?

1129
01:19:47,111 --> 01:19:51,281
- Yeah. 
 - Do you believe that love conquers all?

1130
01:19:51,365 --> 01:19:54,201
- Yes. 
 - Do you believe in our love?

1131
01:19:54,284 --> 01:19:56,411
Yeah. It's the only thing 
 keeping me together.

1132
01:19:56,453 --> 01:19:59,915
- So you believe in our love? 
 - Yes, I believe in our love.

1133
01:20:00,624 --> 01:20:02,417
'Cause I sure as hell don't.

1134
01:20:03,961 --> 01:20:05,754
What?

1135
01:20:08,173 --> 01:20:10,259
Fucking idiot.

1136
01:20:12,302 --> 01:20:13,595
Bravo.

1137
01:20:15,514 --> 01:20:19,434
- I told you I could do it. 
 - I should never have doubted you.

1138
01:20:28,193 --> 01:20:30,654
Don't tell me 
 you bought that virgin bullshit.

1139
01:20:30,696 --> 01:20:34,074
No, I saw you. 
 You were with your dad.

1140
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:35,867
What he doesn't know can't hurt him.

1141
01:20:35,951 --> 01:20:37,911
I am the headmaster's daughter.

1142
01:20:37,994 --> 01:20:40,956
Daddy's little angel must 
 keep up appearances.

1143
01:20:40,998 --> 01:20:45,794
- Holy fuck. 
 - Oh, don't be such a baby.

1144
01:20:45,836 --> 01:20:48,839
You didn't really think 
 you were gonna win, did you?

1145
01:20:48,881 --> 01:20:51,300
- You're welcome to join us. 
 - Hmm?

1146
01:20:51,341 --> 01:20:55,887
You know what they say: Two's company, 
 three's a fuck load of fun.

1147
01:21:02,853 --> 01:21:04,730
Well, if you can't beat 'em--

1148
01:21:04,813 --> 01:21:07,107
Who says you can't beat 'em?

1149
01:21:28,545 --> 01:21:31,340
Share and share alike.

1150
01:21:44,728 --> 01:21:48,941
Sebastian-- Now you'll have 
 something to write about. Danielle.

1151
01:21:59,743 --> 01:22:03,288
- Herzog. 
 - Oh, shit!

1152
01:22:13,966 --> 01:22:16,927
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

1153
01:22:16,969 --> 01:22:19,262
Oh, you really should try 
 to be more careful.

1154
01:22:19,346 --> 01:22:22,391
Thank you. 
 Oh, my bike!

1155
01:22:22,432 --> 01:22:24,726
Could we offer you a ride home?

1156
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:30,399
Sorry. My mom said I'm not allowed to 
 take rides from strangers. Oh, it's you.

1157
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,734
I was just going 
 to Danielle's house.

1158
01:22:34,987 --> 01:22:37,364
- I'll take care of the bike. 
 - Okay.

1159
01:22:41,076 --> 01:22:45,205
- Oh, thank you so much. I owe you huge. 
 - No problem.

1160
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:50,961
- It's Debbie, right? 
 - No, Cherie.

1161
01:22:51,044 --> 01:22:52,880
Whatever.

1162
01:22:52,963 --> 01:22:55,507
You know, Debbie, has anyone ever told 
 you : you could be a model?

1163
01:22:55,591 --> 01:22:57,551
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

1164
01:22:57,634 --> 01:23:01,263
- It's too bad you're not sexy. Really? 
 - Bull! I can be sexy. Uh-huh.

1165
01:23:02,472 --> 01:23:05,142
All right. 
 Show me sexy.

1166
01:23:09,146 --> 01:23:10,397
Very nice.

1167
01:23:15,486 --> 01:23:19,156
That's my special place. 
 Holy shit!
