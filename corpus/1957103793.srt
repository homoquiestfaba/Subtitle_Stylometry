- OH, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT, HUH?

273

- NO, SEE,
I'M JUST A SIMPLE BUSINESSMAN.

TO WATCH YOU PLAY, MAN.

ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?

296

- NO.

307
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,545
I ALREADY KNOW YOU'RE A COP.

308
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,780
THE QUESTION IS,
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

309
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,549
- WELL, LET'S SAY THAT, UH,

310

I'M GONNA FIND OUT
EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW.

312
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,456
PLAY THIS GAME?

313
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,360
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.

I, UM--
I READ A DISTURBING STORY

THE OTHER DAY
ABOUT THAT CHIEF OF POLICE

DOWN IN FLORIDA,
THE ONE THAT WAS MURDERED.

317
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,738
I IMAGINE IT'S NOT UNUSUAL
FOR MEN IN YOUR LINE OF WORK

318
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:46,973
TO MEET THAT TYPE OF FATE,

319
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,776
BUT THE WAY
THEY DISMEMBERED HIM

320
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,878
AND THEN HAD THE HEAD
SENT TO HIS WIFE...

321
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,813
THE MESSAGE THAT THAT SENDS,

322
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,716
IT'S, UH, VERY PROFOUND.

323
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,117
- YOU FINISHED?

324
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,622
- I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
AN INTERESTING MESSAGE.

325
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:07,059
- SO WHAT SORT OF MESSAGE
YOU TRYING TO SEND ME?

326
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,697
- LIFE IS PRECIOUS,
MY FRIEND.

327
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,800
- ONE SLIP
IS ALL IT'S GONNA TAKE.

328
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,505
ONE SLIP.

- THE CONVERSATION WE'RE
ABOUT TO HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.

- DO THEY EVER?

334
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:22,101
- WE DO NOT INVOLVE OURSELVES
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

335
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,470
THEY'RE ON ANOTHER LEVEL.

336
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,971

337
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,673
WHAT ARE YOU SAYIN'?
THEY'RE PROTECTED?

338
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,576
- DIVISION 123 WAS GROUPED
OUTSIDE THE FORCE, MIKE,

339
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,810
SO YOU COULD BEND THE RULES.

340

- EXACTLY.

341
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,746
- BUT YOU DON'T
BEND THE RULES, MIKE.

342
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,815
YOU BREAK THEM.
AND WE DON'T EXIST, REMEMBER?

343
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:39,151
I'VE WORKED DAMN HARD
TO EARN THE TITLE OF COMMANDER,

344
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,688
AND I WON'T PUT THAT ON THE LINE
FOR ANYBODY, MIKE,

I'M NOT GONNA JEOPARDIZE HER.

873
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:25,082
I'M NOT GONNA JEOPARDIZE
THIS CASE.

874
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:27,117
SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU
ONE TIME, MAN.

875
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:28,252
CAN YOU HANDLE THIS SHIT?

876
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,157
- I CAN HANDLE IT.

877
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,159
I THINK YOU
SHOULD BE ASKIN' HER THAT.

878
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,394
- IT'S MY BUSINESS.

879
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,029
- OKAY.

880
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,197
I'M GOOD.

881
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,698
- GOOD.

882
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:05,422
TALK TO ME.

883
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:13,197
- I SLEPT WITH VEGA.

884
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,434
- I KNOW.

885
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:21,438
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

886
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,811
- IT'S MY JOB.

887
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,084
- AND YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THAT?

888
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,423
- NOW, YOU KNOW
WHAT I SAY, CASSIDY.

889
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:41,959
FUCK THE RULES
AND THOSE WHO WROTE 'EM.

890
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:50,367
- I HEARD ANTONIO
TALKING TO DIEGO AND CATALINA

891
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,104
LIKE YACONELLI
WAS A TROPHY KILL.

892
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:02,880
HE SAID HE SQUEALED LIKE A PIG
WHEN HE CUT OFF HIS NIPPLE.

893
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:10,320
THEN HE LAUGHED,

894
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:13,858
AND HE SAID HE WANTED TO KEEP IT
AS A SOUVENIR.

895
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:20,831
- I'M GONNA PULL YOU OUT.

896
01:03:28,005 --> 01:03:29,239
YOU DID GOOD.

897
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:47,191
- WE'RE HERE TO SEE MR. VEGA.

898
01:03:47,224 --> 01:03:48,893
- DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

899
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:50,627
- DON'T NEED ONE.

900
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,462
- MAY I POUR YOU GENTLEMEN
SOMETHING SPECIAL?

901
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:54,031
- YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

902
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:55,465
WE'RE ON DUTY.
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

903
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,067
- I'LL HAVE
WHAT YOU'RE HAVIN'.

904
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:09,213
- PLEASE,
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

905
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:10,647
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS VISIT, HUH?

906
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,149

907
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,251
TO PLAY 18 HOLES OF GOLF
WITH US ON SUNDAY.

908
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,353
YOU AVAILABLE?

909
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:18,188
- I'M SORRY, GENTLEMEN.
I DON'T PLAY GOLF.

910
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:19,856
- NEITHER DO WE.

911
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:22,259
- I SEE.

912
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:31,902
- CATALINA ISLAND.

913
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:33,070
WHAT IS IT, GENE?

914
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,538
"26 MILES ACROSS THE SEA,

YOU LIKE TO FISH?

919
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:44,915
- WHAT?

920
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:47,151
- NEITHER DO I.

921
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:48,652
I WONDER IF, UH,

922
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:50,620
ERIC CARTER LIKED TO FISH.

923
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:56,226
THE NAME STEVE YACONELLI
RING A BELL?

924
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:59,163
HE'S A COP THAT WORKED FOR US.

925
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:01,431
DEAD, MISSING PART
OF HIS ANATOMY.

926
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:03,400
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

927
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:05,169
NAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

928
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:08,372
HEY, GINO,
THINK STEVE LIKED TO FISH?

929
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:12,309
YOU SEE, I GET SEASICK,
THE INNER EAR THING.

930
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:14,444
COULDN'T STAND RIDING
THOSE FUCKIN' TEACUPS

931
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:15,712
WHEN I WAS A KID.

932
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,681
SAME THING
WITH THE MERRY-GO-ROUNDS.

933
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:20,084
I THINK I'D LIKE FISHIN', GENE,

01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:21,718
IF I DIDN'T GET
SO FUCKIN' SICK.

935
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,353
I HATE PUKING,

01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:24,688
BUT I LOVE CATCHIN' SHIT.

937
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:27,324

- MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TRY
BOWLING SOMETIME.

948
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:03,227
EVERY MAN NEEDS
SOME FUCKIN' FUN IN HIS LIFE.

949
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,728
- I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, MARINO.

950
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:05,695
- COUNT ON IT.

951
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:32,489
YOU IDIOT.

[siren wailing]

953
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,478
- SO HOW ARE THINGS GOING
WITH, UH--WITH PAM?

954
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,480
- DON'T YOU EVER SHUT UP
ABOUT THAT?

01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:57,714
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WOMEN?

956
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:59,749
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOLEIL.

01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,638
- WHAT'S THE DAMAGE?
- WILSON'S GOOD.

990
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:10,640
HIS WIFE JUST CAME
AND TOOK HIM HOME.

991
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:12,509
AND MARINO ACTUALLY
DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD

992
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,778
CONSIDERING HE JUST HAD THE CRAP
KICKED OUT OF HIM.

993
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:16,713
- IS HE CONSCIOUS?
- HE'S CONSCIOUS.

994
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,582
LIKE ALWAYS,
HE'S NOT SAYIN' SHIT.

995
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:19,749
- HOW ABOUT WILSON?

996
01:10:19,783 --> 01:10:21,585
- HE GAVE THE NAME
OF THE DECEASED

997
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:22,652
AS FLAGMAN.

998
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:24,688
- AND THAT'S IT?
- NOPE.

999
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,590
WE GOT A HELL OF A MESS
AT THE CRIME SCENE,

01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:37,301
THE FACIAL LACERATIONS
AND CONTUSIONS ARE NO BIG DEAL.

1005
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:38,768
THE NURSE WILL HELP YOU
FINISH YOUR PAPERWORK,

AND YOU'LL BE GOOD TO GO.

1007

1009
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,332
- I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE.

1010
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:22,512
- I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU END UP
ON AN AUTOPSY TABLE, MIKE.

1011
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:24,914
I CAN HAVE ANTONIO VEGA
PICKED UP RIGHT NOW

1012
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:28,017

1015
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:43,600
YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

1016
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:46,035
- CAN YOU CUT ME SOME SLACK
HERE, JUAN?

1017
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:48,605
- CAN'T DO IT, NICK.
IT'S BUSINESS.

1018
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:53,977
- HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I SAVED YOUR LIFE?

1019
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,645
- CATALINA SAYS
YOU GOT TO GO.

1020
01:11:57,414 --> 01:11:58,682
YOU LOOK HALF DEAD ANYWAYS.

1021
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:00,850

1029
01:12:20,404 --> 01:12:22,038
- TAKE A HIKE, SKID MARK.

1030
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:23,740
- YO, MAN, YOU BETTER NOT
BE WASTING OUR TIME.

1031
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:25,409
- YO, WHO THE FUCK'S

1032
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:27,444
SHIT AIN'T PART OF DEAL, BRO.
YOU KNOW THAT.

1033
01:12:27,477 --> 01:12:28,812
- OSCAR, CUT THE SHIT.

01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,847
TELL US WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR.

1035
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,916

01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:36,620
YOU SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT,

1044
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:52,569

1045
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:53,837
- YO, HE AIN'T WORTH

1046
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,639
