[music playing]

2
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:57,126
- I always knew we
had home movies,

3
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:58,817
and I always knew
we had scrapbooks,

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,405
and that my mother
was like a pack rat

5
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,821
and never threw anything away.

6
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:07,446
But interestingly enough, thehome movies that we saw as kids

7
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,483
were usually the
ones we were in.

8
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:14,143
It was a surprise to see
so much footage that,

9
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:17,111
as they say on TV, "never beforeseen" footage, never before

10
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:19,009
seen even by me.

11
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:23,290
It's taken us about three yearsto look through the scrapbooks

12
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:27,225
and research tapes, and
then find all the people

13
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:28,398
and do all the interviews.

14
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:33,783
And I wanted people to seethis side of my parents.

15
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,440
Because it was
the personal side.

16
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:38,167
And even without
sound, the pictures

17
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,999
say so much about who theywere and the joy that they had.

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,623
And some of them show fearsthat they had, and the shyness.

19
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,832
[music playing, "without you"][SINGING] I'm so lonely

20
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:55,253
and blue, when I'm without you.

21
00:01:55,356 --> 00:02:03,330
I don't know what I'd do,sweetheart, without you.

22
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:07,506
The joy and tears
that love endears

23
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,959
would have no
meaning if I didn't

24
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:18,310
have you to keep me dreaming.

25
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:26,042
At the close of a day
when I'm without you.

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:34,637
And my heart kneels to
pray, I pray about you.

27
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:42,231
You take a star and lead
it far away from heaven

28
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:48,478
and the start will be lostas I'm lost without you.

[music playing, "without you"][SINGING] [singing in spanish]

30
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:54,303
- There was a film that cameout around the same time I was

31
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:55,683
looking at the tapes...

32
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:58,341
It was...

33
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:00,619
It exploited their worst faults.

34
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:04,520
And it didn't explainmuch about them as people.

35
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:07,074
It didn't even get the historyright of the "I Love Lucy"

36
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:09,179
shows being created.

37
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,905
And I thought there
must be a better way.

38
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:13,114
There must be a way to
show these two people,

39
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:15,531
and be more realistic, andhave more fun watching it.

40
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:18,775
But also, answer
some questions--

41
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,261
what made her happy?

42
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:23,953
What was Lucy afraid of?

43
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,990
Was she bitter?

44
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:29,924
Did she miss him?

45
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:32,893
Did Desi miss her?

46
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:36,621
Why couldn't they stay married?

47
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:39,175
I was often surprised
by people's candor

48
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,211
and how much they were
willing to tell me,

49
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,352
almost as if they hadbottled it up for so long

50
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:46,665
and they were so glad
somebody finally asked.

51
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,944
People who are never
asked about my parents,

52
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:51,394
people who worked
with them, people

53
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:52,947
who were in the
dressing room all day

54
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:57,331
long, who must know a lot more,and Uncle Fred, and Aunt Cleo,

55
00:04:57,435 --> 00:04:59,782
and Cousin Pam, and
people who were there

56
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,024
when we were growing up.

57
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:03,406
And I didn't do it becausethey're a famous family.

58
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,961
I did it because I think
family history is just

59
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,895
a fascinating thing to study,why people do what they do,

60
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:15,729
and how the circle goes on, andthat things just don't happen.

61
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:17,144
- What is this all about?

62
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:18,594
Of course, it was
about recovery.

63
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:20,699
It's about spiritual recovery.

64
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:23,081
It was about finding
that relationship that

65
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:26,740
was true in a
family, and wanting

66
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:32,849
to see if there was such a thingas a loving, happy, lasting

67
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:34,299
life.

68
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:46,276
[music playing, "without you"][singing in spanish] I'm lost

69
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,796
without you.

70
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,214
- I think sometimes
we remember things

71
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:56,390
all blown up out of proportion,either too good or too bad.

72
00:05:56,494 --> 00:06:00,601
I'm trying to put things backinto perspective so there'll

73
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:06,883
be some objectiveviewpoint about this family

74
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:10,093
that I can give to my kids.

75
00:06:10,197 --> 00:06:14,097
And they also happen to
be sort of well-known,

76
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:16,893
so maybe you'll enjoy it, too.

77
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:19,862
[music playing]

78
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:26,627
- She was always a goer.

79
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:29,596
Whatever group she was
in, she was in charge.

80
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,529
- I mean, she could
always entertain,

81
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:34,014
and she could always
get an audience.

82
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:38,536
We'd go to a party
and she was it.

83
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,815
She had the part of somekind of a dancing Indian.

84
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:43,472
She got carried
away with her part.

85
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:46,406
She got so intense with it,she didn't know where she was

86
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,925
and she ended up in
the orchestra pit.

87
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,859
- I think that people
who have known her

88
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,827
and love to talk
about her are people

89
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,763
who have not realized the depthof her suffering in her life.

90
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:03,043
They have taken it for grantedthat she was always a clown.

91
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,700
I mean, they haven't
studied clowns.

92
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,495
They don't know that
clowns generally

93
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:09,463
have a very bad personal life.

94
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,776
There's always big,
big holes in it.

95
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,192
And there certainly
was in Lucille's life.

96
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,780
- Where did you come
from originally?

97
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:16,953
- I'm from Jamestown, New York.

98
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:18,058
- And how did you get here?

99
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:19,404
I mean, did you--

100
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:20,819
- I walked.

101
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:21,820
- No.

102
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:22,856
- Yes, I did.

103
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,237
I hitchhiked from Jamestown.

104
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:26,963
- She knew Jamestown
wasn't for her.

105
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:29,034
She was just so differentfrom all the other girls

106
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:31,416
around there.

107
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,314
- Her life was, I
don't think, very

108
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:34,695
happy when she was a child.

109
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,353
And I never knew thatbecause she told me all about

110
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,219
how beautiful Jamestown was,and the change of seasons

111
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:42,841
was what I heard about.

112
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:46,707
- That's where your mother'slove of Courier and Ives

113
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:49,330
was, those prints.

114
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,057
Because the lake froze
over in the winter time

115
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:56,510
and you ice skated andgrandpa built a toboggan.

116
00:07:56,614 --> 00:07:59,996
- I, of course, before Istarted this exploration,

117
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,274
never knew the answers
to any of the questions

118
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:05,139
about why my mother
worked the way she did,

119
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:06,831
or what was she
running from, or even

120
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,971
the fact that she was running.

121
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:11,214
But now, after having talkedto some of these people

122
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:15,805
and listened to tapes andreread interviews with people,

123
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:20,879
I think it was an inbredthing in her, first of all.

124
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,709
She came from a
family of people who

125
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:27,299
had been through great tragedy,great poverty, a lot of death.

126
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:30,544
- Everyone knows that if alittle girl loses her father

127
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:32,615
when she's young, it
has a terrible effect

128
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,030
on her the rest of her life.

129
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:36,930
- Your mother was not
yet four years old

130
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,933
and DeDe was pregnant
with Freddie.

131
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:45,214
And her young husband, hecontracted typhoid fever.

132
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:49,632
And I don't know how long aperiod he was ill, but he died.

133
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:52,083
- My father died
before I was born.

134
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:55,742
So mother's father, mygrandfather, he brought us up.

135
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:59,884
Grandpa Hunt was of course
the patriarchal figure.

136
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:04,026
It was his home in which
we were all raised.

137
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:07,616
And he, of course, had a greatdeal of influence on all of us.

138
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,169
He was the daddy figure.

139
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:11,447
- He was a benevolent despot.

140
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,967
That is, he ruled thefamily and everybody in it.

141
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,971
But while he was deeply lovedby his family, and, of course,

142
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:22,389
called daddy, he was notpopular around the village,

143
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:25,116
mainly, of course,because of his affiliation

144
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:26,669
with the socialist party.

145
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:29,499
- Grandfather always hadleanings towards the working

146
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,500
man.

147
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,606
Because after all,
he was a working man

148
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,610
before there were unions toprotect them or anything else.

149
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:38,647
- We didn't play.

150
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,959
We worked.

151
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:45,067
And Lucy and I and Cleo,we took care of the house,

152
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,070
including animals and chickens
and pigs and so forth.

153
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:51,487
- Her mother worked, and
they were out evenings,

154
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,213
and Lucille was on her own.

155
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:54,594
That was all there was to life.

156
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:57,286
She was a non-existent
mother, you might say.

157
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,737
She'd just come up maybe
on Sunday or something.

158
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,807
- Her mother wasn't there.

159
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,084
I didn't know that.

160
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:04,811
I didn't know that DeDewasn't there all the time.

161
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:07,089
When I grew up,
DeDe was "St. DeDe."

162
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:10,471
She was so needed, and wanted,and loved in our family.

163
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:13,578
She was the most lovedperson in our whole family.

164
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:16,029
And it's hard for me
to believe that DeDe

165
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:18,169
would leave her childrenalone for those long stretches

166
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:19,308
of time.

167
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,758
She went away for a
year or two or something

168
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:23,277
with her second husband.

169
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:26,833
- Ed did not, very frankly,want to be a stepfather.

170
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:28,835
He didn't want to be
held down by children.

171
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:30,043
He wanted a young wife.

172
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:31,354
He wanted to party.

173
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,287
And so they had toquestion, "Well, what are we

174
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,530
going to do with Lucille?"

175
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,222
And so they thought theobvious answer was put her

176
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:39,328
with Grandma Peterson.

177
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:43,504
She never told me that
she missed her father

178
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:47,439
being with her or that sheresented her mother abandoning

179
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:49,234
her, as you might say.

180
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:52,824
But I know that these were very,very traumatic things for her.

181
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:55,033
- My grandmother
DeDe was somethin'.

182
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:57,726
She was a real no-nonsensekind of person.

183
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:00,590
DeDe always used to tell me,she said, "I married Ed Peterson

184
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,592
because he wore nice hats.

185
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:06,148
But he didn't like my kidsand he drank so we left him."

186
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:10,635
But then they all had to moveback in with Grandpa Hunt.

187
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:14,087
- My grandfather used to takeus to vaudeville every Saturday.

188
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,329
I grew to love it.

189
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,677
So all I knew is I wantedto be in vaudeville

190
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,161
and I wanted to
make people laugh.

191
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,784
I certainly didn't want tomake them cry, you know?

192
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:25,892
- Celoron Park, that was avery important part of my life

193
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:29,309
and Lucy's life, too.

194
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:31,829
- It was just a wonderful,wonderful place.

195
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:34,038
Oh, and that big Phoenix Wheel?

196
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:37,973
And of course we would go tothe theater when we could.

197
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:39,560
Lucille, of course,
had more freedom

198
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:40,665
than any of the rest of us.

199
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:43,426
- Oh, she was full
of hell all the time.

200
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,121
- Her reputation wasthat she was a wild girl.

201
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:51,331
- I ran away from home so manytimes that my mother finally

202
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:54,265
said, "Well, that's
it, I've had it."

203
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:55,473
- And you came to New York?

204
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,233
- So she sent me to a
dramatic school here,

205
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,821
and they kept me
about three months.

206
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,374
And they said,
"You've got nothing,

207
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:02,238
go home and get
married or something."

208
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:03,653
Really!

209
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:07,381
And I went back to
school for a while.

210
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:08,728
[gunshot]

211
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:13,249
- It was the tragedy thatbroke up the whole home life

212
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:17,184
and sent everyone in
different directions.

213
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:24,709
And it happened that Grandpa wasin possession of a .22 rifle.

214
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:26,746
- And we were target practicing.

215
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:31,647
And this girlfriend of minehad the rifle, aimed it,

216
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,580
and the little
Erickson boy, who was

217
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:36,963
sitting on the ground,the neighbor, jumped up--

218
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:40,863
Just as Ruth shot the gun.

219
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:44,625
And the bullet lodged
right in his spine.

220
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:49,009
- The child was paralyzedfor life and in a wheelchair.

221
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:50,942
- Grandpa was charged.

222
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:55,636
- And he was held responsiblefor allowing minors

223
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,949
to shoot a gun.

224
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:01,504
- As a result of that, Grandpalost the house, and everything,

225
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:04,507
and every dime that they had.

226
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,613
- My mother saw what
happened to the family,

227
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:10,893
and especially to her
daddy, to Grandpa Hunt.

228
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:13,240
I think that she felt
now it was up to her

229
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,898
to bring the whole familyback together again.

230
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:18,038
So she went back to New
York for a few years

231
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:21,317
where she could get
work as a model.

232
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:22,905
- I became a model
so I could eat.

233
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,838
And I was a good model.

234
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:26,944
And I worked at
Hattie Carnegie's.

the photographer in Jamestown.

238
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:42,235
He made the famous last
words, when he said,

239
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:44,927
It was very difficult to geta satisfactory picture of Miss

240

Ball because the young ladyjust is not photogenic."

241
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:53,384
- Then Mr. Goldwyn
needed some poster girls

242
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:55,524
for "Roman Scandals."

243
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,802
And I was walking down
the street one day,

244
00:13:57,906 --> 00:14:00,770
and this lady, who was anagent, said, "How would you

245

like to go to California?"

246
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:04,464
And I said, "Now?"

247
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,397
And she said, "Saturday."

248
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,847
That was a Wednesday.

249
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,779
I said, "Well, what wouldI do in California?"

250
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,542
And she said, "I just camefrom the Sam Goldwyn office.

that we'll all be together.

and stay in Hollywood.

to the studio to have lunch.

348
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:10,010
And I walk into the
commissary at RKO,

349
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:12,668
and I mean, there at onetable was Katherine Hepburn,

350
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,670
and there was Cary Grant.

351
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:16,810
- She picked me up
at the downtown bus

352
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:19,019
station in Los Angeles.

353
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:22,575
And she was driving
a Buick convertible,

354
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:28,305
and she gave me the wildestride I've ever had in my life.

355
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:30,583
- And I had this big
conga drum with me.

356
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:34,552
Now, in Cuba, everybody lovesthe conga at carnival time,

357
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:35,726
particularly in my hometown.

358
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:37,762
It's like the Mardi
Gras in New Orleans.

359
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:40,179
Everybody from theisland comes to Santiago,

360
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:41,387
and they do the conga line.

361
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,424
It goes on for three days.

362
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:45,874
[music playing]

363
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:50,361
He himself, in 1940, at
the Conga Night Club,

364
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:54,089
he introduced the conga
from Cuba on Broadway.

365
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,438
- He was wonderful!

366
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,993
Desi Arnaz had one of the greatpersonalities of all time.

367
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,893
When he started pounding
those conga drums...

368
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,964
There was nobody like Desi.

369
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:10,657
- New York in those dayswas very innocent and very

370
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,107
exciting to be a part of.

371
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,936
The El Morocco, the
Stork Club Group--

372
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,145
your father was the
toast of the town.

373
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,492
- He was a Don Juan.

374
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:20,426
I think he loved to think allthe girls were mad for him.

375
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:23,083
And actually they were!

376
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:26,363
His problem was
getting rid of them.

377
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:29,331
- So while my father was doingfive shows a night in New York,

378
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,333
my mother was making fiveor six pictures a year

379
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:34,129
in Hollywood at RKO
as a contract player.

380
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,649
- Tell me, little boy, did youget whistle or a baseball bat

381
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,340
with that suit?

382
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:41,309
- I was very happy witheverything that went on at RKO.

383
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:43,863
Everything that they
gave me, I did happily.

384
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:46,279
Ooh, Ferdinand.

385
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:52,837
Come to mama.

386
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:54,114
- The other models are waiting.

387
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:55,254
Shall I send them in, too?

388
00:20:55,357 --> 00:20:57,048
- No, no, you'd better
give this one the job

389
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:58,187
if she's that desperate.

390
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,188
- Oh, but I--

391
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,052
- Dismiss the others.

392
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:04,884
All right, take
your clothes off.

393
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:06,334
- Just a minute, Casanova.

394
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:08,681
I'm only offering you what youcan get through those straws.

395
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:15,101
- Lucy was very popular.

396
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:16,309
Very popular.

397
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:19,312
And she met lots of peoplegrowing up in Hollywood.

398
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:29,253
And I remember Mack
Grey in particular.

399
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:32,912
She went with Mack
for quite a long time.

400
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:34,327
And also Al Hall.

401
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:37,123
- Al Hall was a very prominentdirector at that time.

402
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:41,921
And she was associated withAl for at least five years.

403
00:21:42,024 --> 00:21:44,958
And when she saw Desi...

404
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:47,858
That's what broke it up.

405
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:50,136
- I was doing "Too Many
Girls" in New York.

406
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,689
I mean, that was the
name of the play.

407
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:54,313
- Yes, yes.

408
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,867
The show was a great success.

409
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,077
And RKO bought the film rights.

410
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,356
- And we started
shooting at RKO.

411
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,738
Little did we know your motherwas going to own it one day,

412
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:07,015
and daddy.

413
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,914
But it was a sweet studio.

414
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,399
Everybody was happy.

415
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:13,849
Orson Welles was
shooting "Citizen Kane."

416
00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:16,231
Charlie Laughton, Lupe Velez.

417
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,234
Irene Dunne was shooting
and "Joan of Paris"

418
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,373
with Michele Morgan.

419
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:25,378
And every stage, every
lot had some activity.

420
00:22:25,482 --> 00:22:29,451
And when we did the bongonumber-- we, your father,

421
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:30,866
Desi and I--

422
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,387
Carole Lombard used to come overevery time there was a break.

423
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:36,285
She was attracted by
the sound of the bongos

424
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,873
because it was a
terrific arrangement.

425
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:40,359
You can imagine the excitement.

426
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:43,154
- Desi and myself
were rehearsing

427
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:47,020
"Too Many Girls" on a big soundstage and Lucille came on.

428
00:22:47,124 --> 00:22:50,092
- And she came in with
a very lovely pair

429
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:56,098
of yellow slacks and a tansweater, and blonde hair--

430
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:57,099
she was a blonde then--

431
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:05,832
and those big
beautiful blue eyes.

432
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:09,422
And I said to the pianoplayer, I said, "Oh, man,

433
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:11,390
that's a hunk of woman!"

434
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:12,494
- Will someone please come?

435
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:13,944
There's a waiter
fainted out here.

436
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:16,015
- You realize she
had never married.

437
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:18,224
Her career had absorbed
her whole life.

438
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:20,226
She was now 30.

439
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:25,300
And when she saw Desi,
she just came home,

440
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,647
and she said, "That's it.

441
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:29,684
That's for me."

442
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:37,001
- I said, "Are you
doing anything tonight?"

443
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:41,316
I said if you don't have
anything to do tonight,

444
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,628
how would you like to do--

445
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:43,801
to learn how to do the rumba?

446
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,944
- It was a big
romance from day one.

447
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:52,327
They just took one look, andit was like instant kiss dolls,

448
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,535
you know, instant love.

449
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:54,536
- It was like that.

450
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,124
It was very exciting to watch.

451
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,333
- I can remember, I
have a picture of them

452
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,441
sitting at a table
for two near a window.

453
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:05,892
And I sent over word, "Goahead, come on and join us now."

454
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:08,101
And the word came back, well,never mind they were all

455
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:09,862
seated, they'd stay there.

456
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:12,174
And they stayed there
for the rest of the run.

457
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,384
It was really love
at fist sight.

458
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,697
- They were dating.

459
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,838
But he was also dating LanaTurner and Betty Grable.

460
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:23,289
Her competition was pretty good!

461
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:25,705
- She just told me she wasmadly in love with Desi.

462
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,087
And it was just
Desi, Desi, Desi.

463
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,124
- And then the picture was over.

464
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:33,575
Now he goes back to New York.

465
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,613
She found reasons
to be able to have--

466
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:38,477
RKO, to go back, do publicity.

467
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,272
She'd do anything theywanted, as long as it was back

468
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:42,722
in New York.

469
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:45,967
- I was working at theRoxy Theater in New York.

470
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,349
And she was in New
York, and she was

471
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:55,079
giving an interview about why wewere not going to get married.

472
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:58,773
I said, "This lady is
not going to come across

473
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:01,741
with this article
very good because I'd

474
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:05,055
marry you tomorrow."
She said, "Why?"

475
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:07,126
I says, "I want kids.

476
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:08,645
And I love you."

477
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:09,956
So we got married the next day.

478
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,027
- It didn't take long to do it.

479
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:15,997
And we got the call that theyhad eloped to Connecticut.

480
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,621
- All the women were mad forhim, but your mother got him.

481
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:22,624
[music playing] [SINGING]Now is the right time,

482
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:24,833
let's make it stay.

483
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:27,456
'Cause you're the
one that I pray for.

484
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,494
- He loved the whole
family thing, of course,

485
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:34,636
because he too was in
exile from his roots.

486
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,226
And here he walks
into a family scene.

487
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,160
This isn't just an
actress in Hollywood,

488
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:43,300
but she has a mother
and a grandfather

489
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:45,992
and sisters and
brothers and a home.

490
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:47,822
[music playing] [SINGING]Your name and mine

491
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:53,552
have been written in the stars,made for each other, like sun

492
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:55,243
and sky.

493
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:59,696
We'll have each
other as years go by.

494
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,631
We'll share together the
dreams that you and I

495
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:07,842
make for each other.

496
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:14,227
- I don't know but she,I think, loved Desi Arnaz

497
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:19,439
more than any famous
lovers in history.

498
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:23,098
There was a passionate
involvement between her

499
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:27,862
and this man that was so
deep that it scared me.

500
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:30,243
It was as if she could
not live without him.

501
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:35,421
She couldn't stand to be nearhim and not to touch him.

502
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:40,875
Oh, one night-- she adoredhis singing, his act.

503
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:43,498
Whenever they'd have a party,you wound up with a concert,

504
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,018
you know?
Desi's got to be on.

505
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:50,816
One night at the Desilu Ranch,they had a big barbecue.

506
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,577
And when finally we
finished the dinner

507
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:57,029
and sat down around the livingroom with the fire going,

508
00:26:57,132 --> 00:27:00,239
Desi sits in his
chair with his guitar

509
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,724
and Lucy leaves the
room for a minute.

510
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:08,143
And when she came back,
she had a tray full

511
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:11,146
of little red votive
candle holders

512
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,424
with the candles all lit.

513
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:16,082
And she started putting
them around Desi

514
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:18,429
as if they were footlights.

515
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:21,812
And she just sat there
and looked at him.

516
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:25,264
She just worshipped this man.

517
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:26,748
[music playing]

518
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:02,922
Chatsworth was reallytheir ideal, their heaven,

519
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:04,544
Lucy and Desi's.

520

Everything about the place was--

521

now, they were so much in love.

522
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:15,624
This is their first home.

523
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:25,186
- It was the most hospitable,warm, happy house.

524
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,706
- Parties were always going on.

525
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:32,572
And he built little pavilionsand barbecues and things

526
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:36,818
that reminded him of Cuba.

527
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,889

that garden digging

528
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:42,134

533
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:56,804
in Chatsworth at the
place I was born.

534
00:28:56,907 --> 00:28:59,668
And I was astoundedbecause in the later years,

those later years, when
I was seven and eight,

they didn't seem
real happy together.

537
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,677
But all of the sudden, therewas this footage of the two

538
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:13,337
of them snuggling and beingsilly and throwing snowballs

539

dressing up in costume,

546
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:40,364
That was the most
beautiful swimming pool.

547
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:43,643
It was like an old swimminghole with a tree trunk,

548
00:29:43,747 --> 00:29:45,300
with the diving board over it.

549
00:29:45,404 --> 00:29:46,957
Was I ever that young?

And just as you can see, justhad a lovely, lovely time.

And they would
have great parties

And the parties were
his prerogative.

560
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:21,923
I mean, he would plan them.He would invite.

561
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:22,993
He would do the cooking.

562
00:30:23,097 --> 00:30:24,892
Of course, he was
visited constantly

563
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:29,551
by this crazy group of NewYorkers from the Conga Club.

The public went for
Lucy, of course.

But at home, Desi was the star.

He took over.

He was so charming that,you know, he exuded warmth.

Those brown eyes and
that face and always

00:31:11,214 --> 00:31:14,355
She wasn't witty.

00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,529
She didn't make bon mots.

575
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:19,808
She was a very serious woman.

576
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,501
- Lucy was always
very quiet, really.

577
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:27,264
She-- Lucy would make acomment every now and then,

578
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:29,715
but Desi took over.

579
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:31,786

about him, of coming

580
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,306
into a room, that was joyous.

581
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:38,137
He had a joy of
living about him.

582
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:41,347
- So they had this
idyllic place.

583
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:44,523
And they indulged
themselves with dogs.

584
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:46,974
And they had Cocker Spaniels.

- Oh, she loved puppies.

586
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,082
If it wasn't for
Desi, she'd have

587
00:31:52,186 --> 00:31:53,981
had a yard full of
puppies, I think.

588
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:57,294
- They had a cow.

00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:01,333
You've heard about her,the Duchess of Devonshire.

From a little calf,
it grew, and it grew,

591
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:09,272

grievous fault.

695
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:58,146
- During that war, they had whatthey called the Victory Caravan

696
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,908
Tour, where all the big
Hollywood stars would go

697
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,980
out and try and sell war bonds.

698
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:07,949
- I knew Desi and met himon the Victory Caravan.

699
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:09,986
And Desi was some
kind of character.

700
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:12,022
We were having so much
fun selling bonds.

701
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:14,473
We started in Washington.

702
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:21,273
And I never forget, Groucho gotin a cab with Mrs. Roosevelt.

703
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:23,171
And Charlotte Greenwood
stepped off the plane

704
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:26,140
and did the high kick, and henudged Mrs. Roosevelt, said,

705
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,211
"You could do that too ifyou put your mind to it."

706
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:35,287
Imagine saying this tothe First Lady, you know?

707
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:38,152
- The first picture
that I ever made

708

I'm happy for the
first time in my life.

712
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:54,202
- She was wonderful in it,and she was very proud of it.

713
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:56,135
And that let me
know that she always

714
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,932
considered herself a seriousactress, not just a comedian.

715
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,143
- That did it, Pink.

716
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:08,803

And he's saying, "Christ'ssake, what'd you eat for lunch?"

723
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:36,797
- Well, best picture ornot, it didn't make a dime

724
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,730
and RKO dropped her contract.

725
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,973
Luckily, though, she
signed on with MGM.

726
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:42,699
- Well, I don't mind
the band playing.

727
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:46,324
But if this crowd doesn'tstop shoving, I'll scream.

good look at herself.

And she said, "I'm 33 years old.

I'm just another
Hollywood blonde."

733
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:02,098
And she decided to
change her image.

[music playing]

735
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:12,419

- Maybe that's my poor guy.

742
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:34,717
- Maybe not a big-timeactress, at least Hollywood was

743
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,478
beginning to call my mother,
"That Crazy Redhead."

744
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:40,136
- Lucille Ball!

745
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,310
- Unfortunately, Hollywoodwasn't calling my father

747
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:46,625

I don't know what I'd do,sweetheart, without you.

756
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:47,237
The joy and tears
that love endears

759
00:40:57,903 --> 00:40:59,180

to one another

761
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:03,322

And my mother saved
every single one of 'em.

"Lucy, sweetheart,

- I don't know.

780

Because I don't remembera time that wasn't tough.

By that I mean that hisindiscretions were always

- He fooled around withother ladies, apparently.

784
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:19,606
And he'd tell me
till his dying day

785

that he didn't fool aroundthe way they said he did,

786

that they made a bigger thingout of some of his flirtations

than what was really going on.

788
00:42:28,684 --> 00:42:31,169
- A lot of ladies kind ofthrew themselves at him,

789
00:42:31,272 --> 00:42:34,862
and men are men, or at
least Latins are Latins.

790
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:38,659
And he succumbed to some
of these little affairs.

791
00:42:38,763 --> 00:42:45,459
- She told me the first timewhen she knew that he was

792

wished he weren't.

- But he had never had anintention of hurting her.

795
00:43:02,718 --> 00:43:06,825
He never wanted to hurt
her, and did constantly.

796
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:09,828
- When they were together,Desi and Lucy, they

797

798
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:16,835

Shortly after that, shedecided to file for divorce.

00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:01,439
- She certainly built
up a wall against it.

865
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:02,785
I guess repetition.

866
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:05,892
And then she didn't say itso vulnerably after a while.

867
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:09,930
And she would say, "Oh,
he's with another dame."

868
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:11,690
- Oh, Andrew, if
you're tired of me

869
00:47:11,794 --> 00:47:15,108
and you want to find excitementsomeplace else, just say so.

870
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:18,628
- Oh, now, Clara, let's notstart all that over again.

871
00:47:18,732 --> 00:47:20,492
I tell you, I've been working.

872
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:22,529
- There was a lot of
stress in the marriage,

873
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:25,946
and I think my father thoughtit might be wise to spend

874
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,121
a little time with the wife.

875
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:30,640
She was doing 22
weeks of summer stock

876
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:33,229
in this play called
"Dream Girl."

877
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:37,302
And so dad started to make plansfor this romantic rendezvous.

878
00:47:37,406 --> 00:47:40,409
- And she was in
Detroit, and Desi

879
00:47:40,512 --> 00:47:44,344
decided that he wanted tofly to Detroit to see her

880
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:48,555
and that we would send a bandin the bus we had chartered

881
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:51,351
to our next opening.

882
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:52,593
So I chartered a plane.

883
00:47:52,697 --> 00:47:55,942
And we go to the airport,driving thunderstorm.

884
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:57,322
We get in this little plane.

885
00:47:57,426 --> 00:48:00,567
We finally do get to Detroit.

886
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:06,780
But the bus takes off with theseguys and rear ends a truck.

887
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,851
And one of the guys
lost an eye, and they

888
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:10,818
had broke legs and arms.

889
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:14,512
And the seat that's sittingup front next to the driver,

890
00:48:14,615 --> 00:48:18,205
where Desi and I
used to sit, always,

891
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:21,829
and those are the onesthat really got clobbered.

892
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:27,249
So either Desi or me
or both barely missed.

893
00:48:27,352 --> 00:48:29,078
- This crash was
like a wake-up call,

894
00:48:29,182 --> 00:48:31,563
and I think they both knew thatthey had to try a whole lot

895
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:34,083
harder if they were goingto make this marriage work.

896
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:35,533
And for starters,
my mother wanted

897
00:48:35,636 --> 00:48:37,776
to find a way to get
my father to stay home.

898
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,538
- Lucy called me up, and we justlost Stan Kenton and the band.

899
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:42,781
You know, they went somewhere.And we had an opening.

900
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:44,542
So Lucy called me and
said, "Put Desi on."

901
00:48:44,645 --> 00:48:46,164
I said, "All right."Put Desi and his band on.

902
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:47,303
You were on for two
years, weren't you?

903
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:48,408
- Yeah.

904
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:50,651
- And the writers
would give Desi a line,

905
00:48:50,755 --> 00:48:53,620
and he'd walk up to
the thing and spit

906
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:59,833
all over the microphone andthe guacamole would fall out.

907
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,041
- He wasn't kidding.

908
00:49:01,145 --> 00:49:03,250
I didn't even-- not onlycouldn't I say them well,

909
00:49:03,354 --> 00:49:05,908
I didn't understand the jokes.

910
00:49:06,012 --> 00:49:08,566
- Desi stayed in Hollywoodand didn't go on the road,

911
00:49:08,669 --> 00:49:10,913
to be with Lucy.

912
00:49:11,017 --> 00:49:13,157
- My parents were actuallymarried to each other twice.

913
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,607
The second time was
in the Catholic church

914
00:49:15,711 --> 00:49:17,333
because they were
trying to have children,

915
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:19,646
and I think my father's
mother convinced them

916
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:21,751
that the reason they didn'twas because they weren't

917
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:23,822
married in the eyes of God.

it would be better.

- The children would notarrive for another two years.

She lost the first baby andit really broke her heart.

945
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:50,348
- Lucille had a number
of miscarriages.

946
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:52,902
And when I had a
miscarriage once--

947

Lucille, who'd had enoughof her own to feel for me,

came to the hospital.

She didn't knock on the door.

00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,605
She opened the door.

952
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,848
She didn't say hello.

She never said goodbye.

00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:19,274
And I will tell you, I
laughed the first time

She was so wonderful.

- Being pregnant was the mostimportant thing in her life.

959
00:52:28,973 --> 00:52:30,561

of a fantasy thing aboutfamilies and grandmothers

The dream.

963
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:38,603
- Lucy and Desi were
married, and two mothers

964
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:39,604
were always with them.

00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:41,917

very much the lady.

Very, very standoffish.

972
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:13,466
- This was such a
lonely, solitary soul.

973
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:16,434
She was indifferent to
the world around her.

974
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:19,161
Her world was her
bed and her bathroom.

975

Desi, who loved his
mother very much,

976
00:53:21,646 --> 00:53:24,339
often went weeks
without even seeing her.

977

She wasn't much fun to visit.

- DeDe was the commander.

979
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,588
Everything revolved around DeDe.

980
00:53:32,692 --> 00:53:35,695
She was the driving force.

981
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:39,319
And Lucy assumed-- Lucy
took on that trait.

982
00:53:39,423 --> 00:53:41,839
- DeDe wasn't afraid
of anybody or anything.

983
00:53:41,942 --> 00:53:43,461
She was a character.

984
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:46,775
Right up until a few
months before she died,

985
00:53:46,878 --> 00:53:48,604
she wore hot pants.

986
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:51,158
She was honest, she
was straightforward,

987
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:57,095
and she never hesitated
to call it like it was.

988
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,754
- Desi was never close to DeDe.

989

In our moments of
quiet together,

990
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:07,174
DeDe would say to me,
"Oh, that damn spic."

991
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:09,004
He was good to her.

992
00:54:09,107 --> 00:54:12,076
He supported her in style.

993
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,491
But she never liked him.

994
00:54:13,595 --> 00:54:15,838
She tolerated him.

995
00:54:15,942 --> 00:54:18,565
- Did Desi ever talk about hisrelationship with his father?

996
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:22,880
- There was a certain
egotism in Dr. Arnaz.

997
00:54:22,983 --> 00:54:25,779
He wouldn't let Desi
have the last word.

998
00:54:25,883 --> 00:54:27,850
And I think Desi felt for him.

And there are no perfect

There aren't.

She was usually playing thegirl who didn't get the guy,

lots of attention.

- "Love."

1019
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,012
I imagine that was very
difficult for a man who

1020
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:28,773
had been up to bat
and succeeded before,

1021

1024
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:38,196
I would have stopped
trying a long time ago

1025
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,442
because I was always
the guy that didn't fit.

1026
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:43,995
- I always had
claimed that "I Love

1027
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:49,138
Lucy" was born in my den in myhouse, though not literally.

1028
00:55:49,242 --> 00:55:51,762

00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,297
You cannot have
them by telephone.

1036
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:11,782
- Is that right?
- That's right.

1037
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:13,508
- Yes, it's the new
gay family series

1038
00:56:13,611 --> 00:56:16,131
starring Lucille Ball withRichard Denning as Liz

1039
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:17,546
and George Cooper.

1040
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,791
- She was doing a radio showcalled, "My Favorite Husband."

1041
00:56:20,894 --> 00:56:22,413
- If I were you, I'd divorce me.

1042
00:56:22,517 --> 00:56:24,208
- Well, not until we
get a television set.

1043
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:26,866
I want custody of it.

1044
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:29,731
- And CBS wanted to
adapt it to television.

1045
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:32,803
- And when I was asked
to do television,

1046
00:56:32,906 --> 00:56:35,875
it was news to everyone, thenetworks and people in general.

1047
00:56:35,978 --> 00:56:37,428
And the studios frowned upon it.

1048
00:56:37,532 --> 00:56:39,085
- Some stars
basically have always

1049
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:41,328
tried to stay away
from television.

1050
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:44,884
Lucy, certainly-- no agentwould let her go into television

1051
00:56:44,987 --> 00:56:46,679
if she were a star that time.

1052
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:48,405
Things had faded and faded.

1053
00:56:48,508 --> 00:56:50,614
- And she says, "I'd do itif Desi plays the husband."

1054
00:56:50,717 --> 00:56:54,859
- No one wanted him to play myhusband because he was Cuban,

1055
00:56:54,963 --> 00:56:57,137
and they wanted a
real American couple.

1056
00:56:57,241 --> 00:57:01,038
- So I says, look, they don'tthink we should work together.

1057
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:03,005
- So we went out by
ourselves in vaudeville

1058
00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:05,905
to prove that the
audiences would buy it.

1059
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:07,596
- I said, "Let's try it.

1060
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,012
The next time I go with theband on tour, you come with me,

1061
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:11,842
and we'll do a couple
of numbers together."

1062
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:15,259
And I had a very dear friend ofmine, Pepito the Spanish clown,

1063
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:17,537
he gave her a couple
of clown bits.

1064
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:18,573
She did the clown bits.

1065
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:20,126
She did Cuban Pete
with me in which

1066
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:21,955
she sang, "They
call me Sally Sweet,

1067
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:24,233
I'm the queen of DelancyStreet," and boom, boom, boom,

1068
00:57:24,337 --> 00:57:26,028
and knocked my hat
off of my head.

1069
00:57:26,132 --> 00:57:29,031
And the audience,
throughout the country,

1070
00:57:29,135 --> 00:57:30,895
they love us being together.

1071
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:32,379
So I said, "Well,
now, I don't care

1072
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:34,347
what the networks, the
agency, or anybody says.

1073
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,833
If those folks there
likes us, that's it."

1074
00:57:37,937 --> 00:57:39,490
So then we started
working on the pilot.

1075
00:57:39,594 --> 00:57:43,356
And the pilot was 80% ofwhat we'd done on the stage.

1076
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,531
- And their next
production was 100%

1077
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:47,636
of what they were
doing off the stage.

1078
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,019
- I was in my dressing
room at the Roxy,

1079
00:57:51,122 --> 00:57:54,091
and he was in his dressingroom taking a nap.

1080
00:57:54,194 --> 00:57:57,197
And I had had the so-calledrabbit test, or whatever

1081
00:57:57,301 --> 00:57:59,027
they call it, on Friday.

1082
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,063
And we had our radios on.

1083
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:05,067
And in those days, everybodylistened to Winchell.

1084
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:09,347
And Winchell came on
and said I was pregnant.

1085
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:10,797
And he had heard
it on his radio.

1086
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:12,074
We met in the hall.

1087
00:58:12,178 --> 00:58:15,664
And just said, "If he saysit, it's got to be true!"

1088
00:58:15,768 --> 00:58:18,149
[baby cooing]

1089
00:58:18,253 --> 00:58:19,875
- I'm pretty good with babies.

1090
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:21,670
How would you like to
have me for a mother?

1091
00:58:21,774 --> 00:58:22,671
Huh?

1092
00:58:22,775 --> 00:58:25,916
[baby cooing] Blech.

1093
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:30,955
- We did the "I Love Lucy"pilot during the last season

1094
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:34,856
on the radio and she was sixmonths pregnant at the time.

1095
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:38,100
And we had to rush
to get it done.

1096
00:58:38,204 --> 00:58:39,516
[music playing]

1097
00:58:45,832 --> 00:58:48,732
- We just had our little homein the San Fernando Valley,

1098
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:50,596
and we had no intention
of going to New York.

1099
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:52,390
She said, "Who's
going to New York?"

1100
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:55,428
So the sponsor said, "Well,you can't do it in California

1101
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,258
because all we got
here is the kinescope."

1102
00:58:58,362 --> 00:59:01,089
I said, "Well, why
don't we do it on film?

1103
00:59:01,192 --> 00:59:03,678
And then everybody will
get the same quality."

1104
00:59:03,781 --> 00:59:05,334
- Then we find out
you couldn't use film

1105
00:59:05,438 --> 00:59:07,785
unless you shot in a studio.

1106
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:12,203
- But then CBS came in, andsaid, "Well, Lucy works better

1107
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:13,584
in front of an audience."

1108
00:59:13,688 --> 00:59:15,310
And they would right,
she does work better

1109
00:59:15,413 --> 00:59:17,036
in front of an audience.

1110
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:19,556
- Now, that was impossiblebecause you cannot,

1111
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,903
you could not bring an
audience into a studio.

1112
00:59:22,006 --> 00:59:25,389
- So, you know me,
out of left field,

1113
00:59:25,492 --> 00:59:29,013
ignorance is a blessing
at times, I said, "Well,

1114
00:59:29,117 --> 00:59:32,638
why don't we do it on filmin front of an audience?"

1115
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:33,846
And they said, "What is that?"

1116
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,301
Well, I said it so I
figured I better say

1117
00:59:41,405 --> 00:59:43,200
it like if I knew what I said.

1118
00:59:43,303 --> 00:59:45,029
I said, "Film in
front of an audience."

1119
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:46,721
"Do you know how to do that?"

1120
00:59:46,824 --> 00:59:47,998
I said, "Sure!"

1121
00:59:48,101 --> 00:59:50,690
I didn't have the slightestidea what I was doing.

1122
00:59:50,794 --> 00:59:51,691
- He just did it all.

1123
00:59:51,795 --> 00:59:55,626
He built the whole
thing, and saw

1124
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:59,906
that everything that we wantedin the innovative department

1125
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,287
got done.

1126
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,841
- You can imagine a guy inthe early days of television,

1127
01:00:03,945 --> 01:00:10,710
when everything was kinescope,he insisted on having film.

1128
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:15,370
And he had probably the best,one of the best cameramen

1129
01:00:15,473 --> 01:00:17,614
the history of
movies, Karl Freund.

1130
01:00:17,717 --> 01:00:20,720
- I did figure that, you know,you do it with three cameras,

1131
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:22,653
like you're doing now--
they're electronic--

1132
01:00:22,757 --> 01:00:25,035
why couldn't you put threemotion picture cameras,

1133
01:00:25,138 --> 01:00:26,174
and do it?

1134
01:00:26,277 --> 01:00:29,108
And that's how it began,
out of an accident.

1135
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:32,836
- And it became great,because of the preservation

1136
01:00:32,939 --> 01:00:35,390
that was able, with the film,instead of the kinescope.

1137
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:36,874
Kinescope doesn't last.

1138
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:38,911
You couldn't have had reruns.

1139
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:41,154
You could have had nothingpreserved if everything

1140
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:42,880
had gone on being on kinescope.

1141
01:00:42,984 --> 01:00:45,365
- That's why it's still
being shown today.

1142
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:49,128
And Desi Arnaz was
just a naturally

1143
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:52,683
astute and far-sighted
business man.

1144
01:00:52,787 --> 01:00:55,790
- And in those days, I believeroughly each episode with film

1145
01:00:55,893 --> 01:00:58,171
cost about $5,000 or
$6,000 an episode,

1146
01:00:58,275 --> 01:01:00,622
more over and above the other.

1147
01:01:00,726 --> 01:01:02,555
So Phillip Morris
said, "Well, who's

1148
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,591
going to pay that extra $5,000?

1149
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:05,592
We're not."

1150
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:08,009
And CBS says, "Well, we're not."

1151
01:01:08,112 --> 01:01:12,013
And the story goes, Desisays, "Tell you what, amigos.

1152
01:01:12,116 --> 01:01:15,085
Lucy and I will put up the$5,000, but on one condition."

1153
01:01:15,188 --> 01:01:16,120
"What?"

1154
01:01:16,224 --> 01:01:18,088
"We own the films."

1155
01:01:18,191 --> 01:01:20,504
"Good, you got them," CBS said.

1156
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:23,058
- Desi obviously
had the foresight

1157
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:25,129
to see what this
would mean, and when

1158
01:01:25,233 --> 01:01:28,374
he was given the opportunityof owning the films,

1159
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:31,135
he said, "Yes, I definitelywant to own the films."

1160
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:33,897
And he wanted to set uphis own production company.

1161
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,209
And that was really a first.

1162
01:01:36,313 --> 01:01:38,280
And it led to all
kinds of things

1163
01:01:38,384 --> 01:01:40,317
because we created
a separate company,

1164
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:46,288
a separate corporate entitycalled Desilu Productions.

1165
01:01:46,392 --> 01:01:49,326
- "It's Desi Arnaz with
your tropical trip."

1166
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:50,983
- You know, ladies
and gentlemen,

1167
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:55,712
I've always had a great ambitionto sing a song on the radio

1168
01:01:55,815 --> 01:01:57,127
to my daughter.

1169
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:59,854
And we're going to make a recordof it, and when she grows up,

1170
01:01:59,957 --> 01:02:01,131
I'll play it for her.

1171
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:03,547
And that way, she'll
have definite proof

1172
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:09,484
that her old man sang and thatthere was a thing called radio.

1173
01:02:09,587 --> 01:02:13,626
So here it is, especiallywritten for Lucy Desiree Arnaz,

1174
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,870
by her father and Eddie Maxwell.

1175
01:02:15,973 --> 01:02:17,216
I hope you're listening to this.

1176
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:19,632
[MUSIC PLAYING - DESI ARNAZ,"THERE'S A BRAND NEW BABY AT

1177
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,808
OUR HOUSE"] [SINGING] There'sa brand new baby at our house,

1178
01:02:22,911 --> 01:02:26,743
the nicest little
gift we've ever had.

1179
01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:30,436
She's a precious sugar
plum and a blessing

1180
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:33,059
to her mommy and dad.

1181
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:37,788
There's a brand new
baby at our house,

1182
01:02:37,892 --> 01:02:44,070
and though she's been there justa little while, in the parlor,

1183
01:02:44,174 --> 01:02:49,696
in the hall, every pictureon the wall wears a smile.

1184
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,216
- She deeply, deeply
loved her children

1185
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,012
and wanted them desperately.

1186
01:02:55,116 --> 01:02:58,257
And your arrival was one ofthe-- probably the highlight

1187
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,190
in her life.
- I had them very late.

1188
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:02,606
My first child
was when I was 39.

1189
01:03:02,709 --> 01:03:07,473
And I was so happy to have themthat I was afraid that I would

1190
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:08,854
spoil the hell out of them.

1191
01:03:08,957 --> 01:03:10,994
- She tells me she waited10 years to have a child.

1192
01:03:11,097 --> 01:03:14,549
She wanted to have
a baby so much.

1193
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:18,760
I was born in 1951,
and a month later they

1194
01:03:18,864 --> 01:03:20,969
started the "I Love Lucy" show.

1195
01:03:21,073 --> 01:03:22,557
- We had more fun
on the set than we

1196
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,077
can look forward to at anyparty in the evening, you know?

1197
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,423
Yeah.
It look liked it.

1198
01:03:26,526 --> 01:03:27,838
- Sometimes we'd say, "We'vehad so much fun today,

1199
01:03:27,942 --> 01:03:29,115
we don't want to
go out tonight."

1200
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:31,255
- And then the people thatworked with us, you know,

1201
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,568
Fred and Ethel, they
were just sensational.

1202
01:03:33,671 --> 01:03:35,397
- I think Lucy andVivian were like sisters.

1203
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:37,952
They got on each other's nervesand they adored each other.

1204
01:03:38,055 --> 01:03:39,988
- Someone heard
about a young lady

1205
01:03:40,092 --> 01:03:42,784
who was going to be in
La Hoya doing a play.

1206
01:03:42,888 --> 01:03:45,580
So they called me back afterthe first act of "Voice

1207
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:48,548
of the Turtle" and said,
"Lucy, sight unseen,

1208
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:51,966
take our word for it,
this girl is wonderful."

1209
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:53,553
I said, "That's all
I want to hear."

1210
01:03:53,657 --> 01:03:55,832
We fell in love with
the first rehearsal.

1211
01:03:55,935 --> 01:03:58,213
She was something.

1212
01:03:58,317 --> 01:04:00,457
- No one wanted Bill
Frawley to play Fred.

1213
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,873
The networks didn't want him,the agencies didn't want him.

1214
01:04:02,977 --> 01:04:05,842
They said he hadn't done
anything in a long time.

1215
01:04:05,945 --> 01:04:08,292
He had a drinking problem.

1216
01:04:08,396 --> 01:04:11,571
And the more they kept
knocking him down,

1217
01:04:11,675 --> 01:04:14,160
the more I thought he
was right for the part.

1218
01:04:14,264 --> 01:04:16,507
- He was exactly the
way he was written.

1219
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:19,096
He cared more about
baseball and the fights

1220
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,201
than he did about anything.

1221
01:04:20,304 --> 01:04:22,237
If this work interfered,
the hell with the work,

1222
01:04:22,341 --> 01:04:23,652
he wasn't there.

1223
01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:27,001
- And he was one of the mostloved characters in the series,

1224
01:04:27,104 --> 01:04:28,416
really.

1225
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:32,351
No place we went in the country,everybody said, where's Fred?

1226
01:04:32,454 --> 01:04:33,386
How's Fred?

1227
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:34,767
- Everybody was enthusiastic.

1228
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,113
Everybody was working together.

1229
01:04:36,217 --> 01:04:37,597
And it was fun.

1230
01:04:37,701 --> 01:04:40,704

When she gets pregnant, brother,there's no question about it.

You couldn't even say theword "pregnant" in those days.

him to be guilty of.

1370
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:22,381
And so he was blacklisted,absolutely blacklisted.

1371
01:11:22,485 --> 01:11:28,629
And when this thing hit, wewere all out at the ranch.

1372
01:11:28,732 --> 01:11:31,494
And phones were ringing.

1373
01:11:31,597 --> 01:11:34,151
And there's a knock
on the door, and she

1374
01:11:34,255 --> 01:11:38,155
goes to open the frontdoor, and it's Larry Parks.

1375
01:11:38,259 --> 01:11:43,091
And if there was anyone shedidn't need at that moment

1376
01:11:43,195 --> 01:11:47,682
to come into her life andconsole her, it was Larry.

1377
01:11:47,786 --> 01:11:51,548
She said, "Oh, God, Larry,I love you, but go away."

1378
01:11:51,652 --> 01:11:54,586
- They had this famous pressconference before the show

1379
01:11:54,689 --> 01:11:56,001
one night.

1380
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:58,624
And Desi told the story aboutthe grandfather and everything

1381
01:11:58,728 --> 01:12:00,005
else.

1382
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:02,041
- She didn't even know whothe mayor of Los Angeles was.

1383
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:07,323
- How did you get the--

1384
01:12:07,426 --> 01:12:10,533
- The only thing red
about her was her hair.

1385
01:12:10,636 --> 01:12:13,294
And even that was
not legitimate.

1386
01:12:13,398 --> 01:12:16,124
- The whole thing blew
over just like that.

1387
01:12:16,228 --> 01:12:20,163
If the House Un-AmericanActivities Committee really

1388
01:12:20,266 --> 01:12:25,444
clamped down on Lucy, she'dbeen out of the business really.

1389
01:12:25,548 --> 01:12:28,447
She'd been out of the business.

1390
01:12:28,551 --> 01:12:30,932
[MUSIC PLAYING - LUCY AND DESI, "BREEZIN' ALONG"] [SINGING]

1391
01:12:31,036 --> 01:12:35,178
We're just going
along as we please.

1392
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:37,145
Breezing along--

1393
01:12:37,249 --> 01:12:39,769
- So they breezed right alongthrough television, straight

1394
01:12:39,872 --> 01:12:40,977
into the movies.

1395
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,944
And they had another
big hit, that's

1396
01:12:43,048 --> 01:12:44,463
the "Long, Long Trailer."

1397
01:12:44,567 --> 01:12:45,533
- Ricky!

1398
01:12:45,637 --> 01:12:47,673
- [SINGING] First
you dice the carrots,

1399
01:12:47,777 --> 01:12:49,641
slice the onions,
chop the peppers fine.

1400
01:12:49,744 --> 01:12:52,402
Then you sift the flour, grindthe meat, and salt and pepper

1401
01:12:52,506 --> 01:12:54,128
freely.Then you add some garlic.

1402
01:12:54,231 --> 01:12:55,129
Oh, not too much now.

1403
01:12:55,232 --> 01:12:56,510
Yes, the soup's on.

1404
01:12:56,613 --> 01:12:58,512
- Occasionally, she would havethoughts about the script,

1405
01:12:58,615 --> 01:12:59,582
some doubts.

1406
01:12:59,685 --> 01:13:02,481
- And she would say,
"This doesn't work."

1407
01:13:02,585 --> 01:13:04,449
- And Desi would say,"Now, honey, everything's

1408
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:05,588
going to be fine."

1409
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:07,521
And he said that, that
was good enough for her.

1410
01:13:10,558 --> 01:13:13,285
- Lucy had told me
many, many times

1411
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:19,291
what a genius Desi was whenit came to the use of props.

1412
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,775
It's a rare talent.

1413
01:13:20,879 --> 01:13:23,260
- Because he had a
great sense of comedy,

1414
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:26,954
his wife did not have.

1415
01:13:27,057 --> 01:13:31,234
Lucy didn't know what wasfunny and thought that.

1416
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:34,444
When she did, it was the
greatest in the world.

1417
01:13:37,309 --> 01:13:39,069
- What's the matter,
honey, can't you sleep.

1418
01:13:39,173 --> 01:13:41,382
- We've been crying
his name for years,

1419
01:13:41,486 --> 01:13:44,420
give him credit for comedy,and the organization,

1420
01:13:44,523 --> 01:13:45,455
for everything.

1421
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:49,217
- But he never lost
sight of the fact

1422
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:51,219
that Lucy was the
big, big talent.

1423
01:13:51,323 --> 01:13:52,980
His wife.

1424
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:56,190
And once, we were backstagetalking, and Lucy was nearby,

1425
01:13:56,293 --> 01:13:57,571
and the cables were out there.

1426
01:13:57,674 --> 01:14:01,264
And Lucy started to walk
and tripped on a cable.

1427
01:14:01,367 --> 01:14:04,232
And when Desi saw her, he quickgrabbed us by the shoulders,

1428
01:14:04,336 --> 01:14:07,166
and said, "Amigos,
anything happens to her,

1429
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:08,685
we're all in the
shrimp business."

1430
01:14:08,789 --> 01:14:12,275
- Desi already was a star ineverybody else's mind except

1431
01:14:12,378 --> 01:14:13,276
Desi Arnaz's.

1432
01:14:13,379 --> 01:14:15,589
- "Time Magazine"
asked me one time,

1433
01:14:15,692 --> 01:14:20,456
if you had to split thepercentage of the success of "I

1434
01:14:20,559 --> 01:14:24,218
Love Lucy" between yourself, andthe actors, and the actresses,

1435
01:14:24,321 --> 01:14:27,152
and the writers,
how would you do it?

1436
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:28,567
Who would you give the credit?

1437
01:14:28,671 --> 01:14:31,743
I said, well, give Lucy 90%and split the rest between us.

1438
01:14:31,846 --> 01:14:37,162
- Lucy and Desi were the twofunniest most wonderful people

1439
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:39,475
when they were playing theRicardo's And they still

1440
01:14:39,578 --> 01:14:43,375
have the world's most
loved television show.

1441
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,446
Probably never go off the air.

1442
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:48,104
And yet, it wasn't all there is.

1443
01:14:48,207 --> 01:14:50,071
[music playing]

1444
01:14:58,183 --> 01:15:02,049
- They always went to Del Marevery summer and Desi loved it.

1445
01:15:07,364 --> 01:15:10,575
- They rented a house
up the beach from us.

1446
01:15:10,678 --> 01:15:12,404
- You could go out and
swim in the morning

1447
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,131
and get dressed for
the races by 2 o'clock.

1448
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:23,242
- He would bet very heavily,always at the big $100 windows.

1449
01:15:23,346 --> 01:15:26,142
And she would have bet onevery horse in the race.

1450
01:15:26,245 --> 01:15:29,283
- And I remember, we usedto sit with Jimmy Durante.

1451
01:15:29,386 --> 01:15:30,974
And one of the
things I can remember

1452
01:15:31,078 --> 01:15:32,355
is how big his nose was.

1453
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:37,084
- And I would always
go down to the beach

1454
01:15:37,187 --> 01:15:41,053
where Desi and
Jimmy were fishing.

1455
01:15:41,157 --> 01:15:43,400
- They were very,
very good friends.

1456
01:15:47,266 --> 01:15:48,440
- You remember the one day?

1457
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,891
We were playing on the beachin Del Mar, and mother--

1458
01:15:50,994 --> 01:15:52,340
- Our mom.

1459
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:55,136
- She said-- she said, you know,something about get those kids.

1460
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,621
And they were arguing
about the fact

1461
01:15:56,724 --> 01:15:58,105
that he's not speaking
Spanish to us.

1462
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:00,072
That's all we knew, was
that we were dragged off

1463
01:16:00,176 --> 01:16:01,971
of the beach in themiddle of a beautiful day

1464
01:16:02,074 --> 01:16:03,420
and shoved into the shade.

1465
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:05,008
And dad went into the kitchen,

1466
01:16:05,112 --> 01:16:06,734
and came back out
with butter and bread,

1467
01:16:06,838 --> 01:16:08,287
and he sat down at
this little table.

1468
01:16:08,391 --> 01:16:09,495
And we're sitting therelike, at this little table.

1469
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,118
We were like four and five.

1470
01:16:11,221 --> 01:16:16,054
And he took off his shoe andhe said, [speaking spanish],,

1471
01:16:16,157 --> 01:16:17,193
Say it, [speaking spanish].

1472
01:16:17,296 --> 01:16:18,919
- Do I have to really
say it right now"

1473
01:16:19,022 --> 01:16:19,920
- Yes.

1474
01:16:20,023 --> 01:16:20,921
- God, "shoe."

1475
01:16:23,544 --> 01:16:25,408
- And then he picked up
the butter, and he said,

1476
01:16:25,511 --> 01:16:27,306
[speaking spanish].

1477
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:29,274
Say it, [speaking spanish].

1478
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:32,001
And then he picked up the breadand went [speaking spanish],,

1479
01:16:32,104 --> 01:16:33,450
say it.
- [speaking spanish]

1480
01:16:33,554 --> 01:16:36,626
- [speaking spanish]
[speaking spanish]

1481
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:38,317
[speaking spanish]
[speaking spanish]

1482
01:16:38,421 --> 01:16:39,974
- [speaking spanish]
- Now go play.

1483
01:16:40,078 --> 01:16:41,631
- Go play.
- And that was it.

1484
01:16:41,735 --> 01:16:42,943
And we never had another lesson.

1485
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:53,298
- Palm Springs was a
very valuable getaway

1486
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:55,921
for both Lucy and Desi.

1487
01:16:56,025 --> 01:17:02,169
For Desi, particularly,because of the club and golf.

1488
01:17:02,272 --> 01:17:04,585
- We had three beautiful homes.

1489
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:06,829
We had expensive vacations.

1490
01:17:06,932 --> 01:17:09,314
My parents' success
brought us a lifestyle

1491
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:10,798
that most people
can only dream of.

1492
01:17:14,526 --> 01:17:18,875
- When Desi was around,there was a lot more money,

1493
01:17:18,979 --> 01:17:19,980
it seemed like.

1494
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:21,498
There were big parties.

1495
01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:23,604
- At all of our parties,there were costume parties.

1496
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:25,502
We were doctors, Indians--

1497
01:17:25,606 --> 01:17:26,780
- Cowboys.

1498
01:17:26,883 --> 01:17:28,505
- Cowboys, nurses.

1499
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:29,506
- Right.

1500
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:31,439
- I was a King a
lot of the time.

1501
01:17:31,543 --> 01:17:33,890
- They'd get props andset pieces from the studio

1502
01:17:33,994 --> 01:17:36,168
so it would really look likea town in the background.

1503
01:17:36,272 --> 01:17:38,515
- Like streets, or
like it was a carnival.

1504
01:17:38,619 --> 01:17:40,586
And we were, we could beclowns or stuff like that.

1505
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:41,933
- A real little
Ferris wheel they had.

1506
01:17:42,036 --> 01:17:42,899
- Oh, yeah.

1507
01:17:47,559 --> 01:17:52,909
- I never got the sense thatthis was a normal household.

1508
01:17:53,013 --> 01:17:57,465
- I will never forget driving infront of your house on Roxbury.

1509
01:17:57,569 --> 01:18:00,883
Your mother was
standing in the doorway.

1510
01:18:00,986 --> 01:18:02,574
She had on slacks.

1511
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:05,508
It was sort of the
"King and I" blue color,

1512
01:18:05,611 --> 01:18:08,891
a pink fuzzy sweater on,
with the orange hair.

1513
01:18:08,994 --> 01:18:10,444
And it was exactly
like when I was

1514
01:18:10,547 --> 01:18:13,343
a kid, when I'd see
movie magazines, when

1515
01:18:13,447 --> 01:18:17,796
it would say, "A visit
with Lucille Ball,"

1516
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,798
standing at the door.

1517
01:18:19,902 --> 01:18:22,767
My dear, I thought I'd
died and gone to heaven.

1518
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:26,218
- Lucy, in my childhood, wasvery, very, in that respect,

1519
01:18:26,322 --> 01:18:28,048
growing up in that
home, very public.

1520
01:18:28,151 --> 01:18:29,566
- It's like when
you grow up and you

1521
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:32,915
have people rapping onyour door 27 times a day,

1522
01:18:33,018 --> 01:18:34,192
is that a fair number?

1523
01:18:34,295 --> 01:18:36,090
You know, saying, is
she home, are they home,

1524
01:18:36,194 --> 01:18:38,714
pulling the grass
out of your lawn.

1525
01:18:38,817 --> 01:18:40,716
- But the interestingthing was that mom and dad

1526
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:42,683
could have lived in other
areas in Beverly Hills

1527
01:18:42,787 --> 01:18:43,788
where it was secluded.

1528
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:47,377
- When I first
came to California,

1529
01:18:47,481 --> 01:18:49,138
your mother wanted
me to live there

1530
01:18:49,241 --> 01:18:51,485
at the house, which I wascertainly thrilled to do.

1531
01:18:51,588 --> 01:18:53,970
I mean, the next door
neighbor is Jack Benny.

1532
01:18:54,074 --> 01:18:56,524
- Oh, I got to tell
you about Jack Benny.

1533
01:18:56,628 --> 01:18:58,664
He came over one
night at dinner time--

1534
01:18:58,768 --> 01:19:01,944
- I swear to you, we're
sitting there eating.

1535
01:19:02,047 --> 01:19:04,360
Jack Benny comes in,
playing the violin.

1536
01:19:04,463 --> 01:19:08,191
- Just walked around the tablethree times, never said a word.

1537
01:19:08,295 --> 01:19:11,643
- He didn't say, Is
this funny, forget it?"

1538
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:12,955
Nothing.

1539
01:19:13,058 --> 01:19:16,406
We heard him go all the wayhome, da, da, da, da, da.

1540
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:20,894
I thought, "This is reallya miracle here I'm living."

1541
01:19:20,997 --> 01:19:23,413
- Another thing that
my Aunt Lucy did was,

1542
01:19:23,517 --> 01:19:29,695
much to my mother's horror, shetook me into her own at-home

1543
01:19:29,799 --> 01:19:35,253
beauty salon and proceededto give me a permanent.

1544
01:19:35,356 --> 01:19:37,634
I think at that time
I was about three.

1545
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:42,674
I remember sitting in that tallchair with the drape around me,

1546
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,159
and my aunt was--
and she took hours.

1547
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:50,475
And she was really into it,just doing me up, and styling it

1548
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:51,925
afterwards.

1549
01:19:52,028 --> 01:19:56,101
- I will always remember shewould always fool with my hair.

1550
01:19:56,205 --> 01:19:58,897
And she said, "You know,if I hadn't been in movies,

1551
01:19:59,001 --> 01:20:00,347
I would've been a beautician."

1552
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:02,694
We'd have to go out
to the back house.

1553
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,834
She had a little
beauty shop set up.

1554
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:07,181
And my dear, she
almost ruined my hair.

1555
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:09,735
She would do permanents when Ishouldn't have had a permanent.

1556
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:11,772
But again, I justcouldn't tell Lucille Ball

1557
01:20:11,876 --> 01:20:13,360
to go get herself a job.

1558
01:20:13,463 --> 01:20:17,088
I just sat there like a dummy,and let her ruin my hair.

1559
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:19,573
- Well, I remember
she would sit me down,

1560
01:20:19,676 --> 01:20:21,299
and she'd be sitting
in a chair like this,

1561
01:20:21,402 --> 01:20:22,990
and the cast would be
sitting around her.

1562
01:20:23,094 --> 01:20:25,786
She'd put me down on the
floor and comb my hair.

1563
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,237
And she would-- just to havesomething to do with her hands

1564
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:29,617
while she was reading.

1565
01:20:29,721 --> 01:20:31,757
And she'd say, If I justhad a shampoo bowl in here,

1566
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:33,173
I'd wash it."

1567
01:20:33,276 --> 01:20:35,900
- I remember playing Monopolywith your mother in the living

1568
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:37,004
room.

1569
01:20:37,108 --> 01:20:39,075
You know that swag lamp,
that ugly swag lamp?

1570
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:42,561
- Which if you get a chanceto go to Universal Studios,

1571
01:20:42,665 --> 01:20:46,117
the lamp is sitting over
her backgammon table.

1572
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,878
And if you notice, there'sa funny little thing

1573
01:20:48,982 --> 01:20:50,328
on the bottom of the lamp.

1574
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:53,434
- I personally am embarrassedby it being there.

1575
01:20:53,538 --> 01:20:58,957
I think, in fact, Ithink at one time, Earl--

1576
01:20:59,061 --> 01:21:01,546
remember Earl the handy man?

1577
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:03,375
- He was a character.

1578
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:06,792
And when she got into
playing backgammon,

1579
01:21:06,896 --> 01:21:09,830
she had him make all
the backgammon tables.

1580
01:21:09,934 --> 01:21:13,075
And then she had a
spotlight up above.

1581
01:21:13,178 --> 01:21:17,286
And her objection
was the spotlight,

1582
01:21:17,389 --> 01:21:19,529
not only was it
shining on the table,

1583
01:21:19,633 --> 01:21:21,600
it was also shining in her eyes.

1584
01:21:21,704 --> 01:21:24,224
And she asked Earl, shesaid, "Earl, come in here,

1585
01:21:24,327 --> 01:21:25,604
I have a problem."

1586
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:28,504
So Earl would go in, and shesays, "Well, this light is also

1587
01:21:28,607 --> 01:21:29,815
shining in my eyes.

1588
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:31,817
Do you think you could
do anything about it?"

1589
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:35,787
So Earl would grunt, and say,"Well, let me think about it."

1590
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,895
And so the next day, he
had it all figured out.

1591
01:21:39,998 --> 01:21:41,275
- You know what he had done?

1592
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:49,697
He'd painted a coffee can goldand put it up in the light.

1593
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:52,355
Didn't bother her at all.

1594
01:21:52,459 --> 01:21:53,736
I don't know if
she ever noticed.

1595
01:21:53,839 --> 01:21:56,049
She just knew the
light was just swell.

1596
01:21:56,152 --> 01:21:59,569
A coffee can in Lucille
Ball's home, my dear.

1597
01:21:59,673 --> 01:22:01,295
She owned the world.

1598
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:02,779
- It served its purpose.

1599
01:22:02,883 --> 01:22:04,609
And she was a very
practical person.

1600
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:12,755
- Desi, isn't this beautiful?

1601
01:22:12,858 --> 01:22:16,586
This is a brand new 1960Westinghouse refrigerator.

1602
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:17,691
- You broke it!

1603
01:22:17,794 --> 01:22:19,037
Refrigerators don't
open in the middle.

1604
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:20,349
Do something!

1605
01:22:20,452 --> 01:22:22,420
- Well, oh, what happened,what happened, what's that?

1606
01:22:22,523 --> 01:22:26,010
- My parents had becomeAmerica's best known and most

1607
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:28,357
admired married couple.

1608
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:31,498
They both worked very hardto promote their image.

1609
01:22:31,601 --> 01:22:33,638
- She worked very hard.

1610
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:36,261
And she was willing to workjust like, going all the time,

1611
01:22:36,365 --> 01:22:39,057
loved rehearsals.

1612
01:22:39,161 --> 01:22:41,611
- If you want something done,ask a busy person to do it,

1613
01:22:41,715 --> 01:22:44,718
because the more you
do, the more you can do.

1614
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:46,168
And don't you forget it!

1615
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:51,656
- Desi just seemed to
run the studio with one

1616
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:54,245
hand and the show with another.

1617
01:22:54,348 --> 01:22:55,971
I don't know how he did it.

1618
01:22:56,074 --> 01:22:58,352
We used to call
him "The Cuban Arm"

1619
01:22:58,456 --> 01:22:59,491
because he could charm you.

1620
01:22:59,595 --> 01:23:01,390
And then he'd come up,
put his arm around you,

1621
01:23:01,493 --> 01:23:02,839
and he'd call you "amigo."

1622
01:23:02,943 --> 01:23:04,048
- They were there very early.

1623
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:06,050
And then of course he wasrunning back and forth

1624
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:09,432
from the set, you know,
juggling the business.

1625
01:23:09,536 --> 01:23:12,159
And the pressure was building.

1626
01:23:12,263 --> 01:23:15,542
- They were never
really as happy

1627
01:23:15,645 --> 01:23:17,785
with any of the rest ofit, any of the trappings,

1628
01:23:17,889 --> 01:23:20,443
and the houses, and
the kids, as they

1629
01:23:20,547 --> 01:23:23,067
were when they were at work.

1630
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:25,517
- And to spend the
time in their careers

1631
01:23:25,621 --> 01:23:29,487
that Lucy and Desi had tospend to do it successfully,

1632
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:32,110
they had to take some
time away from the kids.

1633
01:23:32,214 --> 01:23:34,354
And they were raised
by the servants.

1634
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:36,114
- Willie Mae Barker
was her name.

1635
01:23:36,218 --> 01:23:39,911
And she was another woman inmy life, as well as my mother,

1636
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,568
and my grandmother, DeDe.

1637
01:23:41,671 --> 01:23:44,191
- Well, she had DeDe
to take care of you.

1638
01:23:44,295 --> 01:23:47,781
And that's as good as her,Lucille, taking care of you,

1639
01:23:47,884 --> 01:23:49,334
in her mind.

1640
01:23:49,438 --> 01:23:53,028
And now that may not
be right, but she

1641
01:23:53,131 --> 01:23:54,339
didn't think it was wrong.

1642
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:56,548
She really didn't.

1643
01:23:56,652 --> 01:24:00,035
- I really feel
that Lucille just

1644
01:24:00,138 --> 01:24:05,661
didn't have the tools tolearn to mother or to nurture.

1645
01:24:05,764 --> 01:24:07,352
They just weren't there for her.

1646
01:24:07,456 --> 01:24:10,735
I think Lucille had to
be an adult as a child,

1647
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,047
just had to take over.

1648
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:15,498
Because DeDe was always working.

1649
01:24:15,602 --> 01:24:21,332
- I never learned to havea playful relationship

1650
01:24:21,435 --> 01:24:26,130
with my mother because
we were always too busy.

1651
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:30,444
- In that respect, I neversaw your mother play with you.

1652
01:24:30,548 --> 01:24:32,205
I didn't.

1653
01:24:32,308 --> 01:24:33,861
She would say I
love you and that,

1654
01:24:33,965 --> 01:24:36,933
but I never saw
her play with you.

1655
01:24:37,037 --> 01:24:39,384
- I remember your
mother being very

1656
01:24:39,488 --> 01:24:41,041
"on" when people were around.

1657
01:24:41,145 --> 01:24:43,975
And then when people werenot around, being very "off."

1658
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,323
It was like your mom
had an on/off switch.

1659
01:24:47,427 --> 01:24:49,498
- I like discipline in children.

1660
01:24:49,601 --> 01:24:52,811
I like to be able to havethe children likeable so

1661
01:24:52,915 --> 01:24:54,296
that other people
will like them.

1662
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:55,607
- Yeah.

1663
01:24:55,711 --> 01:24:58,300
- You know, I don't want alittle brat running around.

1664
01:24:58,403 --> 01:25:00,509
It's bad enough what they do.

1665
01:25:00,612 --> 01:25:05,583
- If she wasn't in controlthen she was pretty unhappy.

1666
01:25:05,686 --> 01:25:08,896
- She was always so busy makingsure everything was right.

1667
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,141
But she wanted you all tobe, everything to be perfect.

1668
01:25:12,245 --> 01:25:15,144
I think your daddy alwaysimpressed me as he knew you

1669
01:25:15,248 --> 01:25:16,318
weren't, and he wasn't.

1670
01:25:16,421 --> 01:25:18,596
He was more outwardly
affectionate.

1671
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:20,805
- He was working all the time.

1672
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:24,602
But when he came home, hewould do stuff with us.

1673
01:25:24,705 --> 01:25:28,364
- My father had this
amazing sense of wonder

1674
01:25:28,468 --> 01:25:30,055
at the miracle of nature.

1675
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,782
And he'd just take your hand andwalk you around and say things

1676
01:25:32,886 --> 01:25:34,508
to you about, you
know, isn't that--

1677
01:25:34,612 --> 01:25:35,509
"Look at that sunset.

1678
01:25:35,613 --> 01:25:36,959
God really outdid
himself tonight."

1679
01:25:37,062 --> 01:25:38,236
You know?

1680
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,756
And Lucy and I would sitthere, looking at, like, "wow."

1681
01:25:40,859 --> 01:25:42,447
And he'd instill
in us this sense

1682
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:45,105
that there was something
about this life that

1683
01:25:45,209 --> 01:25:47,245
was worth living.

1684
01:25:47,349 --> 01:25:51,732
- When my mother came home,she would still be working.

1685
01:25:51,836 --> 01:25:52,906
Do you know what I'm saying?

1686
01:25:53,009 --> 01:25:56,772
She would still be working.

1687
01:25:56,875 --> 01:25:59,775
I have to fight every day in mylife not to go home to my kids

1688
01:25:59,878 --> 01:26:02,226
and be there physically
but not be there.

1689
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:03,365
I'm still on the phone.

1690
01:26:03,468 --> 01:26:04,435
I'm still cleaning silver.

1691
01:26:04,538 --> 01:26:05,643
I'm still cleaning a closet.

1692
01:26:05,746 --> 01:26:09,750
I'm not-- "Hello, Mom,you've been gone all day.

1693
01:26:09,854 --> 01:26:12,615
Could we just sit downand color or go outside?"

1694
01:26:15,549 --> 01:26:18,656
It was really hard
for her to be there.

1695
01:26:18,759 --> 01:26:21,106
- In ways, I feel
sort of sorry for her

1696
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:25,835
because I feel that she
never let herself go.

1697
01:26:25,939 --> 01:26:29,563
She never let
herself love you kids

1698
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:33,222
the way she could of, ormaybe even love Desi the way

1699
01:26:33,326 --> 01:26:34,568
she could have.

1700
01:26:34,672 --> 01:26:38,123
- Lucille Ball envisioneda white picket fence.

1701
01:26:38,227 --> 01:26:42,127
And I think indeed believedthat, that fantasy.

1702
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:43,543
She did not live it.

1703
01:26:43,646 --> 01:26:48,272
But in her mind, her interviewswere always about the family,

1704
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:52,379
"my children come first,
work is down the line."

1705
01:26:52,483 --> 01:27:01,561
It is my belief that LucilleBall's first love was her work.

1706
01:27:01,664 --> 01:27:05,427
- The best time is when you'reworking and you're happy.

1707
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:08,084
And we really had a ball.

1708
01:27:08,188 --> 01:27:10,846
- I think there are a lotof parents that can be gone

1709
01:27:10,949 --> 01:27:12,710
and when they come back
they're really there.

1710
01:27:12,813 --> 01:27:14,436
They're really connected
with their kids.

1711
01:27:14,539 --> 01:27:17,680
And I just think
that these two people

1712
01:27:17,784 --> 01:27:22,547
had enough problems of theirown, for various reasons,

1713
01:27:22,651 --> 01:27:27,069
that they needed that work.

1714
01:27:27,172 --> 01:27:29,209
- In our first movie
for MGM, "The Long,

1715
01:27:29,313 --> 01:27:31,901
Long Trailer," we
had a lot of fun.

1716
01:27:32,005 --> 01:27:34,973
But we had even more funmaking "Forever Darling."

1717
01:27:35,077 --> 01:27:38,425
- Movies, television
shows, commercials.

1718
01:27:38,529 --> 01:27:40,772
My dad managed all of
my parents' projects.

1719
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:43,119
And he co-starred every
week in "I Love Lucy."

1720
01:27:43,223 --> 01:27:46,433
And he also ran Desilu
Studios on top of it.

1721
01:27:46,537 --> 01:27:48,401
- He also took enormous risks.

1722
01:27:48,504 --> 01:27:50,886
I mean, when you stop and thinkthat he went and bought RKO

1723
01:27:50,989 --> 01:27:55,442
during a break in the show,that's what we were doing.

1724
01:27:55,546 --> 01:27:57,341
- $6 million cash.

1725
01:27:57,444 --> 01:27:58,652
That was the deal.

1726
01:27:58,756 --> 01:28:05,418
My heavens, after havingstarted at RKO at $75 a week,

1727
01:28:05,521 --> 01:28:07,247
now she owns the studio.

1728
01:28:07,351 --> 01:28:09,732
- As a matter of fact, wedecided to sell "I Love Lucy"

1729
01:28:09,836 --> 01:28:11,389
back shortly before that.

1730
01:28:11,493 --> 01:28:17,222
- We had used that reasoning injustifying the sale of the "I

1731
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:20,364
Love Lucy" shows back to CBS.

1732
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:23,781
We sold all right, title,and interest to them.

1733
01:28:23,884 --> 01:28:26,266
- Why did you do that?

1734
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:29,096
- I told you, right
or wrong, Lucy,

1735
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,133
that was the decision we made.

1736
01:28:31,236 --> 01:28:32,617
- And people have
looked back now

1737
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:36,138
and said, look at all themoney that CBS has made.

1738
01:28:36,241 --> 01:28:39,797
But they forget, I think,or overlook is that--

1739
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:46,838
- We extrapolated out
the number of shows

1740
01:28:46,942 --> 01:28:53,017
that would have to be soldin markets untold to come up

1741
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:58,402
to net the company, and Lucy,and Desi, the amount of money

1742
01:28:58,505 --> 01:29:00,162
that CBS was willing to pay.

1743
01:29:00,265 --> 01:29:01,266
There was no market.

1744
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:04,408
Who ever thought this
would have happened?

1745
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:07,790
- There was really no waythat Lucy and Desi, or Desilu

1746
01:29:07,894 --> 01:29:11,000
Productions, could
have distributed

1747
01:29:11,104 --> 01:29:14,314
those films because thedistribution rights belonged

1748
01:29:14,418 --> 01:29:15,833
to CBS.

1749
01:29:15,936 --> 01:29:17,386
- As it turns out,
it was probably

1750
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:19,768
the worst deal ever made.

1751
01:29:19,871 --> 01:29:24,393
- But it was the proceeds fromthe sale of the "I Love Lucy"

1752
01:29:24,497 --> 01:29:28,155
films that gave Desi
the idea that he

1753
01:29:28,259 --> 01:29:31,538
was interested inacquiring a major studio.

1754
01:29:31,642 --> 01:29:32,781
- And he built a dynasty.

1755
01:29:32,884 --> 01:29:34,679
I mean, just...

1756
01:29:34,783 --> 01:29:37,061
he had 16 shows on the air.

1757
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:40,202
We owned three studios,
and Desi did it all.

1758
01:29:40,305 --> 01:29:42,238
All I did was have
babies and do the show.

1759
01:29:42,342 --> 01:29:44,862
And loved every minute of it!

1760
01:29:44,965 --> 01:29:46,242
- But at one time
or another, you

1761
01:29:46,346 --> 01:29:49,142
had many, many big stars
working for Desilu.

1762
01:29:49,245 --> 01:29:51,524
- Yeah, mainly I had Lucy.

1763
01:29:51,627 --> 01:29:53,871
- Yeah.

1764
01:29:53,974 --> 01:29:55,044
- That was quite a bit of it.

1765
01:29:55,148 --> 01:29:57,771
- Yeah, but off of that--

1766
01:29:57,875 --> 01:30:00,187
- No matter how hard he workedor what a great businessman

1767
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:04,433
he was, she was the one with allthe accolades and the credits.

1768
01:30:04,537 --> 01:30:05,883
And she was the clown.

1769
01:30:05,986 --> 01:30:07,850
The show was built
around her, you know?

1770
01:30:07,954 --> 01:30:11,475
And the back stage
portions that he did

1771
01:30:11,578 --> 01:30:13,200
were not acknowledged
in those days.

1772
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:14,236
The show got on.

1773
01:30:14,339 --> 01:30:15,306
It was good and it worked.

1774
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,687
And they went on from there.

1775
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:18,930
And I think he kept trying todo more, and more, and more,

1776
01:30:19,034 --> 01:30:20,725
and more, and more,
and bigger, and better.

1777
01:30:20,829 --> 01:30:22,382
And you know, "Hello?

1778
01:30:22,486 --> 01:30:24,557
I'm here working, too."

1779
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:29,493
And he never got the
credit 'til he was dead.

1780
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:31,633
- Sometimes he got sick
of all the business

1781
01:30:31,736 --> 01:30:34,014
because he had more
fun performing.

1782
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:35,706
I heard him say that.

1783
01:30:35,809 --> 01:30:37,984
He said sometimes he feltlike selling the whole thing

1784
01:30:38,087 --> 01:30:39,917
to the cemetery next door.

1785
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:43,576
- Desi's desire to be
a man in his own right

1786
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,095
was somewhere along theline taken away from him.

1787
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:51,342
- There was a certain
rivalry in Dr. Arnaz.

1788
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:55,657
He did not want Desi
in his great importance

1789
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,729
to be more important
than he had been.

1790
01:30:58,832 --> 01:31:01,352
- The fact that Lucybecame the star of the show

1791
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:02,940
only increased that.

1792
01:31:03,043 --> 01:31:04,044
It was already there--

1793
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,325
his anger, maybe his mother.

1794
01:31:09,429 --> 01:31:13,709
- Lolita, I thought,
was very domineering.

1795
01:31:13,813 --> 01:31:17,920
And she just demanded thatDesi would take care of her

1796
01:31:18,024 --> 01:31:19,577
and buy her things.

1797
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:23,201
In fact, a car that she
couldn't even drive.

1798
01:31:23,305 --> 01:31:25,928
I think she looked on himmore like the replacement

1799
01:31:26,032 --> 01:31:27,723
of a husband.

1800
01:31:27,827 --> 01:31:29,691
He felt very obligated.

1801
01:31:29,794 --> 01:31:31,486
- I don't think Desi
ever knew how good he

1802
01:31:31,589 --> 01:31:35,248
was in many respects.

1803
01:31:35,351 --> 01:31:39,494
And he took it
out in other ways.

1804
01:31:39,597 --> 01:31:46,397
- It's one thing to be
sort of a philanderer.

1805
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,779
It's another thing to
do it and have it known.

1806
01:31:48,882 --> 01:31:51,333
- Desi once said to us, "Whatthe hell's the matter with her?

1807
01:31:51,436 --> 01:31:53,335
I love her.I don't go out with other women.

1808
01:31:53,438 --> 01:31:54,681
I go out with hookers."

1809
01:31:54,785 --> 01:31:56,062
That's the Latin
culture, you see.

1810
01:31:56,165 --> 01:31:57,235
It's perfectly acceptable.

1811
01:31:57,339 --> 01:31:59,306
But Lucy couldn't accept it.

1812
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:01,516
- A real honest to God Latin.

1813
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:02,793
And he never changed.

1814
01:32:02,896 --> 01:32:04,519
- And he never
considered it disloyal.

1815
01:32:04,622 --> 01:32:06,486
He didn't think it had
anything whatsoever

1816
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:09,765
to do with his
marriage or his wife.

1817
01:32:09,869 --> 01:32:14,321
- It became obvious thatthere were troubles because it

1818
01:32:14,425 --> 01:32:16,185
began to be talked about.

1819
01:32:16,289 --> 01:32:17,704
And then, of course,
Desi's drinking,

1820
01:32:17,808 --> 01:32:22,122
which started about the middleof '55, if memory serves me.

1821
01:32:22,226 --> 01:32:26,817
- I think the pressuresof the studio and stress,

1822
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:32,132
he'd reach for a drink inthe afternoon to relax, or--

1823
01:32:32,236 --> 01:32:33,306
and that's the trap.

1824
01:32:33,409 --> 01:32:37,344
- A lot of what we do
is looking for happiness

1825
01:32:37,448 --> 01:32:38,967
in the wrong places--

1826
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:41,314
money, power.

1827
01:32:41,417 --> 01:32:44,697
And drugs and alcohol are oneof the other things that we

1828
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,216
think will help us feel better.

1829
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:51,876
- His drinking reached a pointwhere he had a wake-up drink,

1830
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:56,329
straightened him out, andhe was drunk at 11:00.

1831
01:32:56,432 --> 01:33:01,023
- He got to the pointwhere he really no longer

1832
01:33:01,127 --> 01:33:04,199
was in control of himself.

1833
01:33:04,302 --> 01:33:09,307
And his opinions were
out of drunkenness,

1834
01:33:09,411 --> 01:33:11,102
you know, out of alcohol.

1835
01:33:11,206 --> 01:33:14,036
- Just like any other family,we had problems in our family.

1836
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:16,383
And so part of the
problem was admitting

1837
01:33:16,487 --> 01:33:17,592
that there was a problem.

1838
01:33:17,695 --> 01:33:20,698
- Well, I'm sick andtired of the whole thing.

1839
01:33:20,802 --> 01:33:23,011
- It seems to me,
you're just sick of me.

1840
01:33:23,114 --> 01:33:26,462
You just don't like ourwhole marriage, Lorenzo Vega.

1841
01:33:26,566 --> 01:33:28,672
- Well, maybe, I
don't, Lucy Vega.

1842
01:33:28,775 --> 01:33:31,467
- I think they would have lovedto have been the Ricardo's.

1843
01:33:31,571 --> 01:33:32,986
But unfortunately,
the Ricardo's had

1844
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:35,989
a way of kissing and making up.

1845
01:33:36,093 --> 01:33:38,371
I think they both found
it extraordinarily hard

1846
01:33:38,474 --> 01:33:39,855
to say I'm sorry.

1847
01:33:39,959 --> 01:33:42,996
- They weren't getting
along and we knew it.

1848
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,998
- What's happened to us, Lucy?

1849
01:33:45,102 --> 01:33:48,484
- It was an era where
people didn't get help.

1850
01:33:48,588 --> 01:33:51,764
So they didn't have anybodyexplaining to them why

1851
01:33:51,867 --> 01:33:53,558
they were the way they were.

1852
01:33:53,662 --> 01:33:56,492
So it was just sort of a
vicious circle, I think.

1853
01:33:56,596 --> 01:34:00,151
- You know, I keepremembering the way it was

1854
01:34:00,255 --> 01:34:02,775
the first year of our marriage.

1855
01:34:02,878 --> 01:34:06,848
We had something then that seemsto have slipped away from us.

1856
01:34:06,951 --> 01:34:09,333
In those days, there wasnobody in the whole world

1857
01:34:09,436 --> 01:34:11,680
but just you and me.

1858
01:34:11,784 --> 01:34:14,131
That's why I want you to
go on this trip with me.

1859
01:34:14,234 --> 01:34:15,684
Because I think it
will gives a chance

1860
01:34:15,788 --> 01:34:17,479
to get to know each other again.

1861
01:34:17,582 --> 01:34:19,446
- They went to
Europe for the reason

1862
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:23,588
that so many people, whentheir marriage is breaking up,

1863
01:34:23,692 --> 01:34:30,250
they decide they're going tosomehow recapture something.

1864
01:34:30,354 --> 01:34:32,908
- Oh, yeah, I remember
all of the trips.

1865
01:34:33,012 --> 01:34:36,291
Because I'll tell you, thosedays were very intense.

1866
01:34:36,394 --> 01:34:38,431
Because that was when theywere really going at it.

1867
01:34:38,534 --> 01:34:40,088
- And I remember
hearing them scream.

1868
01:34:40,191 --> 01:34:41,917
And the two doors were open.

1869
01:34:42,021 --> 01:34:45,265
And my mother was leaning overhim with her long red nails.

1870
01:34:45,369 --> 01:34:48,475
They were poised
at him like that.

1871
01:34:48,579 --> 01:34:52,307
And she said, with
her teeth gritted

1872
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:53,998
in her mouth in a
horrible position,

1873
01:34:54,102 --> 01:34:56,621
"I wish you were dead."

1874
01:34:56,725 --> 01:34:59,314
- Of course, this was
all a disaster trip

1875
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:03,249
because your father's drinkingjust increased enormously.

1876
01:35:03,352 --> 01:35:07,184
And he was drunk a
great deal of this time,

1877
01:35:07,287 --> 01:35:10,118
and fell down on
the cobblestones.

1878
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:13,949
And his face was all, you know,the next morning, his face

1879
01:35:14,053 --> 01:35:15,019
was all purple.

1880
01:35:15,123 --> 01:35:17,056
And he looked like
a pomegranate.

1881
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:18,989
- It scared me to death.

1882
01:35:19,092 --> 01:35:22,199
I think as a kid, all
you're worried about

1883
01:35:22,302 --> 01:35:27,376
is are they going to
go away and leave me.

1884
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:29,724
Maybe I even thought itwas my fault. I don't know.

1885
01:35:29,827 --> 01:35:31,553
It was scary.
- We were very young.

1886
01:35:31,656 --> 01:35:32,830
And we knew what was going on.

1887
01:35:32,934 --> 01:35:36,454
And it was very, very
bad for everyone.

1888
01:35:36,558 --> 01:35:37,835
- She had to leave
him, you know.

1889
01:35:37,939 --> 01:35:39,768
They separated.

1890
01:35:39,872 --> 01:35:41,839
- Every time I hear, "Youbetter sit down, kids,"

1891
01:35:41,943 --> 01:35:43,772
I have a lot of
trouble with that.

1892
01:35:43,876 --> 01:35:46,671
Because that's
exactly what happened.

1893
01:35:46,775 --> 01:35:48,984
- I will always remember whenthey sat us down and said,

1894
01:35:49,088 --> 01:35:51,297
look, you know,
things aren't working.

1895
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,126
I mean, I remember
word for word.

1896
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:54,818
I was six years old.

1897
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:58,753
I remember word for
word what they said.

1898
01:35:58,856 --> 01:36:01,134
[music playing]

1899
01:36:09,522 --> 01:36:11,835
- Even though they tried
to maintain a working

1900
01:36:11,938 --> 01:36:15,217
relationship, after
the divorce my parents'

1901
01:36:15,321 --> 01:36:18,324
professional partnership
fell apart, too.

1902
01:36:18,427 --> 01:36:20,015
- Is that the toughest--
- Yes.

1903
01:36:20,119 --> 01:36:22,017
- --period of your life?
- Yes.

1904
01:36:22,121 --> 01:36:26,470
It got tough on the
set, too, at the end.

1905
01:36:26,573 --> 01:36:28,541
At the thought of quitting.

1906
01:36:28,644 --> 01:36:29,645
- I knew it was the end.

1907
01:36:29,749 --> 01:36:31,475
It was the end of
something very special.

1908
01:36:31,578 --> 01:36:33,753
And I remember being very upset.

1909
01:36:33,857 --> 01:36:36,652
- I will never forget theday they were doing the last

1910
01:36:36,756 --> 01:36:40,242
of the "I Love Lucy"s andshe was playing a geisha.

1911
01:36:40,346 --> 01:36:46,593
And the white, white makeup,and she'd been crying a lot.

1912
01:36:46,697 --> 01:36:50,390
The guys were extremely red.

1913
01:36:50,494 --> 01:36:54,291
It gave her a rather,
in looking at her, what

1914
01:36:54,394 --> 01:36:56,189
I thought was a grotesque look.

1915
01:36:56,293 --> 01:36:58,605
Because the eyes-- and sad.

1916
01:36:58,709 --> 01:37:04,819
- But kisses, and hugs,and tears was the ending.

1917
01:37:04,922 --> 01:37:08,167
- It's a tragedy in many waysbecause they went at it for all

1918
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:11,032
the right reasons originally.

1919
01:37:11,135 --> 01:37:12,412
And the only reason
"I Love Lucy"

1920
01:37:12,516 --> 01:37:16,451
exists is because they
wanted to be together

1921
01:37:16,554 --> 01:37:21,525
so they could have a familyand make the marriage work.

1922
01:37:21,628 --> 01:37:23,147
So they made this show.

1923
01:37:23,251 --> 01:37:25,978
It took off like gangbusters.

1924
01:37:26,081 --> 01:37:30,154
And now the rest of
the universe has it.

1925
01:37:30,258 --> 01:37:32,605
And they never had it.

1926
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:34,020
They never got what they wanted.

1927
01:37:38,956 --> 01:37:43,443
Well, after my parentswere divorced, I know I--

1928
01:37:43,547 --> 01:37:46,032
I tried to have my mother
screen at our house,

1929
01:37:46,136 --> 01:37:49,208
because we could
screen movies there,

1930
01:37:49,311 --> 01:37:52,694
"The Parent Trap," whichwas a Disney movie starring

1931
01:37:52,797 --> 01:37:56,077
Haley Mills, who
played twin sisters who

1932
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:58,942
tried to get her to divorcedparents back together again.

1933
01:37:59,045 --> 01:38:00,564
- And it worked.
- And it worked.

1934
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:02,117
They get them back
together at the end

1935
01:38:02,221 --> 01:38:03,705
and there's the happy ending.

1936
01:38:03,808 --> 01:38:07,433
And still to this day,
I think that life is

1937
01:38:07,536 --> 01:38:10,712
about finding the happy ending.

1938
01:38:10,815 --> 01:38:13,094
- In my heart of
hearts, I thought

1939
01:38:13,197 --> 01:38:14,543
that she would go
back to my father

1940
01:38:14,647 --> 01:38:15,717
and they would work it out.

1941
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:17,995
And I think I'm not
the only kid in America

1942
01:38:18,099 --> 01:38:20,170
who probably did that.

1943
01:38:20,273 --> 01:38:22,517
- Desi was already
married to Edie.

1944
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:24,277
Gary and I were already married.

1945
01:38:24,381 --> 01:38:26,383
And we were stilllooking at "Parent Trap."

1946
01:38:26,486 --> 01:38:28,385
Until finally, the
seventh time, we said,

1947
01:38:28,488 --> 01:38:32,596
"Kids, now listen,
it's too late."

1948
01:38:35,426 --> 01:38:36,738
- Lucy got a little
more demanding

1949
01:38:36,841 --> 01:38:39,292
after she and Desi split up.

1950
01:38:39,396 --> 01:38:42,157
- "The Lucy Show!"

1951
01:38:42,261 --> 01:38:43,503
"Here's Lucy."

1952
01:38:43,607 --> 01:38:44,573
- She was by herself.

1953
01:38:44,677 --> 01:38:46,782
She looked around
and he wasn't there.

1954
01:38:46,886 --> 01:38:48,923
And so she said, "Oh, I gotto do it all by myself."

1955
01:38:49,026 --> 01:38:53,755
And she didn't know how
to do that tactfully.

1956
01:38:53,858 --> 01:38:56,137
- She treated all
the guest stars

1957
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,173
the same way she treated me.

1958
01:38:58,277 --> 01:39:00,796
I mean, it was "Moveover," "do this, do that."

1959
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:03,109
And I remember Jack
Benny, he's going--

1960
01:39:03,213 --> 01:39:07,320
she said, "Jack, for Christ'ssake, move it, come over here."

1961
01:39:07,424 --> 01:39:10,220
And finally, he turned to me,and he said, "Somebody tell her

1962
01:39:10,323 --> 01:39:11,773
she has the job."

1963
01:39:11,876 --> 01:39:13,844
- Now, cut that out!

1964
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:18,400
- I think for me, when
all of her series ended,

1965
01:39:18,504 --> 01:39:21,369
I think for her not
to have a workplace

1966
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:24,889
to go at 10:00 in the morningwas the biggest blow to her

1967
01:39:24,993 --> 01:39:25,960
of anything.

1968
01:39:26,063 --> 01:39:29,204
I think that's when she aged.

1969
01:39:29,308 --> 01:39:32,932
I think that's when a
certain bitterness came.

1970
01:39:33,036 --> 01:39:35,831
- She just became more
and more isolated.

1971
01:39:35,935 --> 01:39:38,903
That was my impression
of her as she got older.

1972
01:39:39,007 --> 01:39:40,388
- And then she got
into backgammon.

1973
01:39:40,491 --> 01:39:41,630
She could play backgammon.

1974
01:39:41,734 --> 01:39:43,494
As long as somebodywould sit across from her

1975
01:39:43,598 --> 01:39:45,462
and play with her,
she would play.

1976
01:39:45,565 --> 01:39:47,740
- Well, the public didn'tsee too much of my dad

1977
01:39:47,843 --> 01:39:49,362
in his later years,
but he taught

1978
01:39:49,466 --> 01:39:51,088
at San Diego State for a while.

1979
01:39:51,192 --> 01:39:54,264
And he wrote an autobiography,which did pretty good.

1980
01:39:54,367 --> 01:39:58,440
And then he pretty much
withdrew to Del Mar

1981
01:39:58,544 --> 01:40:01,374
and to a beautiful
home he built in Baja.

1982
01:40:01,478 --> 01:40:06,000
And he took care of hismother 'til the day he died.

1983
01:40:06,103 --> 01:40:12,765
- I think he was runningfrom his work, from the past.

1984
01:40:12,868 --> 01:40:15,216
He had great ideas, but
then he'd start drinking

1985
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:18,184
and he couldn't finish it.

1986
01:40:18,288 --> 01:40:21,946
"I'm happy down here," he'd say.

1987
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:24,432
And yet, he wasn't.

1988
01:40:24,535 --> 01:40:28,367
- He used to say, "Life is likethe road from La Paz to Las

1989
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:29,402
Cruces.

1990
01:40:29,506 --> 01:40:31,301
And some of it's
bumpy, and some of it's

1991
01:40:31,404 --> 01:40:33,889
smooth, so smooth it
takes your breath away.

1992
01:40:33,993 --> 01:40:36,168
But no matter what
happens, you can always

1993
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:37,755
convert a minus to a plus.

1994
01:40:37,859 --> 01:40:40,896
And don't be afraid to askthe man upstairs for help,

1995
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,521
no matter how unworthy
you think you may be."

1996
01:40:44,624 --> 01:40:46,833
This is what my
father told me when--

1997
01:40:46,937 --> 01:40:48,111
this is what I remember.

1998
01:40:48,214 --> 01:40:50,630
And yet, he was
saying it to himself

1999
01:40:50,734 --> 01:40:54,220
because he understoodcertain things about honesty

2000
01:40:54,324 --> 01:40:56,912
and about seeing
that you were wrong,

2001
01:40:57,016 --> 01:40:58,638
or seeing where
you made a mistake.

2002
01:40:58,742 --> 01:41:00,088
But yet it was hard for him.

2003
01:41:00,192 --> 01:41:02,573
It's hard-- the hardest thingfor any human being is to say,

2004
01:41:02,677 --> 01:41:06,301
you know, maybe, maybe
I made a mistake.

2005
01:41:06,405 --> 01:41:09,477
When I went through drug
and alcohol recovery,

2006
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:11,237
I went to stay with my father.

2007
01:41:11,341 --> 01:41:15,862
I had reached a point in my lifethrough a program that was--

2008
01:41:15,966 --> 01:41:17,381
I give credit to
for saving my life,

2009
01:41:17,485 --> 01:41:18,865
called the New Life
Foundation, that

2010
01:41:18,969 --> 01:41:20,729
helped me see certain things.

2011
01:41:20,833 --> 01:41:24,492
And dad went through recoverywith me four years later.

2012
01:41:24,595 --> 01:41:27,253
And that was probablythe most courageous thing

2013
01:41:27,357 --> 01:41:28,737
that dad ever did.

2014
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:31,913
But physically, it was too late.

2015
01:41:32,016 --> 01:41:35,675
- At the end, he wanted
to be at the beach.

2016
01:41:35,779 --> 01:41:38,402
He'd fish and watch sunsets.

2017
01:41:38,506 --> 01:41:44,650
And she wanted to be aloneand play games with friends.

2018
01:41:44,753 --> 01:41:49,068
They could have
done that in 1951.

2019
01:41:49,172 --> 01:41:51,933
I don't know.

2020
01:41:52,036 --> 01:42:00,217
- I think Lucy and Desi wereso intertwined emotionally,

2021
01:42:00,321 --> 01:42:03,393
their lives, their professionallife and their private life.

2022
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:08,156
It was hard for
either one of them

2023
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:11,608
to give up the other completely.

2024
01:42:11,711 --> 01:42:14,231
And I doubt if they did.

2025
01:42:14,335 --> 01:42:17,476
- He would sit with me and cry.

2026
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:21,687
He actually cried some timesin talking about how much

2027
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:25,518
he loved her and how terribleit was that they were divorced.

2028
01:42:25,622 --> 01:42:28,935
And he loved her
to his dying day.

2029
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:32,353
- When she talked
about your daddy,

2030
01:42:32,456 --> 01:42:36,874
when he was no longer comingto the house, she cried.

2031
01:42:39,601 --> 01:42:43,226
And she would say, that
was the love of my life

2032
01:42:43,329 --> 01:42:45,987
but I couldn't take it anymore.

2033
01:42:48,714 --> 01:42:53,167
- What would I say to Lucy ifshe was standing right here?

2034
01:42:53,270 --> 01:43:01,347
- I would say, I wouldsay, "Aunt Lucy, it's OK,

2035
01:43:01,451 --> 01:43:04,419
let us all in.
We love you."

2036
01:43:07,905 --> 01:43:18,019
And I would say to my UncleDesi, I would say, "Stay.

2037
01:43:18,122 --> 01:43:20,090
We want you.

2038
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:22,196
We love you.
Let's be a family."

2039
01:43:25,578 --> 01:43:29,858
- I think my favorite homemovie scenes are of my parents

2040
01:43:29,962 --> 01:43:34,932
playing with my brother Desiand me in the pool, just us.
