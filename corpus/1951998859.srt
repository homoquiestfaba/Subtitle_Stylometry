1
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:23,679
<i>(Professor Broom) In 1944, a demon was
summoned to the Earth to wage war.</i>

2
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:26,446
<i>But the child of Hell
was rescued by good men</i>

3
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:29,718
<i>who taught him honour, kindness,
and a sense of right.</i>

4
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:32,406
<i>The scientists and researchers
that gathered around the boy</i>

5
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:35,962
<i>became the Bureau for
Paranormal Research and Defence,</i>

6
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:38,475
<i>an international organisation
that protects the world</i>

7
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:41,200
<i>from occult and supernatural threats.</i>

8
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:44,080
<i>There are things
that go bump in the night.</i>

9
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,322
<i>We are the ones who bump back.</i>

10
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:53,197
<i>(Woman's voice) Can this be him...</i>

11
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,637
<i>the one I have waited
centuries to see?</i>

12
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:59,155
<i>How strange.</i>

13
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:03,962
<i>So far from his path
that I barely see the promise of glory.</i>

14
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,282
<i>Can this be him...</i>

15
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,124
<i>this Hellboy?</i>

16
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,400
Oh, crap!

17
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:12,766
(Abe) Is something wrong?

18
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:15,196
No... Yeah.

19
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:18,205
I'm standing up to my butt in crap,
that's what's wrong.

20
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:19,885
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

21
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:23,442
I got all turned around.
It's like a damn maze down here.

22
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,079
A maze of crap.

23
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:27,163
(Abe) Isn't that why we're here?

24
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,003
Company.

25
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:34,921
(Heavy footsteps)

26
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:39,044
(Roaring)

27
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,402
Crap!

28
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:09,085
Don't suppose this will work.

29
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:11,197
No, but it'll piss him off.

30
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:12,726
Go wide.

31
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,840
That's it!

32
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:59,960
I'll have to
remember that trick.

33
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:05,398
I'm guessing that's important.

34
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:06,721
(Groans)

35
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,200
No, I've got it.

36
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,006
Crap.

37
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:28,205
So, who do you think this is?

38
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,319
Not Hephaestus, surely.
Daedalus?

39
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,403
He designed the labyrinth.

40
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:35,882
Don't care.

41
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,326
(Growls)

42
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,561
Hey, Liz.

43
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:40,837
You can tell the professor
he was right.

44
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:43,196
- We took care of it.
- You can tell him in the morning.

45
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:44,566
He's already in bed.

46
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:47,644
All right. See you soon.

47
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,564
Who are these mortals,
who would have you

48
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:51,996
turn your back on your own kind?

49
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,161
Who?

50
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:56,396
(Distant howling)

51
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,723
(Rats squeaking)

52
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,596
Professor!
Professor Broom!

53
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:05,676
- You think she's here?
- Somewhere close. They both are.

54
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,085
(Gasps)

55
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:16,043
(Whimpers)

56
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:17,725
(Gasps)

57
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,246
(Creaking)

58
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,715
(Screaming)

59
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,766
Father?

60
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,525
I am all right.

61
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,000
It's just...

62
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:38,358
Your fiancée,
she could still be alive.

63
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:41,319
But there's not much time before...

64
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,880
What?

65
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,883
- Blood.
- Fresh blood.

66
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,679
Father...

67
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:56,480
we will need you.

68
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:57,801
Yes.

69
00:06:57,847 --> 00:07:00,042
Yes, of course.

70
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:14,487
(Banging)

71
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:18,956
Anna!

72
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,557
No! No!

73
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:23,881
Anna.

74
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:26,805
No! Not my Anna!

75
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,236
My sweet Anna!

76
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,005
(Sobbing)

77
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:56,605
Father, will you help?

78
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,645
No.

79
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:03,598
No. I...

80
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:05,399
I can't!

81
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:15,079
Yes.

82
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,083
If it will bring her peace.

83
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:30,120
(Loud clank)

84
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,158
We still have to find her.

85
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:34,765
Then assist me with this.

86
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:38,559
(Grinding)

87
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,201
Empty.

88
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,119
- (Gasps)
- Huh?

89
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:51,400
Where is he?

90
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,119
(Dripping)

91
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,322
Erzsebet Ondrushko.

92
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:06,880
Ah.

93
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:13,321
Ha!

94
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,358
(Men whimpering)

95
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,757
Wait! Stay together!

96
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,564
Come to me.

97
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:28,085
Stop! We mustn't panic!

98
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:46,004
Please! Stay together!

99
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:47,844
(Howling)

100
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,526
- We have to get out!
- No!

101
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,125
Run, Professor!

102
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,839
No!

103
00:09:57,967 --> 00:09:59,878
(Barking sounds)

104
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:02,202
(Woman screaming)

105
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:25,285
You brought the others,

106
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:28,444
yet you did not flee with them.

107
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:30,364
Something to calm your nerves?

108
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:31,806
Holy water.

109
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,281
- Oh!
- (Sizzling)

110
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:49,322
My face.

111
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:53,440
You! You've stolen my beauty!

112
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,556
(Roars)

113
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:03,680
(Gasps)

114
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:32,005
(Grunts)

115
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,844
(Growling)

116
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,165
(Sighs)

117
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,239
(Knock on door)

118
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,400
Missed you at breakfast.

119
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,245
I just... overslept.

120
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,686
OK.

121
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,718
See you at the briefing.

122
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,637
No. No, no,
they were in Pakistan.

123
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:45,757
I'm sure of it.
How could I forget?

124
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,561
We found them after dealing
with that sand demon thing.

125
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:51,279
Or was it the Andes?

126
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,283
Actually, I believe
it was in Tangiers.

127
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:56,399
- Boy, can't wait until I see a little action.
- Careful.

128
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,120
I connect it with the ghouls
under Sidi Kasem.

129
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,442
Really? I remember webs.
Lots of webs.

130
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:03,762
You're both wrong.
They were in Budapest.

131
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:06,486
Of course.

132
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:08,757
- After the run-in with...
- That thing!

133
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:11,640
- In the choir loft...
- Mm-hm. With the arms.

134
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:12,802
Yeah!

135
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:17,159
Oh, God! What was
the name of that place? The... The...

136
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:18,401
The Monkey Paw.

137
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,642
Yes! The Monkey Paw!

138
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,882
Yep. That's where we found 'em.

139
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,076
Found what?

140
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:26,516
The best pastries on earth.

141
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,797
Excellent. The very best.

142
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:30,326
Yeah.

143
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:34,155
These?
This... is crap.

144
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:37,557
- Hi, guys.
- Good morning, everyone.

145
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,006
Professor Broom.

146
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:42,517
Professor Corrigan and I have
just a few assignments to... assign

147
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,286
and then we can all get on with our day,
how's that sound?

148
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,205
Coffee's cold.

149
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:57,881
Hot!

150
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:01,999
- You'd think he'd learn.
- Yeah, you'd think.

151
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:04,607
All right, then.
Let's get started.

152
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:06,638
Hellboy, you're going to Tibet.

153
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:08,325
You'll team up with Mr Clark.

154
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:11,598
Now, the Trung-Rom Monastery.

155
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:12,636
Yeah.

156
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:15,759
Reputedly built from
the bones of 9,000 monks.

157
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,083
It was dismantled and burned
by the Mongols in the 13th century.

158
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,846
800 years. Now it's back.

159
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:24,799
Is it just me or could we use
a nice, big conference table?

160
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:26,326
It's just you.

161
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,846
Miss Sherman, Mr Sapien,

162
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:29,684
you'll be going to British Columbia.

163
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:32,639
Ogopogo has been sighted again
in Lake Okanagan.

164
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:35,724
This time it's evidently
flipped a couple of houseboats.

165
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:38,645
- Think I'm being typecast?
- (Chuckles) Aren't we all?

166
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:41,563
Professor Broom?

167
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:42,881
Thank you.

168
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:45,760
All right. We've got
one more for this morning.

169
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:47,763
Small thing. A favour, really.

170
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,482
A friend of the Bureau
has requested an investigation.

171
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:52,846
An old house in the Hamptons

172
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:55,685
has just been purchased
by Oliver Trombolt.

173
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:58,082
Trombolt? The hotel and casino guy?

174
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:00,243
Yes, he wants to open it as a resort.

175
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,960
And... says it's haunted.

176
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,281
Oh, God.

177
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:07,125
Can you say "publicity stunt"?

178
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,516
A waste of time.

179
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,719
Look, Trombolt is a good friend
of Senator Langsford

180
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:17,521
and the Senator has his hands
in the BPRD budget.

181
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,001
So, no haunted house investigation,

182
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:21,116
no more doughnuts.

183
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,839
No more research equipment.

184
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,878
- No more...
- Give it to the new kid.

185
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,406
- Mr Leach.
- Thanks.

186
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:29,678
Excuse me
but I think it would be wise

187
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:32,480
to have Hellboy handle
the Hampton house.

188
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:33,642
Right!

189
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:36,520
The Senator would love
having a top agent like Hellboy

190
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,966
make an appearance.

191
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:40,043
Hmm. Top agent.

192
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:43,045
But it's more manpower
than the assignment requires,

193
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:46,045
and, well, we need Hellboy
in Tibet with Mr Clark...

194
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:48,442
and the 9,000 dead monks in...

195
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:52,275
Liz and Abraham should go too.

196
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,363
What about me?
Maybe I should go.

197
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:56,363
No, that won't be necessary.

198
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,602
It's more manpower than...

199
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:00,319
You see, it's just a political favour.

200
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,564
Oh, for God sake!
It's a publicity stunt, for cryin' out loud!

201
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:04,676
I have a hunch.

202
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:07,400
Oh, a hunch?
Oh, well, sure. Go. We'll...

203
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:10,245
just post a "No Swimming"
sign on Lake Okanagan.

204
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:11,686
Hey, everybody go!

205
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:14,525
We can wait another 800 years
for the bones to reappear in Tibet.

206
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,127
Or I could take a team
to Tibet without Hellboy.

207
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,646
Waller's back from Jakarta.

208
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,996
Fine. Just draw straws
for who goes where.

209
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,924
Wonderful idea.

210
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,277
The element of chance
will let fate take a hand.

211
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:27,601
Now, let's get started.

212
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,161
I just have to round up a few things.

213
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,163
We should leave within the hour.

214
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:33,481
We?

215
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:42,244
I mean, what's it been,
six, seven years?

216
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:43,481
More like 15.

217
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:46,325
I'm just saying.
Long time between missions.

218
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,436
I don't know.

219
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:49,557
You don't have to.
It's his decision.

220
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:52,804
But we're just gonna
have to watch him.

221
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,444
Uh, watch your step, sir.

222
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,445
Hellboy, I'm fine.
You needn't worry.

223
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,443
- Here you go, Professor.
- Thank you.

224
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,398
It's a trifle heavy.

225
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:07,803
A few special tools, just in case.

226
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,806
So, I heard Trombolt
inherited his money.

227
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,838
I guess if you're gonna
inherit something,

228
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,401
it might as well be money.

229
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:34,045
Miss Sherman,

230
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,521
you mind if take a look
at the assignment folder?

231
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,636
Call me Liz.

232
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:39,279
Call me Abe.

233
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,359
Call me...

234
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,125
only if you really need me.

235
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:48,079
Don't mind him.
He gets crabbier every year.

236
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:51,039
And he's older than he looks,
so that's a lot of crabbiness.

237
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,206
(Sniffs)

238
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:55,158
Somebody have garlic for lunch?

239
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,437
(Corrigan) Don't look at me!
Now, about the case...

240
00:17:57,487 --> 00:18:00,399
there might be something here.
I've done a little research.

241
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,200
The Hampton house
has some history to it.

242
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:06,762
It was built by a millionaire eccentric.
A real nut job.

243
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:10,959
In the '20s, he played host
to a pagan fertility cult.

244
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,963
Who knows what went on?

245
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:14,406
Looks like a fun crowd.

246
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:17,405
There is some anecdotal
evidence of hauntings.

247
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:19,517
The usual stuff -
shadowy apparitions,

248
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,365
flickering lights,
swinging chandeliers, cold spots.

249
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:26,400
Which usually mean someone
left a window open.

250
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:29,041
- Wanna tell us why we're really going?
- Not yet.

251
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,725
Not until I'm sure.

252
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:36,080
- Are you sure you're ready?
- I'm quite fine, Father.

253
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:40,882
I'm just not used to the elevation
like you mountain men.

254
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:42,519
A moment's rest and I'll be ready to go.

255
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:46,162
No, no. I meant...
the sun is setting.

256
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:50,200
Would it not better if we came back
tomorrow in the daylight?

257
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:53,239
No, there is no time.
She has Anna.

258
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:54,925
We cannot wait.

259
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,958
Not if the girl is to have a chance.

260
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:59,760
We have dealt with
vampires before, Father.

261
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:03,004
A stake through the heart,
a clove of garlic on the tongue

262
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:06,198
and the villagers will
sleep peacefully again.

263
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,477
(Howling)

264
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:11,678
This one is clever.

265
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:14,844
But tonight, we send her to hell.

266
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:18,595
- Will we?
- You must have faith.

267
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,683
Yes. Yes, of course.

268
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,685
The power of God will protect us.

269
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:25,718
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

270
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:28,076
- "I shall fear no..."
- (Shrieking)

271
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:30,286
What was that?

272
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:32,557
Some sort of birds. Big ones.

273
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:35,758
Eagles. Hunting.

274
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,798
Just like us.

275
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,085
Keep that close, Father.

276
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:51,120
A vampire cannot bear
the sight of a cross.

277
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:56,315
Actually, it is the faith of the person
holding it that gives it power.

278
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:57,561
You'll be fine.

279
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:24,402
May I help you?

280
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:28,646
You're kidding, right?

281
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,521
We are from the Bureau
for Paranormal Research and Defence.

282
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,364
I believe we are expected.

283
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:35,999
Please come in.

284
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,078
Wonderful! You're here!

285
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,480
I'm Oliver Trombolt.

286
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:58,566
And of course I already know who you are.

287
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,882
Hellboy.

288
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,280
Liz Sherman.

289
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,760
Abe Sapien.

290
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,479
Ah, Professor Broom.

291
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:07,563
Founding father of the BPRD.

292
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:08,881
I'm honoured, sir.

293
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:10,599
And...

294
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,606
Agent Sidney Leach,
human metal detector.

295
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,524
Pleased to meet you.

296
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:19,799
Ah, yes, I'm sure that's very useful.

297
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:22,600
I know all about you
and your organisation.

298
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,638
And we've heard lots about you.

299
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:37,041
Nice digs.

300
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,998
Tell me you're not serious.

301
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,438
I hope this will be suitable.

302
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:51,284
Had them bring in some tables.

303
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:52,919
Plenty of power outlets.

304
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:54,559
No, this is great.

305
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,005
I'll set up.

306
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,356
We'll try to stay out of your way.

307
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:02,806
I'm impressed.

308
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:05,520
The Bureau actually
sent their A-team.

309
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:08,843
- Hey!
- It's for the brochure.

310
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:10,764
We don't do photo-ops.

311
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:15,041
Right, right.
Maybe we can get some later.

312
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:16,725
You and me out in front of the house?

313
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:22,039
Maybe when the Senator stops by.

314
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:25,679
You know, I've seen
some pretty strange things

315
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,558
since I bought this house.

316
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,677
- Really?
- But to tell the truth,

317
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:32,400
I'm not so sure I believe in ghosts.

318
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:34,961
Well, we hear that a lot.
Thermal camera?

319
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:38,761
Yeah, wouldn't want
to miss any cold spots.

320
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,286
I'll get it.

321
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,682
Ask me, this guy's just out
to make a buck.

322
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,285
You're most likely right.

323
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:48,605
But that doesn't mean there isn't
something happening in this house.

324
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:50,966
I did what you asked.
Leave me alone.

325
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,565
I did what you asked.
Leave me alone.

326
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:56,202
Fool! Your work is not done.

327
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:03,645
All right. Check the signal.

328
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,006
It's decent.

329
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:07,436
Wouldn't video cables
cut down on interference though?

330
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:09,637
Haven't used them
since a poltergeist

331
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,679
hung Raf Hurtado by his
heels in the Whaley House.

332
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:14,718
- Really?
- Occupational hazard.

333
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,803
The motion sensor
goes down there.

334
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:19,725
He was upside down for four hours!

335
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,359
We found him after two,

336
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:24,205
but that guy was such a jerk.

337
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:27,036
Did you...
Should I take a picture?

338
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:28,156
Dang!

339
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,198
Of what? A closed door?

340
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:33,876
Relax. I'm sure you'll get plenty of
thrills 'n' chills before we're done.

341
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,963
Is that why
Professor Broom is here?

342
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:37,122
I don't know.

343
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,364
It's not like we haven't faced
scary stuff without him.

344
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:41,886
Real scary stuff.

345
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:43,918
Give me the sensor.

346
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:49,922
Hellboy acts like he's going to
fall down and snap something.

347
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:51,958
This thing doesn't
have a battery in it.

348
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:54,362
Oh, I'm sorry. I've got some here.

349
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:56,841
- They're really close, aren't they?
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:59,481
You know, not everybody
thought keeping a demon

351
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:02,599
that the Nazis summoned
to win World War 2 was a good thing.

352
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:03,841
Kill it!

353
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:06,879
It's a demon come from hell
to destroy us all!

354
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:09,441
Aw, it looks more like a little boy.

355
00:24:10,687 --> 00:24:11,676
Hellboy.

356
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:15,322
The professor raised him like a son
on an Air Force base in New Mexico.

357
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,846
That's got it.

358
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:19,162
So yeah, they're about as close as...

359
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,322
What?

360
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:21,959
The statues are crying.

361
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:29,836
Huh. Check for plumbing.

362
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:32,447
Remember, Trombolt
bought this place for tourists.

363
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:34,603
It's not for tourists.

364
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:39,998
(Liz) Are you guys OK?

365
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:41,082
Hellboy's not here.

366
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:44,039
You know how he is with delicate
equipment. Anything wrong?

367
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:47,716
(Liz) We've definitely got a ghost.
Young woman, Eastern European.

368
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:50,998
Sort of a peasant girl,
if that makes any sense.

369
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:55,484
Wait a minute.
Temperature's dropping.

370
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:10,126
Huh?

371
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:14,483
Liz? I think we have
more than one.

372
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:16,916
I'll meet you back in the parlour.

373
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,717
Come on.
Somebody's in here.

374
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,525
Show me what you got.

375
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,964
I'm not gonna hurt you
unless you make me.

376
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:37,045
So, there is something going on here.
Just how big is it?

377
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:39,399
What did you see?

378
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:40,641
Ghosts.

379
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:42,325
Looking for help, I think.

380
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,562
But they didn't want me.

381
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:46,040
You can't stay, Professor.

382
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:48,965
I'm no longer Director
of Field Operations

383
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,884
but I'm not ready to retire.

384
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:54,283
I'm not saying that.
But you shouldn't be here. You're too...

385
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:55,396
Old?

386
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,679
I'm sorry I don't share your
seemingly eternal youth.

387
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,715
You grew so fast at first.

388
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:08,885
In no time at all,
you were too big to spank.

389
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:12,158
Only cos the tail got in the way.

390
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:14,277
(Trombolt) So everything is in place.

391
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:18,036
So, do you think you might
get something tonight?

392
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:20,806
- We might get lucky.
- You too?

393
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,404
This is amazing stuff! Amazing.

394
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:27,722
It truly is. I don't
know what to say.

395
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:30,679
Yet, he just keeps talking.

396
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:32,638
Ah. Here you go. Some snacks.

397
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:34,723
Please, help yourselves.

398
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:48,636
- Going somewhere?
- I never stay in after dark.

399
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:55,797
(Liz) OK, let's cut the lights
and see if anyone pops up.

400
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:06,964
(Beeping)

401
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:08,963
Huh.

402
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:11,360
I think...

403
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:13,398
I think I'm getting a reading.

404
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:15,802
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

405
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,836
- Aah!
- (Crackling on headphones)

406
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,840
- Which rooms are these?
- (Liz) All of them.

407
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:28,196
They're everywhere!

408
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:32,926
What the hell? Where'd they go?

409
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,959
Professor!

410
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,405
(Prays in Latin)

411
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:12,319
Are you OK?

412
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:16,321
They were so frightened.

413
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:34,524
I was right.
This place is a gold mine.

414
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,125
Not if we have to quarantine.

415
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:38,806
Ah, let's not be too hasty.

416
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:41,998
A few ghosts, that can't be
that bad, can it?

417
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,878
It is very bad.

418
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:45,485
Devil.

419
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:46,846
Witch.

420
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:48,161
Hell.

421
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:52,598
And the names Marianna Molnar
and Treszka Balogh,

422
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:56,037
the two witches who trained
Erzsebet Ondrushko.

423
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:57,918
Ah, the Hungarian Blood Countess.

424
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:01,721
She thought bathing in the blood of
young women would keep her young.

425
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:05,362
Now we just go
to the plastic surgeon.

426
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:07,680
I've researched her.

427
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:10,958
In fact, she'll be the central image
of my marketing campaign.

428
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:13,157
Sexy witch, spooky legend.

429
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:15,596
It's the perfect thing
for these people.

430
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,605
It's not legend, it's fact.

431
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:21,036
Those spirits were her victims.

432
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:24,079
While she lived,
Erzsebet tortured and murdered

433
00:30:24,127 --> 00:30:28,325
613 young women
to feed her vanity.

434
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:32,883
But her worst atrocities didn't happen
until after she was dead.

435
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:34,918
Vampire.

436
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:39,085
But you... destroyed her in 1939.

437
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:40,560
So I thought.

438
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:43,280
The point remains that, altogether,

439
00:30:43,327 --> 00:30:47,240
Erzsebet is responsible for slaughtering
over a thousand people.

440
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:50,962
Yes, well, maybe not everything
has to go in the brochure.

441
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:55,842
It could be someone is trying
to bring back Erzsebet.

442
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,843
A hunch?

443
00:30:57,887 --> 00:31:02,244
If there's no body, they would need
something intimately connected to her.

444
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:03,960
Huh?

445
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:14,963
Yeah. That'd probably do it.

446
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:24,564
Hecate. Greek goddess
and Queen of the Witches.

447
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:26,245
As a vampire,

448
00:31:26,287 --> 00:31:29,916
Erzsebet claimed to be
a high priestess to Hecate.

449
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:33,357
We may be dealing with
something larger here.

450
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:36,160
There are things in this world
that modern man

451
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:39,597
relegates to fairy tales
and video games.

452
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,480
But they are real. They are ugly,

453
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:46,236
and they demand terrible
payments for their "gifts".

454
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,686
No gifts here.

455
00:31:47,727 --> 00:31:50,002
These weren't cheap.
They're all originals.

456
00:31:50,047 --> 00:31:52,686
Had them shipped from
the ruins of Erzsebet's castle.

457
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:56,316
Cost quite a bit to restore too.

458
00:31:56,367 --> 00:32:00,326
I would imagine
they're still quite effective.

459
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,683
It's wax.

460
00:32:10,727 --> 00:32:12,399
Just place it over there.

461
00:32:18,007 --> 00:32:20,601
She's very beautiful.

462
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,036
Was very beautiful.

463
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:25,317
And she knew it.

464
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:28,200
Her vanity became her obsession.

465
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,319
Instead of losing her beauty,

466
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,562
she lost her soul.

467
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:42,678
(Wind whistling)

468
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,718
(Bird cawing)

469
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:05,400
(Creaking)

470
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:09,599
Hello?

471
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:14,083
Is someone there?

472
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,758
- (Growling)
- (Gasps)

473
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,242
(Screams)

474
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:42,245
(Whimpers)

475
00:33:47,647 --> 00:33:49,558
I know you are coming.

476
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:52,326
You and that Englishman.

477
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:53,595
You should not.

478
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:55,558
Who?

479
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:57,518
You know.

480
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:58,996
How?

481
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:03,165
How could I invade
the sanctity of this church?

482
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,483
Please. You put your faith
in wood and plaster.

483
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:09,519
But where is your saviour?

484
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:13,321
Lt... lt is a symbol of God's... Huh?

485
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:18,282
My goddess gives me power
and eternal beauty.

486
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:20,204
Your God, what?

487
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:21,885
False hope?

488
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:25,283
Unanswered prayers?

489
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:27,318
A better life after death?

490
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,846
I have that too.

491
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:36,316
You are the forsaken one, Father.

492
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:40,006
Ah!

493
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:51,876
Yes, I'm serious.

494
00:34:51,927 --> 00:34:54,839
They shot straight through us.
Must have been a hundred of them.

495
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:59,642
I mean, Marcos, you realise
I didn't anticipate any of this.

496
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:00,802
Back out?

497
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:01,882
Are you crazy?

498
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:03,997
I'm doubling my ticket prices.

499
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:07,005
Find me more houses like this!
We'll franchise!

500
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:09,925
Not sure what to do
about the professor, though.

501
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:12,640
Tends to be a bit... morbid.

502
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:16,441
Yeah. Takes all the fun out of a haunting.

503
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:20,876
Sure, sure. I'll...
I'll think of something.

504
00:35:20,927 --> 00:35:23,805
OK. Yeah, OK.
I'll talk to you later.

505
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,041
Bye.

506
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:29,798
(Distant howling)

507
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:41,838
(Liz) Everything's normal on video.

508
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:44,720
Of course, we don't have
cameras in every room.

509
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,043
Not in the budget.
Thank you, Senator Langsford.

510
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:49,759
- (Electronic noise)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

511
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:52,162
I've got some kind of weird sounds.

512
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:55,479
I can't pin it down.

513
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,882
(Yawns)

514
00:35:57,927 --> 00:35:59,076
Great.

515
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:07,844
Abe, why don't you and me
go check things out?

516
00:36:07,887 --> 00:36:10,162
Maybe we can stir something up.

517
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:12,562
- I'll go too!
- Sure.

518
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:13,881
He'll protect us.

519
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:16,683
Maybe you can keep
an eye on the professor.

520
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:18,121
You know, he's...

521
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:20,397
Yeah. He's special to all of us.

522
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:25,121
Come on, guys.
What are we waiting for?

523
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,958
It is time, sister.

524
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:35,599
The stars are right.

525
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:51,203
All ye gods of the groves,
all ye gods of the night,

526
00:36:51,247 --> 00:36:52,726
be with us now.

527
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:56,203
Let the triple goddess
aid us, favour us.

528
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:00,444
Renew your servant.

529
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,604
Feed flesh and sinew,
bone and tooth.

530
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,395
Return our priestess.

531
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:47,806
(Gasps)

532
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:09,236
Oh! You must be Anna!

533
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,324
Come here, child,
where we can see you.

534
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:15,280
Do I know you?

535
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:16,965
(Laughs)

536
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:21,319
Oh, everyone in the village
knows of the bride-to-be.

537
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,404
So beautiful, isn't she, sister?

538
00:38:24,447 --> 00:38:27,564
Yes, and so young, like a kitten.

539
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:31,156
But you can't stay out in the night
with a couple of chattering old women.

540
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:32,606
It's not safe.

541
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:35,798
No, definitely not safe.

542
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,806
We've seen your wedding gown.
Oh, so beautiful.

543
00:38:39,847 --> 00:38:42,281
Hurry along now!

544
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:45,717
Yes, my wedding gown.
Excuse me, then.

545
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:48,884
I shouldn't keep Marie waiting.
Goodbye.

546
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,680
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

547
00:38:55,807 --> 00:38:58,367
Hello, Marie! How does it look?

548
00:38:58,407 --> 00:39:01,046
Will it be beautiful? Marie?

549
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,357
Oh. I'm sorry if I startled you.

550
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:08,116
Here, let me take your coat
so we can get started.

551
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,442
Mm, what a lovely scent.

552
00:39:10,487 --> 00:39:11,806
Where is Marie?

553
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:13,599
She is upstairs with the baby.

554
00:39:13,647 --> 00:39:16,878
It was not feeling well
and took a turn for the worse.

555
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:20,283
I said her place
was at the baby's side

556
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:21,840
and I would take care of you.

557
00:39:21,887 --> 00:39:24,959
But she said there was
to be a final fitting.

558
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:26,599
Are you a... seamstress?

559
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:29,161
Oh! One of the best, they say.

560
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:31,004
Oh, my gown!

561
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:33,163
I came here right from the opera.

562
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:36,517
So young, like a kitten.

563
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:39,365
I had no time to change.

564
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:42,046
But... I could come back.

565
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:43,645
Nonsense.

566
00:39:43,687 --> 00:39:46,076
How could you walk away
from this?

567
00:39:46,127 --> 00:39:47,799
Oh!

568
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:53,601
It is wonderful!
How is the veil?

569
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:57,401
Made of the finest lace,
but I don't want to cover the rosy cheeks

570
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:59,358
of such a young girl.

571
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:02,399
(Giggles) You talk like an old woman.

572
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:04,836
You couldn't be older than my sister.

573
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:06,764
Your... older sister?

574
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:08,479
- Yes.
- Really?

575
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:09,755
That old.

576
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,640
I'm so glad I came.
I almost didn't.

577
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:14,837
The killings, those girls.

578
00:40:14,887 --> 00:40:17,117
You aren't afraid of the vampire?

579
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,362
Father Lupescu says no vampire

580
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:22,604
would dare enter a village
protected by his church.

581
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:25,719
Then I have the priest
to thank for your visit.

582
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:28,156
I must return the favour.

583
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:30,277
But he did meet
with the Englishman

584
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,797
who is supposed to be an expert
on such things as vampires.

585
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:35,360
(Gasps)

586
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:39,839
I am something of an expert myself.

587
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:42,355
(Growling)

588
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,523
(Anna screams)

589
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:50,959
(Door opens)

590
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,157
(Growling)

591
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:10,518
(Broom) What was that?

592
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:13,721
Sorry, Professor,
just the equipment acting up.

593
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:15,564
- Go on back to sleep.
- (Alarm)

594
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,404
Huh?

595
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:19,324
The basement motion detector.

596
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:21,801
Stay where you are.
We'll check it out.

597
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:23,075
About time.

598
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:24,879
Something's in the torture chamber.

599
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,886
It's just the old man.

600
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:31,487
Little late for a stroll.
You a sleepwalker?

601
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:36,555
I... I am the one who sold these...
showpieces to Mr Trombolt.

602
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:39,360
I must go. I have work to do.

603
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:40,396
What?

604
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:46,204
- Blood. That's blood.
- Where did it come from?

605
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:49,045
(Whimpers) No... I...

606
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:51,043
(Abe) Over here.

607
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:57,285
OK, cover your eyes.

608
00:41:57,327 --> 00:41:59,318
Wait! Let me.

609
00:42:05,207 --> 00:42:08,040
Human metal detector, remember?

610
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:09,361
Least he's not a psychic.

611
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:14,879
I'm thinking maybe
hidden doorway and, uh...

612
00:42:14,927 --> 00:42:16,758
Yep. Heh-heh. Here it is.

613
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:19,320
(Clunking)

614
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:34,726
Trombolt.

615
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:41,196
He's been drained of his blood.

616
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,126
I... I found it.

617
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:45,436
Talk!

618
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:48,485
I didn't want to.

619
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:50,483
- Go on!
- I... I can't.

620
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:53,405
I saw you look at the professor.
What was that about?

621
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,199
Stop! He didn't do anything.

622
00:43:02,887 --> 00:43:05,196
You're the priest.

623
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:08,364
I was once a priest.

624
00:43:08,407 --> 00:43:11,843
- I thought you were staying back.
- Oh, like he would listen to me.

625
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:14,720
He was with me
when I last confronted Erzsebet.

626
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:16,837
- Are you all right?
- Erzsebet!

627
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,639
They are raising her!

628
00:43:18,687 --> 00:43:21,155
She will need the blood
when she wakes.

629
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:25,241
This is your chance
to redeem yourself.

630
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:27,596
Where is she?

631
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,478
- In the grove.
- Take us there.

632
00:43:29,527 --> 00:43:31,279
No. Please.

633
00:43:31,927 --> 00:43:34,202
That's all right.

634
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:36,124
You've done enough for us.

635
00:43:40,207 --> 00:43:41,242
Thank you, Father.

636
00:43:47,927 --> 00:43:48,916
Thank you.

637
00:44:04,047 --> 00:44:07,198
There is no redemption
for you tonight.

638
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:09,715
You have betrayed our Queen.

639
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:12,281
She still has work for you.

640
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,839
(Groaning)

641
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:28,480
(Bell tolling, monks chanting)

642
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,441
Anna, Anna.

643
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:39,241
This is a time for you to be
celebrating, not worrying.

644
00:44:39,287 --> 00:44:41,278
You have a wedding
to prepare for.

645
00:44:41,327 --> 00:44:46,321
But the terrible...
three women in one week.

646
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:48,642
And the way they were found.

647
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,837
Victims of some beast.

648
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:54,721
A wolf perhaps. Not a vampire.

649
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:57,839
What vampire would
dare trespass here?

650
00:44:57,887 --> 00:45:01,846
The church, this church,
is too strong.

651
00:45:01,887 --> 00:45:04,481
I walk these streets without fear.

652
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:09,237
In the bible, Joshua tells us,
"Be bold and strong!

653
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:10,925
"Banish fear and doubt!

654
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:14,676
"For remember, the Lord your God
is with you wherever you go."

655
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:17,605
And where you have to go is to Marie's

656
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:19,922
for that final fitting
of your wedding dress.

657
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,117
Oh, yes. Indeed.

658
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,725
Goodbye, Father.

659
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:25,325
Thank you!

660
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:32,006
Oh, thank you.

661
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:39,243
Good afternoon, Father Lupescu.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

662
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:40,925
Not at all, Professor Broom.

663
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,527
I have been looking forward
to meeting you.

664
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:44,841
I have to admit,

665
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:47,924
when the others told me
of your interest in this matter,

666
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:50,276
I was... concerned.

667
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:53,319
- For my safety?
- Not precisely.

668
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:54,800
Your profession.

669
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:59,079
You work with spiritualists,
mediums, attend séances.

670
00:46:01,287 --> 00:46:05,041
Is there not a danger of falling into step
with the wrong element?

671
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:07,965
Do you not fear being influenced
by the forces of evil?

672
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:10,680
Not if I remain strong in my beliefs.

673
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:12,001
I know you doubt

674
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:14,880
but the trouble here
is the work of a vampire, Father.

675
00:46:14,927 --> 00:46:17,521
A vampire aligned
with an ancient goddess

676
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:20,001
who has given her incredible power.

677
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:22,515
I will have no talk of false gods
in this house of faith!

678
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:25,365
I apologise, Father.
I meant no insult.

679
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,921
We must all hold on to our faith,

680
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:31,357
for in the end, it is the only thing
that will save us.

681
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:39,840
(Growling)

682
00:46:39,887 --> 00:46:42,640
- What's that?
- The old man was alone, wasn't he?

683
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:45,238
We must get to the grove!

684
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:46,515
(Growling)

685
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:14,243
Get to the grove! We'll be fine!

686
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,198
You're starting to piss me off.

687
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:35,159
(Grunting)

688
00:47:52,087 --> 00:47:54,442
- (Groaning)
- (Chains rattling)

689
00:47:59,527 --> 00:48:01,836
A curious one, eh, sister?

690
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:05,357
His cold blood
is of no use to the Priestess.

691
00:48:05,407 --> 00:48:08,797
True. But to us...

692
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:11,884
Oh, yes!

693
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:14,395
Now, how to begin?

694
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:16,165
Which one to use?

695
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:18,756
This one!

696
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:21,196
No, no, sister. This.

697
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:39,681
OK. One last dance.

698
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,197
(Growling)

699
00:48:57,967 --> 00:48:59,559
(Squelch)

700
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,046
(Roars)

701
00:49:07,687 --> 00:49:10,042
(Grunting)

702
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:17,600
Missed all the fun, kid.

703
00:49:17,647 --> 00:49:20,161
Find Abe. I'm going for
the professor and Liz.

704
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,402
Find? Where? How?

705
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:25,007
I don't know, do your thing!

706
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:27,402
Maybe he has a metal filling
or something.

707
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:48,766
Are you all right?

708
00:49:48,807 --> 00:49:50,843
I'm fine.
Just caught on a branch.

709
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,923
Liz, you must leave me.

710
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:55,003
Erzsebet must be stopped.

711
00:49:55,047 --> 00:49:56,878
You have to interrupt the ritual.

712
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:01,363
Go. I'll be fine.

713
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:05,115
(Howling)

714
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:07,646
Maybe not.

715
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:09,678
(Howling)

716
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:14,205
(Growling)

717
00:50:14,247 --> 00:50:15,680
(Barking)

718
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:39,197
We must keep moving.

719
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:41,838
Yeah. Stay close.

720
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:46,359
If I could see them, I could...

721
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:55,080
They're... leaving.

722
00:50:55,127 --> 00:50:58,324
Because they've done what
they were meant to do. Hurry!

723
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:10,959
We're too late.

724
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:14,920
Erzsebet!

725
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,159
Stand back.

726
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,762
So young.

727
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:35,283
She's too much for you.

728
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:36,760
You'll burn.

729
00:51:37,807 --> 00:51:39,240
You!

730
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:41,675
Let go of him!

731
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,645
My goddess Hecate,
aid your servant.

732
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:03,557
Hecate. Seen your statue.

733
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,563
Aren't you missing a couple of heads?

734
00:54:05,607 --> 00:54:07,643
Why do you walk this lesser world?

735
00:54:07,687 --> 00:54:09,678
Mortals, they don't know you.

736
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:12,446
We are greater beings
than they could ever dream.

737
00:54:12,487 --> 00:54:15,285
Yeah? Well, I'm doing just fine.

738
00:54:15,327 --> 00:54:18,399
Now, uh, I'm kinda busy.
I gotta go.

739
00:54:18,447 --> 00:54:19,880
Why? To save them?

740
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:21,121
They're nothing to us.

741
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:23,556
Only a few remain
that observe the old rituals,

742
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:25,359
so I give them back the priestess

743
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:27,398
and they give me sacrifices of blood.

744
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:29,483
Now, accept what you are.

745
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:31,643
Come and walk with me.

746
00:54:31,687 --> 00:54:33,279
Lady, I was gonna
cut you some slack

747
00:54:33,327 --> 00:54:36,797
cos you're a major mythological figure.
But that, that's crazy talk.

748
00:54:36,847 --> 00:54:38,439
Now leave me alone!

749
00:54:40,727 --> 00:54:42,718
There you are.

750
00:54:58,887 --> 00:55:00,684
Gotta go.

751
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,762
(Groaning)

752
00:55:36,807 --> 00:55:39,321
Most intriguing, sister.

753
00:55:39,367 --> 00:55:40,766
Yes, sister.

754
00:55:44,447 --> 00:55:45,482
Let's cut some more.

755
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:48,120
Yah!

756
00:55:58,047 --> 00:55:59,560
(Shrieking)

757
00:56:07,127 --> 00:56:08,276
Harpies.

758
00:56:09,527 --> 00:56:11,404
Should have known.

759
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:24,799
(Shrieking)

760
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:44,679
(Screams)

761
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,643
(Harpies laughing)

762
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,158
(Howling)

763
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:06,359
(Howling)

764
00:57:21,847 --> 00:57:23,519
(Growling)

765
00:57:50,127 --> 00:57:51,719
(Abe) Liz!

766
00:57:53,447 --> 00:57:55,165
Liz!

767
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:56,356
I'm OK.

768
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:58,796
This time, I'm OK.

769
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:35,998
The years have not been
so kind to you.

770
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:37,560
Nor to you.

771
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:44,037
Ha! You're so frail.

772
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,362
Age has turned you to glass.

773
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:48,557
I pity you.

774
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,044
And I you.

775
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:55,726
(Sighs)

776
00:59:11,687 --> 00:59:15,157
Growing old is not the worst thing
that could happen to a person.

777
00:59:15,207 --> 00:59:18,199
But you ceased to be
a person long ago.

778
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:29,358
- Oh...
- (Sizzling)

779
00:59:30,127 --> 00:59:32,038
(Whimpering)

780
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:35,076
No!

781
00:59:36,327 --> 00:59:37,555
What have you done?

782
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:40,360
My contribution to your bath.

783
00:59:40,407 --> 00:59:42,125
No!

784
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:46,479
(Moaning and screaming)

785
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,318
(Gasps)

786
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:04,479
(Roars)

787
01:00:05,767 --> 01:00:07,325
(Screams)

788
01:00:07,367 --> 01:00:10,598
(Gasping and shrieking)

789
01:00:12,687 --> 01:00:14,484
(Flames whooshing)

790
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:22,195
Aagh!

791
01:01:37,687 --> 01:01:39,166
(Sighs)

792
01:01:56,487 --> 01:01:58,159
(Grinding)

793
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:05,764
Choose.

794
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:09,116
Lady, you just don't get it.

795
01:02:15,727 --> 01:02:17,046
Damn.

796
01:02:28,927 --> 01:02:30,485
Can we do this some other time?

797
01:02:30,527 --> 01:02:34,122
You have made war against
members of your own family...

798
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,282
and mine!

799
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:37,522
Ancient spirits of air,

800
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:41,321
old gods of graves and shadows,
demons of hell.

801
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:44,564
You're stained with the blood
of your own kin.

802
01:02:44,607 --> 01:02:45,801
Now come to me.

803
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:47,280
Oh, shut up!

804
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,999
It is inevitable.

805
01:03:14,967 --> 01:03:17,276
(Harpie shrieking)

806
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:26,046
Hecate, Queen of the Crossroads!

807
01:03:27,087 --> 01:03:29,476
Terror of mortal men!

808
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:32,087
Let us worship...

809
01:03:32,127 --> 01:03:33,560
Sister?

810
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:37,845
(Shrieking)

811
01:03:41,127 --> 01:03:42,799
(Groans)

812
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,802
Jeez.

813
01:04:10,887 --> 01:04:12,400
Ow.

814
01:04:19,847 --> 01:04:23,476
Stop this. Come to me now.

815
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:26,475
You do not belong in this world.

816
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:30,120
Looks like your high priestess
didn't do so well.

817
01:04:35,487 --> 01:04:36,715
This fight's over.

818
01:05:01,287 --> 01:05:03,118
Come on! Come on!

819
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:05,681
- Work!
- (Abe) Sid!

820
01:05:05,727 --> 01:05:09,163
Abe! Where were you? I was trying to
find you, but the cameras are all...

821
01:05:09,207 --> 01:05:11,596
- Where's Hellboy?
- Don't know.

822
01:05:11,647 --> 01:05:13,285
- But...
- But what?

823
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,238
- I'm detecting metal.
- (Rumbling)

824
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:16,481
A lot of metal.

825
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:28,245
Professor, look...

826
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:38,605
(Screams)

827
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:00,438
(Liz) Don't know you...

828
01:06:00,487 --> 01:06:01,840
don't like you.

829
01:06:05,927 --> 01:06:07,724
Liz! No!

830
01:06:09,927 --> 01:06:11,645
(Screaming)

831
01:06:13,007 --> 01:06:15,805
Sorry! Sorry.

832
01:06:17,527 --> 01:06:18,596
(Grunts)

833
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,681
Over here, ugly!

834
01:06:32,327 --> 01:06:33,601
Now!

835
01:06:34,567 --> 01:06:36,523
Use it!

836
01:06:46,527 --> 01:06:48,040
(Screaming)

837
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:55,478
- Nice shot, kid.
- Thanks, I...

838
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:56,801
Ah!

839
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:07,038
Was... Was that the goddess?

840
01:07:07,087 --> 01:07:09,157
If Hecate has come,

841
01:07:09,207 --> 01:07:11,516
this could be very bad.

842
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:13,080
We've gotta do something!

843
01:07:13,127 --> 01:07:15,960
We can't.

844
01:07:16,007 --> 01:07:17,725
- Only Hellboy.
- But...

845
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:20,327
- we just can't let him...
- It's almost dawn.

846
01:07:25,767 --> 01:07:27,280
(Groans)

847
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:31,956
Crap.

848
01:07:36,527 --> 01:07:38,040
(Groans)

849
01:07:49,647 --> 01:07:51,285
(Crash)

850
01:07:51,327 --> 01:07:52,362
Great.

851
01:08:03,807 --> 01:08:06,275
Don't you understand?

852
01:08:06,327 --> 01:08:09,125
We are not like others on this earth!

853
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:12,159
We were born to walk
in greater worlds!

854
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:14,402
- This world's fine by me.
- Eurgh.

855
01:08:14,447 --> 01:08:16,438
Too long among humans.

856
01:08:16,487 --> 01:08:18,876
You have nearly lost yourself.

857
01:08:21,367 --> 01:08:23,164
Ah! (Groans)

858
01:08:28,127 --> 01:08:30,004
It's over.

859
01:08:30,047 --> 01:08:31,719
No!

860
01:08:34,727 --> 01:08:37,480
We are gods of darkness!

861
01:08:48,847 --> 01:08:51,202
Here, have some sun!

862
01:08:51,247 --> 01:08:54,603
- Crap.
- Stop this! Your destiny is...

863
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:56,558
Destiny is overrated.

864
01:09:06,927 --> 01:09:08,599
(Groaning)

865
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:50,446
(Moans)

866
01:09:59,847 --> 01:10:02,680
Broom, the car for the airport is here.

867
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:04,160
Almost ready.

868
01:10:04,207 --> 01:10:06,277
You've never faced this sort of evil.

869
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,443
There's no need
for you to go alone.

870
01:10:08,487 --> 01:10:11,160
- If you can wait a week, I could...
- I cannot wait, Malcolm.

871
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,560
Too many lives at stake

872
01:10:12,607 --> 01:10:15,519
and I am grateful they accepted
the offer of my expertise.

873
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:18,320
The Transylvanian constabulary
is very experienced

874
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,564
and I should expect strong support
from the local church.

875
01:10:21,607 --> 01:10:23,006
I'll be fine.

876
01:10:23,727 --> 01:10:25,922
What... What is this?

877
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,601
Hmm?

878
01:10:28,647 --> 01:10:29,875
It's old Lemurian.

879
01:10:29,927 --> 01:10:34,045
It reads,
"Behold the right hand of doom."

880
01:10:34,087 --> 01:10:37,716
"And I looked down into
the end of the world and saw the beast,

881
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:41,157
"and in his right hand
was the key to the bottomless pit."

882
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:44,839
There are those who think that power

883
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:47,355
can be summoned
and bent to their own ends.

884
01:10:47,407 --> 01:10:48,522
Well, they're fools!

885
01:10:48,567 --> 01:10:50,603
It's the apocalyptic thing.

886
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:53,525
It brings the fire
that will incinerate the world!

887
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:55,398
Perhaps.

888
01:10:55,447 --> 01:10:58,996
But if evil finds purchase
in such creatures as Erzsebet,

889
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:03,484
then we must have faith that good
will choose an agent of its own.

890
01:11:03,527 --> 01:11:06,325
Until then, we fight in his stead

891
01:11:06,367 --> 01:11:08,722
for "that which causes us trials

892
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:11,327
"shall lead us to triumph.

893
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:15,599
"We must pass through
darkness to reach the light."

894
01:11:18,327 --> 01:11:19,726
Professor?
