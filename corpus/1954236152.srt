1
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,498
Stand in line. Faster.

2
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:14,018
Turn left.

3
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:20,377
Hunting Elephants

4
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:22,624
Turn right.

5
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:27,333
Don't touch each other.

6
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:28,898
He doesn't understand Hebrew,

7
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:31,141
he's English and he's senile.

8
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:32,254
Senile?
- Senile.

9
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,694
Senile? Yes, I'm senile.

10
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:40,580
Oh, old age, the evil monster
that diluted my mind,

11
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:41,854
where is my youth?

12
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:44,096
Where is my youth?

13
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,855
He's an actor.
An actor, my ass.

14
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:49,502
Give it up for the actor!

15
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:52,543
I'm warning you, Nick.

16
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:55,543
Shut up,
you're ruining my lineup.

17
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:58,216
The police screwed up
from the very first lineup.

18
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,454
It was embarrassing.

19
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,104
They were so old

20
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:03,739
that they had to let them all go

21
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:07,096
because they had
urgent doctor's appointments.

22
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:10,619
Inspector Danino,
I recognize two of them

23
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:14,461
and there was another one,
a 12-year-old, Jonathan.

24
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:30,015
Let me go, Eli!

25
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:31,941
Stop!

26
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:35,301
Shut up.

27
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:44,943
Oneg wants 83,

28
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:46,903
Yuval wants 90, and I...

29
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:48,894
I want 100.

30
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:51,980
You were diagnosed with
ADD and dyslexia.

31
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,618
The teacher won't believe
you got 100.

32
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:57,461
No, no, no...

33
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:58,654
Not my MP3 player!

34
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:01,660
I have dyslexia
but at least I don't stutter.

35
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,504
Fill out the test.

36
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:08,663
Hello, this is Banila
the English teacher's son,

37
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:12,384
can you call my mother?

38
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:13,535
It's urgent.

39
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:14,740
Can you get her, please?

40
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:16,015
It's urgent.

41
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:34,222
Yuval, 40.

42
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:35,236
40?

43
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:38,098
Oneg, 36.

44
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:40,857
Eli, 18.

45
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:42,420
18?

46
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:44,697
You misspelled your own name.

47
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,781
I deliberately made mistakes,
to screw them.

48
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:50,776
In my 40 years
in the school system

49
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:53,260
you're definitely
the smartest student I've met.

50
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:56,014
But socially
you're completely handicapped.

51
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:59,461
There's a name for this.
"Stupid genius."

52
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,616
People don't like people
who are too smart.

53
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:03,941
You're suspended for 3 days.
Out!

54
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:41,903
He was kicked out of school.
- What?

55
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:44,261
He copied in English class.
- But you know English.

56
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,103
Leave me alone.

57
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:49,300
Daniel, slap him.
- Why me? You slap him.

58
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:50,699
Slapping is a man's job.

59
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,744
I'll hug him afterwards.

60
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:53,781
Women do everything now,

61
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:55,623
you slap him and I'll hug him.

62
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:59,380
You can slap Dad
and I'll hug myself.

63
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,140
Dorit...

64
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:04,854
Dorit, he isn't...

65
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:07,735
Bye, guys.

66
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:09,261
Great.

67
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:10,460
Nice work today.

68
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:14,775
Daniel,

69
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,179
that monster better be done
by tomorrow morning.

70
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:19,658
Give me a few days, Dedi.

71
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,299
Daniel, don't be greedy,

72
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:23,854
if it isn't working by tomorrow,
you're fired.

73
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:27,495
Bye, buddy.

74
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:29,982
Why does that moron
talk to you like that?

75
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:32,175
Jonathan, be quiet!
What's wrong with you?

76
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:34,940
Night.

77
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:36,700
It's dark.

78
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,977
The bank seems deserted.

79
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:43,936
The robber's sure that nothing
stands between him and the safe.

80
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:49,177
After robbing banks
all over the world

81
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:51,614
he can already smell the money.

82
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:54,537
But then, whoops...

83
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:57,261
Surprise.

84
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:03,860
Dad, that's amazing.
- Isn't it?

85
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:08,184
There's also a secret code,

86
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:11,022
it's your birth date.

87
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:15,094
You know what I think?

88
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,780
I think you should go to Eli

89
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,101
and make up with him.

90
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:22,022
Dad, I'm not talking
to that Neanderthal.

91
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,614
He broke my MP3 player.

92
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,741
I see it still records.

93
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:29,863
It doesn't work,
it just lights up.

94
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:31,378
You know he flunked twice?

95
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:32,858
Son, you have to get along

96
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:35,055
with people less smarter than you.

97
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:37,256
You have enough problems
as it is.

98
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:38,778
I don't...

99
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:40,577
I don't stutter like I used to.

100
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:43,141
I'm fine.

101
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:44,539
You're just trying
to change the subject.

102
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:47,220
You can't afford to send me
to a school for the gifted.

103
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:50,341
It's very expensive.

104
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,297
It's not my fault
you're a security guard.

105
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,621
I'm Head of Security.

106
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:59,896
If you cleaned toilets
you'd say you're Chief of Hygiene.

107
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:01,777
Are you ashamed of my job?

108
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:04,504
I put the food on the table.

109
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,138
Checkmate. I win.

110
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:09,183
You got lucky.
- It isn't a game of luck,

111
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:10,420
I'm still smarter than you.

112
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:11,654
If you're so smart,

113
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:15,654
why are you a loser
who kisses ass for a living?

114
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,423
Don't talk to me that way!

115
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:18,500
I won't have it.

116
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:19,820
You won't see the computer

117
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:22,539
for 6 months, you hear?

118
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,576
Dad, are you okay?
- Yes, yes.

119
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,824
I'm okay, buddy, don't worry...

120
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:46,740
I'm fine.

121
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,218
I just need some air.
I'm okay.

122
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:58,382
I'm the best dad in the world.
The best.

123
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:06,698
Take the car keys,

124
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:09,181
get me the blue pills
from the glove compartment,

125
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:10,858
okay?
- Dad.

126
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,617
Even if I'm with my eyes closed

127
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:14,542
put a pill under my tongue.

128
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:15,436
But...

129
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:16,898
Don't be scared, it's okay,

130
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:18,458
go get the pills, okay?

131
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:19,741
Go.

132
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,498
Hurry!

133
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:25,138
Don't close your eyes! - Get the pills!
- Dad, don't close your eyes!

134
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,935
No, no, no.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

135
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,257
No, no, no, no...

136
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:35,575
No!

137
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,660
Somebody help me!

138
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:42,580
Help me!

139
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:47,544
Somebody, please!

140
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,544
Somebody, please!

141
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:03,935
Got it.

142
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:11,215
Dad.

143
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:21,303
Dad, Dad, Dad...

144
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,863
Dad, open your eyes!

145
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,258
Open your eyes, Dad!

146
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,024
Dad, open your eyes!

147
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:30,454
Dad, please, come closer!

148
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:33,145
Dad, please come closer!

149
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:35,301
Dad, open your eyes!

150
00:09:58,585 --> 00:09:59,904
Hey, Dorit.

151
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:02,420
Dedi can't see you now.

152
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:07,255
He's in a meeting
with a very important client.

153
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,856
He said he can't stop thinking
about what happened.

154
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:16,340
We,

155
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:20,138
all of Daniel's friends,
may he rest in peace,

156
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:23,661
collected some money for you
for the holiday.

157
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:24,722
Here.

158
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:44,384
How am I supposed to feed him?
- Dorit.

159
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:45,221
How?

160
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,983
You know what my salary is,

161
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,575
you won't pay me
a pension or insurance,

162
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:50,854
they kicked me out
of the apartment

163
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:51,895
and you...

164
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:54,424
Dorit...
- You're giving me charity?

165
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:55,461
Charity?

166
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:56,540
Huh?

167
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:57,700
2,000 shekels?

168
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:00,260
He died in your bank,
at his job,

169
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:01,534
doesn't that count for anything?

170
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:05,297
Dorit, the insurance company
won't pay because he wasn't alone.

171
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:10,022
His son was with him.
They were playing with the cage.

172
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:12,818
You have to read the fine print.

173
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:15,943
The whole document
is fine print!

174
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,221
Dorit...

175
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:20,384
Classic Dorit behavior.
Classic.

176
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:23,060
She comes, screams,
throws things, and leaves.

177
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:26,939
But she touched me.
Women don't understand,

178
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,141
we don't want someone
to suck up to us.

179
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:31,495
We want a fight,
in life, in bed.

180
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:33,613
She's not my type.

181
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:35,459
I like the sluts

182
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:38,820
with the high heels,
makeup, no hair on their...

183
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,704
silicon, Botox,
the whole nine yards.

184
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:42,980
Excuse me, Dorit,

185
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:46,058
do you have a first degree relative?
- Are you a social worker?

186
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,095
Give us our money.

187
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,260
If you have relatives

188
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:50,535
who'll put up collateral,
even a small amount,

189
00:11:50,665 --> 00:11:52,656
I can increase the amount
and give you a loan.

190
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,100
My parents are dead.
- What about Daniel's?

191
00:11:55,225 --> 00:11:56,419
Daniel didn't speak
to his parents.

192
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,104
Last I heard,
his mother was very sick

193
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:00,136
and the grandfather wishes
we were dead.

194
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:02,538
Leave me alone, okay?

195
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:05,899
Is that true?

196
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,454
What you said about
Grandma and Grandpa?

197
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:11,060
Why did you tell me
his parents are dead?

198
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:57,938
Don't believe a word he says.

199
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,457
You have a lot of nerve
coming here,

200
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,104
a lot of nerve.

201
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:09,900
I know.

202
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:14,493
But... - My son dies and I have to
read about it in the obituaries?

203
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:18,583
Why didn't you call?

204
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:22,024
I was scared.

205
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:26,259
What do you want from me?

206
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:29,423
That's your grandson,

207
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:32,303
Jonathan.

208
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:34,657
Don't you want to say hello?

209
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:42,184
I wanted to come to his bris.
- That was Daniel,

210
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,097
you can't blame me.

211
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:45,863
I didn't hear
that you fought for it.

212
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:47,214
Did you argue with him?

213
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:50,059
The wife decides
who to fight with.

214
00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:53,183
You should've brought it up
with Daniel. - Too late now.

215
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:56,622
What do you want, money?
Don't have any.

216
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:59,299
Even if I did,
I wouldn't give you a penny.

217
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:01,302
I want him to stay here
for a few hours a day.

218
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:04,018
I work until midnight.

219
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,340
He's a big boy.
Look at him.

220
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,742
Daniel stayed alone at his age.

221
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:10,982
At his age I was a member of
the underground.

222
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:14,057
Times have change.
- They sure have.

223
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,255
Let him stay with friends.
- He doesn't have any!

224
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:23,176
I don't have anyone
and I need help.

225
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:24,937
You should've spoken to Rhoda.

226
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,584
Too late for that, too.

227
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,457
Forget it. I'm no babysitter.

228
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:30,977
Nick. Nick!

229
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:33,539
What letters do you see
on the wall?

230
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:35,734
There's a wall?!

231
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:38,221
I'm calling your son.

232
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:41,582
We have to discuss
the possibility of surgery.

233
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:43,104
What do you think I am,

234
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:46,103
a 6-year-old?

235
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,824
Forget my son.

236
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,099
It's an expensive operation,

237
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:54,179
let him keep his money
for more important things.

238
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:57,576
Nick, come here,
it's an emergency.

239
00:14:57,705 --> 00:14:59,696
Eliyahu, how are you?

240
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:02,934
Come on!

241
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:04,254
You won't believe
what happened.

242
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:07,820
The crazy woman was here.
- What crazy woman?

243
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:11,013
Daniel's wife. What nerve.

244
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:12,021
She brought her kid,

245
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,295
she wants me to watch him.

246
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:16,985
You're kidding. What did you say?
- What did I say?

247
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:20,345
"You didn't keep in touch,
you didn't visit Rhoda,

248
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:23,823
"the little shit didn't even
call on the holidays.

249
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:25,503
"Rhoda got sick
because of him.

250
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,378
"Take your little retard
and fuck off."

251
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:30,780
Very good.

252
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,578
And what did she say?

253
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:35,016
She left the kid and took off.

254
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:36,055
It's not true,

255
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:38,895
I didn't meet my husband
at the nut house.

256
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,945
Contrary to what
his father Eliyahu said

257
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:47,014
we met at the university
and only then was I hospitalized.

258
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,023
Eliyahu, is that your grandson?

259
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:52,175
How handsome,

260
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:54,984
just like his grandfather.

261
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:56,857
Shut your filthy mouth, Hedva.

262
00:15:56,985 --> 00:15:59,704
Did you see the new dress
my daughter bought me?

263
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:03,261
I can't open the zipper.
Can you help me?

264
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:04,898
You and your pistol?

265
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:07,414
I'd rather be raped by baboons.

266
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:09,854
Hilarious!

267
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:14,897
Did you see my mother?
I need my mother.

268
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:19,056
Help me get out.
I want to get out.

269
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:20,459
Lanzman, this is the code.

270
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:23,100
If you can punch it in,
you're out.

271
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,017
That's the test.

272
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:28,260
I just hope
I don't end up like him...

273
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:30,979
Where are we going?
- To the coma ward.

274
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:32,174
What for?

275
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:34,540
We're going to leave you there.

276
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,656
We're going to visit
your grandma.

277
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,944
Which is my grandma?
- Forget your grandma,

278
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:46,738
take a look at that.

279
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:48,379
She's a nymphomaniac.

280
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:51,255
She hasn't had any
since last night

281
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:53,416
and she needs more and more.

282
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:57,254
She needs someone to rock her world
with a 13-incher.

283
00:16:57,425 --> 00:17:00,497
Now she's here, all alone...

284
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,534
That's great. Keep going.

285
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:09,655
Soon she'll take off her top
nice and slow

286
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:13,779
and sit on his crank

287
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:17,824
and move from side to side,

288
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,334
from side to side,

289
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:22,103
and he'll feel every movement.

290
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:23,695
What's she doing?

291
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:25,975
What the hell is she doing?

292
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:30,380
I don't feel well...

293
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:32,703
This isn't good...

294
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:34,019
My blood sugar dropped.

295
00:17:34,465 --> 00:17:36,899
She's something.

296
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,774
Really something.

297
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,454
It's a miracle, a miracle,

298
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:44,895
he brought good luck.

299
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:49,422
Come to Daddy.
Take off your clothes, yes. - Yes.

300
00:17:58,105 --> 00:18:00,619
I'll be the first one
who Sigi bathes.

301
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,896
You wish.
I'll be there way before you.

302
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,937
It won't be you, Ezra,
or you, Nick. It'll be me.

303
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,057
I belong here,

304
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:10,739
next to Rhoda.

305
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,583
She's coming out,

306
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:13,820
let's go.

307
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,064
Don't let her see us.

308
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:17,584
Have you seen my mother?

309
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:34,459
To be or not to be,

310
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:37,223
that is the question.

311
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:42,861
Hamlet, you cannot escape
your destiny.

312
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,182
Uncle Claudius... Murder!

313
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:46,660
You killed my father!

314
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:49,738
And now you have the audacity
to violate my mother?

315
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,901
Come and meet thy death!

316
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:55,137
I am your father, Hamlet.

317
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:56,584
No!

318
00:18:57,145 --> 00:18:59,659
Fight! Fight!

319
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:10,414
My hand! My hand!
My hand!

320
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:13,659
Ophelia, I feel something.

321
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,340
It's a strange sensation
in my belly.

322
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:19,145
Oh, it's growing. Oh...

323
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,344
Tough house.
Mind you,

324
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:25,138
half that lot out there
haven't paid for their bloody tickets.

325
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:26,941
Go on.

326
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:32,775
Ophelia! I'm flying!
I'm flying!

327
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:37,780
Hello.

328
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:41,342
Hi. This is Dorit Arbel
from Israel.

329
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:44,821
Yes?
- Is this Lord Michael Simpson?

330
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:46,856
This isn't a very good time.

331
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:51,024
I'm afraid I've just opened the world
premiere of my new production,

332
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:53,063
"Hamlet, Revenge of the Sith,"

333
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:54,937
so thank very much.
Thank you, goodbye.

334
00:19:55,065 --> 00:19:55,895
Daniel is dead.

335
00:19:56,785 --> 00:20:01,654
Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you for
the courtesy of letting me know.

336
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:06,455
Excuse me, who is this Daniel? I mean,
what relation does he have to me?

337
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,978
Well, he's your nephew.

338
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:09,613
The son of Rhoda.

339
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:11,854
Oh, dear.

340
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:14,535
Lord Simpson,
we know you're in there.

341
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:18,141
If you don't open the door, Dennis here
is gonna have to break your knees.

342
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,742
You don't have the rights
for the play.

343
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:24,095
What are you thinking of doing,
jumping out of the window?

344
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,984
We're gonna shove one of these
light-swords up your ass!

345
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:30,061
You're gonna pay me
every penny!

346
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:35,020
I have to leave now. Will you give
my condolences to my sister?

347
00:20:35,145 --> 00:20:37,613
She doesn't know.
She's in a coma.

348
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:39,463
Rhoda? In a coma?

349
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,938
Well, I thought you knew that.

350
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:43,260
Now that Daniel is dead
we don't have a lot of money.

351
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,780
We need a short-term loan for...
- What about Rhoda's money?

352
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:47,538
The big place in Jerusalem?

353
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,223
Eliyahu will not give us money.

354
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:50,904
You're damned right he won't.

355
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:53,141
Now, that is my family's property

356
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:55,614
and my father, I can assure you,

357
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:58,862
had no intention of it falling into
the hands of a Jewish terrorist!

358
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:00,100
Well, he's not a terrorist.

359
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,861
One may stop being a terrorist.
One can scarcely cease being a Jew.

360
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:07,418
We just need a little loan.
It's a small thing.

361
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,062
You're one of the richest families
in England.

362
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,653
Oh, yes, somewhere between
the Queen and Victoria Beckham.

363
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:17,939
The Simpson family made
their considerable fortune out of tea.

364
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:20,738
The father of Rhoda and Michael
served in India

365
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:23,254
and then in the Mandatory Police
in Palestine.

366
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:26,384
He was a hunter and a boxer.

367
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:29,698
Now, the father was bitterly
disappointed with his children,

368
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:33,540
so when Michael became
a theatre actor

369
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:36,339
his father decided,
in retaliation,

370
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:40,095
to donate the entire
family fortune to science,

371
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,978
leaving Michael with
practically nothing.

372
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,539
How's it going, buddy?

373
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:57,744
I'm fine.

374
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,944
What are you doing here?

375
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:02,459
My mom isn't home.

376
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:06,982
Hello, Dedi.
- Hello, Dorit.

377
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:08,334
You little scamp...

378
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:09,981
I like that.

379
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:14,101
Dorit,

380
00:22:15,305 --> 00:22:18,024
I might have a lead for you,

381
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,180
I've been thinking
about you all day,

382
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:23,139
and I might have
a solution for your problem.

383
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,302
I found a monetary fund

384
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:27,933
that can give you
a short-term loan.

385
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:29,575
Here, take it.

386
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:31,582
We don't need handouts.
- Stop it, Jonathan.

387
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:33,021
Thank you.

388
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,864
I can get you this amount
every month.

389
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:37,458
It's not much,
I really liked Daniel.

390
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:41,294
No one at the bank knows about this.
I'm bending the rules.

391
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:42,653
I bought you a computer game,

392
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:46,585
"Car Thief,"
but school comes first, right?

393
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:47,421
Do you need a ride?

394
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:50,059
I can take you to work,
and you to school. - No need. - Sure.

395
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:51,775
Yes.

396
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:30,853
You can exchange the game
if you like.

397
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:34,819
It says so in the fine print.
Here, see?

398
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:37,015
You have up to a month.

399
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:41,294
God is in the fine print, Jonathan.

400
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,614
Come on, Jonathan.

401
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:30,056
Hey, kid...

402
00:24:31,825 --> 00:24:33,702
Hey, moron.

403
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:36,219
Are you playing?

404
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,098
I'm getting some tea,
then I'll be back to slaughter you.

405
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:49,058
Let him win.

406
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,021
Why? I'll finish him off
in five moves.

407
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:55,899
Let him win, listen to me,
I know him.

408
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:56,975
What were you talking about?

409
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:59,415
I asked if he has a girlfriend.

410
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:04,616
Well, sonny-boy? Has anyone
let you touch her cherries yet?

411
00:25:05,865 --> 00:25:09,062
I met your grandmother
at the Bank of Palestine

412
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:10,864
in Jerusalem.

413
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,581
She had a summer job there

414
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:17,255
and I came in holding a gun.

415
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:22,419
There she was, the prettiest girl
in the world, 17 years old.

416
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:26,419
The daughter
of the British Chief of Police.

417
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:29,421
I looked into her eyes and said:

418
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:33,584
A girl like you needs a man that will
look at her beauty all her life.

419
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,293
This is my address.

420
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:38,134
Come to me
if you are looking for true love.

421
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:39,664
You walked in holding a gun?

422
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:40,900
I had a machine gun.

423
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:42,378
Were you bank robbers?

424
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:44,824
You and Nick?

425
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,741
We did it for the Jewish people.

426
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,501
We did it for the girls.

427
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:54,817
Where did you get guns?
- It's still confidential.

428
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:55,974
Tell me, sonny,

429
00:25:56,505 --> 00:26:00,339
who's that girl you like?
- She's in my class.

430
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:02,901
Is she pretty?
- I don't know,

431
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:04,942
I don't have the authority
to determine that.

432
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,744
Listen, kid,
all that counts is getting laid.

433
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:09,937
If a girl says yes, go for it,

434
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:11,618
don't make my mistake,

435
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:14,902
a neighbor once babysat me
and I said no.

436
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:17,017
I waited ten years after that

437
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:20,018
and I ended up
going to a whore downtown.

438
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,134
Shut up, Nick.

439
00:26:21,265 --> 00:26:25,144
Life begins the first time
a girl gives it to you

440
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:27,899
and it ends the last time
you get it.

441
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:30,334
Go to that girl tomorrow
and tell her:

442
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,423
Let's not waste time,
life is short.

443
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:36,105
I may love you now,
but it might not last.

444
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,937
Here's my number,

445
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:40,738
call me if you're looking
for true love.

446
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:43,256
Grandpa, I can't tell her that,

447
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:44,500
the whole class
will laugh at me.

448
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:48,413
Your generation sees
so much sex and ass,

449
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:50,223
but you have no concept
of simple love.

450
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,093
Say goodbye to your queen, kid.

451
00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:58,903
Your end is near.

452
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,982
You're not bad for a kid.

453
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:03,056
You definitely inherited my skill.

454
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:04,116
Checkmate.

455
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:06,463
You can't go here
because of the rook

456
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,820
and you can't go here...
- I know what checkmate is.

457
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:11,174
It's one of Kasparov's tricks,

458
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:14,703
you have to know
when to sacrifice your queen.

459
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,256
When I got up for tea
did he move the pieces?

460
00:27:18,065 --> 00:27:19,544
I didn't cheat, I never do.

461
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:21,815
You're stupid.
I'd cheat if I could.

462
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:22,815
No, you wouldn't.

463
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:23,661
Yes, he would.

464
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:25,264
Everyone cheats
when it's convenient.

465
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:27,297
What did your stupid father teach you?

466
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:28,778
My father was smarter than you.

467
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:30,575
You didn't know him.

468
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:33,458
Listen, halfwit, he was my son
before he was your father.

469
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,859
He was an honest man,

470
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:37,545
which you'll never be.

471
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,304
Why do you come here?

472
00:27:40,665 --> 00:27:43,225
Why don't you have
any friends?

473
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:45,535
Eliyahu, for God's sake,
leave the kid alone.

474
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:47,543
I understand
why Dad never spoke to you.

475
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:50,101
You're a liar, a cheat
and a psychopath.

476
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:51,857
You don't know
nothing about nothing.

477
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,063
It's my dad's chessboard!

478
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:56,062
I bought it for him, idiot.

479
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,699
How can you possibly
treat people like this?

480
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:01,020
One flies 3,000 miles

481
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,897
to find one's beloved sister

482
00:28:03,025 --> 00:28:05,016
in the worst corner
of this dump.

483
00:28:05,705 --> 00:28:07,696
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Simpson...

484
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:08,894
Lord Simpson!

485
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:11,456
One's great-great-great-grandfather

486
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:15,339
did not kill the Teutonic king
with his bare hands 800 years ago,

487
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:18,059
for his descendants
to become plain "Mr." again.

488
00:28:18,185 --> 00:28:21,302
What rock did that snake
crawl out from under?

489
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:22,904
I'm sorry, Lord Simpson.

490
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:25,381
Rhoda is getting
the best treatment,

491
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:26,494
I promise you.

492
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,343
Elijah! There you are.

493
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,503
The name is Eliyahu.
- Yes, Elilulu.

494
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:35,453
I didn't expect you to notice,
but we English are not accustomed

495
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:38,094
to sweating here
like you natives.

496
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:40,500
I am transferring my sister
to better care.

497
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:44,176
George, put the bed back in place.
- Don't.

498
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:46,933
George, you better put it back

499
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:49,420
before I spit you and the Englishman
on an IV pole!

500
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:50,301
Eliyahu...

501
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:51,858
Who do you think you are?

502
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:53,777
I am Rhoda's brother

503
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:56,175
and I have the means
to give her better treatment.

504
00:28:57,985 --> 00:28:59,464
Oh, and another thing,

505
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:04,216
I hope you are taking better care of the
Simpson residence we let you live in.

506
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:05,215
When can I see it?

507
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:09,181
I'll smash his teeth in...
- Eliyahu. - Stop it! - Eliyahu.

508
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:10,454
Eliyahu, calm down!

509
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:12,815
I don't have third-party insurance.

510
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:16,415
Her whole family, those bastards,
they broke her heart! - Stop it!

511
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:19,059
They broke her heart!
- Calm down.

512
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:22,382
Eliyahu, not here. We'll make him
eat lead in the parking lot later.

513
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:25,503
We are the best place
in Jerusalem, Lord.

514
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:29,784
And to imagine that I was considering
living in this dreadful place,

515
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:31,583
in an apartment
next to my sister.

516
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:33,258
You will love it.

517
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:34,500
And you will change your mind.

518
00:29:34,665 --> 00:29:38,544
And I will give you
the best room for a few weeks

519
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:40,462
for a try. What do you say?

520
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:42,344
Well, if you repaint the room,

521
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,735
rebuild the floors
and change your hairdo,

522
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:46,093
it might be tolerable...

523
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:47,941
Okay.

524
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:53,941
"Noa, let's not waste time,
life is short."

525
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:16,735
Noa.

526
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:19,575
Oh my god...
What a nerd...

527
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:20,615
Noa...

528
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:24,302
Let's not waste t-time,
life is sh-short.

529
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:27,059
What do you mean?

530
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:30,581
Someone you l-love
could die any m-minute.

531
00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:32,660
Like who?

532
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:35,694
I don't know,

533
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:38,540
but a p-pretty girl like you

534
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:42,903
needs someone to l-love her and
hold her for the rest of her l-life.

535
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:45,024
Well, call me.

536
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:46,334
Wait, where are you going?

537
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:49,175
Are you making fun of me?
- No.

538
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:53,902
I'm really sorry about
what happened to your dad.

539
00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:56,823
That's not why I...

540
00:30:57,865 --> 00:30:58,934
What's up, Calculator?

541
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,021
What's that?

542
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:02,614
A boner?

543
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:05,223
Noa gave you a boner?

544
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:06,619
You're an idiot, Eli.

545
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:10,456
Now you're gonna tell on me?

546
00:31:11,025 --> 00:31:12,697
Run to Daddy and tell on me?

547
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:17,343
Oh, shit...

548
00:31:17,465 --> 00:31:19,854
I forgot,
you don't have a dad.

549
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:31,383
This is a Do Not Resuscitate form,
a DNR.

550
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:34,333
Should Rhoda enter a condition

551
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:38,054
of respiratory distress
or heart failure,

552
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:42,224
we want your consent
not to resuscitate her.

553
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:46,178
You want my consent
to kill my wife?

554
00:31:46,345 --> 00:31:49,974
True, her muscles respond,
but she had a stroke.

555
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:54,418
This form will help
free her from suffering.

556
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:57,185
I know how much you love her.

557
00:31:57,305 --> 00:32:00,342
You don't know anything
about love, Mrs. Director.

558
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:04,498
I promised her that when
she was old and helpless

559
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,581
I'd buy poison and kill her...

560
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,336
and she promised me the same.

561
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:13,537
And I didn't sign a form.

562
00:32:14,585 --> 00:32:16,815
I promised that
to the woman I love.

563
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:19,334
That's illegal, Eliyahu.

564
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:20,978
To hell with the law.

565
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,017
This country can't afford
eye surgery for an old man,

566
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:25,373
it's too expensive.

567
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:28,053
A guy takes a bullet
for his country

568
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:30,619
and you piss on him.
He was shot right beside me.

569
00:32:30,745 --> 00:32:34,055
Eliyahu, I don't quite
understand what you mean,

570
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:35,661
but look,

571
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,503
take this form, read it...

572
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,861
The only person with permission
to kill my wife is me.

573
00:32:44,265 --> 00:32:46,699
The man who's loved her
for 60 years.

574
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:45,059
When you're pale with grief

575
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:50,100
Hiding in your silence

576
00:33:51,145 --> 00:33:55,184
Let me talk to you

577
00:33:56,265 --> 00:34:00,383
And walk between your shadows

578
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:04,138
And be with you

579
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:10,497
I won't ask you why

580
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:15,378
I won't trouble your loneliness

581
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:20,378
Cautiously, as if hesitating

582
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:25,424
With hints of fondness and kindness

583
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,938
I will talk to you

584
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,024
I am strong

585
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,497
I am strong

586
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:40,656
Don't go easy on me

587
00:34:41,985 --> 00:34:46,820
Don't stop your thorns

588
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:50,620
From scratching my legs

589
00:34:54,265 --> 00:34:58,622
When you're weary unto death

590
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:03,060
And can't sleep in the darkness

591
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:08,464
When your nightmares

592
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:13,418
Haunt your dreams

593
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,784
I will stay with you...

594
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:19,701
Hi, Jonathan.

595
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:24,300
Wow, marvelous makeup.

596
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:28,054
You know, that reminds me of when I was
in a production of "The Three Sisters."

597
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:31,183
It's all about this servant
in Old Russia.

598
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:33,057
I thought
it was about three sisters.

599
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:34,944
Yes, well, they were there too.

600
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:39,502
But when I played Vasily
I made it the leading role.

601
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:42,975
On the opening night
I surprised the director

602
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:46,496
by wearing my own
red dressing gown and a black eye.

603
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:50,660
Well... this is not makeup.

604
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:52,343
Somebody really hit me.

605
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:54,581
Was it a terrorist attack?

606
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:55,695
Are you all right?

607
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:58,425
I'm okay, Uncle Michael.
- Oh.

608
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,893
Uncle. That's so strange.

609
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:06,778
No one has every called me
"uncle" before.

610
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:09,863
Don't you have other family?

611
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:12,302
The stage is my family.

612
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:17,140
Come to think of it,
you're the heir to the throne.

613
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:19,934
You're going to be
the next Lord!

614
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:22,416
I prefer Prince or Duke.

615
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,214
Well, maybe on the
other side of your family.

616
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:29,774
No... My mother,
she doesn't have much money.

617
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:32,539
Well, that's not a problem,
I can give you money.

618
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:36,015
Right now
I have certain liquidity issues,

619
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:39,057
but in a month's time
I can help you.

620
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:49,733
I know what you need.
Come on.

621
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:54,139
A wonderful day
to all our residents.

622
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:58,737
Our afternoon lecture:
Sexual Diseases and the Elderly.

623
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:00,264
It's important that you attend.

624
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:02,823
Cola? Did you buy him cola?

625
00:37:03,025 --> 00:37:05,459
Are you nuts?
Do you know what they put in it?

626
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:08,299
No, I don't.
The formula is a secret,

627
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:11,781
in fact it's probably the best-kept
secret in the 20th century.

628
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:14,254
If I knew that
I'd be a billionaire.

629
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:16,184
He was depressed.

630
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:19,741
Depressed? When you have a problem,
come to your grandpa,

631
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:20,940
not to strangers.

632
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:22,657
What happened to you?

633
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:23,661
I never snitch.

634
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:24,854
Telling your teacher is snitching,

635
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:27,624
telling your grandpa
is a way to get even.

636
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:29,863
Who was it?

637
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:31,944
What on earth are you doing?

638
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:33,698
Are you punishing him
for the Coke?

639
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:34,621
Shut up!

640
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:38,216
He was humiliated in class, and you
think a soft drink will cover for this?

641
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:40,544
Come on.

642
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:49,499
What do you think you're doing?

643
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:53,504
If you don't mind, I'm coming to make
sure that the boy's not mistreated.

644
00:37:58,425 --> 00:38:00,575
Keep an eye on him.
If he does anything, neutralize him.

645
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:17,300
Mei!

646
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,934
Soon Mei, coffee!

647
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:23,865
Come on, Soon Mei,
my father will fire you!

648
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:33,542
Eli, listen good.

649
00:38:33,905 --> 00:38:36,817
Hello. I think it is
important to explain

650
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:39,778
that I had no idea
this was going to happen.

651
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:44,057
If you mess with Jonathan,
Calculator, again,

652
00:38:44,745 --> 00:38:45,860
my grandson...

653
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:48,977
In fact, I am being held here
against my will.

654
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:50,220
I'll come back here

655
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:52,654
and pop a cap down your throat
and kill you.

656
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:54,214
I'll repeat myself

657
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:55,983
because I understand
you're ADD.

658
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:57,140
What's ADD?

659
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:59,737
A problem concentrating.

660
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:01,537
Oh, you mean retarded.

661
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:02,814
We called that "retarded."

662
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:04,298
Why make up new words?

663
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,097
Is this the time for that, Nick?

664
00:39:06,225 --> 00:39:09,217
From now on
you take care of Jonathan,

665
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:12,064
otherwise I'll come and get you.

666
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,578
Thank you for your hospitality,

667
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:25,175
and what a clean place you have here,
you're doing an excellent job.

668
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:32,214
Finally someone puts a halter
on that rotten kid...

669
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:34,220
Grandpa...

670
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:35,734
That was great,

671
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:37,497
that was amazing.

672
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:39,377
Am I the only person here

673
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:42,417
who thinks that Elijah-wu-wu
should seek psychiatric help?

674
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:45,457
Calm down.
It's not a working gun.

675
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:47,503
If any other kids bother you,

676
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,774
tell me where they live.

677
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,215
Hey!
- Hey, hey, stop, stop!

678
00:39:52,345 --> 00:39:53,539
Make my day!

679
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,897
Shit!
- What are you doing, stupid?!

680
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:57,741
Give me the gun!

681
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:59,059
What's going on, Eliyahu?

682
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:00,015
I fixed it,

683
00:40:00,185 --> 00:40:02,494
people only listen
if you have a working gun.

684
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:05,459
Look, I know this is
an ordinary day for you Israelis,

685
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:07,382
but for me personally,
I think we should run.

686
00:40:08,345 --> 00:40:10,734
I can't hear a thing!
I'm deaf in this ear!

687
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:12,261
Moron.

688
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,337
Sorry I'm late, Mom,

689
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,257
we had... it was great.

690
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:24,296
Sit down, I'll make dinner.

691
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:26,103
It's okay, baby, I made dinner.

692
00:40:27,465 --> 00:40:29,660
I know it's not real food, but...

693
00:40:29,785 --> 00:40:32,663
No, no, cake is perfect.

694
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:35,894
People don't know it
but it has all the major food groups.

695
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:38,175
Baby, I'm going out
for half an hour max.

696
00:40:38,665 --> 00:40:43,261
Where are you going?
- To meet Dedi, Dad's bank manager.

697
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,422
We need another loan urgently.

698
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:48,054
At night?
- Baby, don't make me feel bad,

699
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:49,174
I've been working all day.

700
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:51,933
I'll be back in half an hour.

701
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:54,141
He's just a nice man
who's helping us.

702
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,983
Want me to cancel? I'll cancel,

703
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:57,015
and we'll be evicted.

704
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:58,544
No, no, I just...

705
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,223
I'll be back as soon as I can.

706
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:37,422
I'll make you cocoa
like I used to make for Dad before bed.

707
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:39,894
Make me some too,
but with no milk.

708
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:41,653
Because of the cholesterol.

709
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:42,974
And no sugar.

710
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:44,860
I'm diabetic.

711
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:46,862
Basically, you want hot water.

712
00:41:47,145 --> 00:41:48,100
Lukewarm.

713
00:41:48,585 --> 00:41:49,779
I'm not allowed hot drinks.

714
00:41:55,865 --> 00:41:57,139
Are you crying?

715
00:41:57,505 --> 00:41:59,621
Why are you crying?
- He's crying again?

716
00:41:59,745 --> 00:42:01,098
What's with kids these days?

717
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,660
I didn't cry three times
my whole life,

718
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:05,616
including when I was born.

719
00:42:11,305 --> 00:42:12,101
Here.

720
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:21,784
They killed him...

721
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:24,064
the people from the bank,

722
00:42:24,865 --> 00:42:25,934
they killed my dad.

723
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:28,179
Your son.

724
00:42:28,705 --> 00:42:30,661
He worked hours and hours

725
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:32,093
with his heart problem

726
00:42:32,225 --> 00:42:33,101
and they forced him,

727
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:37,460
they made him come at night
and work on the cage.

728
00:42:38,665 --> 00:42:39,620
Scumbags...

729
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:41,579
They killed him.

730
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:45,579
And they blame me.

731
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:50,864
They won't pay damages,
insurance, nothing.

732
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:52,424
Banks don't give you anything,

733
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:55,942
they even attach the pens
to the desk.

734
00:42:58,225 --> 00:42:59,658
So maybe...

735
00:43:00,385 --> 00:43:03,343
maybe you and Nick
should rob my dad's bank.

736
00:43:05,145 --> 00:43:06,863
Look at this kid...

737
00:43:07,425 --> 00:43:08,494
he's crazy.

738
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:09,876
He's...

739
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:11,460
He's just like you.

740
00:43:14,785 --> 00:43:17,538
Grandpa,
I know the whole security system.

741
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:20,902
I thought you were honest.
- We're all crooks, aren't we?

742
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:22,899
That's what you said.

743
00:43:23,065 --> 00:43:25,659
Nick, help me with this nut.

744
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:27,698
The kid's right.

745
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:29,338
I took a bullet for you.

746
00:43:30,345 --> 00:43:32,142
I can hardly see

747
00:43:32,265 --> 00:43:33,778
and I need the money.

748
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:35,864
What can they do to me in jail?

749
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:38,335
Put me in a dark room?

750
00:43:39,425 --> 00:43:40,824
You owe it to the kid.

751
00:43:42,425 --> 00:43:44,177
They killed his father.

752
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:47,054
Your son.

753
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:50,494
And I know you loved Daniel.

754
00:43:53,145 --> 00:43:55,864
You can't be that mad at someone
unless you love him.

755
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:02,304
Are you gonna let them get away
with killing your son?

756
00:44:02,745 --> 00:44:03,860
Huh, Eliyahu?

757
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:18,063
What? - You know, you always
drink the cheap stuff,

758
00:44:18,185 --> 00:44:21,063
so I brought along
some good whiskey.

759
00:44:21,705 --> 00:44:25,493
I thought that we could
share a drink,

760
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:27,214
for the good old days.

761
00:44:27,505 --> 00:44:29,735
What good old days?
We didn't have one good day.

762
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:31,093
We are busy.
- Listen to me.

763
00:44:32,185 --> 00:44:34,016
Eliyu Jew-boo-boob,

764
00:44:34,665 --> 00:44:38,499
I wondered if you had considered
the management's request,

765
00:44:38,945 --> 00:44:42,460
you know, about the form,
the "Do Not Resuscitate" for Rhoda,

766
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:45,093
you know, the DNR.
- How do you know about that?

767
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:49,298
Well, I was the one who asked them
if you had signed such a form.

768
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,295
You piece of shit!

769
00:44:52,705 --> 00:44:54,184
You want her dead, huh?

770
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,743
You want the house, don't you?

771
00:44:57,465 --> 00:44:59,535
I'm appalled. I'm amazed.
I'm shocked.

772
00:44:59,665 --> 00:45:01,223
Oh, so you don't want our house.

773
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:03,496
Listen, it's my house!

774
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,703
My father loaned it to you
until Rhoda died.

775
00:45:06,825 --> 00:45:09,180
It was never his intention
that you should inherit the place...

776
00:45:09,385 --> 00:45:10,818
No! Not the face!
I'm an actor!

777
00:45:11,265 --> 00:45:12,095
Need some help?

778
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:14,500
You little...

779
00:45:15,225 --> 00:45:16,624
I'll finish you up...

780
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:18,179
Listen, listen to me.

781
00:45:18,305 --> 00:45:22,093
I've consulted a solicitor
and he has advised me

782
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:26,304
that with the DNR form
and a doctor's opinion

783
00:45:26,425 --> 00:45:30,213
that a judge would
make me a trustee of the house

784
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:31,334
which was loaned to you,

785
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:36,255
and because you loved my sister I'm
willing to give you some of the money.

786
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:37,340
And the boy here.

787
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:40,335
Yes?
So just that you will know,

788
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:41,779
I sold the house.

789
00:45:42,145 --> 00:45:44,136
When I needed to take Rhoda
to a hospital

790
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:46,984
I took her to the best place,
so I used the money.

791
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,900
But Rhoda was in a coma.
How could she sign...

792
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:53,818
I forged her signature,
and yours too.

793
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:55,976
I got the money, I paid for her stay,

794
00:45:56,105 --> 00:45:58,539
for my apartment
and for Nick's apartment in the place.

795
00:45:58,865 --> 00:46:02,744
And the rest I donated to the Museum
for Israel's Struggle for Independence.

796
00:46:02,865 --> 00:46:04,423
You paid for me?

797
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:07,855
You donated my money
to a terrorist museum?

798
00:46:07,985 --> 00:46:09,134
Yes, I did.

799
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:11,142
Do you realize
how cool your grandpa is?

800
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:12,459
You had no right!

801
00:46:12,585 --> 00:46:13,301
Shut up!

802
00:46:13,425 --> 00:46:15,985
Right, my ass.
I'll do anything to protect my family.

803
00:46:16,105 --> 00:46:17,857
You have so much money
and you want to kill your sister?!

804
00:46:17,985 --> 00:46:19,134
Shithead!
- No, stop!

805
00:46:19,265 --> 00:46:19,981
Butt out, kid.

806
00:46:20,105 --> 00:46:21,857
It started before
the State was founded,

807
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:22,901
nothing to do with you.

808
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:24,856
Where's the gun, Eliyahu?
- You piece of...

809
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:25,701
Where's the gun?

810
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:27,975
Grandpa, please,
he's my uncle.

811
00:46:28,105 --> 00:46:29,663
So now you're on his side?

812
00:46:29,825 --> 00:46:31,144
I knew I couldn't trust you.

813
00:46:31,345 --> 00:46:33,700
Go with him, traitor.

814
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:36,584
The only form I will sign
is your execution.

815
00:46:36,865 --> 00:46:39,743
I still have my membership card
in a terrorist organization,

816
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:41,776
you piece of shit...

817
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:57,258
We don't have much time left.

818
00:46:58,465 --> 00:47:00,933
Not me, not you,
and certainly not Rhoda.

819
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,703
We have a gun and a car,

820
00:47:04,145 --> 00:47:07,262
we go into the bank, take the money,
and escape to the forest,

821
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:09,621
where we shot
the Major's head off.

822
00:47:10,425 --> 00:47:12,017
Like the good old days,

823
00:47:12,745 --> 00:47:14,337
the good life.

824
00:47:14,905 --> 00:47:16,099
It won't work, Grandpa.

825
00:47:16,785 --> 00:47:19,504
Why not?
- Because of the security.

826
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:21,902
Three guards
on the ground floor,

827
00:47:22,065 --> 00:47:23,100
eight cameras,

828
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,376
they'll drop the cage
before we reach the door.

829
00:47:25,665 --> 00:47:27,144
Besides, they have
a silent alarm.

830
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:31,264
They press a button
and the cops arrive in 3 minutes.

831
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:33,137
And you can't just open the safe,

832
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:36,179
you need a magnetic card
that opens it.

833
00:47:36,985 --> 00:47:39,579
Did Dad tell you that?
- He designed it,

834
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:41,423
he was an expert.

835
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:42,814
What a fool,

836
00:47:43,145 --> 00:47:46,023
he was such a genius that
his own system killed him.

837
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:48,341
That doesn't matter, Grandpa,

838
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,103
we need more people.

839
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:53,583
What about Shimon Caravani
from our days in the underground?

840
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:54,820
He has good hands.

841
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:56,254
He's dead.

842
00:47:56,385 --> 00:47:57,864
Shimon Caravani is dead?

843
00:47:58,265 --> 00:47:59,459
How did I miss that?

844
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:03,339
We were at his funeral together,
you eulogized him.

845
00:48:03,705 --> 00:48:06,094
How did he die?
- Just shut up, Nick.

846
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:12,901
What's going on here?

847
00:48:14,665 --> 00:48:16,223
Hedva told everyone
he's an English lord,

848
00:48:16,345 --> 00:48:17,824
they're all going wild.

849
00:48:18,185 --> 00:48:19,174
They say he's a billionaire.

850
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:21,256
Someone even said he owns
shares of Coca-Cola.

851
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:37,494
I am dancing the primitive
Jewish dance, the Hora!

852
00:48:37,905 --> 00:48:38,940
You just broke your hip.

853
00:48:39,385 --> 00:48:42,695
These Israeli women,
they're amazing!

854
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:46,542
Rita just asked me back
to her room after the party.

855
00:48:46,665 --> 00:48:48,701
Be careful, she has Parkinson's.

856
00:48:48,865 --> 00:48:50,298
Well, maybe that's all for the best

857
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:52,734
because I'm not allowed
to move my pelvis.

858
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:24,062
Come on, get up.

859
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:30,062
Why are only the girls are dancing?

860
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:44,023
Look at that.
They have no shame,

861
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:46,302
they forgot the Mandate,

862
00:49:46,665 --> 00:49:48,496
what the British did to us.

863
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:08,097
Look how they flock

864
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:10,420
when they see
a title of nobility.

865
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:12,454
That could help us.

866
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:15,739
What? - At the bank,
he acts like a lord.

867
00:50:15,865 --> 00:50:17,981
Everyone will look at him
and we'll carry out the plan.

868
00:50:23,785 --> 00:50:24,900
Bravo!

869
00:50:25,545 --> 00:50:28,855
Maybe the kid's idea
isn't so bad after all.

870
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:31,382
People show him respect.

871
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:35,254
They'll let him into the safe with the
briefcase without asking questions.

872
00:50:36,105 --> 00:50:37,823
Will one of you animals
help me up?

873
00:50:41,025 --> 00:50:42,094
He's a real-live lord.

874
00:50:42,225 --> 00:50:46,138
Our thanks to Lord Michael for
performing voluntarily and at no charge.

875
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:57,944
Jesus Christ,
you nearly stopped my pacemaker!

876
00:51:01,785 --> 00:51:03,901
Don't get blood on the shirt,
it's rented.

877
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:07,053
Uncle Michael,
we know you really need the money.

878
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:08,740
Nonsense. I'm wealthy.

879
00:51:09,425 --> 00:51:10,824
It's a matter of principle.

880
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,498
I read on the internet
you're broke.

881
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:14,463
You even sold
your title of nobility.

882
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:17,415
It was all in the
House of Lords website.

883
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:18,734
They have a website?

884
00:51:19,345 --> 00:51:20,937
Your father donated
all his money.

885
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:23,136
You didn't have a job
in theatre in years.

886
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:25,301
It's a tough business,
show business.

887
00:51:26,505 --> 00:51:28,063
You're never the right age.

888
00:51:28,465 --> 00:51:30,820
I could pass for 45 on the stage,

889
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:33,499
in the right lighting.
- You mean darkness.

890
00:51:34,385 --> 00:51:36,899
When I was your age
I played Oliver Twist.

891
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:38,743
People are still talking about it.

892
00:51:39,225 --> 00:51:41,614
"Please, sir, can I have some more? "

893
00:51:43,545 --> 00:51:45,934
My father never came to see it.

894
00:51:46,545 --> 00:51:50,094
Too busy growing tea leaves
in Sri Lanka.

895
00:51:50,345 --> 00:51:52,256
Unbelievable. He's broke.

896
00:51:52,385 --> 00:51:55,695
Too busy hunting elephants
in India.

897
00:51:57,145 --> 00:52:00,820
I need 232,000 Euros.
A.S.A.P.

898
00:52:01,105 --> 00:52:01,821
What for?

899
00:52:02,025 --> 00:52:05,301
I'm going to start a new
theatre company. That's all I need,

900
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:06,784
one good part.

901
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:09,701
You see, I'm not like you,
Elilulu,

902
00:52:10,385 --> 00:52:13,616
I don't have a warm,
close personal family.

903
00:52:14,185 --> 00:52:15,903
If I die, there's nothing.

904
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:19,575
No legacy.
No lifetime achievement awards.

905
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:23,384
I'm an actor.
I need to act.

906
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:28,895
We have an idea
for how you can get the money.

907
00:52:29,505 --> 00:52:32,815
Uncle Michael,
we will rob a bank together.

908
00:52:36,545 --> 00:52:38,695
I've never played
a bank robber...

909
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:41,304
Will it be a big part?

910
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,143
Will I have a lot of lines?

911
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,218
A monologue, perhaps?

912
00:52:45,545 --> 00:52:46,455
A monologue?

913
00:53:16,545 --> 00:53:18,501
I suggest we rob the bank
with our weaknesses.

914
00:53:19,145 --> 00:53:20,578
Grandpa, do you have
a disabled sticker?

915
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:21,741
Never.

916
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,617
You can get one easily

917
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:26,857
with your water on the knee
and herniated disc.

918
00:53:27,185 --> 00:53:29,221
Let down your dignity a little.

919
00:53:29,385 --> 00:53:31,262
Okay, Grandpa,
you'll get a disabled sticker

920
00:53:31,505 --> 00:53:33,223
and we'll park in front...

921
00:53:36,305 --> 00:53:39,581
Nick will block the door
to the guards' room with his walker.

922
00:53:42,105 --> 00:53:43,902
Not bad, not bad.

923
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:45,655
Michael...

924
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:48,576
No, no, you can call me Alfred,

925
00:53:48,785 --> 00:53:50,104
that's my character's name.

926
00:53:50,345 --> 00:53:54,782
And I spent several years
growing plants in the Far East.

927
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:59,335
Really?
- No, not me. It's background.

928
00:54:00,065 --> 00:54:01,498
I'm a method actor.

929
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:04,823
You go inside
and you go to the clerk.

930
00:54:05,065 --> 00:54:07,260
Okay.
- Okay, here.

931
00:54:08,905 --> 00:54:09,815
Here, here.

932
00:54:10,225 --> 00:54:10,975
Okay?

933
00:54:11,505 --> 00:54:13,735
What's my motivation?
- The money!

934
00:54:13,865 --> 00:54:15,742
No, no, you never rob banks
for money,

935
00:54:15,865 --> 00:54:17,378
it's always for revenge or sex.

936
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:21,259
Sex for who? For the kid? For me?
- Perhaps for Alfred.

937
00:54:21,985 --> 00:54:24,818
So there I am,
alone with her in her office,

938
00:54:25,105 --> 00:54:27,460
and she removes her sweater.

939
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:30,220
And I say to her:
My dear, you must understand,

940
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:35,061
I will not sleep with you for the role,
but I will sleep with you for the money!

941
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:37,538
I grab you like this,

942
00:54:37,705 --> 00:54:39,855
put the gun to your head,
and say:

943
00:54:40,665 --> 00:54:42,417
"If anybody moves, he gets it."

944
00:54:42,865 --> 00:54:45,299
If anybody moves, he gets it!

945
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:50,062
If anybody moves, he gets it!

946
00:54:51,265 --> 00:54:53,221
I'll blow the kid's head off!

947
00:54:53,505 --> 00:54:54,255
Dear God!

948
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:55,196
The boy!

949
00:54:55,785 --> 00:54:56,661
Do something!

950
00:54:57,825 --> 00:54:58,562
The boy!

951
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,058
Put down the gun!

952
00:55:00,305 --> 00:55:01,101
Down!

953
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:02,658
Well, Eliyahu? What now?

954
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:04,338
I aim the gun at you, Nick,

955
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:07,702
and say:
"Old man, open the safe for me."

956
00:55:07,865 --> 00:55:10,663
I don't want to be a hostage,
I want the gun.

957
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:13,424
With your eyesight
you'll shoot yourself in the ass.

958
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,616
You and the kid open the safe.

959
00:55:17,945 --> 00:55:18,934
Okay, Michael,

960
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:24,058
you go up the stairs, here, yes,

961
00:55:24,225 --> 00:55:26,614
into the bank manager's office.

962
00:55:27,145 --> 00:55:28,498
And you lock the door,

963
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:29,853
to block the silent alarm.

964
00:55:29,985 --> 00:55:31,896
Later you will say that
you did it because you panicked.

965
00:55:32,025 --> 00:55:33,936
Panic? I can do panic.

966
00:55:34,305 --> 00:55:35,374
Open the door!

967
00:55:35,505 --> 00:55:38,099
I have to press the button...
- No Hebrew.

968
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,217
Alfred, no Hebrew.

969
00:55:40,345 --> 00:55:43,894
Please...
- Espanol, Francais, Italiano...

970
00:55:44,025 --> 00:55:46,016
Okay!
- Un poquito Mandarin...

971
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,656
Please... - No Hebrew.
- Open the door!

972
00:55:50,825 --> 00:55:52,383
I need to push the button.

973
00:55:57,185 --> 00:55:58,538
You believed that, didn't you?

974
00:55:58,745 --> 00:56:01,020
The first code is my birth date.

975
00:56:01,785 --> 00:56:03,616
When is my monologue?
- What?

976
00:56:03,745 --> 00:56:05,337
My monologue.
When do I do the monologue?

977
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:06,341
Not now, Michael.

978
00:56:06,465 --> 00:56:07,739
Second code is Mom's birth date

979
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:12,814
and the third code is 17011925.

980
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,621
Isn't that your birthday, Eliyahu?

981
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,384
Does that matter now, Nick?

982
00:56:17,545 --> 00:56:20,059
But it won't open
without the magnetic card.

983
00:56:20,185 --> 00:56:21,743
Where can we get that?

984
00:56:23,025 --> 00:56:24,538
I think Dad had one,

985
00:56:24,745 --> 00:56:26,337
it's still at our house.

986
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:52,299
Jonathan, honey, sweetie,
what are you doing here?

987
00:57:52,425 --> 00:57:53,494
I came to visit.

988
00:57:54,465 --> 00:57:56,615
How's your lovely mother?

989
00:57:57,425 --> 00:57:58,380
Tell her...

990
00:57:58,545 --> 00:57:59,660
Don't bother, I'll tell her.

991
00:57:59,865 --> 00:58:01,662
It's okay, I'll tell her.
- No, I'll tell her.

992
00:58:01,905 --> 00:58:05,215
It's fine, I'll tell her.
- Jonathan, I'll tell her.

993
00:58:05,705 --> 00:58:08,538
So you came to visit, huh?
- Yeah.

994
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,255
This must remind you
of your late father.

995
00:58:11,585 --> 00:58:13,064
I was just talking about him,

996
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:14,738
we miss him very much.

997
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:16,617
I was just telling...

998
00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:19,737
Alex, how much I miss Daniel.

999
00:58:22,425 --> 00:58:23,653
I'll be going.

1000
00:58:24,945 --> 00:58:25,900
All right.

1001
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:29,015
Dedi,

1002
00:58:29,825 --> 00:58:31,144
how much money is in here?

1003
00:58:31,865 --> 00:58:33,184
Didn't your father tell you?

1004
00:58:34,225 --> 00:58:35,977
We hardly keep
any money in here,

1005
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:37,938
only if someone wants
to do a big transaction

1006
00:58:38,745 --> 00:58:40,895
in cash,

1007
00:58:41,225 --> 00:58:42,214
but generally

1008
00:58:42,345 --> 00:58:44,301
we don't keep more than
20 or 30 thousand shekels here.

1009
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,016
We call it "the white elephant."

1010
00:58:48,665 --> 00:58:50,496
The safe is the most
expensive thing here.

1011
00:58:52,545 --> 00:58:53,739
Enjoy yourself, pal,

1012
00:58:54,025 --> 00:58:56,175
have a look around.

1013
00:59:33,465 --> 00:59:34,784
Gentleman.

1014
00:59:35,185 --> 00:59:39,098
I will bring my husband to you
that you... learn him.

1015
00:59:39,225 --> 00:59:41,056
Fuck, English is such
a hard language.

1016
00:59:41,305 --> 00:59:42,784
You have a husband?
That's wonderful.

1017
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:44,458
What husband?
We're getting divorced,

1018
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:46,297
I'm divorcing.

1019
00:59:46,665 --> 00:59:48,781
You're divorcing?
That's even better.

1020
00:59:48,905 --> 00:59:51,180
You know, my husband,
he's no gentleman.

1021
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:52,499
He hits me.

1022
00:59:52,705 --> 00:59:54,377
Oh, you shouldn't let him do that.

1023
00:59:54,585 --> 00:59:56,735
You should go to the police,
pay the bribe,

1024
00:59:56,865 --> 00:59:58,298
and they will take care of it.

1025
00:59:58,505 --> 00:59:59,276
You know,

1026
00:59:59,745 --> 01:00:03,784
you're the only one here
that don't want sex to Sigi.

1027
01:00:03,945 --> 01:00:04,855
Sex? Me...

1028
01:00:05,505 --> 01:00:06,301
No...

1029
01:00:07,545 --> 01:00:08,944
The last time I had sex,

1030
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:12,057
the Queen was voted one of the
sexiest ten women in England.

1031
01:00:13,345 --> 01:00:14,255
Didn't understand a word...

1032
01:00:16,065 --> 01:00:16,815
Listen, listen.

1033
01:00:17,385 --> 01:00:20,582
I have a boy,
he's eight years old.

1034
01:00:20,705 --> 01:00:22,297
His English is terrible,

1035
01:00:22,425 --> 01:00:23,540
not good at all.

1036
01:00:24,065 --> 01:00:27,216
So maybe tomorrow
you come to Sigi house

1037
01:00:27,585 --> 01:00:30,338
and you will learn him English.
What do you say?

1038
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:31,898
Let me check my diary.

1039
01:00:33,545 --> 01:00:35,854
I'm free.
- Great!

1040
01:00:45,265 --> 01:00:47,301
Hava nagila...

1041
01:00:50,265 --> 01:00:51,698
Come on, we have to go.

1042
01:00:51,945 --> 01:00:53,424
I tell you, it's a bad idea.

1043
01:00:53,545 --> 01:00:56,218
It's the only way to get the magnetic
card which will open the safe.

1044
01:00:56,345 --> 01:00:58,620
Breaking into
the bank manager's house?!

1045
01:00:58,945 --> 01:01:01,140
It's beyond stupid!

1046
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:04,822
Not to mention the fact
that Jonathan's mother is dating him.

1047
01:01:04,985 --> 01:01:05,701
Shut up.

1048
01:01:05,825 --> 01:01:07,053
Sh-she's not dating him,

1049
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:09,619
sh-she just needs the money.

1050
01:01:09,825 --> 01:01:12,020
Duke, that doesn't make it
sound much better.

1051
01:01:12,145 --> 01:01:14,784
He's meeting her to sign the loan
document. We don't have much time...

1052
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,260
Nick!

1053
01:01:17,785 --> 01:01:20,618
Why do we always
let the blind man drive?

1054
01:01:20,745 --> 01:01:22,497
Because he knows the way.
Get in!

1055
01:01:25,505 --> 01:01:27,860
Is it my glasses or are those stains
on the windshield?

1056
01:01:28,425 --> 01:01:30,575
Concentrate on the lights
in front of you.

1057
01:01:30,905 --> 01:01:33,021
We're all going to die.
We're all going to die.

1058
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:37,935
Stop...

1059
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:39,860
This is the building.

1060
01:01:49,345 --> 01:01:50,983
What the fuck you are doing?

1061
01:01:51,465 --> 01:01:52,944
I don't want to be recognized.

1062
01:01:53,065 --> 01:01:54,737
Who will recognize you?

1063
01:01:54,905 --> 01:01:58,056
Hey, a woman stopped me
in the street once,

1064
01:01:58,225 --> 01:01:59,578
she'd seen me in a play.

1065
01:01:59,785 --> 01:02:01,138
She started hitting me.

1066
01:02:01,825 --> 01:02:03,224
She wanted her money back.

1067
01:02:04,185 --> 01:02:06,415
"Dedi's House of Fun"

1068
01:02:18,065 --> 01:02:18,781
Hello.

1069
01:02:18,905 --> 01:02:23,456
Excuse me, I have a somewhat
personal question for you. - Yes?

1070
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:27,617
How long have you lived here?

1071
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:30,779
Five years, why?

1072
01:02:32,585 --> 01:02:35,702
You were right,
this is the place.

1073
01:02:36,785 --> 01:02:38,298
I'm sorry,

1074
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:40,417
this boy here,

1075
01:02:40,545 --> 01:02:44,060
his father died
a few weeks ago.

1076
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:46,059
I'm his grandfather.

1077
01:02:46,505 --> 01:02:48,973
These are his uncles
from England.

1078
01:02:49,305 --> 01:02:52,297
How do you do.
- Yes. - Yes?

1079
01:02:52,425 --> 01:02:55,542
If you don't mind us
looking around,

1080
01:02:55,665 --> 01:02:58,463
they lived here
when he was a baby.

1081
01:02:58,665 --> 01:02:59,984
Sure, come in.

1082
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:01,614
Water?

1083
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:05,498
Coffee?
- Oh, okay.

1084
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:06,695
Thank you.

1085
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:34,336
What are you doing, you idiot?

1086
01:03:43,385 --> 01:03:45,182
Thank you, ma'am,
you've been a great help.

1087
01:03:46,105 --> 01:03:46,981
Thank you.

1088
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:08,819
Quiet, be quiet!
For God's sake!

1089
01:04:13,785 --> 01:04:14,774
I found it.

1090
01:04:16,505 --> 01:04:17,540
Good work, kid,

1091
01:04:17,825 --> 01:04:19,816
now switch it
with your dad's card,

1092
01:04:19,945 --> 01:04:21,014
the one they cancelled.

1093
01:04:21,145 --> 01:04:21,916
Why?

1094
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:23,936
So he thinks his card
isn't working.

1095
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:26,780
Hurry up.

1096
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:28,094
Look at this,

1097
01:04:28,385 --> 01:04:30,979
he has cherry-flavored condoms.

1098
01:04:31,105 --> 01:04:32,333
Put a hole in each of them.

1099
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:33,541
Let's go.

1100
01:04:34,465 --> 01:04:35,614
Oh, Viagra.

1101
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:37,778
I take two, you take two?

1102
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:39,577
I don't need them.
- Me neither.

1103
01:04:40,185 --> 01:04:41,220
Come on, let's go.

1104
01:04:43,225 --> 01:04:43,996
Oh, crap.

1105
01:04:44,025 --> 01:04:44,741
He's back.

1106
01:04:54,905 --> 01:04:56,133
We're all going to prison.

1107
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:59,264
Please tell me I won't be the bitch.
- Shut up.

1108
01:05:12,345 --> 01:05:13,824
They can't see us.

1109
01:06:50,025 --> 01:06:51,424
You know, Duke,

1110
01:06:52,025 --> 01:06:53,777
you are just like Hamlet.

1111
01:06:54,585 --> 01:06:58,214
They murdered your father
and now they're after your mother.

1112
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:01,662
You must be torn apart inside.

1113
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:03,703
I'm okay, Uncle Michael.

1114
01:07:05,145 --> 01:07:07,659
He's taking advantage of her,
she's...

1115
01:07:07,825 --> 01:07:08,655
She's confused.

1116
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:10,178
She forgot your father.

1117
01:07:10,345 --> 01:07:12,575
Before your corpse is cold

1118
01:07:12,705 --> 01:07:14,343
people forget you.

1119
01:07:15,305 --> 01:07:17,899
Better to die first
and spare yourself the shame.

1120
01:07:18,145 --> 01:07:21,103
That's not true, Grandpa.
- What do you know?

1121
01:07:45,785 --> 01:07:47,298
I enter...

1122
01:07:47,865 --> 01:07:48,661
I smile.

1123
01:07:49,745 --> 01:07:51,542
I approach the guard
and I say...

1124
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:52,814
Hey, hey, hold it.

1125
01:07:52,945 --> 01:07:54,344
You don't speak to the guard.
We've changed the plan.

1126
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:56,735
You go straight to Simona.

1127
01:07:56,865 --> 01:07:59,584
What are you talking about?
You can't take away my line.

1128
01:07:59,745 --> 01:08:00,973
What line?

1129
01:08:01,585 --> 01:08:05,976
I have based my entire
characterization on the guard line.

1130
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:09,177
You take that away,
there's no Alfred.

1131
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:10,898
I have nothing to work with.

1132
01:08:11,025 --> 01:08:15,098
You were only supposed to tell
the guard, "Hi, I'm here for Simona."

1133
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,693
Precisely! That's Alfred

1134
01:08:17,865 --> 01:08:19,059
in a nutshell!

1135
01:08:38,465 --> 01:08:39,739
Do you love her?

1136
01:08:40,265 --> 01:08:41,539
What? Why?

1137
01:08:42,345 --> 01:08:46,418
You have the look, you know,
the look of love in your eyes.

1138
01:08:47,545 --> 01:08:49,456
No. No, no, no,

1139
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:52,543
Sigi is a charming girl, but...

1140
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:54,574
The thing is,

1141
01:08:55,345 --> 01:08:57,654
she has asked me to her house.

1142
01:08:57,945 --> 01:09:01,984
Now, I am not going
but she said something about divorce,

1143
01:09:02,185 --> 01:09:05,416
and she wanted me
to see her place.

1144
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:08,100
How come my dreams
are happening to him?

1145
01:09:08,225 --> 01:09:10,261
I won't go, of course.
- You're going there,

1146
01:09:10,385 --> 01:09:12,455
and you're going to remember
every detail!

1147
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:15,458
And please, if you can,
bring me her underwear, you know,

1148
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:17,621
the one with the rope
getting into her ass.

1149
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:21,185
And maybe
you're gonna need this.

1150
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:23,895
She's too young!
- So what?

1151
01:09:24,305 --> 01:09:27,502
Yves Montand was 75

1152
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,014
when he married a woman
in the age of 22.

1153
01:09:30,145 --> 01:09:32,534
The French are always
marrying their daughters.

1154
01:09:32,785 --> 01:09:34,696
Give me a gun,
I'm going to kill the Brit.

1155
01:09:34,825 --> 01:09:37,055
Michael, listen to me.
Nick is right. Go to Sigi.

1156
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:40,741
And remember, in Israel
if a woman asks if you want coffee,

1157
01:09:40,945 --> 01:09:42,458
she wants to go to bed.

1158
01:09:49,305 --> 01:09:52,980
And use only half.
If you use one, it can blow your head.

1159
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,743
Look what happened to me.

1160
01:10:03,385 --> 01:10:04,898
Hello, madame,

1161
01:10:05,345 --> 01:10:08,542
you look good.
- Thank you.

1162
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:11,453
I'm alone here, so just a minute.

1163
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:41,740
Coffee?

1164
01:10:42,265 --> 01:10:43,175
No.

1165
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:47,937
Yes, yes, coffee, yes...
Coffee!

1166
01:10:49,265 --> 01:10:51,859
Finally.
You tell your stupid father 5:00...

1167
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:53,938
Your English teacher.
- I don't want to.

1168
01:10:54,065 --> 01:10:55,339
Shut up or I'll kick you,

1169
01:10:55,465 --> 01:10:56,944
I'm concerned for your future,

1170
01:10:57,065 --> 01:10:58,134
you have a teacher
from London here,

1171
01:10:58,265 --> 01:11:00,256
at last an American.
- I don't feel like it.

1172
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:04,424
This is the boy.
Michael will learn you English.

1173
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:10,259
Hello.

1174
01:11:10,785 --> 01:11:13,345
English lesson for the 7th grade.

1175
01:11:13,585 --> 01:11:14,574
Cry Wolf.

1176
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,294
You know this story?

1177
01:11:22,025 --> 01:11:24,061
It's all about a little boy
who cried wolf so often,

1178
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:26,695
eventually nobody
believed him and then...

1179
01:11:43,945 --> 01:11:45,617
Eureka!

1180
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:47,539
Hey, hey!

1181
01:11:48,785 --> 01:11:52,095
I've worked out
how to stop the silent alarm.

1182
01:11:52,745 --> 01:11:53,734
How was it?

1183
01:11:53,905 --> 01:11:55,497
Great. Great!

1184
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:58,253
Here's your G-string.

1185
01:11:59,585 --> 01:12:02,418
Okay.
I know how to stop the alarm.

1186
01:12:02,665 --> 01:12:05,338
We cry wolf.
You go to the bank...

1187
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:21,299
Hello, good morning.

1188
01:12:22,545 --> 01:12:25,855
I am Michael Simpson.
Lord Michael Simpson.

1189
01:12:26,025 --> 01:12:26,775
Lord.

1190
01:12:27,145 --> 01:12:30,774
I am the director
of the Voluntary Association

1191
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:32,856
for Old Brave Jewish Terrorists

1192
01:12:32,985 --> 01:12:36,944
who founded
this wonderful overheated country

1193
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:39,738
and I need a short-term loan
in cash.

1194
01:12:40,025 --> 01:12:42,983
Please sit down, Lord Simpson.
- Thank you.

1195
01:12:45,105 --> 01:12:48,381
How much do you need?
- Two million Euros, por favor.

1196
01:12:48,545 --> 01:12:51,184
It's a stick-up!
A stick-up!

1197
01:12:51,305 --> 01:12:53,023
That man is a bank robber!

1198
01:12:53,145 --> 01:12:55,818
What on earth is going on?
- He's a bank robber!

1199
01:12:55,945 --> 01:12:57,697
He has a rifle! It's a stick-up!
Search him!

1200
01:12:57,825 --> 01:12:59,497
It's a stick-up!

1201
01:12:59,665 --> 01:13:02,577
Down on the floor!
- Manager!

1202
01:13:05,305 --> 01:13:07,773
Get down, get down!

1203
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:08,642
It's a stick-up!

1204
01:13:08,705 --> 01:13:10,343
Can't you see it's a stick-up?!

1205
01:13:10,465 --> 01:13:11,818
Everyone calm down!

1206
01:13:12,025 --> 01:13:13,583
Calm down,

1207
01:13:13,785 --> 01:13:16,902
you're all safe! Calm down!

1208
01:13:20,345 --> 01:13:21,539
Nobody move.

1209
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:24,173
I told them. That's Nick.

1210
01:13:33,265 --> 01:13:34,698
What did you see, Nick?

1211
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:37,698
He had a rifle.

1212
01:13:37,985 --> 01:13:39,862
He said you had a gun.
He saw you with a gun.

1213
01:13:39,985 --> 01:13:41,896
I saw, he had a rifle.

1214
01:13:46,185 --> 01:13:48,301
It's just an umbrella.

1215
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:49,778
That's okay.

1216
01:13:50,345 --> 01:13:51,903
Where do you live, Gramps?

1217
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:56,693
In an old-age home.

1218
01:13:57,985 --> 01:13:58,895
Come, Nick.

1219
01:14:00,305 --> 01:14:01,738
Come along.
- Mr. Dedi.

1220
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:04,499
Get up. Come along.

1221
01:14:09,305 --> 01:14:11,455
It's all right.
- It's all right.

1222
01:14:11,585 --> 01:14:13,621
Everyone go back to work,
it's all right.

1223
01:14:14,305 --> 01:14:16,535
And then, a week later,

1224
01:14:16,705 --> 01:14:19,936
Nick goes back to the bank
and shouts again.

1225
01:14:21,785 --> 01:14:24,253
It's a stick-up!
He has a knife!

1226
01:14:24,425 --> 01:14:26,017
It's a stick-up!
He has a knife!

1227
01:14:26,345 --> 01:14:28,495
Everybody down. I saw it!

1228
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:30,098
It's a stick-up!

1229
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:31,983
Manager, it's a stick-up!

1230
01:14:33,585 --> 01:14:35,496
First thing,
you get rid of those bars.

1231
01:14:35,945 --> 01:14:38,379
What is this,
the gorilla cage at the zoo?

1232
01:14:38,585 --> 01:14:40,257
Do you even have insurance
for that thing?

1233
01:14:40,385 --> 01:14:41,738
My late security manager

1234
01:14:41,865 --> 01:14:43,093
thought it was necessary.

1235
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:45,785
Dedi, please. We're a joke.

1236
01:14:46,985 --> 01:14:49,977
And next time
that poor old man

1237
01:14:50,105 --> 01:14:51,936
yells "stick-up,"

1238
01:14:52,065 --> 01:14:54,738
if anyone sets off
the silent alarm,

1239
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:55,775
disable it.

1240
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:57,054
You hear, Vlada?
That's my decision,

1241
01:14:57,185 --> 01:14:59,141
disable the silent alarm.

1242
01:15:13,145 --> 01:15:14,134
They installed a silent alarm

1243
01:15:14,265 --> 01:15:16,620
that cost the government
10 million dollars

1244
01:15:16,785 --> 01:15:19,379
and the police had it disabled

1245
01:15:19,505 --> 01:15:22,975
just because some old man yelled
"stick-up" at the bank.

1246
01:15:23,105 --> 01:15:24,538
What a screw-up!

1247
01:15:24,665 --> 01:15:26,144
And that's not all,

1248
01:15:26,265 --> 01:15:29,063
all three old men were diagnosed
with advanced dementia

1249
01:15:29,185 --> 01:15:31,141
five days apart from each other.

1250
01:15:31,465 --> 01:15:33,296
You don't think
they were senile?

1251
01:15:33,425 --> 01:15:36,098
You can't put someone
with dementia on trial.

1252
01:15:36,385 --> 01:15:37,659
So how's school, pal?

1253
01:15:38,025 --> 01:15:40,016
I listen to the teachers carefully

1254
01:15:40,185 --> 01:15:41,698
so I know exactly
what not to do.

1255
01:15:44,425 --> 01:15:47,417
Do you know the most important rule
I've learned as a bank manager?

1256
01:15:48,865 --> 01:15:50,059
Don't be greedy.

1257
01:15:50,185 --> 01:15:52,380
You can even learn from morons.

1258
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:54,536
I can see why you say that.

1259
01:15:59,345 --> 01:16:02,303
Dedi, can I have a moment
alone with Jonathan? - Sure.

1260
01:16:05,345 --> 01:16:07,256
I'll call you later.
- Dorit.

1261
01:16:22,665 --> 01:16:25,133
He asked us
to move in with him.

1262
01:16:27,265 --> 01:16:29,142
Mom, I'll take care of us,

1263
01:16:29,305 --> 01:16:31,102
I'll get you the money.

1264
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:33,181
You can't spend all your time
at the old-age home.

1265
01:16:33,945 --> 01:16:36,095
He's my grandfather
and he's my friend.

1266
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:39,461
He isn't anyone's friend,

1267
01:16:39,585 --> 01:16:41,701
he only cares about himself.

1268
01:16:42,585 --> 01:16:44,815
When your dad was young,
he took him to a movie

1269
01:16:44,945 --> 01:16:47,698
and left him there
to go see another woman.

1270
01:16:48,865 --> 01:16:51,140
I don't believe it.

1271
01:16:55,145 --> 01:16:58,296
He's loyal to Grandma,
you should see how he treats her.

1272
01:16:58,425 --> 01:16:59,414
That isn't love,

1273
01:16:59,545 --> 01:17:02,264
that's guilt.

1274
01:17:03,705 --> 01:17:05,502
You didn't let him come
to my bris.

1275
01:17:06,785 --> 01:17:08,184
When I was pregnant with you

1276
01:17:08,305 --> 01:17:09,977
Eliyahu and Rhoda met with me.

1277
01:17:11,265 --> 01:17:13,460
They tried to convince me
to have an abortion,

1278
01:17:13,825 --> 01:17:16,737
to kill you. You see?

1279
01:17:17,465 --> 01:17:19,695
That's what
your grandfather wanted.

1280
01:17:20,105 --> 01:17:22,699
You don't know
what's best for me.

1281
01:17:22,825 --> 01:17:24,417
I'm not doing this for you,

1282
01:17:25,385 --> 01:17:27,296
I'm doing it for me.

1283
01:17:28,585 --> 01:17:30,257
I need to be loved.

1284
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:35,302
Everyone has their weaknesses
and I'm in love with Dedi.

1285
01:17:35,665 --> 01:17:36,984
That's Dad's picture.

1286
01:17:38,545 --> 01:17:41,617
Where will you put it
when you move in with Dedi?

1287
01:17:41,905 --> 01:17:44,624
Do you want him to see you
with another man? - Stop it!

1288
01:17:45,785 --> 01:17:47,616
So what if
you're smarter than me?

1289
01:17:48,065 --> 01:17:51,182
So what if you have
a smart-ass answer to everything?

1290
01:17:52,025 --> 01:17:53,458
You think it's easy for me?

1291
01:17:53,665 --> 01:17:55,576
That I don't feel terrible about it?

1292
01:17:56,825 --> 01:17:59,385
But how long do I have to wait?

1293
01:18:00,785 --> 01:18:02,184
I loved your father,

1294
01:18:03,825 --> 01:18:06,976
but a 40-year-old woman can't
move to an old-age home and die.

1295
01:18:38,825 --> 01:18:39,621
Nick,

1296
01:18:40,385 --> 01:18:43,536
remember, "only death can
release us from the ranks."

1297
01:18:47,745 --> 01:18:52,102
Yalla, Yalla!
Let's go and hunt those elephants!

1298
01:18:55,025 --> 01:18:56,458
Mr. Gurevitch,
please come with me.

1299
01:19:03,825 --> 01:19:05,463
Don't forget to break
the security camera.

1300
01:19:05,585 --> 01:19:07,701
Are you crazy?
Break the camera? Never.

1301
01:19:08,985 --> 01:19:12,216
Simona!
I'm ready for my close-up.

1302
01:19:19,865 --> 01:19:22,618
It's such an honor
to have you here, Lord Simpson.

1303
01:19:23,545 --> 01:19:27,174
Your money's here,
two million Euros, in the safe.

1304
01:19:27,465 --> 01:19:30,298
You can call me Alfred.
It's a kind of nickname.

1305
01:19:34,265 --> 01:19:35,095
Jonathan...

1306
01:19:36,745 --> 01:19:37,939
Dedi.

1307
01:19:38,265 --> 01:19:41,462
Good afternoon. - Hello!
Good afternoon, Mr. Simpson.

1308
01:19:41,585 --> 01:19:45,214
Lord Simpson.
- Oh, sorry. Please have a seat.

1309
01:19:46,705 --> 01:19:49,697
Okay then, you want
your two million Euros. - Yes.

1310
01:19:50,465 --> 01:19:54,697
Small denominations, used.
Unmarked.

1311
01:20:07,305 --> 01:20:10,342
Do you have a guarantee?
- I'm a walking guarantee.

1312
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,377
Such a great humor.

1313
01:20:26,745 --> 01:20:31,261
It's a stick-up!
It's a stick-up!

1314
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:33,383
Good, Nick, good...

1315
01:20:39,425 --> 01:20:41,620
Who set off the alarm?

1316
01:20:41,745 --> 01:20:42,973
Disable it now.

1317
01:20:43,105 --> 01:20:44,424
Tell the police to forget it.

1318
01:20:45,705 --> 01:20:47,343
I'm sorry, you have to leave.

1319
01:20:49,505 --> 01:20:51,257
I was just kidding, I...

1320
01:20:51,665 --> 01:20:53,144
I'm here to deposit money.

1321
01:20:53,745 --> 01:20:56,384
Then sit here and don't
make trouble, okay? - Okay.

1322
01:20:56,545 --> 01:20:57,500
Good.

1323
01:20:58,785 --> 01:20:59,774
Hold these.

1324
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:02,580
Put them on me.

1325
01:21:05,065 --> 01:21:06,054
Good.

1326
01:21:09,705 --> 01:21:10,899
Do you need the restroom?

1327
01:21:11,065 --> 01:21:14,341
No, I'm using a mobile.

1328
01:21:15,425 --> 01:21:17,416
Nick, you can't stand here.
Go sit down.

1329
01:21:17,545 --> 01:21:19,422
I want to stand there.
What'll you do to me?

1330
01:21:19,545 --> 01:21:22,218
That door must stay open,
it's the security room.

1331
01:21:22,345 --> 01:21:24,700
Nick, do as I say
or you're out.

1332
01:21:25,385 --> 01:21:26,156
What's the big deal?

1333
01:21:26,185 --> 01:21:27,777
Do I look 5 years old to you?

1334
01:21:27,945 --> 01:21:29,458
Nick, with all due respect,

1335
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:32,099
go sit over there, you hear me?

1336
01:21:34,105 --> 01:21:36,061
And what if I don't?

1337
01:21:37,265 --> 01:21:38,778
What'll you do to me?

1338
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:41,424
What'll you do to me?

1339
01:21:42,145 --> 01:21:43,419
What'll you do to me?

1340
01:21:43,585 --> 01:21:44,356
Nick.

1341
01:21:45,131 --> 01:21:46,564
Nick, what are you doing?
- Is he crazy?

1342
01:21:46,691 --> 01:21:49,330
Now I want to stand here.
What'll you do?

1343
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:51,009
He's supposed to be a hostage.

1344
01:21:51,131 --> 01:21:53,122
What'll you do now?

1345
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:55,442
I want to stand here.
What'll you do?

1346
01:21:55,731 --> 01:21:56,447
Nick...

1347
01:21:56,571 --> 01:21:57,321
Don't move.

1348
01:21:57,451 --> 01:21:58,520
Put down the gun,

1349
01:21:58,651 --> 01:22:00,289
Nick, you hear me?

1350
01:22:02,371 --> 01:22:04,009
Put down the gun.

1351
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:06,280
Shit...

1352
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:09,529
Things are out of control.

1353
01:22:11,571 --> 01:22:14,643
I took the security guard's gun.

1354
01:22:15,211 --> 01:22:18,123
Damn it...
This is a stick-up!

1355
01:22:18,811 --> 01:22:19,960
This is a stick-up!

1356
01:22:20,251 --> 01:22:22,367
Get down, you,
this is a stick-up!

1357
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:23,879
Nick, Nick, are you robbing me?

1358
01:22:24,091 --> 01:22:25,604
You're our client.

1359
01:22:25,771 --> 01:22:26,760
Are you surprised?

1360
01:22:26,891 --> 01:22:28,961
You should've read
the fine print.

1361
01:22:29,251 --> 01:22:32,288
And what happens to people
who can't read the fine print?

1362
01:22:33,811 --> 01:22:35,039
Don't move.

1363
01:22:35,571 --> 01:22:37,004
Nobody move!

1364
01:22:40,491 --> 01:22:41,924
Everyone calm down.

1365
01:22:42,211 --> 01:22:43,405
Lie down on the floor.

1366
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:46,165
The floor's clean.
It's just been washed,

1367
01:22:46,331 --> 01:22:48,765
we're insured, don't worry
about the stick-up.

1368
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:53,169
Everybody!
I have a monologue!

1369
01:22:53,331 --> 01:22:57,609
Oh, evil, I listen carefully...

1370
01:22:57,851 --> 01:22:58,966
What's he doing, Grandpa?

1371
01:22:59,731 --> 01:23:02,165
He wanted a monologue.
Like an idiot, I listened to you.

1372
01:23:02,331 --> 01:23:06,768
...in times of war
parts played may alter,

1373
01:23:06,891 --> 01:23:10,725
the kidnapper sometimes
becomes the prisoner!

1374
01:23:11,451 --> 01:23:13,442
Son of a bitch,
what is he doing?

1375
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:15,687
Grandpa, I think
he's trying to say something.

1376
01:23:16,011 --> 01:23:17,569
Simona!
- I'm coming!

1377
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:18,806
Nick will kidnap us...

1378
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:22,362
we'll stick to the plan,
it'll work.

1379
01:23:22,491 --> 01:23:24,129
Stop crying!
- I can't.

1380
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:25,445
Stop crying, look presentable.

1381
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:27,846
Everyone, look presentable,
this is a bank.

1382
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:33,401
Don't hurt us!

1383
01:23:33,531 --> 01:23:36,409
Lie down, old man,
on the floor.

1384
01:23:36,571 --> 01:23:38,209
Jonathan,
what are you doing here?

1385
01:23:38,531 --> 01:23:39,441
Lie down.

1386
01:23:40,091 --> 01:23:42,446
Kid, come to the safe with me.

1387
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:43,799
You, Hamlet, too.

1388
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,170
Don't move, don't move!

1389
01:23:53,251 --> 01:23:55,446
The security guard's gun is loaded.
Don't hurt the boy.

1390
01:23:55,571 --> 01:23:58,324
Don't hurt him,
he has a wonderful mother.

1391
01:23:58,531 --> 01:23:59,759
The safe.

1392
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:03,609
Don't move. - Lie down, old man.
- Don't move.

1393
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:10,649
I don't know
what came over me.

1394
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:13,360
Suddenly, I was holding a gun.

1395
01:24:15,571 --> 01:24:18,608
Continue as planned.
Tell us to open the safe.

1396
01:24:18,891 --> 01:24:20,370
Open the safe, kid.

1397
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:21,647
Thank you.

1398
01:24:25,371 --> 01:24:26,850
Move it!

1399
01:24:28,251 --> 01:24:29,366
You too!

1400
01:24:35,691 --> 01:24:36,646
It was...

1401
01:24:52,411 --> 01:24:55,687
What's wrong with this?
- It's mechanical, just turn it.

1402
01:24:58,211 --> 01:25:00,361
Let me help you.
- Yes.

1403
01:25:01,251 --> 01:25:02,366
Hold it, please.

1404
01:25:09,051 --> 01:25:11,804
Nick, we have to hurry.
The cops will be here soon.

1405
01:25:11,931 --> 01:25:15,685
Don't do anything!
This is a hostage situation!

1406
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:17,039
He has a bomb!

1407
01:25:17,811 --> 01:25:19,403
Allah Akbar!

1408
01:25:19,771 --> 01:25:21,363
Allah Akbar!

1409
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:24,245
No!

1410
01:25:31,771 --> 01:25:32,681
What did I do?

1411
01:25:33,931 --> 01:25:35,444
You don't know who I am!

1412
01:25:35,571 --> 01:25:37,084
You don't know...
- Stop it!

1413
01:25:38,331 --> 01:25:39,320
Idiot!

1414
01:25:39,491 --> 01:25:40,207
Jonathan...

1415
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:43,120
It's all right, Jonathan,
it's all right.

1416
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:44,240
Vlada, enough.

1417
01:25:44,411 --> 01:25:46,447
Lord Simpson, I'm so sorry.
It's all under control now.

1418
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:47,765
That's perfectly all right.

1419
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:50,280
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1420
01:25:50,531 --> 01:25:52,249
I believe this is yours.

1421
01:25:57,011 --> 01:26:01,801
Simona... I have been
so worried about you.

1422
01:26:01,931 --> 01:26:04,809
Are you all right? - It was horrible.
- Yes, of course.

1423
01:26:04,931 --> 01:26:06,250
There, there, there...

1424
01:26:06,371 --> 01:26:07,804
I'm sure
everything will be well.

1425
01:26:07,931 --> 01:26:10,764
I have to be somewhere now.
Excuse me.

1426
01:26:10,891 --> 01:26:12,961
Oh, would you get my umbrella
and my hat?

1427
01:26:18,931 --> 01:26:21,570
Go home and keep quiet.

1428
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:25,408
They'll keep Nick here
in the senile ward.

1429
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:26,930
Nobody knows
you were involved.

1430
01:26:27,051 --> 01:26:28,609
You'll be fine
if you keep your mouth shut.

1431
01:26:29,211 --> 01:26:30,041
Grandpa,

1432
01:26:31,451 --> 01:26:33,362
my mom wants us
to move in with Dedi.

1433
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:36,687
It's... far away.

1434
01:26:38,531 --> 01:26:40,362
I won't be able to see you
every day.

1435
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:43,406
That's great.

1436
01:26:44,731 --> 01:26:46,449
Dedi has money.

1437
01:26:46,931 --> 01:26:49,081
You'll go to a school for the gifted
like you always wanted.

1438
01:26:49,811 --> 01:26:51,403
I don't really want to.

1439
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:54,484
Why not? You cried like a baby
that you wanted to.

1440
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:57,202
I want to be with you.
- What for?

1441
01:26:57,971 --> 01:27:01,122
What do you want with some old men
who have 5 minutes left to live?

1442
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:04,401
I'd be glad
if you stopped coming.

1443
01:27:04,731 --> 01:27:05,502
Grandpa,

1444
01:27:05,771 --> 01:27:07,443
don't do this to me, not now.

1445
01:27:07,771 --> 01:27:09,966
I know you're not like this.

1446
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:13,442
Don't tell me what I'm like.
What do you know? Spoiled brat...

1447
01:27:14,011 --> 01:27:16,127
You can't go to school
without getting beaten up.

1448
01:27:16,291 --> 01:27:17,804
You're pissed that we blew it.

1449
01:27:17,971 --> 01:27:19,120
That you're too old
to rob a bank,

1450
01:27:19,251 --> 01:27:21,242
that you're useless old fogies.

1451
01:27:21,651 --> 01:27:23,050
I'm too old?

1452
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:26,646
We blew it because of
your stupid plan.

1453
01:27:26,771 --> 01:27:28,409
Listen, you loser,

1454
01:27:28,531 --> 01:27:31,170
you and your wimpy
English genes,

1455
01:27:31,411 --> 01:27:32,730
you're a loser
just like your dad.

1456
01:27:32,851 --> 01:27:35,365
I won't let you argue with me
like you did with Dad.

1457
01:27:35,651 --> 01:27:36,606
What did I do to him?

1458
01:27:38,331 --> 01:27:40,606
You left him at a movie
and went to see another woman.

1459
01:27:40,731 --> 01:27:42,084
He wasn't supposed to see that.

1460
01:27:44,171 --> 01:27:46,162
That dimwit was supposed
to watch the movie.

1461
01:27:47,611 --> 01:27:49,408
But he couldn't stand
being alone for 5 minutes.

1462
01:27:49,531 --> 01:27:51,089
I don't get it,
you love Grandma.

1463
01:27:51,331 --> 01:27:52,730
Nobody loves anyone so much

1464
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:54,887
that they don't want to sleep
with another woman.

1465
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:58,963
You wanted them
to have an abortion.

1466
01:27:59,771 --> 01:28:01,409
You didn't want me.

1467
01:28:01,531 --> 01:28:04,170
Your mother got pregnant
and had my son by the balls.

1468
01:28:04,691 --> 01:28:06,602
He should've done better,
he was a genius

1469
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:08,604
but he threw it all away.

1470
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:11,003
A security guard at a bank.

1471
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:13,485
Who cares about your troubles?

1472
01:28:13,651 --> 01:28:14,561
Do I owe you anything?

1473
01:28:14,891 --> 01:28:17,200
Your mother's spreading her legs
for your sake.

1474
01:28:17,731 --> 01:28:19,722
Maybe she isn't as crazy
as we thought.

1475
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:20,761
Go buy her some flowers.

1476
01:28:21,091 --> 01:28:22,444
Get out of my sight.

1477
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:14,605
Nick.

1478
01:29:15,011 --> 01:29:15,887
Nick.

1479
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:20,764
Jonathan, sonny-boy,
good to see you.

1480
01:29:22,651 --> 01:29:24,960
Was there anything
on the news?

1481
01:29:28,211 --> 01:29:29,530
Where's Grandpa?

1482
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:34,604
Nick, where's Grandpa?

1483
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:40,205
He went to rob the bank,
like in the good old days.

1484
01:29:45,451 --> 01:29:48,204
You walk in with a gun,
fire into the air and yell:

1485
01:29:48,691 --> 01:29:51,330
"A free country for a free people! "
- No!

1486
01:29:51,691 --> 01:29:53,329
No, they'll kill him,

1487
01:29:53,691 --> 01:29:54,726
they'll be waiting for him.

1488
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:58,207
Eliyahu thought of everything,

1489
01:29:58,331 --> 01:30:00,799
he took out life insurance
30 years ago

1490
01:30:01,011 --> 01:30:04,242
and now he listed you as beneficiary
instead of Rhoda.

1491
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:08,849
If anything happens, God forbid,
it's all yours.

1492
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:20,806
Jonathan!

1493
01:30:21,371 --> 01:30:23,327
Hello. Dedi's busy,
he can't see you now.

1494
01:30:28,091 --> 01:30:29,410
What is this?

1495
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,568
Another stick-up?
Twice in a week?

1496
01:30:33,211 --> 01:30:34,883
I'm changing mezuzahs,
what are you doing?

1497
01:30:35,211 --> 01:30:37,247
Eliyahu came into my room,
broke my nose,

1498
01:30:37,611 --> 01:30:39,010
and said, "That's for Dorit."

1499
01:30:40,411 --> 01:30:44,927
Then he smashed
my top row of teeth,

1500
01:30:45,051 --> 01:30:46,279
60,000 shekels' worth.

1501
01:30:46,931 --> 01:30:49,923
He said,
"That's so you'll open the safe."

1502
01:30:51,491 --> 01:30:52,526
What did you do?

1503
01:30:53,211 --> 01:30:54,644
I opened the safe.

1504
01:30:56,971 --> 01:30:59,439
I sued the bank.
I received no damages, no pension.

1505
01:31:01,011 --> 01:31:02,683
I tripped up on the fine print.

1506
01:31:03,811 --> 01:31:05,039
I have a gun here,

1507
01:31:05,211 --> 01:31:07,566
nobody moves or I'll shoot!

1508
01:31:09,251 --> 01:31:11,970
I have a gas can here,
I'll burn the bank down!

1509
01:31:13,571 --> 01:31:15,721
Good thing you're here.
Give me the bag.

1510
01:31:20,971 --> 01:31:21,960
The cameras aren't working,

1511
01:31:22,291 --> 01:31:24,851
nobody will know
you came in or went out.

1512
01:31:28,411 --> 01:31:29,446
Put it in.

1513
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:35,644
I'll help you up.

1514
01:31:37,011 --> 01:31:38,603
I'm staying here,

1515
01:31:39,171 --> 01:31:41,526
Don't worry, those shitheads
won't take me alive.

1516
01:31:42,051 --> 01:31:43,279
Like Kasparov,

1517
01:31:43,651 --> 01:31:46,245
sometimes you sacrifice the king
if you want to win.

1518
01:31:47,171 --> 01:31:48,809
But...

1519
01:31:48,931 --> 01:31:50,364
I don't want you
to die because of me.

1520
01:31:50,491 --> 01:31:51,719
It's enough I killed Dad.

1521
01:31:52,451 --> 01:31:55,090
Shh, kid.
Nobody died because of you.

1522
01:31:55,451 --> 01:31:58,568
I can see you, shitheads!
Don't move or I'll shoot!

1523
01:31:59,771 --> 01:32:01,523
Kids and old people
are transparent.

1524
01:32:02,251 --> 01:32:04,924
Walk out slowly and whistle.

1525
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:06,370
You're coming with me.

1526
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:10,003
All my life
I never did anything right,

1527
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:13,125
not as a father,
not as a husband.

1528
01:32:13,851 --> 01:32:18,606
I didn't even have the guts
to kill Rhoda when I should have.

1529
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:24,883
Now I have a chance
to be a grandfather,

1530
01:32:25,491 --> 01:32:27,004
your grandfather.

1531
01:32:28,531 --> 01:32:30,567
Take the money, Jonathan,

1532
01:32:30,691 --> 01:32:33,683
go, go, my boy, go.

1533
01:32:39,811 --> 01:32:42,166
Go, it's okay. Go.

1534
01:32:42,931 --> 01:32:44,967
Go, run.

1535
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:48,160
Run! Go! Go!

1536
01:33:11,331 --> 01:33:14,721
I have a gun!
Stay away or I'll shoot!

1537
01:33:48,211 --> 01:33:49,803
Duke...
- Grandpa is hurt.

1538
01:33:49,971 --> 01:33:51,450
Duke, what happened
in the bank?

1539
01:33:52,731 --> 01:33:55,370
We did it. I got the money.

1540
01:33:57,491 --> 01:34:00,403
Look, we're attracting attention. We've
got to get away from here. Come on.

1541
01:34:00,531 --> 01:34:03,603
No. I... I have to go back
to save Grandpa.

1542
01:34:03,731 --> 01:34:04,720
You can't go back.

1543
01:34:05,171 --> 01:34:07,321
I have to. He's dying there.

1544
01:34:08,571 --> 01:34:11,643
Duke, your grandfather
sacrificed himself for you.

1545
01:34:12,891 --> 01:34:16,520
You can't give the money back.
You'd be better off burning it.

1546
01:34:19,691 --> 01:34:21,886
Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

1547
01:34:26,011 --> 01:34:27,160
Samoha, do me a favor.
- Don't shoot!

1548
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:28,610
I'll get him out.

1549
01:34:28,731 --> 01:34:30,722
My grandfather's in there.
Call an ambulance.

1550
01:34:30,851 --> 01:34:31,761
Kid!

1551
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:28,485
He's burning the money.

1552
01:35:28,811 --> 01:35:30,403
Shit, he's burning the money,

1553
01:35:30,571 --> 01:35:31,640
who burns money?

1554
01:35:33,331 --> 01:35:34,525
Who burns money?!

1555
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:38,920
Jonathan went through
a traumatic experience.

1556
01:35:39,691 --> 01:35:42,763
His grandfather has Alzheimer's
and exhibited violent behavior

1557
01:35:43,091 --> 01:35:44,763
which Jonathan witnessed.

1558
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:47,964
Please give him
the respect he deserves

1559
01:35:48,531 --> 01:35:50,442
and be kind to your friend

1560
01:35:50,651 --> 01:35:55,167
who bravely tried to stop
a bank robbery.

1561
01:35:56,611 --> 01:35:58,124
I see the MP3 still records.

1562
01:35:58,571 --> 01:36:00,482
It doesn't work,
it just lights up.

1563
01:36:00,651 --> 01:36:02,164
You know he flunked twice?

1564
01:36:02,291 --> 01:36:05,089
Son, you have to get along
with people less smarter than you.

1565
01:36:05,211 --> 01:36:08,283
You have enough problems
as it is.

1566
01:36:08,451 --> 01:36:09,361
I don't...

1567
01:36:09,811 --> 01:36:11,529
I don't stutter like I used to.

1568
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:15,205
Nick, what's she thinking about?

1569
01:36:22,371 --> 01:36:24,441
She's a nymphomaniac,

1570
01:36:25,091 --> 01:36:26,922
she hasn't had any
since last night,

1571
01:36:27,051 --> 01:36:30,600
it's driving her nuts
and she wants more and more,

1572
01:36:31,331 --> 01:36:32,844
and now she's here all alone

1573
01:36:33,891 --> 01:36:35,449
and she's horny as hell

1574
01:36:36,371 --> 01:36:38,043
and she needs...

1575
01:36:38,211 --> 01:36:41,886
Eliyahu's crank.

1576
01:37:29,571 --> 01:37:32,881
I think my bank robber came

1577
01:37:33,571 --> 01:37:35,448
just a little ahead of my Oliver Twist.

1578
01:37:36,491 --> 01:37:39,528
I was there,
I was in the moment.

1579
01:37:39,691 --> 01:37:41,682
You wrote a play
about the bank robbery,

1580
01:37:41,811 --> 01:37:44,041
and in that play
the boy and your character

1581
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:45,963
didn't burn most of the money.

1582
01:37:46,131 --> 01:37:47,405
Is this what happened
in real life?

1583
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:48,765
Absolutely not.

1584
01:37:48,891 --> 01:37:51,928
No, I deny that totally.

1585
01:37:52,091 --> 01:37:53,570
That was all fiction.

1586
01:37:53,771 --> 01:37:55,727
The bank manager Dedi,
before he was fired,

1587
01:37:56,291 --> 01:38:00,204
also claimed that he doesn't think
that you burned most of the money,

1588
01:38:00,331 --> 01:38:01,559
but the cops didn't believe him.

1589
01:38:01,691 --> 01:38:04,489
No, no.
Anyway, I have Alzheimer's.

1590
01:38:17,451 --> 01:38:20,887
You can't give the money back.
You'd be better off burning it.

1591
01:38:22,251 --> 01:38:24,401
Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

1592
01:38:32,851 --> 01:38:34,682
We'll just burn 15 percent.

1593
01:38:35,411 --> 01:38:37,288
I'm used to it. I have an agent.

1594
01:39:41,691 --> 01:39:43,409
Nick, wake up,
I know you're not in a coma.

1595
01:39:47,051 --> 01:39:48,200
Well, I tried.

1596
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:57,769
