1
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,681
<i>Winning this case--</i>
<i>it's a real victory, Sabrina.</i>

2
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,280
<i>You ain't got</i>
<i>to tell me that, Mr. Riddles.</i>

3
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,451
I know.

4
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,461
Man.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

5
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,521
There's a lot of young people
going to prison these days.

6
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,157
Some of 'em need to be there.

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,827
Some of 'em don't.

8
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,104
It's-- it's the background story
that's the real winner.

9
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,337
That's what everybody's
gonna want to hear.

10
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,381
Prison ain't no joke, though.

11
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,940
Want to know how I know?
'Cause I been in and out of jail

12
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,578
since I was 15 years old.

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,386
But there ain't <i>nothing</i> like
the experience I had at Whitehead.

14
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,324
I know what you want,

15
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,987
but I'm gonna tell you
the story my way.

16
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,587
I lived this.

17
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,895
Being in this motherfucker
changed my life.

18
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,697
<i>Damn,</i>
<i>look at my nails.</i>

19
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,037
<i>You know I gets my shit done</i>
<i>every week.</i>

20
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,542
Don't play.

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,044
Damn. Shit, bitch,
you need to be looking at that hair.

22
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,808
Fuck you, fuck y'all.

23
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,907
First of all,
y'all motherfuckers is crazy,

24
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,817
'cause you ain't gonna be getting
that shit done no time soon.

25
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,481
Nails, hair, toes--
none of that shit.

26
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,218
You gonna be scraping them
up against the wall and shit.

27
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,920
What did y'all--
y'all niggas kill somebody?

28
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,622
<i>- Hell yeah.</i>
<i>- I went and shot him.</i>

29
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,687
Hell no, I ain't
killed me nobody.

30
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,700
They got the wrong motherfucker.
They got the wrong Sabrina Downs.

31
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,703
It could be like 13 of me
in the whole fucking world.

32
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,705
There's a bunch of motherfuckers
in America.

33
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,607
I know motherfuckers light-skinned
and wear braids and shit like me.

34
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,440
Everybody want to put
me in jail.

35
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,044
Bitch, I will jump over this
motherfucker and choke your ass.

36
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,675
- What's up?
- Bitch, oh my--

37
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,982
wait till we get to the prison.
You just wait.

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,614
- You ain't gonna do shit.
- She says she ain't killed nobody.

39
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,352
Y'all want to be innocent ass?
You ain't done shit either, bitch.

40
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,054
You picking some cotton
some-motherfucking-where

41
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,859
<i>and got in trouble.</i>
<i>You just here 'cause...</i>

42
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,765
<i>they want your ass here.</i>
<i>You ain't special.</i>

43
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,545
Hey, if you, like,
hold your arms back...

44
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,310
God, girl.

45
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,789
Thanks.

46
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,814
It's cool.

47
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,555
And that's how I met
Frances Shepard.

48
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,870
Officer:
From this moment on,

49
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,176
you're the property of the Whitehead
Correctional Institution.

50
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,978
My name is Captain Alan Dease.

51
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,215
Remember my name,
and I promise you

52
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,620
you will never forget
my face.

53
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,624
All right, ladies,
listen up.

54
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,922
You will not be able
to eat, sleep,

55
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,556
or go to the bathroom...

56
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,589
without permission.

57
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,795
And I'm gonna say this once

58
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,269
and only once--

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,336
carry your prison ID
with you at all times.

60
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:08,871
Failure to do so will result
in disciplinary action.

61
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,951
You shall not engage
in gambling,

62
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:16,445
substance abuse,
or illegal sexual acts.

63
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,514
<i>Tom Nelson</i>
<i>was the warden, right?</i>

64
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,050
But that asshole Dease?
He ran the prison.

65
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,029
You shall not
engage in business

66
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,860
or commerce of any type.

67
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:29,129
He's seen, like, four or five
wardens come and go.

68
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,170
He been there
for a long time.

69
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,638
That nigga felt like
everything was his,

70
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,267
from the fucking roof
to the rats.

71
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,904
You will not destroy
or misuse state property.

72
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,244
Dease? Asshole.

73
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,772
For sure.

74
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,909
Any acts...

75
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,113
of insurrection

76
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,384
or insubordination

77
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,052
will result
in disciplinary action.

78
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,560
Do you understand?

79
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,120
- Yes, sir.
- Do you understand?!

80
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,927
Yes, sir!

81
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,766
Good.

82
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,471
Good, ladies.

83
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,531
<i>We was, like, his girls</i>

84
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,667
<i>living in his</i>
<i>motherfucking house.</i>

85
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,109
It was real fucked up.

86
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,298
- Turn off the damn music.

87
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,394
<i>Now Frances was different</i>
<i>than the rest of us.</i>

88
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,165
New inmate on the block.

89
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,468
<i>She had never</i>
<i>been in jail before.</i>

90
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,975
<i>Neither has Lil' Mama--</i>

91
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,979
<i>17, pregnant,</i>
<i>and our resident preacher.</i>

92
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,109
Nikki, this here is Frances Shepard.
Lock her in to the day-to-day.

93
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,618
- I don't want her in here.
- You don't have a choice.

94
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,486
All she gonna learn from me
is how to be an insubordinate.

95
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,353
- Right.

96
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,391
<i>I hope you'll be comfortable.</i>
<i>You can put your stuff up there.</i>

97
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,265
Maybe I'll help you make your bed
later. Clear out some space.

98
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:25,245
Look, I know how you feel.
It just takes time.

99
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,082
Here, let me tell you
who everybody is.

100
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,611
<i>That right there,</i>
<i>that's Nikki.</i>

101
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,988
Don't nobody mess with her. She's
been in and out of here two times.

102
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,653
Everybody here's scared of her
except me.

103
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,562
We get along.
Now it's a little cold in here.

104
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,795
They don't give us no heat, so you
might want to dress up a little bit

105
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,996
- so you don't get sick, okay?
- Frances. How you doing? I'm Wet.

106
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,938
Come on out of that cell, girl.
You gonna spend enough time there.

107
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,306
Enough time to make you
go crazy.

108
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,243
Now this here's
kinda like the block.

109
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,803
You got to be careful
who you run with.

110
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,941
See them girls right there?
That's the Nikki Nikki crew.

111
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,975
Now if that's your thing,
it's cool with us.

112
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,546
Them girls right there--
that's the Hotep Girls.

113
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,420
<i>- Hotep!?</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

114
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,120
That's my click.
It's our job to wake everybody up.

115
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,062
<i>Shut the fuck up and leave</i>
<i>that new bitch alone!</i>

116
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,088
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

117
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,692
You see what I'm saying?
"Sleep-itude."

118
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,668
What you up in here for?

119
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,637
- Murder.
- Murder?

120
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,640
<i>Don't look like a murderer.</i>

121
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,676
Look like a high-yellow
"saditty" bitch to me.

122
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,578
Now look, Frances,
we get up every morning at 5:30.

123
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,980
- Then we got shower time--
- No, Lil' Mama. Fuck that.

124
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,145
What she need to know is how they
terrorize us in this motherfucker.

125
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,848
You gotta protect yourself.

126
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,446
I didn't do anything.

127
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,515
It don't matter.

128
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,050
I got this here petition
that I need you to sign.

129
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,688
I'm trying to get everybody
to sign it, actually.

130
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,357
- Where my pen?

131
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,390
<i>- Lockdown, two minutes.</i>
- Okay.

132
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,732
<i>- Two minutes to lockdown.</i>
- All right, y'all.

133
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,899
Come on.
See you later, Wet.

134
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,305
All right, Frances.

135
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:13,249
They can't pay me enough to work
in this raggedy motherfucker.

136
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,655
Shit is crazy. You know Yvette
got bit by a rat the other night?

137
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,999
- For real?
<i>- What?</i>

138
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,504
Keep down about it. You don't want
to give 'em no reason

139
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,302
<i>to throw us in lockdown.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

140
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,708
Lockdown?
That shit ain't never gonna happen.

141
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,770
- Slow down their productivity.

142
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,544
That's right. We gotta keep
the cash flowing.

143
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,813
Frances, let me let you in
on what's going on.

144
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,980
Saturday, we're in the sweat shop
all day until 12:00 noon.

145
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,320
Then it's hour in the yard,
then it's chow,

146
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,519
then it's back to cleaning up,
unloading the truck,

147
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,824
<i>helping with dinner.</i>
<i>We only get an hour on the phone.</i>

148
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,626
We only get paid $1.50 a day.
I know it don't sound right,

149
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,099
- but that's the way it is.
- No, that can't be right.

150
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,829
- That's illegal.
- Hell no, that shit ain't legal.

151
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,270
- Slave-driving motherfuckers.

152
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,605
All right, ladies,
time to earn your keep.

153
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,639
Welcome to the plantation,
Sister Frances.

154
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,405
So Frances,
what happened with you?

155
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,440
How'd you get in here?

156
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,671
I killed my husband,
but it was an accident.

157
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,509
Oh really?

158
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,983
Huh. I killed my stepfather,
but it wasn't no accident.

159
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,382
You got any kids?

160
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,515
Yeah, I have one.
Look.

161
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,424
- Oh, you got a locket.
- Her name is Maxine.

162
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,294
She has asthma.
I worry about her so much.

163
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,162
She's cute.

164
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,894
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

165
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,902
Everybody got kids in here.

166
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,235
Nikki got kids.
Twin boys ain't with their mama.

167
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,434
Wet got two kids too.

168
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:13,343
But they got
taken away from her.

169
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,780
Girl, just get ready,
'cause Mother's Day,

170
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,148
it's tough in here.

171
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,621
<i>Mm-mmm. See, I'm getting my appeal,</i>
<i>and I'll be outta here.</i>

172
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,556
Oh really?
I'm getting outta here too.

173
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,218
<i>Oh yeah? When?</i>

174
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,456
In about... five years.

175
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,691
<i>Five years?</i>
<i>Damn.</i>

176
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,065
Yeah, five years.

177
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,208
Don't bullshit me.

178
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,304
- Excuse me, Captain Dease?
- Yeah.

179
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,111
Hi, I'm Michael Meadows.

180
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,277
Let me call you back.

181
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,412
That supposed to mean
something to me, son?

182
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,547
I'm the new correction officer.

183
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,717
I'm supposed to be starting
on Wednesday.

184
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,920
What are you
doing here now?

185
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,987
The warden said I should,
you know, just come by,

186
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,965
say hello, introduce myself.

187
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,660
Yeah, you the new
college boy, huh?

188
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,191
- Yeah.
- Hi, good to meet you.

189
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,736
Good to meet you too.

190
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,797
Can't you think of something
better to do than corrections, son?

191
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,473
I mean, well,
to be honest with you,

192
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,980
- I need the money for tuition.
- You need the money?

193
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,504
- Yeah.
- Everybody needs money.

194
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,346
I can understand that.
I'm not mad at you.

195
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,477
Don't worry about it.
We got this. We got this.

196
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,988
We got this.
We got this.

197
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,118
She says, <i>"We got this.</i>
<i>We got this."</i>

198
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,890
Pull up a chair.
Let's talk.

199
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,260
Okay.

200
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,356
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

201
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,527
You know, I'm postgrad.
I'm a law major.

202
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,935
Criminal law.
I guess help people.

203
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,099
$5 say you don't got this.

204
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,904
<i>Now that's Aisha.</i>

205
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,036
<i>That's Dease's latest</i>
<i>piece of pussy.</i>

206
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,639
<i>Whatever she see,</i>
<i>she run and tell his ass.</i>

207
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:59,412
Aisha, you ain't
ass betting, are you? Huh?

208
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,443
Let Lil' Mama
hold the money. Lil' Mama?

209
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,352
Wait, wait-- hold up.
Hold up.

210
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,516
Why Lil' Mama gotta be
holding the money?

211
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,288
- Why not?
- 'Cause she a Godfearing woman.

212
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,761
God bless and keep you, Wet.

213
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,162
Fuck am I, a church?
Here. Whatever.

214
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,689
My father and uh--

215
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,828
<i>Your father and Nelson</i>
<i>go way back?</i>

216
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,201
Yeah, they went
to school together.

217
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,831
I'm an only child.

218
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,172
My parents are only children too,
so it's just pretty much us.

219
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,339
I'll-- I'll trim it down.

220
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,940
Stop your jackin' and serve!

221
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,541
- What?
<i>- Come on, now.</i>

222
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,585
All right, I'm gonna serve.

223
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,683
- Fuck is wrong with you?!

224
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,843
Go for Dease.

225
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,935
Guard:
<i>There's a fight in the yard, sir.</i>

226
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,708
Lock 'em down.
I'm on my way.

227
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,944
Let's go, son.
Your orientation starts now.

228
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,887
You ain't bad, bitch.
We could go some more.

229
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:15,553
<i>- We could go some more.</i>
- Stop it, God damn it! Stop it!

230
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,530
- Who started this?!
<i>- She did!</i>

231
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,225
<i>You're a lying bitch!</i>
<i>She started it!</i>

232
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,393
<i>- Shut it up!</i>
- Aisha hit her with the ball.

233
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,959
Shut the fuck up, Wet.
I'm not talking to you.

234
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,268
Shepard, who started this?

235
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,572
You better answer me,
God damn it.

236
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,443
- That one. She did.
<i>- What?!</i>

237
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
All right, take these women
back to their units.

238
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,907
Come on! Move it!

239
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,943
Escort Miss Nance
back to her unit.

240
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,751
<i>All right, man, all right. Damn.</i>

241
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,520
You heard her.
I didn't do nothing.

242
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,620
Shut your ass.
That's for me to decide.

243
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,496
<i>All right, you heard him.</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

244
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,935
These inmates
are worse than animals.

245
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,998
They need discipline
and they need structure.

246
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,202
Especially that
little bitch Barnes.

247
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,678
I'm the only one in here
that can discipline her.

248
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,171
Gets on my fucking nerves.

249
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,777
You know,
it's kinda funny.

250
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,018
She's got this stupid
little crush on me.

251
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,026
You saw the way she was
looking at me, didn't you?

252
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,687
- Yeah.
- Did you see?

253
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,787
- Yeah, yeah.

254
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,355
She gets upset if I don't
giver her enough attention.

255
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,890
- You know how young girls are.
- Yeah.

256
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,836
You're gonna do a great job.
I want you to remember this--

257
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,399
the warden may have hired you--

258
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,912
you got a problem, I'm the first
and the last person you talk to.

259
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,245
I run this motherfucking prison,
not Nelson.

260
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,581
Don't you ever forget that.
You got me?

261
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,746
- Yeah.
- Speaking of the devil,

262
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,755
here comes the warden now.
Mr. Warden.

263
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,484
- Hey.
<i>- Mr. Nelson, how are you?</i>

264
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,719
Good to see you.

265
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,196
- Good to see you.
- All right. Same here.

266
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,562
- How you doing?
- All right. You've grown up, man.

267
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,193
Yeah. I just wanted to say
thank you once again.

268
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,032
- I appreciate it.
- Nothing to it.

269
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,937
Listen, if it gets a little rough
out here, make sure you let me know.

270
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,941
You can always work
in the office with me.

271
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,704
- Okay.
- You pick up your uniform?

272
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,712
No, actually I'm about
to go do that right now.

273
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,543
All right, good.
Good, go ahead.

274
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,243
Dease, you take care of him.
'Cause his people and my people

275
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,876
go way back.

276
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,513
I'm sure he's gonna
work out just fine.

277
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,351
- All right.
- Mr. Nelson, good to see you.

278
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,688
- Take care.
- Mr. Dease.

279
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,716
- I got great news.
- What's going on?

280
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,889
Wall Corp. People are coming.
Get your people up to speed.

281
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,058
They were just here.

282
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,260
I thought everything
checked out okay?

283
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,530
We did, but the Edgehill
facility didn't.

284
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,973
Wall Corp. Is thinking about pulling
their business from them.

285
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:47,138
And if that happens, it'll keep
the state from closing us down.

286
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,704
I see.
I like that.

287
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,874
That's cool.

288
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,248
Also, Wall Corp. Is thinking
about remodeling--

289
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,085
<i>Now most people don't know</i>
<i>that prison is big business.</i>

290
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,352
<i>Everybody was trying</i>
<i>to make a buck--</i>

291
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,916
<i>legal or otherwise.</i>

292
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,863
Nothing will change
but the size of our paychecks, baby.

293
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,661
- I like the sound of that.
- Yeah.

294
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,324
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

295
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,199
- How's it going?
- Fine.

296
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:16,173
I thought I told you
not to call me that. Hmm?

297
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,176
I just wanted
to thank you

298
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,179
for checking Nikki
at the volleyball game.

299
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,205
You know, letting her know
who's important around here.

300
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,739
Come here and let me
talk to you.

301
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,649
Okay.

302
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,655
- You miss me?
- Of course I do.

303
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,954
I miss you too.

304
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,995
You stupid fucking bitch.

305
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,801
You ain't important.
Don't you ever think that you are.

306
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,362
- You understand me?
- Mmm.

307
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,070
- Yes, Captain.
- I can't hear you.

308
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,103
Yes, Captain.

309
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,785
Good, baby.

310
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,847
Now...

311
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,381
you got some information
for me?

312
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,690
No, I haven't heard nothing.

313
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,060
No?

314
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,198
No, no, no, no, no.

315
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,397
Not until
you bring me something.

316
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,477
<i>I'll come back</i>
<i>when I have something.</i>

317
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,641
Aren't you forgetting something,
baby girl?

318
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:34,049
<i>I don't know. Am I?</i>

319
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,954
You forgot to thank me.

320
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,319
Hold on a second.

321
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,229
Now you see me...

322
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,256
Now you don't.

323
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,086
- This is Dease.
<i>- Yo, big dog, what's up, man?</i>

324
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,320
- What's going on, Fred?
<i>- Nothing...</i>

325
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,469
Fuck him.

326
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,336
Ohh!

327
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,843
No!

328
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,847
Keep your motherfucking
mouth shut, ho!

329
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,147
Keep fucking with me.
Keep fucking with me, bitch.

330
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,154
Watch your motherfucking mouth--

331
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,516
Fucking bitch.

332
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,026
Gimme that.

333
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,258
Game over.

334
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,792
- Fuck.
- You lose, bitch.

335
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,395
Help! Help!

336
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,909
Fuck! I'm gonna get you, Nikki,
I swear!

337
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,550
Oh!

338
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,109
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, I'm sorry.

339
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,486
It's a coed locker room,
you know.

340
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,151
- Yeah.
- Not much you can do about it.

341
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,490
I forgot about that.

342
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:27,022
- How you doing?
- I'm doing pretty good.

343
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,733
<i>I guess you're doing fine.</i>

344
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,496
<i>Now Cervantes,</i>

345
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,006
<i>she was a cold-blooded</i>
<i>rules-and-regulations-type bitch.</i>

346
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,440
And I came out okay.

347
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,674
To tell you the truth, I don't think
the whole law enforcement thing

348
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,546
is, you know, for me.

349
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,746
I hope that's not an insult,
only because my family

350
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,277
- is rooted in law enforcement.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

351
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,519
We would try to, like, talk to her
about our problems sometimes,

352
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,357
but she was too busy trying
to earn stripes with the warden

353
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,922
hollering at all the new
male guards. 'Sup with that?

354
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:04,061
- I didn't take it as a dis...
- Okay, cool. Cool.

355
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:08,368
Maybe we can got to lunch
or something. You can explain.

356
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,843
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow, yeah.

357
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,539
That would be--
that would be dope.

358
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,744
I really wish I could.
I got study hall after this.

359
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,550
It's cool. Maybe--
maybe sometime in the future

360
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:27,150
we'll have a chance to talk
and I can change your mind

361
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,422
about law enforcement.

362
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,022
O-okay. All right, then.

363
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,623
- Good.
- All right.

364
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,725
Okay.
You take care.

365
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,066
- You too, Cervantes.
- All right now.

366
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,512
Why's she taking
so long on the phone?

367
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,674
Leave her alone.
She talking to her hairdresser.

368
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,980
Bitch ain't got but one friend.

369
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,044
Hurry the fuck on!
I got things to do!

370
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,056
And you got 10 years to do it.

371
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,557
Can you say "appeal"?

372
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,617
Can I say, "In 10 years
your ass gonna be up in here"?

373
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,959
Now you gonna be
up in here.

374
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,591
- I'm a convict. What you want?
- Frances Shepard?

375
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,567
The warden needs to see you.

376
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,603
Oh, come on.
I got to use the phone.

377
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,832
He said that we need
to leave right away.

378
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,479
<i>You know, Shepard,</i>

379
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,280
<i>you'd get along much better if you'd</i>
<i>learn to speak up in here.</i>

380
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,755
Who knows, you might become
a trustee one day.

381
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,059
- Captain.
- How are you, sir?

382
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,789
Shepard?

383
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,726
What happened to your face?

384
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,135
- Nothing.
- Just a few questions.

385
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,970
Did you see who stabbed
Aisha Nance?

386
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,498
No, sir, I didn't.

387
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,976
But you were in the area
where the stabbing occurred.

388
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,537
Yes, sir, I admit
I saw Aisha.

389
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,674
But it was after I came out
of the bathroom.

390
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,913
- Did you hear anything?
- No, sir.

391
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,787
Do you have someplace to be?

392
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,555
I don't want to miss
my phone time.

393
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,363
All right, you can go.

394
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,404
- That's all. Thank you.
- Thank you.

395
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,736
Nobody's talking.
We're wasting time.

396
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,972
She knows
what happened, sir.

397
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,481
Like me to lock
the unit down, sir?

398
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,040
Damn it, Dease, no,
we can't lock the unit down.

399
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,713
- We got to keep everybody working.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

400
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,387
I don't want to rush you. Try to
make this as quick as you can.

401
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,698
<i>How's Michael?</i>
<i>How's he doing?</i>

402
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,738
He's doing okay, sir.

403
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,933
I mean, I prefer a military
trained person.

404
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,305
They're more dependable.

405
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,039
College boys are a little
too soft for me.

406
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,774
I went to college, Dease.

407
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,343
Are you trying to say
I'm too soft?

408
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,981
No, sir.

409
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,489
No, sir.

410
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,084
Keep sharp, baby.

411
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,266
<i>How's mommy's big girl?</i>

412
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,331
<i>Mommy, I want to see you, Mommy.</i>

413
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,340
I want to see you, too.

414
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,443
Are you doing what Auntie Kim
tells you to?

415
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,679
<i>Yes.</i>

416
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,213
<i>Why can't I see you?</i>

417
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,327
<i>Mommy, I want to see you.</i>

418
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,559
<i>This is the telephone observer.</i>
<i>Your call time has expired.</i>

419
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,089
<i>- Mommy--</i>
- Baby, it was--

420
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,252
You all right, Ms. Shepard?

421
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,316
No.

422
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,821
Your daughter's all right?
Everything okay with your daughter?

423
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,161
No.

424
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,258
I hope I didn't get you
in trouble.

425
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,701
- No, no.
- Thanks.

426
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,228
It's okay.

427
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,104
We should probably just go.

428
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,951
<i>Okay, any spade that you</i>
<i>have can cut through a suit.</i>

429
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,924
<i>And the higher the spade,</i>
<i>the better the cut.</i>

430
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,055
You think Frances
said something to Nelson?

431
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,296
They ain't hauling me off
to solitary.

432
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,633
And we ain't on lockdown,
are we?

433
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:10,163
No, she ain't say nothing.
She better not.

434
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,973
Frances ain't even
that kind of person.

435
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:18,278
Lil' Mama, ain't you got some
scripture reading or something?

436
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:28,288
- I like Rodney Dangerfield myself.

437
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,227
He's got all those fat jokes.

438
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,662
"How can you tell when your--

439
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,722
when your wife gets too fat?"

440
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,097
I don't know.

441
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,829
"When she sits on your face
and you can't hear the stereo."

442
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,202
- Hey, Nikki!

443
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,969
- Wake up, baby.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

444
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,001
I know you stabbed Aisha, Nikki.
But if you be sweet to me...

445
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,071
<i>- I'm gonna be sweet to you.</i>
<i>- No! Leave me alone!</i>

446
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,083
<i>All right, all right,</i>
<i>you little bitch!</i>

447
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,108
<i>Come here, you little bitch!</i>
<i>I'm gonna beat...</i>

448
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,586
Nikki's beating wasn't
about no Aisha.

449
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,715
It was about Dease and Nikki.

450
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,692
They say Dease
was crazy about her.

451
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,694
But she hated
that nigga's guts.

452
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,425
So he would do stuff like
single her and her group out

453
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,161
and act like he was making
examples out of them.

454
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,068
Yeah, right.
Everybody knew what was up.

455
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,732
Ain't no secrets in jail.

456
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,902
<i># There were no mirrors</i>
<i>in my nana's house #</i>

457
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,178
<i># No mirrors in my nana's house #</i>

458
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,583
<i># There were no mirrors</i>
<i>in my nana's house #</i>

459
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,885
<i># No mirrors in my nana's house #</i>

460
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,415
<i># And the beauty that I saw</i>
<i>in everything #</i>

461
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,190
<i># The beauty in everything, yeah #</i>

462
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,060
<i># Was in her eyes #</i>

463
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:44,262
<i># Ohh, was in her eyes #</i>

464
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:48,397
<i># I'm telling you, there were</i>
<i>no mirrors in my nana's house. #</i>

465
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,042
<i>You see me with a fat lady,</i>
<i>I'm holding her for the police.</i>

466
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,569
- What's up, Captain?
- What's going on, Banks?

467
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,081
I'll see y'all later.

468
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,879
My friend's wife was so fat,
you tell her to haul ass

469
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,251
she got to make two trips.

470
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,983
What you got, Banks?

471
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,184
Got something good for me?

472
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,785
Oh my goodness, homemade
macaroni and cheese.

473
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,763
Let me get a little shot
of that, buddy.

474
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,321
Mm-hmm.
Woo, Lordy.

475
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,664
Don't you ever get tired
of grubbing off me?

476
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,135
No, sir.
Quit your bitchin' about it, Banks.

477
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,298
You got seven mouths to feed.
One more ain't gonna hurt you none.

478
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,638
No, my wife's
pregnant again.

479
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,371
Get the fuck outta here.

480
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,572
Don't you white boys
believe in birth control?

481
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,041
College boy,
what's going on?

482
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,315
How you doing?
I brought some drinks and stuff.

483
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,515
Good, put 'em right over there.

484
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,650
Uh, just to give you
a heads up,

485
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:45,060
the toilets and stuff on block four,
they're still stopped up.

486
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:48,224
It's starting to smell
pretty bad up there.

487
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:52,896
That's good. Might offset the smell
of some of them stink-ass bitches.

488
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,837
Everything's broke. Won't be long
before the state closes us down.

489
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,640
I'm already looking
for a job.

490
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,477
Don't be no fool.
You know what I know,

491
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,574
you'll keep your ass
right here.

492
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:09,053
If it's about Wall Corp.,
I'm still looking for a job.

493
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,385
I'm gonna tell you
what the problem is.

494
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,688
It's these soft young boys
coming in here--

495
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,889
got personal contacts.
Taking everybody's jobs.

496
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,592
- Ain't that right, Michael?
- You ain't in the union?

497
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,863
<i>I just told you he was</i>
<i>a college boy.</i>

498
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:26,665
Him and Nelson
go way back.

499
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,763
Ain't that right, Michael?

500
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,536
Everybody in this shithole
will be untrained.

501
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:35,205
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna look out for our crew.

502
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,511
You just try to make
that meeting next Friday.

503
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,984
I'll be there
'cause I got mouths to feed.

504
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,182
- I <i>need</i> my job.
- I feel ya. I need the job too.

505
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,056
That's why I'm here. I ain't got
no kids or nothing like that.

506
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,620
I'm in school, I got tuition to pay.
I got loans, you know?

507
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,494
I ain't trying
to take nobody's job.

508
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,091
I'm just trying to get a dollar
like everybody else.

509
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,159
To tell you the truth, I didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

510
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,297
What did you expect, "Oz"?

511
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,206
No, no, I didn't
expect "Oz." No.

512
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,576
But you know,
it's rough sometimes, man.

513
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,776
It gets rough, the way the women
get treated sometimes.

514
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,785
"Way these women get treated"?
What the fuck are you talking about?

515
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,980
- Nothing, I'm just--
- What are you talking about?!

516
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,512
These women are thieves,
murders, drug addicts--

517
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,957
they don't have respect
for a goddamn thing!

518
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,723
The only remedy is locking them up
and throwing away the key.

519
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,754
If by chance they do
get out of here,

520
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,199
they gonna pray on their knees
never to get back in here again!

521
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,198
Jesus Christ. What fucking boat
did you jump off of?

522
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,807
I got to get back
to work.

523
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,011
I'll see you later, Banks.
Let me tell you something else--

524
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,678
you're working a double shift
next week.

525
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,450
You got me?

526
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,458
Might help you earn some
of that extra money you need...

527
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,585
college boy.

528
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,903
I didn't know I was
in the goddamn army.

529
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,040
- 17 years in this place.
- Yeah?

530
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:21,142
If it's doing that to him, he needs
to think about a career change.

531
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,646
<i>Now Michael</i>
<i>may have been in college,</i>

532
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,811
<i>but his real education came when</i>
<i>he started working in the prison.</i>

533
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,984
<i>He thought it was all</i>
<i>about rehabilitation.</i>

534
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,851
<i>When Michael got going</i>
<i>with his research,</i>

535
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,829
<i>he uncovered a lot of shit.</i>

536
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,924
<i>Found out that we were high-priced</i>
<i>stock down on Wall Street.</i>

537
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,230
<i>Everybody was making money</i>
<i>off our asses.</i>

538
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:14,430
<i>We were sewing ski coats</i>
<i>for $1.50 a day</i>

539
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:18,407
<i>that some woman in France would be</i>
<i>paying like $1000 for next month.</i>

540
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,612
<i>Lil' Mama, what's wrong?</i>

541
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,843
- Oh, Frances, the baby!
- I'm right here.

542
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,647
<i>Oh shit.</i>

543
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,284
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Don't try to get up.</i>

544
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,316
Lay like that.
It's okay.

545
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,555
<i>No.</i>

546
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,326
<i>Lil' Mama's sick!</i>
<i>Somebody get a doctor!</i>

547
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,357
- What's going on?
- Guard!

548
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,370
We have a right
to see a doctor!

549
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,428
Guard, emergency!

550
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,475
- We need help!
- Where's the guard?

551
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,443
My God!

552
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,037
Don't let nothing
happen to her.

553
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,380
Lil' Mama, just breathe.
Relax. It's going to be okay.

554
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,516
- Thank God.
<i>- How's she doing?</i>

555
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,389
Lil' Mama,
you have to rest.

556
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,021
<i>Frances, is she bleeding?</i>

557
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,964
No blood...
thank God.

558
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,469
<i>Hey, "Saditty."</i>

559
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,172
Lil' Mama says
you killed your old man.

560
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,976
I didn't mean to.

561
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,951
I just wanted to get him
off me,

562
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,886
<i>stop all the hitting</i>
<i>and the beating.</i>

563
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,183
So you're innocent.

564
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,553
I think so.

565
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,615
That shit is crazy.
He's beating your ass

566
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,059
and you're supposed to just
lay there and take it

567
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,585
and not defend yourself?

568
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,563
Sounds like you should've
been my lawyer.

569
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,327
No, I should've been
your lawyer.

570
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,665
Matter of fact,
I'd've been a great lawyer.

571
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,671
- What you in here for, Wet?
- Something stupid.

572
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,037
Shot a track star
in the calf.

573
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:33,237
With a.38 no less,
and a dozen people watching.

574
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,303
Bet she won't be fucking with
nobody else's man, right, Wet?

575
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,283
No, she won't. She won't be running
any more races, either.

576
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,481
I feel bad about that.

577
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,150
Stupid shit, you know?

578
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,352
Yeah, I know.

579
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,675
<i>I'm tired.</i>

580
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,150
<i>Hourly quotas</i>
<i>standard 20 pieces on schedule.</i>

581
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,812
<i>Pick up four more pieces.</i>

582
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:19,016
How come you ain't tell
nobody you were a nurse?

583
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,582
'Cause didn't nobody
ask me.

584
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,430
Thanks for helping
with Lil' Mama last night.

585
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,025
That was nice of you.

586
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,468
You didn't have to do nothing,
and you did.

587
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,337
You're all right with me,
"Saditty."

588
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,103
- Nikki.
- What?

589
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,042
My name is Frances.

590
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,909
Call me that.

591
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:45,973
All right, <i>Frances.</i>

592
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,952
Might make you my little sister
or something up in here.

593
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,891
<i>All we had</i>
<i>was each other</i>

594
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,917
<i>and sometimes a little support</i>
<i>from the outside.</i>

595
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,225
<i>Like one visiting day,</i>
<i>when Nikki's mama</i>

596
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,527
<i>was bringing the babies</i>
<i>that she had in jail.</i>

597
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,797
<i>You know that motherfucker Dease</i>
<i>wouldn't even let Nikki hold 'em</i>

598
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,564
<i>before he gave her</i>
<i>to her mother?</i>

599
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,764
<i>Frances was excited</i>
<i>'cause she was expecting</i>

600
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,899
<i>good news from her lawyer</i>
<i>about the appeal.</i>

601
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,704
<i>Everybody was feeling good</i>
<i>that day.</i>

602
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,540
- You look so pretty.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

603
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,103
Where you going?

604
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,741
Her mama is coming
to bring her babies!

605
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,013
- Lil' Mama, you can't hold piss.
- I'm sorry.

606
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:25,011
I didn't want nobody
to know until now.

607
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,183
You better take pictures.
You look beautiful.

608
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,489
I'm happy for you.

609
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,029
- Hey, hey, I did a good job.
- Yeah, you did.

610
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:36,693
Well, Ms. Barnes.

611
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:40,727
Well, well, well.
Ms. Barnes, Ms. Barnes.

612
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,238
Don't she look pretty?

613
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,798
Like going to the prom
or something.

614
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,366
<i>Very nice.</i>

615
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,572
Ms. Shepard,
you have a visitor.

616
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:56,549
- See you later, Frances.
- See you soon, guys.

617
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,851
<i>I will be back for you,</i>
<i>Ms. Barnes.</i>

618
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,482
Okay.

619
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:04,017
Okay, so in the meantime,
I got smokes.

620
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,427
<i>But like they say,</i>
<i>"Shit happens."</i>

621
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,900
<i>Nikki's mama never came,</i>
<i>and Frances' appeal was denied.</i>

622
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,130
Ms. Shepard, your transfer
was denied.

623
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,105
Guess you're gonna
be with us a little longer.

624
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,104
Come on, ladies.
Eat up! Eat up!

625
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,872
Come on, eat up!

626
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,981
<i>Man, they start working us</i>
<i>longer and longer.</i>

627
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,177
<i>Sometimes we went to bed</i>
<i>without dinner.</i>

628
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:30,016
<i>After all that</i>
<i>and Nikki's beating too,</i>

629
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,318
<i>man, Wet said</i>
<i>she had enough.</i>

630
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,290
<i>She said we had to do</i>
<i>something else</i>

631
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,624
<i>instead of going out to work</i>
<i>like some docile field niggas.</i>

632
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:40,529
<i>It was time for her to give</i>
<i>our petitions to the warden.</i>

633
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,534
Frances,
I got this petition

634
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,933
that I'm trying
to get people to sign.

635
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:51,206
<i>Man, things got even worse.</i>
<i>The warden laughed in Wet's face</i>

636
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,472
<i>and he threw the petitions</i>
<i>in the garbage.</i>

637
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,605
<i>Plus he wrote her up</i>
<i>and added time to her sentence.</i>

638
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,673
<i>And then that fucking</i>
<i>troublemaking bitch Aisha,</i>

639
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:04,120
<i>she came back from the hospital</i>
<i>and everybody was in a funk again.</i>

640
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,487
How was it up in the big
federal hospital?

641
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,391
Did they sew up
your hole too?

642
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:13,193
Yeah, but your mama stretched it
back out with her tongue.

643
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,895
- On the yard, bitch. On the yard.
- Inmates, you just lost chow time.

644
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,904
- I ain't no inmate, bitch.

645
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,132
I'm a convict.

646
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:25,107
Wet took the warden's
rejection pretty bad.

647
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:29,875
So us girls decided to hook her up
with a little contraband.

648
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,246
We had a nice little party.

649
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,842
Let's go.

650
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,150
You know what I want to do
when I get out?

651
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,555
I want to get some sleep.

652
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,923
<i>Word up.</i>

653
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,829
I am so tired of "lights out,"

654
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,833
"chow down."

655
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,199
I'm tired
of being programmed.

656
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,797
- Yeah.
- I want me some keys.

657
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,774
Open up the doors
and come and go as I please.

658
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,505
<i>- I know what you mean.</i>
- I feel you, girl.

659
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,979
Here's to them--
here's to our babies

660
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,210
and survival.

661
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,616
- Survival.
- I heard that.

662
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,156
He's coming.
Oh shit, it's Dease.

663
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,557
- In the pantry. In the pantry.

664
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,119
- Quiet. Quiet.
- Go, go, go.

665
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,461
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- Busted by him.

666
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,126
<i>- Hurry, hurry.</i>
- Okay!

667
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,168
What's Dease doing back here?

668
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,397
Something he ain't got
no business doing.

669
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,632
- What is he doing behind the stove?

670
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,577
<i>Like I said, something he ain't</i>
<i>got no business doing.</i>

671
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,410
<i>- Long night, Meadows?</i>

672
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,643
Um, yeah.

673
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,017
I was...

674
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,214
<i>I was studying last night.</i>

675
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,586
College boy's
got a hard life.

676
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,057
- I didn't know you cared, Banks.
- I don't.

677
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,088
<i>- What was that?</i>

678
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:59,228
Center, this is Cervantes.
What the hell was that?

679
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,430
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Something blew up in the kitchen.</i>

680
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,473
- Okay, roger that. Come on.
<i>- Attention!</i>

681
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,374
Dease's friend got the contracts
to rebuild the kitchen.

682
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,004
But he blamed the inmates,
as usual.

683
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,310
He tried to say somebody
was negligent,

684
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,943
and that he wanted to find out
who it was to make them pay.

685
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:17,078
Like he wasn't the one
fucking up all the time.

686
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:20,454
And Nelson? Nelson shut
the whole prison down.

687
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:24,552
No visits, no phone calls,
no nothing after that.

688
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,187
Shut down.

689
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,529
- Hey, my man.
- Hey.

690
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,966
- Good to see you.
- All right.

691
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,062
Hey, listen, I'm playing golf with
the Wall Corp. People on Saturday.

692
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,575
I wanted to include you,
but we already got a foursome.

693
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,042
Maybe next time, okay?

694
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,238
Well, thanks for thinking
about me.

695
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,612
- No problem.
- I'm not that big on golf anyway.

696
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,777
Yeah, but you do play some games,
don't you, Dease?

697
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,081
Sir?

698
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,286
I'm talking about that little
explosion in the kitchen.

699
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,918
Any truth to that?

700
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,488
No, sir.

701
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,226
I mean, who said that?

702
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,667
It doesn't matter who said it.
The problem is it got back to me.

703
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,762
<i>Guess what? I'm hip to that scam</i>
<i>about your boys</i>

704
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,569
<i>rebuilding the damage</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

705
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:15,170
Now listen, your job is to take care
of everything on the plan.

706
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,305
But when people
come to my office

707
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,715
and tell me about a whole bunch
of stuff I don't give a damn about,

708
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,776
then that means you're
not doing your job.

709
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,880
- I'm doing my job.
- No, you're <i>not</i> doing your job.

710
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,250
Shante Wright came to me

711
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,818
circulating a petition
you didn't even know about.

712
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:35,628
<i>- Wet's petitions are bullshit.</i>
- What's that, Dease?

713
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:39,295
- Are the inmates in control now?
- No, sir.

714
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,338
Let me get something straight.

715
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,830
I run this fucking prison,
not you!

716
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,274
Yes, sir.

717
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,473
I want all your sideline
operations to stop.

718
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,539
If I get wind that you're still
doing your dirty business,

719
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,983
I'm gonna put you right
back where I found you--

720
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,614
in the Florida swamps
walking a guard tower...

721
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:03,286
with the mosquitoes
buzzing all around your ass.

722
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,057
<i>- Comprende?</i>
- Yes, sir.

723
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,640
"The beauty of life
is knowing you are loved.

724
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,076
As time passes, knowledge
and understanding of who you are

725
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,238
<i>cause seeds of doubt</i>
<i>to disappear..."</i>

726
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,479
Psst, psst, psst.

727
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,094
Shut up a minute.
Move out of the way.

728
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,595
Shakedown. Yo, shakedown.
Shakedown.

729
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,140
<i>What are you looking for?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

730
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:55,167
- This is what I'm looking for.
- Take your hands off my shit!

731
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,941
Guard:
Where are you going?

732
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,609
You're gonna pay
for that, bitch!

733
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,381
<i>- Get your hands off her!</i>
- What did you do to her?!

734
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,911
Let's see how much writing
you do up in the hole.

735
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,924
- Fuck you!

736
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,085
Take her to the hole now!
Now!

737
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,290
Is there a law against
reading and writing?

738
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,762
Hold it down, Wet.

739
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:21,430
- God is gonna keep you, Wet.
- Back up. Let's go.

740
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:24,269
- Please keep her.
- Get your asses back in your cells.

741
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,869
Please don't let them hit her.

742
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,971
God, please guard Wet.

743
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:37,847
Harvey, I don't give a goddamn
about that. Just get it done.

744
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,823
Jesus Christ.

745
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,024
Son of a bitch.

746
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,792
Well, well, well.

747
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,605
You must be my new girl.

748
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,871
Yes, sir.
I'm replacing Sabrina.

749
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,537
Ooh.

750
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,274
And what's your name,
young lady?

751
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,805
- Rose.
- Rose.

752
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,340
That's a very pretty name.

753
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,875
Thanks.

754
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,480
You know, my grandmama's
name was Rose.

755
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,852
I sure do like
the way you clean, Rose.

756
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,326
Now, you...

757
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,392
you missed a spot
right up there, Rose.

758
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,370
A piece of cobweb that's hanging
down right there. You see that?

759
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,075
I like everything in here
to be real spotless.

760
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,700
Why don't you take
that chair

761
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:37,372
and get that piece
of cobweb up there, Rose.

762
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,491
Mm-mmm. I sure do
like the way you clean, Rose.

763
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,530
Yeah, you and I
are gonna work out just fine--

764
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,433
Can I go now, sir?

765
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,462
I'm not stopping you.

766
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,269
<i>When Lil' Mama</i>
<i>told us what Dease tried to do,</i>

767
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,506
<i>and Wet came back from the hole</i>
<i>with that nasty scar on her face--</i>

<i>aw man, we didn't care</i>
<i>what was gonna happen to us.</i>

<i>we had to fight back.</i>

770
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,209

773
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,624
Something to motivate you.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:08,871
- So what'd they say?
- Wall Corp. Changed the date on us.

785
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:11,635
- To when?
- Next Thursday.

786
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:15,008
<i>Everything was going fine</i>
<i>till Lil' Mama came work one day</i>

787
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,139
and found out that Wall Corp.
Had changed the date.

788
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:22,084
They flipped the scrip on us,
so we had to flip it back on them.

- Did you talk to D?
- I ain't got nothing to do with it.

800
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,293
Don't depend on me,
don't ask me shit.

801
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,134
Hey, look, you read
the demands,

802
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,040
- I'll hand it to them.
- Why? You the leader.

803
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,408
As soon as I stand,
they're going to suspect

804
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,675
that some shit's
about to go down.

805
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,783
- Then I'll do it.
- Okay.

806
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,719
I'll stand right behind you.
Okay?

807
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:56,004
- Captain Dease? Miller.
- Glad to meet you.

808
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,446
- I've been waiting for you.
- My associate Owen.

<i>- Miller! You made it.</i>
- Nelson! My man, what's going on?

810
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:04,083
Everything's going fine.
That hole in one on the 17th?

811
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,918
It was doggone impressive
on Saturday.

812
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,550
- Dease, you should've been there!
- Sorry, I couldn't make it.

813
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,254
In all seriousness, our inmates
love the work they do.

814
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,126
They leave here
with valuable skills,

815
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,654
and you have a product
you can market around the world.

816
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,894
The labor pool here
is more cost effective.

817
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:20,061
I'll let you in
on a little secret--

818
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:23,038
the workers can't quit here.

819
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,071
It's just that Mr. Dease and I

820
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,635
are looking forward to working
with you more closely.

821
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,639
- We really are. We really are.
- Mr. Dease is quite the bulldog.

822
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,811
- Every shop needs one.
-

823
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,754
You're gonna be very impressed
with what we've set up here.

824
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,814
We've managed to put double the--

825
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,553
<i>I'm very impressed.</i>

826
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:45,027
<i>The last two quarters</i>
<i>have been outstanding.</i>

827
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:47,997
<i>I wish we had this kind of spirit</i>
<i>at all our facilities.</i>

828
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,296
<i>And the next two quarters</i>
<i>are going to be even better.</i>

829
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,063
But let me show you around.

830
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,730
These women are making
the linings for your ski jackets.

831
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,036
They're very well trained
and we see to that.

832
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,599
We work with the team system.

833
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:03,043
<i>That group attaches the linings</i>
<i>to the shell of the jacket</i>

834
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,139
<i>and then the zippers</i>
<i>are sewn in.</i>

835
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,979
Definitely, and we also have--
what the...?

836
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,422
This is a peaceful
work stoppage.

837
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,323
- We stand in solidarity...
<i>- Shut up, sit down!</i>

838
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,831
...with all reform movements,
demanding fair treatment...

839
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:24,857
<i>- I hope you know what you're doing.</i>
- Dease, what's going on?

840
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,130
...better work conditions,
better heat...

841
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,968
<i>- Shepard, sit down!</i>
- An end to the vicious beatings

842
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,305
and the sexual abuse
we face every day.

843
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,970
Work, God damn it!
Get back to work!

844
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,378
Take our petitions

845
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,747
and let everybody know what goes on
behind these walls.

846
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:45,817
<i>Dease, what's going on?</i>
<i>Huh? Little joke?</i>

847
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:48,086
All of these women
stand behind these demands.

848
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,492
Frankly, we've been having a little
problem with these two women.

849
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,621
As you can see,
nobody else is standing.

850
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,836
- I stand behind her too.
<i>- Sabrina!</i>

851
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,241
<i>I hope you bitches know</i>
<i>what you're doing!</i>

852
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,211
- I stand behind her.
<i>- Back to work!</i>

853
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,840
- I stand behind her.
- I stand behind her.

854
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:15,750
I stand behind her.

855
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,186
- Yeah.
<i>- Your ass is gonna pay for this.</i>

856
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:21,349
<i>Your black asses</i>
<i>are gonna pay for this.</i>

857
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,552
<i>Get back to work, I say!</i>
<i>God damn it!</i>

858
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,788
<i>- I'm up here too.</i>
<i>- I'm behind you.</i>

859
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,229
Please... take this.

860
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:32,725
- Go on, take it!
- Look, go back to work.

861
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,203
- Fuck that shit! Fuck you!

862
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,403
Why'd you do that?

863
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,093
Take her to the hole!
The fucking bitch!

864
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,138
Get back to work!

865
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,662
Get back
to work!

866
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,606
Get back to work!

867
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,958
How long have we been in?

868
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:38,935
Three... four days.

869
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,463
Yeah, well,
you better get used to it.

870
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,271
'Cause we're gonna
be in here for a while.

871
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,237
One...

872
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,341
<i>two...</i>

873
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,252
31...

874
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:02,423
- Three...
- Four...

875
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,423
Eight.

876
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,459
Nine.

877
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:15,062
<i>35. Come on.</i>
<i>Come on, Nikki, you can do this.</i>

878
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:18,039
<i>- Come on.</i>
-

879
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,772
We been in this motherfucker
for six days!

880
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,906
Ain't nobody been in here
for six days!

881
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:31,112
Fuck this shit, man.
Fuck this shit!

882
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,952
Come on, Nikki,
you can do this!

883
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,981
<i>Stay focused.</i>
<i>Come on, let's do it!</i>

884
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,085
What makes you so sure
we gonna make it?

885
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:42,690
'Cause I got a little girl and she's
waiting on me to come home.

886
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,429
- What's her name?
- Maxine.

887
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,047
Oh, Maxine.

888
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,742
No. Maxine!

889
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,220
Baby?
Where are you, baby?

890
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,223
Oh my God.
No, wait.

891
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,156
Frances?

892
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,888
- Oh good.
- Frances.

893
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,455
Her name is Maxine.

894
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,298
Her name
is Maxine.

895
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,338
<i>Her name is Maxine.</i>

896
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,205
<i>My baby's name</i>
<i>is Maxine.</i>

897
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,375
<i>So, what you in for?</i>

898
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,143
Armed robbery.

899
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:38,387
For the reason women are always
doing some old dumb shit--

900
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,480
for a nigga.

901
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,516
Mmm.

902
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,653
But what a nigga
he was.

903
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,565
<i>His name was Smalls.</i>

904
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,829
<i>He swore he was a baller,</i>

905
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:55,065
but he wasn't nothing
but a seven-gram nigga.

906
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:59,939
Then he gets this idea
to rob this old bullshit dealer.

907
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:02,911
Now I know he was too stupid
to pull it off without me.

908
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,176
We were gonna be
Bonnie and Clyde.

909
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:11,085
Get some of that ice, some of that
fly shit we see up in the videos.

910
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,918
Only Smalls wasn't
no Clyde.

911
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,157
Fool went
and got hisself killed.

912
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,062
<i>And I ended up</i>
<i>back in here...</i>

913
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,066
again.

914
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,930
<i>Had to make it on my own.</i>
<i>I never wanted to hurt nobody.</i>

915
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,530
I've always tried
to follow the rules.

916
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:34,236
I never followed no rules,

917
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:36,871
and we end up
in the same place.

918
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,245
Ain't that some shit?

919
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,149
<i>Then I met Greg.</i>

920
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:45,177
<i>I loved him so much.</i>

921
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,281
Wonder what they're
doing back home?

922
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,552
I ain't never been high.

923
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,161
How does it feel?

924
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:58,429
Hope that motherfucker Dease
gets what he has coming to him...

925
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,401
and I'm there
to see it.

926
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,241
Don't run from me, Nikki.

927
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,780
It's time to get high.

928
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,644
Got something for you.

929
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,721
You think about it, Nikki.

930
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:24,125
You gonna be in here
a long, long time.

931
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,129
<i>And this is gonna help</i>
<i>the time pass faster.</i>

932
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:29,963
<i>Come on.</i>

933
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,865
<i>Take a little trip.</i>

934
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,903
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

935
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,531
I'm gonna leave this
right here for you.

936
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,671
<i>Come on, Nikki.</i>

937
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:45,112
<i>- Nikki?</i>
<i>- Take a little hit.</i>

938
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:47,343
<i>- Nikki?</i>
<i>- You'll give in.</i>

939
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,443
You know you're
not that strong.

940
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,318
No, Nikki, listen to me!

941
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:55,415
Listen to me. Stay focused.
Repeat after me.

942
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,757
<i>Five times two.</i>
<i>Five times two's 10.</i>

943
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,231
<i>It's 10.</i>
<i>Five times three is 15.</i>

944
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:05,132
<i>Repeat after me.</i>
<i>Stay focused.</i>

945
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,465
<i># Angel dust, angel dust... #</i>

946
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:10,131
Five times four...

947
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,697
is 20.

948
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:15,336
...times five is 25.

949
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:21,941
Five times six is-- is 30.

950
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,617
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

951
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,183
- Five times seven...
<i>- Is what?</i>

952
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,195
<i>- is 35.</i>
- Yeah.

953
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,625
- Five times eight...
<i>- Yeah?</i>

954
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,568
- is 40.
<i>- Very good.</i>

955
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:46,603
<i>You're stronger than that.</i>
<i>Yes, yes!</i>

956
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,755
All right, Barnes, it's time.

957
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,389
Don't just sit there.

958
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,455
Come on.

959
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:46,995
Let's go, Shepard.

960
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,235
Come on.

961
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,435
Go on, get up.

962
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,016
Stand your ass
over there.

963
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:05,478
Nikki and Frances didn't think
the strike meant anything.

964
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,046
But they were wrong.

965
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,854
It meant something to me.
Before that day,

966
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,760
I had never stood up
for nothing in my life.

967
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:16,664
But I stood up that day,
and I been standing up ever since.

968
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:20,135
The captain's got
a little surprise for you.

969
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,341
You're gonna be
peeling this wall.

970
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:30,574
- By myself?
- That's what I said.

971
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,922
<i>What does the blind man</i>
<i>say when he pass the fish store?</i>

972
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:23,660
- Good morning, ladies.

973
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:26,967
Didn't you say it was this wall?

974
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,034
This one?

975
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:36,739
Banks just told me
he told you to peel this wall.

976
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,077
- No, no, he said to peel--
- I did not.

977
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,811
Are you telling me you don't
know the authorized areas?

978
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,649
<i>- No, I'm not saying that.</i>
- What exactly are you saying?

979
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,383
- He said peel this wall--
- Banks said to peel this wall.

980
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,948
- No, Banks said this wall.
- Did you say peel this one?

981
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,824
You're lying.
He said to peel this wall.

982
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,352
- Banks said to peel this wall!
- Banks said peel this wall!

983
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,922
- I fucking heard what Banks said!
- Take her back to the hole.

984
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,729
- No, no!
- Take her back to the hole!

985
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,395
- Please, please, no!
- Take her black ass to the hole!

986
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,269
No, no, I'll do anything you say!
Don't, please!

987
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:06,070
Please, whatever you say,
Captain.

988
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,441
- Just-- no, no.
- Tell me you'll be a good bitch.

989
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,504
I'll be good.
I pro-- I promise.

990
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,609
Tell me you're gonna be
a good bitch.

991
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,644
Tell me you're
gonna be a good bitch.

992
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,417
Say it!

993
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,448
Say it! "I'm gonna be a good bitch,
Captain Dease."

994
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,518
Say it!

995
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:29,794
I'll be a good bitch,
Captain Dease.

996
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,998
Leave her ass.

997
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,371
I ain't through with you.

998
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:50,318
<i>That bitch.</i>

999
00:59:57,226 --> 01:00:01,128
Thank you.
Shepard, you got 15.

1000
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,127
Hey.

1001
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,737
You don't look so good, Sis.

1002
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,637
It's called a prison tan.

1003
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:14,108
There ain't no beaches.
Where's the baby?

1004
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,808
I tried to come see you, but--

1005
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,838
but they said everybody
was on lockdown.

1006
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,248
And I was in solitary.

1007
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,051
Oh, come on.
Hey, hey.

1008
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,959
Stop crying.
Don't cry.

1009
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:34,930
Come on, it's been rough,
but I'm out now.

1010
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,364
I'm here.

1011
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,391
Is the baby
in the car?

1012
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:42,904
Don't tell me they wouldn't
let you bring her in?

1013
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,406
No.

1014
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:49,144
I swear, I told Walter--

1015
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,772
I told Walter to stay away
from those gangs.

1016
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,146
- Kim, where's the baby?
- There was a fight.

1017
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,913
- You're talking in circles.
<i>- Walter didn't tell me nothing.</i>

1018
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,284
- The bullet--
- What bullet?

1019
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,448
It got Maxine!

1020
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,958
- She died two weeks ago!
- No, no, no!

1021
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:06,894
- I tried to call you!

1022
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,591
No! No!

1023
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,733
Don't tell me!
You're lying!

1024
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,968
<i>No! No!</i>

1025
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,942

01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:48,103
They got her
on suicide watch.

1034
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,935
Motherfuckers.

1035
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,965
You speak
to your old man?

1036
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,136
Yeah, the lawyer said--

1037
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,773
all we need to do
is get hard proof.

1038
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,277
And we gonna find a way
to get it, too.

It's cool, Nik.

1060
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,449
So how y'all gonna get him?

1061
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,428
Who you talking about, Aisha?

1062
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:58,024
Nikki, you know who
I'm talking about.

1063
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,264
Dease. I know you're all
over here planning something.

1064
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:06,874
<i>Huh?</i>

1065
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,844
We thought Dease
was your "loverman."

1066
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,813
- Oh my God.
- Damn. What happened?

1067
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,345
Something that ain't
never gonna happen again.

1068
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,649
I want that motherfucker so bad
I could taste that shit.

1069
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,424
Even if we was thinking
about doing something,

1070
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:28,930
which we wasn't,

1071
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:32,298
what makes you think we would
trust your rathole ass?

1072
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:36,094
That's a fair question.

1073
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,936
I swear on the life
of my little shorty

1074
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:42,172
that if I don't get revenge
on that black motherfucker

1075
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,111
y'all could--

1076
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,773
y'all could do me.

1077
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,751
And we will do you, Aisha.

1078
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:54,484
I know y'all are not through
with Dease.

1079
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,853
I know y'all got a plan
or something.

1080
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:01,261
But I want revenge
on that black motherfucker.

1081
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,027
Never know. Maybe we could
do a little business.

1082
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,762
Yeah, we'll call you on that.
We'll call you.

1083
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,704
He fucked her up.

1084
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,307
They finally came up
with a plan.

1085
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,817
But they needed somebody's
help from the inside.

1086
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:25,047
<i>So they asked Michael.</i>

1087
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:28,386
Excuse me.
Could I talk to you for a minute?

1088
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:32,861
<i>Dease's days were numbered because</i>
<i>they went to work on his ass.</i>

1089
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,928

01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,764
Captain?

1091
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:42,428
Come here.

1092
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,007
What are you doing here?

1093
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:54,016
I thought you were
mad at me.

1094
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,546
I missed you, lover.

1095
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,990
Rose,

1096
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:08,963
that's enough
cleaning for today.

1097
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,556
You can go.

1098
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:17,296
I'll be right back.

1099
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:19,603
Don't you go anywhere.

1100
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:33,814
- You look good.
- So you're not mad at me, huh?

1101
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,760
- Captain, sir, I forgot my Bible.
- Well, just get it and go, Rose.

1102
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,761
You look good today.

1103
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,637
Hurry up, Rose!

1104
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,768
- Jesus.
- Thank you, sir.

1105
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,510
- Come here.

1106
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,783
- Show me you miss me.
- Stop, sir.

1107
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:04,183
- What are you talking about?
- Stop, sir.

1108
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,211
- Don't play with me.
- What did I do?!

1109
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:09,418
- I didn't do anything.
- You changing up on me, girl?

1110
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,585
Please, I didn't do anything.
Aah! No!

1111
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,562
- I didn't do anything. Please.
- Shut up. Shut up.

1112
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:20,467
Please. Please don't!
Why are you doing this?

1113
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,369
Shit.

1114
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:27,342
Oh God.

1115
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,866
Oh God.

1116
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,377
Oh, shit.

1117
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,472
May I have a towel...

1118
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,449
sir?

1119
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:41,579
Of course, baby.

1120
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:48,596
Oh shit.

1121
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,532
<i>Oh shit.</i>

1122
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,506
Bastard.

1123
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:09,240
Oh shit.

1124
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,456
Get the fuck up outta here.

1125
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,459
The plan was Lil' Mama
was gonna get the tape to Michael.

1126
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:29,471
Ahh! No!

1127
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:32,905
Michael was gonna get
the tape to Wet's boyfriend.

1128
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,410
Wet's boyfriend was gonna get
the tape to somebody

1129
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,241
who had a hook up
with the governor.

1130
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,372
- So we was trying to be straight.
- Shut up!

1131
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,649
Lil' Mama came back to work
to get the tape

1132
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:50,682
with her Bible case empty.

1133
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:54,127
<i>But the damn door was locked,</i>
<i>and Dease took off early.</i>

1134
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:57,758
<i>Now she gotta come back tomorrow</i>
<i>and try the shit again.</i>

1135
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,570

<i>how pretty you are, Rose.</i>

1144
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:31,190

1145
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,360

handle the meeting?

1150
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,807
<i>But we can't vote</i>
<i>until you--</i>

1151
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,442
I can't be there right now.
Rose!

1152
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:51,544
This nigga wants to be
the last one up in here.

1153
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:54,385
- Where the fuck is he at?

1154
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,691
You're not trying to leave me,
are you, Rose?

1155
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,698
Stop it, sir. Please!

1156
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:06,724
Come on, Rose. I know you like
the way it feels, don't you?

1157
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:08,997
No, I don't.
It's a sin!

1158
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,063
Like what you did
to your father, Rose?

1159
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,837
He wasn't my father.

1160
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,778
Stepfather.
Lover.

1161
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:20,611
Father of your unborn child.

1162
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:22,844
Don't make
no fucking difference.

1163
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,376
You're no fucking virgin, Rose.
Are you?

1164
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:26,752
Are you? Are you, Rose?!

1165
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,848
- Stop it!
- You ain't a fucking virgin.

1166
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,382
- Stop it! Stop it!
- I knew you wasn't a virgin.

1167
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,793
You don't give this shit to me,
I'm gonna take it.

1168
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,524
- No!
- I'm gonna take it, Rose!

1169
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,964
- No!
- Shut the fuck up.

1170
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:40,001
Lean your ass over here.

1171
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,398
<i>Please don't do this.</i>
<i>Please don't do this!</i>

1172
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,680
<i>"The Lord is</i>
<i>my light and my salvation;</i>

1173
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:02,316

1174
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:03,791

1175
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:07,557
Damn, where are you,
Lil' Mama?

1176
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,326
What happened?!

1177
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:17,736
- He never showed up.
- Damn, I gotta go look for her.

1178
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,673
Dease was supposed
to be at that meeting.

1179
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,534
Something's up.

1180
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,716
- Oh.
- Oh my God!

1181
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:31,515
- What happened to you?
- Frances, the baby!

1182
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:34,351
Oh shit! Help me get her up.
Help me get her up.

1183
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,620
- All right.
- Oh my God, she's bleeding.

1184
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:39,219
Oh my God!
Get her to the infirmary now!

1185
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,759
- You've gotta--
- Ow!

1186
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:46,427
- No, keep walking.
- Get her back, back.

1187
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:48,129
Back it up.
Swing it around.

1188
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:02,045
What's wrong with her?

1189
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:06,116
- She's having a miscarriage.
- No!

1190
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,487
- The baby?
- I can't do anything for the child.

1191
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:10,617
I got to try to save her
if I can.

1192
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,286
Hold on, Lil' Mama.
Hold on.

1193
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,193
- It's okay. It's okay.
<i>- No!</i>

1194
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,254
- What happened?
- We're here for you.

1195
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:19,961
I was raped
by the captain.

1196
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,595
- I was raped!
- You were raped?

1197
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,071
Oh my God.

1198
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,703
Hold her down!

1199
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:34,275
<i>- Keep her still.</i>

1200
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:38,286
<i>- We need you to do this.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

1201
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,914
<i>- I can't get a pulse.</i>
<i>- I'm a nurse.</i>

1202
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:42,651
She's having a cardiac arrest.

1203
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,090
<i>Get the defibrillator.</i>

1204
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,923
- Here.
- Hold on, Lil' Mama.

1205
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,088
Hold on.
Please, Lil' Mama, hold on!

1206
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,394
Let her go. Let her go.
Let her go, Nikki!

1207
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:51,922
Let her go!

1208
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,958
<i>Clear!</i>

1209
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,902
- Again.
- Oh no, no, no.

1210
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,906
Please hold on.
Breathe!

1211
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,634
Breathe, baby!
Breathe, baby!

1212
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:02,439
- She's not moving.

1213
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,639
- Turn the machine off.
- What?

1214
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,944
- She's gone.
- No!

1215
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,746
No, Lil' Mama, hold on, girl!

1216
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,049
- Do it now!
- I think you girls should go now.

1217
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,317
- Guard, get them out of here.
- Oh God.

1218
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:17,154
- I'm so sorry. No! No, Mama, no!
<i>- She's dead!</i>

1219
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:20,184
<i>- He's not helping us!</i>
<i>- Oh fuck!</i>

1220
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,060
Guard,
get them out of here!

1221
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:25,191
- I'm gonna call Captain Dease.
- What the fuck are you doing?

1222
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,928
- We need a guard in here!
- Let me go!

1223
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:29,402
<i>- Off the phone, God damn it!</i>
<i>- Stop it!</i>

1224
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,301
Snatch the phone, Nikki!
Snatch the phone!

1225
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,336
<i># Went on a date with her,</i>

1226
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,109
<i># What?</i>
<i>The nigga violated her? #</i>

1227
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,481
<i>- # Where the hell he at? #</i>
<i>- # Look, I ain't even sure #</i>

1228
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,316
<i># But I'm about to pick you up,</i>
<i>meet me at the corner store... #</i>

1229
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,219
- No!

1230
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,190
Michael, I got to cuff you.
Come on.

1231
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,749
<i># Breathing underground,</i>
<i>then I'll cut off his dick #</i>

1232
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,160
<i># Put a hole in his tongue,</i>
<i>then I won't be done... #</i>

1233
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,756
We ain't going no-fuckin'-where!
It's on!

1234
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,664
We ain't going
no-fuckin'-where!

1235
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,464
Cervantes, listen carefully.

1236
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,869
<i>Isolate the infirmary</i>
<i>from the cellblock.</i>

1237
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:07,239
- Copy that. Come on, guys.
- Frances, what are y'all doing?

1238
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,176
Doing what we gotta do.

1239
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,588
Your black ass is going
back to the hole.

1240
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:31,821
If you knew what I knew,
you'd lay down and die right now.

1241
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,665
- You first, motherfucker.

1242
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,346
<i># Now we can't talk,</i>
<i>mumbling #</i>

1243
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,371
<i># When it's over, yo,</i>
<i>we gonna walk #</i>

1244
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:50,214
<i># Stumbling,</i>
<i>I thought Kim was small #</i>

1245
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,447
<i># And I keep it from the start,</i>
<i>and yo, he got heart #</i>

1246
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,319
<i># So y'all can't wait</i>
<i>till it get dark... #</i>

1247
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,588
<i>Down here.</i>

1248
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:06,357
- Burn in hell!
- Mother-- fuck you!

1249
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,427
<i>Hey, Doc,</i>
<i>are you okay?!</i>

1250
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:16,843
- Whoever you are, stop there.
<i>- Get his handcuffs.</i>

1251
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:20,280
- We got hostages.
<i>- Who's going to the hole now?</i>

1252
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:23,876
You come around that corner,
we shoot the hostages.

1253
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:31,020
<i>Emergency lockdown.</i>
<i>I repeat, emergency lockdown.</i>

1254
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:33,186
Are they contained
in the infirmary?

1255
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,594
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1256
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,360
They're armed.

1257
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,924
I couldn't even get
my men up the main stairway.

1258
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,665
Isn't there another way in?

1259
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,207
Up the fire escape
and through the main courtyard.

1260
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:48,368
<i>But they'll see us coming.</i>

1261
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,812
<i>Look, sir...</i>

1262
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:53,712
we can go in hard and fast,

1263
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:56,274
but I really think we need
to let the governor know.

1264
01:15:56,318 --> 01:16:00,084
Nobody's going to call the governor.
We'll handle this ourselves.

1265
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:02,522
Shit.

1266
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:06,289
We can handle this in house,
deal with the fallout afterwards.

1267
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,762
- I don't think that's a good idea--
- Shut up!

1268
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:12,729
All right.

1269
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:15,601
All right, they only have
in-house phones, right?

1270
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:18,868
- Yes, sir.
- All right, we wait for their call.

1271
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:24,204
I want your men ready,
locked and cocked, okay?

1272
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:32,051
They got Dease tied up
real good.

1273
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,645
Die, you motherfucker.

1274
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:37,216
But they let Michael go, 'cause they
didn't have no beef with him.

1275
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:41,127
Guess he was just a good guy
caught up in a bad situation.

1276
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,395
<i>Who ever heard of women</i>
<i>taking over a prison?</i>

1277
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:47,935
What we gonna do?

1278
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:50,597
We gotta make our demands.

1279
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:52,936
We got to do what real
revolutionaries do

1280
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,670
to get attention.

1281
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:57,076
Fuckin' bitches.

1282
01:16:57,112 --> 01:17:01,811
Do what I'd do-- you'd give
yourselves up... and let me go,

1283
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:04,512
before you get
your fucking heads blown off.

1284
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,714
- You call us bitches again...
- Nikki! Nikki!

1285
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:09,622
...you the one who's gonna
get his fucking head blown off!

1286
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,182
- Nikki!
- No! Fuck me!

1287
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:12,921
I got the bitch for you,
motherfucker!

1288
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,020
Stop! We gotta think.

1289
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:18,590
You bitches can't think--
you're three grades too short.

1290
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,797
- Wet!
- What's that, you fucking shit?!

1291
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:25,966
Look, they gotta know that Dease
killed Lil' Mama and Doc.

1292
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:29,010
They ain't gonna believe that shit.
You know what?

1293
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:30,635
Don't tell Nelson nothing.

1294
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:33,443
Go over his head
and talk to the governor.

1295
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,181
Nikki...

1296
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:40,120
you're onto some shit.

1297
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:44,421
You know what? And I know exactly
what you should say, Sister Frances.

1298
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,657
- Warden Nelson.
- This is Frances Shepard,

1299
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,563
from the Women's
Reform Committee.

1300
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,864
Cut the bullshit, Shepard.

1301
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:55,596
Why don't you give
yourself up?

1302
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,139
Do you think this is
some kind of political action?

1303
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,731
Everything is political.

1304
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:03,471
<i>You got one hour to get</i>
<i>the governor on the line.</i>

1305
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:08,211
I have no power to do that.
Let me speak to Captain Dease.

1306
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,343
One hour.

1307
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,126
Damn it!

1308
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:32,065
You look stressed, my nigga.

1309
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:36,675
Yeah.
You got a light?

1310
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,805
Damn. You gonna help?

1311
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,408
- I'm gonna help.
- All right, then I got a light.

1312
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:45,976
Is this the governor?

1313
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:48,489
I gotta know if the hostages
are all right.

1314
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,354
Put somebody on the phone.
Anybody.

1315
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,860
You just got
to take my word for it.

1316
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,828
You got to be out
of your damn mind.

1317
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:57,263
- Why should I believe you?
- 'Cause we got guns

1318
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:58,527
and we got hostages.

1319
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:02,469
And she who got the gun
makes the motherfucking rules.

1320
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:04,802
Fucking around with Dease.

1321
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,705
- Waking up--
- Fuck Dease.

1322
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:10,910
- Don't be so quick to say that--
- Man, fuck Dease.

1323
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:12,436
Let me speak
to Captain Dease.

1324
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:16,042
<i>No deal unless I speak</i>
<i>to Captain Dease and that's final.</i>

1325
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,245

- Go get his ass.

1326
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,277
<i>Bring that motherfucker here.</i>

1327
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,654
Give a reason.
Show time, bitch.

1328
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,353
- Give me a reason.
- Bring the motherfucker here!

1329

<i>Who's the bitch now,</i>
<i>motherfucker?</i>

1330
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,761
Oh shit.

1331
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,731
- Tell him.
<i>- You heard her.</i>

1332
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:37,999
- Tell him!

1333
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,904
<i>- Tell him now!</i>

1334
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:43,069
I killed--
I killed Lil' Mama.

1335
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,136
And I killed the doctor.

1336
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,912
Call your men off.
Call them off.

1337
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,442
That's enough.
You got one hour.

1338
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:55,388
<i>- Let her go!</i>
- Fuck you!

1339
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,414
<i>Fuck you, you fucking bitch!</i>

1340
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,723
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Shoot the motherfucker!

1341
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,659
Shoot him!

1342
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:05,529
<i>Shoot him!</i>

1343
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:09,726
That's for Lil' Mama...

1344
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,272
that's for Frances...

1345
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:15,742
that's for my babies...
and your babies, motherfucker!

1346
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,796
<i>Come around the corner</i>
<i>with your hands up!</i>

1347
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,571
Come around the corner
with your hands up!

1348
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,905
Wait, Wet!
Where you going?

1349
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:49,604
<i>- Wet, no!</i>

1350
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:52,903
<i>Wet! Wet!</i>

1351
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:55,439
<i>No! Wet!</i>

1352
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:57,644
<i>Everybody,</i>
<i>hold your positions!</i>

1353
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,745
Motherfucker.

1354
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:05,959
<i>I got movement</i>
<i>over here at the door!</i>

1355
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:18,605
Wet! No!

1356
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:21,999
Pull back!
Pull back now!

1357
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,640
<i>Pull back now.</i>
<i>Pull back. Pull back!</i>

1358
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:37,886
I'm dead. I'm dead.

1359
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:40,190
Oh God. Oh God.

1360
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,196
You're okay, baby.

1361
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:46,758
- You're okay. Right here with you.
- Am I gonna die, Sister Frances?

1362
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:50,862
- I'm gonna die, ain't I?
- Oh God.

1363
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:53,908
- Oh God.
- Don't let me die for nothing.

1364
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:59,203
- Oh God.

1365
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:01,215
- Hold on, Wet.
- Hold on.

1366
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:06,152
- We right here. You all right.
- No. No, Wet, please.

1367
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:08,280
- No!
- No!

1368
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:38,247
We got that motherfucker good.

1369
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,050
We got him good.
Yeah.

1370
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:45,253
Now he know what it feels like
to have something taken from him--

1371
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,557
his motherfucking life.

1372
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,298
No.

1373
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:59,905
The way I see it...

1374
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,875
we got two choices.

1375
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:05,842
We could either wait--
wait here,

1376
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,508
have 'em come in here
and get us...

1377
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:12,111
or take our chances,

1378
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:15,179
go out there, and see what
they got coming for us.

1379
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:18,056
<i>In position</i>
<i>on the roof, clear shot at the door.</i>

1380
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:21,859
No. We got one more option.

1381
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,888
- We could end it all ourselves.
- Shit.

1382
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,195
What's going on up there?

1383
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:29,293
<i>Cervantes?</i>
<i>Cervantes!</i>

1384
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:33,137
I ain't putting no fucking gun
to my head. Fuck that.

1385
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,074
<i>Warden, this is Cervantes.</i>

1386
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:37,908
<i>I'd like to try to talk</i>
<i>them out one last time.</i>

1387
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:41,577
Nikki!

1388
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:43,015
<i>Nikki!</i>

1389
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:46,111
- Isn't that Cervantes?
- Mm-hmm.

1390
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:48,884
Just like a man to get
a woman to do his dirty work.

1391
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:52,256
Don't you get tired
of ass kissing, Cervantes?

1392
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:54,557
You have your kids
to think about.

1393
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:57,156
I can help you make a deal
with the warden.

1394
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:00,656
Nikki, maybe she's right.

1395
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,336
My kids don't even know me.

1396
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:08,103
I been gone so long.

1397
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,177
<i>Shut the fuck up, Cervantes!</i>

1398
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:14,409
Stop trying to play us.
It's too fucking late for that!

1399
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:26,455
It's gonna be bad.

1400
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:27,722
Cervantes!

1401
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:30,253
<i>Cervantes, end it now!</i>

1402
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,724
"Saditty"?

1403
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:36,862
You do the talking, right?

1404
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:40,374
Yeah, 'cause if they hear your mouth
they're gonna know something's up.

1405
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:43,104
Goddamn right they gonna know
something's up.

1406
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:44,941
Let's do it.

1407
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:53,046
Cervantes! End it now!

1408
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:57,281
Do I have to spell it out
for you?

1409
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:03,222
<i>End it now.</i>
<i>End it now!</i>

1410
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,392
<i>Cervantes!</i>
<i>End it now!</i>

1411
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,502
End it now!

1412
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,788
Come on.
Come on, come on.

1413
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,024
Got it.

1414
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,907
<i># Yeah #</i>

1415
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,340
<i># Yeah, man #</i>

1416
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:56,076
<i># Serious business here #</i>

1417
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:58,051
<i># Murder... #</i>

1418
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:01,214
<i>Now surprisingly,</i>
<i>the one that got the tape out</i>

1419
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:02,848
<i>was Aisha's ass.</i>

1420
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:05,451
<i>And because of that shit,</i>
<i>we won the lawsuit.</i>

1421
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:07,956
<i># Listen here #</i>

1422
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:11,625
<i># It's revolution... #</i>

1423
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:12,826
Ohh,

1424
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:14,858
Nelson got what was
coming to his ass.

1425
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,133
But our inmates love
the work they do,

1426
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:19,264
they leave here
with valuable skills

1427
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,934
and you have a product you can
market around the world.

1428
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:25,173
<i>By the time the governor</i>
<i>went through Wall Corp.,</i>

1429
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:27,511
they were totally bankrupt.

1430
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:30,541
And I mean, they found
so much shit on Nelson

1431
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,110
that they shut
the whole prison down.

1432
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:34,781
And his ass
is under indictment.

1433
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:37,518
- Dease, you should've been there!
- Sorry I missed it.

1434
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:41,118
My girl Aisha?

1435
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:44,962
She got killed in a fight
not long after the takeover.

1436
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,265
<i>I guess she never shook</i>
<i>that prison mentality, you know?</i>

1437
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,134
<i>Damn.</i>

1438
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:53,868
That's why we dedicating
our victory

1439
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:55,933
to the memory of my girls.

1440
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:57,910
<i>Wet...</i>

1441
01:26:57,946 --> 01:26:59,243

Frances...

1443
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,182
and Nikki.

1444
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:10,723
We did the crime
and we had to do the time.

1445
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:13,693
But ain't nobody say nothing
about abuse and exploitation

1446
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,525
being part of the sentence.

1447
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:19,158
I'm going back to Chicago
to finish writing my book

1448
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,998
and do everything I can
to stay out of jail.

1449
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,005
Ain't nothing good
happening up in there.

1450
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:27,405
And now that you know
what I know,

1451
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:29,273
pass the world along.

1452
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,540
Please, we got work to do,

1453
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,877
and we can't do it
up in no jail.

1454
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:38,477
Oh yeah, don't forget me.
I'm Sabrina,

1455
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:40,953
