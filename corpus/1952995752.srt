Good morning.

00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:38,668
Good morning,
Sylvester.

3
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:40,295
Morning, Mama.

4
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:41,798
Good morning, Gertie.

5
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:43,301
Good morning, Aunt Sarah.

6
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:44,594
Don't run...

7
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:46,265
with them eggs, Arnett!

8
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,305
Big Baby?

9
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,226
Big Baby?

10
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:04,813
Ma'am, Miss White?

11
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,399
Big Baby, come...

12
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:07,902
over here, please.

13
00:03:15,623 --> 00:03:16,958
Morning, Miss White.

14
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,463
Morning. Would you run this
over to Mr. Wright at the store?

15
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,715
Yes, ma'am, Miss White.

16
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:21,716
Big Baby...

17
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:23,387
Ma'am?

18
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,224
The name is Wright.

19
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:28,395
Yes, ma'am.

20
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:31,693
Mr. Wright,

21
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,120
Mr. Wright!

22
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:40,123
Oh, Mr. Wright!

23
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,502
Oh, Mr. Wright!

24
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:44,714
Mr. Wright,

00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:47,761
Mr. Wright,
I got your breakfast!

26
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,265
Stay where you are,
Big Baby!

27
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:52,269
Stay where you are!

28
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:53,604
I'm coming!

29
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,193
Mr. Wright! Mr. Wright,
I got your... breakfast.

30
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,878
A nice day, ain't it?

31
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:11,926
Y'all get on now.

32
00:04:19,564 --> 00:04:21,692
That'll be two pennies, please.

33
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,362
Thank you.

34
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,202
Girl, you better...

35
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:28,955
go away from here.

36
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:30,458
How's the family?

37
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:31,835
Morning, Miss Sarah.

38
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,171
Morning, Mr. Bryce.

39
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:34,339
Lovely day, ain't it?

40
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,009
Ooh, that it is.

41
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,512
You got that egg
for me, boy?

42
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,514
Yes, sir.

43
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,349
There you are.

44
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:41,518
Thank you.

45
00:04:41,684 --> 00:04:42,686
You're welcome.

46
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,022
- Here you go, Mama.
- All right.

47
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,983
All aboard!

48
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,084
Shoot.

49
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,466
Shoot, for Christ sake!

50
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,595
You little mullet!

51
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:58,105
What, are you an Audubon fella?
You a bird-watcher?

52
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,691
Come on.

53
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,491
This is going to be the first
boar you smoked yourself.

54
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,162
You know what them
Seminole injuns say?

55
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,998
You don't?

56
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,003
They say you only supposed
to kill what you gonna eat.

57
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,924
They say it's a sin
if you don't.

58
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:16,261
Damn Seminole.

59
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:19,517
Listen here.

60
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:22,187
Don't want you around
that colored boy no more.

61
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:23,523
Arnett?

62
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,695
Don't look right, my boy
trailing around after a nigger.

63
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:29,242
But he Arnett.
He's my friend.

64
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,037
That hurt?

65
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:33,415
No.

66
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,709
Why you cryin'?

67
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:36,336
I ain't crying.

68
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:39,593
You'll be a man soon.
I'll get you there.

69
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:42,763
Hey, Duke!

70
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:44,475
Seen any niggers out here?

71
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:46,020
No, sir.

72
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:48,148
Well, one escaped off
the chain gang near State Road.

73
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:49,735
Name's Jesse Hunter.

74
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:51,738
He might have headed
for Rosewood.

75
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,657
You keep an eye out.

76
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:56,037
You see him,
don't shoot him.

77
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:57,206
Bring him to me.

78
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:59,834
All right. Yes, sir.

79
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,253
I say shoot him.

80
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,672
Drive.

81
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:07,806
Aunt Sarah!

82
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:09,685
Sheriff.

83
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,137
Morning.

84
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:33,058
Morning.

85
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,150
I got a surprise for you.

86
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:41,572
- I wonder what it is.
- Don't move.

87
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:43,909
Come on, baby. Stop it.

88
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:45,996
James, come on now.

89
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:47,498
Don't act like a child.

90
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,792
Fanny. Fanny.

91
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,295
Stop it now.

92
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:51,463
Stop it.

93
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,464
Stop it.

94
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:53,466
Oh, Fanny.

95
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:56,013
I said stop it.
Go to work.

96
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,935
Damn!

97
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,319
Morning, Sarah.

98
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,447
Morning, Mr. Taylor.

99
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:12,415
Floors need scrubbin',
Aunt Sarah.

100
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:16,172
Relax, child. We already done
scrubbed all the cypress...

101
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,300
out of these old boards.

102
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:29,778
Watch out!

103
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:30,988
Excuse me, Mr. Taylor.

104
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:58,869
Goddamn.

105
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:01,290
So he won't come
around here, huh?

106
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,672
Earl, put the gun away.

107
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,843
Hell, that boy ain't
no more off a chain gang...

108
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:09,553
than I'm
governor of Florida.

109
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,225
Sit on down.

110
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:50,748
Bye, Emmett.

111
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:55,673
All right, settle down.

112
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,513
I'm gonna tell you a story, OK?
Pay attention.

113
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,015
"Once upon a time,

114
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:03,520
"there was
a pony named Dark...

115
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,650
"who every night took
little people to Sleepy Town.

116
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,655
"One night, as Dark Pony
started off,

117
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:12,868
"he met a little boy named
Naughty who called out...

118
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,084
"Please let me go.

119
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,586
"So Dark Pony whoaed...

120
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,465
"and Naughty
hopped on his back...

121
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:21,968
"and away they went.

122
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:23,052
"They went galloping..."

123
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:24,680
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

124
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:30,440
Hey, Cousin Scrappie.

125
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:33,529
Mr. Carter!

126
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:35,907
You got yourself
a customer!

127
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:42,336
Hey, mister,

128
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,589
why ain't you got a car?

129
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,592
I like a horse.

130
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,846
Car's faster.

131
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:52,102
I ain't in no hurry.
You got a name, boy?

132
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:54,105
Yes, sir. Name's Arnett.

133
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:57,110
Booker T., meet Arnett.

134
00:10:57,277 --> 00:11:00,574
Arnett, this here Booker T.

135
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,287
Why ain't you in school, boy?

136
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,249
I'm workin' for
Miss Fanny Taylor.

137
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,379
She payin' you
to follow me around?

138
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,436
Can I help you, mister?

139
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:20,692
Horse threw a shoe.
Need all four done.

140
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:23,446
Hell, can't get to it
till tomorrow.

141
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,449
Closing early tonight.

142
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:26,785
Why so?

143
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:28,955
It's New Year's Eve, sir.

144
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,167
Dance tonight,
8:00, Mason Hall.

145
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:34,256
Put that horse in the stable.
I'll take care of him for you.

146
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:36,468
That's a pretty horse, sir.

147
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:37,761
Thank you.

148
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:05,517
Now, Lemuel,
you know me, I'm fair.

149
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,854
I charge a dollar a jug.

150
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,859
But since you're
into me for $12 already,

151
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:13,363
I'm going to have
to put you down for three.

152
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:15,325
Three dollars?

153
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:18,664
Oh, now, Mr. Wright,
that ain't fair.

154
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:22,045
I... I know
I owes you a lots,

155
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:24,048
but I'm
a regular customer.

156
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:25,550
One dollar.

157
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,179
Thank you, Mr. Wright.

158
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,182
You better stop
drinking, Lemuel,

159
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,895
before I own...
your house.

160
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,573
Free of charge.

161
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:40,117
Go see after
your father.

162
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:41,702
Thank you, Mr. Wright.

163
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:44,582
Future customer.

164
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:49,758
Sorry, I don't extend
credit to strangers.

165
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:53,098
You own that plot
of land across the way?

166
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:55,101
I will...

167
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:57,187
this time tomorrow.

168
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,695
Look at this,
all these melons, no good.

169
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:04,742
Spoiled. Hog food now.

170
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,624
Jewel, darlin',
you got to throw these out.

171
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,253
You got some.45 shells?

172
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,094
Clean out.

173
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:18,515
Be going to Gainesville
first thing in the morning.

174
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:21,145
I'll pick some up.
You still be around then?

175
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,691
Might be.

176
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:32,498
What's wrong
with you two today?

177
00:13:32,664 --> 00:13:34,501
Every time I try to tell you
to do something,

178
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,003
you won't listen.

179
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,506
You know, I will smack you.
I'll smack you.

180
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:39,592
No more playtime for you, none.
Not today.

181
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:45,519
Mornin', teacher, ma'am.

182
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:47,147
I wonder
if you can tell me...

183
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:49,317
where a man can find
hisself a good meal?

184
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:52,823
Y'all go inside.

185
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,500
Well, my name ain't
"teacher, ma'am." It's Beulah.

186
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,045
Folks I know
call me Scrappie.

187
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:06,681
Well, folks I know
call me Mann...

188
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,685
Miss Scrappie.

189
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:14,735
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Mann.

190
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:16,155
Likewise.

191
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:23,082
Now, this here Rattler,
Mr. Mann.

192
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,585
He a deer dog.

193
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:25,920
He help me hunt,

194
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:28,758
'cause he can get real quiet,
know what I mean?

195
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:30,762
All right, come on, boy.

196
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:32,807
This way now. This way.

197
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:39,109
So, what, uh,

198
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,155
what you selling now,
Mr. Mann?

199
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:44,828
What makes you think I'm selling
something, Mr. Carrier?

200
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:50,337
Well, I figure a colored fellow
with nowhere particular to be,

201
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:52,716
that man be
sellin' something...

202
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,598
or he runnin'.

203
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:02,214
Well...

204
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,009
you figure wrong...

205
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:06,680
friend.

206
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:16,154
Come on inside.

207
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:22,249
Hey, Gertie,
got some good news.

208
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:24,544
Mr. Mann here
ain't sellin' nothin'.

209
00:15:24,753 --> 00:15:27,091
Turn that music down.

210
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:29,719
My husband
got a suspicious mind.

211
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,390
Oh, yes, I do.

212
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,560
He's sweet on you.

213
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:36,398
Scrappie, come over here
and help me with this bird.

214
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:39,611
Must be New Year's.

215
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:41,782
Yes, sir.
Come on in, Mr. Mann.

216
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:48,351
Evenin', Mr. Mann.

217
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,854
Ma'am.

218
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:51,356
Thank you.

219
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:53,736
This is my brother James,

220
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:57,033
his wife Emma,
and their daughter Jewel.

221
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:01,208
Be quiet.

222
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:03,961
Scrappie,
show the man a seat.

223
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,051
You can sit here.

224
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,554
Thank you.

225
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,402
Scrappie!

226
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,991
Now, I had a talk
with Mr. Andrews...

227
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:24,246
on your behalf today.

228
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:26,124
What about Mr. Andrews?

229
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,501
Mama, that old cracker...

230
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:29,420
caught hisself whistling
at Scrappie and all that.

231
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,590
What?

232
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,800
Yeah, that's right.

233
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:33,594
I went over there
and gave him some words.

234
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:38,436
Sylvester, what you say
to them people now?

235
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:44,321
Mr. Andrews, I come to have
a word with you about my cousin.

236
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:48,078
Now, I expect you
to show her some respect.

237
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:50,623
You expect, boy?

238
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,964
I don't like Scrappie
feelin' scared around nobody.

239
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,552
That a threat?

240
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:03,353
Ain't no threat needed.

241
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,358
I'm just sayin'
I don't mess with your peoples,

242
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,363
I don't want you
messin' with mines.

243
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,368
Now, I thank you
very kindly, sir.

244
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:17,461
Sylvester, you can't talk
to white folks like that...

245
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:19,464
and not expect a rope
around your neck.

246
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,467
Look, times
is changin', Mama.

247
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,511
Now, I ain't
no sharecropper.

248
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,307
I'm a music teacher.

249
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:29,522
Times ain't never changed
for no crackers, boy.

250
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:32,694
Don't you forget
they burned a colored man...

251
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:36,368
over in Wylie last summer
for winking at a white woman.

252
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:37,535
Sure did.

253
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:39,080
I know that, Mama,

254
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,083
but it's all right for them
to whistle at Scrappie?

255
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,627
No, that ain't right.

256
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:49,889
What do you think about all this
business, Mr. Mann?

257
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:52,603
Oh, that man
ready to eat.

258
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,733
Would you like to say
the blessing, Mr. Mann?

259
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,361
No, ma'am.

260
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:59,489
I'll do it, Mama.
I'll do it.

261
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:05,667
Thank you for the bounty
of our lives...

262
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,088
and the blessings
you've bestowed on us...

263
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,756
at home and family.

264
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:14,015
Can I have my yams now?

265
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,771
Who wants ham?

266
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,774
I want some yams.

267
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:22,278
Scrappie,
come eat a part of the bird...

268
00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:23,947
that went over
the fence last.

269
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:34,006
Well, at least ask him...
all right, all right.

270
00:18:36,469 --> 00:18:40,642
Ma'am, I ain't had a supper
like that in a long time.

271
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,562
Thank you kindly.

272
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,315
You're welcome.

273
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:46,986
You been drifting long,
Mr. Mann?

274
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:48,822
Seem like forever.

275
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,327
That ain't no kind
of life for a man.

276
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:54,333
You get yourself
a good piece of land,

277
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,336
the right woman...

278
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,339
a man can make
a new start 'round here,

279
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,218
make something
of hisself.

280
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:02,763
Ain't that right,
Scrappie?

281
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:09,650
Well, Aunt Sarah think Rosewood
colored folks' heaven on earth.

282
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:12,863
Best place these
old eyes ever seen.

283
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,035
Colored folks own
all the land around here.

284
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:17,538
All the businesses, too,

285
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:20,042
except for
Mr. Johnny Wright's store,

286
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,546
and he a halfway
decent white man,

287
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:24,925
if there ever
was such a thing.

288
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:29,016
Most of us doin' better than
them folks over in Sumner.

289
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:32,522
You ever seen a place
like Rosewood, Mr. Mann?

290
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:37,488
No, ma'am.

291
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:57,939
"Well, we know how to get money
when we need some," said Pecos.

292
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:00,402
"All right,"
nodded Essex.

293
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:02,606
"That's fine.

294
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:05,110
"But don't tell anybody
I told you...

295
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:07,740
"or I'll cut off
your ears."

296
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,580
He's a tough
character, Essex.

297
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:14,585
"Well, cross my heart
and hope you die,"

298
00:20:14,752 --> 00:20:15,962
replied Lightning fervently.

299
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:18,174
"Well, that's fine,"
replied Essex.

300
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:20,929
"Now, go home
and shut up."

301
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,769
"Or lose your ears,"
added Thunder.

302
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:29,985
And that's it.
Next chapter next week.

303
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:34,159
I'm going up Sumner, buying
a drink for some of the boys.

304
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,705
John, I was thinking
we might read aloud...

305
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:38,667
from the Good Book tonight.

306
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:41,713
It'll still
be good tomorrow.

307
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:44,718
All right, boys, up to bed.

308
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:46,222
Dad, come on.

309
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:47,724
Dad, could we please stay
up just a few more minutes?

310
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:49,811
Best do what
your ma says.

311
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:56,238
She ain't my ma.

312
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:57,450
Timothy.

313
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,203
What'd you say?

314
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,832
What'd you say,
Timothy?

315
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:04,753
What was that for?

316
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,923
That's so you don't get
to thinking like your brother.

317
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:08,759
Get on to bed now.

318
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:10,471
Get on to bed!

319
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:16,647
Sorry about that,
Mary, love.

320
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:21,113
I guess the boys
still miss her.

321
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,201
You do, too, I reckon.

322
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,293
You're damn right
I miss her. Pardon me.

323
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:32,550
Only natural. Only been gone
7 months... 7 months, 3 days.

324
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:40,312
I'm going to
that auction tomorrow.

325
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,943
Get that plot of land.

326
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:44,694
Does that mean
we're staying, then?

327
00:21:44,862 --> 00:21:46,323
Ain't no sense
of moving away.

328
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,328
I get Bradley's 5 acres, build
some bins out back, sell feed.

329
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:50,831
Make enough money,
in a few years,

330
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:52,375
we'll move to Gainesville,

331
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:56,339
open a bigger store, biggest
they ever seen in Florida.

332
00:21:56,507 --> 00:21:59,679
Did you ever consider
how I feel living here?

333
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:17,960
Why don't you go on
and have that drink?

334
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,306
You be all right
alone here New Year's?

335
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,776
I got Jesus with me.

336
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:52,059
Go ahead.

337
00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:54,146
There he is.

338
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:58,445
Gertie looks good.

339
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:01,867
Watch yourself,
there, Carter.

340
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,037
Watch yourself there.

341
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:06,542
I'm gonna cut a rug.

342
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,545
Cut a rug.

343
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:11,676
Go on, cut that rug,
but don't cut it too deep.

344
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:33,671
Come on.

345
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:38,889
Dance like he's riding
Booker T.

346
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:47,820
Twirl that man, Scrappie.

347
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,456
Listen here, now.
Y'all take notes, all right?

348
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:56,460
I don't want to have to
do this more than once.

349
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:58,922
Come on, man,
show him how to do it.

350
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:15,951
Sylvester can't
do no dancing.

351
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:21,084
Africa.

352
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,087
Africa.

353
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,298
Nigerian.

354
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:46,836
My arm!
My arm! My arm! My arm!

355
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:48,631
I got you. I got you.

356
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,212
I... I brung you
some coffee.

357
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,344
I'm sorry.

358
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:21,060
It's all right.

359
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:24,191
I shouldn't have
snuck up on you.

360
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:29,240
You ridin' out today?

361
00:25:33,414 --> 00:25:37,253
I might be here
a couple more days anyway.

362
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:41,303
Thinkin' about lookin' in on
that piece of land over there.

363
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:49,066
Bye.

364
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:03,006
Mornin', Mr. Mann.

365
00:26:03,172 --> 00:26:04,550
Mornin', boy.

366
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:07,471
Tomorrow's my birthday.
You gonna come to my party?

367
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:09,100
You gonna have cake?

368
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,353
Yes, sir, chocolate.

369
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:13,649
Why is she skippin'?

370
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:17,113
Good coffee.

371
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:36,438
Morning, Mr. Mann.

372
00:26:37,522 --> 00:26:40,194
Small town, people talk.

373
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:43,658
Old hangover remedy.

374
00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:45,411
My granddaddy
taught me.

375
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,833
Here's to the new year.

376
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:59,059
I'm sober now.

377
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:00,103
I'm sober now.

378
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:01,646
You got some peaches?

379
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:08,408
Story going around is you
was over there in the big one.

380
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,081
How long you fight?
Few months? A year?

381
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,338
I'm a veteran
myself, Navy.

382
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:18,843
Spanish-American War.

383
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:20,846
Of course, the ass we kicked
only took one day.

384
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:24,352
Steamed into Manila Bay
May 1, 1898,

385
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:28,859
aboard the gunboat Concord
under old George Dewey.

386
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:34,034
Set them 8-inch guns a-blazing
till smoke blotted out the sun.

387
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:37,290
Sunk the Spanish fleet,
steamed out May 2.

388
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,389
Only eight Americans
got wounded.

389
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:49,019
I had the audacity
to be one of them.

390
00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:53,401
Where were you? France?

391
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:55,488
Put my foots
in Germany, too.

392
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:56,531
Germany?

393
00:27:56,697 --> 00:27:58,534
I'd like to see
the Kaiser's face...

394
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:01,414
when you come runnin'
out of the Black Forest.

395
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:03,417
We didn't have
no coloreds on the Concord.

396
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:05,421
Whole ship
full of good ol' boys.

397
00:28:05,588 --> 00:28:06,924
Wouldn't have
took to it.

398
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:08,467
Maybe.

399
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,890
The mortars start flyin',

400
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:14,394
the gas start blowin',

401
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:16,314
there ain't much color
in them trenches.

402
00:28:16,482 --> 00:28:17,943
Is that right?

403
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:19,779
You got them.45s?

404
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:23,410
.45s. Funny thing
about the draft.

405
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,914
I can't understand it. Pull
a colored boy out of his home,

406
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:29,461
send him over there, tell him
dig trenches, kill white folks.

407
00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:32,049
That seem right to you?

408
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:35,596
I wouldn't know
much about that, sir.

409
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:38,059
I volunteered.

410
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:49,346
You been double-timing me.

411
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:57,277
Seeing that married Miz Connelly
over in Wylie.

412
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,728
I know.

413
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:08,406
Where you going?

414
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:10,283
Back to work.

415
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,915
Don't you turn
your back on me...

416
00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:15,959
when I talk!

417
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:22,930
Damn swamp tramp!

418
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:24,475
What you crying about?

419
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:27,813
What you think
you're doing, hitting me?

420
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,942
You little swamp tramp!

421
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,112
You little swamp tramp!

422
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,740
Huh? You little chigger!

423
00:30:33,907 --> 00:30:35,993
You don't hit me!

424
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:37,162
You don't hit me!

425
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,544
You don't hit me!

426
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:43,131
Girl...

427
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:46,344
Get out! Get out!

428
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,847
Get out!

429
00:31:02,163 --> 00:31:03,499
Philomena!

430
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,521
M-Miz Taylor?

431
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:20,443
Is you all right, ma'am?

432
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:24,993
Go away, Philomena.

433
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,079
B-But...

434
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:28,624
Get out.

435
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,210
Get out!

436
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:39,726
So you fight
in the war?

437
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:43,566
Kill anybody
over there?

438
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:47,280
I mostly dug trenches.

439
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,579
Still, it must've been
grand seeing Chicago...

440
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:52,873
and New York.

441
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:56,462
Shoot, I ain't been
nowhere but Rosewood,

442
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,466
Sumner, Cedar Key,

443
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:00,886
three times to Gainesville.

444
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:03,099
Why you come back south?

445
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,685
Maybe...

446
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:08,900
I was looking
for Rosewood.

447
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:17,038
Thank you.

448
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:23,425
Well, how come you ain't never
settled down before now?

449
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,431
I was married...

450
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:29,768
once.

451
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:37,949
My Aunt Sarah, she say
I ask too many questions.

452
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:39,160
I'm sorry if...

453
00:32:42,332 --> 00:32:43,918
How old you be,
Scrappie?

454
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:45,670
I'm 17.

455
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:47,215
No man?

456
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:49,929
- No young ones?
- No.

457
00:32:51,765 --> 00:32:55,229
I just take care of
my little cousins, though.

458
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:00,154
Come on.

459
00:33:01,697 --> 00:33:03,200
Come on.

460
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:04,786
Where you going?

461
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,422
What you think
about this land here?

462
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,427
Well, I...
I likes it fine.

463
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:16,055
Mr. Wright...

464
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:20,145
He going to buy it, though.
He buying up everything.

465
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:22,692
Maybe.

466
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,156
Hey, anybody!

467
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,660
Hey, boy!

468
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:58,794
Yes, sir.

469
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,255
You a traveling man?

470
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,804
Who asking, sir?

471
00:34:23,002 --> 00:34:24,337
We gots to help him.

472
00:34:24,505 --> 00:34:25,589
He ain't our problem.

473
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:27,843
He a Mason,
took the oath, same as us.

474
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,429
He's a white Mason.

475
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:34,354
Do you think
he'd help you?

476
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:35,773
Aaron, boy, I swear,

477
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,778
sometimes you ain't got more
sense than some of these horses.

478
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:40,406
Now, I'm telling you...

479
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:43,662
that man...

480
00:34:43,828 --> 00:34:45,790
he ain't nothing
but trouble.

481
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,378
Yeah, well, let me
tell you something.

482
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:49,713
See, I ain't no boy.

483
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,050
See, I's a man.

484
00:34:52,218 --> 00:34:53,887
I's a Mason.

485
00:34:54,053 --> 00:34:55,556
What you be, Sam?

486
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,991
Everybody sit down.
Let's get this done.

487
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:07,327
Bradley, you got the deed?

488
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:10,457
Uh, yes, sir, I do,
Mr. Andrews.

489
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:16,884
No, no, boy,
I haven't paid for it yet.

490
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:19,055
We got to sell it first.

491
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:22,185
Here. Give it here.
Give it here, boy.

492
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,027
We gots here 5 acres

493
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:29,030

Mr. Johnny Wright's store...

494
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:30,699
sold as is,
cash only.

495
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:32,535
Let's open up

496
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:36,167
52, 52. Who'll give me

497
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,670
53, 53, 53

498
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:39,756
54, 54, 54.

499
00:35:39,923 --> 00:35:40,758
Who'll give me 54?

500
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:42,636
54, 54.

501
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:44,764
John Wright again.
Thank you, John.

502
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:47,018
55, 55.

503
00:35:47,185 --> 00:35:49,439
55, anybody?
Monroe, 55?

504
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:51,609

505
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,238
Going once,
going twice...

506
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:55,116
$55.

507
00:35:57,494 --> 00:35:59,915
Boy, you know that's
$55 for each acre?

508
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,167
That's damn near $300.

509
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,422
Yes, sir, I do.

510
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:04,548
Thank you kindly.

511
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:05,967
Cash?

512
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:11,393
Where's that nigger going to get
that kind of money?

513
00:36:14,565 --> 00:36:15,900
I have $55.

514
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:55,134
Get back to work.

515
00:37:17,254 --> 00:37:19,800
Afternoon, Miss Fanny.

516
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:25,811
Help!

517
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,479
Help me!

518
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:30,526
Somebody please

519
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:31,945
Somebody!

520
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:33,364
Help me!

521
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,243
Help!

522
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,204
Help!

523
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:38,206
Please!

524
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:40,376
Help me!

525
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:41,628
What's the matter, now?

526
00:37:41,795 --> 00:37:43,883
Please help me!

527
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,677
Help me!

528
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:48,557
What's going on?
Fanny, what happened?

529
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:53,899
Nigger.

530
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,696
It was a nigger.

531
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:57,864
What?

532
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:00,494
He broke in my house,

533
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,499
and he beat me up.

534
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:06,128
It was a nigger!
It was!

535
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:12,597
Sheriff! Sheriff!

536
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:13,808
Here comes
that boy again.

537
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:14,810
That would be Emmett.

538
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:15,977
Sheriff!

539
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:17,856
Take a breath, boy.

540
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:18,857
What's the matter?

541
00:38:19,025 --> 00:38:21,278
Your daddy's still
caught on fire again?

542
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:23,867
Fanny Taylor got herself
beat by a nigra.

543
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,577
Oh, shit.

544
00:38:25,744 --> 00:38:27,038
Damn.

545
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:31,797
Earl, that
scatter gun loaded?

546
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:33,675
No.

547
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:35,261
Where the hell's my...
my shells?

548
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:36,680
Can't find my damn shells.

549
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:37,849
Here.

550
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:42,773
Go to the mill.
Get James.

551
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:44,360
Hold on!

552
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:50,287
Keep this quiet before
I get the whole story. Go.

553
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,872
- What's going on?
- Mind your own damn business.

554
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:52,999
Come on, boy.

555
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,960
When I want you
to do something...

556
00:38:55,128 --> 00:38:58,300
and I tell
you to do it...

557
00:38:58,467 --> 00:39:01,388
Fanny Taylor's been
raped by a nigger.

558
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:06,605
Go on out there
and do that!

559
00:39:15,162 --> 00:39:18,793
Hey, James, I need
to talk to you.

560
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,256
Your wife's been beat and raped
by a colored man.

561
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:25,720
What the hell
you talking about?

562
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,724
57.50.

563
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:29,435
$58.

564
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:34,402
58.50.

565
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:45,296
$60.

566
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:50,388
Boy, how you planning
on paying $300?

567
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,725
You got a bagful of gold?

568
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,770
Could be, sir.

569
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:55,980
Henry...

570
00:39:56,148 --> 00:39:57,483
can't you see
what this boy's doing?

571
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,069
He ain't going
to buy nothing.

572
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:02,158
He's just driving up the price
for old Bradley.

573
00:40:02,324 --> 00:40:05,288
Mr. Andrews, sir,
I don't know that man.

574
00:40:06,748 --> 00:40:09,211
With all due
respect, Mr. Wright...

575
00:40:10,297 --> 00:40:12,467
if that what you believe,

576
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:14,219
maybe you should
stop bidding.

577
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:17,183
You gonna let that nigger
beat you, Johnny?

578
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,103
60 goddamn 50.

579
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:25,822
A nigger raped
Fanny Taylor.

580
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,366
Listen up.

581
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:29,370
We got to call
this off for now.

582
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:31,625
What? I ain't going nowhere.
I got a bid in.

583
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,210
We'll pick it up
tomorrow at $60.50.

584
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:34,504
Let's get this done now.

585
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,258
John, Fanny Taylor's
been raped by a nigger.

586
00:40:37,425 --> 00:40:38,384
My deed.

587
00:40:38,552 --> 00:40:41,182
I'll lock up the deed.

588
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:43,602
Boy, your name
Jesse Hunter?

589
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:44,729
No, sir.

590
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:46,607
I suppose you
can prove that?

591
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:48,861
Got my discharge, sir.

592
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:09,271
Just who do you think
you are, boy?

593
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:12,025
With all due respect,
Mr. Wright,

594
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,780
long around
this time tomorrow,

595
00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:17,910
I expects to be
your neighbor, sir.

596
00:41:33,854 --> 00:41:35,565
Welcome to
Levy County, Mr. Mann.

597
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:37,736
Get out of the way.
Come on, back off, now.

598
00:41:37,902 --> 00:41:39,864
Come on, come on, come on.

599
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:43,077
Jesus, Fanny.

600
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,957
Who raped you?

601
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:49,756
No, jeez, Ellis,
I sure wasn't raped.

602
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:51,635
I just got beat.

603
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,972
I was beat badly.

604
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,974
Badly.

605
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:59,188
He was so big.

606
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:01,609
He's so black,
that boy.

607
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:03,988
She says she was raped.

608
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,156
Raped and beat.

609
00:42:05,324 --> 00:42:07,494
Shut up, y'all!
Everybody go on out of here!

610
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:09,748
Show's over!
You heard me!

611
00:42:09,915 --> 00:42:11,334
Go on home!

612
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:12,920
Go on!

613
00:42:13,087 --> 00:42:14,089
Come on.

614
00:42:15,174 --> 00:42:16,552
Let's go in the house.

615
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:18,054
It's OK.

616
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,474
It's all right.

617
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:23,688
It's OK. Come on!
Give her some breathing space!

618
00:42:23,897 --> 00:42:25,148
Damn.

619
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:27,444
Listen to me.

620
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,491
We've known each other
a long time, huh?

621
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:32,411
I want you to think
about this, now.

622
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:33,871
You tell me.

623
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:36,710
This is Ellis.
You tell me the truth.

624
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:40,299
Was it truly a colored
that done this to you?

625
00:42:40,466 --> 00:42:42,678
Be sure, darling,
that is all I'm saying.

626
00:42:42,846 --> 00:42:45,767
Yes, he was colored.

627
00:42:45,934 --> 00:42:49,063
He was a nigger,
nigger, nigger!

628
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,737
Jesus, angel,
what happened?

629
00:43:07,888 --> 00:43:10,142
You seen
this boy, Sarah?

630
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:15,943
Ain't got to mess around. We
got to do something about this.

631
00:43:17,904 --> 00:43:19,741
No, Mr. Ellis.

632
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:21,577
I ain't seen nothing.

633
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:25,626
All right.

634
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:32,596
Hey, what y'all doing?

635
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:35,810
Miss Fanny... Miss Fanny Taylor,
she got raped.

636
00:43:35,977 --> 00:43:37,271
- And beat.
- And she got beat,

637
00:43:37,437 --> 00:43:38,773
and she said it was
a colored man.

638
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,442
But it was a cracker.
I seen him.

639
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,991
Well, I guess now we're looking
for a nigger convict,

640
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:47,413
escaped yesterday
off the chain gang near Wylie.

641
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,751
Name is Jesse Hunter.

642
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,840
Oh, good.
Here are the hounds.

643
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,720
Take them all around back,
pick up a scent.

644
00:43:56,886 --> 00:43:58,347
Go on.

645
00:43:58,515 --> 00:44:01,353
You acting like you the leader
of this here mob.

646
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,940
I am the leader,
and this ain't no mob!

647
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:10,994
We got him, boys.

648
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:12,539
See where they're headed?

649
00:44:12,705 --> 00:44:14,584
Y'all see where
they're headed?

650
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:17,880
Come on, boy.

651
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:23,432
Shut up, y'all!
They got a scent!

652
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,268
Hush.

653
00:44:25,435 --> 00:44:27,104
Go have a look.
Y'all go that way.

654
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:43,048
He ain't done nothing!

655
00:44:46,136 --> 00:44:47,597
What did the boy do?

656
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:49,226
Y'all be quiet!
Be quiet!

657
00:44:49,392 --> 00:44:51,062
Poly! Poly!

658
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,106
Put that gun away!

659
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,111
- This is serious business.
- Yes, sir.

660
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,781
You got to tell me
the truth, boy.

661
00:44:57,949 --> 00:44:59,200
Did you rape
Fanny Taylor?

662
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:00,929
- Rape?
- No, sir! No!

663
00:45:01,096 --> 00:45:02,598
Do you know who did?

664
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:03,557
I don't know nothing,
Mr. Walker!

665
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:05,227
You know who did!

666
00:45:05,394 --> 00:45:06,855
Go!

667
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,112
My boy ain't done nothing!

668
00:45:24,426 --> 00:45:27,849
Hey! Here comes
old Johnny Wright.

669
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:29,351
Hello, Johnny.

670
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,562
Hey, Bobby.

671
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,400
John.

672
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:34,902
How's that new wife
of yours working out?

673
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:36,572
She's coming
right along.

674
00:45:36,738 --> 00:45:38,951
Sorry about that auction, John.
The boy bid.

675
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,829
Yeah, a hell of a thing.
What you got here?

676
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:42,457
Now we got
a good one.

677
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:45,462
That boy raped
Fanny Taylor.

678
00:45:45,628 --> 00:45:46,547
Is that right?

679
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:49,844
We got us
Aaron Carrier, John.

680
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:50,971
Aaron Carrier?

681
00:45:51,137 --> 00:45:53,057
Watch that gun, boy.

682
00:45:53,225 --> 00:45:54,058
How you doing, Johnny?

683
00:45:54,226 --> 00:45:55,479
You got the wrong boy.

684
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:57,398
Hate to tell you, Aaron Carrier
wouldn't rape a fly.

685
00:45:57,566 --> 00:45:58,942
Dogs led us
straight to his house.

686
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,571
You know the boy that did?

687
00:46:00,737 --> 00:46:03,200
Nigger won't talk,
either, John.

688
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:04,619
I know his family.

689
00:46:04,785 --> 00:46:06,372
Let me talk to him.

690
00:46:06,538 --> 00:46:08,124
Yeah, hell, maybe you can
get something out of him.

691
00:46:08,334 --> 00:46:09,585
I sure as hell can't.

692
00:46:09,753 --> 00:46:11,964
Aaron, this is Mr. Wright.

693
00:46:12,132 --> 00:46:13,342
You know something
about all this?

694
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:16,180
Duke, how's he
supposed to talk

695
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:17,474
when you're choking him
like that?

696
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:18,893
Well, he don't need
to talk, Johnny.

697
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,604
He need to hang from
one of them trees over there.

698
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:23,692
Y'all think
this is real funny?

699
00:46:23,902 --> 00:46:26,239
Hey, you would, too, if you was
the one that sold me this rope.

700
00:46:27,658 --> 00:46:29,118
Good point, John.

701
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,456
He's a good boy.

702
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,708
He ain't done nothing.

703
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:34,001
Duke, don't hurt him.

704
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:36,590
Emmett, come on over here, boy.
Hold onto this rope.

705
00:46:36,756 --> 00:46:38,217
There's a boy.

706
00:46:38,384 --> 00:46:39,594
You know this boy's
family as well as I.

707
00:46:39,761 --> 00:46:41,014
That's right.
I do. I know.

708
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,015
And you know
he's a good boy.

709
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:43,351
They're good people.
They're good people,

710
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:45,187
but we got a dilemma
here, John.

711
00:46:45,355 --> 00:46:48,067
We got a dilemma. I'm going
to tell you what it is.

712
00:46:48,235 --> 00:46:49,737
Hounds don't lie.

713
00:46:49,903 --> 00:46:50,822
Be a man, now.

714
00:46:50,989 --> 00:46:53,827
You got to take that rope
and snap, crack.

715
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:56,874
Can't lynch that boy, Ellis.
Can't lynch him.

716
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,128
I ain't going to let
nobody get hanged.

717
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:01,089
I ain't going to let it happen.
It won't happen.

718
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:03,010
Now grab that rope.
Come on, grab it.

719
00:47:03,176 --> 00:47:06,390
About 4 summers ago,
I went over to Chiefland.

720
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,728
A colored boy over there
was looking in the window...

721
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:11,398
at a white girl
watching her take a bath.

722
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:12,734
Did he say something?

723
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:14,571
No, he didn't.

724
00:47:14,779 --> 00:47:16,157
Maybe he don't know nothing
if he didn't say nothing.

725
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:20,581
You should have seen them
go crazy on that boy.

726
00:47:20,747 --> 00:47:22,792
Beat him
about half to death.

727
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:24,378
Boy wouldn't stop
screaming.

728
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:26,632
We helped him to the railroad
track. Number 7 come along...

729
00:47:28,636 --> 00:47:30,223
cut his head clean off.

730
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,977
Niggers don't run around
like a chicken.

731
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:35,438
Once that head's off,
he's dead.

732
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:40,555
S-Sam Carter.

733
00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:41,974
Sam Carter?

734
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:43,811
What about Sam Carter?

735
00:47:43,977 --> 00:47:45,272
What about Sam?

736
00:47:45,438 --> 00:47:46,273
Sam the blacksmith?

737
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,400
Sam Carter
raped Fanny Taylor?

738
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:49,153
No.

739
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,781
A man. A Mason.

740
00:47:50,906 --> 00:47:52,576
What man?
Who you talking about?

741
00:47:52,784 --> 00:47:54,746
Sam took him in the wagon.

742
00:47:54,912 --> 00:47:56,331
We was holding the oath.

743
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:57,709
What are you
talking about?

744
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:59,294
String him up!

745
00:48:02,926 --> 00:48:04,470
This boy's under arrest!
I'm taking him to jail!

746
00:48:04,637 --> 00:48:05,514
We're going to string
this boy up.

747
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,933
Oh, no, you ain't!

748
00:48:07,142 --> 00:48:08,936
All right, take the boy,
but don't you let him go.

749
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:10,940
Hey, don't you worry about
what I am or ain't going to do!

750
00:48:11,107 --> 00:48:12,442
You hear me, Poly?

751
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:14,237
- We're going to get Sam.
- You get on out of here!

752
00:48:14,404 --> 00:48:17,075
Do you understand?
You go do it!

753
00:48:17,242 --> 00:48:19,454
Hey, listen to me.
You go with them.

754
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,166
Don't let them do nothing until
I get there, you hear me?

755
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:24,296
You go, too.
Ellis, you go.

756
00:48:24,504 --> 00:48:25,965
I'll take old Aaron in.

757
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:28,761
Them boys is all riled.

758
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:30,640
Aaron, this is
all your damn fault!

759
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,018
You should've said
something earlier!

760
00:48:32,184 --> 00:48:34,730
Damn!

761
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:45,665
Carter! Carter!

762
00:48:49,547 --> 00:48:51,008
Hey, Booker T.

763
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:54,805
Up, boy. Up.

764
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,491
Thank you, Mr. Wright.

765
00:50:09,098 --> 00:50:11,018
Sam, what you know about
this Jesse Hunter, boy?

766
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:12,436
I don't know nothing,
Mr. Andrews!

767
00:50:12,604 --> 00:50:14,607
All niggers don't know nothing!
Where's Jesse Hunter?

768
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:16,444
Mr. Purdy. Mr. Purdy.

769
00:50:16,651 --> 00:50:19,615
You a Mason.
You got to believe me.

770
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,494
I don't know
no Jesse Hunter!

771
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,124
Yeah, you do,
you damn nigger!

772
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:35,016
Come on, let him go!

773
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:37,186
Come on! Hold it! Come on!

774
00:50:37,354 --> 00:50:39,649
He's not against you!
Stop it! Stop it!

775
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:41,861
You shut up and get away!

776
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:43,614
Sam! Get up!

777
00:50:43,781 --> 00:50:46,034
Talk now!

778
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:48,205
Talk to me, Sam!

779
00:50:48,372 --> 00:50:49,791
Talk to me.

780
00:50:51,127 --> 00:50:52,463
Better say something.

781
00:50:52,629 --> 00:50:54,048
As...

782
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:57,346
as God is my witness,

783
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:58,514
I don't know...

784
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,225
Jesse Hunter.

785
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:02,813
It was that drifter. That rich
nigger from the auction!

786
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,735
That big buck
with the black horse,

787
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:07,697
is that him?

788
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:13,573
Come on, let him talk.

789
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,245
Damn you!

790
00:51:16,412 --> 00:51:18,457
Look at me!

791
00:51:18,624 --> 00:51:21,546
Aaron told us
you gave him a ride!

792
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,798
Now you show me
where you put him out!

793
00:51:24,008 --> 00:51:26,929
Show me, Sam.
I can get you out of here.

794
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:28,892
Show me, boy.

795
00:51:29,057 --> 00:51:29,893
You going to show me?

796
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:30,978
We going to string you up.

797
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:32,898
Let's go. Get up.

798
00:51:33,064 --> 00:51:34,400
Let's go. Get up.

799
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:38,949
If we don't pick up
his trail where you say,

800
00:51:39,117 --> 00:51:41,370
you one dead
black son of a bitch.

801
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:46,505
What you got, Earl?

802
00:51:47,547 --> 00:51:48,674
Nothing, Ellis.

803
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:50,219
Nothing?

804
00:51:56,187 --> 00:51:58,107
Y-you can kill me...

805
00:51:59,443 --> 00:52:01,071
but you all...

806
00:52:01,237 --> 00:52:02,490
you can't eat me.

807
00:52:02,657 --> 00:52:05,118
You ain't
no Seminole, boy.

808
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,458
Duke.

809
00:52:08,624 --> 00:52:10,461
Get back! Get back!

810
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,715
Damn it, Duke!

811
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:13,883
What'd you do that for?

812
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:15,053
Goddamn, Duke.

813
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,557
Dumb son of a bitch.

814
00:52:17,723 --> 00:52:19,810
You could've killed me!

815
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:21,145
He's sure dead.

816
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:23,315
He ain't dead.

817
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:26,321
Well, let's
clean this mess up.

818
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:30,287
Hang him up in this tree
over here.

819
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:34,961
OK, men, I've had
enough of this!

820
00:52:35,128 --> 00:52:36,755
I'm the law here,
you hear me?

821
00:52:36,922 --> 00:52:37,923
Let me in here!

822
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:39,260
Back off now!

823
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:40,554
Let me in there!

824
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:45,478
Stop it, y'all!
Stop it!

825
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:48,483
A white woman
was beat and raped...

826
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,986
by a colored boy!

827
00:52:50,153 --> 00:52:52,449
Now, you want to tell
her husband, her children,

828
00:52:52,657 --> 00:52:56,080
that this boy don't
have to pay for that?

829
00:52:57,666 --> 00:52:59,335
I'm supposed
to uphold the law!

830
00:52:59,502 --> 00:53:00,588
Aw, law!

831
00:53:00,754 --> 00:53:02,256
Whose law, nigger law?

832
00:53:02,424 --> 00:53:04,303
You wasn't nothing but
a damn chicken farmer...

833
00:53:04,469 --> 00:53:06,848
till they gave you
that stupid badge!

834
00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:08,601
You want to get re-elected?

835
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,688
You want
to get re-elected?

836
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:12,900
- Leave me alone!
- Then leave it be!

837
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:19,160
I got your watch,
Sam Carter!

838
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,788
I got your watch!

839
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:41,322
You're always so gentle.

840
00:53:44,035 --> 00:53:45,538
Soft touch.

841
00:53:47,417 --> 00:53:49,796
You treat me like
I'm some kind of angel.

842
00:53:49,962 --> 00:53:52,800
You are
an angel to me.

843
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:54,888
I'm just a woman, James.

844
00:53:56,348 --> 00:53:57,767
I'm just a woman.

845
00:53:59,729 --> 00:54:03,319
Things are getting crazy
out there, Fanny.

846
00:54:03,485 --> 00:54:04,905
They're likely
to get worse.

847
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:06,657
Sam Carter's
lynched already.

848
00:54:06,824 --> 00:54:08,870
The blacksmith?

849
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:09,871
What'd he do?

850
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,167
He give that nigger a ride.

851
00:54:12,334 --> 00:54:14,295
A ride?

852
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:17,009
Sam Carter?

853
00:54:18,761 --> 00:54:20,221
I didn't know.

854
00:54:32,492 --> 00:54:35,122
There's things that
I ought to tell you.

855
00:54:39,964 --> 00:54:41,633
Evening, Mr. Taylor.

856
00:54:42,677 --> 00:54:46,557
With all that's going on
and everything,

857
00:54:46,725 --> 00:54:49,020
we thought y'all could use
some hot cooking.

858
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:53,444
Thank you kindly, ladies, but
my wife ain't feeling too well.

859
00:54:53,612 --> 00:54:55,573
It's all right, James.

860
00:54:56,908 --> 00:54:59,121
Evening, Miss Walker.

861
00:54:59,288 --> 00:55:00,874
Oh, Fanny...

862
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:04,004
you poor child.

863
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,510
Oh, I brought you
a quilt, too.

864
00:55:07,676 --> 00:55:09,137
I brought you
sweetbread.

865
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,186
Don't you worry.
That nigger going to be dead...

866
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:15,649
before you
finish your pie, OK?

867
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:41,860
Get a wagon.

868
00:56:23,221 --> 00:56:27,895
Now, me and Mr. Mann just cut
Sam Carter out a damn tree.

869
00:56:28,062 --> 00:56:29,398
Y'all hear me?

870
00:56:29,565 --> 00:56:32,319
Dirty, low-down
bastards...

871
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:34,115
took my boy.

872
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:35,950
They got my cousin
Aaron over in jail.

873
00:56:36,118 --> 00:56:37,955
There's Sumner
behind this business.

874
00:56:38,121 --> 00:56:39,290
They say it's for
his own protection.

875
00:56:39,498 --> 00:56:41,668
Now how that sound?

876
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:44,299
What we need to do, we need
to pray. Now, dear Lord...

877
00:56:44,466 --> 00:56:46,677
I ain't in no praying mood,
preacher.

878
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:48,430
Now, what I want to
know is right now,

879
00:56:48,597 --> 00:56:51,185
what y'all mens prepared to do
if they run back here?

880
00:56:51,393 --> 00:56:54,899
Not if, Sylvester. When.

881
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:56,194
I'm goin' to shoot.

882
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,448
Come on, sit down now,
Big Baby.

883
00:57:05,835 --> 00:57:07,713
You by yourself
there, Mr. Wright?

884
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,299
I am, Sylvester.

885
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:16,227
Sylvester, them crackers
so riled up,

886
00:57:16,394 --> 00:57:17,480
we don't know
what they going to do.

887
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:19,065
They don't know what
they goin' to do.

888
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:21,236
That's how
a lynch mob be.

889
00:57:23,114 --> 00:57:25,868
Now, I say we send
the women and children...

890
00:57:26,035 --> 00:57:28,331
to Gainesville right now.

891
00:57:28,498 --> 00:57:30,752
John, we can't go nowhere
and leave that boy in jail.

892
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,172
No! Them dirty bastards...

893
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:35,677
can take my boy
out of that jail...

894
00:57:35,844 --> 00:57:38,390
and hang him whenever
they take a notion.

895
00:57:38,557 --> 00:57:39,808
Don't worry about it,
Uncle.

896
00:57:39,976 --> 00:57:42,187
We ain't going nowhere.

897
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:44,190
We ain't going nowhere,
Bradley.

898
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:46,195
Now, we own this here land.

899
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:48,282
We pay taxes on it.

900
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:49,950
Now, we don't bother
nobody around here.

901
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:51,996
We keep to ourselves.

902
00:57:52,163 --> 00:57:54,041
Now, colored folk just
can't be running all the time.

903
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,544
There comes a time
when you got to stand up...

904
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,712
and defend your rights.

905
00:57:56,879 --> 00:57:59,050
Sylvester! Sylvester!
Listen to me. And you listen.

906
00:57:59,216 --> 00:58:00,469
Hold on there
for a minute.

907
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:01,554
We got to think about
these here children.

908
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,767
Oh, I am thinking about
the children, preacher.

909
00:58:03,974 --> 00:58:07,021
Now, you suppose they thinking
about our children?

910
00:58:14,493 --> 00:58:15,536
Mr. Mann.

911
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:22,005
If there be some trouble
around here, sir,

912
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:24,092
we could sure use
your help.

913
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:27,138
I just came
from one war, friend.

914
00:58:27,306 --> 00:58:29,184
I ain't looking
for another one.

915
00:58:29,392 --> 00:58:31,270
Let him go, Sylvester.

916
00:58:31,437 --> 00:58:32,773
For all we know,
he could have been...

917
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,025
the one that done this thing.

918
00:58:34,192 --> 00:58:36,488
They said it was... they said
it was a stranger anyhow.

919
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:38,951
You're talking crazy
now, preacher.

920
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:46,839
I wish y'all luck.

921
00:58:55,238 --> 00:58:56,656
He ain't done nothing.

922
00:58:56,823 --> 00:58:58,744
What was that,
Aunt Sarah?

923
00:59:01,873 --> 00:59:06,173
Mr. Wright, would you
kindly excuse us, sir?

924
00:59:17,524 --> 00:59:19,236
I seen his face.

925
00:59:19,445 --> 00:59:21,239
He was white as butter.

926
00:59:21,448 --> 00:59:23,786
What?

927
00:59:27,959 --> 00:59:31,173
This what they teach you
in the Army?

928
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,678
Pack up and run
when things get hot?

929
00:59:34,846 --> 00:59:36,224
Thank God the Navy
don't let in...

930
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:40,897
What? Go on and
say it, Mr. Wright.

931
00:59:41,107 --> 00:59:44,237
Thank God the Navy
don't let in niggers.

932
00:59:45,823 --> 00:59:47,910
I was going
to say cowards.

933
00:59:48,077 --> 00:59:49,955
That's right.
I got you figured, Mann.

934
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:51,499
You one of them
loud boys, big talk.

935
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:53,127
Figure you can say anything
to a white man...

936
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:55,630
as long as you start out saying,
"With all due respect."

937
00:59:57,098 --> 00:59:59,561
First sign of trouble,
you duckin' your head running.

938
00:59:58,226 --> 00:59:59,729
What you going to do...

939
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:01,733
when that mob come
down the road?

940
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,320
You going to grab up
your rifle,

941
01:00:03,486 --> 01:00:04,781
defend colored folk?

942
01:00:04,988 --> 01:00:06,199
What you care?

943
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:09,205
Man does what he has to.
Ain't that right?

944
01:00:09,371 --> 01:00:10,790
Just like a colored boy
back from the war...

945
01:00:10,957 --> 01:00:12,334
with a pocketful of money.

946
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:14,588
Ain't that right?

947
01:00:14,755 --> 01:00:17,176
You the massa
of Rosewood, huh?

948
01:00:17,342 --> 01:00:18,302
Say, boy...

949
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,805
these people know me.

950
01:00:19,973 --> 01:00:21,517
They trust me.

951
01:00:28,069 --> 01:00:30,448
How long you live here,
Mr. Wright?

952
01:00:30,615 --> 01:00:32,493
Nine years.

953
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:39,046
I been in Rosewood
one night...

954
01:00:39,213 --> 01:00:41,884
they asking me to stay.

955
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:44,638
Now, you pack up
your truck...

956
01:00:44,848 --> 01:00:47,686
see who tries to stop you
from leaving.

957
01:01:09,723 --> 01:01:10,683
You wasn't going
to say nothing.

958
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:12,227
You was just going
to leave me?

959
01:01:12,393 --> 01:01:14,856
Three, four weeks,
this all blow over.

960
01:01:15,024 --> 01:01:16,317
Then I come back.

961
01:01:16,485 --> 01:01:18,863
But I thought we...

962
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:22,035
Why, I didn't think you was
just going to run off, is all.

963
01:01:22,202 --> 01:01:23,079
Ain't you a soldier?

964
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:24,205
Scrappie.

965
01:01:30,006 --> 01:01:31,550
Them boys looking
for a colored man...

966
01:01:31,718 --> 01:01:34,056
ain't nobody seen
around here before.

967
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:35,224
Now, ain't no way
in the world...

968
01:01:35,432 --> 01:01:37,895
one man got enough bullets
for all them crackers.

969
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:39,731
Your own preacher
ready to serve me up.

970
01:01:39,899 --> 01:01:42,821
But if I stay,
I'm asking to be hung.

971
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:51,127
Look here.

972
01:02:07,362 --> 01:02:09,991
They give me this
for saving lives.

973
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,709
Most important thing
anybody ever give to me.

974
01:02:15,876 --> 01:02:18,589
You keep it for me.

975
01:02:20,133 --> 01:02:23,055
Hold on to it
till I get back.

976
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:26,853
Now, can you do that
for me, darling?

977
01:04:01,012 --> 01:04:02,680
Morning, Judge.

978
01:04:23,717 --> 01:04:27,223
Multiple gunshot wounds.

979
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,393
Missing ear...

980
01:04:30,562 --> 01:04:32,064
fingers...

981
01:04:33,567 --> 01:04:36,906
various other parts.

982
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:42,123
By Jesus, your boys really
got to this one, huh, Ellis?

983
01:04:46,045 --> 01:04:48,425
Yes, they did, sir.

984
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:57,858
Levy County is growing.

985
01:04:58,025 --> 01:04:59,652
We need us
a sheriff up here...

986
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,823
who can handle
these nigger problems.

987
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:06,038
Is that you, Ellis?

988
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:07,750
Now hold on, Judge.

989
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:12,007
Oh, I think I got everything
under control now, Judge.

990
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:13,342
I hope so.

991
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,012
We ain't talking about...

992
01:05:15,137 --> 01:05:17,349
breaking up fights
on Saturday night.

993
01:05:17,517 --> 01:05:18,684
You can't control
your colored,

994
01:05:18,852 --> 01:05:21,606
we're going to replace you
with someone who can.

995
01:05:21,774 --> 01:05:22,608
Cause of death:

996
01:05:22,817 --> 01:05:25,321
"Mischief at hands unknown..."

997
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,449
Write that down, Earl.

998
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,287
All right now!
Get on in here!

999
01:05:30,454 --> 01:05:31,665
Fall in here, everybody!

1000
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:35,004
Now, hush up!

1001
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:38,134
Everybody, come on, now!
Don't lollygag!

1002
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,889
I want to give you
a day off.

1003
01:05:41,055 --> 01:05:42,141
What's that, Boots?

1004
01:05:43,476 --> 01:05:45,313
He says you
got the day off.

1005
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:46,649
All right!

1006
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:48,819
That colored boy
what assaulted Fanny Taylor,

1007
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,989
he's still out there
somewhere.

1008
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:52,576
So I'm gonna give you
the day off...

1009
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:54,704
so you can go help
with the search.

1010
01:05:54,871 --> 01:05:57,249
All I expect is...

1011
01:05:57,417 --> 01:05:59,128
if you find him...

1012
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,922
well, you know what to do.

1013
01:06:17,114 --> 01:06:18,325
Oh, Lord, Auntie,

1014
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:20,744
they're likely to come
in here and kill us all.

1015
01:06:20,912 --> 01:06:23,459
You got to tell them
that man was white.

1016
01:06:23,624 --> 01:06:24,961
Child, you don't think...

1017
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:27,174
they going to listen
to old Aunt Sarah?

1018
01:06:27,339 --> 01:06:30,179
They'd just as soon as
string me up...

1019
01:06:30,344 --> 01:06:32,015
like they done Sam Carter.

1020
01:06:32,182 --> 01:06:36,981
You ain't never seen crackers
act the way I know.

1021
01:06:37,148 --> 01:06:40,653
When I was a little girl,
about 7,

1022
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:45,036
still on the Willowbrook
plantation...

1023
01:06:45,204 --> 01:06:51,756
old massa's son stole $20
out of the family chest...

1024
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:55,012
for a cockfight.

1025
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,098
Massa knew he took it.

1026
01:06:57,265 --> 01:07:01,732
As blue as Jesus' eyes,
he knew.

1027
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:05,570
But just the same...

1028
01:07:05,738 --> 01:07:09,869
he whipped my daddy
half to death.

1029
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:16,882
It don't matter what man
was beating on Fanny Taylor.

1030
01:07:17,049 --> 01:07:19,177
Nigger.

1031
01:07:19,345 --> 01:07:21,723
It's just another word
for guilty.

1032
01:07:27,316 --> 01:07:28,484
Here you go.

1033
01:07:28,652 --> 01:07:29,695
Thank you, Mr. Bryce.

1034
01:07:29,862 --> 01:07:31,197
You're welcome.

1035
01:07:31,364 --> 01:07:33,827
You're a nice gentleman.

1036
01:07:35,746 --> 01:07:38,751
Look, why don't you get your
peoples on board, Aunt Sarah?

1037
01:07:38,961 --> 01:07:40,547
Take them up
to Gainesville for a while.

1038
01:07:40,713 --> 01:07:42,383
Don't much like the looks
of things around here.

1039
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,594
Things been
looking the same...

1040
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,807
as long as I can remember,
Mr. Bryce.

1041
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:53,318
You take care of yourself.

1042
01:07:56,699 --> 01:07:57,951
Take that.

1043
01:07:58,118 --> 01:07:59,370
Put it on the side there.

1044
01:07:59,537 --> 01:08:00,748
Board!

1045
01:08:16,732 --> 01:08:18,069
Sylvester?

1046
01:08:18,235 --> 01:08:20,197
- Go inside the depot, Mama.
- Sylvester!

1047
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:21,574
Mama, it's all right.

1048
01:08:21,742 --> 01:08:22,701
Mama, go on.

1049
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,538
Johnny.

1050
01:08:24,746 --> 01:08:25,873
Sylvester!

1051
01:08:26,082 --> 01:08:28,044
Do you know the whereabouts
of this Jesse Hunter?

1052
01:08:28,253 --> 01:08:29,921
I do not.

1053
01:08:30,089 --> 01:08:31,925
You arrest that man
who kill Sam Carter yet?

1054
01:08:32,092 --> 01:08:34,471
Don't you get
uppity with me.

1055
01:08:34,638 --> 01:08:36,350
I've come to warn you.

1056
01:08:36,516 --> 01:08:37,643
There are some boys
over there in Sumner...

1057
01:08:37,811 --> 01:08:39,187
let on if they was you,

1058
01:08:39,355 --> 01:08:41,316
they wouldn't let sundown
catch them around here.

1059
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:44,655
Well,
they ain't me... sir.

1060
01:08:48,787 --> 01:08:49,913
Why don't you be
a good boy...

1061
01:08:50,123 --> 01:08:51,916
and go visit some
of your other relatives...

1062
01:08:52,084 --> 01:08:53,377
for a little while, huh?

1063
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,635
I am trying
to help you here.

1064
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:01,267
They're all over there right now
getting all full of liquor...

1065
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:03,854
and making nooses.

1066
01:09:04,856 --> 01:09:07,193
You hear me!
Huh?

1067
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:08,904
Sheriff...

1068
01:09:09,113 --> 01:09:10,364
If you really
want to help...

1069
01:09:10,532 --> 01:09:11,742
I appreciate it
if you wouldn't allow...

1070
01:09:11,909 --> 01:09:14,873
them boys to come
'round here.

1071
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,627
Now, I was born and raised
in Rosewood.

1072
01:09:17,836 --> 01:09:18,838
This here is my home.

1073
01:09:19,005 --> 01:09:22,218
And I'll be damned if I let
anybody run me off it.

1074
01:09:23,888 --> 01:09:25,724
Now, you can tell
them boys that.

1075
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:31,485
Tell them
your damn self.

1076
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:36,868
Damn colored fool.

1077
01:09:46,509 --> 01:09:47,678
Go home, Mama.

1078
01:09:54,348 --> 01:09:55,558
You're gonna have to
settle your account...

1079
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:58,021
before I can
sell you the shells.

1080
01:10:02,152 --> 01:10:03,948
Want me
to settle the account?

1081
01:10:04,115 --> 01:10:05,659
That's right.

1082
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,414
All right.

1083
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:12,671
Go home, Jewel.

1084
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,806
Girl, you best
get out of this store.

1085
01:10:18,973 --> 01:10:20,309
She belongs here.
She belongs right here.

1086
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:22,604
Do you see
how you do my cousin?

1087
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:25,443
Get out this store
right now, Jewel! Get!

1088
01:10:27,362 --> 01:10:28,740
Can't you listen
to nobody?

1089
01:10:28,906 --> 01:10:31,369
Sheriff give you good advice.
Why ain't you leaving?

1090
01:10:31,535 --> 01:10:33,539
I thought you a smart boy,
Sylvester.

1091
01:10:33,706 --> 01:10:34,958
I thought you
a smart boy.

1092
01:10:36,545 --> 01:10:38,297
Here is your money,
Mr. Wright.

1093
01:10:38,506 --> 01:10:41,678
That should settle
my account.

1094
01:10:41,844 --> 01:10:43,139
Sylvester...

1095
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:45,517
Dumb...

1096
01:10:45,984 --> 01:10:46,986
Hurry up!

1097
01:10:57,204 --> 01:10:59,207
Here come them boys.

1098
01:11:03,714 --> 01:11:04,800
They ain't got nothing.

1099
01:11:05,718 --> 01:11:07,053
What'd you find?

1100
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,765
Snakes and ticks.

1101
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:11,728
Them colored folks
got to be hiding that nigger.

1102
01:11:13,731 --> 01:11:15,067
What time is it,
anyway?

1103
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:19,241
Well, let's see...
by old Sam Carter.

1104
01:11:21,244 --> 01:11:23,748
Bourbon time.

1105
01:11:26,002 --> 01:11:27,964
I'll tell you, boys.

1106
01:11:28,131 --> 01:11:29,717
If anybody's hiding
Jesse Hunter,

1107
01:11:29,883 --> 01:11:31,762
my money's
on Sylvester Carrier.

1108
01:11:31,928 --> 01:11:34,016
That nigger,
he hates us white folk.

1109
01:11:34,182 --> 01:11:35,184
He does.

1110
01:11:35,351 --> 01:11:37,146
You know,
he's got a piano.

1111
01:11:37,354 --> 01:11:39,817
A nigger
with a goddamn piano.

1112
01:11:39,984 --> 01:11:41,863
I've been working
all my life,

1113
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:43,907
I ain't got a piano.

1114
01:11:44,074 --> 01:11:46,119
You don't know
how to play one.

1115
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:47,413
That ain't the point.

1116
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,043
Old man Cummer,
up in that house of his,

1117
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:51,628
he's got a piano.

1118
01:11:51,795 --> 01:11:54,342
That nigger's got one,
and I don't.

1119
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:55,510
Now, how does that look?

1120
01:11:55,719 --> 01:11:57,638
Yeah, and he's married
to that white woman.

1121
01:11:57,805 --> 01:11:58,933
Gertrude ain't white.

1122
01:11:59,099 --> 01:12:00,143
Hell, she look white.

1123
01:12:00,311 --> 01:12:01,395
Well, she ain't.

1124
01:12:01,562 --> 01:12:05,068
She's half Negress,
half-Seminole Indian.

1125
01:12:05,235 --> 01:12:06,196
He says.

1126
01:12:06,362 --> 01:12:08,991
It wouldn't surprise me
if he was hiding that bastard.

1127
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:10,744
Hey, Judge.

1128
01:12:19,885 --> 01:12:21,095
I tell you, Duke.

1129
01:12:21,261 --> 01:12:22,890
Can I get that bottle?

1130
01:12:46,513 --> 01:12:47,932
Go ahead now,
make a wish.

1131
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,312
Blow the candles out.

1132
01:12:57,991 --> 01:12:59,910
Open this one first, Arnett.
Open that one.

1133
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:12,557
Oh, yeah,
that's nice, Mama.

1134
01:13:12,724 --> 01:13:14,018
Yeah, that's real nice.

1135
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:17,148
You're a man now.
You need a suit of clothes.

1136
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:32,423
Arnett, open this one here
and that one, too.

1137
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:35,178
Sylvester got that one.

1138
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,450
Simmer down.
Be quiet!

1139
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:55,964
Sylvester, come on
out here now, boy.

1140
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,340
We want to talk
to you.

1141
01:13:57,508 --> 01:13:59,971
Bring that Jesse Hunter
on out here with you.

1142
01:14:00,137 --> 01:14:02,182
Yeah, that's right.
Bring that boy with you.

1143
01:14:02,391 --> 01:14:04,395
Jesse and Sylvester are probably
sitting up in there.

1144
01:14:04,602 --> 01:14:06,231
Shut up
that damn dog.

1145
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,026
Sittin' up there now
eating pork chops.

1146
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:10,655
Laughing at us all.

1147
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:11,906
Goddamn, Duke!

1148
01:14:13,409 --> 01:14:15,872
Son of a...

1149
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:18,084
You had no call
to do that.

1150
01:14:18,293 --> 01:14:19,545
It's just a damn dog,
Ellis.

1151
01:14:19,712 --> 01:14:20,922
I'll have
no more shooting.

1152
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:22,215
How you expect the boy
to come out here...

1153
01:14:22,383 --> 01:14:23,802
if you're going
to shoot his hound?

1154
01:14:23,969 --> 01:14:25,639
Hell of a shot!

1155
01:14:25,805 --> 01:14:28,268
Sylvester!
You'd better get out here now.

1156
01:14:30,396 --> 01:14:32,025
Wait, Mama!
Mama, hold on!

1157
01:14:33,318 --> 01:14:35,321
Get out the window, Mama.

1158
01:14:39,244 --> 01:14:41,081
All right. I'm gonna
go get the guns, Mama.

1159
01:14:41,248 --> 01:14:42,208
You stay
out the window.

1160
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:43,711
No, Sylvester!

1161
01:14:43,878 --> 01:14:44,921
Mama, just stay out
the window.

1162
01:14:45,087 --> 01:14:47,217
Y'all children
get down right now.

1163
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:48,636
Get down under the table
right now.

1164
01:14:48,844 --> 01:14:50,305
Scrappie, Gertie,
you keep these kids down.

1165
01:14:50,515 --> 01:14:52,391
Big Baby, get down!
Get down!

1166
01:15:11,234 --> 01:15:13,905
We don't want to talk to you.
We want to talk to your boy.

1167
01:15:14,072 --> 01:15:15,951
Boys, why don't y'all
go on home?

1168
01:15:16,117 --> 01:15:17,995
Miz Sarah, we want
to talk to Sylvester.

1169
01:15:18,162 --> 01:15:20,833
You get him out here!
Right now!

1170
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,673
Mr. Walker, my boy don't know
nothing about this business.

1171
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,967
You let him
tell us that.

1172
01:15:26,133 --> 01:15:27,720
Let Jesse Hunter
tell us something.

1173
01:15:27,887 --> 01:15:30,391
Boys, I know y'all.

1174
01:15:30,557 --> 01:15:32,603
I was midwife to more
than half of you...

1175
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,147
and some
of your young ones.

1176
01:15:34,356 --> 01:15:35,608
Bring that boy
out here now!

1177
01:15:35,775 --> 01:15:39,030
I done seen you come up
from babies to now.

1178
01:15:39,197 --> 01:15:41,326
Ain't nothing
going to come of this.

1179
01:15:41,535 --> 01:15:43,579
It don't make sense.

1180
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:46,126
My Sylvester ain't had nothing
to do with this mess.

1181
01:15:46,294 --> 01:15:50,967
We ain't never known
no Jesse Hunter.

1182
01:15:51,135 --> 01:15:53,639
I was there
with Miss Fanny.

1183
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:57,312
I seen the man's face
as plain as day.

1184
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,901
And most of you mens know that
that man was white!

1185
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:09,040
Who fired that shot?

1186
01:16:09,206 --> 01:16:10,626
You tell me right now.

1187
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:12,086
I told you
no more shooting.

1188
01:16:12,253 --> 01:16:14,256
Didn't I tell you that?

1189
01:16:24,523 --> 01:16:25,984
Aunt Sarah.

1190
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,308
Poly, get back here!

1191
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:45,393
Shut up, Walker.

1192
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:46,895
Quit squealing
like a stuck pig.

1193
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:48,773
I'll take this boy out myself.

1194
01:16:48,982 --> 01:16:50,526
Damn you,
get back here!

1195
01:17:02,255 --> 01:17:04,675
Pledge your souls
to hell!

1196
01:17:35,268 --> 01:17:37,981
Get back under there.
Stay there! Stay down!

1197
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,086
Get inside, son.
Go on inside.

1198
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:54,635
Hold your fire!

1199
01:17:54,802 --> 01:17:55,636
Hold your fire!

1200
01:17:55,803 --> 01:17:56,721
Think we got him?

1201
01:17:56,889 --> 01:17:57,723
I don't know.

1202
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:59,101
We gonna need
more bullets.

1203
01:17:59,266 --> 01:18:00,603
You go and tell,

1204
01:18:00,769 --> 01:18:01,897
tell the judge
what happened here.

1205
01:18:02,106 --> 01:18:03,817
Go!

1206
01:18:03,983 --> 01:18:08,031
Rest of y'all men, get back!
Go on. Stay low.

1207
01:18:17,047 --> 01:18:18,466
I'm right here.

1208
01:18:18,633 --> 01:18:20,261
I'm right here, Mama.

1209
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:23,057
Hold on!

1210
01:18:23,225 --> 01:18:26,230
Hold on, OK, Mama?
I'm right here.

1211
01:18:31,196 --> 01:18:33,659
Don't try to talk,
Mama, don't try to talk.

1212
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:42,883
Don't...

1213
01:18:44,343 --> 01:18:48,934
Don't let them
s-s-surround you, baby.

1214
01:18:49,102 --> 01:18:50,437
It's all right.
I won't, Mama.

1215
01:18:50,604 --> 01:18:51,856
You just hold on, OK?

1216
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:54,110
Mama, no, hold on.

1217
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:56,990
Mama, hold on.

1218
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,993
Mama, hold on.

1219
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,294
Y'all take what you need
and no more!

1220
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:31,423
You hear me?

1221
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:33,217
Y'all hear me?

1222
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:38,017
How am I going
to be paid for all this?

1223
01:19:39,437 --> 01:19:41,606
You just keep track,
that's all.

1224
01:19:44,486 --> 01:19:48,118
Y'all shoot Sylvester,
Ellis?

1225
01:19:48,285 --> 01:19:49,704
Don't know.

1226
01:19:51,206 --> 01:19:53,251
They shot Aunt Sarah,
though, John.

1227
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:56,214
Aunt Sarah!

1228
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,929
What the hell's
the matter with you, Ellis?

1229
01:20:00,096 --> 01:20:02,057
You let them come here
and shoot an old woman?

1230
01:20:02,225 --> 01:20:03,643
I didn't let them do that.

1231
01:20:03,811 --> 01:20:05,898
You call that
upholding the law?

1232
01:20:06,064 --> 01:20:08,110
What kind of sheriff
are you?

1233
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:14,286
Henry and Poly are dead.

1234
01:20:21,591 --> 01:20:24,094
Shot by them damn nigras.

1235
01:20:26,933 --> 01:20:29,270
Where'd Sylvester
get his ammunition, John?

1236
01:20:43,586 --> 01:20:44,587
All right, come on.

1237
01:20:44,755 --> 01:20:46,133
Come on. Hurry up!
Hurry up!

1238
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:47,635
Come on! Come on!

1239
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:50,389
Take those babies,
go hide in the woods.

1240
01:20:50,557 --> 01:20:51,891
Y'all babies going
to get in the woods now.

1241
01:20:52,059 --> 01:20:53,895
Go on!
Go hide in the woods.

1242
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:56,567
Go on. Hurry up.
Go hide in the woods.

1243
01:20:56,733 --> 01:20:57,902
Sylvester,
I ain't leaving you.

1244
01:20:58,069 --> 01:20:59,070
Gertie, they gonna
come back here...

1245
01:20:59,237 --> 01:21:00,656
and try to kill all of us.

1246
01:21:00,824 --> 01:21:02,368
You and Scrappie got to go hide
these children in the swamp.

1247
01:21:02,577 --> 01:21:04,164
We can't take the babies
out there. It's freezing!

1248
01:21:04,329 --> 01:21:06,416
There ain't no place else.
Go on and get out of here.

1249
01:21:06,584 --> 01:21:07,543
What about Aunt Sarah?

1250
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:09,338
Just go on and get, girl!

1251
01:21:09,504 --> 01:21:11,258
Come on. Let's go.

1252
01:21:16,057 --> 01:21:18,061
Gertie. I'll be there.

1253
01:21:18,227 --> 01:21:20,690
You got to go. You got to go.

1254
01:21:25,866 --> 01:21:27,368
Come on,
Big Baby, get!

1255
01:21:29,455 --> 01:21:31,960
I can shoot,
Sylvester.

1256
01:21:33,463 --> 01:21:35,758
Big Baby gonna shoot.

1257
01:21:40,181 --> 01:21:41,559
All right.

1258
01:21:43,395 --> 01:21:44,898
All right. Come on.

1259
01:21:45,065 --> 01:21:46,150
How many are there
in the house?

1260
01:21:46,317 --> 01:21:49,113
Sylvester, Jesse Hunter,
James Carrier.

1261
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:50,491
Probably that drifter.

1262
01:21:50,658 --> 01:21:52,160
Yeah, Rodney. Listen.

1263
01:21:52,327 --> 01:21:53,788
You get together
all the men you can find...

1264
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:55,416
and you hightail it
to Sumner.

1265
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:57,085
Now, you make sure
they bring rifles.

1266
01:21:57,252 --> 01:21:58,087
What happened?

1267
01:21:58,254 --> 01:21:59,966
Three dead white men
is all.

1268
01:22:00,131 --> 01:22:03,805
We done got ourselves
a goddamn nigger revolt up here.

1269
01:22:16,618 --> 01:22:18,330
Hold your fire!

1270
01:22:21,084 --> 01:22:22,545
There he is!

1271
01:22:32,938 --> 01:22:33,939
I think I got him!

1272
01:22:34,106 --> 01:22:35,232
Hold your fire!

1273
01:22:38,989 --> 01:22:40,158
Goddamn you!

1274
01:22:40,326 --> 01:22:42,329
Burn!

1275
01:22:44,373 --> 01:22:46,085
Light 'em up!

1276
01:23:03,948 --> 01:23:08,039
Some of y'all
pick Henry and Poly up.

1277
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:26,069
That Sylvester?

1278
01:23:31,912 --> 01:23:33,372
You son of a bitch!

1279
01:24:11,103 --> 01:24:12,814
You want me
to burn her, too?

1280
01:24:15,861 --> 01:24:18,574
Couple y'all men,
come over here.

1281
01:24:20,745 --> 01:24:24,209
I want y'all to carry her down
to the nigger graveyard.

1282
01:24:27,589 --> 01:24:29,677
Go on!

1283
01:24:29,842 --> 01:24:32,640
I'll do it
if you make me deputy.

1284
01:24:32,806 --> 01:24:34,893
You're deputy now.

1285
01:24:35,102 --> 01:24:36,604
Go on, pick her up.

1286
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:39,401
Hey, boys,
I'm a deputy!

1287
01:24:41,405 --> 01:24:43,366
Hold on to that now.
Grab the other side.

1288
01:24:43,574 --> 01:24:45,995
Hold on, Bobby.
Hold on.

1289
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,753
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

1290
01:24:53,091 --> 01:24:55,469
She worked
in my damn house, Ellis.

1291
01:25:01,731 --> 01:25:04,401
Then give her a decent
Christian burial, James.

1292
01:25:15,253 --> 01:25:18,008
You men, grab that end.

1293
01:25:18,175 --> 01:25:20,470
Damn, what did
this old crow eat?

1294
01:25:20,679 --> 01:25:22,807
Come on, lift it up!

1295
01:25:28,609 --> 01:25:30,695
Look out now!
Look out!

1296
01:26:17,942 --> 01:26:20,780
Aunt Sarah

1297
01:26:20,947 --> 01:26:22,450
She clean up.

1298
01:26:22,617 --> 01:26:23,618
Aunt Sarah ain't coming.

1299
01:26:24,954 --> 01:26:26,790
No. You right.

1300
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:29,879
It's Sunday.

1301
01:26:30,047 --> 01:26:33,761
Aunt Sarah
ain't comin' no more.

1302
01:26:37,016 --> 01:26:38,435
No more, no never.

1303
01:26:40,939 --> 01:26:42,024
She's dead.

1304
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:49,996
Sylvester, too,
dead as hell.

1305
01:26:53,503 --> 01:26:54,797
Sam Carter.

1306
01:27:00,013 --> 01:27:01,349
Half of Rosewood's dead,

1307
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:04,521
and they ain't caught
your nigger yet!

1308
01:27:05,981 --> 01:27:08,194
Sarah...

1309
01:27:09,404 --> 01:27:11,323
Sarah...

1310
01:27:14,538 --> 01:27:17,292
Why they hurt
that old woman?

1311
01:27:19,546 --> 01:27:22,176
She never done nothin'
to nobody.

1312
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:16,642
Y'all need
to come on down here.

1313
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:17,895
We're gonna need some help.

1314
01:28:18,061 --> 01:28:19,856
Some colored beat and raped
a white girl.

1315
01:28:20,023 --> 01:28:21,109
Yeah, them niggers need
to be put in their place.

1316
01:28:21,275 --> 01:28:22,903
Hell, they done forgot
who they are.

1317
01:28:23,071 --> 01:28:24,072
I'm gonna get me one.

1318
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,283
We're gonna string up
all them darkies.

1319
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:30,207
Yes, we'll gather
at the river

1320
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:34,965
The beautiful,
the beautiful river

1321
01:28:35,173 --> 01:28:39,472
Gather with the saints
at the river

1322
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:40,516
That flows...

1323
01:28:40,684 --> 01:28:42,435
Y'all hear what happened
in Rosewood?

1324
01:28:42,603 --> 01:28:43,938
A colored boy
killed four white men...

1325
01:28:44,106 --> 01:28:45,817
and raped three
white women.

1326
01:28:46,025 --> 01:28:48,989
Soon we'll reach
the shining river

1327
01:28:49,156 --> 01:28:53,371
Soon our pilgrimage
will cease

1328
01:28:53,538 --> 01:28:57,295
Soon our happy hearts
will quiver

1329
01:28:57,462 --> 01:29:01,927
With the melody of peace

1330
01:29:02,094 --> 01:29:06,643
Yes, we'll gather
at the river

1331
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:10,108
The beautiful,
the beautiful river...

1332
01:29:10,274 --> 01:29:11,402
Right over there!

1333
01:29:11,569 --> 01:29:12,905
There he is!
Get him!

1334
01:29:13,071 --> 01:29:14,532
On that horse!
Give me my gun!

1335
01:29:34,316 --> 01:29:37,362
Jesse! You were better off
on that chain gang, boy!

1336
01:29:37,529 --> 01:29:38,948
There he is!

1337
01:29:53,306 --> 01:29:55,560
Let's go, boys!
Come on! Get him!

1338
01:30:01,253 --> 01:30:02,213
Move it!

1339
01:30:02,422 --> 01:30:03,883
Let's get out
of here.

1340
01:30:14,317 --> 01:30:15,652
Drop that gun!

1341
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:17,363
Get them horses
out of here!

1342
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:19,743
Hey, you hold
that horse down!

1343
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,287
Now, get him on over there!

1344
01:30:21,454 --> 01:30:23,290
Go on!

1345
01:30:23,457 --> 01:30:24,959
Oh, Ellis,
let 'em run!

1346
01:30:25,127 --> 01:30:27,088
Let 'em run! Howdy-do!

1347
01:30:33,307 --> 01:30:34,768
Ooh, here come the parade.

1348
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:40,903
Hey, listen up! Come on!
Come on over here!

1349
01:30:41,111 --> 01:30:42,072
Come on!

1350
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:45,161
15 niggers jumped us
in the woods!

1351
01:30:45,327 --> 01:30:46,996
They was armed
to the teeth!

1352
01:30:47,164 --> 01:30:49,292
What? They bump
you in the head?

1353
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:50,461
Sure enough did!

1354
01:30:50,628 --> 01:30:51,630
You go on
and get them, then!

1355
01:30:51,838 --> 01:30:52,673
Let's all get 'em!

1356
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,426
- Was it back there?
- Back yonder.

1357
01:30:54,593 --> 01:30:56,471
Go now!

1358
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:06,029
Hey, Ellis, you got
a phone call, Ellis.

1359
01:31:06,196 --> 01:31:08,617
Not now, Earl!

1360
01:31:08,783 --> 01:31:10,620
It's the governor, Ellis.

1361
01:31:15,211 --> 01:31:17,131
Pretty exciting stuff,
huh, Ellis?

1362
01:31:29,903 --> 01:31:31,864
Go right inside, Timothy.

1363
01:31:41,422 --> 01:31:42,465
See the nigger?
They got him.

1364
01:31:42,633 --> 01:31:43,843
No. You've got
to look and see.

1365
01:31:44,051 --> 01:31:45,470
You've got to
remember this.

1366
01:31:45,638 --> 01:31:47,224
It's somethin' you've got
to remember. Look.

1367
01:32:12,182 --> 01:32:14,311
What? What?

1368
01:32:22,826 --> 01:32:26,164
Mr. Wright,
you have to hide me.

1369
01:32:26,331 --> 01:32:28,167
You are crazy.

1370
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:29,670
I can't run.

1371
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:33,175
Mr. Wright, I don't know
where my boys are,

1372
01:32:33,343 --> 01:32:36,682
and my baby girl
is somewhere...

1373
01:32:36,849 --> 01:32:38,518
in the woods.

1374
01:32:41,858 --> 01:32:43,193
Mr. Wright...

1375
01:32:45,196 --> 01:32:47,659
they killed my Virginia.

1376
01:32:53,878 --> 01:32:55,964
They find you here,
they'll burn my store.

1377
01:32:56,131 --> 01:32:58,260
You best run
hide in the woods.

1378
01:32:58,427 --> 01:33:00,513
I can't run!

1379
01:33:00,723 --> 01:33:04,312
I got shot
through my side.

1380
01:33:09,153 --> 01:33:11,699
I can pay you.

1381
01:33:20,881 --> 01:33:23,637
We'll put you in
the back storeroom.

1382
01:33:23,803 --> 01:33:25,223
Thank you.

1383
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:28,227
We'll talk about that
deed later, Bradley.

1384
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:30,398
God bless you,
John Wright.

1385
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:39,246
Get some clean
white rags, blanket.

1386
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:50,264
Here they come.

1387
01:33:50,432 --> 01:33:52,268
What are you fellas
doing in the road?

1388
01:33:52,435 --> 01:33:53,269
Hold steady, boys.

1389
01:33:53,437 --> 01:33:54,897
You can back up
right now!

1390
01:33:55,106 --> 01:33:56,275
Move them trucks out!

1391
01:33:56,442 --> 01:33:57,902
Come on!

1392
01:33:59,322 --> 01:34:01,450
You know
what to do now.

1393
01:34:01,659 --> 01:34:03,203
We got business
to take care of!

1394
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:04,246
OK, now...

1395
01:34:04,413 --> 01:34:05,457
Get them trucks
out the road!

1396
01:34:05,665 --> 01:34:07,502
- Turn around!
- What are you boys doing?

1397
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:08,629
You need to get on
out the road!

1398
01:34:08,837 --> 01:34:10,089
We got business to take
care of over there!

1399
01:34:10,256 --> 01:34:11,258
Turn around!

1400
01:34:11,426 --> 01:34:13,387
You ain't bringing all this
into our town.

1401
01:34:13,554 --> 01:34:14,890
Oh, yeah, we are.

1402
01:34:15,057 --> 01:34:18,437
We're looking for a colored
fugitive name of Jesse Hunter.

1403
01:34:18,604 --> 01:34:20,232
Our coloreds
are law-abiding folk!

1404
01:34:20,398 --> 01:34:22,110
Bronson don't want you.

1405
01:34:22,277 --> 01:34:23,320
Now turn around!

1406
01:34:25,532 --> 01:34:27,160
What are you all going down
on us for?

1407
01:34:27,327 --> 01:34:29,665
Y'all gonna
protect niggers?

1408
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:32,251
That ain't no way
to treat a white man!

1409
01:34:32,419 --> 01:34:33,922
Oh, hell,
he ain't here.

1410
01:34:34,089 --> 01:34:36,760
I'm gonna remember this!

1411
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:45,357
Now, go on in there
with them.

1412
01:34:47,445 --> 01:34:48,780
Ready?

1413
01:35:26,426 --> 01:35:27,386
Hey, Bobby!

1414
01:35:27,554 --> 01:35:29,265
Hey, we're goin' back over.
You comin'?

1415
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:30,808
Yeah.
I'll be along in a bit.

1416
01:35:30,976 --> 01:35:32,312
You save me some.

1417
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:35,317
Them niggers, they runnin'
like chicken, boy!

1418
01:35:35,484 --> 01:35:37,988
They in the swamp now.
We're gonna get 'em!

1419
01:36:10,042 --> 01:36:11,838
Them's church bells.

1420
01:36:12,003 --> 01:36:14,007
My daddy's ringin' 'em.

1421
01:36:14,215 --> 01:36:15,301
Them crackers
be ringin' them bells.

1422
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:17,095
Now, you stay put, you hear?

1423
01:36:17,263 --> 01:36:19,975
No. That's my daddy
in his church.

1424
01:36:20,143 --> 01:36:21,603
He tellin' us
it's safe to come home.

1425
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:23,106
No, Denny, Lee Ruth...

1426
01:36:23,273 --> 01:36:24,692
Maybelle!

1427
01:36:24,859 --> 01:36:26,027
Denny, come back here.

1428
01:36:26,194 --> 01:36:27,447
Denny, no.
Come back here.

1429
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,496
Bust it up, boys!

1430
01:36:35,126 --> 01:36:36,962
Bust it all up, now!

1431
01:36:37,129 --> 01:36:38,924
Bust it all up!

1432
01:36:52,614 --> 01:36:54,617
Niggers!

1433
01:37:09,308 --> 01:37:10,561
Come on. Git.

1434
01:37:32,557 --> 01:37:35,060
That's a fire, now,
ain't it?

1435
01:37:38,607 --> 01:37:41,446
Well, look,

1436
01:37:41,613 --> 01:37:42,906
13.

1437
01:37:43,074 --> 01:37:44,409
Then you pull that
through there, see?

1438
01:37:44,577 --> 01:37:47,081
Now, you pull
on one of those.

1439
01:37:47,248 --> 01:37:48,332
That's perfect.
That's good.

1440
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,878
There you go.
Pull tight.

1441
01:37:50,044 --> 01:37:51,881
There you go. That's good.

1442
01:37:52,047 --> 01:37:53,885
Now you've got it, boy.

1443
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:55,386
There's your noose.

1444
01:37:55,553 --> 01:37:56,930
Now you make one.

1445
01:37:57,097 --> 01:37:58,642
Just like this one.

1446
01:38:09,076 --> 01:38:10,913
Oh, that's a good one.

1447
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:13,041
That's a good one.

1448
01:38:14,084 --> 01:38:15,253
Good boy.

1449
01:38:16,714 --> 01:38:20,095
Here. Use these
and cover yourself up.

1450
01:38:20,262 --> 01:38:23,226
It's all right.
You're all right.

1451
01:38:23,433 --> 01:38:25,771
Scrappie, I'm freezing.

1452
01:38:25,939 --> 01:38:27,566
Scrappie, I'm hungry.

1453
01:38:29,402 --> 01:38:30,237
Quiet, y'all!

1454
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,074
They're gonna hear us.

1455
01:38:58,618 --> 01:39:01,081
They done
killed everybody.

1456
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:03,168
Aunt Sarah,
Big Baby, Sylvester.

1457
01:39:03,334 --> 01:39:04,963
Scrappie.

1458
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,891
Look.

1459
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:26,332
It's more than 50 children
hidin' around in the swamp,

1460
01:39:26,499 --> 01:39:28,168
and they been
out here all night...

1461
01:39:28,335 --> 01:39:29,712
with nothing to eat,

1462
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,217
and they're cryin',
and they're freezin'.

1463
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:34,679
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?

1464
01:39:34,888 --> 01:39:36,516
Y'all be quiet now.

1465
01:39:36,724 --> 01:39:37,684
Now, hush!

1466
01:39:37,851 --> 01:39:39,646
Hush. Just hush.

1467
01:39:45,155 --> 01:39:46,574
Stop fighting.

1468
01:39:53,168 --> 01:39:54,838
Arnett...

1469
01:39:55,005 --> 01:39:56,507
Front and center.

1470
01:40:01,641 --> 01:40:03,979
Quit crying, Arnett.

1471
01:40:04,145 --> 01:40:07,861
You ain't a little boy
no more. You a man.

1472
01:40:08,069 --> 01:40:10,949
Now, you see any tears
in these eyes?

1473
01:40:13,202 --> 01:40:15,999
I need you to be strong.

1474
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:19,171
You're my lieutenant,
understand?

1475
01:40:19,337 --> 01:40:20,381
Yes, sir.

1476
01:40:25,139 --> 01:40:27,226
Now, you gather up
these women and children.

1477
01:40:27,393 --> 01:40:29,480
You're gonna move deep
into the swamp.

1478
01:40:36,325 --> 01:40:37,160
All right.

1479
01:40:37,327 --> 01:40:39,496
We gots to move.

1480
01:40:39,664 --> 01:40:40,832
Get up.

1481
01:40:42,418 --> 01:40:44,505
Come on. Get up.

1482
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,757
Come on. Move.

1483
01:40:45,925 --> 01:40:47,010
Let's go. Move!

1484
01:40:47,176 --> 01:40:48,261
I knew you'd be back.

1485
01:40:48,429 --> 01:40:50,015
It's gonna
be all right.

1486
01:40:50,181 --> 01:40:52,477
Let's move it.
Get him up.

1487
01:40:52,685 --> 01:40:54,021
Oh, he's bad.

1488
01:40:54,189 --> 01:40:56,275
He ain't gonna
last out here.

1489
01:40:56,442 --> 01:40:58,278
Emma, there ain't nothin'
the matter with me.

1490
01:40:58,445 --> 01:40:59,948
- I can walk.
- Daddy.

1491
01:41:00,157 --> 01:41:01,325
There ain't
no place to go.

1492
01:41:01,534 --> 01:41:03,246
You come too late!

1493
01:41:03,411 --> 01:41:05,540
All right, Timothy.
Upstairs with the Turners.

1494
01:41:05,707 --> 01:41:07,419
Put him upstairs, too,
in the front.

1495
01:41:07,586 --> 01:41:08,922
That's enough.
That's enough.

1496
01:41:09,089 --> 01:41:10,424
Let's go. Upstairs.

1497
01:41:10,591 --> 01:41:12,052
Everyone upstairs!

1498
01:41:12,219 --> 01:41:14,555
And clean this place up.
Look at this.

1499
01:41:14,723 --> 01:41:15,891
Clean this up.

1500
01:41:16,058 --> 01:41:19,522
Oh, my God!
This is not happening.

1501
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:21,610
What's the matter
with you?

1502
01:41:25,241 --> 01:41:27,035
I know you don't...

1503
01:41:27,244 --> 01:41:30,541
I know you don't like having
colored folks in the house,

1504
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:32,043
but this
is a serious time.

1505
01:41:32,211 --> 01:41:33,588
Is that what you think,

1506
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:36,551
that I don't like livin' here
'cause of the colored folks?

1507
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:37,886
Is that what you think?

1508
01:41:38,053 --> 01:41:39,056
Well, what is it, Mary?

1509
01:41:39,265 --> 01:41:42,854
I am caring for the colored
folks in my home!

1510
01:41:43,021 --> 01:41:44,356
It's my home, too.

1511
01:41:44,523 --> 01:41:46,569
I know.
Yes, it's your home.

1512
01:41:46,735 --> 01:41:51,577
You all treat me like
a guest in my own house.

1513
01:41:51,745 --> 01:41:54,874
I got news for you,
John Wright.

1514
01:41:55,082 --> 01:41:56,753
Carol is dead.

1515
01:41:56,918 --> 01:42:00,925
She's dead.
She ain't comin' back,

1516
01:42:01,093 --> 01:42:03,055
and I ain't leavin'.

1517
01:42:09,732 --> 01:42:11,652
Oh, God!

1518
01:42:17,663 --> 01:42:18,997
Put me down.

1519
01:42:19,165 --> 01:42:22,212
Put me down!

1520
01:42:22,379 --> 01:42:23,214
Emma!

1521
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:25,175
Emma!

1522
01:42:26,344 --> 01:42:28,472
Put me down.

1523
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,643
I hear you're hiding folk,
Mr. Wright.

1524
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:32,144
I need you to put away
old James here.

1525
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:33,439
You're misinformed.

1526
01:42:33,605 --> 01:42:34,817
You best take him.
Go hide in the woods.

1527
01:42:34,984 --> 01:42:36,486
No. I don't want
to go in there.

1528
01:42:36,653 --> 01:42:37,487
Take him, and go
hide in the swamp.

1529
01:42:37,655 --> 01:42:38,823
I ain't gonna
go in that house!

1530
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:41,495
- John Wright?
- What?

1531
01:42:41,703 --> 01:42:43,999
I know what you been
doin' with my daughter.

1532
01:42:44,207 --> 01:42:45,084
What?

1533
01:42:45,251 --> 01:42:47,254
- Hush now.
- I can run like you.

1534
01:42:47,422 --> 01:42:49,090
No, you can't.

1535
01:42:49,257 --> 01:42:52,137
Now, you gonna get us killed.
Just hush!

1536
01:42:52,305 --> 01:42:53,639
Come on, Mr. Wright.

1537
01:42:53,807 --> 01:42:55,143
You the massa
around here.

1538
01:42:55,310 --> 01:42:56,812
I ain't a massa
of nothin'.

1539
01:42:56,979 --> 01:42:58,064
You best git
while you can.

1540
01:42:58,231 --> 01:42:59,817
- What's the matter, Mr. Wright?
- Git!

1541
01:42:59,984 --> 01:43:00,901
Don't he owe you enough
to save his life?

1542
01:43:01,069 --> 01:43:02,113
You son of a bitch.

1543
01:43:02,279 --> 01:43:03,823
How much it take for you
to hide this man?

1544
01:43:04,033 --> 01:43:05,827
$10? 15?

1545
01:43:05,994 --> 01:43:07,998
How about 60, goddamn 50?

1546
01:43:08,164 --> 01:43:09,375
I'm gonna blow
your head off!

1547
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:11,837
This man's life
worth one acre of land?

1548
01:43:12,004 --> 01:43:15,635
Hide the man, John,
for God's sake.

1549
01:43:15,802 --> 01:43:17,722
Let him in.

1550
01:43:24,316 --> 01:43:25,527
Come on.

1551
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,035
Come on.

1552
01:43:30,201 --> 01:43:31,036
No, Mama.

1553
01:43:31,204 --> 01:43:32,038
Come on, baby.

1554
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:33,415
No, Mama. It's all right.
You go on.

1555
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:35,127
Go, Mama!
I'm all right.

1556
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:39,926
I can't go in there, Mama!
Take care of Papa.

1557
01:43:40,094 --> 01:43:40,886
Come on!

1558
01:43:41,054 --> 01:43:43,641
Come on, now. Git!

1559
01:43:43,808 --> 01:43:44,726
Go.

1560
01:43:47,314 --> 01:43:49,275
I'll be all right, Mama.

1561
01:44:18,324 --> 01:44:20,870
What's the problem, boys?
What's the matter?

1562
01:44:21,038 --> 01:44:22,623
We want James Carrier.

1563
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:23,667
Right now.

1564
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:25,838
Well, I ain't seen him.
Hell, I ain't seen nobody.

1565
01:44:26,004 --> 01:44:26,796
Damn it, John.

1566
01:44:26,964 --> 01:44:29,510
We caught his daughter.

1567
01:44:29,718 --> 01:44:31,013
We know he's here!

1568
01:44:31,221 --> 01:44:33,516
What did y'all
peckerwoods do to her?

1569
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:34,852
Where's she at, damn it?

1570
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:36,396
Where's she at, Ellis?

1571
01:44:38,067 --> 01:44:40,904
Come on now!
It's her daddy we after!

1572
01:44:41,072 --> 01:44:43,451
Explain to me why you
want to lynch a cripple.

1573
01:44:43,617 --> 01:44:46,163
We ain't lynchin' nobody
don't need to be lynched, John.

1574
01:44:46,372 --> 01:44:47,415
I just don't see
no sense in it.

1575
01:44:47,582 --> 01:44:50,045
John, James Carrier
was in that house...

1576
01:44:50,253 --> 01:44:51,506
with Sylvester
and Jesse Hunter!

1577
01:44:51,672 --> 01:44:55,512
Yeah. We just want to ask him
a few questions, John.

1578
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:56,806
That's all.

1579
01:44:56,972 --> 01:45:01,230
Well, that's all fine,
but I ain't got him.

1580
01:45:01,397 --> 01:45:02,732
All right, boys!

1581
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:03,734
Stay back!

1582
01:45:03,902 --> 01:45:06,239
You get off my porch!
Get off my...

1583
01:45:06,406 --> 01:45:07,741
Don't you come near!

1584
01:45:07,908 --> 01:45:09,077
Simmer down!

1585
01:45:09,285 --> 01:45:10,704
Johnny,
you want these boys...

1586
01:45:10,871 --> 01:45:12,207
to go through
your wife and children?

1587
01:45:12,374 --> 01:45:13,709
Is that what you want?

1588
01:45:13,876 --> 01:45:14,753
Come on!
Bring him out!

1589
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,714
We will!
That's what we're gonna do!

1590
01:45:16,881 --> 01:45:18,718
You give me your word,

1591
01:45:18,884 --> 01:45:22,307
all you want to do
is question him? Yes?

1592
01:45:26,147 --> 01:45:28,735
That's more like it!

1593
01:45:28,902 --> 01:45:30,238
Y'all wait here.

1594
01:45:30,405 --> 01:45:32,241
Get that nigger out here!

1595
01:45:32,408 --> 01:45:36,206
He was in the house
the whole time.

1596
01:45:36,373 --> 01:45:37,542
Get that damn nigger!

1597
01:45:46,223 --> 01:45:47,225
John!

1598
01:45:47,393 --> 01:45:48,728
John, where
are you going?

1599
01:45:48,895 --> 01:45:50,564
You're not going to let
those people have him?

1600
01:45:50,731 --> 01:45:52,066
Mary, please.

1601
01:45:52,234 --> 01:45:55,029
If I don't, they'll come
in here and shoot us all.

1602
01:45:55,197 --> 01:45:56,741
They just want to
ask him some questions.

1603
01:45:56,908 --> 01:46:00,205
I'll be with him to make sure
they don't do more than that.

1604
01:45:59,772 --> 01:46:01,024
I'll be with him.

1605
01:46:05,247 --> 01:46:06,373
Now, James...

1606
01:46:08,085 --> 01:46:11,926
We got old Sarah over here,
resting her soul.

1607
01:46:12,091 --> 01:46:15,431
If you don't tell us
where this Jesse boy is,

1608
01:46:15,598 --> 01:46:18,353
we're gonna have to put
you in there with her.

1609
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,231
It's a big box!

1610
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:24,905
Why ain't
my sister buried?

1611
01:46:25,073 --> 01:46:27,368
'Cause you ain't
buried her yet.

1612
01:46:27,535 --> 01:46:28,870
Dig a hole,
nigger.

1613
01:46:29,037 --> 01:46:31,667
I ain't got
but one good arm.

1614
01:46:31,835 --> 01:46:33,879
We ain't got
but one good shovel.

1615
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:37,510
Come on. Get up here,
you old crow,

1616
01:46:37,677 --> 01:46:39,096
and dig your own hole.

1617
01:46:39,263 --> 01:46:40,097
Come on!

1618
01:46:40,265 --> 01:46:42,059
Show us what
you're made of.

1619
01:46:42,226 --> 01:46:43,645
Come on! Let's go!

1620
01:46:43,812 --> 01:46:46,985
Grab that shovel.
Let me see what you can do.

1621
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:48,487
Get him goin'!

1622
01:46:48,654 --> 01:46:51,074
Whoa! He's eager, ain't he?

1623
01:47:05,056 --> 01:47:07,143
James, stop it.

1624
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:11,692
Just trying to help him put
that shovel in the ground.

1625
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:13,153
James, listen here.

1626
01:47:13,362 --> 01:47:17,660
I want you to tell these boys
where Jesse Hunter is.

1627
01:47:17,828 --> 01:47:19,998
He was in that house
with you, wasn't he?

1628
01:47:20,166 --> 01:47:22,836
Now, tell me, hear me?
Listen up.

1629
01:47:23,003 --> 01:47:26,009
James, you tell them
something, hmm?

1630
01:47:26,217 --> 01:47:28,054
James, look at me!

1631
01:47:28,221 --> 01:47:31,017
You tell them something,
for God's sake.

1632
01:47:31,226 --> 01:47:32,519
I'm pleading to you.

1633
01:47:32,686 --> 01:47:36,526
Sheriff,
I can't lie to you.

1634
01:47:36,692 --> 01:47:39,072
I ain't never met the man.

1635
01:47:42,995 --> 01:47:44,164
Fair enough.

1636
01:47:44,331 --> 01:47:46,502
Stop! Duke!

1637
01:47:46,669 --> 01:47:49,507
God! What's the matter
with you, Duke?

1638
01:47:49,674 --> 01:47:51,510
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1639
01:47:51,677 --> 01:47:52,678
Oh, hush up, John.

1640
01:47:52,845 --> 01:47:55,015
You done went and turned
nigger lover on us.

1641
01:47:55,182 --> 01:47:56,518
Ever since your wife
passed away,

1642
01:47:56,685 --> 01:47:58,020
you ain't been the same.

1643
01:47:58,188 --> 01:47:59,523
I'm goin' home, y'all.

1644
01:47:59,691 --> 01:48:01,402
Nigger lover, my ass!

1645
01:48:02,696 --> 01:48:05,075
You stupid
piece of white trash!

1646
01:48:05,241 --> 01:48:07,161
What did you call me?

1647
01:48:07,327 --> 01:48:09,665
Don't you nigger lover me,
you white trash!

1648
01:48:09,832 --> 01:48:10,750
Come on!

1649
01:48:21,185 --> 01:48:24,024
Think of who you are.
Think of who you are.

1650
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:25,568
Think of what
you're saying.

1651
01:48:25,734 --> 01:48:28,573
Don't do this.

1652
01:48:28,739 --> 01:48:29,574
Nigger lover.

1653
01:48:29,741 --> 01:48:31,453
Nigger lover!

1654
01:48:31,619 --> 01:48:34,249
Whose side you on,
Johnny Wright?

1655
01:48:34,458 --> 01:48:36,544
Don't even care a white man
got shot!

1656
01:48:36,711 --> 01:48:38,172
You forgetting
who you are, Johnny?

1657
01:48:43,222 --> 01:48:44,558
Go home, Johnny.

1658
01:48:44,725 --> 01:48:47,187
You go home right now.

1659
01:48:50,734 --> 01:48:52,822
You got the money
that man owes me?

1660
01:48:54,283 --> 01:48:56,912
Y'all gonna pay me for
all the money I'm losing?

1661
01:48:57,079 --> 01:48:57,914
Hell, no!

1662
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,582
Killin' all
of my customers,

1663
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:00,669
runnin' 'em off.

1664
01:49:00,835 --> 01:49:02,713
You watch who you
call white trash, boy!

1665
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,716
That's right.

1666
01:49:04,883 --> 01:49:07,388
Just 'cause you rich
off nigger money,

1667
01:49:07,554 --> 01:49:10,559
you think you better
than all the rest of us?

1668
01:49:10,726 --> 01:49:12,020
That's right!

1669
01:49:12,187 --> 01:49:15,067
You get all the money
in Florida, Johnny Wright,

1670
01:49:15,235 --> 01:49:16,904
you still ain't nothin'...

1671
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:19,659
but a dirt-floor cracker!

1672
01:49:19,826 --> 01:49:22,664
Shopkeeper!

1673
01:50:07,615 --> 01:50:09,409
Hey, now, wake up.

1674
01:50:09,576 --> 01:50:10,828
Come on.

1675
01:50:10,995 --> 01:50:14,125
Come on. We got to go.
Time to wake up.

1676
01:50:14,334 --> 01:50:16,254
We're going to go this way.

1677
01:50:18,299 --> 01:50:21,639
Gertie, where are we going?

1678
01:50:21,805 --> 01:50:22,974
Keep quiet.

1679
01:50:24,267 --> 01:50:25,980
We're going to go this way.

1680
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:58,033
I ain't got no bullets.

1681
01:51:23,951 --> 01:51:24,786
Share!

1682
01:51:24,953 --> 01:51:26,288
Hey, y'all be quiet!

1683
01:51:26,456 --> 01:51:27,791
Y'all be quiet.

1684
01:51:27,958 --> 01:51:29,961
Want them crackers
to hear you?

1685
01:51:30,128 --> 01:51:33,927
Bring the train to the old road
near Kelly's pond.

1686
01:51:34,094 --> 01:51:38,434
Get there, listen
for the engine whistle.

1687
01:51:38,602 --> 01:51:41,064
That's on the other side
of Sumner, Mr. Wright.

1688
01:51:41,231 --> 01:51:43,068
How we gonna do that?

1689
01:51:43,234 --> 01:51:45,071
You're askin' us
to take these children...

1690
01:51:45,238 --> 01:51:46,864
through all
them crackers?

1691
01:51:47,032 --> 01:51:49,786
Can't stop near Rosewood.
It's Kelly's pond or nowhere.

1692
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:52,792
No men on the train.
That's the plan.

1693
01:51:52,959 --> 01:51:56,298
How we know we can
trust you, Mr. Wright?

1694
01:51:56,506 --> 01:51:58,385
Got no choice.

1695
01:51:58,551 --> 01:52:00,304
In the trenches now.

1696
01:52:00,471 --> 01:52:04,770
8:00.
That's three hours.

1697
01:52:06,356 --> 01:52:08,192
Get these folks there.

1698
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:10,990
I'll bring the train.

1699
01:52:14,370 --> 01:52:17,208
If you're lying,
I'm comin' for ya.

1700
01:52:17,375 --> 01:52:19,713
Soldier, if I'm lying,
you're dead.

1701
01:52:19,879 --> 01:52:20,922
Yes, sir.

1702
01:52:22,383 --> 01:52:24,220
We agreed
about the men?

1703
01:52:24,386 --> 01:52:26,391
Yes, sir.

1704
01:52:26,557 --> 01:52:27,934
That includes you.

1705
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,030
Johnny, we just went through
there this morning.

1706
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:36,783
It ain't nothin'
but ashes and smoke.

1707
01:52:36,949 --> 01:52:38,119
Town's in purgatory.

1708
01:52:38,285 --> 01:52:40,748
Billy, it's a real simple thing,
we do it right.

1709
01:52:40,915 --> 01:52:42,417
They got boys
on all the bridges,

1710
01:52:42,585 --> 01:52:43,878
all the main roads
lookin' for colored men.

1711
01:52:44,087 --> 01:52:45,714
We go in at night,
round back to Sumner,

1712
01:52:45,924 --> 01:52:46,967
pick up the women
and children,

1713
01:52:47,133 --> 01:52:48,302
sweep them off
to Gainesville.

1714
01:52:48,469 --> 01:52:49,596
He's talkin' about Sumner!

1715
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:52,601
That's where the whole
damn thing started!

1716
01:52:52,769 --> 01:52:55,564
You're askin' us to risk
our engine, Johnny!

1717
01:52:55,732 --> 01:52:57,067
Who are you
Bryce brothers,

1718
01:52:57,235 --> 01:52:58,695
a couple of rich boys
playin' on your train?

1719
01:52:58,861 --> 01:52:59,863
To hell with you.

1720
01:53:00,031 --> 01:53:01,032
You boys puffin'
around the countryside...

1721
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:02,243
wavin' and tootin'
your whistle?

1722
01:53:02,409 --> 01:53:03,410
To hell with you!

1723
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:05,248
These are real folks dyin',

1724
01:53:05,456 --> 01:53:07,126
women and children ain't
done nothin' wrong to no soul.

1725
01:53:07,292 --> 01:53:08,253
That ain't fair,
Johnny!

1726
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:10,256
Don't talk to me
about fair, Billy!

1727
01:53:10,424 --> 01:53:15,139
They shot Sarah Carrier down
like a dog on her own porch!

1728
01:53:15,306 --> 01:53:18,770
I ain't asking you
to risk your train!

1729
01:53:18,937 --> 01:53:21,567
I'm asking you to risk
your asses!

1730
01:53:42,435 --> 01:53:44,940
Think they gonna let the women
and children through?

1731
01:53:46,943 --> 01:53:48,737
I don't know.

1732
01:53:54,038 --> 01:53:56,334
Wait, wait.

1733
01:54:03,805 --> 01:54:05,224
Stay here.

1734
01:54:17,245 --> 01:54:18,329
Damn.

1735
01:54:18,538 --> 01:54:20,208
Let's go.
We gotta move.

1736
01:54:37,779 --> 01:54:39,115
How far out are we?

1737
01:54:39,282 --> 01:54:41,076
About 40 minutes.

1738
01:54:41,243 --> 01:54:43,788
Can't we move
this thing any faster?

1739
01:54:43,956 --> 01:54:45,332
Push that throttle, J.B.

1740
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,461
Don't you be telling us
how to run our train, Johnny.

1741
01:54:47,628 --> 01:54:49,924
We gotta take it easy on her.
She ain't been acting right.

1742
01:54:50,091 --> 01:54:51,260
Oh, she ain't?

1743
01:54:51,468 --> 01:54:54,307
You boys been treating this
train like a little sister...

1744
01:54:54,473 --> 01:54:55,934
since I known you.
Get her moving.

1745
01:54:56,144 --> 01:54:57,270
She can't handle it!

1746
01:54:57,478 --> 01:54:59,774
Get this
son of a bitch moving.

1747
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:02,487
J.B., give her a little.

1748
01:55:10,501 --> 01:55:11,461
Feel better?

1749
01:55:11,627 --> 01:55:13,087
Yeah.

1750
01:55:14,257 --> 01:55:16,177
I feel better.

1751
01:55:20,518 --> 01:55:21,520
I'm tired.

1752
01:55:21,686 --> 01:55:23,689
I don't feel like going.

1753
01:55:23,856 --> 01:55:25,150
Hush up.

1754
01:55:25,317 --> 01:55:26,694
Hush up, be quiet.

1755
01:55:41,010 --> 01:55:43,014
That truck coming, boys.

1756
01:55:44,517 --> 01:55:45,852
Watch out, now.

1757
01:55:46,019 --> 01:55:47,480
Watch yourself.

1758
01:55:53,949 --> 01:55:55,368
Get on up.

1759
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:23,790
Come on.

1760
01:56:25,961 --> 01:56:28,214
Wait, wait.

1761
01:56:41,655 --> 01:56:43,741
Might as well
come look.

1762
01:56:45,786 --> 01:56:48,165
Make room
for my boy here.

1763
01:57:25,395 --> 01:57:27,440
Why you cryin', boy?

1764
01:57:27,607 --> 01:57:29,192
There's babies in there.

1765
01:57:30,988 --> 01:57:34,745
A nigger is a nigger, boy.
None of us like it.

1766
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:37,707
God made the world
the way it is,

1767
01:57:37,874 --> 01:57:39,460
and we just got
to live in it.

1768
01:57:39,628 --> 01:57:45,387
You get as old as I am,
you become a man...

1769
01:57:45,554 --> 01:57:48,392
you're gonna learn
a lot of things.

1770
01:57:52,650 --> 01:57:55,196
A nigger is a nigger, boy.

1771
01:57:55,362 --> 01:57:57,449
That's the way.

1772
01:57:58,826 --> 01:58:01,539
You understand me,
Emmett?

1773
01:58:01,706 --> 01:58:02,832
You understand me?

1774
01:58:08,676 --> 01:58:10,011
She's overheating!

1775
01:58:12,809 --> 01:58:13,726
Damn it!

1776
01:58:13,893 --> 01:58:14,937
Damn it, I told you!

1777
01:58:15,145 --> 01:58:17,149
We're stopping,
we're stopping!

1778
01:58:17,316 --> 01:58:18,859
We can't stop.
No, no.

1779
01:58:19,027 --> 01:58:20,571
Don't you get it?

1780
01:58:20,738 --> 01:58:22,409
Don't you get it?

1781
01:58:22,574 --> 01:58:23,869
We are stopped!

1782
01:58:24,035 --> 01:58:26,081
We can't go anywhere!

1783
01:58:26,247 --> 01:58:28,376
It's your fault!

1784
01:58:28,543 --> 01:58:29,962
Your fault!

1785
01:58:31,339 --> 01:58:33,760
Goddamn
counterbalance pin!

1786
01:58:35,012 --> 01:58:36,140
Damn it!

1787
01:58:36,307 --> 01:58:39,645
J.B., leave him alone.
You gotta check the engine.

1788
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:52,375
Don't you heathens
touch my porch.

1789
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:53,376
Step aside.

1790
01:58:53,543 --> 01:58:55,088
We hear you're hiding niggers
in here.

1791
01:58:55,255 --> 01:58:58,427
Turn around, Earl, before I
send us both to damnation.

1792
01:59:01,015 --> 01:59:02,642
Jesus Christ, Mary.

1793
01:59:02,809 --> 01:59:04,980
That damn thing
ain't loaded anyway.

1794
01:59:05,146 --> 01:59:06,858
Oh, yes, it is.

1795
01:59:07,025 --> 01:59:08,778
You got any niggers
in there, Mary?

1796
01:59:08,944 --> 01:59:11,783
Willing to kill a white woman
to find out, Bobby?

1797
01:59:11,949 --> 01:59:13,369
Now turn around
and get home.

1798
01:59:13,577 --> 01:59:15,038
Get on, get!

1799
01:59:16,457 --> 01:59:19,420
Come on, Earl.
Ain't no niggers around here.

1800
01:59:19,588 --> 01:59:20,881
Come on, y'all.

1801
01:59:21,049 --> 01:59:22,050
Come on, now.

1802
01:59:22,217 --> 01:59:26,641
You men best hope the Lord feels
merciful come Judgment Day.

1803
01:59:28,185 --> 01:59:29,814
Hush.

1804
01:59:43,128 --> 01:59:45,340
Everybody
front and center.

1805
01:59:48,052 --> 01:59:49,304
Lieutenant.

1806
01:59:53,729 --> 01:59:54,897
Where's Arnett?

1807
01:59:55,106 --> 01:59:56,525
He gone.

1808
01:59:57,986 --> 01:59:59,113
Where's Minnie?

1809
02:00:02,510 --> 02:00:04,054
Stay put.

1810
02:00:16,909 --> 02:00:20,206
What y'all boys need to get
this engine running again?

1811
02:00:20,373 --> 02:00:21,709
Somethin' we ain't got.

1812
02:00:21,876 --> 02:00:24,297
Counterbalance pin.

1813
02:00:24,463 --> 02:00:27,135
What is
a counterbalance pin?

1814
02:00:27,302 --> 02:00:28,679
Oh, it ain't nothin'.

1815
02:00:28,846 --> 02:00:31,392
Piece of metal
about this long.

1816
02:00:46,334 --> 02:00:48,712
Be quiet.
Minnie, be quiet.

1817
02:01:09,164 --> 02:01:12,920
All right, y'all men, listen up.
Let's call it a night.

1818
02:01:13,087 --> 02:01:15,090
Bobby, Earl, give me a hand.
Get these men out of here.

1819
02:01:15,258 --> 02:01:16,343
Y'all go home.

1820
02:01:16,552 --> 02:01:19,348
Get these men out of here.
Go on.

1821
02:01:19,515 --> 02:01:22,144
No more camping out in my town!
You hear me?

1822
02:01:22,311 --> 02:01:24,022
Hush, y'all, hush!

1823
02:01:24,189 --> 02:01:25,525
All right,
I see you in there.

1824
02:01:25,692 --> 02:01:27,278
What you up to, Duke?
What do you see?

1825
02:01:27,445 --> 02:01:29,155
Hold still, now. Right up
against that tree, y'all.

1826
02:01:29,323 --> 02:01:30,450
Go get him.

1827
02:01:35,417 --> 02:01:37,253
Minnie.
Minnie's back.

1828
02:01:39,799 --> 02:01:41,218
Where you been?

1829
02:01:41,385 --> 02:01:42,470
What...

1830
02:01:44,056 --> 02:01:46,978
He gonna get killed
looking for you.

1831
02:01:56,243 --> 02:01:59,248
Show you
to rape my wife.

1832
02:02:03,423 --> 02:02:04,926
Put him up!

1833
02:02:09,432 --> 02:02:11,811
Simmer down, y'all!

1834
02:02:11,978 --> 02:02:13,481
I had a nice quiet town here,

1835
02:02:13,649 --> 02:02:16,695
but you put an end to that,
didn't you, boy?

1836
02:02:16,861 --> 02:02:18,198
Wasn't no colored boy...

1837
02:02:18,364 --> 02:02:19,992
had nothin do to with
what happened there.

1838
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:21,036
Shut up.

1839
02:02:21,202 --> 02:02:22,455
Shut up, Jesse.

1840
02:02:22,622 --> 02:02:24,165
That ain't my name.

1841
02:02:33,932 --> 02:02:35,851
Clear a path.

1842
02:02:36,018 --> 02:02:37,312
Get back, get back.

1843
02:02:37,479 --> 02:02:39,233
Run the nigger up.

1844
02:02:44,534 --> 02:02:46,453
Ha, damn you!

1845
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:47,956
Come on,
you stupid horse!

1846
02:02:48,123 --> 02:02:51,044
Just shoot
the damn horse.

1847
02:02:51,212 --> 02:02:53,340
Booker T., go!

1848
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,485
Goddamn.

1849
02:03:28,524 --> 02:03:30,862
That is one strong buck.

1850
02:03:31,028 --> 02:03:32,657
Why won't he die?

1851
02:03:32,823 --> 02:03:34,993
He gonna die, he gonna die.
His neck ain't that thick.

1852
02:03:35,161 --> 02:03:36,955
Oh, he'll die,

1853
02:03:37,122 --> 02:03:40,628
only he probably didn't have
nothing to do with it.

1854
02:03:40,795 --> 02:03:45,010
Well, truth be told,
none of 'em did.

1855
02:03:45,177 --> 02:03:47,598
What the hell
does that mean, Ellis?

1856
02:03:47,807 --> 02:03:49,769
It means, James,

1857
02:03:49,978 --> 02:03:51,730
that you know
as well as I do...

1858
02:03:51,939 --> 02:03:54,110
what Fanny'd been
doing lunch times.

1859
02:03:54,276 --> 02:03:57,115
Some of y'all know
better than others!

1860
02:03:57,281 --> 02:03:58,491
That's right.

1861
02:03:58,659 --> 02:03:59,995
Should have never
listened to her.

1862
02:04:00,161 --> 02:04:01,706
That woman's
a wildcat.

1863
02:04:59,012 --> 02:05:00,722
Booker T.!

1864
02:05:07,150 --> 02:05:08,652
Shoot him!

1865
02:05:12,116 --> 02:05:14,871
Sorry I had to say it
that way, James,

1866
02:05:15,038 --> 02:05:18,711
but this thing's gone
far enough.

1867
02:05:22,468 --> 02:05:24,930
Fanny lied...

1868
02:05:25,096 --> 02:05:28,436
to you, to me,
the whole damn town.

1869
02:05:31,983 --> 02:05:36,575
Deep down, I don't think
I believed her from the start.

1870
02:05:36,741 --> 02:05:38,244
If that's how you feel,

1871
02:05:38,452 --> 02:05:40,540
why'd you take her word
for this, Ellis?

1872
02:05:40,706 --> 02:05:43,002
What choice I got, huh?

1873
02:05:43,169 --> 02:05:45,298
I am the sheriff.

1874
02:05:45,465 --> 02:05:46,716
Damn.

1875
02:05:46,884 --> 02:05:48,845
My badge.

1876
02:05:54,855 --> 02:05:57,652
What's gonna
keep it in place?

1877
02:05:58,946 --> 02:06:00,574
Prayer.

1878
02:06:10,966 --> 02:06:12,468
Move it!

1879
02:06:26,451 --> 02:06:28,454
Come on, move!

1880
02:06:40,516 --> 02:06:43,438
Get on board, get on board,
get on board.

1881
02:06:44,689 --> 02:06:47,945
Get 'em on,
get 'em on!

1882
02:06:48,111 --> 02:06:50,616
Come on, move.

1883
02:06:52,452 --> 02:06:53,412
Get on, get on!

1884
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:55,917
Come on. We ain't gonna sit
on the track all night.

1885
02:06:56,084 --> 02:06:57,086
Move!

1886
02:07:00,424 --> 02:07:01,342
Get them on!

1887
02:07:01,510 --> 02:07:02,887
Quickly!

1888
02:07:05,392 --> 02:07:06,685
Let's go!

1889
02:07:06,852 --> 02:07:08,355
Let's go. Let's get the hell
out of here.

1890
02:08:06,077 --> 02:08:08,706
You can't come on!
You can't come on!

1891
02:08:08,873 --> 02:08:10,000
Let me on this train!

1892
02:08:10,167 --> 02:08:11,378
I said get down!

1893
02:08:11,544 --> 02:08:15,384
If they find men on this train,
they'll kill everyone!

1894
02:08:15,551 --> 02:08:16,595
Get off!

1895
02:08:21,603 --> 02:08:23,857
Please!

1896
02:08:24,024 --> 02:08:25,986
Stop the train!

1897
02:08:37,254 --> 02:08:39,884
Get back.
If they find men on this train,

1898
02:08:40,051 --> 02:08:41,720
they'll kill all
the women and children!

1899
02:08:41,929 --> 02:08:43,306
You can't come on here!

1900
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:53,866
No!

1901
02:08:55,118 --> 02:08:56,287
Get down,
get down!

1902
02:09:03,549 --> 02:09:04,968
What the hell you doing?

1903
02:09:05,176 --> 02:09:08,139
This is a war!
We're in the trenches!

1904
02:09:33,725 --> 02:09:34,893
Jesus Christ!

1905
02:09:35,061 --> 02:09:36,354
Come on, girl.

1906
02:09:39,275 --> 02:09:41,363
Child, stay down.
Stay down.

1907
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:23,642
Y'all can get up now.

1908
02:11:03,501 --> 02:11:05,880
You can't go, Mann.
You just can't.

1909
02:11:06,047 --> 02:11:07,425
Don't leave us, Mann.

1910
02:11:07,591 --> 02:11:10,011
Please don't leave us.

1911
02:11:10,179 --> 02:11:11,807
Hush now.

1912
02:11:12,015 --> 02:11:15,146
Y'all gonna be safe.

1913
02:11:15,312 --> 02:11:17,775
Scrappie in charge
from here on in.

1914
02:11:17,943 --> 02:11:20,613
Arnett, you're a lieutenant.
You help her out.

1915
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:22,741
Take these
children inside.

1916
02:11:24,745 --> 02:11:27,040
Y'all gonna be all right.

1917
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,581
That's Booker T.!

1918
02:11:50,748 --> 02:11:53,878
Mr. Mann, who is that
riding your horse?

1919
02:11:57,175 --> 02:12:00,055
It's Sylvester.

1920
02:12:12,994 --> 02:12:14,579
Uncle Sylvester made it.
All right! He made it.

1921
02:12:14,788 --> 02:12:16,374
Sylvester,
how you doing?

1922
02:12:16,542 --> 02:12:19,295
Uncle Sylvester's alive.

1923
02:12:28,270 --> 02:12:30,690
I ain't got all night, Mann.

1924
02:12:30,857 --> 02:12:33,403
Gertie, y'all get
to Cousin Wilma in Gainesville.

1925
02:12:33,571 --> 02:12:34,738
Come on.

1926
02:12:35,949 --> 02:12:38,662
I'll be waiting for you
in Gainesville.

1927
02:12:38,828 --> 02:12:40,958
Won't be waiting long.

1928
02:13:12,802 --> 02:13:14,640
How'd you get out?

1929
02:13:15,891 --> 02:13:17,810
They carried me...

1930
02:13:18,646 --> 02:13:20,399
in my mama's coffin.

1931
02:13:51,492 --> 02:13:53,497
They were here.

1932
02:13:53,663 --> 02:13:55,124
A mob.

1933
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:57,128
They tried to get in.

1934
02:13:59,673 --> 02:14:00,801
What happened?

1935
02:14:00,968 --> 02:14:03,013
Mom scared 'em off.

1936
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:13,780
Boys.

1937
02:14:14,824 --> 02:14:15,951
Boys.

1938
02:15:01,611 --> 02:15:04,199
Come here!
Get up! Get up!

1939
02:15:09,416 --> 02:15:12,046
Liar!

1940
02:15:12,212 --> 02:15:13,881
Damn you, woman!

1941
02:15:21,854 --> 02:15:24,400
Where you going, boy?

1942
02:15:24,567 --> 02:15:26,069
You little crab.

1943
02:15:26,278 --> 02:15:28,198
You eat my food,
then you walk away sideways.

1944
02:15:28,364 --> 02:15:30,410
Emmett!

1945
02:15:34,459 --> 02:15:37,589
Emmett, come on back
in the house, boy.

1946
02:15:37,797 --> 02:15:39,175
L... I'm sick.

1947
02:15:39,343 --> 02:15:41,011
My hands is hurting me bad.

1948
02:15:41,178 --> 02:15:44,016
I need your help,
and my back...

1949
02:15:45,101 --> 02:15:47,814
Emmett, I don't mean
to be hard on you, boy.

1950
02:15:48,023 --> 02:15:49,859
I just want
what's best for you.

1951
02:15:50,027 --> 02:15:52,280
I want to learn you
how to live in the world.

1952
02:15:54,867 --> 02:15:56,328
I hate you!

1953
02:15:57,373 --> 02:15:58,833
You ain't no man!

1954
02:16:03,424 --> 02:16:04,969
I don't know
what you are, Daddy.

1955
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:10,144
Emmett, you come
back... Emmett.

1956
02:16:10,310 --> 02:16:12,648
Don't you walk away.
Come on here, boy.

1957
02:16:12,815 --> 02:16:14,818
Emmett, come on
back in here.

1958
02:16:58,392 --> 02:17:00,395
Which way are you headed?

1959
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:06,906
Same as you, friend.
Going to catch that train.
