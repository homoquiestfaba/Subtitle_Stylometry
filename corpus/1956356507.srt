to have their head

my friend Sean Reynolds.

to walk out that door

He's walking toward with a bag.

Why cash, you say?

11
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,810
Because the Sasquatch dude
says he doesn't take Visa.

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,340
Kevin, Kevin is your man.

180
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,430
SEAN: Huh?

181
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,040
What?

182
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,710
SEAN: Aw, that's adorable.

183
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,860
He smells.

184
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,680
Oh, no.

185
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,650
Seriously.

186
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:57,080
At the next stop,
can we switch please?

187
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,700
SEAN: Well, it was a
bit of a rough start,

188
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,790
but ladies and gentlemen, I am
pleased to announce we are now

189
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,200
officially on our way out
of Los Angeles and on track

190
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,090
to arrive in northern
California later this afternoon.

191
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,320
Much later.

192
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,780
We each get to shoot our
own stuff, how cool is that?

193
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,030
ROBYN: Hey, Sean, you do
know how dangerous this is,

194
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,050
don't you?

195
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,270
Every producer's secret
dream is to be a cameraman.

196
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,490
Then go crazy.

197
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,100
I want at least one of you
guys shooting at all times.

198
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,450
Darryl's going to
shoot the main stuff.

199
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,340
He'll shoot the--
the interviews,

200
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,590
the establishing shots,
of course, the unveiling.

201
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,850
But you guys, for filler
and for confessionals,

202
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,630
I want you shooting
at all times.

203
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,460
Burn those batteries out.

204
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,840
Fill the camera's up, every
delicious off-the-cuff moment.

205
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,010
DARRYL: Man, you better check
yourself, bro, because I'm

206
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,270
not shooting confessionals.

207
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,200
This is a documentary.

208
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,760
This is not Real
World, Bigfoot Edition.

209
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,810
Wait, Bigfoot Edition?

210
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,640
DARRYL: This is bullshit.

211
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,120
What's up with that?

212
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,340
ROBYN: You guys didn't tell him?

213
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,120
Tell me what?

214
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,730
DARRYL: It's the show.

215
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,170
The show guys we're
going to go interview,

216
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,110
he's claimed that he's bagged
himself a dead Bigfoot.

217
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,570
What?

218
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,970
ROBYN: I believe you
guys didn't tell him.

219
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,600
SEAN: Stay with me here, Kev.
It's all a hoax.

220
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,760
The whole thing's a fraud, OK?

221
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,870
I wouldn't be
surprised if it's--

222
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,440
No.
No it's not.

223
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,100
I know this guy.
I've seen him on the internet.

224
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,380
DARRYL: What?
- Yeah.

225
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,410
Dude, this is epic.

226
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,110
DARRYL: Come on.

227
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,430
Like-- no, this guy
actually found a dead Bigfoot.

228
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,820
Guys, we're going to
be fucking famous.

229
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,160
ROBYN: Good spirit, Kev.

230
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,450
KEVIN: Thank you.
SEAN: See?

231
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,230
It's totally epic.

232
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,210
DARRYL: Are you guys related?

233
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,570
Do we look like?

234
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,270
Look.

235
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,230
DARRYL: Depends on the light.

236
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,300
Look at us.

237
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,000
Look at us.

238
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,580
DARRYL: I'm good, thanks.

239
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,180
All right, Darryl, what
do you want to-- which

240
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,120
way do you want to go here?

241
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,460
DARRYL: I think-- I
think on your right.

242
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,130
On your right.
- Over here?

243
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,200
DARRYL: Move to your right.
SEAN: All right, cool.

244
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,920
So we'll catch--
we'll start on this?

245
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,500
DARRYL: Yeah, hang tight.
Hang tight right there.

246
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,200
Yeah.

247
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,120
DARRYL: OK, all right.

248
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,420
Let the genius step in here.

249
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,340
OK, check it out.

250
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,650
So we got this nice color,
nice depth of field.

251
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,760
We got you and the small rocks--

252
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,460
SEAN: Start up here.

253
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,460
DARRYL: --then we
glide across, and you

254
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,810
got you and the big rocks.
- OK.

255
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,980
And this is where
it all happens.

256
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,480
Little travel in
the shot, land there.

257
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,110
This is where it all happens.
Yeah.

258
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,700
I'm going to win
an award for this.

259
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,560
You make magic
with the camera?

260
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,250
- Yeah.
- All right, good.

261
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,990
Let's go.
Let's do it.

262
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,530
- All right.
- We got it?

263
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,010
Yep?
Everybody set?

264
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,710
DARRYL: This is it.

265
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,020
All right, how's my hair?

266
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,010
DARRYL: It's still there.

267
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,630
Robyn?

268
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,330
Thank you.

269
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,900
ROBYN: So, Mr. Reynolds, finally
back in the saddle after four

270
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,580
years, tell me, what to
you skeptics do, when

271
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,090
you get a case of the jitters?

272
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,110
Mostly we act competent.

273
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,010
Oh, thank you.

274
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,710
You're welcome.

275
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,900
And I'm sure
you'll give us one

276
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,290
of your patented goddess shaman
blessings, before we shoot?

277
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,210
- Well, of course.
- Good.

278
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,710
Darryl, we're going
to shoot that next.

279
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,220
DARRYL: Of course we will.

280
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,320
No, if you want a blessing,
let's just do it now.

281
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,290
Well, I'm ready to go here.

282
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,370
It's raining, so we'll save the
fucking blessing for next, OK?

283
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,070
Come on, come on.

284
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,800
Rain, we got to go.

285
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,930
Sean, consider
yourself blessed.

286
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,760
Thank you for your
professionalism.

287
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,780
Are we-- Kevin, are you set?

288
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,620
Yeah.

289
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,320
DARRYL: Sweet.

290
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,150
All right.

291
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,110
When you're ready, buddy.

292
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,210
DARRYL: Kev.

293
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,320
What?

294
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,160
DARRYL: Soundman doesn't
usually stand in frame.

295
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,120
Come on.
Over here.

296
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,110
Oh, yep.
Sorry.

297
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,810
Thank you.

298
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,510
Got it.

299
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,170
DARRYL: You're awesome.

300
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,930
Yeah, microphone
doesn't normally poke

301
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,170
the talent in the head either.

302
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,050
KEVIN: Oh, OK.
My bad.

303
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:46,750
My bad.

304
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,580
DARRYL: Step away please.

305
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,980
Thank you.

306
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,810
You're rolling.

307
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,940
Hoax Busters, intro take 1.

308
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,100
California's lost
coast, more than 400

309
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,690
square miles of
unpopulated forests,

310
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,870
mountains, and streams--

311
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,280
but maybe not so unpopulated.

312
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,250
Here we are in beautiful
northern California.

313
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,270
More rain's set
in, and we should

314
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,080
be at Fieldbrook any time now.

315
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
DARRYL: What?

316
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,820
What?
SEAN: That was it That was it.

317
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,260
You missed it.
That was the turn right there.

318
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,070
You missed it.
DARRYL: That?

319
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,590
SEAN: You must have blinked.

320
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,590
You've got to be kidding me.

321
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,170
That is a shack on
the side of the road.

322
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,450
The sign said
Fieldbrook General Store.

323
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,150
DARRYL: I'm fine.

324
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,300
It looks-- looks chewy.

325
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,340
Is it any good?

326
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,040
SEAN: Pretty good.

327
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,590
Needs more basil.

328
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,910
Buy stock in the company.

329
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,690
DARRYL: I plan on it.

330
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,390
Hold on.

331
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,750
Hold on.

332
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,540
Guys, this is him.

333
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,790
I got it.

334
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,490
Yes, hello.

335
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,690
Mr. Drybreck?

336
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,590
Yes, this is Sean Reynolds.

337
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,240
The Sasquatch
Bigstick-- it's actually

338
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,650
ground from Sasquatch ass.
SEAN: We're here.

339
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:47,670
We're here in Fieldbrook--

340
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,280
KEVIN: It actually
could be, like, a thing.

341
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,000
SEAN: --right in front of the--
ROBYN: Hey, save me a bite.

342
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,390
SEAN: --Fieldbrook
General Store.

343
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,060
Hey, if you sit
thre long enough,

344
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,170
you will literally
look like him.

345
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,060
SEAN: Yes, sir.

346
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,920
Robyn-- Robyn.

347
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,990
KEVIN: But you can grow hair on
your chin, so it's-- you know,

348
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,690
he can't do that.

349
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,430
ROBYN: Yes?

350
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,650
SEAN: One second please.

351
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,600
OK.

352
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,020
Hold on a second.

353
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,820
OK, go ahead.

354
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,020
Uh-huh.

355
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,090
8.2 miles south
out of Fieldbrook.

356
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,080
OK.

357
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,910
OK, then 4.2 west oak tree--

358
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,190
2.6 back north.

359
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,030
Uh-huh.

360
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,250
And then?

361
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,640
What is this,
the Himalayas, man?

362
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,340
SEAN: OK, OK.

363
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,040
DARRYL: Come on.

364
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,740
Thank you.

365
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,820
Thank you, sir.
I got it.

366
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,990
DARRYL: Can you even read that?

367
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,610
Kev, we're out.

368
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,560
Let's go.
- Oh, sorry.

369
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,260
OK.

370
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,960
Bye.

371
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,010
Thanks for the story.

372
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,780
And I didn't mean the Santa
Claus thing in a bad way.

373
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,550
It's just--
SEAN: Kevin.

374
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,240
--Beard.
Sorry.

375
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,270
Last mileage again
please, Darryl?

376
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,760
DARRYL: Yep, that is
4.3 miles on the nose.

377
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,890
Well, it's been
45 minutes now.

378
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,300
It's begun raining again.

379
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,360
And according to Drybeck's
somewhat complicated driving

380
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,180
instructions--

381
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,750
Paranoid-- paranoid
driving instructions.

382
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,450
SEAN: Thank you.

383
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,550
KEVIN: Thank you.

384
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,420
We seem to be lost.

385
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,270
There should be a
left turn right here.

386
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,220
Great.

387
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,450
Great, we're in the
middle of nowhere

388
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,750
with $7,500 in unmarked bills.

389
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,450
ROBYN: Kevin.

390
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,150
No, OK?

391
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,290
Look-- fucking pot farmer
gang members out here, man.

392
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,880
There are hardcore
Colombians and shit, man.

393
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,620
DARRYL: Kevin, chill, man.

394
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,550
Let it flow.
KEVIN: What?

395
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,020
Ain't nothing like
that's going to happen.

396
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,290
You're much more likely to have
a leg torn off by a Sasquatch.

397
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,990
SEAN: Darryl.

398
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,320
It's like you're
not even getting wet.

399
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,430
How the hell's that--

400
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,460
Does that look anything
like a road to you?

401
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,700
DARRYL: That looks
like a bike trail.

402
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,400
SEAN: I know.

403
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,490
DARRYL: Fat tires.

404
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,390
But hey, it could be.

405
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,820
SEAN: Definitely tire
tracks though, yeah?

406
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,270
DARRYL: Yeah.

407
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,100
ROBYN: Come on, you guys.

408
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,760
Have a little faith.

409
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,610
What's the worst
that could happen?

410
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,790
SEAN: Come on, baby.

411
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,650
All right, all right.

412
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,610
All right.

413
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,940
We got to get something
under that tire.

414
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,650
I need a tree
branch or something.

415
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,400
KEVIN: Holy crap.

416
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,460
Hey-- hey, Professor Bigfoot--

417
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,050
look, 9 o'clock.

418
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,110
What's-- what's that?

419
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,810
Ssh ssh ssh.

420
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,750
Mr. Drybeck.

421
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,420
Got the wrong tread
for this terrain.

422
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,400
Sean Reynolds.

423
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,100
Yeah.

424
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,620
It's nice to finally meet you.

425
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,430
Your directions, they had
us going there for a bit.

426
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,950
These three are your--

427
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,610
your crew.

428
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,260
Fine.

429
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,980
Gather your things.

430
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,970
Follow me, please.

431
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,270
From here on out, we'll
be traveling in my truck.

432
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,970
I'm sorry.

433
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,670
Wait.

434
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,080
We're driving with this guy?

435
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,860
Leave your van here.

436
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,030
And hurry, please.

437
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,340
(BREATHLESS) We don't want
to be traveling after dark.

438
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,840
Uh, tell me, tell me you
got that nice tight shot

439
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,560
with good sound.

440
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,260
ROBYN: Yeah, Sean.

441
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,550
I got every word,
even his comment

442
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,910
about our inappropriate tread.

443
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,380
I love you.

444
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,080
Hey, hey.

445
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,220
I'm not leaving this here.

446
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,910
Buddy, this guy, he's
made for reality television.

447
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,610
Look at him.

448
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,310
No.

449
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,100
We just struck gold, guys.

450
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,810
Get excited.

451
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,510
Come on.

452
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,300
Let's get the van unloaded.

453
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,250
I come back and this is
gone, I'm going to-- d'oh.

454
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:02,950
Don't even--

455
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,270
These guys are made for,
like, to catch a predator.

456
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,740
Enough.

457
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,850
And now for the
sad part, folks.

458
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:17,380
Handing over $75,000
just to a crazy man.

459
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,150
And on top of
that, he's covering

460
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,370
all the production costs.

461
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,740
He's spending over
$100,000 on this.

462
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,440
What?

463
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,330
ROBYN: Emmy.

464
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,170
Think Emmy.

465
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,090
Think broke.

466
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,650
Appreciate that.

467
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,410
Oh.

468
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,110
All worth it.

469
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,970
CARL: One last formality,
ladies and gentlemen.

470
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,780
Cell phones, please.

471
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,220
Oh, man.

472
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,290
You'll get no
reception at the cabin.

473
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,080
And I assure you, you will
get them back upon our return.

474
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,480
Thank you.

475
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,560
Thank you.

476
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,360
Thank you.

477
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,910
Now, pass these out, please.

478
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,980
Put these on your heads.

479
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,680
What?

480
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,320
And under no circumstances
remove them until you

481
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,520
are instructed to do so.

482
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,800
Is that clear?

483
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,630
Is that clear?

484
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,330
Yeah.

485
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,490
Yes, sir.

486
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,670
CARL: Good.

487
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,590
Quickly now, please.

488
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,910
Here's your present, D.

489
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,610
Great.

490
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,340
Hoods.

491
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,190
Guy's with the frickin' Taliban.

492
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,940
I hate all of you.

493
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,290
In for a penny, in
for a pound, buddy.

494
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,320
I don't know what that means.

495
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,700
There's no handle.

496
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,530
There is no door handle.

497
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,230
Get in the car.

498
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,500
What kind of car
has no door handle?

499
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,500
Tell me, is there no evidence
for the Sasquatch that, uh,

500
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,730
teases your doubt?

501
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,370
Afraid not.

502
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,600
Now that the Patterson
film has been debunked,

503
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,500
what do you really have?

504
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,780
You got-- you got
stories and footprints.

505
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,270
Footprints.

506
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,320
DARRYL: Hey, what's
the Patterson film?

507
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,540
I'm sure you've
seen it, Mr. Coleman.

508
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,980
Nothing less than
a motion picture,

509
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,760
with a large Sasquatch striding
through the wilderness.

510
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,460
DARRYL: Oh, right.

511
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,830
SEAN: Except it was a
guy in a gorilla suit,

512
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,180
and the guy who wore
it confessed to it.

513
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,880
KEVIN: Oh, God.

514
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,180
Oh, God.

515
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,820
SEAN: Hey, puke
on his floor, Kev.

516
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,520
Come on, man.

517
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,630
Let it flow.

518
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,590
He deserves it.

519
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,290
KEVIN: Oh.

520
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,020
SEAN: Jesus.

521
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,720
KEVIN: Oh.

522
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,840
We have arrived.

523
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,630
KEVIN: Oh, Jesus.

524
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,340
And as for that gorilla suit,
several eminent scientists have

525
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,930
all attested to the
fact that it cannot

526
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,320
possibly have been a costume.

527
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,020
KEVIN: All right.

528
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,240
Let me out.
Let me out.

529
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,990
Get that door open.

530
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,690
It's coming.

531
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,530
It's coming.

532
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,970
[VOMITING]

533
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,230
Don't forget to smell it.

534
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,500
Poor Kevin.

535
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,870
You doing OK over there, Kev?

536
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,880
You gonna make it?

537
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,580

big yellow Labrador.

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,460
He thought we might
need one, and we did.

One night when we
returned to camp,

something had rummaged

730
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,310
through all of our things.

731
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:50,920
Frank took a lantern, followed
tracks up a game trail.

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,530
After a while, he came back,
stood in front of the fire,

He said, Drybeck, that bear's
been walking on two legs.

he was suggesting,

would lay the groundwork

00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,230
Hey.

1080
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,740
Night number one here
at the Drybeck cabin

1081
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,570
and far from an uneventful one.

1082
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,050
A series of unknown noises
from the north, south,

1083
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,000
and east walls of the cabin.

1084
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,610
Their origin unknown to us.

1085
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,180
Our brief foray into the
black beyond this door

1086
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,440
revealed no clear
source of the sounds.

1087
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,470
So now we wait.

1088
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,050
We wait.

1089
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,120
That's where we'll end.

1090
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,880
Nice.

1091
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,180
Darryl, what is
the only thing better

1092
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,490
than 12 episodes, my friend?

1093
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,190
DARRYL: 13 episodes.

1094
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,320
13 episodes.
That's it.

1095
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,020
Shut it down.

1096
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,720
We're good.

1097
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,420
DARRYL: Heh heh.

1098
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,420
Good stuff, man.

1099
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,890
Good stuff.

1100
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,750
SEAN: OK.

1101
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,590
It's been more than an hour
since the last noise now.

1102
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,980
And believe it or not, the
world's bravest woman says

1103
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,140
she needs her beauty sleep.

1104
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,200
Respect the
unknown, gentleman.

1105
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,650
Don't fear it.

1106
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,580
Fear?

1107
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,850
Shit.

1108
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,390
I'm excited.

1109
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,000
I mean, what's
better than heading

1110
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,670
off to ice-cold
sleeping bags and cabins

1111
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,230
with cardboard walls?

1112
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,640
Thank you.

1113
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,570
You're welcome.

1114
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,900
There's no way I'm
going outside, man.

1115
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,600
I'm sorry.

1116
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,480
I'm staying here.

1117
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,320
OK.

1118
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,150
You're more than
welcome to stay here.

1119
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,280
Stay here with
crazy shotgun dude.

1120
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,780
ROBYN: Come on, gentlemen.

1121
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,950
Our visitors, whoever they
are, are long gone by now.

1122
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,660
SEAN: Yeah, come on.

1123
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,360
Ugh.

1124
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,550
Damn, it's dark out here.

1125
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,380
Did I mention I had
poor night vision?

1126
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,180
'Cause I do.

1127
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,780
I wish I did.

1128
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,380
Moonshine.

1129
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,360
Wait.
No.

1130
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,130
No.
Hold on.

1131
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:25,840
No.
Hold on.

1132
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,540
Wait.

1133
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,650
You get to sleep with her,
and I'm stuck with Darryl?

1134
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,730
Come on, man.

1135
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,810
I threw up.

1136
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,190
I set my arm on fire.

1137
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,200
This is bullshit.

1138
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,170
He's got a point, you know.

1139
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,570
I mean, between my
snoring and your moaning,

1140
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,280
he's pretty much fucked.

1141
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,110
ROBYN: Darryl.

1142
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,340
I'm not a moaner.

1143
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,130
(WHISPERING) I'm a screamer.

1144
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,370
DARRYL: Oh.

1145
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,070
Oh ho.

1146
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,870
So to make it clear, when she
does scream, do not come help.

1147
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,950
Fuck you, man.

1148
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,880
Don't kid yourself.

1149
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,620
Heh heh heh.

1150
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,790
Come on, Darryl.

Hey.

Hey!

Hey.

00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,280
What's going on?

1163
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,980
Drybeck.

1164
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,370
He just-- he took off.

1165
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,220
What?

1166
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,210
Drybeck just took off
like a bat outta hell.

1167

Fuck.

1168
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,000
That figures.

1169
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,940
He take the money?

1170
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,040
He took the money, right.

1171
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,950
No.
No.

1172
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,210
He took my breakfast order.

1173

I knew it.

You fucking pay an old
bastard like that--

00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:34,860
Hey.

fucking expensive camera.

Hey, he left the
generator on for us.

What happened?

1193
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,220
SEAN: Drybeck's gone.

1194
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,920
Get ready.

1195
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,950
I'll meet you outside.

1196
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,710
Relax, Darryl.

1197
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,260
I'm sure he had a good reason
to take off this morning.

1198
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,010
He's playing us.

1199
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,550
He's probably out
behind some TV watching

1200
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,380
this whole fucking thing.

1201
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,900
ROBYN: Morning, Kevin.

1202
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,720
Hey.

1203
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,710
Morning, Kev.

1204
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,210
Want coffee?

1205
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,170
Here you go.

1206
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,370
There's toast in the kitchen.

1207
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,610
You're lucky I love toast.

1208
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,580
We may have been abandoned.

1209
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,010
At least we've got food.

1210
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,620
So fearless leader, what
is the game plan now?

1211
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,060
What's the genius move, huh?

1212
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,860
Lead us into the light.

1213
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,560
What?

1214
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,060
Like we've got a choice?

1215
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,580
We're hoofing it
back to the van.

1216
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,280
OK.

1217
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,980
I checked it out.

1218
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,450
The tire tracks are
as clear as day.

1219
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,010
Well, not so fast.

1220
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,020
You see, I've spent
this morning going over

1221
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,620
some of last night's footage.

1222
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,930
We're getting gold here, people.

1223
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,490
Dude, the man split
with your money.

1224
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,390
He's not coming back.

1225
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,290
We can't shoot without him.

1226
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,490
Great.

1227
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,720
He's on his way to Jamaica.

1228
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,030
That's my problem.

1229
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,460
In the meantime, we should
get as much footage as we can.

1230
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,480
Are you kidding me?

1231
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,890
Dude, we are cut off out here.

1232
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,240
We're in the middle of nowhere.
ROBYN: Yeah.

1233
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,830
But there's got to be
some physical evidence

1234
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,440
for the noises that we
were hearing last night.

1235
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,260
Ha ha.
That's my girl.

1236
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,100
Exactly.

1237
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,680
Fine.

1238
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,540
Two more points, I'm in.

1239
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,590
Yeah, damn.

1240
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,120
I-- I didn't sign
up for this, man.

1241
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,900
OK.

1242
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,620
Hold on, boys.

1243
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,350
There'll be plenty of time
to talk about that later.

1244
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,050
Today--

1245
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,060
That he gets.

1246
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,760
--It's war.

1247
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,530
Darryl, I want you to get out
to 8 to 200 millimeter zoom.

1248
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,020
Going to be a lot of
low-light situations.

1249
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,550
Kevin, bust out the syncing mic.

1250
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,160
Robyn, pack up the game cameras.

1251
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,860
ROBYN: You got it.

1252
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:29,300
Technology is about
to kick Bigfoot's ass.

1253
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,350
Uh, sound is good.

1254
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,830
Kevin.

1255
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,110
(LOUDER) Kevin.

1256
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:33,820
Hm.

1257
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,520
Oh.

1258
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,360
Damn, I wish Curtis was here.

1259
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,430
Hey, you gotta
to step outside.

1260
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,750
It's a simple concept, man.

1261
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,510
There's a rectangle.

1262
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,100
You just stand outside of it.
- OK.

1263
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,660
OK.
My bad.

1264
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,010
You know what?
Don't even sweat it.

1265
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:44,930
I got it.

1266
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:45,630
Day two.

1267
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,170
Scene 1, take 3.

1268
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,080
[CLICK]

1269
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,780
Thank you, kitten.

1270
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,420
And Darryl, don't be filming
my ass when I walk away either.

1271
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,510
DARRYL: Yes, ma'am.

1272
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,360
SEAN: Mr. Coleman.

1273
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,060
Thank you.

1274
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,050
So after a literally disquieting
night in the Drybeck cabin,

1275
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,520
we've begun in
earnest our search

1276
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,460
for the first hard evidence
of the existence of Bigfoot.

1277
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,380
And given the nature and
proximity of last night's

1278
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,870
noises, we've needed
to look little farther

1279
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,340
than the exterior of the cabin.

1280
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,120
And I have to say, the
damage is quite extensive.

1281
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,760
Numerous impact marks here,
and if you look just a little

1282
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,190
further down and
a little closer,

1283
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,820
you'll find what appears
to be claw marks.

1284
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,140
And, nice touch.

1285
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,640
Now, I'm going to step
back for a second.

1286
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,060
It's right about here where
you are suddenly confronted

1287
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,640
by what is an
absolutely overwhelming

1288
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,400
odor, incredibly unpleasant.

1289
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,220
So I'm going to do this
as quickly as possible.

1290
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,580
We have right down here on
the side of the cabin what

1291
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,560
appears to be urine residue.

1292
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,240
Bigfoot urine?

1293
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,200
I'll let you be the judge.

1294
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,530
And we'll cut there.

1295
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,350
Oh, my God.

1296
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,540
You think he could have at least
written his name or something.

1297
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,470
- Oh.
- Maybe it's Drybeck's

1298
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,370
La Roche loves asparagus.

1299
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,890
How can you guys be
that close to that?

1300
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:04,700
This is good, man.

1301
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,400
This is good.

1302
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,590
This is a great setup.

1303
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,340
Not too bad.

1304
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,040
Oh.

1305
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,740
OK, Darryl.

1306
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,790
What do you think, man?

1307
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,810
I mean, heh, part of me wants
to ridicule how obvious this is.

1308
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:14,510
No, no, no.

1309
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,210
Let it build.

1310
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,180
Let it build until the end.

1311
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,980
Didn't you learn
anything from Scooby Doo?

1312
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,770
Come on now.

1313
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,150
Fuck this, man.

1314
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,860
DARRYL: Oh, Kevin.

1315
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,700
Zoinks.

1316
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,400
Let's get down to the river.

1317
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,930
This is awesome.

1318
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:26,630
SEAN: Come on.

1319
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,430
Let's move, guys.

1320
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,580
ROBYN: But the feeling is
totally different here.

1321
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,800
I don't know.

1322
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,890
Actually, in a way, it
feels more balanced.

1323
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,670
But there's something else.

1324
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,920
I don't know.

1325
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,320
There, by the stream.

1326
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,470
Oh.
Hey.

1327
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,580
Guys, check it out.
- Slow down.

1328
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,780
- Oh ho ho ho.
- Jesus.

1329
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,480
Sorry.

1330
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,310
My bad.

1331
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,630
Darryl?

1332
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,670
You getting this?

1333
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:46,370
Got it.

1334
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,350
OK.

1335
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:52,640
Um, We found some conveniently
large and clear footprints.

1336
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,660
For reference--
DARRYL: No.

1337
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,540
Go to the other side.
Other side.

1338
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,610
SEAN: Oh, OK.

1339
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,510
DARRYL: Oh, this is nice.

1340
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,290
SEAN: All right.

1341
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,130
DARRYL: Start over.

1342
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,850
SEAN: So we found some
conveniently large and clear

1343
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:02,690
footprints here.

1344
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,110
For reference, I'm a size 11.

1345
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:09,260
KEVIN: I thought you
said this was a hoax.

1346
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,210
Kevin, they're footprints.

1347
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:10,910
Come on.

1348
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,510
I could make it look like
a Tyrannosaurus walked

1349
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,800
around here if I wanted to.

1350
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,940
What the hell is that?

1351
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:19,870
That is a tree, Kevin.

1352
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,870
Sorry.

1353
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,830
Freaking out.

1354
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,690
Freaking out.

1355
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,590
ROBYN: Hey, I'm going
to check down this way

1356
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,000
and look for more footprints.

1357
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,530
I'm going to check
the other side.

1358
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:34,070
I should've left this morning.

1359
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,380
I would be remiss at
this point in not remarking

1360
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,020
on the landscape
behind me which, to me,

1361
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,900
seems eerily similar
to the landscape

1362
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,160
we all recognize from the
famous Patterson-Gimlin film.

1363
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:45,860
ROBYN: Hey, guys.

1364
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,850
Over here.

1365
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:53,960
SEAN: Oh.

1366
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,660
DARRYL: Ho.

1367
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,390
Nice.

1368
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,250
SEAN: So here, we've found
another set of prints.

1369
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,400
ROBYN: No.
Down here.

1370
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,800
DARRYL: There it is.

1371
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,330
SEAN: Well, that clears
things up a bit, doesn't it?

1372
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,660
Heh heh heh.

1373
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:13,010
Tell me, Darryl, my friend, does
Drybeck strike you as the sort

1374
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,360
of guy who wears sneakers?

1375
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,470
DARRYL: No, he does not, Sean.

1376
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,690
He strikes me as more of
a Jack boot kind of guy.

1377
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,480
You think this is La Roche?

1378
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,860
Ah, well, I find that
the simplest explanation

1379
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,330
is usually the best.

1380
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,080
DARRYL: I concur.

1381
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,980
ROBYN: All right, you guys.

1382
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,420
Why don't we spin
your theories later.

1383
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,590
Let's just try to get a feel
for what's going on around here.

1384
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,760
DARRYL: Well, I
want to get a feel.

1385
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,290
SEAN: I think she said
she wanted to feel you.

1386
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,280
DARRYL: Oh.

1387
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,510
ROBYN: I didn't
mean it that way.

1388
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,100
Thank you.
KEVIN: Guys.

1389
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:36,800
No, no, no.

1390
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,910
You could have
meant it that way.

1391
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,090
KEVIN: Guys, could we be--
- We're talking a feel.

1392
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,090
Can we be respectful?

1393
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,290
- Come on, Kevin.
- All right.

1394
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:44,120
I'd like to feel.

1395
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,480
Yeah, everybody wants a feel.

1396
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,180
Feel it up.

1397
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,040
God, do you see
what I'm dealing with?

1398
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,910
Robyn's been doing her
psychic thing for a while

1399
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:54,050
now, trying to get
the vibe of the area.

1400
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,200
But from the looks of
it, she's not very happy.

1401
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,140
KEVIN: Oh, hold on.
Hold on.

1402
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:57,780
- What are you doing?
- Ssh ssh ssh ssh.

1403
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,360
- Come on, dude.
- Stop.

1404
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,530
Stop.
- I'm in the middle of a take.

1405
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,230
Shut up.

1406
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,200
You hear that?

1407
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:02,900
Wait.

1408
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,870
Right there.

1409
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:08,320
[RUSTLING]

1410
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,450
DARRYL: Yeah, Kev,
sometimes those mics

1411
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,680
get a little bit too sensitive.

1412
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,520
Just chill out, man.

1413
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,220
What is it, Kevin?

1414
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,520
What does it sound like?

1415
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,860
OK look.

1416
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,550
Either you guys are
fucking with me, OK,

1417
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,100
and that's not fucking
funny, or I heard

1418
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,640
somebody, something talking.

1419
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,340
OK?

1420
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,100
But I don't know.

1421
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,930
I've never heard that
fucking language before.

1422
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,800
Kevin, calm down.

1423
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,500
All right.

1424
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,740
There's nobody talking
up there, all right?

1425
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,470
Between the footprints
and your voodoo vibe,

1426
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,910
he's just a little freaked out.
We're OK.

1427
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,860
We're good, right?
- Yeah.

1428
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,960
Dude, check out
these branches.

1429
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,250
All right, come on.

1430
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,930
ROBYN: For what it's worth,
I think I found a nest

1431
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,280
down there in the clearing.

1432
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,290
- You found a nest?
- Yeah.

1433
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:45,990
A Bigfoot nest?

1434
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:46,690
Yeah.

1435
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,700
Come look.

1436
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,810
Follow down here just
a little bit further,

1437
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:57,910
we run into what Robyn is now
claiming to be a Bigfoot nest.

1438
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,670
I want to get that right.

1439
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:03,120
As we approach, the smell
really hits you immediately.

1440
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,170
[FLIES BUZZING]

1441
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,070
It's obviously-- it
obviously appears

1442
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,880
to be made by an animal.

1443
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,240
- You know what?
- As we look inside--

1444
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,330
KEVIN: You know what?
Here.

1445
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,730
Fuck this, OK.
- Hey, what's going on?

1446
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:15,730
Come on, dude.
It's--

1447
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,130
- You record your own sound, OK?
- Kevin.

1448
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:17,960
Fuck, man.
Kevin.

1449
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,880
You fucking approach the nest.

1450
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,010
Just-- you guys are
fucking nuts, OK?

1451
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:22,710
I'm sorry.

1452
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,000
Do your own sound.

1453
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,500
SEAN: It's not a
Bigfoot nest, Kevin.

1454
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,670
It's some kind
of fucking nest,

1455
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,350
and I don't want
to be near it, OK?

1456
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,050
Sorry.

1457
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:29,990
DARRYL: Fucking--

1458
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,690
All right.

1459
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,070
Take it easy.
Can you just--

1460
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:32,890
I know you got a camera.

1461
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,050
Can you just hold that up?

1462
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:34,830
How am I going to--

1463
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,000
Just hold it, please.

1464
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Please.

1465
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,830
Thank you.
- Look.

1466
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,060
Just-- I want to
show you something.

1467
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,760
What?

1468
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,470
Smell this.

1469
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:42,170
It smells like them.

1470
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:42,870
They've been here.

1471
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,860
Oh, God.

1472
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,040
Ho.
Jesus.

1473
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,460
It smells like a
wet dog lost a fight

1474
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,650
with a skunk or something.

1475
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,350
OK.

1476
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:50,090
You know what?

1477
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:50,790
You know what?

1478
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,810
I want to put the
game cameras here.

1479
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:52,580
I want to put one here.

1480
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,680
I want to put one
back down by the creek

1481
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,900
where we found the footprints.
OK?

1482
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,900
ROBYN: Sean, you're not going
to catch him on a game camera.

1483
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,250
No, no.

1484
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,970
Don't-- don't-- don't
be too sure about that.

1485
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:04,110
Anything comes within 20 feet of
these babies, they get snapped.

1486
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,870
We're going to get
whatever comes by here.

1487
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,070
And it doesn't have
to be a Bigfoot.

1488
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:13,690
Yeah.

1489
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,390
That'll work.

1490
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,380
Is that pointed right?

1491
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,190
Does that look right?

1492
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,110
I want to get one by the
footprints right away.

1493
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:18,810
Let's go.

1494
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Hey.
- Just give it to me.

1495
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,450
Hey.
Hey.

1496
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:24,830
Hey.

1497
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:25,720
You all right?
- Yeah.

1498
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,030
I'm just going to
go check on Kevin.

1499
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,350
DARRYL: Don't
worry about it man.

1500
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:34,460
She's all right.

1501
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,160
Oh, great.

1502
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,950
Now what's he doing?

1503
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:36,980
What do you think?

1504
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,680
He's leaving.

1505
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,380
What?

1506
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,270
- You freaked him out.
- Yeah.

1507
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,990
Seriously, folks.

1508
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,480
It's been fun, but
I'm outta here, OK?

1509
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,090
- Kev.
- No.

1510
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,740
I don't know what you
guys are trying to pull,

1511
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,060
but there is no way that I'm
going to be your Guinea pig.

1512
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,760
Shit.

1513
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,460
Seriously.

1514
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,900
You're going to walk
away just like that.

1515
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,920
KEVIN: Yes.
Yes.

1516
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,570
I will take a
30-minute hike back

1517
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,150
to the van over another
night in this freak show.

1518
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,110
SEAN: Kevin, hey.

1519
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,250
Kevin, come on, man.

1520
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,090
God damn it.

1521
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,300
Come with me, Darryl.

1522
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,000
DARRYL: No.

1523
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,880
Darryl, come with me.
DARRYL: No.

1524
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,440
Come on.
Look.

1525
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:06,990
Hey.
Hey.

1526
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,310
You want to be
punked by these guys?

1527
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,460
DARRYL: I'm not going to
be punked by these guys.

1528
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,070
I'm not going to lose
my 15 % of the show.

1529
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:11,970
Jesus Christ.
- Kevin.

1530
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,270
No.
Let it off.

1531
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:14,360
Hey.
Hey.

1532
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,300
Hey.
OK.

1533
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:15,980
- Stop.
- Jesus.

1534
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,420
Chill out.

1535
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,120
Look.

1536
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,310
I'm not saying don't go.

1537
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,580
In fact, I think you should
hike back to the van.

1538
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,810
I'm not staying
another night here.

1539
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:25,510
OK.

1540
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,960
We don't have to
stay another night.

1541
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,060
I would like to know what you're
planning on doing with the van

1542
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,810
without the keys.

1543
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,350
So, yeah.

1544
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,520
You hike back to the van.

1545
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,220
OK?

1546
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,950
I'll give you the keys.

1547
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,310
Only I want you to
drive it back here, OK?

1548
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,840
You said we're not
staying another night.

1549
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,270
And we won't.

1550
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:49,710
We'll shoot the rest of
the day till it gets dark.

1551
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,550
Then we'll pack up nice
and neat and leave.

1552
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:57,730
You want to get paid, right?

1553
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,660
If you do this, you'll get
everything that's coming to ya.

1554
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,900
Give me the keys.

1555
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,310
OK.

1556
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,200
Now there's one more thing.

1557
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,870
It's no big deal.

1558
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,140
I just want you to
wear the body mount

1559
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,520
when you hike back to the van.
- No.

1560
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,330
No.
Sean.

1561
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,210
No.
- Will you stop.

1562
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,040
- You are--
- Excuse me.

1563
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:16,820
- --Ridiculous.
- Excuse me.

1564
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,900
Do you mind?
- You're outta control.

1565
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,880
Will you take a second?
Take a breath.

1566
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,180
- Get off me.
- Will you calm down?

1567
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:20,910
DARRYL: Come on, guys.

1568
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:21,660
It's not a big deal.

1569
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,760
I just want him
to wear a camera.

1570
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,870
It is a big deal.

1571
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,760
So just relax while
I handle this, OK?

1572
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,870
I just want you to
wear the body mount

1573
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,980
when you hike back to the van.
- That is sick, man.

1574
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,240
- You can do it.
- That is sick.

1575
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,210
No, it's what you're going
to do if you want to get paid.

1576
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,290
Give me the keys.

1577
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,840
God help you if you don't
come back with that van.

1578
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,540
You know what?

1579
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,850
I don't-- I don't like--

1580
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,370
I hate you and I
hate your shirt.

1581
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:49,690
I hate everything.

1582
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,830
Noted.

1583
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:55,540
Kevin and Robyn and you too.

1584
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,570
No matter what happens,
don't stop filming.

1585
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:02,650
DARRYL: OK.

1586
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,020
So night is approaching
here on day number two

1587
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,610
at the Drybeck cabin.

1588
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,880
Our sound engineer, Kevin, was
so shaken by what he heard,

1589
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,370
he's hiked back to
retrieve our van.

1590
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,080
That was more than an hour ago.

1591
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,700
And we're still waiting.

1592
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,740
As for Carl Drybeck,
there's still

1593
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,590
no explanation for his sudden
disappearance this morning.

1594
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,020
And as the hours
tick past, whatever

1595
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,720
small shred of credibility
he still possessed

1596
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,820
is rapidly vanishing.

1597
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,640
Without his incontrovertible
evidence for the existence

1598
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,290
of Bigfoot, we have little more
than footprints in the mud,

1599
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:46,180
moans and groans, and
Robyn's heebie jeebies.

1600
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,290
Did you get that?

1601
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,030
DARRYL: Got it.
- Yes.

1602
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:48,730
DARRYL: Damn.

1603
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,640
I would watch this.

1604
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,810
I would so watch his show.

1605
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,570
I hate television, but
I will watch this show.

1606
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:53,300
ROBYN: Heebie jeebies?

1607
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,520
DARRYL: This is good, man.

1608

00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,780
Every road is blocked.

1788
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,670
He's bullshitting, man.

1789
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,610
[SCUFFLE]

1790
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,190
Now, you stay back.

1791
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:37,690
Stay back!

1792
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:38,930
You keep an eye on him.
- Hey!

1793
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:39,630
Hey!

1794
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,440
Hey!

1795
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,210
You put that camera down.

1796
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:44,590
You help me get
Robyn in the truck.

1797
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,850
- Yeah.
- You keep an eye on him.

1798
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:46,850
I got it.

1799
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,540
I got it.

1800
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,810
You and your fucking
two-bit shoots.

1801
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,010
SEAN: Get us outta here, buddy.

1802
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,190
Robyn, you OK back there?
- Yeah.

1803
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:54,190
But none of these cell phones
are getting any reception.

1804
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,450
No bars, nothing.

1805
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,510
SEAN: Damn it.

1806
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,230
DARRYL: Oh, mother fucker.

1807
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:58,930
Shit.

1808
00:58:58,930 --> 00:58:59,630
SEAN: What?

1809
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:00,730
DARRYL: God damn it.
ROBYN: Listen.

1810
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:01,250
I can't see.

1811
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,080
DARRYL: The fucking tree!

1812
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,640
SEAN: Hang on.

1813
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,240
What the fuck could've
brought that down?

1814
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,300
Christ.
DARRYL: It's a fucking redwood.

1815
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,150
SEAN: Jesus.

1816
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,020
Jesus Christ.

1817
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,670
There's no way we're
getting around that.

1818
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,370
DARRYL: Fuck!

1819
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,670
ROBYN: Kind of explains why
Kevin's not coming back, huh?

1820
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,120
You want to fucking continue.

1821
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,270
So this is how it ends.

1822
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,580
Like most hoaxes, with a lot
of indignation and bluster,

1823
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,250
only this time innocent
people got hurt.

1824
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,380
You have to ask yourself,
what kind of minds

1825
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,180
are we dealing with when
an obsession like this

1826
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,390
turns deadly?

1827
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:30,250
God.

1828
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,370
It is not deadly.

1829
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,620
It is not fucking deadly yet.

1830
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,100
Not if I have anything
to do with it.

1831
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,170
Get back in the fucking truck.

1832
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:35,970
Get back to the cabin.

1833
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:38,460
Get us outta here.

1834
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,370
You comfortable?

1835
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,070
Eh.

1836
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,830
Yeah.

1837
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:42,610
SEAN: Nourishment.

1838
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:43,830
Eh.

1839
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,960
Thanks.

1840
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,620
How's the leg?

1841
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,050
It's a little bit better.

1842
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,000
Anyone seen Drybeck?

1843
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,700
Yeah.

1844
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,140
He was shuffling around earlier,
taking care of La Roche.

1845
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,460
Oh, poor guy.

1846
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,250
I hope he's OK.

1847
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,600
Save it, all right?

1848
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,320
He probably got hurt
trying to scare poor Kevin,

1849
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,520
dropping a tree on
him or something.

1850
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,350
DARRYL: Jesus, man.

1851
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,510
SEAN: What?

1852
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:06,740
My money says the
wus just abandoned us.

1853
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,540
What is this?

1854
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,400
"Platoon?"

1855
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,290
Really?

1856
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,600
The dude is-- he's
dropping acid out there.

1857
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,700
He thinks a war
is going to come.

1858
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,400
What the f--

1859
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,250
Stop.

1860
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,050
How's Mr. La Roche?

1861
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:34,430
He seems to be improving.

1862
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,690
Another damn bed should suffice.

1863
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,680
Stupid mistakes come
with a price, I'm afraid.

1864
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,450
SEAN: Boy, do they.

1865
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:43,470
And we're done paying.

1866
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,710
Young lady's injuries
are not my fault.

1867
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:50,800
You were all clearly warned.

1868
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,600
SEAN: (ANGRILY) already.

1869
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,570
DARRYL: Fuck you, man.

1870
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,000
SEAN: You really don't
want to push me now.

1871
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,470
ROBYN: Sean!
Sean!

1872
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:55,850
SEAN: Do not defend him.

1873
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:56,990
We're leaving.

1874
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,250
OK?

1875
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,180
Thank you for the show.

1876
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,840
It has been a fascinating
anatomy of a hoax.

1877
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:07,160
And you, you have played
your part beautifully.

1878
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,380
Now, if you'd be kind enough
to give us a ride to where

1879
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,950
that tree's blocking the road,
we can carry Robyn to our van

1880
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:12,650
from there.

1881
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:15,550
I'll do one better than that.

1882
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,680
I'll show you the Coast Trail.

1883
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,830
It's a shortcut to,
uh, Field Brook.

1884
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:22,170
You'll be safer and
ultimately faster.

1885
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:23,000
SEAN: We'll pass, thanks.

1886
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,220
DARRYL: No.

1887
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:28,510
And the trail will take us
right by where we've hidden

1888
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:33,700
the body, the body of a
completely intact juvenile

1889
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,280
gigantopithicus, Mr. Reynolds.

1890
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,100
The Sasquatch.

1891
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,430
SEAN: Darryl, take this camera.

1892
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,620
DARRYL: Bullshit.

1893
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,680
Fucking Sasquatch, Mr. Reynolds.

1894
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,820
All right.

1895
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,960
This is your final
opportunity, Mr. Reynolds.

1896
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,660
If you walk that
road back to town,

1897
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,390
you will have completely
voided our contract.

1898
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:57,340
Is that understood?

1899
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,040
Absolutely.

1900
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:58,860
I'll keep your money.

1901
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,920
Someone else will
get the unveiling.

1902
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,340
SEAN: Hah.

1903
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,420
Good luck.

1904
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:12,480
I'm sure networks will be
jumping at the opportunity.

1905
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,210
Fair enough.

1906
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:19,110
And perhaps you'll be
kind enough to film this

1907
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,270
as a teaser for the networks.

1908
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:23,100
And what's this
supposed to be?

1909
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,990
The anatomy of a
hoax, Mr. Reynolds.

1910
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:35,540
When I return, you can,
uh, give me your decision.

1911
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:42,780
DARRYL: Let me guess.

1912
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,080
He's got Bigfoot's
wiener in a jar.

1913
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:46,780
Right?

1914
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:47,480
No.

1915
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,990
It's a-- it's a
finger or something.

1916
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,940
An orangutan.

1917
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:51,660
Who knows?

1918
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,930
DARRYL: It's bullshit,
whatever it is.

1919
01:02:57,470 --> 01:03:00,740
It's bullshit, whatever it--

1920
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:01,640
Sean.

1921
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,340
No.

1922
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,300
We are not hiking
out with Drybeck, OK?

1923
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,790
She's busted up.

1924
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,540
This show is done.

1925
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,280
I don't even know why I'm
still filming this shit.

1926
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,490
If for no other reason to
protect our asses in case

1927
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,450
something else happens.

1928
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:13,290
Keep that camera up.

1929
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,090
DARRYL: Fuck you, man.

1930
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:20,630
What?

1931
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,490
What are you thinking?

1932
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,270
SEAN: It's the
goddamn money shot.

1933
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:28,970
DARRYL: No.

1934
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:29,860
You cannot be serious.

1935
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,200
SEAN: 35 %.
DARRYL: This is bullshit.

1936
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:31,910
SEAN: 35 %.

1937
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:32,680
This is money you want.

1938
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,280
ROBYN: You, guys.
(LOUDLY) That's enough.

1939
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,390
This is my choice.

1940
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,970
I am the one that has
to stay here alone.

1941
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:37,670
SEAN: OK.

1942
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,550
I need to talk to Drybeck.

1943
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,840
Mr. Drybeck?

1944
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,490
Could I talk to
you for a moment?

1945
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:54,140
Oh, of course.

1946
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,820
ROBYN: Let me just
set down my camera.

1947
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:03,710
How are you today?

1948
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,860
I'm well.

1949
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,560
How are you doing?

1950
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,830
Just a little sore.

1951
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:08,530
Heh.

1952
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:10,700
I'll bet.

1953
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:15,650
Mr. Drybeck, um, last night
when whatever it was that

1954
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,320
was carrying me,
when it dropped me--

1955
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,620
It was a Sasquatch.

1956
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:24,430
It was a Sasquatch, Miss Conway.

1957
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,260
Yeah.

1958
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,500
But it didn't feel like
it was trying to hurt me.

1959
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,800
I mean, I don't know.

1960
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,380
It just felt like it was trying
to rescue me from something.

1961
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:34,050
By dragging you
through the woods?

1962
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:38,220
Well, by dragging me away from
something, something dangerous.

1963
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,280
I'm sorry, Miss Conway.

1964
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,770
You just crossed into an
area of Sasquatch theory

1965
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:45,270
that I find very difficult
to take seriously.

1966
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,270
What theory?

1967
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:48,910
One that I've been
arguing with Mr.

1968
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:51,370
La Roche for years about.

1969
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:53,560
He too believes the
Sasquatch's role is that

1970
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,910
of a protector, a guardian.

1971
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:59,200
The usual Native
American Indian fables.

1972
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:04,340

are they supposed

1973
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,590

01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:10,640
Why, the spirit world,
of course, Miss Conway.

1975
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,940
Things on the other side.

1977

Gotta put aside such childish
fantasies, Miss Conway.

1978
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,490
What we're dealing with
here is nothing more

1979
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,580
than a nocturnal
primate, one that

1980
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,090
simply wants to be left alone.

1981

absolutely nothing to fear.
