Subtitled by:

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,110
Dejavu, Gonnie and Martien 

3 
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,295
Are you ready? 

4 
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,330
It does not be long now. 

5 
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,940
You two go that way. 

6 
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,736
Do you care? 

7 
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,376
You and I go inside. 
Let's go. 

8 
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,575
Are you afraid to really 
to be free? 

9 
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,795
What did you do to her 
done, asshole? 

10 
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,340
Can you hear it? 

11 
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,778
Whatever I wanted.

12 
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,546
That was the point, right? 

13 
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,914
You, Devil! 

14 
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,215
Yes, that's it, guys. 

15 
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,348
Let's nice to party, 
bitches. 

16 
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,821
We are really close to the beach. 

17 
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,915
This is really nice. 

18 
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,859
Open up. 
We are there. 

19 
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,057
Welcome, my dear Kat, 

20 
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,124
your bachelor paradise, 
Mexico style. 

21 
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,432
I can not believe you 
have done all this for me. 

22 
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,972
Thank Sophia. All this would not 
have been possible without her. 

23 
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,372
That is not true. 
Amber had found the house and Beth ... 

24 
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,774
Stop it. You're my 
all the best friend in the world 

25 
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,779
and we know it all. 
- Okay, enough. 

26 
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,577
Okay, can we stop for time? 
Let's go. 

27 
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,107
Light packed as usual? 
- Hey, be nice to me. This is my week. 

28 
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,313
Hi handsome. 

29 
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,022
I thought you were the decorations of 
would take them home. 

30 
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,759
Margareta everyone? 

31 
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,267
Do mine but twice. 
Or a triple. 

32 
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,928
Okay, calm 
there, vodka. 

33 
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,700
The sugar in those things you will 
a magnificent hangover. 

34 
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,969
And let me not start on 
the empty calories. 

35 
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,068
I will do mine well. 

36 
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,512
Insert the penis in a 
Mexican guest? 

37 
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,549
Nice. 
Can we play now? 

38 
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,051
I call that my parents 
well we arrived. 

39 
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,316
Come on, Beth. You can have a night 
without calling your parents. 

40 
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,721
Take something to drink 

41 
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,283
and that dick to puncture 
that wall. 

42 
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,956
I want you all to promise 
I like my phone to try to put 

43 
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,329
that you tear it from my hand and 
throw him into the sea. 

44 
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,131
Okay, enough talk. Can 
we wrote our first bar inside? 

45 
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,832
Not until we have pulled. 

46 
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,432
I am the bride. 

47 
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,478
You do understand that I 
course will never attract, right? 

48 
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,538
Come on, Jess. We do 
it all. It's fun. 

49 
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,880
Prima, never after this 
weekend, okay? 

50 
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,113
Wait. 
You must not forget. 

51 
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,618
Good Lord. 

52 
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:48,224
You fuck with someone, or 
you like it or not. 

53 
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,893
Come on. 
- Give me only. 

54 
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,301
My penises are broken. 

55 
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:56,364
Ladies, let's do this! 

56 
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,587
Trying to keep girls. 
I keep drinking until sunrise. 

57 
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,986
She has lost 8 pounds 
since they went out together. 

58 
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,028
And then she just 
went to drink. 

59 
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,790
Have you tried to 
to talk to her? 

60 
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,765
Maybe, I do not know. If I did it 
she immediately changed the subject, 

61 
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,927
and she became very defensive. 

62 
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,972
Is this not beautiful? 

63 
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,270
Let me see. 

64 
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,803
No. 
Here. 

65 
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,708
The pub is right here. 
Stop for time. 

66 
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,276
I just want to have something 
for the trip to remember ... 

67 
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,289
something I'm not in New York 
can get. 

68 
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,155
You can exact same bracelet 
get on Canal Street. 

69 
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,888
Since when are you in 
Canal Street was? 

70 
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:55,195
Like it? For you, $ 10. 

71 
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,000
Thank you. 

72 
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,065
Do you take American Express? 

73 
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,510
Thank you. 
Yes. 

74 
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,572
You seem like a very nice girl. 

75 
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,140
Very clever. 

76 
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,049
I will read your palm? 

77 
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,212
I will predict the future. 

78 
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,620
I believe they hand you 
reading. 

79 
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:24,427
You have a very strong 
love line. 

80 
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,364
You're very passionate, right? 

81 
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,958
Men like very 
very yours. 

82 
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:34,473
You meet a rapidly ... 

83 
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,640
Let's go. 
- What did she say? 

84 
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,376
I see a dark road 
front of you. 

85 
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:48,113
Listen not to, or 
death will devour you. 

86 
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,057
Yes, that was a bit scary. 

87 
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,991
Come on. 
Who cares what she says? 

88 
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,995
We waste valuable 
drinking time. 

89 
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,054
Let's go. 

90 
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:52,746
"Without a word, 
looking for a man who buys you a drink. " 

91 
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,752
Oh, that is for me. 

92 
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,754
Are they a men 
version of this game? 

93 
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,313
I can not even keep the version. 

94 
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,553
You're doing well. 

95 
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:09,059
Great. 
Here we go. 

96 
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,104
She is fantastic. 
You're the bomb. 

97 
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,696
Well, please encourage her 
not. 

98 
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,765
Did she just say out 
sucked his pants? 

99 
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,182
Got something to what 
more challenge? 

100 
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,719
Yeah, try not 
such a huge plague to men. 

101 
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,119
Whatever. Maybe you should 
just try it. 

102 
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,124
Guys, I think that 
boys there to watch us. 

103 
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,990
I think it here 
to come. 

104 
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,462
Good evening ladies. 
I'm Jeremy ... 

105 
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,590
Jeremy Spencer, 
and man with two first names. 

106 
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,600
This here is my best friend 

107 
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,499
of the whole wide 
weird world ... Rob Aimsley. 

108 
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,504
May we join you? 

109 
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,505
Please tell me 

110 
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,510
that you're not Kathleen. 

111 
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,170
No, I'm Beth. 

112 
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,443
I'm Kathleen. 
- Nice, baby. 

113 
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:01,509
Hi, I'm Jessica. 

114 
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,488
Hi. 

115 
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,491
So, where do you 
all come from? 

116 
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,460
New York, Boston, 
Providence. 

117 
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,294
World. We are 
from Texas. 

118 
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,357
I have been in Dallas for a 
real estate convention last fall ... 

119 
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,027
a lot of cowboy hats. 

120 
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,867
Really? 
That's cool. 

121 
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,772
We come from Audtion, so there 
not really much cowboys. 

122 
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,470
But we can cowboys 
if you wish. 

123 
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,944
If you are not cowboys, 
what do you do? 

124 
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,311
We work in television. 
Rob is now a producer. 

125 
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,441
He was the big boss man. 

126 
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,452
Not really the boss. 

127 
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,488
Come to size, 
not so modest. 

128 
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,989
So what brings you 
two of you here? 

129 
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,221
We are celebrating. Rob, 
has also just had a big promotion. 

130 
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:46,560
Congratulations. Then 
you pay us all drinks. 

131 
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:47,997
Perfect. 

132 
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,261
Ok. 

133 
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,849
So, what would it cost for a 
kiss from you get? 

134 
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,555
Listen, I think you really 
very nice, 

135 
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,860
I'm just ... 
so you know, 

136 
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm not going to bed. 

137 
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,904
You take no leaf 
for your mouth, do you? 

138 
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,905
Can I? 

139 
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,237
It's just that I, 
just, 

140 
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,607
Never would. 

141 
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,612
It's okay. 

142 
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,911
Are you with someone, or play 
just hard to get? 

143 
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,544
It is simply not 
happen. 

144 
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,351
What about this? What happens here? 
What are we doing? 

145 
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,858
The thing is that I 
go dancing with my girlfriends. 

146 
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,054
And if you are looking for someone 
to go to bed, 

147 
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,427
then I drunk girl 
for which there is 

148 
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,329
and her band is top. 

149 
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,075
Hi. 

150 
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,140
How about 
this dope? 

151 
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,278
I do not know why, 
but I think I like him. 

152 
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,450
If we thought that al 
I did not know better, 

153 
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,993
I think you really considered 
him with you to take home. 

154 
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,962
Oh no, not our 
Betty-Wetty. 

155 
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,055
Part of me 
do want. 

156 
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,066
What? 
Go away. 

157 
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,729
Are you serious? Frost in the 
hell or something? 

158 
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,739
Just boys. 

159 
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,707
View only boys. 
Stop. 

160 
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,902
Come on, 
let's go dancing. 

161 
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,743
So how is it to work 
on television? 

162 
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:50,448
Well, you know, it's ... 

163 
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,990
I'm not ... 

164 
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,685
... real TV show producer? 

165 
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,288
Yes. I'm sorry, really. 

166 
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,026
Jeremy has convinced me that 
it would be a good idea ... 

167 
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,193
... to help you with 
the girls to decorate. 

168 
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,999
I need all the help 
I can get. 

169 
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,664
What do you really? 

170 
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,677
Tenth-grade 
English teacher. 

171 
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,838
Really? 

172 
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,048
You know, 

173 
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,055
I was greatly in love 

174 
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,523
on my tenth class 
English teacher. 

175 
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,254
Look. 
Look what I got. 

176 
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,233
Where did you get? 
- I guess from him. 

177 
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,032
You're smart. 

178 
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,631
He is smart. 

179 
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,699
Sorry. 

180 
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,712
What about those 
love? 

181 
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:59,384
You know, it happened 
on a trip to the beach 

182 
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,950
I am sure we 
find a beach somewhere. 

183 
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,428
Really? 

184 
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,465
Will you walk a bit? 

185 
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,600
Yes. 
Give me a moment. 

186 
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,573
Hey you. There, please. 

187 
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,977
Hey, how you doing 
with the boss-man? 

188 
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,309
So far good. 

189 
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,873
Sophia and the boss-man 
sitting in a tree, 

190 
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,714
N-E-U-K-E-N. 

191 
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,880
My god, you would be so 
brains need fucking him. 

192 
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,653
Because what happened in Mexico, 
remain in Mexico, right? 

193 
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,252
So you do not mind 
if I go with him? 

194 
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,388
Go! 

195 
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,399
One of us would turn 
should be tonight. 

196 
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,027
Are you sure? 
This is your week. 

197 
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,765
Go and do it. 
Have fun. 

198 
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,570
See you in time 
for breakfast. 

199 
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,611
Okay, bye guys. 
- Bye. 

200 
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,314
That was cool. 

201 
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,842
How would you find 
to teach me 

202 
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,445
somewhere with more privacy? 

203 
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,558
I believe that we have away. 

204 
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,454
Already? 
I only had a few drinks. 

205 
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,260
We know that. 

206 
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,268
Come on, it is useless to 
any fun at all to the first night. 

207 
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,006
Sorry dibs. 
This dance is about. 

208 
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,340
Who says that? 
- We're going home. 

209 
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,642
I think I 
should leave now. 

210 
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:36,908
What the hell 
your problem? 

211 
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,007
She goes next 
week married, motherfucker. 

212 
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,781
I'm getting laid tonight, 
So fuck you, bitch. 

213 
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,695
Damn. 

214 
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,253
That was cool. 
- That was not fun. 

215 
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,800
I should have had done. 
- That was hilarious. 

216 
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,200
Every time we go out, 
is one of us into trouble. 

217 
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,761
And do you know anyone in 
his balls. 

218 
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,933
It's fun. 
It's like a tradition. 

219 
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,738
I wish we 
one could go out once 

220 
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,540
and just a nice, quiet 
night could have. 

221 
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,138
Because that would be only one 
bachelor party are real cool. 

222 
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,706
Well, we now 
Just go home, please? 

223 
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,685
Give me a dick to 
to pierce that wall down. 

224 
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,668
Hello. 

225 
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,674
Finally. 
- Took them this time? 

226 
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,472
Sorry, Beth. 
it goes well with me. 

227 
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,809
Do you thank her for 
the spoiling of my week? 

228 
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,643
She sounds very angry. 

229 
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,580
She has a hangover. Create 
you worry about. 

230 
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,448
See you there in 15 minutes. 

231 
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,453
We are not in the house. 
We have guides who met 

232 
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,284
there at the beach and we 
go look around a bit. 

233 
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,722
Okay, I see you there. 

234 
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,454
Beth, you let me have 
in the lurch? Let's go. 

235 
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,325
Sorry. We can 
not wait. 

236 
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,989
You know how it is. 

237 
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,260
But we see you at the cottage 
for dinner. 

238 
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,393
Promise. Have fun. And 
Take care. 

239 
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,835
That we do. 
Bye. 

240 
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,665
Thank you. 

241 
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,747
What is going on? 

242 
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,306
My friends, we dumped 
before noon. 

243 
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,615
Would you like to have a 
eat? 

244 
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,384
A morning quickie first. 

245 
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,557
Fast enough for you? 

246 
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,561
Maybe a little 
too fast. 

247 
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,722
I now take a shower. 

248 
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,198
Great. I 
There also one can use. 

249 
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,212
Hair of the dog? 

250 
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,274
No. 

251 
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,446
That is why you should never 
drinking on an empty stomach. 

252 
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,581
This tour is 
a little boring. 

253 
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,691
I do not believe this 
the tour is. 

254 
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,856
I think this is just one 
wretched-looking country. 

255 
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,135
Can you not simply return to us 
bringing the beach or something? 

256 
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,331
Are there no nice 
landscapes or something? 

257 
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,431
Yes, yes. 

258 
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,204
We will take you to 
bring a nice place ... 

259 
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,644
... very nice ... 
just like you, right? 

260 
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,113
I think he'll like it. 

261 
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,707
Fuck you. 
- Fuck yourself. 

262 
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,377
Fuck yourself. 
- Fuck yourself. 

263 
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,886
What is your problem? 

264 
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,515
I have no problem. 
You're such a bitch. 

265 
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,048
Let's do it now, man. 

266 
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,617
I would not get too close. 

267 
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,425
You think we're far enough? 

268 
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,898
It is good. Let 
do it now. 

269 
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,169
Thanks for the tacos. That 
was a great restaurant. 

270 
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,468
I only wished 
you'd let me pay. 

271 
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,030
Why? 

272 
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,973
Is this not technically 
our first date? 

273 
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,444
I would say that 
Bar was our first date. 

274 
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,572
Yesterday was our second 
be. 

275 
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,582
That makes this ... 
- Our third. 

276 
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,675
You know what 
that means. 

277 
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,879
Your home, or 
mine? 

278 
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,945
Mine is closer. 

279 
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,161
So I walk inside 

280 
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,423
and the guy is 
Kathleen her bed 

281 
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,795
and he is naked 
and tied. 

282 
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,130
And the best part is ... 
he cries, 

283 
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,227
blubbering like a baby. 

284 
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:22,364
He said I 
to mean. 

285 
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,602
So there you have it 
just left? 

286 
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,667
That you never told me. 

287 
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,517
That is so funny. 

288 
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,122
Why are we stopping? 

289 
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,489
Since this is your stop, whore. 
Get out of the van. 

290 
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,551
Get out! 

291 
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,104
Kathleen! 

292 
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,774
No. Let me go. 

293 
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,251
Take it! 
Take it! 

294 
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,493
Hi, Beth. 
- Sophia, they have shot Kat! 

295 
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,867
I do not know where they are! | 

296 
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,202
What? 
Where are you? 

297 
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,107
He drove laps with us. 
There is a palm tree and ... 

298 
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,077
My heavens, 
He is coming. 

299 
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,307
Beth? 

300 
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,906
Throw that damn phone down! 

301 
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,784
Oh, shit. 

302 
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,155
My girlfriend called me. 
It sounds like they are in trouble Sat 

303 
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,626
- I think something has happened. 
- Are they missing? 

304 
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,993
Yes, they are missing. 
And said that a friend was shot. 

305 
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,895
Señorita, you should calm down a bit. 

306 
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,661
I can not help you if you do not get quiet. 

307 
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,669
Ok, 
Sorry. 

308 
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,467
Well, how long are your friends already missing? 

309 
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,907
They were four hours ago 
avoided, I think. 

310 
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,240
They have only four hours away? 

311 
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,677
Is this a joke? 

312 
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,681
No no, she said 
they saw a building 

313 
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,809
and palm trees 
and a bell or something. 

314 
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,151
- He hung up. 
- What? 

315 
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,350
Police 
Just hung up. 

316 
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,724
Damn Mexico. 
All I want is a little help .. 

317 
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,565
Where is the U.S. embassy? 
They will do something. 

318 
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,158
There is no embassy here. 

319 
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,931
You must 
Mexico City call themselves. 

320 
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,938
But I think 
that not much will help. 

321 
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,769
It was only a few hours. 

322 
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,537
Maybe they 
have a joke with you. 

323 
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,272
A joke? 
Why would they do that? 

324 
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,110
Maybe your back 
address because you went out with me. 

325 
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,945
You said Kathleen 
very angry. 

326 
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,542
Kathleen would never ... 
Okay, maybe that would do Kathleen, 

327 
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,554
but Beth would never go. 

328 
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,852
Let's ask around. 

329 
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:56,223
Maybe someone saw 
they do at the beach. 

330 
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,989
Ok. 

331 
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,691
Yes, I could take a few pictures to show. 

332 
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,495
How is your Spanish? 

333 
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,368
They will not fight. 

334 
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,376
Cord her mouth. 

335 
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,936
Who did you call hell, 
little girl? 

336 
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,505
Does not stand, do you? 

337 
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,949
Give me your money and jewelry. 

338 
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,154
Give me your money and jewelry. 

339 
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,328
Phones too. 

340 
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,732
I have mine with me. 

341 
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,326
Check it. 

342 
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,770
No, no, please. 

343 
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,276
You're lucky you're so thin, 

344 
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:53,749
not worth further 
are for rape. 

345 
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,844
Your ring. Give me your purse. 

346 
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,413
He wants you ring. 

347 
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,119
Just give it to him. 

348 
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,593
But it is my 
engagement ring. 

349 
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,994
Grab it! 

350 
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,033
No, please do not. 

351 
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,938
Bye, bitches. 

352 
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,474
Watch out 
for coyotes, huh? 

353 
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,784
Wait. 

354 
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,794
Wait. 

355 
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,592
Stop the car! 
You can not simply just leave us here! 

356 
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,669
What do we do now? 

357 
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,403
Come here and help me. 

358 
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,048
Keep the pressure on it, 
okay? 

359 
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,279
My ring. 

360 
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,686
Priorities ... 

361 
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,156
you are fucking shot. 

362 
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,658
Those damn bastards ... 

363 
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,490
When I see them again, 
I'll kill them. 

364 
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,893
Is it bad? 

365 
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,227
She was shot. 
That is not good. 

366 
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,824
Am I dead? 

367 
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,392
No, you will not die. 

368 
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,134
What are you doing? 
What are you doing? 

369 
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,575
I make a bottleneck link. 
We must stop the bleeding. 

370 
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,274
Ok. 
It is good. 

371 
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,906
Til. 

372 
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,178
I'm dying or not then? 
I'm dying. 

373 
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,243
Shut up. I told you, 
You will not die. 

374 
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,618
Yell at me. 

375 
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,554
Do we know what road to the town? 

376 
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,024
I do not know. 
I'm really confused. 

377 
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,358
- Sophia will call for help. 
- And we wait then? 

378 
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,625
How should they know where we are? 

379 
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,963
There ... 
I see a reflection 

380 
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,026
No, it is not. 

381 
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,798
What do you what it is? 

382 
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,272
I do not know the 
looks like a building. 

383 
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,400
Perhaps there is someone who can help. 

384 
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,171
-Can you stand? 
- No. 

385 
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,839
I'll help you. 
I'll help you. 

386 
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,712
I told Sophia about. 
I told her that I've seen. 

387 
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,216
Quiet. You can. 

388 
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,278
Damn, man. 
You know damn what time it is? 

389 
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,213
It is 6:30 P.M., Jeremy. 

390 
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,184
What? 
Really? 

391 
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,447
Sorry. 

392 
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,455
Are you still drunk? 

393 
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,991
A small cat that's all. 

394 
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,961
I mean, I was a little 
went crazy when you say, ... 

395 
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,863
Sophia. 

396 
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,163
Hi. Ok. 

397 
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,328
Hi again. 

398 
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,803
How's Beth? 

399 
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,534
We hope in us 
can help with something. 

400 
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,907
Listen, I do not cross swords with you. 

401 
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,175
- So if we make it up ... 
- You speak Spanish, right? 

402 
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,317
We need you to take the 
city people talking ... City folk ... 

403 
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,512
because we think that her friends 
abducts his 

404 
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,987
and we can not talk to him. 

405 
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,284
- Good night. 
- No, please. 

406 
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,943
What is this place? 

407 
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:44,345
Perhaps a kind of army camp? 

408 
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,384
Who cares? 
Let's go fuck in this heat. 

409 
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,852
We will see if anyone is home. 

410 
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,583
We can a little from the sun 

411 
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,648
and we at Kat's leg elevation. 

412 
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,564
Hello? 

413 
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,610
It looks abandoned. 

414 
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,510
I do not like what this place looks like. 

415 
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,014
Where should we go? 

416 
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,380
Let Kat to bring inside. 

417 
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,027
Here, here. 
Put her down here. 

418 
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,742
Damn. 

419 
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,744
Keep your leg to high. 

420 
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,645
It appears to heal, 
which is good. 

421 
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,775
Try not to move otherwise 
the wound is open again, okay? 

422 
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,343
Try to be strong. 
Can you do that? 

423 
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,355
Well. 

424 
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,689
Why does this happen to me? 

425 
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,132
What kind of church is this? 

426 
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,603
Weird. 

427 
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,197
It seems as if they hurt each other. 

428 
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,122
I just do not understand 

429 
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,253
Why anyone would want to live here 

430 
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,887
in limbo. 

431 
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:47,598
I've found some candles 
and lanterns or something. 

432 
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,163
We can use them 
to walk back to town. 

433 
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,833
We must stay here tonight. 

434 
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,538
What? 
Why? 

435 
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:57,638
When the sun sets, we 
can see the lights of the city, right? 

436 
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,080
We do not know where the city is. 

437 
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,674
Did not look out there? 

438 
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,413
We are in the medium 
of nowhere. 

439 
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,854
Let us try. 
I do not like. 

440 
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,916
All I want is to 
place with a good bed 

441 
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,358
I feel safe. 

442 
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,090
Safe? This is the safest 
place we could find. 

443 
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:16,156
We can not in the dark cat to wear. 
That is too dangerous. 

444 
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,567
And I do not even agree what 
direction I should go. 

445 
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,299
We do not further 
what has come in the night ... 

446 
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:25,536
coyotes, snakes, 
I do not know. 

447 
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,306
But I would not take that risk. You? 

448 
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,405
And what now? 

449 
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,046
Hold your leg up. 

450 
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,054
So what we look for stocks. 

451 
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,114
You do not leave me alone, do you? 

452 
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,682
I love your company. 

453 
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,661
Well. Beth and I will look 
what we can find ... 

454 
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,755
Hopefully some 
water, and blankets, 

455 
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,265
Stuff to camp here tonight. 

456 
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,326
Promise me only that you return. 

457 
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,667
Trust me. 
We come back. 

458 
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,707
Come on. 

459 
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,121
These girls ... 
Have you seen them? 

460 
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,952
Sorry, I have not seen them. 

461 
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,855
Okay, he has not seen them. 

462 
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,086
Can we get a drink? 

463 
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,458
Let it rest. 
I am well with you. 

464 
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,430
Ask him if he knows something about 
the building in the desert 

465 
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,932
with the palm trees. 

466 
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:28,302
Do you know of a place in the 
desert 

467 
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:33,310
with palm trees and 
a bell tower 

468 
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,539
No, I do not know. 

469 
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,410
Thank you, sir. 

470 
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,744
Dick. 

471 
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,114
That is strange. 
Why did he so weird? 

472 
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,584
Everyone here is strange. 

473 
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,121
That is what "Mexico" means 
in the Mexican ... "weird." 

474 
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,554
Can we get a drink? 

475 
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,525
Well. 
Let the questions continue. 

476 
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,824
I said that somewhere in 
the beach to the drinking, 

477 
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,023
that's what 
we should be. 

478 
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,831
Thank God. 

479 
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,838
Cunt. 

480 
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,745
No. 
No. 

481 
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,051
No. 

482 
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,285
No phone, no water. 

483 
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,556
We have found no food, 
just empty rooms. 

484 
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,621
We should never stop. 

485 
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,757
What would we have done ... 

486 
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,166
Kathleen drag 
bleeding from the desert 

487 
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,602
until they fall away? 
And what then? Sitting in the dark 

488 
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,503
while death and wait 
the coyotes would come? 

489 
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,905
Would you have preferred, 

490 
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,808
you aching, stiff 
little bitch?! 

491 
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,408
Sorry. 

492 
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,074
I murder you! 

493 
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,550
Jess, what are you doing? 

494 
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,624
Sorry. 

495 
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,490
We are all stressed. 
That is the ... I am ... 

496 
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,935
Return to Kathleen 
and Amber. 

497 
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,799
Should not we be together? 

498 
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,068
I can take care of myself, but I know 
not certain of Kathleen and Amber. 

499 
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,336
You should go back to a 
eye to keep. 

500 
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,174
What are you doing? 

501 
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,077
There must be something here ... 

502 
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,945
water, first aid ... 
whatever. 

503 
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,177
And tomorrow we can try 
follow the sun 

504 
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,186
and to the west trying 
to go to the coast to find. 

505 
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,188
But we have to find material 

506 
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,451
because we will not sustain 
without equipment. 

507 
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,493
Be careful. 

508 
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,777
Not a very homey place, right? 

509 
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,719
Can it be 
We clean it up. 

510 
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,949
I think candles are fun. 

511 
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,322
I saw this past sandstone Mon 

512 
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:06,523
The previous owner loved it ... 
and I mean loved candlelight. 

513 
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,690
He had this individual candlesticks 

514 
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:12,031
in the hall and on the stairs. 
It was really fun. 

515 
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,833
The people I sold it to 
thought it was to die. 

516 
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,167
This place ... 
I just do not understand 

517 
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,735
something which so far 
can build 

518 
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,747
and then decorate 
with such artifacts. 

519 
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,214
It just has no sense. 

520 
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,082
I mean, where they used 
this place? 

521 
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,144
What think you, Kat? 

522 
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,159
Kathleen, is everything okay? 

523 
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,494
It would be much better to me, 
if you still would be. 

524 
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,693
You know, I talk when I'm nervous. 

525 
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,029
The pond outside is fun, 
although, 

526 
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,267
lined with trees. 

527 
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:55,073
There is at least one landscape. 

528 
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,738
Who first used this place 

529 
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,577
was certainly not a good decorator. 

530 
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,776
I can not imagine 
that many people here have been ... 

531 
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:04,252
Jesus Christ. 
No wonder Ryan deceived you, 

532 
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,812
you stupid girl. 

533 
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,189
What do you mean it? 

534 
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,194
I mean that men 
not like 

535 
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,662
as their friend 
but constantly talking 

536 
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,665
about nothing. 

537 
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,724
The only thing they want 
is a beautiful sight, 

538 
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,168
a nice ass and a place 
their dick to keep warm. 

539 
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,830
And the way you look, 

540 
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,101
that a man can not help it. 

541 
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,702
Why do you say this? 

542 
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,746
The guide did not even rape you. 

543 
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,577
Your boobs have shrunk to nothing. 

544 
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,312
Selfish cunt. 

545 
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,713
Think you can sit there but 
and evaluate me 

546 
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,724
and treat everyone like shit? 

547 
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,851
I do not know why Sophia 
always come to you. 

548 
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,489
I am not more 
baby-sit your ass. 

549 
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,432
You can just sit here 
and I bleed to death for something to give. 

550 
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,435
Where you going? 

551 
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,630
You can not leave me here. 

552 
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,697
I would say, "Eat me," 

553 
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,005
but I know you do not, 
'because you eat anything! 

554 
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,568
Fuck you. 

555 
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,581
Great bachelor party, 
by the way. 

556 
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,640
You're a great friend. 

557 
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,824
I can not believe that 
nobody has seen him. 

558 
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,985
I can not believe that 
nobody has seen them. 

559 
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,654
I have 20 drinks of your credit. 
Can you give me more money? 

560 
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,697
I can use it for good ... 
a whore, maybe. 

561 
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,791
Why are they so afraid when we 
the bell to ask? 

562 
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,768
I do not know, but we 
keep doing this? 

563 
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:29,272
Prefer to go inside 
to party? 

564 
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,743
It is her. 

565 
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,075
Where you going? 

566 
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,581
You. 

567 
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,584
Darkness is now very strong 
inside you. 

568 
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,813
What did she say? 

569 
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,322
I do not know. 
Something about a shadow, I think. 

570 
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,086
Ask her what she said last night. 

571 
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,651
What have you told her last night? 

572 
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,697
I saw it in her hand. 

573 
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,427
There is a very bad place in 
waiting for her and her friends 

574 
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,562
and, if they continue, 
death will come. 

575 
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,073
What is it? 
What did she say? 

576 
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:07,474
Something about you and your friends 

577 
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,069
die in a bad spot. 

578 
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:12,274
What? Which place? 
The spot with the bell? 

579 
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,482
Which place? 

580 
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,387
The spot with the bell? 

581 
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,288
With the palm trees? 

582 
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,261
Yes, yes. South of the border, 
at the old resort. 

583 
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,661
An old resort 
south of the city. 

584 
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,666
Resort? 

585 
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,066
What kind of resort? 

586 
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,195
Why does she think it scary? 

587 
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,666
Why is it ... why is it evil? 

588 
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,735
It was long ago, 
but bad things happen here, 

589 
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:45,077
and what comes in, 
will never get out. 

590 
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,992
Where are you? 

591 
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,035
Beth. 

592 
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,628
Amber. 

593 
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:13,710
Where are you? 
I need you. 

594 
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,212
Jessica. 

595 
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,000
Rot Mexico. 

596 
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,767
We had to go to Vegas. 

597 
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,419
Stupid bitching. 

598 
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,732
Great. 

599 
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,430
This is my party. 

600 
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,769
It is mine. 

601 
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,241
Hello. 

602 
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,546
Are you there? 

603 
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:54,904
God, what happens to me? 

604 
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,158
"This community is formed 

605 
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:26,259
hoping to find a new world 

606 
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,135
with no rules, 
no boundaries, 

607 
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,697
no social ... 

608 
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,709
and escape for those 

609 
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,541
their deepest desires 
wanted to explore 

610 
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,548
a life that our 
will allow all 

611 
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,710
to live a life without fear ... 

612 
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,225
opinion and fear of ridicule. 

613 
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:55,197
They came here to be the person 
she always dreamed to be. 

614 
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,894
Expenses have gone in 
the wind. 

615 
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,640
They make their clothes ... 

616 
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:13,115
uncontrolled sexual urge, 

617 
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,777
take what you want when you want. 

618 
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,583
Groan, scream of ecstasy, 

619 
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,217
the delicious pain behind each door. 

620 
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,893
We devoured everything in sight ... 

621 
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:34,370
eat, drink, life itself 

622 
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,134
have irresistible forces. 

623 
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,370
It was inevitable ... 

624 
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,378
death followed us all here 

625 
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:45,006
with the wind. 

626 
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,414
And we can not be 
might escape. " 

627 
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,556
"I can no longer control. 

628 
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,559
Passions are strong. 

629 
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,652
My need for power 
about life itself 

630 
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,823
is just too strong. 

631 
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,595
It whispers to me. 

632 
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:06,602
They are those out there 

633 
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,763
paradise that we will not understand. 

634 
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,773
They will never understand 

635 
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,309
the soul that is innovative 

636 
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,005
and those damned 
to hell. " 

637 
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,414
"It will never stop. 

638 
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,952
I will never stop. " 

639 
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,487
Oh, God. 

640 
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,989
Are you there? 

641 
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,924
Jess. 

642 
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,231
Amber. 

643 
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,874
You're it. 

644 
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,308
Where the hell have you been? 

645 
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:50,347
It's just a story. 

646 
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,474
It's just a story. 

647 
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,813
You do not really believe in 
those things, well then? 

648 
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,046
They seem to believe it. 

649 
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,885
That old bag is really 
angered. 

650 
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,853
Go get some shots for us. 

651 
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,860
And what nacho `s. 

652 
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,227
- Good. 
- I'm with you. 

653 
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,866
What do you need? 

654 
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:21,234
Two ... three tequila `s. .. 

655 
00:46:21,311 ---> 00:46:23,973
nacho and what `s. 

656 
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,213
Have you seen these girls? 

657 
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,077
No. 

658 
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,753
Excuse me, ma'am. 

659 
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,194
Everything good? 

660 
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,199
Yes, go Jeremy 
bring his drink. 

661 
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,601
Is that your friend? 

662 
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:50,765
Sorry. I do not speak Spanish. 
Let me ... 

663 
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,672
No, no, no. 
I speak English. 

664 
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,109
I thought you might ... 

665 
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,840
I've often. 

666 
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,711
What did you show the bartender? 

667 
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,943
My friends ... 

668 
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,987
they are gone. 

669 
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,954
I wonder if somebody can 
tell where they are 

670 
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:11,051
or who they are gone. 

671 
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,323
No, I have not seen them. 

672 
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,665
- Have you seen these women? 
- No. 

673 
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,670
Sorry. 

674 
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,729
Thanks. 

675 
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,273
You know someone might take me to 
south of the city can bring? 

676 
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:34,309
South of the city? 
Where? 

677 
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,750
I heard that this 
resort. 

678 
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,084
I think she can be. 

679 
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,624
You have problems finding people 

680 
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,818
that can bring you there. 

681 
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,054
I know. 
I've heard. 

682 
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,961
I think we maybe 
can bring ... 

683 
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,000
for a small fee, 
of course. 

684 
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,060
Wait, you know where it is? 
You know how to get there? 

685 
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,832
Everyone here knows where it is. 

686 
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,464
They will just not go. 

687 
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,271
- So you going tonight? 
- Not the evening. 

688 
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,278
Nobody goes there the evening before. 

689 
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,906
That place has a bad reputation, chica. 

690 
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,746
We wait for the sunrise. 

691 
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:11,379
No, but I can pay you. What does it cost 
tonight to go there? 

692 
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:15,619
Dangerous objects come here `s night. 

693 
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:19,093
Go home, take a 
shower and relax. 

694 
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:22,222
See you here tomorrow morning. 
Then we go, okay? 

695 
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,501
Ok. 

696 
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:30,799
What did she say? 

697 
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,605
She thinks her friend at 
The hotel is old. 

698 
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:38,444
- How do they know? 
- She said no. 

699 
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,347
But I bet that bitch 
has called her 

700 
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,250
and said she was. 

701 
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,687
Do you think they suspect us? 

702 
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,055
Why does that matter? 

703 
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,028
I care for them tomorrow. 

704 
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,791
Cheers. 

705 
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,739
We know these guys do not. 
How can we trust them? 

706 
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:09,677
- I have no choice. 
- How much money do they want? 

707 
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,714
It is a scammer. 

708 
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,647
You do not have to come 
if you do not want. 

709 
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,514
These are my friends. 
This is my problem. 

710 
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,519
No, no, of course, we go. 

711 
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,521
We show you not just go. 

712 
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:20,954
Okay? 

713 
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,093
Why should I go? 

714 
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,788
Okay? 

715 
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,084
You ok there? 

716 
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,588
Fuck you. 

717 
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:00,219
When was the last time 
your friends that you saw? 

718 
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,755
Two nights ago. I did yesterday morning 
talked to them, 

719 
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,927
but I have since not 
seen. 

720 
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,937
That is not good. 

721 
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,371
Has anyone else seen them? 

722 
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,466
One American tourist 
they like each other. 

723 
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,909
We have called the police. 

724 
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,413
She would not be bothered. 

725 
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,383
What she said about the police? 

726 
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:25,581
Do not worry, they help her 
with the search. 

727 
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:29,056
They do not find them, even though 
they knew it. 

728 
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,856
You know where you're going, right? 

729 
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,367
Goddamn. 

730 
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:25,073
Oh, God. 
Oh, God. 

731 
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:28,174
Oh my God. 

732 
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,486
Shit. 

733 
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,819
- You should call a doctor. 
- Keep quiet. 

734 
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,222
We have nothing to do. 
You turned the gun on us, remember? 

735 
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,625
We must leave here. 

736 
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:39,992
What should we do? 

737 
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,997
Oh, God, 
what have we done? 

738 
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,090
They have put them away ... 
Beth and everyone ... 

739 
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,101
and they have over them. 

740 
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,603
You killed us, just like you to 
our friends did, right? 

741 
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,367
We have never seen your friends. 

742 
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,874
Stop it. Stop it. 
Let me think. 

743 
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,343
Ok, 
we tie him up 

744 
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,346
and we take him to the resort. 

745 
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,882
No, let me not go. 

746 
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,747
Beautiful thieves with shot wounds 

747 
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,683
impose no requirements. 

748 
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,462
Cunt. 

749 
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,867
- What have you done to him? 
- No, no, no, nothing. 

750 
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,638
We took their money and everything, 

751 
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,407
but we left him lying on the side. 
We did not kill him. 

752 
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,573
Beth said you Cat lap. 

753 
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,514
I did not. 
She wanted to run away. 

754 
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,280
What have you done with them? 

755 
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,482
No doctor for you until 
We have found them. 

756 
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:43,321
Take us to the resort. 

757 
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:02,802
You go there not 
inside, well then? 

758 
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,780
- Shut up. 
- You can not enter. 

759 
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,010
- That place lets you do things. 
- Look, 

760 
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,813
I'm not leaving without 
my friends. 

761 
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,353
Take him away. 

762 
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,515
What? No, no, 
I brought you here, 

763 
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,252
but I'm not going inside. 

764 
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,625
Come on. I need a doctor, man. 

765 
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,062
There is no doctor to 
we have our friends. 

766 
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,862
I do not go inside. 

767 
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,471
Well. If you are not inside 
to go 

768 
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,539
You can stay here. 

769 
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,149
Let me not alone. 

770 
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,093
Please, leave me alone. 

771 
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,790
Leave me alone. 

772 
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,199
Hello. 

773 
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,448
After you. 

774 
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,405
What is that? 

775 
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:52,154
Is there anyone? 

776 
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:03,460
Has anyone a buggy? 

777 
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,593
What if they are not here? 

778 
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,797
What if they roam out there? 

779 
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,339
How do we find them? 

780 
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,704
Just try not to think. 

781 
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,175
They are here somewhere. 
You must. 

782 
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,804
Beth. 

783 
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,814
Amber. 

784 
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,214
Jessica. 

785 
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:23,616
Kathleen. 

786 
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,052
No need to shout. 

787 
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,281
I'm here. 

788 
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,756
Cat. 
Cat. 

789 
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,623
Luckily everything is well with you. 
Beth said you're fired. 

790 
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,959
Shot? 
I'm not fired. 

791 
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,567
I've never felt so good. 

792 
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,125
Where are the others? 

793 
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,137
They are here somewhere. 

794 
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,765
We have a bus. 
Let us get back and go to town. 

795 
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,775
Would you all away so quickly? 

796 
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,777
You should now see the stars the evening. 

797 
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,109
It is so peaceful. 

798 
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,342
What, Cat? 

799 
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,145
Why are you so strange? 

800 
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,652
I do not know what you mean. 

801 
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:01,122
Want to look the other girls. 

802 
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,126
Ok. 

803 
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,186
Follow me. 

804 
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,737
Kat, what happens? 
Then Beth said she called for help ... 

805 
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,143
Is not this place beautiful? 

806 
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,274
Of course. 
How did you find? 

807 
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,113
We looked for help. 

808 
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,176
And we found it. 

809 
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,529
Onze Vader Die in de Hemelen zijt, 

810 
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,462
Hallowed be thy name. 

811 
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,193
Your kingdom come, 

812 
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,997
Your name will be done, 
In Heaven as on Earth. 

813 
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,470
Give us this day our daily bread ... 

814 
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:53,441
And it does us all 
much help. 

815 
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,137
What are you talking about? 

816 
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,941
Find out. 

817 
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,005
You lead. 

818 
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,074
If you insist. 

819 
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,938
- Untranslated -- 

820 
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:32,276
It can help you all. 

821 
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,714
What happens there? 

822 
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,720
- Untranslated -- 

823 
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,762
Sophie. 

824 
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,233
Jeremy? 

825 
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,195
We are here to bring you home. 

826 
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,536
I want to go home. 

827 
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,811
We must get the other and 
you get here. 

828 
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,813
The other? 

829 
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,543
Amber and Jessica ... 
where are they? 

830 
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,017
I do not know. 

831 
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,020
What is going on here? 

832 
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,318
It is strange, 
Sophie ... I ... 

833 
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,085
What? 

834 
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,287
I will not tell you. 

835 
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:23,458
Do not be afraid. 
Tell me. 

836 
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,091
Where's your other friend go? 

837 
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,729
What? Jesus. 
Cat! 

838 
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,797
- Come on, we gotta go. 
- I 'm not going anywhere. 

839 
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,536
We have to. 
It is not safe. 

840 
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,804
I'm not! 

841 
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:44,452
Sophie, I do not know what 
happen to me. 

842 
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,819
Leave me alone. 

843 
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,958
You know what? 
You find the other. 

844 
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,019
I'll stay here with her. 

845 
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:01,670
Take care. 

846 
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,172
We do. And let her 
clothes to keep, okay? 

847 
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,231
We are back soon. 

848 
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:12,981
It is good. 

849 
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,985
Please, I need a doctor. 

850 
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,671
Listen 

851 
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,041
I'm ready. 

852 
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,478
Are you that? 

853 
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,294
Amber. 
Jessica. 

854 
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,358
Kathleen. 

855 
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,079
- No! 
- Jesus Christ. 

856 
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,321
Eat! 

857 
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,483
Amber, what are you doing? 
What have you done? 

858 
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,322
What the hell is this? 

859 
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:34,659
No, that's my girlfriend. 
Amber, I am ... Sophia. 

860 
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,995
Listen to me. 
Stop it. 

861 
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:40,160
- I do not think they can hear you. 
- Stop it! 

862 
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,732
Stop it! 

863 
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,826
Pick the furniture. 

864 
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,441
She has lost her mind. 

865 
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,812
They let it go. 

866 
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:30,649
We all. 
We are all relieved. 

867 
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,188
Jess, you do not. 

868 
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,952
We are in trouble. 
We should not trust. 

869 
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:39,256
But I've made. 
I took care of that bastard. 

870 
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:41,455
I can not do much without it. 

871 
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,061
Can you hear them ... 

872 
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,934
the voices in the wind? 

873 
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:51,837
They call you. 

874 
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:54,308
I hear nothing. 

875 
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,572
Want to know why you are afraid ... 

876 
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,341
afraid to be free? 

877 
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,541
Go here, damn. 

878 
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:03,141
Just in the bus. 
And do not stop. 

879 
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,052
Get away from me. 
Just go now. Do not stop. 

880 
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,397
Beth! 
Jeremy! 

881 
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,685
Beth. 
Jeremy. 

882 
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,863
What have you done? 

883 
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,194
Why? 

884 
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,030
Why not? 

885 
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:56,560
You're not Beth. 
Where is she? 

886 
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,473
Of course I am. 
Sophie, I am. 

887 
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,034
- You're not yourself. 
- I know. 

888 
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,808
But everyone can change. 

889 
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,816
Let me hurt you. 

890 
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,648
Why would you do? 
We are friends, but ... 

891 
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,120
best friends? 

892 
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,623
Remember what you said to me 

893 
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,556
You and Sarah were the seventh grade 

894 
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,892
after you had helped me 
with a small problem? 

895 
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,295
You said you felt you free. 

896 
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,425
Go away from me. 

897 
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,993
Now I know what really means Fri. 

898 
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,403
Now I know what I missed. 

899 
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,034
Get the fuck away from me! 

900 
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,738
Please try again. 

901 
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,847
Can you hear? 

902 
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,855
It is so loud. 

903 
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,520
Can not you hear? 

904 
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,099
You try not to 
the bus to go, right? 

905 
01:04:08,177 ---> 01:04:10,441
You should know that it does not work. 

906 
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,779
There is only one thing 
what you can do. 

907 
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,075
Sophie. 

908 
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:44,010
Where were you? 
Why you left us? 

909 
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,581
Leave me if not. 

910 
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:51,017
Sophie. 

911 
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:53,385
I am so sorry. 

912 
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,539
Oh, God, no. 

913 
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,775
Want to save yourself? 

914 
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,635
What you are. 

915 
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,194
All your friends are dead 

916 
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,672
second. 

917 
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:48,710
You can not make me 
her murder. 

918 
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,756
Really, darling, stop running. 

919 
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:07,557
There is only one thing 
what you can do. 

920 
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,564
No. 

921 
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,998
No, no! 

922 
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,273
Can you hear it? 

923 
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,742
I can hear. 

924 
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,075
Stay there. 
Stop there. 

925 
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,444
I can not stop. 
No one can. 

926 
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:29,450
Jessica, I am. 
Do you remember me? 

927 
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,986
Why are you doing this? 

928 
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,784
Because you are free. 
That is the point. 

929 
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,757
That is nonsense. 

930 
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,556
I am free to do 
what I want! 

931 
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:43,155
You will never hurt me. 

932 
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:46,429
It wants me. 
I thought you could hear. 

933 
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,993
Stop, please. 

934 
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,904
I want to do this. 
Let me do this. 

935 
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,169
You will, if you would just listen. 

936 
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:57,178
Listen. 
Listen! 

937 
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:13,258
Jess. 
Oh, God, Jess. 

938 
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,939
Sophie? 

939 
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:30,943
Sophia. 

940 
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,379
- Oh, God. 
- What is going on? 

941 
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:36,850
- What happens to me? 

942 
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,080
It is good. 
You're okay. 

943 
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:41,214
You're alive. 
That is all that counts. 

944 
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,690
Okay, okay. 

945 
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:47,217
Kathleen ... 

946 
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,821
where is she? 

947 
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,126
She is okay. 

948 
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:57,263
Everyone is okay. 

949 
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,609
I do not want anymore. 

950 
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,115
I want to go home. 

951 
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,118
- I want to go home. 

952 
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:12,711
I will take care of you, okay? 

953 
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:16,087
Okay? 
Everything is good. 

954 
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,626
Yes. 

955 
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:27,700
Sophia. 

956 
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,295
Wait.
Wait, what are you ...?
