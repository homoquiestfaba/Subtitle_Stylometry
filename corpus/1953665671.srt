00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:33,690
No way, man.

540
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,392
Aw, come on.

541
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,860
I saw you checking out
the dragon.

542
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,662
See, so I know you're curious.

543
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:41,131
Hey.

544
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,399
You know, you're not
the only one

545
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,102
who was devastated by
Lily's death.

546
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:47,738
I know it's just a "seasonal
job,"

547
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,341
but everyone who
worked here is my family.

548
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,711
The farm is all I have.

549
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,014
We could've lost everything.

550
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,950
Sorry, Junior.

551
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,118
Yeah, when did being sorry

552
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,021
ever bring someone back
from the dead?

553
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,557
[laughs]
I'm just, I'm just kidding.

554
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,093
Relax.

555
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,629
Come on,
let's go have some fun.

556
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,967
Come on!

557
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,098
Die!
[chainsaw revving]

558
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,833
- Hey!
- Aw!

559
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:53,270
Oh, I'm sorry Wayne!
I'm a little on edge!

560
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:54,938
You shouldn't have scared her
like that!

561
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,908
Hello, amateurs!
It's my fucking job!

562
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,243
Bitch!

563
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,446
Sorry about him.

564
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:06,616
We like to scare people
we know a little...extra.

565
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,686
I have to get him taken care
of.
I'll be right back.

566
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,157
[sighs]

567
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:23,333
You're all going to die!
[scream]

568
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,238
[scream]

569
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,010
Did you hear about
that naked couple

570
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,277
that died here last night?

571
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,480
I heard it was the ghost
of Lily Hansen.

572
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:38,048
Ooh!

573
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,984
You mean that bitch that was
barbecued here last fall?

574
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:43,320
Yeah, this place has been
cursed since she died.

575
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:45,655
Yeah, we heard that, too.
That's why we came.

576
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,024
[laughs]

577
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,959
- Hey!
- [gasps]

578
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,662
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!

579
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,197
I'm fine.

580
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,871
[machinery whirring]

581
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,543
Whoa, check that shit out!

582
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,382
[buzzsaw whirring]

583
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,218
[muffled yelling]

584
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,653
Wayne?

585
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,555
What is he doing in this scene?

586
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,590
Aw, geez!

587
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,193
He's supposed to be off
for the rest of the night.

588
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,161
[muffled crying continues]

589
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:26,263
Hey, move!
We can't see!

590
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,202
Oh my god, that blade is real!

591
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,538
Will you shut up?!
We paid full price for this!

592
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,006
You're blocking our view!

593
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:38,175
Yeah, move your ass!

594
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,314
He's really being cut up!

595
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,956
Sit down, you idiot!
It's fake!

596
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,025
Whoa.

597
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,371
Junior, what is that?!

598
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,040
It's okay.

599
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:13,176
Junior, look!

600
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,315
[scream]

601
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,588
[scream]

602
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,323
Junior, I need to
get off the wagon.

603
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,425
I have to go check on Wayne.

604
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:31,094
Don't let Wayne's acting
fool you.

605
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,263
His mouth was taped up.

606
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,599
Why would Wayne do that?
He loves to be heard.

607
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:39,569
it's probably just some choice
he made as an actor.

608
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,172
Agnes, don't!

609
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,541
That's dangerous!

610
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,947
Oh my god,
I'm so glad she's gone.

611
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,482
Yeah, what a nut job.

612
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,484
Can you believe
she kicked that guy?

613
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,095
Hey!

614
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,399
I work here...

615
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,269
I'm a little lost.

616
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,539
Do you think you could tell me
where the saw mill is?

617
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,279
Thanks...

618
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,997
Akimbo!
Where's Wayne?!

619
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:41,898
I don't know, why?

620
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,134
I just saw him here!

621
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:45,302
Are you sure?

622
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:47,370
I saw you cutting him up
on the table

623
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,538
and he looked hurt!

624
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,539
I'm just coming off break.

625
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,575
Someone else was working
the station.

626
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:56,713
We saw someone here
with a scarecrow mask on.

627
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,848
Maybe you're just
seeing things.

628
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,383
What's that supposed
to mean?

629
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,019
No, I saw it, too.

630
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,589
Can't you call Wayne's
cell phone or something?

631
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:07,757
There's no reception here.

632
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,894
Pickup wagon's coming in.
The woods are done.

633
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,063
All right, you're dismissed.

634
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,368
[sighs]

635
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,340
I'll see you tomorrow.

636
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,520
Hey!
Clyde!

637
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:41,057
Some shit happened tonight.
I think I saw W--

638
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,617
Put that mask back!

639
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,085
Wait!

640
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,088
You got exactly five seconds
to get off my property!

641
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,890
I work here!

642
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,892
Agnes?

643
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:19,996
I, uh, lost an earring
earlier...

644
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:25,902
Yeah...
I'm gonna go home now...

645
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,674
[door slams shut]

646
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,031
Hey.

647
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,232
Hey.

648
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:30,533
Why aren't we opening?

649
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,968
Junior hasn't shown up yet.

650
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,170
Have you heard from Wayne?

651
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:37,073
If it makes you feel any
better,
I talked to my dad this morning

652
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,908
and he said Zeke was
sound asleep in his cell

653
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,310
last night,
so it couldn't have been--

654
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:43,646
Zeke is my friend.
So no, it doesn't make me feel
any better!

655
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,849
Maybe it was
your friend, Clyde!

656
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,016
You ever think of that?!

657
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,119
He's the one writing those
dark-ass novels,

658
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:51,354
he didn't like Wayne
hitting on him at the bonfire.

659
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:54,891
Besides, Ben did dump you.

660
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,927
You work on every
single machine here.

661
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:01,097
Lemme know if you need some
work when your car breaks.

662
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,532
Love to help out.

663
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:06,603
Sorry!
Sorry, everyone!

664
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,740
Sorry!

665
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,275
Sorry!

666
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,576
Sorry, everyone!

667
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,245
Everyone listen up!

668
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,847
Has anyone seen
Wayne Jacobs?

669
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,785
[sighs]: Okay.

670
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,686
If anyone
sees or hears anything,

671
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,388
will you please let me know?

672
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,357
This is...

673
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,594
Look, I just wanna give you my
number...

674
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,130
- Clyde!
- If you think of anything else

675
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:38,334
Just...give me a call,
all right?

676
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,273
What are you doing here?

677
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,774
Any news on Wayne?

678
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,778
No, but I had a nice encounter
with Andrew Bates last night.

679
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,581
Him and his rifle caught me
looking around after work.

680
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,917
Ooh, not ideal.

681
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,820
Looks like Junior didn't get
any sleep last night, either.

682
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:58,555
Probably out looking
for Wayne.

683
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:01,157
I bet he knows something's up.

684
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,725
What the fuck's up
with that guy?

685
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:03,960
Akimbo?

686
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,563
He's mad you told the police
Zeke was the killer.

687
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,298
Tough tits.
What was I supposed to say?

688
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,399
I'd watch it.

689
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:12,368
If someone was helping Zeke,
it would be Akimbo.

690
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,305
Yeah, well I found out some
information down here.

691
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:18,975
Oktay Urissi, dragon operator
who was put away

692
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:22,579
for Lily's death, was released
from jail two days ago.

693
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:25,281
He was released the day
that Ben and Hannah died.

694
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,950
Yeah, he's probably getting
revenge on the employees

695
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:29,786
of the farm for
putting him away.

696
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,988
He's using the Bates Motel and
Haunted Hayride

697
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,290
to get away with murder.

698
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,658
Should we tell your dad?

699
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,026
If he knew what
we were trying to do,

700
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,262
he'd probably get me fired.

701
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:41,464
The key is here somewhere.

702
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,333
We just haven't found it yet.

703
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,602
Fair enough.

704
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:48,738
But I kinda already looked up
his address.

705
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,474
I think we should stake out
his place

706
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,176
Wow.

707
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,777
What website did you use?

708
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:57,113
It's called,
"the phone book," Agnes.

709
00:41:57,115 --> 00:42:00,517
Not too many people in
Gradyville named Oktay Urissi.

710
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,185
Way to think outside
the internet.

711
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,554
Agnes?

712
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,789
Is everything okay?

713
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,958
Yep, doing good!

714
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,426
Be there in a second.

715
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,295
He's like a combination of
Jed Clampet

716
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:13,463
and Eddie Munster.

717
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:14,864
You are a lucky girl, Agnes.

718
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,566
Shut up, Clyde.

719
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,334
I think he's really trying to
get me to like him

720
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:21,538
because of the whole
Lily thing.

721
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,907
Be at my place, 11 sharp!

722
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:27,010
If Oktay's up to something,
then we'll know for sure,
right?

723
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:29,379
You gonna be all right,
tonight?

724
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:31,981
I got someone watching me.

725
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,150
Creepy.

726
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,687
Bye.

727
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,154
Uh...
Uh...

728
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,991
[laughs]
Uh...

729
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:49,892
I see you brought
your Glock with you.

730
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,228
Change of plans.

731
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,331
I'm freezing my taint off.

732
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,433
Why can't we just do
the stake out in the car?

733
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:00,103
I didn't know my best friend
was a 12-year-old girl.

734
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:02,005
I didn't know my best friend
was bringing a gun.

735
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:03,239
What are you planning
on doing?

736
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,909
I don't know! Look for Wayne's
chopped up body parts?

737
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,845
You can't do something
like that and not leave

738
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:10,747
something behind.

739
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,484
What the fuck is that?

740
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,152
I don't know...

741
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,787
but I"m gonna go check it out.

742
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:20,089
Yep, that makes total sense.

743
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:23,693
Two flashes if you need me
to come back.

744
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:26,462
Three flashes if
someone's coming, okay?

745
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:29,565
And one if by land,
two if by sea.

746
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,322
[throws up]

747
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:54,957
[shotgun fires and cocks]

748
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,659
Clyde?!

749
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,828
Don't move!

750
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,697
Put the gun down, Agnes!

751
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,165
Agnes?

752
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,467
Agnes Rickover?

753
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,235
Don't hurt him!

754
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:09,872
Does your daddy know
you're out here with his gun?

755
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:13,009
Are you Oktay Urissi?

756
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:15,344
Come inside.

757
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:17,146
Both of yous.

758
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,024
Clyde!

759
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:29,225
Are you okay?

760
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,927
What the hell just happened?

761
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,261
I think I lost my hearing.

762
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:33,896
I think that was Oktay.

763
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,065
Wait a minute...
What was in the fridge?

764
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,401
No, wait a minute....
Did he just invite us inside?

765
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,436
No, wait a minute...
How does he know you?

766
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:41,804
No wait, let's get the fuck
out of here!

767
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:43,339
I think that we should
go inside.

768
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,041
What?!
Are you crazy?!

769
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,210
He owns a rifle, Agnes!
Hunting rifle!

770
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:48,544
It was pointed at my head!

771
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,079
What if he kills you
and rapes me?!

772
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,515
He would have raped you
by now if he wanted to.

773
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:54,784
I didn't come this far
just to go home!

774
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:56,586
Come on.

775
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:00,089
Okay, see you soon.

776
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,128
It's cold out there.

777
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,029
Coffee?

778
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:12,435
Your father's on his way,
you might as well relax.

779
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:13,136
Thanks.

780
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:14,704
How do you know my father?

781
00:46:14,706 --> 00:46:16,305
You were the one
in my backyard.

782
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:19,175
I think I should be
asking the questions.

783
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,379
What are you doing here?

784
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,914
We're looking for
the missing employee

785
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,048
from the Bates Motel.

786
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,584
And naturally, I know where
this person is.

787
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:30,987
Do you?

788
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,188
Is this your boyfriend?

789
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,223
- No, this is just...
- No, we're just friends.

790
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,292
- ...Clyde.
- Clyde.

791
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,629
Why was there a bloody mess
in the fridge outside?

792
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:40,730
[whispering]
There was a bloody mess?

793
00:46:40,732 --> 00:46:42,298
I didn't hear anything about
a bloody mess.

794
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,768
Why didn't you tell me about
the bloody mess?!

795
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,603
What the fuck is that?!

796
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:49,605
It's fox fur.

797
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:50,740
I sell 'em.

798
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:53,242
That bloody mess outside?

799
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:57,013
Is just an animal carcass
to attract foxes.

800
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:27,276
You didn't answer the question
about my father.

801
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,695
Dan and I went to
high school together.

802
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,530
Like most people in this town,

803
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,900
he's probably ashamed to be
associated with me.

804
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,936
No one bothers me.

805
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,374
And I don't bother no one.

806
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,654
Your father asked me
not to talk to you about Lily

807
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:14,290
if you ever came around here.

808
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,527
I didn't kill Lily.

809
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,063
Will you sit down
and hear me out?

810
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,948
Lily was one of the few
employees I got along with.

811
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,451
"Okaytay," would you like
a doughnut?

812
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:45,755
A drunk like me doesn't have
too many real friends.

813
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:50,359
But...she didn't make fun of my
name and...

814
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,229
I didn't ogle her...

815
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:56,399
...too much.

816
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:59,835
The day Lily died...

817
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:04,807
Akimbo Tonaka made some
last-minute adjustments to the
dragon.

818
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:07,710
Hey Akimbo,
need some help with this?

819
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:10,947
He needed Zeke the Geek
to help him.

820
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:12,882
Sometimes you just gotta
finesse him.

821
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:14,684
Those two thought
they knew everything.

822
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:19,255
But if you ask me, they are
a couple of idiots.

823
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:24,827
Junior, was in a particularly
chipper mood.

824
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:27,396
[all laughing]

825
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:30,466
I feel asleep sometime after.

826
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,637
My worst memory is something
I don't even recall.

827
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,608
Someone...

828
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,446
must've tampered with
the machine while I was out.

829
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:46,649
Normally I can handle
my alcohol, you know?

830
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:51,721
I didn't even drink that much!

831
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,859
Maybe I was at fault for not...

832
00:49:56,861 --> 00:50:00,529
preventing the accident...
murder, whatever.

833
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:05,101
If someone killed her...

834
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:09,171
then they also killed those
kids
at the bonfire, too.

835
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,114
I didn't kill Lily, I swear.

836
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:20,883
I can see it in your eyes.

837
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,385
You don't sleep much, either.

838
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:23,686
Excuse me?

839
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,355
You have nightmares
about her, don't you?

840
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,191
Uh-huh, I'm right.
Ain't I?

841
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,559
See?

842
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:33,295
That's a sign something
ain't right!

843
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,102
[thud]

844
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,071
Dammit.

845
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:46,709
[whispering]
He probably didn't pay

846
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:47,510
his power bill.

847
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:48,978
Oh, shut up, Clyde!

848
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,346
I'm just saying, how much
money could you make

849
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:52,348
in prison hammering
license plates?

850
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:53,315
[gun shot]

851
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:56,852
[knocking at door]
- Oktay!

852
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:58,254
Oktay, it's Dan!

853
00:50:58,256 --> 00:51:01,257
Agnes!
Where's Oktay?!

854
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:05,161
[scream]

855
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:05,995
Get out of here!

856
00:51:05,997 --> 00:51:07,730
You two have to leave,
right now!

857
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,732
Go someplace that isn't home.

858
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,468
And keep your phone
turned on.

859
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,973
Breaking news out of
Gradyville, Pennsylvania.

860
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:19,442
What the fuck just happened?!

861
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:21,544
A missing employee of the
Bates Motel

862
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:24,213
and Haunted Hayride
has just been found.

863
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:25,881
[newscaster continues]
Authorities say Wayne Jacobs,

864
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:28,117
a long-time employee
of the haunt,

865
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,852
has been found dead
on the banks of the

866
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:31,320
Delaware River earlier
this morning.

867
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:34,957
Although Jacobs was found
in 18 different pieces,

868
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:37,526
his head was identifiable
by family members.

869
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:40,062
Gradyville Sheriff Dan Rickover
joins us live...

870
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:43,532
Can you tell me what action
the authorities are taking?

871
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,868
As of right now,
we're not ruling out anything.

872
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,870
What about the death
of Lilly Hansen that occurred

873
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:49,705
at the Bates Motel
one year ago?

874
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,006
We're looking into
the possibility that

875
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:52,241
these incidents
may be connected.

876
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:55,044
The manager of the Bates
Motel and Haunted Hayride

877
00:51:55,046 --> 00:51:57,279
commented on the possible
closure of the farm.

878
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:00,749
We provide family friendly
entertainment and uh...

879
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:04,420
depend on the success of the
haunt to keep the banks away.

880
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:07,857
Thousands of people have
already bought pre-sale
tickets.

881
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:12,128
You know,
this is my family's farm!

882
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,632
You know, over 200 employees
are gonna lose their jobs,
like...

883
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,768
don't shut the farm down!

884
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,538
You don't understand!

885
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,114
About a dozen people at
Disneyland have died and...

886
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:33,616
they're still open.

887
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:35,818
So...you know, uh...

888
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,088
[newscaster]: We'll have more
on this story as it--

889
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,358
That farm always gave me
the creeps.

890
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,526
What'll it be?

891
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:45,127
[together]: Whiskey!

892
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:47,296
You got it!

893
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,198
Who's doing this?

894
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,533
I think Junior did it.

895
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:52,268
He's a fucking creep.

896
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,137
Junior was right next to me
when...

897
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,539
I saw Wayne getting cut up.

898
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,508
And he was with me when
Ben and Hannah got run over.

899
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,976
It could be Junior and Zeke.

900
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,611
What about Akimbo and Zeke.

901
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:03,646
No way.

902
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:05,281
Oh, come on.
Akimbo worked on

903
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:07,716
the fire-breathing dragon
and the table saw scene.

904
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,952
And Zeke was found
coming out of the corn

905
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:11,053
covered in blood,
the night Ben and Hannah

906
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:12,087
got chopped up.

907
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:16,192
I see how they could've
done it, but not why.

908
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:17,960
What about Oktay?

909
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:19,428
I mean, he has
the most obvious motive.

910
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,830
He wants revenge on
the Bates Motel.

911
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:26,502
There's just something about...
how he talked about Lily...

912
00:53:26,504 --> 00:53:28,971
how he knows my dad...

913
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,739
I don't think it was him.

914
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:34,076
He told us a lot of
information, Agnes.

915
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:36,912
Almost like he was confessing.

916
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,883
Maybe his partner
got to him before...

917
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,518
before he said too much.

918
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,554
That is some conspiracy
theory.

919
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,593
If Oktay's guilty,
that means that he's working

920
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:52,795
with an accomplice.

921
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:56,165
Oh my god, Agnes!

922
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:58,434
Who showed up right after the
gunshot?!

923
00:53:58,436 --> 00:53:59,068
Fuck you!

924
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,436
Think about it!

925
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,605
How can you say that
about my dad?!

926
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:03,839
Think about it!

927
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:04,573
No!

928
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,242
He's probably doing it for you!

929
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:07,810
Clyde, how can you
say these things?!

930
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:09,044
[stammering] I don't know!

931
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:10,613
I'm trying to figure this out,
too, Agnes!

932
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:11,580
Well, you're not!

933
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:12,381
Where you going?

934
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,216
I'm leaving!
Get off of me!

935
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,618
- I'm sorry.
- Don't, Clyde!

936
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,953
Stop.

937
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:19,788
Stop.

938
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,390
[loud sigh]

939
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:24,593
[catching breath]

940
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,131
I'm sorry.

941
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,303
I'm sorry, too.

942
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,205
[tapping]

943
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:38,440
Two beers.

944
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,309
On the house.

945
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:41,810
Mrs. Bates?

946
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:42,945
[muffled screams]

947
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:13,142
[muffled sobbing]

948
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,320
[muffled scream]

949
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,618
Little sneaky snake.

950
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,288
You doing a dance?

951
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,625
[breathing heavily]

952
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,464
[sighs]

953
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,544
One year ago...

954
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:27,082
you and I witnessed the
horrible death of Lily Hansen.

955
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:28,751
That...

956
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:30,686
That's something that
we shared together

957
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:31,854
without even knowing it!

958
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:34,056
[mild sobbing]

959
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,863
I felt this, um...

960
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,534
What's the word?

961
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:48,103
surge?

962
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:52,641
...of absolute horror in me.

963
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,678
There ain't nothing like it.

964
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,747
Uh...

965
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:07,122
I was as shocked as anyone
to see Lily on fire.

966
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:09,258
[Lily crying]

967
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,194
You see, uh...

968
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:18,233
Mother...soaked the platform in
gasoline and tied Lily up

969
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:29,077
Ooh...
[exhales]

970
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:35,117
I have to fell you that you're
kinda the reason we're here.

971
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:37,619
Hey.

972
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,327
When I looked into your eyes,

973
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:47,229
and...

974
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:50,833
and I experienced
your anguish...

975
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:56,138
uh...

976
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,374
It's just so hard to explain.

977
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:04,379
It's something that you gotta
see to understand.

978
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,251
[chair creeks]

979
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,490
I got something we'll
both enjoy.

980
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,270
You remember Ashley,
dontcha?

981
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:31,039
Say "hi," Ashley!

982
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:37,546
She was awfully mean to you
on your, uh...hayride.

983
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:41,617
So...I saved her as a treat
for this very moment.

984
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,355
You know, what could be...

985
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:49,391
more terrifying...

986
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:51,393
than watching someone
slowly die?

987
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,462
Soak it in.

988
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:11,647
No!
You have to look!

989
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:14,082
Look!
Open your eyes!

990
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,153
Ow!

991
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,657
That's okay.
That's okay.

992
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,363
This was supposed to be
our moment....

993
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,766
and you ruined it.

994
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:33,835
But that's all right.

995
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:36,872
There's something
even better planned.

996
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:43,579
I have to go help mother put
Clyde on the guillotine.

997
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:48,584
I'll be right back.

998
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,578
Stop!

999
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,548
I always knew
it was you, Junior.

1000
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,483
Oh, I'm sure you did.

1001
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:23,652
You wanna know how I knew?

1002
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,822
Did you put together a couple
of clues?

1003
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:28,624
I put together that you were a
fucking creep.

1004
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:30,726
Shut up!
Both of you!

1005
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:32,561
Tie him to the guillotine!

1006
01:00:32,563 --> 01:00:34,563
- Get up there.
- What?!

1007
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:37,499
I avoided getting shot
to have my head cut off?!

1008
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:39,901
[gunshot]
[screams]

1009
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:43,271
[Junior mocking Clyde]

1010
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,910
You better get up there, Clyde,
or she's gonna you again.

1011
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,659
[yells in frustration]

1012
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,936
[mockingly]
It's almost over dear.

1013
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:16,004
Stop!

1014
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,349
Akimbo?!

1015
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,550
Don't come any closer!

1016
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:29,484
What are you doing here?!

1017
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:31,953
There's a phone
in the haunted house...

1018
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,950
Ugh.

1019
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,720
Agnes?!

1020
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:07,656
Agnes!

1021
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,798
Let's stop this nonsense,
shall we, Miss Rickover?

1022
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:22,270
We have your friend.

1023
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,073
You come back,
he lives.

1024
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,943
If you leave...

1025
01:02:27,945 --> 01:02:30,245
he dies.

1026
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:36,084
[softly]
You are a sneaky snake.

1027
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:48,430
[Junior]
Clyde's worried,

1028
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:51,633
he's been asking
about you, Agnes!

1029
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:55,370
Clyde's been asking about you!

1030
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,874
[thud]

1031
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:05,547
[Junior growing impatient]
Oh Aggie!

1032
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:08,917
Clyde's worried!

1033
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:13,388
Worried about you!
Worried about me!

1034
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,927
Worried!

1035
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,433
You think Clyde can
take care of you?!

1036
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,472
Agnes!

1037
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:36,278
What's the deal with this guy
anyway, Agnes?

1038
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,713
Is he your boyfriend?

1039
01:03:38,715 --> 01:03:41,116
He wears girl's underwear?

1040
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:42,751
Is he gay?

1041
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:49,791
Aw, we could've had
something special, Agnes.

1042
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:52,661
Real special.

1043
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:56,898
Don't bother calling your dad!

1044
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,935
Cell phones don't work
on the farm.

1045
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:01,670
It's a dead zone.

1046
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:05,340
[chuckles]
I always loved that one.

1047
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:09,711
Why don't you come find us for
a chat, Agnes?

1048
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,568
We've been through
this before.

1049
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:37,906
- Are you in on this too?
- Five...

1050
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:42,077
Four...

1051
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,913
Three...

1052
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:47,716
Rubber prop, bitch!

1053
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:53,288
[gunshot]

1054
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,799
Is there like,
a point to all of this?!

1055
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:09,671
Or are you just "Pennsyltucky",
corn-picking fucking crazy?!

1056
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:12,607
Everything is more fun
when it's real!

1057
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:15,143
Tell that to your wig!

1058
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,945
[screams]

1059
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:23,718
It even smelled
like dead bodies!

1060
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:33,161
I saw what you did
to my father, Agnes!

1061
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,363
I'd like to talk to you about
it!

1062
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:36,965
- Ah!
- [Junior laughing]

1063
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:39,234
Clyde's gonna be the star
of the show!

1064
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:41,703
Really hope it doesn't go
to his head!

1065
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:44,306
No you're being a pain
in the neck, Agnes!

1066
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:46,741
- Whoa!
- Creep!

1067
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,211
You got about three minutes
to save Clyde!

1068
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:55,750
If you leave now, you might
be...ahead...of the curve.

1069
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:02,424
Oh!

1070
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:03,792
Yo!
No contact!

1071
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:05,460
How do I get to the guillotine?

1072
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,362
Through the corn, dumbass.
Don't you work here?

1073
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:08,697
Thanks!

1074
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:09,965
[engine running]

1075
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,934
Help!
Help!

1076
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:15,971
They've really got me
tied up here!

1077
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,605
Help me!

1078
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:21,276
Scream all you want.
It's a haunted hayride.

1079
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:23,611
They're all drunk.
What the fuck?!

1080
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,182
No cursing!
This is a family attraction.

1081
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:28,650
Where's Agnes?

1082
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:31,486
I told you to bring her with
you.

1083
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,290
She's on her way.

1084
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,795
Stay away from my Norman!

1085
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,799
[all scream]

1086
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,139
She must be really scared.

1087
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,449
Hear that wagon, Clyde?

1088
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:04,786
You got about 30 seconds 'til
the main event.

1089
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:09,691
Oh, look!
It's Agnes.

1090
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,760
Liar.

1091
01:07:11,762 --> 01:07:14,129
[screams]
[laughing]

1092
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:15,630
Just kidding.

1093
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:18,299
Wanna test it out.

1094
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:20,368
It works.

1095
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,938
Stop fucking around!

1096
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,482
[laughing]
Whoo!

1097
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:38,119
Hey, stop the wagon!
Yeah!

1098
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:41,322
Junior, come on, man.

1099
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:42,824
- Huh?
- Lemme go.

1100
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,659
[laughs]
Let you go?

1101
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:47,762
I'm a writer.
I can write your story.

1102
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,798
Then you could kill
all the people you want.

1103
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,000
Just not me!

1104
01:07:52,002 --> 01:07:55,837
Who here wants to see me
whack this guy's head off?

1105
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,239
[cheering]

1106
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,908
Say no!

1107
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,343
Do it!
Do it!

1108
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,313
Now hold on!
Hold on!

1109
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:08,750
Because I don't do this show
for just anyone...

1110
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:13,688
kinda a one-shot deal and I
never have the right audience.

1111
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:18,026
I said, "who here wants to see
me whack this guy's head off,

1112
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:21,930
or what?!"
[cheering]

1113
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:23,098
Chop his head off!

1114
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,701
That all right!
That's what all of you want?

1115
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:29,437
Yeah!
America!

1116
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,905
- Junior!
- What?!

1117
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:34,175
Let Clyde go right now!

1118
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,612
[softly]
Ladies and gentlemen...

1119
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:43,952
We have a very special
guest tonight...

1120
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:47,388
Miss Agnes Rickover.

1121
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,357
Hey Junior, eat a dick!

1122
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,360
[screams]

1123
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:54,095
Clyde!

1124
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:58,633
Oh yeah!
[laughing madly]

1125
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,668
That was fucking sick!

1126
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,904
Just a stupid trick,
you could see wire.

1127
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:04,772
This isn't family friendly.

1128
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:09,978
[screaming]

1129
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,480
[mocking Clyde]

1130
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:21,422
The wood warped.

1131
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:25,627
Akimbo was supposed to
fix that.

1132
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:29,164
Oh well.

1133
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,199
Two-sies.

1134
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,335
Drop it, cunt!

1135
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,837
[rifle fires]

1136
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:51,653
You shouldn't have
done that, Agnes.

1137
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:59,394
But I guess this
makes us even.

1138
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:01,029
Thanks for leaving, Clyde.

1139
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,764
Agnes, run!

1140
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:06,701
[screaming in shock]

1141
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:12,340
[laughing]

1142
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,835
[Junior]
Come on, Agnes!

1143
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:43,805
You're gonna be the best
show of all!

1144
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:57,185
- Got you.
- [screams]

1145
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:01,789
[Agnes screams]

1146
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,227
[Agnes screams]
[Junior laughs]

1147
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:08,630
We have so much
in common, Agnes!

1148
01:11:08,632 --> 01:11:10,365
Now you'll never forget
that feeling!

1149
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:12,400
What it's like to take
someone's life!

1150
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:14,335
How did that feel?

1151
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:16,204
How did that feel?

1152
01:11:16,206 --> 01:11:17,372
If you saw it,

1153
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:20,174
the memory of someone dying
stay with you.

1154
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:24,112
You will never forget the
feeling of killing someone
yourself.

1155
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,749
[knife stab]

1156
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,657
Oh!

1157
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:38,326
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Agnes!

1158
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:39,861
[screams]

1159
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,497
[Junior laughing]

1160
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:43,765
Oh, that's the stuff!

1161
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:45,566
Go for it!

1162
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:50,738
Look at me.

1163
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,614
I always knew we'd have
our moment.

1164
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:12,560
[Agnes catching her breath]

1165
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,160
Ew, that's gross!

1166
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:48,930
Oh, it's just part
of the attraction.

1167
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:52,867
[distant scream]
