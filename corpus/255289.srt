1
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,431
I was Flint's first mate
that voyage...

2
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,592
three days east of Tortola
in the Caribie.

3
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,035
Flint knew an island.

4
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,111
That's where we buried
the treasure.

5
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,273
Gold and blood,
they were Flint's trademarks.

6
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,238
He'd leave both
behind him that day.

7
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,995
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my soul</i>

8
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,117
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,352
<i>There are men whose hearts</i>
<i>are as black as coal</i>

10
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,908
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,549
<i>And they sailed their ship</i>
<i>'cross the ocean blue</i>

12
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,632
<i>A bloodthirsty captain</i>
<i>and a cutthroat crew</i>

13
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,315
<i>It's as dark a tale</i>
<i>as was ever told</i>

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,520
<i>Of the lust for treasure</i>
<i>and the love of gold</i>

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,832
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my sides</i>

16
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,275
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,989
<i>There are hungers as strong</i>
<i>as the winds and tides</i>

18
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,878
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,714
<i>And those buccaneers</i>
<i>drown their sins in rum</i>

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,076
<i>The devil himself would</i>
<i>have to call them scum</i>

21
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,596
<i>Every man aboard would have</i>
<i>killed his mate</i>

22
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,229
<i>For a bag of guineas</i>
<i>or a piece of eight</i>

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,151
<i>A piece of eight</i>

24
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,710
<i>-A piece of eight</i>
<i>-A five, six, seven, eight</i>

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,598
<i>Hulla wacka, ulla wacka</i>
<i>Something not right</i>

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,434
<i>Many wicked icky things</i>
<i>gonna happen tonight</i>

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,988
<i>Hulla wacka, moolah wacka</i>
<i>Sailor man beware</i>

28
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,073
<i>When de money in de ground</i>
<i>Dere's murder in de air</i>

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,991
<i>Murder in the air</i>

30
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,832
One more time now.

31
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,878
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my bones</i>

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,236
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

33
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,632
<i>There are secrets that sleep</i>
<i>with old Davy Jones</i>

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,950
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,316
<i>When the mainsail's set</i>
<i>and the anchor's weighed</i>

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,995
<i>There's no turning back</i>
<i>from any course that's laid</i>

37
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,675
<i>And when greed and villainy</i>
<i>sail the sea</i>

38
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,959
<i>You can bet your boots</i>
<i>there'll be treachery</i>

39
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,950
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my sails</i>

40
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,429
<i>Dead men tell no tales</i>

41
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,434
Oh, aye. Fifteen men
went ashore that day...

42
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,308
and only Flint, his own self,
returned.

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,155
Oh, aye, and then old Flinty...

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,313
up and died afore they could get
back to that cursed island...

45
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,630
and dig up the treasure.

46
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,191
No one knows to this day
who has old Flint's map.

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,556
Now, isn't that a story
worth the hearing?

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,279
It was the first dozen
times we heard it.

49
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,999
I'll drink to that.

50
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,038
But who has
the map now, huh?

51
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,829
Some black-hearted,
squid-suckin' buccaneer?

52
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,549
Or maybe it's
our very own Jim Hawkins.

53
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,471
Eh,Jimmy?

54
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,518
If I had it, my friends and I wouldn't
be here serving you rum, Mr Bones.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,989
That's right. We'd be out
searching for that treasure...

56
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,913
sailing the seven seas
on a five-year mission...

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,072
boldly going where no man
has gone before.

58
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,390
- Say, that's catchy.
- Huh. Not me.

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,473
If I had that treasure map,
I'd be tradin' it for a decent meal.

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,790
Hey, Gonzo, you think
he's gonna eat this?

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,953
Aye! Beware the one-legged man!
He's the one to fear!

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,712
Don't worry, Captain.
We'll watch for him.

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,519
Yeah, I'll watch for him,
if he's deliverin' a pizza.

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,271
Even old Flinty
feared him.

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,114
If he comes pokin' 'round here,
you run for me whippety-quick!

66
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,760
- If we see him, we'll tell you.
- Yeah. One leg, three heads...

67
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,671
couple of dozen noses--
if anything weird happens--

68
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,797
And it'll be nay
jokin' matter, hose nose.

69
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,838
The one-legged man
brings death.

70
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,229
Time, gentlemen!

71
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,151
It's closing time!

72
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,390
Ya pays your bills,
and then ya shove off.

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,436
Go on. Out ya go!

74
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,189
Oh, you're drunk again,
are ya?

75
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,158
Boys, look at the state
of this place!

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,549
How comes it gets to be
such a pigsty, huh?

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,471
Pigsty? Hey!

78
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,710
No offence meant, gentlemen, sirs.
No offence meant.

79
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,030
- Here's to you, boys!
- Time!

80
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,190
- I'm away to my room.
- Thank you, Mr Bones.

81
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,633
- Thank you, Bill.
- There you go!

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,632
Don't forget to come back tomorrow
for our lunchtime special:

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,597
- roast suckling--
- Huh?

84
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,274
- Potatoes, sir. Potatoes.
- All right.

85
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,193
No-- No offence, madam.
No offence.

86
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,670
All right, boys.

87
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,320
When you're finished here,
you can go and clean up in the kitchen.

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,119
I left some table scraps
in there for your supper.

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,760
Oh, yes, and, boys...

90
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,400
last night you forgot
to put out the lantern!

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,190
If you forget that again,
there'll be no table scraps for a week!

92
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,869
You're standing on my ear.

93
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,951
Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, Rizzo!

94
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,952
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's it. Steady.

95
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,032
- I hate my life.
- I hate your life too.

96
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,954
- If I had a life, I'd hate it.
- I should just run off to sea
like my father did.

97
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,635
He was my age when he sailed
to China as a cabin boy
and he wound up a first mate.

98
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,631
Run off to sea
and just leave everybody?

99
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,359
Who's everybody?
I'm an orphan. I've got no family.

100
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,557
- Hey, you got us!
- Yeah, we're family. Got it.

101
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,798
I mean, some family we are. Be serious,
Rizzo. We don't exactly look alike.

102
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,954
Okay, all right. So I'm a rat and you're
a human being and Gonzo's a, uh--

103
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,508
- Whatever.
- Yeah. We're still family.

104
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,353
- Yeah.
- But I wish my life were more like...

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,158
one of Captain Bones'
adventures...

106
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,708
sailing the high seas and
searching for buried treasure.

107
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,679
Yeah, discovering lost islands
and weird civilizations.

108
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,911
Navigating with my father's old compass
to wherever the wind may take us.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,436
- Off to Zanzibar
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.
- Here they go again.

110
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,590
To the southwest,
pirate galleons!

111
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,877
To the southeast, multi-armed
Zanzibanian shark women...

112
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,951
and their exploding wigs
of death!

113
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,679
To the northwest,
dirty dishes!

114
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,591
How does she do that?

115
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,717
- Might as well start. I'll wash.
- Oh, yeah. I'll dry.

116
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,597
I'll break.

117
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,910
<i>I look around here</i>
<i>and I want to cry</i>

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,831
Me too. Yeah.

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,992
<i>I feel like the world</i>
<i>is passing me by</i>

120
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,433
It is.

121
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,954
<i>And I just can't</i>
<i>help but wonder</i>

122
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,429
<i>Am I doomed to wash and dry</i>

123
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,719
<i>And is it a curse I'm under</i>
<i>to do it till I die</i>

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,268
- Oh, I hope not.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,749
<i>- When I could be an explorer</i>
- Sure ya could.

126
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,990
<i>- Sailing off to distant lands</i>
- Not so fast.

127
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,911
<i>Instead of spending</i>
<i>every afternoon</i>

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,070
<i>Just getting dishpan hands</i>

129
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,392
<i>My future looks like nowhere</i>
<i>that I want to be</i>

130
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,517
<i>There's gotta be</i>
<i>something better</i>

131
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,033
<i>Something better</i>

132
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,193
<i>There's gotta be something</i>
<i>better than this for me</i>

133
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,918
Well, now you're talkin'.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,073
<i>If it's weird and wild</i>
<i>let's go and find it</i>

135
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,913
<i>The crazier, the better</i>
<i>is what I say</i>

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,399
Yeah, that's true.

137
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,517
<i>To tell the truth</i>
<i>I really wouldn't mind it</i>

138
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,510
Mind what?

139
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,674
<i>If we found someplace</i>
<i>with ten square meals a day</i>

140
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,591
<i>Let danger call my name</i>

141
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,114
<i>If it does</i>
<i>I'm gonna hide</i>

142
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,158
<i>I'll put my courage</i>
<i>to the test</i>

143
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,310
<i>And I'll be</i>
<i>by your side</i>

144
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,391
<i>He'll be by your side</i>

145
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,554
<i>There's gotta be</i>
<i>something better than this</i>

146
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,155
<i>- Something more than this</i>
<i>- I know that there's so much out there</i>

147
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,073
<i>- To see</i>
<i>- To see</i>

148
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,310
<i>And I know</i>
<i>this life I'm living</i>

149
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,393
<i>Can't be my destiny</i>

150
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,109
<i>There's gotta be</i>
<i>something better</i>

151
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,918
<i>Something better</i>

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,709
<i>There's gotta be something</i>
<i>better than this for me</i>

153
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,190
- And me!
- Wait a minute. What about me?

154
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,070
<i>There's something better</i>
<i>than this for you and</i>

155
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:41,400
<i>Me</i>

156
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,596
Enough of this singin'!

157
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,433
Rum! I need rum, lads!

158
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,830
I got the horrors!
Give me rum!

159
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,558
Rum till I float!

160
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,757
All right! All right!
Just one small one.

161
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,479
Don't be giving him
any more rum!

162
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,916
How does she blooming do that?

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,274
Shh! Shh!

164
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,118
Billy Bones!
It's me, Blind Pew.

165
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,590
I know you're here, Billy.

166
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,353
Ya snivelling coward!

167
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,318
It's some kind
of a blind fiend.

168
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,311
I believe they prefer
''visually challenged fiend.''

169
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,190
Ah, I heard that!
There's someone here!

170
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,510
Uh, no. Over here!

171
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,231
Hmm, over here.

172
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,075
Billy Bones! Ah,
I'd know that scurvy mug...

173
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,197
of yours anywhere.

174
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,191
Excuse me, sir,
but the bar is closed.

175
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,199
Aha. A pretty
little girl, is it?

176
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,193
Yes. Take me
to Billy Bones, my pet.

177
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,952
Y-You've come
to the wrong place.

178
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,918
Th-There's no Billy Bones here,
and I'm not a girl.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,120
Oh, I may be visually challenged,
but I can see you're lying.

180
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,952
Huh?

181
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,192
Good evening, Bill.
I know it's you.

182
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,831
Yes. You thought you could
get away with it, didn't you?

183
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,434
Just take it all
for yourself...

184
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,718
and leave your shipmates
with nothing.

185
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,429
We're not pleased with that,
Bill. Not at all.

186
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,798
We want you to have this!

187
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,150
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cat!

188
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,309
The Black Spot!

189
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,758
But I don't understand.
What is the Black Spot?

190
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,400
The Black Spot's
a pirate's death sentence!

191
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,473
- Fabulous.
- They'll be comin' to kill me tonight!

192
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,391
- We'd better help.
- Yeah, yeah, let's get some stuff.

193
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,916
- It's my sea chest them lubbers want.
- Underwear.

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,913
But I'll trick them! I'll shake out
another reef and daddle 'em again!

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,197
You wanna run that by us again
in English, Mr Bones?

196
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,589
It's mine! I'm goin'
for that treasure myself!

197
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,990
And no one-legged
son of a bilge rat will--

198
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,869
Captain Bones!

199
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,070
He died? And this is supposed
to be a kids' movie.

200
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,232
Jimmy.Jim.
Jimmy,Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.

201
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,198
You always been a decent sort
to old Billy Bones.

202
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,589
But I'm not Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.

203
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,319
He's Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.

204
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,833
-Jim!
- Yes, Captain.

205
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,229
Jim,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jim,
Jim,Jim,Jim.

206
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,550
- Yes, Captain. What is it?
- Take the map!

207
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,949
- What map?
- The map to old Flint's treasure!

208
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,871
Don't ya understand
what I been tellin' ya?

209
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,236
I was Flinty's first mate!
We all were! Blind Pew and me!

210
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,311
Me own shipmates,
they'll gully me for sure!

211
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,356
And anybody else to get
their mitts on that map!

212
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,476
A-And gullying hurts, right?

213
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,516
Oh, aye! A lot!

214
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,433
- So quick.
- Go to my sea chest! Get the map!

215
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,397
Oh, yeah.

216
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,439
- Oh, there. There.
- Oh, I think I've-- Oh, no.

217
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,478
- Hey, guys, look!
- Rizzo!

218
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,391
Oh, here!
How about this?

219
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,391
Let's see.

220
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,795
Hey, Rizzo, look.

221
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,956
- It is a treasure map.
- We're gonna be rich.

222
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,871
- We're gonna be dead.
- Beware, lads!

223
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,951
Beware!

224
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,508
- What? The one-legged man?
- Aye! But also...

225
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,912
beware runnin' with scissors
or any other pointy objects.

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,630
It's all good fun till
somebody loses an--

227
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,671
Captain?

228
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,317
We're standing in a room
with a dead guy!

229
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,631
Jim!

230
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,556
Oh, Billy Bones!
Trick or treat!

231
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,989
Don't try to hide, Billy!
You know what we want!

232
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,199
Where are ya, Billy Bones?
Where are ya, Billy?

233
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,632
Mrs Bluveridge!

234
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,554
There's no use in hiding!

235
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,279
Can't a woman get her
beauty sleep any more?

236
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,709
Jim, what you doing?

237
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,875
Aha! Aha!

238
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,793
Oh! Voila!

239
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,510
- Okay, okay. I found the gun.
- Oh, now we gotta load it.

240
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,068
- Okay.
- Oops.

241
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,229
Okay, where does Mrs Bluveridge
keep the bullets?

242
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,552
Billy's dead, and he hasn't
got the blooming map!

243
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,108
- Those little girls must have it.
- Yeah!

244
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,031
- Get them!
- Yeah!

245
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,951
- Gonzo! Gonzo!
- What? What?

246
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,918
I found the bullets. See?
Here they are. They--

247
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,911
Oops.

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,639
Open up in there!
We wants the map...

249
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,598
and we'll skewer anybody
who gets in the way!

250
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,353
Quick,Jim! The back stairs!

251
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,271
Come on.

252
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,918
Run! Run!

253
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,592
Get out of my inn,
you tattooed miseries!

254
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,989
Can't a woman
get a night's sleep alone?

255
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,036
You come here, you!

256
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,998
This gun is useless!

257
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,198
- You lost all the bullets!
- Well, you're losin' the powder.

258
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,794
The map!
Tell us where it is or die!

259
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,791
- Get them!
- Run! Run, run, run!

260
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,157
Hurry! Hurry!

261
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,356
Hurry!

262
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,756
Outta the way! Outta the way!
Get outta the way!

263
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,999
Stop!

264
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,638
Oh, Woof.

265
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,948
Geronimo!

266
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,109
Guys!

267
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,838
Wow! What an exit!

268
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,751
- Right through a brick wall!
- I am in such pain.

269
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,876
Come on!

270
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,829
I think I smell
something burning, no?

271
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,036
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

272
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,754
We can't go home, so--

273
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,869
Oh, no. Uh-uh. No way. You're not
taking me on some crazy treasure hunt.

274
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,679
- I am staying right here!
- Oh, good idea, Rizzo.

275
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,638
Then you can see what half-burned,
vicious pirates look like.

276
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,280
What are we waitin' for?
Gimme that map. Come on. Let's go.

277
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,079
Wait a minute.
What about Mrs Bluveridge?

278
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,555
I'll be fine, boys!
Run for it!

279
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,549
How does she do that?

280
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,071
Who's gonna clean
all this up?

281
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,790
Two for a penny, sir?

282
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,317
- I don't want a baked potato.
- Lovely hot baked potatoes.

283
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,397
- Oh, let's see.
- What a night.

284
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,550
- There it is!
- Huh? Oh.
- Oh.

285
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,753
''Trelawny & Son
Master Ship Builders''

286
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,595
Whoa, whoa!
Reality check here, guys!

287
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,671
Do we actually believe some
bozo's gonna give us a ship...

288
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,591
just because we show him
Captain Bones' map?

289
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,834
- It's worth a try, Rizzo.
- I don't know.

290
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,478
May I help you?

291
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,997
Yes. Thank you. We wish to speak
with Squire Trelawney, the shipbuilder.

292
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,036
- We need a ship.
- Ah, I'm sorry.

293
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,317
The squire's in Long Neddry
for the grouse season.

294
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,393
He will return
on the feast of St Lulu.

295
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,431
- Thank you.
- That's that.
- Oh, well.

296
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,431
Of course, his rich...

297
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,230
half-wit son
young Squire Trelawney's here.

298
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,788
We'll see him, then.

299
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,872
Well, gentlemen...

300
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,748
this is definitely a genuine,
bona fide treasure map.

301
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,990
Really!

302
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,752
Yes. Mr Bimbo told me so.

303
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,396
Oh, Mr Bimbo lives in my finger.
He's very smart. He's been to the moon.

304
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,873
Thank you. Twice.

305
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,350
- I smell a bozo.
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,275
Well done, Beakie.

307
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,920
Now we know that is definitely
too much gunpowder.

308
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,029
Beaker, stop fooling around.
We've got company.

309
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,753
Oh, hello, chappies. Everyone, this is
Dr Livesey and his assistant, Beaker.

310
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,149
They do research
and development for my papa.

311
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,593
Hello.

312
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,830
Actually, Squire, we were
hoping to meet your father.

313
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,152
- We need a ship for an ocean voyage.
- Ocean? Ocean.

314
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,189
- Ocean?
- You know, the ocean?
The big, blue, wet thing?

315
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,795
Oh! Th-The big,
blue, wet thing! Yes!

316
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,030
Say, I know
what's happening here.

317
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,396
You chaps are planning
to sail to this island, aren't you?

318
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,438
- To dig up this treasure.
- Yes, but we must be quiet about it.

319
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,159
- There are pirates
looking for this map.
- Yeah, and they wanna kill us for it.

320
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,470
Isn't that exciting?

321
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,677
Pirates, eh?
Well, that settles it.

322
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,591
We'll use one
of my daddy's boats...

323
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,673
and I will personally finance
the voyage for the treasure myself.

324
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,709
- You'll do that? Really?
- What are rich, half-wit sons for?

325
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,869
Well, here's the dock.
Jim, where's our boat?

326
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,951
We're on a dock?
No wonder I'm seasick.

327
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,679
- Ahoy!
- Ah, morning, Squire.

328
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,196
Welcome. Welcome.
Ah, there she is:

329
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,236
the <i>Hispaniola</i>.

330
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,151
Wow!

331
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,076
- Come on. Let's go!
- Yeah, let's go.

332
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,558
- ''Take a cruise,'' you said.
- Huh?

333
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,108
- ''See the world,'' you said.
- Huh?

334
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,034
Now here we are stuck
on the front of this stupid ship.

335
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,908
Well, it could be worse.
We could be stuck in the audience.

336
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,913
Well, Mr Bimbo...

337
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,150
the ship is provisioned,
the crew is in place...

338
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,879
and the captain should be
on board within the hour.

339
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,871
You have been
a busy little man.

340
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,953
- Oh, look, there goes Jim.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

341
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,508
Ooh! Ooh, look!

342
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,511
It's the boat
steering thing.

343
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,511
This is called the helm.

344
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,513
Hey, how does it feel,
Captain Hawkins?

345
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,909
Feels like
we're really doing it.

346
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,958
It feels like we're finally
having an adventure!

347
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,679
Yeah. I'm starvin'.
Where's the kitchen?

348
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,038
<i>Heigh ho and up she rises</i>

349
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,237
- Something smells good.
<i>- Heigh ho and up she rises</i>

350
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,788
- Cool.
<i>- Heigh ho and up she rises</i>

351
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,475
<i>Early in the morning</i>

352
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,472
<i>Put him in the longboat</i>
<i>until he's sober</i>

353
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,677
<i>Put him in the longboat</i>
<i>till he's sober</i>

354
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,274
<i>Put him in the longboat</i>
<i>till he's sober</i>

355
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,191
<i>Early in the morning</i>

356
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,397
What have we here?
Stowaways!

357
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,712
I'm afraid we shish-kebab
and barbecue stowaways on this ship.

358
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,995
Wait. I know.
You must be the cabin boys.

359
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,117
- Yeah.
- Hungry, lads?

360
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,317
Well, in my galley, you're always
welcome to help yourselves!

361
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,709
Yes! Thank you!

362
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,992
Oh, yes!

363
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,152
Well, he's got a healthy appetite.
How about you, funny face?

364
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,071
- Huh?
- Here.

365
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,435
Hey. Thank you.

366
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,909
My name is Gonzo,
and the guy in your chicken is Rizzo.

367
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,112
- And you must be Master Hawkins.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,636
Oh, you needn't be callin'
a lowly ship's cook ''sir.''

369
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,679
Long John Silver,
at your humble service.

370
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,354
We're just cabin boys,
Mr Silver.

371
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,115
Long John to his friends.

372
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,792
And believe me, lad...

373
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,112
a friend you can trust
is worth his weight in gold.

374
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,751
There's many a dark-hearted
scoundrel in these ports.

375
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,831
Well, what do you mean?
Pirates?

376
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,354
- Shh!
- Pirates! That's rich!

377
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,273
Pirates? What an imagination.
Give me a cracker.

378
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,477
Allow me to introduce
my pet lobster Polly.

379
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,710
Pieces of eight!
Pieces of eight!

380
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,631
Raised him
from a fingerling, I did.

381
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,156
As fine a crustacean
as a man could ask for.

382
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,198
B-But I thought sailors
had talking parrots as pets.

383
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,430
Talking parrots?

384
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,752
What an imagination.
First pirates, now talking parrots?

385
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,753
What's next? A singing, dancing mouse
with his own amusement park?

386
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,876
That's enough now, Polly.
Go on! Shoo!

387
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,953
Right, me hearties. I'm gonna give you
a cook's tour of this fine ship.

388
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,395
If you're gonna be the cook
on this ship, Mr Silver...

389
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,835
I am definitely gonna need
bigger pants.

390
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,471
What's the matter, lads?

391
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,079
Oh, that?

392
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,359
Lost that timber-fighting brigands
off Madagascar under Admiral Hawke.

393
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,399
There's many a man lost a leg and worse
in the service of the king.

394
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,031
Why, look what a cannibal
took off me...

395
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,759
in exchange for me own life.

396
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,715
Oh, you're a fine pair, lads.
That you are.

397
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,917
Bright as buttons,
the lot of ye.

398
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,798
- All hands on deck!
- Come on, then, lads.

399
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,033
Chop-chop! Look lively now.
The captain will be here soon.

400
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,792
Chop-chop.

401
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,916
- Who's that?
- That is Mr Arrow, the first mate,
a capital fellow.

402
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,793
The captain approaches.

403
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,560
Move aside! Make way!
Make ready for the captain!

404
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,676
Lollygaggers will suffer
his wrath!

405
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,591
Wrath? I-Is this captain
bad-tempered?

406
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,593
Is he bad-tempered?
The man is a raging volcano...

407
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,434
tormented by inner demons the likes
of which mere mortals cannot fathom.

408
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,556
He's got demons? Cool!

409
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,831
Maniac!

410
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,029
Heigh-ho, everyone.

411
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,634
- What-- That--
- That's the raging volcano?

412
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,474
- He's a frog.
- Maybe he gets hopping mad.

413
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,471
Hopping mad.

414
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,590
Piping aboard
Captain Abraham Smollett.

415
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,351
Good day, Mr Arrow.

416
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,557
I knew it.
He's furious.

417
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,551
- Ah, you there!
- Me?

418
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,916
You were in charge of railing dust.
Thirty lashes, and then
you walk the plank.

419
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,879
- I didn't say that, Mr Arrow.
- I was anticipating your whim, sir.

420
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,997
Oh. You must be
the cabin boys.

421
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,230
- Yes, sir!
- Which one of you is Hawkins?

422
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,151
I am, sir.

423
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,390
I knew your father,Jim.
He was a good man.

424
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,948
Thank you, sir.

425
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,511
Well, this is shapin' up
to be a fine voyage, lads.

426
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,068
Oh, yes, indeed.

427
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,480
One leg,Jim.
Count 'em. One.

428
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,348
- Remember what Billy Bones said.
- Oh, Gonzo, he seems all right.

429
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,319
I mean, Long John's only a cook.
How dangerous could he be?

430
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,198
Well, I don't know, but I--
Wait a minute. Where's Rizzo?

431
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,238
Enjoy your cruise, sir.
Next!

432
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,869
All right, folks, have your cheques
made out to ''Rat Tours Limited.''

433
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,077
Remember, we put
the rat in ''pirate.''

434
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,431
Why, thank you,
Mr Plagueman. Next!

435
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,671
- Rizzo, what are you doing?
- What? Oh, this.

436
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,591
Well, I figure
if the treasure map's a dud...

437
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,639
the trip won't be a total loss,
financially speaking.

438
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,110
Well, the wind seems to be freshening.
The tide is with us.

439
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,033
Mr Arrow,
this voyage has begun.

440
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,318
This voyage has begun!
Raise the gangplank!

441
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,834
- Right, lads!
- Let go forward line!

442
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,390
Let go aft line.
Hard to starboard.

443
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,119
Any man caught dawdling
will be shot on sight.

444
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,156
- I didn't say that.
- I was just paraphrasing.

445
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,836
- Mr Arrow, just set the sails.
- Set the sails!

446
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,791
Hey, where's my camera?

447
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,395
- I'll miss you! I said I'll miss you!
- We'll send postcards!

448
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,675
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

449
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,480
<i>When the course is laid</i>
<i>and the anchor's weighed</i>

450
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,028
<i>A sailor's blood</i>
<i>begins racing</i>

451
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,953
<i>With our hearts unbound</i>
<i>and our flag unfurled</i>

452
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,793
<i>We're underway and off</i>

453
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,269
<i>Underway and off</i>

454
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,669
<i>Heave ho, we'll go</i>

455
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,558
<i>Anywhere the wind</i>

456
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,235
<i>Manly men are we</i>

457
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,198
<i>Sailing for adventure</i>
<i>on the deep blue sea</i>

458
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,035
Safely now, Mr Silver. Let's not
get sloppy just because we're singing.

459
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,032
- Aye, aye, sir.
<i>- Danger walks on deck</i>
<i>We say what the heck</i>

460
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,350
<i>We laugh at the perils</i>
<i>we're facing</i>

461
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,193
<i>Every storm we ride</i>
<i>is its own reward</i>

462
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,953

463
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,600
<i>People die</i>

464

466
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,113
<i>Hoist the sails and sing</i>

<i>Sailing for adventure</i>

468
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,275
<i>I love to see 'em cry</i>

469
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,194
<i>I prefer to cut a throat</i>

470
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,840
<i>I love to hang 'em high</i>

471
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,276
<i>Try to walk in the air</i>
<i>while their faces turn blue</i>

472
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,191
Just kidding.

473
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,350
<i>It's a good life on a boat</i>

474
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,000
<i>There are distant lands</i>
<i>with burning sands</i>

475
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,640
<i>That call across the oceans</i>

476
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,518
<i>There are bingo games</i>
<i>every fun-filled day</i>

477
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,239
<i>And margaritas</i>
<i>at the midnight buffet</i>

478

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,916

493
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,869
All right, Mr Bimbo. I didn't know
you had such a good singing voice.
Thank you.

494
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,474
<i>We'll chase our dreams</i>

00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,040
<i>Heigh ho, we'll go</i>

497
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,759
<i>Anywhere the wind</i>
<i>is blowing</i>

498
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,674
<i>Bold and brave and free</i>

499
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,069
<i>- Sailing for adventure</i>
- It's so nauseating!

500
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,799
<i>- Sailing for adventure</i>
- So exhilarating!

501
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,599
<i>- Sailing for adventure</i>
- We're all celebrating!

502
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,879
<i>On the deep blue sea</i>

503
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,834
Ahoy!

504
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,319
Roll call!

505
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,635
- Long John Silver?
- Aye, aye, sir!

506
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,154
- Short Stack Stevens?
- Aye!

507
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,992
- One-Eyed Jack?
- Aye!

508
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,150
- Black-Eyed Pea.
- Yeah.

509
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,037
- Walleyed Pike.
- Aye.

510
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,111
Polly Lobster.

511
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,509
- Mad Monty.
- Aye.

512
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,398
- Sweetums.
- Aye.

513
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,431
- Old Tom.
- Aye, aye.

514
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,794
- Real Old Tom.
- Aye.

515
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,838
- Dead Tom?
- Aye, aye.

516
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,992
Cool.

517
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,991
- Clueless Morgan?
- Huh?

518
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,071
Headless Bill.

519
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,628
Headless Bill.

520
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,432
Big-Fat-Ugly-Bug-Face-
Baby-Eating O'Brien?

521
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,873
Aye.

522
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,873
- Angel Marie.
- Aye, aye.

523
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,597
Gentlemen, may I see you
in my cabin?

524
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,750
- Immediately?
- Mm-hmm.

525
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,718
Who hired this crew? This is
undoubtedly the seediest bunch...

526
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,870
of cutthroats, villains
and scoundrels I have ever seen!

527
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,030
So who hired 'em?

528
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,871
Your finger hired the crew?

529
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,159
No, that's silly. The man who lives
in my finger hired the crew: Mr Bimbo.

530
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,196
What? Ah!

531
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,239
Yeah, he relied heavily on the advice
of our excellent cook, Long John Silver.

532
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,030
A cook? And a guy who lives
in a bear's finger?

533
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,997
Exactly!

534
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,871
I'm starting to worry
about this voyage.

535
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,713
Jim, I know Billy Bones
gave you the treasure map...

536
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,633
but I hope you'll give it
to me for safekeeping.

537
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,314
I'll be careful with it, sir.

538
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,516
Beggin' your pardon,
gentlemen...

539
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,955
but I've come with a bit
of a treat for you.

540
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,077
'Tis my very own best brandy...

541
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,311
laid down by the brothers
of Buckfast Abbey...

542
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,233
vintage 1 737...

543
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,232
to toast
to a prosperous voyage.

544
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,312
- Oh, spiffy.
- I'm sorry, Mr Silver, but I'm not...

545
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,039
going to allow drinking
on this voyage.

546
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,078
- Oh, well, rules are rules.
- Oh, but, sir...

547
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,436
'tis a tradition for the officers
to toast to the success of a voyage.

548
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,999
Ah, very true.

549
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,877
No, we must set an example
for this questionable crew.

550
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,997
There will be no consumption
of alcohol of any kind.

551
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,595
Oh, sir, but I can vouch
for this crew myself.

552
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,478
You could sail to heaven
and back with these men.

553
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,790
Well, I'm afraid
I must disagree with you.

554
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,393
Oh.

555
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,630
You wanna knock it off
with the booze?

556
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,188
It's peeling the paint
off of the shuffleboard court.

557
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,748
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
- Come on, girls.
- We told him.

558
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,831
And that's that.
This conversation is finished.

559
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,956
I understand, sir.

560
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,952
I shall tend to my duty
and see to it...

561
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,113
that every drop of alcohol
is thrown overboard.

562
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,636
Come on,Jim.
Don't bother, Captain.

563
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,188
You can go
if you want to,Jim.

564
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,111
- Come on.
- Yeah.

565
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,271
Oh, well. I guess the human beings
wanna hang out together...

566
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,271
don't wanna spend time
with a rat and a, uh--

567
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,669
- Uh, uh, whatever.
- Yeah.

568
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,870
- Say cheese!
- Cheese!

569
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,110
Oh, that's great.

570
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,111
Cute couple.

571
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,232
Stop it!

572
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,709
I never felt
like this before.

573
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,631
- Denise, what I'm trying to say--
- Yes?

574
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,551
- What I'm trying to say is--
- Yes?

575
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,471
- What I mean to say is, I--
- Yes?

576
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,228
I'm sorry your present
didn't work out.

577
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,995
Oh,Jim, Smollett sails
by rules and laws.

578
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,719
That's what bein' a captain's
all about.

579
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,711
Me, I sails by the stars.

580
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,593
Stars?

581
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,355
North,Jim. Find me north out there
among them stars.

582
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,396
Well, that's easy.

583
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,391
Ah, yeah, but what
if you don't have a compass?

584
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,789
Long John, please don't drop it.
It was my father's.

585
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,711
It's all I have of his.
Please. Please.

586
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,830
I'm sorry, lad.
I were only foolin'.

587
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,714
- How old were you when he died, then?
- Seven.

588
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,519
I were eight
when my father died at sea.

589
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,071
- First mate, he was.
- My father was a first mate too.

590
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,515
Was he, now?

591
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,672
By the powers.
What a coincidence.

592
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,799
Now,Jim, that be Polaris,
the North Star.

593
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,395
Even in the China Sea,
that's north.

594
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,948
- North. Polaris.
- Uh-huh.

595
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,794
- So we must be heading southwest.
- Smart as paint you are, lad.

596
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,599
Smart as paint.

597
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,956
Now, that gets old Long John
to wonderin'.

598
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,990
Why would we be
sailin' southwest?

599
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,518
The scuttlebutt
among the crew is that, uh...

600
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,670
we're sailin'
for buried treasure...

601
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,877
and, uh, someone on board...

602
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,871
has a map.

603
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,278
'Course,
none of my concern,Jim.

604
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,669
I'm just a ship's cook.

605
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,673
Such matters are best suited
to Captain Smollett.
He runs this ship, not I.

606
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,877
Come on, Long John.
You could captain this ship.

607
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,918
That I could, lad.

608
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,150
Maybe someday I will.

609
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,031
- Moonlight swim?
- Okay.

610
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,995
Oh, Smolly, my love for you...

611
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,640
is deeper than
the deep, blue sea.

612
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,839
Get on with you! Go on!

613
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,989
Hi,Jim!

614
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,358
- Yo,Jimbo! Mornin', Long--
- Hi, Long John. Good morning.

615
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,954
Well, at least one of us
is having a good time.

616
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,396
Ah, Rizzo, it's not so bad.
Angel Marie said that later on...

617
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,314
he'd throw a line out the back
and let me drag along the bottom.

618
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,949
I don't know about this crew.
I feel like they're always
watchin' us, just waitin' to pounce.

619
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,235
That's just a figment
of your imagination.

620
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,790
This is a figment
of my imagination?

621
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,996
Now, tell us
where the map is...

622
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,355
or we'll tear ya
limb from limb!

623
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,715
Never. My friend
and I will never tell.

624
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,360
Hey, hey, there could be
extenuatin' circumstances.

625
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,715
I mean, you know--
Wh-- I b-- If--

626
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,677
Maybe they'll ask
real nice.

627
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,591
- In your dreams!
- Do it, Monty! Do it!

628
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,989
Yeah, do it to me!

629
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,751
Yes! More!

630
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,798
- Oh, no, I can't look.
- Look at this!

631
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,155
I'm taller!
This is so cool!

632
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,357
I may even have a future
with the NBA.

633
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,432
This won't work! He likes it!
Let's torture the rat!

634
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,511
- Huh? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Yeah!

635
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,433
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes.

636
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,557
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, please, no! I hate basketball!

637
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,918
I got a lovely recipe
for blackened rat.

638
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,834
I say!
This does not look safe!

639
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,398
- What? What? What? What?
- I b-- I burned my hand.

640
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,152
Kiss it or something!

641
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,518
Poodly, poodly, poodly,
poodly, poodly.

642
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,558
Mr Arrow, lock those three up
for the remainder of the voyage.

643
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,471
- Yes, sir!
- You can't hold us!

644
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,518
- To the brig! Move along!
- Will you stop crying!
Will you shut up!

645
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,639
- Move along.
- Oh, good. That's good. Yeah.

646
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,393
Master Hawkins, may I see you
in my cabin, please?

647
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,278
Yes, sir.

648
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,828
- Ready, Mr Gonzo?
- Ready!

649
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,911
Tie off the rope, Beaker!

650
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,516
We call this
the window shade cure.

651
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,909
All right.
Snip, snip, snip.

652
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,148
Oh, great! Wow!

653
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,029
That was so cool!

654
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,509
Hmm? Oh, sure.

655
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,238
- Who's the lady pig, sir?
- Never mind that,Jim. Listen.

656
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,756
I'm hoping you're willing
to give me the map now,
considering what's just happened.

657
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,751
I'd rather not, sir.

658
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,511
I'd hoped it wouldn't
come to this,Jim, but...

659
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,591
as captain, I order you
to give me the map.

660
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,316
- Mr Arrow?
- Aye, aye, Captain.

661
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,436
Lock up this treasure map.

662
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,549
It will be safe
in here, sir.

663
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,112
It's been six weeks
since we left England.

664
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,474
Five days
since we had a breeze.

665
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,471
No!

666
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,073
I got the madness!

667
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,632
I got cabin fever!

668
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,439
I've got it too!

669
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,318
Cabin fever!

670
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,870
<i>I got cabin fever</i>
<i>It's burning in my brain</i>

671
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,589
<i>I got cabin fever</i>
<i>It's driving me insane</i>

672
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,355
<i>We got cabin fever</i>
<i>We're flipping our bandannas</i>

673
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,750
<i>Been stuck at sea so long</i>
<i>that we have simply gone bananas</i>

674
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,919
<i>We, we, we got cabin fever</i>

675
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,956
<i>We lost what sense we had</i>

676
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,350
<i>We got cabin fever</i>
<i>We're all going mad</i>

677
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,035
<i>Grab your partner by the ears</i>
<i>Lash him to the wheel</i>

678
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,351
<i>Do-si-do, step on his toe</i>
<i>Listen to him squeal</i>

679
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,476
<i>Allemande left</i>
<i>Allemande right</i>

680
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,630
<i>It's time to sail or sink</i>

681
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,631
<i>Swing your partner</i>
<i>over the side</i>

682
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,678
<i>- Drop him in the drink</i>
- We've got cabin fever.

683
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,513
- No ifs, ands or buts.
- We're disoriented.

684
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,955
- And demented.
- And a little nuts.

685
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,993
<i>Volkswagen car</i>

686
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,156
<i>We were sailing, sailing</i>

687
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,151
<i>The wind was on our side</i>

688
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,831
And then it died.

689
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,037
<i>I got cabin fever</i>
<i>I think I lost my grip</i>

690
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,159
<i>I'd like to get my hands</i>
<i>on whoever wrote this script</i>

691
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:34,473
<i>I was floating</i>
<i>'neath the tropic moon</i>

692
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,996
<i>And dreaming</i>
<i>of a blue lagoon</i>

693
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,356
<i>Now I'm as crazy as a loon</i>

694
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,115
<i>Cabin fever</i>
<i>has ravaged all aboard</i>

695
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,397
<i>This one small vessel</i>
<i>has become a floating psycho ward</i>

696
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,234
<i>We were sailing, sailing</i>
<i>heading who knows where</i>

697
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,118
<i>And now though</i>
<i>we're all here</i>

698
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,237
<i>We're not all there</i>

699
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,755
Cabin fever!

700
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,795
- The wind is back.
- What are we doing?

701
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,189
What's goin' on here?

702
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,589
- What was that?
- I feel like such a fool.

703
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,116
- Yeah, me too.
- I hope nobody saw that. Embarrassing.

704
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,111
- Get us outta here! Help!
- We didn't hit him!

705
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,760
Come on. Let us out.
We was only joking.

706
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,398
- Hey, Long John!
Hey, get us outta here!
- Yeah!

707
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,311
- Hey-ey-ey, Polly.
- What?

708
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,676
- What was that song that just happened?
- What are you talkin' about?

709
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,832
You know.
<i>Cabin Fever</i>

710
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,912
- That.
- You see,John?

711
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,117
You gotta get us outta here now!
Clueless is startin' to go crackers!

712
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,071
Here you go.

713
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,789
- Your bread and water for today.
- But I ordered shrimp scampi.

714
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,668
It's more than you deserve,
ya villainous dogs!

715
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,352
Oh,Jim.

716
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,193
By rights,
I should be locked up too...

717
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,999
for lettin' thieves like them
aboard this ship.

718
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,230
Oh, it chills me...

719
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,118
to think that they almost
killed your little friends...

720
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,350
looking for some
daft treasure map.

721
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,752
None of this would've happened if I'd
have given Captain Smollet the--
I mean--

722
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,390
What, lad?

723
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,631
I'm not really sure I should be talking
about this with you or with anyone.

724
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,396
You mean, you've really
got a treasure map?

725
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,155
Not any more. Mr Arrow took it and
locked it up in the captain's cabin.

726
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,071
You must promise
to keep it a secret.

727
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,233
Don't bother your head about that.
You've only told old Long John.

728
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,595
Now, you run along
and do your chores. Go on.

729
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,557
Go on.

730
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,716
Safely now. Safely.

731
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,271
Steady as she goes.

732
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,839
Oh. Mr Silver, good evening.

733
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,195
Wicked fog tonight, sir.

734
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,431
Reminds me of the night
we ran aground off the pampas.

735
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,080
Half the crew drowned
in leaky lifeboats.

736
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,991
Ah, it were
a terrible shame.

737
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,231
- Leaky lifeboats?
- Oh, a common occurrence, sir.

738
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,312
A little-used piece of equipment
falls into disrepair...

739
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,359
- and becomes, shall we say--
- Unsafe?

740
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,035
Oh, I'm not sayin'
our lifeboats are unsafe, sir.

741
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,113
I'm not sayin'
we got problems--

742
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,633
Still--

743
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,709
Hmm. Hmm.

744
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,998
The caulking appears tight.
No dampness under the gunwale.

745
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,877
This one seems seaworthy.

746
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,272
Well, sir, they do, of course, until
you get them out in the open ocean.

747
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,189
- Cast me off, Mr Silver.
- Oh, yes, sir.

748
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,513
Oh, sir, is there anything I can
hold for you for safekeeping?

749
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,114
Your hat? Your coat?

750
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,590
- Your keys?
- Hmm? My keys?

751
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,674
Of course. If they were to fall
overboard, it would be disastrous.

752
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,558
Oh, that it would, sir.

753
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,638
Cast me off, Mr Silver!

754
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,199
Aye, aye, sir!

755
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,476
Thank you, Mr Silver.

756
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,915
Just doin' my duty, sir.

757
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,958
Oh, yes,John.

758
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,638
Man overboard!

759
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,070
Yes.

760
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,991
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Wha--

761
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,833
Mr Arrow's gone overboard,
and...

762
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,388
all we found was his hat!

763
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,198
Oh, no.

764
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,395
And so, my friends, the sea has claimed
another loyal officer and friend.

765
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,391
- This was a person who served--
- I got it! I got it!

766
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,391
Okay, after you, Monty.

767
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,119
- No, after you.
- Will you just come on.
- Okay.

768
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,668
Mr Samuel Arrow,
a wonderful man who...

769
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,718
used to get us up from our beds
before dawn for a good flossing.

770
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,434
- Okay, okay. Now, spread out
and find the map.
- Yeah.

771
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,071
May the wind be ever at your back,
Samuel Arrow. Rest in peace, my friend.

772
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,720
- Amen.
- Amen.

773
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,236
Shh.

774
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,189
- See? See?
- Wait. Open it. Open it.

775
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,875
No, no, no, we gotta take it
to Long John. Come on.

776
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,151
This apple has a worm in it.

777
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,357
That's not a worm.
That's my tail.

778
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,351
What's wrong?

779
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,149
- It just feels so weird.
- You mean, that Mr Arrow's dead?

780
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,916
Yeah, that, and my pants
are filled with starfish.

781
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,070
You and your hobbies!

782
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,355
Rizzo!

783
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,716
-Jim, we've missed you! Climb in!
- Can't. I'm doing my chores.

784
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,997
- Oh, come on. Share an apple.
- Yeah, come on!

785
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,752
- Anyway, here's the plan.
- I say we should kill that captain now.

786
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,389
- And then we'll get
that twit of a bear!
- Can we make a rug out of him?

787
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,391
Oh, hi, Long John.

788
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,349
I'm an easy man.
A gentlemen of fortune, says most.

789
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,637
But it makes me sick at heart
to sail with the likes of you.

790
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,070
Now, get this straight.

791
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,277
If anyone mutinies
before I says so...

792
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,433
I'll throw you overboard
like I did that scurvy mate Mr Arrow!

793
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,230
I says, let the captain
steer us closer to the island.

794
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,231
I've got the lad's
treasure map now.

795
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,550
When the time is ripe,
we'll kill 'em all!

796
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,599
- That's what I said!
- That's what I said!
- We're gonna kill them all!

797
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,070
- Land ho!
- Come on, lads! Let's go!

798
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,071
Yea! Land ho!

799
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,558
Oh, my goodness.

800
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,318
Land ho!

801
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,597
Beachfront property!

802
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,511
Retirement estates!

803
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,158
- Bikinis!
- Bikinis!

804
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,839
Throw the mainsail!
Drop anchor!

805
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,832
Bring her up
hard of starboard, helmsman.
Prepare to lower the longboats.

806
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,556
Bring those barrels
over here, lads!

807
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,791
Helmsman, give a hand
with the longboats.

808
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,189
- Captain, may I speak with you?
- I'm sort of busy right now,Jim.

809
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,875
But, Captain, we just heard.
Long John is planning a mutiny,
and he's got the treasure map.

810
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,951
- Yeah.
- I see.

811
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,634
- Mr Silver?
- Aye, aye, Cap'n!

812
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,995
Mr Silver, I want you
to take the crew ashore at once.

813
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,594
We need water and provisions.
Take as long as you want.

814
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,637
Sir! 'Tis a task to my liking, sir.
That it is!

815
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,110
- Quickly, boys. Gather the officers
and meet me in my quarters. Quickly.
- Yes, sir.

816
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,550
This is a lucky break.
Captain lettin' us go ashore.

817
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,517
Us with the map and all.

818
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,273
It's like giving the treasure to us
on a silver platter.

819
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:32,036
Aye, that it is, Polly.
Never trust a silver platter.

820
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,437
Follow me, Beakie. Come along.

821
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,229
Jim, lad!

822
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,154
There's room in the boat for one more.
Come along for an adventure.

823
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,516
- I-I can't. The captain wants me.
- Oh, what a shame!

824
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,955
I'll miss you, lad.
That I will.

825
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,636
Um,Jim! I seem to have
left my crutch on board.

826
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,790
Hand it to me like
a good lad, will ya?

827
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,399
There's a good boy.

828
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,998
Have to be a bit closer than that.
Can't reach it from there.

829
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,830
- Oh!
- Oh! Ah!

830
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,036
Cast away, men!
Be quick now!

831
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,270
Go, go, go!
Don't splash!

832
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,354
The plan is simple.

833
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,512
Once the pirates are ashore,
we set sail and return in a year or so.

834
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,672
- By then, all the fight
should be out of'em.
- Oh, now I understand.

835
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,988
That's a brilliant plan.

836
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,036
- Except for one thing.
- What's that?

837
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,680
The pirates have Jim!

838
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,594
I'm tired!

839
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,272
- You're what?
- I'm gettin' tired!

840
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,830
- He says go faster.
- I'm gettin' tired!

841
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,353
Hey, man! I can't figure out
what side we're on.

842
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,079
Are we with the pirates
or the frog captain?

843
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,151
Oh, hey, man,
just play the gig.

844
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,356
Never get involved in politics.

845
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,715
Politics!
Politics!

846
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,033
Jim, lad!

847
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,513
Easy,Jim.
'Tis all in good fun.

848
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,230
Pleased I am to initiate you
into our enterprising, um, company.

849
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,675
Which entitles you
to all the benefits thereof.

850
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,232
- But I don't want any benefits.
- This is a one-time
special offer,Jim, lad.

851
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,950
Say no, and I will be forced
to, um, terminate our relationship.

852
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,268
- You're nothing but murdering pirates.
- Pirates!

853
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,314
Pirates. Oh,Jim.

854
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,630
If that's what
you're thinking...

855
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,392
you're dead wrong.

856
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,077
<i>When I was just a lad</i>

857
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,594
<i>Looking for my true vocation</i>

858
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,875
<i>My father said</i>
<i>Now, son, this choice</i>

859
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,315
<i>Deserves deliberation</i>

860
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,470
<i>Though you could be a doctor</i>

861
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,949
<i>Or perhaps a financier</i>

862
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,352
<i>My boy, why not consider</i>
<i>a more challenging career</i>

863
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,793
<i>Hey, ho, ho</i>

864
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,235
- <i>You'll cruise to foreign shores</i>
- Sing it, lads!

865
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,915
<i>-And you'll keep your mind and body</i>
<i>sound by working out of doors</i>
- Show him you been practisin'!

866
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,549
<i>True friendship and adventure</i>
<i>are what we can't live without</i>

867
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:53,078
<i>-And when you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>
<i>- That's what thejob's about</i>

868
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,950
Upstage, lads!
This is my only number.

869
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,431
<i>Now take Sir Francis Drake</i>
<i>The Spanish all despise him</i>

870
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,310
<i>But to the British he's a hero</i>
<i>and they idolize him</i>

871
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,595
<i>It's how you look at buccaneers</i>

872
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,591
<i>That makes them bad or good</i>

873
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,514
<i>And I see us as members</i>
<i>of a noble brotherhood</i>

874
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,352
- Hup!
- <i>Hey, ho, ho</i>

875
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,159
- Oh, I love it!
- <i>We're honourable men</i>
- 'Tis poetry in motion.

876
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,550
<i>And before we lose our tempers</i>
<i>we will always count to ten</i>

877
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,394
<i>On occasion there may be</i>
<i>someone you have to execute</i>

878
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,393
<i>But when you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

879
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,471
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to wear a suit</i>

880
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,436
- What?
<i>- I could have been a surgeon</i>
<i>I like taking things apart</i>

881
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,433
<i>I could have been a lawyer</i>
<i>but I just had too much heart</i>

882
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,318
<i>I could have been in politics</i>

883
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,439
<i>'Cause I've always been</i>
<i>a big spender</i>

884
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,559
<i>And me, I could have been</i>
<i>a contender</i>

885
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,635
<i>Some say that pirates steal</i>

886
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,280
<i>And should be feared and hated</i>

887
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,669
<i>I say we're victims</i>
<i>of bad press</i>

888
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,910
<i>It's all exaggerated</i>

889
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,355
<i>We'd never stab you</i>
<i>in the back</i>

890
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,556
<i>We'd never lie or cheat</i>

891
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,790
<i>We'rejust about the nicest guys</i>

892
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,110
<i>You'd ever want to meet</i>

893
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,156
Well, look at us,Jim.

894
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,959
We're a festival
of conviviality.

895
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,916
Congeniality.

896
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,913
- That's conviviality, stupid.
- That's what I said.

897
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,558
We're ready, O <i>capitn</i>.

898
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,519
Good. You men guard the ship
while I'm gone. We'll be back
as soon as we get Jim.

899
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,716
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Cast off, Mr Beaker.

900
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,309
Thanks for coming along, men.

901
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,472
- Are you kidding? Jim is family.
- Yeah.

902
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,636
Tell the truth, lad.

903
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,950
Do you really think the captain
and the squire...

904
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,713
are planning to share the treasure
with the likes of us?

905
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,758
Can't hear ya.

906
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,558
No?

907
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,949
And we being
the rightful owners.

908
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,670
Flint's own crew, who shed
our blood getting it here!

909
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,718
Join us, lad.

910
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,349
Donate your compass to the
treasure hunt and get a full share!

911
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,115
<i>Hey, ho, ho</i>
<i>It's one for all for one</i>

912
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,395
<i>And we'll share</i>
<i>and share alike with you</i>

913
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,277
<i>And love you like a son</i>

914
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,875
<i>We're gentlemen of fortune</i>
<i>and that's what we're proud to be</i>

915
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,270
<i>And when you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

916
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,794
<i>You'll be honest</i>
<i>brave and free</i>

917
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,677
<i>The soul of decency</i>

918
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,671
<i>You'll be loyal and fair</i>
<i>and on the square</i>

919
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,716
<i>And most importantly</i>

920
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,190
<i>When you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

921
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,999
<i>You're always in the best</i>

922
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:48,598
<i>Of company</i>

923
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,833
- Down!
- There! Captain Smollett
coming to rescue me.

924
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,831
Don't get your hopes up, laddie.

925
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,708
I've taken the liberty of hiding
a few of my best men aboard.

926
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,597
If a second round follows...

927
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,035
it means they've
taken over the <i>Hispaniola</i>...

928
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,509
and I'm the new cap'n.

929
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,996
Now, then.

930
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,991
Yea!

931
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,238
How infortuitous our firearms
weren't loaded, Beakie.

932
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,357
I'll say.
We might have shot somebody.

933
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,795
I'm the only friend
you got in the world now,Jim.

934
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,230
Let's dig up
the treasure together, eh?

935
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,834
Shipmates, remember?

936
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:49,271
- We'll be needing your compass, though.
- No.

937
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,430
I'll be taking it
either way,Jim.

938
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,553
Yea!

939
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,791
Come on then, lad.
Let's not waste time.

940
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,989
Well, it's too dark
to do anything now.

941
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,878
We'll camp here
and wait for first light.

942
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,430
Oh. Hey, Rizzo, relax!
Don't be so afraid.

943
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,829
Oh, I've gone
way beyond afraid.

944
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,117
Right now I'm somewhere between
bed-wetting and a near-death experience.

945
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,074
- Good night, boys.
- Well, good night.
- Right.

946
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,355
- 'Night, Rizzo.
- Yeah, sure.

947
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,236
Gonzo?
Is that you, Gonzo?

948
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,353
Boy, Gonzo, it sounds like you're
coming down with a little cold there.

949
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,952
I-I-I'm just gonna light a match,
if you don't mind, here.

950
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,713
Long John, look!

951
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,788
Flint hung 'em up there
after he gullied 'em...

952
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,871
to mark the trail
to the treasure.

953
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,514
Wicked sense of humour
ol' Flinty had.

954
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,239
- I-It's a sign. This is a cursed place.
- Yeah!

955
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,232
Well, there's
an informed opinion.

956
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,839
All right,Jim, lad,
where to from here?

957
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,150
''On a heading
of 1 7 9 degrees...

958
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,596
walk 31 2 paces
from where the dead men hang high.''

959
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,715
That way!

960
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,109
- We're gonna go? We're gonna--
- Come on!

961
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,751

967
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:56,308
- Are we lucky or what?
- Silence, smelly sailor mans!

968
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,311

Bring forth
Boom Sha-Kal-a-Kal.

974
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,033

What if Clueless is right?
Wh-What if it is c-cursed?

1037
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,593
I'll show you what
I think of your curse.

You mewling, little,
lily-livered...

1039
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,953
toffee-hearted,
little wuss of a crustacean!

1040
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,398
''Treasure buried here.''

1041
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,233
Oi, we don't even
have to dig it up!

1042
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,880
Come on, mates!
The treasure's ours!

1043
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,512
There's no treasure, Silver!
You brought us here for nothin'!

1044
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,716
- Yeah!
- And now we'll be tried for mutiny!

1045
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,233
- That's right!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1046
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,871
I say we should kill him!

1047
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,000
Run, lad!
Save yourself!

1048
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,913
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because I like you, boy.

1049
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,956
I hope you didn't think
I was lying about that.

1050
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,235
- Get him!
- Run!
- Get him!

1051
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,639
Take greeny, flippy,
bulgy-eyed one away.

1052
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,154
- What?
- Others stay. Chop-chop!

1053
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,074
- What? Oh. Ah. Oh. Uh.
- Hey, wait! Where are you taking him?

1054
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,720
<i>Hmm ver-di-dee-voom</i>

then skewer the mousie!

1058
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,269
- Well, how else do you think
we were gonna get him in this movie?
- Yeah.

1059
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,918
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1060
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,438
- Oh. I wish we were back at the
Admiral Benbow eating table scraps.
- We're about to become table scraps.

1061
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:48,229
Well, this is terrible! This is the
worst thing that's ever happened to me!

1062
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,357
- Wait a second! I've been cut loose!
- Hiya, guys.

1063
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,313
-Jim, they've got Captain Smollett.
- I know. Come on.
We've got to get help.

1064
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,152
Oh, okay.
Where will we go?

1065
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,876
Tom, Tom, Tom!
Ohhh!

1066
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,431
Dead Tom's dead!

1067
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,831
Long John shot him!

1068
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,155
But Dead Tom's
always been dead.

1069
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,118
That's why he's
called Dead Tom.

1070
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,113
- Oh.
- Can we get on with this?
Get outta here, will ya?

1071
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,679
- Clueless!
- Yeah, yeah?

1072
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,115
- Give it to him!
- Yeah!

1073
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,158
But, uh, it's not
even his birthday.

1074
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,515
- No, no, no, no! The paper!
- Oh.

1075
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,274
This is for you.

1076
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,554
- The Black Spot?
- Yeah.

1077
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,757
You dare to give me
the Black Spot?

1078
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,638
- Uh, he-he told me to.
- Wh-- Shut up, will ya?

1079
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,156
And it's drawn
on a page from the Bible.

1080
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,710
You tore a page
from the Holy Scriptures...

1081
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,394
- to make a pirate's death sentence?
- Uh, here.

1082
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,508
Ohhh, the red hot
gates of hell...

1083
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,318
are creeping open!

1084
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,837
Satan is heating
his pokers for you...

1085
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,990
you blasphemous heathens!

1086
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:18,230
- Fall down on your knees...
- Oh!

1087
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:22,313
and beg for deliverance
from damnation!

1088
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,868
- Please forgive us.
- Please forgive me!

1089
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,200
Very good.
You're forgiven.

1090
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,874
- Oh, thank you.
- Now untie me!

1091
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,996
Okay, okay. Untie him.

1092
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,629
- And let's go find the treasure!
- Yeah!

1093
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,950
Oh, oh, you are a good man.

1094
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,679
You are a kind man.
A handsome man.

1095
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,513
- Precious.
- Oh, he's-- You're precious a-and--

1096
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,909
- Beautiful.
- And he's beautiful. Oh.

1097
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:58,830
Yeah, here's the boat.
Oh, no!

1098
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,356
Well, that won't help us.
We're gonna have to swim to the ship.

1099
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,635
Hello! Earth to Jimbo.

1100
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:10,397
Swimming to a ship that's full of
killer pirates to save the captain
is not a good plan.

1101
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,632
- Look!
- Yes. The gunwale and keel
are definitely safe.

1102
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,594
- Mr Arrow!
- Mr Arrow!
- It's me!Jim!

1103
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,591
- Over here!
- Mr Arrow, over here!

1104
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,399
Oh. Oh, boys.
Come join me...

1105
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,711
aboard this exceptionally
safe little boat.

1106
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,711
Hmm.

1107
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,792
By the way, that Silver fellow
may not be trustworthy.

1108
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,633
- Ha-ha! Now he tells us!
- Yeah.

1109
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,917
And here's a photo opportunity
you will not want to miss.

1110
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,913
The actual jungle location for the movie
<i>Muppet Treasure Island</i>.

1111
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,831
- Oh, my goodness!
- Keep up, people.

1112
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,751
- Hey, when do we eat?
- Oh, my feet are killing me.

1113
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,798
Of all the backwater,
no-class piles of sand in the ocean...

1114
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,553
you had to wash up on mine.

1115
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,598
Benjamina, I just want you
to know that I'm sorry.

1116
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,989
Sorry? No, no,
sorry doesn't cut it.

1117
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,514
You left me standing
at the altar!

1118
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,473
I was on a ship headed
for Zanzibar. I got cold feet.

1119
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,438
You're a frog.
You're supposed to have cold feet.

1120
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,750
My mother came
all the way from France.

1121
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,593
I was wearing
her white lace dress.

1122
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,672
The cake was filled
with lemon custard!

1123
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,274
Mina, fate has brought us
together again.

1124
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,192
Well, actually, buried treasure
and pirates brought us together--

1125
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,271
Don't you start with me
about pirates!

1126
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,033
After you jilted me, I took
up with this Bernie Flint.

1127
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,317
- The man was totally codependent.
- You and Captain Flint?

1128
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,235
Well, he was a pirate, I was a lady.
You know the story.

1129
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,788
Smolly? He marooned me.

1130
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,472
Me!

1131
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,197
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1132
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,431
Th-This is all my fault.
Oh, what have I done to you?

1133
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,559
- Mushy-mushy!
- Kissy-kissy!
- Oh, lovey-dovey!

1134
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,272
Bravo, Cap'n.

1135
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,398
Touchin' reunion, Benjamina.

1136
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,790
This seems to be your day
for renewing old...

1137
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,194
acquaintances.

1138
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,754
Oh, well, hello, Long John.

1139
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,832
- Oh, no! Him too?
- Well, if you'd married me.

1140
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,672
Well, what does that
have to do with it?

1141
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,070
- I'm a pig! I need commitment!
- Commitment?
- You knew that about me when you--

1142
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:32,517
Now, I'm not gonna be really patient
about this, Benjamina.

1143
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,670
Where is the treasure?

1144
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,359
Um, I just may not
tell you. Hmm.

1145
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,156
Oh, don't play games with me, lass.

1146
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,190
I tell you,
I'm not a patient man.

1147
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,390
Stop! Give up now...

1148
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,835
weak and tiny pirate mans...

1149
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,718
or die like stinking dogs.

1150
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,990
Hmm, we see you have
boom-boom sticks.

1151
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,033
Bye-bye.

1152
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,396
Oh, brother!

1153
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,710
- Now, Benjamina.
- What?

1154
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,394
Where is the treasure?

1155
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:24,234
There is no treasure.
I-It was all a clever ruse. H-Ha!

1156
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,199
So where did you get that
gold necklace you're wearing?

1157
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,033
The one made
of Spanish doubloons.

1158
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,599
Aye.

1159
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,910
Um...

1160
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,274
Shopping Channel?

1161
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,109
No!

1162
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,952
Shh.

1163
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,031
- Shh.
- Shh.

1164
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,113
Oh, fiddle!

1165
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,556
Make yourself useful.
Try and save us. Do something!

1166
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,471
Shh!

1167
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,710
Oh, Master Hawkins,
you've come to rescue us.

1168
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,711
I should've let him
live in my finger.

1169
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,878
We're ready,
Master Hawkins.

1170
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,076
- Do you think this
will work, Dr Livesey?
- Oh, yes!

1171
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,550
My research indicates
that pirates are very superstitious.

1172
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,715
Boogie, boogie, boogie!

1173
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,349
I am the ghost
of Samuel Arrow.

1174
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,310
Boogie!

1175
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,117
Come on.
We've got to save the captain!

1176
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,430
You were so good, Mr Arrow.
That was beautiful.

1177
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,159
What do we do next?
What do we do now? Uh,Jim?

1178
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,040
- Weigh anchor?
- Weigh anchor.
- Weigh anchor. Okay.

1179
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,192
- Set the sails.
- Set the sails!

1180
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,478
- And you, Squire Trelawney.
- Uh, n-n-now, Master Hawkins, I-I-I--

1181
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,233
You take the helm.

1182
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:15,189
Ah! Step aside, Mr Bimbo.
I shall be taking the helm.

1183
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,918
Hurry, Rizzo!

1184
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,952
I'm going as fast as I can.

1185
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,078
Oh! Smolly, my love!

1186
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,513
Oh, oh!

1187
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,839
Smolly!

1188
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,635
You can't hurt my frog!

1189
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,029
Don't tell him anything, Mina.
I beg you!

1190
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,237
He'll only kill you too.
Don't listen to him!

1191
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,878
Now...

1192
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,076
for the last time...

1193
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,435
where's the blasted treasure?

1194
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,956
- Yeah!
- Hah!

1195
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,635
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
The treasure's at my place.

1196
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,553
North trail, split-level hut
with the pink lawn furniture.
You can't miss it.

1197
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,359
Now free him at once,
you scoundrel!

1198
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,637
You know, I'm beginning to see
a pattern in the men I date.

1199
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,951
Yeah, well, uh, uh,
the past is behind us.

1200
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,838
And the future below us.

1201
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,998
Oh, it's okay, Mina.
We're together again.

1202
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,719
Yes, despite it all...

1203
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,268
we have each other.

1204
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,118
- Oh, don't cry for me, Benjamina.
- Pardon?

1205
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:34,069
<i>Was I dumb</i>
<i>or was I blind</i>

1206
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:38,073
<i>Or did my heart</i>
<i>just lose its mind</i>

1207
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,913
<i>Why'd I go and throw</i>

1208
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,437
<i>Our perfect dream away</i>

1209
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:51,670
<i>Looking back</i>
<i>I'll never know</i>

1210
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,435
<i>How I ever let you go</i>

1211
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,877
<i>But destiny could see</i>
<i>we deserved</i>

1212
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,236
<i>To have another day</i>

1213
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,911
<i>Love led us here</i>

1214
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,029
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

1215
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:17,272
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1216
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,114
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1217
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,756
<i>Love led us here</i>

1218
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,196
<i>Now I know that life</i>

1219
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,556
<i>Can take you by surprise</i>

1220
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,349
<i>And sweep you off your feet</i>

1221
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,438
<i>Did this happen to us</i>

1222
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:45,514
<i>Or are wejust dreaming</i>

1223
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,319
<i>Love led us here</i>

1224
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,749
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

1225
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:58,628
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1226
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:03,840
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1227
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,708
<i>Love led us here</i>

1228
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,235
<i>So take my hand</i>

1229
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:17,399
<i>And have no fear</i>

1230
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:21,837
<i>We'll be all right</i>

1231
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,276
<i>Love led us</i>

1232
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:30,150
<i>Here</i>

1233
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,996
Oh, Smolly.
You saved me.

1234
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,396
Come on, men!
It's back to Blighty now, lads!

1235
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,516
The treasure's all ours!

1236
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,915
Hurry. Come on.
Get in the boat.

1237
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,231
Long John! Long John!
Look! The ship!

1238
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,878
Uh, yeah--
What are they doing?

1239
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,076
There's no one on board.

1240
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,309
It's coming
straight for us!

1241
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,709
I-It's the ghost
of Captain Flinty.

1242
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,950
He's coming to kill us.

1243
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,189
Come back, you cowards!

1244
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,391
Hawkins.

1245
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,916
Look. It's the captain
and the pig.

1246
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,393
Oh, no!

1247
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,478
Head for those cliffs.

1248
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:50,711
- Head for the cliffs, Squire.
- Aye, aye! Uh. Oh.

1249
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,870
Oh, Beakie, Beakie.
Look, look!

1250
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,713
I think we're going to need a net.
Come along.

1251
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:03,075
Get back there,
you yellow-bellied bilge rats!

1252
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,994
I'm not losing
that treasure now! Get out!

1253
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,071
We're lowering the net now.

1254
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,959
All right, let's go. Okay.
That's it. Beautiful. Beautiful.

1255
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:18,478
- We're coming, Captain Smollett!
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1256
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,198
- Steady! Steady!
- Careful!

1257
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,632
<i>Au revoir, mon capitaine</i>.

1258
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,155
- We got 'em!
- Oh, ho, ho! Yes!

1259
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,268
- Ahh!
- Oh, no!

1260
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,076
Waldorf, you old fool!
We're heroes!

1261
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:43,277
We saved the pig
and the frog!

1262
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,113
Well, it was too late
to save the movie.

1263
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,559
Welcome aboard,
Captain Smollett.

1264
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,200
And welcome
to your lady pig friend.

1265
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,554
Ah! Look out! Ah!

1266
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,276
The captain must have his sword.

1267
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,713
Whoa!

1268
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,109
Wow! Ha!

1269
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,839
Yah!

1270
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,115
Captain!

1271
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,555
Fight, you idiots!

1272
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,397
Captain!

1273
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,438
- Here!
- Ha! Ah!
- Hi-ya!

1274
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,399
- Wah!
- All right! No more Ms Nice Guy!

1275
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,430
No one maroons me
and gets away with it!

1276
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,157
- Good to see you alive, Mr Arrow.
- Huh! Thank you, Captain.

1277
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,800
Geronimo!

1278
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,791
Oh, what am I gonna do? Oh!

1279
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,838
- Come on!
- Come on, you! Hey!
- Oh!

1280
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,276
- Oh, sorry.
- <i>En garde!</i>

1281
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,273
- <i>Mi casa es su casa</i>.
- Ah, I make cheese
out of you. Come on!

1282
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,273
- Hi-yee, De Soto! Hi-ya!
- Oh, yah!

1283
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,271
<i>!!Cucaracha!</i>

1284
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,879
- Hah!
- Ahhh!

1285
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,791
Come on,Jerry!
He's just a kid!

1286
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,271
- Ohhh!
- Okay, okay, okay!

1287
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,716
Okay, I give.
Uncle. Uh, I'm dead.

1288
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,596
Oh, oh, oh, Mr Bimbo, help!

1289
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,795
- Am I dead?
- Huh?

1290
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,954
- Wonderful!
- Uh--

1291
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:00,717
- Mr Bimbo, that was
some amazing swordplay.
- Take that!

1292
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,871
Oh, watch out, Mr Arrow!

1293
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:12,150
Well, thank you. But aren't you
supposed to be fighting against us?

1294
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,629
Are you kiddin'?
I love you guys!

1295
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,154
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

1296
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,556
Cowabunga!

1297
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,236
Come on. Fight.
Where are you?

1298
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,356
- Ohhh!
- Hmm.

1299
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,355
And as for you!

1300
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,350
- Oh!
- Silver!

1301
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,710
Hmm-hmm. Hah!

1302
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,917
Hah! Hah!

1303
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,352
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size, huh?

1304
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,993
- Ah. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Wow!

1305
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,640
Yes! Yes! Smolly! Yes!

1306
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,555
- Hah!
- Yes!

1307
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,471
Ha-ha, Silver!

1308
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,114
Ha-ha, ho-ho!
Not bad for an amphibian.

1309
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:24,432
Smolly, Smolly, he's our man!
If he can't do it, no one can! Yea!

1310
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,115
- Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha!
- Excuse me.
- Pardon? Whoop.

1311
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,672
Ohhh!

1312
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,435
Uh-- Uh-- Uh--

1313
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,440
I'm a frog.
You know, slippery hands.

1314
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,718
Uh, you know, I never really believed
that violence solved anything anyway.

1315
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,917
Really? Allow me
to disagree, Cap'n.

1316
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,109
Kill Captain Smollett,
and you'll have to kill me.

1317
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,191
Kill Jim,
and you'll have to kill me.

1318
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,077
Kill Gonzo,
and you'll have to kill me.

1319
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,230
Kill Squire Trelawney
and Mr Bimbo...

1320
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,710
and you'll have to
negotiate strenuously.

1321
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,552
Going somewhere,
John-John?

1322
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:19,113
Well, Mr Hawkins,
it seems your little family...

1323
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,555
has come together
against me.

1324
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,231
- We're doomed.
- Yeah.

1325
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,029
Well, you know, I, for one,
feel better about myself.

1326
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,874
Yeah. A-And I believe
that I have learned a valuable lesson.

1327
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,997
- Why, you!
- Shut up!

1328
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:56,035
Okay, stop biting me.
Okay, I said something wrong!

1329
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,193
Silver!

1330
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:29,193
I suppose you'll be blowing
the whistle on me now, won't you,Jim?

1331
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,716
I suppose I will. You have to return
to Bristol to stand trial.

1332
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,156
Oh, I'm sorry,Jim.
I got a terrible fear of hanging.

1333
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,191
We're shipmates, aren't we,Jim?

1334
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,351
Gentlemen of fortune, together.

1335
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,033
Give us one more chance?

1336
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,874
Oh, hell,Jim.
I could never harm you.

1337
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,035
You're honest
and brave and true.

1338
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:18,153
- You didn't learn that from me.
- I learnt it from my friends,
Mr Silver.

1339
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,119
Now take your oars and row away.
I never want to see you again, ever.

1340
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,711
Oh,Jim!

1341
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,950
'Tis a shame, really.
We'd have made
a great team,Jim.

1342
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,910
Well done,Jim.
Your father would be proud.

1343
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,998
Captain Smollett,
I have most distressing news.

1344
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:14,437
One of the jolly boats is missing,
and I know for a fact
that it was terribly unsafe.

1345
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,670
Ahhh!

1346
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,433
This is not fun.

1347
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,112
Flaubert, meet Da-Da.

1348
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,873
- Ready to sail, sir.
- Hmm.

1349
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,520
Where to,
Captain Hawkins?

1350
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,511
To wherever the wind
may take us.

1351
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,239
Off to Zanzibar,
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.

1352
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,312
Oh, brother.
Here they go again.

1353
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,231
<i>Love power</i>

1354
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,878
<i>Love power</i>

1355
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,520
<i>Love power</i>

1356
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,558
<i>A little love power</i>

1357
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:47,313
<i>Stronger than the hurricane</i>

1358
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,789
<i>And softer than</i>
<i>the summer rain</i>

1359
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:54,473
- <i>Love power</i>
- <i>What kind of power</i>

1360
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,391
<i>A little love power</i>

1361
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:00,075
<i>It can lift you up</i>
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

1362
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,118
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

1363
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,111
<i>Whoa-oh</i>

1364
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:08,033
<i>There ain't no sun</i>
<i>in the morning sky</i>

1365
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:11,271
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1366
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,477
<i>Breeze ain't blowing</i>
<i>and the bird don't fly</i>

1367
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,757
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1368
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,877
<i>Then someone kind</i>
<i>reaches out a hand</i>

1369
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,997
<i>And smiles</i>
<i>a warm sweet smile</i>

1370
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,277
<i>And then your heart</i>
<i>come to understand</i>

1371
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,432
<i>What make the world spin</i>
<i>Where do magic begin</i>

1372
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,033
<i>Someone to believe in</i>

1373
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:34,839
<i>Feel so good</i>
<i>when everybody feels</i>

1374
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,673
- <i>Love power</i>
- <i>There's no higher power</i>

1375
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,399
- <i>A little love power</i>
- <i>Nothing in the world</i>

1376
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,153
<i>Stronger than the hurricane</i>

1377
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:46,357
<i>And softer</i>
<i>than the summer rain</i>

1378
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,874
<i>Oh, love power</i>

1379
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,077
- <i>Everybody, feel it</i>
- <i>A little love power</i>

1380
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,388
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1381
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,948
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

1382
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,793
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

1383
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,757
<i>Whoa-oh</i>

1384
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,196
<i>So many people</i>
<i>they feel so bad</i>

1385
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,635
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1386
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:10,599
<i>Yeah, they make the money</i>
<i>but they still so sad</i>

1387
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,478
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1388
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:16,757
<i>Nobody told them</i>
<i>that it ain't that stuff</i>

1389
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:20,071
<i>That makes life worthwhile</i>

1390
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,118
<i>'Cause even if</i>
<i>you've got enough</i>

1391
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,317
<i>You got less than nothing</i>
<i>till you know for certain</i>

1392
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,277
<i>Enough to put your faith in</i>

1393
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,794
<i>It feels so good</i>
<i>when everybody feels</i>

1394
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,678
- <i>Love power</i>
- <i>People, can you feel it</i>

1395
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,149
<i>A little love power</i>

1396
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,118
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

1397
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,430
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

1398
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,876
<i>Let me tell you now</i>

1399
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,236
- <i>Whoa-oh</i>
- <i>Feel the inspiration</i>

1400
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,880
- <i>Hey</i>
- <i>Don't it feel like heaven</i>

1401
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,520
<i>It make the soul</i>
<i>and the spirit strong</i>

1402
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,558
<i>When everybody come</i>
<i>and every single one</i>

1403
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,949
<i>They hear the song now</i>

1404
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,077
<i>Oh, love power</i>

1405
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,720
<i>A little love power</i>

1406
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,792
<i>Stronger than the hurricane</i>

1407
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,394
<i>And softer</i>
<i>than the summer rain</i>

1408
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,836
- <i>Can you feel it, oh</i>
- <i>Love power</i>

1409
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,639
- <i>What kind of power</i>
- <i>A little love power</i>

1410
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:17,948
<i>It can lift you up</i>

1411
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:20,713
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

1412
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,473
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

1413
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:27,030
<i>- One love</i>
<i>- Lift you up when you get low</i>

1414
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,031
<i>-And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>
- So,Johnny.

1415
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,715
May I call you Johnny?
Stop me if you heard this one.

1416
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,395
Why does the ocean roar?

1417
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,311
Give up?

1418
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,915
You would, too, if you had
crabs on your bottom...

1419
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,468
and oysters in your bed.

1420
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,075
Get it? Oysters? Bed?

1421
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,310
Ooh, I love that one.

1422
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,075
I'm tellin' ya, I got
a million more just like that.

1423
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,111
<i>Was I dumb</i>

1424
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,839
<i>Or was I blind</i>

1425
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,833
<i>Or did my heart</i>
<i>just lose its mind</i>

1426
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,434
<i>Why'd I go and throw</i>

1427
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:25,514
<i>Our perfect dream away</i>

1428
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,398
<i>Oh, looking back</i>

1429
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,438
<i>I'll never know</i>

1430
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,274
<i>How I ever let you go</i>

1431
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:39,592
<i>But destiny could see</i>
<i>we deserve</i>

1432
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:43,355
<i>To have another day</i>

1433
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,268
<i>Love led us here</i>

1434
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:52,909
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

1435
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,039
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1436
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:00,795
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1437
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,160
<i>Love led us here</i>

1438
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,713
<i>Love led us here</i>

1439
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,031
<i>Ooh</i>

1440
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,951
<i>I confess</i>

1441
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,871
<i>It's sad but true</i>

1442
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:21,511
- <i>Sad but true</i>
- <i>I lost myself when I lost you</i>

1443
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,717
<i>But I held your memory</i>

1444
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:30,033
<i>Through each lonely night</i>

1445
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,395
<i>Oh, let's forget</i>

1446
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,278
- <i>What's gone before</i>
- <i>What's gone</i>

1447
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,194
- <i>Now we both</i>
<i>know so much more</i>
- <i>So much more</i>

1448
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,353
<i>And we've been given</i>
<i>another chance</i>

1449
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,637
<i>To make it work out right</i>

1450
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,711
<i>Make it work</i>

1451
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,870
<i>Love led us here</i>

1452
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,555
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

1453
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:00,872
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1454
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,839
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1455
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,953
<i>Love led us here</i>

1456
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:16,398
<i>Now I know that life</i>
<i>can take you by surprise</i>

1457
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:21,031
<i>And sweep you off your feet</i>

1458
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:24,237
<i>Did this happen to us</i>

1459
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,790
<i>Or are we just dreamin'</i>

1460
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:32,510
<i>Dreamin'</i>

1461
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,679
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1462
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,719
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1463
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,709
<i>Love led us here</i>

1464
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,909
<i>So take my hand</i>

1465
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,028
<i>And have no fear</i>

1466
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,908
<i>We'll be all right</i>

1467
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,117
<i>Love led us</i>

1468
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:16,038
<i>Here</i>
