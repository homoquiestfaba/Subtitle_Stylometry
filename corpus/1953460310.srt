2
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,405
- Thanks for your help
- You're good.

3
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,212
Make sure you tell the detectives
that I'm willing to testify

4
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,950
and I definitely want to press charges.

5
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,995
Look, I don't know what happened.
It went really fast.

6
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,758
Are they gonna live?

7
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,980
Hey, lonely guy.

8
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,922
Sorry. I'm meeting someone.

9
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,318
Yeah, me too. Nikki Franklyn.

10
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,892
You too? Really?

11
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,493
ls that surprising?

12
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,560
Yeah, kind of.

13
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,963
-I'm Zachary.
-Of course.

14
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,228
Zachary Newman. Figured.

15
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,773
You're the high school guy,
her first true love.

16
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,740
I've heard a lot about you.

17
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,911
Yeah. I guess. That was us.

18
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,572
She broke up with you
at the Waffle Shack after prom.

19
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,553
<i>Cried so hard you puked all over her shoes.</i>

20
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,556
Blueberry pancakes.
Yeah. Not my finest hour.

21
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,694
I'm Miranda.

22
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,287
-May I?
-Yeah.

23
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,229
Have a seat.

24
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,796
It's typical Nikki. Late. She said 8:00.

25
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,464
I got a call from Nikki.

26
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,303
It's the first time
I had heard from her in a decade.

27
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,775
She said she's in town
and wants to meet up.

28
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,143
I guess I'm not the only one
she wanted to catch up with.

29
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,011
We stayed in touch, you know,
after the pancake incident.

30
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,518
She said she wanted to go
on a trek to find herself.

31
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,144
Timbuktu, I think.

32
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,588
-Kathmandu.
-Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

33
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,151
That's the last time we spoke.

34
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,886
Where did you two meet?

35
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,194
Narcotics Anonymous.

36
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:31,466
What, you and Nikki, like,
smoked a ton of pot together?

37
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,314
-Cocaine?
-Heroin.

38
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,777
Nikki and heroin.

39
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,013
Yeah.

40
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,678
-With needles?
-Yep.

41
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,216
I just can't imagine her doing that.

42
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:51,094
I mean, maybe smoking it, I guess, but...

43
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,560
She always was so adventurous.

44
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,999
When we met she was a mess,
close to death and so was I.

45
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,260
We saved each other.

46
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,641
<i>We were Io vers.</i>

47
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,373
Does that shock you?

48
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,351
No, you're very beautiful.

49
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,585
I just... I'm still reeling
over the whole heroin thing.

50
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,199
-Should we get a table?
-Sure.

51
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,269
Hi, guys. I'm Abby.
I'm gonna be your server.

52
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,939
So just let me know if you need
any other drinks or anything.

53
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,741
Absinthe.

54
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,007
Okay.

55
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,950
Isn't that highly alcoholic?

56
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,749
I'm ajunkie, not a drunk.

57
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,317
Can I have another martini,
five blue cheese olives?

58
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,816
Okay.

59
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,294
ls that a drink or a salad?

60
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,691
It's both.

61
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,895
I raced over here from work.
I forgot to eat all day.

62
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,528
You know it's not healthy to work that hard.

63
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,038
I know.

64
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,968
I know.

65
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,567
-What do you do?
-Sales.

66
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,408
-Do you like it?
-I hate it, really.

67
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,709
-Do you have kids?
-No.

68
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,546
-Married?
-Nope.

69
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,415
So, why the fuck don't you quit?

70
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,081
-And do what?
-Whatever floats your boat.

71
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,587
I'm not sure what that is.

72
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,820
Well, clearly,
there's your problem right there.

73
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,419
Gosh, talking to you
really reminds me of talking to Nikki

74
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,487
just right to the big, heavy stuff,

75
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,260
no kidding around.

76
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,795
-What?
-No, nothing.

77
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,603
You're kind of cute eating your salad.

78
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,069
See, this is why I never go to bars.

79
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,806
The only girls who think
I'm cute are lesbian.

80
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,710
Or lesbians?

81
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,477
I don't know...
What's the plural of that word?

82
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,449
I'm bi.

83
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,317
Great. I feel half better.

84
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,781
So, when did you last see Nikki?

85
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,417
I will fucking kill you!

86
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,292
Six years ago.

87
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,765
-ls that when you broke up?
-Yeah.

88
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,359
But then after awhile,
we started talking again.

89
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:15,600
Just a phone call or two every few months.

90
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,633
And then one day,
I get a collect call from Nikki from jail.

91
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,804
-Jail?
-Well, not exactly.

92
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,712
It was a mental hospital
for the criminally insane.

93
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,340
<i>What was she doing there?</i>

94
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,350
Murder?

95
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,512
<i>Nikki killed somebody?</i>

96
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,056
It was her boyfriend.

97
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,092
She poisoned him with arsenic.

98
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,495
Said she got off by reason of insanity.

99
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,366
Arsenic?

100
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,503
Look, Nikki's a lot of crazy things,

101
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,061
but she's not literally crazy.

102
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,334
At least not how I remember her.

103
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,472
But don't you think
she'd be great at acting crazy?

104
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,709
Yeah. Yes.

105
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,582
I used to call her my sexy evil genius.

106
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,919
And she was, a genius.
Test scores off the charts.

107
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,681
Thanks.

108
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,533
Thanks.

109
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,435
Nikki said she'd call me
when she got released from the hospital.

110
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,368
I didn't realize it would
only be three years later.

111
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,296
This is bizarre.

112
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,535
I mean, not just hearing
her post-me life story,

113
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,409
but you and me here now and her so late?

114
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,942
-It's deliberate.
-What do you mean?

115
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,778
Nikki's never on time for anything.

116
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,046
No, I mean I think that
she wanted us to meet

117
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,181
before she got here, to get acquainted.

118
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,485
You and me?

119
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,049
Why?

120
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,562
So you can blow my mind
with the ripping yarn of her life story?

121
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,292
You're probably right.

122
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,766
ls this the Franklyn party?

123
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,531
-Yeah.
-So there are more of us.

124
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,472
Miranda.

125
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,769
Marvin Coolidge. A pleasure.

126
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,577
-Zach.
-What's up, dude?

127
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,978
Nikki told me to look for a goth babe
with an uptight suit-and-tie guy.

128
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,151
-She on the money.
-She called me uptight?

129
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,414
Don't sweat it, Zach, man.

130
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,752
I'm sure you're a cool fuckin' dude
on the inside, right?

131
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,379
I don't think I am.

132
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,722
Baby, could I get a Chivas, rocks?

133
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,124
Listen, I haven't talked to Nikki in,
like, five years and change and...

134
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,220
<i>Out of the blue</i>

135
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,698
What's up? Nikki.

136
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,193
Shit.

137
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,567
What's this gathering all about?

138
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,334
-We don't know.
-Nikki's late.

139
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,431
No, she's not late. She said 8:30.

140
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,910
She got, like, you know, three minutes.

141
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,605
She said 8:00, right?

142
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,170
I guess she did want us to meet.

143
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,749
Wait a second.

144
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,284
I know what this is all about.

145
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,544
-What?
-A new band.

146
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,953
-A band?
-What do you guys play?

147
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,958
Don't tell me. You are an ax man, right?

148
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,584
Bass?

149
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,754
-Keys?
-I get it.

150
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,855
You were in the jazz band
Nikki told me about.

151
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,861
Yeah, the Rebops.

152
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,265
What instrument do you play?

153
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,427
Vibes.

154
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,665
-What's vibes?
-Xylophone, man.

155
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,968
Me and Nikki had this
sweet musical groove going for a while.

156
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,306
You know that girl
is like Bruce Lee on the bongos, right?

157
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,774
<i>Yep, that's how we met.
A drum circle on Venice Beach.</i>

158
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,511
<i>Blew me away, man.</i>

159
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,878
-Really?
-We hooked up.

160
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,785
She put our band together.

161
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,346
This is not about a new band?

162
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,981
All I play is the radio.

163
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,049
I mean, I can barely work my iPod.

164
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,589
Okay. It's about something else.

165
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,827
-How well do you know Nikki?
-As well as anybody.

166
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,698
You know,
we lived together for five months.

167
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,464
Were you, like, roommates?

168
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,735
No, man. We were deep in it.

169
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,308
What's...

170
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,836
They were fucking.

171
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,145
Yeah. I mean, I get it.

172
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,185
So, hold up, you're an ex, too.

173
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,244
-Ex numero uno.
-Holy shit.

174
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,314
You're the guy who threw up on her
shoes at the Waffle Shack.

175
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,292
Don't go! No, no, please.

176
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,886
Holy shit.

177
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,727
-She tell everyone that story?
-I think so.

178
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,702
We all have one thing in common.

179
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,862
What's that?

180
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,700
No. You and Nikki?

181
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,367
Deep in it.

182
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,370
Damn, girl.

183
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,178
And did you know that Nikki was
recently released from an insane asylum

184
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,480
because she killed a guy?

185
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,713
-What?
-Yeah.

186
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,686
Her boyfriend at the time.

187
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,015
-Bullshit.
-Not.

188
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,790
Nikki told me herself. I just told Zach.

189
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,922
Wait, she killed a guy?

190
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,566
Damn, now I need this.

191
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,797
Wait, how is she even out?

192
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,599
Not guilty by reason of insanity.

193
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,069
Why does that hardly surprise me?

194
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,701
Everything the girl does, man...

195
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,042
The secrets, the games, this tonight,

196
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,604
anonymous gathering of ex-lovers.

197
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,807
Who does this?

198
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,148
I mean, she calls for the first time in years
and what do each of us do?

199
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,746
Drop everything, absolutely no questions
asked, to show up at this bar.

200
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,087
-We're devotees.
-No, suckers, man.

201
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,992
I remember one time, we were 16

202
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,626
and this punk band from Japan
that Nikki worships,

203
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,171
the Go Go Zombies, are playing at the Roxy.

204
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,174
But it's 21 and over to get in,
so we need fake IDs.

205
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,439
<i>First we go to MacArthur Park
and we find these gangbangers</i>

206
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,070
<i>who say that they could hook us up.</i>

207
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,912
<i>But, like idiots, as soon
as we showed them our money...</i>

208
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,216
<i>So now we've got no IDs</i>

209
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,258
<i>and no money to even buy tickets,
but Nikki won't give up.</i>

210
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,784
-No, she never gives up.
-Never ever.

211
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,127
She makes me drive to the Roxy way early
and wait until the band shows up.

212
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,824
All right, we're here, but I'm telling you,

213
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,458
they're never gonna let us in without IDs.

214
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,800
Trust me, this is gonna work. Take this.

215
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,839
<i>-And then she attacks them...
-Comrades.</i>

216
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,805
<i>...pretending to be this Russian journalist.</i>

217
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:55,539
We come all the way from Moscow to see
Go Go Zombies perform in USA.

218
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,514
-Magazine?
-It's like our Russian Rolling Stone.

219
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,345
<i>"Russian Rolling Stone."</i>

220
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,612
Da, co m rad e

221
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,881
"You big. Go Go Roxy Zombies big.

222
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,547
"Te|| us American Russkie comrades."

223
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,057
Number one record.

224
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,683
Yeah!

225
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,693
So give samurai!

226
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,786
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

227
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,392
-Great.
-You take a picture with us.

228
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,468
Good. Okay, get in close.

229
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,165
Yeah, everyone close together.

230
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,233
Maybe not as close. You come...

231
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,868
<i>So they invite us backstage.</i>

232
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,742
We get to see the show for free.

233
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,552
<i>But then afterwards,
I can't find Nikki anywhere.</i>

234
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,817
<i>She's gone.</i>

235
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,553
I know where this is going, man.

236
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,150
Then the next day, I see her at school.

237
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,358
-Hi.
-Hi.

238
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,592
Where'd you get all those hickeys?

239
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,328
<i>Iconfront her, but Nikki
claims that she can't remember</i>

240
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,837
<i>how she got the hickey necklace.</i>

241
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,237
<i>Because of this drinking game
they played on the bus ride home.</i>

242
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,242
I'm sorry that I made you worry.

243
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,369
I love you, Zachary Newman.

244
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,649
I chose to believe it

245
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,311
<i>because just being with Nikki was...</i>

246
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,253
ls the most fun I've ever had.

247
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,860
I got a storyjust like that one.

248
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,418
So when the Rebops got together,

249
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,485
we couldn't get arrested.

250
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,964
There's maybe five,
six decent joints in this town

251
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,467
that'll even book
a traditional jazz band, right?

252
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:27,868
<i>Nikki disappears for a few days. Disappears.</i>

253
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,962
Nikki?

254
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,973
<i>Now, I know about her bad habits
and I'm worried, you know, sick</i>

255
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,908
<i>that she might be back on the spike.</i>

256
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,537
<i>No. She returns. "Hey, baby. "</i>

257
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,811
<i>And by the way, the Rebops
have a Saturday night gig</i>

258
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:43,217
<i>at the Grill, the hottestspot in town,
the hottest.</i>

259
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,746
<i>We go, we do the damn thing. Kill it.</i>

260
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,225
<i>The place is packed
and they are feeling us strong.</i>

261
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,694
<i>It's the most intense experience.</i>

262
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,032
But the whole night,

263
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,069
this manager dude who books the bands

264
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,572
<i>is just staring at Nikki, drooling.</i>

265
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,939
<i>After the show was over, this guy comes up</i>

266
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,807
<i>and he's got his hands all over her.</i>

267
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,208
<i>I get it</i>

268
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,017
<i>She cut out on me to hang out
with this band manager guy</i>

269
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:23,321
<i>and that's how we get the gig
in the first place.</i>

270
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,167
Let me guess. You forgave her.

271
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,872
I did.

272
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,536
<i>Thanks to her, the Rebop word got out.</i>

273
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,376
<i>Yes, I did. You know,
we were happening, man</i>

274
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,713
<i>Three gigs a week, real money,
living the dream.</i>

275
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,117
<i>You know, {just put that
problem to the back of my mind,</i>

276
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,589
<i>wrote it off as like
a sacrifice that she made for us.</i>

277
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,885
<i>Sucker me.</i>

278
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,860
<i>She cuts out.</i>

279
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,420
This...

280
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,391
<i>God, I know that feeling</i>

281
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,662
<i>Yeah.</i>

282
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,835
Okay, I have a story that beats you both.

283
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,910
<i>When we first met,
Nikki and I were both recovering.</i>

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,004
-I'm Nikki.
-Miranda.

285
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:21,016
<i>Nikki didn't want me to know
that she was this privileged girl</i>

286
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,987
<i>who got stuck on smack the first time
she escaped her suburban life,</i>

287
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,547
<i>so she created an entire backstory.</i>

288
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,820
<i>She was a fashion model in Amsterdam,</i>

289
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,021
studied yoga in India.

290
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,690
She was living on some
fucking billionaire's yacht

291
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,166
playing the congas in a salsa band,

292
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,225
except she had to quit that
because of the stalker.

293
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,737
-That one I heard.
-Bullshit.

294
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,434
Look, she was still being stalked
when we were dating.

295
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,703
Really? Did you ever actually see the guy?

296
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,276
I... No. Just pictures, but...

297
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,713
It was all a lie.

298
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,911
And these lies start piling up
and I start asking questions.

299
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,279
She invites me to this dinner party, right,

300
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,254
<i>to finally meet all the friends
that she talks about</i>

301
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,824
<i>that I haven't met.</i>

302
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,254
<i>There's a guy from her ashram in India.</i>

303
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,560
<i>There's the Dutch couple that knew her in
Amsterdam when she was on the runway,</i>

304
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,068
<i>and this funky dude
that played in her salsa band,</i>

305
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,968
<i>and this weather-beaten dude
that just sailed in to town,</i>

306
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,768
<i>the skipper on the biIIionaire's yacht.</i>

307
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,241
<i>I left that dinner party believing every inch</i>

308
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,643
<i>of that intricate web of lies Nikki weaved.</i>

309
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,381
<i>A few weeks later,
I was bumming around Melrose</i>

310
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,078
<i>and I decided to pop
into that improv theater.</i>

311
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,092
<i>Five of the people
at Nikki's dinner party on the stage.</i>

312
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,823
And those people?

313
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,891
You're all fucking actors.

314
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,989
I looked at pictures
of your children for 20 minutes.

315
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,726
Do you think that was fun for me? It wasn't.

316
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,599
Nikki hired and directed
a fucking improvtroupe?

317
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,263
She did.

318
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,736
-Get out.
-Pure evil genius.

319
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,605
-I fell for it hard.
-Let me guess.

320
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,807
You didn't break up with her that night,
did you?

321
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,315
Worse.

322
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,221
What the fuck are you doing here?

323
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,761
You're lucky my landlord didn't shoot you.

324
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,320
Relax. There's nobody home.

325
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,366
I got your message.

326
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,938
And I wanted to be honest with you,

327
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,800
tell you the truth about me,

328
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,469
something that I should really do.

329
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,378
Really? That would be nice.

330
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,307
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

331
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,848
I realized

332
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,350
that I don't wanna lose you.

333
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,456
What do you want from me?

334
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,654
You.

335
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,728
Do you know what else I want?

336
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,669
No.

337
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,671
Company

338
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,217
Get in the pool. Please.

339
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,551
<i>That night I Iet Nikki seduce me
for the very first time.</i>

340
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,902
The lies began your relationship?

341
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,166
-Yep.
-Get out.

342
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,542
I guess it was just so romantic, you know,

343
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,345
that she would wanna
go through all these lengths

344
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,250
to keep up this fantasy world that we built.

345
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,119
-How long did it last?
-100 days.

346
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,159
<i>Then I had to puff the plug</i>

347
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,723
<i>I mean, I had to get back to real fife</i>

348
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,433
I swear, kicking Nikki was even fucking
harder than kicking heroin.

349
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,569
Well, you're stronger than me and Marvin.

350
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,511
-We both got dumped.
-Look, knowing this, right,

351
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,641
that she's got these mad lying skills,

352
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,275
doesn't that put a little doubt

353
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,218
in this whole insane asylum scenario?

354
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,383
Yeah, I guess, but, I mean, I googled it.

355
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,950
There were case numbers and legal briefs.

356
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,325
I guess you could fake that shit, but why?

357
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,666
Who knows? I mean, with Nikki
the truth is always relative.

358
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,259
I do know one thing. She got us together

359
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:36,295
knowing full well we'd be sitting here,
waiting for her, talking about her...

360
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,568
-Right.
-...and murder.

361
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,040
I got a text from Nikki.

362
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:47,907
So do I.

363
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,185
Yeah, me three.

364
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,256
"Sorry I'm late. OMG, traffic.

365
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,450
"Bringing my next victim.
You guys get cozy.

366
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,460
Talk about My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult
See you soon."

367
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,756
That's what mine says, too.

368
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,024
Same.

369
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,962
Next victim? That sounds ominous.

370
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,897
And she claims she's in a cult.

371
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,061
Man, this is bizarre.

372
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,466
No way.

373
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,439
Marvin doesn't know about
Nikki and the Thrill Kills,

374
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,943
the name of Nikki's all-time favorite band.

375
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,479
-My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult.
-Who are they?

376
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,310
Why mention them in a text?

377
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,712
In case you haven't talked
about my recent role

378
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,308
as a psycho killer, please, do tell.

379
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,619
Hold on a second.

380
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,223
Figures they'd have
the Thrill Kills on the jukebox

381
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,163
in the place that Nikki picked to meet.

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,981
Come on, Nikki couldn't stand
this bubble-gum stuff, man.

383
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,016
She could hardly tolerate classic rock.

384
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:56,576
Marvin, dude,
the bubble-gummier, the better.

385
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,315
She didn't just like classic rock,

386
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,756
she loved Styx and Meat Loaf and Kiss.

387
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,727
Yeah, any band that wears leather,
spandex or spiked wristbands.

388
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,264
Or performs in their underwear,

389
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,095
furry animal costumes.

390
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:13,727
She liked Tito, the Cubans,

391
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,863
bands that came out of Harlem in the '40s.

392
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,498
But this...

393
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,942
-Marvin, you got played.
-Like a ping pong ball.

394
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,673
Yo, look, Nikki loves jazz, man.

395
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,272
I'm telling you people facts.

396
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,907
You just don't know her like I do.

397
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:30,886
Nikki used to say that jazz
was fun, camp, kitsch.

398
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,719
Kitsch? Hell no. She didn't say that.

399
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,282
-She never said that.
-Yeah, she did.

400
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,055
You're telling me my whole relationship...

401
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,596
Predicated on a lie.

402
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,363
Just like her fucking tale about the stalker.

403
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,903
Okay, you know what?
Musical taste, one thing.

404
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,200
But the whole stalker thing
I got you both on that one.

405
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,865
You know what? I can prove it.

406
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,774
She showed me his mug shot
on the national stalker registry

407
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,244
right next to her official
police restraining order.

408
00:23:56,302 --> 00:24:00,148
His name is Mark something.

409
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,582
-You know, I bet you it's still posted.
-Drinks?

410
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,478
-Yes.
-Sure.

411
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,886
-Yeah, all around.
-It's almost 9:00.

412
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,618
I'm on my third martini with no dinner.

413
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,455
-Amateur.
-And you're what, a pro?

414
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,430
I'm an all-star, junior.

415
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,431
Got him. Creepy dude.

416
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,296
His name is Mark Von Dutch.

417
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,962
Nikki told me if I ever
saw this cat to call the cops, emergency.

418
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,666
He looks like a movie star, but demented.

419
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,800
-Oh, my God.
-What?

420
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,173
That's the guy she killed.

421
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:30,605
What? Wait, how do you know that?

422
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:34,048
<i>She sent me a photo of them
together after we broke up.</i>

423
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,244
<i>Her new handsome love.</i>

424
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,116
<i>She was probably fuckin' trying
to make me jealous.</i>

425
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,183
Anyone else here a little
freaked out right now?

426
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:41,889
I'm intrigued.

427
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,451
Okay, you knew about
this whole homicide thing beforehand.

428
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,155
She even sent you a damn photo.

429
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:50,791
And you showed up anyway
because you're intrigued?

430
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:52,629
lam.

431
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,830
To see your friend who kills dudes.

432
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:58,108
What kind of ghoul does that make you?

433
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,638
A sexy one.

434
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,814
-Nikki.
-Drinks, anyone?

435
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,315
I mugged the waitress on the way over.

436
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,836
-You look awesome.
-Thanks, stud.

437
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,487
Let's see.

438
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,390
Rotgut, rocks.

439
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,486
Must be Marvin "Jazz Man" Coolidge.

440
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,657
You got that right, bongo girl.

441
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,700
Absinthe,

442
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,169
for the sexy ghoul.

443
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:04,534
Thank you.

444
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,875
And a martini with a billion zillion olives,

445
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,608
that has got to be you, Zachary Newman.

446
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,377
I skipped dinner.

447
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,385
-And that leaves Sprite for me.
-Sprite?

448
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,751
What about your signature vodka gimlet?

449
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,814
Not tonight. I wanna keep my wits about me

450
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,088
in case something horrifying
and crazy happens.

451
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,325
Like what?

452
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,595
I'm surprised you haven't
figured it out yet, Miranda.

453
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,196
You could always see through me
with those gorgeous X-ray eyes.

454
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,606
-It's a compliment.
-How about just an answer?

455
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,679
Come on, where's the fun in that?

456
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,904
I've gathered you all here for a reason,

457
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,414
which will become obvious in a moment.

458
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:49,214
There's no use rushing me.

459
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,754
Did you tell Marvin that I'm uptight?

460
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,015
Yes, I did, because you are.

461
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,889
But it works for you, Zach.

462
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,293
It's part of your extreme cute lovability.

463
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:00,823
Am I right?

464
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,456
I've already told him he's cute.

465
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,433
Miranda likes nerds. She's into geek chic.

466
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,732
I'm not a nerd or a geek or whatever.

467
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:11,434
Zach, man, chill. Just own it.

468
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:14,307
Who's the beer and the sidecar for?

469
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,641
-Bert.
-Bert?

470
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,840
-He's parking.
-Who's Bert?

471
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,109
My |awyer,

472
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,746
lover...

473
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,085
And next victim.

474
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:27,747
Gotcha.

475
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,623
I knew you guys would get hung up on that.

476
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,684
Drumroll, please.

477
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,957
Nobody?

478
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,658
Okay.

479
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,634
He's my fiancé.

480
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:44,437
-You're getting married?
-To your criminal lawyer?

481
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,533
Honey, I only have one lawyer.

482
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:49,806
Isn't that a conflict of interest
or a major ethical breach?

483
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,707
My life was in his hands.

484
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,908
He saved it.

485
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,851
There's no feeling more intense.

486
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,321
We're mad for each other.

487
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,486
He's my everything.

488
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,954
Woe be he or she

489
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,499
who falls in love with Nikki Franklyn.

490
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,063
I'll drink to that.

491
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,533
It is so amazing

492
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,336
to see you guys.

493
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,474
I've missed you.

494
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,724
So this whole night is about bringing

495
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,815
your present lover to your past.

496
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,884
Bert's curious about you guys.

497
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,897
I think he thinks
you're all just figments of my imagination.

498
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:46,367
Nikki, there's this homicide rumor thing

499
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,098
that we've been hearing about.

500
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,702
What's funny? That's serious.

501
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,614
Zach is so squeamish
bringing up the subject.

502
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,080
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:02,050
I want to talk about it, clear the air.

504
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:07,454
Okay, is that him, the stalker?

505
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,194
Yeah, that's him.

506
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,628
That's Mark.

507
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,358
Nikki, why were you with this guy?

508
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,558
I was insane.

509
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,466
ls that true?

510
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,096
I was certified.

511
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,299
If either of you lame-brains
bothered to Google me,

512
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,808
-you would've read all about it.
-Nik!

513
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,709
Nik? He calls you Nik?

514
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,510
<i>In high school, she keyed
our teacher's car for calling her Nik.</i>

515
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,953
She poured a pot of burning hot coffee
in a guy's face in rehab

516
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,422
<i>for calling her Nik.</i>

517
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,187
The last fool I heard
call you Nik got a broken nose.

518
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,922
People change.

519
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:49,992
There you are.

520
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:15,354
So these are your friends.

521
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:18,918
Bert, Zach, Marvin and Miranda.

522
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,224
A pleasure to meet you.

523
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,822
Nikjust kept insisting
that we all get together.

524
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:23,958
I'm sure.

525
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,626
Yeah. Hi.

526
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,598
A sidecar.

527
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,701
Good girl.

528
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:38,072
A toast to old friends and new,

529
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,640
and to the most
beautiful woman I've ever known.

530
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,881
Bottoms up.

531
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,056
Let me guess.

532
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,666
Let me guess.

533
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,069
I bet you you're the guy
that puked on her prom shoes.

534
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:07,541
I love you so much.

535
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,513
That would be me.
Or "uptight guy" works, too, I guess.

536
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,517
And you're the jazz guy
who wears the kitschy clothes.

537
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,586
I'm not kitschy or kitsch anything.

538
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,643
I'm vintage, Bert.

539
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,314
It was a compliment.

540
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,114
And you...

541
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,094
You're the attorney who fucks his
desperate, insane, criminal clients.

542
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,324
Guilty as charged.

543
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,925
You're right, baby, she does have fangs.

544
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:36,567
You can't always control
who you fall in love with, Miranda.

545
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,569
Mature people do.

546
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,035
She had plenty of control, believe me.

547
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,205
I'm the one who lost it.

548
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,271
In 20 years of practice,

549
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:50,183
<i>Nik is the only client
who ever stole my heart.</i>

550
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:59,061
<i>Nikki doesn't steal hearts, she eats them.</i>

551
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,998
How do we even know
you're not another actor,

552
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,428
you know, part of Nikki's
next elaborate scheme?

553
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,299
-It's a good question.
-Yeah.

554
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,705
It's true, I am a notorious,
habitual, elaborate schemer.

555
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,073
-Who else would I be?
-Anybody.

556
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,238
We don't know Nikki's
real reason for bringing us all here tonight.

557
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,543
I doubt it's just to make your acquaintance.

558
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,107
Maybe you're just here
to back up her next tall tale.

559
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,653
Yeah. How do we know that you're you?

560
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:28,953
Jesus, what the hell have you done
to these people?

561
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,758
Magic.

562
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,218
Okay.

563
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,959
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

564
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:40,936
Here's my driver's license,
my California bar card

565
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:44,064
and my black belt certification in karate.

566
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,166
Don't you mess with me.

567
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,648
I guess you're legit.

568
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,810
Or at least have high-quality
forged identification.

569
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,615
You're screwing your lawyer.

570
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,712
You make it sound so glamorous.

571
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,656
What happened?

572
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,086
I mean, not with you and Bert,
but with the murder.

573
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,959
Yeah, and the insanity thing.

574
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,692
-You should know, Marvin.
-I should know?

575
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,292
I told you that my stalker
showed up at our last gig.

576
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,837
-Where?
-He's right there.

577
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,505
I---

578
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,810
<i>You thought you saw that dude
dozens of times.</i>

579
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,473
I never did.

580
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:29,007
It's a common symptom
of her psychosis. Paranoia.

581
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,145
Okay, so how do you know
the last time was real,

582
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,486
not just paranoia barking?

583
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,492
Because he wouldn't go away.

584
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,324
<i>He kept showing up at the local coffee shop,</i>

585
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,490
<i>our rehearsal space,
when I was out for a run.</i>

586
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,498
<i>I couldn't shake him</i>

587
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,229
<i>He wouldn't even say anything.</i>

588
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:50,033
<i>He just stood there, staring at me,</i>

589
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,130
<i>waiting for me to break the ice.</i>

590
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,567
And you did?

591
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,168
Why didn't you just call the cops?

592
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,308
Because I was feeling lonely.

593
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,372
-Lonely?
-I've heard that before.

594
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,917
For your freaking stalker?

595
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,543
It's not as nutty as it sounds.

596
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,053
It's quite common, actually.

597
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,851
Although, now I know
that I was completely insane.

598
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:12,089
I mean, Mark didn't appear out of nowhere.

599
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,925
We dated for almost two years.

600
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,864
If I was gonna ask
another person to be at this table tonight,

601
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,902
this table of people I love,

602
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,428
it would have been him.

603
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:25,100
So, what? You were over me?

604
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,844
I was.

605
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,505
And jazz and the Rebops.

606
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,107
My instinct was to bolt,
just take off, start fresh somewhere.

607
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:39,246
So I snuck in your closet
because I knew you kept cash in there,

608
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:40,755
and I was gonna bankroll my getaway.

609
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,223
And guess what else I found?

610
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,428
What, my Nehru jacket?

611
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,789
A thick bindle of fine gold dust.

612
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,526
-No, you didn't.
-I did.

613
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,060
And I shot it
and I didn't stop until I got arrested.

614
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,204
How romantic.

615
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,866
You didn't find any heroin in my closet.

616
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,570
You wanted to go,
so you went and scored some smack.

617
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,179
Don't put that shit on me.

618
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,976
-What about all the hints?
-What hints?

619
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,572
You were going on and on

620
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,276
about all those jazz masters
that were hypes,

621
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,546
about how heroin helped creativity.

622
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,682
Why would I do that?

623
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,451
To kill my will.

624
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,154
You were afraid I was gonna leave you.

625
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,154
Nikki,

626
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:21,959
I didn't drop any hints

627
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:25,664
or otherwise recommend you take heroin.

628
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:28,671
And I didn't know you were
gonna leave me at all.

629
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,105
Hallucinations and delusions were
all part of her psychosis.

630
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,237
Yeah, maybe that explains it.

631
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,109
Yeah. I was just bonkers.

632
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,542
She told me that story years ago.

633
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,140
I thought she might have imagined it, too.

634
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,083
She was in the height of her mania.

635
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,519
So, what?

636
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,920
One day you just decided
to poison this guy?

637
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,481
You guys don't understand what it was like.

638
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,492
I mean, Mark and I were junkies.

639
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:55,326
<i>We only left the house
to steal, scam and buy more drugs.</i>

640
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,924
I mean, Mark was
even more paranoid than I was deranged.

641
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,697
ls this the shrimp flavor?

642
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,830
Chicken.

643
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,602
I like the shrimp flavor.

644
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,670
He wouldn't even let me
out of his sight for five minutes.

645
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,180
He was your stalker.

646
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,808
I was losing days, time,

647
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,615
<i>hopping in and out ofplaces,</i>

648
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,713
<i>blacking out somewhere,
waking up somewhere else.</i>

649
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,449
<i>It was crazy.</i>

650
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,424
<i>This would happen while
I was awake, dreaming,</i>

651
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,892
<i>I couldn't tell the difference.</i>

652
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,022
<i>One minute I'm in a garage
stealing garden tools,</i>

653
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,826
<i>the next second
I'm on the couch watching TV.</i>

654
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:32,801
<i>I was skipping around in time.</i>

655
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,564
<i>Kind of like in Slaughterhouse-Five.</i>

656
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,400
Your favorite book?

657
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,736
It's similar, I guess.

658
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,675
I never really thought of it like that.

659
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,074
Okay, but how did the deed get done?

660
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,045
-I don't really know.
-Get out.

661
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,047
<i>I pop in and all of a sudden,</i>

662
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,140
<i>the cops swarm in
while I'm with this drug dealer.</i>

663
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,914
<i>I think it's a set-up, but I'm busted.</i>

664
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,920
<i>But it's just fuck that they found me then</i>

665
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,354
-Turn around!
-Don't move!

666
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,791
<i>I mean, there are squad cars,
detectives, a helicopter.</i>

667
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,193
<i>They've got an arrest warrant
on me for first-degree murder.</i>

668
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,562
But you have no idea how you killed him?

669
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,361
I don't remember any of it.

670
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,528
Her clinical medical diagnosis
was homicidal mania.

671
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,869
The black-outs, hallucinations, delusions,
paranoia, it's all part of it.

672
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,543
Then her violent primitive instinct
for self-preservation kicks in.

673
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,476
The victim loses control, kills.

674
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,274
Oftentimes they don't remember anything.

675
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,285
And you could sleep
in the same bed with a homicidal maniac?

676
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:25,815
Aren't you worried about not waking up?

677
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:28,255
No, no. No, no, no. Not at all.

678
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,553
Her psychiatrist is a personal friend of mine.

679
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:35,228
And she's back, 100% normal.

680
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:39,531
Homicidal mania
isn't a mind-fractured-forever-type deal?

681
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,970
No, no, no. The illness is gone
once the threat's removed.

682
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:46,975
In some cases, like schizophrenics,
there's always a perceived threat,

683
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,510
so oftentimes they can't be cured.

684
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,911
But with Nik, Mark's gone.

685
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,640
No more threat, no more mania.

686
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,811
The diagnosis from your personal friend

687
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:00,152
was that Nikki serves
only three years in jail for murder.

688
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,349
It sounds fishy.

689
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:05,121
Nik being fit for release
was not just my friend's opinion.

690
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,823
There were two other doctors
and I think seven members

691
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,263
on the hospital release board.

692
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,663
They were unanimous.

693
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,996
I'm with you on the insane Nikki.

694
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,066
Out of her mind on heroin,

695
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,505
doing daily crimes with psychopath Mark
to keep up their habit,

696
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,837
but how do you know you're cured?

697
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:23,880
Believe me, Coolidge,
if I wasn't cured, you'd be dead.

698
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:28,346
I was so mad at you
for planting that badness.

699
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,415
I wanted to kill you.

700
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,477
I'm gonna say this one more time.

701
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,251
I didn't.

702
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,122
I'm understanding that now,

703
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,958
that I was delusional, but it's moot, really.

704
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,052
Moot how?

705
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,759
Because I've already decided
to overlook the whole thing.

706
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:47,998
I really do love you.
We had so many great times.

707
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,630
And I knew that seeing you again,

708
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:54,507
having a laugh,
would be a triumph over my illness,

709
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,636
that my mania was behind me.

710
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,780
That sounds not insane.

711
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,616
-Still don't believe it.
-Neither do I.

712
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,217
Why not? Aside from
my notorious scheming.

713
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:13,853
It's like claiming black-out
as your first line of defense.

714
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,489
And the rest of it plays out
like the plot of your favorite book.

715
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,034
I told you they wouldn't believe me.

716
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:20,998
You know, you two belong together.

717
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,834
-You're both way too skeptical.
-We know you.

718
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,771
Yeah. I mean, you're crazy, but like a fox.

719
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,207
As they say.

720
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,440
It doesn't matter.

721
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:36,042
They're just your friends,
not judge and jury, thank God.

722
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:37,848
You know what really happened.

723
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,913
But I don't.

724
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,685
Really? Total amnesia?

725
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,158
What's the difference?

726
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,787
It's not like any of our relationships
were based on truth anyway.

727
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,258
Never.

728
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,531
Yeah, I guess.

729
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,398
What are you getting at, Miranda?

730
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,493
I'm saying that our relationships

731
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,006
were based on being party
to your crazy adventures.

732
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,440
-They still are.
-Yeah.

733
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:03,980
I mean, most nights this late
I'm still at the office or home alone,

734
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:08,508
sitting on the couch, watching TV,
eating a $6 burger,

735
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,449
certainly not tipsy in a bar,

736
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,546
having my mind blown by
the girl who devirginized me.

737
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,152
I'm with Zach.

738
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:20,219
Let's forget about the past
and focus on your good news.

739
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,059
Yeah, you got away with murder.

740
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,962
-No, not that.
-No?

741
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:27,360
-You're over your insanity.
-Thank you.

742
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,200
That's sweet, but that's not
what I was thinking.

743
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,467
What are you driving at, Miranda?

744
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:34,700
-You're getting married.
-Right.

745
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,976
That is why we're here.

746
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,642
So, when's the big day?

747
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,553
That is the question of the hour.

748
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,685
I have an announcement to make,
a humongous one.

749
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,381
You do?

750
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,792
Can we get a bottle of champagne
with five glasses, please?

751
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:55,125
Champagne?
I'm gonna have to take a cab home.

752
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,597
I thought you're not drinking.

753
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,258
Only one. This calls for it.

754
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,599
Let's get to the humongous news.

755
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,399
You don't know the news?

756
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:06,170
-No clue.
-This should be good.

757
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:07,301
Here it is.

758
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,604
June the 18th.

759
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,005
What about it?

760
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:15,812
- Our wedding day
- It is?

761
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,109
Surprise.

762
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,313
So totally awesome.

763
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,522
I listed our engagement with LA magazine

764
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,991
and they wanted a date,

765
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:27,552
so I picked one nine months away.

766
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:30,600
It's plenty of time to get our asses in gear
and make it happen.

767
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,295
-That's great.
-Righteous.

768
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,531
You know, I'll go if I'm invited.

769
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:39,268
Nik, how could you do this?
What were you thinking?

770
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,135
I picked a date.

771
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,440
I mean, you can pick the location.

772
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,108
I know that you wanted
to elope and we can still do that.

773
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,482
-I just figured that we would save...
-That is not the point.

774
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,384
This is a public announcement.

775
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,655
Honey, so is this.

776
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,585
I should have been consulted.

777
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,589
-Why? Does the date not work?
-It's not about the date.

778
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,355
Then what is it?

779
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,422
Should I open this or do you guys
wanna do the honors yourself?

780
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,060
Do you want me to leave it?

781
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,305
If the partners in my firm see this, I'm done.

782
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:21,612
I'm sorry. I didn't have dinner.

783
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,679
You told me that didn't matter.

784
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:31,215
What I said was that
I needed some more time for this transition.

785
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:33,990
Okay, and nine months isn't enough?

786
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,261
If my partners see this, I'll be out in a day.

787
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:40,063
So, what? You hate your partners.

788
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,001
Nik, it's not that simple.

789
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,267
Dude, I'm sorry.
How well do you know Nikki?

790
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:45,864
Yeah, this is Nikki 101.

791
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,841
She wants something, you don't want it,

792
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,345
she'll pull some stunt that makes
everything work out her way anyway.

793
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,937
Blonde with Lobotomy Eyes

794
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:55,678
A "black magic panther
who gets what she's after!

795
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,147
I need some food.

796
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,485
What the hell are they talking about?

797
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:03,185
"Blonde with Lobotomy Eyes"
is the title of a Thrill Kill Kult song,

798
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,955
but they're right.

799
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:08,797
How long do we have to wait?

800
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,855
Can we talk about this later?

801
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:14,064
Now's good. We have champagne.

802
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,901
My best, oldest friends
gathered to celebrate.

803
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,736
This is a set-up.

804
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,571
It's just, it's not for us.

805
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,110
Man, do I feel like an ass.

806
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,204
Here I was, thinking this
was about a new band.

807
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,873
You're the sucker, Bert.

808
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,475
Nikki's invited us here to pressure you

809
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:31,478
into committing to marriage.

810
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,249
She's put you on the spot.

811
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,086
Yeah, Bert, why won't you give her a date?

812
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:38,525
-Yeah.
-They're on my side, darling.

813
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:42,497
Maybe this homicidal mania
really does bother you after all.

814
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:45,932
Or maybe you're just a scummy guy

815
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,062
who takes advantage of beautiful women
in emotional distress.

816
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,606
Which one is it, Bert?

817
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:54,940
Cold feet or a cold, cold heart?

818
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,980
Perhaps I don't like
discussing our private matters

819
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:01,744
with people that, quite frankly,
I don't know very well.

820
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,787
ls that all that sinister?

821
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:08,016
-But these people know me.
-Yeah, I'm with Miranda.

822
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,252
I actually think
it's the murder thing that bugs you,

823
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,453
cause she could snap. You d be next.

824
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:13,928
What I think, too. Yeah.

825
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,965
I think we're reassurance.

826
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,125
The three of us are here to prove

827
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:20,635
that Nikki doesn't murder
everyone she sleeps with.

828
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,330
That's...

829
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,930
You don't have those mortality issues,
do you, Bert?

830
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,500
-No, no.
-Then what is it?

831
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,603
You want a date, baby?

832
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,414
That's it.

833
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,516
Or that's it.

834
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,112
So what was it? June 18th, right?

835
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,228
June the 18th of next year.

836
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:53,233
Well, then, that is the day
that we shall be married.

837
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:56,431
Do you mean that?

838
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,272
Yes, baby, I do mean it.

839
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:08,082
So. That's not happening.

840
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,675
-No way.
-Yeah, he said that just to get her off.

841
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:14,211
-Let's do it! Yeah!
-I love you so much!

842
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,553
Till death do

843
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,254
us part.

844
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,531
-It might not be that long.
-Yeah. See? Mania.

845
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,566
-Congrats, man.
-Yeah.

846
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:32,630
That's...

847
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,678
I am so excited.

848
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:51,517
I love you, baby.

849
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:03,234
So I will admit that I had a hidden agenda,

850
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:06,901
but getting Bert to come around
wasn't the only one.

851
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:11,504
Also, since the day I met Miranda

852
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,883
I have always thought that she would be

853
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,443
perfect with Zach.

854
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:20,945
What?

855
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:26,884
So this is like a psychotronic episode
of Blind Date?

856
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,062
Feels that way.

857
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,895
Seriously, you guys, thank you for coming.

858
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,735
To what could have been my funeral.

859
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,571
Come again?

860
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,237
If Bert had turned me down

861
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,248
after all the disgusting things
he made me do just to save me,

862
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,375
I would have fucking killed myself.

863
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,393
Excuse me.

864
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,826
I gotta pee.

865
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:12,299
So much drama.

866
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,873
I'll go.

867
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,655
I guess we got our answer.

868
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:29,487
You got a cold, cold heart.

869
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,583
What?

870
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,752
We're getting married, Marvin.

871
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,231
Yeah, sure, you are.

872
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:41,500
Someone's not a happy camper.

873
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:44,665
Shut the fuck up, bitch, or I will cut you!

874
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:47,175
Be careful. She's crazy.

875
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:52,047
You doing okay in there?

876
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:56,309
-ls she gone?
-Yes.

877
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:03,288
Look at me, I'm such a mess.

878
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:07,887
- Why are you crying?
- These are tears of joy.

879
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:11,525
I finally met a man
who's a better liar than I am.

880
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:14,900
Baby, it's not the end of the world
You kicked heroin twice.

881
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,229
You can get over Bert.

882
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:19,241
I don't think so.

883
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,136
Why not?

884
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,609
Because he's gonna pay.

885
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,180
I even let that prick call me Nik

886
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:30,481
like I'm some grease monkey
mechanic or douchebag frat boy.

887
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:34,455
I am not Nik. I am Nikki, motherfucker!

888
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,722
Can I borrow your makeup?

889
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:45,566
-Can I ask you something?
-Shoot.

890
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:49,571
How does a smart guy like you,
a lawyer with enough savvy

891
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:54,474
to get a person free on murder,
end up romantically involved

892
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:57,978
with his homicidal, heroin-addict client?

893
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,608
-She's amazing.
-I'm calling bullshit.

894
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,517
You have no intention of marrying Nikki.

895
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,988
I see the way she has you defending her
and shilling for her,

896
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,026
making sure that we believe
her insanity story.

897
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,096
No, I believe she was insane.

898
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,153
You're in the dark, Marvin.

899
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,824
But you... You're her accomplice.

900
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:20,994
That is an outrageous accusation.

901
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,836
I love her.

902
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,810
What are you gonna do, kill your fiancé?

903
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,073
You know, I thought about it.

904
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,641
But killing that self-righteous
dingleberry is just too easy.

905
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:38,053
Easy?

906
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:39,918
Killing is easy?

907
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,823
I want his balls burning in hell.

908
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:46,388
How are you gonna do that?

909
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:49,355
You'll see.

910
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,864
I... Okay.

911
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:00,568
Can I please have some cocktail cherries?

912
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,237
-With the champagne?
-Just it's... I'm sick of eating the olives.

913
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,746
Okay.

914
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:11,251
Honestly, man to man,

915
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:14,082
you really think Nikki was insane?

916
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:16,317
Enough to beat a murder rap?

917
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,658
That's irrelevant.

918
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:22,425
My job is to defend people
that are charged with a crime

919
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,560
and it's their right to have
vigorous legal counsel.

920
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,332
What I think doesn't matter.

921
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,435
What's your non-legal opinion?

922
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,673
L...listen to the experts.

923
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:52,358
ls this plan gonna go down tonight?

924
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:55,761
You're so inquisitive.

925
00:50:57,822 --> 00:50:59,802
It's attractive.

926
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:02,201
It's like a hot succubus Nancy Drew.

927
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:07,136
So what do you think of Zach?

928
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,409
- He thinks Nikki's full of it
- No, I didn't say that.

929
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:15,542
Bert, confess.

930
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:17,085
You wanted deep in it.

931
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:19,947
Deep in it?

932
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:23,116
Deep in it" is ajazz expression
I just learned.

933
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,591
It means "fucking."

934
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,154
So you went along with her plot,

935
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,164
helped her plead insanity and proved it,

936
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,065
and in return she gave you her?

937
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,501
That is low down.

938
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,667
Bert, man, defend yourself.

939
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,677
You want me to be honest?

940
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:03,194
My answer is yes, Nikki is
abso-fucking-lutely insane.

941
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,295
ls? You mean like...

942
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:08,869
As in presently, real-time, in the bathroom.

943
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:12,030
-Damn.
-Then, why is she out of prison?

944
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,103
I could give you 200,000 reasons why.

945
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:18,147
What, you greased the doctors?

946
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:19,806
And a couple of members of the board

947
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,215
but Nik doesn't know about that, so...

948
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:25,811
-What, and you admit that?
-But that's a crime.

949
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:29,417
Yeah, what are you gonna do about it?

950
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,484
What are you, cops? It's untraceable.

951
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,860
You ever bring it up again,
I'll deny we ever had this conversation.

952
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,966
Now that's jazz.

953
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:48,736
$200,000?

954
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,335
Where do you get that kind of cash?

955
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,445
Cause I m fuckin rich, brother

956
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,848
I make more than that every month.

957
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,712
What you don't realize
is I represent drug dealers,

958
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,791
gangsters, even bankers.

959
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:05,293
Okay, but why?

960
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,158
And then... And why tell us?

961
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:09,322
At first, I thought like you,
Zach, that she was faking it.

962
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,730
She even told me she was faking it

963
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:14,702
to lure me in like some femme fatale

964
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:17,262
<i>straight out of Double Indemnity.</i>

965
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,604
And then I... You know,
I was going through a tough divorce

966
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:24,703
and she'sjust...
You know, she's so yummy.

967
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:28,181
She's so magnetic, right?

968
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,876
And I thought,
why not represent this damsel in distress

969
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,048
after she just knocked off
this animal stalker,

970
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:38,855
son of a bitch, arm-robbing,
fuckin' drug-dealing punk?

971
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:42,227
Which arguably could have been
a case for self-defense.

972
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:45,130
And I was just trying
to look for a way to get her

973
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,701
an easy sentence, you know?

974
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:50,565
Then I started working my angles
to get her out early

975
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:53,108
at the hospital because...

976
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:57,771
She just makes me feel like I'm 20 again.

977
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,405
She's walking Viagra.

978
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:06,480
Okay, so she wasn't faking insanity?

979
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,579
Not in my opinion, no.

980
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,455
And she's not even cured,
but she doesn't realize it yet.

981
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:13,256
She's zipped out of her mind,

982
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:16,526
but she thinks she's brilliant-diamond clear.

983
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:20,196
I mean, I didn't realize
how disturbed she was mentally

984
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,964
until I had already sprung her.

985
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,630
And by then, it was too late.

986
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:27,038
What's she done that's so crazy?

987
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:31,944
She traded in my Jag for an old '67
GTO with a shot transmission

988
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:35,745
<i>because she didn't wanna drive
around in an elitist vehicle.</i>

989
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:37,479
<i>That's not crazy. It's just Nik</i>

990
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:40,181
Yeah, Nikki hates every car built after 1979.

991
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,053
Except the Mini Cooper.

992
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,422
How about she slept
with my psychiatrist friend

993
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,983
and God knows how many others

994
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,994
so she can get out of the institution?

995
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:49,989
One other guy comes to mind.

996
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:53,057
I am positive she murdered
my sister's cockatoo.

997
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,736
Zorro! Zorro!

998
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,339
<i>I can't prove it,
but she always hated that bird.</i>

999
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,670
<i>We weren't at my sister's
house for more than 30 minutes</i>

1000
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:04,610
and that bird Zorro was
on the bottom of the cage, feet up, dead.

1001
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,505
Do you really think
she's a homicidal maniac?

1002
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,608
No, no, that's just some line
we came up with for her defense,

1003
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,813
but I sure think she's something.

1004
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,355
And you didn't realize any of this

1005
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:16,288
until you sprung her
from the insane asylum?

1006
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,189
-That's...
-That's fucked up.

1007
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,921
-Yeah.
-I know.

1008
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,727
I feel like Dr. Frankenstein,

1009
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:27,166
my monster out there running amok.

1010
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,294
I hope you end up
better than Dr. Frankenstein.

1011
00:55:29,393 --> 00:55:31,430
Quite honestly, I didn't even wanna be here.

1012
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,305
I knew Nikki was up
to her old tricks, scheming, right?

1013
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:36,905
But it was you, Marvin... You, you knew.

1014
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:39,345
I did? What?

1015
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:44,011
I was curious to meet with three people
who had been her lovers and survived.

1016
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:47,851
I figured I might pick up a pointer or two.

1017
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,255
You think she wants to kill you?

1018
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,721
Yeah.

1019
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:57,755
After we get married for my money
or after she decides she hates me.

1020
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,069
Most definitely.

1021
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:07,434
Listen, fellas, I keep

1022
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:10,206
having this reoccurring nightmare,
you know?

1023
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:12,838
And I'm like that bird
trapped in the cage and...

1024
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:15,645
My bed's on fire.

1025
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,679
<i>But I wake up screaming</i>

1026
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,521
<i>and who's that lying in the bed next to me,</i>

1027
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,455
<i>staring at me?</i>

1028
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,258
Nikki.

1029
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:35,127
I mean, she does have
a warped sense of humor.

1030
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,265
Very.

1031
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,235
How did you guys end it with her?

1032
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,106
I mean, that's...
That's what I really need to know.

1033
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,613
We didn't. She broke up with us.

1034
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,912
Yeah, I mean, Miranda is the only one
who had the guts to drop Nikki.

1035
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:54,752
They've been gone a long time.

1036
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,457
I'm gonna...

1037
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,971
Nikki? Miranda?

1038
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:16,071
You guys okay in there?

1039
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,646
We're fine. I'm good.

1040
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:26,510
-You're not gonna believe this.
-Did Nikki try to kill you?

1041
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,681
-What?
-Bert was out there.

1042
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,952
He was telling us about
Nikki committing homicide on a cockatoo

1043
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:32,858
and having these recurring dreams
about being burned alive,

1044
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:36,762
and I just... Well, I realized that you
had been gone alone a while...

1045
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:41,696
I'm way off base, aren't I?

1046
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,898
-Not really, no.
-I'm not?

1047
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:48,000
No, I was actuallyjust surprised
by the accuracy of your question.

1048
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:52,577
She gave me this.

1049
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,979
ls that a gun? That's a real gun?

1050
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,381
She pulled it out of her garter belt.

1051
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,009
She's wearing garter belts?

1052
00:57:58,108 --> 00:57:59,815
I know. I have to admit it was kinda hot.

1053
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,151
She just, like, pulled that out,
gave it to you?

1054
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:04,317
Yeah. I actually thought
she was gonna shoot me at first,

1055
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:06,725
but then she handed it to me
and said, "As insurance."

1056
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,127
-Insurance? What for?
-I don't know.

1057
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:11,393
Maybe so she wouldn't be tempted to use it.

1058
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,230
-On who?
-Bert, herself, who knows?

1059
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:18,500
I'm gonna put this away because...

1060
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,302
I'm actually beginning
to revise my theory on her mental state.

1061
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:26,212
-Yeah, me, too. She's insane.
-And on the war path.

1062
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:29,375
All right, we should call the cops.

1063
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,450
-And tell them what?
-About the gun, her plan?

1064
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,922
We don't know her plan
and the gun is in my possession.

1065
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,924
I can't exactly slip it back
into her garter belt.

1066
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,428
So, we're stuck.

1067
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,001
What was... What was that for?

1068
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:56,203
Us getting together,

1069
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,337
which was also part of Nikki's plan,

1070
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:00,312
I'm just gonna go with it.

1071
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,683
Are we out of here soon?

1072
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:09,886
Why? Nervous?

1073
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:14,020
Yeah, right.

1074
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:17,630
That died quick.

1075
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:18,792
Sure did.

1076
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,397
If I didn't know any better, Nikki

1077
00:59:26,463 --> 00:59:28,568
I'd say you were up to something,

1078
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:30,703
sitting there like a Cheshire Cat,

1079
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,145
grinning and laughing.

1080
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,944
Don't you know the joke?

1081
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,153
Thejoke?

1082
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,722
The one you had on me?

1083
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:45,749
That you were into jazz,
the Rebops, our whole scene

1084
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:49,628
but really I was just kitschy fun for you?

1085
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,427
That word "kitschy,"

1086
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:54,696
it really gets under your skin,
now doesn't it?

1087
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:59,173
Listen, there's nothing
kitschy about having soul,

1088
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,971
living jazz, rolling to your own groove.

1089
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,348
It's authentic, not like you.

1090
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:11,675
I love it when you get
all I'm-Miles-Davis and Fuck-the-White-Man.

1091
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:12,880
It's cute.

1092
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,584
That wasn't the joke I was thinking of,

1093
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:20,151
but like that one, this one's on you, too.

1094
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,561
Really?

1095
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,491
How about this?

1096
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:30,265
-Your fiancé...
-Here we go.

1097
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,931
...thinks you're a homicidal maniac
on the loose.

1098
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,373
No! no; no,

1099
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,172
-No, I don't.
-Please, Bert.

1100
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,202
The whole time she was in the bathroom,

1101
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:41,374
you were trying to convince Zach and me
that she belongs back in the nut house.

1102
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:44,510
You know, that is
a gross misrepresentation of what I said.

1103
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:47,077
Come on, Bert, she's got you
by the short and curlies.

1104
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:49,617
You know what? You have
no credibility here, okay?

1105
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,181
You're the ex-boyfriend, right?

1106
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,625
I'm not sure I like your friends, sweetheart.

1107
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,131
And I am most positive they don't like me,

1108
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:00,464
so we need to shove off.

1109
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,664
You know the joke.

1110
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,500
I do?

1111
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,042
What joke?

1112
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:15,076
Tonight is not about us
pressuring your old man

1113
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,049
into giving you a wedding date, is it?

1114
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:18,950
No.

1115
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,124
Then what is it about?

1116
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,520
Revenge.

1117
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:35,003
What do you mean revenge, baby?

1118
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,163
I mean fuckers pay.

1119
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:46,075
Damn, I felt that in my spine.

1120
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:55,014
You guys. You guys just missed
Nikki informing Bert and me

1121
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,283
that tonight is about revenge.

1122
01:01:57,948 --> 01:01:59,325
Yeah.

1123
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,021
- We knew that
- What?

1124
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:04,998
-What, you guessed?
-No.

1125
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:07,899
Nikki told me in the bathroom, I told Zach,

1126
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:10,097
and we've been
trying to figure out her intentions.

1127
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,729
You got lipstick on your ear?

1128
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:16,607
We also made out a bit.

1129
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,313
So, what's your hypothesis?

1130
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:24,843
First of all, we believe you.

1131
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:27,984
You're insane.

1132
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:30,418
I was. I'm cured.

1133
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,222
No, you still are.

1134
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:37,027
I'm not a boo-scary homicidal maniac.

1135
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:39,494
I'm sorry, but we think so.

1136
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:41,900
It's sad. I'm sad about it.

1137
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,605
Bert, tell them.

1138
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:48,006
Darling,

1139
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,272
I agree with them.

1140
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:54,644
-You do?
-Afraid so.

1141
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,950
How could you say that?

1142
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,624
Some unspeakable horror

1143
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:08,856
has been brewing inside you
since your release.

1144
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:11,631
Yeah.

1145
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:14,430
And tonight it's come to a head.

1146
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:18,905
You need help, dear.
You're... You're not well.

1147
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:21,369
You wouldn't know.

1148
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,108
I was so complimented
when you guys saw right through

1149
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:29,173
my Slaughterhouse-Five defense,
but now I'm...

1150
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:31,218
I'm disappointed.

1151
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,310
You bought my bullshit.

1152
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,489
Wake up, people.

1153
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,021
We just realized that your bullshit was real.

1154
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,486
You don't make idle threats.

1155
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,326
We're worried about you
and what you might do.

1156
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,957
I'm perfectly sane. I have been always.

1157
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,400
Insanity was just my bogus legal defense.

1158
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:53,800
You know,
I fooled everyone, even you guys.

1159
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:55,642
You're fooling yourself.

1160
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:59,570
Maybe you always were insane,
even way back in high school.

1161
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:02,173
Maybe faking it for court was easy.

1162
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,916
You just had to act natural.

1163
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:09,823
You even had me fooled
in the beginning, but not now.

1164
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:15,227
Yeah. Me and Zach,

1165
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:19,131
we understand your feelings
for wanting revenge.

1166
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,930
-You do?
-Yeah.

1167
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,197
I mean, Bert,

1168
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,501
fucking your client
who's facing life in prison,

1169
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:27,269
that's just a straight-up abuse of power.

1170
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,435
I resent that. I love Nik.

1171
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,012
Back the fuck off.

1172
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,345
You're right.

1173
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,941
He is a good liar.

1174
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,848
Yeah, I really know how to pick 'em.

1175
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,849
And then you got Marvin here,

1176
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,911
who pleads ignorance
about planting that heroin

1177
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,218
and pushing you off the wagon.

1178
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,225
Yo, I thought we quashed that beef.

1179
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:46,488
Maybe.

1180
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:50,793
I mean, we can never know
if that claim is true or not.

1181
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,925
But if Nikki thinks it happened,
you're in jeopardy.

1182
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,663
-Of what?
-Being shot, for one.

1183
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,834
-Nikki's gonna shoot me?
-Who knows?

1184
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,602
She wants revenge.

1185
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:02,501
Don't worry.

1186
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:07,474
I thought about it, fantasized, but no.

1187
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:12,247
And then there's me.

1188
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:14,749
I broke up with Nikki.

1189
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,551
It was five years ago,
but she can hold a grudge

1190
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:20,493
longer than the half-life of uranium.

1191
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,789
10 million years.

1192
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:27,028
That's good enough
motivation to knock me off.

1193
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,264
I betrayed you. I left you.

1194
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:35,099
But our quandary, the question of Zach.

1195
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:36,933
Yeah.

1196
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,072
We couldn't figure out
why you'd want revenge on me.

1197
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,275
If you were to, say, whip out a pistol

1198
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,341
and shoot everyone at this table, why me?

1199
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,081
What did I ever do to you
that was so awful?

1200
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:52,092
I'm sorry. What's with all the chit-chat
about people getting shot?

1201
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,991
-It's a hypothetical.
-Yeah.

1202
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:00,663
We thought if Nikki was to go homicidal,
how would she do it?

1203
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:01,998
What method would she use?

1204
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,595
Right, and my theory
was shooting rampage.

1205
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:06,265
But we moved off that because

1206
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,037
once the first person got shot,
everyone would dive for cover.

1207
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:10,441
She'd be lucky to get two of us.

1208
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,002
And then there's reloading, so...

1209
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:13,938
I'd need a machine gun.

1210
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,539
Then we thought she gathered us all

1211
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,913
because she wanted to kill herself.

1212
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,510
- She's very theatrical
- We moved off that.

1213
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:23,684
Nikki might joke about suicide,
but she would never commit it.

1214
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:26,452
She loves life too much.

1215
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,792
Her mantra in rehab was...

1216
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:30,695
"Kurt Cobain was a pussy."

1217
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,366
It's true, he was.

1218
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,697
Dave Grohl made Nirvana.

1219
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,738
Let me get this straight, you two froot loops
were making out in the bathroom

1220
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,069
and just dreaming up these scenarios?

1221
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,438
Yeah.

1222
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,579
And I thought Nik was psychotic.

1223
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:47,512
Stop calling me Nik, motherfucker!

1224
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,775
What?

1225
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,318
I can take psychotic from you,

1226
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:57,654
but not Nik, not anymore.

1227
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,328
I never knew Nik bothered you.

1228
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,730
It makes me wanna
scratch your face off with my fingernails.

1229
01:07:06,156 --> 01:07:07,931
I'm sorry.

1230
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,833
You never said anything.

1231
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:13,374
So, Nikki.

1232
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,577
-Nikki?
-Yeah?

1233
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:20,176
How are you going to take revenge?
And on who?

1234
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:25,086
I mean, let's see.

1235
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:29,247
If I wanted to kill all of you at once,

1236
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:32,657
a curious proposition, the way to go,

1237
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:35,094
my method... Let's see.

1238
01:07:35,986 --> 01:07:38,728
Would be a modified Jim Jones.

1239
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,392
I'd poison all your cocktails.

1240
01:07:40,457 --> 01:07:41,629
-Drinks?
-Sprite.

1241
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:42,692
Anybody else?

1242
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,863
-I'm okay.
-No, no.

1243
01:07:44,928 --> 01:07:48,137
No. Just the check, please.

1244
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,812
You'd poison our cocktails?

1245
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:55,213
Well, yeah. I mean, why not?

1246
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,217
I'm practically an expert.

1247
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,879
I killed Mark Von Douchebag
with a quarter gram

1248
01:07:59,943 --> 01:08:03,413
of super-concentrated, tasteless, odorless
arsenic I brewed up myself.

1249
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:04,752
Wait a second.

1250
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:05,986
I never heard you say that before.

1251
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,084
You always insisted that...

1252
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:09,889
You couldn't remember.

1253
01:08:09,953 --> 01:08:11,432
You brewed it yourself?

1254
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:12,864
<i>Yeah. It was easy.</i>

1255
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,492
<i>I found the recipe on the Internet.</i>

1256
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,862
<i>I distilled four big boxes ofrat poison</i>

1257
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,769
<i>down to just one cup</i>

1258
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:20,932
<i>ofpure, potent,</i>

1259
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:22,734
<i>toxic bliss.</i>

1260
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,909
It brought me back to
AP chemistry, which I aced.

1261
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:31,111
But that class with Mr. Plunk, the guy with
the mustache... You remember that?

1262
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,583
I do. She got an A.

1263
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:37,954
All that homework paid off.

1264
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:41,454
Mark dropped dead inside 72 minutes.

1265
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,626
You timed it?

1266
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:45,594
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

1267
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,791
<i>-I watched...</i>
-Fuck.

1268
01:08:48,925 --> 01:08:51,929
<i>...him breathe his last breath.</i>

1269
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:55,767
It was beautiful.

1270
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:05,250
Are you saying you slipped us a mickey

1271
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:09,154
when you brought those drinks
or in the champagne?

1272
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:11,590
Take your pick. I cou|d've done it either way

1273
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:13,594
if I wanted to kill all of you.

1274
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,061
That was the question.

1275
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:17,925
-Do you?
-No.

1276
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,399
-Some of us?
-No.

1277
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:24,404
-Any of us?
-Relax. It's just a parlor game.

1278
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,734
I hope so.

1279
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,034
Is it?

1280
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,637
What?

1281
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,875
Me? Why?

1282
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,076
Relax, Zach. No reason to poison you.

1283
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:38,619
-You're already dead.
-I am?

1284
01:09:38,808 --> 01:09:40,981
Practically, yes.

1285
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:44,524
You have a meaningless job
you hate that sucks the joy out of your life.

1286
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:46,685
You eat at home, alone, every night.

1287
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,854
You buy tons of toys
and crap you don't need

1288
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,398
to make you happy, but you're miserable.

1289
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:54,191
Aside from 15 minutes ago,
I bet you haven't kissed a girl in months.

1290
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:56,737
Your existence is blah.

1291
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:58,828
You've lost your mojo.

1292
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:01,102
-Zach had mojo?
-Fuckloads.

1293
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:04,777
I did. In high school.

1294
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,209
How do you know
any of this stuff about me?

1295
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:11,252
I haven't even seen you in a decade.

1296
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:14,748
-I've been spying on you.
-You have?

1297
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:17,925
How long?

1298
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:21,361
Four months.

1299
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:23,397
You've only been out for four months.

1300
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,824
Bingo!

1301
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:27,425
I've been planning tonight
since before I got out.

1302
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,227
I'm gonna tell you guys an embarrassing

1303
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:33,638
and revealing story
about me involving Zach.

1304
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,207
I've never told this to anyone except Zach.

1305
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:40,373
We got together when we were 15.

1306
01:10:40,437 --> 01:10:42,212
Zach was a virgin, I wasn't.

1307
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:45,043
Nikki, stop. You don't have to go there.

1308
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:47,385
I was molested.

1309
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,320
I suspected something like that.

1310
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:51,950
And not just once either.

1311
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:56,094
<i>There was an uncle, my third grade teacher,</i>

1312
01:10:56,152 --> 01:10:58,154
<i>my soccer coach,</i>

1313
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,598
<i>my mom's boyfriend.</i>

1314
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:04,203
That's enough to drive you insane,
right there.

1315
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,670
I felt like I was up for grabs.

1316
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:12,475
Like my body wasn't mine.

1317
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:15,407
My own skin...

1318
01:11:16,373 --> 01:11:18,182
Repulsed me.

1319
01:11:21,478 --> 01:11:24,220
And then I met this cool guy, Zach.

1320
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,283
We have lots of classes together

1321
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,261
because we're both genius freshmen.

1322
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:31,389
We worshipped the same obscure bands,

1323
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,331
and so we started going on dates.

1324
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,467
<i>And Zach was...</i>

1325
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,834
<i>a perfect gentleman.</i>

1326
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:43,708
<i>You know, I made up
these rules for what I was comfortable with</i>

1327
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,474
<i>for when we were kissing, and his hands...</i>

1328
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,311
<i>they never strayed.</i>

1329
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:52,345
<i>And so I knew at the end of ourjunior year</i>

1330
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,251
<i>that I wanted to pop his cherry</i>

1331
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,614
like a big, juicy bug-

1332
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:01,555
<i>She just asked me one day out of the blue</i>

1333
01:12:01,618 --> 01:12:03,291
<i>Blew my mind.</i>

1334
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:04,730
Okay.

1335
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,828
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1336
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,461
-Yeah, yeah.
-All right. Bye.

1337
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:11,999
Bye.

1338
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:14,306
<i>It was a disaster.</i>

1339
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,678
The minute we get down
to doing the dirty deed,

1340
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:22,342
I feel this, like, intense, sharp
pain through my entire body

1341
01:12:22,405 --> 01:12:25,352
and it cripples me and I can't stop crying.

1342
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:29,479
Virgin idiot methinks
I screwed up the condom

1343
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,048
or something... Hurt you.

1344
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,257
That's horrible.

1345
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:38,428
It took me a whole month
to get the courage to ask Zach to try again.

1346
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:41,491
The second time was even worse.

1347
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:44,629
Fuck!

1348
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,899
<i>She pulled a Mike Tyson right on my nipple.</i>

1349
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:52,770
We tried two more times,
but the pain was still there.

1350
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:56,543
I kept freaking out.

1351
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,414
But Zach never left.

1352
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:05,754
He never ran away. He just...

1353
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:11,527
Let me chew his ear off
about the most depraved,

1354
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:14,227
sickening things you can imagine.

1355
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,763
And eventually, on our fifth attempt,

1356
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,332
we worked.

1357
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,940
<i>I was over my phobia.</i>

1358
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,217
<i>And then it got really...</i>

1359
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:35,044
Good, nice.

1360
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:38,659
And Zach man found a groove.

1361
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:41,421
Actually kind of charming.

1362
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,765
You stood by her, Zach.

1363
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,492
You're the hero.

1364
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:50,595
Yeah, 10 months later, she dumped my ass.

1365
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:53,937
That's the point of the whole story, Zach.

1366
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,066
You got boring.

1367
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,475
I know. I know I did.

1368
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,777
It would kill me to talk on the phone
with you when you were at college,

1369
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:04,250
just babbling on about
your business classes

1370
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:06,412
and the stock market and Donald Trump

1371
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:08,683
and your newfound appreciation
for advertising.

1372
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,258
-It was pathetic.
-You just matured.

1373
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:12,793
You knew you had to go out and find a job.

1374
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:14,486
I did the same thing when I was that age.

1375
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,595
No.

1376
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,797
Nikki's right.

1377
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,528
I used to draw and paint, write poetry.

1378
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:27,998
I loved music, movies, books, art.

1379
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:31,603
I haven't enjoyed any of that stuff in years.

1380
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,375
I haven't even bought a CD in years

1381
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,110
and I used to buy three a week, and that was
when I had no job and no money.

1382
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:44,789
So, I was sitting in my hospital cell

1383
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:48,226
and I was stewing about the cruel universe

1384
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:51,493
<i>and all the people
who had double-crossed me</i>

1385
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:54,501
<i>and cheated me and lied to and abused me.</i>

1386
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:58,561
<i>And then I thought of you, Zach</i>

1387
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,867
The one authentic good guy in my life

1388
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:07,743
who let his own life slip away.

1389
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,447
And so I decided

1390
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:15,785
as soon as I got out,
I would host a partyjust for you.

1391
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:19,418
Tonight's about me?

1392
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,153
Yeah.

1393
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:23,561
It's another of my genius orchestrations,

1394
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:27,192
designed to snap you back, jolt you,

1395
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:30,100
reawaken your sense of being alive.

1396
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:34,468
I mean, mission accomplished.

1397
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:38,538
So is that... ls that it?

1398
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:40,239
Are we done?

1399
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,808
No, I'm just getting started.

1400
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,113
I understand the sad story.

1401
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:46,983
You're not gonna poison Zach, okay?

1402
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:50,889
But what about the rest of us?

1403
01:15:51,447 --> 01:15:54,189
Why? Do you feel strange?

1404
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,694
Why do you always
answer a question with another question?

1405
01:15:58,321 --> 01:15:59,322
It's annoying.

1406
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,460
Because it makes the puzzle
expand exponentially.

1407
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:03,765
I learned that from Socrates.

1408
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:05,770
She's not gonna poison anybody.

1409
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:09,207
Not here, not now
in a public place with all these witnesses.

1410
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,475
Right.

1411
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,707
because I'm afraid of making a scene, Bert.

1412
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,847
Just tell them, Nikki.

1413
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,054
Tell me.

1414
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:30,486
I would never harm you, Miranda.

1415
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:34,391
You gave me the courage to believe in
myself when I needed it the most.

1416
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:37,000
Without your amazing, beautiful love,

1417
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,970
I would just be another dead junkie.

1418
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,631
So, relax.

1419
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,137
Enjoy the show.

1420
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:49,182
It's us, man.

1421
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:56,322
It's nobody.

1422
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:58,384
She's just getting her rocks off.

1423
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:03,158
You said it yourself, she's been smiling
at us all night like some Cheshire Cat.

1424
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:06,330
Something ain't right.

1425
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:09,659
Where is that check?

1426
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,000
Look at you two.

1427
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:15,042
It's mass hysteria up in here.

1428
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,677
I got a headache from all your shenanigans.

1429
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:23,774
What kind of headache?
Like a really scary, bad migraine?

1430
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,644
No. I'm annoyed.

1431
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:28,288
You need help, Nik.

1432
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,221
Nikki. Come on, let's go.

1433
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,485
Jump in the GTO. We can talk about this.

1434
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:34,494
Why are you so concerned with headaches?

1435
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,496
It's a symptom of arsenic poisoning.

1436
01:17:36,552 --> 01:17:38,361
I'm a nurse. I've seen it a couple times.

1437
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:39,559
You're a nurse?

1438
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:41,693
-Yeah.
-Miranda's grace under pressure.

1439
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:43,202
She thrives on intensity.

1440
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:46,067
<i>She saved me twice when I OD'd.</i>

1441
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:52,978
To hell with this waitress.

1442
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:55,072
That'll take care of the champagne.

1443
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,209
I've had enough of your
scheming nonsense, okay?

1444
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:00,515
Trying to convince us all
that you poisoned our drinks,

1445
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:02,578
that's no joke, okay?

1446
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:04,886
That's insanity. You need help.

1447
01:18:05,648 --> 01:18:07,321
Professional psychiatric help.

1448
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:09,124
I'd go back any time.

1449
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:12,961
The shrinks at that
last health spa were so handsome.

1450
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:15,903
Shit.

1451
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:19,800
Shit.

1452
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:24,935
I got way beyond a headache.

1453
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:27,237
ls he acting?

1454
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,672
Am I?

1455
01:18:30,473 --> 01:18:32,350
"Do my kisses burn?"

1456
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:34,449
What?

1457
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:39,052
"Do they take your breath?
You've got a lesson to learn

1458
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:41,095
-"I'm the kiss of death"
- Holy shit.

1459
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:45,699
Damn.

1460
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:48,198
I'm f|yil19-

1461
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:49,861
"Kiss of death."

1462
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:51,735
Come on. What the fuck is that?

1463
01:18:51,794 --> 01:18:54,206
It's a song from the Thrill Kill Kult.

1464
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:58,537
-What is this?
-"Eye of newt and toe of frog,

1465
01:18:58,601 --> 01:19:00,137
Wool of bat and

1466
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:02,944
I mean, however the rest of the brew goes.

1467
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:04,642
Another bullshit song?

1468
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,651
It's the witches from Macbeth.

1469
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,483
Another band I've never heard of.

1470
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:13,048
-Shakespeare.
-Right. I knew you were acting.

1471
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:18,226
This revenge
for your delusional beef with me...

1472
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:20,130
I am perfectly sane.

1473
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:21,668
No, you're not.

1474
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:31,669
You're a poor girl who got abused,
sick and twisted and never healed.

1475
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:34,679
Yeah, that's true. I'll give you that one, too.

1476
01:19:34,737 --> 01:19:37,684
This guy is good, a real pro.

1477
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:42,414
Sixty-nine minutes, how erotic.

1478
01:19:42,478 --> 01:19:44,480
Really? You poisoned him?

1479
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:47,785
Come on. Please. He's faking.

1480
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,464
Did you check his ID when
he came in like you did me?

1481
01:19:51,687 --> 01:19:53,462
Could've been you, Zach.

1482
01:19:54,423 --> 01:19:56,027
Lost soul.

1483
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,836
I almost put you out of your misery,

1484
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:01,374
but I had second thoughts.

1485
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:03,742
I saved you.

1486
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:05,709
Do you love me for that?

1487
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:07,641
I'm sorry.

1488
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:09,581
For what?

1489
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,642
I planted the badness.

1490
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:15,518
Fuck.

1491
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:16,885
You did, Marvin?

1492
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,360
Did...

1493
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:44,214
<i>I loved us</i>

1494
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,386
I really did.

1495
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:56,763
I forgive you.

1496
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,991
Marvin?

1497
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:01,091
Marvin? Marvin?

1498
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,464
Wake up.

1499
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:05,596
Marvin. Marvin, wake up.

1500
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:08,841
-Can you hear me?
-You poisoned him?

1501
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:13,175
What do we tell the judge and jury this time?

1502
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:16,875
Did you poison me?

1503
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:23,679
<i>Thanks for getting back to me.</i>

1504
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:26,623
<i>-Is she there?
-No, no, no. She's out fora run.</i>

1505
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:29,162
<i>You</i> are a piece <i>of work,</i>
a <i>hot</i> piece <i>of ass like that</i>

1506
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:30,993
<i>and you wanna send her back
to the institution?</i>

1507
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:32,464
<i>She's not who I thought she was</i>

1508
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:34,057
<i>Look, I'm never gonna marry this chick.</i>

1509
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:36,262
<i>-I don't love her.
-So break up with her.</i>

1510
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:39,568
<i>I can't! Look, just say she had a relapse,</i>

1511
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:42,302
<i>say you made a mistake.
Just put her back in.</i>

1512
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,071
<i>I'll double the money I paid you.</i>

1513
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:45,806
<i>Counselor, that was a one-time deal.</i>

1514
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:49,713
<i>As much as I enjoyed her company,
I suggest you sack up and dump her ass</i>

1515
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:52,116
<i>-Don't call me again.
-No, no, no. Listen, listen.</i>

1516
01:21:52,308 --> 01:21:53,719
<i>Damn it.</i>

1517
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:07,567
Why? Do you think you deserve it?

1518
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:10,802
No more of your riddles
I want answers now!

1519
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:14,503
No, I didn't.

1520
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,076
No?

1521
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,735
I didn't poison you.

1522
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,009
Hello. Emergency. We need an ambulance.

1523
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:22,548
We're popular.

1524
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:24,845
I have a pulse. It's weak, but it's there.

1525
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,412
What now?

1526
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:28,477
-I run.
-You flee?

1527
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:31,456
ls that your brilliant master plan?

1528
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,186
Only there's a denouement.

1529
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,922
I keep tabs on you, see you lose your job

1530
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:38,965
your law license,
see the doctors at the hospital sell you out,

1531
01:22:39,021 --> 01:22:41,831
maybe even see you go to
jail for fraud and bribery.

1532
01:22:42,224 --> 01:22:45,364
Never put incriminating shit
in a drawer with a crappy lock, Bert.

1533
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,533
Otherwise, your law partners may
get copies of canceled checks.

1534
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,474
You wouldn't do that,

1535
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:52,137
expose yourself.

1536
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:55,774
They'd put you away
in that asylum for good.

1537
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:57,943
I'll be gone.

1538
01:22:58,007 --> 01:23:00,385
I've had months to plan.

1539
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,478
They'll never find me.

1540
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:04,183
But you...

1541
01:23:11,787 --> 01:23:13,562
Get off her!

1542
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:16,569
Man, stop, stop! Get off her, man!

1543
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:18,233
Stop it!

1544
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,826
-Are you okay?
-Oh, my God.

1545
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:42,692
Yeah, I'm fine.

1546
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,560
That was close.

1547
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:46,997
-But thanks.
-Insurance.

1548
01:23:47,056 --> 01:23:48,194
Against Bert.

1549
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:51,196
Yeah.

1550
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,331
No, no. I am not giving you this gun.

1551
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:55,898
Are you kidding me?
You just freaking murdered Marvin!

1552
01:23:55,965 --> 01:23:57,171
Marvin isn't dead.

1553
01:23:57,233 --> 01:23:59,611
I just whacked him out
on rohypnol and ketamine.

1554
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:02,512
-He's in a k-hole?
-Deep in it.

1555
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:04,448
Tell the EMTs. They'll know what to do.

1556
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,953
And seriously, you do not want that
skanky gun on you when the cops show up.

1557
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,011
I bought it off a crackhead.

1558
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:11,115
I don't know how many bodies
are on that thing.

1559
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,291
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1560
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,106
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

1561
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:33,671
You guys.

1562
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:37,707
This guy's dead.

1563
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:08,814
Rise and shine.

1564
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,111
I was waiting...

1565
01:25:14,176 --> 01:25:16,452
I was waiting to see if I could bail you out.

1566
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:18,924
Chivalrous. Thank you, but no need.

1567
01:25:18,981 --> 01:25:20,483
They let me go.

1568
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:22,425
They called it assault in defense of another.

1569
01:25:22,885 --> 01:25:25,866
-That's a relief.
-Yeah.

1570
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:29,368
Did the detectives
say anything about Marvin or Bert?

1571
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,335
Yes. Can we get out of here?

1572
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,337
-Okay?
-Yes.

1573
01:25:33,429 --> 01:25:35,602
-Yeah.
-Marvin's gonna be fine.

1574
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:37,769
The doctors said he'll be high
for another day or two.

1575
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:40,147
I guess Nikki taught him.

1576
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:42,478
She taught Bert worse.

1577
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:44,312
He'll live, but legally he's a mess.

1578
01:25:44,406 --> 01:25:46,249
The three guys from the bar
are pressing assault charges

1579
01:25:46,342 --> 01:25:48,049
and he attacked the cops that arrested him.

1580
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,979
So much for his legal career.

1581
01:25:51,046 --> 01:25:53,185
Nikki said she wanted his balls burning.

1582
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:54,818
They are sizzling.

1583
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:57,295
Do you think that Nikki's really crazy

1584
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,127
or do you think she's just faking for effect?

1585
01:25:59,355 --> 01:26:01,426
Honestly, I think Nikki's beyond sanity.

1586
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:03,032
I mean, she pulled last night off.

1587
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:06,231
That took rational, sane,
but totally insane planning.

1588
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:07,671
Yeah.

1589
01:26:08,864 --> 01:26:10,070
This is my ride.

1590
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,139
Sweet bumper sticker.

1591
01:26:14,203 --> 01:26:17,150
-How do you feel about tacos?
-For breakfast?

1592
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:19,884
Yeah. I know this hole in the wall.

1593
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:22,115
Nikki and I used to go there after shows.

1594
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:25,850
I figured since we just witnessed one of
her genius orchestrations...

1595
01:26:28,217 --> 01:26:30,322
I like tacos.

1596
01:26:30,347 --> 01:26:32,347
