1
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,430
-Ugh, after two years.

2
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,650
I'm so sorry, Felicity.

3
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,870
-Unemployed and bankrupt
at Christmas.

4
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,000
I feel sick.

5
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,920
-You gave it your best.
Chicago's a big, hard city.

6
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,400
-A failed artist,
a failed wedding,

7
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,660
and now a failed baker.

8
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,790
It's so sad I could laugh,
but I just end up crying.

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,490
-Hang in there, Felicity.

10
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,360
We all believe in you
up here in Wisconsin.

11
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,850
-You all are way too happy.

12
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,240
-Mm, well, only room for one
moody artist in this family.

13
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,020
-How's she doing?

14
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,940
-I think she misses her aunt.

15
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,250
-That's nice of you to say.

16
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,210
I can't eat this. Here, Ginger.

17
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,250
And I just maxed out another
credit card on comfort food.

18
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,040
-Do not get another
credit card.

19
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,040
-Well, what am I gonna do,
Grace?

20
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,690
-Mom and Dad
would love to have you.

21
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,690
-No way.

22
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,910
-I mean, I do admit their
empty-nest honeymoon phase

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,260
has gotten worse.

24
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,610
-Much worse.
-You wouldn't have to pay rent.

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,050
Aspen Grove at Christmas?

26
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,660
I don't think
I could stomach it.

27
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,190
-What are you saying?

28
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,320
There is no better place
to be this time of year.

29
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,240
-I honestly don't even think
I like Christmas anymore.

30
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,850
-Okay, now you've
crossed a line.

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,110
You have always loved Christmas.

32
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,720
-Well, things change.

33
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,460
These last years
have been tough.

34
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,900
I'm now a Grinch.

35
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,950
-Don!

36
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,560
Don!

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,210
You could work at Don's office.

38
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,950
The front-desk assistant girl,
uh...

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,690
-Lily.

40
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,260
-Lily is going to Prague
for a month with her school.

41
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,780
I think.

42
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,660
-Grace, I cannot work
at your husband's office

43
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,090
like a teenager.

44
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,790
-Lily is not a teenager,

45
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,490
and you'd be doing
Don a big favor.

46
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,580
-She's 19, so technically
she's a teenage...

47
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,580
Huge. Big deal.

48
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,710
Very helpful.

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,370
-Maybe...

50
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,800
-Never mind.
-Maybe what?

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,200
-Maybe I should call Brian.

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,900
-Are you hearing yourself?
You called off the wedding.

53
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,680
I went with you when you tried
to get a refund

54
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,380
on your wedding dress.

55
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,300
I sat with you while you cried
when they said no.

56
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,430
-He was my best friend.

57
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,960
I mean, you are, too,
but you know what I mean.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,570
-You're spiraling.

59
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,090
Come home. Work at Don's
office for a month.

60
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,050
Make some money.

61
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,090
Get back to Chicago
after Christmas.

62
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,620
-Bah, humbug.

63
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,360
-Speak for yourself, honey.
What choice do you have?

64
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,840
-One-month office job?
That's it?

65
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,970
-One month.

66
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,370
For Christmas!

67
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,980
-For Christmas.

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,720
-Mm-hmm.

69
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,360
-What are we doing here?

70
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,850
-Huh.

71
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,490
Come on, Ginger Snap.

72
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,840
-Sweetie!
-Welcome home!

73
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,840
-Oh!

74
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,150
-Okay. I can't breathe.

75
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,070
-How was the drive?
Are you hungry?

76
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,020
Thirsty?
-Let's get you some eggnog.

77
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,720
-No. Mom, Dad,
let's get one thing straight.

78
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,470
I just want to work
and make plans to start over.

79
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,770
I appreciate you letting me
stay, and I love you.

80
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,300
But I want as little Christmas
as humanly possible.

81
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,830
-Oh, sweetheart, you've got...

82
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,350
-Oh. Mm.

83
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,530
-Well, I'll just
have to help you.

84
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,970
I wish you would.

85
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,100
-Felicity!

86
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,890
Oh!

87
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,800
-I'm glad you're back.

88
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,370
-I'm not so sure I am.
-It's a good thing.

89
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,940
Just in time
for a Christmas miracle.

90
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,110
I know. I'm kidding.

91
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,900
No holiday magic allowed.

92
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,950
-Aunt Felicity!

93
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,780
-Maddie, look at you!
You're so grown-up now.

94
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,340
-Really?

95
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,300
-We are heading
to the farmers' market.

96
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,690
Do you want to come?
Or are we still in a mood?

97
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,350
-I can be in a mood and still go
to the farmers' market.

98
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,530
-That's the most she's talked
to anyone in weeks.

99
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,140
-I feel like I get along well
with sullen teenagers.

100
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,570
I can't imagine why.

101
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,150
-Ha, ha, ha, ha!

102
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,200
-So, Maddie's all grown-up.

103
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,950
When did that happen?
-Ugh, overnight.

104
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,470
She is just like you.
-Well, isn't she lucky?

105
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,260
I remember when I wanted
to move to Chicago and paint.

106
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,960
Take on the world.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,610
-Well, didn't you?

108
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,970
-This has been a blast.

109
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,840
I'm gonna go grab a coffee
and sit in the car.

110
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,580
-Absolutely not.

111
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,670
You need fresh air
and small-town festivities.

112
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,230
And Maddie loves
Christmas in Aspen Grove.

113
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,540
Don't you?

114
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,980
Yeah, she tries to play it cool.

115
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,850
-I like Christmas...

116
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,810
cookies.

117
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,810
-That is exactly what we need.

118
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,290
-Yeah, but why do they have to
be Christmas cookies?

119
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,810
Couldn't they just be cookies

120
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,430
or cookies you eat
during the winter season?

121
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,340
-Let's go and leave
Lady Scrooge ...

122
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,610
or was it Lady Grinch?

123
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,950
-Both.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,830
-To figure out Christmas
on her own.

125
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,040
-Hi, you!

126
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,430
Oh!

127
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,520
Who put this monstrosity on you?

128
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,390
We're done with Christmas.

129
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,130
-Done with Christmas?

130
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,220
We're just getting started.

131
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,830
-Excuse me, that was
a private conversation.

132
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,140
-With Pumpkin?

133
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,400
He's being oppressed
by Christmas.

134
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,840
-Oppressed?

135
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,060
It's the best time of year.

136
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,150
Come on, have some cocoa.
It's on the house.

137
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,590
Well, it's on the farm.

138
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,110
-Excuse me.

139
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,720
What are you doing
with my Pumpkin?

140
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,860
-Oh, nothing.
Sorry.

141
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,330
-Pumpkin, come here.

142
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,300
-Tried to tell her.

143
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,690
-I couldn't be mad at you,
though, could I, James?

144
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,690
-Right.
Well, sorry again.

145
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,610
-Don't you want your cocoa?
It's the season and all that.

146
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,350
-Yeah, it's not really
my season.

147
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,050
Not this year, anyways.

148
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,050
-I don't believe it.

149
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,570
-Don't believe what?

150
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,140
-You're Felicity Olson.

151
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,100
-Caitlin Rogers?

152
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,930
-So you're back in town?
-Um, just visiting.

153
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,710
I don't think I've seen you
since you and Grace

154
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,500
graduated high school.

155
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,930
Uh, how have you been?

156
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,680
-Fantastic.

157
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,290
I'm town chairwoman,
which means that I'm responsible

158
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,680
for making sure
that all of this runs smoothly.

159
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,820
Grace told me about the wedding.
What a shame.

160
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,340
-Caitlin, you would know.

161
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,300
Where is Mrs. Rockwell's
cookie stand?

162
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,560
-Oh, you haven't heard.
Mrs. Rockwell retired.

163
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,950
She lives in Florida now.

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,560
-Seriously?
-Oh!

165
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,960
-She fell in love
with Arnold Hollingsworth.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,830
One day, he started
sitting in the window seat

167
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,180
at the coffee shop.
-Which was Mrs. Rockwell's seat.

168
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,140
So she started sitting with him,
and they fell in love.

169
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,360
-Oh, that is so romantic.
-So lame.

170
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,710
-It's true.

171
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,540
-Boca Raton is lucky.

172
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,370
No more Mrs. Rockwell's
Christmas cookies for us.

173
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,200
-Sound the alarm.

174
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,420
Just a bit of holiday humor,

175
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,810
-Felicity, I understand

176
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,160
that this may not be important
to someone like you,

177
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,080
but in a small town,
tradition matters.

178
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,600
Now if you'll excuse me,
I see a pair of wooden angels

179
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,950
that are about to go up
in flames

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,740
next to that candle display.

181
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,390
-Caitlin saves the day.

182
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,220
-James, talk soon
about the Snow Ball.

183
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,440
-Christmas cookies.
-No.

184
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,620
No. I'm in mourning.

185
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,360
-My sister's a baker.
-Was a baker.

186
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,840
-You could save Christmas.

187
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,620
-People can bake
their own cookies.

188
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,670
-Yes, but what about
all the town events

189
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,410
and the hardworking folks who
don't have time to bake and ...

190
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,500
and who want something
to bring to parties,

191
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,280
to school, to ... to church?

192
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,590
Maddie!

193
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,980
-Um, cinnamon rolls.

194
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,200
Bûche de Noel?

195
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,640
-It's a golden opportunity here.

196
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,820
-Okay, I've decided I'm leaving.
Goodbye.

197
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,470
It was nice to meet you.
-Please excuse my sister.

198
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,910
She is not in
the Christmas spirit yet.

199
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,610
-Ooh, it is a quick transition
after Thanksgiving.

200
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,650
-Yeah, maybe that's it.

201
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,830
-Felicity, this is James.

202
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,530
James was varsity quarterback.
He was a bit of a star.

203
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,010
-I don't think I knew
what a football was back then.

204
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,660
-Oh, it's a brown ball,
sort of spheroid.

205
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,450
-Oh, I thought that was
the baseball.

206
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,450
-Uh, two cocoas.

207
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,970
None for Felicity.

208
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,670
-Felicity, your name means
happiness, right?

209
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,110
-Oh, also joy, cheer, delight.

210
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,110
Everything my sister embodies.
-Ha.

211
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,120
-Well, lots of felicity
around the holiday

212
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,120
could be a good thing.

213
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,640
-Oh, can I get a quart of milk
and three pounds of butter?

214
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,470
-Three pounds?
-It's Christmas.

215
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,040
Time to bake cookies to eat
during the "winter season."

216
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,350
-I see what you did there,
Grace.

217
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,870
-All right. Later, Maddie.

218
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,570
Nice to meet you, Felicity.

219
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,580
-What is wrong with this town?

220
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,800
It's like everyone's
under a spell.

221
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
-You'll be under it, too,
soon enough.

222
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,060
-I'll be back in Chicago
soon enough.

223
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,070
-Wanna bet?

224
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,560
-So, after we log in,

225
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,780
we have to access the
patient-records library.

226
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,910
To do this, we click...

227
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,270
...the PDF and...

228
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,670
drag it over...

229
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,760
to the patient's name.

230
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,370
And let's see, where is it?

231
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,590
-I've got it.

232
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,760
-I tend to do all of my inputs
after lunch.

233
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,900
Oh, did you put your name
on your lunch?

234
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,510
-No, I didn't.

235
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,290
I guess I assumed
that sandwich in the fridge

236
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,080
was just named Susan.

237
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,740
Sorry, that was a bad joke.

238
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,310
I'll just go write my name
on my food.

239
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,880
That is too funny.

240
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,230
A sandwich named Susan.

241
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,020
-Yeah, I thought it was weird,
you guys all naming

242
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,450
your food like that,
but you know,

243
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,410
every office has its quirks.

244
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,200
-If you knew Susan,
you'd know why what you said

245
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,590
is so funny.

246
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,860
-Can't wait to meet her.

247
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,210
-Oh! Oh, a salad...

248
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,170
A salad named Jamal.

249
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,610
A soup named Benjamin.

250
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,780
-Okay, so that PDF
that you were talking about ...

251
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,050
-A smoothie named Ken.

252
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,660
-You laugh, but that joke
went on for eight hours.

253
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,450
-Hey, beggars can't be choosers.

254
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,280
-Okay, I am grateful
for the job.

255
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,450
I can just see myself
going insane.

256
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,590
-Did Felicity tell you what a
smashing success she was today?

257
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,890
A burrito named Don.

258
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,240
Oh, a new classic.

259
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,250
Ready for movie night?
-Yep.

260
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,730
See you in there.

261
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,180
-We're watching
"It's a Wonderful Life."

262
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,140
You're baking.
-Mom's shortbread recipe.

263
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,660
Whoops.

264
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,750
-That's the best whoops
I've ever heard.

265
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,490
Does this mean ...
-Hey, hey. What's the hold-up?

266
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,880
Oh, Christmas cookies. Nice.

267
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,100
May I?

268
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,710
-Mmm!
-Oh, my.

269
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,500
They just melt in our ...

270
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,500
-Salty but buttery.
-Yet sweet.

271
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,110
This is the best...
-Christmas cookie I've ever had.

272
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,730
-I mean, I knew you were good,
but these are insane.

273
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,510
Who are you?

274
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,290
-She's the new Mrs. Rockwell.

275
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,900
-What does that mean?

276
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,510
-It means, Don...

277
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,600
I quit.

278
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,130
-And I have the perfect gig
for you to get started.

279
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,780
We're talking high-profile.

280
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,440
-Cocoa delivery.
Am I late?

281
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,790
Hey, Maddie.
-Made it just in time.

282
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,920
Sugarplum fairies
are about to wrap it up.

283
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,350
-Good.

284
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,660
Had to finish up
a few things at the farm.

285
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,660
-Oh, I forgot, everyone here
is on Aspen Grove Time.

286
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,840
-Sure looks like you
found your holiday spirit.

287
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,020
-Well, there is an opening
in the marketplace.

288
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,580
I'm making money.
I'm thrilled.

289
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,800
Ho, ho, ho, et cetera.

290
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,460
-That's very Christmassy of you.

291
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,850
-What's more Christmassy
than rampant consumerism

292
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,030
wrapped in a warm blanket
of butter and sugar?

293
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,340
-So there is no room
for Christmas magic.

294
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,770
You are just all business.

295
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,690
-You say that like
it's a bad thing.

296
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,340
-I mean, it's a little...

297
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,650
Never mind.

298
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,820
-It's what?

299
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,740
-It's a little...

300
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,780
cynical.

301
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,260
And maybe that's a strong word,
but it's ...

302
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,920
-It's realistic.

303
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,400
If that's being cynical,
then so be it.

304
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,790
But I plan to do very well
this season.

305
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,450
I have to.

306
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,680
-So, how'd the butter
work out for you?

307
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,110
-Fine.

308
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,420
-Best butter in the state.

309
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,810
Looks like it inspired you.

310
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,820
-I inspire myself.

311
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,600
-Then you won't mind
if I try one?

312
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,430
-Those are for sale.

313
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,040
Besides, I thought
you were Mr. Humble

314
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,870
Christmas-Loving Farmer Man.

315
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,650
-Okay, what is wrong
with loving Christmas?

316
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,270
-Nothing.

317
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,530
It's very innocent
and small-town.

318
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,530
It's sweet.

319
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,270
-It's innocent because nobody
in Chicago loves Christmas.

320
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,710
Everybody's too busy being...

321
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,150
chic.

322
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,670
-Are you calling me chic?

323
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,060
Chic and cynical?

324
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,980
Wow, I sound very French.

325
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,370
Thank goodness
I left Aspen Grove.

326
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,550
-Hey, this is my town,
and it's your town, too.

327
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,330
-Please.

328
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,600
I wouldn't live here again
if somebody paid me to.

329
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,690
-Isn't that exactly
what's happening here?

330
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,290
-So, how did everybody do?

331
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,420
-Sold out.
-Oh, that's too bad.

332
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,420
I would have loved
to taste-test.

333
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,900
-She's even better
than she used to be.

334
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,560
-What? Used to be?

335
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,730
-Must be James' butter.

336
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,560
-It's definitely not the butter.
It's all technique.

337
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,170
What do you mean, "used to be"?
-Not in a bad way.

338
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,000
-Well, we all grow and change
over the years.

339
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,570
-Especially when we get back to
our innocent, small-town butter.

340
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,540
-I still remember how you were
in middle school.

341
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,360
Braces, glasses.

342
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,240
You hardly said a word
back then.

343
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,240
Grace's awkward little sister,
the artsy one.

344
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,760
How things change.

345
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,990
Let me be a shining example

346
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,990
of how middle school
does not define you.

347
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,080
-You're gonna do great, Maddie.

348
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,340
-It does plant seeds
for the future.

349
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,430
After all,
I was class president.

350
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,480
-Yeah, you got the school to buy
those extra vending machines.

351
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,700
-With no help from anyone,
I might add.

352
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,740
If I had a campaign slogan,
it would have been,

353
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,090
"Never mind, I'll do it myself."

354
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,400
-Always impressive, Caitlin.

355
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,580
And you didn't get
any hot cocoa this evening.

356
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,580
Don't worry.
I'll wear you down.

357
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,540
Evening, artsy ladies.

358
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,760
Felicity, good luck.

359
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,070
-Thanks.
-Let me help you with that.

360
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,770
-Thank you kindly.

361
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,830
-You're my hero.
You know that?

362
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,700
Being 13 is the worst.

363
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,570
-Tell me about it.

364
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,790
-You really think my baking's
gotten better?

365
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,140
-I-I didn't mean to ...

366
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,230
-No, that's okay.
It's good feedback.

367
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,450
Not everyone will give you
an honest opinion.

368
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,060
I do think James' butter
had something to do with it.

369
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,320
But if you tell anyone
I said that, I'll deny it.

370
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,240
-Got it.
-And disown you.

371
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,800
-My lips are sealed.

372
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,110
-So, how busy are
13-year-olds these days?

373
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,810
-I don't know.

374
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,420
What?

375
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,810
What?!

376
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,910
-Okay, hold it
straight up and down.

377
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,650
Perfect.

378
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,960
Look at that. You're a natural.

379
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,530
-Everybody ready?

380
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,660
Look at you two little elves.

381
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,750
-Look what Aunt Felicity
showed me.

382
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,140
-That's pretty cool, Mad.
-Ready to get a tree?

383
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,800
-I got plenty of rope
to tie it up

384
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,590
and a Thermos full
of Carol's delicious eggnog.

385
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,410
-Don's out front.
He actually likes that stuff.

386
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,330
-Let's wrap this up, Maddie.

387
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,070
-Okay.
-There's a happy kid.

388
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,330
-What did you put
in those cookies?

389
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,550
-Christmas magic.

390
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,290
-All right, let's go.

391
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,360
-I know.

392
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,360
-How come we don't get to
go to the Schumachers'?

393
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,360
I've never been here.
-They retired.

394
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,150
-Hey, guys, wait up.

395
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,150
Christmas trees.
Smells like childhood.

396
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,370
-You guys are slow!
-Hold your horses!

397
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,770
-Oh, you're kidding.
-Hey, folks,

398
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,510
-What's he doing here?

399
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,730
-Anderson Family Farm.

400
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,990
-He sells the trees, too?
Ugh!

401
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,860
-Right, ugh.

402
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,390
A kind, good-looking farmer
milks the cows,

403
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,000
makes the cocoa,
sells the trees.

404
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,390
He's the worst.

405
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,830
-I was kind of a crab
last night.

406
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,610
-Oh, I'm shocked.

407
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,140
-Well, he, like, loves Christmas
way more than most guys.

408
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,490
It's weird.

409
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,790
-Only you would make that
a bad thing.

410
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,450
-Caitlin Rogers seems
pretty interested.

411
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,840
-Aw!

412
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,970
Can you blame her?

413
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,800
-I don't remember him
from school.

414
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,890
-You were too...

415
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,590
-Moody?

416
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,200
-...preoccupied with your
future as an artist.

417
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,640
-This one's nice.

418
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,990
-And he was too focused
on going pro.

419
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,030
-Really?

420
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,730
-It's like a...

421
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,470
-Do you like him?

422
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,650
-I mean, I don't like like him.

423
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,870
I'm moving back to Chicago
as soon as possible,

424
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,560
and happy-go-lucky farmers
can stay in Wisconsin.

425
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,610
-Okay.

426
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,360
Look at these trees!

427
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,020
-Ooh, this one's perfect.

428
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,460
-Fraser fir ...
that is my favorite.

429
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,420
-That's a tall one, Mad.

430
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,030
I think I'll need to put
the angel up.

431
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,080
-No way!
You can still lift me.

432
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,620
-Somebody get lost?

433
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,020
-Did you make these?

434
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,760
-I did.

435
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,460
-They're beautiful, actually.

436
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,420
-That is the first compliment
you've given me, so...

437
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,340
I'll take it.

438
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,300
-Well, I have guilt over being
a Cookie Monster last night.

439
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,430
I'm sorry about that.

440
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,910
-I am sorry, too.

441
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,740
I can get defensive
about my butter.

442
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,910
It's my life's work
you're talking about.

443
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,260
-Well, your life's work
seems to be just the ticket

444
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,350
to getting my life's work
off the ground.

445
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
-So the lady wants more?

446
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,970
-The lady requires
about 30 pounds of butter.

447
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,450
-Well, you have come
to the right place.

448
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,930
-Anyway, I, um...

449
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,280
I need to bake my head off if
I'm gonna get out of Aspen Grove

450
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,720
in January.

451
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,550
-Sure.

452
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,860
Let's get you and your
humbug attitude out of here.

453
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,470
-Exactly.

454
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,860
Whoa.

455
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,090
-Uh...

456
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,910
It's a ... It's a weed.

457
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Uh, mistletoe.
-Oh.

458
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,700
-Figured I would...sell it.

459
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,660
-That's ... That's a good
side business.

460
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,790
-It's not just a side business,
it's ... it's also fun.

461
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,880
-I'm gonna get out ...
I'm gonna go.

462
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,150
-Get you that butter!

463
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,940
-Okay, we've got a permit
for the farmers' market.

464
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,730
Now comes the fun part.
-Candy?

465
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,780
-Candy.

466
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,210
-Wait.

467
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,740
Look.

468
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,390
-Well, we're not sampling.

469
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,830
We're doing quality control.

470
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,410
-Mmm.

471
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,450
-Excuse me.

472
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,760
What are you doing?

473
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,500
-Quality control?

474
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,070
-There are no samples.

475
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,900
-My aunt is an amazing baker,

476
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,510
and she's gonna have a booth
at the farmers' market.

477
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,200
We're looking for candy
to use in the recipes.

478
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,950
-Wait.

479
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,300
Are you Felicity Olson?

480
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,910
-Yes.

481
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,910
Why? Did we go to high school
together, too?

482
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,090
-No. You baked cookies for the
dance recital the other night.

483
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,780
They were amazing.
-Thank you.

484
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,870
-Which ones were your favorite?

485
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,960
Market research.

486
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,660
-This girl's gonna
run the world someday.

487
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,880
-Well, I'm old-fashioned,
so definitely the sugar cookies.

488
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,490
Are you planning to open
a storefront?

489
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,800
-No.
-Not yet.

490
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,020
Right.
She's just visiting.

491
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,760
-Do you bake bread?

492
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,500
-Sourdough, country loaf,
pumpkin, you name it.

493
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,810
-What about croissants?

494
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,290
-Chocolate, pistachio,
or butter?

495
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,680
-Cakes?

496
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,250
-If it can be baked,
I can bake it.

497
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,210
-We've been in need
of a good bakery

498
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,120
ever since Mrs. Rockwell left.

499
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,640
-So I've heard.

500
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,910
-Look, Aspen Grove
is a good market...

501
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,300
if you can figure it out.

502
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,350
Mrs. Rockwell
was my biggest customer,

503
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,700
and I sent
a lot of folks her way.

504
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,050
It's one of the best parts
of small-town life.

505
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,700
We help each other.

506
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,530
But lately, things have...

507
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,270
slowed down.

508
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,840
-That's too bad.

509
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,890
-You're never alone in a town
like Aspen Grove.

510
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,320
That's what my parents
taught me.

511
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,280
This was their store.

512
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,330
It would break my heart
to close.

513
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,240
-Maybe if you allowed samples,
you'd have better word-of-mouth.

514
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,460
-Madison!
-No, you're right.

515
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,510
It's probably
time to update that policy.

516
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,120
-I am interested in getting
a sense of what you have.

517
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,860
Maybe there's a way
we can work together.

518
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,520
-Well, we don't do samples.

519
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,430
But we can do, uh, what was it?

520
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,520
Quality control?

521
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,440
Look, if I'm being honest,
I do quality control every day.

522
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,880
-Okay, I'll take them.
-Which ones?

523
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,630
-All of them.
-Oh!

524
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,500
-Wonderful. Really?
-Yes.

525
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,940
Oh, I also need some bulk
chocolate nibs ... 60 percent.

526
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,500
-What's the name
of your business?

527
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,590
For the order form.

528
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,380
-Oh, I don't know
if I have one anymore.

529
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,560
My bakery in Chicago was
called Ginger Snaps, but...

530
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,820
-What about Aspen Grove Bakery?

531
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,130
-Too generic.
Felicity's Cookies?

532
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,000
-But you bake more than
just cookies.

533
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,040
-Right.
Felicity's Christmas Treats?

534
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,130
-Christmas Treats by Felicity?
-Too many words.

535
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,610
-What about
Christmas with Felicity?

536
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,180
-Christmas with Felicity.

537
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,960
-Thank you. Merry Christmas.

538
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,570
-Thank you so much.

539
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,140
Here you go.

540
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,580
-Thank you so much.
Enjoy!

541
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,410
-Awesome.

542
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,630
Hey there, Pumpkin.

543
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,810
Should I introduce you
to my ginger?

544
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,420
-Did you just ask
that dog a question?

545
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,770
-Yes.

546
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,120
-Bless you.
-Thank you.

547
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,950
Oh, glad to see
you and your niece

548
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,040
have gotten into
the Christmas spirit.

549
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,870
-Well, 'tis the season.

550
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,820
Cookie?

551
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,040
-Can I try one?
-Oh, this is Brenda.

552
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,390
She is a Snow Ball volunteer.

553
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,310
-And her cousin.

554
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,620
-Mmm!
These are really good.

555
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,880
-We added lemon zest
and cardamom.

556
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,140
-Wonderful.
But we don't have time.

557
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,670
-Stressed?
-Well, we have the Snow Ball ...

558
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,670
that's the yearly town party ...
in less than two weeks.

559
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,060
We need decorations
that aren't ready yet,

560
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,330
a DJ who, for no reason,
won't return my calls,

561
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,460
and a catering company
that isn't e-mailing me

562
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,160
in a timely manner.

563
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,640
What do you think?
-Sounds like a big deal.

564
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,030
It is. Everybody's getting
dressed up.

565
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,380
-And desserts.

566
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,430
-Really?

567
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,340
-And now this.

568
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,340
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

569
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,690
but the board didn't
receive your permit

570
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,650
to sell at the Christmas fair.

571
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,050
-Oh, well, I definitely
submitted my permit.

572
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,830
-That was for
the farmers' market.

573
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,090
This is the Christmas fair.

574
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,490
-They look the same to me.
When did that happen?

575
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,580
-This morning? Today.

576
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,540
Today is the first day
of the Christmas fair.

577
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,280
-Oh. Can I get a permit?
-Sure.

578
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,110
-Great.
-For next year.

579
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,760
This year is full up,
and it's too late.

580
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,720
-But I'm here.

581
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,810
I have a stand.
-These are really good.

582
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:35,200
-Felicity, this is a carefully
constructed fair.

583
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,950
Now, I know you've been enjoying
making money off the holidays

584
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,170
and baking your little cookies,

585
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,950
but you're not authorized
to be here.

586
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,130
You'll have to leave.

587
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,170
-But ...
-It gives me no pleasure.

588
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,350
But that's the final word
on the matter.

589
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,530
-What do we do now?

590
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,620
-I hate this town.

591
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,100
I hate making my favorite thing
into a business.

592
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,710
I hate Christmas.

593
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,540
-Looks like Brian
is spending Christmas

594
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,580
with his parents in Evanston.

595
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,190
That makes sense.

596
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,150
-It's strange, not having him
around this year.

597
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,890
You talk to him much lately?

598
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,550
Aww!

599
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,380
You used to love this one.

600
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,210
-Oh, yeah, the angel
with the trumpet.

601
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,640
-I recall you and Grace

602
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,170
almost breaking
that one during a fight.

603
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,690
-Sweetie, how are you?

604
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,170
-I'm tired, Mom.

605
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,660
-I'm sure you are.

606
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,220
-I tried so hard in Chicago,
and it didn't work.

607
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,400
And now it's like
I'm just repeating myself here.

608
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,450
It's like I'm on a failure loop.

609
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,450
And I lost Brian.

610
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,320
-Now, you broke up with him,
isn't that right?

611
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:38,020
He wasn't supportive?
-He was when we started.

612
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,680
But I pushed him away.

613
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,200
I don't know, I just ...
I wanted to prove to myself

614
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,070
that I could do it.

615
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,510
-It's hard to start a business.

616
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,900
-Yeah, but at least
I had someone.

617
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,820
Now I'm all alone.

618
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,860
All I have is Ginger.

619
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,730
-Sorry, Ginger Snap.

620
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,300
-You know, a lot of businesses
fail in the first year.

621
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,390
The fact that you made it two
is impressive.

622
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,000
-Thanks, Dad.

623
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,220
-Hello, my dears.

624
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,140
-As a person who mopes,
I can say this.

625
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,750
You're moping.

626
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,410
-I'm not moping.
-You are moping.

627
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,100
It's annoying.

628
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,370
-Don't ruin Christmas
for everybody.

629
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,940
-Okay, harsh.
Do you feel this way, too?

630
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,510
Wow, okay, not only did I ruin
my relationship and my business,

631
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,290
but my incessant moping is
ruining Christmas for everyone.

632
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,250
I should have just stayed
in Chicago and moped in peace.

633
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,300
You've got to stop.

634
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,090
Try something new.

635
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,440
Look what Maddie did.

636
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,700
-Social media...

637
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,360
and a website, too.

638
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,190
-This looks really good.

639
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,490
-There's an order form
and everything.

640
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,450
You don't need the stand
at the Christmas fair.

641
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,760
-You don't need a permit
from anyone.

642
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,760
-I've tried this
online-business thing.

643
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,760
I couldn't keep up with it while
running the actual business.

644
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,160
There's just too much.

645
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,590
-You just need some help.

646
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,730
-I know you feel alone, darling,

647
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,900
but you do have
more than just Ginger.

648
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,560
-You have us.

649
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,520
-Oh, I don't know how
to accept this.

650
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,650
-It's done! Accept.

651
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,310
-And hire me as your PR
and social-media manager.

652
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,260
-Yeah, you need
someone on your level.

653
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,490
-Okay.

654
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,490
Let's do it.

655
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,400
-Good...

656
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,320
because I already got you
another gig.

657
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,710
-Already?
-Question.

658
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,100
How do you feel
about good-looking farmers?

659
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:51,590
-My tree is set up in my room
with my favorite ornaments.

660
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,330
It's magical. Thank you.

661
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,420
-I'm so glad.

662
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,160
I'll see you in there.

663
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,820
You're a lifesaver.

664
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,080
-Saving lives with cookies.
What was that about?

665
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,780
-We had some spare branches
from the farm, so we put

666
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,820
Charlie Brown Christmas trees
in all the rooms.

667
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,870
-Are you a real person?

668
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,570
-What?

669
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,050
-Nothing.
It's just really nice.

670
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,270
-Anyway, I guess Mrs. Rockwell
used to supply desserts

671
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,180
to tonight's party every year.

672
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,880
Looks like they didn't get
the memo she left town.

673
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,230
-I appreciate the work.
-Oh, you're glad to see me, too.

674
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,190
-No. I mean...

675
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,540
-Money, money, money.
I-I know. I know.

676
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,420
Do you need to take that?

677
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,990
-Uh, no.
Let's set up.

678
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,600
-Okay.

679
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,160
-Oh, no, don't please.
You're too nice.

680
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,250
-Oh, yeah, here.

681
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,260
Just kidding.

682
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,780
Maybe I am too nice.

683
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,230
-That's an awful lot
to choose from.

684
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,630
My wife used to make these.

685
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,410
Pretzels for antlers.

686
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,630
-Did she really?

687
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,850
Sounds like a fun lady.

688
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,340
-It's a hard time of year
to miss someone.

689
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,340
-It is.

690
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,170
Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas to you.

691
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,090
-I never know if I'm saying
the right thing.

692
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,350
-You're doing pretty good.

693
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,310
Can I introduce you to someone?

694
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,270
-James, you've thrown another
wonderful party.

695
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,670
-Grandma, this is Felicity.

696
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,930
-Pleased to meet you.
I'm Nora.

697
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,890
-Lovely to meet you.

698
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,630
-James told me you
baked these cookies.

699
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,980
They're remarkable.

700
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,590
-She should know.

701
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,110
She gave Mrs Rockwell
her first job as a baker.

702
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,290
-Of course, she wasn't
Mrs. Rockwell then.

703
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,680
She was just Bonnie.

704
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,900
-That is an honor, then.
Thank you.

705
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,730
-Did you go to culinary school?

706
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,040
-Actually, I went to art school.
-Really?

707
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,690
-Really.

708
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,350
But after I graduated,
I got a job at a bakery

709
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,000
to pay the rent,
and I fell in love with it.

710
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,180
-Art for the taste buds.
-That's right.

711
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,010
-Do you have a new bakery
here in town?

712
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,320
I'm sure you're successful.

713
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,150
-No, I live in Chicago now.
Uh, my bakery...

714
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,100
Well, we had to close.

715
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,590
-So, uh, what are you
doing here now?

716
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,500
-Well, I guess this is the part

717
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,030
where I'm getting back
on my feet.

718
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,340
-Sometimes, trying again is even
harder than just starting out.

719
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,040
-Yeah, I think you're right.

720
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,520
-You're polite with me,
but I can tell you're a fighter.

721
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,610
Takes one to know one.

722
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,830
And James knows something
about hard times.

723
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,180
-She doesn't want
to hear about that.

724
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,750
-But he has put such
dedicated work into the farm.

725
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,230
He's made us proud.

726
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,630
-Yeah, I can see that.

727
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,290
-Hey, thanks again.

728
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,120
You made her week.

729
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,730
I didn't realize you've been
going through all that.

730
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,290
-Oh, it's okay.

731
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,860
-With that and the wedding,
it must be...

732
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,250
I'm sorry.

733
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,780
Grace mentioned.

734
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,000
-Grace always mentions it.
It's no big deal.

735
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,610
Hey, thanks again.

736
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,960
It was really nice
to bake for people

737
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,790
who actually appreciate it.

738
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,570
-So you're gonna have a booth
at the Christmas fair

739
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,010
tomorrow night, right?

740
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,270
-Nope. Caitlin wouldn't
give me a permit.

741
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,010
No permit, no booth.

742
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,400
-Caitlin is a stickler
for the rules.

743
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,490
-You think?
-But...

744
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,540
I have a booth.

745
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,410
Who's to say
I can't sell dessert?

746
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:09,060
-No, I can't let you do that.
-We've been a success twice.

747
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,280
We should team up again.

748
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,550
-Okay.

749
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,640
Okay, in the spirit
of letting people help me,

750
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,600
which I'm trying to be
better at...

751
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,900
count me in.

752
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,340
-Great!
Business partners.

753
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,650
-Kiss!

754
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,040
Kiss.

755
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,920
-Uh...

756
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,570
I hung that. Sorry.

757
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,350
-It's a weed, right?
-Uh, yeah.

758
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,660
Yeah, it's a ... it's a weed.

759
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,360
-It's tradition!

760
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,320
-You can do better than that.
-Uh...

761
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,500
-Okay, I'm gonna ...
I'll see you later.

762
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,070
-See you later, Felicity.

763
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,240
-Hey, sweetie.

764
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,150
-Hey, Mom, Dad.

765
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,110
-You're in a good mood
this morning.

766
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,770
-Yeah, I guess I am.

767
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:50,950
Something about
a fresh snowfall.

768
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,600
I see you two playing footsie,
by the way.

769
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,910
Reminds me of Christmas morning.

770
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,400
-Oh, every year, a tangerine
at the bottom of your stocking.

771
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,960
Your grandmother did it, too.

772
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,050
-I'm gonna borrow these
to make something ...

773
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,920
gingerbread with
tangerine essence and peel.

774
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,530
Dipped in chocolate?

775
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,410
-Mm, shaped like stockings.

776
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,100
-Love it.

777
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,800
Do not love it.

778
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,590
-What is it?

779
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,240
-Look at how many orders I have.

780
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,460
-Oh, my.

781
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,210
That's a good problem.

782
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,340
-And I'm doing the cookies
for the Christmas fair tonight.

783
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,820
I'm gonna faint.

784
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,000
-No, you're not.
We're here for you.

785
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,740
-We are.

786
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,040
-Wow!
-That's a lot of orders.

787
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,740
-You just tell us what to do,
kiddo.

788
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,650
-Okay, everybody, smile!

789
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,370
-Hello.
-Felicity?

790
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,850
-Brian.

791
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,630
How are you?

792
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,550
-Good. I'm, uh...

793
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,210
It's good to hear your voice.

794
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,510
-You, too.

795
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,260
Sorry about that.

796
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,260
-Having a good time?

797
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,090
-Actually, I am.
You?

798
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,050
-Well, I was on a break
at work,

799
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,830
just wasting some time online,

800
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,840
and I saw some amazing cookies
come up in my feed.

801
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,670
Beautiful photos,
a great, great website.

802
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,840
-Business is booming.

803
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,580
-It looks like it, yeah.

804
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,930
I'm proud of you.

805
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,020
-I'm proud of me, too.

806
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,420
Oh, that was corny.

807
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,900
-No, no, no, no.

808
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,380
It's good to hear you
laugh again.

809
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,120
I know it's been hard.

810
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,560
-Well, your name was on the
wedding invites, too, remember?

811
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,990
-Oh, I remember.

812
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,690
-I can't tell
what you're thinking.

813
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,300
-I'm thinking, I miss you.

814
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,350
-I miss you, too.
But we shouldn't ...

815
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,130
-I miss you cooking dinner.

816
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,310
I miss that spot of flour
on your cheek

817
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,620
at the end of the day.

818
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,920
I wonder, uh, maybe...

819
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:03,620
-Felicity!

820
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,010
How do you want to display
the snickerdoodles?

821
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,580
-I should go.

822
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,970
Um...

823
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,330
We have so many orders,
it's ridiculous.

824
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,150
But wonderful.
-Yeah.

825
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,110
Okay. Uh...

826
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,770
can we talk again soon?

827
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:21,380
-Yeah. Okay.

828
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,420
Um, I got to go.
-Okay. Uh, bye.

829
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,990
-Bye.

830
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,280
-Almost finished.

831
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,940
I'm gonna need coffee.
-Just wait.

832
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,590
Look. New orders.

833
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,030
-Good news travels fast.

834
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,200
-Thank you so much.

835
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,030
I'm not used to this.

836
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,820
It's been really...

837
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,470
-We're glad you're back, too.

838
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:20,130
-So, Brian called.

839
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,180
Twice.

840
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,180
-Why?
-Don't be mad.

841
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,360
-I'm not mad, I'm just...

842
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,270
I'm protective.

843
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,880
-Brian is a good man.

844
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,880
-Brian wants to be a good man.

845
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,710
-Well, his intentions are good.

846
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,410
He's made a few mistakes
in the execution.

847
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,590
-I still love him.

848
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,380
I think I always will.

849
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,810
-Of course you will.

850
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,510
-But how did you know that
Don was the one for you?

851
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,170
-It was not in the big gesture,
the way you see in the movies.

852
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,650
It was really..

853
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,220
ordinary.

854
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,960
I had just gone back to work,
and I was new at the office.

855
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:12,010
And he was this cute,
nerdy doctor.

856
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,970
I was rushing because
I was nervous,

857
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:16,930
and I was carrying all
these forms and a coffee.

858
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,750
And I ran right into him,

859
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,710
and I dropped my coffee ...
splat, on the floor.

860
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,720
It was a mess.

861
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,150
But as I was cleaning it up,

862
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,330
I just remember him
bending down and saying,

863
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:32,460
"Can I get you a new coffee?
How do you like it?"

864
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,120
And I knew.

865
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,080
-Well, that's a completely
boring story.

866
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,130
-Well, not to me.

867
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,350
'Cause I remember his face.

868
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,960
And I remember thinking,

869
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,350
"That's the man
you're gonna spend

870
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,180
the rest of your life with."

871
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,530
I was shocked.
I did not see it coming.

872
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,580
You know, Felicity,
you've always wanted things

873
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,670
in the extreme ...

874
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,370
big city, the painting studio...

875
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:09,670
a bakery, perhaps before
you were ready.

876
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,070
-Hey!
-It's not a bad thing.

877
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,420
But there is so much to be found
in the simple things.

878
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:21,820
There is magic everywhere,
even in Aspen Grove.

879
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,430
You just have to open
your eyes to it.

880
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,140
-Evening, folks.
Ready to warm up?

881
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,580
-Two cocoas, please.

882
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,790
-And two vanilla
shortbread cookies.

883
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,270
-Absolutely.

884
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,840
-We've been trying
to figure it out,

885
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,710
but what do you
put in your cocoa?

886
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,710
-Definitely cinnamon.
-Definitely.

887
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,330
But what else?

888
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,410
-Don't look at me.
I still haven't tried it.

889
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,630
-It's Christmas cheer.

890
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,550
-Fine. Keep your secrets.

891
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,850
-Merry Christmas.

892
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,120
-Well, this is all gorgeous.

893
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,120
You two should take a walk
and check it out.

894
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,770
-Grace, your sister has
never had my cocoa.

895
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,820
-Have you had any of my cookies?

896
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,520
-You hit me
the last time I tried.

897
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,520
Oh-ho, I am not falling
for that again.

898
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,820
-What?

899
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,180
You can't sell
if you don't know

900
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,660
what the goods taste like.

901
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,740
So do a taste test
and take a walk.

902
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,010
Go!
-After you.

903
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,590
-And that, dear,
is how it's done.

904
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,760
-Let's get some cookies.
-Just one.

905
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,200
-Oh, hey, Caitlin.

906
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,110
Have you been able
to enjoy the fair?

907
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,680
-Yes, Daniel was
willing to put up with

908
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,250
his mom for an evening, and I'll
take whatever I can get.

909
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:46,860
-I understand.

910
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,380
Maddie's gotten into working
with her aunt,

911
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,910
so I have been lucky
to see more of her lately.

912
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,780
-You decorated these?
-Some of them.

913
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,390
-Cool.

914
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:59,870
-Speaking of which,
is Felicity...?

915
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,610
-Oh, she's just on break.

916
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,140
Get her mind off
that ex-fiancé of hers.

917
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,570
And James is so sweet, right?

918
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,230
-He is.

919
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:14,500
-I do feel bad, though,
about the whole permit thing.

920
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,410
-Yeah.

921
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:19,500
Cait, you got to loosen up.

922
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,590
I know you're overwhelmed,
but it's the holidays.

923
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,240
-Right?

924
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,120
Right. I shouldn't have
been so hard on Felicity.

925
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,470
Is she, um...

926
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:33,380
still mourning
about the wedding, you think?

927
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:34,990
-She thinks she is.

928
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,870
Keeps talking about Brian.

929
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:42,040
She's had a hard year.

930
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:45,270
But I say, rock bottom
is a blessing.

931
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,830
In with the new.

932
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,620
-Brian ... rock bottom.

933
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,400
Got it.

934
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,920
-So, which cookie's
got your eye?

935
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,100
-I'll take a snowman.

936
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,190
-And I'll do a brownie.

937
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,110
Wow, that's good!

938
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,680
Peppermint?

939
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,250
-Genius, right?

940
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,470
-Okay. Sorry I waited.

941
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,820
This is the best hot cocoa
I've ever had.

942
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,640
-Cayenne.
-Really?

943
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:18,120
-Yeah, just a pinch.

944
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,000
-That's not very
Wisconsin of you.

945
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,910
-No, no. Something I got
from my teammate's aunt.

946
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,310
-Hmm, you're changing my whole
perspective on football players.

947
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:28,960
-But these cookies ... I could
get fat on these.

948
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,880
-All that innocent butter.

949
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,270
-No, I can just tell you know
what you're doing

950
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,930
'cause I have never had
anything like this around here.

951
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,930
-That's big-city French bakery
training for you.

952
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:44,370
Layers of unsalted butter,
room-temperature eggs,

953
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:46,500
creaming the butter
and sugar just right

954
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,980
so the sugar crystals
perfectly aerate the butter.

955
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,370
It's scientific,

956
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,460
but also an art.

957
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:56,640
-You miss your bakery, huh?

958
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,640
-I used to wake up at
4:00 a.m. every morning

959
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,210
just to roll out cookie dough
and bread loaves.

960
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,820
Take the rolls out of the oven

961
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,690
for the die-hard
early customers.

962
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,350
I was so proud of it.

963
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,000
For a while.

964
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:24,450
-What happened,
if you don't mind?

965
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,500
-Well, it wasn't the baking.

966
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,590
Never was.

967
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,240
I just didn't know what I needed
to know as a new business owner,

968
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:37,120
if ... if that makes sense.

969
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,030
-It does.

970
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,160
-It was so expensive.

971
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,390
At the same time, my
relationship was falling apart.

972
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,560
I couldn't pay rent.

973
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:52,000
Brian had just made partner,
and he would come by the bakery

974
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,310
after work,
and he'd be in a suit,

975
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,660
and I'd be on the kitchen floor
covered in flour, crying.

976
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,790
When did it get so complicated?

977
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,100
When I was younger,
I used to think

978
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,280
that you would
just fall in love,

979
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,280
and that would be enough.

980
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,110
So stupid.

981
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,240
Real life isn't romantic at all.

982
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,380
-I'm not buying that.

983
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,730
-Not buying what?

984
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,430
-I think you do believe
that life is romantic.

985
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,560
You might even believe
in Christmas cheer

986
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,040
and all that other corny stuff.

987
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,390
But you're telling yourself
you don't, that you're above it.

988
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,610
-Why would I do that?

989
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:39,400
-Maybe because sometimes
second chances hurt.

990
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,660
They can be even harder than
starting out for the first time.

991
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,100
-Wait a minute, did you
just quote your grandma?

992
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:48,880
-No.
-You so did!

993
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:54,150
-I'd be more embarrassed if
she wasn't right all the time.

994
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,720
-Why do you love
Christmas so much?

995
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,890
-Oh, you think it's funny, a guy
would like Christmas this much?

996
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,030
-No.

997
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,290
I mean, a little.

998
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,550
-Well, we did miss each other
in high school.

999
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,430
-You would have never liked me,
by the way.

1000
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,910
-Oh, I don't know about that.

1001
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,430
I think you would have
intimidated me.

1002
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:17,430
You may not know this,
but after graduation,

1003
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,300
I went right into college ball

1004
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:23,480
and was slated to go pro,
get snatched up pretty quickly.

1005
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:27,440
-What happened?
-That's where my luck ran out.

1006
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:30,580
I got knocked down,
like everybody does,

1007
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,450
but I hit my head
too many times.

1008
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,020
Got a few concussions.

1009
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,670
And the last one I had was the
final practice before Christmas.

1010
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,030
I got knocked out cold.

1011
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,200
It was terrifying.

1012
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,550
My mom tells me
it was terrifying, I mean.

1013
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:58,390
Uh, all I remember is waking up
on Christmas morning.

1014
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,080
My family had slept
at the hospital.

1015
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,220
My parents, grandma,
brother and sister.

1016
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,750
The room was just decorated.

1017
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,010
There were lights and
a tree in the corner.

1018
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,930
Mom was crying.

1019
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,150
My grandma, she was crying.

1020
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:29,550
My dad, he was trying
not to cry.

1021
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,250
Every Christmas since then...

1022
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,030
I just feel really grateful

1023
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,600
to celebrate the holiday.

1024
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:42,300
To try and make the world
just a little bit happier.

1025
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,570
-You're...

1026
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,620
-What?

1027
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:56,970
-You're different
than I thought you were.

1028
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:01,060
-So are you.

1029
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:38,570
-I think I'm starting to see
why you like Christmas so much.

1030
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,490
-I like Christmas so much.

1031
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,670
-What are you doing?
-Listening to it.

1032
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:31,500
-What's it telling you?
-That it's done.

1033
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,330
-You're awfully chipper.

1034
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,500
Did you have a nice walk
last night?

1035
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,630
Enjoy some Christmas carols?

1036
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,160
Sample some hot chocolate?

1037
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,030
-So what if I did?

1038
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:45,340
-Look at little miss
"I hate Christmas."

1039
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:48,170
All star-eyed.

1040
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,860
-Can I help?

1041
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,170
-You want to remove that cake
from its round?

1042
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:53,560
-Sure thing.

1043
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,130
-Ow!

1044
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,740
Oh! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1045
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,310
I'm sorry.
-Not so graceful, are we, Grace?

1046
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,530
-How rude.

1047
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:08,190
-Don't worry about it.
I'll just bake another one.

1048
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,130
This is cute.
-Yeah, I like that.

1049
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:38,430
-For your mom?

1050
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,650
-I think she has
that one already.

1051
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,310
-What is one more reindeer?

1052
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,400
-Oh, Aunt Felicity? Can you
pick up something and pose?

1053
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,360
I want to show you
being normal and shopping.

1054
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,010
-Being normal?

1055
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,930
-You know what I mean.
For the socials.

1056
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:54,800
We need to populate the pages.

1057
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:57,760
Smile!

1058
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,720
And who's that for?
-No one.

1059
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,550
I just picked it up
'cause you told me to.

1060
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,590
-But we have to tell a story.

1061
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,940
Right. Um...

1062
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,380
-People will respond more

1063
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,860
if there's an emotional
connection.

1064
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,690
They want to know
why you're buying it.

1065
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,340
Like, is it for someone special?

1066
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,860
-Someone special?

1067
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:19,560
-I mean, we can make it up
or whatever,

1068
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,780
but we don't want to lie,
so it's a balance.

1069
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,700
-Let's just say
it's for your grandpa.

1070
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,660
That's someone special, right?

1071
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:27,920
-Not James?

1072
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,750
-That's a can of worms
I can't deal with yet.

1073
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,790
-But you are gonna
get him something, right?

1074
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,100
-Maybe.
But don't post that.

1075
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,890
-Why?

1076
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:41,710
-I can't put my feelings
out into the world.

1077
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,410
It's too soon, and what if
somebody sees it?

1078
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,890
-Like James?
-Or Brian.

1079
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,810
I don't want to blindside him
at Christmas.

1080
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,990
I'll let him know
in my own time.

1081
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,210
-Okay, so it's for Grandpa.

1082
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,740
Aunt Felicity...

1083
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,480
how do you know
if a boy likes you?

1084
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,310
-You're asking me?

1085
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,530
-Well, you do have two boys
that like you right now.

1086
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:16,530
Okay, fair enough.

1087
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,450
Well, the first question
I would ask is,

1088
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:21,360
do you like this boy?

1089
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,800
-I don't know.

1090
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,020
-But maybe, right?

1091
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,110
-Yeah, but I don't want to
like him if he doesn't like me.

1092
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:31,020
-Yeah, that's the hard part,

1093
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:33,550
because you got to
put yourself out there,

1094
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,810
and that might mean
you could get hurt.

1095
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,900
But if you don't,
you might miss out on the chance

1096
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,080
at being really happy.

1097
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,860
-Okay.

1098
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,250
-There are ways that
you can tell, though, like...

1099
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,690
does he listen to you?

1100
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:49,520
Do you feel like
you can be yourself around him?

1101
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,480
-This is stressful.

1102
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,180
-Tell me about it.

1103
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,270
But it's like you were saying ...
it's a balancing act

1104
01:02:56,310 --> 01:03:00,100
between protecting yourself
and putting yourself out there.

1105
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,400
-Thanks.

1106
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,840
Sometimes it's hard to talk
to my mom about this stuff.

1107
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,800
-Sure. I mean,
what are aunts for?

1108
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:12,540
-Are you actually gonna
buy that for grandpa?

1109
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,850
-Well, I don't want to be
a liar on the social.

1110
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:40,830
-Sharon, I don't care
if your daughter has the plague.

1111
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,750
I need those cupcakes
in two days.

1112
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:44,400
Don't bother me
until they're done.

1113
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:47,400
-Peppermint mocha for Felicity.

1114
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:50,150
-Caitlin, hi.
-Festive drink order.

1115
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:52,850
-I feel like I'm getting into
the holiday season, finally.

1116
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,280
Oh, your cousin Brenda
ordered cookies.

1117
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,330
If you see her, tell her
they'll be ready tomorrow.

1118
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:58,240
-Well, you'll have to
tell her yourself.

1119
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,590
She quit.

1120
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,290
-Oh, I'm sorry.

1121
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:05,210
Like I said, never mind,
I'll do it myself.

1122
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,640
-But the Snow Ball's
coming together?

1123
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,770
-Amazingly.
Couldn't be better.

1124
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,130
-Great. Well, my family and I
are planning on being there.

1125
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:15,000
So good luck with everything.
Really.

1126
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,520
-Bless you.

1127
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,660
-Triple-shot gingerbread latte.

1128
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,140
-Hi, baby.
Making friends out here?

1129
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:33,490
What's gotten into...?

1130
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,800
You.
-Felicity.

1131
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,020
-Good morning.

1132
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,850
I did not mean to startle you.
-Let me get that.

1133
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:47,460
-Thank you.
-Can I get you a new coffee?

1134
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:48,900
-How do you like it?

1135
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,690
-Hello?

1136
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,430
-Um, Brian, what are you
doing here?

1137
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:58,080
-Brian?

1138
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,870
-James, this is Brian.
Brian, this is James.

1139
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,390
-Nice to meet you.

1140
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,480
-I'm sorry, who are you?

1141
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:08,440
-Um, James sells the incredible
butter I use in my cookies.

1142
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:11,230
-Fantastic.
The local supplier.

1143
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:13,100
-Brian, listen ...
-I know.

1144
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:17,230
I know it's a surprise,
but let me take you to lunch.

1145
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,840
-I-I-I have so much to do.
-Oh, come on.

1146
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:21,670
You've got to eat.

1147
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,670
It's so good to see you.

1148
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,290
-James, I-I'm sorry.
I need to...

1149
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:29,990
I'll see you later?

1150
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:32,950
-Of course, yeah.

1151
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:34,510
-It was nice to meet you, man.

1152
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,990
-James.
-Right.

1153
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,520
Come on, Ginger.

1154
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,820
She missed me.

1155
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:48,180
-So, now you've met the fiancé.

1156
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,830
-Ex-fiancé.
-Well, not quite.

1157
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,270
Last night, Grace was telling me
that Felicity has been

1158
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:57,060
talking about him
the whole time she's been back.

1159
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:01,150
Well, I mean, of course,
I'm sure you can tell that

1160
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:05,540
Grace has been trying
to push Felicity on you.

1161
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,890
-You don't...

1162
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,940
They're not...

1163
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:12,290
back together?
-Oh, yeah, she's stuck on him.

1164
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:16,340
And who can blame her?
Successful lawyer.

1165
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,250
But I'm sure you gave her
a huge confidence boost

1166
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,780
when she needed it most?

1167
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,730
Nice guy like you.

1168
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,040
-Bless you.

1169
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,260
-Thank you. See?

1170
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,650
Nice.

1171
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:41,190
-I almost forgot how this town
goes all out for the holiday.

1172
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,280
I think I saw
a snowman-building contest.

1173
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,890
-Isn't it great?

1174
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,710
-I guess you got to find
something to do

1175
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,320
in a town this small.

1176
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,370
-Well, I kind of like it.

1177
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:52,980
-Well, let's cut to the chase.

1178
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,160
-Always a lawyer.

1179
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,720
-Well, I'm ... I'm nervous.
-No, don't be.

1180
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:59,070
-It's just me.

1181
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,160
-Yeah, it's just you.

1182
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:04,250
I miss you.

1183
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,780
You miss me.

1184
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,000
Chicago misses you.

1185
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,480
-I doubt that.

1186
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,040
-It's so good to see you.

1187
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,830
-You, too.

1188
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,700
I've been thinking about you.
-Oh, yeah?

1189
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,400
-Yeah.

1190
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,930
Now you're here,
and I have to say,

1191
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:26,540
it's kind of strange.

1192
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:29,410
-I get that.

1193
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:31,590
But hear me out.

1194
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:35,720
I was wrong not to believe in
you when I had the chance.

1195
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,850
-Thank you.

1196
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,990
-I mean, you're blowing up.

1197
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:43,030
-Yeah, I am.

1198
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:46,120
-I always knew you could do more
when you put your mind to it.

1199
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:47,780
-I seem to remember you making
that point clear.

1200
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,430
-Right, uh ...
-Before work.

1201
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,260
After work.

1202
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,740
After that party
at the Shadducks'.

1203
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,610
-I had a huge case I was
dealing with at that time.

1204
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:59,130
-And you were embarrassed by me
at that dinner.

1205
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,790
-No, that's not accurate.

1206
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:02,750
-You had just made partner,
and you laughed

1207
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:05,180
at my sales figures
in front of everyone.

1208
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:07,360
-It was some gentle mocking.

1209
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,880
I wanted you to be better.

1210
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:10,800
I-Isn't that what
loving someone is?

1211
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,450
Seeing the best in them?

1212
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,370
-But it wasn't for
a lack of trying.

1213
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:16,890
I needed help.

1214
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:20,760
If I could start over
and go back,

1215
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:23,120
I would do things
the way I'm doing it now,

1216
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,420
from the ground up,
but with you,

1217
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,770
it always felt like
I was chasing your approval.

1218
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,690
-It kills me because I never,

1219
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,820
ever meant for it
to come off like that.

1220
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You argue a lot more
than you used to.

1221
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:40,220
-I learned from the best.

1222
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:47,570
-Listen, I have it
on pretty good authority

1223
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:51,270
that there's a storefront
in Lincoln Park near the office

1224
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,280
that would be perfect
for a bakery.

1225
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,150
-I can't afford that yet.
-I can help you.

1226
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:59,670
Pay for professional marketing,
whatever you need.

1227
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,330
-So what?

1228
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,940
I set up shop in a place
that you like

1229
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:05,330
in a neighborhood
that you approve of,

1230
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:07,460
now that I have this
online following,

1231
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,900
now that I'm a success?

1232
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,510
-Exactly.

1233
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,040
-What about you and me?

1234
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,470
-We can give it another go.

1235
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,220
I mean, you've ...
you've grown so much.

1236
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,040
-Now that you're proud of me?

1237
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,350
-You were floundering.

1238
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,530
It was so hard before.
You were unhappy.

1239
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:30,570
-That's when you fight
for the other person.

1240
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:34,100
I helped you pay your bills
during law school by baking.

1241
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,360
-I know that. You don't
have to bring it up.

1242
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:37,930
-I loved you
when you were struggling,

1243
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:40,240
and when the tables were turned,
you laughed at me.

1244
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,240
-And I said I was sorry.

1245
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,630
-What am I even doing here?

1246
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,290
This is why we broke up.
-Felicity.

1247
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:51,160
You're making a scene.
-I have to go.

1248
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,030
-Felic...

1249
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,240
-Lost your number.

1250
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,960
James.

1251
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,530
-Hey.
-Hey.

1252
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:55,350
I wanted to explain
to you about earlier.

1253
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,230
-That was your fiancé,
wasn't it?

1254
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:59,050
-Brian is not ...

1255
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,970
-How sweet of him to drive in
from the city to see you.

1256
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:03,970
-Yeah, well, I wanted
to explain to you about ...

1257
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,060
-There's no need to explain.
I just...

1258
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,540
I don't want to hear
any more about this guy.

1259
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,670
-Okay.

1260
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,240
-I thought something
was happening here or...

1261
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,460
I'm not interested
in ... in this.

1262
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,210
-Okay, got it.

1263
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,300
-I'm glad you're feeling better

1264
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:26,210
and you're all set
to get out of Aspen Grove.

1265
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:29,820
I think you're just...

1266
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,260
-You think I'm what?

1267
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,350
-Doesn't matter.

1268
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,220
Look, I'm a nice guy.

1269
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,310
Sure, but there's a line.

1270
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:43,360
You called off your wedding
six months ago.

1271
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,100
You're not ready to move on yet.

1272
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:49,020
-Okay, got it. I thought
you were being nice to me.

1273
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,890
I thought you liked me,

1274
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:53,060
but you're actually
just nice to everybody.

1275
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:55,590
James ...
everybody's best friend.

1276
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,500
But it's just a cover
because you're afraid to commit.

1277
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,600
-I'm nice.
I am a nice guy.

1278
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,250
But I'm not a fool.

1279
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:34,020
-Okay, no.

1280
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:36,110
Thank you, but please stop.

1281
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:38,330
-What?
-Where's Maddie?

1282
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,420
She's so much better at this.

1283
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,290
-I miss the Christmas Felicity,

1284
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:44,070
back when you lived up
to your name.

1285
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,330
-Look, you want to help?

1286
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:49,340
Order forms, boxes, cookies.

1287
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,950
You know the drill.
Thank you!

1288
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:09,270
-This really is impressive.

1289
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,970
Do you think you've made enough
to move back to Chicago?

1290
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,320
-I think so.

1291
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,320
I mean, I don't have
a future here.

1292
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,890
-You mean you don't have
a future with James.

1293
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:24,680
I haven't seen you
so happy in years.

1294
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,770
You should talk to him.
-He's right.

1295
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,420
I wasn't fair to him.

1296
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,470
Six months after
calling off a wedding?

1297
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:34,730
I blew it.

1298
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,730
I wish I could blame Brian,
but it's me.

1299
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:41,820
It's always been me,
standing in my own way.

1300
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:45,180
-Well, at least you've come
to your senses.

1301
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,050
-Enlightenment is a blast.

1302
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:57,490
It's not too late, you know?

1303
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:59,490
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

1304
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,890
There's time for
a last-minute miracle.

1305
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,800
-Grace, please.

1306
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:07,850
I'm so tired of Christmas.

1307
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:10,330
I just wanted to survive the
holidays without falling apart,

1308
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:12,030
and here I am again.

1309
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,250
-Mom! Aunt Felicity!

1310
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,260
-Hey, who's this?

1311
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,430
-Oh, this is Daniel.

1312
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,090
-Where Madison has been
instead of cookie decorating.

1313
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,610
-Mom!

1314
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:29,480
Thanks for ratting me out.
-See?

1315
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,130
Everyone gets their
priorities confused

1316
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,790
between romance and work.

1317
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,270
-You have to come.
My mom ...

1318
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:36,010
-She's losing it.

1319
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,580
Sorry.
-Maddie!

1320
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,360
-What?
That's what's happening.

1321
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,010
-Who's your mom?

1322
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,580
-You're not gonna like
the answer to that one.

1323
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:52,070
-Mom, I brought back-up.

1324
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:54,550
-No, I don't want your help.

1325
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,070
-Uh, too late.

1326
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,210
What's going on?

1327
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,770
-All of the volunteers
have given up,

1328
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:04,170
and everyone who said they were
gonna bake cookies have...

1329
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,390
have quit.

1330
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:10,570
I guess I'm not
very good with people.

1331
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:12,180
-Oh, no.
-Who would say that?

1332
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,050
-Please.

1333
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:16,090
I'm just trying
to make everything

1334
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,050
beautiful and perfect.

1335
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:21,140
And I'm so tired.

1336
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:23,880
-Listen, Caitlin!

1337
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:26,670
That Christmas you see
in magazines or...

1338
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:29,410
-Social media.
-It doesn't exist.

1339
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:32,630
Christmas is just
a bunch of imperfect people

1340
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:37,550
getting together and doing
their best to celebrate life.

1341
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:41,070
-It's just, ever since
Daniel's dad and I got divorced,

1342
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,770
I've been pushing so hard.

1343
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:46,430
-You're doing great.

1344
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:49,340
-Why are you being
so nice to me?

1345
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:51,910
-Because I've been
where you are,

1346
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:54,740
and when I needed help,
people stepped in.

1347
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,580
-What is it?

1348
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:06,840
-I'm so sorry,
I shouldn't have told James

1349
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,800
that you were getting
back together with your ex.

1350
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,930
-You what?
-Please don't hate me.

1351
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:12,500
-No.

1352
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,460
I don't hate you.
I just...

1353
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,150
It makes sense.

1354
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,810
-I mean, you just show up here,
lost and broke,

1355
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:21,510
all, "Oh, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1356
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,600
I'll just bake cookies, I guess.

1357
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,950
And I'm so pretty and angry

1358
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,900
and interesting because
I live in Chicago."

1359
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,250
-Okay, that's one take
on the situation.

1360
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,340
-Nobody helps me do anything.

1361
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:34,650
And then you come here
and you push people away,

1362
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,610
and then they help you,
and you don't even have to ask.

1363
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:39,090
I mean, how do you do that?

1364
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:41,920
-Honestly, I have no idea,
but you're totally right.

1365
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,660
-And you were rude to James,
and he just liked you more.

1366
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,180
-How can we help you?

1367
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:49,660
-Can you say that part
about James again?

1368
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:53,800
-I just get lonely sometimes.

1369
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,150
I'm so sorry that
I've been so...

1370
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:59,670
-Caitlin, how can we help?

1371
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,550
-Are you serious?

1372
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,900
-You have to let people
in sometimes.

1373
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:05,420
I had to learn that, too.

1374
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,600
-And what better time
than at Christmas?

1375
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,640
-Well.

1376
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:15,650
I guess James has
the pine-bough decorations,

1377
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:18,820
but the lights aren't up,
the stage isn't set,

1378
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:22,610
and I have no drinks ready
and no desserts.

1379
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,390
-Okay.

1380
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,610
We're in emergency mode.

1381
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,700
Operation Snow Ball.

1382
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,620
Don't roll your eyes at me.

1383
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:33,450
This is big, people.
Let's get to work.

1384
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,810
-Mmm!

1385
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,210
Whoo!

1386
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,380
Carol, you have really
outdone yourself

1387
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,990
with this eggnog!

1388
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,870
The belle of the ball!
-Oh, stop.

1389
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:29,690
-Oh!

1390
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,430
Think you can make room
on your dance card for me?

1391
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,220
-Always.

1392
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:36,270
-All right, you two lovebirds.
Let's go.

1393
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:39,140
-Oh sweetheart, you look lovely.
-Oh, thanks, Mom.

1394
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,750
But look at you.

1395
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:43,230
-You're both beautiful!

1396
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:46,450
Look at me, I'm all hopped up
on Christmas cheer.

1397
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,450
-What did you put
in his nog, mom?

1398
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,450
-Come here.

1399
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:53,240
We have loved
having you home, darling.

1400
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,150
-Aww, thanks, Dad.

1401
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,500
And I was wondering,
if it's not too big of a pain,

1402
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:00,460
if Ginger and I stayed
through New Year's?

1403
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:03,080
-Not at all.
We'd love to have you.

1404
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,470
-Does this mean you're staying
in Aspen Grove?

1405
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,120
-Yeah, I guess it does.

1406
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:12,870
-Oh, our family all together
in the same town.

1407
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:14,520
We couldn't be happier.

1408
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,520
-Well, I promise I won't
stay too long.

1409
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:18,260
I know you two like
your privacy.

1410
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:21,090
-Mm, that's true, we do.
-Little bit. Yeah, we do.

1411
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,960
-All right, I get it.
You're in love.

1412
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:25,400
Knock it off. Let's go.

1413
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,290
-I feel like I got
my sister back.

1414
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:41,720
The one who loved
Christmas so much

1415
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,290
and believed anything
was possible.

1416
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:45,860
I missed her.

1417
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,550
-Well, who knew that having
your heart broken

1418
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,300
and losing everything
and then baking and baking...

1419
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,780
-And baking.

1420
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,910
-...could do that to you?

1421
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,610
Merry Christmas, Grace.

1422
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,000
-Merry Christmas, Felicity.

1423
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,960
-Doors open in five.
Where's Caitlin?

1424
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,440
-Poor thing.

1425
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,310
-She's got a lot of expectations
to sleep off, I guess.

1426
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,360
-It's a shame
we do that to ourselves.

1427
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,270
-Doesn't really fit in with
the holiday season, does it?

1428
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,890
You end up missing out
on the best time of year.

1429
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:15,760
-Oh, can I get you and Maddie
in the photo booth

1430
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,020
before there's a line?

1431
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,760
-Absolutely.

1432
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,370
Wait just one minute, though.

1433
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,200
-Just one?

1434
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:28,200
-One minute is literally
all this should take.

1435
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,820
-Grace.

1436
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:36,860
Grace.

1437
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:39,820
-James, Felicity is
obsessed with you.

1438
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:42,700
I haven't seen my sister
so happy in years.

1439
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,830
-But Brian...
-Forget Brian.

1440
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:47,660
She has, I have, we all have.

1441
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:50,660
He's back in Chicago.
She sent him away.

1442
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,400
-You did?

1443
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,840
-Yeah.

1444
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,540
-Kids, get it together.

1445
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,500
Talk.

1446
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,800
Merry Christmas.

1447
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,200
-Ooh, look at you!

1448
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,640
-Hey.
-Hey!

1449
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,720
-Did it work?
-Yes.

1450
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,860
-I thought you guys
were getting back together.

1451
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,640
-I thought you didn't want
somebody so lost and confused.

1452
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,990
-I don't.

1453
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,430
But that's not you, is it?

1454
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,210
-No.

1455
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:25,000
I know what I want.

1456
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,260
I want to stay in Aspen Grove.

1457
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:29,310
I want to bake.

1458
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:32,490
And I want to do things my way
in my business.

1459
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:34,530
-No kidding.

1460
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:38,840
-But I also want to do it with
a little help from my friends.

1461
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,060
-That's good news.

1462
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,540
-Why is that?

1463
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,240
-'Cause you're gonna need
the best butter

1464
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,150
in the state of Wisconsin,

1465
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:49,330
and I just so happen to know
a nice guy who can help you out.

1466
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:51,330
-Oh, do you?
-Yeah.

1467
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:54,720
Felicity, whose name means
delight and joy.

1468
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:57,030
-I am not always delightful.

1469
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:00,030
-Yes, you are.

1470
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,690
-Look.

1471
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:07,480
-Well, that weed
just won't quit, will it?

1472
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:05,800
'Cause that's where I wanna be

1473
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:15,340
- Want

1474
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:18,830
- Want
