(ambient music)

00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:09,262
(atmosphere rumbling)

3
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:11,746
(paper rustling)

4
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:15,171
(paper airplane whooshing)

5
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:17,754
(wind howling)

6
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:27,587
(gentle piano music)

7
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,401
(heartbeat pumping)

8
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:07,467
(woman sighing)

9
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,125
- [Woman] How're you doing, baby?

10
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:09,958
- Mmm.

11
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:12,400
(woman gasping)

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,670
- Holy crap, you look hot.

13
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,503
- Yeah?

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,273
Too hot?

15
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:19,800
- No, like classy hot.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm just so used to seeing you
dolling up the other girls,

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,450
I never see you all dolled up yourself.

18
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,200
Oh, you look perfect, baby.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,033
- Thanks, Mom.

20
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:34,998
(eerie music)

21
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:43,038
Mom?

22
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:44,141
Mom!
(ominous music)

23
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:45,490
Mom!

24
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,626
No, no, no, no!

25
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:47,459
Mom!

26
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:48,317
Mom?

27
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,078
No, no, no, no, no, Mom.

28
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:50,911
Help!

29
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:53,226
Please, help us!

30
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:55,539
I don't know what happened,

31
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,697
she just collapsed.
- Mom?

32
00:01:56,697 --> 00:01:57,955
- Someone call 911!

33
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:59,415
- Jesus.
- Mom?

34
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:00,928
Mommy?
- Rachel.

35
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:02,161
- Mom?

36
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:02,994
- Daddy.

37
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:04,267
(ominous music)

38
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,100
- No!

39
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,767
No!

40
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,017
- Do something!

41
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:13,409
(Rachel gasping)

42
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,909
(eerie music)

43
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:23,815
(cricket chirping)

44
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:55,352
- Oh, shit.

45
00:02:57,606 --> 00:03:01,766
(birds chirping)
(distant dog barking)

46
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,510
- [TV Host] Which have
been also dusted in flower

47
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,813
but not just to absorb
any excess moisture.

48
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:10,285
- Uh oh.

49
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:13,417
"Great British Bake Off."

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,893
What's up?

51
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,840
- Nothing.

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,333
- Come on, babe, you
know you can talk to me.

53
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:23,970
- It's just, it's like...

54
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,700
It's a lot of pressure on me, you know?

55
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,533
- I know.

56
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,290
But we're in it together no
matter what happens, right?

57
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,240
Okay, I gotta go get ready.

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,233
I have that shoot with that
new bag company this morning.

59
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,823
Are you gonna try and work today?

60
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,963
Okay then, I will see you later.

61
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,143
- It came.

62
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,032
- What?

63
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:58,990
- I went to the bathroom
this morning and it came.

64
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,600
My period, my uterus just
wasted another 30-fucking-grand.

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,433
- Are your sure?

66
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,030
- Amber.

67
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,863
- Okay.

68
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,450
Was it like...

69
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,752
Was it a full period or was it,
I don't know, like spotting?

70
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:18,160
- I mean, it was...

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,770
I guess like spotting but
I still, I have cramps,

72
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,950
and then my back hurts and then...

73
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,360
- Okay, do you remember
what Dr. Fern said to us

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,380
when we did our first cycle?

75
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,880
- I know he said a lot before
we gave him all our money.

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,880
- I know but he said to us
that spotting and cramping

77
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,433
could be a sign of
successful implantation.

78
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,113
- You sure?

79
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:45,070
- I am sure that that is what he said.

80
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,880
So I am not trying to get our hopes up

81
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,450
but there's no reason
to get down yet, so...

82
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:52,895
Come on.
- What?

83
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:54,995
- Come on, you're gonna go pee on a stick.

84
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:57,700
- [Rachel] I love peeing on sticks.

85
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,139
- [Amber] Yes, we love them, all of them.

86
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,711
- [Rachel] There's a variety
of ways to pee on a stick.

87
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,461
(Amber laughing)

88
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,523
- Okay.

89
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:09,910
(gentle music)
40 more seconds.

90
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,880
- Okay, please, please
don't get too excited.

91
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,460
- Oh, I'm not.

92
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,293
I'm not.
- You are!

93
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:15,710
You're getting all smiley and stuff.

94
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,365
- I'm so sorry.
(Amber laughing)

95
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:18,757
- No.
- I'm sorry.

96
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:19,996
- You're gonna get my hopes up.

97
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:22,090
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay.

98
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,720
Look, look, mmm.

99
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,890
No smiles and no hope.

100
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,920
- Seriously.

101
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,370
Dr. Fern said we shouldn't even bother

102
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,550
with home pregnancy tests.

103
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,023
- No, that is not what he said, babe.

104
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:33,783
What he said was he didn't
want us obsessing over it.

105
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,270
You know, like taking a test every day.

106
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,763
It's okay for us to take one.

107
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:39,407
- Well it's easy for you to say.

108
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:42,390
It's not your fault when it
turns out to be negative.

109
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,223
- Babe.

110
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:45,280
No, no, no, no.

111
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,733
It won't be anybody's
fault, no matter what.

112
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,520
And I'm here for you, okay?

113
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,050
So I will calm down and chill out.

114
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,770
- I'm sorry, I just, you
know, you get anxious

115
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,196
and then you start feeling this thing.

116
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:01,820
(phone dinging)
(pleasant music)

117
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,653
- Okay.

118
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,413
That's time.

119
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,482
Here we go.

120
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:08,899
- Oh God, please.

121
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,433
- [Amber] Oh my God.

122
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,521
- It's two lines!

123
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:16,354
It's positive!

124
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:17,187
- It's positive?

125
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:18,137
- It's positive!
- It's positive!

126
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:20,207
- It's positive, oh my god!

127
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,409
Oh my god, oh my god!

128
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,769
Oh my god, Amber!

129
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:26,063
(pleasant music)

130
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,000
God, we're gonna be parents.
- Yeah.

131
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:30,907
Holy...

132
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:31,941
Baby!

133
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:33,403
(Rachel and Amber laughing)

134
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:34,310
- Oh my god!

135
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,403
- Congratulations, you're pregnant.

136
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,498
(Rachel laughing)

137
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:40,880
(doorbell ringing)

138
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,490
- Hey, big sis.

139
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,816
- Oh, no thank you, no, not for me.

140
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,186
- What, you pregnant?

141
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:47,394
- Gary!

142
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:48,227
Shut up.

143
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:49,060
- Oh my god!

144
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,816
Are you guys seriously pregnant right now?

145
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:53,539
(Rachel chuckling)

146
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,600
- Yeah.
(Amber laughing)

147
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,061
- [Gary] To us!

148
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,162
(glasses clinking)

149
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:59,870
(doorbell ringing)
(couple laughing)

150
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,280
- Okay, Mom and Dad, this
one is from the two of us,

151
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,870
for you guys.
- Oh.

152
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,060
- Happy anniversary.

153
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,010
- Oh, thank you, that's so sweet.

154
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,976
What is it, what is it?

155
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:12,077
(Rachel chuckling)

156
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:15,933
(pleasant violin music)

157
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,401
(mom gasping)
(Amber giggling)

158
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:18,348
A baby!

159
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,305
(Rachel vomiting)

160
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:23,638
(pleasant violin music)

161
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,339
(doorbell ringing)

162
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,820
- Hey!

163
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,600
Does it not totally suck
not being able to drink?

164
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Because I feel like it would totally suck

165
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,900
if I couldn't drink.

166
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,150
- Congrats!

167
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,983
You're so brave.

168
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:42,130
I would never be able to
bring a child into this world,

169
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,693
what, with everything that's going on.

170
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:45,110
(Rachel gagging)

171
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,220
- So, did you guys do the whole IVF thing

172
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,220
or did you find some dude to
do it the old fashion way?

173
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:56,511
(Rachel vomiting)

174
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:01,073
(toilet flushing)

175
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:04,406
(pleasant violin music)

176
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,756
(bird squawking)

177
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,740
- Okay, the gel's gonna
be a little cold at first.

178
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,767
- Oh.

179
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:15,100
(doctor laughing)

180
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,183
There we are.

181
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:18,800
(computer humming)

182
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,633
You ready?

183
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:26,151
Here we go.

184
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:31,669
Okay, so...

185
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,203
This is baby's brain.

186
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,391
- Oh, wow.

187
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:40,750
(doctor chuckling)

188
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,763
That's incredible.

189
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,870
- Just gonna grab a few
images while we're here

190
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,080
so we can measure everything.

191
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,729
And here is baby's heartbeat.

192
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,980
(heartbeat thumping)

193
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,890
It sounds great.

194
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,733
Now for the big spoiler alert.

195
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,470
Do you wanna know the sex?

196
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,130
- Yes.

197
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,351
It's a girl.

198
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:04,928
- Oh.
(Amber laughing)

199
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:06,077
- A girl?
- Yeah.

200
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,050
- [Mom] That's wonderful.

201
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,590
- [Amber] Wait till you see her.

202
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,770
- Oh, I wanna see her.

203
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,603
- It's...

204
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,973
- Show us.

205
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,090
- Look at that.

206
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:16,916
Look at that.

207
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,787
- Oh, would you look at her.

208
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:19,660
(father chuckling)

209
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,996
Isn't she previous?

210
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:22,890
- [Amber] Oh wow.

211
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,790
- Can you believe?

212
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:26,320
(ominous music)

213
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,303
What is that?

214
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:29,863
- What?

215
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:31,423
- Is that a face?

216
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,143
- Oh wow.

217
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,433
- There, in the corner.

218
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,003
Doesn't that look like your mother, Rach?

219
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,935
Or am I crazy?

220
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,040
(eerie music)

221
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,490
- No, it looks just like her.

222
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:52,128
(eerie music)

223
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,830
- [Dad] Spooky.

224
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,663
- Daddy!

225
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,967
- But...

226
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:04,830
How is...

227
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,520
- Rach, it's probably just a coincidence.

228
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,363
You know, the shadows and the
lights and the ultrasound.

229
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,703
- You wanna know what I think?

230
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,500
I think it's a blessing.
(gentle piano music)

231
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,243
I think it's a sign from
God that she's still here.

232
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,480
- [Amber] I love that, Mom.

233
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,253
- Thank you.

234
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:31,970
(ominous music)

235
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,310
- Oh.

236
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,836
Rach...

237
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:35,670
- What?
- Your nose.

238
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,890
- Oh.
- It's bleeding.

239
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,010
- Honey, can I help you?

240
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,860
- I'm sorry, I...

241
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,420
Just excuse me.

242
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,340
Sorry.

243
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,630
- Rach.
- Oh, I got it, I got it.

244
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,853
It's fine, I got it.

245
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:50,553
(ominous music)
- [Amber] I love you guys.

246
00:10:50,553 --> 00:10:51,386
- We love you too.

247
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:52,320
- [Mom] Bye-bye.

248
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,153
- [Amber] Drive safe.

249
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,653
- We will.
- We will.

250
00:10:57,683 --> 00:11:00,350
(Amber yawning)

251
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,653
- [Amber] Well, that got a little weird.

252
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,870
- I just saw my dead mom's
face in our sonogram.

253
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,070
Sorry, I don't really know
how to feel about that.

254
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,210
- Rachel, I told you it was just--

255
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,480
- I know, it's shapes and shadows.

256
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,850
Look, I know, I know, I know
that's what it is but...

257
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,823
I mean, it looks exactly like her.

258
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,490
That can't be a coincidence.

259
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,740
I mean, it can't.

260
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,580
- Okay, so what if it is?

261
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,820
Come on, your mom was like
the nicest person I know

262
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,413
and that includes you.

263
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:35,840
Look, I'm just gonna go ahead and say that

264
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,670
if your mom's face is popping
up in our daughter's sonogram,

265
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,243
well, I'm gonna take that as a good thing.

266
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:46,000
Like maybe my mom was right

267
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,863
and maybe this is a kind of blessing.

268
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,483
A sign that your mom is watching
over our little daughter.

269
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,350
- You know you're the best, right?

270
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,783
- I try.

271
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:01,590
(Rachel chuckling)

272
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,603
- Maybe it's a sign that we
should name her after her.

273
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,653
Little Sarah?

274
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:11,285
(pleasant music)

275
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,020
- I really love that.

276
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,170
- Really?

277
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,770
- Yeah, of course.

278
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,700
(Rachel laughing)

279
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,653
I love Sarah.

280
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:26,264
(pleasant music)

281
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,617
- Excuse me.

282
00:12:34,617 --> 00:12:36,520
(ominous music)

283
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Hi.

284
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,280
Can I please get a decaf Americano?

285
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,850
- [Barista] What size can I get you?

286
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,730
- [Rachel] Medium.

287
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,563
Thanks.

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,003
- Bet I can guess.

289
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,330
- Sorry?

290
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,630
- Bet I can guess the sex.

291
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:58,180
(heartbeat thumping)

292
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,760
Girl.

293
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,930
- Wrong.

294
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,230
Thanks for playing though.

295
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,785
- [Barista] Medium caramel macchiato.

296
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,238
(unsettling music)

297
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:09,071
Hello?

298
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,760
Caramel macchiato.

299
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,010
- I think that's for you.

300
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,470
- You know,

301
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,070
you shouldn't be carrying all those bags.

302
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,750
- I appreciate your concern
but I'm fine, thanks.

303
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,050
- Put on a jacket at least, it's chilly.

304
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,440
- I'm perfectly comfortable,
yeah, but thanks.

305
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,574
- Put on a goddamn jacket!

306
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:35,324
(sinister music)

307
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,820
Uh...

308
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,280
Oh.

309
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,810
Are you okay?

310
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,653
I'm sorry.

311
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,480
Ma'am, you...

312
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,098
You have a...

313
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:52,598
(eerie music)

314
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,173
- It's really good, we're doing great.

315
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:03,370
(door creaking)

316
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,445
Can you believe you're gonna be an uncle?

317
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,200
(Amber laughing)

318
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,283
No we're not.

319
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,860
Um...

320
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,780
Hey, can I call you back later?

321
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,930
Yeah, Rach just got home.

322
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,070
Okay, love you.
(dramatic music)

323
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,503
Are you, oh my god.

324
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,392
What happened?

325
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:23,750
- I don't know.

326
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,571
There was a guy at the
coffee shop and he just--

327
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:27,404
- [Amber] Jeez.

328
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:28,720
- My nose started bleeding
and, I don't know,

329
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,360
I just freaked out.
- Okay, okay, okay.

330
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,386
You're home, you're home, you're safe.

331
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:33,853
But, first of all, what guy?

332
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,678
Wow.

333
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:37,537
What a fucking asshole.

334
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:39,563
It's not even like it's that cold outside.

335
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,293
I'm sorry, babe, I know
that's not the point.

336
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,600
- It's not just him though, you know.

337
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,850
Everybody's been treating me weird.

338
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,850
It's like I'm not...

339
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,100
I'm not a person.

340
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,293
I'm just this incubator.

341
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,490
- Hey.

342
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,823
Of course you're a person.

343
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,563
You are the best kind of person.

344
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,810
As a matter of fact,

345
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,410
you are my favorite kind of person.

346
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,140
- I don't mean you, I mean everybody else.

347
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,300
I mean, our friends and your family

348
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,540
and random strangers.

349
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,373
It's just...

350
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,520
Everybody keeps treating
me like I don't know

351
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,200
how to take care of myself.

352
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,310
- Babe, that is just the way

353
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,183
the world treats pregnant ladies.

354
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,830
But look, I've said it before
and I will say it again.

355
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,430
If it's not you and
it's not me, screw them.

356
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,380
We don't need help.

357
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,973
Right?

358
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,773
- Yeah.

359
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,920
- Look, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way

360
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,730
but do you think that
maybe there's a chance

361
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,730
that our friends and my parents,
they just wanna support you

362
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,930
but it's a little hard for
you to accept that support

363
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,300
because you didn't grow
up with a big family?

364
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,990
- What does that have to do with anything?

365
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,290
- No, I just mean,

366
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,590
for a really long time it
was just you and your mom

367
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,580
and now she's gone.

368
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,580
But my parents and our
friends, we're your family too.

369
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,260
And, although we may not
always say the right thing,

370
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,573
we mean well.

371
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,593
- Really?

372
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:20,863
Okay, so it's my fault.

373
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,150
- Oh wow.

374
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,470
Rachel, that is not what I said at all.

375
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,303
- Okay.

376
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:28,136
Just

377
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,170
listen.

378
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,690
I am the one who has to go through this

379
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,923
and it is hard.

380
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,710
So I would appreciate it if
I felt like you had my back.

381
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,083
- I do have your back.

382
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,553
I always have your back.

383
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,617
I am just worried...

384
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:49,960
(dramatic music)

385
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,930
I am just worried that you're
gonna push everyone away

386
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,530
like you did when your mom died.

387
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,291
- And there it is.

388
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,943
- Rachel.

389
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:02,776
Rach, wait, oh...

390
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,140
I'm sorry.

391
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,890
This is all coming out wrong.

392
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,690
Okay, listen, what I should've said,

393
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,060
what I should've said was,
the hell with that guy.

394
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,310
The hell with anyone
that looks at you funny.

395
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
It doesn't matter, they don't matter,

396
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,280
because the only thing that matters

397
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,063
is you, me and this baby.

398
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,503
Our baby.

399
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,450
The three of us.

400
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,940
Okay, that is it.

401
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,773
I'm sorry.

402
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:39,862
(unsettling music)

403
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:57,607
(gentle piano music)

404
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,349
(sinister music)

405
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:32,200
- [Female Host] And it's still breathing.

406
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,380
Look at that fresh, fresh cherry.

407
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,730
- [Male Host] Nice to see both sides.

408
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,190
- She's going to take it.
(Rachel gasping)

409
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,023
- Mom?

410
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:41,943
- She's going to take the baby.

411
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:43,781
- What're you--

412
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:46,150
- You have to stop her.

413
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,371
- Who?

414
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,950
(Rachel groaning)
(ominous music)

415
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,743
- She knows I'm here.

416
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,270
She won't let me talk to you.

417
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,860
You can't let her take the baby.

418
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,817
Don't let her control you!

419
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,723
- Mom.

420
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,643
Mom.

421
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:10,857
- Rachel.

422
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:13,841
Rachel.

423
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,892
Rachel.

424
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,037
- [Amber] Rachel?

425
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:25,037
- Mom!
(sinister music)

426
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:28,417
What happened?

427
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,010
- No, everything's fine, you're fine.

428
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,818
- No, my mom was just--
- No.

429
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:34,280
- She was right here.
- No, honey.

430
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,140
No, you were just having a nightmare.

431
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,973
Come here.

432
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,870
It's just a bad dream.

433
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,410
- She was here.

434
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,936
- No, you're fine.

435
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:45,936
Everything's fine, okay?

436
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:50,637
(dramatic string music)

437
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,480
- [Woman] Rachel?

438
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,760
- She's here.

439
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,990
Babe, you're up.

440
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,290
(phone chiming)
(ominous music)

441
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,720
- If you have to take it, just...

442
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,970
- It's just the agency.
- It's fine.

443
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,950
- I'll be right there, I promise.

444
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,783
- Okay.

445
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,970
- [Amber] Hey you guys, hold on.

446
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,877
Let me step out, I'm
in the doctor's office.

447
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:21,874
- Yeah.

448
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,010
Looks good.

449
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,206
Any headaches?

450
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:27,039
- Huh?

451
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,660
No.

452
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,120
- Also good.

453
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,400
Yeah, I don't think there's anything

454
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,520
to worry too much about.

455
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,870
- Dr. Fern, I don't see how you think

456
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,950
it's nothing to worry about.

457
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,550
- Look, I didn't say it's
nothing to worry about,

458
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,360
I said it's nothing to
worry too much about.

459
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,053
Nose bleeds are a common
symptom of pregnancy.

460
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,420
- Dr. Fern, if you'd
seen it, you'd know that

461
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,163
there was nothing common about it.

462
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,350
- I know it must've been very scary.

463
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,980
A nose can bleed a lot but
I assure you it's fine.

464
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,797
Just hormones and stress.

465
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:02,580
- Hormones and stress.

466
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,453
- That's right.

467
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:06,580
- What if it's not just
hormones and stress?

468
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,370
What if it's like a brain tumor

469
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,636
or something like an aneurism?

470
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,390
- The billing department would love for me

471
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,130
to order a bunch of tests to rule out

472
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,730
that very unlikely possibility

473
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,630
but I'm telling you
it's just not necessary.

474
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,820
At least, not yet.

475
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,920
It's my opinion as your doctor

476
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,950
that the best course of action is for us

477
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,190
to just keep an eye on things

478
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,263
and try to avoid all stressors.

479
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,420
Okay, all right, if it'll
make you feel better,

480
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,690
I can order up some blood work

481
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,710
but I really don't think you need it.

482
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,340
You're taking your pre-natals, right?

483
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,390
- Yeah.

484
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,223
- Good.

485
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,093
Let's give her a listen, shall we?

486
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:53,189
Okay.

487
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:57,382
(heartbeat thumping)

488
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,465
(gentle piano music)

489
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,888
(eerie music)

490
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,523
- Um...

491
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:20,051
Dr. Fern?

492
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:21,166
Dr. Fern, is there something wrong

493
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,145
with the baby's heartbeat?

494
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:25,645
(eerie music)

495
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:27,335
What're you?

496
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:30,741
(pen scratching)

497
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:31,574
Doctor?

498
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,710
Dr. Fern, are you all right?

499
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,682
(pen scratching)
What're you...

500
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:36,515
Dr. Fern?

501
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:45,857
- All hail the Lilith.

502
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,404
(sinister music)

503
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:51,237
Long live

504
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:54,276
the first mother.

505
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:57,061
(intense music)

506
00:22:57,061 --> 00:23:00,169
(Rachel screaming)

507
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:03,540
(Rachel gasping)

508
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,457
(blood squelching)

509
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:12,974
(Rachel screaming)

510
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:13,878
- [Nurse] Oh my God!

511
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:15,062
Dr. Fern!

512
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:15,895
Ah!

513
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,177
Dr. Fern!

514
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:19,844
(ominous music)

515
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,227
- "Hail Lilith.

516
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:26,797
"Long live the first mother."

517
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,060
What does that mean?

518
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,490
- How should I know?

519
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,853
- You feeling okay, Ms. Robins?

520
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,305
- I just wanna go home.

521
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:40,296
- Listen,

522
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:42,310
we wanna get you out of
here as soon as we can.

523
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,150
We need to make sure
we don't miss anything.

524
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,720
So let's just go over
it one last time, okay?

525
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,553
- Come on, again?

526
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,780
I've already told you everything 10 times.

527
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,640
- We just need to make sure

528
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,460
that we don't miss
anything for the record.

529
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,257
- Well I told you everything.
(ominous music)

530
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:01,480
- You said Dr. Fern was
fine during the appointment

531
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,430
until the very end.

532
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:05,800
Then he started acting weird.

533
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,401
- Weird how?

534
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:09,913
(eerie music)

535
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:12,530
- Just like I told you, he got all quiet

536
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,363
and he...

537
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,080
He wouldn't look at me.

538
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:20,134
And then he started like scribbling

539
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,603
really hard in his notebook.

540
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,423
He was acting like a robot.

541
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,473
- Like a robot?

542
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,143
- I don't think he was a robot, okay,

543
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:39,130
I think he was acting like a robot.

544
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,390
He was stiff, I don't
know how else to say it.

545
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,410
He was acting odd,

546
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,243
creepy.

547
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:46,080
- [Peters] Weird?

548
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,753
- Was it out of the blue or was there,

549
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,610
was there a trigger?

550
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,710
What set him off?

551
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,827
- I don't know, I don't
know what set him off.

552
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:00,327
(eerie music)

553
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,263
- Kinda looks like you just
thought of something there.

554
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:09,960
- No, I don't know, I don't
know what set him off.

555
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,843
- You sure?

556
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,733
- Yeah, I'm sure.

557
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:17,235
- All right.

558
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,703
So what then?

559
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,050
Then he just stabbed himself.

560
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,483
- Four times in the neck.

561
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,720
- I don't know how many times
he stabbed himself, okay?

562
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,940
- But he did all the stabbing.

563
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,560
- Yes!

564
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,283
He did this to himself.

565
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,600
- And that blood is?

566
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,080
- This?

567
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,230
It's from a nose bleed.

568
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,960
Look, I swear I never touched him.

569
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,205
- So why did he do that?

570
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:47,160
- God.

571
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,593
- We talked to his
coworkers, his girlfriend,

572
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,640
none of them believe it was suicide.

573
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,190
Apparently, he was a happy guy.

574
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,140
Why off himself?

575
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,000
- How should I know?

576
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,903
I don't know!

577
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,833
He just...

578
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:04,046
(gentle piano music)

579
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,450
- Who kills themself with
a pen to the jugular?

580
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,473
Who does that?

581
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,347
- [Peters] Well, Dr. Noah Fern for one.

582
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:17,500
(ominous music)

583
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,697
- So you're buying it?

584
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,180
- Kwan,

585
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,033
you made detective two years ago.

586
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,363
I'm going on 20 years.

587
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:27,880
I guarantee you'll see plenty of suicides

588
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,980
weirder than this one.

589
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,580
- Everyone said he was a happy guy.

590
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,110
- Everyone always says he was a happy guy.

591
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,300
Nobody wants to admit they
missed the warning signs.

592
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,650
And the scene backs her up.

593
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:42,951
There's no way she stabbed him,

594
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:44,770
put the pen in his hand without
getting any blood on her

595
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,980
and fingerprints all
over him, there's no way.

596
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,155
- But there is blood on her.

597
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:52,336
You really believe that's a nose bleed?

598
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:54,430
- That's what it looks like to me.

599
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,580
- Let's just wait for forensics

600
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,000
to tell us what they find out.

601
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,683
- We can't hold her that long.

602
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,940
She's pregnant, for Christ's sake.

603
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,983
Be lucky if she doesn't sue as is.

604
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:06,399
Nah.

605
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:09,020
The call on the field is good, suicide.

606
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,103
Let's go get a beer.

607
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,820
- They can't just do this, you know.

608
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,730
They can't just arrest you

609
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,150
without letting you call somebody!

610
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,570
- Look, I wasn't arrested, okay?

611
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,800
They just held me for questioning.

612
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,110
- Well they shouldn't be
able to do that either.

613
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,700
No, they shouldn't be
able to just hold anybody,

614
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,050
much less, a traumatized pregnant lady!

615
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,883
- I'm okay.

616
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,003
I'll be okay.

617
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,570
Look, I'm just really tired
and I kinda just wanna go home.

618
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,403
- I'm sorry.

619
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,530
I'm sorry, I should've been there.

620
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,140
I should've been there with you.

621
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,680
Never let you go in there alone.

622
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,763
None of this would've happened.

623
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:50,592
- [Rachel] It's okay.

624
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,200
Hey.

625
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,033
We're okay.

626
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,533
We're okay.

627
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:02,605
(crickets chirping)

628
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,363
- Hey, you want some more noodles?

629
00:28:08,823 --> 00:28:09,656
Okay.

630
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,483
Come on, Rach, you gotta eat something.

631
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,000
Especially because you are
not just eating for you now.

632
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,683
You are eating for two.

633
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,563
- Of course.

634
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,530
I almost forgot.

635
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,967
(fork clanking)

636
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:30,800
Mmmm.

637
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,630
Mmmm, this is so good.

638
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,463
- Hey.

639
00:28:34,316 --> 00:28:36,225
I'm not trying to fight with you.

640
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:38,300
You know, I just need you
to take care of yourself.

641
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,500
Not to mention, the baby--
- The baby, I know.

642
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,780
Yeah, I know.

643
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,890
You gotta take care of the baby.

644
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,723
I got it.

645
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,660
I'm sorry.

646
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,493
You're right.

647
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,660
I'll eat, okay?

648
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,573
See, see?

649
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,376
I'm eating.

650
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:58,826
(phone chiming)
- Thank you.

651
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,660
Oh, don't forget,

652
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,850
we have that new O.B. tomorrow.

653
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,535
We should probably leave around 10.

654
00:29:08,535 --> 00:29:10,270
(gentle string music)

655
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,250
Oh, hey.

656
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,330
I know that it's probably weird,

657
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,773
especially so soon after what happened.

658
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,140
- Why do you think he did it?

659
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:20,854
- [Amber] What do you mean?

660
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:22,760
- I mean, Dr. Fern.

661
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,953
Like, why do you think that
he did that in front of me?

662
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:29,593
You know, like--
- Rach.

663
00:29:31,324 --> 00:29:34,050
I really hate to see you
tormenting yourself like this.

664
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,920
- So what, I'm just
supposed to like forget it?

665
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,250
I'm sorry, I can't, I
can't stop seeing it.

666
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,200
You know?
- I know.

667
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,150
I know.

668
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,300
And, look, I can't even begin

669
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,250
to imagine how horrible it was for you.

670
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:50,800
But I just don't think it's a great idea,

671
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,090
or healthy for that matter,

672
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,750
to keep dwelling on it like this.

673
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,100
- Oh, that's what it is, right?

674
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
I'm boring you.

675
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,933
Okay.

676
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:58,400
- Come on, that's not what I said.

677
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,383
- No but it is what you meant, right?

678
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,700
See, you just want me to
shut up and stop complaining.

679
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,080
Well guess what,

680
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,090
I get to complain all I
want to, you know why?

681
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,010
Because I am going through
hell to give you this baby.

682
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,580
So you, you don't have to do shit.

683
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,413
You don't have

684
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:17,560
to sacrifice shit!
- Wow, you know what?

685
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,700
I'm not doing this with you.

686
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,743
Not tonight, Rach.

687
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,483
- Really?

688
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:24,495
You're just gonna get up and walk away?

689
00:30:24,495 --> 00:30:26,500
(dramatic music)

690
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,020
No, you know what, you don't!

691
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,783
Don't walk away from me like that!

692
00:30:34,607 --> 00:30:36,237
- "Give me this baby."
- Yeah.

693
00:30:36,237 --> 00:30:38,550
- "Give me this baby?"

694
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,780
Correct me if I'm wrong

695
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,173
but I thought you were doing this for us.

696
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,833
Rach, do you have any idea
how jealous I am of you?

697
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:48,850
- Ugh.

698
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,650
- Do you have any idea how
much I wish that I'm the one

699
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,590
that could be doing this.

700
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,240
- Spoken with the ease of
someone who isn't pregnant!

701
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,193
- That's not fair.

702
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,840
My career is our primary
source of income--

703
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,233
- Which you keep reminding me

704
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:06,333
all the time!
- And we talked about this!

705
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:11,237
- I know.

706
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,433
I know, I know, I know.

707
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,573
You're right, you're right.

708
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:20,150
I am, I'm doing this for...

709
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,137
For us, you know, I...

710
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,280
I'm glad we're doing it, I am.

711
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,190
It just, before I knew how
hard it was really gonna be--

712
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,790
- Which is why I've been
trying to be there for you!

713
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:39,201
And this entire time, what
do you think I'm doing?

714
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:40,953
I just want us to be happy.

715
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:44,460
(Rachel gasping)

716
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,910
- Wait.
- Rachel, what was that?

717
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,993
Did she just kick?

718
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:49,862
(Amber chuckling)

719
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:51,380
(ominous music)

720
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,240
Can I feel?

721
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,480
Oh my god.
- Wait, wait, wait.

722
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,510
- Why, what's?
- I just--

723
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,343
- What's wrong?

724
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:57,234
Are you okay?
- Maybe not right now.

725
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:58,490
- But can I just?

726
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,596
Let me--
- Don't!

727
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:02,976
(sinister music)

728
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:04,809
I'm sorry, I didn't...

729
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,723
- Wow.

730
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,440
What is going on with you?

731
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,340
- I know you're gonna think I'm crazy,

732
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:20,610
and maybe I am.

733
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,830
I can't stop feeling
like something is wrong

734
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,730
with this pregnancy.

735
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,243
- What do you mean, Rachel?

736
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,083
- I don't know.

737
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,200
It's just...

738
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,620
wrong.

739
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,100
I feel like I'm cursed, you know?

740
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:41,336
- You're not cursed, Rachel.

741
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,580
- Listen, listen,

742
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,340
Dr. Fern only started acting weird

743
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,240
after he heard the heartbeat of the baby.

744
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,100
Okay, it was the same thing at the guy,

745
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,340
with the guy at the coffee shop, you know?

746
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,560
Just listen to me!

747
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,330
What if, what if, what if...

748
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,080
What if it's not my mom?

749
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,569
- Wait, whoa!

750
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:00,540
(ominous music)

751
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,520
Let me stop you right there.

752
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,620
Are you actually trying
to tell me that you won't

753
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,920
let me feel our daughter
kick for the first time

754
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,633
because you think that
your uterus is haunted?

755
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,980
- So you do think I'm crazy.

756
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,180
- No, Rachel, let's
clear this up right now.

757
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,383
Because if it is,

758
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,330
let me be clear in what I am saying to you

759
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,523
because mine is actually
coming from love and concern.

760
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,593
You need to get your shit together.

761
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,940
- Excuse me?

762
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,033
- Yes, Rachel,

763
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,390
I said that.

764
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,490
Look, I am not gonna pretend

765
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,370
that I know everything
you're going through

766
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,780
but you need to stop acting like

767
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,110
I have not been here with
you this entire time.

768
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,360
Which is why I have to be honest with you

769
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,493
and tell you that this,
all of it, is delusional.

770
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,220
There's nothing wrong with our baby.

771
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,560
- Don't gaslight me, I
know what's happening!

772
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,480
- I'm not gaslighting you.

773
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,630
I am just trying to keep
you here in reality.

774
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,720
- The sonogram had a face!

775
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,510
- It was an optical
illusion and a coincidence

776
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,130
just like I have said every time!

777
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,563
Jesus, Rachel,

778
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:14,113
I just, I need you here on earth with me.

779
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,930
Both of us do.

780
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,460
- I'm sorry.

781
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,980
It's me, it's me.

782
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,794
It's me, I'm sorry.

783
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,948
(eerie music)

784
00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:25,521
I just...

785
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,354
I...

786
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:29,206
I don't know what's happening to me.

787
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:33,068
- And that's when Amber suggested

788
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:35,260
you try seeing a therapist?

789
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,310
- Yeah.

790
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,880
And she was right, I was just,

791
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,763
I just drag my heels about it, you know?

792
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,620
- It's not easy to ask for help.

793
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,940
I think you're doing a great job

794
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,390
coming here on a regular basis.

795
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,123
So now that time has passed,

796
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,010
what are your thoughts about all this?

797
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,573
- I just freaked out.

798
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,590
You know, I got in my head and...

799
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,830
Look, I know nothing
is wrong with the baby.

800
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,930
- You mentioned early on that
you saw your mother's face

801
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,638
in the ultrasound photo.

802
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,893
What was your mother like?

803
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:11,271
- My mom was the best.

804
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,403
We were real close.

805
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,540
She was my best friend.

806
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,540
We did everything together,
and now she's just...

807
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,643
Gone.

808
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:24,820
- It sounds like she was
a positive force for you.

809
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,660
- Yeah.

810
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,493
Huge.

811
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,900
- Was she ever a negative force?

812
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,833
- No, no, she was great.

813
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,283
- Never?

814
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,073
- Honestly, she was a great mom.

815
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,223
- [Therapist] Did she
get along with Amber?

816
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,580
- Oh, sure.

817
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,550
You know, they weren't
super tight or anything

818
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,278
but, yeah, they got along,
there's no problems.

819
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,793
- [Therapist] How about
the rest of your family?

820
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,720
- There is no rest of the family.

821
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,350
My mom's family was abusive to her,

822
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,170
so she ran away and she
never saw them again

823
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:08,123
and I never knew my dad.

824
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,581
So there was no dad side of the family.

825
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:14,216
(ominous music)

826
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:15,420
- Oh.

827
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,450
That must've been difficult.

828
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,018
Obviously, we need to talk
about all of this a lot more

829
00:36:21,018 --> 00:36:25,294
before I'd feel confident
saying anything concrete,

830
00:36:25,294 --> 00:36:27,071
but it seems like you are...

831
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:30,083
(unsettling music)

832
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:33,150
(pen scratching)

833
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,150
All hail the Lilith.

834
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,133
Long live the first mother.

835
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,110
- What did you say?

836
00:36:40,663 --> 00:36:43,610
- I was just saying we're
out of time for today.

837
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,580
But I think it's really positive for you

838
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,433
to keep talking about all this.

839
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,970
I feel like you should come back next week

840
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,510
for another session.

841
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,380
Is that okay?

842
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:57,791
(dramatic piano music)

843
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:27,490
(ominous music)

844
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,796
(thunder rumbling)

845
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:39,840
(dramatic program music)

846
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,600
- [TV Host] For thousands of years,

847
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,630
people have told stories about Lilith.

848
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,640
She appears in the mythology

849
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,860
of almost every ancient culture.

850
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,830
Some say she is the first vampire.

851
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,800
Some say she is a succubus.

852
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,150
Some say she was the
first woman, before Eve,

853
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,703
cast out of Eden after
refusing to submit to Adam.

854
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,360
Others, like members of the
Children of Lilith death cult

855
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,993
believe she is the wife of Satan.

856
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:13,993
- I believed it.

857
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,773
We all believed it.

858
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,973
Hell, I think even Mother
Lilith, whoever she really was,

859
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:25,283
I think she actually believed it herself.

860
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,540
She convinced us she was
thousands of years old.

861
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,920
That she was reborn into a new body

862
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,540
every 66 years and six months.

863
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,740
She told us if we devoted
ourselves to her and her husband,

864
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,360
the Dark Lord would adopt us

865
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,020
and give us places of
honor in the underworld.

866
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,880
She told us we would be
princes and princesses of hell.

867
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,180
People ask me, how can
you believe that stuff?

868
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:54,283
How dumb can you be?

869
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,830
I guess the answer is really fucking dumb.

870
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,620
Because I swallowed it,
hook, line and sinker.

871
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,580
I was just a kid when I met Mother Lilith.

872
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,604
Lost, looking for somebody to help me

873
00:39:07,604 --> 00:39:10,380
make sense of all of the fucked up shit

874
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,180
that happened to me when I was a kid.

875
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,180
She was really persuasive.

876
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,980
She had this way of just
getting into your head,

877
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,820
making you think a certain
way, do a certain thing.

878
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,563
Sometimes she didn't even need to say it.

879
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,080
She could just stare into your eyes

880
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,560
and put an idea into your head.

881
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,800
- [TV Host] Was she
hypnotizing her followers?

882
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,360
Brainwashing them?

883
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,740
Seducing them?

884
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,030
It depends who tells the story.

885
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,380
But every version ends the same,

886
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,290
with Mother Lilith leading
her so-called children

887
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,653
in ritual suicide.

888
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,260
On June 21, 1988,

889
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,950
at the Nevada Ranch that
the locals refer to,

890
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,340
in hushed tones, as the commune,

891
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,040
Mother Lilith lead her 46 followers

892
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,620
where they simultaneously
cut their own throats.

893
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,683
All but one perished.

894
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,940
- I remember waking up in an ambulance

895
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,493
thinking I was dead,

896
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,517
being transported to
the morgue or something.

897
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:16,843
And when I figured out I
was actually still alive,

898
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,400
I was heartbroken.

899
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,410
- [TV Host] It was a long road to recovery

900
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,420
for John Fletcher Jr,
physically and psychologically,

901
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,070
but after 30 years he
finally considers himself

902
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,360
to be a happy, healthy person.

903
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,663
Still, it seems he hasn't been
able to completely move on.

904
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,960
- When the FBI was done with the place,

905
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,940
they put it up for auction.

906
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,040
I had just signed this big
book deal, so I bought it.

907
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,600
At first, it was just a place to live.

908
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,010
I felt weird sleeping anywhere else.

909
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:49,380
It wasn't around, till around 2003 or so,

910
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,750
that I opened the museum,
started doing the ghost tours.

911
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,040
This is my museum area.

912
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,873
Oh, this?

913
00:40:56,873 --> 00:41:01,410
This was taken six
weeks before the ritual.

914
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,476
That's me standing right
next to Mother Lilith.

915
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:09,730
Ah, it was an amazing
day, I remember this day.

916
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,180
We had no idea what was coming.

917
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,381
- Wait.

918
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,137
(ominous music)

919
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:15,152
Mom?

920
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:16,933
- [John] Standing right
next to Mother Lilith.

921
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,219
(door creaking)
Ah, it was...

922
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:20,052
- [Amber] Home!

923
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:20,885
- [John] An amazing--

924
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:24,213
- Hi.

925
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:25,046
- Oh.

926
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,170
How are my girls?

927
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,880
- Oh, you know, we're
okay, how was your shoot?

928
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,770
- Well, they dressed me
like a hipster psychic,

929
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,580
so there's that.
(Rachel chuckling)

930
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,800
But everyone on set says hi.

931
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,027
They really miss you.

932
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:40,143
- Aw, that's sweet.

933
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,203
- How was therapy?

934
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,360
- Yeah, it was good, I think it helped.

935
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,411
- [Amber] Really?

936
00:41:46,411 --> 00:41:47,244
- Mm-hmm.

937
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:48,440
- Well I wanna hear all about it.

938
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,253
I mean, obviously, if
you wanna talk about it.

939
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,890
- Sure.
- Okay,

940
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,850
I will go get showered

941
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,560
and then you and I can order some sushi.

942
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,620
I am, oh, I'm sorry.

943
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,370
(Amber laughing)

944
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,923
No sushi for you.

945
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,813
How about we have some Thai?

946
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,703
Think about it.

947
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:13,080
(ominous music)

948
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:20,905
(entry bells ringing)

949
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,590
- Hi.

950
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,603
- Yes, come in.

951
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,163
- I'm Rachel.

952
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,893
- Sit.

953
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,833
You want to know about baby?

954
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,460
- Yes.

955
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,420
- You must pay first.

956
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,480
Sometimes people don't pay.

957
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,023
Now you must pay first.

958
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,300
- How much is it?

959
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,103
- 100 dollar, cash only.

960
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,540
I will only say once,

961
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,870
I am, how you say, the real deal.

962
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,170
Sometimes people don't pay

963
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,390
because they don't believe what they hear.

964
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,513
Sometimes they don't pay because
they do no want to believe.

965
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,010
Think hard before I take your money

966
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,681
and maybe you will not like what I say.

967
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:14,807
(eerie music)

968
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:15,640
- Okay.

969
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,193
Okay, okay.

970
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,623
I understand.

971
00:43:23,582 --> 00:43:24,853
- Good, then we begin.

972
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,830
Hands.

973
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:27,663
- [Rachel] Sorry?

974
00:43:27,663 --> 00:43:28,663
- Give me hands.

975
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,372
- [Rachel] Oh.

976
00:43:31,372 --> 00:43:33,872
(eerie music)

977
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,703
- Close eyes.

978
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,440
Your baby is girl, yes?

979
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,273
- Yes.

980
00:43:45,273 --> 00:43:47,350
- And you want to know
if baby is good girl

981
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,220
or not-so-good girl.

982
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,277
- I guess so, I just feel
like there's something that--

983
00:43:52,277 --> 00:43:53,110
(psychic shushing)

984
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:53,953
Let me listen.

985
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:56,510
(eerie music)

986
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,740
You already choose name, I hear a name.

987
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,573
Sarah.

988
00:44:00,548 --> 00:44:01,503
Is this for baby?

989
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,900
- Yes, how do you know that?
- This was your mother's name

990
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,793
and now you have chosen it for baby?

991
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,930
- How do you know that?

992
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,000
- You came because I know these things.

993
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,150
Just like I know that Sarah is good girl,

994
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,773
good, healthy girl.

995
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,297
But this other one,

996
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,170
not so good.

997
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,650
- Excuse me?

998
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,749
Other one?

999
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:30,110
There's not twins, it's just the one.

1000
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,840
I've had two doctors
confirm that it's not--

1001
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,493
- Not another baby, another
spirit inside there with her.

1002
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:37,677
Babcia.

1003
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:41,220
- Babcia?

1004
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,103
- Grandmother.

1005
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:44,630
You feel her, I know.

1006
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,540
Don't be scared.

1007
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,945
I told you, I'm real
deal, I know these things.

1008
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:52,695
(Rachel sighing)

1009
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,253
- Yes.

1010
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:57,543
Yes, I feel her.

1011
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,190
- Sometimes when a mother
dies with no grandchildren,

1012
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:08,010
her dusza, her soul, won't leave.

1013
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,150
Her spirit stays with us

1014
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:13,840
until her son or daughter has a baby.

1015
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,763
Only then will she move on.

1016
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:20,300
- Can you speak to her?

1017
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,390
- I can speak, I cannot
make her speak back.

1018
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,513
You have message?

1019
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,333
- Yes.

1020
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,340
Please tell her that I love her so much

1021
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,420
and I miss her and I wish that
she was here when the baby--

1022
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,890
- She already knows these
things, what is message?

1023
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,580
- Tell her to stop.
(eerie music)

1024
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:44,873
Whatever she's doing, whatever this is,

1025
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,170
people are getting hurt and I'm scared.

1026
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,144
- Babcia.

1027
00:45:53,144 --> 00:45:57,477
(psychic speaking foreign language)

1028
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,637
(unsettling music)

1029
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,320
She says she is not protecting your baby,

1030
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,520
she says she is protecting
her new skóra, her new skin.

1031
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,330
- What's that, what the
hell does that mean?

1032
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,890
- It means she is no babcia after all.

1033
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,130
She is demon, an evil spirit with no body.

1034
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,670
She waits to be reborn
inside your baby's skin.

1035
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:24,650
- No, no, it can't be a demon, it can't--

1036
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,750
- Don't worry, I will evict her.

1037
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,590
I am as I say, real deal.

1038
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,423
I will help.

1039
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:30,688
- Please.

1040
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:33,782
(ominous music)

1041
00:46:33,782 --> 00:46:35,500
(psychic yelling foreign language)

1042
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,760
Are you okay?

1043
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,933
- She won't let go!

1044
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:40,912
(psychic huffing)
(hand cracking)

1045
00:46:40,912 --> 00:46:43,205
(intense music)

1046
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:45,643
(bones crunching)
(psychic screaming)

1047
00:46:45,643 --> 00:46:48,154
(Rachel yelling)

1048
00:46:48,154 --> 00:46:52,571
(psychic screaming foreign language)

1049
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:56,275
(Rachel gasping)

1050
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:57,608
She's too strong!

1051
00:46:57,608 --> 00:46:59,110
(bones crunching)

1052
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,240
You must cut her out!

1053
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,810
You must get rid of her
before she is reborn

1054
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,104
or she will...

1055
00:47:04,104 --> 00:47:09,104
(psychic gagging)
(intense music)

1056
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,120
(Rachel whimpering)

1057
00:47:13,816 --> 00:47:16,566
(sinister music)

1058
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:22,005
(Rachel groaning)

1059
00:47:23,286 --> 00:47:26,786
(suspenseful tempo music)

1060
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:29,525
- No.

1061
00:47:29,525 --> 00:47:32,192
(Rachel crying)

1062
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:41,169
(ominous music)

1063
00:47:45,256 --> 00:47:46,089
No.

1064
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:48,755
I can't.

1065
00:47:48,755 --> 00:47:51,505
(Rachel sobbing)

1066
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,523
Why are you doing this to me?

1067
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:02,574
- Rach?

1068
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:04,252
Rach!

1069
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:05,513
Oh my god.

1070
00:48:05,513 --> 00:48:06,705
Rach, what happened?
- Don't.

1071
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:07,870
- Rach!

1072
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:08,703
Hey.

1073
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,290
Rachel, please, whatever it is,

1074
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,293
just, we can figure it out together.

1075
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,023
Please talk to me.

1076
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:16,856
- I can't.

1077
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,953
- Rachel.

1078
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,000
- You don't believe me.

1079
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,453
- I will believe you.

1080
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:25,350
Look, I don't care if you tell me

1081
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,193
you were abducted by aliens, okay?

1082
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,413
Please, just talk to me.

1083
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:37,597
(ominous music)

1084
00:48:37,597 --> 00:48:40,390
- I don't know what happened.

1085
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,683
I ran, I don't even remember driving home.

1086
00:48:45,584 --> 00:48:47,150
- Look, it's...

1087
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,270
I'm just glad that you're okay.

1088
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:51,120
- God, I didn't even try to help her.

1089
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:53,550
- Hey.

1090
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,543
That is completely understandable.

1091
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,523
Look, you were in shock.

1092
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,660
But I do think that we
need to call the cops now.

1093
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,890
We'll tell them that she had a seizure

1094
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,640
or a heart attack or something

1095
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,800
and that you panicked, so you ran.

1096
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,520
- No, Amber,

1097
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,083
we can't call the police.

1098
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,260
- We have to call the police, Rachel.

1099
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,330
- No, even if they don't arrest me,

1100
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,020
they're gonna keep me there
forever for questioning,

1101
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,853
you know that.

1102
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,720
Look, Madame Rose said the
only way to stop the demon

1103
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:29,450
was to get rid of it
before the baby's born.

1104
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:30,283
- Right.

1105
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:32,960
The demon.

1106
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,513
- I know you think I'm crazy.

1107
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,220
But you don't have to make fun of me.

1108
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,790
- I am not making fun of you.

1109
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,390
I am trying to wrap my head
around this whole thing.

1110
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:44,693
Come on, you have to
admit that this is a lot.

1111
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,130
Okay,

1112
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:49,963
fine.

1113
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,973
How did she say that we
get rid of the demon?

1114
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,930
- She said we gotta cut it out.

1115
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,070
- Well that is just not happening, Rachel.

1116
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,670
- Do you think that I want that?

1117
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,470
I mean, after everything
that I've been through.

1118
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:11,493
That is why we can't waste
time going to the cops.

1119
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,200
All right, we gotta
figure out some other way

1120
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,437
to get rid of this thing

1121
00:50:16,437 --> 00:50:18,603
and keep it from taking over our baby.

1122
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,600
- Okay.

1123
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,773
How do we get started?

1124
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,033
Do we seen an exorcist or something?

1125
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,550
- My mom escaped a satanic suicide cult,

1126
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:34,570
not the Catholic Church.

1127
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,970
I don't think and exorcist
is gonna be any help.

1128
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,280
Do you remember that
documentary I told you about?

1129
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,053
There was that guy, he survived.

1130
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,650
- Yeah.

1131
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,793
- He survived it.

1132
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,463
He's still there.

1133
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,613
If anybody knows how to
stop this from happening,

1134
00:50:54,613 --> 00:50:55,903
it's gonna be him.

1135
00:50:56,832 --> 00:51:00,315
(dramatic string music)

1136
00:51:00,315 --> 00:51:01,148
- Okay.

1137
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,763
Okay, so we'll give him a call.

1138
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,110
- No, look, I did that, I tried that.

1139
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,100
As soon as I learned about
him, I left him a message.

1140
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,460
I sent him an email, he
didn't return anything.

1141
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,010
- Well then we will go see him.

1142
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,203
- Really?

1143
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,533
- Yeah.

1144
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,750
Look, Rach, if this is what
you need to do to fix this,

1145
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,983
then that is what we're gonna do.

1146
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,549
Okay, I'm in.
(gentle music)

1147
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:33,704
I'm in.

1148
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:34,593
I love you.

1149
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:36,220
- I love you so much.

1150
00:51:37,563 --> 00:51:38,396
- Hey, look,

1151
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,580
why don't you finish up in here

1152
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,363
and I will pack us a bag.

1153
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:45,400
- Okay.

1154
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,600
- And we'll take off
as soon as you're done.

1155
00:51:48,723 --> 00:51:50,556
All right.
- Thank you.

1156
00:51:54,315 --> 00:51:56,147
It's gonna be okay.

1157
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:59,314
(gentle string music)

1158
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:11,070
(phone buttons clicking)

1159
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:18,441
It's gonna be okay.

1160
00:52:20,283 --> 00:52:22,964
(heartbeat thumping)

1161
00:52:22,964 --> 00:52:25,881
(foreboding music)

1162
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,053
Okay, so we're gonna get
on the Five heading north.

1163
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,080
- [Amber] North, got it.

1164
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:51,183
- Hey.

1165
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,210
Thank you for doing this.

1166
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:55,893
Even if you are just humoring me.

1167
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,823
- Rach, I love you, and so
whatever you need, okay?

1168
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:06,043
But there is something that
I wanna show you first.

1169
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:09,703
- What?

1170
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,060
Like a surprise or...

1171
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,703
- Yeah, like a surprise.

1172
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:20,688
(car whooshing)

1173
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,323
- This is...

1174
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:29,419
(tires screeching)

1175
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,633
in a parking garage?

1176
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:36,686
- No.

1177
00:53:36,686 --> 00:53:38,338
No.

1178
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:39,171
Come on.

1179
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,640
- It's really cool of
you to make a plan for us

1180
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,180
to like reconnect.

1181
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,440
I'm kinda hoping it's the churro spot

1182
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,813
you were telling me about.

1183
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:51,640
(Amber chuckling)

1184
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,330
Or ice cream, I love ice cream.

1185
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,440
Hot chocolate, French vanilla ice cream.

1186
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,371
- Anything you want.
- Yeah.

1187
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:58,204
(ominous music)
- Wait.

1188
00:53:58,204 --> 00:53:59,350
What is this?

1189
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,430
- Rachel, hello.

1190
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,010
I'm Dr. Simmons.

1191
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,380
I'm a mental health professional here

1192
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,180
at the Haven Wellness Center.

1193
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,754
We're a private mental health clinic.

1194
00:54:07,754 --> 00:54:09,202
- Are you having me committed?

1195
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:10,485
- Rach.
- What?

1196
00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:11,990
- You didn't give me a choice.

1197
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,890
- [Simmons] Gentlemen.

1198
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:14,193
Escort her inside.
- What're you doing?

1199
00:54:14,193 --> 00:54:15,593
No, no, no, no, no!

1200
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:17,286
No!

1201
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:19,643
Did your family put you up to this?

1202
00:54:19,643 --> 00:54:20,750
Let me, stop it!

1203
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,530
Is this your brother?

1204
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,540
Amber!

1205
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,930
Don't do this!

1206
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:25,763
- Don't worry.

1207
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,280
- Amber!
- She'll be fine.

1208
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,387
I know how difficult this must be on you.

1209
00:54:30,387 --> 00:54:33,403
But just know, you're
doing the right thing.

1210
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,949
- Doesn't feel like the right thing.

1211
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:38,810
(sinister music)

1212
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,040
- Fellas.

1213
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,770
Fellas, fellas.
- Get off me!

1214
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,260
- Fellas, it's fine,
it's fine, we're talking.

1215
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,306
- What is this?

1216
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:45,139
Get--
- We're talking.

1217
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:46,805
Hey.
- Treating my like an animal!

1218
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:47,638
- Hi, Rachel, Rachel.

1219
00:54:47,638 --> 00:54:48,471
Rachel.

1220
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:49,304
I'm Dr. Simmons.

1221
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,333
I want you to know these men--

1222
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,166
- Get off!
- These men are

1223
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,100
not gonna hurt you.

1224
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,640
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1225
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,170
I'm your doctor, do you understand?

1226
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,163
I'm on your side.

1227
00:55:00,355 --> 00:55:01,327
- You think I'm nuts.

1228
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:02,670
- No, no, I don't.

1229
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,190
I don't think you're nuts,
I don't think anyone's nuts.

1230
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,130
That's why I got into
mental health to begin with.

1231
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,170
Thanks, guys.

1232
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,780
Please.

1233
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,613
Have a seat.

1234
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,863
- I don't need a doctor.

1235
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,433
- Oh.

1236
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,113
What do you need?

1237
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,480
You don't wanna talk?

1238
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,570
All right.

1239
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,870
I'll tell you what I need.

1240
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,160
I need to give you a physical

1241
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,020
and I need to check the
baby's vitals real quick

1242
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,320
and then we can get you
settled in your room

1243
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,300
and you can decompress a little.

1244
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,133
Okay?

1245
00:55:43,143 --> 00:55:44,130
- No.

1246
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,390
The last doctor who did that, he--

1247
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,510
- No, no.

1248
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,270
Amber told us all about Dr. Fern

1249
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,630
and I understand your concern.

1250
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:53,223
But I'm willing to risk it.

1251
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,840
Like I said,

1252
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,840
I'm your doctor and I'm going
to do whatever I need to do

1253
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,893
to make sure you're healthy, right?

1254
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,280
- Look, if you listen
to the baby's heartbeat,

1255
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,180
something terrible is going to happen.

1256
00:56:10,978 --> 00:56:12,460
I don't know,

1257
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,530
you just trust me, you can't.

1258
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,193
- Oh but I can.

1259
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,760
You're here in what's
called an involuntary hold.

1260
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,340
You gave your wife
medical power of attorney

1261
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,253
and she's concerned about your
mental state, and frankly,

1262
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:30,323
darling, so am I.

1263
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:34,050
So, will you let me do what I need to do

1264
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:37,763
or are we going to make this into a thing?

1265
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,910
- Go fuck yourself.

1266
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,420
- Oh no.

1267
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,863
That kind of language
isn't going to help us.

1268
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,791
(heartbeat thumping)
(eerie music)

1269
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:54,917
This will only take a second.

1270
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:57,627
(unsettling music)

1271
00:56:57,627 --> 00:57:00,710
(heartbeat thumping)

1272
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:10,683
Almost done now.

1273
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,763
Deep breath in.

1274
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:17,543
Exhale.

1275
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,780
And I'm not

1276
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:25,270
feeling any urges to

1277
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,103
kill myself.

1278
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,543
Very good.

1279
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:32,993
Now, was that so bad?

1280
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,720
- Think I got something.

1281
00:57:43,798 --> 00:57:46,000
This old lady, Rose Kocinski,

1282
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,840
the psychic at that shopping
center with the good burritos.

1283
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,400
Someone found her dead.

1284
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,680
Looks like she died of an aneurysm,

1285
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,500
but M.E. says somebody crushed every bone

1286
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,943
in this poor woman's hands.

1287
00:57:57,048 --> 00:57:58,930
- And you thought I'd be
interested in this, why?

1288
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,840
- Because guess who's on the
shopping plaza's security tape

1289
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,050
leaving her place less than an hour

1290
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,350
before her body was found?

1291
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:07,604
(ominous tempo music)

1292
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:13,703
- I'm sorry.

1293
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,230
I'm just so sorry.

1294
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,400
This whole thing is my fault.

1295
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,770
I can't believe I got so fucking crazy.

1296
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:22,673
- You're not crazy, Rach.

1297
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:27,513
- Amber, look at what I made you do to me.

1298
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:30,470
- Okay, but look, it's not...

1299
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:32,940
You're not crazy, you're
just, I don't know,

1300
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,560
just going through something.
- Yeah but that's no excuse.

1301
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,663
You know, look at the
position I put us in.

1302
00:58:38,107 --> 00:58:42,300
- Hey, look, the main thing
is, you're getting help

1303
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,030
and I think that that's really brave.

1304
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,530
- Don't, don't, don't do
that, don't patronize me.

1305
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,500
I made such a scene in
front of that doctor

1306
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,640
that I might never get out of here.

1307
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,740
You know, and what happens--
- Hey.

1308
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,767
- If I go into labor here?
- No.

1309
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:55,600
No.
- Are they gonna

1310
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,600
take the baby?
- No.

1311
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,163
No, no, no, come here.

1312
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,143
I am not going to let
any of that happen, Rach.

1313
00:59:04,825 --> 00:59:06,820
I'll be right here with you.

1314
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,950
- Dr. Simmons, there
are two detectives here

1315
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:11,090
who would like to speak to Rachel Robins.

1316
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,023
- Excuse me!

1317
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,520
I don't think so!

1318
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,440
You two don't get to talk to her.

1319
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,760
No way.

1320
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,931
- What?

1321
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:19,764
Who are you?

1322
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,890
- I think she's the wife.

1323
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,200
- Yes, I'm her wife.

1324
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,070
- Nice, good to meet you.

1325
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,290
- Oh, save it.

1326
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:28,750
Look, she's been through enough

1327
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,670
and she answered all your questions.

1328
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:33,160
So now just let her rest.

1329
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,850
- Oh, you're talking about the doctor guy?

1330
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,860
Stabbed himself in the neck?

1331
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,910
- You're right.

1332
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,847
She's answered all our
questions about that.

1333
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:42,297
But now we have questions
about the dead psychic.

1334
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,153
- I'm sorry.

1335
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:47,135
What do you mean?

1336
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:49,208
- You don't know about that, do you?

1337
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:50,306
- No.

1338
00:59:50,306 --> 00:59:51,510
But what I do now is that you

1339
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:54,280
need to get a warrant to talk to her.

1340
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,220
- We actually don't.

1341
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,800
Not to talk to her.

1342
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,700
If the doctor says she
can talk, she can talk.

1343
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,200
- Gentlemen.

1344
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,410
Hello.

1345
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,840
Dr. Roy Simmons.

1346
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,280
You're here for Rachel Robins.

1347
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,870
- That's right.

1348
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,530
- That's fine.

1349
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,050
- Wait, what?

1350
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,670
No!

1351
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,503
No!

1352
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:17,510
Fine.

1353
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,950
But I'm calling our lawyer

1354
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,810
and the two of you aren't
gonna say a word to her

1355
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:21,710
till he gets here.

1356
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,720
- I'm sorry, guys, I've
gotta get back to work.

1357
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,840
You'll have someone page me

1358
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,590
when you've sorted all of this out.

1359
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,852
(ominous music)

1360
01:00:31,852 --> 01:00:34,766
(heartbeat pumping)
- [Woman] And then

1361
01:00:34,766 --> 01:00:39,063
we're going to take
five more deep breaths.

1362
01:00:39,063 --> 01:00:43,829
(dramatic piano music)
In and out.

1363
01:00:43,829 --> 01:00:44,746
In and out.

1364
01:00:47,652 --> 01:00:48,569
In and out.

1365
01:00:51,312 --> 01:00:52,145
One more.

1366
01:00:57,822 --> 01:00:59,790
And breath out.
(heartbeat thumping)

1367
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:00,736
- Come with me.

1368
01:01:00,736 --> 01:01:01,569
- Is everything okay?

1369
01:01:01,569 --> 01:01:03,077
- Everything's fine.

1370
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:05,040
(eerie music)

1371
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,570
- I don't...

1372
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:09,900
Mom, Mom, I don't know.

1373
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,691
Yeah, Gary's on his way right now.

1374
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:12,524
- Amber!

1375
01:01:15,528 --> 01:01:16,690
Amber!

1376
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:17,630
- [Amber] Mom?

1377
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,621
Mom, I gotta call you back!

1378
01:01:19,621 --> 01:01:20,454
Rachel!

1379
01:01:20,454 --> 01:01:21,287
- Amber!

1380
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:22,120
- Rachel!

1381
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,273
- Amber!

1382
01:01:23,273 --> 01:01:26,420
(Amber gasping)

1383
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,253
- Shit!

1384
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,770
- Wait, where are you taking me?

1385
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:33,720
Why are we outside?

1386
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,370
Slow down, I can't go that fast.

1387
01:01:38,992 --> 01:01:40,635
(car beeping)

1388
01:01:40,635 --> 01:01:43,635
(suspenseful music)

1389
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,613
- Rachel!

1390
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,003
- Get in.

1391
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,620
- Please don't do this.

1392
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,453
- Quiet.

1393
01:01:59,453 --> 01:02:00,970
Run, and your wife dies.

1394
01:02:02,672 --> 01:02:05,589
(tires screeching)

1395
01:02:07,203 --> 01:02:10,510
(intense music)

1396
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:11,345
(car thudding)

1397
01:02:11,345 --> 01:02:12,861
(Rachel gasping)

1398
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:15,809
(tires screeching)

1399
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:17,257
(horn honking)

1400
01:02:17,257 --> 01:02:18,917
- [Amber] Rachel!

1401
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:19,750
Rachel!
(car honking)

1402
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,857
- You hear that?

1403
01:02:21,857 --> 01:02:23,410
(car honking)

1404
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,260
- Parking garage.

1405
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,093
- Let's go!

1406
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:27,361
(car honking)

1407
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:28,992
- [Amber] Rachel!

1408
01:02:28,992 --> 01:02:31,992
(suspenseful music)

1409
01:02:38,617 --> 01:02:41,363
- Rachel, stop!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1410
01:02:41,363 --> 01:02:42,458
- [Kwan] Call it in!

1411
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,387
- [Amber] Are you okay?

1412
01:02:43,387 --> 01:02:44,581
- Definitely not okay!

1413
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:45,417
(tires screeching)

1414
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:47,092
You believe me now?

1415
01:02:47,092 --> 01:02:48,600
(Simmons groaning)

1416
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,600
(suspenseful music)

1417
01:02:54,557 --> 01:02:57,640
(heartbeat thumping)

1418
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:03,114
- What happened?

1419
01:03:03,964 --> 01:03:06,797
(Simmons gagging)

1420
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:20,569
(ominous music)

1421
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:22,456
- Are you gonna call it in?

1422
01:03:22,456 --> 01:03:23,503
What the hell are you doing?

1423
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,010
- [Peters] He's dead.

1424
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,200
- So what?

1425
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,620
You gotta call it in
if we wanna catch them.

1426
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:30,500
Whatever.

1427
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,242
I got the plates, I'll do it.

1428
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:33,770
- Hang up the phone.

1429
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:34,603
- What?

1430
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:37,020
- Hang up the phone now!

1431
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,704
- Peters, what the fuck?

1432
01:03:38,704 --> 01:03:39,570
- Now!

1433
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:43,670
You can't stop her.
(sinister music)

1434
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:45,340
No one can.

1435
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,173
- Peters?

1436
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,640
I don't know what's going on
here but we can talk about it.

1437
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,253
- All hail the Lilith.

1438
01:03:52,258 --> 01:03:53,091
- Peters,

1439
01:03:53,091 --> 01:03:54,085
what're you doing, man?
- Long live the first mother.

1440
01:03:54,085 --> 01:03:55,230
- What're you doing?
(woman screaming)

1441
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,084
Don't do it!

1442
01:03:56,084 --> 01:03:56,917
Don't!

1443
01:03:58,236 --> 01:04:00,113
(gunshots booming)

1444
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:01,554
Peters!

1445
01:04:01,554 --> 01:04:02,767
What're you doing?

1446
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:06,103
Talk to me, partner, talk to me!

1447
01:04:07,066 --> 01:04:08,401
(gunshots booming)

1448
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:10,513
(ominous music)

1449
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,152
Oh, fuck!

1450
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:13,710
(blood trickling)

1451
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,853
Peters!

1452
01:04:14,853 --> 01:04:15,686
What the fuck, man?

1453
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:16,519
Hey!

1454
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,920
You fucking idiot, what're you doing?

1455
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,870
Hey, stay with me.

1456
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,138
Stay with me, Peters!

1457
01:04:20,138 --> 01:04:20,976
Peters, you're all right.

1458
01:04:20,976 --> 01:04:24,476
Hey, can someone fucking get me some help?

1459
01:04:26,837 --> 01:04:29,420
(gentle music)

1460
01:04:46,778 --> 01:04:48,364
(car whooshing)

1461
01:04:48,364 --> 01:04:51,281
(foreboding music)

1462
01:05:16,234 --> 01:05:18,956
(birds chirping)

1463
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,456
(eerie music)

1464
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:39,048
(Amber knocking)

1465
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:43,513
- We close at 6:30.

1466
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:46,190
You have to come back tomorrow.

1467
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:47,763
- We're not here for the tour.

1468
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:50,440
- Please,

1469
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,340
we need your help.

1470
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:54,080
(John sighing)

1471
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,989
So I thought if anyone knew
how to stop this thing,

1472
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:57,510
it would be you.

1473
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:59,283
I know, I know it sounds insane.

1474
01:06:00,546 --> 01:06:02,160
But please,

1475
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,770
we're running out of time.

1476
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:06,060
- I'm gonna stop you
right there, young lady.

1477
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,360
I don't know what kind
of idiot you think I am

1478
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,593
but you picked the wrong
guy for your prank.

1479
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,567
Now get out of here, both of
you, before I call the cops.

1480
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:17,700
- No, no, my mom's name was Sarah, okay?

1481
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,060
She ran away in 1988.
- I don't know any Sarah!

1482
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,383
- Okay, well then who's
that in the photo with you?

1483
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,550
- That's Lilian.

1484
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:26,383
- Look.

1485
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:30,300
- [John] Lilian.

1486
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,300
- [Rachel] Her name's Sarah.

1487
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,980
- Rach, maybe... I don't know,
maybe she changed her name

1488
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,580
after she escaped from the cult.

1489
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:37,580
- That's your mother?

1490
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:43,280
And you think she's coming back
to life in your unborn baby?

1491
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,535
- Yep.

1492
01:06:44,535 --> 01:06:46,368
That about sums it up.

1493
01:06:47,663 --> 01:06:49,359
(John sighing)

1494
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,776
- I need a drink.

1495
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:54,190
Either of you need a drink?

1496
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,023
- Yes, please.

1497
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,933
- When I got back, Peters
told me the doctor was dead.

1498
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,193
He hadn't called it in so,

1499
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:08,641
I took out my cellphone to do it.

1500
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:10,960
(dramatic piano music)

1501
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,360
That's when he drew his side
arm and told me to hang up.

1502
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,193
- What'd you do?

1503
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:16,200
- I hung up.

1504
01:07:17,385 --> 01:07:18,802
- [Man] And then?

1505
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:25,815
- Then I tried talking to him.

1506
01:07:25,815 --> 01:07:27,844
Tried figuring out what the
hell was going on but...

1507
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:29,465
(ominous music)

1508
01:07:29,465 --> 01:07:30,415
He just ignored me.

1509
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:32,993
- Did he say anything else?

1510
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,250
- Told me I couldn't stop her.

1511
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,083
- Interesting.

1512
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:39,063
Who's her?

1513
01:07:41,673 --> 01:07:42,923
- I don't know.

1514
01:07:43,895 --> 01:07:45,145
- Was that all?

1515
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,153
- No.

1516
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,233
He said,

1517
01:07:52,547 --> 01:07:53,823
"All hail Lilith.

1518
01:07:54,727 --> 01:07:56,540
"Long live the first mother."

1519
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,090
- What the hell does that mean?

1520
01:08:01,058 --> 01:08:03,308
- How the fuck should I know?

1521
01:08:03,308 --> 01:08:04,370
(coyotes barking)
(crickets chirping)

1522
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:06,470
- There's something
you need to understand.

1523
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:08,650
That's not your mother in there.

1524
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:09,850
That's your grandmother.

1525
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:11,673
It's Mother Lilith.

1526
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,515
- Excuse me?
(eerie music)

1527
01:08:15,515 --> 01:08:17,480
- You mean the cult lady.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1528
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,160
We all called ourselves her children

1529
01:08:21,156 --> 01:08:24,103
but Lilian was her actual daughter.

1530
01:08:25,777 --> 01:08:27,920
- The psychic kept saying "grandmother."

1531
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,230
I thought she was talking about my mother,

1532
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:32,289
the baby's grandma, I know she was...

1533
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:33,790
She was talking about my grandmother.

1534
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:36,283
- She was the one that
was meant to be reborn.

1535
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,053
Not your mother.

1536
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:42,350
We were all meant to kill ourselves

1537
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:46,120
to earn a place in hell as royalty.

1538
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,623
Son and daughters of Satan.

1539
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,850
But mother Lilith was meant to be reborn

1540
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:56,750
so she could continue adopting
generations of children

1541
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,683
for the Dark Lord.

1542
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,803
But just before the ritual,

1543
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,173
your mother ran away.

1544
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,293
Mother Lilith was furious.

1545
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,280
She still had to kill herself

1546
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,053
to escort us to our new father.

1547
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,863
But...

1548
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,803
Without your mother
there, there was no baby.

1549
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,510
So she just had to wait
for her granddaughter

1550
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:23,880
to have a daughter.

1551
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,970
- You're telling me I'm giving
birth to the devil's wife

1552
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,209
and that my mom is just--

1553
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:29,042
- Dead.

1554
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,883
- Okay, okay.

1555
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,580
So, even if our baby is
possessed by this Lilith

1556
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:38,793
instead of your mom,

1557
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,980
that doesn't tell us what
we came here to find out.

1558
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:44,413
Which is how do we get rid of her?

1559
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,222
- You can't.

1560
01:09:47,222 --> 01:09:49,180
(ominous music)

1561
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,513
Nothing will stop her.

1562
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:54,267
And even if there was something,

1563
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:56,303
I wouldn't tell you.

1564
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:01,963
What kind of a son would
I be if I did that?

1565
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,323
- What?

1566
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,555
- You enjoying that drink?

1567
01:10:08,555 --> 01:10:09,950
(Amber gasping)
(eerie music)

1568
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:10,783
- Amber?

1569
01:10:10,783 --> 01:10:11,616
Amber!

1570
01:10:11,616 --> 01:10:12,449
Amber, Amber!

1571
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:13,282
Oh god, Amber!

1572
01:10:15,032 --> 01:10:16,410
What the hell did you put in that?

1573
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,900
- Don't worry, there's nothing in yours.

1574
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,110
She'll be fine.
(eerie music)

1575
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,640
As long as you follow
instructions, that is.

1576
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,603
But if you don't follow instructions,

1577
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,080
she's going to get hurt.

1578
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,642
Got it?

1579
01:10:31,642 --> 01:10:34,392
(sinister music)

1580
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:39,358
(dramatic choir music)

1581
01:10:39,358 --> 01:10:41,941
(wind howling)

1582
01:10:49,403 --> 01:10:50,782
- Amber?

1583
01:10:50,782 --> 01:10:51,830
Amber?

1584
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,393
- You know, I've waited
a very long time for you.

1585
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,930
There were some years, I admit,

1586
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,290
that I had my doubts.

1587
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:05,550
But Mother Lilith always
said you would come.

1588
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,893
And here you are now.

1589
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,160
It's an honor to meet you, really.

1590
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,020
- If you've been waiting or me,

1591
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:20,700
then you never tried to kill yourself.

1592
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,070
- Of course not.

1593
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,470
(heart monitor beeping)

1594
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:27,460
I was the only one Mother Lilith
could trust to stay behind.

1595
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,642
Keep the homestead going.

1596
01:11:29,642 --> 01:11:32,651
(gentle music)

1597
01:11:32,651 --> 01:11:35,401
(Rachel gasping)

1598
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,290
You know that doctor
who tried to abduct you?

1599
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:42,610
She was gonna have him bring you here.

1600
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,660
And then you two escaped

1601
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,683
and you came here all on your own.

1602
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,393
All the way up here for help.

1603
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,520
- Please, you don't have to do this.

1604
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,170
You really don't have to do this.

1605
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,786
Hey, don't you touch her!

1606
01:12:00,786 --> 01:12:01,690
(Amber grunting)

1607
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,740
Oh honey, I'm so sorry!

1608
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:06,092
Please don't touch me, please.

1609
01:12:06,092 --> 01:12:07,132
- Rach?

1610
01:12:07,132 --> 01:12:08,076
- Amber.

1611
01:12:08,076 --> 01:12:09,350
Don't touch me, no!

1612
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:10,880
- Get away from her!

1613
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,441
(Rachel crying)

1614
01:12:12,441 --> 01:12:13,584
Get away from her!

1615
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:16,137
Don't touch her!
(Rachel crying)

1616
01:12:16,137 --> 01:12:17,530
Don't touch her!
- You don't have to do this!

1617
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,791
Please, stop.

1618
01:12:18,791 --> 01:12:20,063
Please.
- Rachel.

1619
01:12:20,063 --> 01:12:21,913
- Please, you don't
have to do this, please.

1620
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,633
Please.

1621
01:12:24,701 --> 01:12:27,837
(Amber crying)

1622
01:12:27,837 --> 01:12:29,840
Please.
- Don't touch her!

1623
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,903
Get away from her!

1624
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:32,744
- Oh!

1625
01:12:32,744 --> 01:12:34,370
(heartbeat thumping)

1626
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:35,612
Oh, oh!

1627
01:12:35,612 --> 01:12:38,492
(John laughing)
There she is.

1628
01:12:38,492 --> 01:12:39,575
There she is!

1629
01:12:40,494 --> 01:12:44,250
(heartbeat thumping)

1630
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,705
All hail the Lilith.

1631
01:12:45,705 --> 01:12:49,088
(heartbeat thumping)

1632
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:54,017
Oh!

1633
01:12:54,017 --> 01:12:56,177
Long live the first mother.

1634
01:12:57,147 --> 01:12:58,992
(Rachel gasping)

1635
01:12:58,992 --> 01:13:00,608
- No!

1636
01:13:00,608 --> 01:13:01,441
No!

1637
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,650
- No.

1638
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:04,503
No word yet.

1639
01:13:05,559 --> 01:13:07,013
There will be a ruling anytime soon.

1640
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,830
Doesn't look good.

1641
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:11,053
I.A. are fuckers.

1642
01:13:13,813 --> 01:13:17,320
(foreboding music)

1643
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,033
You know what, I gotta go.

1644
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:21,690
I'll keep you posted.

1645
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:22,523
Yeah.

1646
01:13:25,976 --> 01:13:29,476
(suspenseful tempo music)

1647
01:13:34,653 --> 01:13:37,661
(horse neighing)

1648
01:13:37,661 --> 01:13:40,494
(engine rumbling)

1649
01:13:45,562 --> 01:13:48,229
(ominous music)

1650
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:56,227
(liquid sloshing)

1651
01:13:58,943 --> 01:14:02,110
(ominous tempo music)

1652
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:03,903
- Knock, knock!

1653
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,064
Are we decent?

1654
01:14:07,064 --> 01:14:07,964
How're we feeling?

1655
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,573
I said, how are we feeling?

1656
01:14:15,999 --> 01:14:16,999
About the same, huh?

1657
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,600
What do you want for lunch?

1658
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:23,173
Rachel, look at me!

1659
01:14:26,098 --> 01:14:27,462
(eerie music)

1660
01:14:27,462 --> 01:14:30,757
You know, there are some sharp
tools in the barn out there.

1661
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:34,020
Maybe you should start
following instructions

1662
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,720
before Mother Lilith makes your wife

1663
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,803
put out one of those pretty little eyes!

1664
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,780
I'm sick of this attitude.

1665
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,060
I know you don't wanna be here.

1666
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:49,210
But this is where you are.

1667
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:52,093
So you really should make the most of it.

1668
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:54,973
- Make the most of it.

1669
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:56,713
- Look,

1670
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,630
Lilith is coming

1671
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,312
whether you want her to or not

1672
01:15:02,312 --> 01:15:03,743
and you will be her mother.

1673
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,453
Whether you want to be or not.

1674
01:15:09,906 --> 01:15:12,993
And that position comes
with some impressive perks.

1675
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,310
You know, you could have
a really sweet life here

1676
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:22,977
if you just gave up the "fuck yous."

1677
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,063
Now what do you want for lunch?

1678
01:15:27,086 --> 01:15:30,003
(unsettling music)

1679
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:33,583
- You know...

1680
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:38,909
I think I'll...

1681
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,180
(Rachel groaning)

1682
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:41,163
Oh!
- Rachel?

1683
01:15:42,141 --> 01:15:43,786
Rachel?
- Oh, it's happening!

1684
01:15:43,786 --> 01:15:45,029
- Okay, it's okay.

1685
01:15:45,029 --> 01:15:46,419
(Rachel groaning)
(ominous music)

1686
01:15:46,419 --> 01:15:48,568
It's okay.
(punch thudding)

1687
01:15:48,568 --> 01:15:51,568
(Rachel whimpering)

1688
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:53,250
- [Kwan] Hey!

1689
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,083
- Oh, you!

1690
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,027
- [John] Don't you open that door!

1691
01:15:55,027 --> 01:15:56,020
- No one move!

1692
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,150
Let me see your hands!

1693
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,430
Up!

1694
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,610
- Is there anyone else in here?

1695
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:01,410
- My wife is in the barn.

1696
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:02,557
- Good

1697
01:16:02,557 --> 01:16:04,010
because I have plenty of
questions for the both of you.

1698
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:04,910
I said hands!

1699
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:05,743
Keep them up!

1700
01:16:05,743 --> 01:16:06,670
- I will tell you everything

1701
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,960
but first you've gotta get me
out of here and away from him.

1702
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:09,890
He's been holding me captive

1703
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:11,305
this entire time.
- What, she's crazy!

1704
01:16:11,305 --> 01:16:12,686
Her and her crazy wife kidnapped me,

1705
01:16:12,686 --> 01:16:13,519
drugged me, dragged me out--

1706
01:16:13,519 --> 01:16:14,950
- Hey, shut up, both of you!
- Her and her crazy wife!

1707
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:15,973
- I said, shut up!

1708
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:18,250
Here's what's gonna happen.

1709
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,710
Both of you are gonna come
outside with me nice and slow.

1710
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,240
We're gonna go find your wife

1711
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,527
and then I'm gonna take
all three of you in

1712
01:16:24,527 --> 01:16:26,430
and you all can tell me what's going on.

1713
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,263
Let's go!

1714
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:29,953
Door!

1715
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:31,890
- I can explain if you
just let me explain.

1716
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:34,230
- One hand!

1717
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,550
- Let me talk to you without him.

1718
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:36,640
- I said move!

1719
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,473
Slowly.

1720
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,070
Don't get too close.

1721
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,903
- Please.

1722
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:42,870
- [Kwan] Don't get too close!

1723
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,270
- I didn't do anything to your partner.

1724
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:45,385
- Hands up!

1725
01:16:45,385 --> 01:16:47,885
(eerie music)

1726
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,588
- Watch out!

1727
01:16:50,588 --> 01:16:52,502
(hammer thudding)

1728
01:16:52,502 --> 01:16:53,335
No.

1729
01:16:53,335 --> 01:16:55,180
(eerie music)

1730
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,847
(Kwan groaning)

1731
01:17:01,929 --> 01:17:02,780
(ominous music)

1732
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,307
- I told you her wife was crazy.

1733
01:17:05,307 --> 01:17:06,925
(gunshot booming)

1734
01:17:06,925 --> 01:17:09,842
(Rachel screaming)

1735
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,750
Oh come on, you think I'm
gonna fall for that again?

1736
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,683
(Rachel yelling)

1737
01:17:15,683 --> 01:17:18,933
(dramatic choir music)

1738
01:17:21,579 --> 01:17:22,862
- Shoot him!

1739
01:17:22,862 --> 01:17:24,609
Amber, shoot the fucker!

1740
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:25,442
- Amber.

1741
01:17:25,442 --> 01:17:26,275
- [Rachel] Shoot him, Amber!

1742
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:27,108
Shoot the fucker!
- It's okay, Amber.

1743
01:17:27,108 --> 01:17:29,680
It's okay, Amber, calm down.

1744
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,990
Calm down, you're gonna be okay.

1745
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:32,550
You don't wanna shot me.

1746
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:34,600
You don't wanna shoot me, Amber.

1747
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,791
Don't, look at me, look at me, Amber.

1748
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:39,340
(Rachel groaning)

1749
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:40,173
Look at me.

1750
01:17:40,173 --> 01:17:41,690
You don't wanna shoot me.

1751
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,941
(Rachel screaming)

1752
01:17:43,941 --> 01:17:44,774
Okay?

1753
01:17:44,774 --> 01:17:47,208
(Rachel moaning)

1754
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,875
(ominous music)

1755
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:06,823
- It's time.

1756
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:10,170
Get rid of him.

1757
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:12,120
I'll take her to the barn to get ready.

1758
01:18:17,174 --> 01:18:19,376
(crickets chirping)

1759
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:22,126
(Rachel huffing)

1760
01:18:27,513 --> 01:18:28,346
- Amber.

1761
01:18:30,168 --> 01:18:31,001
Amber.

1762
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:33,723
Please.

1763
01:18:36,058 --> 01:18:38,780
Amber.
(heart monitor beeping)

1764
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,543
You don't have to do this.

1765
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,927
Please, please, I know that
you're in there somewhere.

1766
01:18:44,927 --> 01:18:45,760
Please.

1767
01:18:48,168 --> 01:18:49,001
Amber.

1768
01:18:50,384 --> 01:18:51,217
Amber.

1769
01:18:52,384 --> 01:18:55,217
(Rachel groaning)

1770
01:18:56,862 --> 01:18:58,029
Amber, please.

1771
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,130
I can't do this alone.

1772
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:02,872
Please, please, I need you, I need you.

1773
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:04,991
I can't do this on my own.

1774
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:07,075
I can't do this on my own.

1775
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,742
(Rachel crying)

1776
01:19:12,355 --> 01:19:13,698
- Rachel?

1777
01:19:13,698 --> 01:19:14,739
Rachel?

1778
01:19:14,739 --> 01:19:16,051
(chains rattling)
(Rachel crying)

1779
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:17,968
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.

1780
01:19:19,432 --> 01:19:21,868
Okay, okay, okay, I'm here.

1781
01:19:21,868 --> 01:19:23,283
I am here with you.

1782
01:19:23,283 --> 01:19:25,461
Hey, hey, look at me, look at me.

1783
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:26,864
Look at me, I'm here, I'm here.

1784
01:19:26,864 --> 01:19:28,546
(Rachel gasping)
I am right here.

1785
01:19:28,546 --> 01:19:31,149
- Oh, I burn so much!
- I know, I know.

1786
01:19:31,149 --> 01:19:33,485
- I don't know what to do!
- Breathe, breathe.

1787
01:19:33,485 --> 01:19:34,563
Baby, breathe.

1788
01:19:34,563 --> 01:19:39,091
(Rachel screaming in distance)

1789
01:19:39,091 --> 01:19:41,924
(shovel clanking)

1790
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:51,510
(Rachel crying in distance)

1791
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:53,040
- Welcome home, Mother.

1792
01:20:03,888 --> 01:20:07,305
(seatbelt alarm beeping)

1793
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:11,219
(engine rumbling)

1794
01:20:14,946 --> 01:20:16,880
(gentle music)

1795
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,370
- Just breathe, baby.

1796
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:21,620
I am right here with you,
I'm not going anywhere.

1797
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:24,287
(Rachel crying)

1798
01:20:25,632 --> 01:20:29,092
(heart monitor beeping)

1799
01:20:29,092 --> 01:20:30,864
I'm sorry, just breathe.

1800
01:20:30,864 --> 01:20:32,744
I'm here--
- We're getting closer.

1801
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:35,494
(Rachel moaning)

1802
01:20:39,194 --> 01:20:41,694
(eerie music)

1803
01:20:44,097 --> 01:20:46,930
(chains rattling)

1804
01:20:50,957 --> 01:20:51,790
- Amber.

1805
01:20:53,059 --> 01:20:55,809
(Rachel moaning)

1806
01:20:57,282 --> 01:20:58,245
Mom.

1807
01:20:58,245 --> 01:20:59,670
- It's okay, baby.

1808
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:01,063
Don't worry, I'm here.

1809
01:21:02,176 --> 01:21:04,490
- Why didn't you ever tell me?

1810
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:07,823
(heart monitor beeping)

1811
01:21:09,432 --> 01:21:10,432
- I'm sorry.

1812
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:12,753
I thought I'd saved you.

1813
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:15,853
I thought you were safe.

1814
01:21:15,853 --> 01:21:16,700
- That was you?

1815
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,070
It was really you in my dream,
you were trying to warn me.

1816
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,903
- Your grandmother,

1817
01:21:20,903 --> 01:21:23,370
she didn't want me communicating with you

1818
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:25,453
and she's stronger than I am.

1819
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,943
But she's distracted now, so I'm here.

1820
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:31,073
- But you're head.

1821
01:21:32,214 --> 01:21:35,500
(gentle music)

1822
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,513
- Sweetie.

1823
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:41,883
Doesn't matter if I'm dead,
I'll always be with you.

1824
01:21:49,082 --> 01:21:51,194
- I don't know what to do, Momma.

1825
01:21:51,194 --> 01:21:53,186
- What do you mean?

1826
01:21:53,186 --> 01:21:55,420
- I don't think I could stop her.

1827
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:57,474
- Well, maybe not,

1828
01:21:57,474 --> 01:21:59,260
but you don't have to do it on her terms.

1829
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,663
You're her mother.

1830
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:03,143
You make the rules.

1831
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,390
- They said if I did
anything, he'd hurt Amber.

1832
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,990
- They're gonna hurt her anyway.

1833
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:15,063
How do you think this ritual ends?

1834
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,210
Your grandmother cut her throat
when she left this world.

1835
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,783
Someone has to do the
same to bring her back.

1836
01:22:25,613 --> 01:22:27,030
- Cut her throat?

1837
01:22:28,404 --> 01:22:31,154
(Rachel moaning)

1838
01:22:35,861 --> 01:22:37,140
- I love you, baby.

1839
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,226
- [Rachel] Momma, don't go!

1840
01:22:39,226 --> 01:22:42,132
(Rachel groaning)
- Rachel, Rachel.

1841
01:22:42,132 --> 01:22:43,215
Rachel, look.

1842
01:22:44,445 --> 01:22:46,109
- Listen.

1843
01:22:46,109 --> 01:22:47,526
Oh, listen to me.

1844
01:22:48,879 --> 01:22:50,360
They're gonna kill you.

1845
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,510
(Rachel groaning)

1846
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,869
You've got to get out of here.

1847
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:57,320
- I can't, I can't, Rachel, I can't!

1848
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,350
And even if I could, I'm not leaving you!

1849
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,183
- Listen to me.

1850
01:23:04,337 --> 01:23:05,504
I have a plan.

1851
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:09,748
(heartbeat thumping)

1852
01:23:09,748 --> 01:23:12,470
(heart monitor beeping)

1853
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:14,340
(Rachel gasping)
(intense music)

1854
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,253
- Get off her!

1855
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:18,743
It's okay.

1856
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:19,890
You're okay.

1857
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:22,178
- Don't touch me, get off me!
(John shushing)

1858
01:23:22,178 --> 01:23:23,848
- It's okay.
(Rachel crying)

1859
01:23:23,848 --> 01:23:25,264
It's okay!
- Get off me!

1860
01:23:25,264 --> 01:23:27,142
- It's okay, it's okay!
- Get off me, get off me!

1861
01:23:27,142 --> 01:23:28,079
- It's okay!

1862
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:29,076
(Amber screaming)

1863
01:23:29,076 --> 01:23:32,174
(hammer crunching)
(John screaming)

1864
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,536
(John yelping)

1865
01:23:34,536 --> 01:23:37,170
(Rachel moaning)

1866
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:39,890
- Rachel, listen to me,
you have to take this.

1867
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:41,180
When your next contraction comes,

1868
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,240
she won't make me give it back!

1869
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,393
You have to take it!

1870
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,633
You!

1871
01:23:46,633 --> 01:23:47,959
Where is the key?

1872
01:23:47,959 --> 01:23:48,918
(John crying)
Where?

1873
01:23:48,918 --> 01:23:50,190
- Amber!

1874
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:54,206
(Rachel crying)
(John crying)

1875
01:23:54,206 --> 01:23:57,206
(suspenseful music)

1876
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,090
- You piece of shit!
- No!

1877
01:24:02,426 --> 01:24:03,566
- Rachel,

1878
01:24:03,566 --> 01:24:05,825
I will be back, I promise!

1879
01:24:05,825 --> 01:24:06,752
I love you!

1880
01:24:06,752 --> 01:24:07,961
- I love you.

1881
01:24:07,961 --> 01:24:10,628
(intense music)

1882
01:24:13,431 --> 01:24:16,348
(foreboding music)

1883
01:24:25,784 --> 01:24:28,617
(John whimpering)

1884
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:37,123
Don't.

1885
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:41,082
Don't you fucking touch me!

1886
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:43,582
(eerie music)

1887
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:45,690
Back off!

1888
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,140
- You broke my leg!

1889
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,767
- Shut up!

1890
01:24:48,767 --> 01:24:51,456
(John whimpering)

1891
01:24:51,456 --> 01:24:54,469
(dramatic violin music)

1892
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:56,330
The next contraction I have,
my finger is gonna squeeze

1893
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:59,170
this trigger whether I want it to or not,

1894
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:00,411
unless we can make a deal.

1895
01:25:00,411 --> 01:25:01,244
- Deal?

1896
01:25:01,244 --> 01:25:02,300
There's no deal.

1897
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:03,303
- Shut up!

1898
01:25:04,586 --> 01:25:05,786
I wasn't talking to you.

1899
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:07,740
I was talking to her.

1900
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,509
- Well she's not gonna listen to you!

1901
01:25:09,509 --> 01:25:11,290
- I said

1902
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:13,220
be quiet,

1903
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:14,272
JoNoah!

1904
01:25:14,272 --> 01:25:17,440
(dramatic music)

1905
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,273
I'm listening.

1906
01:25:19,552 --> 01:25:20,802
- Let Amber go.

1907
01:25:22,521 --> 01:25:23,438
Let her go.

1908
01:25:24,973 --> 01:25:26,390
I will cooperate.

1909
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:28,883
I will take care of you.

1910
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,063
I will be your mom.

1911
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:36,620
The best mom that you
could ever have hoped for.

1912
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:37,997
Just please let her go.

1913
01:25:39,496 --> 01:25:40,329
Please.

1914
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,830
- I'm afraid that's not possible.

1915
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,180
In order for me to come
back, another must--

1916
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,983
- Has to take your place, I know.

1917
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,640
Doesn't have to be her.

1918
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,590
Doesn't have to be.

1919
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:55,133
Let it be him.

1920
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:55,980
- Me?

1921
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,080
That's ridiculous.

1922
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:57,913
Mother Lilith needs--

1923
01:25:57,913 --> 01:26:01,497
- I told you to be quiet, JoNoah!

1924
01:26:01,497 --> 01:26:04,830
(heart monitor beeping)

1925
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:10,540
I accept.

1926
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:11,870
- Wha...

1927
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,598
- [Lilith] Now drop the gun.

1928
01:26:13,598 --> 01:26:14,798
- You think I trust you?

1929
01:26:16,615 --> 01:26:19,660
(ominous music)

1930
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:20,720
- Mother,

1931
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,016
no.

1932
01:26:22,016 --> 01:26:23,241
(eerie music)

1933
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:26,520
You can't make me take your place.

1934
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,697
You won't be able to
escort me to my new father.

1935
01:26:29,697 --> 01:26:32,323
(Lilith shushing)
He won't know who I am!

1936
01:26:33,435 --> 01:26:34,973
- Yes he will.
(John whimpering)

1937
01:26:34,973 --> 01:26:37,953
He will know how loyal you served me.

1938
01:26:39,217 --> 01:26:40,293
And you,

1939
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,950
you will join your
brothers and your sisters

1940
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:45,373
at the Dark Lord's side.

1941
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,837
- Yes, Mother.

1942
01:26:50,837 --> 01:26:54,004
(eerie chiming music)

1943
01:26:59,116 --> 01:27:02,550
- When your next contraction hits,

1944
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:03,383
tell her to run.

1945
01:27:04,897 --> 01:27:08,253
But if I let her go and she comes back,

1946
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,593
she's mine.
(ominous music)

1947
01:27:13,593 --> 01:27:16,426
(Rachel groaning)

1948
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:26,737
- Rachel.

1949
01:27:26,737 --> 01:27:27,570
- Amber!

1950
01:27:28,488 --> 01:27:30,481
- Rachel!
- You have to go!

1951
01:27:30,481 --> 01:27:31,314
- Rachel.

1952
01:27:31,314 --> 01:27:32,443
- Go, go, go!

1953
01:27:32,443 --> 01:27:33,849
You have to go!

1954
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:36,201
You can't be here, you need to go!

1955
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:37,034
Go!

1956
01:27:39,225 --> 01:27:40,058
Go!

1957
01:27:43,145 --> 01:27:46,228
(gentle piano music)

1958
01:27:49,577 --> 01:27:52,842
(engine rumbling)

1959
01:27:52,842 --> 01:27:55,759
(Rachel screaming)

1960
01:27:57,633 --> 01:28:00,466
(engine rumbling)

1961
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:04,744
(gentle piano music)

1962
01:28:04,744 --> 01:28:07,327
(John huffing)

1963
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,207
- All hail

1964
01:28:16,622 --> 01:28:17,455
the Lilith!

1965
01:28:17,455 --> 01:28:18,788
(Rachel moaning)

1966
01:28:18,788 --> 01:28:20,227
Long live

1967
01:28:20,227 --> 01:28:21,636
the first mother.

1968
01:28:21,636 --> 01:28:25,068
(Rachel moaning)

1969
01:28:25,068 --> 01:28:26,651
I love you, Mother.

1970
01:28:29,497 --> 01:28:34,497
(blood squelching)
(Rachel moaning)

1971
01:28:34,945 --> 01:28:36,681
(body thudding)

1972
01:28:36,681 --> 01:28:41,595
(Rachel screaming)
(heartbeat thumping)

1973
01:28:41,595 --> 01:28:44,178
(Amber crying)

1974
01:28:46,523 --> 01:28:49,558
(Amber screaming)

1975
01:28:49,558 --> 01:28:52,308
(Rachel moaning)

1976
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:02,584
(dramatic piano music)

1977
01:29:04,432 --> 01:29:06,932
(baby crying)

1978
01:29:12,852 --> 01:29:15,685
(engine rumbling)

1979
01:29:27,256 --> 01:29:29,756
(baby crying)

1980
01:29:35,064 --> 01:29:37,897
(engine rumbling)

1981
01:29:45,752 --> 01:29:48,502
(birds chirping)

1982
01:29:51,024 --> 01:29:54,191
(distant dog barking)

1983
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:01,216
- This is it.

1984
01:30:01,216 --> 01:30:02,523
- [Man] Wow.

1985
01:30:02,523 --> 01:30:03,390
This place is beautiful.

1986
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:04,720
- [Amber] Rachel?

1987
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,035
- I'm out here.
(baby cooing)

1988
01:30:07,035 --> 01:30:08,230
It's okay.

1989
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:10,063
Go to sleep, baby.

1990
01:30:10,063 --> 01:30:12,563
(baby cooing)

1991
01:30:16,587 --> 01:30:18,870
- I brought someone to
say hi to baby Lilith.

1992
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:20,500
If it's okay with you,

1993
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:23,050
he's gonna have dinner with
us and spend the night.

1994
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:25,580
He said that he has lots of friends

1995
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:27,500
that will be coming this way soon.

1996
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:31,060
- Well they, of course, are all welcome.

1997
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:32,970
- Wow, thank you.

1998
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:34,420
Seriously.

1999
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:35,470
That's very generous.

2000
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:38,503
- Don't thank me.

2001
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:41,500
Thank Lilith.

2002
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,700
- Uh...

2003
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:43,533
Sure.

2004
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,443
Thanks, Lilith.

2005
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:53,780
- [Amber] Hi, angel.

2006
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:55,104
Yeah.

2007
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,937
Hi, angel.

2008
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:00,933
- She's got it.

2009
01:31:04,475 --> 01:31:06,302
- [Amber] Do you wanna hold her?

2010
01:31:06,302 --> 01:31:07,198
- Uh...

2011
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:08,031
I'm not...

2012
01:31:08,031 --> 01:31:10,030
- [Amber] Keep looking in her eyes.

2013
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:12,613
Hold her tight, hold her
tight and keep bouncing.

2014
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:17,610
(wind chimes clinking)

2015
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:26,856
(heartbeat thumping)

2016
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:29,356

2017
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:41,534
(demonic whispering)
