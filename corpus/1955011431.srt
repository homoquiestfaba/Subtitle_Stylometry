1
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:21,427
So dad's gonna
bring pizza home.

2
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,623
Lucy?

3
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,461
Lucy!

4
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,164
Don't call me that.

5
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:38,404
What Would you
like me to call you?

6
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:41,173
<i>Lucinda. It's more adult.</i>

7
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,608
Okay.

8
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,682
So, Lucinda, huh?

9
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,684
<i>Yeah.</i>

10
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,553
You know, it wasn't that
long ago you'd have me

11
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,722
climb into bed with you
when you had a nightmare.

12
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,558
Whatever. I was four.

13
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,697
<i>I, uh, I need to
ask you something.</i>

14
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,399
What is it?

15
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,270
So, There's this camping trip

16
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,406
and everyone's going.

17
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,210
That's not a question.

18
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,546
<i>Can I go?</i>

19
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,248
Isn't it a little cold
to go camping?

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,251
<i>We're staying in a cabin.</i>

21
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,754
Are there gonna be any parents?

22
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,289
No.

23
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,623
Are there gonna be boys?

24
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,092
No.

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,263
Morgan's going.

26
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,265
That's of very little comfort.

27
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,633
Please, mom?

28
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,507
Sorry, Lucy. I just don't
think it's a good idea.

29
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,175
This is not fair.

30
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,213
Yeah, and...

31
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,448
If your aunt had a mustache,
she'd be your Uncle.

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,584
I fucking hate it
when you say that.

33
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,431
<i>You're not going. And you
talk to me like that again,</i>

34
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,800
<i>You're not going anywhere</i>
<i>for a very long time.</i>

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,547
You have to trust
I'm just looking out for you.

36
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,650
<i>Okay, Lucy?</i>

37
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,454
- Lucinda...
- I'm walking home.

38
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,222

Okay.

59
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,436
She shouldn't
skate around here.

60
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,738
There aren't any sidewalks.

61
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,441
<i>Tell your mom not

00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,913
<i>Is she shaking her head?</i>

64
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,047
Yeah.

65
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,219
<i>Have you been playing</i>
<i>those cords I taught you?</i>

66
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,221
A little bit.

67
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,924
The strings hurt my fingers.

68
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,792
<i>The skin will get harder</i>

69
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,528

70
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,097
Okay.

71
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,800
<i>We'll practice together</i>
<i>when I come home.</i>

72
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,635
When will you come home?

73
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,604
Soon.

74
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,818
<i>So I'm gonna
be coming home late from work.</i>

75
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,687
<i>Just like the last job.</i>

76
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,121
<i>Yeah.</i>

77
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,190
<i>I double-checked</i>
<i>with the principal,</i>

78
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,060
<i>and she still thinks you should
start after winter break.</i>

79
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,962
<i>'Kay.</i>

80
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:20,131
<i>You'll get a fresh start.</i>

81
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,923
<i>You took your pill, right?</i>

82
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,959
<i>Yes.</i>

83
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,828
<i>You have to
take your pill everyday,</i>

84
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,564
<i>- and you get that, right?</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

85
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,147
<i>Come here, boy!</i>

86
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,429
Hello. Father meyers.

87
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,965
Jessica.

88
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,800
This is Tess.

89
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,302
Short for Theresa.

90
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,304
Please don't call me that.

91
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,440
- Tess.
- Sorry.

92
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,179
I'll make
sure to say a prayer for...

93
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,014
<i>Thank you, father.</i>

94
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,418
- Tess?
- Thank you.

95
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,315
Hello.

96
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,132
Sarah?

97
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,203
It's...

98
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,338
Haven't see you here
in a while.

99
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,810
Is there anything
we can do for you?

100
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,814
No. Thank you.

101
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,029
Did you have a bad dream?

102
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,352
<i>Hey, this is Lucy's phone.
I'm not here right now.</i>

103
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,822
<i>Leave a message,</i>
<i>and I might get back to you.</i>

104
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,145
What're you gonna do today?

105
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,613
Read.

106
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,150

00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,887

137

On different medications
practically her whole life.

138
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,300
<i>I remember the first time.</i>

139
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,969
<i>She was five.</i>

140
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,708
She was sitting in a corner

141
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,211
all hunched up and...

142
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:18,716
And just knocking her head
against the wall...

143
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,286
<i>Over and over.</i>

144
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:32,997
And we were so young
when we had her.

145
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:37,501
At her age now, actually.

146
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,707
I've...

147
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,675
Tried so hard.

148
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:50,982
I've made so many mistakes.

149
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,620
Abut then I... I think

150
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,688
she's good now.

151
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,924

you've done well, Jessica.

Nothing. I just make
it up as I go along.

174
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,331
Pierre asked if you were
coming on the camping trip.

175
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:43,273
I'd have to buy a new swimsuit
that hides my scar.

176
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:46,143
<i>Oh, screw that.</i>
<i>Your scar's cool.</i>

177
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,145
<i>Peter says</i>
<i>it's like a badass tattoo.</i>

178
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:54,298
So wait. Does that mean
your mom said yes?

179
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,291
Lucinda.

180
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,294
You haven't even asked her yet,

181
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,163
- have you?
- No, not yet.

182
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,265
Sarah's cool. She'll say yes.

183
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:10,968
- "Sarah's cool"?
- Cooler than my mom.

184
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,637
Yeah. Morgan, that's not hard.

185
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,473
Don't talk about my mom, bitch.

186
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:21,979
Sarah gets it.
She's, like, worldly.

187
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,449
- "Worldly"?
- Yeah.

188
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,451
Worldly.

189
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,653
Come on. Your grandparents
are missionaries.

190
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,355
They didn't stick around long.

191
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:34,892
<i>And all she ever did</i>
<i>was end of back here.</i>

192
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,394
<i>She's never gonna let me go.</i>

193
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,363
Well, tell her I'm going.
That'll make her happy.

194
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:40,898
Yeah.

195
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,200
Just ask her, you wuss.

196
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:44,695
Can I help you?

197
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,268
Alrighty, then.

198
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,523
I used to have a necklace
just like that once.

199
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,598
How come nobody
ever comes in here?

200
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,267
Excuse me.

201
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:28,472
I'm always across the street.

202
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,307
Nobody ever comes in.

203
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,610
No one reads books anymore.

204
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,313
I like them.

205
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,614
I do, too.

206
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:42,486
I just wish
we weren't the only ones.

207
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:46,323
If your aunt had a mustache,
she'd be your Uncle.

208
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,325
Come again.

209
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:51,161
It's just something
my mom says.

210
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:05,075
"Understanding your dreams."
That's a good book.

211
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,311
I get nightmares.

212
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,213
So does my daughter.

213
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,050
She has me sleep with her
when she has 'em.

214
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,486
Do you need anything else?

215
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,722
No, thank you.

216
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,133
Tess?

217
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,244
<i>Tess?</i>

218
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,787
Did you take your pill today?

219
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,625
<i>I know they don't</i>
<i>make you feel good,</i>

220
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,828
<i>but doctors prescribe them</i>
<i>for a reason.</i>

221
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,330
<i>You know?</i>

222
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,351
<i>You knew there were
gonna be side-effects.</i>

223
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:56,253
No... I know.

224
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:59,256
<i>That's better than</i>
<i>the alternative, right?</i>

225
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,291
I just wish
she Would talk to me.

226
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:02,726
I mean, you have a better
connection with her

227
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:04,494
and You're 10,000 Miles away.

228
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,396
<i>That's not true.</i>

229
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:09,266
<i>You're being too hard</i>
<i>on yourself.</i>

230
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:13,637
<i>The way Tess is...</i>
<i>Who she is inside...</i>

231
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,806
<i>Quiet, smart, awful.</i>

232
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,576
<i>She's just like you.</i>

233
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,546
<i>You have a stomachache?</i>

234
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,030
Let me get you some
antacid, okay?

235
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:11,648
Here. Tess.
Take two of these, okay?

236
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,450
You chew both of them?

237
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,823
<i>It won't stop.</i>

238
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,499
<i>I won't stop it.</i>

239
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,546
<i>I won't stop.</i>

240
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,716
<i>I won't stop.</i>

241
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:22,852
<i>I won't stop.</i>

242
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,855
<i>I won't stop.</i>

243
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:29,025
<i>I won't stop.</i>

244
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,095
<i>I won't stop.</i>

245
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,565
<i>I won't stop.</i>

246
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,735
<i>I won't stop.</i>

247
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,738
<i>I won't stop.</i>

248
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,841
<i>I won't stop.</i>

249
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,077
<i>I won't stop.</i>

250
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,748
<i>I won't stop.</i>

251
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,871
<i>This'll all be over.</i>
<i>This'll all be over.</i>

252
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:50,006
This'll all be over...

253
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,605
<i>Go away!</i>

254
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,974
Leave me alone!

255
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,976
Just go away!

256
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,845
<i>Go away!</i>

257
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,648
<i>Go away!</i>

258
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,788
Please stop! Stop it!

259
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,158
Please!

260
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,063
Tess?

261
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:00,637
Tess. Tess!

262
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,239
Tess!

263
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:06,209
Tess!

264
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:08,911
Tess!

265
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:25,762
Robert, she started
cutting herself.

266
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:45,854
<i>They're not gonna let
me leave, not even for this.</i>

267
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,860
Don't worry.

268
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,995
We'll get you more help.

269
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,202
Why didn't you tell me
you were in pain?

270
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,939
You always tell me.

271
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:24,113
Tess! Tess!

272
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,517
Help!

273
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:12,555
<i>♪ It'll be here just in time ♪</i>

274
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,393

00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,528

00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:59,101
<i>Help me. Please help me.</i>

279
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,237
- Hello?
<i>- Please.</i>

280
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,172
<i>Mom...</i>

281
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:04,640
<i>Mom, please help me.</i>

282
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:07,643
- Hello?
<i>- Please help me, mom.</i>

283
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,657
<i>Hey, this is Lucy's phone.
I'm not here right now.</i>

284
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,994
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>and I might get back to you.</i>

285
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:35,484
<i>Am I speaking with Tess?</i>

286
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:46,295
Do you see that
person over there?

287
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,121
There's no one there.

288
00:49:57,462 --> 00:50:00,730
Let's take a look at
the drawings we asked you to do.

289
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:11,073
You said you had a feeling

290
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:13,075
that something
was pushing you down.

291
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,677
You couldn't move.

292
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:21,550
Did you know that There's
a chemical in your brain

293
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:24,387
that makes you paralyzed
when you sleep?

294
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,756
It's so you don't get up
while you dream.

295
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:31,594
I wasn't sleeping.

296
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:33,295
<i>Were you taking</i>
<i>your medication?</i>

297
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:35,331
Yes.

298
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,500
But it doesn't matter.

299
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:39,668
They don't work anyway.

300
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,271
<i>With the hallucinations?</i>

301
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,273
The noises.

302
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:45,741
<i>What kind of noise?</i>

303
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:03,459
<i>They think
it's a severe case of.</i>

304
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:06,595
<i>Dissociative identity disorder.</i>

305
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:09,598
<i>The doctors are suggesting</i>
<i>I send her to an institution.</i>

306
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,101
<i>Where she can be supervised.</i>

307
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:16,573
You said she can move her limbs?

308
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:21,477
They need more tests.

309
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:25,381
Nothing's helped.

310
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:32,088
Well, let me try.

311
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,856
<i>Do you believe in God?</i>

312
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:38,861
I don't know.

313
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,420
"Be strong in the lord"...

314
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:07,189
<i>"...And the power of his might."</i>

315
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:10,226
<i>Put on the whole armor
of God so that you.</i>

316
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:13,596
May be able to stand against
the schemings of the devil.

317
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:17,466
<i>For we do not rustle against</i>
<i>the flesh and the blood.</i>

318
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,902
<i>Or against the
principalities that powers.</i>

319
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:23,873
"And against the spiritual host
in these heavenly places."

320
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:27,743
<i>That's not going to help.</i>

321
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:35,351
I talked to your
little brother...

322
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:36,919
<i>Stephan, right?</i>

323
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:38,420
He looks about nine.

324
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:42,258
Stephan says he forgives you

325
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,226
<i>for what you did.</i>

326
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,897
<i>Where is he?</i>

327
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,300
What was that?

328
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:54,937
I didn't say anything.

329
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,842
You're not serious?

330
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,844
Jessica, I want to help you
in any way I can,

331
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:04,246
but I have no knowledge here.

332
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:08,817
There's a seminary in St. Louis

333
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,253
that has experience
with this sort of thing.

334
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:13,589
I'd love for her
to talk to someone there

335
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:15,524
if I can get them to see her,

336
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,494
but they'd have to meet her
outside of the hospital.

337
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:22,264
They're making me
talk to a social worker

338
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:23,899
before I can take her home.

339
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,939
Well, maybe I can help with that
if they trust me here.

340
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:02,705
Here you go.

341
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:13,549
Are you taking me home?

342
00:55:11,442 --> 00:55:13,575
It's for your own safety.

343
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,845
You have to eat.

344
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,483
Doesn't matter.

345
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:05,454
<i>I'll make 'em go away.</i>

346
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:13,862
<i>What was that?</i>

347
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:41,056
Tess!

348
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:46,862
Tess!

349
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:49,798
Tess!

350
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:33,702
I'm home.

351
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:39,341
<i>I traveled a
lot when I was a kid.</i>

352
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:41,276
<i>My parents were missionaries,</i>
<i>so we...</i>

353
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,145
Traveled all over the world,

354
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:45,280
but India was our first stop.

355
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,184
We'd only been there a few days

356
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:51,186
when I noticed all these people

357
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:54,022
filing into the house
across the street.

358
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:57,125
So I snuck over...

359
00:59:57,127 --> 01:00:00,162
And all the people
were sitting in the semicircle.

360
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:01,763
<i>And...</i>

361
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:05,734
<i>This woman was kneeling</i>
<i>in the center.</i>

362
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:10,072
<i>Swaying her head</i>
<i>back and forth...</i>

363
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:12,908
<i>Until something...</i>

364
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,676
<i>Overtook her.</i>

365
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:24,086
<i>She removed her hair</i>
<i>from her face.</i>

366
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:26,622
<i>And...</i>

367
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:29,124
<i>She kept staring until.</i>

368
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,660
<i>Her eyes began</i>
<i>to change colors.</i>

369
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,900
<i>And they all raised their hands</i>
<i>wanting to speak to the woman,</i>

370
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:42,371
<i>actually speak to their dead</i>
<i>loved ones through her.</i>

371
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:50,312
She Would do this every month.

372
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,681
<i>I Would say they were
taking advantage of her,</i>

373
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:54,182
<i>but I found out.</i>

374
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:56,952
<i>She willingly went through it.</i>

375
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:58,654
<i>She considered it a gift.</i>

376
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:01,323
<i>To bring the people</i>
<i>in that room some peace.</i>

377
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:05,327
<i>And to convince the spirits</i>
<i>they could finally move on.</i>

378
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:08,697
<i>I think your daughter</i>
<i>may have the same gift,</i>

379
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:11,166
<i>and I think my daughter</i>
<i>is inside your daughter.</i>

380
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,303
<i>Everything's that's happened</i>
<i>to Tess.</i>

381
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:17,005
<i>Could be a result of this gift.</i>

382
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,008
<i>Stop calling it that.</i>

383
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,530
<i>Sorry.</i>

384
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:25,781
So what else makes you think
this is real?

385
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:27,416
She came into my store one day

386
01:01:27,418 --> 01:01:29,985
and told me she had a
necklace like this one.

387
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:32,154
- She's had a lot of necklaces.
- And then she said a saying

388
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:34,690
that I used to say to Lucy
that she hated

389
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:37,726
<i>that my mother always said to me
that I'm sure when she grew up.</i>

390
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,394
<i>She Would probably</i>
<i>say to her kids.</i>

391
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:41,763
What was it?

392
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,433
"If your aunt had a mustache,
she'd be your Uncle."

393
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:50,439
<i>Why Would Tess have this?</i>

394
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:54,142
<i>I think some people
are just born with it.</i>

395
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:56,478
<i>The Indian girl didn't ask why.</i>

396
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,015
<i>She just accepted it and dealt</i>
<i>with it in her own way.</i>

397
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:01,349
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

398
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:04,019
<i>I Can't just accept it.</i>

399
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:08,763
<i>Maybe this is all
too crazy to believe.</i>

400
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:19,429
<i>Tess.</i>

401
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:33,815
Where's dad?

402
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:36,485
Ah... he left.

403
01:02:36,487 --> 01:02:39,254
It was really hard after.

404
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,223
<i>Can I talk to him?</i>

405
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,761
<i>It's not a good idea, Lucy.</i>

406
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:50,065
<i>He'll never believe this.</i>

407
01:02:55,906 --> 01:03:00,108
That's Martha and Rena, Becka.

408
01:03:01,545 --> 01:03:03,505
<i>My two cousins,</i>
<i>crystal and Lukas.</i>

409
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,316
And pa Jeffrey.

410
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,152
<i>Is that right?</i>

411
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:49,991
What's in that locket?

412
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:54,582
I never got a chance
to put anything in it.

413
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:57,499
My dad.

414
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,461
He only gave it to me
a week before.

415
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:04,139
But if you need more proof.

416
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:06,208
<i>I'm sorry</i>
<i>for doing this to her.</i>

417
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:10,912
I just wanted to be
more like myself.

418
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:16,151
Lucy's appendix burst
when she was eight years old.

419
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:26,094
I'm not evil.

420
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:02,030
<i>Just give me
some time alone with her.</i>

421
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:06,301
<i>She's just confused...</i>
<i>Stubborn.</i>

422
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,139
<i>You want to be alone with her?</i>

423
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,908
<i>For how long?</i>

424
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,576
- <i> A few days.</i>
<i>- A few days?</i>

425
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:17,078
<i>However long it takes.</i>

426
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,683
<i>Look. I'll let you talk
to her now with me in the room,</i>

427
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:25,220
<i>otherwise,</i>
<i>I have to take her away.</i>

428
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:27,983
<i>And what if she
doesn't want to go?</i>

429
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:30,525
Please let me stay.

430
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:34,095
I worked so hard
coming back to you.

431
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,672
I don't want you to go.

432
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:46,041
This isn't good for you.

433
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:47,475
You're only gonna get
more confused,

434
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,311
and then you'll never be able
to move on.

435
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:51,613
But I don't want to move on.

436
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,716
It breaks my heart,
but it's the right thing to do.

437
01:05:56,586 --> 01:05:59,287
For Tess and there for you.

438
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,557
- Please let her come back.
- She doesn't want to.

439
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,427
The pills, the doctor's...
She's done with all of them.

440
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:08,396
She's in a place
where they Can't hurt her.

441
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:11,733
I'm sorry, but she doesn't
trust you anymore.

442
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:13,568
You have to move on, Lucinda.

443
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:17,072
- I Can't control it, mom.
- I know you can.

444
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:19,207
- I Can't.
- Yes...

445
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,676
You can.

446
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:23,478
Your other spirits...

447
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,014
If I leave, I may never
be able to come back.

448
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:27,315
Do you want that?

449
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:34,723
You have to try.

450
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,294
I'm so sorry
for everything I said.

451
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:41,296
Just for everything.

452
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:43,098
I wish I wasn't
such a little brat.

453
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,767
No, no, no, don't...
Don't say that.

454
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:48,770
I'd still be here with you and dad
and you Would still be together.

455
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:51,106
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

456
01:06:56,213 --> 01:07:00,148
I just want you
to be at peace, Lucy,

457
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,450
and to be in a better place.

458
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:07,155
Okay.

459
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:21,263
What's going on?

460
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,775
I love you, mom.

461
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:28,576
I love you, too.

462
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:36,718
Is that Tess?

463
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,553
I'm not sure.

464
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,555
You have to try harder, Lucy.
Is that Tess?

465
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:02,744
<i>- What's going on?</i>
<i>- I don't know!</i>

466
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:16,157
Tess?

467
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:18,293
Tess.

468
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:22,330
- Tess?
- Just stop that.

469
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:52,327
What is she saying?

470
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:56,238
I Can't tell.

471
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:29,859
<i>Tess?</i>

472
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:40,441
<i>Lucy?</i>

473
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,207
Who are you?

474
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,406
Ugh! Tess!

475
01:10:57,954 --> 01:11:01,689
Tess! Stop! -It's okay.
There's no way out down there!

476
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:03,925
<i>No!</i>

477
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:49,904
- What are you doing?
- She might be hurt.

478
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:53,374
She's my daughter.

479
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:14,021
<i>Tess! Tess!</i>

480
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:16,724
<i>Please come out!</i>

481
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:21,496
<i>Please come back to me!</i>

482
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:25,733
<i>I'll keep you safe.</i>

483
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,603
<i>I'm begging you!</i>
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

484
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:30,471
<i>I'll do better! I swear.</i>

485
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:32,740
<i>I just need you back.</i>

486
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:50,191
Tess?

487
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:20,655
Where's my mom?

488
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,592
<i>Lucy's a strong soul.</i>

489
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:27,061
<i>That's why she was able</i>
<i>to fight her way back.</i>

490
01:14:28,932 --> 01:14:30,231
Maybe...

491
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,635
She just needs closure.

492
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:42,043
I don't know, but isn't
that what they all want?

493
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,080
I think they
just don't want to leave.

494
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:40,635
<i>Morgan's gone.</i>

495
01:15:52,315 --> 01:15:54,035
She'll come back.

496
01:15:56,185 --> 01:15:58,686
Everyone's trying to move on.

497
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:04,825
Even you?

498
01:16:20,677 --> 01:16:22,710
Tess?

499
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:24,579
- Lucy.
- Tess.

500
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:30,585
Baby, it's only
gonna get worse.

501
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:32,853
Trust me, please?

502
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,897
Can I just have one more night?

503
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:48,869
Sure.

504
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:28,409
Hi.

505
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:47,481
Lucy?

506
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:52,586
Do you really want to go back?

507
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:56,851
<i>I'll tell your mom</i>
<i>You're not sure.</i>

508
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,184
Ugh!

509
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:26,921
Ahh!

510
01:20:36,465 --> 01:20:39,200
Ugh! Ahh!

511
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:48,442
Lucy?

512
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:09,330
I came back for you, mom.

513
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:14,001
I won't leave you again.

514
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:27,314
Wait.

515
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:53,233
We can move back if you want.

516
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:58,572
Whatever you think is best.

517
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,577
I'll do better for you.

518
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:07,047
I know you will.

519
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:51,158
Let me see.

520
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:59,033
You got to keep
building up your calluses.

521
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:00,801
Keep playing, okay?

522
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:03,470
I will.

523
01:24:05,107 --> 01:24:07,141
Promise me you won't give up.

524
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:11,445
I promise.

525
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:14,548
She seems better to you, right?

526
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,617
You don't think so?

527
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:20,154
I just don't know anymore.

528
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:22,122
<i>She can be a normal kid again.</i>

529
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:24,825
