[Richards] January, 1945,

11
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,227
the last major German
offensive of the war.

12
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,498
The Battle of the
Bulge has collapsed.

13
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,200
Allied Forces in France
prepare for the invasion

14
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:53,804
of Germany from the West,
having been stockpiling men

15
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:58,611
and machinery since D-Day,
June 6th, the previous summer.

16
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,713
From the east, Russian
forces are pushing hard,

17
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:05,250
creating a vice
grip from all sides.

18
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:08,653
Years of Allied
bombardment have all

19
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:12,623
but crippled the once mighty
military manufacturing capacity

20
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,927
of the Third Reich.

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,394
However, there is one facility

22
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:21,032
still assembling large
quantities of the V-2 rocket,

23
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:23,868
the Kohnstein, a
former gypsum mine,

24
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,239
located inside a mountain
in Thuringia, Germany.

25
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:30,073
The Kohnstein is also

26
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:34,946
the only major manufacturing
plant remaining for the ME-262,

27
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:39,016
the first operational
jet fighter in history.

28
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:42,085
[plane engine roaring]

29
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:45,288
Here, protected by the
subterranean environment,

30
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,194
the war continues on these
advanced technological terrors.

31
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,299
[Rob] Malcolm, who
is that beautiful woman

32
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,803
in that picture on
the wall behind you?

33
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,338
That's my daughter,
my only child.

34
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,008
She was killed in a
V-2 rocket attack.

35
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,980
So you see, Rob, this is
quite personal for me.

36
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:13,249
The Germans are
having severe problems

37
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:15,318
with their supply lines thanks

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,556
to your 17s and our Lancasters.

39
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:22,793
The most recent communications
do not concern the V-9,

40
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:24,962
they concern the ME-262.

41
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,098
Well my boys are
still seein' 'em.

42
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,367
Our enemy remains a group
of clever individuals,

43
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:35,374
knowing we would destroy
any convoy or train

44
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:38,509
with military applications,

45
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:41,112
the Germans have been
using passenger trains

46
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:42,513
to transport their goods.

47
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:46,149
They simply cut the tops
off of passenger cars,

48
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:51,156
fill them full of goods,
fuel, entire engines at times,

49
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:55,526
reattach the roof,
making them indiscernible

50
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,463
from an actual train
carrying civilian passengers.

51
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:01,231
Well, what do you recommend?

52
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:05,201
A precision bombing
raid using one of your 17s

53
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,738
without the usual escort.

54
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,372
Damn risky.

55
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,175
Most special operations are.

56
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:13,611
You have the routes
and departure time?

57
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:15,079
I do.

58
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:17,448
Well, I'll have to put
the word out for volunteers.

59
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,152
Of course, however, this
pilot that lead the raid

60
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:22,586
on the mobile airfield...

61
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,955
Yes, Cole Philips,
he's a good man.

62
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:26,492
Might he be available?

63
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,600
Well, I see you found
your long-lost brother.

64
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:38,102
Yeah, can you believe it, sir?

65
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:40,638
Well, I was as surprised as
anybody that he wandered in.

66
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,940
So you did cost Colonel
Richards a P-38,

67
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,240
what you score for us?

68
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,342
Well, Colonel, your
plan worked well.

69
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:49,379
A lot of planes were blown up
on the ground, mostly 190s.

70
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:50,948
What about those 262s?

71
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,415
Yes, sir, three were there,

72
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,952
two were destroyed,
one I didn't get to.

73
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:58,155
Well, I'd say pretty
successful venture.

74
00:04:58,157 --> 00:04:59,757
Thank you, sir.

75
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,224
Major Phillips, I
filled your brother in

76
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:02,560
on this Luftwaffe Colonel.

77
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,595
Yes, sir, he chased
me part of the way home

78
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:05,629
in one of his jets.

79
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:06,864
Really?

80
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,933
Yes, fast but not
very maneuverable.

81
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:10,468
You got lucky.

82
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,838
I want you to spend some
time with your brother.

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,841
Go out, celebrate,
take a night out.

84
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:20,010
And I'll be back here
tomorrow with Colonel Richards

85
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:22,913
and we'll set up the briefing
for the next big bombing run.

86
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:24,181
I want both of you there.

87
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:25,415
Of course.

88
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:28,152
You ready to get
back in the sky, Joe?

89
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:29,587
It's all I've been
thinking about, Colonel,

90
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:31,756
that and my wife and little
girl back in Georgia.

91
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:34,725
Yeah, Cole, I want
you to sit this one out.

92
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,328
I've got something else for you.

93
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,329
Am I being taken out
of the sky again, sir?

94
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,831
Well, we've got
some intelligence,

95
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,800
some very good intelligence

96
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,736
on a new supply
train for the 262s.

97
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:49,140
And I would say it's
about 60% reliable,

98
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,142
but this could be
a wild goose chase.

99
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:54,812
We believe those remaining
262s are being loaded

100
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:57,784
on a train heading east,
deeper into Germany.

101
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:01,619
And we don't know exactly
where they're going yet,

102
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:03,487
but we do know the route
they're gonna take.

103
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:06,090
It's a slow-moving
target, a bomb raid.

104
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:08,526
Well, not in the
traditional sense.

105
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:11,294
The 262s are actually
not yet assembled.

106
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,531
What's on the train are
all the parts needed

107
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:17,067
to put these together,
down to the nuts and bolts.

108
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:18,235
So you want to strike

109
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:19,970
before they get a
chance to assemble them.

110
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:21,172
There's one wrinkle though.

111
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,406
The Germans are using
a passenger train.

112
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:25,609
And so from a distance
it's gonna look like

113
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,377
we're attacking civilians.

114
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:30,447
And the folks up at headquarters
would not be pleased

115
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:33,586
if they saw us doing some
barbaric things like these Nazis.

116
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,056
One good payload from a B-17
ought to take care of this.

117
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:42,726
But as you all saw walking
over here, everyone's gone,

118
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:43,894
they're out on a
mission right now,

119
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:45,531
I don't have anything for you.

120
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:48,098
When are they due back?

121
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,235
About three hours.

122
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,571
Considering
re-fueling, re-arming,

123
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,306
take about four
hours to take-off.

124
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:56,740
But we don't have
that much time.

125
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:58,576
What about Lillian,
sir, my old ship.

126
00:06:58,578 --> 00:06:59,910
She's still sitting down there.

127
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,344
Oh, come on now.

128
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:04,215
Do you think that thing is
really safe, that it would fly?

129
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,217
[Cole] She made
it home okay for me.

130
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:08,686
Doesn't matter, we
don't have a crew.

131
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,420
Well, all we
need's a bombardier.

132
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:12,122
And you could do that, Joe.

133
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:14,625
Hey, I'm just a tail gunner.

134
00:07:14,627 --> 00:07:17,127
All you have to
do is push a button.

135
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:20,365
Cole, I just got
back from almost dying.

136
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:23,801
I mean I just got back.

137
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:25,736
Come on, Joe, you have to go!

138
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:27,304
Why do I have to go?

139
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,772
Because it's the big one, Joe.

140
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:30,808
Don't you remember the
movie when we were a kids?

141
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,943
Why was it so important for us

142
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,947
to see that airplane movie, Joe?

143
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:40,084
[sighs] Because
it was our father.

144
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:41,585
That's right.

145
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,255
It was the story of our father
and a lot of other fathers.

146
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:47,159
And that's who you and I are
a continuation of that story.

147
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,228
Well, what we have is something
that's very top secret.

148
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,765
And you're gonna have
to come in really low

149
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:58,002
so that you can see who's
on the passenger train.

150
00:07:58,004 --> 00:08:02,273
If it's Nazi soldiers,
take it out, blow it up.

151
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:05,878
If it's boxes and crates
that you see, blow it up.

152
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:08,979
But if it's
passengers, civilians,

153
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,248
just come on back
home, forget about it.

154
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,684
Hey Joe, before we go I'm
gonna grab a photographer

155
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,819
and have him take a
picture of our plane.

156
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,623
Whatever makes
you happy, brother.

157
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,025
I just gotta push
a button, right?

158
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:22,259
Right.

159
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:23,696
Colonel, how do we
find that train?

160
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,000
[plane engine roaring]

161
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:36,140
Well, according
to the time table,

162
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,577
that train should be leaving
the station any minute.

163
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,648
[train hissing]

164
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,317
Thank you for meeting
me, Herr von Braun.

165
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,818
Your reputation precedes you.

166
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,120
Colonel, I didn't
want to introduce you

167
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:53,059
to this aircraft until I thought
it could be of use to you.

168
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,031
These are the updated
plans for the ME-163A,

169
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:00,967
they are calling it the Comet.

170
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:06,670
Yes, I have seen early
plans for this years ago.

171
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,206
It is famous for the amount
of pilots is has killed

172
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,741
during testing and training.

173
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:13,477
It took several years to
work out all the problems,

174
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,045
from what I hear.

175
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:17,748
If they use the same
engines as the 262,

176
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,883
then unfortunately,
there isn't enough

177
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:21,518
to go around as it is.

178
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,587
They aren't Junkers engines.

179
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,825
This is a light aircraft, and
it has no turbojets at all.

180
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:29,626
It uses a rocket.

181
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:31,261
That makes more sense.

182
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:33,897
This does not have the
appearance of an airplane.

183
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,033
This has the appearance
of a spacecraft.

184
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,303
We can only hope.

185
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:42,206
The rocket in the Comet
uses a bi-propellant design

186
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:46,110
that Walker and his
crew copied from my V-2.

187
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:49,413
Of course, they say
it was vice versa.

188
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:51,415
I have a few questions.

189
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,950
What about armament?

190
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:57,189
30 millimeter cannons, the
108s the same as your jets.

191
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,425
But, two not four.

192
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,092
And handling?

193
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:06,830
Colonel, it will never
turn on a dime like our 109s.

194
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:09,099
But the fuel delivery system is

195
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:12,403
actually much better
than your 262s.

196
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,338
As you are more than aware,

197
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,373
quick throttle
movements have resulted

198
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,576
in all manner of problems
with your engines.

199
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,614
Flame outs, engine failure,
et cetera, et cetera.

200
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:25,783
Yes, yes, but I make
up for these issues

201
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:27,651
with the speed of the aircraft.

202
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:29,686
Refresh my memory, Colonel.

203
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:32,756
What is the top
speed of your 262?

204
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:36,528
My jets regularly touch
700 kilometers per hour.

205
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,296
The last test
flight for the 163-A

206
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:41,799
that I attended was in July.

207
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:46,772
I can verify that the pilot
named Hitmar flew the Comet

208
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:51,777
to a speed approaching
1,300 kilos per hour.

209
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:56,382
You cannot possible
approach that with this toy.

210
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,049
That is impossible.

211
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,717
I was there, Colonel.

212
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,822
I saw it with my own eyes.

213
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:06,824
When can I take delivery?

214
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,358
A number of weeks.

215
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,194
You'll have to go through
your normal channels

216
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:11,762
at Messerschmidt though.

217
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:15,032
I am only here to
endorse the aircraft.

218
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:17,134
Of course, Her von Braun.

219
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,939
And congratulations on
your V-2 rocket program.

220
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,140
But there's one more
piece of information

221
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,975
I would like to know.

222
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,444
Yes?

223
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:29,279
I have heard fantastical
stories about a rocket

224
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:32,116
that uses the same
technology as the V-2

225
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:35,018
and I have heard this
rocket has the possibility

226
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,457
of reaching the other
side of the Atlantic.

227
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,658
I am afraid that
I am not at liberty

228
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,263
to discuss this with
you right now, Colonel.

229
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:47,397
But that is not a denial.

230
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,099
You noticed.

231
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:50,604
Colonel, I must take my leave.

232
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:53,770
Goodbye.

233
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:54,574
Goodbye.

234
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,076
Everything is ready, Colonel.

235
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:01,446
All right, your cargo
is desperately needed

236
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:02,580
at the Kohnstein.

237
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:04,116
You may leave immediately.

238
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,554
Am I to understand

239
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:12,055
that there's no military
presence on this train?

240
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:13,625
You are not to
have the appearance

241
00:12:13,627 --> 00:12:15,227
of a military transport.

242
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:17,728
If you face imminent danger,

243
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,797
you may break radio
silence for 30 seconds.

244
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,234
I will not be far away.

245
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,503
[sighs] Yes, sir.

246
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:27,773
I remember what you told
me to say on the radio.

247
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:36,048
[train chugging]

248
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,989
[plane engine roaring]

249
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,225
Anything?

250
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,160
Just what you see.

251
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:53,165
[plane engine roaring]

252
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,701
So how's fuel?

253
00:12:57,703 --> 00:12:59,571
It's good for now.

254
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:02,708
[plane engine roaring]

255
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:13,518
You sure this is the
right stretch of track?

256
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,385
Well, this is where
he pointed me to.

257
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:18,222
But intelligence is never 100%.

258
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,757
Why don't you turn on the radio

259
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,195
and see if they could tip
us off to where they're at.

260
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,535
[radio crackling]

261
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:34,171
Good evening, here is
The Dresden Doll once again

262
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:37,341
to make your nights
a little less lonely.

263
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:40,545
And now my darlings,
have you ever thought

264
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:44,551
about how many Americans
have German ancestors?

265
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:48,752
Do you realize that when
you are bombing Germany,

266
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:51,991
you may be bombing your
own hereditary homeland?

267
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,791
Perhaps you are
killing your cousins

268
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,662
or perhaps even
your grandparents.

269
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:02,099
And we all share a
wonderful cultural legacy.

270
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:05,802
We are of the people,
just as you are.

271
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:09,106
And all we want to do
is to make a better life

272
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:11,643
for our folk, just as you do.

273
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:14,614
We should not be enemies.

274
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,051
Why do you attack us, we
would never attack you.

275
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,388
Have you never heard of the
German American Federation.

276
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,726
We have many friends and
allies in the United States.

277
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:32,929
And you know the Dresden
Doll is your special friend.

278
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:34,931
So lay down your arms and come.

279
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,834
We share a bottle
of Schnapps, no?

280
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,104
[both laughing]

281
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:42,839
Can you believe this bitch?

282
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,007
You gotta hand
it to her, buddy.

283
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,842
She's good at what she does.

284
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,081
[plane engine roaring]

285
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:51,848
Shouldn't be long now.

286
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,153
Get down to the bombardier
station, get ready.

287
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:57,054
Aye, aye, skipper.

288
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:59,222
[upbeat music]

289
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:00,057
Hey, Cole?

290
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:00,826
Yeah.

291
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:03,763
It's good to be back onboard.

292
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,367
[plane engine roaring]

293
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:42,535
Wait, wait.

294
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:49,408
Straight ahead, right
out there on the horizon.

295
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,644
Oh, good eye.

296
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:55,480
Almost good enough
to be a pilot.

297
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:58,752
[plane engine roaring]

298
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,255
[track chugging]

299
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:08,559
[plane engine roaring]

300
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,728
All right, get back
down, take up position.

301
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,532
Get ready, we're
gonna follow him.

302
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:19,837
This is to the pilot of
the single American bomber

303
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,508
that is following my train.

304
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:27,614
Please be advised, this is
not a military operation.

305
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,588
We have no soldiers or
armament on this train.

306
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,291
This is a civilian transport.

307
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,295
Repeat, this is a
civilian transport.

308
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:47,467
[plane engine roaring]

309
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:58,845
[wind howling]

310
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:50,728
[man gasps]

311
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,162
You're a Jew.

312
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:53,764
You are observant.

313
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:56,233
Or did this give it away?

314
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:58,370
What is a Polish
girl doing here?

315
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,440
You speak Polish?

316
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:06,311
Yes, and French and
German and Russian and Greek

317
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:09,714
and Latin and of course,
Yiddish and Hebrew.

318
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:12,583
You Jews think you
are so smart and clever.

319
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:14,854
Calling yourselves
the Chosen People.

320
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,989
That is what we
tell ourselves.

321
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:21,126
But often I wish He had
chosen someone else.

322
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:23,995
What are you doing here?

323
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:25,897
It is quiet here.

324
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:27,565
I come here for a
few minutes each day

325
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:32,003
to pray for my family,
my people and myself.

326
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,641
Do you think He hears
your prayers, Jew?

327
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:37,075
I can only hope.

328
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,412
But tell me, why is
a Polish girl working

329
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,683
for these monsters?

330
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:46,553
This of no concern of yours.

331
00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:51,288
I have a name, it is Issac.

332
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,324
What is yours?

333
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:55,927
My name is Anna.

334
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:57,662
[Issac] That is a Jewish name.

335
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:01,264
It is not Jewish,
I am not a Jew!

336
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,169
Anna comes from Hannah,
which is a Jewish name.

337
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:08,539
No matter, I can report
you for being here.

338
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,074
They will ask you
why you were here

339
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:13,143
and I will tell them the truth,

340
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:17,147
I came here to pray but
you to steal some time.

341
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:19,884
And I think my work is
more valued than that

342
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:21,052
of an assembly line girl.

343
00:19:21,054 --> 00:19:23,454
You work for them also?

344
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:24,855
No, I come here

345
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:27,259
because I enjoy the
atmosphere and the company.

346
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:29,727
Why do you do this?

347
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:31,931
For my family,
to keep them alive.

348
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:34,500
Why are you here?

349
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:38,201
They promised to cleanse
the Jews from Poland

350
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:40,337
and destroy the Russians.

351
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:44,010
And you believe them and
they have made you their slave.

352
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,745
But you are very pretty,

353
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:51,015
I think they would have chosen
another occupation for you.

354
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:53,784
Dirty minded little Jew!

355
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:57,922
Forgive me, but
in a war people do

356
00:19:57,924 --> 00:20:00,156
what they must to survive.

357
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,793
An ugly man could
work an assembly line

358
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:04,797
as well as an
attractive young lady.

359
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,634
I wanted the other occupation.

360
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:12,538
Good food, clean dresses.

361
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:14,339
So?

362
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,678
I had a brother, Stefan.

363
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:21,614
He was always so
happy and playful.

364
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:25,049
But they took him away.

365
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:26,953
They said he was mentally unfit.

366
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:28,988
I understand.

367
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:34,627
Anna, I did not see
you, nor you me.

368
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:43,002
[whispering in foreign language]

369
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:48,271
I'm gonna need your
help with this, Joe!

370
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:50,306
I'm gonna fly right
up beside that train.

371
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:53,311
I need you to look out, see
what you can see inside of it.

372
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,014
You got it!

373
00:20:56,115 --> 00:21:01,020
[train chugging]
[gentle music]

374
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:10,395
All right, what
do you see, Joe?

375
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,265
[train chugging]

376
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:17,200
I don't see anything.

377
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:19,369
Can you see the windows on
the other side of the train,

378
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:21,140
can you see all the way through?

379
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:24,842
[Joe] I don't see anything.

380
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:26,276
And you couldn't
see through the cars

381
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:28,411
to the other windows.

382
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,216
I don't see anyone,
there's no one on this train.

383
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:34,384
You can't tell
anything from back there.

384
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:38,589
I saw one man on this train,
the engineer, that's it.

385
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:41,828
[plane engine roaring]

386
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:46,229
Any slower than this
and we won't be flying.

387
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:48,933
This train's not
in it for the race.

388
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:51,637
[train chugging]

389
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:54,607
Hey Cole, Cole, look out!

390
00:21:55,742 --> 00:21:58,876
[plane engine roaring]

391
00:21:58,878 --> 00:21:59,679
Hold on.

392
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:05,918
[dramatic music]
[plane engine roaring]

393
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:08,652
That was pretty even close.

394
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:11,387
Where the hell did
that buzzard come from?

395
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:12,857
Gonna make on the guns?

396
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:15,059
No, no, no, get back on the
stick with the bombardier.

397
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:16,394
Gotta drop those eggs.

398
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:22,235
[plane engine roaring]
[dramatic music]

399
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:26,771
Hey, Joe, I'm gonna climb
a couple hundred feet,

400
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:29,874
get us up above 600 so you
can drop that carton of eggs.

401
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:30,877
Get ready!

402
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:37,617
[train chugging]

403
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:40,985
I'm headed back
to the train, Joe.

404
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:43,489
I don't see our jet but
I'm sure he's still around.

405
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:49,796
[plane engine roaring]
[train chugging]

406
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,242
[guns firing]

407
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:05,810
What are you doing, Cole?

408
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:08,648
[bombs whistling]

409
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:12,885
[explosion booming]

410
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:17,788
[plane engine roaring]

411
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,391
Come on, come on.

412
00:23:21,427 --> 00:23:24,263
[engines roaring]

413
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:39,946
[train chugging]

414
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,248
What are you doin', Cole?

415
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:46,650
Look, we gave it our best shot.

416
00:23:46,652 --> 00:23:49,653
But we only had one shot.

417
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:51,090
It's time to get back, buddy.

418
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:55,461
[plane engine roaring]

419
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:08,138
That jet pilot
know what he's doing.

420
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,139
I don't think we're
gonna make it back

421
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:10,408
in this crate today, Joe.

422
00:24:11,978 --> 00:24:15,214
[plane engine roaring]

423
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,519
[train chugging]

424
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:25,823
Joe, I want you out of the plane
as soon as we're jump safe.

425
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:26,659
Okay.

426
00:24:28,027 --> 00:24:29,426
What the hell are you gonna do?

427
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:31,030
This ain't no suicide mission.

428
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:37,270
[engines roaring]
[dramatic music]

429
00:24:54,787 --> 00:24:55,621
Stop.

430
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:58,124
Do you hear me?

431
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:01,825
Stop the train, now!

432
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:04,764
[brakes squealing]

433
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:07,398
Stop the train!

434
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,568
I'm trying!

435
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,305
[guns firing]

436
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:16,140
[brakes squealing]

[explosion booming]

439
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:21,013
No, no, no!

440
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:26,951
[train crashing]

441
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:29,119
[pilot groaning]

00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:34,126
[dramatic music]
[metal crashing]

443
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,435
[both gasping]

444
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:44,870
[Joe] Easy, easy, easy.

445
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:48,973
[birds chirping]

446
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:50,076
[Cole groaning]
Easy.

447
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:02,188
Oh, damn, I'm gonna
miss that old crate.

448
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:05,089
We'll get you another one.

449
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:06,390
You okay?

450
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:07,693
Yeah, I'm sore.

451
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:10,194
And my legs hurt.

452
00:26:10,196 --> 00:26:12,863
Just be ready to grab
your pistol at any time.

453
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,799
You should get the Medal
of Honor for that one.

454
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:20,004
[laughs] Yes, best intentional
crash of a B-17 ever.

455
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:21,972
[Joe laughing]

456
00:26:21,974 --> 00:26:25,642
What's the story on
Cole and his brother, sir?

457
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:27,678
Well, it's not good.

458
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Yes, and?

459
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:31,982
Well, the 17 went down.

460
00:26:31,984 --> 00:26:34,086
But Joe and Cole, they did jump.

461
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:38,724
So, I'm gonna need a volunteer
to go and pick them up.

462
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:40,693
That's what I figured.

463
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:46,130
[sighs] I'm surprised the
Germans ain't shown up yet.

464
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:50,167
Yeah, their resources are
spread pretty thin right now.

465
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:52,836
Let's take stock of what
we got in case they do.

466
00:26:52,838 --> 00:26:55,639
I got a pistol and a
flare, what do you got.

467
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:58,277
I got my pistol
and a chocolate bar.

468
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:00,445
[both laughing]

469
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:02,980
Chocolate bar, break out.

470
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:06,884
I'll trade you my flare
for half of it. [laughs]

471
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:08,488
That sounds like a fair shake.

472
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:16,962
There you go.

473
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:20,931
I'll give you the flare later.

474
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,133
[Joe laughs]

475
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:28,140
[sirens wailing]
[dramatic music]

476
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:37,943
[Ellen gasping]

477
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:44,414
[Maggie] You all
right, sweetheart?

478
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,684
Uh huh, okay.

479
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:47,619
[Maggie] Bad dreams again.

480
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:49,119
Yeah.

481
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:50,954
Well, you never want to
talk about your dreams,

482
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:53,190
but you can, if you want to.

483
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:56,996
Well, yes, but this time
it wasn't a nightmare.

484
00:28:58,164 --> 00:29:00,433
But still about
your father, right?

485
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:02,833
Well, I think any day now

486
00:29:02,835 --> 00:29:04,968
he's gonna be walking
up to the front door

487
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,273
and he's gonna give us both
the biggest hugs in the world.

488
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:11,377
And this war will all be over.

489
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,013
Well, you know what I think?

490
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:18,715
I think you need
to get back in bed

491
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,417
and go back to sleep
so you can back

492
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:22,656
to that dream, that's
a wonderful dream.

493
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:29,629
Love you, Momma.

494
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:32,497
I lovey you, sweetheart.

495
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:34,634
And you know your
daddy loves you too.

496
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:37,569
I know he does.

497
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:40,172
[somber music]

498
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:45,945
I tell ya, I sure do
miss my little girl.

499
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:48,712
Well, I miss Maggie of course,

500
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:53,719
but, I'm missing her growing up.

501
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:55,020
How old is she now?

502
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:59,593
11, I've missed two
birthdays already.

503
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:05,162
You reckon you'll
ever settle down?

504
00:30:05,164 --> 00:30:08,398
Hm, maybe I'll find me
a nice French mademoiselle

505
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,267
over here and take
her home with me.

506
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,638
Think Mama would like that?

507
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:14,938
I reckon she'd be fine with it

508
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,674
as long as you give her
some more grand young ens.

509
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:18,877
Oh Lord, I guess
that's part of it.

510
00:30:20,513 --> 00:30:21,713
Yep.

511
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:24,283
[gentle music]

512
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:28,521
Hey Joe, come on!

513
00:30:32,592 --> 00:30:34,258
Hey, what are you doing, Joe?

514
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,792
Why aren't you up?

515
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,028
The movies, Mom wants
us to go to the movies

516
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,499
with her after supper tonight.

517
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,166
I haven't had any bites yet.

518
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:45,269
What, come on, Joe,
you have to come.

519
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:46,439
This is the big one.

520
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:50,240
What do you mean, the big one?

521
00:30:50,242 --> 00:30:51,275
Are you kidding?

522
00:30:51,277 --> 00:30:53,713
Pilots, war planes, explosions.

523
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,515
Fine, you do whatever you want.

524
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:59,450
Me and mom will go without ya.

525
00:30:59,452 --> 00:31:00,819
Don't want to but we will.

526
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,955
Mom ain't gonna
go with just you.

527
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:06,823
Fine, then I'll drive
and leave both of you.

528
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:08,426
I have to see this movie, Joe.

529
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:09,862
You do not understand.

530
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:15,934
[birds chirping]
[footsteps thudding]

531
00:31:22,808 --> 00:31:25,008
Thanks, Ma, that was great.

532
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,211
Yes, ma'am, thank you.

533
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:30,013
So, when can we
go to the theater?

534
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,582
Hold your horses now.

535
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,017
That movie doesn't
start for another hour.

536
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,753
Will there be cartoons first?

537
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:37,789
There usually are.

538
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,022
You boys are lucky,

539
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,358
you get to hear what
people are saying.

540
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,393
Do you remember it was
just a couple of years ago

541
00:31:43,395 --> 00:31:46,229
that you had to read the
words when people talked.

542
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:49,567
But it's hard when you're
first learning to read.

543
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:51,937
But it made you a
better reader, didn't it?

544
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,641
I suppose.

545
00:31:56,942 --> 00:31:58,743
Cole, why don't you tell us

546
00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:00,645
why tonight's movie
is more important

547
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:02,145
than some of the others.

548
00:32:02,147 --> 00:32:04,749
Well, it's on account that
it's about the fighter pilots.

549
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:07,518
The ones who fought in The
Great War, just like our daddy.

550
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,987
It's a memorial to all
the daddies that fought

551
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:13,760
and didn't come back,
just like your daddy.

552
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,993
Were they all fighter pilots?

553
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:18,228
Of course not, Joe.

554
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,564
Some of them fired cannons

555
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:22,132
and some of them rode
in those big old tanks.

556
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:24,868
But so many of them
were foot soldiers

557
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,739
that fought in those
terrible, terrible trenches.

558
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:30,441
I prayed and I prayed.

559
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:33,043
I prayed that there would
never be another war

560
00:32:33,045 --> 00:32:35,782
and that you boys would never
have to go away to fight.

561
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,450
Can we go to the
theater now, Ma?

562
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:42,221
All right, already,
let's go to the theater.

563
00:32:50,797 --> 00:32:52,630
[gentle music]

564
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:54,064
Now you tell me

565
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:56,301
that wasn't the most
amazing movie you ever saw.

566
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,771
Did you like it, Joseph?

567
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:01,672
I liked it but
I didn't get it.

568
00:33:01,674 --> 00:33:02,507
You didn't get it?

569
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:03,574
What did you not get?

570
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:05,144
Let him talk, Cole.

571
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:09,847
How come when the
pilots shot their guns

572
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:11,684
the propellers didn't break off.

573
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:14,317
It's all in the
mechanics, don't you see,

574
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,188
it's all about gears and stuff.

575
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:19,024
Oh, okay.

576
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,793
Do you know what I want
to be when I grow up, Cole?

577
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:22,894
What, Joe?

578
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:23,895
[Joe] A hero.

579
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:25,162
[Cole] What kind of hero?

580
00:33:25,164 --> 00:33:28,535
A cowboy marshal
from the Old West.

581
00:33:30,102 --> 00:33:32,269
[Cole] The Old West, huh?

582
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:34,239
I wanna have six guns blazing.

583
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:40,845
So, what do you want to
be when you grow up, Cole?

584
00:33:40,847 --> 00:33:42,312
Me?

585
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:43,548
[dramatic music]

586
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,383
I think a...

587
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:57,664
[plane engine roaring]

588
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:02,769
Ah, that's a B-38, help me
up, help me up. [groaning]

589
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:10,741
J-Bomber, 22, thank God.

590
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:13,176
It's still gonna be
tight for us though.

591
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:14,244
I'm gonna pop
one of them flares.

592
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:16,079
Okay, but wait til it's close.

593
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,280
Not too close.

594
00:34:17,282 --> 00:34:19,917
They have limited sight
distance underneath.

595
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,151
Got it.

596
00:34:21,153 --> 00:34:22,085
Joe, I'm gonna put
in some paperwork

597
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:23,053
with the CO when I get back.

598
00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:24,156
Get you a ticket home.

599
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:25,925
Okay.

600
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,794
Well, you too.

601
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:31,498
We're brothers,
we stick together.

602
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:36,803
Maybe I'll put in a
word for both of us.

603
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,971
I think that's a good idea.

604
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:42,640
So, why all the cloak
and dagger, Colonel.

605
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:44,140
You'll understand in a moment.

606
00:34:44,142 --> 00:34:46,209
But let me say as I've indicated

607
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,512
on the other
mission you went on,

608
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:49,114
this is strictly volunteer.

609
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,517
And this endeavor is top secret

610
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:55,488
and you'll understand why
when you take a look at that.

611
00:34:57,256 --> 00:35:00,190
Okay, it's a 109,
what about it, sir?

612
00:35:00,192 --> 00:35:02,495
That's what you're going
to fly to get this started.

613
00:35:10,302 --> 00:35:12,202
You've got to be
kidding me, sir.

614
00:35:12,204 --> 00:35:14,070
Of course we had to
patch her up a bit,

615
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:15,274
get her in flying shape.

616
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,808
Well, obviously.

617
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,510
But how the hell did
you come by this?

618
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:22,914
Well, this delightful
Nazi pilot landed it

619
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,815
in a field near here.

620
00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:27,453
I guess he had a little
case of self-preservation.

621
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:31,288
[throat clearing]

622
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,857
How's she fly?

623
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:34,124
We don't know.

624
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:36,627
No combat pilot's
taken her up yet.

625
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:38,297
Maybe you'd like
to be the first.

626
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:42,367
Wow, you get all
the spiffy toys.

627
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:47,707
[plane engine roaring]

628
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:56,179
Who's at the controls?

629
00:35:56,181 --> 00:35:57,915
My brother.

630
00:35:57,917 --> 00:35:59,884
Why doesn't that surprise me.

631
00:35:59,886 --> 00:36:02,753
Around here he's gonna
get shot out of the sky.

632
00:36:02,755 --> 00:36:04,154
Where are they sending him?

633
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:05,957
[Joe] I don't know,
he won't tell me.

634
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,159
But he's your brother.

635
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:09,292
That don't mean nothin'.

636
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,828
Joe's right,
Major Phillips isn't

637
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,297
gonna compromise his mission.

638
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:16,500
Hey, look, he's waving at us.

639
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:18,170
Everybody wave back.

640
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:23,373
Hey, Major.

641
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,211
Ah, Major Phillips, you're
gonna get your ass shot off.

642
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:31,684
[plane engine roaring]

643
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:40,524
What do you think?

644
00:36:40,526 --> 00:36:42,192
She handles real nice, sir.

645
00:36:42,194 --> 00:36:43,694
That's what I hear.

646
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:46,396
Oh, your brother here has
decided to stick around.

647
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:48,532
He's ready to go home but
he wants to wait around here

648
00:36:48,534 --> 00:36:49,902
til you finish the mission.

649
00:36:51,037 --> 00:36:52,672
I guess he can't
stand the suspense.

650
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:56,406
You're just
stickin' around here

651
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:58,542
til I get back
from this mission?

652
00:36:58,544 --> 00:37:00,210
You think that's a good idea?

653
00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:03,748
Knowing Mama, I think
she'd be a whole lot happier

654
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,617
if the both of us come walking
up that sidewalk of hers.

655
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:08,151
I can't argue with that.

656
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:10,755
But it may not be a
permanent ride home for me.

657
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:12,188
Are you serious?

658
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,424
We've still got a war to win.

659
00:37:14,426 --> 00:37:15,528
And it ain't over yet.

660
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,699
[wind howling]

661
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:24,535
Fraulein von Falenburg,
I have heard many

662
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:28,606
of your broadcasts, so I'm very
familiar with your persona.

663
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:31,575
However, I know very
little about you.

664
00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:33,044
How did you get
your start in radio.

665
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:36,212
I was an actress in
Berlin, a theater actress,

666
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:39,116
not one of those
degenerate cabaret girls.

667
00:37:39,118 --> 00:37:41,217
I had my own company.

668
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:43,988
We performed the great classics,

669
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,358
Goethe, Schiller and
of course, Shakespeare.

670
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:49,026
The English do not
appreciate him.

671
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:52,362
He has the true German spirit.

672
00:37:52,364 --> 00:37:55,533
Of course, I played
Portia and Gertrude.

673
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:57,804
But my favorite role
is Lady Macbeth.

674
00:37:59,472 --> 00:38:01,474
Out, out damn spot!

675
00:38:02,775 --> 00:38:03,976
Out, I say!

676
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:09,414
Gone tumor, and it
is time to do it.

677
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:11,383
Hell is murky.

678
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:14,452
Fie my lord, fie.

679
00:38:14,454 --> 00:38:16,122
A soldier and afeard.

680
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:22,327
But need you fear, no that
none can call out power to it.

681
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,697
Yet who would have thought
the old man would have

682
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:28,468
so much blood in him.

683
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:31,769
She's riveting,
I must meet her.

684
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:33,971
[Falenburg] Yes, the
smell of the blood.

685
00:38:33,973 --> 00:38:35,439
I will introduce
you after the show.

686
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:38,542
All the perfumes of
the lady will not sweeten

687
00:38:38,544 --> 00:38:39,979
this little hand.

688
00:38:41,413 --> 00:38:43,248
Ah, ah to bed, to bed.

689
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:49,252
There's knocking at the gate.

690
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:51,758
Come, come, give me your hand!

691
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:55,926
What's done cannot be undone.

692
00:38:55,928 --> 00:38:56,763
To bed.

693
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:04,635
[audience applauding]

694
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:07,640
[people chattering]

695
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:16,747
Do you know who this man
is at the second table?

696
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:18,949
That is one of the
leaders of the Reich.

697
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:23,120
That is Herr Joseph Goebbels,
Minister of Propaganda.

698
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:26,924
Ah, yes, I'm very
familiar with his work.

699
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:29,994
Her Goebbels would very
much like to speak with you.

700
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:30,830
Certainly.

701
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:38,604
My compliments,
Fraulein von Falenburg.

702
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:41,739
The British could
learn a lesson or two

703
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:44,177
from your marvelous
presentation of Shakespeare.

704
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:48,147
[people chattering]

705
00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:57,822
Shakespeare has the
true Aryan spirit.

706
00:39:57,824 --> 00:39:59,890
This the British no
longer understand.

707
00:39:59,892 --> 00:40:03,060
I understand that
most your repertoire is

708
00:40:03,062 --> 00:40:05,129
of German origin.

709
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:09,166
That is correct, following
the directive from your office.

710
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:13,070
Germany has produced the
finest literature in the world.

711
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:15,739
Your theater company
has done excellent work

712
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:18,110
at presenting our
glorious heritage.

713
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:23,781
But tell me, how long til
the end of your season?

714
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:25,316
A matter of weeks.

715
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:28,921
[Joseph] Splendid, I may
have something else for you.

716
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:31,354
An assignment?

717
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:35,360
Yes, an assignment
on a national platform.

718
00:40:36,762 --> 00:40:38,764
I would like to
know the details.

719
00:40:39,932 --> 00:40:43,734
Fraulein, have you
ever worked on a radio?

720
00:40:43,736 --> 00:40:45,002
Radio?

721
00:40:45,004 --> 00:40:46,470
Oh, no, I have not.

722
00:40:46,472 --> 00:40:48,906
But I am a very quick study.

723
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:50,676
You have a very
good voice for it.

724
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:54,712
My associate will
arrange an appointment

725
00:40:54,714 --> 00:40:59,283
in my office next week if
you have the time for it.

726
00:40:59,285 --> 00:41:01,619
I will make the time.

727
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:03,923
Things were very
difficult in the Republic.

728
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:08,292
Everyone was starving,
we could barely survive.

729
00:41:08,294 --> 00:41:11,631
The foreigners and the Jews
are corrupting our country.

730
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:15,466
And then Herr Hitler
came to power.

731
00:41:15,468 --> 00:41:19,703
Well there were jobs, and
the undesirables were gone.

732
00:41:19,705 --> 00:41:22,373
People could come to
the theater again.

733
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,010
They could even have cars.

734
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:28,245
Herr Goebbels wanted
only pure German art

735
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:30,648
for the glory of the party.

736
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,849
And so he asked me

737
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:35,519
to help improve the
quality of the culture.

738
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:37,988
And so I went on the radio.

739
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,390
To the benefit of all.

740
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:43,996
Thank you, Fraulein von
Falenburg, for your dedication.

741
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:49,235
Afternoon, the usual?

742
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:52,069
[Joe] Yes, ma'am.

743
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:53,470
Joe, what are you
still doing here.

744
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:55,839
I heard you got your
papers to go home.

745
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:59,877
Yeah, I just figured
I'd wait it out,

746
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:00,811
go home with my brother.

747
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:02,780
Well, isn't that sweet.

748
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:03,983
Wait for your brother.

749
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:05,985
[Men] Whoa!

750
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:09,722
[Colonel] You hear that,
she thinks you're sweet, Joe.

751
00:42:11,624 --> 00:42:12,890
Don't be startin'
them kind of rumors.

752
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:15,427
I got a beautiful wife
waiting on me at home.

753
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:17,227
What can I get
for ya, Colonel?

754
00:42:17,229 --> 00:42:18,564
[Colonel] Whisky, please.

755
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:25,736
This is Thuringia in Germany.

756
00:42:25,738 --> 00:42:27,705
Down here there's a hill,

757
00:42:27,707 --> 00:42:30,741
or you could call it a small
mountain if you prefer.

758
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:32,411
It's known as the Kohnstein.

759
00:42:33,546 --> 00:42:35,614
It's outside the
town of Nordhausen.

760
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:38,651
And it was at one
time a gypsum mine.

761
00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:44,521
These days it's an
underground assembly area

762
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:46,156
for the V-2 rockets.

763
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:47,658
I believe you've seen one.

764
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,126
Yes, sir, I have.

765
00:42:49,128 --> 00:42:51,362
As you know, these rockets
have been terrorizing

766
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:52,796
the people of England.

767
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:55,733
And that was certainly
Hitler's intention all along.

768
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:57,167
So as you can imagine,

769
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:59,403
this has been a high
priority target for the RAF.

770
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:01,372
But it's in a mountain.

771
00:43:01,374 --> 00:43:02,606
Right.

772
00:43:02,608 --> 00:43:05,443
We may be coming close
to ruling the skies

773
00:43:05,445 --> 00:43:07,177
but the Germans have
a pretty good grip

774
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:08,645
on the subterranean.

775
00:43:08,647 --> 00:43:11,782
So what can be tried that
hasn't been tried, sir?

776
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:13,419
Perhaps the 109 you flew.

777
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,320
Does it have the range?

778
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:19,056
Well as long as the tank
under the belly is full.

779
00:43:19,058 --> 00:43:21,558
Without it, you
won't make it back.

780
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,994
Yeah, if I make
it through the raid,

781
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:27,131
our own guys will be shooting
at me on the way back.

782
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:28,834
Mm, it's a bit
tricky, isn't it.

783
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:31,735
Yeah, just a bit.

784
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:33,037
What can a single 109 do

785
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,240
that the thousand
British bombers haven't?

786
00:43:36,242 --> 00:43:37,674
Good question.

787
00:43:37,676 --> 00:43:39,209
The only time these
rockets are vulnerable is

788
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:42,447
when they're being brought
out of the facility.

789
00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:45,049
They truck 'em out on their
own trailers to fuel them.

790
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:46,316
What's the fuel?

791
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:49,053
Liquified oxygen
and ethyl alcohol.

792
00:43:49,055 --> 00:43:50,890
Wow, science fiction, sir.

793
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:53,757
How do we know so much

794
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:55,592
about the inner
workings of this place?

795
00:43:55,594 --> 00:43:57,895
Well, we have
someone on the inside.

796
00:43:57,897 --> 00:44:01,799
So with the fuel tank I
won't have a belly bomb.

797
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:03,033
[Richards] Correct.

798
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:05,470
So what do I
have to shoot with?

799
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:07,704
The ship only
has two wing guns

800
00:44:07,706 --> 00:44:10,475
and unfortunately,
it arrived empty.

801
00:44:10,477 --> 00:44:11,742
What's the caliber, sir.

802
00:44:11,744 --> 00:44:14,411
13 millimeter, that's
close to our 50 caliber

803
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:16,182
but the rounds
won't cycle through.

804
00:44:17,183 --> 00:44:18,084
However.

805
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:20,352
Yes?

806
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:24,388
The 109 does have a
center lying cannon.

807
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,622
Cannon?

808
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:26,990
30 millimeter.

809
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:29,728
And it arrived
loaded, 65 rounds.

810
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:32,162
[laughs] Yes.

811
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:35,599
30 millimeter should be enough
to penetrate those tankers.

812
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:37,901
But they don't open
the doors very often.

813
00:44:37,903 --> 00:44:39,770
This man on the inside,
I'm gonna hope he knows

814
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:41,805
when those tunnel doors
are gonna be open, sir.

815
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:43,441
Yes, but never
at the same time.

816
00:44:43,443 --> 00:44:45,676
It changes, every day.

817
00:44:45,678 --> 00:44:48,078
So, I need your man
to get me a message

818
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,713
when those tunnel doors
are gonna be open.

819
00:44:49,715 --> 00:44:51,415
I'll see what I can do.

820
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:53,250
What should be
the message, sir.

821
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:56,454
It is, "The time has
come for all good men

822
00:44:56,456 --> 00:44:58,357
"to come to the aid
of their country."

823
00:45:06,332 --> 00:45:07,565
[Pilot] I heard
they're planning

824
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:09,099
on putting 1,000 planes
in the air next week.

825
00:45:09,101 --> 00:45:11,201
[whistles] 1,000,
that's crazy.

826
00:45:11,203 --> 00:45:13,070
[Pilot] I don't
think it's possible.

827
00:45:13,072 --> 00:45:14,972
Oh, it's possible,
the Brits did it

828
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:16,408
more than two years ago.

829
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:18,476
[Pilot] Night raid?

830
00:45:18,478 --> 00:45:19,910
That's right.

831
00:45:19,912 --> 00:45:20,978
Must have been fighters
and bombers together

832
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,246
to get that number.

833
00:45:22,248 --> 00:45:26,750
Oh, actually, it
was 1,046 bombers.

834
00:45:26,752 --> 00:45:28,654
Very few fighters
made that trip.

835
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:31,121
[Joe] What was the target?

836
00:45:31,123 --> 00:45:32,389
The target was Cologne.

837
00:45:32,391 --> 00:45:34,424
Cologne, but that's still a...

838
00:45:34,426 --> 00:45:36,494
Still a target, yes.

839
00:45:36,496 --> 00:45:39,229
Higher ups in the RAF thought
they could shock the Germans

840
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:41,932
into surrendering once
they felt the mighty fist

841
00:45:41,934 --> 00:45:45,470
of 1,000 war birds
strike at the same time.

842
00:45:45,472 --> 00:45:47,037
[Pilot] How many
bombers did they lose?

843
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,974
4%, acceptable
losses at the time.

844
00:45:50,976 --> 00:45:53,444
But the losses got
worse after that.

845
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:55,112
Especially when we beefed up

846
00:45:55,114 --> 00:45:57,450
our daytime operations
early last year.

847
00:45:58,585 --> 00:46:00,217
Was there a major
military target

848
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,919
in Cologne that was
worth that kind of raid?

849
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:04,688
Plenty of military
sites across the city.

850
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,892
The primary target
was the city center.

851
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:11,397
First wave went in with
fire bombs, incendiaries.

852
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:16,101
Created a fire so damn big you
could see it for 100 miles.

853
00:46:17,403 --> 00:46:20,704
Fire also created a
very easy to find target

854
00:46:20,706 --> 00:46:22,239
for the rest of the bombers.

855
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:23,707
This was two years ago?

856
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:26,843
Yes, and after that,
the Germans beefed up

857
00:46:26,845 --> 00:46:28,814
their anti-aircraft defenses.

858
00:46:29,982 --> 00:46:31,348
These rockets you
see dropping out

859
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,152
of the sky over London now?

860
00:46:34,186 --> 00:46:36,186
Damn Germans claim it's payback

861
00:46:36,188 --> 00:46:37,823
for us torching their cities.

862
00:46:39,693 --> 00:46:42,092
Didn't they do that to
the Brits first back in '40?

863
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:46,698
Yes, Joe, that's right and
don't any of you forget that.

864
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,798
You understand?

865
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,734
Yes, sir.

866
00:46:50,236 --> 00:46:53,473
[plane engine roaring]

867
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,405
[dramatic music]

868
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,011
[Cole sighs]

869
00:48:07,813 --> 00:48:10,382
[wind howling]

870
00:48:18,692 --> 00:48:21,693
So where is everybody?

871
00:48:21,695 --> 00:48:25,763
Downstairs eating
with von Falenburg.

872
00:48:25,765 --> 00:48:27,966
[Issac] I have noticed
increased activity.

873
00:48:30,503 --> 00:48:33,070
Are you prepared to send
a message today, Issac?

874
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:33,906
[Issac] I am.

875
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,939
And do you
remember the message?

876
00:48:35,941 --> 00:48:36,776
[Issac] I do.

877
00:48:40,547 --> 00:48:43,349
The tunnel must be open in
order to move the rockets out.

878
00:48:44,517 --> 00:48:46,551
When the tunnel is open,
you will see daylight

879
00:48:46,553 --> 00:48:48,253
in the far corner
of the facility.

880
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:50,623
This is very important.

881
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,758
You must sent the message

882
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,729
when the rockets
are in the tunnel.

883
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:58,665
You must sent it at
that precise time.

884
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:02,065
Very well, Captain,
I shall do this,

885
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,003
though I feel it will
not end very well for me.

886
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:07,871
I am leaving, Issac.

887
00:49:07,873 --> 00:49:10,376
I will leave a pistol
with the radio equipment.

888
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:14,679
Von Falenburg will
likely not return

889
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:16,315
to her office
until this evening.

890
00:49:17,883 --> 00:49:19,883
Once you have sent the message,

891
00:49:19,885 --> 00:49:22,121
lock yourself in your
office as best you can.

892
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:25,592
Thank you, Captain.

893
00:49:31,564 --> 00:49:33,731
[Joe] Mind if I join
you for a little bit, sir?

894
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:35,500
Of course not, but you know

895
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:38,137
I can't discuss classified
information with you.

896
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:41,104
I understand that, sir.

897
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:43,008
I'm just worried about Cole.

898
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,513
I'm afraid he might be in over
his head on this one, sir.

899
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:50,082
He is an interesting
breed, your brother, Joe.

900
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:53,252
Seems to thrive on the risk.

901
00:49:54,654 --> 00:49:57,688
That he is, but I think
he's just truly doing

902
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,526
what he can do to
get home safe, sir.

903
00:50:01,226 --> 00:50:03,026
That is a good attitude.

904
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:07,097
But sometimes, Joe,
I think you may be

905
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:09,500
mostly just along for the ride.

906
00:50:09,502 --> 00:50:13,238
[laughs] Yeah, it is
a hell of a ride, sir.

907
00:50:14,373 --> 00:50:15,606
Colonel, sir!

908
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:17,073
[Richards] Yes, Lieutenant.

909
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:18,308
How come Major Phillips gets

910
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,043
all these secret
service missions.

911
00:50:20,045 --> 00:50:21,278
Because the Major knows how

912
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,715
to handle himself in
precarious situations.

913
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:27,785
He gets them on account of
he usually don't come back hit.

914
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:28,653
Yeah, okay.

915
00:50:28,655 --> 00:50:30,355
That is a bonus.

916
00:50:31,825 --> 00:50:33,558
It's back to work, fellas.

917
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,792
I'll report back to you

918
00:50:34,794 --> 00:50:36,427
when I've got more
information for you.

919
00:50:36,429 --> 00:50:37,394
[Pilot] Yes, sir.

920
00:50:37,396 --> 00:50:40,030
Yes, sir, please do.

921
00:50:40,032 --> 00:50:43,235
[plane engine roaring]

[engines puttering]

929
00:53:01,106 --> 00:53:06,111
Now is the time
for all good men

930
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,683
to come to the aid
of their country.

931
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:15,153
Now is the time for all good men

932
00:53:18,758 --> 00:53:21,761
to come to the aid
of their country.

933
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:27,999
That's it, that's it.

934
00:53:28,001 --> 00:53:33,006
[plane engine roaring]
[suspenseful music]

935
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:35,367
It was Issac.

[plane engine roaring]

937
00:54:39,072 --> 00:54:41,140
Okay, 30 millimeter.

938
00:54:42,942 --> 00:54:44,642
Don't let me down.

[guns firing]

941
00:55:05,765 --> 00:55:08,833
Close the door
to the tunnel, now!

942

[guns firing]

943
00:55:13,338 --> 00:55:15,573
Did you hear that Captain?

944
00:55:15,575 --> 00:55:17,273
Of course I heard it.

945
00:55:17,275 --> 00:55:19,043
Where is the Jew?

946
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:20,012
He's disappeared.

947
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:25,250
You told him to
do that broadcast.

948
00:55:27,285 --> 00:55:29,421
I don't know what
you are talking about.

949
00:55:33,459 --> 00:55:36,427
You will not shoot
an unarmed lady.

950
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:37,830
I don't see a lady.

951
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:49,876
[plane engine roaring]

952
00:55:55,615 --> 00:55:57,250
20, I think I can.

953

00:56:23,209 --> 00:56:24,043
Maybe 40?

Close the door

[plane engine roaring]

963
00:57:09,622 --> 00:57:11,288
Give me some lovin'.

[phone ringing]

970
00:58:12,118 --> 00:58:13,217
Hello?

971
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:14,885
Hello, Malcolm.

972
00:58:14,887 --> 00:58:16,987
Hello, Rob, it's good
to hear your voice.

973
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:20,593
Malcolm, I have some good
news, some very good news.

974
00:58:22,728 --> 00:58:24,461
Malcolm, Malcolm are you there?

975
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:26,365
Yes, yes, Rob,
please continue.

976
00:58:27,566 --> 00:58:30,803
The Kohnstein plant,
it has been destroyed.

977
00:58:33,873 --> 00:58:34,707
Malcolm?

978
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:39,043
100%?

979
00:58:39,045 --> 00:58:41,779
Yes, 100%.

980
00:58:41,781 --> 00:58:44,748
Our plan worked
just like a charm.

981
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,284
Very good, Rob, you
must make your way here

982
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:48,118
and give me the details.

983
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,221
Heading your way.

984
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:53,223
[phone clicking]

985
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:55,828
[somber music]

986
00:59:20,786 --> 00:59:23,220
[Richards] As Major Cole
Phillips headed back west

987
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:25,923
after torching the
Kohnstein, the adrenaline

988
00:59:25,925 --> 00:59:27,157
that had rushed through him

989
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:29,893
during the raid
began to subside.

990
00:59:29,895 --> 00:59:32,596
He had executed his
mission with precision

991
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:36,000
and bravery and no
small amount of luck.

992
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:38,602
He had prevented the
swarm of chaos and death

993
00:59:38,604 --> 00:59:40,571
that the V-2 rockets
would have caused

994
00:59:40,573 --> 00:59:42,339
if they had reached
their targets

995
00:59:42,341 --> 00:59:45,242
in London and the
surrounding areas.

996
00:59:45,244 --> 00:59:47,011
Armed with a single
enemy fighter

997
00:59:47,013 --> 00:59:50,381
and one vital piece of
intelligence information,

998
00:59:50,383 --> 00:59:54,651
he was able to do what 1,000
Allied were unable to do

999
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:59,556
over the course of dozens of
bombing raids on the Kohnstein.

1000
00:59:59,558 --> 01:00:02,226
Now, flying in the
cloak of darkness,

1001
01:00:02,228 --> 01:00:03,761
and at low altitude to try

1002
01:00:03,763 --> 01:00:06,730
to avoid other aircraft
from either side,

1003
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:09,666
Cole saw a landscape
that had been decimated

1004
01:00:09,668 --> 01:00:13,339
by the conflict that he and
his brother been part of.

1005
01:00:14,474 --> 01:00:17,808
As a pilot of a B-17,
all of his raids,

1006
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,513
except one of course, were
at very high altitudes.

1007
01:00:21,515 --> 01:00:23,981
Putting a physical and
psychological distance

1008
01:00:23,983 --> 01:00:25,885
between him and his targets.

1009
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:30,854
The destruction in the German
cities was nearly complete.

1010
01:00:30,856 --> 01:00:33,424
But he knew the
destruction would continue

1011
01:00:33,426 --> 01:00:35,061
until the job was finished.

1012
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:41,901
You okay, Joe?

1013
01:00:44,538 --> 01:00:45,969
Yeah, just kind of thought

1014
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:47,773
we'd have heard something
by now, you know?

1015
01:00:50,142 --> 01:00:51,445
We will, soon.

1016
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:55,145
Hope so.

1017
01:00:55,147 --> 01:00:58,582
[wind howling]

1018
01:00:58,584 --> 01:01:01,488
[suspenseful music]

1019
01:01:08,994 --> 01:01:11,929
[Richards] The further west
Cole got the colder it became

1020
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:15,232
in the cockpit of the
ME-109 he was flying.

1021
01:01:15,234 --> 01:01:17,234
The clouds came
in, and he realized

1022
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:20,037
he was being accompanied
by a winter storm.

1023
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:22,476
Well, it was January after all.

1024
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:25,943
The crews back at the base

1025
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:27,744
in England has done
a fine job getting

1026
01:01:27,746 --> 01:01:30,848
the crashed 109 airworthy
and battle ready.

1027
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,749
But they didn't
quite have the time

1028
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:35,152
and the parts they
needed for everything

1029
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:38,257
and the cockpit heaters
didn't have first priority.

1030
01:01:39,692 --> 01:01:42,793
I know this for a fact,
I'm Colonel Richards,

1031
01:01:42,795 --> 01:01:45,599
Bomber Squadron Commander,
U.S. Army Air Corps.

1032
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:49,434
So at this point, the fact
that he was not traveling

1033
01:01:49,436 --> 01:01:52,402
at those bitterly cold,
high altitudes was

1034
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:54,273
probably saving Cole's life.

1035
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:58,110
[wind howling]

1036
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:10,055
[plane engine roaring]
[upbeat music]

1037
01:03:09,114 --> 01:03:12,117
[people chattering]

1038
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,420
Thank you, Margie.

1039
01:03:16,055 --> 01:03:17,622
All right, gentlemen, listen up.

1040
01:03:17,624 --> 01:03:21,124
The mission that Major
Phillips went on is classified.

1041
01:03:21,126 --> 01:03:23,160
So I can't talk about it.

1042
01:03:23,162 --> 01:03:28,031
But what I can tell you is that
there's been several reports

1043
01:03:28,033 --> 01:03:31,768
of a radio transmission
coming from a single aircraft

1044
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:36,008
that's traveling west, over
the Channel towards us.

1045
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:40,777
Now that radio transmission
has been heard many times

1046
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:42,314
by a number of sources.

1047
01:03:43,717 --> 01:03:47,219
And the contents of that
transmission are as follows.

1048
01:03:49,522 --> 01:03:51,421
"I am an American pilot,

1049
01:03:51,423 --> 01:03:54,860
"flying west in a
captured German 109.

1050
01:03:55,761 --> 01:03:57,662
"I am unarmed.

1051
01:03:57,664 --> 01:04:00,330
"Please don't shoot me down."

1052
01:04:00,332 --> 01:04:02,032
[men laughing]

1053
01:04:02,034 --> 01:04:03,601
All right, at ease now.

1054
01:04:03,603 --> 01:04:06,370
The last word is there's
a patrol of Spitfires

1055
01:04:06,372 --> 01:04:08,606
that have located this aircraft.

1056
01:04:08,608 --> 01:04:11,008
And these Spitfires,
I'm happy to say,

1057
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:15,480
are now accompanying
the 109 back here to us.

1058
01:04:15,482 --> 01:04:16,813
What do you think, huh?

1059
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:20,217
[glasses clinking]

1060
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:23,789
We're going home,
Cole, we're going home.

1061
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:32,565
[plane engines roaring]
[gentle upbeat music]

1062
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:50,249
[Cole laughing]

1063
01:05:12,439 --> 01:05:15,374
[triumphant music]

1064
01:05:26,653 --> 01:05:29,386
[Joe] Hey, I missed you.

1065
01:05:29,388 --> 01:05:30,420
It's good to see you.

1066
01:05:30,422 --> 01:05:32,592
Hey, I missed you so much.

1067
01:05:40,165 --> 01:05:43,266
Mommy said that you had to
jump out of your airplane.

1068
01:05:43,268 --> 01:05:46,136
Hey, hold on, honey, let me
tell you how that happened.

1069
01:05:46,138 --> 01:05:48,205
Now your uncle was
flying the plane,

1070
01:05:48,207 --> 01:05:50,107
and I had to bank
right real hard,

1071
01:05:50,109 --> 01:05:51,875
we had these Krauts
coming in behind us

1072
01:05:51,877 --> 01:05:53,511
with these jet engines,
and he fell right out

1073
01:05:53,513 --> 01:05:56,246
of the side of the plane
where he was a waste gunner.

1074
01:05:56,248 --> 01:05:57,548
Couldn't go back
and get him, though,

1075
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:00,818
so we had to let him
use his parachute.

1076
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,188
That is not the way
it happened at all.

1077
01:06:04,356 --> 01:06:06,491
Don't listen to a
thing your uncle says.

1078
01:06:06,493 --> 01:06:08,125
I agree with Maggie.

1079
01:06:08,127 --> 01:06:11,094
All right, soldiers, put
your napkins in your laps.

1080
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:14,499
This meal has been blessed,
let's help ourselves.

1081
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:15,635
All right, dig in.

1082
01:06:16,536 --> 01:06:19,138
[gentle music]

1083
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,582
What are you
doing alone in here?

1084
01:06:31,584 --> 01:06:32,852
Everybody's still eating.

1085
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:35,218
You hung up the picture.

1086
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,053
Weren't sure you
were gonna like it.

1087
01:06:37,055 --> 01:06:38,556
What's not to like?

1088
01:06:38,558 --> 01:06:40,991
Apparently now I'm just
a piece of hardware.

1089
01:06:40,993 --> 01:06:43,663
[Cole laughing]

1090
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,031
How'd you do it, Cole?

1091
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:48,400
[Cole] How'd I do what, Mom?

1092
01:06:49,636 --> 01:06:52,068
Joe was behind
enemy lines, right?

1093
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,104
How'd you get him back?

1094
01:06:54,106 --> 01:06:55,440
That wasn't me, Ma.

1095
01:06:55,442 --> 01:06:57,307
That was all Joe, well,

1096
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:59,278
with a little help
from the Resistance.

1097
01:07:00,647 --> 01:07:01,714
Oh my word.

1098
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:06,251
[laughs] He can be
a tough character, Ma.

1099
01:07:07,953 --> 01:07:10,189
[Ma sighs]

1100
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:13,023
What's for dessert?

1101
01:07:13,025 --> 01:07:14,894
Pound cake, your
favorite, come on.

1102
01:07:23,803 --> 01:07:25,570
Mm, I'll take a
little more gravy.

1103
01:07:25,572 --> 01:07:28,473
It's been a long time since
I've had your gravy, Ma.

1104
01:07:28,475 --> 01:07:30,441
[Joe] It sure beats what
they make in the mess hall.

1105
01:07:30,443 --> 01:07:32,209
I'll pass it to you.

1106
01:07:32,211 --> 01:07:33,478
[Cole] Oh, I don't know.

1107
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,013
Yeah, the officer's
mess was pretty good.

1108
01:07:36,415 --> 01:07:40,183
Well, they did at least
feed you all something, right?

1109
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:42,988
[Cole] Oh, they did, plenty
of it too, whatever it was.

1110
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:46,924
[Joe] Yeah, might
get enough of this.

1111
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:48,495
I've been waiting, oh my.

1112
01:07:52,866 --> 01:07:54,097
Oh, I missed this.

1113
01:07:54,099 --> 01:07:55,833
It's so good to
have you boys home.

1114
01:07:55,835 --> 01:07:56,970
It's good be home.

1115
01:07:58,738 --> 01:08:00,270
I sure missed you guys.

1116
01:08:00,272 --> 01:08:02,305
And we definitely missed you.

1117
01:08:02,307 --> 01:08:03,208
I know she did.

1118
01:08:04,644 --> 01:08:06,409
[Joe] It's gonna be good
to sleep in my own bed.

1119
01:08:06,411 --> 01:08:07,478
[all laughing]

1120
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,313
Yeah.

1121
01:08:14,888 --> 01:08:17,855
Well, Malcolm, Major Phillips
and his brother are back

1122
01:08:17,857 --> 01:08:19,557
with the family in the States.

1123
01:08:19,559 --> 01:08:21,459
That is wonderful news.

1124
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:25,395
However, I would have liked
to have met the Major.

1125
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:27,532
He did an extraordinary job.

1126
01:08:27,534 --> 01:08:28,599
He sure did.

1127
01:08:28,601 --> 01:08:30,233
And he told me if we needed him

1128
01:08:30,235 --> 01:08:32,670
to come back to finish
it, he would do so.

1129
01:08:32,672 --> 01:08:35,008
We all hope that
won't be necessary.

1130
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:38,009
Malcolm, I want to
tell you something.

1131
01:08:38,011 --> 01:08:41,311
This Nazi push into
Belgium last month,

1132
01:08:41,313 --> 01:08:43,714
it's really got me concerned.

1133
01:08:43,716 --> 01:08:45,348
In what way?

1134
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:47,618
I'm wondering what else
they have up their sleeve.

1135
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,286
I'm concerned they're gonna drag

1136
01:08:49,288 --> 01:08:52,523
this conflict on as
long as possible.

1137
01:08:52,525 --> 01:08:53,960
That is a concern.

1138
01:08:55,327 --> 01:08:58,496
A prolonged endeavor
would allow them more time

1139
01:08:58,498 --> 01:09:03,266
to further develop these
technological terrors

1140
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:04,971
that we've all
been hearing about.

1141
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:08,071
I really wish I knew exactly

1142
01:09:08,073 --> 01:09:10,075
what was going on
in the Kohnstein.

1143
01:09:11,444 --> 01:09:12,710
[Malcolm laughs]

1144
01:09:12,712 --> 01:09:15,078
Malcolm, what are
you smiling about?

1145
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,582
Colonel, the reason I've
called this meeting is

1146
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:19,719
today I can help
you with that wish.

1147
01:09:20,587 --> 01:09:22,019
Tell me.

1148
01:09:22,021 --> 01:09:25,723
You will remember that
I've had a man on the inside.

1149
01:09:25,725 --> 01:09:27,157
Yes, yes, but...

1150
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:29,026
He made it back
to London yesterday

1151
01:09:29,028 --> 01:09:32,329
and I thought that a
meeting between you and me

1152
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:36,469
and this man should be carried
out as soon as possible.

1153
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:39,539
[Rob] Of course,
where do we need to go?

1154
01:09:40,907 --> 01:09:43,843
Andrew, you may come
in and have a seat.

1155
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,382
[Andrew] Colonel Thompson,
I've heard so much about you.

1156
01:09:54,821 --> 01:09:57,588
Certainly pleased
to meet you, mister?

1157
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:01,324
Andrew, just Andrew.

1158
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:05,496
I prefer to use my first name
only, I'm sure you understand.

1159
01:10:05,498 --> 01:10:06,731
Of course.

1160
01:10:06,733 --> 01:10:10,001
So you just came here
from the Kohnstein?

1161
01:10:10,003 --> 01:10:12,603
I've been back and
forth over enemy lines

1162
01:10:12,605 --> 01:10:14,073
several times during the war.

1163
01:10:15,207 --> 01:10:17,374
I was at the Kohnstein
up until the point

1164
01:10:17,376 --> 01:10:21,746
where your Major Phillips
executed his mission.

1165
01:10:21,748 --> 01:10:25,116
Right, so correct
me if I'm wrong.

1166
01:10:25,118 --> 01:10:27,051
Are you an American?

1167
01:10:27,053 --> 01:10:28,054
[Andrew] Yes, sir.

1168
01:10:29,321 --> 01:10:31,388
Not U.S. Army.

1169
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,791
No, sir, I was
working in London

1170
01:10:33,793 --> 01:10:37,360
in 1940 as a German translator.

1171
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:39,897
Mr. Wilkinson's office
put out the word

1172
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:41,465
that there was a great need

1173
01:10:41,467 --> 01:10:43,901
for people who
spoke fluent German.

1174
01:10:43,903 --> 01:10:45,970
I was happy to assist.

1175
01:10:45,972 --> 01:10:49,573
Back at the Kohnstein,
who did they think you were?

1176
01:10:49,575 --> 01:10:51,742
[laughs] A captain in the S.S.

1177
01:10:51,744 --> 01:10:53,209
Really?

1178
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:55,347
Well, you are a man
of many talents.

1179
01:10:56,415 --> 01:10:58,716
Did anybody else survive?

1180
01:10:58,718 --> 01:11:00,453
What about this Colonel Raiden?

1181
01:11:01,754 --> 01:11:04,287
Ah, Colonel Raiden, the man

1182
01:11:04,289 --> 01:11:07,223
in charge of the ME-262 program.

1183
01:11:07,225 --> 01:11:09,627
He was not there that day.

1184
01:11:09,629 --> 01:11:11,194
Rumor has it he was meeting

1185
01:11:11,196 --> 01:11:13,864
with von Braun about
a new aircraft.

1186
01:11:13,866 --> 01:11:17,704
Warner von Braun, the chief
architect of the V-2 rocket?

1187
01:11:18,604 --> 01:11:20,037
Correct.

1188
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:22,238
He would stop by occasionally
to check on the progress

1189
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,544
of the V-3 which was to
be a much larger rocket.

1190
01:11:26,546 --> 01:11:30,848
V-3, I thought they
were calling it the V-9.

1191
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:33,052
It was called many
things over time.

1192
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:38,756
Von Braun's chief
propulsion engineer was

1193
01:11:38,758 --> 01:11:41,426
a Jewish man named,
Issac Abromowicz.

1194
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:46,329
He and von Braun went to
college together in Berlin.

1195
01:11:46,331 --> 01:11:50,434
A Jew, a Jew
engineering Nazi rockets?

1196
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:53,037
He and his family were slaves.

1197
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:56,709
At my request, Issac sabotaged
the plans for the V-3.

1198
01:11:57,710 --> 01:11:59,777
He was with us.

1199
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:01,045
Well, is there any chance

1200
01:12:01,047 --> 01:12:03,614
that the Nazis can
restart the plan?

1201
01:12:03,616 --> 01:12:06,786
The mission was a success,
the damage was extreme,

1202
01:12:07,987 --> 01:12:11,589
there is no longer any
manufacturing capacity

1203
01:12:11,591 --> 01:12:12,658
at the Kohnstein.

1204
01:12:14,127 --> 01:12:16,259
I just hope Issac made
it out of there alive.

1205
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:18,231
Do you know if
anyone else survived?

1206
01:12:19,599 --> 01:12:23,836
The highest ranking officer
was a General Stahkmann.

1207
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:26,771
He was there during the attack

1208
01:12:26,773 --> 01:12:29,240
but I'm not sure
what happened to him.

1209
01:12:29,242 --> 01:12:32,576
Same goes for Fraulein
von Falenburg.

1210
01:12:32,578 --> 01:12:33,844
Who?

1211
01:12:33,846 --> 01:12:35,846
You might know her
as the Dresden Doll.

1212
01:12:35,848 --> 01:12:39,083
Yeah, our crews talk
quite a bit about her.

1213
01:12:39,085 --> 01:12:42,488
She was the voice of the
Nazi propaganda machine.

1214
01:12:43,589 --> 01:12:45,421
Was she stationed there?

1215
01:12:45,423 --> 01:12:47,727
She arrived from Berlin
several months ago.

1216
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:56,033
What are your
thoughts, Colonel?

1217
01:12:56,035 --> 01:12:59,003
Andrew, on any
of your missions,

1218
01:12:59,005 --> 01:13:02,340
have you ever had to
terminate somebody?

1219
01:13:03,676 --> 01:13:06,813
[sighs] That was never
the primary purpose

1220
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,213
of my assignments.

1221
01:13:09,215 --> 01:13:13,651
However, during the course of
completing those assignments,

1222
01:13:13,653 --> 01:13:14,954
such things have happened.

1223
01:13:16,354 --> 01:13:21,025
Malcolm, in regard to
our combined opportunities,

1224
01:13:21,027 --> 01:13:23,062
I see three priorities.

1225
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:27,031
And I'll list these
priorities in ascending order.

1226
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:30,434
One priority is this
Luftwaffe Colonel Raiden

1227
01:13:30,436 --> 01:13:32,972
and these new jets that
they call the Comet.

1228
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,308
Another priority is
Warner von Braun.

1229
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:39,844
The Russians are
looking for von Braun.

1230
01:13:39,846 --> 01:13:41,445
We all know that.

1231
01:13:41,447 --> 01:13:43,514
What's the third priority?

1232
01:13:43,516 --> 01:13:46,185
Why, Adolf Hitler himself.

1233
01:13:47,987 --> 01:13:49,655
What are your
thoughts, Andrew?

1234
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:53,125
In regards to termination?

1235
01:13:54,293 --> 01:13:56,994
I would agree that
possibly Colonel Raiden,

1236
01:13:56,996 --> 01:13:59,463
definitely Hitler as targets.

1237
01:13:59,465 --> 01:14:01,364
However, with von Braun,

1238
01:14:01,366 --> 01:14:05,436
I think we should consider
acquisition over termination.

1239
01:14:05,438 --> 01:14:06,670
Why so?

1240
01:14:06,672 --> 01:14:09,240
What makes von Braun
a valuable target

1241
01:14:09,242 --> 01:14:12,209
and potentially
incredibly dangerous is

1242
01:14:12,211 --> 01:14:15,047
not the man himself
but his work.

1243
01:14:16,682 --> 01:14:19,116
His advances in rocket
technologies could,

1244
01:14:19,118 --> 01:14:23,055
in the hands of the wrong
governments, be catastrophic.

1245
01:14:24,123 --> 01:14:25,990
Regardless, regardless
of what happens

1246
01:14:25,992 --> 01:14:27,825
with Germany at this point.

1247
01:14:27,827 --> 01:14:32,331
So, Andrew, are you up
for another assignment?

1248
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,332
I'm not busy next month.

1249
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:37,067
I'm at your disposal, Marshall.

1250
01:14:37,069 --> 01:14:40,304
Of the three
assignments outlined,

1251
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:44,277
which do you believe is best
suited towards your talents?

1252
01:14:45,444 --> 01:14:47,311
Let me see what I
can do with Raiden

1253
01:14:47,313 --> 01:14:51,315
and von Braun first. [laughs]

1254
01:14:51,317 --> 01:14:54,387
And then I'll see what I
can do about Herr Hitler.

1255
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:57,021
[sirens wailing]

1256
01:14:57,023 --> 01:14:58,457
Oh, here we go again.

1257
01:15:01,743 --> 01:15:04,337
Well, gentlemen, let's
head towards the basement.

1258
01:15:04,651 --> 01:15:06,885
About 10,000 V2 rockets
were fired at England.

1259
01:15:06,947 --> 01:15:09,440
2,419 of them reached London,
killing 6,184 and injuring 17,981 people.

1260
01:15:09,502 --> 01:15:12,071
[somber music]

1261
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:18,611
[dramatic music]

1262
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,803
[gentle music]
