1
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,057
OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Dispatch, this is unit 48.

2
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:26,160
We are investigating
a possible 261.

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,462
Location is approximately
three blocks south

4
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,863
Of Wilshire on Carrillo.

5
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:30,864
Over.

6
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:31,899
DISPATCHER (ON
RADIO): Copy that, 48.

7
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:33,167
Do you have a positive ID?

8
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,435
Over.

9
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,736
OFFICER (ON RADIO): Dispatch,
that is an affirmative

10
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,138
On the identification.

11
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,907
Repeat, we have a positive ID.

12
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,309
The victim looks
to be Tina Mason.

13
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,643
DISPATCHER (ON RADIO):
Oh, 48, could you

14
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,478
Repeat again the victim's ID?

15
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:45,513
Did you say Tina Mason?

16
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:46,580
Over.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,915
OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Copy that, dispatch.

18
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:48,982
No bullshit.

19
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,119
Looks to be Jack Mason's
little girl, Tina.

20
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,087
DISPATCHER (ON
RADIO): Thank you, 48.

21
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:53,921
Jesus Christ.

22
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,289
OFFICER (ON RADIO): Roger that.

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,192
The victim's body appears to
have been sexually assaulted.

24
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,361
The DC has indicated
that the cause of death

25
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,063
May be due to stab wounds
on the lower abdomen.

26
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,699
Shit, has someone told
Jack yet or Jennifer?

27
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,834
Over.

28
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:07,968
DISPATCHER (ON RADIO):
Uh, that's a yes, 48.

29
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,370
Both Detectives
Jack and Jennifer

30
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,904
Mason have been notified.

31
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:11,972
Over.

32
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,107
OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Copy that, dispatch.

33
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,675
We have no suspects
at this time.

34
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,711
We're releasing the body
to the medical examiner.

35
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,347
Man, sometimes I hate this job.

36
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:20,348
Over.

37
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,116
DISPATCHER (ON
RADIO): Roger, 48.

38
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,517
I couldn't agree more.

39
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,318
Over.

40
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,566
JACK: Thou shalt not kill.

41
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:42,136
Generally, a pretty
good rule to live by.

42
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:45,739
But last year, my daughter
was raped and murdered.

43
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,309
We never found the
guy who did it.

44
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,179
Thou shalt not kill.

45
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:54,915
Today, I believe there are
exceptions to that rule.

46
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:58,586
Today, I believe there are
some things worse than death.

47
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:01,054
Not knowing is one of them.

48
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,790
Not knowing how
afraid she must've

49
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,795
Been, not knowing
who killed her.

50
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,164
Yes, there are some
things worse than death.

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,569
Oh, fuck me.

52
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,037
Oh.

53
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:50,838
Oh.

54
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:51,772
Oh, yeah.

55
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,006
Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,141
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:54,942
Fuck me.

58
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:55,809
Oh, yeah.

59
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:56,744
Oh.
Oh, yeah.

60
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:57,545
Fuck me.

61
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:58,479
Come on.

62
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,913
Oh, baby, yeah.

63
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:00,981
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

64
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,250
There's someone here.
Oh.

65
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,584
What the fuck are you doing?

66
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,386
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

67
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:06,620
- Fuck you.
- No, thanks.

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,555
I'm working.

69
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:08,456
Hey, man.
Fuck off.

70
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,290
Shut up.

71
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,558
I'll only say it once, Manuelo.

72
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,661
Toss me the shit and tell
me the name of your boss.

73
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,662
Are you a fucking cop?

74
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:15,863
No, I'm from the
"Love Connection."

75
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,331
I want to know how your
dream date is going.

76
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,199
Now toss me the shit
and start talking.

77
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,167
Watch yourself, dick face.

78
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,635
Fuck you, man.

79
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:31,512
Fuck who?

80
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,814
Hey, I'm not
fucking joking, man.

81
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,516
Would you excuse us, please?

82
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:36,317
Now.

83
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:41,989
Fuck.

84
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,828
Fuck who, huh?

85
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:48,829
Fuck who?

86
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:49,763
Alfredo Marquez.

87
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,399
That's who you want.

88
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,701
Alfredo Marquez.

89
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:54,835
Afraid it was that cocksucker.

90
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,604
You'll live.

91
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,506
Sign, please.

92
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,907
What's that?

93
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,609
It's your signed testimony
that Alfredo Marquez

94
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,611
Is your shit distributor.

95
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,779
I'll see that you get a copy,
along with your attorney.

96
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,948
Sign it.
Sign it!

97
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,788
So who was the girl, huh?

98
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:15,589
Who's the girl?

99
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,590
Marquez sent her.

100
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,893
She gives me the stuff.

101
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,595
And the free fuck is
a fringe benefit, huh?

102
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,433
You're a bad guy, Manuelo.

103
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:26,700
You know that?

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,036
A bad fucking guy.

105
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,971
You're a drug pusher,
and you're a rapist.

106
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:31,772
Yeah.

107
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,040
I know, a rapist.

108
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,675
A little girl, last
year, seven years old.

109
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,476
She died.

110
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,677
They let you off.

111
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,779
Circumstantial evidence,
they called it,

112
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,980
A fucking technicality.

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,781
It's a neat term.

114
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,850
I hate that fucking term.

115
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,951
Sometimes I take the shit.

116
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:44,752
I go nuts.

117
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,654
I didn't mean to hurt her.

118
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,790
Are you gonna make
me sign for that too?

119
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,592
Suppose I don't.

120
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,794
Would you testify in a court?

121
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:54,728
Shit.

122
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:55,696
No fucking way.

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,270
What's the term you're
fucked mean to you?

124
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,605
Coming from a
rat turd like you?

125
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,406
Tell me.

126
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,011
Fuck.

127
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:17,985
Get him, you fucking asshole.

128
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:18,986
You want me to sign something?

129
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:27,428
Fucker.

130
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:32,900
Get his ass.

131
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,811
Kill him.

132
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,813
You are dead, motherfucker.

133
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,284
I got your ass.

134
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,256
Kill him.

136
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:11,872
Kill him!

138
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,467
Come here.

139
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,368
You are dead, motherfucker.

140
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:42,470
Now.

142
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,440
No!

[Gun clicking]

144
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:52,946
You missed.

146
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,958
No!

147
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,661
You lose, fuck face.

148
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,497
No!

00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,632
[Gunshot]

150
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,075
Hey, Milton.

151
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,700
Looking for someone?

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,670
You know, one day, I'm
going to end up shooting you.

153
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,872
That'll be the day.

154
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,608
By the way, you smell.

155
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,509
I can shower.

156
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,309
Good idea.

157
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,788
[Moaning]

158
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,810
That wasn't making love.

159
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,712
That was fucking to forget.

160
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,117
You still love her, don't you?

161
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,222
Who?

162
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,657
You know who.

163
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,927
Your wife.

164
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,862
Ex-wife.

165
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:49,663
And I never see her.

166
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,737
I saw her today.

167
00:08:56,837 --> 00:09:00,107
She was down at Central.

168
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,909
She's been made
detective over the 21st.

169
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:05,779
Homicide.

170
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:15,022
And she's been put on psych
evaluation, just like you.

171
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,094
Psych evaluation?

172
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,330
Those fuckers.

173
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,032
Of course they'd put
us on psych evaluation.

174
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,600
They got no pity.

175
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,068
Crazy cops.

176
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,469
Psych evaluation.

177
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,039
I guess no one can have a
shitty year in general anymore.

Come on.

190
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:14,614
Bring that black clad
leather ass over here.

this for you, Jack.

203

I need an official
identification, Jack.

204
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,983
Yes, this is my daughter.

205
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,752
Did she die quickly?

206
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,387
DOCTOR: We finished
posting her an hour ago.

207
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,891
She was raped and sodomized.

208
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:03,030
The abdominal perforations
are from some kind of tool,

209
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,497
A screwdriver maybe.

up at this hour, buddy.

Oh, it's OK.

216

I was sleeping shitty anyway.

217
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,168
Yeah, I thought you might
want to be in on this.

218
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,336
A lady called a little while
ago, said she heard screaming.

219
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,137
Hmm.

Talk to me, Phil.
What do we have?

PHIL: We need some backup.

Well, we got a

Yeah.

250
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:05,585
I'll never eat hot dogs again.

251
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:06,619
Is this going to make me sick?

252
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,189
As a dog.

253
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,557
OK.

254
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:11,859
SGT. BILLY: It
looks like they've

255
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,795
Done the poor fuck in the
bathroom, right about here.

256
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,430
Shit.

257
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,267
He must have put up a hell of
a struggle before he went down.

Do you remember the
movie "Deliverance"?

269
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:44,892
Yeah.

270
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,226
Why?

271
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,328
Well, I said it was Ned Beatty
that got the dick of death

From the country fuck
with the bad teeth.

273
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,000
Phil thinks it was John Voight.

274
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,101
It was Voight.

SGT. BILLY: No fucking way, man.

276
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,937
It was Ned who got butt hosed.

What the fuck is this?

278
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,306
It was Ned Beatty, OK?

279
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:00,407
- Bullshit.
- No bullshit.

280
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,208
Would you pay the man?

281
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,009
It was Ned.

with pathology.

That explains everything.

And the stats show
he was arrested

297
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,808
And indicted but
conviction for the rape

298
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,545
Of a 12-year-old girl in 1991.

299
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,812
The case was
dismissed due to lack

300
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:43,150
Of evidence, failure of
witness to appear and testify.

301
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,585

clean as a whistle.

like a damn turkey.

00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,966
Or our perp could be male.

375
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,135
The hair follicles
found at the other scene

376
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,872
Could belong to anyone,
girlfriend, housekeeper, maybe

377
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,374
Even his mother.

378
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,076
It proves nothing,
except that we have hair.

379
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,078
Our perp is female.

380
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,847
Just what the hell are
you doing here, Jenny?

381
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:11,951
This is my jurisdiction,
shared with Central, of course.

382
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:12,819
Good day, gentlemen.

383
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,558
Boy, Thanksgiving at their
house must be a bitch.

384
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,627
No shit.

385
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:21,661
I don't want you on this case.

386
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:25,097
I'm not asking your permission.

387
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,299
Still pissed at me, aren't you?

388
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,099
No, Jack.

389
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,268
I'm pissed in general.

390
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,069
I'm trying to get
my life back, and I

391
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
Can do that by doing my job.

392
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,139
So let me.

393
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,010
Shit.

394
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,551
It looks like we've got
ourselves a serial case here.

395
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,319
Yeah, it looks like it.

396
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,720
Listen, do me a
favor, would you?

397
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,088
I want you to ID
this guy, and I want

398
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,560
You to check for any priors,
rape specifically or attempted.

399
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,961
Jack, what do I
look like, a blonde

400
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,929
With big tits and a sign on top
of my head that says fuck me,

401
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,298
I'm dumb?

402
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,432
I do this for a
living, remember?

403
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,633
I know.
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,768
Man, you get
around your ex-wife,

405
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,102
And your brains turn to shit.

406
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:06,606
Yeah.

407
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,448
This department has enough
of a bad rap, dick head,

408
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,284
And you're not helping it.

409
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,685
Something on your mind, Billy?

410
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,886
Yeah.

411
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,754
I read the report last
night for Manuelo Carrera.

412
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,290
It sucks.

413
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,425
I think you shot the
fucker a couple of times

414
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,860
And got a confession out of him.

415
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,896
You got all that
from my report, huh?

416
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:30,697
Come on, Jack.

417
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,064
I read ME's autopsy.

418
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,301
What the fuck you
doing out there?

419
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,768
My job, Bill.

420
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:36,569
Oh, yeah?

421
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,970
Well, shit runs downhill.

422
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,507
And your guerrilla tactics
ain't helping us any.

423
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,909
You know, you've been an ass
ever since your kid kicked,

424
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,844
And your wife left you.

425
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:45,978
Funny guy.

426
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,179
Fuck you, man?
What the fuck are you doing?

427
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,980
Fuck you.

428
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,015
Get the fuck outta here.

429
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:49,916
Fuck you.

430
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:50,717
Lay off.

431
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:51,818
Your partner's a psycho case.

432
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,252
Fuck you, man.

433
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,721
Get the fuck out.

434
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:55,855
[Inaudible] on my own, Billy.

435
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,758
You're an asshole, Jack.

436
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,059
He's going to get
you killed one day.

437
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,529
You can bet on it, asshole.

438
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,663
You know something, Billy?

439
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,597
What?

440
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,898
The day I bite
it... that's going

441
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,401
To be the day Jack isn't there.

442
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,502
Get the fuck outta here.

443
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,207
Don't let Billy get to you.

444
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:18,678
Besides, we got our second ID.

445
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,781
Callister, Raymond B. He
works part time as a bartender

446
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,082
At the Shark's Cove.

447
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,283
I made a call to
the joint yesterday

448
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,653
And talked to the owner.

449
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:31,658
He said Callister left at 2:00
in the morning with a woman.

450
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:32,492
Uh-huh.

451
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,427
Well, it's a start, isn't it?

452
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,429
I also talked to your
new girlfriend in Rape.

453
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:37,764
What's her name?

454
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:38,998
Trish.

455
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,367
Yeah, Trish.

456
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,001
Pretty.

457
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:45,204
Anyway, this guy Callister, two
for two on a rape prior, 1991.

458
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,374
Same story as the first victim.

459
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,609
Released due to insufficient
evidence and a no-show

460
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,911
By the alleged victim.

461
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,180
A few minor misdemeanors since
'91, but other than that,

462
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,148
Nothing to get a hard-on for.

463
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,884
Let's pay the Shark's
Cove a little visit.

464
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:01,120
Yeah.

465
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,655
Anyway, Trish wanted to see you.

466
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,657
She wouldn't let me
give you a message.

467
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,359
Where's Trish?

468
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,159
She's in the lady's.

469
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,227
She'll be back in a second.

470
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,600
Can I say something, Jack?

471
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,401
Sure, Susan.

472
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,568
Shoot.

473
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,037
I know you and
Trish are involved.

474
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,171
She loves you.

475
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,307
You know, it may be
a cheap fuck for you,

476
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:25,077
But it means more to her.

477
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,813
[Whistling]

478
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:27,614
Hi.

479
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,248
Hi.

480
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,217
You know Susan just gave
me the Bill of Rights?

481
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,886
I don't treat you
good, and I'm dog meat.

482
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:34,687
She's protective.

483
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,656
Yeah, like a pit bull.

484
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:37,724
I wanted to show you something.

485
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,361
Here's the list that you
wanted on your two victims.

486
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,563
OK.

487
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,998
Both arrested on
rape two months ago.

488
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,800
Both released on
insufficient evidence

489
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,538
And/or failure of appearance
by alleged victim to testify.

490
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:52,905
Pretty standard.

491
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,241
Well, it's some kind
of pattern, at least.

492
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,410
You're thinking this
mad woman is going

493
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,878
Around hunting these guys down?

494
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,046
Why not?

495
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,615
The trick is to see
who she hits next.

496
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,818
Well, out of 36
non-convictions and releases,

497
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,954
16 have been
re-incarcerated, eight

498
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,990
Show as being unaccounted for,
and two of course are dead.

499
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,992
That's two, four, six.

500
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,695
That leaves 10 that our shooter
might be able to track down.

501
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,096
True.

502
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,666
Only if she had this file.

503
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,769
Well, who has access to it?

504
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,171
Cops.

505
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,607
Cops.

506
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,676
Adams and Callister
were hit last night,

507
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,844
Both killed in
alphabetical order.

508
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,212
You know, I'm
having a tough time

509
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:36,082
Believing that our killer is
hitting these guys like that.

510
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,717
I'm having a tough enough
time buying the fact

511
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,186
That our perp may be a cop.

512
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,522
Me too.

513
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,156
You know, if we are
dealing with a cop,

514
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,158
We're dealing with a
very twisted sister.

515
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,026
You hear?

516
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:47,827
Yeah.

517
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,073
Evening, boys.

518
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:06,613
We got a $5 cover, and the
girls don't like to be touched.

519
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,615
Looks like your
kind of place, Jack.

520
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,116
Yeah, and the
girls look fragile.

521
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,120
Thank you, sir.

522
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,093
[Inaudible].

523
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,094
They look sweet.

524
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:40,547
I'll bet you have nine inches
of red, hot, pussy-loving dick.

525
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:44,551
Make that 12 inches...
From the floor up.

526
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,554
[Laughing]

527
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,593
And what about you, blanco?

528
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,495
You look like a sad man.

529
00:24:56,596 --> 00:25:01,333
I can make you happy for $40.

530
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,935
$40, huh?

531
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:03,903
Mm-hmm.

532
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,204
Do you play?

533
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,675
Yeah, I play.

534
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:12,311
You play with Manawa, you lose.

535
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,946
But I'll tell you what.

536
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:19,852
For another $40, I can show you
my favorite game in the back.

537
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:20,687
In the back, huh?

538
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:21,754
I have an idea.

539
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,155
Let's play with a
little white ball here.

540
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,357
You win, you win $40.

541
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,194
You lose, you still win $20.

542
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:30,597
Deal?

543
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,498
I like you, blanquito.

544
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,465
She likes me.

545
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,370
Maybe you and I could
be friends one day, huh?

546
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,171
Maybe.

547
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:48,781
Gentlemen, any special
services I can offer you.

548
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,149
Yeah, maybe.

549
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,585
Do you know Raymond Callister?

550
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:53,385
Yeah.

551
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,186
He's our bartender.

552
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,723
He works part time for me.

553
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:59,425
Actually, he was supposed
to come in tonight.

554
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,628
Well, that would be
a little difficult.

555
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,762
Why's that?

556
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:03,562
JACK: Because he's dead.

557
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,164
That's why.

558
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,668
We thought you might
be of some help.

559
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,471
You are, uh,
friends of Callister?

560
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,405
Did he leave anything here?

561
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,577
Yeah, behind the bar.

562
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:21,047
He left a duffel
bag here last night.

563
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,449
[Speaking spanish]

564
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,659
JACK: You got a nice little
place here, Mister, um...

565
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,525
Tyreen.

566
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:34,927
[Inaudible] Tyreen.

567
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,428
I own it.

568
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,897
Oh, you own it?

569
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,398
Well, that's really
bloody interesting.

570
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,533
You know most of your customers
here are snorting cocaine

571
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,703
Like there's no tomorrow?

572
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,337
That's against the
law here in America.

573
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,075
It's a pity if a couple
of cops would see that.

574
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,242
I don't like threats.

575
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,043
Get them.

576
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,481
Behind you.

577
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:01,854
What happened to
our friendship?

578
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,322
Fuck you, asshole.

579
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,730
Back off.

580
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,165
Back up.

581
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,333
You're my bitch.

582
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,134
You're my bitch!

583
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,168
Shut the fuck up.

584
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:17,136
You back off too.

585
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:17,937
No, pal.

586
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,238
He's my bitch.

587
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,372
Get the fuck outta here.

588
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,074
Get outta here.
Get out the door, both of you.

589
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:22,875
Come on.

590
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,844
Now.

591
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,813
Kneel.

592
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:29,248
Kneel!

593
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,183
You fuckers.

594
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,251
You always this friendly, man?

595
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,652
No.

596
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,121
Usually I'm a real cocksucker,
but you caught me on a good day

597
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,422
Today.

598
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,858
Tyreen, I want you to look
at this piece of paper, OK?

599
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,026
Phil, open that.

600
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,293
I want you to tell
me if you recognize

601
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,461
Any of the names on that list?

602
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:46,498
No.

603
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:47,700
No one.

604
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,201
Just Callister.

605
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:50,803
You told me that Callister
left here last night

606
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:51,838
Around 2:00 in the morning.

607
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:52,905
Is that correct?

608
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,473
Yeah, about that time.

609
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,075
Was he alone?

610
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,076
No.

611
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,577
Who did he go with?

612
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,712
A woman.

613
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,447
Describe her.

614
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:06,018
She was young, pretty,
nice tits, a great ass, man.

615
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,354
I even offered her a job.

616
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:09,756
What did she say?

617
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,323
She laughed.

618
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,392
She said she already got a job.

619
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:14,660
She said, would you
believe I'm a cop?

620
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,564
A cop?

621
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,874
You know, Phil, if you were a
woman in a pit like that, faced

622
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,076
With a slime ball like
Tyreen offering you a job,

623
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,444
Would you be saying,
no thanks, I'm a cop?

624
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,913
You know, that does
sound a little strange.

625
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,885
You know, it was
one year, two nights

626
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:41,420
Ago that Tina was found dead.

627
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,124
Same night as the first murder.

628
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,058
Coincidence.

629
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:46,993
That's all I'm going to say.

630
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,162
Coincidence.

631
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:55,634
I wonder.

632
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,037
[Engine starts]

633
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,339
You're late, Jack.

634
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,508
Yeah, well, I just want you
to know I feel great and really

635
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,777
Love the miracle of life.

636
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,146
Well, that sounds to
me like a crock of shit.

637
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,547
Yeah, well, would you
just sign the paper

638
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:11,717
Where it says I love my inner
child and jerk off regularly.

639
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:13,685
Then Meadows will stop
goosing me every two minutes.

640
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:16,856
Jack, word has it you're
getting laid these days.

641
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:18,157
You reading the
bathroom walls again?

642
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,358
I don't need to.

643
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,064
What is this?

644
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,099
Straight from the Commissioner.

645
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,168
He wants your psych sessions
to be taken jointly.

646
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,403
And frankly, I don't
think it's a bad idea.

647
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,538
Aw, fuck.

648
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:33,372
Shit.

649
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:34,173
Oh, good.

650
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,774
We're in mutual agreement.

651
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,977
David, let me put
it real simply, OK?

652
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,079
A year ago, someone raped
and murdered my daughter.

653
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,547
Now the best thing I
can do is stay working.

654
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,515
Me sitting here and
listening to my ex-wife

655
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,818
Tell me it was my fault
isn't going to help.

656
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:49,021
Don't lay a guilt trip on me
for you screwing up at work.

657
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,157
It was my daughter too.

658
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:51,958
Fine.

659
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,125
This is bullshit.

660
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,226
Jack.

661
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:55,127
Jack.

662
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,163
Doc, he's stressed.

663
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:59,999
So am I. Do you blame us?

664
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,435
No, I guess not.

665
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:06,372
LT. MEADOWS: All right.

666
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,940
Let's hear what we have.

667
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,242
What we don't have,
Lieutenant, is shit.

668
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,143
All right.

669
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,678
Why don't we go into specifics?

670
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:13,946
OK.

671
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:18,317
Two victims, both within a
12 hour period, both male,

672
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,752
Both found naked with multiple
lacerations of the stomach

673
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:23,155
And torso and a single
fatal gunshot wound

674
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,057
To the head or torso.

675
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,193
According to the
coroner's report,

676
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:31,130
The genitalia of both victims
were removed prior to death.

677
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,200
We have no witnesses,
no fingerprints, at least

678
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,435
None that corroborate with
existing computer records.

679
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:39,805
Oh, and by the way,
we have no suspects.

680
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:42,674
And nothing on the mystery
lady that whacked you, Jack?

681
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,877
JACK: Like the man said,
we don't have shit.

682
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,947
Ostensibly, our
shooter is female.

683
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:49,048
Ah, Detective Mason.
Good.

684
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:49,882
Thank you.

685
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,885
Please have a seat right here.

686
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,121
I've asked Dr. Wilson to
sit in with us on this one,

687
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:57,356
And Detective Mason is
part of a joint effort

688
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:00,226
Of the 21st in our precinct
to resolve this matter.

689
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:03,262
I object to Detective Mason's
involvement on this case.

690
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,530
On what grounds, Jack?

691
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,732
On the grounds that she is
psychologically unprepared

692
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,767
To be involved in a
case of this nature.

693
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,836
Well, due to the nature of
this case, as you put it,

694
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:13,839
Jack, are you any more
prepared to be involved?

695
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,874
Oh, come on.

696
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,777
Detective Mason
and Detective Mason,

697
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,280
I appreciate the personal
difficulties in your lives

698
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,581
At the moment.

699
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:25,684
This forum is not the
place to air them.

700
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:28,387
If, however, either one of you
feels that your past tragedy

701
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:32,091
In any way adversely affects
the prosecution of this case,

702
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,559
Let me know now, and
you'll be relieved

703
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,994
Of any further
responsibility to it.

704
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,395
Look, I've got a
partner on this already.

705
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,064
I understand that, Jack.

706
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:41,067
Jennifer is a liaison
between the 21st precinct

707
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:42,634
And ours on this case.

708
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,538
And you'll be her
primary contact, Jack.

709
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,708
Now Dr. Wilson, you've
read the preliminary file

710
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:50,476
On these killings.

711
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,644
Any comments?

712
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,746
Well, we're obviously
dealing with a

713
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,583
Paranoid psychotic personality.

714
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,418
The homicidal
tendencies are clearly

715
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:04,356
Combined with a psychosexual
hatred of everything male.

716
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,425
Now, if our killer is
selecting his victims...

717
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:10,762
His or her victims...
Randomly, we've

718
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:11,897
Got our job cut out for us.

719
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:13,865
Well, what if the
murders are revenge based?

720
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,467
It cuts down our
field of probabilities.

721
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,768
Look, look.

722
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,871
What we have to establish is
a motive and a commonality

723
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,273
Between the victims.

724
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,742
Well, gee, that sounds simple.

725
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,044
Lady and gentlemen,
let's get to work.

726
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:39,458
How dare you put
me down like that?

727
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,259
I told you.

728
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,128
This is my job.

729
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:44,463
Your job to worm yourself
back into this precinct

730
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,298
Again and make our lives
more miserable than they

731
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,133
Already are?

732
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,967
What is that supposed to mean?

733
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,137
It means, Jane, that we
damn near destroyed ourselves

734
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,204
Last year after Tina died.

735
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,805
And we wisely broke up.

736
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,041
Why are you doing this?

737
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,842
I didn't ask to be here.

738
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,345
You can blame our
shrinks for that.

739
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:00,746
Fine, I'll do that.

740
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,848
But you and I have
an understanding, OK?

741
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,983
You communicate through
channels only with me.

742
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:05,784
Got it?

743
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,154
Agreed.

744
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:10,089
Jack.

745
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,057
JACK: Excuse us.

746
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,928
Look, you're not the only one.

747
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,331
I keep hearing her talk to
that stupid pigeon of yours.

748
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:24,770
Milton, cuckoo.

749
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,273
I love you.

750
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:29,775
Milton, cuckoo.

751
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:30,909
I love you, Milton.

752
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,379
Cuckoo.

753
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:37,049
What I mean is I miss her too.

754
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:48,627
[Barking]

755
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,429
Good girl.

756
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,697
I think you found a new friend.

757
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:52,498
Yeah.

758
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,032
I'll take all I can get.

759
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,001
You know, it's been a while
since you've come around here,

760
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:57,103
Jack.

761
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:58,604
I'm sorry, Gwen.

762
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,172
Listen, this was
a hell of a meal.

763
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:02,508
Thanks.

764
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:05,244
Yeah, and you're
a hell of a dog.

765
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,779
She ate more than you did, pal.

766
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,014
She's made like a damn horse.

767
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:10,549
You know, when I was
first dating her,

768
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,917
All she did was
eat like a rabbit.

769
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,286
But now a year later, I've
married a longshoreman.

770
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,054
I heard that, buddy.

771
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,256
You're up shit creek now, pal.

772
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,024
You calling me a pig?

773
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,826
Well, pigs don't eat that much.

774
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,562
Oh, well, this
little piggy thinks

775
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,197
That maybe you'd just like
a little whipped cream

776
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,132
On your face.

777
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:27,533
You deserved that, pal.

778
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,401
PHIL: What are you doing?

779
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:32,037
What do you think you're doing?

780
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:33,105
I can't believe you.

781
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,373
Oh.
Oh.

782
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:35,474
Help me, Jack.
Help me.

783
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,008
He's killing me.
Sorry, Gwen.

784
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,809
GWEN: Stop.

785
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,744
Stop.

786
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,112
I don't think is
good for the baby.

787
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:40,846
Stop.
Wait, wait.

788
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,248
What'd you say?

789
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:44,116
Baby?

790
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:47,085
Is it a boy or a girl?

791
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,420
Why didn't you tell me this?

792
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,421
I...

793
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,356
PHIL: I'm sorry
about that pig crack.

794
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:51,357
GWEN: No, no.
It's not...

795
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:52,691
PHIL: You shouldn't be working.
A baby...

796
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,161
GWEN: I'm fine.

797
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,663
[Laughing]

798
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,830
Ow, ow, ow.

799
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,631
Stop it.

800
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:00,632
Stop it.

801
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,134
Ow.

802
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,635
Oh, I'm going to get you.

803
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:04,636
I'm going to get you.

804
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:05,471
I'm going to get you now.

805
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,405
I'm going to get you.

806
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,740
I'm going to get mommy as well.

807
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,109
PHIL: We're pregnant, Jack.

808
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,380
A toast.

809
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,514
Cheers.

810
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,315
Cheers.

811
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:20,952
OK.

812
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,222
Let us assume that our
killer is being systematic.

813
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:27,626
J Donaldson is next after
Callister, then N Ford.

814
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,128
I think I'll pay a little
visit to Donaldson.

815
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,164
Why don't you snag Ford?

816
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,199
Yeah.

817
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,567
M Jefferson is next,
and then B Kelly.

818
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,203
There's a few in between,
but no addresses.

819
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,003
OK.

820
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,104
I'll take Jefferson too.

821
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:42,441
Why don't you make
some calls on Kelly?

822
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,975
You go on ahead, buddy.

823
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,979
I got me some celebrating to do.

824
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,718
Honey, if anything
ever happened to me...

825
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,653
What are you talking about?

826
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:58,056
I mean, if anything
ever did, do me a favor.

827
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,125
Go to Jack.

828
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:02,561
He'll take care of you.

829
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,931
Nothing is going
to happen to you.

830
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,335
You are going to be a daddy.

831
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:11,803
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

832
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,172
You got that, pal?

833
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,107
OK.

834
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:17,075
Yeah.

835
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,411
Me, a dad.

836
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,412
A daddy.

837
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,373
Donaldson,
Donaldson, Donaldson.

838
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:54,813
[Screaming]

839
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:56,782
Open up.

840
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,284
Open up in there.

841
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,285
Goddamn it, open up.

842
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:10,429
Open... back up, motherfucker.

843
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:11,229
Back up.

844
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,163
Hands in the air.

845
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:13,198
Hands in the air.
Drop it.

846
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:14,132
Drop it.
Shut up.

847
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,601
What the fuck do you want, man?

848
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:16,402
Who's the fucking girl?

849
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:17,869
Who is she?

850
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,438
She's my goddamn wife.
You got a problem with that?

851
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:20,639
Why was she screaming, huh?
Why?

852
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,840
Man, I always make
my women scream.

853
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,175
You got a problem with that?

854
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,010
I'm a cop.

855
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,778
I heard screaming, goddammit.

856
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:27,946
Oh, you're a motherfucking cop.

857
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,047
Where's your search
warrant, pig?

858
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:29,848
Huh?

859
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:30,849
Look, I don't have a warrant.

860
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:31,717
I'm sorry about all this.

861
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:32,718
Eat me.

862
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,620
I pay my goddamn
taxes, you fucking pig.

863
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,687
You got a badge number?

864
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:36,488
Motherfucker.

865
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,623
JACK: This is my fault, OK?

866
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:38,757
Fuck you.

867
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,091
Get the fuck out of here.

868
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,527
Yeah, get out of
here, you fucking pig.

869
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,361
WOMAN: Asshole.

870
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,162
Fuck you.

871
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,263
Ford got married
two months ago.

872
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,832
The addresses is bogus.

873
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,100
The guy left town,
according to the neighbors.

874
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,636
Kelly was evicted
five months ago.

875
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,203
No one has a clue where he is.

876
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:53,505
Which means neither
does our shooter.

877
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,406
PHIL (ON PHONE): Copy that.

878
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:55,273
Who's next on the list?

879
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:56,241
Yeah.

880
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:58,577
Munsen, R and
Ellis, K. Munsen is

881
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:03,915
At a warehouse on 404 South 3rd,
and Ellis is 206 Pico, both LA.

882
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,751
My, this is fun.

883
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,386
How did Jefferson work out?

884
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,755
JACK (ON PHONE): Well, I'm
off to see Jefferson now.

885
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,357
You know, we can't exclude
Donaldson as a target

886
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,858
Just because he's married.

887
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,059
Yeah, I know, Phil.

888
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,261
But I have the feeling
that our lady is going

889
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:18,296
After single targets only.

890
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:19,631
A gut hunch?

891
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,367
Yeah.

892
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,435
Another gut hunch.

893
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:24,235
I'll talk to you.

894
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,186
Son of a bitch.

895
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,943
[Horn honking]

896
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,782
Damn, what's the matter
with you, you asshole?

897
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:17,816
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

898
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,650
Jesus Christ.

899
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,051
You goddamned near killed me.

900
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,820
Can't you watch where you going?
Son of a bitch.

901
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,121
- I'm sorry.
- You goddamned near kill me.

902
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,022
I'm sorry.

903
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:24,823
You fucking asshole.

904
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:25,657
Watch where you're going.

905
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,658
I'm sorry.

906
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,440
WOMAN: Freeze.

907
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,241
Turn around, slowly.

908
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:50,348
Oh, Jack.

909
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,751
What are you doing here?

910
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,853
I might ask you the
same question, Jen.

911
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,022
The same thing
as you, obviously.

912
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,790
Obviously.

913
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,791
I saw her.

914
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:00,592
Who?

915
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:01,627
You know who.

916
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:03,629
She clobbered me 10
minutes ago again.

917
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:06,498
I couldn't see her face, but
I saw what she was wearing

918
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,333
And what color her hair was.

919
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:09,467
What color was it?

920
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,670
Your color, and she was
dressed just like you.

921
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,905
You think it was me?

922
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,206
I don't know.

923
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,141
I chased her.

924
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,609
I lost her five
minutes from here.

925
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,811
It's conceivable you could have
circled around and come back.

926
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:20,612
Yes.

927
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,782
Why would I come back?

928
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:25,951
You tell me, Jenny.

929
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:27,753
This is crazy, Jack.

930
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:30,188
You know that.

931
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,157
Jesus Christ.

932
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:34,926
I'm a cop.

933
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,327
Yeah.

934
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,128
I know, Jenny.

935
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,034
Jack giving you a hard time?

936
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:46,772
Jack always gives
me a hard time.

937
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,406
Thank you, gents.

938
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,975
Mm-hmm.

939
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:50,809
We found the car.

940
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,210
You were right.

941
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,780
No plates, no paperwork.

942
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,648
I'll check stolens too.

943
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:59,517
We got the, uh... the stiff
wanted to [inaudible].

944
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:02,087
You guys need anything else?

945
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,622
No, thanks.

946
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,090
I want to see the
postmortem report.

947
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,391
- You got it.
- Yeah.

948
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,759
I'll be outside if you need me.

949
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:08,827
Thanks, Billy.

950
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,462
Oh, and, uh, watch
yourself with Meadows.

951
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:13,565
He's got a real
stick up his ass.

952
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,801
What else is new?

953
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:16,968
Thank you for everything.

954
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,436
Sure.
Anything I can do, let me know.

955
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,237
Thanks.

956
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,777
Think she told Meadows
about your little list?

957
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:26,878
I think we're
about to find out.

958
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,718
It's number three, gentlemen.

959
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:35,520
And we're getting ripped
to shit by the press.

960
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:38,156
In other words, Metro's
finest ain't looking too good.

961
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,991
Lieutenant, mind if I ask
what you and Detective Mason

962
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,392
Were talking about earlier?

963
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,695
As a matter of fact, she asked
to be removed from this case.

964
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:46,031
May I ask why?

965
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,999
She felt that there were too
many issues in her own life

966
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,534
To make it impossible
for her to continue

967
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:51,937
With this
investigation properly.

968
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:54,105
Find this psycho, bitch boys.

969
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:57,142
Three dickless corpses in 24
hours gets me in a bad mood.

970
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,349
She didn't mention your list.

971
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,416
No, she didn't, Phil.

972
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:17,829
What are you doing here?

973
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,932
I live here, Jack.

974
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,301
Hi, Jack.

975
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:26,672
Um, Susan wants to
apologize for the other day.

976
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,740
Don't you, Susan?

977
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,841
No hard feelings, Jack?

978
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,415
Since when have you
become so tight with her?

979
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:40,018
Since about 27 years ago.

980
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:43,321
Susan's my sister.

981
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,490
Your sister?

982
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,126
She kept her married name.

983
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:48,927
Uh-huh.

984
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,029
Where's her husband?

985
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,299
They're separated.

986
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,201
She moved in here.

987
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,169
I owed her that.

988
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,338
Susan's the reason I'm a cop.

989
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,908
She got me into the auxiliary
and then the academy.

990
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:06,712
So you better be nice to
me, or my big sister's

991
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:09,514
Going to beat you up.

992
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:10,481
What's wrong, Jack?

993
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,521
It's my wife.

994
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:20,358
My ex-wife, Jenny.

995
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:24,629
Do you remember Jefferson, one
of the bad guys on your list?

996
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:30,301
Well, I found him dead
today, and Jenny was there.

997
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,338
And I'm starting to think that
maybe Jenny is... I'm thinking

998
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:34,873
That maybe she's one of...

999
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:45,516
Drink this.

1000
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,317
Thanks.

1001
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,455
That felt like an exorcism.

1002
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,792
Sorry.

1003
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,726
Don't be.

1004
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:31,662
I felt needed.

1005
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:33,631
It's kind of like love.

1006
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:47,245
Where are you going?

1007
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,547
I've got work, honey.

1008
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:50,348
Right.

1009
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:51,449
Get laid and leave.

1010
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:56,788
Come on.

1011
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:57,588
Don't do that.

1012
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:04,495
Honey, what the
hell are you doing?

1013
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,166
Look, I don't have
time for... Trish.

1014
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:19,277
Don't touch.

1015
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:26,151
[Moaning]

1016
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,912
PHIL: Have you heard
of psittacosis?

1017
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:55,146
Pigeon shit disease.

1018
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:55,947
The shit dries through.

1019
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:57,382
It's a dust.

1020
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,183
You breathe it in.

1021
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,017
It sticks to your lungs.

1022
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:00,418
You're one dead motherfucker.

1023
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:01,686
Psittacosis.
Oh, psittacosis.

1024
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:02,921
Yeah, I'll remember that one.

1025
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,227
PHIL: Lose the bird, Jack.

1026
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,028
That's my advice.

1027
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:17,869
Milton, cuckoo.

1028
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:18,669
I love you.

1029
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:23,942
I can't do that, Phil.

1030
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:24,742
Yeah.

1031
00:47:34,152 --> 00:47:35,186
Anything?

1032
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,422
No, not a bloody thing.

1033
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:40,625
I think we have to rule out
the alphabetical approach.

1034
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,962
And there's no pattern to
her targeting based on dates

1035
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,898
Of release, birth, or arrest.

1036
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:47,798
There you go.

1037
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:50,101
Whoops.

1038
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,003
I know we're both
thinking the same thing,

1039
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:54,305
Even though we haven't
said it officially yet.

1040
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,375
We're both thinking
that Jenny's a suspect.

1041
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,610
Yeah.

1042
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,346
That's what we're thinking.

1043
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:02,981
Well, [inaudible]
isn't our only go.

1044
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:06,351
I'm going to research every
female cop on the force.

1045
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:10,555
Psych evals and pre-enlistment
files should be easy to get.

1046
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:12,323
If any one of them even
vaguely smells bad,

1047
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:13,591
We're looking into it.

1048
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:15,460
Right?

1049
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,261
Yeah.

1050
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:17,062
Right.

1051
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:22,700
I ever tell you how
we met, Jenny and me?

1052
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,501
JACK: Yeah.

1053
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:24,902
15 years ago at the academy.

1054
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:27,038
Yeah.

1055
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:29,540
First time I ever laid eyes on
her was on the target range.

1056
00:48:32,177 --> 00:48:34,812
My god, she was beautiful.

1057
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,282
And a crack shot, too.

1058
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:38,449
With a .38.

1059
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:41,219
Yeah, with a .38.

1060
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:44,389
That was her favorite.

1061
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,524
Anyway, there we were.

1062
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,026
Targets come up.

1063
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:50,861
She with the .38,
me with Beretta.

1064
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:51,896
We shoot.

1065
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:53,999
[Mimics gun]

1066
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:55,533
She gets a perfect score.

1067
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:56,801
Me?

1068
00:48:56,901 --> 00:49:02,540
I lay a big fat egg, scores
lower than a rat's ass.

1069
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,012
She always said that I could
never hit the side of a barn.

1070
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:08,879
By god, she was right.

1071
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,416
Oh, Phil, I hope it's not her.

1072
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:14,685
I worked with Jenny for a
month last April at the academy.

1073
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,054
Yeah, I remember.

1074
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:19,890
She was good, smart.

1075
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:24,295
But she didn't seem like the
type, the type to go nuts.

1076
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:30,535
She was always
cool, professional.

1077
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,037
It's not her.

1078
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:40,878
JENNIFER: You come
to arrest me, Jack?

1079
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,213
No.

1080
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,014
You mind if I come in?

1081
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:56,294
Yes, Jack, it's
laced with brandy.

1082
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:57,995
Since when did you
start drinking, Jenny?

1083
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:00,898
Since about a year ago, Jack.

1084
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,667
What were you doing
there yesterday?

1085
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:03,634
I told you.

1086
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,836
I have the same
list that you have.

1087
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:07,038
Well, I was your
liaison, remember?

1088
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:09,240
You're supposed
to tell me first.

1089
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,942
Going to Jefferson's was
a spur of the moment thing.

1090
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:13,278
Running into you is coincidence.

1091
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:14,079
Yeah.

1092
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,413
Coincidence, right.

1093
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,082
Fuck you, Jack.

1094
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:18,216
I know what you're thinking.

1095
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:19,717
Yeah, fuck you, Jenny.
I think you did it.

1096
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:20,718
Yeah.

1097
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:21,986
All the evidence
seems to point to you.

1098
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:23,020
OK, fine.

1099
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:24,089
Prove me wrong.

1100
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,590
Why didn't you tell
Meadows about the list?

1101
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,724
Why didn't you?

1102
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:27,958
Because I was protecting
your ass, that's why.

1103
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,294
If I would've told
Meadows, he would

1104
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,096
Have dragged your ass down
this morning for a word with us

1105
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:31,896
About the murder.

1106
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:32,797
That's bullshit.

1107
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:34,432
That's circumstantial evidence.

1108
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,500
Bullshit, fine.

1109
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,034
I can still nail you
on one other thing.

1110
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:38,436
What's that, Jack?

1111
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,372
When Trish pulled up the list,
there were only two other IDs

1112
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,274
Attached to the mainframe for
accessing and compiling it.

1113
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,875
One was Trish's, and
the other was yours.

1114
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,211
Oh, come on.

1115
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:47,812
Anyone could have erased their
name from the log-on code.

1116
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:49,980
If you were systematically
planning to murder someone,

1117
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:51,048
Would you leave a trail?

1118
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:52,150
Answer my question.

1119
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,418
Why didn't you tell
Meadows about the list?

1120
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:55,953
Have you ever
heard of IA, Jack?

1121
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,755
Internal Affairs would have
pawed around in this thing

1122
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,225
So much, our shooter would've
stayed under for months, maybe

1123
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:01,859
Even years.

1124
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:05,330
Jack, if this is a cop...
And we got to believe

1125
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:08,233
That it is... then she's smart.

1126
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,066
She knows procedure.

1127
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,868
I mean, she knows protocol.

1128
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:13,338
Yeah, she's smart, all right.

1129
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,005
Boy, you seem to have an
answer for every question,

1130
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:16,341
Don't you, Jen?

1131
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,176
If the question
is logical, yes.

1132
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:23,481
Meadows told me that you had
yourself taken off the case.

1133
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:24,415
Oh, god.

1134
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:27,185
Want to tell me why?

1135
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:29,820
I almost shot you
yesterday, Jack.

1136
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,222
One wrong move,
and I would have.

1137
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:32,022
OK.

1138
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:33,624
You're... you're right.

1139
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:37,195
I'm not psychologically suited
for this particular case.

1140
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:40,431
Oh, Jack.

1141
00:51:44,502 --> 00:51:48,373
The thought of killing you...

1142
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:50,875
OK.

1143
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:51,876
I'm sorry.

1144
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:07,525
Jack, I haven't been
with anyone since...

1145
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,293
Shh.

1146
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:37,282
Penny for your thoughts?

1147
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:43,621
I was thinking of
Adams and Callister.

1148
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:48,426
Remember them?

1149
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:49,360
What about them?

1150
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,164
I'm wondering how
a bad girl got them

1151
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:58,536
Naked, handcuffed and naked.

1152
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:04,241
At gunpoint, maybe?

1153
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:11,248
Well, maybe she
seduced them into it.

1154
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:19,056
Maybe she promised
them a good time.

1155
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,528
Maybe she kissed them first.

1156
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:30,601
And then told them they were
about to experience something

1157
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:37,007
They had never felt before.

1158
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:47,952
Then when she has them tied up,
our bad girl makes her move.

1159
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,094
[Laughing]

1160
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,298
Seduction, Jack.

1161
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:04,234
That's her weapon.

1162
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:05,736
The rest is cake.

1163
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:14,612
She mutilates them.

1164
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,549
And then she shoots them.

1165
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:23,954
And then she [inaudible].

1166
00:55:28,493 --> 00:55:32,363
Can you buy that
theory, detective?

1167
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:33,798
Completely.

1168
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:39,103
Can I ask you a
question, hypothetically?

1169
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:41,506
Shoot.

1170
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:45,309
What if you discovered
that I was the killer?

1171
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,144
What would you do?

1172
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:49,514
Is that a confession?

1173
00:55:49,614 --> 00:55:51,015
Think about it.

1174
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:53,984
It's not like the men on
that list were innocent.

1175
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,654
In all probability,
they hurt those girls.

1176
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:58,322
How many rape cases
get thrown out

1177
00:55:58,423 --> 00:56:00,691
Of court because of no-shows?

1178
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:03,861
How many rapists
get off scot-free?

1179
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:08,499
In a way, don't you
feel they're getting

1180
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,935
Exactly what they deserve?

1181
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:17,708
My daughter was
taken from... from us.

1182
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:21,178
And now, what would you do?

1183
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,118
I'd stop you.

1184
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:38,028
I'll never forgive you
for what happened to Tina.

1185
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:44,001
But I never stopped loving you.

1186
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:48,973
And I never will.

1187
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:59,884
Dad, Milton's food is gone.

1188
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:01,652
Will you go out to the store?

1189
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,953
Oh, honey, I can't.

1190
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:05,022
I got to run down
to headquarters.

1191
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:06,190
I'll tell you what.

1192
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,792
You promise you'll be
back in five minutes,

1193
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:09,226
I'll let you go out.

1194
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:10,461
And don't tell mom.

1195
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:12,463
She'd kill me if I
didn't go with you.

1196
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:13,998
The store's only
a block away, dad.

1197
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:14,865
I can handle it.

1198
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:15,666
You can handle it, huh?

1199
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,667
Handle it.

1200
00:57:21,706 --> 00:57:24,274
Oh.

1201
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,075
Jenny?

1202
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:11,121
I still can't believe
that she's gone.

1203
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:18,028
You're right about
this case, Jack.

1204
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:19,496
Let it finish by itself.

1205
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:24,969
Maybe it'll all work
out for the best.

1206
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:50,861
PHIL: Jesus Christ, Jack.

1207
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,429
You still look
like a fucking pig.

1208
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,230
Fuck you.

1209
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,299
What do you have?

1210
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:56,901
Did you talk to her yet?

1211
00:58:57,001 --> 00:59:00,805
Yeah, I talked to
her, more than talked.

1212
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:01,739
She didn't do it.

1213
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,007
Maybe she did.

1214
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:04,374
She didn't do it, Phil.

1215
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:05,175
OK, OK.

1216
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:08,579
I believe you.

1217
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,514
I was going through
personnel files,

1218
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:14,585
Came across a bit of a
stinker, Susan Treadwell,

1219
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:17,221
Works in Rape, same as
your new girlfriend.

1220
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,956
Yeah, I know Susan.

1221
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,825
As a matter of fact,
she's Trish's sister.

1222
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:21,626
Scary lady.

1223
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:23,327
Yeah, well, get this.

1224
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:26,130
Two years ago, she shot
and killed her husband,

1225
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,098
Said it was self-defense.

1226
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:30,534
He had some kind
of drug problem.

1227
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:31,969
They called it an
open and shut case.

1228
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:32,770
It's all in here.

1229
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:37,675
Open and shut.

1230
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:44,381
Where the fuck are you going?

1231
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:47,785
We still have reasonable
doubt as to Jenny's innocence.

1232
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,954
I'm going to kill that doubt.

1233
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:51,388
DR. CARL STEINER: Look,
detective, I really

1234
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:52,757
Don't have time for this.

1235
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:54,358
I have a parole meeting at 3:00.

1236
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:56,293
I have lunch at
the mayor's office.

1237
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:57,962
I have sessions running all day.

1238
00:59:58,062 --> 00:59:59,964
I realize how busy
you are, Doctor.

1239
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:01,699
No, you don't
realize how busy I am.

1240
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,200
I haven't had time to piss.

1241
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,603
And when I don't piss, I
get really, really angry.

1242
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:09,106
So why don't you just make
a meeting for next week

1243
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:09,874
With my secretary?

1244
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:11,175
No, Doctor, this can't wait.

1245
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,977
This is very, very important.

1246
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:14,444
Please.
10 minutes.

1247
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:15,245
10 minutes.

1248
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:16,681
That's all I ask.

1249
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:20,084
Detective, you are
a pain in the ass.

1250
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:21,018
10 minutes.

1251
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,487
That's it.

1252
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:24,722
Thank you.

1253
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:27,658
What you're saying is
ridiculous, Detective Mason.

1254
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:29,727
But just out of
curiosity, why would you

1255
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:33,798
Think that Jennifer would even
be remotely capable of doing

1256
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:35,199
Such a horrible crime?

1257
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:38,936
Doctor, one year ago, our
daughter was kidnapped,

1258
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:43,107
Raped, sodomized, and killed.

1259
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:45,843
She was 10 years old.

1260
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,511
As you know, we never
caught the killer.

1261
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:55,085
Could something like this have
so changed a person, a mother,

1262
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:59,423
For instance, turned her into
something completely different,

1263
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:01,391
Something unrecognizable?

1264
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,127
So what you're
saying is that she was

1265
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:06,697
So enraged that she
vicariously seeks revenge

1266
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:09,800
Through any rape suspect?

1267
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,468
Well, the murder
victims in this case

1268
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:14,338
Are either rape dismissals
or rape attempts.

1269
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:16,106
And we have a list.

1270
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,342
But living or dead,
the names on that list

1271
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:20,745
Can only be accessed through
the Police Department.

1272
01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:22,379
So question.

1273
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:24,314
Could Jenny have done it?

1274
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:28,285
Well, given sufficient
cause and sufficient motive,

1275
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:31,756
I mean, anybody is capable
of doing the unthinkable.

1276
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:35,425
But as you know yourself,
I think you and Jennifer

1277
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,661
Are suffering from
some degree of, uh,

1278
01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:41,498
Post-traumatic shock syndrome.

1279
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:44,368
And Jennifer's depressed
and understandably so.

1280
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:46,703
But is she a murderer?

1281
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:49,306
In my opinion, no.

1282
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:51,608
This tape was made a month ago.

1283
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:55,145
It's an interrogation that
Jennifer did of a rape suspect.

1284
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,714
And after this,
she came to see me.

1285
01:01:57,815 --> 01:01:59,950
And I think you'll see why.

1286
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,919
PHIL (ON TV): Mr. Thomas,
let's start again.

1287
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,654
Did you or did you not on
the night of December 2

1288
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:06,991
Take Molly Tills to your
apartment and rape her?

1289
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:09,126
Did you not then
shortly thereafter slice

1290
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,695
Her throat with a hacksaw?

1291
01:02:11,796 --> 01:02:13,097
Go fuck yourself, pig.

1292
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:15,900
That's not going to
help us, Mr. Thomas.

1293
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,367
Now we have witnesses
attesting to the fact

1294
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:18,869
That they saw you leaving
the shopping center

1295
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:21,005
Where you met the victim.

1296
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:22,506
We also have witnesses
attesting to the fact

1297
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:24,274
They saw you entering your
apartment [inaudible].

1298
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:25,876
JENNIFER (ON TV): We also
have the murder weapon

1299
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,778
With your fingerprints on it.

1300
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,679
MR. THOMAS (ON TV): All right.

1301
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,515
I fucked her.

1302
01:02:31,615 --> 01:02:33,383
I fucked her good.

1303
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,719
I fucked her till she screamed.

1304
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:38,122
You see, I like to
hear them scream.

1305
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:43,660
And then I sliced the
little fucking bitch up.

1306
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,529
Is that what you wanted
to hear, Detective?

1307
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:46,496
Huh?

1308
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,833
Are you happy now, Detective?

1309
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,234
You sick fuck.

1310
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,837
Do you want me to fuck you in
the asshole, huh? [Inaudible].

1311
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:54,204
Cool down.

1312
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:56,040
PHIL (ON TV): A little girl,
knowing she was going to die.

1313
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,208
MR. THOMAS (ON TV): You bastard.

1314
01:02:58,308 --> 01:02:59,409
He fucking could
have killed me, OK?

1315
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,577
JENNIFER (ON TV): I know.

1316
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:02,012
But I must admit.

1317
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,214
A part of me wanted him too.

1318
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:05,215
Fuck you.

1319
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:06,016
Get him out of here.

1320
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,017
MR. THOMAS (ON TV): Fuck you.

1321
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:10,420
Fucking suck my dick,
you fucking pig.

1322
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,723
Jennifer has a lot a
rage, but despite that,

1323
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:15,692
She showed a lot of restraint.

1324
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,094
And tell the truth.

1325
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:20,030
Didn't you want Officer
Stations to pull that trigger?

1326
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:20,831
Yes.

1327
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,903
Doctor, as Jennifer's
psychiatrist,

1328
01:03:26,003 --> 01:03:29,073
Would you say that you have
her complete confidence?

1329
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:31,708
Look, I'm confident that
Jennifer's told me everything

1330
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,777
To do with her depression, yes.

1331
01:03:33,878 --> 01:03:36,280
Then would you say,
in your expert opinion,

1332
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,883
That Jenny has forgiven
me for Tina's death?

1333
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:41,351
DR. CARL STEINER: Absolutely.

1334
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:46,123
This is your fault.
This is all your fault.

1335
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:49,726
OFFICER (ON TV): Look,
Jennifer is not your killer.

1336
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,163
You're going to have to find
yourself another suspect.

1337
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:54,164
Thank you.

1338
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:07,077
The landlord let me in.

1339
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,046
Jenny.

1340
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:10,547
Don't.

1341
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:13,517
Don't say anything, not now.

1342
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:26,897
I'm going to kill him.

1343
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,568
I'm going to kill all of them.

1344
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:32,369
Don't.

1345
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:41,445
She was only 10, Jack,
just 10 years old.

1346
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:44,781
I love you, daddy.

1347
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:53,657
This is your fault.
This is all your fault.

1348
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:56,126
And I'm never going
to forgive you, Jack.

1349
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:03,867
I love you, daddy.

1350
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,808
Goodbye, my love.

1351
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,539
[Engine starts]

1352
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:17,374
Christ.

1353
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,850
Bitch.

1354
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,356
What the hell are you doing?

1355
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,262
Shit.

1356
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,764
[Phone ringing]

1357
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:17,901
Yeah?

1358
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:20,704
We got a positive ID
on the driver, Jack.

1359
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:22,106
It was Susan Treadwell.

1360
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:23,307
Jesus.

1361
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:26,076
You sure work in Rape
long enough, you go nuts.

1362
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:29,146
Yeah, I guess.

1363
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:30,046
Thanks, Phil.

1364
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:46,663
Trish.

1365
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:47,697
I know.

1366
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:51,135
It was Susan who was
killed in the car.

1367
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:55,071
They called me a
few minutes ago.

1368
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:57,507
She killed her.

1369
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,409
Oh, honey, it was an accident.

1370
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:01,145
And you're still trying
to protect her, aren't you?

1371
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:02,946
You still love her that much?

1372
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:05,282
Honey, it was an accident.

1373
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:06,950
Susan came after me.

1374
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,118
You can't blame Jenny for...

1375
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:09,253
Like hell I can't.

1376
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:13,390
Can't you see what she's
doing, what she's done?

1377
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,392
Listen, Susan
accessed that file, OK?

1378
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:17,527
She killed those men.

1379
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,729
She must've panicked when she
knew I was coming too close,

1380
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:20,730
And she came after me.

1381
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,599
That and she hated me.

1382
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:24,168
Why?

1383
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:25,569
Look, she thought
that I was using

1384
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:28,605
You to get closer to Jenny.

1385
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:30,607
The mutilations
and the killings.

1386
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:34,378
She had set that
up to set Jenny up,

1387
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:37,647
And she also knew that
I still loved Jenny.

1388
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:38,848
- No.
- Yes.

1389
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:39,649
Listen to me.

1390
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,117
Listen.

1391
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:42,219
I opened her file.

1392
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,321
Susan was raped at age
16, and you knew it.

1393
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:45,289
She was.

1394
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:46,990
She hated all men.

1395
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,392
She did.

1396
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,427
Every man except the one
she was going to marry.

1397
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:52,696
He was supposed to be
different, except he wasn't.

1398
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,531
He was a cop, and he
had a coke problem.

1399
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,533
And one night two years
ago, he came after her,

1400
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,102
And he tried to rape her,
and she shot him with a .38.

1401
01:08:59,203 --> 01:09:00,204
Didn't she?
No.

1402
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:01,305
Yes.

1403
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:03,240
Toxicology came back
with the blood samples.

1404
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,274
Final exhibits, Trish.

1405
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:05,275
Look.

1406
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,843
Jenny was right.

1407
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,145
Our murderer wore a blonde wig.

1408
01:09:09,246 --> 01:09:09,913
No!

1409
01:09:14,218 --> 01:09:14,918
Don't, Jack.

1410
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:24,361
I'm pretty good with a .38.

1411
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:27,864
Pretty good with a .38?

1412
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:29,833
Oh, god.

Phil, where are you?

1422
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:50,747
Outside of Munson's warehouse.

01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:52,749

last guy on our list?

a word with you?

a fucking piss here.

Phil, listen to me.

1432

Susan Treadwell wasn't our perp.

Yeah, I know.

1434

checking myself.

01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:13,930
WOMAN: You shouldn't
have come, Phil.

1447
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:14,931
Oh, no.

1448
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:32,248
Jack.

1449
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,049
Phil.

1450
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:34,718
It's not fair, Jack.

1451
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:36,219
It's not fair.

1452
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:37,286
Who did this?

1453
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:40,390
I wanted to see the baby.

1454
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,625
It's not fair.

1455
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:44,428
Who did this, Phil?

1456
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:48,064
Take care of Gwen,
Jack, and the baby.

1457
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:49,599
Promise?

1458
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,601
Yeah, I promise.

1459
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,604
Phil, who did this?

1460
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,407
I... it was her.

1461
01:12:57,507 --> 01:12:59,709
It was...

1462
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:02,211
Who, Phil?

1463
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,379
Oh.

1464
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,180
Phil.

1465
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:10,153
[Gunshots]

1466
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:20,597
Shit.

1467
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:30,039
Oh, fuck this.

1468
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:41,951
JENNIFER: Jack, stay down!

1469
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:46,122
Jennifer!
JENNIFER: It's Trish.

1470
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:46,923
She killed Phil.

1471
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:48,424
TRISH: She's lying.

1472
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:49,926
She just fired at you, Jack.

1473
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:51,394
She wants you to
believe it's me.

1474
01:13:51,495 --> 01:13:52,395
For God's sakes.

1475
01:13:52,496 --> 01:13:53,597
JENNIFER: She killed
them all, Jack.

1476
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:55,431
That's what I was
doing tonight, running

1477
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:57,601
A search on the computer.

1478
01:13:57,701 --> 01:14:00,737
I found Trish's log-on.

1479
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:03,039
She killed the men who
had raped only children

1480
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:06,142
Or juveniles to make it look
like my own personal vendetta.

1481
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:07,276
TRISH: No!

1482
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:08,545
JENNIFER: She thought
that if she framed me,

1483
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:10,647
She could get rid of me,
and you would love her.

1484
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:12,115
TRISH: Jack, don't
listen to her.

1485
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:13,049
She's a liar.

1486
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:14,484
[Gunshot]

1487
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:15,919
Fucking shit.
TRISH: Stay down.

1488
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:16,986
She's firing.

1489
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,087
JENNIFER: He doesn't
believe that, Trish.

1490
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,422
He knows the truth.

1491
01:14:19,523 --> 01:14:20,824
TRISH: Jack, listen.

1492
01:14:20,924 --> 01:14:21,958
I didn't kill anyone.

1493
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:24,427
Yes, I love you, but I
wouldn't hurt anyone.

1494
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:25,595
JENNIFER: It's not
her fault, Jack.

1495
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:26,395
She's sick.

1496
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:28,364
TRISH: Fuck you, you bitch.

1497
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,366
JENNIFER: Her file... I read it.

1498
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,335
She's been raped too,
just like her sister.

1499
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:33,837
TRISH: Please, Jack.

1500
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:34,804
You have to believe me.

1501
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:37,774
[Gunshots]

1502
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:40,209
Both of you show
yourselves, Jack.

1503
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,645
TRISH: She's got me in
her crossfire, Jack,

1504
01:14:41,745 --> 01:14:43,446
Just like she does you.

1505
01:14:43,547 --> 01:14:44,814
Come out with
your weapons down.

1506
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:46,783
TRISH: She lied to you, Jack.

1507
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:48,384
JENNIFER: I will if she will.

1508
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,185
All right.

1509
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:49,953
I'm coming out.

1510
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:56,192
Both of you, up.

1511
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:58,027
Up now.

1512
01:14:58,127 --> 01:14:58,962
First one who moves, I drop.

1513
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:10,506
Kill her, Jack.

1514
01:15:10,607 --> 01:15:12,241
If not or me, then for Phil.

1515
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,510
If I drop the
gun, she's got me.

1516
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:17,280
Jack, the wig, that .38.

1517
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,081
That's bullshit.

1518
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:19,583
Those weren't Susan's.

1519
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:20,383
Of course not, Trish.

1520
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:21,417
They were yours.

1521
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,119
Jack, she put them
in the apartment.

1522
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:24,888
She planned the whole thing.

1523
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,690
I did some digging, Jack.

1524
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:30,860
That first night, two
murders, Adams and Callister.

1525
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,461
Trish came to your
house at 12:00 midnight,

1526
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:33,262
Didn't she, Jack?

1527
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:38,001
Yeah, I know.

1528
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:39,836
It's my job.

1529
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:43,973
Anyway, Adams was
found at 10:30 PM.

1530
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:46,943
ME put the time of
death at 10:00 PM.

1531
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:51,014
But Trish went back to your
house to give herself an alibi.

1532
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:52,849
Callister's TOD was 2:30 AM.

1533
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:55,151
Now you tell me, Jack.

1534
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:57,420
Did she spend the whole night?

1535
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,221
Jesus Christ, Jack.

1536
01:15:58,321 --> 01:16:00,156
She knows about us.

1537
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:01,090
She's spying on us.

1538
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,525
Put the gun down, Trish.

1539
01:16:02,626 --> 01:16:03,326
It's over.

1540
01:16:07,731 --> 01:16:09,332
Jack.

1541
01:16:09,432 --> 01:16:10,133
Look out, Jack!

1542
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:11,134
No, Trish.

1543
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:16,139
Ugh.

1544
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,312
[Screaming]

1545
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,113
No!

1546
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:47,570
[Sobbing]

1547
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:00,116
LT. MEADOWS:
Christ, what a mess.

1548
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:04,553
Two crazy sisters, both cops,
both psychotic murderers.

1549
01:17:04,654 --> 01:17:06,222
IA's going to love this one.

1550
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:09,993
Starting tonight, both
of you, on vacation.

1551
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:12,428
Jack, go home.

1552
01:17:12,528 --> 01:17:14,397
This time, I mean it.

1553
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:29,078
What is it?

1554
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:31,047
Trish.

1555
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,983
I still can't believe
that she did it.

1556
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:34,951
I just can't buy it.

1557
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:42,391
Sometimes the unbelievable
is what we have to believe,

1558
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,860
No matter how much it hurts.

1559
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:49,799
See you.

1560
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:04,580
JACK: Care to give me
Trish's modus operandi?

1561
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,083
JENNIFER: I told you I
had some explaining to do.

1562
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,617
JACK: Shoot.

1563
01:18:08,718 --> 01:18:10,653
JENNIFER: She loved
you, Jack, and she

1564
01:18:10,754 --> 01:18:12,655
Wanted me out of the way.

1565
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:14,791
She compiles her list of
rape attempts, all of which

1566
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:17,526
Resemble Tina's case,
and she goes to work.

1567
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:21,130
She knows the files
are open only to LAPD.

1568
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,499
The finger points at me.

1569
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:25,634
JACK: Why the mutilation aspect?

1570
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:27,871
JENNIFER: She was
raped once, Jack.

1571
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,939
So was her sister.

1572
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:33,977
The castrations were a personal
vindication against all men.

1573
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:35,311
JACK: But she loved me.

1574
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:36,179
And I'm...

1575
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:38,114
JENNIFER: A man.

1576
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,082
Yeah.

1577
01:18:39,182 --> 01:18:40,917
I know.

1578
01:18:41,017 --> 01:18:43,753
You're a man, but you're a man
who, in a way, shared a pain

1579
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:48,057
As horrible as Trish's,
the loss of a child,

1580
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:53,529
Of the child within,
the loss of innocence.

1581
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,486
I love you.

1582
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,487
I love you, too.

1583
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:38,942
[Sighs]

1584
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:13,776
Jenny?

1585
01:20:13,877 --> 01:20:16,345
Hmm?

1586
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:19,715
Can you forgive me?

1587
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:20,850
Can you ever forgive me?

1588
01:20:24,888 --> 01:20:26,856
No, Jack, I can't.

1589
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:30,894
But I have a kind of revenge,
and I can live with that.

1590
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:32,261
Revenge?

1591
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:34,597
Revenge against who?

1592
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:36,499
Him.

1593
01:20:36,599 --> 01:20:37,466
Tina's killer.

1594
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:43,239
You.

1595
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:47,276
Yeah, you.

1596
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:48,945
You see, Jack.

1597
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:52,581
I know you really
cared for Trish.

1598
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:57,853
And she really loved you,
all the way to the end.

1599
01:20:57,954 --> 01:21:03,526
Jenny, can I ask you a
question, hypothetically?

1600
01:21:03,626 --> 01:21:05,895
Shoot.

1601
01:21:05,995 --> 01:21:08,864
What if it wasn't Trish
who killed all those people?

1602
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:12,468
Adams, Callister, Munson, Phil.

1603
01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:15,204
What if it was someone else?

1604
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:18,107
Then an innocent
woman died for nothing.

1605
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,443
But Trish tried to kill
me in the warehouse.

1606
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:21,844
Yeah.

1607
01:21:21,945 --> 01:21:25,748
It did look like that.

1608
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:32,355
But it is possible that she was
just turning to you to plead

1609
01:21:32,455 --> 01:21:38,594
With you for you to
believe her, and you

1610
01:21:38,694 --> 01:21:41,397
Reacted exactly as
you should have,

1611
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:47,070
Thinking she was
turning to fire.

1612
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:51,040
You saw her gun come
up, and you shop first.

1613
01:21:56,545 --> 01:22:01,850
I think it worked
out for the best.

1614
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:04,153
Oh, Jenny, you don't
mean that, do you?

1615
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,022
You see, Jack.

1616
01:22:06,122 --> 01:22:08,591
That's my revenge.

1617
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:12,028
You get to wonder
if I do or not.

1618
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:18,934
JACK (VOICEOVER): There are
some things worse than death.

1619
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:23,006
Perhaps knowing too
much is one of them.
