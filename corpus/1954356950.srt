00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,504
Times like this, there's
only one place I wanna be.

174
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,925
Go call her.

175
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,403
Have fun.

176
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,930
Wish me luck.

177
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,946
Ain't happening, Soto. Keep your
dick away from me. Shut it, Li.

178
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:40,113
(TYPING)

179
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:42,591
HEATHER: <i>Hi.</i>

180
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:45,177
Hi, baby. How you doing?

181
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:48,288
<i>I'm okay. I'm just
doing some laundry.</i>

182
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:50,265
<i>I didn't expect you to call.</i>

183
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,670
No, I know.
I just wanted to say hi.

184
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,941
<i>Hi. Everything okay?</i>

185
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:02,135
Yeah. I just really
wanted to hear your voice.

186
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,321
How's our little lady doing?

187
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:05,530
(CHUCKLES)

188
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:08,684
<i>She's been jumping on my
bladder, but we're doing good.</i>

189
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:12,454
<i>Wow, I've really missed you.</i>

190
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,956
<i>You sure everything's okay?</i>

191
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:15,315
Yeah, I'm good now.

192
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,151
<i>Okay.</i>

193
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:20,837
<i>Did you send that letter yet?</i>

194
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:22,422
<i>Have you told them
you're not re-enlisting?</i>

195
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:23,507
Mmm-mmm.

196
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:28,120
Not yet. Don't worry, baby.
I'll do it. I love you.

197
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,247
<i>I love you, too.</i>

198
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:41,383
JONES: Okay, Marines,
fire when ready!

199
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:50,976
(WHOOPS)

200
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,173
Hey, bud, what's the good word?

201
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:06,783
Yeah, we're getting
a new sergeant?

202
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,010
Yup.

203
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,787
Word is Davidson from over
at Fox Trot's coming over.

204
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:13,140
No, that's not happening.

205
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,205
Can you tell us who it is?

206
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:15,517
Yeah, who's the FNG?

207
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:16,877
Fucking new guy, buddy.

208
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:20,422
Seriously, the last thing we
need is some uptight asshole.

209
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,383
Okay, come on.
Tell us who it is.

210
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:25,886
It's me.

211
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:28,655
Say what?
What?

212
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,474
No way.
You? Get outta here.

213
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:32,809
I'm sorry, man.

214
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:36,063
Hey, if it wasn't me,
it was you.

215
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:39,191
So you down for being
my alpha team leader?

216
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:44,988
Hell yeah. A-slash gets the
girls, shoots the bad guys.

217
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,425
Squad leader does the paperwork.

218
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,760
Shit.

219
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:50,886
(ALL LAUGHING)

220
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:52,012
That's actually true.

221
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:54,164
LI: Right?
Right.

222
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:56,183
Wow.

223
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,768
Nothing changes, guys.

224
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,394
Everything changes, man.

225
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:00,645
I can't give you shit anymore.

226
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,897
I love givin' you shit.

227
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:03,423
Soto, you can
still give me shit.

228
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,300
I can just bust
your ass for it now.

229
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:07,235
(ALL LAUGHING)

230
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,361
SOTO: That's cute.

231
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,555
Well, we said we didn't want
an uptight asshole.

232
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,099
Yeah, at least he's not uptight.

233
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,244
Very funny. No, you guys
should really laugh it up.

234
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,329
Because once I get my stripes,

235
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:18,874
you guys are just
pushing all day long.

236
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:20,040
(ALL LAUGHING)

237
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:21,108
MERRIMETTE: Hard.

238
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,569
Crew, back to
marksmanship training.

239
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,505
I need the best damn
squad in the Corps.

240
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,406
SOTO: Oh, yeah.
LI: I'll remember that.

241
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:30,092
SOTO: One, two...

242
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,802
ALLEN: Hey, Soto, do you
actually have a penis?

243
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:33,667
MERRIMETTE: All the way down.
All the way down.

244
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:47,008
Easy on the ammo, Danni.
Just in case.

245
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,070
Just in case what?

246
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,763
Just in case
you animals piss me off.

247
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:55,433
I'm a gear queer.
What can I say?

248
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:57,410
You're a toolbox.
That's what I can say.

249
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:58,436
Yeah, but I look good.

250
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,022
You're all right.
ALLEN: Don't deny it.

251
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:04,693
Good afternoon, sirs!
All right, listen up!

252
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:08,363
Stand easy.

253
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,342
You'll be transporting
supplies to Forward

254
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,203
Ops Base Ouellette in
the Garmsir District.

255
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:18,306
Those poor people have been
taking beaucoup casualties.

256
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,642
They need to get
resupplied ASAP.

257
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,170
Now this is definitely
outside the Green Zone.

258
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,314
So watch your corners,
keep your head on a swivel.

259
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,968
LEDs, HMEs, ambushes, whatever.

260
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:31,803
Questions?

261
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,431
Are we taking route 605, sir?

262
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:37,242
Affirmative. It's a
straight shot 75 clicks,

263
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,352
then a hard
right under Route Red.

264
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:40,886
(SOFTLY) We're totally fucked.

265
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:46,126
Son. This is Private
Khalid Hassan Abu Faisal.

266
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:50,005
He's with the Afghan National Army.
He's joining the squad.

267
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,464
KETTNER: Muji motherfucker.

268
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:54,034
You got a problem with that,
Corporal Kettner?

269
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,120
No, sir!
That's good.

270
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:59,915
This is part of
the drawdown handoff.

271
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:04,227
Private Faisal has received the same
training as every one of you has,

272
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:08,106
so he deserves your
cooperation and your respect.

273
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:09,549
Would you agree
with that, Corporal?

274
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,611
Yes, sir!
That's fine.

275
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,513
All right, Marines, you stay
safe, get the job done.

276
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:18,350
They're all yours,
squadron leader.

277
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:19,851
Thank you, sir.

278
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:21,519
Oorah, sir.

279
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,023
All right, Marines, top up your ammo.
Let's get ready to roll.

280
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,734
Faisal. Corporal Merrimette.

281
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:30,712
Thank you. You'll be riding
with Corporal Kettner.

282
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:34,299
You ride in the back.
Go ahead, man.

283
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:35,909
Go ahead. Go.
You speak English?

284
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:37,744
Easy, Kett.

285
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:40,555
Let's go. Show time.

286
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,833
All right, Li. You look stupid.
Thanks.

287
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,085
(GRUNTING)

288
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:47,796
Corporal!

289
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,423
What's up, A-slash?

290
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:53,568
You really gonna
let him have a gun?

291
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:55,011
They let you have one, don't they?

292
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:58,181
You really want him to be armed?

293
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:02,143
I don't know.
Let's find out.

294
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,980
Private Faisal?
What are you doin', man?

295
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,649
Can I have a minute
of your time, please?

296
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,084
Yes, sir.

297
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,295
Uh, Private, uh,
Corporal Kettner here

298
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,423
is concerned that you may
be a terrorist in disguise

299
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:17,759
and you're planning
on killing all of us.

300
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:20,120
Now, do you have
any plans like that?

301
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,166
I have no plans to harm
anyone in this unit, sir.

302
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,130
Thank you, Private.
Carry on. Sir.

303
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:35,193
You happy now?

304
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,469
Do I look happy?

305
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:39,139
You never look happy.
Come on, let's roll.

306
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:42,017
(EXHALES) This is some bullshit.
Hey, Corporal.

307
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:43,827
MERRIMETTE: Hey, Lance Corporal.

308
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:44,953
Now that you're a top dog,

309
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:47,038
can you put in for
a new transport vehicle?

310
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:48,857
Yeah, man, we're tired of
getting army hand-me-downs.

311
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:50,458
Look... (TAPS VEHICLE)

312
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:53,295
This has got up-armor,
a 10-foot whip.

313
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,130
Hmm. I love it
when you talk dirty.

314
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:56,156
I know you do.

315
00:17:56,823 --> 00:18:00,452
If only I weren't married. And you
weren't so obviously a lesbian.

316
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:01,953
Is it that obvious?

317
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,888
Is it really that obvious?

318
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:05,874
All right, let's get
ready to roll, Marines!

319
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:07,159
I still think I can turn you.

320
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,835
ALLEN: Not a fucking
chance, Soto.

321
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,657
Remember those days,
rollin' out in force

322
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:24,392
with your M16
and a full set of balls?

323
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:26,995
Smokin' and jokin'.

324
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,330
Good old days.

325
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:30,774
Yes, sir. Well, it's
a young man's game.

326
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,185
Keep your hands off my porn!

327
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,770
MARINE: I'd rather
keep my hands on you!

328
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:54,814
I'll say hi to your wife.

00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:06,101
Systems check, Corporal.
Blue force tracker?

Check.
Green comm?

332
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:11,564
On it.

333
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:15,360
Thunder Ops, yeah.

334
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:17,821
This is Gunmetal 2-5.

335
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:20,573
System check. Over.

Chocolate chip.
Chocolate chip.

Chocolate chip,
only if it's baked hard.

342
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,419
I heard you like it hard.

Sushi!

Can you take him?

In perfect conditions, if we
were 300 meters closer, maybe.

All right, so what do we do?

876

Get 300 meters closer.

That would be choice number one,

878
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:23,378

miss, we're in the same boat.

What's up?

1079
01:09:22,773 --> 01:09:24,859
Can I get one of those chais?

that he was a true friend to the village.

He is curious about the package and
wondering if she is our prisoner.

01:09:53,554 --> 01:09:54,680
No.

1090
01:09:58,601 --> 01:10:00,603
FAISAL: She is
Afghani national, yes?

1091
01:10:00,936 --> 01:10:02,188
Yeah.

1092
01:10:11,655 --> 01:10:13,783
FAISAL: Then why does
she travel with us?

1093
01:10:14,408 --> 01:10:17,219
That question's
above my pay grade.

1094
01:10:17,244 --> 01:10:19,580
I just need to get her out
of here and back to base.

1095
01:10:19,914 --> 01:10:21,974
He is saying she is safe here.

1096

Tell him I have my orders.

1097

FAISAL: He has his also. What the
hell's that supposed to mean?

1098
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:38,282
FAISAL: Because she is Afghani
national and not our prisoner,

1099
01:10:38,307 --> 01:10:40,451
he must seek permission
from the provincial commander

1100
01:10:40,476 --> 01:10:43,329
before he can allow us
to leave with her.

1101
01:10:43,354 --> 01:10:46,482
All right. Let him know that
we're running out of time.

1102
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:49,668
Time. We need to
get this done now.

1103
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:53,547

All this goddamned technology,

1108
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:03,624
all this manpower,
we cannot locate five marines?

1109
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:06,310
Perfect storm of bad
stuff happening, sir.

1110
01:11:06,335 --> 01:11:10,731
They got ambushed, marine comms go
down, sandstorm between them and us.

1111
01:11:10,756 --> 01:11:12,733
Well, what about
the air on station?

1112
01:11:12,758 --> 01:11:14,235
Do we have any direct support?

I got a Humvee column rollin'
outta FOB Keenan now, sir.

1116
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:22,910
Keenan?
That's Royal Irish Regiment?

01:11:22,935 --> 01:11:24,078

01:11:24,103 --> 01:11:26,539
We goddamned better hope for a
little luck of the Irish here.

1119
01:11:26,564 --> 01:11:29,044
They're on the other side of the
sandstorm and they got access.

1120
01:11:29,066 --> 01:11:32,086
Now you're telling me that this
is our best worst option, right?

1121
01:11:32,111 --> 01:11:33,838
I'm afraid so.

1122
01:11:33,863 --> 01:11:37,258
I do have some actual intel on who's the
package that they're traveling with.

1123
01:11:37,283 --> 01:11:38,509
Talk to me.

1124
01:11:38,534 --> 01:11:40,177
Her name is Anoosh Hassan.

1125
01:11:40,202 --> 01:11:42,888
Anoosh Hassan?
I know the name. Who is she?

1126
01:11:42,913 --> 01:11:44,056
It's a women's rights' activist.

1127
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:45,474
She's a real hero to the
people in the provinces.

She's a beacon of hope.

1129
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:48,310
The Taliban wants her dead, sir.

1130
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:49,895
And Washington wants her alive.

1131
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,647
Yup. She's good PR.

1132
01:11:51,672 --> 01:11:55,676
She's good PR. You know
what's bad PR in my book?

1133
01:11:55,885 --> 01:11:58,470
Dead marines are bad PR.

1134
01:11:58,762 --> 01:12:00,573
She's a keynote speaker
at the United Nations

1135
01:12:00,598 --> 01:12:02,449

on Human Rights.

1136
01:12:02,474 --> 01:12:04,768
She's scheduled to be
in New York in 36 hours.

1137
01:12:04,977 --> 01:12:07,788
That's direct from Washington. She's
the president's guest of honor.

1138
01:12:07,813 --> 01:12:11,317
And she's with our marines?
Yes, sir.

Only one place.
To Mullah Nafiz.

1240
01:20:59,845 --> 01:21:02,222
She will be stoned at dawn.
