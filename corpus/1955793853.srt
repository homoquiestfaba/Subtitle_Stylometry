1
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,594
If you were to ask the five

2
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,071
best filmmakers in
the world right now

3
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:55,024
to make a movie like this...

4
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,226
it...

5
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,078
it wouldn't even be
in the same universe.

6
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:00,282
I was blown away.

7
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:02,062
Like, like three minutes into it,
I figure this is

8
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:03,986
the fucking greatest movie
I've ever seen in my life.

9
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:08,133
It has withstood, like
ten years?

10
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:11,275
And people are still watching a
movie and talking about a movie.

11
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,419
People aren't doing that about

12
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:15,036
whatever won the Oscar for
best picture ten years ago.

13
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:16,849
What genius is behind this?

14
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:17,905
Tommy wanted to break

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,756
Tommy wanted to break
barriers in filmmaking.

16
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,335
I think that he had a
very clear vision.

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,125
He is a figure of mystery
where, you know,

18
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,625
you do wanna learn
more about him.

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,500
Who is this man?
Who is this auteur?

20
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:29,932
The kind of sheer ambition of it...

21
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,119
is...

22
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:32,861
is in-incredible.

23
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:35,097
The numbers probably prove

24
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:38,347
how unlikely it is
that you'll make it.

25
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:39,231
If I had a time machine,

26
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:41,990
I wouldn't go do a
bunch of stu-- uh,

27
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:44,975
stuff you-- I would go back
and try and

28
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:48,975
get on that set just to watch
and feel what it was like

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,475
'cause it has to be...

30
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:51,742
unbelievable.

31
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:03,954
Subs by enwansix

32
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:07,340
We'll hang ourselves tomorrow.

33
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:10,456
Unless 'Gah-dow' comes.

34
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:13,457
And, and if he comes?

35
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:14,910
We'll be saved.

36
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:16,137
Well?

37
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,614
S-shall we go?

38
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,617
Pull on your trousers.

39
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:25,242
What?

40
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,070
Pull on your trousers.

41
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:29,756
You want me to
pull off my trousers?

42
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:32,013
No, I want you to stop.
Stop.

43
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:35,689
Jesus, that was <i>painfully</i>
unremarkable.

44
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:38,057
Rob, y-you're like a robot.

45
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:38,573
Yeah.

46
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:39,621
And it's <i>God</i>-oh.

47
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:40,184
Sorry.

48
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:42,519
And Greg...
you were so scared

49
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:44,455
and so insecure.

50
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,488
you're like a-like a
wounded puppy.

51
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:49,169
Do you even
<i>want</i> to be an actor?

52
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:51,302
Yeah, m-more than anything.

53
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:54,998
Okay, well, it must be a big secret
because I can't tell at all.

54
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:57,972
You've been coming to class
for about two months now?

55
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,535
And um...

56
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,973
You need to-
to loosen up, and relax!

57
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:05,800
You've got to really
just expose yourself

58
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:07,715
or no one's ever gonna care.

59
00:03:07,748 --> 00:03:08,818
Okay, Greg?

60
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:09,593
Yeah, okay.

61
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:10,740
Okay. Thank you.

62
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:17,261
Okay, who here can <i>really</i>
reveal themselves to the class?

63
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,199
Anybody?

64
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
I go.

65
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:23,808
Great.

66
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,355
What do you have for
us today, Thomas?

67
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:27,574
It Tommy.

68
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:29,019
Always Tommy.

69
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:30,777
You, come on with this scene.

70
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:32,535
Okay.

71
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:42,962
What are we doing?

72
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,001
Do you know--?

73
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:46,743
Just go with it.

74
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:56,842
Stella...

75
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,423
Stella...

76
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,448
Stella!

77
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,564
Stella!

78
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,436
Stella!

79
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,537
Stella!

80
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:21,029
Stella!

81
00:04:29,117 --> 00:04:30,188
Stella.

82
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:32,141
Stella!

83
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,688
Stella!

84
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:36,873
Stella!

85
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:40,342
Stella!

86
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:48,510
Don't ever leave me, baby.

87
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:51,028
Uh...

88
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:53,426
Thank you. For. That.

89
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:56,848
Uh, hey!

90
00:04:58,434 --> 00:04:59,879
Uh, e-excuse me...

91
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,879
Tommy?

92
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:05,457
Hey.

93
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:07,793
Um, I'm-I'm Greg.

94
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:09,637
Yah.

95
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:11,348
I see you in there.

96
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,106
Um, I was-I was just

97
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:15,910
wondering if you maybe wanted
to do a scene together.

98
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,531
You wanna do scene with me?

99
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:21,758
Yeah.

100
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:25,899
Okay.

101
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:29,711
Okay.

102
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:31,774
No blitzing!

103
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,899
- Pass!
- Hit it, hit it!

104
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:34,853
Yeah! Come on, boy!

105
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,564
Uh-huh! What you got?

106
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,510
Oh, hey, hey, car, car,
sidewalk, sidewalk.

107
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:39,370
Come here!

108
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,027
Yeah!

109
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:42,933
Hey, ju- uh,
give me a second, guys.

110
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:45,237
Hey.

111
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:48,441
All your friend little kid?

112
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,816
Yeah, nah, I was-
I was just waitin' for you.

113
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:52,137
Okay, get in.

114
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:54,247
Oh, I-I thought we were just
gonna do it at my place?

115
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:55,741
No, I have to eat.

116
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,186
Don't worry, I know great place,
you'll love it.

117
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,725
Oh, okay.

118
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:01,178
And bring football.

119
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:01,866
Sure.

120
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:03,740
All right, I'm gonna-
I'm gonna go, guys.

121
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:04,881
I'll see you guys later.

122
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:09,233
Nice car.

123
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:11,281
Why you pullin'?

124
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:14,437
No, just, you know, none of my
friends have a car this nice.

125
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:16,478
'Cause all your
friend little kid.

126
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,251
You know, I
just mean it's expensive,

127
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,539
It's nice,
that'-that's all.

128
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:22,002
Don't talk about me.

129
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:23,159
Do what?

130
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:24,745
What I drive.

131
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,464
What I say, what I do.

132
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:28,173
Don't tell anybody.

133
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:29,511
You understand, yeah?

134
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,067
Yeah. No, I-I won't.

135
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:31,918
'Kay.

136
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:34,121
And don't look at robot crab.

137
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:35,217
He's shy.

138
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:38,688
Bye, little kids.

139
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:43,563
So.

140
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:45,759
Why you bring me here?

141
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,985
Wh-what do you mean?

142
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:49,579
Scene partner.

143
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,048
That joke?

144
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:52,017
No, not at all.

145
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,227
Then what, Greg?

146
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:54,712
I don't see point.

147
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,389
Okay, um.

148
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,850
All right, listen, when um, when I...

149
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,131
When I get up on stage
in front of people...

150
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:04,553
It's like all I could
think about is uh...

151
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:06,287
"what if-what if they
laugh at me? Or

152
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:07,405
if I embarrass myself?"

153
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,108
Mm-hmm.

154
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,687
Um, but you, man,
you're like

155
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:10,875
fucking fearless!

156
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,726
And I just--
I-I wanna feel that too.

157
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:14,868
I just, I want--I want that.
- Okay.

158
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,744
I want what-
what you have

159
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,236
and I just--
I-I figured I could

160
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:20,206
I could learn something from you.
That's-that's it.

161
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,434
Oh, alright.

162
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:23,098
Yeah.

163
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,309
Let's do scene.

164
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:27,590
Oh, you wanna-
you wanna do a scene here?

165
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,669
Are you not dedicated actor?

166
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:30,873
I'm dedicated, I just, there,

167
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,530
you know, there's people eating,
I just don't--

168
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,247
I don't care about these people.

169
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,006
Come on, you have to do it.

170
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,748
Uh, okay, yeah.

171
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:39,772
I'll play the man,

172
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:40,959
"The Lightning Rod Man",

173
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:42,975
and you play this
other one with the Z.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,406
Uh, Zachariah, Zachariah.

175
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,586
-Yeah.
-Okay.

176
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,165
Good day, sir!

177
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:49,705
Um.

178
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:50,728
Good day.

179
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,673
Come on,
you have to be louder!

180
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,072
Tommy, it's just, I'm--

181
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:55,651
Don't worry about these people!

182
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,706
There only you
and there only me.

183
00:07:57,731 --> 00:07:59,105
Now do it.

184
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:00,448
Project!

185
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:01,292
Okay, okay.

186
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:02,659
Good day, sir!

187
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:04,130
Okay, uh, um.

188
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,083
Don't be weird.

189
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:06,059
-I'm, uh...
-Just do it.

190
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:07,512
I'm sorry, uh...

191
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:10,394
Uh, have I the honor,
a visit

192
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:11,637
from the illustrious

193
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,754
-god, Jupiter Tonans?
-Okay, that's good.

194
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:14,670
-Keep going!
-All right.

195
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,482
-It's great.
-Uh, so, uh...

196
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,278
So stood-stood he in-
in the Greek statue of old,

197
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:21,201
grasping the lightning bolt.

198
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:22,108
Yah?

199
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,023
-Uh, if you be he,
-What he do it?

200
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:26,406
or his viceroy, I-I have to

201
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:27,626
Okay, that good.

202
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:29,666
I have to thank you for
this noble storm you have

203
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:31,103
brewed among our mountains.

204
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:33,682
Okay, it's great.
Now, we're on top a mountain.

205
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,222
The rain pouring,
wind going...

206
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:37,918
Whoo-woo.

207
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:39,426
And the lightning, everything.

208
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:39,943
Okay.

209
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:41,779
A very fine rod!

210
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,014
I dare say!

211
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:46,584
And what are these
particular precautions of yours?!

212
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,803
Close yonder shutter!

213
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:51,273
The slanting rain
beating through!

214
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,625
Come on! Come on!

215
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,102
-All right, uh.
-Mountain top, right now!

216
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:56,548
Is rain, it wind going...

217
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,963
Are you-are you mad?

218
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:02,355
Uh, know you not that, uh, yon

219
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,769
yon iron bar is a
swift conductor?!

220
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:07,699
Pray, touch the bell,
pull there.

221
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:08,763
Uh.

222
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:10,725
Uh, are you frantic?

223
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,225
Are you frantic?

224
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,514
Never touch bell-wire
in a thunderstorm!

225
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:16,297
Oh, wow.

226
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,578
Nor ring a bell of any sort!

227
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,173
Wow!

228
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,798
How this guy?!

229
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,206
Wow!

230
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:23,940
Thank you.

231
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:26,278
Wow, everybody got lucky today.

232
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,278
You don't have to pay
for this performance.

233
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:30,505
Thank you. You're welcome.
Very much.

234
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:33,896
Tommy, that felt
fucking amazing, man!

235
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,967
There you go,
now you're acting, Greg.

236
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:38,937
I would like Shakespeare.

237
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:43,187
Whoa.

238
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,391
How uh, how often
you play football, Tommy?

239
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:48,008
I love football!

240
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:49,734
You love it?

241
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:51,797
It's nice to play.

242
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,125
Yeah, I agree.

243
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,094
Great American game.

244
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:56,867
Okay.

245
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,376
Got it here.

246
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:01,227
You ever been to
Los Angeles?

247
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:01,860
Yeah.

248
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:04,330
Yeah, yeah, once uh,
when I was little.

249
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:06,393
And my mom took me
down there.

250
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,409
It's like, best two
days of my life.

251
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,203
Los Angeles...

252
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:12,573
everybody want to be star.

253
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,038
All the pretty boys.

254
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:17,749
They're lining up
for the big shot.

255
00:10:17,812 --> 00:10:18,608
Just uh,

256
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,476
just have to get lucky,
I guess.

257
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:21,742
No.

258
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:23,968
No.

259
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,259
It's not luck, Greg.

260
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,423
Greg, you have to be the best.

261
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,650
You have to be
the best you can be.

262
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,126
And never give up.

263
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:36,118
Whoa.

264
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:38,650
What are you--what are we
doing here? What?

265
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:39,659
Okay.

266
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:41,666
All right.

267
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,197
Touchdown!

268
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,007
Touchdown!

269
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:48,120
-Touchdown!
-Touchdown!

270
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,944
This is a cool fucking
building, man.

271
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:52,124
How long have you lived here?

272
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,577
Must ask you again,
don't talk about me.

273
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:57,991
Not to class...
not to anybody.

274
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:59,211
Yeah, no, of course.

275
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:04,336
This is it.

276
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:11,139
Okay.

277
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,224
Come in.

278
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:17,442
Can go in there.

279
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:19,044
Maid on vacation.

280
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,825
Wha-?

281
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:29,084
Uh, Tommy, where uh,
where you from?

282
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:30,662
From New Orleans.

283
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,576
Oh, no, like, uh,
like originally?

284
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:35,140
Hey, that one, you know,
Louisiana.

285
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:37,047
Okay.

286
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,703
The accent threw me off.

287
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:40,031
What accent?

288
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:41,961
You want Redbull?

289
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:45,844
Thanks.

290
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,094
Wh-when was this taken?

291
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:49,437
Few years ago.

292
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:50,765
Really? You just...

293
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,375
You look so young in it.

294
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,758
Wow.

295
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:55,899
Look at that.
Don't be smart guy.

296
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:56,802
Oh, sorry, man.

297
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:58,350
Why don't you sit down, relax?

298
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,664
Yeah, yeah, no, that was...

299
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:00,914
my bad. I didn't mean to...

300
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,149
Looking all my stuff.

301
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:03,048
Yeah.

302
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:03,962
Sorry.

303
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:05,141
A little bit nosy guy.

304
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:05,869
Yeah.

305
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:16,815
Uh, so, uh, what-how'd
you get into acting?

306
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:18,534
Oh.

307
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:20,464
It always been dream.

308
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:21,836
Long time.

309
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:22,727
Yeah?

310
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:24,328
But I ignore it.

311
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:26,649
Then one day
I get into accident.

312
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:27,368
What happened?

313
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:28,719
Guy run red light.

314
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:29,525
And smash.

315
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,064
Whoa?

316
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:31,494
Very bad for Tommy.

317
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,143
I almost die.

318
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:35,134
But then I survive.

319
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,127
Whoa.

320
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:38,244
It was like, wake up call,
you could say.

321
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:39,244
Yeah, definitely.

322
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:41,971
After that, I stopped doing
all the other things.

323
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:43,284
And I...

324
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:45,058
go back to my dream.

325
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,442
And everybody say,
"you're such crazy guy.

326
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,919
you're so stupid guy."

327
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:50,364
I said, "I don't care."

328
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:51,162
I do it.

329
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:51,732
Yes.

330
00:12:51,757 --> 00:12:52,803
I know I can do it.

331
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:53,453
I get that.

332
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:54,719
With me,
everything changed with

333
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:55,735
<i>Home Alone.</i>

334
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,414
Oh, you...

335
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,500
you're home alone
long time?

336
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:02,289
Uh, the mov-the movie...

337
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,485
-the movie <i>Home Alone</i>?
-Ah, it's a movie.

338
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,180
Yeah.

339
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:06,432
With, uh, with Macaulay Culkin?

340
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:07,400
Okay.

341
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,049
Okay, um.

342
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:12,126
Yeah, so, anyway that movie,
it spoke to me, you know? It...

343
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,657
It changed my life and-
and ever since then, I just...

344
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:16,697
I've... just...

345
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:17,610
I get it.

346
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:19,337
You want to be star.

347
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:21,423
Yeah, I...

348
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:23,595
just wanted to be in the movies.

349
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,001
You know, Greg...

350
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:27,017
you and me,
we are the same.

351
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:28,964
Oh, yeah? How's-
how's that?

352
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,956
We both have this dream.

353
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:34,026
Yeah, I guess we do.

354
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:35,011
And...

355
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:36,651
for information...

356
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,739
I was 'home alone' too.

357
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,844
Except not movie,
in real life.

358
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,041
<i>Don't I buy you
everything you want?</i>

359
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,510
<i>A bicycle? You get a bicycle.</i>

360
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:50,667
<i>A car?</i>

361
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:51,606
<i>You buy me many things.</i>

362
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,378
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

363
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:53,926
<i>He bought me many things.</i>

364
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:56,520
<i>We give you love and
affection, don't we?</i>

365
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,826
<i>It's not a place for kids.</i>

366
00:13:57,851 --> 00:13:59,975
<i>A minute ago, you said
you didn't care if he drinks.</i>

367
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
<i>He said "a little drink."</i>

368
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:05,242
<i>You're tearing me apart!</i>

369
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:06,742
Oh, my God.

370
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,649
<i>You, you say one thing,
he says another...</i>

371
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:10,931
He's the best, I told you.

372
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:13,040
You're taking me apart!

373
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,744
"Tearing."
You're tearing me apart.

374
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,369
Yeah, he's emotion!

375
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,534
Moment to moment.
Not plastic.

376
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,120
I knew you'd like it, man.

377
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:21,692
You know,
you could be like Dean.

378
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:22,419
Me?

379
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,551
My God, you behind the schedule.

380
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:26,176
Listen to me, young man.

381
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,612
You have the gift,
you have the look.

382
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:29,451
Yeah.

383
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,467
Hey, if I can have a career in
this business, so can you, man.

384
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:33,428
Ah.

385
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,156
I don't want career.

386
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:36,859
You don't want a career?
I thought that's...

387
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:38,329
I want my own planet.

388
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,087
Uh, your own planet?

389
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,814
Yeah, it's cool,
everybody love each other.

390
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,948
That's why it's the best planet.

391
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:46,347
Sounds great!
Sounds ideal, really.

392
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,839
I have a present for you.

393
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,840
Welcome to my planet, Greg.

394
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:53,122
Oh, my God.

395
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,044
Yeah, yeah,
<i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>,

396
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,646
<i>East of Eden</i>, and <i>Giant.</i>
That's it.

397
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:58,327
Wow.

398
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:01,186
Yeah, three movies, and then
all of a sudden, he's dead.

399
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:02,836
-That's so crazy.
-Yeah.

400
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:03,759
-Tragedy.
-It is.

401
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:05,572
You know he died just a
little bit south of here?

402
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,502
I wanna go one day
to the crash site.

403
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:08,753
Pay my respects.

404
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,417
Why don't we go now?

405
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,909
Now? Now, Tommy,
it's not that close.

406
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:14,097
It's like 300 miles away.

407
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,754
300 mile, who care?

408
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:16,644
We just do it.

409
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,348
It would take hours, man.

410
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:19,223
Okay.

411
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:20,527
Now, you drive.

412
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,481
What?

413
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:22,918
Tommy, are you serious?

414
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:24,207
Yeah, I'm serious.

415
00:15:24,232 --> 00:15:25,998
Greg, the Dean
won't come to you.

416
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,092
You have to go to the Dean.

417
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,654
All right, fuck it.

418
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:32,311
All right, let's do this shit.

419
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:33,693
Road trip!

420
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:35,091
Road trip!

421
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,318
"I miss you"

422
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:40,029
"very much."

423
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:42,412
His whole life,
people tell him,

424
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:44,717
"You're not good enough.
You'll never make it."

425
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:45,761
But he doesn't listen.

426
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:47,073
He show them all.

427
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,614
That will be us
one day, Greg.

428
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,176
I... I hope we're not
dead on the side of a road.

429
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,911
No, not that part.

430
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:56,803
That we'll be famous.

431
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:58,256
We'll show them.

432
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,678
You'll see.

433
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:01,139
Yeah, maybe.

434
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:02,451
No, Greg, listen.

435
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:04,867
Give me pinky.

436
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,070
What?

437
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,539
What are we ten years old?

438
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:09,297
We pinky swear.

439
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:11,476
Right here, right now.

440
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,953
We make pact.

441
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,763
That we always
push each other.

442
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,770
That we always
believe in each other.

443
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:22,184
And that we will
never forget dream.

444
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:24,919
All right.

445
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:26,926
Okey?

446
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:27,849
Okay.

447
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:29,239

448
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:30,692

Have you lost your mind?

494
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:04,771
What? You're leaving now?

495
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:06,099
-Yeah.
-No.

496
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:07,639
No! This is absurd!

497
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:08,562
You can't just pack up

498
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,250

-Mom.

499
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:11,461

I have money saved
from my modeling jobs.

501
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:15,197
From your mo-- uh!

502
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:16,878
That money's gonna
last you two weeks.

503
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:17,902
Then what are you gonna do?

504
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:19,620
Then I'll get a job, or...

505
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,177
I don't know,
but I'll figure it out.

506
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:22,599
What about this Tommy person?

507
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,560
You barely know this guy.
You're moving in with him?

508
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:26,967
He's being a good friend.
He's just lookin' out for me.

509
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:28,694
Oh, my God, Greg.

510
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:30,781
Do you...

511
00:18:31,054 --> 00:18:33,570
Do you understand
how hard it is?

512
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:35,180
This acting thing?

513
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:36,438
You don't just...

514
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:39,095
show up in L.A.
and things happen.

515
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:40,681
It doesn't work like that.

516
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:41,800
You have to know people.

517
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:43,542
You have to
be very lucky.

518
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:44,649
You have to work

519
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:45,595
really hard.

520
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:47,214
You have to be talented.

521
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:51,355
I... I didn't mean it like that.

522
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,574
Oh, my God.

523
00:18:57,673 --> 00:18:58,525
Okay.

524
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,877
-Good.
-What, what are you--

525
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:01,628
-Mom, no, no, Mom, Mom.
-I wanna meet Tommy.

526
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:02,902
I wanna meet your
little friend, Tommy.

527
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,128
-Why? Why?
-It's gonna be good.

528
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:04,605
Mom, come on.

529
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:05,885
Hello, hi!

530
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:06,403
Hi.

531
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:07,707
Why is he driving a Mercedes?

532
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:08,692
It's complicated.

533
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:10,513
Greg, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

534
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:11,912
I have an idea,

535
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,920
why don't you guys
come in for a second

536
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,827
and we'll uh, we'll get to
know each other

537
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:16,578
-a little bit.
-We can't.

538
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:17,532
We don't have time, Mom.

539
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,524
Are you on a schedule?

540
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:19,557
Mom, just come
give me a hug, please.

541
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:21,619
Just a second, just a second,
just a second.

542
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:24,673
This is quite a fancy car
you have here, Tommy.

543
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:25,744
Wow.

544
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:26,691
Wow.

545
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:28,076
How?

546
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:29,967
How old are you?

547
00:19:29,992 --> 00:19:31,273
-Wow, the questions,
-That's personal. You can't

548
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:32,188
-My God!
-ask people that question.

549
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,564
I'm more like Greg age.

550
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:34,890

for your information.

823
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:13,421
What, you think I speak to ghost?

824
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:14,741

-No.

825
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:16,467
Maybe ghost real,
but I can't talk to them.

826

-Sorry.

That's exciting.

829
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:21,508
Okay, I let you know
how it is, babyface.

00:28:25,777 --> 00:28:26,892
Did he call you babyface?

835
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:29,621
Having girlfriend over,
watching <i>Gilmore Girls</i>.

836
00:28:29,746 --> 00:28:30,809
Whatever.

837
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,683
Love...
is not love.

838
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:37,755
Which alters
when alteration finds.

839
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:39,567
Stop. Stop!

840
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,107
What e-uh, exactly
were you doing there?

841
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,610
Uh, this sonnet.

00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:48,954
You know sonnet?

843
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,399
Yeah, I know what a sonnet is.

844
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:52,151
But I think what I'm asking is

845
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:54,332
why on earth would you choose

846
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:56,409
to do that uh, here today?

847
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,797
I do the Shakespeare.

848
00:28:57,822 --> 00:28:59,833
Have you, uh, looked
at yourself?

849
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:00,900
Yeah, I see myself.

850
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:02,267
This is, no offense,

851
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:03,636
you have a malevolent

852
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:05,392
uh, presence.

853
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,246
You are a perfect villain.

854
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:08,873
I'm not scary guy.

855
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:11,217
I could see you as
Dracula, Frankenstein.

856
00:29:11,242 --> 00:29:12,726
I'm not Frankenstein!

857
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:15,554
I'm trying to give
you a shortcut

858
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:17,038
to success.

859
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:18,617
Keep your shortcut
in your pocket.

860
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:20,289
Have you read any
Shakespeare?

861
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:21,165
I know all Shakespeare.

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,250

00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:32,150
What's this "ogre"?

869
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:33,189

00:29:33,214 --> 00:29:34,743

00:30:14,117 --> 00:30:16,046
No, there's never a slow season.

901
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:30,161
-He's my roommate.
-'Cause he's fuckin'...

902
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:31,592
You can't go anywhere
with that dude.

903
00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:34,375
Hollywood's pussy dries up
when you walk in with this dude.

904
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:35,162
I... I... I...

905

They just fuckin' clamp
shut like a fuckin'...

906
00:30:37,828 --> 00:30:40,047
Hollywood puts on a
fuckin' chastity belt.

907
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,004
Did you see the
new, uh, Star Wars?

908
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:45,738
No, I heard it was incredible.

909
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:47,074
Unwatchable.

910
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:48,090
You want another drink?

911
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:49,582
-Hmm.
-Okay.

912
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,238
I kinda wondered about
the Jar Jar Binks thing.

913
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:53,298
It's pretty thin.

914
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,121
And you know,
I don't know.

915
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,723
It doesn't really
get you that far.

916
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:58,738
It's like too much action,
like it never stops.

917
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:01,418
There's no story,
and it makes me pass out.

918
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,707
A couple of friends of mine
went and saw it recently.

919
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:04,654
Hi.

920
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:07,877
You big Hollywood
producer, right?

921
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,361
I see-I see you on TV.

922
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:10,846
Yeah, I'm Hoyer.
Nice to see you.

923
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:11,994
Tommy Wiseau.

924
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:12,800
Hi.

925
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:13,885
Nice to meet you, thank you.

926
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
Hi, young lady.

927
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:17,025
I don't wanna bullshit.

928
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,470
I don't wanna do none
of the bullshit.

929
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:20,549
I'm very talented.

930
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:22,041
And I have many good idea.

931
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,095
We're having dinner.

932
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,565
Okay, you don't walk up
to people's table and do this.

933
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,933
That's not how it works
in this business, okay?

934
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,895
What way? Tell me, I do it.

935
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,903
You can call my agency,
United Talent.

936
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:33,224
Send your resume to
United Talent Agency,

937
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:34,364
to David Kramer.

938
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:35,966
-That's how you--
-I show you that.

939
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:36,936
Okay?

940
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,374
To be!

941
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,600
Or not to be!

942
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:43,703
That is the question.

943
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,586
Whether nobler in mind!

944
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,868
To suffer sling and arrow!

945
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:51,664
Sir, I'm gonna need to
ask you to stop that.

946
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:52,759
Is this gentleman bothering you?

947
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:53,471
What the fuck do you think?

948
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,721
You don't like Shakespeare?

949
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,519
Sir, I need you to leave.

950
00:31:55,544 --> 00:31:56,230
Wha-?

951
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:57,878
Okay, I do the Tennessee William

952
00:31:57,903 --> 00:31:59,371
I don't want Tennessee Williams,
I don't want Shakespeare.

953
00:31:59,396 --> 00:32:00,372
Stella!

954
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:01,966
Okay, now, we're
gonna--security!

955
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:03,561
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
-Security! No.

956
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,061
Sir, I'm gonna need you to leave.
Right now.

957
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,139
Come here.

958
00:32:07,483 --> 00:32:08,350
Tommy?

959
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,091
Just because you want it

960
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,411
doesn't mean it can happen.

961
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:14,403
Okay?

962
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:17,359
It's one in a million, even
if you have Brando's talent.

963
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:20,428
It's not gonna happen for you.
Okay?

964
00:32:20,827 --> 00:32:22,967
-But now, you have to go
-Well, maybe I...

965
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,959
Maybe...

966
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:24,991
I'm not saying maybe.

967
00:32:25,016 --> 00:32:27,616
I'm saying not in
a million years.

968
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:29,569
But after that?

969
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:31,203
And not after.

970
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:34,406
I'm sorry.

971
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:35,632
I accept your apology.

972
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:36,406
Sorry.

973
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:37,946
Sorry, sir.
Is everything okay now?

974
00:32:37,971 --> 00:32:38,954
Yeah, thanks for rushing over.

975
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:41,431
He made it through two
fuckin' acts of Shakespeare.

976
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:11,734
Tommy?

977
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:18,373
Tommy.

978
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:40,201
Tommy.

979
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,510
Tommy, you okay?

980
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:01,367
You think I'm villain?

981
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,772
What?

982
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:04,944
This town, Greg.

983
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:07,538
They don't want me.

984
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:10,108
They don't understand me.

985
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:14,914
Maybe I don't have what it take.

986
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:18,836
Yeah, man,
I know what you mean.

987
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:20,665
-You do?
-Yeah.

988
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:23,151
My agent won't return
my calls, and...

989
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:27,424
all I hear is no
all day, every day, it's...

990
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:29,299
it's fuckin' hard, man.

991
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,869
Nobody like me, Greg.

992
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:38,041
Nobody give me chance.

993
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:40,338
My whole life.

994
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:46,071
But hey, w-we can't give up, right?

995
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,500
I...

996
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:52,181
Maybe not worth it, Greg.

997
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:54,736
No, hey, Tommy, look at me.

998
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:56,070
Look at me.

999
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:00,258
When they told James Dean
he wasn't good enough,

1000
00:35:00,283 --> 00:35:01,422
did he listen to 'em?

1001
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,486
-No.
-No.

1002
00:35:04,588 --> 00:35:05,908
No, fuck that.

1003
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:08,517
All right, he kept fighting.
H-he showed them all. And...

1004
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,042
that's what we're gonna do.

1005
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:13,908
Remember?

1006
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:16,604
All right, we said we were
gonna push each other.

1007
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,548
Never give up on our dreams, right?

1008
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:20,971
Come on.

1009
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:28,729
I just don't know how, Greg.

1010
00:35:31,252 --> 00:35:33,189
I wish we could just
make our own movie.

1011
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,967
That great idea.

1012
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:46,600
<i>It'll be great drama.
Like the Tennessee Williams.</i>

1013
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:50,260
<i>So, there's this guy, Johnny.
A true American hero.</i>

1014
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:51,573
<i>To be played by me.</i>

1015
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:52,893
<i>He has it all.</i>

1016
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:55,589
<i>Good look, good job,
many friends.</i>

1017
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:56,692
Greg?

1018
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:59,074
How long is movie script?

1019
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:02,899
And then this girl,
this beautiful girl...

1020
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:04,665
she betray him.

1021
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:07,751
<i>But then, this Lisa
sleep with best friend.</i>

1022
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,611
<i>We call best friend "Mark."</i>

1023
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:13,322
After Mark Damon from
"Talented Ripley Man."

1024
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:17,471
And then this guy, Johnny,
he go crazy!

1025
00:36:18,942 --> 00:36:23,019
<i>He decide to kill himself
in front of the world.</i>

1026
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:25,867
<i>And then he show them all.</i>

1027
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:26,997
Ha ha ha.

1028
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:28,984
That's great.

1029
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:30,886
<i>And also, maybe
Johnny is vampire.</i>

1030
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:31,738
<i>We'll see.</i>

1031
00:36:31,763 --> 00:36:34,263
<i>Anything for my princess.</i>

1032
00:36:34,288 --> 00:36:36,919
<i>After everything
he do for everybody,</i>

1033
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,717
<i>why would they do this to him?</i>

1034
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:40,719
My mind!

1035
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:42,359
Can't think.

1036
00:36:42,384 --> 00:36:44,141
She was nice but real proud.

1037
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:45,739
She was nice but real proud.

1038
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:50,234
<i>But it's real life.</i>

1039
00:36:50,413 --> 00:36:52,656
<i>People act so
strange these days.</i>

1040
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,445
Aaah!

1041
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:01,070
You finished?

1042
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:03,304
It's my masterpiece.

1043
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,718
Greatest drama since the
Tennessee Williams.

1044
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:08,116
"The Room."

1045
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,304
"The Room."

1046
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:11,145
Nobody read it yet.

1047
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:14,372
So today, you be first one.

1048
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:15,770
Yeah, all right.

1049
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:19,858
So read it.

1050
00:37:19,897 --> 00:37:21,279
Oh, you want me to
read it right now?

1051
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:22,678
Yeah, what you think?

1052
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:24,850
Okay. The Room.

1053
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:27,016
<i>I'll do anything for my girl.</i>

1054
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:28,422
<i>You should marry Johnny.</i>

1055
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:30,705
<i>Did you know that
chocolate is the symbol of love?</i>

1056
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,611
<i>We can't do this anymore.</i>

1057
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:38,351
<i>I keep thinking about your
strong hands round my body.</i>

1058
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:40,093
<i>Anyway, how's your sex life?</i>

1059
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:41,601
<i>I don't think she's
faithful to me.</i>

1060
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,114
<i>Life gets complicated.</i>

1061
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:44,497
<i>The unexpected happens.</i>

1062
00:37:44,522 --> 00:37:45,810
<i>In a few minutes, bitch.</i>

1063
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,052
<i>A lot of people
loved each other.</i>

1064
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:49,444
<i>The world will be a
better place to live.</i>

1065
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:56,179
Done.

1066
00:37:58,773 --> 00:38:00,054
What you think?

1067
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,984
I mean, it's great. That's...

1068
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,359
I just-I can't-I can't believe it, man.
You-you did this!

1069
00:38:06,648 --> 00:38:08,187
And of course, you play Mark.

1070
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:11,099
What? You want-you want me
to play Mark in this?

1071
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,293
Hey, big role. Second lead.

1072
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:16,077
Yeah, it's a huge role.
Are you-are you sure?

1073
00:38:16,102 --> 00:38:17,951
Well, you don't
wanna do it, fine.

1074
00:38:18,157 --> 00:38:19,805
Maybe Johnny Dapp available.

1075
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,216
No, no, no, no. I want it!

1076
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:23,480
I-I want the role. I'll take it.

1077
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:24,666
It's like you said,

1078
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,190
Hollywood reject us

1079
00:38:26,294 --> 00:38:27,911
then we do it on our own.

1080
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:30,060
Wait, y-you have the
money to make this?

1081
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:31,952
I have. Is no problem.

1082
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:34,482
You're really gonna
make this thing?

1083
00:38:34,507 --> 00:38:35,592
No, Greg.

1084
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:37,904
<i>We</i> are going to do it.

1085
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,076
Together.

1086
00:38:44,509 --> 00:38:46,298
Awoo!

1087
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,150
Aw-awooo!

1088
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:53,128
And we're gonna have
everything you need.

1089
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,261
We have a vast
assortment of lenses.

1090
00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:58,278
We've got cameras,
both digital and film.

1091
00:38:58,325 --> 00:38:59,418
Here's our facility owner.

1092
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:00,138
Hey, Bill!

1093
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:02,591
Come on over and meet
Tommy and Greg.

1094
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:03,770
These are the guys
I was telling you about.

1095
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:05,342
-Oh, hi.
-How you doing, man?

1096
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:06,256
Hey, hey, pleasure to meet you.

1097
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:07,063
How long is the shoot?

1098
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:08,344
As long as it take.

1099
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:09,656
All right.

1100
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,602
Uh, we just wanna
make it right, you know?

1101
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:12,770
Well,

1102
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,222
I think you're gonna find
everything you need here

1103
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:15,277
at Birns and Sawyer.

1104
00:39:15,348 --> 00:39:17,113
Our rental packages
start at about--

1105
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:18,544
Wait, wait, I stop you right there.

1106
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:19,060
Okay.

1107
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,654
We don't rent, we buy.

1108
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:23,943
Is that not normal or?

1109
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:25,826
Industry standard is
pretty much that you

1110
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:27,912
would rent the equipment because

1111
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:29,677
it's so prohibitively
expensive to own it.

1112
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:31,679
Okay. I said no problem.

1113
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:33,944
Okay, I guess we'll buy.

1114
00:39:34,153 --> 00:39:36,622
You wanna shoot 35 or HD?

1115
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:38,497
Well, we'll shoot both on this film.

1116
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:40,372
Digital <i>and</i> film?

1117
00:39:40,397 --> 00:39:42,637
But you'd need twice the crew,

1118
00:39:42,662 --> 00:39:45,005
uh, twice the equipment. I mean...

1119
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:48,021
Hell, both--they're lit differently.
It's just not done.

1120
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:48,756
I have vision.

1121
00:39:48,781 --> 00:39:50,592
Tommy, the pioneer, man.
He-- that's--

1122
00:39:50,617 --> 00:39:52,773
He wants to go outside the box.
It's what he does.

1123
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,023
So what, we have deal or what?

1124
00:39:56,073 --> 00:39:57,221
Well, let's discuss.

1125
00:39:57,246 --> 00:39:59,011
Yeah, give us a minute,
you know, it's just...

1126
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,023
you know, not normally
how we do business.

1127
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:03,180
This is weird, who
buys equipment?

1128
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:04,843
-Apparently, this guy.
-I don't know about these guys.

1129
00:40:04,937 --> 00:40:07,171
-If he has the money...
-Does he have the money?

1130
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,687
How do we know
if he has the money?

1131
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,250
We are a business,
we sell stuff.

1132
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:11,320
-Let's sell it to him.
-Okay.

1133
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:13,069
I have an idea.
Follow my lead.

1134
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:14,576
-Do it.
-Okay, okay.

1135
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:15,861
Great.

1136
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:17,025
So...

1137
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:21,339
We are able to sell you
all the equipment you need.

1138
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:22,668
-Okay!
-There we go.

1139
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,207
Now, you say yes.

1140
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:25,528
And we're also...

1141
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:27,794
willing to give it to you
at a reduced rate...

1142
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:30,388
if you decide to shoot
here in our studio.

1143
00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:31,669
What do you think?

1144
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:32,710
We shoot here?

1145
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:34,897
We wanna be in business
with you, Tommy.

1146
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:37,852
Okay, we make American movie
with American discount!

1147
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:39,336
-Right?
-Perfect!

1148
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:40,985
-Okay, that's a deal, right?
-Deal. Great.

1149
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:47,732
-The character is Lisa.
-Okay.

1150
00:40:47,757 --> 00:40:51,833
Is she, you know, like
romantic or a scientist?

1151
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:53,569
-Or is she...
-She is Lisa.

1152
00:40:53,594 --> 00:40:54,461
Okay.

1153
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,844
Alright, now we do scene, okay?

00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:11,774
So, I just wanna introduce
you to some people.

1160

1172
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:32,266

00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,213
I don't want cowboy,

1174
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:35,205
Are you cowboy?

1175
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:35,878
-No.

1176
00:41:35,903 --> 00:41:37,113

00:41:46,368 --> 00:41:48,132
This is Safoya,
she does costumes.

1184
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:50,226
Would she see my character
dressed like this?

1185
00:41:50,376 --> 00:41:53,454
Um, maybe we could get
rid of one of the belts?

1186
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:55,070
What? No, no way!

1187
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:56,606

1188
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,534
Okay.

1189
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,166
Pretend I'm boyfriend.

1190
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:01,902
Aaaah!

1191
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:03,629
And what do you do?

1192
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,591
You remember Bill?
You know Bill, come on.

1193
00:42:05,616 --> 00:42:07,027
I sold you the equipment.

1194
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:08,435
-Yeah!
-Right.

1195
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:10,006
Bill, I didn't know it was you.

1196
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,577
And action.

1197
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:12,602
I'm sorry, my darling.

1198
00:42:12,627 --> 00:42:14,008
No, start it over.

1199
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:15,798
Do it like Shakespeare, but sexy.

1200
00:42:15,892 --> 00:42:16,970
Okay.

1201
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:21,013
Good day, Mark!

1202
00:42:21,474 --> 00:42:22,959
I misseth you.

1203
00:42:22,984 --> 00:42:23,810
That was great!

1204
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:25,185
Don't break character.

1205
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:25,991
Is Johnny there?

1206
00:42:26,016 --> 00:42:27,827
Okay, everybody hired!

1207
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:28,923
-Just like that?
-Yeah.

1208
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:30,274
-Okay.
-That was easy.

1209
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:31,923
You wanna like talk about the
vision of the movie though?

1210
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:34,221
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.
We talk about all day.

1211
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:36,138
As a script supervisor,
it would be really helpful

1212
00:42:36,163 --> 00:42:37,568
if I could look at the
script for the movie first.

1213
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:40,271
Everybody want script.
Don't be greedy, okay?

1214
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:42,520
What we do, it's a
little unconventional, and so...

1215
00:42:42,545 --> 00:42:43,201
Okay.

1216
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,834
You're licking ice cream cone.

1217
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,796
Okay, but it's really hot out,
so it's melting.

1218
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:50,180
Oh, okay.

1219
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:52,211
You better lick fast!

1220
00:42:52,384 --> 00:42:53,923
Oh, no, but now
it's like brain freeze!

1221
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:54,658
It's too much at once!

1222
00:42:54,683 --> 00:42:55,751
-Yeah, get it all.
-Yeah!

1223
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:57,150
-Get it all in there.
-Yeah, you gotta throw it all.

1224
00:42:57,189 --> 00:42:58,705
Is this a real movie?

1225
00:42:58,745 --> 00:42:59,597
I really wanna be in one.

1226
00:42:59,629 --> 00:43:01,151
No, stop. I don't make porno.

1227
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:01,888
Okay.

1228
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:02,700
I just do ice cream.

1229
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:03,614
I could try it again.

1230
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:04,389
Don't try again.

1231
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:05,819
You know what?
You're hired.

1232
00:43:05,905 --> 00:43:07,373

00:43:57,688 --> 00:44:01,823
Okay! Today our
top of mountain day.

1247
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:06,162
Today we take first steps
on a great journey.

1248
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:11,436
After today, which one of
ourselves will ever be same?

1249
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:15,581
This play work if chemistry
between character make sense.

1250
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:17,555
Human behavior.

1251
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:18,859
Betrayal.

1252
00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:20,546
It applies to all of us.

1253
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:22,414
It's in ourselves.

1254
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:24,895
You love someone.

1255
00:44:25,197 --> 00:44:26,400
What is love?

1256
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,973
You need to have spirit, hope.

1257
00:44:29,223 --> 00:44:30,293
Be optimist.

1258
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,035
But can you handle

1259
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:34,183
all your human behavior

1260
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,559
and behavior of others?

1261
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:39,579
Right? Right, see
what I'm saying?

1262
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:41,579
You don't wanna be good.

1263
00:44:42,938 --> 00:44:44,626
You wanna be great.

1264
00:44:45,056 --> 00:44:47,149
Okay, I have one announcement.

1265
00:44:47,174 --> 00:44:51,420
This um, is bathroom I spent
many dollars on this.

1267
00:44:53,762 --> 00:44:55,160
You know there's like a real

00:45:00,888 --> 00:45:02,176
No Mickey Mouse stuff.

1272
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:05,085

00:45:16,194 --> 00:45:18,053
This set of the alley way

1280
00:45:18,078 --> 00:45:20,764
looks exactly like the real
alley way out there.

1281
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:23,405
That's right. That's what we do
in Hollywood movie, right?

1282
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:25,289
Well, why don't we just
shoot in the real alley way?

1283
00:45:25,946 --> 00:45:28,071
Because is real Hollywood movie.

1284

Maybe you think
I don't do great scene

1442
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:01,415
-or something.
-Tommy, not at all.

1443
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,900
Where wardrobe girl?

1444
00:50:02,925 --> 00:50:03,792
I'm sure she's...

1445
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:05,276
Where wardrobe girl?!

1446
00:50:05,301 --> 00:50:06,184
Right here, right here.

1447
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:07,981
Where you been?
I been looking all over.

1448
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,434
I just went to get ties.

1449
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:11,962
Well, ready now.
Too late. Already dressed.

1450
00:50:12,026 --> 00:50:13,049
But none of that matches. I...

1451
00:50:13,074 --> 00:50:15,432
Look, it's his first day in front
of the camera. He's just nervous.

1452
00:50:15,457 --> 00:50:17,355
Don't talk about me, Greg.
I hear you.

1453
00:50:17,387 --> 00:50:18,377
Look, I'm sorry.

1454
00:50:18,402 --> 00:50:20,230
I have ear
for your information.

1455
00:50:20,488 --> 00:50:22,441
Are you gonna film with all
that stuff in your pockets?

1456
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:24,152
I keep my stuff, sweetie.

1457
00:50:24,926 --> 00:50:27,340
Okay, could I at least take
a photo for continuity?

1458
00:50:27,365 --> 00:50:29,043
Continuity in your forehead.

1459
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,435
What's that even mean?

1460
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,498
Don't take it personally.
He's going crazy.

1461
00:50:32,523 --> 00:50:33,452
I need five more
minutes for lighting.

1462
00:50:33,523 --> 00:50:35,109
No, I'm ready now!

1463
00:50:35,178 --> 00:50:37,335
Let's go, let's go, Sandy.

00:50:48,543 --> 00:50:49,747
What is line?

1470
00:50:50,363 --> 00:50:51,425

1471
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:52,433
"It's not true."

1472
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:53,339
"It's bullshit."

1473
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:54,331
"I did not hit her."

1474
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:55,245
"I did not."

1475
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:56,655

00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:11,494
"It's not true."

1481
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:12,345

1492
00:51:32,687 --> 00:51:33,883

1493
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:35,687

00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:37,039

No! Do you wanna change the line?

You're doing great, man.

1501
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,041
We'll get there.

1502
00:51:49,158 --> 00:51:50,032
Action.

1503
00:51:50,947 --> 00:51:51,759
Action!

1504
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:53,065
Action, action!

1505
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,471
You have to say out loud,
I can't hear in here.

1506
00:51:56,676 --> 00:51:58,317
Say "action" so I can hear.

1507
00:51:58,342 --> 00:51:59,309
Okay.

1508
00:52:00,645 --> 00:52:01,481

00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,356
It's bullshit.

1512
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:07,707

00:52:09,587 --> 00:52:10,641
Oh, hi, Mark.

1515
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:11,996
What the f--where
are you looking?

1516
00:52:12,035 --> 00:52:14,270
It doesn't work if you're
looking at the camera.

1517
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:15,027
What?

1518
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,801

1525
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:29,684
Fuck!

1526
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,980
Hey, hey, hey...

1527
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:31,620
What?

1528
00:52:31,645 --> 00:52:33,105
Okay, uh, maybe just use this...

1529
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,620
You know, I think it'll
help you take your mind off...

1530
00:52:34,645 --> 00:52:35,496
Water bottle?

1531
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:37,207
Hey, hey, listen, listen,
what do you always say to me?

1532
00:52:37,232 --> 00:52:39,270
All right?
Intensity, show emotion!

1533
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,325
Throw it! Do something crazy!

1534
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:42,302
-Oh, show emotion.
-Use the bottle, yes!

1535
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:43,702
That's easy part.

1536
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,795
Why don't you say that
to me before, Greg?

1537
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,216
-I don't know, I...
-See, Greg...

1538
00:52:47,654 --> 00:52:49,271
These other guys,
these other people...

1539
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,177
they don't care like
you care, you know?

1540
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:52,038
I care, yeah, yeah.

1541
00:52:52,063 --> 00:52:54,170
-Okay, we do this together.
-Me and you, man, you got this.

1542
00:52:54,224 --> 00:52:55,607
-Show emotion.
-Yes!

1543
00:52:55,632 --> 00:52:57,883
-Okay, I do it.
-Okay, all right.

1544
00:52:57,943 --> 00:52:59,990
-All right.
-All right, let's see.

1545
00:53:00,304 --> 00:53:02,468
Oh, we got a bottle now.
Look out.

1546
00:53:03,396 --> 00:53:04,326
Action.

1547
00:53:04,991 --> 00:53:06,192
I did not hit her.

1548
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:07,210
It's not true.

1549
00:53:07,235 --> 00:53:07,841
It's bullshit.

1550
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,187
I did not hit her.

1551
00:53:09,212 --> 00:53:10,444
I did not.

1552
00:53:12,175 --> 00:53:13,128
Oh, hi, Mark.

1553
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:17,743
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1554
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:18,649
He did it!

1555
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:20,071
I got it!

1556
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:25,924
We got done!

1557
00:53:25,949 --> 00:53:27,323
Okay, moving on now!

1558
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:29,729
Hey, babe.

1559
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,385
Babe.

1560
00:53:34,401 --> 00:53:35,377
Babe.

1561
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:38,383
You wanna take a break?

1562
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,305
Um...

1563
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:40,500
How's it going?

1564
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:41,609
You feeling good?

1565
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:43,149
I am.

1566
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:45,900
I am, yeah, feels like
it's coming together.

1567
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,556
-Good.
-Yeah.

1568
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:48,892
And Tommy's?

1569
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:50,681
-Tommy is...
-Settling?

1570
00:53:50,706 --> 00:53:52,400
Yeah, h-he's stressed.

1571
00:53:52,425 --> 00:53:55,229
You know, he did his
first scene, which uh...

1572
00:53:55,254 --> 00:53:56,644
took a million takes, but

1573
00:53:56,669 --> 00:53:57,723
Oh, acting it?

1574
00:53:57,748 --> 00:54:00,497
But you know, he's the director
too, and that's like...

1575
00:54:00,522 --> 00:54:03,623
it's a lot, a lot to think about,
acting, directing, producing.

1576
00:54:03,648 --> 00:54:05,811
So, he's doing-he's doing great.
He'll get there.

1577
00:54:05,836 --> 00:54:06,961
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1578
00:54:06,986 --> 00:54:08,281
What do you do...

1579
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:10,242
if it turns out...

1580
00:54:10,566 --> 00:54:11,926
really bad?

1581
00:54:12,176 --> 00:54:13,074
-It's...
-Like...

1582
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,676
It's not gonna be bad.

1583
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:15,988
Like if it turns out...

1584
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,208
terrible...

1585
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,122
would you...

1586
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:19,458
-That would...
-can you take it off...

1587
00:54:19,483 --> 00:54:20,967
-your IMDB?
-That would suck, but...

1588
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:22,866
when it feels good, it feels good

1589
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:24,470
and it's like, you know
when it's working or not.

1590
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,541
and it's... it's really working.

1591
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:28,026
-Good.
-Yeah.

1592
00:54:29,377 --> 00:54:31,877
I used to know a girl,
she had a dozen guys.

1593
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:34,697
One of them found out about it,
beat her up so bad,

1594
00:54:34,722 --> 00:54:36,791
she ended up at a hospital
in Guerrero Street.

1595
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:37,845
Ha ha ha ha.

1596
00:54:38,019 --> 00:54:39,456
What a story, Mark.

1597
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:40,433
Cut!

1598
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:42,985
Why is he laughing?

1599
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,516
-I have no idea.
-Weird time to laugh.

1600
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:45,196
Uh!

1601
00:54:45,712 --> 00:54:47,852
Why don't we go
one more time? And uh...

1602
00:54:47,877 --> 00:54:50,899
Let's just get a different
reaction to the story, okay? Uh...

1603
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,041
Let's uh, let's roll
with tail slate.

1604
00:54:53,066 --> 00:54:54,455
-Rolling.
-'Kay.

1605
00:54:54,652 --> 00:54:55,511
Everyone set?

1606
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:56,675
-Yeah.
-Ready...

1607
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,207
And, uh, action.

1608
00:54:58,943 --> 00:55:01,716
I used to know a girl,
she had a dozen guys.

1609
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:04,450
One of them found out about it,
beat her up so bad,

1610
00:55:04,475 --> 00:55:06,560
she ended up at a hospital
in Guerrero Street.

1611
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:07,599
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1612
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:09,521
What a story, Mark.

1613
00:55:09,546 --> 00:55:10,396
Cut!

1614
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,733
Oh, God.

1615
00:55:13,335 --> 00:55:14,014
Uh.

1616
00:55:17,274 --> 00:55:18,423
Hey, uh...

1617
00:55:19,212 --> 00:55:20,282
So...

1618
00:55:20,307 --> 00:55:22,141
the story he's telling you...

1619
00:55:22,768 --> 00:55:25,111
the one you... yourself wrote...

1620
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,080
Yeah?

1621
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:27,697
It's not a funny story, Tommy.

1622
00:55:27,939 --> 00:55:30,674
Yeah, I thought-I thought this
was a serious scene, Tommy?

1623
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:32,330
-Yeah, why are you laughing?
-Okay.

1624
00:55:32,355 --> 00:55:35,881
Well, some-sometimes people
do crazy things, right?

1625
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:37,496
Human behavior.

1626
00:55:38,613 --> 00:55:39,847
Okay, fair enough.

1627
00:55:39,872 --> 00:55:41,589
Maybe just get one...

1628
00:55:41,614 --> 00:55:43,543
where you don't laugh
at the story, okay?

1629
00:55:43,568 --> 00:55:44,155
Okay.

1630
00:55:44,413 --> 00:55:45,139
Okay.

1631
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:46,108
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1632
00:55:46,171 --> 00:55:46,788
Uh.

1633
00:55:46,983 --> 00:55:48,076
Okay, we still rolling?

1634
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:49,546
-Still rolling.
-Cameras set.

1635
00:55:49,571 --> 00:55:50,624
Okay, we'll pick it up.

1636
00:55:50,649 --> 00:55:52,435
-Go.
-All right. Set the speed.

1637
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,320
Ready, and, action.

1638
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:57,444
I used to know a girl,
she had a dozen guys.

1639
00:55:57,874 --> 00:56:00,420
One of them found out about it,
beat her up so bad,

1640
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:02,747
she ended up at a hospital
in Guerrero Street.

1641
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:03,826
Ha ha ha!

1642
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:05,996
What a story, Mark.

1643
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:07,576
Cut!

1644
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:08,593
He's not gonna listen to you.

1645
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:10,328
We're gonna be here all night.
Just call it.

1646
00:56:10,353 --> 00:56:12,921
All right, cut, check it.
Great. I think we got it.

1647
00:56:12,946 --> 00:56:14,907
Okay, great.
Check gate.

1648
00:56:18,323 --> 00:56:19,799
It's human behavior.

1649
00:56:21,229 --> 00:56:23,956
<i>He knows nothing
about filmmaking.</i>

1650
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:24,722
<i>He's a complete idiot.</i>

1651
00:56:24,747 --> 00:56:26,145
<i>I don't even think
he's seen a movie.</i>

1652
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:28,051
<i>Clearly never been
on a set before.</i>

1653
00:56:28,076 --> 00:56:30,403
<i>What? Have you ever heard
of someone producing, directing...</i>

1654
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:33,374
This guys doesn't know anything,
talking all the time...

1655
00:56:33,399 --> 00:56:34,631
<i>Who gives this guy money?</i>

1656
00:56:34,656 --> 00:56:36,540
<i>Oh, I don't even
wanna get into that,</i>

1657
00:56:36,565 --> 00:56:38,337
<i>that's something
going for a probe.</i>

1658
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:43,147
Oh, wow.

1659
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,516
I love burrito.

1660
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:49,363
Uh, Tommy, so, um...

1661
00:56:49,918 --> 00:56:51,496
the reason we
brought you here...

1662
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,199
is uh, because w-we've
been talking, and...

1663
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:58,192
we decided that we want
to move in together.

1664
00:56:59,263 --> 00:57:00,178
Oh.

1665
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,274
I sorry.

1666
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:05,172
Impossible.

1667
00:57:05,306 --> 00:57:07,259
I have no room for
three people my place.

1668
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,095
Oh, no, that's-that's not
what I mean. Um...

1669
00:57:10,524 --> 00:57:12,446
No, Greg is gonna
move in with me.

1670
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:13,321
Yeah.

1671
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:15,211
What?

1672
00:57:16,157 --> 00:57:19,477
Well, y-you know, we've been
going out for a little while now.

1673
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,665
It just kinda felt like the
right next step, you know.

1674
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,651
-The right time.
-The right time. Exactly.

1675
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:30,542
What about movie?

1676
00:57:30,899 --> 00:57:31,805
What about it?

1677
00:57:32,508 --> 00:57:33,358
What the...

1678
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,938
Living together and the movie have
nothing to do with each other.

1679
00:57:36,985 --> 00:57:37,782
Oh.

1680
00:57:38,024 --> 00:57:40,086
Tommy, I-I'll see you on Monday.

1681
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:41,914
I'll be there.

1682
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:47,273
I have to go to bathroom.

1683
00:57:47,656 --> 00:57:49,359
Wait, Tommy, Tommy...

1684
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:50,945
Dude, just-just
'cause I'm moving out

1685
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,125
doesn't mean we're not gonna
see each other anymore.

1686
00:57:54,626 --> 00:57:56,204
He's all right, babe.

1687
00:57:56,229 --> 00:57:58,290
-It could have been worse, I guess.
-Yeah.

1688
00:57:58,361 --> 00:58:00,712
Aaaah!

1689
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:01,861
Aaah!

1690
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:03,727
Aah!

1691
00:58:04,094 --> 00:58:04,781
Aah!

1692
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,955
Everybody betray me!

1693
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,055
Aah!

1694
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,477
Oh, my foot.

1695
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:13,571
I hurt my foot.

1696
00:58:14,931 --> 00:58:16,727
Just another day at the office.

1697
00:58:16,752 --> 00:58:17,954
Can you not?

1698
00:58:18,174 --> 00:58:19,026
Right now?

1699
00:58:19,051 --> 00:58:20,354
I need more lights over here.

1700
00:58:20,401 --> 00:58:21,463
You help him.

1701
00:58:21,488 --> 00:58:22,519
You too, you too.

1702
00:58:22,544 --> 00:58:23,707
-Back me up.
-Greg?

1703
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:25,354
I need this look like "Titanic."

1704
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,035
<i>-The</i> Titanic?
-Yeah, that one.

1705
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,606
Yeah, yeah, trust me, it does.

1706
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:29,231
Okay.

1707
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:30,646
-Okay, we go.
-Tommy, Tommy.

1708
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:31,959
This is not necessary.

1709
00:58:31,984 --> 00:58:33,662
No, very necessary.

1710
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:35,935
I need to show my ass
to sell this movie.

1711
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,531
Maybe uh,
at least we have a close set?

1712
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,773
Not closed set, open set.

1713
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,548
Life is not closed set.

1714
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:44,243
I want everyone to see.

1715
00:58:44,268 --> 00:58:45,634
You especially.

1716
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:46,857
What? Why? What?

1717
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,229
Brad Pitt do this
in "The Legend of the Falls."

1718
00:58:49,254 --> 00:58:50,136
Juliette, are you okay?

1719
00:58:50,161 --> 00:58:52,933
Could we maybe just put on some
music to get in the mood, like...

1720
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:54,544
-No.
-maybe a little Alicia Keys?

1721
00:58:54,569 --> 00:58:57,052
I'm sorry, we're not here to
promote other people's work.

1722
00:58:57,077 --> 00:58:58,600
All right?
We go!

1723
00:58:58,625 --> 00:58:59,959
-Okay, roll it!
-Roll it.

1724
00:58:59,984 --> 00:59:02,108
Wait, wait, cut, cut!
What is this?

1725
00:59:02,297 --> 00:59:03,820
What is this?
This disgusting.

1726
00:59:03,845 --> 00:59:04,812
It's my body.

1727
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:06,984
No, this pimples on the...
Makeup!

1728
00:59:07,064 --> 00:59:09,579
Makeup, come fix
this disgusting body.

1729
00:59:09,604 --> 00:59:10,853
Tommy, what the fuck?

1730
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:12,993
Juliette, I'm so sorry!
I'm so--

1731
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,440
Dude, w-what are you doing?
Why are you acting like this?

1732
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:18,041
This American movie,
she need to look sexy.

1733
00:59:18,066 --> 00:59:19,825
-Beautiful.
-Come here.

1734
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,092
God!

1735
00:59:21,386 --> 00:59:22,504
Fuck, man.

1736
00:59:22,529 --> 00:59:23,746
I know I'm hard on her.

1737
00:59:23,771 --> 00:59:26,560
Yeah, you're har--it's not just that.
What's going on with you?

1738
00:59:26,787 --> 00:59:29,014
Stanley Kubrick, he nice to actors?

1739
00:59:29,114 --> 00:59:30,458
Alfred Hitchcock?

1740
00:59:30,548 --> 00:59:31,946
Let me tell you something, Greg.

1741
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:33,298
He do this movie, "Birds."

1742
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,752
Yeah, I'm aware of <i>The Birds.</i>

1743
00:59:34,777 --> 00:59:37,159
On this movie,
he terrify actors.

1744
00:59:37,184 --> 00:59:38,434
He locked them in room.

1745
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:40,160
He throw-he throw
birds at them.

1746
00:59:40,185 --> 00:59:41,254
Real birds!

1747
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:42,175
Th-Th-Th...

1748
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,238
Nasty stuff.

1749
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:44,951
The actors,
they cry every day.

1750
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:46,990
But this movie
win every award.

1751
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:48,733
Is Mr. Hitchcock bad man?

1752
00:59:48,758 --> 00:59:50,171
No. He great director.

1753
00:59:50,196 --> 00:59:51,639
Yeah, but he was an asshole.

1754
00:59:51,664 --> 00:59:53,883
And I bet he didn't direct
with his fucking dick out!

1755
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:56,531
Oh, really? Well, maybe we
check the record, okay?

1756
00:59:56,556 --> 00:59:57,275
-Okay.
-And you know,

1757
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,573
for your information,

1758
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:01,769
word "director" come from
"dictator." Rest my case.

1759
01:00:01,794 --> 01:00:03,863
You can't treat them like--
This is not right!

1760
01:00:03,888 --> 01:00:05,028
I treat them
how I treat them.

1761
01:00:05,053 --> 01:00:07,779
If anyone needs to be upset
here, it's me, quite frankly.

1762
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,311
-What?
-I give them job.

1763
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:10,600
I give them salary.

1764
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,867
I already spend five million
dollar on this movie, Greg!

1765
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:14,891
Five! Are you kidding me?
Five million dollars?!

1766
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:16,383
And they are not grateful!

1767
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,984
Nobody respect my vision!

1768
01:00:18,009 --> 01:00:20,328
I know what they say, Greg.
I hear them.

1769
01:00:20,353 --> 01:00:22,375
Nobody trusts me.
Not even you, Greg!

1770
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,931
That's-- What are you?

1771
01:00:23,972 --> 01:00:25,237
Oh, see, you don't even trust me!

1772
01:00:25,262 --> 01:00:26,808
-What? Hey, Tommy!
-Let's go!

1773
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:27,956
-Let's go!
-Be nice to her!

1774
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:29,161
-Juliette, let's go.
-Be nice to her.

1775
01:00:29,186 --> 01:00:30,287
Let's go, please.

1776
01:00:30,312 --> 01:00:32,015
I'm a professional, I'm okay.

1777
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,101
If you're not comfortable,
tell me, okay?

1778
01:00:34,126 --> 01:00:35,679
I can do it. It's fine.

1779
01:00:35,704 --> 01:00:37,187
-All right, roll it.
-It's a movie.

1780
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:38,360
Ready.

1781
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,009
And action.

1782
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:45,836
Oh, my--

1783
01:00:47,086 --> 01:00:48,828
I think you're aiming
a little bit high.

1784
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,789
I aim where I aim.
Just do the scene.

1785
01:00:51,507 --> 01:00:53,453
Why is he having sex
with her belly button?

1786
01:00:54,672 --> 01:00:56,515
He knows where her
vagina is, right?

1787
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,086
Okay, cut!

1788
01:00:58,111 --> 01:00:59,056
I need more passion.

1789
01:00:59,081 --> 01:01:01,227
And this, it's still disgusting.
You go clean it.

1790
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:02,729
Fuck that! Okay!

1791
01:01:02,853 --> 01:01:04,055
-You embarrass that girl
-Whoa, whoa, whoa,

1792
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,040
-in front of the entire crew...
-whoa, whoa, whoa...

1793
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:05,877
you're a dead man!

1794
01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:07,339
-Oh, really?
-Can I do my job now?

1795
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:09,136
Oh, really I'm dead man?
I'm dead man?

1796
01:01:09,161 --> 01:01:11,606
Everyone-everyone calm down.
Jesus, come on, come on.

1797
01:01:11,631 --> 01:01:12,880
Juliette, you need a break.
Take a break.

1798
01:01:12,905 --> 01:01:14,123
-I'm okay.
-She okay.

1799
01:01:14,147 --> 01:01:15,834
-Well, I need a break.
-Then you're fired!

1800
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:17,733
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

1801
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:18,859
I know what you say.

1802
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,039
I hear you.

1803
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:21,766
And you, and you.

1804
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,157
-I hear everybody.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1805
01:01:23,182 --> 01:01:24,564
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1806
01:01:24,589 --> 01:01:26,057
Where Markus?
Markus!

1807
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:27,706
This Mar--film now.

1808
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:30,190
This Markus, I hire him
do documentary

1809
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:31,472
"The Making of The Room."

1810
01:01:31,497 --> 01:01:33,378
He capture every comment.

1811
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:35,114
"Oh, yeah, Tommy weird."

1812
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:36,482
"Tommy like Frankenstein."

1813
01:01:36,507 --> 01:01:39,576
"He like, he like vampire rapist."

1814
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:41,351
I hear everything.

1815
01:01:41,376 --> 01:01:42,772
I have ears everywhere.

1816
01:01:42,797 --> 01:01:44,601
I hear your whispers
in your souls.

1817
01:01:44,626 --> 01:01:46,094
You're on my planet.

1818
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:46,931
Okay?

1819
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:49,385
Wait, wait, so you've been
spying on your entire production?

1820
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:50,370
Yeah, that's right.

1821
01:01:50,432 --> 01:01:52,073
That's fucking crazy!

1822
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:53,933
That's how it is.
So now, you know.

1823
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:57,035
Next time you make laughter,
"Ha ha ha ha ha,"

1824
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,817
I don't care who you are,
you're out on street.

1825
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,544
What about me?
Am I still fired?

1826
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,381
All right. I give you
one more chance.

1827
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,624
Take three's up.

1828
01:02:13,405 --> 01:02:14,390
Let's go.

1829
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:16,468
Make sure you see my ass.

1830
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:20,272
-See you at the car?
-'Kay.

1831
01:02:27,884 --> 01:02:29,048
Tommy?

1832
01:02:30,923 --> 01:02:32,228
Tommy, we're leaving.

1833
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:45,024
I feel like um...

1834
01:02:45,049 --> 01:02:47,165
I feel like we should
at least talk about this.

1835
01:02:48,135 --> 01:02:49,619
Look at my arm.

1836
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:51,697
Not bad.

1837
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:53,971
Look like big strong kid.

1838
01:02:55,908 --> 01:02:57,096
Yeah, man.

1839
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,525
All right, I'll uh, I'll see ya.

1840
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:11,010
I haven't seen any water.

1841
01:03:11,283 --> 01:03:12,844
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

1842
01:03:13,204 --> 01:03:14,532
Yeah, fuck this place.

1843
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:15,760
There's no AC in here.

1844
01:03:15,909 --> 01:03:17,338
Too fucking cheap.

1845
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:21,125
Nobody wants to help me.

1846
01:03:21,284 --> 01:03:22,752
And I'm dying.

1847
01:03:22,777 --> 01:03:24,699
Hey, it's like a hundred
fucking degrees in here.

1848
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:25,832
 He show up yet?

1849
01:03:25,862 --> 01:03:27,339
No. I wish.

1850
01:03:27,364 --> 01:03:28,956
Hey, guys, if he doesn't
get in here soon,

1851
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:30,732
I just say we call lunch.
What do you say?

1852
01:03:30,757 --> 01:03:32,098
-Lunch!
-Yeah.

1853
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,062
-You wanna just keep rehearsing?
-Sure, sure.

1854
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:37,749
Um, you're not dying, Mom.

1855
01:03:37,774 --> 01:03:40,335
I got the results
of the tests back.

1856
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,898
I definitely have breast cancer.

1857
01:03:42,923 --> 01:03:44,032
Hi, everybody.

1858
01:03:44,118 --> 01:03:44,892
Oh.

1859
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:45,931
Hey...

1860
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:46,915
-Ready.
-You're here.

1861
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,049
Here camera.

1862
01:03:48,354 --> 01:03:49,596
Okay, you ready?

1863
01:03:49,698 --> 01:03:50,917
Where have you been, man?

1864
01:03:50,956 --> 01:03:53,705
Where have I been? You know.
Just getting ready my apartment.

1865
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,151
I live there alone now.

1866
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,190
-Tommy?
-Got a question?

1867
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:59,073
Does this come back?

1868
01:03:59,151 --> 01:04:00,807
What are, why, what
is she talking about?

1869
01:04:00,832 --> 01:04:02,237
The storyline.

1870
01:04:02,277 --> 01:04:03,996
The breast cancer.

1871
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:05,129
Breast cancer?

1872
01:04:05,154 --> 01:04:06,324
No, it's twist.

1873
01:04:07,162 --> 01:04:08,795
So, it never comes back?

1874
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:11,233
I don't have time to explain
script to you right now, okay?

1875
01:04:11,258 --> 01:04:12,398
What is this?

1876
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:14,695
This makeup. You look like
you're swimming in lake.

1877
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,086
It's a hundred degrees in here.

1878
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:17,009
Makeup!

1879
01:04:17,034 --> 01:04:18,948
Tommy, if you're not gonna
pay for air conditioning,

1880
01:04:18,973 --> 01:04:20,605
you at least have
to pay for water.

1881
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:23,511
Could we maybe just have a little
bit of water before the scene? I...

1882
01:04:23,536 --> 01:04:26,707
Okay, I stop you. I stop
everybody right there, okay?

1883
01:04:26,732 --> 01:04:28,614
Nobody in Hollywood will
give you water either,

1884
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:29,529
-okay?
-That's not true.

1885
01:04:29,554 --> 01:04:31,045
Dude, we can't work like this.

1886
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,029
Well, I'm not
Santa Claus, all right?

1887
01:04:33,054 --> 01:04:35,812
Maybe you go buy water
for everybody, Greg!

1888
01:04:35,837 --> 01:04:36,859
Okay?

1889
01:04:36,884 --> 01:04:39,523
Maybe <i>girlfriend</i> bring you
some water or something.

1890
01:04:39,548 --> 01:04:41,618
We gotta get going, okay.
We're already four hours behind.

1891
01:04:41,643 --> 01:04:43,603
Okay, well, whose fault that?

1892
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:44,665
Yours.

1893
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:46,589
Uh, my fault?

1894
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:47,964
You're late every goddamn day.

1895
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:49,690
All right, that your five cents.

1896
01:04:49,715 --> 01:04:50,802
I'm fucking director.

1897
01:04:50,827 --> 01:04:51,230
Exactly.

1898
01:04:51,505 --> 01:04:51,847
Exactly!

1899
01:04:52,152 --> 01:04:52,551
Exactly!

1900
01:04:52,871 --> 01:04:53,276
Exactly!

1901
01:04:53,301 --> 01:04:54,676
Turn these lights on, right now!

1902
01:04:54,701 --> 01:04:55,770
If I turn on the lights,
it's getting hotter.

1903
01:04:55,795 --> 01:04:57,137
Be professional, do your job!

1904
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,123
You do your job!

1905
01:04:58,148 --> 01:04:59,490
Tommy, it's hot enough as is!

1906
01:04:59,515 --> 01:05:01,006
Greg, so you know
about light too?

1907
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:02,341
Huh? You know everything.

1908
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,703
You know water, light, girlfriend.

1909
01:05:04,728 --> 01:05:06,204
Oh, my God!
Carolyn has fainted!

1910
01:05:06,229 --> 01:05:06,820
Oh, my God!

1911
01:05:06,845 --> 01:05:08,506
Tommy, please get some water?

1912
01:05:08,531 --> 01:05:10,079
Tommy, get the fucking water!
Come on!

1913
01:05:10,104 --> 01:05:11,094
Carolyn?

1914
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,142
What she doing? Taking nap?

1915
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,665
She's not taking a fucking
nap, you fucking idiot!

1916
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:17,049
She passed out!

1917
01:05:17,074 --> 01:05:18,549
-She's dead?
-She's not dead.

1918
01:05:18,574 --> 01:05:20,316
No, I can feel her heartbeat.

1919
01:05:20,341 --> 01:05:22,332
It's not 'cause water,
it's 'cause she's old lady.

1920
01:05:22,357 --> 01:05:23,646
Tommy, please!

1921
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:25,591
You know what?
That's it!

1922
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,593
I'm pullin' the plug!
Turn off the lights!

1923
01:05:27,681 --> 01:05:29,933
Open the doors!
That's lunch!

1924
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:31,791
We're coolin' it out in here.

1925
01:05:31,843 --> 01:05:33,028
She okay? Could
we get the medic?

1926
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,424
Turn off these lights!

1927
01:05:35,189 --> 01:05:36,627
Best thing I could
say about this,

1928
01:05:36,652 --> 01:05:37,617
is nobody will ever see this.

1929
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,078
Would you walk?
We can walk off this...

1930
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:41,258
I'm just tired, is all.

1931
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:43,557
I haven't been sleeping
well recently.

1932
01:05:43,759 --> 01:05:44,938
I'll be fine.

1933
01:05:45,198 --> 01:05:46,513
Hey, can I ask you something?

1934
01:05:46,783 --> 01:05:48,489
Why-why do you do it?

1935
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:51,097
You have a husband,
and grandkids.

1936
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:53,845
You live about fifty
miles from here.

1937
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,843
And you're waking up at 5 a.m.
to drive all this way,

1938
01:05:57,089 --> 01:05:58,300
for what?

1939
01:05:59,233 --> 01:06:01,095
We're actors, Greg.

1940
01:06:01,173 --> 01:06:03,106
You and me, people like us...

1941
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:06,933
even the worst day
on a movie set

1942
01:06:07,076 --> 01:06:09,869
is better than the best day
anywhere else.

1943
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,155
Hey, Greg.

1944
01:06:12,995 --> 01:06:14,503
Can we ask <i>you</i> something?

1945
01:06:14,621 --> 01:06:15,273
Yeah.

1946
01:06:15,456 --> 01:06:17,027
What is this movie about?

1947
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,339
I have a theory.

1948
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:20,597
Oh?

1949
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,222
It's autobiographical.

1950
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:25,737
Someone in his life was
a Denny, a kid brother,

1951
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:27,167
he's looking out for.

1952
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,504
Someone was a Mark,
the better looking friend

1953
01:06:29,529 --> 01:06:30,895
he was always jealous of.

1954
01:06:30,998 --> 01:06:33,568
I'm sure there was a Michelle
and a Mike.

1955
01:06:33,748 --> 01:06:36,779
So, does that mean
that there's a Lisa?

1956
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,419
Somebody who broke his heart,

1957
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,756
and stabbed him in the back,
and ruined his life?

1958
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:42,443
Well, that's pretty
obvious to me.

1959
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:45,348
That's the universe.

1960
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,168
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1961
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:55,973
It's Bryan fucking Cranston!

1962
01:06:56,004 --> 01:06:57,316
Oh, hey, I know him.

1963
01:06:57,426 --> 01:06:59,590
Well, yeah, no shit.
<i>Malcom in the Middle.</i>

1964
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:01,191
No, from pilates.

1965
01:07:01,293 --> 01:07:02,754
-Bryan!
-Wait, what are you--wait.

1966
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:05,332
-Hi!
-Amber! How are you?

1967
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:06,785
-So good to see you.
-You too.

1968
01:07:06,863 --> 01:07:08,254
-You too.
-This is my boyfriend, Greg.

1969
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:09,113
Hi, Greg, how are you?

1970
01:07:09,138 --> 01:07:09,935
Good, yeah.

1971
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,333
Greg is also an actor.

1972
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:12,912
-You are? Cool.
-Yeah.

1973
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:14,797
Anything I would
have seen you in?

1974
01:07:14,922 --> 01:07:16,101
No, I d-doubt it.

1975
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:17,586
You know, it's a journey.

1976
01:07:18,484 --> 01:07:20,250
Are you working on
anything at the moment?

1977
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:22,234
Yeah, yeah, actually,
I'm-I'm doing this movie.

1978
01:07:22,259 --> 01:07:23,851
-Movie? Nice.
-Yeah.

1979
01:07:23,908 --> 01:07:26,494
Yeah, but, you know, I'd love
to do TV at some point.

1980
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:29,892
Yeah, you know, the sitcoms,
drama, cop shows.

1981
01:07:29,978 --> 01:07:32,212
Yeah, y-you name it,
I would do it.

1982
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,939
It's funny you mentioned
that 'cause, um...

1983
01:07:35,454 --> 01:07:37,696
I'm directing an episode
of <i>Malcolm</i> right now.

1984
01:07:37,735 --> 01:07:40,344
Next week, we're shooting this
scene where the boys get lost.

1985
01:07:40,462 --> 01:07:43,180
And Hal and Lois have to
go find them in the woods.

1986
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:45,070
And we're having trouble
finding this...

1987
01:07:45,266 --> 01:07:46,266
lumberjack

1988
01:07:46,423 --> 01:07:47,234
role.

1989
01:07:47,259 --> 01:07:48,399
And you got this...

1990
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:49,594
this beard.

1991
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,758
What do you think? You wanna-
You wanna do it?

1992
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:53,399
Uh, tuh, are you-are
you serious?

1993
01:07:53,477 --> 01:07:55,375
Yeah, well, you know,
everybody needs a break.

1994
01:07:55,469 --> 01:07:56,508
Oh, are you good?

1995
01:07:56,734 --> 01:07:58,399
-I should've asked you that first.
-Yes, yes, yes, no.

1996
01:07:58,469 --> 01:07:59,305
He's very good.

1997
01:07:59,386 --> 01:08:01,323
I'm sorry, I'm freaking out
a little bit! I'm just...

1998
01:08:01,354 --> 01:08:03,627
I'm a big fan.
It's like, it's crazy!

1999
01:08:03,652 --> 01:08:04,972
All right, all right.

2000
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,331
You and the beard, next
Tuesday and Wednesday.

2001
01:08:07,356 --> 01:08:08,175
I will be there.

2002
01:08:08,229 --> 01:08:09,792
-Hey, nice to see you.
-Nice to see you!

2003
01:08:09,903 --> 01:08:11,387
-Thank you, man, seriously, that's...
-You're welcome, you're welcome.

2004
01:08:11,412 --> 01:08:12,326
-See you next week.
-Thanks!

2005
01:08:12,357 --> 01:08:13,263
Thanks again.

2006
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:18,106
Okay. I'm set.

2007
01:08:18,481 --> 01:08:19,325
Action.

2008
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:20,942
Aaah!

2009
01:08:22,005 --> 01:08:24,560
Go to hell, wall!

2010
01:08:29,389 --> 01:08:30,506
Aaah!

2011
01:08:31,873 --> 01:08:32,913
Aaah!

2012
01:08:36,264 --> 01:08:36,959
Aah.

2013
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:41,408
Aah, why?

2014
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:42,861
Why?

2015
01:08:42,947 --> 01:08:45,829
Why is this happening to me?

2016
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:47,017
Why?

2017
01:08:49,194 --> 01:08:50,241
God...

2018
01:08:50,891 --> 01:08:52,157
forgive me.

2019
01:08:56,282 --> 01:08:58,102
Oh...

2020
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,615
Why is he getting back up?

2021
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:05,911
Cut.

2022
01:09:06,028 --> 01:09:07,560
No, don't cut! Don't cut!

2023
01:09:07,903 --> 01:09:09,435
Why you cut, Sandy?
This is great.

2024
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,536
This is real acting.

2025
01:09:10,561 --> 01:09:12,342
If you're gonna writhe
around with a dress,

2026
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:13,670
maybe do it before you
shoot yourself in the head

2027
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:14,779
and blow your brains out.

2028
01:09:14,804 --> 01:09:15,797
I disagree.

2029
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:16,780
We go!

2030
01:09:16,843 --> 01:09:19,000
Okay, still rolling, here we go.

2031
01:09:19,179 --> 01:09:20,195
And action.

2032
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:22,671
Aaaggh...

2033
01:09:23,976 --> 01:09:25,234
Aaah.

2034
01:09:26,991 --> 01:09:27,859
Aaggh!

2035
01:09:28,226 --> 01:09:29,116
Oh...

2036
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:30,249
Aaggh!

2037
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:31,733
I wanted to keep that dress.

2038
01:09:31,758 --> 01:09:33,374
You can <i>never</i>
wear that dress.

2039
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:34,828
Aaggh!

2040
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,797
Aaggh!

2041
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:39,578
Aaggh!

2042
01:09:39,998 --> 01:09:41,537
Okay, now I do kill part.

2043
01:09:41,562 --> 01:09:43,334
Oh, great, yeah,
let's cover that again.

2044
01:09:43,466 --> 01:09:44,646
Give me countdown.

2045
01:09:45,169 --> 01:09:46,247
Three-two-one-bang.

2046
01:09:49,794 --> 01:09:50,568
Wow.

2047
01:09:52,435 --> 01:09:53,388
And cut!

2048
01:09:53,544 --> 01:09:54,380
Think we got it.

2049
01:09:54,405 --> 01:09:55,371
I guess so, yeah.

2050
01:09:55,451 --> 01:09:57,060
Get me a C-stand
over there, please?

2051
01:09:57,637 --> 01:10:00,203
Dude, that was
amazing, man.

2052
01:10:01,152 --> 01:10:02,012
You think so?

2053
01:10:02,037 --> 01:10:05,137
Totally, yeah, it was-it was
raw and intense and...

2054
01:10:05,162 --> 01:10:06,895
Yeah you really
brought it, man, seriously.

2055
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,060
Thank you.

2056
01:10:08,085 --> 01:10:11,510
So, uh, so listen, I-I know-I know
this is last minute, but um...

2057
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:13,304
just wanted to talk to you
about something real quick.

2058
01:10:13,329 --> 01:10:15,546
What is it, Greg? You can see
I'm very busy right now.

2059
01:10:15,571 --> 01:10:18,493
Yeah, um, so-so you know how the
beard-shaving scene is tomorrow?

2060
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:19,727
Yeah, I know the schedule.

2061
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:20,900
Right. Um, so, I was just,

2062
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,041
I was hoping that we could
maybe move it to next week.

2063
01:10:23,066 --> 01:10:25,087
And that I could maybe get
the day off tomorrow.

2064
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:26,676
Why? You sick?

2065
01:10:26,701 --> 01:10:27,465
Oh, no!

2066
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,309
Greg, I can't afford
get sick right now.

2067
01:10:29,334 --> 01:10:30,808
-I'm lead actor, I'm director.
-I feel great, man, It's not that.

2068
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:32,169
It's not. I feel great.

2069
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,810
Then what? Why you need day off?

2070
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:37,021
I actually--I landed a
small role on a TV show.

2071
01:10:37,155 --> 01:10:38,921
It's a <i>Malcolm in the Middle.</i>

2072
01:10:38,946 --> 01:10:42,533
What, you're movie actor now.
Why you do this... this TV?

2073
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:44,501
Well, i-it's kind of a big show.

2074
01:10:44,526 --> 01:10:45,907
You know, it would
be great exposure.

2075
01:10:45,947 --> 01:10:47,587
It would be like a really
good stepping stone

2076
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:48,908
for my career, I think.

2077
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:50,978
What you do in this
little Malcolm?

2078
01:10:51,003 --> 01:10:52,822
I-I'm playing like-like
a lumberjack

2079
01:10:52,847 --> 01:10:54,925
And um, that's like,
that's why the beard,

2080
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,011
that's why I need it,
um, which is,

2081
01:10:57,036 --> 01:10:58,902
which is why
I can't shave tomorrow.

2082
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:00,713
But if we-if we just
move the schedule

2083
01:11:00,738 --> 01:11:02,338
just like-like
a day or two, it would...

2084
01:11:02,682 --> 01:11:03,877
it would really
mean a lot to me.

2085
01:11:03,902 --> 01:11:06,299
Oh, I'm sorry, Greg.
I can't help you.

2086
01:11:06,353 --> 01:11:07,500
Why? What?

2087
01:11:07,525 --> 01:11:09,194
Clean-shaven Mark, you know,

2088
01:11:09,219 --> 01:11:11,764
he make grand entrance
at beginning of third act.

2089
01:11:11,795 --> 01:11:13,115
It's very important.

2090
01:11:13,298 --> 01:11:14,790
-It's metaphor.
-I know.

2091
01:11:14,815 --> 01:11:16,506
I know, but we can just-
we can do it next week

2092
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:18,045
-it's not a big deal.
-No, I can't, Greg!

2093
01:11:18,078 --> 01:11:19,260
It's impossible.
I'm sorry.

2094
01:11:19,331 --> 01:11:20,073
Tommy?

2095
01:11:20,098 --> 01:11:21,682
I can't give you special
treatment, Greg.

2096
01:11:21,707 --> 01:11:23,956
When I can't give special
treatment to everybody.

2097
01:11:23,981 --> 01:11:25,238
Everybody here working hard.

2098
01:11:25,263 --> 01:11:27,832
One favor. I'm just asking for
a tiny favor as a friend.

2099
01:11:27,857 --> 01:11:30,052
Favor, favor, favor.
You always ask favor.

2100
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,467
This is one tiny thing, that's it!

2101
01:11:31,492 --> 01:11:33,421
I take you to Los Angeles,
give you place to stay.

2102
01:11:33,446 --> 01:11:35,186
I write you this part.

2103
01:11:35,351 --> 01:11:37,319
I do this whole movie
for you, Greg?

2104
01:11:37,344 --> 01:11:39,454
You did it for me?
Come on, man.

2105
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:41,469
-For us? We do it together, right?
-Okay, I know.

2106
01:11:41,494 --> 01:11:43,807
Yes, it's our movie.
This doesn't change that.

2107
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:44,963
Don't betray me, Greg.

2108
01:11:44,988 --> 01:11:46,080
I'm not betraying you.

2109
01:11:46,105 --> 01:11:47,463
What I say?
We do this together?

2110
01:11:47,488 --> 01:11:49,097
-Yes.
-We do this together.

2111
01:11:49,122 --> 01:11:50,183
Now you betray me.

2112
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:50,988
I'm not--

2113
01:11:52,343 --> 01:11:54,000
So, are you gonna let
me do it or not?

2114
01:11:54,828 --> 01:11:56,125
Not up to me, Greg.

2115
01:11:56,328 --> 01:11:57,211
Up to you.

2116
01:11:57,437 --> 01:11:58,515
You have to choose.

2117
01:11:58,991 --> 01:12:01,397
You do this TV show,
"Little Malcolm."

2118
01:12:01,733 --> 01:12:02,890
Or you do the movie.

2119
01:12:03,483 --> 01:12:04,976
<i>Our</i> movie, Greg.

2120
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:11,338
Greg.

2121
01:12:15,154 --> 01:12:16,936
-I...
-Unbelievable.

2122
01:12:22,587 --> 01:12:23,899
She had to go?

2123
01:12:37,283 --> 01:12:38,721
Oh!

2124
01:12:39,778 --> 01:12:41,231
Wow.

2125
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:42,278
Hey, guys.

2126
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:43,599
You like it?

2127
01:12:43,849 --> 01:12:46,020
Yeah, you look great.

2128
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,926
Look like... babyface.

2129
01:12:48,044 --> 01:12:49,238
You guys wanna
play some football?

2130
01:12:49,285 --> 01:12:51,669
In tuxes? No. You've
gotta be kidding.

2131
01:12:51,794 --> 01:12:53,254
Mark, come on, let's do it!

2132
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:54,419
I'm up for it.

2133
01:12:54,598 --> 01:12:55,575
Johnny?

2134
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,036
Ask Peter.

2135
01:12:57,638 --> 01:12:59,068
Peter, come on!

2136
01:12:59,177 --> 01:13:00,373
No. I don't think so.

2137
01:13:00,427 --> 01:13:01,326
Please?

2138
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:03,467
-No.
-Come on?

2139
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:05,006
Cheep cheep cheep

2140
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:08,552
-Cheep cheep cheep cheep
-Cheep cheep cheep cheep

2141
01:13:08,646 --> 01:13:09,662
Cheeep cheep cheep

2142
01:13:09,758 --> 01:13:10,602
Cut!

2143
01:13:10,651 --> 01:13:11,620
Cheep cheep

2144
01:13:12,329 --> 01:13:13,391
You good, Tommy?

2145
01:13:14,843 --> 01:13:16,921
Yeah, good day everybody.

2146
01:13:17,117 --> 01:13:18,171
See you tomorrow.

2147
01:13:18,242 --> 01:13:19,617
All right, great job!

2148
01:13:20,821 --> 01:13:21,774
Can't believe it.

2149
01:13:21,846 --> 01:13:24,924
Let's go to a bar
and erase the memory of today.

2150
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:28,578
Hey, Sandy, Raphael.

2151
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:29,250
Yeah?

2152
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:30,593
I talk to you a minute?

2153
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:38,653
Road trip!

2154
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:41,059
San Francisco, here we come.

2155
01:13:41,575 --> 01:13:42,474
Who are these guys?

2156
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:43,985
Oh, that's Todd.

2157
01:13:44,016 --> 01:13:45,297
That's friend of Todd.

2158
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:46,927
And other friend of Todd

2159
01:13:46,992 --> 01:13:48,289
Where's Sandy and Raphael?

2160
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,430
Ah, it's over for those guys.

2161
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,298
Did you fire them?

2162
01:13:52,423 --> 01:13:54,298
Who's to say?
Come on, forget about them!

2163
01:13:54,323 --> 01:13:56,056
-We have Todd now.
-Tommy.

2164
01:13:56,503 --> 01:13:58,284
Look, it's gonna be like the old days.

2165
01:13:58,495 --> 01:13:59,573
San Francisco.

2166
01:13:59,598 --> 01:14:01,573
We take stroll
down memory lane.

2167
01:14:02,057 --> 01:14:04,214
Wait till you see
new script pages, Greg.

2168
01:14:04,276 --> 01:14:05,245
You'll love it.

2169
01:14:05,425 --> 01:14:06,526
Be very dramatic.

2170
01:14:07,237 --> 01:14:08,073
Let's do it.

2171
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,770
Okay, Todd?

2172
01:14:10,528 --> 01:14:12,145
Yeah, you put
camera there, okay?

2173
01:14:12,178 --> 01:14:12,879
Yup, it's here.

2174
01:14:12,943 --> 01:14:14,317
Okay, we threw a ball
over here.

2175
01:14:14,396 --> 01:14:15,990
Come on, Greg. Come on, Greg.

2176
01:14:17,224 --> 01:14:18,349
Remember, Greg?

2177
01:14:18,411 --> 01:14:20,279
We play football
first time we met?

2178
01:14:20,304 --> 01:14:21,481
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

2179
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,325
Okay.

2180
01:14:22,707 --> 01:14:24,543
Okay, Todd? You roll it.

2181
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:25,543
Rolling.

2182
01:14:30,349 --> 01:14:31,591
Tommy, what are we doing here?

2183
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:32,943
We do new scene.

2184
01:14:33,076 --> 01:14:34,193
About Mark failures.

2185
01:14:34,247 --> 01:14:34,935
What?

2186
01:14:34,982 --> 01:14:36,466
Mark want to make
dreams come true

2187
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:38,169
and Johnny help him.

2188
01:14:38,513 --> 01:14:39,982
Yeah, I don't think so, man.

2189
01:14:40,416 --> 01:14:41,641
Let's do it. Come on.

2190
01:14:41,666 --> 01:14:42,923
Take from your real life.

2191
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:45,237
Drop it. Stop.
Don't do this.

2192
01:14:45,964 --> 01:14:47,690
I'm asking you nicely.
Stop it. Drop it.

2193
01:14:47,715 --> 01:14:49,987
Remember, you want
to be actor, but...

2194
01:14:50,042 --> 01:14:52,034
nobody believe in you, Greg...

2195
01:14:52,172 --> 01:14:53,621
you know, you're not
good enough...

2196
01:14:53,654 --> 01:14:55,410
Right? Do that, that stuff.

2197
01:14:55,535 --> 01:14:57,192
What? No, Tommy, drop it.

2198
01:14:57,496 --> 01:14:58,746
Movies are emotion.

2199
01:14:59,192 --> 01:15:00,778
Okay, you need
to be real for us.

2200
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:03,895
Look, Greg...

2201
01:15:04,622 --> 01:15:07,692
frankly, you have not been
that real the whole movie.

2202
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,825
Now you chance.

2203
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:09,730
Fuck you, Tommy.

2204
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:12,066
No one believe in you,
and Mom think you're loser.

2205
01:15:12,215 --> 01:15:12,692
Go!

2206
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:13,465
I said no!

2207
01:15:13,559 --> 01:15:15,918
Greg! Dammit, why you
throw this tricky stuff?

2208
01:15:18,215 --> 01:15:19,785
All right, man,
you wanna get real?

2209
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,797
You wanna get real for the
cameras, let's get real.

2210
01:15:21,822 --> 01:15:24,038
Hey, you guys gettin' this?
Yeah, good.

2211
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:24,983
Let's get real.

2212
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:26,092
Where were you born, Tommy?

2213
01:15:26,117 --> 01:15:26,773
No...

2214
01:15:27,288 --> 01:15:28,600
Greg, that not part of scene.

2215
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:29,992
No way, this is your idea.

2216
01:15:30,017 --> 01:15:32,086
Where are you from?
It's a simple question.

2217
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:34,984
I'm from New Orleans.

2218
01:15:35,122 --> 01:15:36,005
New Orleans.

2219
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,153
From the bayou.

2220
01:15:37,974 --> 01:15:38,832
You guys hear that?

2221
01:15:38,857 --> 01:15:42,075
This guy with this fuckin'
accent is from "the bayou."

2222
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:42,951
Greg...

2223
01:15:43,012 --> 01:15:44,169
Oh, you want an easier question?

2224
01:15:44,364 --> 01:15:45,060
Let's see...

2225
01:15:45,085 --> 01:15:46,763
where does the money
come from, huh?

2226
01:15:46,818 --> 01:15:48,880
Greg, stop! This on camera!

2227
01:15:48,905 --> 01:15:51,505
I know it's on camera
just like you wanted.

2228
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:53,296
All right, just
tell me this one thing...

2229
01:15:53,788 --> 01:15:55,546
How old are you?

2230
01:15:59,695 --> 01:16:00,922
I'm your age, Greg.

2231
01:16:00,947 --> 01:16:01,914
You're my age?

2232
01:16:02,484 --> 01:16:03,461
You're my age?

2233
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:04,585
I'm just your friend.

2234
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:06,593
When were you born?
What year, Tommy?

2235
01:16:06,618 --> 01:16:07,343
Same year as you.

2236
01:16:07,368 --> 01:16:08,236
Same year as me?

2237
01:16:08,261 --> 01:16:11,212
There is no fucking way
you're in your 20's, all right?

2238
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:12,823
You are a fucking villain!

2239
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:14,393
Fucking Frankenstein-looking
motherfucker!

2240
01:16:14,418 --> 01:16:15,417
I not villain!

2241
01:16:19,232 --> 01:16:21,467
I believed in you, man.
I trusted you!

2242
01:16:21,492 --> 01:16:22,709
-Greg!
-What?

2243
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:23,729
Greg...

2244
01:16:24,862 --> 01:16:26,213
I gave you everything.

2245
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,557
Are you fucking--?
You <i>ruined</i> everything!

2246
01:16:28,776 --> 01:16:29,721
Greg!

2247
01:16:31,448 --> 01:16:32,666
You owe me your life!

2248
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,870
Man, I don't owe you
shit anymore.

2249
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,682
All right, and this movie be
fuckin' awesome!

2250
01:16:39,104 --> 01:16:40,221
Will be awesome.

2251
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:43,370
Cut it. Cut it.

2252
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:45,698
Movie over.

2253
01:16:55,889 --> 01:16:59,202
And why am I trying to become
what I don't want to be?

2254
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,398
What am I doing in an office,

2255
01:17:01,427 --> 01:17:05,146
making a-a contemptuous,
begging fool of myself,

2256
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:07,911
when all I want is out there...

2257
01:17:07,936 --> 01:17:10,436
<i>Honey, I am so excited
to come see your play.</i>

2258
01:17:10,632 --> 01:17:13,132
<i>See, acting doesn't
have to be big movies.</i>

2259
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,428
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

2260
01:17:14,453 --> 01:17:16,124
<i>It's probably better
if no one even sees</i>

2261
01:17:16,274 --> 01:17:17,976
<i>that thing you did
with Tommy, right?</i>

2262
01:17:18,039 --> 01:17:19,883
<i>I mean, come on, that
thing can't be any good.</i>

2263
01:17:23,891 --> 01:17:24,696
<i>Greg?</i>

2264
01:17:26,289 --> 01:17:28,797
<i>Are you there...?
Greg?</i>

2265
01:18:03,194 --> 01:18:04,404
You know what I'm saying?

2266
01:18:04,569 --> 01:18:05,584
Hey, good show, guys.

2267
01:18:05,609 --> 01:18:07,334
-That was fun tonight, right?
-Good job.

2268
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,428
All right, see you tomorrow.

2269
01:18:08,957 --> 01:18:10,262
-Hi.
-Hey.

2270
01:18:21,104 --> 01:18:22,378
Babyface.

2271
01:18:23,808 --> 01:18:24,972
You stalking me now?

2272
01:18:25,155 --> 01:18:26,038
Ha ha ha.

2273
01:18:27,138 --> 01:18:28,607
You're not that hard to find.

2274
01:18:31,584 --> 01:18:32,638
Did you watch the show?

2275
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:33,818
No.

2276
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:36,052
You know I don't like comedy.

2277
01:18:36,771 --> 01:18:37,888
So, how Amber?

2278
01:18:39,212 --> 01:18:40,243
I don't know.

2279
01:18:40,899 --> 01:18:42,095
She moved to Austin.

2280
01:18:42,188 --> 01:18:43,430
Didn't work out.

2281
01:18:43,774 --> 01:18:45,227
Sorry to hear this.

2282
01:18:45,657 --> 01:18:46,680
Yeah.

2283
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:50,555
Is that why you came here, Tommy?
You wanted to talk about Amber?

2284
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:51,750
No...

2285
01:18:51,884 --> 01:18:53,602
You didn't RSVP.

2286
01:18:54,446 --> 01:18:56,149
Yeah, I'm not coming.

2287
01:18:57,677 --> 01:18:58,810
And...

2288
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:00,779
honestly, maybe...

2289
01:19:01,062 --> 01:19:03,593
maybe you shouldn't have
a premiere at all.

2290
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,187
Greg.

2291
01:19:06,155 --> 01:19:07,312
We made pact.

2292
01:19:07,858 --> 01:19:08,905
Remember?

2293
01:19:09,538 --> 01:19:11,819
To never lose sight
of our dream.

2294
01:19:12,057 --> 01:19:13,385
Well, on Friday...

2295
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:15,416
they premiere a movie.

2296
01:19:15,814 --> 01:19:17,572
Our movie, Greg.

2297
01:19:17,924 --> 01:19:19,432
In real live theater.

2298
01:19:19,674 --> 01:19:21,361
I know you don't
like me anymore.

2299
01:19:21,447 --> 01:19:22,846
So don't do it for me.

2300
01:19:23,473 --> 01:19:24,934
Do it for you, Greg.

2301
01:19:25,355 --> 01:19:28,301
You'll finally get to
see yourself on big screen.

2302
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:30,910
This was your dream too, Greg.

2303
01:19:52,633 --> 01:19:54,258
What the fuck am I doing?

2304
01:19:57,437 --> 01:19:58,687
Can you believe it?

2305
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:00,507
I can't, no.

2306
01:20:03,476 --> 01:20:04,788
Here, it's for you.

2307
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,744
No, you can-
you can keep that.

2308
01:20:06,775 --> 01:20:08,463
Don't worry,
I made boxes of them.

2309
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:09,814
Okay.

2310
01:20:18,756 --> 01:20:20,146
You think Sandy be there?

2311
01:20:20,818 --> 01:20:21,865
I don't know.

2312
01:20:27,263 --> 01:20:29,138
Holy shit, is this for us?

2313
01:20:30,255 --> 01:20:31,740
Yeah, that's for us.

2314
01:20:31,963 --> 01:20:33,135
Driver, slow down.

2315
01:20:33,182 --> 01:20:34,815
Did you get a fucking spotlight?

2316
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:37,088
Yeah, this real Hollywood
premiere, Greg.

2317
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,299
Raphael, Sandy, Juliette,
everyone's...

2318
01:20:40,324 --> 01:20:41,784
Go, driver, go.
Keep going.

2319
01:20:41,809 --> 01:20:44,378
-What, wait, Tommy, why?
-Go, go, go! Go, keep going.

2320
01:20:47,113 --> 01:20:49,605
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Tommy Wiseau.

2321
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:51,238
-That was fucking weird.
-Yup.

2322
01:20:51,348 --> 01:20:53,497
At this point,
it would be fucking weird

2323
01:20:53,522 --> 01:20:56,294
if he didn't do something
that was fucking weird.

2324
01:20:56,335 --> 01:20:58,116
Tommy, what the
fuck are we doing?

2325
01:20:58,141 --> 01:21:00,475
Well, we gotta build
anticipation.

2326
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:02,513
There not enough people.

2327
01:21:06,076 --> 01:21:06,974
Yup.

2328
01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:09,148
Greg, we are stars of the movie.

2329
01:21:09,234 --> 01:21:10,468
We can't be first one there.

2330
01:21:10,562 --> 01:21:11,773
You're right. You're right.

2331
01:21:11,906 --> 01:21:13,391
And not enough people yet.

2332
01:21:13,688 --> 01:21:14,813
Just trust me.

2333
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,457
Tommy, come on.
We're gonna do this, yeah?

2334
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,278
It's time.

2335
01:21:32,237 --> 01:21:33,643
Is he not gonna
get out of the car?

2336
01:21:33,783 --> 01:21:35,074
The fuck is happening?

2337
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:37,026
Tommy, come on, let's do this.

2338
01:21:38,409 --> 01:21:39,510
You ready?

2339
01:21:40,385 --> 01:21:41,339
Okay.

2340
01:21:42,581 --> 01:21:44,010
Hey, everyone!

2341
01:21:44,218 --> 01:21:46,132
Sorry late, traffic crazy!

2342
01:21:46,257 --> 01:21:47,451
Well, let's go, let's do it.

2343
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,210
No one be nervous.
Come on.

2344
01:21:49,366 --> 01:21:50,366
Let's go.

2345
01:21:50,522 --> 01:21:51,632
Let's do it.

2346
01:21:52,389 --> 01:21:53,593
Come on, Greg.

2347
01:21:54,233 --> 01:21:55,804
The very first premiere.

2348
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,031
You excited?

2349
01:21:57,193 --> 01:21:58,795
Yeah, Tommy, sure.

2350
01:22:02,698 --> 01:22:03,667
Hi.

2351
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:08,698
Wow, this is a day
I never thought would come.

2352
01:22:08,816 --> 01:22:11,019
This is a pretty good
turn out, I gotta say.

2353
01:22:15,332 --> 01:22:16,988
Wow, so many people.

2354
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:18,965
Yeah.

2355
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:20,598
Yeah, it's packed.

2356
01:22:22,783 --> 01:22:24,767
Hey, you play Chris-R, right?

2357
01:22:24,947 --> 01:22:25,783
Yeah, yeah.

2358
01:22:25,837 --> 01:22:27,908
Oh, I didn't recognize you
without the beanie.

2359
01:22:27,954 --> 01:22:28,767
And the beard.

2360
01:22:28,837 --> 01:22:29,853
Oh, yeah.

2361
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:33,110
I play the psychologist, uh, Peter.
I'm in this too.

2362
01:22:33,138 --> 01:22:34,169
-Oh, cool, man.
-Yeah.

2363
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:36,314
I feel like I'm
a little overdressed.

2364
01:22:36,415 --> 01:22:38,251
No, are you kidding me?
You're the star of the movie.

2365
01:22:38,276 --> 01:22:39,821
If I could have your attention.

2366
01:22:40,378 --> 01:22:44,019
Please welcome the writer,
director, producer,

2367
01:22:44,152 --> 01:22:47,467
and star of tonight's
extravaganza.

2368
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,499
His name is Mr. Tommy

2369
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:50,874
Wiseau.

2370
01:23:05,116 --> 01:23:06,874
This my movie.

2371
01:23:07,773 --> 01:23:09,351
And this my life.

2372
01:23:09,921 --> 01:23:10,780
Uh.

2373
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:13,534
Okay, be cool.

2374
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:21,041
I'm so nervous.

2375
01:23:21,315 --> 01:23:22,893
Okay, let's begin!

2376
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:28,133
Whoo!

2377
01:23:28,508 --> 01:23:29,399
Whoo!

2378
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:30,477
W-w-whoo!

2379
01:23:30,563 --> 01:23:31,399
The Room!

2380
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:38,336
Two title cards. Great.

2381
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:39,844
Two logos.

2382
01:23:40,336 --> 01:23:42,258
I noticed. Yeah.

2383
01:23:55,019 --> 01:23:56,363
<i>Hi, babe.</i>

2384
01:24:00,471 --> 01:24:02,322
<i>I have something for you.</i>

2385
01:24:03,181 --> 01:24:04,275
<i>What is it?</i>

2386
01:24:04,392 --> 01:24:05,541
<i>Just a little something.</i>

2387
01:24:11,806 --> 01:24:12,954
<i>Oh.</i>

2388
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,095
<i>Johnny, it's beautiful,
thank you.</i>

2389
01:24:16,587 --> 01:24:19,337
<i>Wow, you look so sexy, Lisa.</i>

2390
01:24:24,513 --> 01:24:25,841
<i>Isn't it fabulous?</i>

2391
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:28,122
<i>I'll do anything
for my girl.</i>

2392
01:24:31,003 --> 01:24:32,096
<i>Oh, hey, guys.</i>

2393
01:24:32,643 --> 01:24:33,964
<i>Oh, hi, Denny.</i>

2394
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,224
<i>Wow.</i>

2395
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:40,700
<i>Look at you!</i>

2396
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:42,864
<i>It's from Johnny.</i>

2397
01:24:43,122 --> 01:24:45,411
<i>Anything for my princess.</i>

2398
01:24:45,481 --> 01:24:46,692
<i>Okay, I'm ready.</i>

2399
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:48,136
<i>It's so pretty,</i>

2400
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:50,005
<i>I can't wait for you
to get it off of me.</i>

2401
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:52,035
<i>Okay, oh, wow.</i>

2402
01:25:02,573 --> 01:25:03,268
<i>Stop!</i>

2403
01:25:03,471 --> 01:25:04,088
<i>Stop it!</i>

2404
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,737
<i>I just like to watch you guys.</i>

2405
01:25:06,126 --> 01:25:06,751
<i>Ooh.</i>

2406
01:25:07,267 --> 01:25:09,048
<i>Denny, Denny, Denny boy.</i>

2407
01:25:09,087 --> 01:25:10,095
I don't like this.

2408
01:25:10,447 --> 01:25:12,478
<i>Two's great but three's a crowd.</i>

2409
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,517
<i>Fine. I have homework
to do anyways.</i>

2410
01:25:18,306 --> 01:25:19,447
<i>Bye, lovebirds.</i>

2411
01:25:19,728 --> 01:25:20,657
<i>Bye, Denny.</i>

2412
01:25:20,978 --> 01:25:23,486
So, what's his
relationship to you guys?

2413
01:25:27,966 --> 01:25:29,974
Oh, no. No, no, no.

2414
01:25:36,661 --> 01:25:37,770
Oh!

2415
01:25:38,152 --> 01:25:39,004
Ugh!

2416
01:25:52,232 --> 01:25:53,162
<i>Hi.</i>

2417
01:25:53,326 --> 01:25:54,334
<i>Can I help you?</i>

2418
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,943
<i>Yeah, can I have a dozen
red roses, please?</i>

2419
01:25:57,162 --> 01:25:58,857
<i>Oh, hi, Johnny, I didn't
know it was you.</i>

2420
01:25:58,951 --> 01:26:00,318
Who doesn't recognize that guy?

2421
01:26:00,459 --> 01:26:01,427
<i>Here you go.</i>

2422
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:03,677
<i>That's me.
How much is it?</i>

2423
01:26:03,755 --> 01:26:04,678
<i>It'll be $18.</i>

2424
01:26:04,724 --> 01:26:06,256
<i>Here you go. Keep the change.</i>

2425
01:26:06,318 --> 01:26:07,177
<i>Hi, doggie!</i>

2426
01:26:07,248 --> 01:26:08,443
<i>You're my favorite customer.</i>

2427
01:26:09,076 --> 01:26:10,295
<i>Thanks a lot. Bye.</i>

2428
01:26:10,412 --> 01:26:12,365
<i>Nobody wanted to help me.</i>

2429
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:13,920
<i>And I'm dying.</i>

2430
01:26:14,643 --> 01:26:16,433
<i>You're not dying, Mom.</i>

2431
01:26:17,792 --> 01:26:20,242
<i>I got the results
of the tests back.</i>

2432
01:26:20,523 --> 01:26:22,687
<i>I definitely have
breast cancer.</i>

2433
01:26:22,773 --> 01:26:25,813
It never comes back.
I don't know why I say that.

2434
01:26:26,031 --> 01:26:28,851
Is it-is it just me,
or is this kinda bad?

2435
01:26:29,024 --> 01:26:30,399
Oh, yeah, it's bad.

2436
01:26:45,142 --> 01:26:46,658
It's still going?

2437
01:26:49,669 --> 01:26:53,942
<i>Why, Lisa? Why, Lisa?
Please talk to me, please!</i>

2438
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:57,316
<i>You're part of my life.</i>

2439
01:26:57,621 --> 01:26:59,043
<i>You're everything.</i>

2440
01:26:59,223 --> 01:27:01,371
<i>You are lying.
I never hit you.</i>

2441
01:27:01,715 --> 01:27:04,270
<i>You are tearing me apart, Lisa!</i>

2442
01:27:04,488 --> 01:27:06,246
<i>Why are you so hysterical?</i>

2443
01:27:06,316 --> 01:27:08,941
<i>Do you understand why?
Do you?</i>

2444
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:15,761
<i>Where's my money?</i>

2445
01:27:15,873 --> 01:27:17,694
<i>Where's my fucking
money, Denny?!</i>

2446
01:27:17,764 --> 01:27:19,037
<i>Get off Denny!</i>

2447
01:27:19,732 --> 01:27:23,115
<i>You have no idea what kind of
trouble you're in here, do you?</i>

2448
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:24,529
<i>I owe him some money.</i>

2449
01:27:24,678 --> 01:27:25,842
<i>What kind of money?</i>

2450
01:27:26,578 --> 01:27:28,273
<i>What kind of money?</i>

2451
01:27:30,484 --> 01:27:32,125
<i>Go. Go deep!</i>

2452
01:27:35,069 --> 01:27:36,186
<i>I did not hit her.</i>

2453
01:27:36,272 --> 01:27:37,350
<i>It's not true.</i>

2454
01:27:37,436 --> 01:27:38,342
<i>It's bullshit.</i>

2455
01:27:38,483 --> 01:27:39,670
<i>I did not hit her.</i>

2456
01:27:39,909 --> 01:27:41,776
<i>I did naaht.</i>

2457
01:27:42,433 --> 01:27:43,589
<i>Oh, hi, Mark.</i>

2458
01:27:59,485 --> 01:28:00,782
<i>Don't touch me, Mark.</i>

2459
01:28:01,212 --> 01:28:02,048
<i>Get out.</i>

2460
01:28:02,073 --> 01:28:03,079
<i>Stop it!</i>

2461
01:28:05,665 --> 01:28:06,806
<i>I kill you!</i>

2462
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:08,683
<i>I break every bone in your body!</i>

2463
01:28:11,472 --> 01:28:12,777
<i>You betray me.</i>

2464
01:28:12,808 --> 01:28:15,457
<i>You're not good.
You're just chicken.</i>

2465
01:28:15,527 --> 01:28:17,027
<i>Cheep cheep cheep cheep</i>

2466
01:28:21,402 --> 01:28:22,730
<i>Get out of my house.</i>

2467
01:28:26,695 --> 01:28:27,890
<i>It's not over.</i>

2468
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,507
<i>Everybody betray me.</i>

2469
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:31,250
<i>I'm fed up with this world.</i>

2470
01:28:38,213 --> 01:28:39,081
Hey, Tommy.

2471
01:28:40,135 --> 01:28:41,167
They hate it.

2472
01:28:42,838 --> 01:28:43,698
I know.

2473
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,631
I know, they're...

2474
01:28:46,248 --> 01:28:47,537
They're just-
they're just laughing.

2475
01:28:47,775 --> 01:28:48,924
Yeah, they're laughing.

2476
01:28:49,385 --> 01:28:50,588
Laughing at me.

2477
01:28:52,638 --> 01:28:55,669
Maybe it's true, you know.
Maybe everybody right, maybe...

2478
01:28:55,802 --> 01:28:58,208
Maybe I just big joke.
Ha ha.

2479
01:28:58,341 --> 01:28:59,341
Come on, Tommy.

2480
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:02,743
I tried to open my heart,
show them my soul, and...

2481
01:29:03,033 --> 01:29:04,252
they just hate me.

2482
01:29:05,019 --> 01:29:06,831
Even you hate me, Greg.

2483
01:29:11,874 --> 01:29:13,577
Hey, hey, hey.

2484
01:29:14,468 --> 01:29:15,671
Listen to me, all right?

2485
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:17,123
All right, that thing up there?

2486
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,575
That's <i>your</i> movie.

2487
01:29:18,739 --> 01:29:19,857
<i>You</i> made that.

2488
01:29:20,224 --> 01:29:22,630
All right, like you said,
you did that all by yourself.

2489
01:29:22,841 --> 01:29:24,114
You know how special that is?

2490
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:25,286
Well...

2491
01:29:25,431 --> 01:29:26,907
Hey, it's fucking incredible.

2492
01:29:27,364 --> 01:29:29,559
How many people can say
they've done something like that?

2493
01:29:29,825 --> 01:29:30,903
I don't know.

2494
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:32,514
1,000?

2495
01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:36,220
And yeah, maybe it didn't turn out
exactly as you hoped.

2496
01:29:36,275 --> 01:29:38,111
But just listen for a second.

2497
01:29:45,911 --> 01:29:47,700
Sound like they're loud.

2498
01:29:48,661 --> 01:29:49,927
All right, come here.

2499
01:29:59,481 --> 01:30:01,068
Look how much fun
they're having.

2500
01:30:02,162 --> 01:30:03,787
They fucking love it, man.

2501
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:07,154
<i>Aaaggh!</i>

2502
01:30:08,102 --> 01:30:11,008
<i>Why, Lisa? Why? Why?</i>

2503
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:19,148
How often do you think Hitchcock
got a response like this?

2504
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:22,098
Never.

2505
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:44,085
<i>You bitch!</i>

2506
01:30:44,445 --> 01:30:46,148
<i>You bitch!</i>

2507
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,763
Greg.

2508
01:30:58,013 --> 01:30:59,317
Why you help me?

2509
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:03,669
'Cause we're friends.

2510
01:31:05,978 --> 01:31:07,252
<i>Why?</i>

2511
01:31:07,627 --> 01:31:09,572
<i>Why is this happening to me?</i>

2512
01:31:09,689 --> 01:31:11,971
Here we go!
"Why?"

2513
01:31:13,393 --> 01:31:14,565
<i>It's over.</i>

2514
01:31:18,643 --> 01:31:19,651
<i>God...</i>

2515
01:31:20,635 --> 01:31:21,878
Do it!

2516
01:31:22,127 --> 01:31:23,697
Whooo!

2517
01:31:23,985 --> 01:31:24,518
Do it!

2518
01:31:24,776 --> 01:31:25,331
Do it!

2519
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:29,275
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

2520
01:31:51,986 --> 01:31:55,861
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!
Tommy! Tommy!

2521
01:31:56,212 --> 01:31:57,392
Go, man!

2522
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,004
Okay.

2523
01:32:22,972 --> 01:32:23,918
Wow.

2524
01:32:24,465 --> 01:32:26,543
I'm glad you like my
comedic movie!

2525
01:32:27,147 --> 01:32:28,975
Exactly how I intended.

2526
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:31,678
You know...

2527
01:32:32,069 --> 01:32:34,014
I have vision for this movie.

2528
01:32:34,769 --> 01:32:35,761
But...

2529
01:32:37,066 --> 01:32:38,894
I never make this movie...

2530
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,246
without my friend.

2531
01:32:41,573 --> 01:32:43,496
We followed our dream.

2532
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,245
Come down here, Babyface!

2533
01:32:50,924 --> 01:32:52,487
Come on, Babyface!

2534
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:10,547
I never be able to make this
movie without my best friend.

2535
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:13,234
We do it together.

2536
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:14,441
Hey!

2537
01:33:14,559 --> 01:33:15,754
The Room!

2538
01:34:51,859 --> 01:34:52,999
Hi.

2539
01:34:53,101 --> 01:34:53,960
Can I help you?

2540
01:34:54,101 --> 01:34:56,499
Yeah, can I have a dozen
red roses, please?

2541
01:34:56,679 --> 01:34:58,484
Oh, hi, Johnny,
I didn't know it was you.

2542
01:34:58,781 --> 01:35:01,694
Everything goes wrong at once.

2543
01:35:01,772 --> 01:35:03,859
Nobody wants to help me.

2544
01:35:03,999 --> 01:35:05,194
And I'm dying.

2545
01:35:33,355 --> 01:35:34,848
I can't talk right now.

2546
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:39,563
Why, Lisa? Why, Lisa?
Please talk to me, please!

2547
01:35:39,864 --> 01:35:42,294
You are part of my life.
You are everything.

2548
01:35:42,341 --> 01:35:44,911
I could not go on
without you, Lisa.

2549
01:35:50,393 --> 01:35:52,081
I mean, the candles...

2550
01:35:52,542 --> 01:35:53,870
the music...

2551
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:56,228
the sexy dress, I mean...

2552
01:35:56,477 --> 01:35:57,868
what's going on here?

2553
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:00,347
You're not dying, Mom.

2554
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:03,038
I got the results
of the tests back.

2555
01:36:03,147 --> 01:36:05,569
I definitely have breast cancer.

2556
01:36:05,881 --> 01:36:07,740
You have nice legs, Lisa.

2557
01:36:08,373 --> 01:36:10,225
You have nice pecs.

2558
01:36:10,457 --> 01:36:11,387
Ha ha ha.

2559
01:36:12,082 --> 01:36:13,981
I'm tired.

2560
01:36:14,006 --> 01:36:15,450
I'm wasted.

2561
01:36:15,489 --> 01:36:17,340
I love you, darling.

2562
01:36:17,595 --> 01:36:19,314
Come on, make love to me.

2563
01:36:19,515 --> 01:36:20,594
Aw.

2564
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:22,453
Come on, you owe me one.

2565
01:36:25,711 --> 01:36:27,235
I love you, Lisa.

2566
01:36:27,879 --> 01:36:29,043
Go!

2567
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:36,599
Gee, Peter, you're clumsy.

2568
01:36:36,896 --> 01:36:38,505
Ah, that's it, I'm done.

2569
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:39,988
Great idea, Denny.

2570
01:36:44,784 --> 01:36:46,221
I like you.

2571
01:36:46,443 --> 01:36:47,880
Very much.

2572
01:36:48,521 --> 01:36:50,630
Lover. Boy.

2573
01:36:51,326 --> 01:36:52,982
What are you doing this for?

2574
01:36:54,373 --> 01:36:55,670
What's the matter?

2575
01:36:56,784 --> 01:36:57,995
Don't you like me?

2576
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:00,620
I'm your girl.

2577
01:37:06,751 --> 01:37:08,892
Johnny's my best friend.

2578
01:37:08,994 --> 01:37:11,166
You're gonna be married
next month, come on!

2579
01:37:11,846 --> 01:37:13,338
You're scaring me.

2580
01:37:13,697 --> 01:37:16,205
You are lying, I never hit you.

2581
01:37:16,344 --> 01:37:18,883
You are tearing me apart, Lisa!

2582
01:37:18,962 --> 01:37:20,766
Why are you so hysterical?

2583
01:37:20,852 --> 01:37:22,602
Do you understand why?

2584
01:37:23,243 --> 01:37:24,352
Do you?

2585
01:37:31,223 --> 01:37:32,113
I did not hit her.

2586
01:37:32,199 --> 01:37:33,371
It's not true.

2587
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:34,473
It's bullshit.

2588
01:37:34,551 --> 01:37:35,535
I did not hit her.

2589
01:37:35,653 --> 01:37:37,442
I did naaaht.

2590
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:39,231

Hi, feeling fine. Why you ask?

2669
01:42:17,236 --> 01:42:18,798
Why you standing
against the wall?

2670
01:42:18,853 --> 01:42:21,548

on wall, no big deal.

2671
01:42:21,587 --> 01:42:23,001
Why you so lonely, tell me.

2672
01:42:23,048 --> 01:42:25,540
What? I'm just standing here alone.
Don't mean I'm lonely.

2673
01:42:25,565 --> 01:42:27,025
You need help.
I-I see it.

2674
01:42:27,088 --> 01:42:29,128
It's not pity party.
It's just party.

2675
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:30,307
You wanna go with me?

2676
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:31,268
Go where?

2677
01:42:31,293 --> 01:42:32,239
To my house.

2678
01:42:33,446 --> 01:42:34,938
I'm not going anywhere with you.

2679
01:42:34,974 --> 01:42:36,661
You think you have long hair,
you own the world?

2680
01:42:36,686 --> 01:42:37,615
That's the idea?

2681
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,466
I stop you,
I stop you right there.

2682
01:42:39,677 --> 01:42:41,669
What is this accent?
It sound familiar.

2683
01:42:41,694 --> 01:42:42,779
You from New Orleans?

2684
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:44,466
Yeah, so what?

2685
01:42:44,513 --> 01:42:45,357
What the part?

2686
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:46,208
Chalmette.

2687
01:42:46,255 --> 01:42:47,177
I love New Orleans.

2688
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:48,334
You know where Chalmette?

2689
01:42:48,404 --> 01:42:49,123
Yah.

2690
01:42:49,193 --> 01:42:50,084
Okay, cool.

2691
01:42:50,334 --> 01:42:51,709
You wanna drink or something?

2692
01:42:51,994 --> 01:42:53,986
No, I'm not-
I'm not thirsty either.

2693
01:42:54,011 --> 01:42:55,119
I just want to stand here.

2694
01:42:55,159 --> 01:42:56,173
What's your name, hmm?

2695
01:42:56,198 --> 01:42:56,964
Tommy, right?

2696
01:42:56,989 --> 01:42:57,753
Yah.

2697
01:42:57,886 --> 01:42:59,940
My name Tommy, with capital
Go Away.

2698
01:42:59,981 --> 01:43:00,839
It's okay.

2699
01:43:00,901 --> 01:43:02,097
Have a nice one.

2700
01:43:02,267 --> 01:43:03,126
Okay?

2701
01:43:03,315 --> 01:43:04,134
Okay.

2702
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:05,512
Okay. Bye!

2703
01:43:05,997 --> 01:43:06,762
'Kay.

2704
01:43:07,235 --> 01:43:09,001
People are very
strange this day.

2705
01:43:09,165 --> 01:43:10,383
Oh, hi, Betty.

2706
01:43:12,165 --> 01:43:13,243
My God.

2707
01:43:15,839 --> 01:43:17,222
What these friends Greg have.
