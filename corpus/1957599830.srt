[orchestral music playing]

2
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,185
I just wanna know one thing,
Frito.

3
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,814
Who was the guy
sitting next to Don Ding-dong?

4
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:07,734
It was his brother,
Don Twinkie-knee.

5
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:12,573
[Don Frito] He is a food chief
in another country.

6
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,992
[Mary Kay] You always win,
don't you Frito?

7
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,577
[Mary Kay] You always win.

8
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,996
It was between the brothers.

9
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,582
I had nothing to do with it.

10
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,625
[Mary Kay]
I'm going to leave you, Frito.

11
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,088
I'm going to take your children,
born and unborn.

12
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,384
[Don Frito]
You're not taking my children.

13
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,304
[Don Frito]
You're not taking my children!

14
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,808
[whoosh]

15
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,352
[Don Frito coughs]

16
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,147
[Don Frito] Don't you know
I could never allow it?

17
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,734
That I would use
everything in my power

18
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,986
to keep that
from ever happening?

19
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,115
[Don Frito] I don't think you
blame me for your miscarriage.

20
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,621
For having sent you
to the fat farm to lose weight,

21
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:06,168
since I don't allow you to eat
anything other than junk food.

22
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,213
But I can change!

23
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,256
Mary Kay...

24
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,968
If history
has taught us anything,

25
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,764
everything can change!

26
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,849
You don't get it, do you?

27
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,393
It wasn't a miscarriage, Frito!

28
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,937
It was an abortion!

29
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,564
An attempt at abortion.

30
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,401
They were twin boys, Frito.

31
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,403
Two sons!

32
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,782
[Mary Kay] But I've taken them,

33
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,409
and I've hidden them
away from you someplace safe!

34
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,037
Someplace you'll never
find them!

35
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,580
Where are my boys?

36
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,832
[Don Frito] Where are my boys?

37
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,125
-[Mary Kay] No!

[Kennedy laughs]

41
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,633
One of these days, Marilyn

42
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,636
this rocket will launch
a man to the moon!

43
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,720
[Marilyn] Really?

44
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,057
[Marilyn]
Jack, can I touch your rocket?

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,600
-[Kennedy] Sure.
-[Marilyn swoons]

46
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:08,188
[Marilyn] Oh, Jack!
Launch me into orbit!

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,441
[Kennedy]
Oh my god, it's Jackie!

49
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,110
[Kennedy] If she finds you here,
we're both through!

50
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,278
-[Marilyn shrieks]
-[Kennedy] You have to go!

51
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,362
[Marilyn] Where?

52
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,030
[Kennedy]
Anywhere! No, this way!

53
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,156
-[Marilyn] But, I thought--

Jack!

56
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,704
[Kennedy] Oh, thank god!
I thought you were Jackie!

57
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,373
In the bedroom?

58
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,083
I'm so glad to see you!
Is everything okay?

59
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,752
Well, yes, I had twins!

60
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,379
Two boys!

61
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,131
I think they're boys.

62
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,382
Are they mine?

63
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,720
[Mary Kay laughs]
No, they're Don Frito's.

64
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,263
-[choir singing]
-[Kennedy] Thank god!

65
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,557
[Kennedy]
I mean... thank god they're his!

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,641
[Kennedy] I-- Healthy!

67
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,560
[Kennedy]
They are healthy, aren't they?

68
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,812
They have great hair!

69
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,148
[Mary Kay crying]

70
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,150
I just didn't know
where to turn to!

71
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,235
I just didn't know who to see!

72
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,324
-[Kennedy] Now, now.
-[Mary Kay] Sorry. I'm sorry.

73
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,038
[blowing nose]

74
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,210
[Mary Kay] Thank you.

75
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,544
I'm sorry!

76
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:14,838
[Kennedy] Now, now, now.

77
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,340
[Kennedy] If I can't help
the gorgeous women

78
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,883
whom I'm intimately
involved with

79
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,344
with their problems,
then what good am I?

80
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,054
Are you sure?

81
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,305
Sure, I'm sure!

82
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,015
[Kennedy] Why, um...

83
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,559
There was this Vietnamese girl
I was seeing once.

84
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,144
She had a problem
with a fella back home.

85
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,979
I sent in the troops!

86
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,773
-[snap]
-It'll be over like that!

87
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,775
[Mary Kay giggles]

88
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,736
I just didn't want
little Angelo and little Michael

89
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,321
to be raised his way.

90
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,697
The Frito way.

91
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,533
So, I hid them and...

92
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,243
The next thing I know,

93
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,328
he told me
he was gonna murder me

94
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,956
if I didn't tell her
where those kids were!

95
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,582
[Kennedy] Well, where are they?

96
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,459
They're with my grandparents,

97
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,503
[Mary Kay]
They helped with the delivery.

98
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,712

[Miserio] Come on! Alright!

105
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,309
[Miserio] One more time, now!

106
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,520
And a one, and a two...

[Miserio] Hey, wait!

112
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,404
[Miserio] It's a boy!

113
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,281
[Miserio] It's a boy!
What a peeshadel!

114
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,575
It's a beautiful peeshadel!

[Al Dente gasps] Whoa, wait!

116
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,036
Wait a minucce!

117
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,538
[Miserio] I see another head!

118
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,456
Or maybe it's an ass?
I no can tell!

I didn't know your grandparents
were still alive.

125
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,054
Somewhat.

126
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,017
My grandfather, he's great.
His name's Miserio.

127
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,060
He came from the old country.

[Kennedy] That's the greatness
of this country.

131
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,942
[Mary Kay] He was a politician,
too, you know?

132
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,111

He was a great speaker.

The United States of Antarctica!

The land of opportunity!

137
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,373
Ask not what your country
can do for you,

138
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,503
but ask what you can do
for yourself!

139
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,296
-[applause]
-[Miserio] Capisce?

140
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,382
Not bad!

That's not bad at all!

142
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,428
Listen. Here's what
I want you to do.

143
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,473
Michael and Angelo...

144
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,058
They're safe
with your grandparents, right?

145
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,643
-[Mary Kay] Yes.
-[Kennedy] Leave them there.

146
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,853
I'm going to send you away
for a little while.

147
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,440
There's this lovely
little island paradise

148
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,608
off the coast of Florida.

149
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,109
It's called Cuba.

150
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:42,986
You'll love it there.

151
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,864
I'll take care of Don Frito.

Frito's a dangerous man!

154
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,413
[Mary Kay] What if he finds me?

155
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,499
[Mary Kay] What if he hurts you?

156
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,583
[Kennedy laughs]

157
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,253
Mary Kay, what could possibly
happen to me?

158
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,296
I'm the president!

Jeez, it's hot out here!

181
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,309
[Redwood] The bus should be
coming along soon.

182
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,394
[Michael]
Yeah, I'm sure it will,

183
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,728
but, listen, until it gets here,

184
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,231
you don't mind if we tell you
a bit about ourselves, do ya?

185
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,733
[Michael] We're twin brothers.

186
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,527
[Angelo]
Yeah, the Misery brothers!

187
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,611
[Michael] To know about us,

188
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,655
you gotta understand
about our family.

189
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,448
[Michael]
It always starts with family.

190
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,326
The heads of
the other junk food families,

191
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,704
Don Dorito, Don Cheeto,
Don Pretzel,

192
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,582
are very angry
about our cutting prices!

193
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,626
There will be slashing
and bloodshed

194
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,045
in the marketplace
in retaliation!

195
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,425
And there's even rumors

196
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,469
of an all-out war
between the families!

197
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,555
Maybe federal intervention!

198
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:01,852
You've got to make some small
token concession!

199
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,522
A billion-dollar donation
to the FDA

200
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,482
would buy us some valuable time!

201
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,652
[chair creaking]

202
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,323
You come to my home...

203
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,202
...on the day
I am to be reunited

204
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,871
with my forever lost sons.

205
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:28,504
And you ask me to commit
the ultimate sin.

206
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:35,260
Voluntary giving money
to the federal government!

207
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,435
What's the matter with you?
Are you...?

208
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,439
Am I what?

209
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,110
[Don Frito] I can't remember the
last time you came to my house

210
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,612
for a cup of coffee!

211
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,615
[advisor]
You don't drink coffee!

212
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,538
[advisor] Can I be your special
friend, Fairy Godfather?

213

[Don Frito groans]

214
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:15,759
Keep going.

215
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,345
Up the arm!

All the way!

[Don Frito moans]

220
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,820
[Don Frito] Finally, I can drop
the manly mumble voice,

221
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,865
this masquerade
I've been leading!

222
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,701
I can come out of the cupboard
and say,

223
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,786
"I want to be me!"

227
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,548
It's nothing personal!

228
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,884
Strictly business!

229
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,473

It seems that our associates
have finally had some luck

in finding your sons.

249
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,800
You mean I'll finally have heirs
to the Frito fortune?

250
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,719
Someone to rely on?

251
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,222
To manage my affairs?

252
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,184
Someone that can carry on
the Frito way?

Family tradition?

254
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,940
No... but you do have two sons.

255
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,942
Tell me! What are they like?

256
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,319
Handsome?

Powerful?

258

Masculine men?

259
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,618
The type that can walk
into a room

260
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,745
and everyone notices them?

261
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,123
The type of men that,

262
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:55,794
when you meet them,
you can never forget them?

263
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,797
Are my boys like that?

got a bad heart!

No problem!

I can't tell you how long
I've waited for this moment!

-[Don Frito] No, no, no!

Please don't speak!
Don't ever speak!

Where was I? What was I saying?

292
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,073
You were saying,

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,491
[Luke mimicking Don Frito]
"How I can't wait

294
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,869

for a brief moment,

[crowd] Praise the lord!

359
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,291
-[Scheister] Hallelujah!
-[crowd] Hallelujah!

360
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,627
Glory, glory! Hallelujah!

361
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,711
[cheers]

362
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:30,796
Walk a dog!

363
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,089
[crowd] Walk a dog!

364
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,173
[Scheister] Take out the trash!

365
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,675
[crowd] Take out the trash!

366
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,176
Yeah!

367
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,929
And that's the reason
we are here today!

368
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,180
[crowd] Praise the lord!

369
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:41,682
Quiet!

370
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,809
[Scheister]
I wanna hear a pin drop!

371
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,020
[ding]

372
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,731
[Scheister laughing] Now...

373
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,943
As I was attempting to say,

374
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,027
[crowd] Yeah?

375
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:58,240
[Scheister] We are here today
to show our disrespect!

376
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,201
Our final disrespect!

377
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,286
[woman] I'm over it!

378
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,621
To a man, known to us all...

379
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,374
...as Jeffrey Dahmer.

380
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,917
[Angelo]
We're at the wrong funeral!

381
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,086
[Scheister mumbling]

382
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,921
[Scheister laughs] No, no, no.

383
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,506
As, uh...

384
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,218
Don Frito Layleone!

385
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,595
[crowd jeers]

386
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:20,679
[Michael] Yeah.

387
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,765
[Scheister] Don Frito Layleone

388
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:29,104
was a great and filthy rich man!

389
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,481
[crowd cheering]

390
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,608
Yes, he was!

391
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,612
He gave freely
of his colossal wealth

392
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,365
to all those causes

393
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:44,453
in which he truly believed
he could buy!

394
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:49,333
[Scheister] But...
he died before his mission,

395
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,253
our mission, was complete!

396
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,884
And now, due to certain
accounting errors...

397
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,011
[Angelo] Who did he have
working for him?

398
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,679
[Scheister] ...our beloved
Second Son of Mary

399
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,849
needs seven million dollars...

400
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,142
[Angelo] That's a lot of money!

401
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,520
[Scheister] ...to keep
it's divine doors open!

402
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,940
The church needs this money!

403
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:16,235
I need this money!

404
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,319
[woman] Wait a minute!

405
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,696
Just last night,

406
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:23,408
the lord almighty, himself,

407
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,745
in his infinite voice,

408
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:29,623
spoke to me!

409
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,333
[crowd cheers]

410
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,211
Saying, "Scheister!"

411
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,504
[crowd] Scheister!

412
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,130
"Scheister!"

413
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,465
[crowd] Scheister!

414
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,260
"If you don't get that money

415
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,096
by noon, next Sunday,

416
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,932
I will strike you dead!"

417
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,059
[zapping]

418
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,436
[Scheister grumbling]

419
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,397
[Scheister shouts]

420
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,733
His hair looks like Don King!

421
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,320
[Scheister]
One, two, three, four!

422
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,824
[choir singing]

423
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,257
-[Michael sobbing]

424
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,680
-[bam]
-[Michael] Whoa!

425
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,975
[audience clapping]

426
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,903
[car brakes screech]

427
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,071
[loud car horn]

428
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,156
[crunch]

429
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,328
The reason I called
you all here today

430
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,705
Is for the reading
of Don Frito Layleone's

431
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,373
last will and testament.

432
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,167
[Scheister]
Old Testament or New Testament?

433
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:56,710
[lawyer] Latest Testament.

434
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,128
Let's hear what he has to say.

435
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,213
[click]

436
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,133
[Don Frito] I hereby confess
to the murders of--

437
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,218
[click]

438
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:08,972
[tape player squeaking]

439
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,433
[Don Frito]
I, Don Frito Layleone,

440
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,646
being of somewhat sound mind
and out-of-shape body,

441
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:19,983
do hereby bequeath
my entire junk food empire

442
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,402
to my only know living heirs.

443
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,239
[Don Frito] My two sons,
Michael and Angelo.

444
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,740
-[Michael] No way!
-[Angelo] Way!

445
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,744
[Don Frito] However,
there are two conditions.

446
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:32,204
[Don Frito] One...

447
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:35,958
[Don Frito] The two of you
cannot be convicted of a felony

448
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,459
for a period of one year.

449
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,752
[Don Frito] Two...

450
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,505
[Don Frito] You both
must be married within one year

451
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,216
in order to intend
to bear children

452
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,510
and carry on the family name.

453
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:50,722
[Don Frito] In the event either
of these conditions are not met,

454
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,184
my entire estate
will then be bequeathed

455
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,436
to the Second Son
of Mary Church.

456
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,438
[Scheister] Hallelujah!

457
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,190
[Scheister laughing]

458
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:01,358
[Don Frito] Amen.

459
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:05,362
[laughing continues]

460
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,118
[rustling]

461
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,494
[Angelo] Ain't life grand?

462
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,830
[Angelo] Our whole lives,
we've only had each other.

463
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,915
[Angelo] Our morals, our pride,

464
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,293
our dignity,
our self-worthlessness.

465
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,045
[Michael] Yeah, now we have
200 million dollars!

466
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,006
[Michael and Angelo laugh]

467
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,009
[Angelo] Hey, you don't think
we'll change, do ya Mike?

468
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,180
You can take a Misery
out of the sewer,

469
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:34,141
but you can never
get rid of the stench.

470
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,727
Yeah, I guess you're right.

471
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,188
You don't think Daddy
would be upset with us

472
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,857
for knocking over his casket
and getting run over by a truck,

473
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,025
do you?

474
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,611
No, these things happen
from time to time.

475
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,654
I know, but I still feel guilty,

476
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,448
him having to be cremated
and all.

477
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,117
I'm sure he wanted to be buried
here at Frito Lawn

478
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,493
with the rest
of his dead family.

479
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,705
Ang, put yourself in his shoes.

480
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:58,707
Okay.

481
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:07,007
If your body was mangled,

482
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,342
your head decapitated

483
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,552
massive chunks
of your face missing,

484
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,429
because they were ground up
by a truck axel.

485
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,265
Would you want to be put
in the ground looking like that?

486
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,768
Next to people who know you?

487
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,062
Yeah, I guess you're right.

488
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,356
[Michael] Of course I'm right!
It's better this way!

489
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,192
Look, he'll be happier here,
amongst his family!

490
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,653
People who know him and love him
for what he's done for us!

491
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,030
Yeah...

492
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:32,616
[Michael] Come on. Let's find
somewhere nice to put him.

493
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,243
[Michael] Somewhere comfy.

494
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,914
Operation Date-Bait
is ready to ramble.

495
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:39,998
Here's the plan.

496
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:41,667
The girls come over,

497
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,127
and our two bozos will think
they're doing good with them.

498
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,838
The girls have been instructed

499
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:47,798
to compliment them
at every opportunity

500
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,508
and laugh at
all of their jokes.

501
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,179
Soon, after a little dancing,
a little dinner,

502
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:55,973
a little hanky-panky,

503
00:25:56,807 --> 00:26:00,769
and then, they dial 911-RAPE.

504
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:03,355
Hasta la vista,
Misery brothers!

505
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:04,648
Hola, dinero.

506
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,941
[Scheister laughing]

507
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,651
You sure this will work?

508
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:08,819
[Haagendas]
Listen, if you were on a jury,

509
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,071
would you honestly believe
that two beautiful women

510
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,657
would actually willingly
have sex with these two?

511
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,617
[Scheister laughs]

512
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:16,827
I get your point.

513
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,371
[Angelo]
I can't believe Tom Haagendas

514
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,956
offered to help us find wives.

515
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,624
[Angelo]
I think we have a real friend!

516
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,710
[jazz playing]

517
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,423
Hey, Ang! You look good!

518
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,091
You, too, Mike!

519
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:34,344
If I was a girl, like your
sister, instead of your brother,

520
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,637
I would date you.

521
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,182
Thanks, Ang.

522
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,433
Sure, Mike.

523
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,517
Just remember!

524
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,561
These girls aren't like
what we dated in the past!

525
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,271
They've got, uh...

526
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,023
... declassee!

527
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:47,357
Okay.

528
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:49,318
Now, let's go over the "don'ts"
one last time.

529
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,153
Don't cop a feel,

530
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,072
never spit without a spittoon,

531
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,450
don't adjust the family jewels,

532
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:57,826
-[Angelo] except now,
-[squeaking]

533
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,703
and, um...

534
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,831
Oh... don't tell no tall tales!

535
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,541
Exactly!

536
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,835
Just don't be ourselves

Your high-beams are on.

548
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,865
We took a cab.

I wanna propose a toast!

573
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:43,932
[Michael] Just a few days ago,

574
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,517
my brother and I
were merely actors.

575
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:49,188
Master thespians, performing
on the cruel stage we call life.

576
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:52,232
[Michael] But now, due to
the timely death of our father--

577
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,317

Szechuan!

583
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,928
Today, the chef has prepared
some real good food!

584
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:24,556
What is it?

585
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,017
I got no freaking clue!
I just serve it!

586
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:28,727

[Barbie and Fauna chuckling]

588
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,322
[Michael] So, how do you ladies
know Tom Haagendas?

589
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:42,032
I used to do his brother.

590
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,494
And I used to do his sister.

591
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,372
That's real nice! Keeping it
in the family and all!

592
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,332
How about you two?

593
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,376
Oh, we're
strictly heterosapiens.

594
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,460
Strictly.

595
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,170
[clap]

596
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:59,049
Today, we have

[bam]

598
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,179

00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:10,644
[Michael] Maybe later, Quazzie.

602
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,312
[Michael] We're still
chowing down our luncheon.

603
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,730
[Michael]
It's been very, very good!

604
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:14,815
[Michael] Very good!

605
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,150
[Quazzie] I'm so glad
you all liked it!

606
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:18,902
Did you ever find out
what it was?

607
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:21,363
Oh, yeah! The chef said
it was black stallion!

608
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:25,242
[Barbie and Fauna] What?

609
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:26,493
Horse meat!

610
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:28,620
[Quazzie] But don't worry!

611
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,248
[Quazzie] They haven't killed
a horse recently or nothing!

612
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,585
You see, there was this horse.

613
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,171
[rip]

614
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:38,755
[Quazzie]
They cut his head off years ago

615
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,257
for some gangster movie.

616
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,259
[Quazzie] But they didn't want
to waste the body!

617
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:43,343
[Barbie and Fauna heaving]

618
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,262
Him being a thoroughbred
prize-horse,

619
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,972
they just tossed it
into the meat locker

620
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,056
with the other stiffs!

[Quazzie] You don't have
to throw up on that!

624
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,315
[Quazzie] It ain't fattening!

The jets aren't very strong.

[Michael] They're not on...

635
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:27,513
[Michael] I've got gas.

636
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:28,597
[Barbie] Oh, god!

637
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:29,973
[Michael] How about some bubbly?

I love bubble baths!

641

It makes me feel so... bubbly!

go up your rear end!

Can I say hello
to your little friend?

648

Can I say hello
to your little friend?

649
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:09,304
You want to say hello
to Mr. Python?

Oh, yes!

sorry!

to spook you or nothing!

[Haagendas] Well, they're
still on life support,

675
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:17,372
but the doctor said
they should pull through.

[Scheister chuckles]

677
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:21,043
I'll say a prayer... for you.

678
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:24,755
So, I may have underestimated
the enemy! Big deal!

679
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,715
Hitler underestimated
the Russian winter,

680
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,175
but he didn't
freeze to death, did he?

681
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:29,927
I'll give you one last chance!

my real name?

698
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,965
[Michael] Call me psychic.

699
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:10,676
Psychic, huh?

700
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:17,766
[Dolly] I'm looking for Michael
and Angelo Misery Layleone.

701
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,185
[Dolly] You know them?

702
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,105
[Michael and Angelo] Intimately!

703
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:26,733
You're sexual preference
is none of my business!

Live and let die!
You know what I mean?

705
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:30,404
I don't think you understand.

706
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:32,990
You calling me stupid?

00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,074
No!

Oh, my whole gold-digging life!

Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

710
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,998
That's all I ever heard!

711
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,541
And I'm sick of it!

712
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:46,628
Can I help it if I was blessed
with the money to buy these?

[Ben] Now, any violations
of these very simple rules,

1175
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:49,071
and I will hold you in contempt.

1176
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:50,447
Sanction you.

1177
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:52,783
I'll have you maimed
and disbarred!

1178
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:56,078
Now, am I very clear
on this matter?

Would you please rescind
the gag order

1189
00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:27,359

Uh... sure. As long as
they don't talk too much.

[Ima] Oh yes, your majesty!

1246
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:34,444
[Ben] Very well, then.

1247
01:01:34,862 --> 01:01:36,405
[Ben]
Now, in order to speed things up

1248
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:37,573
and execute people,

1249
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:42,119
I have taken the liberty
to personally interview and...

[Ben coughs] ...select the jury.

1251
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:46,832
Your honor,
with all due circumspect,

1252
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,961
the process of voir dire,
or jury erection,

1253
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:52,671
is semi-guaranteed

1254
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:56,800

inadequate constituency

I get your point.

1261
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:12,065
Great.

1262
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:16,737

[Ben] Mr. Weakly, you may begin.

1271
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:01,573
[Weakly] Thank you, judge!

Let's keep abreast of the facts!

We put up a strong front!

1275
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:20,092
You can't be a hung jury!

1276
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:24,054
It's not a matter
of tit for tat!

1277

You're here today to see
that justice is served!

This case is really

You have two

Two allegedly alive suspects...

What does it all mean?

Have aliens visited us?

1318
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:51,118
Is there life after death?

You will refrain from using
any statements or questions

1327

Now, I ask you...

1337
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:54,806
Who are the real victims
in this crime?

1338
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:57,476
Is Elvis alive?

1339
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:01,772
And do these guys
deserve to die?

1340
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:06,318
Just because they're...
worthless losers?

1591
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,709
has a 92 percent sugar content!

1592
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:15,130
[Susie] But... the l'acidophilus
factor of 3.75,

1593
01:19:15,214 --> 01:19:16,965
when multiplied
by the exponential root

1594
01:19:17,049 --> 01:19:18,884
of the Pythagorean theory
of relativity,

1595
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:21,887
can only mean one thing!

1596
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:23,555
What?

1597
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:26,642
That the FNA sample in question

1598
01:19:26,725 --> 01:19:30,187
could not possibly have come
from Story Book Cereal!

1599
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:34,024
[Susie] Now, you see,
an odor of this magnitude

1600
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:38,987
from one fiber source,
and one fiber source only!

1601
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:41,281
[Susie] "Burritus mexicanus."

1602
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:42,366
[Ima] Ah!

1603
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:44,493
[Susie]
That is, of course, a burrito.

1604
01:19:44,576 --> 01:19:45,702
[Susie chuckles]

1605
01:19:45,786 --> 01:19:46,787
[Ima] Ha!

1606
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:49,039
[Ima] And in taking notes

1607
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,083
during the deposition

1608
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:54,294
of Michael and Angelo
Misery Layleone,

1609
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:58,799
what did they state
they had for breakfast?

1610
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:03,262
Could it have been
the incriminating burrito?

1611
01:20:03,554 --> 01:20:05,430
[music crescendo]

1612
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:08,600
[Susie] No, it was not!

1613
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:09,726
[Ima] No?

1614
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:10,936
[banging]

1615
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:13,146
What was it then?
What could it have been?

1616
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,982
[triumphant music playing]

1617
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,775
Story Book Cereal!

1618
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:19,528
[jurors at once] Ahh!

1619
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:21,154
No further questions.

1620
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:22,489
The defense rests.

1621
01:20:22,781 --> 01:20:29,788
-[lullaby playing]
-[snoring]

1622
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:40,299
[cheering]

1623
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:42,009
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

1624
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:43,886
Here is your decision!

1625
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:47,514
[host] All nine jurors
score the bout exactly the same!

1626
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:50,767
[host] In favor of the winner
by unanimous decision!

1627
01:20:50,851 --> 01:20:54,146
[host] The new litigating
champion of the world,

1628
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:57,149
Ima Barrister!

1629
01:20:57,232 --> 01:21:00,736
[loud applause]

1630
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,321
[Ben laughing]

1631
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:07,534
[knives clanging]

1632
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:08,619
[Ben grunts]

1633
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:10,120
[laughing continues]

1634
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:12,623
Justice is served! Yes!

1635
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:15,542
-[shouting]
-[clapping]

1636
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:25,385
[Michael]
That was some moment, Ang!

1637
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:28,514
When we heard the proclamation
of our emancipation...

1638
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:29,598
[Michael giggling]

1639
01:21:29,681 --> 01:21:30,766
-[Angelo] Oh, yeah!
-[Michael] That was something!

1640
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:33,268
[Angelo] And then, when he said
we were free to go!

1641
01:21:33,352 --> 01:21:35,687
-[Michael laughing]
-[Angelo] It touched me!

1642
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:37,481
[Angelo] Hey, it moved me!

1643
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:40,776
[car engine running]

1644
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:41,860
[door opens]

1645
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:43,320
[clatter]

1646
01:21:43,904 --> 01:21:44,988
-[whoosh]
-[crash]

1647
01:21:46,907 --> 01:21:47,908
[door shuts]

1648
01:21:51,912 --> 01:21:53,413
[Joyce] Let me introduce myself.

1649
01:21:53,497 --> 01:21:55,123
[Joyce]
I'm Doctor Joyce Brothers!

1650
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:56,208
-[Angelo] Hey.
-[Joyce] Hi!

1651
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:57,626
[Michael] Too bad you didn't
get here earlier, doc.

1652
01:21:58,043 --> 01:21:59,711
[Angelo] Yeah!
The guy they just took away?

1653
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:01,004
[Angelo]
He really could have used you!

1654
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:03,340
[Joyce] Oh, I'm not
that kind of a doctor!

1655
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:04,716
I'm a psychologist!

1656
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,926
[Joyce]
I listen to people tell--

1657
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:07,553
[Michael] Oh... Stories?

1658
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:10,097
I guess you could say that, yes.

1659
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:13,058
Doc, did you come
to the right place!

1660
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:14,643
She sure did!

1661
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,479
[Joyce] Uh-oh...

1662
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:23,318
[chicken] Oh no! Not again!

1663
01:22:24,403 --> 01:22:25,779
-[gulp]
-[burp]

1664
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:33,203
[ending music playing]
