They're clean,

368
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:54,947

to a normal life.

372
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:03,424
Does Lubert have
his <i>Persilschein?</i>

Yes.

00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,860

376
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,194

with a Nazi.

Yes, I think it does matter.

381

You look him in the eye.

382

- That's not the point.

the health of you
and your family?

406
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:55,464
It's a simple question.

407
00:32:57,331 --> 00:32:59,401
It affected the health
of my wife.

408
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:02,836
She was one
of the 40,000 killed

razed this city to the ground.

00:33:10,078 --> 00:33:11,881
Well, let's talk
about your wife.

412
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:14,180
The money was hers?

413
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:16,649
Her family was wealthy, yes.

414
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:18,418
They owned a number
of shipping yards.

415
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,922
Shipping yards used
to transfer Nazi weapons?

416
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:23,522
LUBERT:
Among many other things.

417
00:33:23,524 --> 00:33:25,325
You have to understand
that my wife and I

418
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:27,527
had nothing to do
with her family business.

419
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:31,463
Yet you claim to never
have joined the Nazi Party?

420
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:35,003
I was against everything
the Nazis stood for.

421
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:38,241
That wasn't my question.

422
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:41,977
No.

423
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,613
I was never a party member.

about the camps?

No.

One last question.

430
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:23,583
During the war, did you ever
hope for a German victory?

431
00:34:23,585 --> 00:34:26,418
You answered,
"I wanted it to end."

432
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,288
I wanted to go back
to how it was.

433

Is that it?
