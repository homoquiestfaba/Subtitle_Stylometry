1
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:42,237
Willard! Bring in
the videocassette recorder.

2
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,240
Suddenly, l realized that,
l don't have a pension plan...

3
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:24,876
...l don't have a health plan,
l don't have a dental plan...

4
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,525
...l don't have....

5
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:18,315
Willard!

6
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:29,604
Where the hell is my blue hat?

7
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:31,837
l don't know, Miss Crock.

8
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:35,437
Do you expect me to go
to my 10:00 meeting, like this?

9
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,881
No. Absolutely not, Miss Crock.

10
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:40,605
l'll help you find it.

11
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:50,435
l'm cold!

12
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:54,204
You taking a coffee break, lazybones?

13
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,921
All right, it's a good job.

14
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,236
l should have known it was you.

15
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:16,438
Miss Crock, you have such an appreciation
of fine clothing...

16
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:19,121
...l was thinking it was time
you buy me a new uniform.

17
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:22,244
You lookjust fine to me, Willard.

18
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,279
And you're dismissed.

19
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,285
But, it's disintegrating.

20
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,557
The buttons are barely hanging on.

21
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,837
Willard, that is a terrific suit.

22
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:34,124
Your father worked for me for 30 years.
Wore that suit every day.

23
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:35,606
Never complained!

24
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:37,120
Yeah, and then he died.

25
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:40,756
And then, at the funeral, you made
the undertaker give it back to you...

26
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:43,407
...so you could stick me in it
for another 15 years.

27
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:45,557
Just what are you implying?

28
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:51,043
Miss Crock, it's Christmas time.
l'm only asking for a new uniform.

29
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:53,197
''Only'' a new uniform?

30
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:56,524
And pretty soon it'll be
''only'' a new broom, maybe.

31
00:03:56,807 --> 00:04:00,641
And before you know it,
l will be ''only'' bankrupt!

32
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:04,405
Now, would you please
get out of my sight...

33
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:08,117
...before l kick you in the ass?

34
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:25,157
lt's not my fault
you have frost on your strawberries.

35
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:27,363
We have a contract.

36
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:31,556
Well then, l'll see you in court.

37
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:33,806
Excuse me, ma'am.

38
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,319
-l've got the Danish.
-Okay.

39
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:38,085
Bring 'em in.

40
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:40,479
Miss Crock, l'd like you to meet...

41
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:44,606
...Gunn Froling, Erland Vetterlund,
Per Malmsjo and Bertil Guve.

42
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:46,882
The executive team
from Copenhagen Snak Food.

43
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:51,085
Well, l'm just flattered that you're
even considering my little factory.

44
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:52,916
Lovely output.

45
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:55,840
That's terrific, Gunn.
You are truly a Great Dane.

46
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:03,440
Come, gentlemen, l'd like to show you
the Bun room. l'm sure you'll love it.

47
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:07,197
lt's just past Jellies and Creams.

48
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,438
What a bunch of bores!

49
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:12,238
l never know what those guys are saying.

50
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,887
Never mind about that.
Do you think we've got a deal?

51
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,083
Does Big Boy have a weight problem?

52
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,120
Soon you're going to be
the richest, prettiest...

53
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:24,280
...sexiest lady in the entire pastry industry.

54
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:26,279
l've told you, Chip...

55
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,045
...not in the office.

56
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,281
Hey, guys.

57
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:56,078
Nothing says Christmas Eve
like some hot, spicy chicken wings.

58
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,725
All right!

59
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:03,279
lf they're so yummy, how come
you only show up when it's free?

60
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:05,516
There he is.

61
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:06,398
About time!

62
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,479
Can you believe it? The old prune
made me clean her chimney.

63
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:12,081
Like she thinks Santa's coming
to pay her a visit.

64
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:18,319
Now, look here. Be careful with this
'cause it's kind of strong.

65
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,481
Willard, you need to make
a New Year's resolution.

66
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,603
Quit working for the ball-buster.

67
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,599
Show her who's boss, man.
Take a shit in her soup.

68
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,844
Thanks. That's real constructive.

69
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:35,999
You know how things are today.
A man has a job, he holds onto it.

70
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,442
ln your case, till he dies of old age.

71
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:40,563
Yeah, like my old man.

72
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,556
You know what he said to me
on his deathbed?

73
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:47,480
He said, ''Stick with Miss Crock.
You'll get ahead.''

74
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,876
l don't know what he was talking about.

75
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,117
Merry Christmas, Willard.

76
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:55,923
Merry Christmas, Rusty.

77
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,282
''Good King Wenceslas looked out

78
00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:00,677
''On the Feast of Stephen''

79
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,565
Oh, Chip...

80
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:04,999
...it's beautiful!

81
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:06,884
Now open yours.

82
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,924
l'm so excited.

83
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:12,723
Oh, Virginia, what a sweet gift!

84
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:16,397
l know how much you like money.
lt's $50,000.

85
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:18,842
You can buy anything you want with it.

86
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,405
What are you standing around for, Willard?

87
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:26,923
We don't want a mess now,
do we, on Christmas?

88
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:41,519
-Will that be all?
-That will not be all.

89
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:49,204
Merry Christmas.

90
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:54,164
Miss Crock, l wasn't expecting this.

91
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:58,924
l thought of something that l knew
you'd be thrilled to death with!

92
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,842
Miss Crock, God bless you.

93
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:04,680
-Open it!
-You are a good woman.

94
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,243
-What's this?
-Your favorite.

95
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,636
Mincemeat pie.

96
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,638
Where the hell is my suit?

97
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:17,396
Goodness gracious! Sakes alive!
l thought you'd like it.

98
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,443
-Like it?
-Yes.

99
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:23,156
And l put a pair of cuff links in there
as well.

100
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,683
You went all out, didn't you?

101
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:29,077
A pair of crackerjack cuff links
and one shitty pie!

102
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:35,955
What are you doing?

103
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,767
l thought we were going
to Leroy's Christmas kegger?

104
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:41,361
Miss Crock said
l gotta spend a night in the box.

105
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:44,007
Damn! lt's more like in Filipino prison.

106
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,484
-''Get in that sweatbox!''
-Leave me alone!

107
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:49,796
Fine.

108
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,005
Feliz Navidad.

109
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,117
Just in case you get hungry.

110
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,837
Beat it. This is my dinner.

111
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:17,358
You rat, l'll squash you.

112
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,366
Come here.

113
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:33,036
l can't believe l've tolerated him
for as long as l have.

114
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:36,000
He's just a user.
Willard's exploited your generosity.

115
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:38,203
That's exactly right.

116
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:41,559
l mean his father, Teddy, was a nice man.

117
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,002
-But enough is enough.
-Really.

118
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,044
Well, tomorrow, we'll...

119
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:48,246
...fire him.

120
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:50,758
Throw his stuff in the furnace.

121
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:59,644
-Santa Claus must be stopped.
-There will be no Christmas this year.

122
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,995
You got that right.

123
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,679
You're not gonna believe this.

124
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:06,644
The old grinch is gonna fire me.

125
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:09,082
lt's ridiculous.
Why would someone fire their slave?

126
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:12,443
Because she's mean.
She picked Christmas Day to do it.

127
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,757
Damn! You need revenge.

128
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:20,041
-Revenge! We need revenge!
-Revenge! We need revenge!

129
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:25,838
Let's kidnap Santa Claus. We'll break
into his toy shop and seize him!

130
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,242
Maybe those moon men are...

131
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:32,165
-...onto something.
-You mean we should kidnap Santa?

132
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,635
Wait a minute.
Why don't we just kidnap Miss Crock?

133
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:38,002
-No, it's crazy.
-No, that's brilliant!

134
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:40,397
We'll grab Granny
and hold her ass for ransom.

135
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:43,126
And if they don't pay,
we start hacking off her fingers.

136
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,357
First her thumb, then her pointer...

137
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,558
...then her little nasty finger.

138
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,205
What are you talking about?

139
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:52,723
We're not criminals.
You fry chicken, l drive a car.

140
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:56,165
When that money comes rolling in,
l'll go crazy, man!

141
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,761
-l'll laminate my menus.
-Shut up, okay?

142
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:02,087
We know nothing
about kidnapping an old lady.

143
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,126
But what about her dog?

144
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,925
-You mean Biscuit?
-No, Muffin.

145
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:12,198
Yeah, she loves him
more than anything in the world.

146
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:15,245
l bet she'd pay plenty
for that old bag of fleas.

147
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:17,921
Yeah, l bet she'd pay $1 million.

148
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,282
Remember, we have to be quiet
inside the house.

149
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,039
Miss Crock is a light sleeper.

150
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:49,243
You ain't gotta worry about me.

151
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:56,603
This place is nice.

152
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:02,522
What the hell are you doing?

153
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:05,924
-l'm checking for electric eyes.
-There's no electric eyes.

154
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:08,441
-How do you know? They're invisible.
-Trust me.

155
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,597
l've lived here my entire life.

156
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,161
So, this is where the old bitch sleeps?

157
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,802
Okay, give me the weenie.

158
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,686
Okay, Muffin.
l gotta special treat for you.

159
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,282
Cripes!

160
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,596
What kind of aim was that?

161
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,040
Muffin!

162
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,685
Bite my weenie.

163
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:11,477
The hell with this. Plan B.

164
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,763
Will you shut that dog up?

165
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:25,200
You bastard!

166
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,203
Would you keep it down?

167
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:53,683
''Keep it down?''
This thing is eating my hand!

168
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:02,279
Jesus, this is a nightmare!

169
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,085
Put him in the box!

170
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:15,035
Who's smarter? Now who's smarter?

171
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:19,599
What should it say?

172
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:21,200
''We've got him.

173
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:24,643
''Pay us $1 million, or he's a dead dog!''

174
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:27,843
-How does that sound?
-Fine.

175
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:30,040
Let's get the hell out of here.

176
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:44,879
$1 million!

177
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:46,959
This is the happiest day of my life.

178
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:50,164
-With that money, we can do anything.
-l know what l'm gonna do.

179
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:52,681
l'm gonna buy me a four-star chicken hole.

180
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,123
l'll get a better neighborhood
and a listing in the Zagat Guide.

181
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:59,995
l'm going someplace warm where you
don't need layered clothing. Start over.

182
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:02,647
l got some good years left in me.
l can better myself.

183
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,878
l'm gonna register at one of them
four-year universities.

184
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:21,595
My friend...

185
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,837
...here's to second chances.

186
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:27,844
Did you have a lovely sleep, Muffin? Yes.

187
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:31,198
Now, we'll have a lovely breakfast,
you and....

188
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:40,082
Oh, my God!

189
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:43,399
Look at me.

190
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:44,722
Muffin!

191
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:47,801
Look what they've done to your mother.

192
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:49,836
l don't know....

193
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:58,517
''We've got him. Pay us $1 million
or he's a dead dog.''

194
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:01,599
Who's a dead dog?

195
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:03,526
Willard?

196
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:08,077
Man, we've got so many choices.

197
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,886
-l'm just trying to get out of Pittsburgh.
-You said it.

198
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:13,527
Check out this. Bora Bora.

199
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:16,647
l was thinking more like Caribbean myself.

200
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:20,197
Whichever one has a school
with a strong liberal arts program.

201
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:23,203
Lord! l'm dead!

202
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,317
-We're going to jail.
-What do you mean ''we''?

203
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,682
That's my picture on the front page.

204
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:39,476
Who would have thought kidnapping a dog
would make the front page?

205
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:42,923
Wait a minute. They think it was me.
They think l was kidnapped.

206
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:46,477
-They don't even mention Muffin.
-Why would somebody kidnap you?

207
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,603
l don't know, but they think someone did.

208
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:51,997
''There were signs of a scuffle,
the chauffeur's blood was on a wall...

209
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,681
''...and a note demanded $1 million...

210
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,355
''...or he's a dead dog.''

211
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,959
Sweet Jesus!

212
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:15,723
We kidnapped a turd.

213
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:18,321
According to sources,
the missing chauffeur had been...

214
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:21,126
...a loyal employee for over 15 years.

215
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,927
Virginia Crock,
known for her mouthwatering treats...

216
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:27,238
...awoke this morning
to news that was not so sweet.

217
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,319
Do you have any enemies?

218
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:45,685
Not that l know of.
l'm just an elderly lady who makes pies.

219
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,800
Well, does Mr. Fillmore have any enemies?

220
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:53,080
-Who?
-That's Willard's last name.

221
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:57,641
Not that l know of.

222
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:01,276
Did he have anybody
that he used to bring around the house?

223
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:03,606
Not that l know of.

224
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,397
Does he have any living relatives?

225
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:09,125
Not that l know of.

226
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:13,642
Ma'am...

227
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,964
...excuse me, but...

228
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,239
...this man worked for you
for over a decade...

229
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:24,724
...and you don't know
if he has any friends or any relatives?

230
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:27,446
Detective, Miss Crock has told you
everything she knows.

231
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:29,802
What do you mean?
She hasn't told me anything.

232
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:32,037
Sir, if it makes you happy...

233
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:35,643
...you go right ahead
and find Willard Fillmore.

234
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:38,760
As for me...

235
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:41,479
...it's time for my nap.

236
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,439
Sources say that Fillmore
moved to Pittsburgh at the age ofsix.

237
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,722
Here's the thing. I hardly knew Willard.

238
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:55,756
Police say ifyou have any information,
call the Piehunt Hotline at 1-800--

239
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:59,044
-How did this get so big?
-Rusty, we gotta turn ourselves in.

240
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:00,845
How? They think you're the victim.

241
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:04,124
Shit! You have to be really dumb
to accidentally kidnap yourself.

242
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:07,484
Wait a minute.
This is all gonna get pinned on me!

243
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:10,605
You gotta get un-kidnapped!
You gotta escape!

244
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:14,516
The kidnappers go out to dinner,
you chew through the ropes, you get away.

245
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:17,838
Yeah, that's good.
That's good, but it should be real.

246
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:21,917
There was a struggle
and l got all bruised and beat up!

247
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:27,319
This is an airtight alibi.

248
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,557
Here. Let me help you.

249
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:30,557
Good.

250
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,877
-You like that, right?
-Yeah, wait a minute.

251
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:34,117
What?

252
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:36,118
l got an idea.

253
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:41,242
What are we worried about?
Why don't l just stay kidnapped?

254
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:42,956
Why?

255
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:45,086
lt makes perfect sense.

256
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:49,046
lnstead of them paying $1 million
for Muffin, they pay it for me.

257
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:51,762
Why would somebody pay
$1 million for you?

258
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:54,077
'Cause l'm a man. Muffin's a dog.

259
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:57,762
-Yeah, but he got a pedigree.
-Gimme a break, l'm better than he is!

260
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:02,959
Come on! l'm better than a dog!

261
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,039
l'm five times better.

262
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,003
-''$5 million.''
-lt's repugnant.

263
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:15,037
lt's like a rising stock.

264
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:18,040
Why did he jump from one to five?

265
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:30,638
All right, man. Let's see some real
emotion here. You're kidnapped.

266
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:33,924
Let's see some tears.
l want to feel something real.

267
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:37,522
-And action!
-Help! Save me!

268
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:41,202
Miss Crock, l'm begging you, please!

269
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:46,962
l got into MSNBC.
How do you plug that camera in?

270
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:49,838
l think like this.

271
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:56,840
In a startling development
in the Pittsburgh kidnapping...

272
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:59,805
...this shocking videotape
was e-mailed to MSNBC.

273
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:03,363
Help, Miss Crock, save me!
I'm begging you!

274
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:06,127
They got me wearing chains!

275
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,358
I'm living in a cage.

276
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,837
They're gonna kill me ifyou don'tpay.

277
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:15,003
Open your wallet, you tight-ass!

278
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:18,363
Jesus, somebody has to do something!

279
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:20,438
Dinnertime, dog.

280
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,685
They got me eating kibble.

281
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:31,800
I don't know how much longer I can last.

282
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:33,925
Oh, God, Chip...

283
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,525
...he's wearing a collar.

284
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:40,125
Collars don't hurt.
They're just trying to intimidate us.

285
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:41,925
Whatis that?

286
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,999
Is that urine? Itis!

287
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,443
Itis! It's human urine!

288
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:52,039
Chip, we're late.

289
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:55,399
-Miss Crock!
-What's your reaction to the kibble video?

290
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,796
Have you changed your mind
about paying the ransom?

291
00:22:57,887 --> 00:23:00,355
She'll not deal with criminals.
lt's a police matter.

292
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,519
Your chauffeur was chained like a dog.
Where's your compassion?

293
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,563
l'll show you compassion.

294
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:09,123
Get your asses off my property!

295
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:11,158
I'm afraid you didn't hear me.

296
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:14,523
I'm afraid you didn't hear me!

297
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:21,002
Today, dessert baron Virginia Crock,
reiterated she will notpay the ransom.

298
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,286
We went to the man in the street
to find out what he thinks.

299
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:26,758
She's rich. She can afford it.

300
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:29,919
If I worked for that...chowder...slut...

301
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:34,446
...I'd tell her to...get down,
get busy on my...man.

302
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,085
More concerned citizens
have started a formal protest.

303
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,283
No more pies if Willard dies!

304
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:43,758
ls that Hillary?

305
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:46,157
She's looking good.

306
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:57,563
Rich people are no good.

307
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,678
I'm never gonna eat herpie again.

308
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,638
This media blitz is killing us.

309
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:08,763
Our sales have dropped 50 percent.

310
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:18,719
Miss Crock, go to hell! Miss Crock--

311
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,686
Miss Crock, many bad things are happened.

312
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:31,446
We thought we were buying
your wholesome American image.

313
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:35,486
But it's terrible shock
that you don't rescue your loyal houseman.

314
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:38,639
Sweet old lady on pie box
is now super-villain.

315
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,202
l'm sorry, honey. They're playing hardball.

316
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:43,676
lf you don't pay up, they're gonna walk.

317
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,759
Fuck!

318
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:53,926
Of course I'm gonna pay the ransom.

319
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:59,081
Ijust didn't want to encourage
those underworld criminals.

320
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:02,837
But now I want Willard
home again with me.

321
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:06,284
The old hag is coughing up!

322
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:09,918
Thank you, Miss Crock.
And thank you, Hillary, for kicking her ass!

323
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:11,122
l'm free!

324
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:13,163
We are millionaires!

325
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,196
Anybody here?

326
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:18,116
Hello?

327
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,405
What can l do for you?

328
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,086
Are you Rusty P. Hayes?

329
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:27,398
Yes, l am. Can l interest you
in my shrimp boat special?

330
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,276
No. l'm here investigating
the kidnapping of Willard Fillmore.

331
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:32,917
Who?

332
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:36,919
-You must have read about him.
-l don't read newspapers.

333
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:39,404
We thought you might know him.

334
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:42,240
We were going through
Mr. Fillmore's belongings...

335
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:46,798
...and we found this
''Chicken Dinner Special'' punch card.

336
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:48,236
Really?

337
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:50,716
Yeah, this guy.

338
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,283
-l was wondering what happened to him.
-He was kidnapped.

339
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:56,677
When he came in here, did he...

340
00:25:56,767 --> 00:26:00,157
...ever do anything unusual
that would draw attention to him?

341
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:05,562
One time l seen him eat
50 chicken gizzards all by himself.

342
00:26:06,327 --> 00:26:09,364
Look, if you come across anything
that might help us...

343
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:11,998
-...give me a call.
-Sure.

344
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,603
l hate loose ends...

345
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,763
...and l want this case to end.

346
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:36,241
l was so scared,
l thought l was gonna pee in my pants.

347
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:38,795
He knows something.
He had a funny look on his face.

348
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:41,640
-Why'd you tell him so much?
-l didn't tell him nothing.

349
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:44,241
l told him about the time
you ate 50 chicken gizzards.

350
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:47,603
That wasn't me!
That was some Chinese guy.

351
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,998
Fong did do that, didn't he?

352
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:53,961
l'm telling you, we got problems.
That evil Kojak hates loose ends.

353
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:57,841
And when they pay and l don't show up,
that's a loose end. He'll go nuts!

354
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:02,479
-You'll be some place nice, like Jamaica.
-Yeah, well, he'll track me there.

355
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:06,116
Wait a minute. What if we fooled them
and made them think l was dead?

356
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,721
Like maybe if we borrowed a corpse.

357
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,037
Don't we know somebody
who knows somebody...

358
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:12,560
...who works at the morgue?

359
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:15,036
Hillary used to live across the street...

360
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:18,676
...from a dude who was in the army
with this guy who worked at the morgue.

361
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,564
l forgot it was Hillary.

362
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:25,720
Yeah, you can't hit her up, man.
She just walked a picket line for you.

363
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:45,843
Oh, my God!

364
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:49,765
l never thought l'd see you again,
and here you are.

365
00:27:49,847 --> 00:27:52,805
-l brought you flowers.
-Oh, my God!

366
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:54,525
Wow! You're such a class act.

367
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,280
You get ransomed,
then you buy me flowers.

368
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:01,480
Well, l didn't get ransomed, per se.

369
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,362
-Did you escape?
-No, l didn't escape literally.

370
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:13,441
Shit.

371
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:19,722
Where'd they go?

372
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:29,164
-All right, how did you do it?
-lt was really no problem.

373
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:33,126
l told her the truth, we had a little sex,
she told me the guy's name: Grover.

374
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:36,438
Damn! Did all that in ten minutes.

375
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:41,965
Spooky!

376
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:18,075
Grover?

377
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:28,200
What are you doing? Get away from that.

378
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:30,245
l'm sorry.

379
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,325
lt's just a rock.

380
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,086
lt's not just a rock.

381
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:38,680
lt's a pet rock.

382
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:43,117
A pet rock.
l haven't seen one of these in years.

383
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:46,404
Yeah. l just dug it out of his colon.

384
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:53,278
Yeah, it's still warm.

385
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:55,524
l got a whole collection.

386
00:29:57,247 --> 00:29:59,238
lt's really amazing...

387
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:03,002
...what you dig out of the inside
of dead people when you cut them open.

388
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:06,126
People swallow everything.
Here's some dice.

389
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:09,003
The guy must have been to Vegas.

390
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:14,517
Got all kinds of stuff here.
This beautiful harmonica.

391
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:20,198
-Don't put that in your mouth.
-This is interesting here.

392
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:21,756
Yes.

393
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:25,806
You gotta go in that way.
lt couldn't have gone in this way.

394
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:28,447
He would have noticed. A broom?

395
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:35,765
''Where'd it go?''

396
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:40,402
''Oh, forget about it.''
He's dead, and then you find it.

397
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:42,682
You know, it's all kinds of stuff like that.

398
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,485
This is good. Yeah.

399
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:48,638
lt's a clicker.
''Hey, honey, where's the clicker?''

400
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:51,005
''l don't know.''

401
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:53,286
''lnside me.''

402
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:55,885
Here. Look at this.

403
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:57,885
A perfectly good comb.

404
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:01,685
Grover, how would you like
to make $100,000?

405
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:05,479
Well, that's a lot of cheese.

406
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,196
What l gotta do?

407
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:11,120
l want people to think that l'm dead.

408
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:15,035
Dead?

409
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,885
Yeah, you just take one of the dead bodies
and dress it up like my man Willard here.

410
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:22,197
And when they find it, they think it's him.

411
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:25,799
You think it's that easy?
l can just take up any old body...

412
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:27,286
...and give it to you?

413
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:28,959
l got filing slips!

414
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:31,561
My bodies are catalogued!
This is a tight ship!

415
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:34,926
Why don't you take some old bum
that nobody would notice?

416
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:36,201
A ''bum''?

417
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:39,242
Come on! lf you do it,
there's $100,000 for you.

418
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:41,245
Will it show up on my W2?

419
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,079
No, tax-free.

420
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:47,160
Good. Because why should my money
go to pave roads and build schools?

421
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:50,319
Yeah, good point. Listen. This is the plan.

422
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:52,200
Dump the body tomorrow night.

423
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,847
And make sure you get someone
that looks like me, okay?

424
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:56,485
No problem. Piece of cake.

425
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:59,525
Here's some clothes of mine
that you can put on him, all right?

426
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:02,485
And l got my driver's license.

427
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,121
-You put that in his pocket.
-Yes.

428
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:07,323
-And here's some jewelry.
-Jewelry?

429
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:10,125
Those are nice.

430
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,766
Wait a minute.

431
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:16,999
lsn't this suit kind of ratty?

432
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:20,523
Ain't it gonna be degrading for a dead man
to have to wear this trash?

433
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,598
-Just do it.
-All right.

434
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:25,406
l'll do it.

435
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:30,877
Miss Crock, l just want to thank you
for agreeing to pay the ransom.

436
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:34,645
'Cause most folks....

437
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:38,323
Most folks just don't appreciate
the work we cops do.

438
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:42,325
-Virginia.
-What?

439
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:47,798
Willard, bring in our guests
some coffee here!

440
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,080
-What's that?
-l don't know.

441
00:32:59,887 --> 00:33:02,321
The cover page is from Pic 'n' Shop.

442
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:07,766
lt's from the kidnappers.

443
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:11,323
''Miss Crock, bring the cash
to Three Rivers Stadium at 10:00 PM.

444
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:14,126
''No cops or the chauffeur dies.''

445
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:15,481
No cops!

446
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:18,520
What if those bums run off
with my money?

447
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:21,440
Don't worry, ma'am.
That ballpark is so gigantic...

448
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:24,280
...we're gonna be able to hide
a million cops in there.

449
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:28,440
l thought these guys were smart,
but they're in way over their heads.

450
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:40,276
You think the cops are gonna show up
at the stadium?

451
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:44,116
You kidding me, man? lt's gonna be
like rush hour at Dunkin' Donuts.

452
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,722
Yeah.

453
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,035
l'll be waiting for you
in the Runway Lounge.

454
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:52,125
-Don't forget. The flight's at midnight.
-Then, tomorrow...

455
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:54,846
-...we'll be lying on the beach.
-Sipping margaritas.

456
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:56,326
Smoking a fatty.

457
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:04,195
This is the most distressful day of my life.

458
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:06,956
Do we have to pay them all the money?

459
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:11,086
l mean, couldn't we, l don't know,
sort of shortchange them a little?

460
00:34:11,207 --> 00:34:12,959
Virginia, bite the bullet.

461
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:16,198
l'm sure your taxman
will figure a way to write it off.

462
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:20,206
That's a lot of green.

463
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:27,678
Jesus Christ, l don't know what the hell
the wheel is doing on this side of the car.

464
00:34:27,847 --> 00:34:32,477
God almighty, l don't know how
poor Willard ever put up with this shit.

465
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:40,803
-Hello?
-This is the kidnapper.

466
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:44,203
-How'd you get my number?
-Shut up! There's been a change in plan.

467
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:47,563
-Don't go to no stadium.
-l gotta go to the stadium.

468
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:51,799
You're not gonna do nothing
until l tell you to, you smelly old bitch.

469
00:34:52,287 --> 00:34:53,481
Nowlisten...

470
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,159
...you meet me at Midtown Park.

471
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,997
That place isn't safe after dark!

472
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:01,722
Cork it! I'll see you there in ten minutes.

473
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:10,159
-Quick, get me the police!
-l'm still here!

474
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:16,355
Try any more games like that,
l'll put a bullet through Willard's head.

475
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:47,925
Gimme the money!

476
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:50,965
You're the kidnapper.

477
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:53,800
You no-good hooligan!

478
00:35:54,447 --> 00:35:56,722
You decimate my house.

479
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:59,446
You violate my public goodwill!

480
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:03,759
And why? Why me?
What did l ever do to you?

481
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:06,086
Gimme the money!

482
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:08,203
You oughta be ashamed of yourself!

483
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:11,643
Does your mother know
the kind of work that you do?

484
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,997
Don't you ever stop talking?

485
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:16,045
Gimme the money!

486
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:25,516
Now, l expect you to return Willard
in exactly the same condition he was in!

487
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:29,646
He was a strong worker!
And he had good teeth!

488
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:33,642
l got the money! l got the money!

489
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:38,036
l gotta buy Hillary a nice dinner.
l'm gonna buy my mom a new headstone.

490
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:41,563
One with her name on it and everything!
l got the money!

491
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:43,516
Mister!

492
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,642
-What's in the suitcase?
-Get away from me.

493
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,365
Hey, mister, what's in the suitcase?

494
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:52,200
-Hand it over!
-Get away from me, you little shit!

495
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:54,755
-What's in the suitcase?
-Show us some respect.

496
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:57,520
-What's in the suitcase?
-Hand it over!

497
00:36:57,607 --> 00:37:00,405
-l don't like your attitude.
-Take a hike.

498
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,279
Jesus Christ!

499
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:05,802
Harder!

500
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,042
Zap him!

501
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:23,477
You can't let him down now.
You can't let him down.

502
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:29,159
Yeah, let's see.

503
00:38:12,047 --> 00:38:13,560
Not bad.

504
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:28,763
Don't pay any attention to me.

505
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:31,361
l'm just gonna take some work home.

506
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:33,915
l'm very conscientious.

507
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:38,002
Oh, boy.

508
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:41,526
l'll go get it.

509
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:51,125
Wake up!

510
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:54,641
Where am l? What is this?
What's going on here?

511
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:58,481
The police found you beat up in the park.

512
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:04,080
But, of course, those incompetents let
the kidnappers get away, with my money.

513
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,044
So, l was in the park...

514
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:09,042
...and they got away with the $5 million....

515
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:10,480
You owe me.

516
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:13,718
And you're going to work off that ransom...

517
00:39:14,127 --> 00:39:18,200
...until the day Jesus calls you home.

518
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:25,800
Just a chunk light in spring water,
not in olive oil, and a diet Coke.

519
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:30,838
There you are, as l live and breathe.
Pittsburgh's finest.

520
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,805
l'm truly sorry, ma'am.

521
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:36,602
But if it's any consolation,
we had every inch of that stadium covered.

522
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:37,642
We had snipers.

523
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:40,480
Who cares?

524
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,158
Would you do me a favor?

525
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:49,479
Find my cash.

526
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,718
l gotta get outta here.

527
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:09,641
Mr. Fillmore, l....

528
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:15,516
-Could l have a few words with you?
-Sure, of course.

529
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,959
-How can l help you?
-l wonder, Mr. Fillmore....

530
00:40:22,847 --> 00:40:24,678
l wonder if you would...

531
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:28,245
-...give me a description of the kidnappers?
-The kidnappers.

532
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:31,478
Well, l never actually saw the kidnappers...

533
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:35,116
...that well because l was kept blindfolded.

534
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,000
Blindfolded?

535
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:40,005
But you were not blindfolded on the video.

536
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,998
No, l wasn't.

537
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:44,598
No, l wasn't blindfolded on the video.

538
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:47,997
But l didn't see the kidnappers
then either, because...

539
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:52,355
...they hired a TV crew to shoot the video.

540
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:56,876
Yeah, we did it in a studio with a crew.

541
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:05,164
You got any Nuprin?

542
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:07,076
No.

543
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:09,443
Why? What happened in there?

544
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:12,246
The bozo's covering for the kidnappers.

545
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:14,958
l really gotta get out of here.

546
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:21,885
-Stop!
-Where do you think you're going?

547
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:23,725
Rusty! Hey, Rust.

548
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:27,045
-Where you been?
-The drop off did not go as planned.

549
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:30,916
l concur 'cause the plan never mentioned
my best friend two-timing me.

550
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:33,521
-l didn't two-time you!
-Come on, man!

551
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:37,236
''l'll do the drop all by myself,
that way Rusty won't get in trouble.''

552
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:40,604
Where's the bag of money?
Why aren't you at the airport?

553
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:44,681
-What are you doing in a hospital?
-A street gang took the money.

554
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:48,442
-Bullshit! You're ripping me off!
-No! l swear to God.

555
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:51,121
lt was these big muscle men in the park.

556
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:54,045
They beat me up and took the $5 million.

557
00:41:54,127 --> 00:41:56,402
They had guns and tattoos...

558
00:41:56,487 --> 00:42:01,197
...and they had those two sticks on a chain
that you swing and you hurt people with.

559
00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:05,519
-Are you saying you were mugged?
-Mugged? lt was more like a rape.

560
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:10,396
Well, not a real rape.

561
00:42:11,207 --> 00:42:14,324
Look, Grand lnquisitor,
if you had ripped me off...

562
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:18,320
...would you barricade yourself
in a hospital room with 20 cops outside?

563
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:20,479
You make an interesting point.

564
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:23,724
lt's not imaginable
that things could be more botched.

565
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:24,796
Yeah?

566
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:27,605
What about Grover?

567
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:31,203
Oh, no! That fruitcake's
gonna be dumping my fake body.

568
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:35,927
Hello, County Morgue, Rita speaking.
Can l help you?

569
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:38,521
I'd like to speak to a Grover Cleaver.

570
00:42:38,607 --> 00:42:41,041
l'm sorry.
Mr. Cleaver no longer works here.

571
00:42:41,127 --> 00:42:43,197
Bitch, what are you talking about?

572
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:47,880
Mr. Cleaver quit yesterday.

573
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:50,681
He said he was joining the superrich.

574
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:57,477
Grover retired from the morgue.
Too wealthy to hold a job.

575
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:00,640
Man, we are no good at this.
We gotta stop this guy.

576
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:03,366
-How? We don't know where to find him.
-Call Hillary.

577
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,721
She doesn't know him.

578
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:09,039
She knew his name from that fat dude
who used to live across the street.

579
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:12,245
You're so defeatist!

580
00:43:12,407 --> 00:43:14,637
Fine. l'll track him down myself.

581
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:17,436
lf you did it,
you'd probably muck it up anyway.

582
00:43:18,447 --> 00:43:20,597
The guy can't do anything right.

583
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:26,280
Detective!

584
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,043
Mr. Hayes. What are you doing here?

585
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:35,437
l'm visiting my Aunt Mabel.

586
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:40,277
She's real sick.
She got polio and emphysema...

587
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,757
...all that shit together.
lt's gonna kill her. l swear.

588
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:47,798
She's staying in this room right here.
l'm gonna go say hi.

589
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:56,160
Aunt Mabel, come gimme some sugar, girl.

590
00:43:57,807 --> 00:44:00,196
l told you don't listen to them doctors!

591
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:06,124
Okay, you're convulsing. You gotta relax.

592
00:44:07,007 --> 00:44:08,440
All right, Aunt Mabel!

593
00:44:08,527 --> 00:44:11,405
l'm gonna let you get some rest!
Get some rest, Aunt Mabel!

594
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:14,126
All right, give Uncle Gordon my love!

595
00:44:22,087 --> 00:44:25,966
That medicine got Aunt Mabel
real irritable. She's crazy.

596
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,442
She's normally a real sweetheart.

597
00:44:28,687 --> 00:44:29,915
Detective!

598
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:33,565
Detective, you're not gonna believe
what's happened.

599
00:44:36,647 --> 00:44:38,842
We've just discovered a dead body.

600
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:40,680
Shit.

601
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:49,042
They found the body!
They found the body!

602
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:50,560
Oh, my Lord.

603
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:54,396
That dumb-ass Grover. He's the only one
of us who follows directions.

604
00:44:54,487 --> 00:44:58,241
We're going to jail. We're going to jail.
We're gonna be somebody's bitch.

605
00:44:58,607 --> 00:45:01,565
Maybe if we confess, they'll go easy on us.

606
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:04,965
Yeah, maybe we'll just get
community service.

607
00:45:05,127 --> 00:45:08,483
Or maybe they'll take us
to one of those country club prisons.

608
00:45:08,607 --> 00:45:10,245
We'll talk stocks with bankers.

609
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:13,558
-We could really make some connections.
-You're insane.

610
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:16,083
We're gonna be somebody's bitch.

611
00:45:21,447 --> 00:45:22,641
Willard.

612
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,761
l have some shocking news.

613
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:27,759
They found your kidnapper.

614
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:34,277
-Are you sure it was the kidnapper?
-Of course l'm sure!

615
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:38,485
They found his dead body on the front
steps of the Quaker Wax Museum.

616
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:44,126
He was wearing all your clothes
and those divine cuff links l gave you.

617
00:45:44,847 --> 00:45:48,078
Any idea why the kidnapper
would be wearing your clothes?

618
00:45:49,607 --> 00:45:50,596
No.

619
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:55,320
Any idea why the kidnapper
would be dead?

620
00:45:55,687 --> 00:45:59,157
Well, that kidnapping den
was a real hothouse of emotion, you know.

621
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:00,885
Anything could have happened.

622
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:05,641
Well, let's just hope that body
isn't so ripped up that you can't identify it.

623
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:14,281
That's the guy. No question.
That's the kidnapper.

624
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:15,760
That's the guy?

625
00:46:18,287 --> 00:46:21,120
That's the guy who beat you up
and held you prisoner?

626
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:26,445
Yeah, well, he was a lot more ferocious
back when he was alive.

627
00:46:26,607 --> 00:46:29,246
Ferocious? He's an old midget.

628
00:46:29,607 --> 00:46:33,520
Yeah, but he had a real low voice.
You know, very intimidating.

629
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:37,127
''Put your hands behind your head!
Get in the corner.''

630
00:46:37,207 --> 00:46:41,519
That's him. That's him!
l'd recognize that voice anywhere.

631
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:47,716
Okay.

632
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:53,480
Well, in some weird, screwy way
that l will never understand...

633
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:55,246
...that is the kidnapper.

634
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,475
l'm telling you, this whole thing stinks.
Fillmore and Hayes are connected.

635
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,445
-Yeah, that midget was no tough guy.
-No shit, Sherlock.

636
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:05,325
They are definitely hiding
something or someone.

637
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:11,321
Our 1-800 line produced an eyewitness.
Meet Edgar Kettle. He saw the drop.

638
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:13,156
Yeah.

639
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,479
l saw the whole thing. The whole thing.

640
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,717
Last night,
l was in my check-cashing store.

641
00:47:18,807 --> 00:47:23,244
l look out and l see a man
toss a body onto the steps.

642
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:27,237
-What kind of man?
-He was ugly.

643
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:28,920
Real ugly.

644
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:33,364
Get me the sketch artist in here right now.
This case is about to break.

645
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:46,318
That looks just like me.

646
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:50,039
''Wanted for Crock kidnapping.''

647
00:48:01,247 --> 00:48:03,238
Make this go away.

648
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:35,527
l'm screwed!

649
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:40,802
Willard, take away my salad plate!

650
00:48:40,887 --> 00:48:43,526
I'm ready for the second course!

651
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:44,796
Yeah.

652
00:48:45,207 --> 00:48:47,960
''Stick with Miss Crock. You'll get ahead.''

653
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,120
Apologize to the man!
Apologize for what you did!

654
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:03,641
l'm sorry for misbehaving in the park.

655
00:49:03,727 --> 00:49:06,195
You better be!
This is the man you wronged, Tito.

656
00:49:06,287 --> 00:49:10,041
-Now, give back what you took.
-Here it is, mister. l didn't even open it.

657
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:12,766
That's 'cause you couldn't open it, liar!
lt was locked!

658
00:49:12,847 --> 00:49:16,681
As soon as l saw the address on the tag
we drove it straight over here.

659
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:19,645
-Thanks.
-Come on!

660
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:22,480
Your hide has an appointment
with my hand!

661
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,481
Yeah! Let's party!

662
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:41,246
''Willard, clear my salad plate!''
Yeah, well, lick me, you old bag!

663
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:43,437
Your busboy's going to Bermuda!

664
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:46,201
We're going to Bali, so l can date her.

665
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:48,802
-Yeah!
-Get some Bali booty.

666
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:55,482
Hurry up! Hurry up! Move out!

667
00:49:57,967 --> 00:49:59,605
Come on! Come on!

668
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:04,526
You can't park there!
That's a tow-away zone!

669
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:07,679
We ain't never coming back.
Go park it up your ass.

670
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:25,321
Excuse me. We'd like two tickets to Bali.

671
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,840
First class.

672
00:50:28,727 --> 00:50:31,685
-And how will you be paying for that?
-That's a good question.

673
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:34,804
-That hadn't really occurred to us.
-How about this?

674
00:50:34,887 --> 00:50:36,479
-Cash!
-Cash!

675
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,005
-Don't worry, we got money.
-Back off there, lady.

676
00:50:50,287 --> 00:50:53,757
There's no money!
Miss Crock double-crossed us!

677
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:55,240
The old crow never paid!

678
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:59,400
She didn't care if l lived or died!
She just ransomed me with cabbage!

679
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:03,321
The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading ofpassengers.

680
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:09,597
l told you not to park there.

681
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:16,918
She double-crossed us.
We'll triple-cross her.

682
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:21,279
But this time, we'll kidnap Miss Crock
like l said we do in the first place.

683
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:23,520
No, man, it's over.

684
00:51:35,087 --> 00:51:39,365
Listen, sorry l had to leave so,
you know, quickly the other day.

685
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:41,683
That's all right, speedy.

686
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:44,236
l know you had a crime wave to get to.

687
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:46,677
So what do you need tonight? Dynamite?

688
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:49,520
Nitro? A getaway driver, maybe?

689
00:51:49,847 --> 00:51:53,157
No. None of that.
Our gang's gone straight.

690
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:56,999
All l need now is a new life.

691
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:02,761
Willard!

692
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:04,680
Answer the door.

693
00:52:08,727 --> 00:52:10,638
Honest to God, he kills me.

694
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,082
His father never would have
goofed off like this.

695
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:15,886
He's never around when.... l'm coming!

696
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:22,078
-Who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

697
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,203
This is who the hell l am!

698
00:52:25,047 --> 00:52:27,003
l'm wanted by every cop in Pittsburgh!

699
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:30,602
-l don't even know what l did wrong!
-Oh, my God.

700
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:34,077
You're the son of a bitch
who's got my money!

701
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:36,635
What money? l never got no $100,000.

702
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:38,723
$100,000 my ass!

703
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:42,203
-lt was five million big ones!
-What are you, batty?

704
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:45,040
-The deal was for $100,000.
-What deal?

705
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:48,039
-You ripped me off!
-Yeah?

706
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,879
Good shot, huh?

707
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,396
Would you get the hell out of my house?

708
00:52:57,767 --> 00:52:58,916
Where's Willard?

709
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,804
-Where's Willard?
-Where is he?

710
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:03,560
-You want Willard? l'll get him.
-Don't do that to me!

711
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,286
-You think l'm stupid?
-l'll get him!

712
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:09,165
-You sons of bitches ain't ripping me off!
-Holy shit!

713
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,603
-Go on!
-Oh, my God! Help me!

714
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:17,799
-Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
-Come here, sweetie pie!

715
00:53:18,007 --> 00:53:20,396
-God!
-l got you!

716
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:23,559
l got you. Watch your head.

717
00:53:28,047 --> 00:53:29,241
Come on!

718
00:53:31,487 --> 00:53:34,047
Muffin! Muffin, attack!

719
00:53:38,207 --> 00:53:39,560
Nice doggy.

720
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:42,602
Please, attack!

721
00:53:45,007 --> 00:53:45,803
Come on!

722
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,438
Miss Crock, l got news for you!
l'm quitting!

723
00:53:55,807 --> 00:53:57,684
Miss Crock, where are you?

724
00:53:58,207 --> 00:54:01,324
-Hey, Miss Crock!
-l got some news for you, whore!

725
00:54:01,407 --> 00:54:04,240
l'm packing up
and moving out of this dump!

726
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:07,683
That's right, you heard me!
Good-bye, pie hag!

727
00:54:11,607 --> 00:54:13,040
Where's she at?

728
00:54:24,247 --> 00:54:25,316
Oh, my God!

729
00:54:25,607 --> 00:54:27,484
Grover stole my idea.

730
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:30,718
Virginia! Where are you? We're late.

731
00:54:31,287 --> 00:54:33,926
Virginia, the party starts at 9:00.
Are you ready?

732
00:54:36,847 --> 00:54:40,442
-What's going on here?
-We were just turning down the sheets.

733
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:42,205
Where's Miss Crock?

734
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:45,199
Who are you?
What's that note in your hand?

735
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:52,924
What'd you do that for?

736
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:55,046
l was scared.

737
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:58,960
-What do we do now?
-Run!

738
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:04,116
-This is so bad!
-Jesus forgive me!

739
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,685
Help. Police.

740
00:55:14,287 --> 00:55:16,084
That stupid Grover!

741
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,556
What kind of kidnapper
uses his own stationery?

742
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:21,115
You know, they're gonna catch him,
and when they do...

743
00:55:21,207 --> 00:55:23,641
...he's gonna blab all about us!

744
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:31,158
They're hunting us down!

745
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,439
Stop! This is the police!

746
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,400
-Well, no shit!
-Let's jump that fence!

747
00:55:41,607 --> 00:55:44,724
-l'm getting a charley horse!
-l gotta start working out!

748
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:53,596
Freeze! You're under arrest!

749
00:55:56,047 --> 00:55:57,924
Details are sketchy,
butin a twiststranger than bizarre...

750
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:00,726
...Miss Virginia Crock herself
has been kidnapped.

751
00:56:01,727 --> 00:56:02,637
Oh, my God!

752
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:06,037
Snowball. Baby, let me in!

753
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:08,279
Open up!

754
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:12,800
-Have you heard the news?
-Yes, l know. lt's terrible.

755
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,923
-What are we gonna do?
-l don't know.

756
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:21,044
-But this is not our fault.
-You said it wouldn't hurt anyone!

757
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,005
You said if we switched the money
nothing would happen.

758
00:56:24,087 --> 00:56:25,600
The kidnappers would be stuck!

759
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:28,645
All l meant was
that they couldn't complain to the police.

760
00:56:28,727 --> 00:56:30,319
Now we've pissed them off!

761
00:56:30,407 --> 00:56:33,160
You deserve that money.
She's been a figurehead for years.

762
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:34,118
Oh, stop it!

763
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:36,721
You're the only one
holding that bakery together.

764
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:38,798
l had to. She's out of her mind.

765
00:56:38,887 --> 00:56:43,802
Exactly. So, why don't we
just let the kidnappers keep her?

766
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:48,364
Get me out of here!

767
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:51,883
The pain! I got a medical condition.

768
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:54,044
All right, Fillmore. Time to talk.

769
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:56,197
My dick hurts!

770
00:57:00,327 --> 00:57:04,240
l want the truth. What's your connection
to Rusty P. Hayes?

771
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:07,956
l've known Rusty my whole life.
Our mothers were in church choir together.

772
00:57:08,127 --> 00:57:10,960
l don't even know this chauffeur guy,
all right?

773
00:57:11,047 --> 00:57:13,925
The first time l seen him
was in my restaurant, two weeks ago.

774
00:57:14,007 --> 00:57:16,521
Last night, like every week,
l called up Rusty...

775
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:19,360
...and told him to come
and watch Monday Night Football.

776
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:21,438
Last night was Thursday.

777
00:57:22,327 --> 00:57:25,603
Yeah. l'm sorry. lt wasn't
Monday Night Football. lt was Oprah.

778
00:57:25,687 --> 00:57:28,645
Last night, l get this call
to make a delivery...

779
00:57:28,807 --> 00:57:30,718
...to this Wilbur guy.

780
00:57:30,887 --> 00:57:33,037
You mean, Willard.

781
00:57:33,127 --> 00:57:35,402
Yeah, right. Willard.

782
00:57:35,527 --> 00:57:40,203
So anyway, l drive up to this mansion
in my chicken delivery truck.

783
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:44,764
You know your truck was impounded
at the airport earlier that day?

784
00:57:44,847 --> 00:57:46,405
lt was?

785
00:57:47,127 --> 00:57:50,039
Yeah, right. No, l was on foot.

786
00:57:50,287 --> 00:57:53,836
So anyway, the doorbell rings,
and it's the kidnappers!

787
00:57:54,247 --> 00:57:57,000
So, they started chasing us.

788
00:57:57,087 --> 00:57:59,123
And then Miss Crock,
l remember she showed up.

789
00:57:59,207 --> 00:58:03,200
She ran in, and she'd just been taking
a bath, so she was nude.

790
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:05,403
Of course, naturally, this upset everybody.

791
00:58:05,487 --> 00:58:07,717
Gunshots started going off, man.

792
00:58:07,807 --> 00:58:10,241
The windows was exploding,
l heard screaming.

793
00:58:10,327 --> 00:58:12,795
So, l run to my truck as fast as l can.

794
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:16,966
l mean, l run away because l was scared.

795
00:58:17,047 --> 00:58:21,962
Chip Oswald says you hit him
over the head with a desk lamp.

796
00:58:23,687 --> 00:58:25,837
No, he's mistaken.

797
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:28,123
He's mistaken. That was not me.

798
00:58:28,207 --> 00:58:31,836
So, Rusty's got this desk lamp
and he's beating the hell out of Chip.

799
00:58:31,927 --> 00:58:34,760
And, he's pounding him and pounding him.

800
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:37,043
Then l say:

801
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:40,961
''Rusty, that's not the kidnappers.
That's Chip!''

802
00:58:41,247 --> 00:58:44,239
That's when the cops showed up
and they distracted everybody...

803
00:58:45,007 --> 00:58:46,645
...and the kidnappers got away.

804
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:49,763
One final question.

805
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:53,605
Let's forget all this other crap.

806
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:56,602
Where is Miss Crock?

807
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:58,043
l don't know.

808
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:00,919
Who is Miss Crock?

809
00:59:04,047 --> 00:59:05,526
Come on. Open your mouth.

810
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:07,677
Come on. You want some food, Blackie?

811
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:09,359
Eat some dinner.

812
00:59:09,887 --> 00:59:12,355
Eat it, Blackie. lt's good. Look.

813
00:59:13,127 --> 00:59:15,436
-Come on, Blackie.
-His name is Muffin.

814
00:59:15,607 --> 00:59:17,245
lt is not Blackie.

815
00:59:17,727 --> 00:59:19,046
Shut up!

816
00:59:19,287 --> 00:59:23,280
The dog's name is what l say it is
until somebody takes you off my hands.

817
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:26,359
The sooner the better, Poopy.
The sooner the better!

818
00:59:26,447 --> 00:59:28,642
-Yeah, go on!
-''Yeah, go on!''

819
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:31,686
Help!

820
00:59:33,207 --> 00:59:36,756
That's my favorite TV program.
We're gonna watch it, Blackie.

821
00:59:36,847 --> 00:59:39,919
This is it. Look at that. See that?

822
00:59:40,687 --> 00:59:42,040
Hawaii Five-0.

823
00:59:42,967 --> 00:59:46,482
-What have we got, Danno?
-Klaus Marburg. West German passport.

824
00:59:46,607 --> 00:59:47,835
-How bad?
-How bad?

825
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:50,487
-Pretty bad. Went right through him.
-Any witnesses?

826
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:52,444
-Any witnesses?
-Yeah, lots of them.

827
00:59:52,687 --> 00:59:54,564
-Only one shot?
-Only one shot?

828
00:59:54,647 --> 00:59:55,443
Just one.

829
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:59,316
He was hitjust after
he stepped off the ramp.

830
00:59:59,407 --> 01:00:02,604
Steve, take a look. Finished.

831
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:06,680
What is your obsession with that guy?

832
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:09,160
lt's Jack Lord!

833
01:00:09,287 --> 01:00:12,085
l'm the vice president
of his national fan club.

834
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:14,205
Clam up, will you?

835
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:20,998
Hey! What are you, crazy?

836
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:25,118
The show's not over yet.

837
01:00:25,287 --> 01:00:26,925
Give me that.

838
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,525
-Excuse me. May I have your attention?
-Oh, my God.

839
01:00:33,607 --> 01:00:36,041
I'm pleased to announce
that Miss Crock's Bakery...

840
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:38,516
...is now merging
with Copenhagen Snak Food.

841
01:00:38,727 --> 01:00:41,241
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Additionally...

842
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:44,757
...in accordance with Miss Crock's policy
regarding kidnapping...

843
01:00:44,847 --> 01:00:48,044
...we will notpay the ransom.

844
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:51,842
I know Miss Crock will be proud of us
standing behind herlike this.

845
01:00:51,927 --> 01:00:55,317
Hey, wait a minute.
l'm gonna get screwed on this deal.

846
01:00:58,127 --> 01:01:00,163
That's two dozen anthuriums.

847
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:08,243
What?

848
01:01:08,687 --> 01:01:11,565
What did l do? Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

849
01:01:11,647 --> 01:01:13,717
l swear l'm innocent!

850
01:01:14,127 --> 01:01:15,879
No, please! Don't!

851
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:19,403
-Who's the crybaby?
-We just busted the guy.

852
01:01:19,527 --> 01:01:23,315
He was trying to pass the marked bills
from the Fillmore kidnapping.

853
01:01:23,407 --> 01:01:24,999
Well, what do you know?

854
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:27,726
The brains behind the operation.

855
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:29,486
Get me Fillmore and Hayes!

856
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:31,956
-Don't tell them about Grover.
-Why not?

857
01:01:32,047 --> 01:01:34,766
Things are bad enough
without us getting blamed...

858
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,122
...for killing that old midget
at the wax museum.

859
01:01:38,247 --> 01:01:40,681
-Maybe we should tell them the truth.
-Yeah, right.

860
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:44,043
Like they'll believe it started
'cause we kidnapped Muffin's turd.

861
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:47,526
There you are. Get in here! Sit down!

862
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:54,287
The days of dicking Dewey are over.

863
01:01:54,527 --> 01:01:57,963
We found the kidnapper.
Your partner extraordinaire...

864
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,685
...he's in our custody.

865
01:01:59,767 --> 01:02:02,201
So, tell me all about Roger.

866
01:02:03,447 --> 01:02:04,277
Who?

867
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:06,325
Oh, no.

868
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:08,564
You can't play those games anymore.

869
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:10,643
We nailed him with marked bills.

870
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,922
All that $5 million was traceable.

871
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:14,998
What $5 million? Miss Crock never paid.

872
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,197
What do you mean, she never paid?

873
01:02:23,127 --> 01:02:24,196
l don't know.

874
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:26,596
You just said Miss Crock never paid.

875
01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:28,325
What do you mean, she never paid?

876
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:31,126
-l didn't say that.
-You did. l heard you say that.

877
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:32,845
You said, ''Miss Crock never paid.''

878
01:02:32,927 --> 01:02:34,599
l wanna know what you meant by that.

879
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,562
-l don't know.
-What did you mean by that?

880
01:02:38,647 --> 01:02:41,241
What did you mean,
Miss Crock never paid?

881
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:42,806
What did he mean by that?

882
01:02:47,007 --> 01:02:49,885
What the hell are you doing?
That man's a cop!

883
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:52,126
l was scared.

884
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:55,882
Every time you're scared,
you hit a guy with a desk lamp!

885
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,365
l'm getting out of here.

886
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:09,320
-Who gave you the marked money?
-l don't know!

887
01:03:09,407 --> 01:03:12,046
lt was change in a restaurant.

888
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:15,523
lf you don't tell us,
you're spending three years in hard labor.

889
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:18,878
lt was Chip Oswald.

890
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:27,040
Come on!

891
01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:39,003
Willard, this is a cop car.
Should we really be taking a cop car?

892
01:03:39,927 --> 01:03:41,440
l'm gonna kill you!

893
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:44,517
Put your ass to the gas! Go!

894
01:03:48,687 --> 01:03:51,281
-Where are we going?
-l don't know!

895
01:03:56,687 --> 01:03:59,121
Shit. We're not making things any better.

896
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:01,801
We gotta find Miss Crock and Grover
and clear this up.

897
01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:04,117
How we gonna do that?
We know nothing about him.

898
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:07,756
We don't know where he lives, how
to reach him. He's a complete mystery.

899
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:10,281
Hold on. l got an idea.

900
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:14,319
Directory assistance. What city?

901
01:04:14,407 --> 01:04:16,967
Pittsburgh. Grover Cleaver.

902
01:04:17,047 --> 01:04:19,641
-Is that a business or residence?
-Residence.

903
01:04:19,727 --> 01:04:22,287
-Is that Kleaver with a ''K''?
-No, with a ''C''...

904
01:04:22,367 --> 01:04:24,323
...like ''cupcake.''

905
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:28,362
Thank you. Press 1 to be connected.

906
01:04:29,567 --> 01:04:30,317
Got it.

907
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:36,763
Aloha. You've reached
the Jack Lord Fan Club.

908
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:40,164
-For membership, send $25...
-l got the Jack Lord Fan Club.

909
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:41,965
...to the Jack Lord Fan Club.

910
01:04:42,047 --> 01:04:44,766
-Attention: Grover Cleaver.
-Wait! lt's Grover!

911
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:47,156
He lives at 910 Mabley Terrace.

912
01:04:47,247 --> 01:04:50,319
Mabley Terrace?
That's a shitty neighborhood.

913
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:57,006
Damn it! Turn around!

914
01:05:07,527 --> 01:05:09,085
We got away!

915
01:05:14,047 --> 01:05:17,835
As you can see from oursky-cam
they are traveling in a stolen police car.

916
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:20,487
Again, to recap for those viewers
just tuning in...

917
01:05:20,567 --> 01:05:24,480
...less than 15 minutes ago the two
key suspects in the Crock kidnapping...

918
01:05:24,567 --> 01:05:26,603
...escaped from a downtown police station.

919
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:28,917
We'll stay with this story
until its conclusion.

920
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:41,435
Here we go. l got it all.

921
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:43,918
Here it is.

922
01:05:45,127 --> 01:05:47,322
One box of Fixodent.

923
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:53,042
One bag of prunes for the old chute.

924
01:05:54,447 --> 01:05:57,519
And four pounds of lamb and rice...

925
01:05:57,607 --> 01:05:58,835
...Dog Chow!

926
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:00,280
That's for you.

927
01:06:01,367 --> 01:06:02,880
Where's my Ben-Gay?

928
01:06:02,967 --> 01:06:07,165
You forgot my Ben-Gay, didn't you?
You know my muscles get sore!

929
01:06:07,247 --> 01:06:10,159
''You know my muscles get sore.''
Zip it, you nag!

930
01:06:11,007 --> 01:06:13,919
l wish l never met that dang chauffeur.

931
01:06:14,127 --> 01:06:17,119
Come on. The first rule of life, Blackie:

932
01:06:17,287 --> 01:06:18,879
''Never do no favors.''

933
01:06:18,967 --> 01:06:21,879
You call kidnapping a man
doing him a favor?

934
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,804
l didn't kidnap that guy.
He kidnapped himself.

935
01:06:28,087 --> 01:06:29,645
What did you say?

936
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,763
You ain't gonna take me alive!

937
01:06:52,887 --> 01:06:53,524
Grover!

938
01:06:58,087 --> 01:06:59,998
-Jesus Christ!
-Why is he shooting at us?

939
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:02,237
He thinks we're the police!

940
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:08,039
Grover, we are not the police!
We are not the police!

941
01:07:09,407 --> 01:07:11,921
Try to fool stupid Grover, huh?

942
01:07:12,007 --> 01:07:13,360
l'll show ya!

943
01:07:19,487 --> 01:07:22,365
-Grover, it's us!
-Don't shoot!

944
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:25,883
lt's you guys. Come on up!

945
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:28,199
Hurry up! Hurry up!

946
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:33,962
-Any word yet on that car?
-Yeah, it's been spotted on Mabley Terrace.

947
01:07:34,087 --> 01:07:36,647
Mabley Terrace? Jesus.

948
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:38,805
l'll need some backup. Let's go!

949
01:07:39,167 --> 01:07:43,046
Grover, you have to let Miss Crock go.
Too much shit's going on.

950
01:07:43,127 --> 01:07:46,039
No way! l'm out $18 for groceries.

951
01:07:46,127 --> 01:07:47,276
What?

952
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:50,680
-Here's $20, all right?
-l can't break no $20.

953
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:53,156
-Keep the change!
-All right.

954
01:07:55,687 --> 01:08:00,363
-Miss Crock, we're here to rescue you.
-How dare you kidnap yourself!

955
01:08:01,447 --> 01:08:04,245
You tried to swindle me?

956
01:08:04,527 --> 01:08:07,644
l am going to have your ass!

957
01:08:08,007 --> 01:08:10,760
-Miss Crock, l'm sorry.
-What nerve!

958
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:13,317
After all l've done for you.

959
01:08:13,407 --> 01:08:17,002
l was under a lot of pressure, and l....

960
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:21,119
After all you've done for me?

961
01:08:25,327 --> 01:08:28,558
Willard Fillmore,
the building is surrounded!

962
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:31,605
What exactly, Miss Crock,
did you ever do for me?

963
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:34,963
l've been your slave for 15 years!
l worked my butt off!

964
01:08:35,047 --> 01:08:38,676
And then, when l got kidnapped,
you wouldn't even pay the ransom money!

965
01:08:38,887 --> 01:08:41,242
Well, after all, you...

966
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:44,280
-...were just a hired servant.
-Hired....

967
01:08:45,047 --> 01:08:48,483
Well, does a hired servant
watch TV with you when you're lonely?

968
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:53,124
Does a hired servant read to you
that time you broke your glasses?

969
01:08:53,527 --> 01:08:57,122
Does a hired servant visit you
in the hospital when nobody else does?

970
01:08:57,487 --> 01:08:59,876
l did everything my father would've.

971
01:09:03,887 --> 01:09:05,161
Not everything.

972
01:09:07,207 --> 01:09:10,756
Your father was, a very special man.

973
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:15,760
He provided extra services.

974
01:09:18,127 --> 01:09:20,004
Oh, my God.

975
01:09:20,127 --> 01:09:23,119
Your dad didn't say,
''Stick with Miss Crock. You'll get ahead.''

976
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:26,643
He said, ''Stick with Miss Crock
and you'll get head.''

977
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:30,117
Would you butt out? We're talking here!

978
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,720
Yuck!

979
01:09:32,927 --> 01:09:35,361
Let's move!

980
01:09:39,487 --> 01:09:41,637
-Can you see them?
-They're on the third floor.

981
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:43,402
Oh, man!

982
01:09:43,487 --> 01:09:45,523
That's why l couldn't compare to my dad?

983
01:09:45,607 --> 01:09:48,758
Now, don't be silly. lt's just that...

984
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:51,998
...your father was very gifted.

985
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:55,045
-That's some big shoes to fill.
-l don't wanna hear this!

986
01:09:55,127 --> 01:09:58,085
Man, you must've been a total let down.

987
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:00,635
No wonder she ransomed you
with an empty suitcase.

988
01:10:00,727 --> 01:10:03,036
That suitcase wasn't empty.

989
01:10:04,487 --> 01:10:05,806
l paid every cent.

990
01:10:05,887 --> 01:10:08,685
Then why do Roger and Chip
have the money?

991
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:11,042
Roger and Chip?

992
01:10:13,927 --> 01:10:17,602
Stop! Don't shoot!
They're stupid and confused!

993
01:10:17,687 --> 01:10:19,996
Position! Move out!

994
01:10:20,087 --> 01:10:22,396
-l'm going in.
-Come on!

995
01:10:22,847 --> 01:10:24,519
l can't believe it.

996
01:10:24,727 --> 01:10:29,721
l can't believe Chip shafted me.

997
01:10:30,287 --> 01:10:31,800
l can't believe you came through.

998
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:33,400
Beaver team, move in! Go!

999
01:10:37,527 --> 01:10:39,358
lt's like an army out there.

1000
01:10:40,607 --> 01:10:43,758
l'm on parole for mail fraud. l gotta hide.

1001
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,323
-How'd you get in there, man?
-l mean...

1002
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:54,204
-Come on, Grover!
-...l...

1003
01:10:54,287 --> 01:10:58,838
...took care of all of Chip's gambling debts.

1004
01:10:59,407 --> 01:11:02,956
l paid for all his methadone treatments.

1005
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:06,802
l guess we both got the big screw.

1006
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:10,118
Come on, Grover!

1007
01:11:11,127 --> 01:11:13,482
Don't move! Hayes and Fillmore...

1008
01:11:13,567 --> 01:11:16,923
...you're under arrest, again,
for the abduction of Virginia Crock.

1009
01:11:17,007 --> 01:11:19,202
And this time, it's gonna stick!

1010
01:11:21,287 --> 01:11:23,517
You clod.

1011
01:11:23,967 --> 01:11:26,356
They didn't kidnap me.

1012
01:11:26,447 --> 01:11:28,881
They rescued me.

1013
01:11:29,287 --> 01:11:33,565
lf Willard hadn't shown up,
l'd be dead and buried in this hellhole!

1014
01:11:34,047 --> 01:11:37,517
l don't understand.
Then who's the kidnapper?

1015
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:44,725
First, l wanna upgrade the assembly line.

1016
01:11:44,807 --> 01:11:47,446
Toss out minced meat.

1017
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:49,398
Bring in vanilla custard.

1018
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:53,761
Then, l'm gonna mix
strawberry into the rhubarb.

1019
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,481
Freeze! You're under arrest.

1020
01:12:01,927 --> 01:12:03,280
Chip Oswald...

1021
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:07,246
...you are under arrest for the kidnappings
of Willard Fillmore and Virginia Crock.

1022
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:10,637
That is ridiculous! How dare you!

1023
01:12:10,807 --> 01:12:13,162
l demand you leave my house!

1024
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:21,397
Put on your pants. You're going to jail.

1025
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:24,042
All right, let's get them hands
behind your back.

1026
01:12:25,247 --> 01:12:27,841
Oh, my God! lt's the new Village People.

1027
01:12:28,847 --> 01:12:30,838
-You're all crazy!
-Put down that gun!

1028
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:33,566
-l'm not going back to prison!
-What do you mean...

1029
01:12:33,647 --> 01:12:35,205
-...''back''?
-Up yours!

1030
01:12:35,287 --> 01:12:39,724
l've got nothing from all of those years
of suffering, working for you!

1031
01:12:39,807 --> 01:12:42,002
-Nobody does.
-Stay out of this!

1032
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:44,958
l'll see you all in hell!

1033
01:12:45,487 --> 01:12:48,399
l'll slice you and l'll dice you...

1034
01:12:48,487 --> 01:12:51,285
...and l'll bake you all into meat pies!

1035
01:12:58,847 --> 01:13:01,407
Well, it's an ugly ending,
but the case is solved.

1036
01:13:01,607 --> 01:13:04,246
l knew he was the kidnapper
the whole time.

1037
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:07,484
Never trust a black man named Chip.

1038
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:16,202
This is so beautiful.

1039
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:19,965
-l could spend the rest of my life here.
-Yeah.

1040
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:22,959
And we found a place
where almost everyone speaks English.

1041
01:13:33,767 --> 01:13:36,076
There's my juicy, succulent chicken.
Come here.

1042
01:13:36,887 --> 01:13:39,321
-How's business, baby?
-Great, Rusty.

1043
01:13:39,407 --> 01:13:41,284
You guys got a package.

1044
01:13:44,207 --> 01:13:45,242
Look.

1045
01:13:45,647 --> 01:13:47,160
lt's from Miss Crock.

1046
01:13:47,767 --> 01:13:49,519
What did she send?

1047
01:13:52,847 --> 01:13:56,362
-Check it out. lt's an Armani suit.
-And there's a letter.

1048
01:14:00,487 --> 01:14:04,560
''Dear Willard, I hope you're enjoying
your retirement money.

1049
01:14:04,647 --> 01:14:08,799
''Here's a suityou can wear
when you graduate from U.S.C.

1050
01:14:09,127 --> 01:14:12,676
''Back in Pittsburgh,
I decided not to sell the company.

1051
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:16,476
''And I have a new man in my life.

1052
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:19,163
''Grover's quite special.

1053
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:23,675
''He's a little slow,
but he does what he's told.

1054
01:14:24,007 --> 01:14:27,124
''So, thanks again forintroducing us.

1055
01:14:27,487 --> 01:14:30,285
''Your everlasting friend, Virginia.''
