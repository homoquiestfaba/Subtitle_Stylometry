1
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,433
my senior year at the chandler
academy private school

2
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,302
began like any other.

3
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:37,570
unfortunately, rich kids
whose parents sent them

4
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,706
to private school either
out of tradition or

5
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,109
the misguided notion that if
you pay tuition to go to

6
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,343
high school, you're somehow
better off

7
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:43,977
than in public school.

8
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,678
wrong.

9
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,747
this place is as bad
as a public school.

10
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:51,451
maybe even worse.
the uniforms, the bureaucracy,

11
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,753
the conformity and most of
these guys conformed,

12
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,723
except for my friends.

13
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,792
this is marcus rattner,
one of my two best friends.

14
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,429
i think if you said marcus
was a trouble maker,

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,731
that would be an understatement.
i don't think i remember

16
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,267
one week in the whole time
that i've known him

17
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,702
where he was neither in
trouble with the police

18
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,439
nor in trouble with the school.
i don't think he does that

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,441
intentionally, he just can't
help himself. of course,

20
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,809
doing dumb stuff like this,

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,447
probably isn't making it
any easier. head mrs. grimes,

22
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,382
for some reason
she singled us out,

23
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:27,620
watched us like a hawk.
maybe because we were

24
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,158
outcasts we became
easy targets for her.

25
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:39,899
if marcus was the troublemaker,
then matt slaton,

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,302
my other best friend,
was the con-artist.

27
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,036
always playing poker,
starting betting pools,

28
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,175
and working some scam.

29
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,324
as you can see, i had
my work cut out for me,

30
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,459
because the law of
averages states,

31
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,496
for every john van-owen,
a.k.a. me, there has to be

32
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:12,465
an equal and opposite number,
and there he is,

33
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,702
harlan ratliff.
i mean, look at this guy.

34
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,604
he's prettier than most of
the girls i've gone out with,

35
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,773
and you just knew this
guy was set for life.

36
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,210
there he is now,
showing off his pecs,

37
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,612
with his two toys,
randall and alex.

38
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:30,317
now, to set this up for you.
alex, that's this guy here.

39
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:36,756
he's dating trini,
she's the one on the left.

40
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,597
and meanwhile, ta-da,
that's me, john van-owen,

41
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,998
giving mary,
she's the one on the right,

42
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,236
the thousand-yard stare.
do i even need to tell you

43
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,639
what happens next?

44
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,305
see what i mean?
of course i had no idea

45
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,540
at that time
that headmistress grimes,

46
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,577
harlan ratliff and the whole
rich doggie-poor dog system

47
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:33,580
at chandler academy was going
to be the least of my problems.

48
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:37,685
and my life was about
to change forever.

49
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:43,691
(cards shuffling)

50
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,733
okay guys, now moving
right along.

51
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,703
these are the stocks
of salem's town square,

52
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,005
and they were used
as a form of punishment

53
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,975
for what we would consider
a felony misdemeanor today.

54
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,178
now these are ceremonial
knives, believed to be used by

55
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,981
the celtic-andreotic cults
of that times, in other words,

56
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,318
witches and warlocks.

57
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,387
this dagger called
spirit's tooth

58
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,789
was the main tool
used by a witch or warlock

59
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,559
during this period.
and they used it

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,462
in their sacrificing, in
their practicing of alchemy,

61
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,963
in the creation of their spells

62
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:27,334
and incantations,
and to create a bond

63
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:30,069
among the members
of the covenant.

64
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,340
the bodily fluids were shared
or anointed, particularly

65
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,008
blood and tears, things that a

66
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,245
witch or a warlock believed held
a particularly strong bond.

67
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:42,081
needless to say, the spirits

68
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,884
hey, we should have
taken pottery instead.

69
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,355
shut up you idiot, shut up,
you'll get us both in trouble.

70
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:52,759
hey, did you see
who's in our class?

71
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,627
mary stewart, your dream girl.

72
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,997
really?

73
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,667
well, in other words,
for every evil that exists,

74
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,435
there is an equal
and opposite good

75
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:05,104
that is just as powerful
to balance it out.

76
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,973
but of course, we know today

77
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,609
that witches and warlocks
really had no true powers.

78
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,011
any questions so far?
any big words you guys

79
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,380
want me to explain?

80
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:17,183
(cards shuffling)

81
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,620
well, well, well, what's this?

82
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,690
it looks like you're setting
up for a game of poker.

83
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,057
we don't get to the poker
portion of the curriculum

84
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,959
till the second term.

85
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
oh, i'm sorry ms. stevens.
were these cards

86
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,296
distracting you?

87
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:33,265
no, but they might be
distracting you.

88
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,668
because i'm selfish when
it comes to teaching a class.

89
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,770
i like to have everybody's
undivided attention.

90
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,271
well, actually, i've listened to

91
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,408
every word that
you've said so far.

92
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,775
well, i find that
hard to believe,

93
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,076
with you looking like
a las vegas black jack

94
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,978
dealer back here.

95
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:46,979
i'm listening to you.

96
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,748
really?

97
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,617
yes, now that you ask,
i can tell you that i

98
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,284
disagree with much of what
you've just said.

99
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,153
you don't say.

100
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,623
you know, you stand there

101
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:59,025
and you sneer at witches
and warlocks, yet i know that

102
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,060
you wear a crucifix
around your neck.

103
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,996
now, isn't that
a little hypocritical?

104
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,999
how can you be unbiased if you
favor one religion over another.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,668
ross, you're agnostic.

106
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,437
quite the contrary,

107
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,872
i know exactly
what i believe in.

108
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,074
well, i'm happy to hear that.
however, you have to

109
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,477
give up these cards.

110
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,684
personally, i believe in magic.

111
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,153
okay, that was a good trick.
teach that one to me now

112
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,756
that i have a new deck
of cards, i mean.

113
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,191
oh, i'd love to teach
you a trick or two.

114
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:36,697
class dismissed.

115
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:47,306
hey john, you got a minute?
it's nothing heavy, i promise.

116
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,041
i just want to congratulate
you on your history paper.

117
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,477
you got an a.

118
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,279
really? wow.

119
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,381
it's my pleasure. believe me,

120
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,650
it makes me feel like
i'm doing something right.

121
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,251
well, i always did love history.

122
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,189
well, it shows. look, i know you

123
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,492
feel like you get
dumped on around here.

124
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,494
but you are an
excellent student,

125
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,696
and i like having you
in this class.

126
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,898
i know it's tough to
fit in a place like this.

127
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:12,700
yeah.

128
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:15,502
just hang in there.

129
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:18,738
if you ever need anyone to talk
to, if you have a problem,

130
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,240
if you just want some help,
then please come to me.

131
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,609
okay.

132
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,943
you've got someone
looking out for you.

133
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,847
now go catch up
with your friends.

134
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,882
so what did ms. stevens want?

135
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,018
i got an a in my history paper.

136
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,789
hey, not too shabby.
so what's the problem?

137
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,994
look, the reason
i never ask mary out

138
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,229
is because she is one
of the popular people

139
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,933
and i'm not.

140
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,535
do you know what everybody
here thinks of

141
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,903
guys like you and me and marcus?

142
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,304
they think we're freaks that
wound up here by accident.

143
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,940
what?

144
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,075
hey you finally
flipped out john.

145
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,410
i mean, you're not
a bad looking guy.

146
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,447
if you were a girl i'd do you.

147
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:04,917
don't you ever want to fit in?
just once in a while?

148
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,153
i don't want to be
like everyone else.

149
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,288
i want to be better
than everyone else.

150
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,323
hi john, you got a minute?

151
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:16,262
oh, how did that happen?

152
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:20,432
see you around, poor boy.

153
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,702
hi yourself.

154
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,737
i wanted to talk to you.

155
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,906
i'm sorry about earlier today.

156
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,409
oh, forget it, actually,
i'm mad at you.

157
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,412
me? why?

158
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,815
well, i'd been waiting for you

159
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,984
to ask me out for like
two years, you idiot.

160
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,987
i didn't think you
even knew i existed.

161
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,790
well, do you care to
start catching up?

162
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,991
you know, you're
making fun of me.

163
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,426
i need to get to biology.

164
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,495
no, wait, we still have some
unresolved issues to deal with.

165
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,631
what are you talking about?

166
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,600
i'm talking about our
first date, silly.

167
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,871
what?

168
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:05,111
listen, i'm a
coffee-and-small-talk gal,

169
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,780
so why don't you say,
we go to the v cafe,

170
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,683
friday, around eightish?

171
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,385
i don't put out unless
you spring for dinner.

172
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,988
one hurdle at a time, don juan.

173
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,490
why don't we start out
with the latte?

174
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,993
and then we'll work our way up
to a real date this weekend.

175
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,129
the school's out
for semestral break.

176
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,997
a real date?

177
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,666
yeah.

178
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:31,237
so, friday, coffee, 8.
don't be late

179
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:38,645
or i'll kill you.

180
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:42,215
a real date.

181
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:56,188
hi marcus.

182
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,424
i'm surprised you jog
as much as you smoke.

183
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:02,795
yeah, i'm trying to cut back,
on the jogging.

184
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,733
good one, rattner,
you dig it, jogging?

185
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:10,436
yeah, what's going on, harlan?

186
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,504
i mean, why are you all of
a sudden being nice to me?

187
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,473
hell, man, i'm just trying
to make conversation.

188
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,275
i can't be a jerk all the time.

189
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,444
i figured what the hell,
rattner's okay.

190
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,412
i don't know about slaton
and john van-owen,

191
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,815
but rattner's alright.

192
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,284
i'm flattered man, thanks.

193
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,219
i'm flattered, he says.

194
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,887
that nut.

195
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:28,421
you mean, he wasn't
bowled over by your

196
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,522
sparkling personality?

197
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,159
how is it going, marcus?

198
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,260
we do this every afternoon.
how come we've never seen you

199
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,995
here before?

200
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,365
oh, you know,
i just started this week.

201
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,167
marcus is alright.

202
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,870
yeah, too bad about
his lame friends.

203
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,973
hey, ease up, okay?
i mean, i'd take it

204
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,607
personally if someone
talked about my lame friends.

205
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,809
screw you, harlan.

206
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,610
it's time to hit the lockers.

207
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:52,212
i'm done.

208
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,545
me too.

209
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,883
later.

210
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:00,486
you coming?

211
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,189
well, sure man. you bet.

212
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:08,455
(showers sprinkling)

213
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,992
man, i'm ready for
semestral break.

214
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,994
you've got big plans?

215
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,228
well, i don't know.
is getting butt-ass wasted

216
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,864
for a week considered
a big plan?

217
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,866
sounds like a good idea to me.

218
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,167
trini's folks
are going out of town,

219
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,069
we've got the whole place
to ourselves.

220
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,904
you guys finally going
to do the deed?

221
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,738
hey man, what is that?

222
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,041
yeah, what is that, alex?

223
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,310
you want to know what this is?

224
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,711
sure.

225
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,046
it's a permanent marker.

226
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,015
india ink, you get it

227
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,285
on your skin and it
almost never comes off.

228
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:46,894
i don't get it.

229
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,496
stop it, man. come on, guys.

230
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,565
nice view, marcus, are you sure
you've never done this before?

231
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,567
stop, harlan.

232
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,570
keep screaming, marcus.
the doors are locked,

233
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,705
and we're just going to
be in here for hours.

234
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,074
i made sure of it.

235
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,709
what are you doing, man?

236
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,214
you mean, what am i going to
do? kill you, maybe, or worse.

237
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,216
i don't think he's ready to
settle down just yet harlan.

238
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,285
maybe you should have
taken him to dinner first.

239
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,088
well, i can tell you this much,
rattner, it won't hurt you much.

240
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,789
all i want to do is write
a little message,

241
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,725
just an itty-bitty one.

242
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,229
let me go. let me go.

243
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,464
don't make it any worse
than it is.

244
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,501
randall and alex here,
get in a few good kicks,

245
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:36,176
once i write a little message
on your cute little butt.

246
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,680
hmm, what should we do here?

247
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:45,051
how about mother?

248
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:49,355
good choice, but no.
i have something better.

249
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:56,395
i know, i'll write
my pussy on his back,

250
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,697
with an arrow pointing down.

251
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,666
you guys are going to
get expelled for this.

252
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,702
really? at this point,
grimes would believe me

253
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,637
even if i told her
you did it to yourself,

254
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,275
then showed us like
we were interested.

255
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:15,847
now don't move or this is
just going to hurt worse.

256
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,285
good morning, fellas.

257
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:26,059
why don't you breeze
the hell out of here, you kid?

258
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,659
that was easy.

259
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,396
i don't think

260
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,198
you realize just what kind of
trouble you're getting into.

261
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,566
i'm going to kill you,
stop screwing around.

262
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,602
i don't see it
in your eyes, harlan.

263
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,471
i don't see you killing
anybody. as a matter of fact,

264
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,240
would you like to see
which one of us ends up dead?

265
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,175
i bet it's going to be you.

266
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,543
look, we weren't going
to do anything to him.

267
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,378
we were just going to scare him.

268
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,015
well, now that it's you and not
him, i think it's even funnier.

269
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:53,352
let's see, you were going to
write my pussy on his back.

270
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,755
i like that. instead, i'm going
to write it on your face,

271
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,325
with an arrow pointing to
your cute little mouth.

272
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:04,263
come on, harlan. i thought
you were going to kill me.

273
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:07,066
you're dead. you wait.

274
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,868
oh come on, i don't
like to wait.

275
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,070
why don't you and your little
girlfriends come back here

276
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:18,277
and finish this up right now?

277
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,480
this isn't really a
good town after all huh?

278
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,315
where the hell did
you come from?

279
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,816
not that i'm complaining
or anything.

280
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:31,190
i'm new, kid.

281
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,227
(thunderstorm)

282
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,770
where the hell have
you been all day?

283
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:45,904
yeah, we looked for
you at the commissary.

284
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,673
are you guys busy?

285
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,974
i just got to whip

286
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,510
john's butt with a five-card
stud, but otherwise, no.

287
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,079
i've got to start
my latin studies.

288
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,780
well, drop it both of you.

289
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,715
are we going to party?

290
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,484
let's just say i've got
a fourth for bridge.

291
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,219
what the hell are
you talking about?

292
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,088
listen, if i sat down
and told you guys

293
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,090
what happened to me today, we'd
be here all freaking night.

294
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,191
come on, i'll tell
you on the way.

295
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:09,662
on the way to where?

296
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:19,472
are you sure about this, marcus?

297
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,107
why?

298
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,008
yeah, shouldn't this place be
locked up or something?

299
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,745
guys, this is a private school.

300
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,115
they would never lock
anything up around here.

301
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,950
besides, this door's
open 24 hours.

302
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,919
come on, he's waiting inside.

303
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,656
who's waiting for us inside?

304
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,796
the new guy.

305
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,166
yeah, you could do
all those card tricks.

306
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,701
of course. i'm luc, and you are?

307
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,935
john van-owen.

308
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,172
matt.

309
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,706
are you guys getting in or what?

310
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,377
i'm game.

311
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,428
so, where are you from
anyway, luc?

312
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,997
all over the place.

313
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,966
your parents move around a lot?

314
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:04,436
no, i never really got the
chance to know my mom.

315
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,339
i just grew up like
i never had one.

316
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,544
as for my dad, well, me and my
dad don't get along anymore.

317
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,847
i got into some trouble
a while back, got kicked out.

318
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,384
all we do is fight,
even in the long distance.

319
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,218
don't leave me out on that, man.

320
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,589
my parents couldn't give a damn
if i rotted in here or in jail.

321
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,624
except it sounds better
at the country club

322
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,694
when they tell their rich
friends that i'm away at school,

323
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:32,498
you know, instead of minimum
security over at riverview.

324
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:37,068
my parents wanted to
put me on prozac.

325
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,539
yeah, this is a great place.

326
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,541
i'm surprised you guys
haven't done this before.

327
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,942
yeah, it sounds like
you're planning to

328
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,944
make this a regular thing.

329
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,347
i would say.

330
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,850
so, what's the deal
with this harlan guy?

331
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,719
you guys act like you
see anti-christ or something.

332
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,554
he's not.

333
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,290
he's just a weak little boy
trapped in a man's body.

334
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,527
would you see him as
he really is?

335
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:05,397
i tried man, believe me.

336
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,066
well, you're just lashing out
on him because you're angry.

337
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,335
he pushes all the right buttons
and you just go exactly where

338
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:11,069
he wants you to go.

339
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,839
so, what makes you so special?

340
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,774
well, i'm not that different
than anybody else,

341
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,545
except in one way,
one major way.

342
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,647
you see i'm a student
of the soul,

343
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,882
so i've figured it's
not about people,

344
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,352
and gotten to be
really good at it.

345
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:29,555
so if you can figure out
how people operate,

346
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,022
you pretty much know
how to get by in this world.

347
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,460
oh yeah? that's bull
if you ask me.

348
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,627
remember what i told you
about yourself isn't

349
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,897
necessarily pretty,
but it was true.

350
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:42,501
yeah, but it doesn't explain
how you kicked harlan's butt.

351
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,169
i'm here to help.

352
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,372
right.

353
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,839
you guys all have one thing in
common.

354
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,109
you all want something
you can never have.

355
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,412
what if i told you i could
promise you all those things?

356
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,682
right here, right now?

357
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,451
you're just messing
with our heads.

358
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,820
you could rule over
guys like harlan,

359
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,255
and that's just one part of
it, just a small part of it.

360
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,659
you want girls?
you can have them

361
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,960
you want your teachers
to be scared into giving you

362
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,664
good grades and
preferential treatment?

363
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,134
you can have it, too.
you could rule this school.

364
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,570
you could command respect
from your parents,

365
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,839
you could have
anything you want.

366
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,709
oh, yes, all i want to have is
a million dollars in the bank.

367
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,245
all you need is me.
all i ask of you is

368
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:31,650
your friendship, your loyalty
and your honesty.

369
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:35,053
you give me these
three things unconditionally,

370
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:40,025
i'll give you the world. it's
just psychology, hypnosis,

371
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,828
that sort of thing.
some guys in another school

372
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:46,064
that i went to went through
the same ritual with me.

373
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,266
that's how i started to
learn all the things.

374
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,837
that i'm going to teach you.

375
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,439
should we do it?

376
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,641
i don't know.

377
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:59,811
it's symbolic.
you have to trust me.

378
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:04,015
you drink the tears it opens
up your mind. that's all.

379
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:08,086
your subconscious opens up.
remember when ms. stevens

380
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:11,089
was talking about witches
and warlocks in class?

381
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,626
it's the same thing.
magic begins when your mind

382
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:20,098
believes in it. first you
break this taboo,

383
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,334
then i'll show you how
to break ten others.

384
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,571
what ten?

385
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,473
the ones that you're supposed
to follow.

386
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:30,576
the ten commandments.

387
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,844
you break those and all
the conditions that you're

388
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:35,981
brought up with just disappears.

389
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,483
what about murder?

390
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,485
symbolic, remember john.

391
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:43,822
not real.

392
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:50,530
it seems to me, this is a
perfect place for a baptism.

393
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:58,069
i don't know about this.

394
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:03,074
hey what's wrong man?

395
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:10,517
part of the ritual.

396
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:21,426
he's not lying, man.
this is awesome.

397
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,595
you guys have to try this.

398
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:26,533
trust me.
things are about to change.

399
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,597
your turn.

400
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,470
okay.

401
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:08,239
i need extra proof from you.

402
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,411
i need to know that
you really want this.

403
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:18,684
taste them.

404
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:22,622
right to the blue john. that's
why you're here.

405
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,364
god.

406
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,603
god has nothing to do with this.

407
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:39,370
man, i'm telling you,

408
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,642
this is probably the most cool
friday night we've ever had.

409
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,911
did you ever meet someone who
would sell you the world?

410
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,979
somebody who could seduce
you into believing anything,

411
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,617
20 minutes after meeting them?
that's what luc was like.

412
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,752
we were the freaks and
outcasts in a perfect world,

413
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,621
and this stranger was
promising to give us

414
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:57,656
everything we ever longed for.
things we couldn't even admit

415
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:02,728
to each other. and we bought it.

416
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:05,964
what are you guys doing in here?

417
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:09,768
hey, randall.
you remember randall, marcus?

418
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,203
he likes to write messages.

419
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:13,739
look guys, i didn't mean

420
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,642
anything from today.
it's harlan, i mean,

421
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:19,645
you know how harlan is, right?

422
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:22,682
things are about
to change, randall.

423
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:00,906
what's wrong?

424
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,273
you didn't hear?

425
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,475
what's up?

426
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,612
it's randall. they found him in
the pool house this morning.

427
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,114
he drowned last night in the
swimming pool.

428
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,316
yeah, they found an empty bottle

429
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,951
of whiskey by the pool. he
must have gotten drunk and

430
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:15,220
fell in. but he broke his neck.

431
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:18,523
hey, it happens.

432
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:24,329
i guess alcohol and swimming
pools just don't mix well.

433
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,333
guys, randall's dead.
what's going on?

434
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,669
i don't know anything
about it, do you?

435
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,604
he just drowned himself in
the swimming pool. it's not

436
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,508
a great loss, if you ask me.

437
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,845
what's your problem, grimes?

438
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:44,282
see something you like?

439
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,084
man, if i hadn't seen it,
i wouldn't believe it.

440
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,352
what if she expels us?

441
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:50,121
she won't.

442
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:55,393
me and here mrs. grimes have
a whole new understanding.

443
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,362
holy canoly, john.
we're going to be

444
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,630
freaking kings.

445
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,233
thou shall not kill, thou
shall not lie. we had

446
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,169
already begun. luc told us
that we had to break all

447
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,837
ten. and who knows how many
we had already done without

448
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:10,076
even taking note.

449
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,127
and so it began.
we were on our way to

450
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,695
fulfilling our new destinies
in a manner we never

451
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:34,199
envisioned before. our score,
our personal lives

452
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,301
and our own goals. we were
the ones running the show

453
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,669
now. not harlan, nor randall,

454
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,006
not alex. we knocked over
the ten commandments

455
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:43,641
like a stack of dominoes. later,

456
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,243
i would have reason to
suspect that luc used some

457
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,045
wild, unholy mind control powers

458
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,580
on us that night in the
pool house. but now i

459
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,783
believe that this was the
only truth luc ever told us.

460
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,784
the thing driving us was
something that might have

461
00:30:53,785 --> 00:31:01,160
been there all along.

462
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,334
thou shall honor thy
mother and thy father.

463
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,710
jesus christ, lenny,

464
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,445
what's your problem? want
to put the head in head

465
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,581
mistress?

466
00:31:56,582 --> 00:32:00,586
thou shall not take thy
lord's name in vain.

467
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,137
thou shall not
have any god before me.

468
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:57,076
thou shall not worship
thy graven image.

469
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,713
thou shall not
covet thy neighbor's

470
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:41,253
possessions.

471
00:33:56,902 --> 00:34:01,507
thou shall not steal.

472
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:37,375
they had covered
almost all the bases and

473
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,543
somewhere, i knew luc was
getting stronger because

474
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:43,148
of it.

475
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,515
and even though i felt
like i was living

476
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:49,520
in some horrific nightmare, i
knew it was just starting.

477
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,256
i was beginning to get worried.

478
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:55,025
really? why?

479
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,395
well, i haven't seen you
around for a while. you've

480
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,897
been hiding out from me or what?

481
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:04,835
i, i have just been busy.

482
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,404
well, you know we're going
to have a whole week off

483
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:08,906
for semester break. you plan
on being busy then, too,

484
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:09,675
or is it safe for me to
go ahead and buy that

485
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:10,609
diaphragm?

486
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,212
what?

487
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,181
i'm sorry, i was trying
to get your attention

488
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:19,484
off that damn table top.

489
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:23,488
oh, no, i'm sorry. i'm really
screwing up this date.

490
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,190
well, you just seem to be
jumping on every word

491
00:35:24,191 --> 00:35:27,492
i say.

492
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:31,729
oh my god. is that a smile?

493
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,964
it's a start.

494
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,032
thank god, for a second there,

495
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,435
i thought i was losing my touch.

496
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:41,572
no, no, it's definitely not
you. it's just that,

497
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,342
the schoolwork is starting to
pile up on me, that's all.

498
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:45,810
are you sure?

499
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:49,614
i'm totally sure.

500
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:52,350
i mean, is there something
going on? because you've

501
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,452
been acting totally
different. i mean all three

502
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:57,888
of you guys, you know. it's
like you've changed.

503
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,091
why? do you think it's bad?

504
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,861
because i have nice clothes?
because i care about what i

505
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,864
look like? or because i have
confidence now? look,

506
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:07,733
i don't know about you, but
i think it's a change

507
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:09,534
for the better.

508
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:11,302
hey, whoa, just calm down,
okay? that's all well and

509
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,670
good but i liked you
just fine before,

510
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,639
okay?

511
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,710
i'm sorry.

512
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:24,249
listen, i think i know why
you've been acting so weird.

513
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,784
really?

514
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,787
well yeah, i mean, you're
afraid, you know. you just

515
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,322
have this whole thing
in your head

516
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:34,592
about how i might be in
a different class

517
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:35,860
of people than you are in,
that i couldn't possibly be

518
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,062
attracted to you.

519
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:38,864
sounds like you've been talking

520
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:41,932
to good old matt.

521
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:45,303
well, it's possible. but it's
also possible that i

522
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:50,508
might have asked him.

523
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:53,911
listen, i like you a lot,
okay? i wouldn't be here if

524
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:57,648
i didn't. so there must be
something unique about you,

525
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,016
yes?

526
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:02,052
really?

527
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,156
really. i won't lie to you.

528
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,292
of course, unless you were
stinking rich and wanted

529
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:10,828
to put me in your will.

530
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,062
well, i guess i just have to
bear that in mind when i

531
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,500
inherit my first million.

532
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:18,804
promises, promises.

533
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,621
what's wrong?

534
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,423
i've got to get back
to the dorm.

535
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:42,893
john, wait, john.

536
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:46,497
what the hell?

537
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,333
i suppose i've had worse dates,

538
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:55,340
only i don't know when.

539
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:58,576
i was hoping you'd come
here to see me.

540
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,244
did i interrupt something?

541
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:03,514
what do you want?

542
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,849
you don't seem very happy
that i'm here, john.

543
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,485
no, it's not that.

544
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:10,921
john, i like you. i like
marcus and matt, too,

545
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,591
but you're on another level
entirely. you follow your

546
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:17,862
own drummer, i like that.
you're good. you're honest.

547
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:20,631
you're a true friend. and
i've told you nothing but

548
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,467
the truth no matter how crazy
the truth sounds. i

549
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,369
said this would happen.

550
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,804
you said what would happen?

551
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:27,205
do you really think she'd
be with you if it wasn't

552
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:29,374
for me?

553
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,709
we made this date before
i even met you.

554
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,445
i gave mary to you.
i watched you from afar

555
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:41,686
i admired you. i watched you
grow. mary is a gift.

556
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,521
and i have many more gifts for
you as long as you

557
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,390
give me something in return.

558
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:47,392
you're crazy.

559
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,727
you didn't give me mary.
you haven't

560
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,696
given any of us anything.
it's just some sort of mind

561
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:53,531
control.

562
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,666
you're not so
sure of that, are you john?

563
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,201
now, i'm offering you a chance
to belong and belong

564
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,236
to the winning team, but
you keep on turning me

565
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:02,072
away. i think you're jealous
maybe. can't you see what

566
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,809
i've become to your friends?

567
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,444
what do you want from me?

568
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,812
you haven't been doing
your share,

569
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:09,414
john. you're awfully low on
the old commandment-breaking

570
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:13,050
scale. it's time i gave
you an errand.

571
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,251
what kind of errand?

572
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,654
it's an easy one.

573
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:17,988
i want you to talk to trini
for us. you know,

574
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,025
mary's friend.

575
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:24,194
no way, you do it.

576
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,030
you have a reason to talk to
her, john. you're dating

577
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:29,734
mary, she trusts you. so what
you do is you go over

578
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:31,101
to her dorm room and tell her
you'll do some homework

579
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,004
with her, that's all.

580
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,073
why would i do that? maybe i
should just walk away right

581
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,843
now and see what happens.

582
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:41,211
you know what happens, john.
mary leaves you, your

583
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,681
friends leave you and i leave
you. and that one

584
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,115
fleeting chance that you have
at success, wealth and

585
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,217
power, it's all gone. now think

586
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,355
about that. do you really
want to take that chance?

587
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:54,525
i want you to talk to trini
tonight. you have an hour.

588
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:59,196
choose wisely.

589
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:02,767
and i did. i can't say why i
did it. i think i was making

590
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:06,136
a choice, or i thought i was
making one. i wanted to be

591
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,805
with my friends again, even
though i couldn't quite see

592
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:10,475
their own personalities
anymore. when i looked

593
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:18,476
into their eyes, all
i saw was luc.

594
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,085
so, how are things going with
mary? she can't stop

595
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,187
talking about you.

596
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:25,089
is that good?

597
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:32,830
ask her yourself.

598
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:36,333
what the hell are you
guys doing here?

599
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:37,868
well, we knew that this is
where john was and we

600
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:38,869
couldn't resist the chance
to break into the girls'

601
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,970
dorm room.

602
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,507
everybody, put your clothes
back on, please.

603
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:44,775
you guys wish.

604
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,276
it's got to be a little
hard to be romantic

605
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,245
without the wine, isn't it?

606
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:49,146
is that?

607
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,717
yup, alcohol. boys in
the girls' dorms.

608
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:55,119
is headmistress grimes is
going to be pissed.

609
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,254
i'll pass.

610
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,989
me, too.

611
00:40:58,990 --> 00:40:59,658
no, i say a little sip
of wine isn't going

612
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:01,258
to hurt either of you two.

613
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:05,564
no.

614
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,078
okay, i guess a sip won't hurt.

615
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:30,121
wow, it's not as bad as
i would have thought.

616
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,998
what are they doing?

617
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,199
that's what i want to tell
you. they're getting the place

618
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,035
all comfy for us.

619
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:45,837
i should go.

620
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,641
no, you should watch john.

621
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:53,310
comfy? for me?

622
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:57,447
yes.

623
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:01,151
look guys, my boyfriend alex,
well you know alex.

624
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,789
shh.

625
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:32,336
i could not help myself.

626
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,038
i was part of this.

627
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,306
part of the brotherhood.

628
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:38,442
i was drawn into it.

629
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:40,745
i was under luc's power.

630
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:43,915
i just couldn't stop.

631
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:21,031
did you enjoy
yourselves this evening?

632
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:23,033
i thought we got her
off to a good start.

633
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:26,436
real good.

634
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:30,541
that's just the beginning
for us.

635
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,113
is that a?

636
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:39,383
that's right.
it's a spirit's tooth

637
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:40,985
of the warlock knife mrs.
stevens was

638
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:43,553
going on and on
about the other day.

639
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:47,057
where the hell did you get that?

640
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,692
like you said, it's
a private school.

641
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,627
they don't lock up anything
around here.

642
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,229
they really use that
in witchcraft?

643
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,532
do you think i took it?

644
00:48:55,533 --> 00:49:00,570
i'm a warlock.

645
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:01,838
how do you think
i've done the things

646
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,007
that i've done? or how you've
gotten the powers

647
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:05,109
that you have?

648
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,576
i've given you a glimpse

649
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:08,578
of what i am capable of.

650
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,448
so, you're like dungeons
and dragons,

651
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,850
merlin and the hat,
fireballs and stuff?

652
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:17,021
no, nothing like that.

653
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:18,355
i make offerings to certain
forces and certain forces

654
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:21,158
grant me things in return.

655
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:24,261
you guys are popular now. you
command respect.

656
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:26,830
i've given you everything
you've ever wanted,

657
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:29,266
and that's just a glimpse
of what you could have.

658
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,835
so what are you saying?

659
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:35,072
i need three more to make
the ritual complete.

660
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:36,873
three more warlocks.

661
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:38,042
are you serious, man?

662
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:41,711
totally.

663
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,613
luc, you've made a believer
out of me.

664
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:44,515
is that why we're sitting around

665
00:49:44,516 --> 00:49:46,150
like this?

666
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,751
it's the next part
of the process.

667
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:50,620
i'll give each of you
a spirit's tooth.

668
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,056
when you commit a sacrifice,
you have committed the final

669
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:54,658
act.

670
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,827
you'll have the power
within yourself.

671
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,297
you mean like murder?

672
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:01,798
what do you think happened
to randall?

673
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:04,601
did you?

674
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,903
did you kill him?

675
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:09,306
i didn't hurt a flea
as far as you're concerned.

676
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:11,241
you take your souls back
from your enemies,

677
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:11,776
and you take their souls along

678
00:50:11,777 --> 00:50:14,244
with it.

679
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:17,781
when you do that, you'll be
empowered for life.

680
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:21,051
no one will ever cause you
pain or fear again.

681
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:22,986
you start with breaking the
ten commandments. you have

682
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:25,323
already broken nine.

683
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,258
just one more.

684
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:31,328
thou shall not kill.

685
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:34,331
i don't want to kill
anybody, man.

686
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:36,500
well, randall's dead
and your problems

687
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:40,670
at the school are much more
closer to being solved.

688
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:43,340
you have the power to solve
anything if you really want to.

689
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,575
complete our promise.

690
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,277
this weekend at semestral break,

691
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,945
everybody's going to be gone.

692
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:51,548
it will be perfect.

693
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:52,782
you've laid the groundworks
and now you have to build

694
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,084
on that.

695
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:56,620
like how?

696
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:59,556
you have to make an offering
to the spirit's tooth.

697
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:03,794
kill the one you hate the most.

698
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:40,597
i offer my vengeance.

699
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:44,235
i bind myself to my enemies.

700
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:42,226
i offer my vengeance.

701
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:49,399
i bind myself to my enemies.

702
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,238
this is the way it must be.

703
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:34,278
i offer my vengeance.

704
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:38,683
i bind myself to my enemies.

705
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,075
i offer my vengeance.

706
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:42,746
i bind myself to my enemies.

707
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:44,948
we bind ourselves to him.

708
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:48,084
we pledge to destroy him and
anyone who follows him.

709
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:50,620
we have but one master.

710
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:54,559
the dark one, the fallen
angel, prince of lies.

711
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:57,962
and then we shall be a coven.

712
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,520
hey marcus, guess
who i had a talk

713
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,389
with this morning?

714
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:28,392
trini, and guess what
she told me?

715
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:30,394
she said your loser pal john
van-owen came to her dorm

716
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:31,528
room and got her drunk.

717
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:32,397
and then.

718
00:55:32,398 --> 00:55:34,163
and then what?

719
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,866
you know what marcus.

720
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,168
i thought trini was
a virgin, though.

721
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,304
i know about you guys.

722
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:43,507
and after i beat van-owen to
death, i might go on to

723
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:46,510
headmistress grimes
and the cops,

724
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:48,812
and tell them what i
know about randall.

725
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:50,414
you freaks are all going
to go to jail.

726
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:52,148
oh, i get it.

727
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:57,186
you're all upset because
we touched your girl.

728
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,322
we touched her.

729
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:01,491
licked her.

730
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:04,994
kissed her.

731
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:08,164
i mean, i guess we got her a
little bit more drunk than

732
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:10,467
we thought.

733
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:12,268
bastard.

734
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:15,705
hey, it happens.

735
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:20,043
you're right about
one thing, though.

736
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:23,179
we killed randall.

737
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,348
you know i think his last
words were,

738
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:31,655
help me. i'm drowning.

739
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:32,856
you're crazy.

740
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:34,858
yeah.

741
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:38,663
you better start running.

742
00:57:57,341 --> 00:58:00,778
yeah, win or break.

743
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:18,728
you're making a serious
mistake, pal.

744
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:21,230
shut up, harlan.

745
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,332
what the hell is up
with you guys?

746
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,201
first the new kid shows up,
screws everything up and you

747
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:27,270
guys turn into big
men on campus.

748
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:28,738
what's your deal, john?

749
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:32,909
i said shut up.

750
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:36,913
what are you going to do?

751
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:39,015
you're a loser, john.

752
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:43,820
get the hell out of my way.

753
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:44,755
i don't think harlan knew
just how close he was to

754
00:58:44,756 --> 00:58:48,357
being murdered.

755
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,359
i don't think i knew either.

756
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:56,265
but i was relieved i
didn't have it i me.

757
00:58:56,266 --> 00:59:02,772
[clinking of keys]

758
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,107
[bumping sound]

759
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:07,176
hello?

760
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:10,479
who's there?

761
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,249
i guarantee anyone not in
their room at this hour

762
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,483
will be expelled.

763
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:18,655
i won't tolerate it.

764
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:21,791
huh?

765
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:24,093
what are you doing?

766
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:26,262
i thought i'd come and visit.

767
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:28,632
mr. slaton, do you know
what time it is?

768
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:30,800
does it matter?

769
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:31,435
i've seen the way you look at me

770
00:59:31,436 --> 00:59:33,870
recently.

771
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:36,773
i figured it was just a
matter of time

772
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:42,646
before we had a
conversation alone.

773
00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:44,080
it's late.

774
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,882
you should be in your room.

775
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:52,188
i'd rather be in yours.

776
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:53,690
don't you?

777
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:57,927
i don't,

778
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:03,700
i have no idea what you're
saying.

779
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,501
you've gone mad, haven't you?

780
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:06,703
what do you think you're doing?

781
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:09,072
oh baby,

782
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:12,342
you don't know half of it.

783
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:38,401
hello my friend, you look awful.

784
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:40,436
i have good reason.

785
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:42,271
believe me.

786
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:42,639
i take it, this means
harlan's out

787
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,174
of commission?

788
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:47,110
yeah.

789
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:47,878
but i don't want to talk about

790
01:00:47,879 --> 01:00:49,612
it right now.

791
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:50,613
you did a good thing, john.

792
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:52,148
this world belongs to us.

793
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,417
you made it a better place.

794
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:56,019
i said i don't want
to talk about it.

795
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,353
you got what you wanted.

796
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,055
not yet.

797
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:01,157
i've got bigger plans.

798
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:04,828
a third ritual at the
pool house. we'll be gods.

799
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:05,929
i don't want to be a part
of this anymore.

800
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,431
you don't have a choice.

801
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:10,299
either share my feast
or share my fall.

802
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:10,801
don't you know that i can
take everything i've given

803
01:01:10,802 --> 01:01:12,468
you away?

804
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,838
i don't want to be a part
of this anymore.

805
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:16,973
i'm going home, okay?

806
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:18,507
i'm quitting chandler academy,

807
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,409
the whole nine yards.

808
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,045
just leave me alone.

809
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:23,913
what about your friends?

810
01:01:23,914 --> 01:01:28,018
they're your friends now.

811
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,795
headmistress grimes.

812
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:40,429
headmistress. grimes.

813
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,664
it's john van-owen.

814
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:44,100
i want to talk to you.

815
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:46,602
headmistress. grimes.

816
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:49,238
did you have a sudden urge to
confess something, john?

817
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:49,673
i thought you weren't
going to be a part

818
01:01:49,674 --> 01:01:50,840
of this?

819
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:52,876
stay away from me, luc.

820
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:56,679
you look afraid. maybe i
can help you with that.

821
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,883
luc, we have got to tell them.

822
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,350
dude, i wanted to stop
alice's clock for

823
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:03,219
years.

824
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,653
they made our lives hell, john.

825
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,689
you, too.

826
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,492
so now they're in hell.

827
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,560
guess it all evens up, huh?

828
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,662
i gave them everything
they ever wanted.

829
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,799
i kept my end of the bargain.

830
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,167
and what do you get, luc?

831
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:19,069
they break the ten commandments.

832
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,170
they kill for you.

833
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:23,006
so what exactly do
you get from this?

834
01:02:23,007 --> 01:02:25,141
you killed harlan.

835
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:25,575
you're part of this
whether you want

836
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,443
to be or not.

837
01:02:26,444 --> 01:02:28,544
yeah, johnny.

838
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:30,146
stop being a wimp and get
on with the program.

839
01:02:30,147 --> 01:02:31,848
you're a warlock now, john.

840
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:33,950
you're part of the covenant.

841
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:34,584
do the third ritual with
us and you will get to

842
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:36,519
go free.

843
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,221
and mary will be yours forever.

844
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:40,423
you leave her out of this.

845
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:42,625
you don't have to answer me
right away, johnny boy.

846
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:44,360
you're still doing this
big plan for tonight.

847
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,062
i guarantee it.

848
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:48,265
just ask headmistress grimes.

849
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:53,103
i think it's safe to say
she'll be out

850
01:02:53,104 --> 01:02:54,603
of commission for awhile.

851
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:59,042
see you around.

852
01:02:59,043 --> 01:02:59,844
i had nowhere to go and
no friends left

853
01:02:59,845 --> 01:03:02,611
to help me.

854
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,680
i wanted to talk to mary,
but i knew the instant i

855
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:08,451
showed up on her doorstep,
her life would be in danger.

856
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:12,522
i only had one person
left to talk to.

857
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:21,065
[knocking on door]

858
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:24,568
just a second.

859
01:03:30,074 --> 01:03:35,344
are you okay?

860
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:37,480
well sit down.

861
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,615
look,

862
01:03:39,616 --> 01:03:41,217
i came to see you
because you're the only

863
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:43,486
person on earth right now who
might still listen to me

864
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,088
or believe me.

865
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:47,456
what¢á ís happening, john?

866
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:50,793
marcus and matt, the new kid
put them through some kind

867
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,628
of ritual thing and now they
think they have to kill

868
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:53,963
people.

869
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:56,065
what new kid?

870
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,034
he thinks he's a warlock.

871
01:03:57,035 --> 01:03:59,302
a warlock?

872
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:00,037
i think he's going to do
something terrible tonight.

873
01:04:00,038 --> 01:04:01,670
like what?

874
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,007
i don't know.

875
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,641
well, if you want me to help
you then you and i are going

876
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:06,476
down to the police station,
and we will tell them all

877
01:04:06,477 --> 01:04:07,944
about this.

878
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:08,578
but they're going to think
that i'm a part

879
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:09,579
of this.

880
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,646
not if you're with me.

881
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:13,782
okay. i'll go with you.

882
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:14,783
but let me call mary first
to check and see if she's

883
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:17,220
okay.

884
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:20,523
they might try to do
something to her.

885
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:28,065
[phone ringing]

886
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,534
hello.

887
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,202
mary?

888
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:34,370
hello johnny, what's up?

889
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,039
luc.

890
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,942
that's right pal, it's
your buddy luc.

891
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:39,943
ah gee kiddo, i'm sorry but
you must have just missed

892
01:04:39,944 --> 01:04:41,677
mary.

893
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,579
she doesn't seem to
be here right now.

894
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,015
what did you do to her,
you sick freak?

895
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:48,351
nothing yet. in fact she's going

896
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:50,753
to be accompanying me
to the old pool house.

897
01:04:50,754 --> 01:04:52,588
you remember the poolhouse,
right johnny?

898
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:55,291
she's our guest.
personally i think she's

899
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:56,792
going to have one
hell of a time.

900
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:58,794
what do you want?

901
01:04:58,795 --> 01:05:00,529
you know what i want, john.

902
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,665
i need you to complete
the covenant.

903
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:05,401
i get credit for the souls of
you and your two friends,

904
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,703
plus all the kills, plus all
the goofing around. and i

905
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:09,072
get to be leader of the
covenant, destined

906
01:05:09,073 --> 01:05:11,007
for big things.

907
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:12,608
well, just let her go and i'll,

908
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:16,512
ah, ah johnny, i make the
deals here not you.

909
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:18,281
i need you to come to the
poolhouse. we'll settle all

910
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:21,117
our business there.

911
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:22,218
if you don't do that for
me, then being a murder

912
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:23,252
suspect is going to be the least

913
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,054
of your problems.

914
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:26,490
count on it.

915
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:44,573
what if he doesn't come?

916
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:45,874
have some faith.

917
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:49,445
he'll show.

918
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:50,679
are you sure you want to go
through this because we can

919
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,316
get this whole thing resolved
by the police you know?

920
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:55,051
this is beyond anything the
police can help us with.

921
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:55,719
yeah, but if you go through
with this, you're making the

922
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,520
problem worse.

923
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:58,055
i'm not going to let
anything happen

924
01:05:58,056 --> 01:06:06,056
to mary.

925
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:09,565
looks like quite a little
party going on here.

926
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:10,267
i'm guessing you're not cramming

927
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:13,669
for my history final.

928
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,805
well, well, if it isn't
ms. stevens.

929
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,408
you look confused.

930
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:21,244
did you think john was lying?

931
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:22,511
i thought he was exaggerating

932
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:26,149
about the situation, but
i guess he wasn't.

933
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,451
it's just her.

934
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:31,387
john didn't come with her.

935
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:33,289
john left on his own.

936
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,124
he didn't want to be involved.

937
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:37,060
so he ran off.

938
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:38,694
he's probably on his way to
get the police right now.

939
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:39,962
you lie.

940
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:43,099
what's the matter, luc?

941
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,800
can't you use your powers to
make all the police go away?

942
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:47,270
don't mock me.

943
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:48,971
you're already dead and
everytime you show me

944
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:51,907
disrespect that death is
going to be a little slower

945
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:53,776
and a little more painful.

946
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:55,844
why don't you let
the girl go, luc?

947
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,081
you don't know who you're
dealing with.

948
01:06:58,082 --> 01:07:00,283
right now i'm pretty sure
it's some lost, little boy

949
01:07:00,284 --> 01:07:02,951
who needs a lot of help.
so whatever you want

950
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:06,389
from me, you can have it
after you let mary leave.

951
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:08,591
and what do you know?

952
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:09,226
you deal with these kids
from these upper-crust

953
01:07:09,227 --> 01:07:10,526
families.

954
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,095
nice homes.

955
01:07:12,096 --> 01:07:14,797
kids who have their whole
lives mapped out for them.

956
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:17,500
their parents enroll them
here at chandler academy,

957
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:19,535
so they can have the prestige
of having junior

958
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,870
in a private school in hell.

959
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,971
but they don't know the
difference between jesus

960
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:25,641
christ and ricky martin.

961
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:26,543
you seem so sure about
everybody, don't you

962
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:27,377
luc?

963
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:28,911
i'm not finished.

964
01:07:28,912 --> 01:07:29,912
it's what you get for
not paying attention

965
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:33,116
to my class, luc.

966
01:07:33,117 --> 01:07:35,418
like i said, the witches and
the warlocks believe that

967
01:07:35,419 --> 01:07:40,289
their opposite numbers exist
and wipe them out.

968
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,158
did you ever wonder who your
opposite number was?

969
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:43,492
who? john?

970
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:45,294
no, me.

971
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:47,530
i was sent to stop you.

972
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:50,133
and it seems like a pretty
crummy assignment.

973
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:56,840
i don't care who you are. i'm
running the show here.

974
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:03,713
welcome to hell.

975
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,489
what's the matter, john?

976
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,558
you don't dig the new look?

977
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:18,927
i bet you won't tell
on us now, huh?

978
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,464
either you're with us or
against us, johnny.

979
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:23,832
if you¢á íre against us,

980
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:27,303
we'll be needing your
intestines.

981
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:29,472
get back.

982
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:31,840
crucifix, i'm a warlock.

983
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,009
get your freaking
superstitions right.

984
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,512
leave them alone.

985
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:40,484
i think you messed up, darling.

986
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:47,790
it should keep you
away for a while.

987
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:51,360
stay away from me.

988
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,296
come on, johnny.

989
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:55,097
you can't even
back up your teacher?

990
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:57,666
you're an angel.

991
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,535
you're not my friend anymore.

992
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:01,471
you're not even human.

993
01:09:18,522 --> 01:09:20,489
not so fast, johnny.

994
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:26,662
remember the girl?

995
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,365
now drop the fucking knife.

996
01:09:39,443 --> 01:09:40,244
you shouldn't have run
from your friends,

997
01:09:40,245 --> 01:09:42,010
johnny boy.

998
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,980
but they were just servants
and so are you.

999
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:47,149
i forgot to tell you, when
you kill someone

1000
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,084
with a spirit's tooth, like
when you killed harlan,

1001
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:52,154
your soul belongs to me.

1002
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:54,890
now give it to me one more
time, take it or leave it.

1003
01:09:54,891 --> 01:10:00,529
be my third acolyte.
and i'll let her survive.

1004
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,298
i don't trust you.

1005
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:03,432
you don't have a choice.

1006
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:05,701
i own your soul.

1007
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:13,702
now get down on your knees.

1008
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,712
good boy. now johnny, i
want you to tell me,

1009
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:20,883
there's no one in
your life but me.

1010
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:22,451
there's no one in
my life but you.

1011
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:25,220
i own your soul.

1012
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,790
you own my soul.

1013
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:30,926
now prove it by killing off
your girlfriend mary.

1014
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:33,397
john.

1015
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:46,442
you don't understand, mary,
luc can make me great.

1016
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:49,478
he can make everybody love me.

1017
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:53,516
it's what i've always
wanted, isn't it?

1018
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:55,318
it's good to see you come
around sweetheart.

1019
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:57,052
john, please don't.

1020
01:10:57,053 --> 01:11:00,389
mary, i have to.

1021
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:03,025
see that knife,

1022
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:05,328
i've never killed anyone
with a spirit's tooth.

1023
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:08,465
fuck you.

1024
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,614
it's time to go, luc.

1025
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,516
nice work, johnny.

1026
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:29,117
it's good to know that somebody

1027
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,118
listens in my class.

1028
01:11:54,444 --> 01:12:00,148
she's gone.

1029
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,284
damn it.

1030
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:04,887
why did you have to
hit me so hard?

1031
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:07,122
you guys were asking for it.

1032
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:08,091
i don't know, man, i think
i've got a bump and a dent

1033
01:12:08,092 --> 01:12:09,191
in my skull.

1034
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:11,126
thanks to you.

1035
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,228
thanks for nothing, john.

1036
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:14,163
what do you say we blow this
joint and go and enroll in a

1037
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,998
public school?

1038
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,132
you lead the way.

1039
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:20,469
hey john,

1040
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,804
do you think a couple
friends can join you

1041
01:12:20,805 --> 01:12:23,406
there?

1042
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:28,276
i wouldn't have it
any other way.

1043
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,413
even now when i go to church,

1044
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:31,714
i will light a candle against
the horrible night i

1045
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:34,650
almost lost my friends.
and i want

1046
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:37,786
to believe that it's
over, really over.

1047
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:39,422
but you know the old story
by now. it's never really

1048
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,189
over for him.

1049
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,825
he might be there now.

1050
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:45,060
in your town, in your school.

1051
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,796
the new kid, the guy
with the cards,

1052
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:49,164
looking for souls to corrupt,
for minds to

1053
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:51,434
take over.

1054
01:12:51,435 --> 01:12:54,470
i don't think we can ever
really stop him,

1055
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:57,540
but whatever you do,
watch for him.

1056
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:58,708
i think he'll be there soon.
