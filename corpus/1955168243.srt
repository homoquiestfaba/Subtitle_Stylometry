               ¶

00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:36,995
    Dr. Lane:<i> Hello, Sharon.</i>

3
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,031
           And Nolan.

4
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,435
I am really happy that you could
  meet with me this afternoon.

5
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,973
       I understand that
      you gave your mother

6
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,808
  quite a scare two days ago.

7
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:54,546
        And I was hoping
  that you could share with me

8
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,648
       what you remember
      about that evening.

9
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,555
      Well, I can tell you
       that it was by far

10
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,457
the scariest moment in my life.

11
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:09,394
       Both of our lives
     passed before my eyes.

12
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,498
       My son is the most
       important thing--

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,166
 Sharon, you know, we have had

14
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,001
         an opportunity
       to talk about this

15
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,637
and you told me what you believe
    led up to these events,

16
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,839
       but, Nolan, I want
       to hear from you.

17
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,646
     All right, then let me
  start with an introduction.

18
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,517
 My name is Dr. Cassandra Lane
        and I have been

19
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,987
   a practicing psychiatrist
      for nearly 18 years.

20
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,856
        I have been with
      this hospital for...

21
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:42,127
    about 11 of those years
    specializing in juvenile

22
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,497
      and young adults who
    are considered at risk.

23
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,105
              So.

24
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,574
      Could you tell me a
     little bit about you?

25

   Commentator:<i> The home side</i>

       <i> now the big guy.</i>

27
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,118
   <i> Hitting .342 with 92 RBI</i>

28
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,920

00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,355
        (cheering on TV)

30
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,560
    Okay, honey, your dinner
  is wrapped in the microwave,

31
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,095
   the timer is set, all you
   have to do is press start.

32
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,731
             Nolan.

33
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,200
    Are you listening to me?

34
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,135
   Dinner's in the microwave,
          press start.

35
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,504
     Emergency numbers are
      on the refrigerator,

36
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:26,972
       don't go outside,

37
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,374
 don't answer the phone unless
    I hear the special ring,

38
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,077
       and don't open the
      door for strangers.

39
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,546
    Okay smarty pants.

40
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,582
   I'll call you on my break.
          I love you.

41
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,717
       Love you too, Mom.

42
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,385
          Commentator:
   <i> Three, we're tied at two.</i>

43
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,222
     <i> More baseball after</i>
       <i> these messages.</i>

44
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,764
       Hey, what are you
       doing back there?

45
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,200
    Nothin', just wanted to
  see if I could play with ya.

46
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,168
       Are you any good?

47
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,704
           -I guess.
         -Here, catch!

48
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,876
     Throw it back, doofus.

49
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:44,950
          Boy: My lip!

50
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,451
       You busted my lip!

51
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,487
      I'm gonna kill you.

52
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,022
           Grab him!

53
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,455
        Hey, watch where
     you're going, stupid!

54
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,790
         You shouldn't
      have been in my way,

55
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,258
     you little shit, move!

56
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,160
     What did you call me?

57
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,495
         -You heard me.
          -(laughing)

58
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,830
     -What did you call me?
   -Man: Hey, hey, hey, hey!

59
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,465
   Break it up, break it up!

60
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,666
         He started it!

61
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,934
      Well, I'm ending it.

62
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,769
        All of you guys,
      get outta here, now.

63
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,105
         It's not over,
       you little freak.

64
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,212
           Man: Sam.

65
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,082
           Sam! Son?

66
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,617
        Come back here.

67
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,919
           Hey, hey.

68
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,854
       What do you want?

69
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,190
Thanks for sticking up for me.

70
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,058
    I didn't do it for you.

71
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,760
       Where do you play?

72
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,261
             What?

73
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,198
        Wherever I want.

74
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,067
    No one can tell me where
      to go or what to do.

75
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,803
       I'm going down to
    the batting diamond.

76
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,938
          Can I come?

77
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,639
      It's a free country.

78
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,078
        Sam: All right,
    let's see what you got.

79
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,449
              Wow.

80
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,551
    I'm not that good.

81
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,986
    You can say that again.

82
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,856
         Try it again.

83
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,759
  And this time, concentrate.

84
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,264
       For Christ's sake,
         what was that?

85
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,499
            I quit.

86
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,601
         I should play
     football or something.

87
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,070
 I saw the way you were running

88
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,938
      when those assholes
        were after you.

89
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,807
         Football ain't
       your sport either.

90
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,762
          Now come on,

91
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:54,345
  we're gonna toss this thing
    until you get it right.

92
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,747
       You would do that?

93
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,582
       If you're going to
      hang around with me,

94
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,684
        I can't have you
     throwing like a girl.

95
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,996
           (applause)

96
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,346
     Coach: Come on, Nolan.

97
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,185
           (applause)

98
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,938
  -Coach: Nice, there you go!
          -(applause)

99
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,072
        Coach: Atta boy!

100
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,611
      Mountaineers, baby.
         Good job boys!

101
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,745
           Good job!

102
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,881
       You keep this up,

103
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,983
       and you just might
        hold that trophy

104
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,284
   at the end of the season.

105
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,652
          Team: Yeah!

106
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,621
    With Nolan's arm, coach,
   there's no might about it.

107
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,823
         No, this ain't
        no one-man show.

108
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,359
       We, we are a team.

109
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,927
      -That's right coach.
         -Coach: Yeah.

110
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,662
  And remember, there is no...

111
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,164
      Team: ...I in team.

112
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,533
              Aww.

113
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,835
             -Aww.
          -(laughter)

114
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,170
     Go on, get outta here.

115
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,305
  Get outta here, you deserve
      an extra free night.

116
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,540
     -Nolan: Thanks Coach!
       -Coach: Good job.

117
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,376
    Teacher: Show of hands.

118
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,179
       Who read Act Two,
    scenes one through four?

119
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,882
       All right, so what
       did you conclude?

120
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,917
     One at a time, please.

121
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,887
    What was that, Nolan?
       I didn't hear you.

122
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:42,954
              Sir?

123
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,357
 What do you think Romeo meant

124
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,692
          when he said
    "I have a soul of lead,

125
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,861
    that so sticks me to the
    ground I cannot move."?

126
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,463
  Well, clearly, he's in love.

127
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,431
          How's that?

128
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,101
He says "I have a soul of lead."

129
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,136
    Doesn't sound like love.

130
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,438
    Well, his heart is heavy
     and he doesn't want...

131
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,974
         He can't move.

132
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,144
  See, I think he's paralyzed
      by his overwhelming

133
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,079
   love for this girl and...

134
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,416
  Because of that, he doesn't
    wanna lose sight of her.

135
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,654
            Teacher:
Excellent interpretation, Nolan.

136
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,822
           Very nice.

137
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:19,958
           Very nice.

138
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,161
           Pop quiz.

139
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,801
              Hey.

140
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:31,937
              Hey.

141
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,473
    Um, so, I was wondering.

142
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,709
        Wondering what?

143
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,044
      I was just wondering
         if you'd like

144
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,745
to come to my game on Saturday?

145
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,014
        You play sports?

146
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,115
          (chuckling)

147
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,186
    Hmm, you don't look
    like a football player.

148
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,256
   And judging by your arms,

149
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,925
       you're definitely
        not a wrestler.

150
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:57,996
             Wait.

151
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:58,462
      Are you that pitcher
 everyone's been talking about?

152
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,034
      Aww, that's too bad.

153
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,637
     I was hoping you were
       a football player,

154
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,174
       because baseball's

     <i> I am never gonna let</i>
     <i> him hurt you again.</i>

157
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,856
     Do you hear me, baby?

158
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,793
        He will never,
      ever hurt you again.

159
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,194
 Daniel:<i> Open this door Sharon,</i>

160
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,596
  <i> or I'm gonna break it down.</i>

161
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,298
       <i> -I swear to God!</i>
          -(crashing)

162
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,834
        Sharon:<i> Daniel,</i>
 <i> you're drunk, leave us alone!</i>

163
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,714

00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,352
        Really, really?

167
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,887
        All right, break
      it up, break it up.

168
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,855
         Hey, nice save
       today, Tommy boy.

169
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,157
   -That was good stuff, man.
            -Thanks.

170
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,792
 You actually totally saved us.

171
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,794

    you got that rubber arm,

172
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,729

173
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,198
         Hey, remember,
     there's no I in team.

174
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,701
         -No I in team.
          -(laughing)

175
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,202

00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,738
       Hey, so, we gonna

177
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,941
    Parents are outta town,
      so I got the pickup.

178
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,743
       That's what's up!

179
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,812
       Guys, let me talk
        to my mom first.

180
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,180
     I'll catch up with you
    guys in a minute, okay?

181
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,481
     Yeah, yeah, mama boy.

182
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,718
        Remember tonight
    we're going to a party.

183
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,219
           (laughing)

184
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,654
         I'm after you.

185
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,125
           Hey, Mom?

186
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,563
       Oh, let me guess,

187
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,064
         you wanna hang
       out with the guys?

188
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,033
            You know
     everything, don't you?

189
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,568
   Sometimes I feel like you
    got like psychic powers

190
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,036
or something, it's kinda creepy.

191
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,438
       Yeah, I just know
    what "Hey, Mom?" means.

192
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,907
You sure that you wanna pass up

193
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,243
  on my world-famous meatloaf?

194
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,611
         Mom, it's just
       me and you though.

195
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:28,346
   It's not like there's some
other guy joining us for dinner.

196
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,351
 Look, I'll probably be hungry
    when I get home anyway,

197
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,420
     so just leave a plate
    in the microwave for me?

198
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,922
             -Okay.
        -Love you, Mom.

199
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,990
           Love you.

200
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,626
          Hey, Nolan?

201
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,330
        Oh, thanks Mom.

202
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:46,831
        You're welcome.

203
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,282
       Dude, I don't know
     about this, all right?

204
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,451
 Oh, my gosh, Thomas, shut up!

205
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,620
    If I want your opinion,
     I will give it to you.

206
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,421
       We don't even know
        who this guy is.

207
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,924
      I told you already,
     we did time together.

208
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,160
  In the third family, before
   the wanker family got me.

209
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,195
      He looks out for me.

210
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,899
       Relax man, I know
        what I'm doing.

211
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,133
            (laughs)

212
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,103
   -Hey, dude, put that down.
    -Just relax, it's fine.

213
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,437
       -Sam, put it down.
           -Shut up!

214
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,906
 Hey, put that shit down, man!

215
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,142
            Spence:
 Man, y'all boys in luck, man.

216
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,410

    Got a bottle of 'Contin.

223

      Everybody smoke bud.

233
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,390
      Shit, even my lawyer
        burned it down.

234
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,692
       I'm talking about
        the type of shit

235
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,227

236
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,530
        Well, we haven't
      tried any of those.

           -Man it...

00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,275
              -Oh.
          -Tommy: Oh.

00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,525
       -I don't have any.
       -Are you serious?

00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,924
      Burn the tip first.

263
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,091
           By itself?

264
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,760
  Spence: Burn the tip first.

265
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,161

00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,962
     -Don't worry about it.
     -Change your tampons.

        Sam: Hey, Nolan.

286
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,420
   You're such a lightweight.

287
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,255
      Passed out already.

288
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,825
    Nolan: All right, later.

00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,597

00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,368
           Hey, hey.

292
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,605

00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,061
  -Hey, have I ever told you?
             -What?

300
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,498

          You got it?

305
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:26,978
            (sighs)

306
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,118
         (pan sizzling)

307
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,169
        You should eat.

308
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,583
           (sighing)

309
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,687
        I want a shower.

310
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,338
    Tommy: I feel like shit.

311
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,107
   Yeah, I pitched like shit.

312
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,641
  Sam: You can say that again.

313
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,280
         Last night was
      pretty crazy, guys.

314
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,216
     But it was fun, right?

315
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,717
            (laughs)

316
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,285
      If I could get this
    pounding out of my head.

317
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,553
 I think they make some kind of

318
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,888
       a hemorrhoid cream
     for that, don't they?

319
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,491
          -I'm sorry?
      -Sam: You heard me.

320
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,626
          (Sam laughs)
            (groans)

321
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,762
  -Tommy: That's what you get.
         -Sam: Thomas.

322
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,065
  I think those were the first
 balls you hit all day, homie.

323
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,333
    Thomas: Really? Really?

324
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,068
           Hey, Sam,
     you know what I heard?

325
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,102
           Sam: What?

326
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,737
 Your mom hits a lot of balls.

327
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,105
   Really, who told you that?

328
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,640
       I didn't hear it,
      I found out myself.

329
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,509
      Really, really, huh?

330
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,755
          -Dehra: Hey.
             -Hey.

331
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,024
     Two creams, one sugar?

332
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,193
      Oh, God, thank you.

333
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,428
        You're welcome.
       How's Mrs. Kanda?

334
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:25,897
        In and out.

335
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,768
   You know they're offering
  overtime for the next shift.

336
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,138
     I have not had a good
   night's sleep in a month.

337
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,806
       Same here, but...

338
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,542
   With three boys and Jeff,

339
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,443
        I need all those
        hours I can get.

340
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,679
       Hey, how's Nolan?

341
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,948
        Sorry I couldn't
      make it to the game.

342
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,249
      Jordan got a fever.

343
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,785
         I heard Nolan
     really put a spankin'

344
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,187
  on them Clayton County boys.

345
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,922
           (laughing)

346
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,492
        He was terrific.

347
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,093
        I was so proud.

348
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,730
    Till he came home in the
  middle of the night, drunk.

349
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,700
       Oh. Is that what I
    have to look forward to?

350
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,902
       That is the least
        of your worries.

351
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,070
            Thanks.

352
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,239
        Hey, when you're
        done with that,

353
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,541
 can I have the overtime sheet?

354
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,811
        Done. All yours.

355
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,146
            Awesome.

356
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,251
            -Mm-hmm.
          -Three days?

357
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,919
Dehra: Honey, I got three boys.

358
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,788
           -I don't.
      -Dehra: Hungry boys.

359
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,557
           (cheering)

360
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,228
        Let's go, Nolan!

361
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,730
        Come on, Nolan!

362
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:36,434
          -(cheering)
   -Coach: Hey, there ya go!

363
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,471
             Yeah.

364
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,740
   Come on baby, push, push!

365
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,577
       Push Nolan, push!

366
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,248
          Yeah, safe!

367
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,682
      There ya go, Nolan!

368
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,484
           (cheering)

369
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,052
       There ya go, baby!

370
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,854
           (laughing)

371
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,458
   Way to go guys, way to go.

372
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,493
Way to go, way to go, way to go.

373
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,263
        All right.
           All right.

374
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,565
  Hey, nice meeting you guys.

375
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,633
   See you in a second, yeah.

376
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,641
              Hey.

377
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,342
          So you uh...

378
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,878
Still think baseball is boring?

379
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,546
        Did I say that?

380
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,151
        You need to put
       ice on this later.

381
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,419
           Yeah. Oh.

382
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,321
      Mom, this is Rachel.

383
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,290
    My second biggest fan.

384
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,225
          -Hi, Miss...
       -Sharon: Adamson.

385
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,627
      It is a pleasure to
       meet you, Rachel.

386
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,896
And I'm assuming that you're not

387
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,465
      gonna be celebrating
     like last week, right?

388
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,901
 Well, actually, I was thinking
   of going to catch a movie.

389
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,203
     If only I knew someone
        to accompany me.

390
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,007
  Is that how guys ask today?

391
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,008
           (giggles)

392
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,244
My gosh, the ego on this child.

393
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:54,812
 I raised you better than that.

394
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,580
             -Mom.
        -Don't "Mom" me.

395
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,083
           (sighing)

396
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,622
  Rachel, would you like to go
  see a movie with me tonight?

397
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,324
        I would love to.

398
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,559
          Much better.

399
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,128
 It was a pleasure to meet you.

400
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,830
     Nice to meet you too,
         Mrs. Adamson.

401
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:17,001
 I don't care how big you get,
you'll always be my little boy.

402
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,070
      I'll be at the car.

403
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:23,874
 She's always embarrassing me.

404
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,676
     Doesn't every mother?

405
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,245
    She means well, I guess.

406
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,780
        Gotta love her.

407
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,116
             So...

408
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,684
   Pick you up around seven?

409
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,726
         Don't wash it.

410
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,165
         Don't wash it.

411
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,867
           Nolan, oh!

412
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,370
Nolan's got a girlfriend.

413
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,938
   Nolan's got a girlfriend.

414
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,773
        Man, shut up.

415
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,641
           (laughing)

416
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,276
   Did she really just write
    her number on your hand?

417
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,112
             -Yeah.
         -Oh, my word.

418
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,148
        Hey, so are you
     still on for tonight?

419
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:05,783
              No.

420
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,218
      Dude, I have plans.

421
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:09,920
     We were gonna go out.

422
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,757
      Sam. It's one night.

423
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,493
        And I'll let you
       know how it goes.

424
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,837
  Mom, I need my jeans ironed!

425
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,073
  And my blue shirt, you know,
the one with the button missing.

426
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,677
           (spitting)

427
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:36,981
          (yells) Mom!

428
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,484
     Thank you, I love you.

429
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,426
  Hey, Thomas, what's up man?

430
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:50,294
<i>What's going on over there?</i>

431
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,929
        It's my sister's
        birthday party.

432
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,364
      She just turned 10.

433
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:54,965
      (indistinct chatter)

434
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,867
     Hey, what time is this
      princess party over?

435
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,637
 Not for another couple hours.

436
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,205
      What the hell, man?

437
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,540
        Can't you leave
      early or something?

438
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:03,874
            <i> Nah.</i>

439
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,143
 Plus my dad caught me sneaking
    into the liquor cabinet,

440
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,978
        so grounded from
        using the truck.

441
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,015
 Thomas, you are such a douche.

442
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,818
       What the hell am I
      supposed to do now?

443
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,320
       You can go play in
    traffic for all I care.

444
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:17,988
          I gotta go.

445
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,943
          -Hey, Pops?
           -Dad: No.

446
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,177
         You don't know
      what I'm gonna ask.

447
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,579
          Oh, I know.

448
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,181
   Look, I just wanna borrow
the car for a couple of hours

449
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,583
      to go meet the boys
     for burgers at Dick's.

450
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,751
          Not tonight,
      Annalise is cooking,

451
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,186
 I don't wanna hear her mouth.

452
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,989
      Woah! What the hell?

453
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,658
    Hold on to the freaking
        ball, you idiot!

454
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,227
   (sports commentary on TV)

455
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,662
  Hey, why don't you sit down
here and watch the game with me?

456
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:00,898
     I mean, you're always
    holing up in that room.

457
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,167
          Commentator:
     <i> Fumbled! Recovered!</i>

458
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,235
         Like you care.

459
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,270
        What'd you say?

460
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,872
    -Commentator:<i> Touchdown!</i>
             -Yes!

461
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,174
      Yes, yes, yes, yes!

462
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,444
 Yes! That's the way to do it!

463
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:17,781
          Hello, Sir.

464
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,552
       You must be Dylan.

465
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,388
       No sir, I'm Nolan.

466
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,223
             Nolan?

467
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,127
            (laughs)
   I'm just kidding ya, kid.

468
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,329
     Rachel: That's enough.

469
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,198
      Hey, all right, all
      right, put it there.

470
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:35,799
            Mm-hmm.

471
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:36,967
          -You ready?
             -Yeah.

472
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,235
 It was great meeting you, sir.

473
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,070
     Pleasure was all mine.

474
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,207
  I hear you the strongest arm
        in the country?

475
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,209
     Bet you the recruiters
       are all after ya.

476
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,544
        Yes sir, I guess
      you could say that.

477
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,778
             Yeah?

478
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,048
    Did my daughter tell you
   I am the Athletic Director
          over at GTI?

479
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,883
     -No, sir, she didn't.
          -She didn't?

480
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,385
             Daddy.

481
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,253
      Can I at least know
      if I like him before

482
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,455
      you start recruiting
     him for your program?

483
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,226
           (chuckles)
 Y'all kids have a good night.

484
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,561
        -Thank you, Sir.
            -Mm-hmm.

485
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,662
           After you.

486
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,096
Have a good night, see you soon.

487
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,317
        Man 1: (on film)
   <i> Stay right where ya are.</i>

488
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,454
         <i> Don't move.</i>

489
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,856
   <i> Stay there now, steady.</i>

490
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,326
            <i> Now...</i>

491
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,311
       (tires screeching)

492
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,880
            -(crash)
        -Sam: Oh, shit.

493
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,583
   Pick up, pick up, pick up.

494
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,420
            Come on!

495
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,591
 Come on Nolan, come on, Nolan.

496
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:43,027
      (cell phone buzzing)

497
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,835
        Man 2: (on film)
    <i> Boss! Oh, Boss! Fuck!</i>

498
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,970
        Man 1: (on film)
<i>Take it easy, what's the matter?</i>

499
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,371
      (cell phone buzzing)

500
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,574
            (sighs)

501
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,245
            Come on.

502
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,580
      (cell phone buzzing)

503
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,617
 Hey, I'll be right back, okay?

504
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,085
        Man 1: (on film)
   <i> I can't understand why you</i>

505
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,788
   <i> have this terrible fear of</i>
  <i> animals in you. What is it?</i>

506
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,689
        Man 2: (on film)
   <i> When I was a little baby,</i>

507
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,890
 <i> I was scared by my piggy bank.</i>

508
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,094
        What is it, Sam?

509
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,530
        Bro, hey, Nolan,
    I'm on Pike Street, man.

510
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,765
  I just wrecked my dad's car.

511
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,434
        Goddamn it, Sam.

512
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,369
 I don't know what to do, man.

513
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,804
   I need you here right now.

514
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,308
     Sam:<i> Just hurry, okay?</i>

515
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:33,577
All right, I'll be right there.

516
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:39,083
            (sighs)

517
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,999
    What are you doing, Sam?

518
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,503
      What if someone sees
        you, what the...

519
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,939
      I'm already screwed,
      what does it matter?

520
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,241
 Sam, come on, get off the car.

521
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,411
  Come on, let's go, get off.

522
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,482
   And cut this shit out too.

523
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,186
       Go get in my car.

524
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,423
              Sam.

525
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,425
        We're just gonna
        leave this here?

526
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:23,594
 Yes, we're just gonna leave it
    here for an hour or so.

527
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,663
 We could say someone stole it.

528
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:28,966
           Stole it?

529
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,667
  What are you talking about?

530
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,271
 What the fuck are you saying?

531
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,507
Stole it? It's right here.

532
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,944
 We're not gonna say shit, Sam.

533
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,579
        What we're gonna
       do is we're gonna

534
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,214
   get in my car, we're gonna
    drive back to my house,

535
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,517
     drop it off, run back
       here, and then...

536
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,388
       Call the cops and
        say that someone

537
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,756
         ran us off the
       road or something.

538
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:53,957
      I've been drinking.

539
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,093
      Okay? They're gonna
        send me to juvi.

540
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,328
   Damn it, are you serious?

541
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,537
       Oh, my God. Shit.

542
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,511
        All right, look.
          God damn it.

543
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:17,881
           Chew this.

544
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,750
    I'll say I was driving.

545
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:23,987
     You'd do that for me?

546
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:26,390
         Yeah, I would.

547
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,360
    No more screw-ups, Sam.

548
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,662
 I swear bro, you have my word.

549
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,363
     Look at me. I mean it.

550
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,501
           All right.

551
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,735
        Get your fuckin'
    hands off me. Let's go.

552
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:06,997
  Police Officer: So you mean
     to tell me you didn't

553
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,065
     get a good description
        of the vehicle?

554
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:09,466
      No, it was too dark.

555
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,702
 I think it was a pickup truck.

556
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,403
 The lights were really bright

557
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:14,938
         and they were
   shining down on us, so...

558
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,608
        What about you?

559
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,743
        He was driving,
    I was just riding along.

560
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,747
              Hmm.

561
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,149
       We'll see what we
      gotta do about this.

562
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,285
         What the hell
    were you thinking?

563
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,821
  I should beat the shit outta
   you for stealing the car!

564
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:32,256
        Do you know what
       could've happened?

565
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:33,790
       Ma'am, I need you
      to calm down, okay?

566
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,493
 Look, I know you're upset and
 I understand why you're upset.

567
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,328
        I swear to God,
   if this was your fault...

568
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,930
       Annalisa, shut up.

569
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,399
      Annalisa: What? I've
     had it with this kid!

570
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,202
 He-- we are calling the state
  first thing in the morning!

571
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:47,204
   I've gotta cook and clean,
   take care of a foster kid,

572
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,506
   and keep this house going.
      I need that to work!

573
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,775
       Sam's dad: Listen,
      wash dishes by hand,

574
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,744
    you know that's the way
     people used to do it.

575
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,112
      Annalisa: Well, gee,
    I would take some money

576
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:56,680
       and hire to get it
      fixed but you bought

577
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:57,781
      -the kid a new mitt!
     -Dad: I've had enough.

578
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,116
I've had enough, I'm outta here!

579
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,284
        Annalisa: Don't
     you walk away from me.

580
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,451
      Sam's dad: Goodbye!

581
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:02,619
        Annalisa: Don't
     you walk away from me!

582
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,589
    And what are you lookin'
      at, you little shit?

583
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,491
           Sam's dad:
    Get back in the car now.

584
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:15,866
       So you're not the
   parents of this young man?

585
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,201
   We're his foster parents.

586
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,837
       Boys will be boys.
             Right?

587
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,774
        I mean, he's not
       a bad kid, really.

588
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,611
    He did say his friend
    was driving the vehicle,

589
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,979
        and someone ran
       them off the road.

590
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,015
   It actually happened to me
  when I was around their age.

591
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,052
      Towing company will
        be here shortly.

592
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:36,253
Stay out of trouble, all right?

593
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:37,321
      Have a good evening.

594
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,457
       Is everybody okay?

595
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,664
 I don't understand, I thought
 you were going to the movies.

596
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,470
   Bill, I am-- I'm so sorry,

597
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,938
       just give me your
     insurance information

598
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,807
      and I promise I will
    take care of everything.

599
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:00,143
    There's nothing here the
insurance company can't handle.

600
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,079
           Thank you.

601
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,048
            Come on.

602
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:16,693
             Pops.

603
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,064
       I'm really sorry.

604
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:53,296
              -Hi.
             -Hey.

605
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:55,832
           What's up?

606
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:56,933
     Just waiting for you.

607
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,970
      -Yeah, by my locker.
             -Yeah.

608
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,738
         -Is that okay?
             -Yeah.

609
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,306
        I like that.

610
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,574
         You want me to
        take your stuff?

611
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:05,809
         Rachel: Sure.

612
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,544
       How was your day?

613
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:12,215
          Well, long.

614
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,418
  Yeah, I feel that, for sure.

615
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,485
             Yeah.

616
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:17,454
  Yeah. It's nice to see you.

617
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:18,955
            You too.

618
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,458
     Hey, how are you doing
    in Mr. Lodholtz's class?

619
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,493
         I don't know.

620
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,529
        I just need a C.

621
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:26,830
             -A C?
             -Yeah.

622
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,433
           It's hard.

623
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,535
 Yeah, I know. I'm telling you.

624
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:32,769
 I'm not doing too good either.

625
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:35,572
             What?

626
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,407
         Yeah, all this
    simile, metaphor stuff,

627
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,077
the classic versus contemporary,
     it's kicking my butt.

628
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,445
            -Really?
            -Mm-hmm.

629
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:44,214
      That's weird because
        I could've sworn

630
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,550
     that I saw your grade
      on last week's exam

631
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:47,951
       and you got an A.

632
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:51,588
              Yes.

633
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:53,156
        Yes, I did.

634
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,026
  It's hard though, I mean...

635
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,098
           -Shut up.
          -(laughing)

636
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,235
       -You wanna study?
             -Yeah.

637
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,003
             -Yeah.
             -I do.

638
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:08,972
        You busy today?

639
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,607
              No.

640
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,568
   Coach:<i> What I just saw out</i>
     <i> there on that field</i>

641
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,070
        was despicable!

642
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,506
    That's not what we are!

643
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,310
 We don't play ball like that!

644
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,579
You wanna be hoodlums and thugs,

645
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,014
   take it out on the street!

646
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,182
       Because you're not
       gonna do it here!

647
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,685
    I will bench your asses!

648
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,188
    One-by-one if I have to.

649
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,424
         He started it.

650
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,926
       You got something
      you wanna say, Sam?

651
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,531
    Then get outta my sight.

652
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,900
You're sacked for two games.

653
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,135
   Nolan and Sam: But coach.

654
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,436
       Nolan, you're this
     close to joining him.

655
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,209
   You know, and as for you,
     the ump shared with me

656
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:00,610
what was going on at the plate.

657
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,212
            Mm-hmm.

658
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:03,647
    If I hear anything about
     that happening again,

659
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:04,714
     you are off the team.

660
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,783
    Do I make myself clear?

661
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,152
           Yes, sir.

662
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:17,193
      So the rest of you,
    6:00 am, you got poles.

663
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,143
             Nolan.

664
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:38,715
            I know.

665
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,317
            I know.

666
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,854
            (sighs)

667
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,756
          Nah. I don't
       think you do know.

668
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,699
       Are you willing to
      sacrifice everything

669
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,767
   you've accomplished out of
   the loyalty for a friend?

670
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,071
Coach, he's not just my friend,
        he's my brother.

671
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,508
He's what's gotten me this far.

672
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:09,879
I can't just turn my back on him

673
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,514
      because he fouls up
      every now and then.

674
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,615
              Son.

675
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,586
   You have a God-given gift.

676
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,188
   It was gonna reveal itself

677
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,856
 whether Sam had any influence
            or not.

678
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,659
       You came into this
       world by yourself,

679
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,894
      more than likely you
    will leave by yourself.

680
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,696
     Nowhere is it written
     that you owe it to Sam

681
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,065
  to sacrifice your hard work,
          your talent,

682
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,767
  your opportunities for him.

683
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,803
     Coach, you don't know
    how hard Sam has had it.

684
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,905
         Is having it.

685
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:40,977
       I understand him.

686
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,381
      Let me talk to him,
       he listens to me.

687
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:47,650
         Yeah, well...

688
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,320
 Son one day you're gonna learn
 that you can't save everybody.

689
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:53,456
  -Especially from themselves.
            -Coach.

690
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,126
           I'm sorry,
    but you've got it wrong.

691
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,795
       Sam is a good guy,

692
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,097
      he needs somebody to
       keep him on track.

693
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,404
And if you can't do it, then...

694
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,553
             -Hey.
   -Hey, what did Coach say?

695
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,621
            Nothin.

696
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,722
          Come on man,
      don't be like that.

697
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:26,756
    Not now Sam, all right?

698
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:28,625
        Well, screw you.

699
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:30,860
           Screw me?

700
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,362
            Really?

701
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,031
       We agreed no more
        shit, remember?

702
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,802
      God, how many times
    do I have to put my ass

703
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:40,136
 out on the line for you, Sam?

704
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,606
   You can't even go one day
 without some sort of screw-up.

705
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:45,809
      I need a break, man.

706
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,377
 What's that supposed to mean?

707
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,215
  Just for a while, I need to
 put a little space between us.

708
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,484
             Yeah?

709
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:56,019
    If I'd have left you out
    there throwing baseballs

710
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:57,821
       breaking windows,
        you wouldn't be

711
00:40:57,823 --> 00:40:58,721
half the athlete you are today.

712
00:40:58,723 --> 00:40:59,722
 Just for a little while, Sam.

713
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:01,791
      I just need a little
   space to myself, damn it.

714
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,128
         Oh. I get it.

715
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,729
    Now that you've got that
   new slut of a girlfriend,

716
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,064
   you don't need me anymore,
          is that it?

717
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:10,467
         What the fuck
       did you say to me?

718
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,601
         You heard me.

719
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,002
 What the fuck is your problem?

720
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,009
             Do it.

721
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,181
             Fuck.

722
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,167
   I am not sure about this.

723
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,237
      Geez Thomas, you are
      such a little bitch.

724
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:49,339
     Look, I'm getting it.

725
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,640
   If you wanna party, do it.

726
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:51,841
    If you don't, fuck off.

727
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,777
          (door slams)

728
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,681
       -Sam: Hey, Thomas.
             -What?

729
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,116
            Nothin'.

730
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,126
           (knocking)

731
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:19,569
      "My only love sprung
       from my only hate.

732
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,871
    Too early seen unknown.

733
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,140
      And known too late."

734
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:29,812
         What's wrong?

735
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:33,883
       Nothing, I'm just
    thinking about the game,

736
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,218
            and Sam.

737
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,487
     It's going to be okay.

738
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,123
      It's not like it was
      a real loss, right?

739
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:42,292
             Right.

740
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,761
 Y'all will get 'em next time.

741
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,897
           (laughing)

742
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,027
       Look what I found.

743
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,543
        Spence: You are
     a dead son of a bitch!

744
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:35,612
             Fuck!

745
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,046
     Get that away from me.

746
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:40,917
           You know.

747
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:42,185
       That's the problem
        with you Thomas.

748
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:44,621
     You're a little pussy,
 you're scared to take chances,

749
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:45,555
         you're scared
     to live a little bit.

750
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,292
      That's why you don't
       have any friends.

751
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:52,695
  That's why you'll always be

752
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,698
        a fucking loser.

753
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:05,675
       What are we doing?

754
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,010
            Get out.

755
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,345
 Just chill out, I was kidding.

756
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,447
   Get outta the truck, Sam!

757
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:15,752
            Get out!

758
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,225
        You wanna fight?

759
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:26,329
     You think you can just
     bully me all my life?

760
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
  I am not your fucking bitch!

761
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:33,936
              God!

762
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,026
        (dialing phone)

763
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,795
         (ringing tone)

764
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,933
      (telephone ringing)

765
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,202
             Hello?

766
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,303
  Nolan:<i> Hey, what's up, man?</i>

767
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:10,090
    <i> Anything jumping off?</i>
    <i> What you getting into?</i>

768
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:10,540
        What are you so
        amped up about?

769
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,308
            Nothing.

770
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:13,876
Do I sound amped? That's weird.

771
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,081
        Hey, have you--
    have you talked to Sam?

772
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,952
             Yeah.

773
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:24,821
    <i> I saw him earlier.</i>

774
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:28,991
        But I dumped him
       about an hour ago.

775
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:30,960
       What do you mean?

776
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:32,495
    Tommy:<i> Look man, I can't</i>
    <i> get into it right now.</i>

777
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,097
       Ears in the room.

778
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,666
    Parents have this
     church thing to go to,

779
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:37,934
   <i> so I'm watching the brat.</i>

780
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,236
     Look, man, I gotta go,
           all right?

781
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,305
    I'll talk to you later.

782
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:43,473
             (beep)

783
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,412
 ¶ (muffled rock music plays) ¶

784
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,519
 Turn down that fucking music!

785
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,021
          -(knocking)
             -Shit.

786
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:08,831
   Great, you're who wrecked
        our fucking car!

787
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,001
   He's in his room, playing
     that damn video game.

788
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,042
    Ah, you got the game on.

789
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:21,077
           Who's up?

790
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,211
           -Dodgers.
             -Yeah?

791
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:24,280
         Cardinals are
       playing like shit.

792
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:26,716
        How's your mom?

793
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:27,817
          She's good.

794
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,354
  -Just working a ton though.
             -Yeah.

795
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:35,458
 I see she's letting you drive
   again after the accident.

796
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:40,163
    You know you didn't have
   to do that for him, Nolan.

797
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:00,016
     You know, I think he's
    up there waiting for ya,

798
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:02,418
 why don't you go check on him?

799
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,421
            (sighs)

800
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:07,824
            Thanks.

801
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:19,602
        Oh, my God, Sam.

802
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,370
     Today was incredible.

803
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,106
  Shakespeare himself couldn't
    have written it better.

804
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,944
     There's something just
     so amazing about her,

805
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:29,879
           the way--
     the way she smells...

806
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:31,914
         And her eyes!

807
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,617
She's just so badass, man!

808
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,420
              Sam.

809
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:39,555
 Are you even listening to me?

810
00:47:41,793 --> 00:47:43,192
         Okay, come on.

811
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,361
           (sighing)

812
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,197
      Look, I know we both
     said some things today

813
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,633
      that we didn't mean.

814
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:55,037
         And the way I
      reacted was stupid.

815
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:57,573
      But you know, Coach,

816
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,609
   he was on my ass and I...

817
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,212
      Sam? Man, I'm sorry.

818
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:04,881
              Sam.

819
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:08,651
              Sam?

820
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:10,753
          Oh, my God.

821
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:12,221
        Oh, my God, Sam?

822
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,389
              Sam.

823
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:15,224
      Sam, buddy, come on.

824
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,592
      Stop fooling around
         man, come on.

825
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:20,229
             -Sam?
       -(heart pounding)

826
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,264
              Sam?

827
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:22,698
        Bill come here!

828
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,966
              Sam!

829
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,836
    Dr. Lane:<i> Nolan. Nolan.</i>

830
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:32,174
 So what I'm trying to identify

831
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:35,912
      is if you think that
       this use of drugs,

832
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:37,480
        this addiction,

833
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,784
      is a result of your
      best friend's death?

834
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:44,520
     Or would you say that
    you could trace it back

835
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:46,422
 to other events in your past?

836
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:57,099
      What do you plan on
    doing with that, Sharon?

837
00:48:57,902 --> 00:48:59,702
         Leave, Daniel.

838
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:03,806
        I am just asking
      you to please leave.

839
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,675
    I don't wanna hurt you.

840
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,844
 What are you gonna do, Sharon?

841
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:13,015
     What are you gonna do?

842
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,651
       What are you gonna
      do with it, Sharon?

843
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:16,953
        Daniel, please!

844
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,621
           (sobbing)

845
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,326
             Fine.

846
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:24,994
    That's all right.

847
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,517
          Hey, Sharon.

848
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,154
  You wanna see my curve ball?

849
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,398
       (glass shattering)

850
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,616
         I am so sorry.

851
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:56,619
I know you were his best friend.

852
00:50:57,822 --> 00:50:59,088
      But you gotta know,

853
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,224
   nothing you could've done

854
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,959
would've prevented this, Nolan.

855
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,327
         (Dad snivels)

856
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,897
   It was outta your control.

857
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:10,566
      No, I turned my back
       on my best friend.

858
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:12,935
       That's the kind of
      friend I was to him,

859
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,270
he needed me and I wasn't there.

860
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:17,406
         Nolan you need
      to hear me on this,

861
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,676
     Sam made his decision.

862
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:24,246
  If anybody failed in seeing
    what was going on here,

863
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,348
 and doing something about it,

864
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:27,983
           it was me.

865
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,920
       I was charged with
        protecting him.

866
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,855
         And I didn't.

867
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:40,796
     I'm sorry, I gotta go.

868
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:41,997
            Thomas.

869
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:44,633
 -Let's go, take me over there.
             -What?

870
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,770
     He's the reason Sam is
      dead, you know that.

871
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,940
       Nolan, Sam is the
    reason that Sam is dead.

872
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:53,275
   Besides, I don't wanna be
    around that guy anymore.

873
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,277
       He literally makes
         my skin crawl.

874
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,712
             -Fine.
            -Nolan!

875
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,281
         Come on, man.

876
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:02,718
That guy is a maggot, you don't
   know what he's capable of.

877
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:06,355
             Nolan.

878
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,224
             Nolan.

879
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,595
            -Nolan.
       -Rachel, not now.

880
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:14,330
            -Nolan!
   -Rachel, I don't... What?

881
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:19,435
  I've been trying to call you
  for the past couple of days

882
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:23,339
  and I just... I'm not trying
    to nag you or anything,

883
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,007
      but I just want you
        to know that you

884
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,409
don't have to be alone in this.

885
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:29,645
     I know, Rachel, look,
     I just need some time
        to myself, okay?

886
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:30,646
           To think.

887
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,648
   Well, I can come with you.

888
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,583
 -Or you can come to my house.
            -Rachel.

889
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:36,252
        It's whatever--
      I don't really care.

890
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:37,353
            Rachel!

891
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:41,490
    Look, I can't right now.

892
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:43,659
       I gotta take care
      of some stuff, okay?

893
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,762
      I'll call you later.

894
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,024
      How was the funeral?

895
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:20,629
      You know, I know...

896
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,267
 That it seems like everything
  is spinning out of control,

897
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,572
    but you gotta know that
    God has a greater plan.

898
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:32,474
     What kind of God plans
    the death of a teenager?

899
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,880
       We were all given
     the gift of free will.

900
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:41,417
God did not choose that for Sam.

901
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,254
        Mom, Sam didn't
     choose to die either.

902
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:49,525
     He was just trying to
    make himself feel better

903
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:51,126
   after I let him down, Mom.

904
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,329
 Okay, this was not your fault.

905
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,699
        And I won't let
       you blame yourself

906
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:58,934
     for something that you
    had nothing to do with.

907
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,736
     Mom, it had everything
         to do with me.

908
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,274
    If I hadn't told Sam...

909
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,278
             What?

910
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,182
        I need the car.

911
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:19,755
   Why, where are you going?

912
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:24,426
    Mom, I just need to take
    a drive. I need the car.

913
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:27,830
          I cannot let
      what happened to Sam

914
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:29,632
         happen to you.

915
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,272
  Rachel wanted me to come by.
     I'm gonna go see her.

916
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,779
      I know you're having
  a hard time accepting this.

917
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,318
 But you're gonna have to learn
   to accept that he's gone.

918
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:53,856
    And there is nothing you
   can do to bring him back.

919
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,168
          I love you.

920
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,707
And if anything happened to you,

921
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,243
     I would lose my mind.

922
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:18,480
Do you want me to lose my mind?

923
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:20,049
              No.

924
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,274
         What the fuck?

925
00:55:45,276 --> 00:55:46,975
Boy, what the fuck is you doin'?

926
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:48,043
    You fucking killed Sam.

927
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,178
   Get the fuck away from me!

928
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,312
         What the fuck
     is you talkin' about?

929
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:51,280
    Get outta my crib, man.

930
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,683
           (grunting)

931
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,952
       Oh shit, oh shit,
       come on man, stop!

932
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:58,187
         (Spence yells)

933
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,521
         Come on, man!

934
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,923
    -This is all your fault!
          -What, man?

935
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:02,691
  Sam jacked me for my stash,
    I didn't give it to him.

936
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,693
   Besides, I thought he was
   trying to make some bread.

937
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:07,529
   I didn't know he was gonna
   go all Heath Ledger on me.

938
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,131
  Liar, you're a goddamn liar!

939
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,966
     You're a fucking liar.
    Don't fucking lie to me!

940
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,938
           (groaning)

941
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:19,241
           Fuck that!

942
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:20,476
     That's what you want?

943
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,649
    Boy, you don't know who
 the fuck you're dealing with.

944
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:30,519
   I would've never hurt Sam.
  He's like my little brother.

945
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:32,721
   And I was looking out for
 him before you even knew him!

946
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,957
   Back when he was too small
    to look out for himself!

947
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,993
I knew Sam better than anybody.
       He was my brother!

948
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,028
    You don't know what the
   fuck you're talking about.

949
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,697
     -I should be with him!
             -What?

950
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:42,731
            Come on!

951
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,066
       He needs me there!

952
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,801
      The fuck? You crazy!

953
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:48,937
             Fuck!

954
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:53,242
          Get up, kid.

955
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:55,477
         Come on, man.

956
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,746
        Don't be laying
      out here all night.

957
00:56:58,682 --> 00:56:59,982
         What the fuck.

958
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:01,984
           Look, man.

959
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,386
You need to get your ass up.

960
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:05,921
  Either get back in that car,

961
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,356
       and drive the hell
        away from here,

962
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:08,657
      or come inside, man.

963
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,325
     Because you're drawing
    attention I don't need!

964
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,196
             Fuck.

965
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:16,799
     Come on man, come on.

966
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,972
        Now toughen up!

967
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,776
  It's always been me and Sam.

968
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,512
What the fuck am I gonna do now?

969
00:57:31,382 --> 00:57:32,614
           Look, man.

970
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:34,116
     If you're waiting for
      me to say something

971
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:36,118
     all profound and shit,
  it ain't gonna happen, man.

972
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,286
    I ain't built like that.

973
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,056
   If you wanna feel better,

974
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:43,158
I can help you there, man.

975
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,493
  But it's up to you, brother.

976
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:46,829
             Fuck.

977
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:31,166
      (inaudible chatter)

978
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:19,514
     You see, the classics
     are very much like...

979
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,217
       A romantic novel.

980
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:25,621
             Nolan.

981
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:29,491
          (slams book)

982
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:30,759
           (laughter)

983
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:31,827
        Am I boring you?

984
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:33,395
            No, Sir.

985
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:35,330
    If I catch you sleeping
       in my class again,

986
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:36,465
    I'm gonna write you up.

987
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:38,867
          (bell rings)

988
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:55,550
             Nolan.

989
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:59,554
   I noticed you haven't been
    as focused as of lately.

990
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:01,523
    Is everything all right?

991
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:03,258
    Yeah, everything's cool,

992
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:04,926
      I've just got a lot
     going on with practice

993
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,229
   and helping my mom around
      the house, you know?

994
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,865
      I understand you're
      dealing with a lot.

995
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:12,701
     I know you're having a
  hard time with Sam's death.

996
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,436
           I get it.

997
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,105
        If you ever need
      someone to talk to,

998
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:20,709
     my door's always open
       to you, all right?

999
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,346
 Thank you, I appreciate that.

1000
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:26,281
          Absolutely.

1001
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,085
         Oh, and Nolan?

1002
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,121
   I meant what I said about
    sleeping in my class.

1003
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:35,957
           Yes, Sir.

1004
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:38,393
       See you tomorrow.

1005
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:39,695
      Teacher: All right.

1006
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:48,870
              Hey.

1007
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:50,472
            Rachel.

1008
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,209
    I called you yesterday.
         What happened?

1009
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:56,712
      I was busy studying.

1010
01:01:58,148 --> 01:01:59,414
  Yeah, well I thought we were
  supposed to study together.

1011
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:00,982
      We were supposed to
   study together on Tuesday,

1012
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,418
     but today's Thursday,
     so that would mean...

1013
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,153
   I know, I know, I'm sorry.

1014
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,691
       I've been so busy
     lately, I lost track.

1015
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:10,959
        Busy doing what?

1016
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,662
You know you're not the only one

1017
01:02:13,664 --> 01:02:14,830
        that's ever lost
        a friend before.

1018
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,399
       Mourning is not an
       individual sport.

1019
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:19,234
 Look Rachel, I don't need you
  ragging on me too right now.

1020
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,769
         -Stop, Nolan.
             -What?

1021
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:22,370
     You don't get to walk
    away from me right now.

1022
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,272
Why do you keep pushing me away?

1023
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:25,907
            I mean,
   what's going on with you?

1024
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,175
    What's going on with us?

1025
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,244
       Nothing, I just--
    I have a lot on my mind.

1026
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:30,412
    Well, you look horrible.

1027
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:34,082
     Like you haven't slept
      or showered in days.

1028
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,519
    And I saw what you made
     on the exam last week.

1029
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:39,521
    And now Coach is pulling
      you from the lineup?

1030
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:40,856
 So that's what this is about?

1031
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:41,923
        You liked being
      able to say that you

1032
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:43,291
        go out with the
       star athlete, huh?

1033
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:44,426
            Stop it.

1034
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:46,928
     If you don't wanna be
   with me, then that's fine,

1035
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,597
     but it's obvious that
    you need help right now.

1036
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,866
        And you know no
     matter what's going on

1037
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:53,368
    between the two of us, I
 don't wanna see you like this.

1038
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,836
      You don't know what
     you're talking about!

1039
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:57,272
       In fact, you don't
       know what I need,

1040
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,440
     or anything about me.

1041
01:02:58,742 --> 01:02:59,841
      The only person who
       knows those things

1042
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,277
      is Sam and you don't
      look like Sam to me.

1043
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,780
        No, I'm looking
       at him right now.

1044
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,149
      Don't you ever talk
      about Sam that way.

1045
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:08,150
        -Do you hear me?
             -Stop!

1046
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:09,351
      You don't know him!

1047
01:03:10,721 --> 01:03:11,987
   You're gonna get yourself
      kicked off the team.

1048
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,388
     You shut the fuck up!

1049
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,523
   I don't need either of you

1050
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:15,557
     telling me what to do,
           all right?

1051
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:17,492
     -Just leave me alone!
        -Boy: Chill out.

1052
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:18,727
        Dude, fuck off!

1053
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:24,499

1054

            (knocks)

1055
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,409
          Yo, Spence.

1056
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,014
      Hey, what's up, man?

1057
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:45,220
      Good afternoon, sir.

1058
01:03:45,856 --> 01:03:47,422
    Welcome to Spence Mart.

1059
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,163
  Man, get yo ass inside, man.

1060
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:58,366
  What do you wanna start at?

1061
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:00,302
      All right, tell me,
   what's the deal with this?

1062
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:01,069
     That's the Maui Waui.

1063
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:06,474
           (laughing)

1064
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:08,410
            (coughs)

1065
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:15,350
      Nolan: I don't know
     if I'm feelin' it yet.

1066
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,185
   I can see it in your damn
    face you're feelin' it.

1067
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,553
         I can't tell.

1068
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,223
  If you can't tell, you high.

1069
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:22,457
     You trying them rings?

1070
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:26,261
         Get the peace.

1071
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,132
        The white lady.

1072
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:33,201
        Here, a little,
      right on your hand.

1073
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:35,770
       Come on, come on.

1074
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,642
       How do you do it?
        Just like this?

1075
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:41,943
       Right, real quick.

1076
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:44,813
             Shit.

1077
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,216
           (snorting)

1078
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,920
        (Spence laughs)

1079
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:53,655
        (Spence laughs)

1080
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:55,724
             Yeah.

1081
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:58,059
 Bring you right back up, man.

1082
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,794
           -Oh, man.
             -Yeah.

1083
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:15,944
           (sighing)

1084
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,660
            Spence.

1085
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,629
        I wanna do this.

1086
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,631
    Hey, put that down, man.

1087
01:05:37,868 --> 01:05:39,234
 That's for the big boys, man.

1088
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:42,604
 You are not allowed, come on.

1089
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:45,641
        Big boys?

1090
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:46,041
   Spence, I'm not even that
     much younger than you.

1091
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,977
      Hey, listen, why do
     you care, if I buy it?

1092
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,380
-You hear what the fuck I said?
          -It's fine.

1093
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:54,482
         I said that's
       not for you, okay?

1094
01:05:54,885 --> 01:05:57,852
     I don't ever wanna see
 you touching that shit. Ever.

1095
01:05:58,322 --> 01:05:59,587
        <i> Comprendes?</i>

1096
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:01,089
Sorry man, I just thought that--

1097
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,558
         Hey, I don't--
   I don't need you to think.

1098
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:06,027
I just need you to do as I say.

1099
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:09,631
      God damn, you ruined
     my fuckin' high, man!

1100
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:11,967
             Shit.

1101
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:13,969
  Ain't it time for you to be
getting home or something, man?

1102
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:14,736
         Come on, man.

1103
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,172
     Giving me more trouble
       than you're worth.

1104
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:22,477
           (sighing)

1105
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:30,618
        You still here?

1106
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,753
           (knocking)

1107
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:38,526
              Hey.

1108
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,262
          What are you
       doing here, Nolan?

1109
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:43,365
    Nolan: (sighs) I...

1110
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:45,367
          Just leave.

1111
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:47,602
          -Leave now.
      -Rachel, I'm sorry.

1112
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:49,404
    Yeah, and you should be.

1113
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,108
   I'm a real person, Nolan.

1114
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,809
    You can't just treat me
   like one of your friends.

1115
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:56,111
 I thought you were different.

1116
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,412
            I know.

1117
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:02,551
    And that's why I'm here.
  I'm here to apologize, okay?

1118
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:03,952
    Look, it took me an hour
   to find the perfect card.

1119
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:07,122
  Then it should take you less
 time to get back to your car.

1120
01:07:07,124 --> 01:07:08,223
              Dad!

1121
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:09,724
       Give us a minute,
        baby doll, okay?

1122
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:13,328
      Sir, look, I just--

1123
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,696
      No, we need to talk.

1124
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:36,751
 You ever smoke a Cuban cigar?

1125
01:07:37,854 --> 01:07:38,953
            No, Sir.

1126
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,422
    That's not what I heard.

1127
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:54,235
Matter of fact, I heard that you
        and your friends

1128
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,937
      will smoke anything
       that'll light up.

1129
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:02,077
         Is that true?

1130
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,080
    Sir, I think that lately
  I've been given the wrong--

1131
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:06,714
      The wrong what, boy?

1132
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:07,816
       The wrong address?

1133
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:10,151
Cause the family that lives here

1134
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:12,520
  is an educated family, they
   are a hard-working family,

1135
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:13,788
they are a family that believes

1136
01:08:14,024 --> 01:08:15,523
       that you shouldn't
     put shit up your nose.

1137
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,460
     They're a family that
     sees through bullshit.

1138
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:19,661
      Sir, I don't know--

1139
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:22,597
       Don't speak, just
    stand there in silence.

1140
01:08:25,802 --> 01:08:27,335
  That's my daughter in there.

1141
01:08:28,905 --> 01:08:30,038
         You get that?

1142
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:32,774
          My daughter,

1143
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:34,142
       she belongs to me,

1144
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:36,010
 and she belongs to her mother.

1145
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,313
       Not to some little
       punk with an arm.

1146
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:48,256
  You know if it was up to me,

1147
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:49,724
 there wouldn't be a next time.

1148
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,195
  But if there is a next time,

1149
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:57,465
        if you decide to
       open up your mouth

1150
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,000
  and disrespect my daughter,

1151
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:01,002
   I will come to your house
   in the middle of the night

1152
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:02,904
      and I will drag you
     and your drug buddies

1153
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:04,239
      out into the middle
         of the street

1154
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:05,740
  and I will beat your asses.

1155
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:07,075
     -Do you understand me?
             -Yes.

1156
01:09:07,077 --> 01:09:09,310
         Don't answer,
      just nod your head.

1157
01:09:18,088 --> 01:09:19,687
      God gave you a gift.

1158
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:24,893
      He gave you a gift.

1159
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,429
  And you can choose to either

1160
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:29,864
      smoke those batters,

1161
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,833
    or you can smoke crack.

1162
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:34,702
      The choice is yours.

1163
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:39,340
       You're headed down
      an empty road, son.

1164
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:41,910
        It's a dead end.

1165
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,680
And I'll be damned if I let you,

1166
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,416
    I repeat, if I let you,

1167
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,019
   take my daughter with you.

1168
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:02,697
 I'm gonna give you 30 seconds
    to get off my property.

1169
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:07,769
              27.

1170
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:11,573
              23.

1171
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,216
         (door creaks)

1172
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:51,646
             Dehra:
   <i> Hey, lady. You doing okay?</i>

1173
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:53,414
 You don't look like yourself.

1174
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:56,184
     It's nothin', just...

1175
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:58,286
      Dealing with a lot.

1176
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:00,955
          Is it Nolan?

1177
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,258
        Why do you ask?

1178
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:06,394
        Just heard that
      he hadn't been doing

1179
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:08,596
 so well since his friend died.

1180
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,434
    If you need anything, or
  need to talk about anything,

1181
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,636
       I'm here for you.

1182
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:16,671
  What are you tryin' to say?

1183
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,943
        I'm saying that
       maybe you've done

1184
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:24,479
   all that you can do under
   the circumstances, Sharon.

1185
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,185
       Maybe it's time to
    bring in a professional.

1186
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,624
   Well, if you're suggesting
   that he needs counselling,

1187
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,192
   you can stop right there.

1188
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:42,397
 I don't know where you've been
    getting your ideas from,

1189
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:43,665
      but I am his mother,

1190
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,500
   and I am very confident...

1191
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:47,902
   Listen, I'm not trying to
tell you how to raise your son,

1192
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:49,404
     by any means, come on.

1193
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,372
        I'm just saying
       that sometimes...

1194
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:52,974
            Sharon?

1195
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:55,843
            Sharon?

1196
01:11:57,414 --> 01:11:59,914
   Sometimes the people that
     are the closest to us,

1197
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,984
      are the least likely
      to see the situation

1198
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,152
     for what it really is.

1199
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:07,221
     You have no idea what
    I've been dealing with.

1200
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:09,657
   And I would appreciate it

1201
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,026
     if you would just deal
       with your own kids

1202
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:13,661
 and stop listening to gossip,

1203
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,496
    because my son is fine.

1204
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,165
       So just back off.

1205
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:18,933
        Sharon, I didn't
      mean to offend you.

1206
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:02,110
    (footsteps approaching)

1207
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:10,718
            (knocks)

1208
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,886
             Nolan?

1209
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:15,123
            <i> Nolan.</i>

1210
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:19,127
     <i> What are you doing?</i>

1211
01:13:19,763 --> 01:13:21,396
    <i> Open this door, Nolan.</i>

1212
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,000
     Open the door, Nolan.

1213
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:27,935
     I need to talk to you.

1214
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:29,804
       Mom, I'm not doing
    anything, just go away.

1215
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:31,839
           I'm fine.

1216
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,476
     I can't do that, baby.

1217
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:37,912
 Can you open the door, please?

1218
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,615
    <i> Let me in, sweetheart.</i>

1219
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,084
    Let me help you, honey.

1220
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:46,621
        Okay, let me in!

1221
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:48,923
        Let me help you!

1222
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,125
      Nolan:<i> Mom, I don't</i>
<i> need your help anymore,</i>

1223
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:53,361
   <i> I'm not a kid, all right?</i>
     <i> Just leave me alone!</i>

1224
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:56,431
           (bubbling)

1225
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:01,836
            (coughs)

1226
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:05,706
    <i> I'm not a kid anymore.</i>

1227
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:06,908
  If you don't open this door,

1228
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:08,709
  I am gonna call the police!

1229
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,450
       Sounds great, Mom,
     call the fucking cops.

1230
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:17,385
        (heart beating)

1231
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,993
     Open the door, Nolan.

1232
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,063
    Can you let me help you?

1233
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,632
    Sharon:<i> Mommy knows that</i>
     <i> you're hurting baby.</i>

1234
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,167
       I feel great, Mom.

1235
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,470
            (pants)

1236
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,006
      As a matter of fact,

1237
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:41,242
      I'm gonna go flying.

1238
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:43,845
  What are you talking about?

1239
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:46,481
      I'm gonna go flying!

1240
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:47,582
             Fuck.

1241
01:14:49,586 --> 01:14:50,685
             Nolan!

1242
01:14:50,687 --> 01:14:51,919
        Open this door!

1243
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:59,694
           Dr. Lane:
     So would you say that
 your falling out of the window

1244
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:03,264
     or thinking you could
     fly out of the window,

1245
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:05,766
      would you say that's
       an isolated event?

1246
01:15:05,768 --> 01:15:07,935
        Or would you say
        that it could be

1247
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:11,038
        a part of other
      events in your past?

1248
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,341
        I don't have an
        addiction, okay?

1249
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:14,976
 I'm not addicted to anything.

1250
01:15:14,978 --> 01:15:17,378
  I can stop whenever I want,
     I just got a bad load.

1251
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,679
      You got a bad load?

1252
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:19,914
             Yeah.

1253
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:23,851
    Well, Nolan, I have been
    doing this for 18 years,

1254
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:26,954
     and I have to tell you
  that 99 percent of the time,

1255
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:28,055
        that's not true.

1256
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:31,459
         Honestly, Mom,

1257
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:34,295
 this isn't gonna happen again,

1258
01:15:34,297 --> 01:15:35,596
      I promise you, okay?

1259
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,699
       I've been dealing
     with a lot right now.

1260
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:39,967
      You both know that.

1261
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,470
   I'm better now, I just...

1262
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,207
           I'm sorry.

1263
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:49,610
        My son has never
      been in any trouble.

1264
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,648
     I just think that he--
  he's going through a phase.

1265
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,949
  Well, you know what I think?

1266
01:15:55,552 --> 01:15:58,586
      I think that you are
    aiding in his addiction

1267
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:01,022
 by rationalizing his behavior.

1268
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:02,089
           And Nolan,

1269
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:05,626
    I think you're in denial
     about your addiction.

1270
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:09,263
             Yeah.

1271
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:10,932
    That's what it is.

1272
01:16:11,668 --> 01:16:12,767
      Yeah, you're wrong.

1273
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:15,503
       This is bullshit.

1274
01:16:15,705 --> 01:16:17,672
       Excuse me, Nolan,
    we're here to help you.

1275
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:19,140
     That's why we're here.

1276
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:22,276
              We--

1277
01:16:23,713 --> 01:16:25,880
       Sharon, I know you
     think that all of your

1278
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:28,115
protection and love can overcome

1279
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:29,717
   all of Nolan's challenges,

1280
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:32,286
     but I am here to tell
     you that his addiction

1281
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:34,155
   is beyond your influence.

1282
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:37,792
   I know that you have more
    knowledge in this area.

1283
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:39,660
       But I know my son.

1284
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,462
   And he's not just my son,

1285
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:43,264
 he is my best friend and if--

1286
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:44,765
       if we have made it
       this far together,

1287
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,968
         we can make it
     through this together.

1288
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:48,869
             Fine.

1289
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:51,105
       You choose not to
       continue therapy,

1290
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,540
       I can't force you.

1291
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,775
  But I want you to know that
    it is against my advice.

1292
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,277
      I'm not saying that

1293
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,112
 we won't continue with therapy

1294
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,781
     but my biggest concern
       is getting my son

1295
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,683
    back home and in school.

1296
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,885
      That's your choice.

1297
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:09,991
     But I am asking you to
  please get him in a program.

1298
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,928
 Because that is the way he'll
    be able to move forward,

1299
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,463
         he'll be able

1300
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:17,732
  to have this successful life
       you want for him.

1301
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:19,867
       I just don't want
     to push him too hard.

1302
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:22,470
     Nolan is not as tough
    as he comes across.

1303
01:17:22,472 --> 01:17:24,739
     Well, this is my first
    time assessing your son,

1304
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,474
     but please believe me,

1305
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:28,909
    he is much tougher than
    you give him credit for.

1306
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:34,749
           Thank you.

1307
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:37,218
    And I will be in touch.

1308
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:43,491
   And he is not equipped to
 make this decision by himself.

1309
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:45,059
         He is a minor.

1310
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,405
  Well, how long is the wait?

1311
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:02,209
        So you're saying
      that there are only

1312
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:04,378
       two beds available
        and that my son

1313
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,347
 would have to apply for a bed?

1314
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,216
      Okay, well how long
        does that take?

1315
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,388
          Three weeks.

1316
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:17,692
  Well, my son needs help now.

1317
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:20,461
     Today, not in 21 days.

1318
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:24,131
       Your pamphlet says
      you can help today!

1319
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:28,736
          You know...

1320
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:30,438
          I'm a nurse,

1321
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:34,041
 I know that my son is not the
 only kid with a drug problem,

1322
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,711
    I'm not an idiot, but if
  you can't get him help now,

1323
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:38,746
then that is false advertising!

1324
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:07,374
          This is it.

1325
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:08,976
          This is it.

1326
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:11,479
 I want you to go out there and
 do exactly what we practiced.

1327
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,281
  That's it, no more, no less.

1328
01:19:14,851 --> 01:19:17,451
    Blood, sweat, tears.

1329
01:19:21,724 --> 01:19:22,990
  And leave nothing to chance.

1330
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:25,526
        Yeah? You ready?

1331
01:19:25,528 --> 01:19:26,527
          Team: Ready.

1332
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:28,095
             -Yeah?
          -Team: Yeah.

1333
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,463
     Let's get on the bus.

1334
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:31,532
           Let's go.

1335
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:32,666
          Hey, Coach.

1336
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,268
What are you doing here, Nolan?

1337
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:35,603
       I'm here to play.

1338
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:37,772
        You're in no
       condition to play,

1339
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,106
 you know that as well as I do.

1340
01:19:39,709 --> 01:19:41,308
       Coach just give me
    the chance to show you

1341
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,843
    what I can do, you won't
   regret it, I promise you.

1342
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:45,813
  Son, I warned you about the
 consequences of your actions.

1343
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,817
       I am here for you,
       but off the field.

1344
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:52,887
        I can't let what
      you're going through

1345
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,488
      affect the others by
    having you on the team.

1346
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:57,992
 So you're just writing me off?

1347
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:04,231
      Yeah, you know what?

1348
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:06,066
      I don't need you or
      this bullshit team!

1349
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,039
             Nolan.

1350
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:14,742
             Nolan!

1351
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,826
         And Mom, just
     rest, lots of fluids,

1352
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:33,360
and two of these every 12 hours.

1353
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:35,930
      And he will be back
     to himself in no time.

1354
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:37,698
          -Thank you.
        -You're welcome.

1355
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,166
        See ya, buddy.

1356
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:46,273
          Hey, Sharon,

1357
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:48,309
       I'm so sorry about
     our last conversation.

1358
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:49,910
    I was completely out...

1359
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:53,380
      It's getting worse.

1360
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:54,515
              How?

1361
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:57,418
        He doesn't come
        out of his room.

1362
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:00,421
         I took all the
      locks off the doors.

1363
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,523
    I check my bank account,

1364
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,059
        $400 is missing.

1365
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:06,126
             No...

1366
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:08,162
And I cannot get him into rehab,

1367
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:09,396
  there are no beds available.

1368
01:21:09,398 --> 01:21:10,564
    What about Doctor Lane?

1369
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:11,866
      Oh, my god, if I...

1370
01:21:13,903 --> 01:21:16,804
       If I even bring up
    her name, he flips out.

1371
01:21:16,806 --> 01:21:18,472
     Okay, okay, come here.

1372
01:21:23,913 --> 01:21:25,246
You sound like you're giving up

1373
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,780
and there's something we can do.

1374
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:48,936
            (knocks)

1375
01:21:54,877 --> 01:21:56,243
        Nolan: Hey, man.

1376
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,344
         Boy, what the
      hell you doin' here?

1377
01:21:57,747 --> 01:21:59,013
    Look man, I need some...

1378
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:00,080
           (sniffing)

1379
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:01,348
        Woman:<i> Spencer?</i>

1380
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:02,917
        Hey, who's that?

1381
01:22:03,452 --> 01:22:04,518
       That's my mother.

1382
01:22:05,221 --> 01:22:06,453
        -You got a mom?
             -What?

1383
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:08,088
        Hey, look, man,
       I'm just messing.

1384
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,326
      Dude, what the fuck?

1385
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:15,195
      Speaking of mothers,
shouldn't you be with yours?

1386
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:17,531
        What you worried
       about my mom for?

1387
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:18,933
        Because all good
     little boys need to be

1388
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:20,768
        spending quality
      time with they Moms.

1389
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:23,203
  Matter of fact, you need to
  get yo ass up off my porch,

1390
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:24,471
     and back to your mama.

1391
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:25,773
        Hey, look, man.

1392
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:27,508
     You gotta hook me up,
   you know I'm good for it.

1393
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:29,310
     Hook you up? Man, get
    the fuck up outta here.

1394
01:22:29,312 --> 01:22:30,377
       Hey, listen, look.

1395
01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:33,647
     I got a gold bracelet
  and a 36-inch TV in my car.

1396
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:34,848
    What can that do for me?

1397
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:38,852
         Come on, man.

1398
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:41,555
    All right man, go
      get that shit, man.

1399
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:43,057
       And when you come
     back, wait right here,

1400
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:44,458
      don't knock on this
      fuckin' door again.

1401
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,993
   Got ya, got ya, thank you.

1402
01:22:57,606 --> 01:22:58,806
              Hi.

1403
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:02,076
           (sighing)

1404
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:03,377
        You sure you're
       ready to do this?

1405
01:23:03,846 --> 01:23:05,045
    I have no choice.

1406
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:08,082
     If I don't do it now,
      I'm gonna lose him.

1407
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:11,418
  I cannot lose my only child.

1408
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:13,187
            I know.

1409
01:23:13,923 --> 01:23:15,189
   Okay, well we're all set.

1410
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:16,690
  See you at the house, okay?

1411
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:17,758
             Okay.

1412
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:20,227
        Dehra: Bye bye!

1413
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:55,429
  Where are you gonna put them

1414
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,198
       when you take them
        outta your bag?

1415
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:00,901
      Doctor Morris needs
   them on the second floor.

1416
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:04,638
           Methadone?

1417
01:24:05,808 --> 01:24:07,775
     In your personal bag?

1418
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:11,078
        I told you he's
    tougher than you think,

1419
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,247
        and this is much
      bigger than you are.

1420
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:18,419
      What the hell do you
 plan on doing with these? No!

1421
01:24:18,421 --> 01:24:19,720
       What would you do?

1422
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:23,223
     To keep your child on
    this planet another day?

1423
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,758
        There are better
         ways to ensure

1424
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,393
    that he's gonna be okay.

1425
01:24:29,665 --> 01:24:31,098
  Would you just listen to me?

1426
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:34,101
    If you get caught taking
  that outside this hospital,

1427
01:24:34,103 --> 01:24:35,702
you know you'll get put in jail.

1428
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:37,438
    It's a federal offense,
        you're a nurse,

1429
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,939
         you know that.

1430
01:24:38,941 --> 01:24:42,409
      Thank you Cassandra,
      for your assistance.

1431
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:45,446
I'm taking it into my own hands.

1432
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,315
            Sharon.

1433
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,256
       I understand your
       frustration, I do.

1434
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,159
 And you know I'm here for you.

1435
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:04,031
 If we do the right things now,

1436
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:06,633
      Nolan will be fine.

1437
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:10,838
     Thank you. Thank you.

1438
01:25:11,407 --> 01:25:12,506
    Please don't do this.

1439
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:14,041
             Don't!

1440
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:16,176
           Thank you.

1441
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,212
     You're putting me in a
   really bad position here.

1442
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:20,814
           Sharon...

1443
01:25:22,218 --> 01:25:23,350
         What the hell?

1444
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:39,466
            (sighs)

1445
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,635
        -Rachel:<i> Hello?</i>
            -Rachel.

1446
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:45,005
        I wanna see you.

1447
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:47,841
              No.

1448
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:51,011
      I don't think that's
    such a good idea, Nolan.

1449
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,913
     Rachel:<i> I have to go.</i>

1450
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:54,348
     Rachel, wait, Rachel!

1451
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,083
          (door slams)

1452
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:01,088
  Help me with the groceries?

1453
01:26:05,694 --> 01:26:08,428
    No, the ones in the car.

1454
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:19,506
       Hey, how ya doin?

1455
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:21,608
   Just a couple more things.

1456
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:22,910
            Sure.

1457
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:31,251
           (grunting)

1458
01:26:37,326 --> 01:26:40,394
       (Sharon shushing)

1459
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:42,196
    Sharon: I'm trying to...

1460
01:27:26,342 --> 01:27:26,640
              Hey.

1461
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:26,939
   If you're gonna do it, you
might as well do it right.

1462
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:33,814
        30 day supply of
  buprenorphine and syringes.

1463
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,783
     You really think it's
     gonna take that long?

1464
01:27:37,186 --> 01:27:38,919
     I don't know, Sharon.

1465
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:41,288
     I'm far from being an
     addiction specialist.

1466
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:43,023
    What I do know though,

1467
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:44,524
  is that in order to give him

1468
01:27:44,526 --> 01:27:46,526
  a chance to really recover,

1469
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:48,528
  you gotta keep him isolated.

1470
01:27:49,231 --> 01:27:50,998
     At least until you get
      him into a program.

1471
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,702
           All right.

1472
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,468
        What's going on?

1473
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:38,845
         (Nolan yawns)

1474
01:28:48,257 --> 01:28:49,389
              Mom?

1475
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,024
     Mom, what's going on?

1476
01:28:51,026 --> 01:28:52,159
        I'm helping you.

1477
01:28:53,262 --> 01:28:54,361
              Mom?

1478
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:56,663
             What?

1479
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:03,070
       You're helping me?

1480
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,506
            (snorts)
   Mom, get these off of me!

1481
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:07,908
           (groaning)

1482
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,280
     Did you do this to me?

1483
01:29:15,617 --> 01:29:16,650
              Mom?

1484
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:18,418
 Ok, I know that you're upset.

1485
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:22,022
      But this is the only
      option that I have.

1486
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:25,258
      I can't stand by and
     let you kill yourself.

1487
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:33,867
          Mom, you...

1488
01:29:35,337 --> 01:29:36,536
          Oh, my God.

1489
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,439
    Mom, you don't know what
     you're talking about.

1490
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:45,245
   Mom, take these off, now!

1491
01:29:46,148 --> 01:29:47,414
         No, we will...

1492
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:51,385
    Get through it together.

1493
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:53,220
 I won't let you do this alone.

1494
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:55,422
        I'll be with you
     every step of the way

1495
01:29:55,424 --> 01:29:56,823
         and we'll get
      through it together.

1496
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,260
  No, you let me go now, Mom.

1497
01:30:04,099 --> 01:30:05,632
    You can't do this, Mom.

1498
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:09,469
     This has to be against
     the law or something.

1499
01:30:10,038 --> 01:30:11,171
             Fuck!

1500
01:30:12,775 --> 01:30:14,241
       Mom you don't have
     the right to do this.

1501
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:15,475
           Yes, I do!

1502
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:18,979
        I'm your mother.

1503
01:30:20,215 --> 01:30:22,315
    And I would do anything
        to protect you.

1504
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:24,451
      Even if it kills me.

1505
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:27,521
 I have to get you well, Nolan.

1506
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:31,858
              Mom?

1507
01:30:51,246 --> 01:30:52,479
             Nolan!

1508
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:56,049
    Nolan, stop it, you're
      gonna hurt yourself!

1509
01:30:56,418 --> 01:30:58,285
 Mom, you've got me chained up,

1510
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:00,220
       what do you expect
       from me. It hurts!

1511
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:04,491
           (groaning)

1512
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:08,161
    Mom that hurts. Why do
   you keep doing this to me?

1513
01:31:09,765 --> 01:31:12,165
    It's to calm you so that
    you don't hurt yourself.

1514
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:14,401
   You can't go cold turkey.

1515
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:18,905
   Mom, I just wanna go home.

1516
01:31:20,843 --> 01:31:22,209
       Please, stop this.

1517
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:25,579
       Listen, I promise
      it'll be different.

1518
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:27,481
      I'll stop, I swear.

1519
01:31:29,117 --> 01:31:30,417
         I can't, baby.

1520
01:31:31,286 --> 01:31:33,186
      Not until the poison
     is outta your system.

1521
01:31:36,592 --> 01:31:37,824
         We should eat.

1522
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,595
   Look, I have soup for you.

1523
01:31:44,433 --> 01:31:46,766
    Mom, I don't want soup.
        I wanna go home!

1524
01:31:46,768 --> 01:31:48,068
           Get away.

1525
01:31:55,544 --> 01:31:56,776
     You're not going home.

1526
01:31:56,778 --> 01:31:57,878
           (sniffles)

1527
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:00,113
   You're not going anywhere
    until you're clean.

1528
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,850
 You have a problem and this is

1529
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:05,919
         the only way I
      know how to fix it.

1530
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:08,788
        To keep me
    handcuffed to the wall?

1531
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:10,290
     You gave me no choice!

1532
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,559
      You think I want to
      treat you like this?

1533
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:18,965
      Can you loosen these
      handcuffs at least?

1534
01:32:18,967 --> 01:32:20,600
   They're killing my wrists.

1535
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:24,638
            Please?

1536
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:38,251
              Ow.

1537
01:32:38,754 --> 01:32:39,920
         Sharon: Sorry.

1538
01:32:56,004 --> 01:32:57,137
         You gotta eat.

1539
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:59,773
       If you don't eat,
     you can't get better,

1540
01:32:59,775 --> 01:33:01,508
    if you don't get better,
       you can't go home.

1541
01:33:06,548 --> 01:33:07,714
             Here.

1542
01:33:07,716 --> 01:33:09,115
   At least have some water.

1543
01:33:10,686 --> 01:33:11,952
    You need to drink this.

1544
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,155
            Come on.

1545
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:17,490
          I hate you.

1546
01:33:29,705 --> 01:33:30,904
         If you need to
      go to the bathroom,

1547
01:33:30,906 --> 01:33:32,172
    I have a bedpan for you.

1548
01:33:38,614 --> 01:33:39,713
          I love you.

1549
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:10,543
   Tommy: Hey, Mrs. Adamson?

1550
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:12,646
         Hello, Thomas.

1551
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:13,847
   Hey, I was just wondering
       if I could stop by

1552
01:34:14,182 --> 01:34:15,515
         and see Nolan.
      Or is it a bad time?

1553
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:17,684
   I am just on the way out.

1554
01:34:18,086 --> 01:34:20,153
       Oh, I, we just...

1555
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,155
       I haven't seen him
       around in a while.

1556
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:24,391
        Well, he's doing
        much better now.

1557
01:34:24,693 --> 01:34:26,259
  He went to spend a few weeks

1558
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:27,961
   with my parents in Kansas.

1559
01:34:27,963 --> 01:34:29,496
 Wanted a break from everything

1560
01:34:29,798 --> 01:34:31,765
and we just thought it was best
  that we didn't tell anyone.

1561
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,167
             Okay.

1562
01:34:35,303 --> 01:34:36,569
The next time that you see him,

1563
01:34:36,772 --> 01:34:38,038
      can you please tell
       him that the team

1564
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,141
 -misses him and we said hello?
         -Sharon: Yes.

1565
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:42,842
  We hope he gets better soon.

1566
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:44,344
   Thank you, Thomas. I will.

1567
01:35:13,141 --> 01:35:14,941
            (groans)

1568
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:31,224
       (distorted voice)
    I been watchin' you boy.

1569
01:35:32,928 --> 01:35:34,728
      You learned to throw
          a curve ball

1570
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:36,096
       just like your Pa.

1571
01:35:39,935 --> 01:35:42,135
           (tapping)

1572
01:36:17,305 --> 01:36:19,839
       (distorted voice)
       You got scouts...

1573
01:36:21,209 --> 01:36:22,609
   Coming out to your games?

1574
01:36:25,747 --> 01:36:27,213
       I bet you think...

1575
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,949
you're gonna get a scholarship.

1576
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,853
 And then it's off to the pros!

1577
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,489
           (laughing)

1578
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:42,629
 (distorted voice) Well, I got
    some news for you, son.

1579
01:36:46,635 --> 01:36:48,201
  You ain't no better than me.

1580
01:36:49,504 --> 01:36:50,870
        (glass breaking)

1581
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,340
(distorted voice) You're a chip
     off the ol' dung heap!

1582
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,477
        That's my blood
  flowing through your veins,

1583
01:36:57,479 --> 01:36:59,379
     which means you ain't
      never gonna be shit!

1584
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,381
            (crying)

1585
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:03,416
       (distorted voice)
    Just like your pa.

1586
01:37:04,519 --> 01:37:05,752
      What are you doing?

1587
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:09,522
       Stay away from me.

1588
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:11,958
       (distorted voice)
          So let's see

1589
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,326
         what you got.

1590
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:14,527
         No, get away!

1591
01:37:28,276 --> 01:37:29,409
         (yells) Nolan!

1592
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:32,111
         (yells) Nolan!

1593
01:37:37,853 --> 01:37:39,285
         (yells) Nolan!

1594
01:37:41,523 --> 01:37:43,022
           (groaning)

1595
01:37:43,658 --> 01:37:44,791
       -You're not real.
        -Sharon:<i> Nolan!</i>

1596
01:37:44,793 --> 01:37:46,025
        <i> Where are you?</i>

1597
01:37:46,828 --> 01:37:48,595
       Nolan, answer me!

1598
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:51,197
           (groaning)

1599
01:37:59,507 --> 01:38:01,374
       Daniel: She tried
     to ruin it for me too.

1600
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:02,876
      I'm nothin like you!

1601
01:38:03,979 --> 01:38:05,845
    Just stay away! Go away!

1602
01:38:05,847 --> 01:38:07,780
            (crying)

1603
01:38:09,517 --> 01:38:11,384
        You can't escape
        your fate, boy.

1604
01:38:12,254 --> 01:38:15,755
   It's just a matter of time
 till you end up just like me.

1605
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:18,825
            (crying)

1606
01:38:18,827 --> 01:38:20,727
           (shushing)

1607
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:22,061
           It's okay.

1608
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:26,132
      (cell phone ringing)

1609
01:38:32,007 --> 01:38:33,172
      Hey, how's it going?

1610
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:36,175
        I thought he was
        locked up tight.

1611
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:39,178
  He could've died out there.

1612
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,849
 I don't know if I can do this.

1613
01:38:43,218 --> 01:38:44,550
      <i> It's a lot harder</i>
       <i> than I thought.</i>

1614
01:38:44,552 --> 01:38:46,085
         Okay, Sharon,

1615
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:47,420
    when I told you all you
     had to do was call me,

1616
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:48,521
          I meant it.

1617
01:38:50,959 --> 01:38:52,909
            I know.

1618
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:54,860
   I am just so used to doing
     everything on my own.

1619
01:38:55,864 --> 01:38:57,297
      <i> You ask people for</i>
   <i> help and they feel like</i>

1620
01:38:57,299 --> 01:39:00,099
       they can criticize
       you or judge you.

1621
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:02,535
     Trust me, I have made
    plenty of mistakes,

1622
01:39:02,537 --> 01:39:04,037
  I have no room to judge you.

1623
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:06,005
     <i> Sharon, let me help.</i>

1624
01:39:09,945 --> 01:39:11,811
        Could you bring
        me some bandages

1625
01:39:11,813 --> 01:39:13,513
         and supplies?

1626
01:39:14,883 --> 01:39:16,549
      I don't think I can
     leave him alone again.

1627
01:39:16,551 --> 01:39:18,451
       Okay. No problem.

1628
01:39:18,954 --> 01:39:21,654
    If I leave now, I can be
with you within the hour. Okay?

1629
01:39:22,424 --> 01:39:23,957
     <i> -I'll see you soon.</i>
             -Okay.

1630
01:39:25,093 --> 01:39:26,359
           Thank you.

1631
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:46,746
         I need a shot.

1632
01:39:49,451 --> 01:39:51,050
         It's not time
       for another shot.

1633
01:39:51,786 --> 01:39:53,019
       You haven't given
      me one in two days,

1634
01:39:53,021 --> 01:39:54,320
  I need another one now, Mom.

1635
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:55,521
        Come on, please.

1636
01:39:56,124 --> 01:39:57,190
           Tomorrow.

1637
01:39:57,459 --> 01:39:58,992
          (screaming)

1638
01:39:58,994 --> 01:40:00,326
              -No!
        -Give it to me!

1639
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:01,427
          (screaming)

1640
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,935
  This is not the way a mother
 is supposed to treat her son!

1641
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:10,837
          Look at me!

1642
01:40:11,139 --> 01:40:12,572
       Can't you see what
      you're doing to me?

1643
01:40:14,376 --> 01:40:15,842
    I am trying to save you.

1644
01:40:16,444 --> 01:40:17,677
       You're killing me.

1645
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:19,178
  Sharon: I am protecting you.

1646
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:20,680
              No.

1647
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:25,018
 You're trying to ruin my life.

1648
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:27,186
    Just like you did Dad's!

1649
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:29,789
        Yeah, you're the
       reason he's dead!

1650
01:40:30,792 --> 01:40:31,924
       That is not true.

1651
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:33,559
        Do not say that.

1652
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:36,362
 Yeah! That's what's happening.

1653
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:38,531
      You are all I have.

1654
01:40:39,634 --> 01:40:42,468
     Everything I have ever
     done has been for you.

1655
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:45,138
     I have done everything
    I can do to protect you!

1656
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:46,305
        No, you didn't.

1657
01:40:46,975 --> 01:40:49,042
         You were only
      protecting yourself!

1658
01:40:51,913 --> 01:40:53,312
   Why didn't we just leave?

1659
01:40:53,882 --> 01:40:55,515
       You were just too
    young to understand--

1660
01:40:55,517 --> 01:40:56,682
     You're a lying bitch!

1661
01:40:56,684 --> 01:40:57,784
           (groaning)

1662
01:40:58,653 --> 01:41:00,086
        God, I'm sorry!

1663
01:41:00,088 --> 01:41:01,587
     Just get away from me!

1664
01:41:01,589 --> 01:41:03,122
      Just leave me alone!

1665
01:41:50,772 --> 01:41:53,539
           Mom! Mom!

1666
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:06,319
     Give me the gun, boy.

1667
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:09,889
      You're too little to
      have such a big toy.

1668
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,393
    I said give me the gun!

1669
01:42:14,395 --> 01:42:16,062
            (groans)

1670
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:23,336
       (distorted voice)
  I said give me the gun, boy!

1671
01:42:25,673 --> 01:42:29,008
            (groans)

1672
01:42:33,348 --> 01:42:35,314
           (gunshots)

1673
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:37,543
     Sharon: Baby, wake up!

1674
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,614
        Wake up, Nolan!

1675
01:43:42,183 --> 01:43:43,482
        (screams) Nolan!

1676
01:43:43,718 --> 01:43:45,484
 Give me the key to the cuffs,
        give me the key.

1677
01:43:47,422 --> 01:43:50,089
        Please, wake up.
         Wake up, baby!

1678
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,227
  Sharon: He's not breathing!

1679
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:55,895
  I gave him the wrong things!

1680
01:43:55,897 --> 01:43:57,330

01:43:57,332 --> 01:43:59,031
            My baby!

1682
01:43:59,033 --> 01:44:00,733
           (sobbing)

1683
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:27,560
         (screams) No!

1684
01:44:27,562 --> 01:44:28,661
            Wake up!

1685
01:44:42,944 --> 01:44:44,210
      Sam: Come on, Nolan.

1686
01:44:47,882 --> 01:44:50,016
   Trust me. She'll be okay.

1687
01:44:58,826 --> 01:45:00,192
    Nolan: I've missed you.

01:45:20,014 --> 01:45:23,082
