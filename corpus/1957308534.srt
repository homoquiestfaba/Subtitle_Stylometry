1
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,512
Perfumes and spices, consigned
to one Señora Alaquiz.

2
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,576
Yes. I will send your regards
to the Señora.

3
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,192
Thank you.

4
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,794
Ah, Turks...

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,719
Since they've taken Constantinople
and the Holy Land

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,659
they know we only trade on Chios
through their sufferance

7
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,678
The Imams and the generals
thirst for ou blood.

8
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,796
And one day they'll have it.
- Not today.

9
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,498
Where are you going?
- I'm off to the souq, see what I can find.

10
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,397
Cristóbal, be careful!

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,955
Strangers disappear
on this island.

12
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,396
How much?
- Only 100 dinars.

13
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,478
The color, the texture,
it's fit for a king.

14
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,956
But not even a king
could afford it.

15
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,416
Can you imagine the profit
from a shipload of this?

16
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,476
A shipload, señor Colón?

17
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,478
It comes across the mountains
and deserts, from India.

18
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,876
India... I've never
seen anything like this.

19
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,119
Nor you won't,
this side of Cathay.

20
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,480
Did you read up Marco Polo,
his trip to the Great Khan?

21
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,036
Cities with roofs of gold!
Jeweled trappings for elephants!

22
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,716
In the East, my little stall
would be a poor thing indeed.

23
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,319
The map.

24
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:11,217
The details of these shorelines
came from turkish sailors.

25
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,010
There is no other map
so exact.

26
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,716
But surely
you have made Chios too large.

27
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,558
It is our island.

28
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,236
What price?

29
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,715
You are genoese.
Ducats.

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,717
Let's see. 18.

31
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,592
I should have bargained.

32
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,036
There are your spices.
Have your pick!

33
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,113
My things.

34
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,310
Stick to your profession.

35
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,034
Beware the genoese.
And shun the Devil.

36
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,638
The day may come, my friend

37
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,310
when you smile at fate
and she does not smile back

38
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,639
Should that day arrive, Harana,
I suspect you will be at my side.

39
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,835
I can see you've come
well prepared, Cristóbal Colón.

40
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,396
Monseñor Camos.

41
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,251
This is my son Diego.

42
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,956
Two monts ago I lost
my wife, Doña Felipa.

43
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,716
I'm sorry. I will pray for her soul.

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you Monseñor.

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,488
What I have to show you
has cost me 6 years

46
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,788
and most of what I own.

47
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,150
If your maps are
as convincing as your letters,

48
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,874
I will not only present
your idea to King John

49
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,957
I will support it.

50
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,228
For 5 years I have lived and sailed
out of Porto Santo, to Iceland

51
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,637
the Canaries, down the
coast of Africa to La Mina...

52
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,080
Señor Colón, this is our sea.

53
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,017
Portuguese captains
explored these waters

54
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,817
and have sailed them
more often than you.

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,468
But always near to land,
Your Grace

56
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,150
In the Azores, Colón found
a log carved with tools.

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,954
It had floated ashore,
from the west.

58
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,957
Your Highness, here's Cathay.

59
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,160
The great celestial cities
of Quinsay and Zaiton.

60
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,388
Then, 500 leagues into the sea,
Cipango and many other islands.

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,151
But all set in one great sea.

62
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,237
Marco Polo called it
an ocean sea.

63
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,956
Your sea...

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,796
Polo's sea.

65
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,872
The Earth is a sphere.

66
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,310
As Aristotle, Ptolemy
and all cosmographers tell us.

67
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,158
And it is my belief
your sea ends in Polo's.

68
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,239
They are in fact the same sea.

69
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,799
And the best way
to reach the Indies

70
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,658
is not through the Turks,
or Constantinople.

71
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,058
It is not
around the coast of Africa

72
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,718
as Your Highness seeks.

73
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,959
But it is by sailing west,
across the one ocean sea.

74
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,957
It's a very ambitious plan,
Señor Colón.

75
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:55,410
I have further proofs

76
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:57,953
and many details for the workings
of the voyage, Your Highness.

77
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,796
Good. Very good.

78
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,390
If we were to take the risk
of supplying the required ships,

79
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,318
what fee would you expect?

80
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,200
I am to be named Governor,

81
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,829
under Your Highness,
of all lands discovered.

82
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,229
I and my heirs
are to have 1/10th

83
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,793
of all revenue from
portuguese trade with the Indies.

84
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,396
No Portuguese captain
ever received a fraction of that.

85
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,915
No Portuguese captain has
yet taken your ships to the Indies.

86
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,250
Perhaps Your Highness would
care to consider it, in Counsel.

87
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,957
Yes.

88
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,389
You're a very unusual man,
Señor Colón.

89
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,036
And it would honor me
if you'd remain

90
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,714
at home,
as it were, in my realm.

91
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,750
It would be my humble
pleasure, Your Highness,

92
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,151
to accomodate
Señor Colón at my estate.

93
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,475
Good suggestion,
Lord Guarco.

94
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,558
It is settled then.
Until the Counsel considers it.

95
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,158
We keep the maps.

96
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,793
To further consider it.

97
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,876
Spain's not far.
There we'll be safe.

98
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,238
Off you go, my son.

99
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,628
And now my friend, you fear it will be
a Portuguese who will be the first.

100
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,036
It's possible, but it will not
be an easy voyage.

101
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,033
Now I'm going to France.
I've written to the french King.

102
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,348
Have you not tried our Queen?

103
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,033
No.

104
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,356
Or King Ferdinand?

105
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,637
How would I ever get an audience?
Their minds and their money

106
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,135
are engaged with the Crusades
against the Moors.

107
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,556
Before Father Torquemada
became the Queen's confessor

108
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,990
our prior held that office.

109
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,558
He can get you an audience.

110
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,308
And the Duke de Medinaceli,

111
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,317
a man also in love
with cosmography,

112
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,034
he might be convinced
to put up part of the money.

113
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,500
If I can assure them
that I myself believe

114
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,631
your enormous ocean sea
could truly be sailed,

115
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,797
to go, and return.

116
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,874
There is one secret
I've told no one.

117
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,717
I will speak it to you,
but only in the confession.

118
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,878
where you are sworn,
before our Lord,

119
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,116
never to reveal it.

120
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,478
If it should be true...

121
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,389
The wealth may well be
beyond imagining. But the cost

122
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,955
would be considerable.

123
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,152
What exactly is your
background, Señor Colón?

124
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,635
I have served many
noble monarks, Your Highness.

125
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,559
The Prince of Anjou.

126
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,955
The King of Portugal.

127
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,952
Portugal!

128
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,720
Why did he not send you?

129
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,395
King John is still seeking
a route to the Indies

130
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,556
around Africa,
Your Highness.

131
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,953
If indeed
Africa has an end.

132
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:42,105
Yes.

133
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,874
And if he finds it

134
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,789
then Portugal would be the
greatest kingdom of all Europe.

135
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,150
For 700 years the Moors
have held power in Spain.

136
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,150
It's always been my dream,
should God give me the Crown of Castilla,

137
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,239
I might one day recapture all
of those domains for Christendom.

138
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,717
With the good
right arm of the Church,

139
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,238
and my husband's
bravery on the battlefield,

140
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,635
God may yet
grant me that dream.

141
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,955
And how much more
you dream, Señor Colón.

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,037
Take the words of the Gospel
to all of the Indies.

143
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,793
To Cathay.

144
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,238
To India,
to the unknown Cipango.

145
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,159
To do as our Lord
bid his apostles to do:

146
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,079
"Go into all of the World,
and preach my Word."

147
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,316
We must have our best
scholars and priests examine it.

148
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,555
In Genoa, of what rank
was your father?

149
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,879
My father was descended
from the Senator Galeotto de Mari

150
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,955
who founded
the Bank of Genoa.

151
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,475
If it would be...

152
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,554
If it would be...

153
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,476
I thank you for coming,
Señor Colón.

154
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,035
Sail with you again?

155
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,429
By every saint of the christian calendar,
Cristóbal, I would sail with you to Hell!

156
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,557
Diego de Harana

157
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,556
Here's to you!

158
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,228
I might even bring him back

159
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,637
if fate smiles on us.

160
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,875
Cousin Beatriz!

161
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,556
My maps!

162
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,316
Forgive her!

163
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,399
Which one of you
is Cristóbal Colón?

164
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:55,237
I am.

165
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:57,113
Come with us.
- No.

166
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:58,364
No, no.

167
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:00,907
There's nothing
to fear, I'm sure.

168
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:03,785
Señor Colón.

169
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,412
Thank you.

170
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,635
Your name?

171
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,396
Does the Queen know
I'm being questionned?

172
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,151
Until the case is brought before
the tribunal of the Holy Office,

173
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,033
all questionning is as secret
as in the confessional.

174
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,793
Your name?

175
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,398
Cristóbal Colón.

176
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,716
Do you take the sacrements?
- I do.

177
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,714
Do you know why
you were arrested?

178
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,316
It is beyond
my imagination.

179
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,796
The function
of the Inquisition

180
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,631
is to redeem the souls
of fallen Christians.

181
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,318
I am not
a fallen Christian.

182
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,557
Heresy, by its nature,
is insidious.

183
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,958
It infects many, who
presume that they're innocent.

184
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,118
But for the soul
who has gone away from God,

185
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,400
even perhaps
without knowing,

186
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,476
the way back is full of pain.

187
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,559
And the first step
is confession.

188
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,715
Torture.

189
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,558
Torture may lead one to confess
something that is not true.

190
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,309
Well, to be a true believer,
and unjustly condemned to death,

191
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,431
that is the way to glory.

192
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,476
To die for the Faith,
in the Faith

193
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,874
That soul will certainly see
the Gates of Paradise.

194
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,636
It is the goal I seek

195
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,319
but perhaps not that way.

196
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,877
May I know why
you doubt my faith?

197
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,950
I have...

198
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,796
been through my manuscripts.

199
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,870
The blessed Saint-Augustin has said
that the ocean sea cannot be crossed.

200
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,033
And in your ambition,
Señor Colón,

201
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,310
you are presuming to defy the judgment
of the Holy Father of the Church.

202
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,717
Not on the matter of the Faith, Your Grace.

203
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,478
The blessed Saint also wrote

204
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,148
that no men could exist
beyond the torrid zones of Africa,

205
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,555
because those men
would not descend from Adam.

206
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,239
Yet the Portuguese, and I,

207
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,398
have found men, and life,
where he said none could exist.

208
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,636
I defer to the Holy Father's
knowledge of Man's hearts.

209
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,229
His science
was imperfect.

210
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,149
Well. You appear
well-read, Señor Colón.

211
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,112
Only in cosmography,
Your Grace.

212
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,954
And the Bible.

213
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,468
I recall
our Blessed Lord said:

214
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,035
"A new commandment
I give unto you:

215
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,397
"That you love one another
as I have loved you."

216
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,793
Surely

217
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,390
it is not blasphemy to take that
message to the shores of Africa

218
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,555
or across the ocean sea.

219
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,876
I will never share the
noble standing of Diego's mother

220
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,877
You will
never marry me.

221
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,237
And if you succeed
on your voyage

222
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,718
you'll retire me to some distant estate
where I may hear of you now and then

223
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,636
Perhaps
you'll never return

224
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,158
And I shall be
empty inside forever

225
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,389
It may be that
I cannot marry you

226
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,876
but I do love you.

227
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,555
And you'll always
be at my side.

228
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,001
Cristóbal.

229
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:25,668
Cristóbal.

230
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,553
We must go.

231
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,149
Why?

232
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,250
The commission have
announced they've reached

233
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,877
the final stages
of deliberation.

234
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,050
Cristóbal!

235
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,149
I haven't
told you my news!

236
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,798
I must go.
I have to be there.

237
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,396
I'm going
to have your child.

238
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,274
The Queen has left
to lay siege to Malaga.

239
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,718
Father Torquemada convened
the commision in her absence.

240
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,119
It is the commission's opinion
that your arguments

241
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,108
do not outweigh the conclusions of the
great doctors of the Church that say

242
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,390
the ocean sea
may not be crossed.

243
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,876
But Your Grace...

244
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,559
The decision is final!

245
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,036
I thank Your Graces.

246
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,115
One third of your population
will be sent to Maroc

247
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,788
in exchange for the
Christian slaves held there.

248
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,469
One third we will sell to
reimburse our treasury

249
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:45,097
and one third
will be given in slavery

250
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:47,806
to Rome and Naples for
their support of the Crusades.

251
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,637
Your Highnesses,
Señor Colón.

252
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,031
When I heard of your
victory, Your Highnesses,

253
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,639
I was moved to thoughts
of the glory of Spain.

254
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,557
Which of course prompted you
to thoughts of you dubious quest.

255
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,275
Of course, Your Highness.

256
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,469
Father Torquemada
and I have...

257
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,628
discussed the new evidence, as
you have found from the Old Testament,

258
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,389
that our world is largely land,
and therefore the ocean sea

259
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,478
cannot be as great
as our scholars presume.

260
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,550
These are from the Apocrypha.
Doubtful sources, but...

261
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,273
not to be ignored.

262
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,037
We might reconvene
the commission.

263
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,278
I have received an envoy from Portugal.
One I have reason to call a friend.

264
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,195
He tells me the King

265
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,795
sent a strong ship
from the Azores on a voyage of

266
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,115
discovery.

267
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,390
Such as you
recommended to him.

268
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,101
This most experienced
captain sailed for weeks

269
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,020
and found nothing.

270
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,038
Save immeasurable
rough sea.

271
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,117
He returned to Lisbon,
thanking God for preserving his life,

272
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,275
and laughing

273
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,798
at the idea that by such a course
the Indies could be found.

274
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,479
Fortunately for Spain,
Your Highness,

275
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,796
I did not tell
the Portuguese King all.

276
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,959
Ah, yes. This is
the famous secret.

277
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,876
Yes, my Lord.

278
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,355
And it is still not something
you care to share with us?

279
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,275
I still cannot.

280
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,500
I defer you
to my Queen.

281
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:33,003
Your Highness.

282
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,926
Make clear the court.

283
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:44,761
Clear the court.

284
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,874
Father,

285
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,955
would you leave us,
please?

286
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,237
Señor Colón

287
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,550
I feel our commission
may have been

288
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,716
over-zealous.

289
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,718
I want you to know
that you and your dream

290
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,354
have often been in my
prayers these past two years.

291
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,119
then some of my prayers have
been answered, Your Highness.

292
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,912
We are hard-pressed for treasure.

293
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,031
The Moors still hold
the Fortress of Granada

294
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,196
and they wait
reinforcement from Maroc.

295
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:39,673
But I would like to
grant you a small allowance.

296
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,675
You might continue
in your preparations.

297
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,470
I am grateful
to Your Highness.

298
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,557
Diego.

299
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,273
Why don't you
lend your father a hand?

300
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,559
I watch him do it.

301
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,558
Don't you ever
want to learn to sail?

302
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:11,736
I'll sail! I'll sail!
- Fernando, sit down.

303
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,613
I'll take care of it.

304
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,035
I was hoping to take you
as an apprentice when I sail.

305
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,118
I'll be too old by the time
you get a ship, Father.

306
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:29,707
Let me tell
you something!

307
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,419
Too old? Too old?

308
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:37,837
Out!

309
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:02,896
Look, it's him! The man
who wants to sail without a ship!

310
00:25:03,188 --> 00:25:05,814
It's him! The man who
wants to sail without a ship!

311
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,400
The man who wants
to sail without a ship!

312
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:11,443
It's him! The man who
wants to sail without a ship!

313
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,363
It's him! The man who
wants to sail without a ship!

314
00:25:26,703 --> 00:25:28,247
Cristóbal.

315
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,164
Cristóbal.

316
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:32,791
No.

317
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,468
Oh Lord, why have you
forsaken me? Why?

318
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,520
Because it's spring,
you'll get south-eastern winds,

319
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,354
so I've marked
the shores in red.

320
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,549
Stay well off as you approach,
or you'll get driven unto them

321
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,354
You're not not
much of an artist

322
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,559
but you are
a seaman, Colón.

323
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,275
If you ever come to your
senses about the Indies,

324
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,278
I'll make a place for you
on one of my ships.

325
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,674
My brother is at the
English court right now.

326
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,149
I'm not giving up.

327
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,832
Maybe I'll just get
Isaac to dismiss you.

328
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,662
I cannot dismiss him,
he owes me too much money.

329
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,330
Well then

330
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,790
perhaps this will help.
- Thank you.

331
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,956
Friar Juan has some news
about the Inquisition.

332
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,275
About me?

333
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,710
No, but I fear
it may touch you.

334
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,197
Why would it affect me?
- Because you work for a Jew.

335
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:53,512
This message is being
distributed to be read at all masses

336
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,264
this 4th sunday of Advent.

337
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,711
It is ordered that all Jews
will be expelled from Spain

338
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,549
unless they can accept baptism
and conversion to the Holy Faith.

339
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,197
Our edicts stress that
they prefer us to make converts.

340
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,355
They want you to stay.

341
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,115
What they want is to confiscate
their wealth to appease the population.

342
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,357
But all those who continue
the old practices in secret

343
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,113
will be labelled heretics

344
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,351
and could be
put to death at the stake.

345
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,197
They, and all those
who help them.

346
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,639
This is my home.

347
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,434
It's all I have.
I must stay.

348
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,115
No, I cannot do it.

349
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,357
You have to sell everything,
and you will get nothing for it.

350
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,273
I still cannot do it.

351
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,113
How about
you, Benjamin?

352
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,795
Where is Colón?

353
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,992
I bring news
from the Queen!

354
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,559
The Moors surrendered.

355
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,875
Spain is Christian!

356
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,276
You are the first to benefit.

357
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:02,952
Go.

358
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,070
Like friar Juan Perez,
I've always believed you were

359
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,953
a child of God.
I'm glad for you.

360
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,628
Go.

361
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,956
Allah Akbar.

362
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,635
God is great.

363
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,479
Yes.

364
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,800
He's given Spain to His Son
in answer to the prayers

365
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,035
of a young girl.

366
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,953
God is great

367
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,959
and our debt to Him is infinite.

368
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,874
Señor Colón.

369
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,877
You look splendid!

370
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,858
I am honoured Your Highness would
think of me in her moment of triumph.

371
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,958
In my debt to God,

372
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,276
I intend to carry
his Word to the Indies.

373
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,092
If I must pawn my own
crown jewels to do so!

374
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,276
As master of this enterprise,
what rewards

375
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,710
do you expect,
Señor Colón?

376
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,557
I am to be titled admiral of the ocean sea

377
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,500
and viceroy of all
islands and continents

378
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,275
discovered or conquered
through my efforts

379
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,558
These offices and
the title "Don Cristóbal Colón"

380
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,671
shall pass to my heirs
and successors forever.

381
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,556
In addition...
- There is more?

382
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,630
1/10th of all goods acquired from
these dominions will belong to me.

383
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,635
Free of taxation.

384
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,115
Until now, I questionned
your mathematics, Señor Colón

385
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,389
but I see that
was a mistake.

386
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,958
I will give
half of my share

387
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,593
to support,
with Your Highnesses,

388
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,109
a Crusade to free
the Holy Land of the Turks

389
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,957
How generous of you.
Modify your requests.

390
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,468
We all know
your condition.

391
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,478
Your Highness.

392
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,274
If I fail,
I get nothing.

393
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,358
If France, or Genoa
or Venice takes my offer

394
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,556
and I succeed

395
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,595
their kingdoms will know
wealth and power beyond...

396
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,199
Go to France!

397
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,197
Go to Genoa.

398
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,359
but don't utter threats
in my presence again.

399
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,878
Cristóbal.

400
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,273
Modify your requests.

401
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,958
Your Highness,
I cannot.

402
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,593
You have a way
with women, Colón.

403
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,116
I'm from Genoa,
Your Ladyship.

404
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,114
I believe you will
find the Indies.

405
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,470
And as God has
given me my dream

406
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,559
I intend to
give you yours.

407
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,957
I know it will be
a strength to me

408
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,549
in the many times
I will need strength.

409
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,628
I too have had
only my pride

410
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,195
and my faith in God
to light my way.

411
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,356
God go with you,
Don Cristóbal Colón.

412
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,355
Colón, it's the
greatest ship in the world!

413
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,114
Call me "captain general".

414
00:32:10,435 --> 00:32:12,312
What do you think,
Señor De La Cosa?

415
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:14,563
Will you go on
this insane voyage?

416
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,436
The Queen may have ordered me
to lease my ship to Colón

417
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,114
but not even she can
force me to sail with him.

418
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,355
Oh, Pinzon!

419
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,357
I have three ships,
I have no crew!

420
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,353
I could use your influence.
Sail with me!

421
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,639
Into uncharted seas,
with a genoese mapmaker

422
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,068
who's not sailed
for 6 years?

423
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,196
Keep dreaming,
Colón!

424
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,637
She's a fine vessel.

425
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,957
Perhaps a bit top-heavy
and too narrow of beam.

426
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,720
Not unlike
someone else I know.

427
00:33:01,261 --> 00:33:02,304
No.

428
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,479
Cristóbal, the children...

429
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,353
The children are busy
with their own play.

430
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,038
But cousin Harana
and señor De La Cosa...

431
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,798
are also busy.

432
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,115
I don't believe
you're serious, Cristóbal.

433
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,035
When I am
1000 leagues from land,

434
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,469
and I look
at these walls

435
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,355
I'll see you.

436
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:10,683
No wonder you could talk a Queen
into parting with her jewellery.

437
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:26,361
I'll make you
remember me, Cristóbal.

438
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,957
20.000 maravedis!

439
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,711
20.000 maravedis to the man
who can make an egg stand upright.

440
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,352
As if we had
nothing better to do.

441
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,116
It's impossible.

442
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,470
A waste of time.

443
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,750
Let Colón
try himself.

444
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,910
Let's see
him do it.

445
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,150
A cheat!

446
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,952
He never told us
we could crack the egg!

447
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,675
I never said the eggshell
couldn't be cracked.

448
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,753
No one thought of it,
or dared to try.

449
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,274
He's trying to
make fools of us.

450
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,712
It's ignorance and lack of courage
which makes fools of men.

451
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,594
Listen to me!

452
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,019
I tell you that a
well-disciplined ship

453
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,789
can make
this voyage!

454
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,436
Cheap little trick.

455
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,869
It proves nothing
about the sea of darkness!

456
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,593
A sea so broad

457
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,950
even if Cathay
were on the other side,

458
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,675
no man would
live to see it.

459
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,233
He knows what
he's saying, Colón.

460
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,516
Listen to him.

461
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,193
Let the man speak!

462
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,195
The world is round.
Correct?

463
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,188
Where I stand, it will be
the beginning and the end.

464
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,790
0 degrees, and 360 degrees.

465
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,033
Where Martin stands, 90 degrees.

466
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,880
De La Cosa, half the globe:

467
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,116
180 degrees.

468
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,196
Vicente, 3/4
of the globe.

469
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,876
270 degrees.
Can you follow that?

470
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,875
Don't insult
me, Cristóbal.

471
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,314
the length of Europe
and Asia to the tip

472
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,158
of Cathay is roughly

473
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,078
260 degrees.

474
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,312
So this is Cathay.

475
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,594
Remember Marco Polo
made this trip.

476
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,070
And he made
measurements every month.

477
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,278
Beyond Cathay
is Cipango.

478
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,789
Let's say
28 or 30 degrees.

479
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,069
Polo never
saw Cipango.

480
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,117
No, but he had the
word of chinese sea captains.

481
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,198
So we can't be sure.

482
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,679
The ocean sea
is 70 degrees of the world.

483
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,799
There are
45 miles to a degree, so

484
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,436
it is 3000 miles
from Palos to Cipango, and

485
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,199
2400 miles
from the Canaries.

486
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,958
A well-provided

487
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,674
a well-disciplined ship

488
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,273
can make that.

489
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,879
What if your figures

490
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,670
are wrong?

491
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,592
They are not wrong.

492
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,355
Would you sail
with him, friar Juan?

493
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,796
Alas, that is not possible.

494
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,117
But if it were

495
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,868
there is no power on this Earth,
save for the Holy Father

496
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,756
would keep me from
making this voyage of discovery.

497
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,789
Wait.

498
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,638
What about you, Vicente?

499
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:20,227
I think I shall
tell my grandchildren

500
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:22,812
that I sailed
the ocean sea.

501
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,791
Why should a sailor
loaf about in Palos

502
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,516
when he could
find houses of gold

503
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,076
and scarves of silk
for his ladies?

504
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,516
Wine for everyone!

505
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,117
Terreros! We need
a good carpenter.

506
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,517
Make your sign, draw half your wages.
Your family will live like royalty

507
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,790
while you're dancing
with the chinese ladies.

508
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,198
Dancing with the Devil
is what I fear, captain.

509
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
But with you

510
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:17,766
I may curse my luck
that I never went.

511
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,672
I'm with you, Sir.

512
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,638
I want to see

513
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,871
the Celestial City.

514
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,518
The talk of Marco Polo
has turned your head, Bartolomé.

515
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,678
The Lord God
will give me courage.

516
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,470
It is His Will that
I should make this journey.

517
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,913
You will piss your pants
the first time we lose sight of land!

518
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,273
How short will we be?

519
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,069
Perhaps 20.

520
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,198
I'd rather take a willing coward
than an unwilling criminal.

521
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,119
We'll have to take enough
of those as it is. Sign him.

522
00:39:58,335 --> 00:39:59,460
Alright, Bives.

523
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:01,879
Sign your life away.

524
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,195
Gonzalo.

525
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,194
Seaman.

526
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,200
This is a waste of time.

527
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,147
Well, we have
no choice, Harana.

528
00:40:29,814 --> 00:40:31,274
8 men have deserted already.

529
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,949
There's not a man here
who'd survive the voyage.

530
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,958
A man can survive here,
he can survive anywhere.

531
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,796
You know my mission.

532
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,598
The Queen has offered pardon
to all those who sail with me.

533
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,512
I want volunteers.

534
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,434
What is your crime?

535
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,671
Murder.
- You are modest, Roldan.

536
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,593
Rape, and murder.

537
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,598
I'm fit, strong and able.

538
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,116
If it would buy
me my freedom,

539
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,193
I would sail to the end
of the Earth with you, Colón.

540
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,800
That's exactly
what we may be doing.

541
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,675
What about you?

542
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,117
I'd rather live like a rat
than drown like one!

543
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,039
We could use a tailor.
We'll be trading for silk

544
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,199
and precious linen,
and gold thread.

545
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,517
It's another gift from the Queen
for the captain general.

546
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,439
Rodrigo de Escobedo.
At your service.

547
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,596
A secretary.
He'll record our discoveries.

548
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,273
Rodrigo Sanchez.

549
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,469
From the treasury.

550
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,353
To test the gold
we trade for.

551
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,231
Luis de Torres.
- renowned interpret.

552
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,355
He speaks all the
languages of the known world.

553
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,353
We could use you.

554
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,435
Alvaro de Harana.

555
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,791
Volunteer. From the court
of the Duke of Medinaceli.

556
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,195
Father.

557
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,956
Bring their effects aboard!

558
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,879
You said 10.000 maravedis.

559
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,674
5 now, 5 after the voyage.

560
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,310
Provided Colón fails,
or better yet, never returns.

561
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,754
Portugal does not want Spain
to succeed in this voyage.

562
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,115
What if you never
return, Gonzalo?

563
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,800
How does a pardoned convict
to get the rest of his money

564
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,108
from the court of Portugal?

565
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,590
They'll know who you are.

566
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,276
My father said that you would
guarantee my life, when we return.

567
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,068
Benjamin, I swear
on my eternal soul

568
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,999
that before
they take you life,

569
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,031
they will have
to take mine, too.

570
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,037
Even if I do
not take the Faith?

571
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,277
I know where your heart is.

572
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,595
Stay at the back of the crew,
at prayers. Only I will see you.

573
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,117
God go with you, Cristóbal.

574
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,039
I'm depending on it.

575
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,028
Diego, look after your
brother while I'm away.

576
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,515
Come here.

577
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,790
Goodbye. - Goodbye.
- I love you.

578
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,516
Captain.

579
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,439
What is it between
Harana and his son?

580
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,278
He seduced my sister
when she was 14.

581
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,437
When she was with child,
Alvaro repudiated her

582
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,517
calling her a whore.

583
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,034
She drowned herself.

584
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,755
Your families have lived here
for more than 3 centuries.

585
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,277
The Church, the Queen,
beg you to remain.

586
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,035
And all that is asked

587
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,789
was that you joined
with us. One nation.

588
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,275
One Faith.

589
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,279
Then, may your voyage
have the favor of God's blessing.

590
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,432
And yours too.

591
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,798
I have made Spain one,
in all things.

592
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,274
And yet in the eyes of the Queen

593
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,756
my victory may
be obscured by this

594
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,597
Genoese foreigner. As God
is just, I suspect that he will

595
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,791
never return.

596
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,197
Believe me, Spain will still be
true to one Faith

597
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,149
when his little voyage
is long forgotten.

598
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,199
You sail south, captain general?

599
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,789
Into the heat?

600
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,753
We'll take on fresh water
and provisions in the Canaries.

601
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,879
Have you ever sailed
into the ocean sea, Alvaro?

602
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,151
No, Sir. I'm only an adventurer.
The sailor is my father.

603
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,789
Alvaro.

604
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,040
I am master at arms
aboard this ship.

605
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,189
Refer to me as anything else,
and I'll put you in chains.

606
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,800
Now you know why
I volunteered for this voyage.

607
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,470
I wish to redeem myself
with my father.

608
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,799
You have quite a task
ahead of you.

609
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,199
You should be grateful you have a father.
I, Gonzalo, cannot say the same.

610
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,792
I swear to God only one of us
will live to return to Spain.

611
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,350
Bring those buckets!

612
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,797
All hands to the pumps!
- Release the sheet!

613
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,197
Let the wind slip!
Keep bailing, men!

614
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,232
Stay ahead of the flood!

615
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,835
One of the rope
of the helm's been cut.

616
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,959
We've sprung a leak
below the waterline.

617
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,516
Looks like someone
took a hammer at Palos.

618
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,517
Do you have
one clue who did it?

619
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,470
The crew are muttering it was one
of the two convicts, but they deny it.

620
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,833
Drag one, send the
other one on the yardarm!

621
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,871
There's no proof, Cristóbal.

622
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,117
We don't know it's them.
The men will think it's crazy!

623
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,676
I want them used to taking my
orders, whether they think them

624
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,592
crazy or not!

625
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,437
Treachery threatens
us all, captain!

626
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,755
This voyage demands discipline.
And discipline we will have!

627
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,675
Señor De La Cosa, set the topsail.
Tighten the sheets and tacks.

628
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,350
We've lost enough
time already.

629
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,789
Set the topsail!

630
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:10,166
Tighten the
sheets and tacks!

631
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,960
Tighten the sheets!

632
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,799
The pauper who
becomes captain general.

633
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,516
He will learn the loyalty
of men cannot be taken.

634
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,069
It must be won.

635
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,036
Well, he needed a good wash.

636
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,108
Not many have sailed
this far into the ocean sea.

637
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,676
I was twice your age before
I sailed one night west from the Canaries.

638
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,958
And at dawn, I had to turn back
or the crew would have mutinied.

639
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,956
What is out there?

640
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,114
Find a place to sleep.

641
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,118
The day begins
early tomorrow.

642
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,197
Yes, captain general.

643
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,470
Five is passed

644
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,275
and six flows. More
shall flow if God wills.

645
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,277
Who gave Pinzon the order
to let that man down?

646
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,356
I did!

647
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,790
Get up!

648
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,035
This is our man.

649
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,038
I found him in
the hull, using this.

650
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,753
He cut a hole, just
like in the Pinta.

651
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,754
Portuguese.

652
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,958
Are you alone,
or are they others?

653
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,358
After a day or two of sun,
he'll be telling us all he knows.

654
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,753
Master at arms.

655
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,200
Show the man how
we deal with traitors.

656
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,183
Pedro.
- Captain, look out!

657
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:19,185
Lash him to the mast!

658
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,200
Terreros, get below
and report the damage!

659
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,789
The rest of you,
back to work!

660
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,798
Below!

661
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,115
Below!

662
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,693
Wreckage!

663
00:53:55,093 --> 00:53:56,002
Wreckage!

664
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,151
"Because he loves me, says
the Lord, I will rescue him

665
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,673
"I will protect him, because
he acknowledges my name.

666
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,390
"He will call upon me and I will
answer. I will be with him in trouble

667
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,038
I will deliver him
and honor him."

668
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,356
It may be the
mast of an indian ship

669
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,675
or a chinese junk.

670
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,831
Aye. Or a piece of Noah's Ark!

671
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,789
The ship that need
that broken mast we saw,

672
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,558
what do you think
happened to them?

673
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,715
Morales!

674
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,433
A venitian once told me

675
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,875
they saw a sea demon
off the Azores

676
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,035
big enough to
swallow a ship whole.

677
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,875
All my life, I've
been chasing the Sun.

678
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,198
And at last I feel
I'm going to catch it!

679
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,674
How many miles
are we making?

680
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,989
We must be doing 7 or 8.

681
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,599
That is our secret.

682
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,872
In my log I'm recording less.
Every hour further from Spain,

683
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,550
more and more of the crew begin to wish
they'd never heard the name "Colón"

684
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,113
Beware Sanchez!

685
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:21,142
Come on!

686
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:22,643
Come on!

687
00:56:23,185 --> 00:56:25,895
Halt those men!
- Enough!

688
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,433
I'll discipline the next man

689
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,636
Who breaks the
order of this ship!

690
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,070
Terreros, take him down.

691
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,629
Jesus said: "I am the
Resurrection and the Life

692
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,799
"He who believes in me
will live even though he dies

693
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,199
"and whoever lives and
believes in me will never die."

694
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,100
No!

695
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,994
We musn't go on!
- He's mad!

696
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,718
He'll kill us all!

697
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,415
Cut him down!
- No! Leave him!

698
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,116
Turn this ship back!

699
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,558
We must go back!

700
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,954
Cut that, Morales!

701
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,799
Turn us around,
captain general!

702
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,880
We will never live to
see the land in the west!

703
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,889
You will live, Morales!
You will live!

704
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,789
You may even
live to be rich!

705
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,354
Listen...

706
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,194
Listen to me,
all of you!

707
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,436
The first man
among you to sight land

708
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,955
will earn himself
a life's pension

709
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,628
of 10.000 maravedis
a year, from the King!

710
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,513
10.000 maravedis.

711
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,353
Terreros, Alvaro!

712
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,629
The rest of you,
get back to your work!

713
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,629
10.000 maravedis!

714
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,515
Ferdinand will be amazed
by his own generosity.

715
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,513
Look at them, Harana.

716
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,116
How the promise of gold
makes them put away their fear.

717
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,515
At least of the present.

718
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,629
What is it?
What is he seeing?

719
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,550
He has the look
of a man possessed.

720
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,797
Set course due west!

721
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,869
Square the yards!
And sail on full and by!

722
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,033
How does he always know?

723
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,195
It is his gift.

724
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,432
Get back to your station.

725
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,035
Square the yardarm!

726
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,798
Set the mainsail!

727
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,433
Haul halyard on
the starboard side!

728
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,559
It's not just about how
far we've gone, Cristóbal.

729
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,320
It's this bitch of a wind
that's always out the east.

730
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,954
It will take months
to beat our way back

731
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,877
Tomorrow we may find head winds
again, and you still won't be content.

732
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,435
I've never heard men
frown so much at good fortune!

733
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,549
Vicente.

734
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,352
Don't you want to go back?

735
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,433
You still think he will find
anything but his maker out there?

736
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,519
De Torres, he'll take us all
to Hell. That's what he'll do.

737
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,358
Hello boy.
- I have to holler the next watch!

738
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,868
What happened?
- Nothing captain, I fell.

739
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,354
It was Roldan,
wasn't it?

740
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,869
Land!

741
01:02:18,992 --> 01:02:20,051
I've sighted land!

742
01:02:21,676 --> 01:02:22,886
I've sighted land!

743
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:26,745
I claim the King's reward!

744
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,198
Well, the man
knows his winds after all.

745
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,909
He'll be everyone's hero
when he gets back to Spain.

746
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,031
If he gets back to Spain.

747
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,035
If any of us do.

748
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,035
Captain!

749
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,116
Quiet!

750
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,034
It's a cloud!

751
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,876
It's just a cloud.

752
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,357
It's breaking up!

753
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,550
There's nothing out there.

754
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,869
We sail to nothing
but our death.

755
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,548
We will die for the
greed of a genoese!

756
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,196
Get back to
your work, Morales.

757
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,630
If the men see him
like this, they'll lose faith.

758
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,274
You said my Faith
would light my way

759
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,550
yet all I see before me
is a sea of darkness.

760
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,117
Why, Your Highness?
Why has God forsaken me, why?

761
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,435
They seized the ship.

762
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,035
They're coming for you.

763
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,116
Them I shall greet them.

764
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,358
I hold the
Queen's commission!

765
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,118
Mutiny

766
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,470
Mutiny is punishable by death!

767
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,436
If I cannot
execute this sentence here,

768
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,194
I can assure you
that it will be done in Spain!

769
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,958
You also have a
commisson from God.

770
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,548
To protect the
lives of your crew.

771
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,628
Captain. I will not sacrifice
myself for a madman's vanity.

772
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,955
I beseek you,
Colón! Turn back!

773
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,353
And you may remain
captain general.

774
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,877
You have no other choice.

775
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,797
You have given me
much to think about.

776
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,789
But first, I must
talk to my captains.

777
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,957
Master at arms.

778
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,875
Ask to Pinzon
to join us tonight

779
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,953
in my cabin.

780
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,810
You heared
what he said.

781
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,229
Get back to
your duties.

782
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,356
To the commencement
of our return to Spain.

783
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,756
To Spain.

784
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,552
Gentlemen, for the past 32 days,
I have kept you informed of our progress.

785
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,629
I told you we have sailed over
1754 miles west of the Canaries.

786
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,196
I lied.

787
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,198
I lied in order
not to scare our men.

788
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,232
In fact, we have
travelled over 2379 miles.

789
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,558
What say you now,
good captains?

790
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,557
We may reach Hell
before we reach the Indies!

791
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,354
We must turn back
or suffer the consequences.

792
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,353
A reward from the King
will no longer suffice, Colón.

793
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,356
The men talk of thowing you to
the sharks if you don't listen to reason.

794
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,876
3 days.

795
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,118
Tell the men we sail west
for 3 more days.

796
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,950
If we don't sight land
on the morning of the 4th day

797
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,119
you must give the order
to turn the ships around.

798
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,275
On that morning,

799
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,471
if we don't sight land,
I will give the order...

800
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,797
for my head
to roll on the deck!

801
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,195
I make this oath,
in the Name of Our Lord.

802
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,277
That is how you will
appease your men

803
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,593
Isabella will
have our heads!

804
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,993
It is your sworn duty to
obey your captain general.

805
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,350
The order will be
written by my own hand.

806
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,436
And I will entrust
it to you, Pinzon.

807
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,719
I will take it.

808
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,879
Birds!

809
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,273
Birds!

810
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,877
It means we must be near land!
- Birds that live on the sea, perhaps.

811
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,133
Who knows what strange
things this ocean holds.

812
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,433
It's a sign.

813
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,071
Surely, it's a sign.

814
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,199
This is a sure
sign of land!

815
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,636
No birds today.
- No.

816
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,718
Have we sailed
past the landfall?

817
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,079
According to the maps
your father and I made,

818
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,279
well past it.

819
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,353
Could you
be wrong?

820
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,437
I may have calculated
the degrees too short.

821
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,957
But Cathay
must be close.

822
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,435
We took a sounding.

823
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,115
200 fathoms.

824
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:51,875
We didn't touch bottom.

825
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,433
Lord give us a good night.

826
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,956
Candle pass, and
make voyage fast.

827
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:30,831
Master at arms!

828
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,754
The Pinta! The watch!

829
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,428
Do you see it?
- See what?

830
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,796
Yes! Yes!
A light!

831
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,512
It looks like somebody's
signaling, with a lantern.

832
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,876
La Niña?

833
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,356
Do you see it?
- No! Which direction?

834
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,949
Aft the port bow!

835
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,115
Where? I cannot see it!
- Gone.

836
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,874
But it was there.

837
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,113
It was there!

838
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,872
It's the Devil.
God save us!

839
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,195
God have
mercy on us all!

840
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,956
Not the Devil, Bives!
Saint Elmo's fire!

841
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,879
Saint Elmo, the
patron saint of sailors.

842
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,433
Has anyone seen Benjamin?
He can't miss this!

843
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:48,210
Hello, boy.
- No!

844
01:12:50,294 --> 01:12:51,587
I'm gonna
show you something.

845
01:12:56,174 --> 01:12:57,215
Wait!

846
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,722
Shark!

847
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,822
No, let me go!
Let me go down to him!

848
01:13:36,633 --> 01:13:37,869
Give me your hand!

849
01:13:39,828 --> 01:13:41,371
Don't let him go!

850
01:13:42,746 --> 01:13:44,206
Don't let him go!

851
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,879
Saint Elmo was
watching over you tonight.

852
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,960
You must be
a true sailor.

853
01:15:26,692 --> 01:15:28,151
Cristóbal

854
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,868
Do not look so
grim, my friend.

855
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,953
It was always my
wish to die at sea.

856
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,719
For our friend Pinzon.

857
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,355
Let's be quick about this.

858
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,119
You own the
ship, De La Cosa.

859
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:28,875
No, I cannot.

860
01:16:31,027 --> 01:16:31,986
No.

861
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,715
I'll do it.

862
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:41,618
"With you, there is forgiveness,
therefore you are feared.

863
01:16:43,535 --> 01:16:44,995
"I wait for the Lord.

864
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,556
"My soul waits for the Lord.

865
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,118
"And in His word,
I put my hope

866
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,798
"and my soul
waits for the Lord

867
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,719
"more than watchmen

868
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,558
wait for the morning."

869
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,115
Wait!

870
01:17:23,896 --> 01:17:25,147
Vicente

871
01:17:25,397 --> 01:17:27,549
Get back to the Niña!
- Aye!

872
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:28,941
De La Cosa,
man the foresail!

873
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:33,431
Damn his winds! First we finish him
then we sail back to Spain!

874
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,114
We're seamen

875
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,435
not executioners!

876
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:54,792
Land! Land ho!

877
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,278
I, Rodrigo De La Triana

878
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,277
claim the King's reward

879
01:18:02,047 --> 01:18:04,215
Land! Land!

880
01:18:05,174 --> 01:18:06,425
I see land!

881
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,511
Land! Land!

882
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,037
Thank God.
Thank Saint Elmo

883
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,437
Thank all the angels
and the saints.

884
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,354
For God and Spain.

885
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,356
So where do you think
we are, captain general?

886
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,557
We have landed in
the Indies, my friend.

887
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,718
My title is now
"admiral of the ocean sea"

888
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,955
This must be one of
the islands of Cipango.

889
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,275
Bring the men ashore.

890
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,958
Let their feet touch the ground.
- Aye, captain.

891
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,038
Admiral.

892
01:21:12,176 --> 01:21:16,386
Ricardo, bring the men to land!
- Aye aye, captain.

893
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,435
Master at arms!

894
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,113
Guard company!

895
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,275
Wait!

896
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,718
They don't look like
chinamen, Cristóbal.

897
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,548
Marco Polo said there were
over 7000 islands of Cathay.

898
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,955
This must be one
of the outer Indies.

899
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,955
I hope so.

900
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,948
They think we're gods.

901
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,549
As in Africa,
and all new lands,

902
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,789
the gods have a duty.

903
01:23:32,896 --> 01:23:34,772
Since no one has come
forward to oppose us,

904
01:23:35,397 --> 01:23:38,775
I hereby claim this land in the
name of our glorious King and Queen

905
01:23:39,025 --> 01:23:41,152
Ferdinand and
Isabella of Spain.

906
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,435
And in honor of our Savior,
who has led us to it,

907
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,868
I name it San Salvador.

908
01:23:54,327 --> 01:23:55,619
Amén.

909
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,121
Amén.

910
01:24:24,889 --> 01:24:26,599
Stand clear!

911
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:34,549
Tell them we want
to meet their mayor.

912
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,357
and ask them if they are
subjects of the Great Khan.

913
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,955
For God's sake,
de Torres!

914
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,399
They don't speak any language!
- Of course they speak a language.

915
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,511
Well, it's not a
civilized language.

916
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,558
If the Portuguese can
talk with the Africans,

917
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,955
the Spanish will
talk with the Indians!

918
01:25:36,271 --> 01:25:38,956
And now, De Torres, you
start learning their language.

919
01:25:39,064 --> 01:25:40,315
Admiral!

920
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,273
Look at his nose.

921
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,911
What? It's an ornament.

922
01:25:57,952 --> 01:25:59,661
Sanchez?
- Yes, admiral.

923
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,512
Stop picking at him!

924
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,273
You're frightening him.

925
01:26:28,015 --> 01:26:29,348
It's gold.
- Gold!

926
01:26:34,352 --> 01:26:35,394
Gold!

927
01:26:57,034 --> 01:26:59,119
Vicente?
- Yes, admiral.

928
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,959
Your brother
deserted last night.

929
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,820
Sanchez said there were
rivers of gold on the other islands.

930
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,717
Martin must have gone there.

931
01:27:06,523 --> 01:27:08,575
Or perhaps your brother
has sailed to Spain

932
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:10,418
to claim my glory
and my rewards.

933
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,199
No, admiral, no! Such a
thing he would never do.

934
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,558
Oh no?

935
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,949
The chief's daughter,
admiral.

936
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,549
From the neighboring island.

937
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,436
Tell her I gladly
accept her offering.

938
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,035
And that in return

939
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,720
I give her what
my Queen gave me.

940
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,487
This represents
the enlightenment

941
01:27:50,779 --> 01:27:53,614
that our Faith has
to offer to your people.

942
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,117
Tell her...

943
01:28:04,288 --> 01:28:06,081
that now we will
sail to her island

944
01:28:07,207 --> 01:28:09,082
where I would like
her and her father

945
01:28:09,233 --> 01:28:10,584
to be my guests for dinner.

946
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,274
Explain that...

947
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,358
tomorrow is the
Birthday of our Savior.

948
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,149
and that tonight,
we celebrate in joy.

949
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,796
Prepare the ships
for departure!

950
01:29:31,805 --> 01:29:32,847
De Torres.

951
01:29:41,395 --> 01:29:42,563
This is very good.

952
01:29:46,941 --> 01:29:48,150
Feliz Navidad.

953
01:29:50,068 --> 01:29:51,152
Feliz Navidad.

954
01:29:52,777 --> 01:29:53,820
Wine.

955
01:30:18,754 --> 01:30:19,796
"Hichichi".

956
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:26,967
"Hichichi" from us to you.

957
01:30:27,927 --> 01:30:29,136
"Hichichi".

958
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,209
It's very sharp.
You have...

959
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,117
Spanish blade.

960
01:31:10,956 --> 01:31:12,415
Hey, look!

961
01:31:12,915 --> 01:31:14,125
The Santa María.

962
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,199
The safety of the Santa Maria
was your responsability, Colón.

963
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,435
It is you I blame.

964
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,313
And it is I you obey,
De La Cosa!

965
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,559
Help salvage
what we can.

966
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,352
God help you

967
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,553
when you tell the men why so
many of them must remain behind.

968
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,710
It was God's divine will that
the Santa Maria go aground here

969
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,436
Providence has
chosen this site

970
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,109
for the first permanent
Christian settlement.

971
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,432
I name it "Navidad"

972
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,235
because it was begun
on the day of our Lord's birth.

973
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,278
These Indians are a
kind and generous people.

974
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,398
And I believe they
can all be converted

975
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,834
to our Queen's Holy Faith.
Treat them kindly

976
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:56,555
and they will help
us build and explore

977
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,115
and lead us to
the mountains of gold.

978
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,828
I leave Diego de Harana in
charge here until my return

979
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,034
in the spring.

980
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,877
May we ask God's blessing
for all that you do here.

981
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,434
May His Spirit

982
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,955
bless and protect you.

983
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:18,292
Amén.

984
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,272
The Pinta!

985
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,550
Spain not only needs
new souls, Cristóbal.

986
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,550
She needs gold. While you were
spreading the word of God...

987
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,638
You took the Pinta inland
without my permission.

988
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,870
I ask my admiral's
forgiveness.

989
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,799
For defying me? Or
for bringing back so little?

990
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,638
It's all there was
to be found.

991
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,193
Then, captain Pinzon

992
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,532
tell your men to turn over
every ounce of gold

993
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,732
in their possession
to the master ar arms.

994
01:34:07,283 --> 01:34:09,076
What happened
to the houses of gold?

995
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:10,744
And scarves of silk?

996
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,574
See that your
crew is prepared.

997
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,295
Our caravels depart for Spain
the day after tomorrow.

998
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,036
Don't just sit there,
go to work!

999
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,711
Now we shall see
who the winds favor.

1000
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,839
I took no gold, Sir.

1001
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,314
The orders are being
obeyed, admiral.

1002
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:05,077
You have your gold.
- It is Spain's gold, my friend.

1003
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:09,274
But Torquemada and our Queen
will be expecting new Christian souls.

1004
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,638
I want 6 heathens
that I can convert and bring

1005
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,313
before the Royal court.

1006
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,075
You've taken
their gold, Cristóbal.

1007
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,318
Isn't that enough?

1008
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,696
Choose the six finest men
on this island, Harana.

1009
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,496
and see that they are
aboard the Niña when I leave.

1010
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,158
Come on, back to work!

1011
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:29,318
Will you join
me? Come!

1012
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,750
We must have lost
him in that last squall.

1013
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:04,938
Should I heave the sheets
until we can see some sign of him?

1014
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,554
The admiral knows his winds,
he has no need of us.

1015
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,918
On this voyage,
the Pinta waits for no one.

1016
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,074
Go fish, Morales.

1017
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,635
I'll give her back
when I'm done.

1018
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,750
You have plenty,
Alvaro.

1019
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,270
This one

1020
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,630
this one is mine.

1021
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:32,437
Leave her!

1022
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:35,755
I mean it!

1023
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:38,176
Think, Morales!
Think!

1024
01:37:38,594 --> 01:37:40,136
Is one of them
worth dying for?

1025
01:37:40,469 --> 01:37:42,096
There are hundreds
just like her.

1026
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,336
Now they know
we're not gods.

1027
01:38:07,421 --> 01:38:09,739
I always knew
you weren't a god.

1028
01:38:09,906 --> 01:38:11,616
You're a murderer.

1029
01:38:11,866 --> 01:38:12,991
You're a rapist!

1030
01:38:13,533 --> 01:38:15,577
You're a thief!
You're under arrest.

1031
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,833
I promise you a
burial at sea, Father.

1032
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:04,555
Forgive me, Father.

1033
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,475
Please forgive me.

1034
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,317
There's been
enough killing.

1035
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,994
Get up.

1036
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,635
Give him his
burial at sea.

1037
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,634
Now!

1038
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:05,984
"Salve Regina."

1039
01:40:06,985 --> 01:40:11,322
"Salve Regina."

1040
01:40:13,114 --> 01:40:14,532
"Salve..."

1041
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,155
Admiral, the
headman still refuses.

1042
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,092
I promised to deliver
the Word of God.

1043
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,999
Shackle him.

1044
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,313
Shackle him!

1045
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,998
De Torres,
tell them

1046
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:42,096
the heathens who do not
become new Christians

1047
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,079
shall be slaves.

1048
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,477
Spain has
need of both.

1049
01:40:48,138 --> 01:40:49,264
Stop him!

1050
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,319
Does the admiral
have any further orders?

1051
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,076
Terreros,
shackle all of them.

1052
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,713
De Torres,
carry on.

1053
01:41:12,863 --> 01:41:14,823
Carry on!
- No!

1054
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:22,662
"Salve Regina"

1055
01:41:23,454 --> 01:41:25,371
"Mater misericordiæ"

1056
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,498
Sing with me! Sing for
your own sake! Sing with me!

1057
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:30,625
"Salve Regina"

1058
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:32,626
"Salve Regina"

1059
01:41:33,335 --> 01:41:36,212
Sing!
"Salve Regina"!

1060
01:41:37,046 --> 01:41:39,632
"Mater misericordiæ"

1061
01:41:40,049 --> 01:41:43,092
"Vita, dulcedo"
Good, good! Again!

1062
01:41:43,301 --> 01:41:45,301
"Salve Regina"

1063
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,631
Your Highnesses,
I bring you news

1064
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,916
of a New World!

1065
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,558
With riches
beyond your wildest...

1066
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:04,759
I, Martin Alonso Pinzon...

1067
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:12,559
"The Lord id my sheperd,
I shall not want"

1068
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,755
What have you
got there?

1069
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:21,555
A gift?

1070
01:42:21,618 --> 01:42:23,119
Bring it.

1071
01:42:23,327 --> 01:42:24,495
Bring it.

1072
01:42:25,538 --> 01:42:26,871
Bring it here!

1073
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,631
My father's
belongings.

1074
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:52,389
"He leads me

1075
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,709
"besides still waters

1076
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:57,758
"he restores my soul..."

1077
01:43:03,063 --> 01:43:04,105
What?

1078
01:43:05,064 --> 01:43:07,024
What? What are
you looking at?

1079
01:43:10,735 --> 01:43:12,977
What do you want from me?
- "Righteousness..."

1080
01:43:13,027 --> 01:43:14,370
What do you want from me?

1081
01:43:15,154 --> 01:43:16,496
What do you want from me?

1082
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,074
Colón is a fool

1083
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,998
to think
heathens like you

1084
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,359
could ever be
souls of the Church!

1085
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:30,919
Look at you!

1086
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,632
Look at you!

1087
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,076
You are nothing
but savages!

1088
01:43:47,301 --> 01:43:50,094
How many more do I
have to kill? How many?

1089
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,234
"Thou preparest
a table before me

1090
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,317
"in the presence
of mine enemies

1091
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,153
"thou anointest
my head

1092
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,159
"My cup

1093
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,757
"overflows.

1094
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,632
"Surely
goodness and mercy

1095
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,838
"will follow me all
the days of my life

1096
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:22,910
"and I shall dwell in
the house of the Lord

1097
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:24,915
"forever."

1098
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:57,910
I believe God meant for
me to make this voyage

1099
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,714
as he means for us
to weather this storm

1100
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,715
and return to
Spain in triumph.

1101
01:45:06,021 --> 01:45:07,814
Benjamín.
- Admiral!

1102
01:45:08,647 --> 01:45:11,566
Hold fast!

1103
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:15,361
Terreros,
unshackle the Indians!

1104
01:45:15,736 --> 01:45:16,819
Aye, admiral.

1105
01:45:17,236 --> 01:45:18,988
Unshackle
the Indians!

1106
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:25,633
In this bottle

1107
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,250
adressed to
Queen Isabella

1108
01:45:27,619 --> 01:45:31,747
is recorded every detail
of my glorious discovery.

1109
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:35,080
Signed:
Don Cristóbal Colón

1110
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,191
Viceroy of
the Indies!

1111
01:45:41,629 --> 01:45:43,504
Admiral!

1112
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,465
Give me
your hand!

1113
01:45:48,967 --> 01:45:49,801
Hold on!

1114
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:55,394
You deserve
your triumph, admiral.

1115
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,235
What is the
loss of my ship

1116
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:03,310
compared to the wealth of discovery
that you bring back for the glory of Spain?

1117
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,757
You've won
me, admiral.

1118
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,235
In our last race...

1119
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:37,869
The race of life.

1120
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,149
Nonsense. You must get well, and
together we'll go to the Royal court.

1121
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,155
I've watched
you, map-maker.

1122
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:49,910
You rigged us to sail
only with the wind.

1123
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,831
In the heat of August,
we sailed south.

1124
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,634
The wind came
from the east.

1125
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:02,078
In winter,
when we returned,

1126
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,077
we sailed north, with
wind from the west.

1127
01:48:04,725 --> 01:48:06,602
Your secret

1128
01:48:06,977 --> 01:48:08,311
Rivers of wind!

1129
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,475
Yes, there are rivers of wind,
blowing in both directions.

1130
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,989
That was your
glorious secret.

1131
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,068
That the wind would last across the
whole of the ocean sea, I did not know.

1132
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:23,917
But you and I,
Martin, proved it.

1133
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,988
We've accomplished the
most wonderful navigation.

1134
01:48:28,866 --> 01:48:29,950
Cristóbal.

1135
01:48:31,827 --> 01:48:33,327
Cristóbal.

1136
01:48:34,704 --> 01:48:37,664
Don't let greed
put you in chains.

1137
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,154
Go.

1138
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,998
Claim you glory.

1139
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,994
God be with you.

1140
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,393
God be with you.

1141
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,749
And God bless you, Martin.

1142
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,156
He was born

1143
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,634
with a compass
in his head.

1144
01:49:24,654 --> 01:49:29,074
Colón!
Colón! Colón!

1145
01:49:44,501 --> 01:49:45,543
Cristóbal!

1146
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:06,919
Had I known he
would succeed...

1147
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:13,079
To bestow such honor
and wealth on a genoese...

1148
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,636
But what a glorious
day for Spain!

1149
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,472
Rise,
Don Cristóbal Colón.

1150
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:33,150
It is for us to salute you
on this day of God's blessing.

1151
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:36,078
Your Highnesses.
Your Grace.

1152
01:50:37,287 --> 01:50:40,664
You will rejoice in the knowledge
I have delivered Christ's blessings

1153
01:50:40,789 --> 01:50:42,039
across the ocean sea.

1154
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,830
Your Highness, from your
new realm in the Indies

1155
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,830
I bring you new
Christian souls.

1156
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:55,759
And for you,
Your Highness,

1157
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,229
I bring a bounty such
as Spain has never seen.

1158
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,996
You have now proclaimed
yourself an Apostle?

1159
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:06,717
To quote the Scriptures:
"He made me the Messenger

1160
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,712
and showed me the Way."

1161
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:13,239
Then it is He who will judge
you for what you've done.

1162
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,235
Bow down
before me.

1163
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:42,553
I, Ferdinand of Aragon declare
that from this day forward

1164
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,159
you shall be
known as admiral

1165
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,393
of the ocean sea

1166
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:52,155
and viceroy
of the Indies.

1167
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,079
You may rise.

1168
01:51:58,280 --> 01:51:59,759
Admiral Colón.

1169
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,988
You have earned our
respect and admiration.

1170
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,473
Now, where
is my gold?

1171
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:14,317
Show me,
Cristóbal.

1172
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:16,998
Show me
the New World.

1173
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:19,398
Your New World.

1174
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:39,077
There,
Your Highness.

1175
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,235
There.
