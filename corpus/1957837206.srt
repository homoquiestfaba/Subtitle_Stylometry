1
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,400
I was watching videos on the

2
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,778
internet the other night,
I like to stay educated, you know?

3
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,906
And I saw this one about octopuses.

4
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,994
Turns out
they have mini brains in each of their

5
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,706
eight legs, allowing them to act
independently of one another.

6
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,793
And that gave me an idea.

7
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,589
The OctoGames,

8
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,926
eight games, eight players, one winner,

9
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,721
each player acts independently,

10
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,016
but are all part of the same game.

11
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,728
My game, my totally sick.

12
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,146
Totally epic.

13
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,231
Totally awesome game.

14
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,944
How sick is that, bro?

15
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,406
Oh, that's harsh

16
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,783
Can you turn that down.

17
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,582
Name?

18
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,959
Carrie Miller.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,213
Okay, sign here.

20
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,675
What's a place this big doing
in the middle of nowhere?

21
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,636
It's JaxPro's studio.

22
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,639
Wow, okay!

23
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,936
Oh, your devices, please.

24
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,021
Oh, uh...

25
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,773
We'll return them to you
at the end of the games.

26
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,067
OK. Yeah, I get that

27
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:51,861
this way.

28
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,570
Alright.

29
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,571
Thanks.

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,088
Have y'all seen JaxPro yet?

31
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,635
Don't bother, he barely talked to me.

32
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,637
I'm focused.

33
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,972
That prize is mine.

34
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,682
We don't even know what it is yet.

35
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,811
JaxPro is running this,
so it's going to be huge.

36
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,314
Maxine, I'm a comedian.

37
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,483
Carrie, I'm a singer songwriter.

38
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,442
It's nice to meet you.

39
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,069
Nice to meet you.

40
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,362
Oh my gosh.

41
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,990
Aren't you so excited?
We get to be in the new JaxPro video.

42
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,117
I'm just here to get more followers.

43
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,078
Okay.

44
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,621
What do you think?

45
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,872
Oh, I'm going to win this.

46
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:45,623
Is that so?

47
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,333
Yeah. How hard can it be?

48
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,504
Walt Brentwood. Entrepreneur.

49
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,297
Carrie.

50
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,467
You look like you'd be great

51
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,677
at selling real estate.

52
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,471
What?

53
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,445
Hey, Moneybags.

54
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,822
Switch with me.

55
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,825
Who, me?

56
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,958
What's up, guys?

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,087
My name is JaxPro, and welcome
to game one of the OctoGames.

58
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,303
I hope you all found everything OK.

59
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,057
You have each been invited here due
to your promising social media presence.

60
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,187
This is the first of eight games
and only eight of you will move forward.

61
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,607
Now you've probably seen
the room is full of cameras.

62
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,609
Once the games are over,

63
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,529
everything will be uploaded to my channel
for the world to see.

64
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,907
What's the prize?

65
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,117
Well, I was going to wait
until after the first game

66
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,327
to say but.

67
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,620
Oh, come on!

68
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,955
Boo! Come on!

69
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,207
All right.

70
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,211
After the games,
I'll be retiring from social media.

71
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,796
Wait, what? You can't!

72
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,923
Whoa whoa! It's OK.

73
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:21,928
It's all right because the winner
is going to win all of my social media

74
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,308
accounts, my sponsorships
and my one hundred and fifteen

75
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,476
million followers.

76
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,065
So let's not waste any time.

77
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,611
The first game is, Simon Says.

78
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,697
Simon Says like the kids game?

79
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,032
The game is simple.

80
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,078
All players must obey
any command, beginning with the words.

81
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,707
"Simon Says", If I say,
"Simon Says take a step"

82
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,501
then all players must take a step.

83
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,380
But if I say "jump" without saying,
"Simon Says" first

84
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,465
the players must not jump.

85
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:05,221
If you do a command without "Simon Says"
in front of it, you'll be eliminated.

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,058
The last eight
standing will move on to Game two.

87
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,518
Good luck.

88
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,690
This is the Eliminator.

89
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,608
He will escort the losers out.

90
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,781
You've gotta be kidding me!

91
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,952
What is he,
like a dog or something?

92
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,926
Simon says.

93
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,471
Clap once.

94
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,685
Simon says.

95
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,479
Touch your nose.

96
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,865
Simon says, put your hand down.

97
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,453
Put your hand on your head.

98
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,042
Simon didn't say to put
your hand on your head.

99
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,504
Sadly, you are eliminated.

100
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,156
No! No!

101
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,743
Oh my god...

102
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,083
Stay calm.

103
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,627
Anyone
attempting to leave will be eliminated.

104
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,345
What's up, guys?

105
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,514
I thought I made the rules clear.

106
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,558
You never said you were going to kill us.

107
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,981
Yeah, Simon didn't say speak.

108
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,067
Only twelve players remain.

109
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,235
Good luck,

110
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,073
Simon says.

111
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,159
Stand on one foot.

112
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,180
Carrie.

113
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,431
What?

114
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,809
He's leaning against the wall.

115
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,353
He's cheating.

116
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,422
Simon says.

117
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,384
Hold your breath.

118
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,785
Oh, Jesus.

119
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,264
Hey!

120
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,484
Simon says the game is over.

121
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,110
Congratulations.

122
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,613
The eight of you were able to complete
Game one.

123
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,700
You've qualified for the chance
to win my accounts.

124
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,245
And my one hundred and
fifteen million followers.

125
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,291
Approach the camera
and state your name and occupation.

126
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,044
Anyone who disobeys will be eliminated.

127
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,689
Carrie Miller,

128
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,190
I'm a singer songwriter.

129
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,192
I'm AJ_620.

130
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,820
I'm a video game streamer.

131
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,238
Maxine.

132
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,407
I'm a comedian.

133
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,910
I'm Ruth Martin,
and I have the next big cooking show.

134
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,121
Name's Stephen Randal.

135
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,706
People call me "Squish"

136
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,374
I'm a motivational speaker.

137
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,835
Walter Brentwood, entrepreneur.

138
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,253
Jess Hardbody

139
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,504
I'm dedicated to helping people

140
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,257
achieve their dream body through hard
work, determination and focus.

141
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,093
Kids, call me Ms. Sunshine.

142
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,929
I make online content for children.

143
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,275
Please follow me to the barracks.

144
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,117
Today's footage, sir.

145
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,870
Ooh, Simon says, thank you.

146
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,331
Go.

147
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,710
Luna!

148
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,505
Honey, I got it.

149
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,633
Luna, honey?

150
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,098
Are you tanning?

151
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,308
It's freezing!

152
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,352
My followers want me tan!

153
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,436
Oh my god...

154
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,399
Well, I have the footage from Simon says.

155
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,194
I cannot wait to see it all cut together.

156
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,615
Gosh, honey, I am so excited to retire
and run away with you.

157
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,326
I can't wait to get fat.

158
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,080
Oh, we're going to get so fucking fat
with no one around to judge us.

159
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,040
You'll finally, let yourself go bald

160
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,167
and you'll stop tanning
and the cold.

161
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,669
We'll be hideous.

162
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,546
Oh, you're so out of my league.

163
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,340
Not for long.

164
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,511
But like, how fat?

165
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,240
Clothes.

166
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,790
This is so surreal.

167
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,501
I'm still in shock.

168
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,963
You and everyone else.

169
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,550
I gotta call, my sister. I gotta...

170
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,434
Hey. You okay?

171
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,518
I'm scared.

172
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,352
Yeah, us too.

173
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,565
I'm just a preschool
teacher, I'm not going to make it far.

174
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,612
Hey, the
three of us, we'll stick together.

175
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,613
Alright?

176
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,449
Oh, please.

177
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,200
Are you serious?

178
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,952
This surprises you?

179
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,037
This is the big time, honey.

180
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,583
Famous people drink the blood of babies
to stay young all the time.

181
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,378
You really thought winning a hundred
million followers would be easy?

182
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,090
Good luck, sweetheart.

183
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,553
Hey. Take a deep breath.

184
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,096
Think about it, we're dead!

185
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,473
Just breathe! Hey!

186
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,265
In.

187
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,184
Out.

188
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,439
You're right.

189
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,191
I've got this.

190
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,195
I'm motivated, I'm driven, I'm fit.

191
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,654
I can do this.

192
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,447
We can do this.

193
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,574
We're going to be all right. OK?

194
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,125
What a bunch of stinkers am I right?

195
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,253
Stinkers?

196
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,338
Yeah.

197
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,589
You and me.

198
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,466
We're smart.

199
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,468
We know stuff.

200
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,304
Everybody else is just ruled
by their emotions.

201
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,853
Yeah, I'm not looking to make friends.

202
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,396
You sure?

203
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,024
I can start charming these ladies.

204
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,109
Get us an advantage.

205
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,947
Yeah? Think so?

206
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,659
Dude, I could charm the
panties off Mother Teresa.

207
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,708
Yeah, I'm not looking to make friends.

208
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,545
But I could use an ally.

209
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,131
Maxine.

210
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,424
Look.

211
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,721
Here we go.

212
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,650
Where are we?

213
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,778
Lights on!

214
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,828
Whoa!

215
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,455
What's up, guys?

216
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,041
Game number two is hopscotch.

217
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,294
The rules are simple.

218
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,379
First, you'll draw a number.

219
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,007
That number will represent the order
you'll go.

220
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:31,513
Each player must hop across to win, but
if the board turns red, you can't move.

221
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:36,185
If you do move when the board is red,
you will be eliminated.

222
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,355
The game ends after the first elimination.

223
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,440
Good luck,

224
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,901
First contestant!

225
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,737
Okay...

226
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,390
How are you feeling?

227
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,308
Good.

228
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,561
Like I said, I'm a preschool teacher,

229
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,107
hopscotch is my specialty.

230
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,609
What were you whistling?

231
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,861
You'll see.

232
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,031
Next contestant.

233
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,290
OK. All right.

234
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,250
Here we go.

235
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,980
That. What is that?

236
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,648
Shh!

237
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,077
Almost there.

238
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,329
Almost there. Almost there. Almost there.

239
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,124
You think she'll make it?

240
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,209
Quiet!

241
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,722
Trade with me.

242
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,098
What? Why? You have the best number.

243
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,183
I feel good about this.

244
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,478
I'm trying to do you a favor.

245
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,354
OK. Sure.

246
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,397
Thanks.

247
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,110
Next contestant.

248
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,021
Yes!

249
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,650
Yes! Send the flowers,
she's done! She's done!

250
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,236
She's done! Oh, yes!

251
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,698
No, no, no, no, no!

252
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,077
No! Stop!

253
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,329
Please! Stop!

254
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,374
No no no no!

255
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,210
No! Stop! Please!

256
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,964
Please, stop! Stop!

257
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,138
Stop it, you're torturing her!

258
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,417
That wasn't smart.

259
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,712
I couldn't just let him torture her.

260
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,464
You could have been killed.

261
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,842
Hey.

262
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,594
You were really brave back there.

263
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,554
The hell do you want?

264
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,138
Wait.

265
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,640
Let him talk.

266
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,976
Why'd you switch numbers with me?

267
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,106
I told Squish

268
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,525
I was on his side.

269
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,819
I told him I'd get in with you
for his benefit.

270
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,362
So are you on our side?

271
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,990
I'm on whose
ever side helps me to take him down.

272
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,116
How can we trust you?

273
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:01,825
You can't.

274
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,787
So what do you say?

275
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,706
You in?

276
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,589
You look like you could use a friend.

277
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,298
Do I?

278
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,341
Sure.

279
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,969
You're a strong young man
and that helps me in the games

280
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,474
and I'm a woman and I might be able
to help you in a different way.

281
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,642
Really?

282
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,518
Yeah.

283
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,437
No.

284
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,070
Hey, handsome.

285
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,365
I have a question.

286
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,035
Hey, I'm talking to you.

287
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,371
Go away.

288
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,956
I'm meditating.

289
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,667
Leave me alone.

290
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,628
You know, I've seen your videos before,

291
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,882
all that motivational stuff
you did after you got out of prison.

292
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,843
It's empowering.

293
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,761
Where are you going?

294
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,803
Anywhere else.

295
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,554
Hold on.

296
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,431
I want to tell you about my cooking show,

297
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,975
Why? Only one of us
are going to make it out of here anyway.

298
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:13,355
I have a cooking show and I have great
ideas for cookware and kitchen items.

299
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,398
If you don't leave me the fuck alone

300
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,234
I swear I will beat the shit out of you.

301
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,528
You can't do that. I'm a woman.

302
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,863
It's never stopped me before.

303
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,908
You really need to learn
to control your emotions.

304
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,126
Hey, are you OK?

305
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,211
(Mumbling)

306
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,797
I'm warning everybody right now

307
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,384
do not fuck with me!

308
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,685
Fucking jackass.

309
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,686
I could have taken him.

310
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,479
I just didn't see it coming.

311
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,023
How? He warned you?

312
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,316
Tilt your head back a bit.

313
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,569
You seem to really know what you're doing.

314
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,905
I was in med school before I was a gamer.

315
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,533
Talk about a real downgrade, huh?

316
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,122
I'm AJ, by the way,

317
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,206
I don't think we formally met

318
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,999
Maxine

319
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,208
Carrie

320
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,836
Sorry about your friend.

321
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,838
This is ridiculous.

322
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,841
We need to find a way out of here.

323
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,219
Everyone, please prepare yourself for Game
three

324
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,305
Already?

325
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,848
Tonight.

326
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,641
Let's look for a way out.

327
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,517
Deal.

328
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,899
Hey, baby,

329
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,649
What's up?

330
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,069
Any missing persons reports yet?

331
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,739
No, I have been texting the families,
so no suspects anything.

332
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,240
Oh, good. Good.

333
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,243
You know, I really
think this is going to be my masterpiece,

334
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,080
the perfect way to go out.

335
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:59,044
How long, do you think,
until people realize it's real?

336
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,004
Don't know, don't care.

337
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,049
As long as we're on an island somewhere
when it all happens.

338
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,218
Two more days...

339
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,511
Two...

340
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,721
No, three more days.

341
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,974
Oh, duh.

342
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,434
Three more days. Right.

343
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,604
Good work.

344
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,578
What's up, guys?

345
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,831
You can take your blindfolds off.

346
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,795
Welcome to the obstacle course.

347
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,924
This game, however, is optional.

348
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,511
You guys have tugged at my heartstrings,

349
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,181
so I wanted to give you a way out.

350
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,850
The rules are simple make it to

351
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:59,438
the end in under sixty seconds
and you get to go home.

352
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,273
No questions asked.

353
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,526
Any volunteers?

354
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,652
I'll do it.

355
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,697
Bitch, I'm not going.

356
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,574
Why not? You've had the shit
beaten out of you

357
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,660
If you think a little bruise
is going to keep me

358
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,955
from winning a hundred million followers,
you've got another thing coming.

359
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:17,873
Whatever.

360
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,345
This is too easy.

361
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,889
What's the catch?

362
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,146
Your time starts now.

363
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,413
There's the catch.

364
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,147
You gonna do it?

365
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,649
What? Are you kidding? No way.

366
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,652
We got a game to win.

367
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,142
I did it!

368
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,561
I did it!

369
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,740
The contestant has
gone over the time limit.

370
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,119
She's right.

371
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,210
Would anyone else like to try?

372
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,215
I'll go.

373
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,300
What are you doing?

374
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,176
I can do this.

375
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,720
Don't you want to get out of here alive?

376
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,598
I'm sorry.

377
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,810
Carrie, this is suicide.

378
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,156
And your time starts now.

379
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,867
Wait, wait, wait.

380
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,005
Help me understand

381
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,425
This is a way out.

382
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,304
It's risky, but it is a way out.

383
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,932
And I want out.

384
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,311
But I'm risking my whole life anyway,

385
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:31,274
if I just go back to my stupid retail job
and singing in

386
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:36,946
bars, whatever, I get the chance to drunks
who aren't even paying attention to me.

387
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,743
It's a risk either way

388
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,955
But something

389
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,124
got us all here in the first place.

390
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,630
Or I could stay here,

391
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,299
and I can try to change things for myself

392
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,261
and to have an audience of people

393
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,890
who actually care to listen.

394
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,603
Now that I've finally got my shot.

395
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,731
I gotta fucking take it.

396
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,957
Women, right?

397
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,920
Wow! Only six contestants left.

398
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,466
Now put your blindfolds on and
you'll be escorted back to the barracks.

399
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,846
Game four is up next.

400
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,069
Hey

401
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,741
Ready to bring the contestants back in?

402
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,080
You understand
any disloyalty will be punished by death.

403
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,624
Jesus, again, with a loyalty thing?

404
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,502
JaxPro saved my life.

405
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,421
And he gave me millions.

406
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,381
We all have our reasons.

407
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,468
Hand it over.

408
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,055
Listen, I'm here to do a job
and do it well, so please...

409
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,571
Why are you packing already?

410
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,990
I'm just excited.

411
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:52,874
Who's that?

412
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,043
Just my mom.

413
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,212
Ew. Gross.

414
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,341
I'm going to go call her.

415
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,259
Mm hmm.

416
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,648
You got it?

417
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,611
How much do I use?

418
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,905
A teaspoon. Any more,
and he'll taste it.

419
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,156
Got it.

420
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,034
When am I getting paid?

421
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,119
He's cashing out after Game seven.

422
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,871
That's what I'm going
to do it stop by then.

423
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:32,956
Got it.

424
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,043
Thank you.

425
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,796
It's my pleasure, believe me.

426
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,776
Let's find a way out here.

427
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,611
What about him?

428
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,655
He hasn't moved in two hours.

429
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,448
Something's wrong.

430
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,701
This is our chance.

431
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:10,785
Go check.

432
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,705
What's up, guys?

433
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,750
Welcome to round four of the OctoGames.

434
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,627
Musical chairs.

435
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,131
I think these are all going to be kids
games.

436
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,134
Kids games to have a winner
and a loser, Walt.

437
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,261
The rules are simple.

438
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,557
There are five chairs and six of you,

439
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,561
when the music starts,
you'll walk in a circle around them.

440
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,982
When the music stops,
you must sit down in one of the chairs.

441
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,860
Whoever doesn't is out.

442
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,447
The first person out will be eliminated.

443
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,117
After that,
we will play to determine a winner.

444
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:37,455
Speaking of winner,
this game does have a prize.

445
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:43,378
This winner will have one million dollars
deposited into their bank account.

446
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,340
Why would we want a million dollars
if you're just going to kill us?

447
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,676
Don't you guys have like families

448
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,054
that would want it or something?

449
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,807
May the best player win.

450
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:33,970
AJ!

451
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,061
AJ, no! No!

452
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,156
All rise.

453
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,335
Now to get that million.

454
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,922
Split it with me
if I get myself eliminated?

455
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,424
How does fifty grand sound?

456
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,176
Works for me.

457
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,485
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

458
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,529
It's OK, it's OK.

459
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,318
Fuck you.

460
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,951
Fuck it. Whatever.

461
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,809
Don't even try it.

462
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,237
This is fun!

463
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,833
AJ! You're OK.

464
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,672
Barely, but yeah.

465
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,135
Wait, what's going on?

466
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,845
Hey, guys.

467
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,556
So I wanted to make this game
a little more interesting.

468
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,226
Eliminating the first person,
is a little boring,

469
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,397
so I decided why not make winning
this prize more intense?

470
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,818
Two of you remain
one of you will get the prize.

471
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,029
The other will die.

472
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,781
Good luck.

473
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,122
Well, may the best man win.

474
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,540
Bite me.

475
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,044
We gotta take him down.

476
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,182
Look, I'm not asking you to help me win,

477
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,603
I'm asking you to help me stop him.

478
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,945
I'm in.

479
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,447
Me, too.

480
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:08,536
Thank you.

481
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,288
You won't regret it.

482
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,295
I was wrong about you.

483
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,713
Sorry.

484
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,047
I know.

485
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,094
There she is.

486
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,556
Where am I?

487
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,809
That doesn't matter,
you impressed me back there.

488
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,937
I wanted to meet you.

489
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,147
JaxPro?

490
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,565
In the flesh.

491
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,360
Oh my God.

492
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,280
No offense, but you're fucking crazy.

493
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,241
And I like that.

494
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,453
So I have a little proposition for you.

495
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,873
I want you to help me

496
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,918
with the rest of the games.

497
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,130
Are you going to kill me?

498
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,424
No, I'm going to hire you.

499
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,968
Two million dollars.

500
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,596
And once we're done, I'll let you go.

501
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,100
I'm in

502
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,476
good.

503
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,603
And you know what?

504
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,108
The fun is just beginning.

505
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,451
Fifty grand.

506
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,786
Man of my word.

507
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,538
It was beautiful,

508
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,374
Carrie actually thought
I was doing her a favor.

509
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,876
So how's that going, huh?

510
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:21,835
Any new information?

511
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,088
Not really. Just a bunch of ditzy kids,

512
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,673
just like I suspected.

513
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,301
So what's this I hear...

514
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,470
about y'all trying to take me down?

515
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,099
How'd you hear that?

516
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,142
I didn't.

517
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,352
Just a lucky guess.

518
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,770
No, no. See what I was doing, I was...

519
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,896
Listen, Walt.

520
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,899
I will break your fat fucking neck

521
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,443
if you betray my trust.

522
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,153
You understand me?

523
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,113
Yes, sir.

524
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,158
Atta boy.

525
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,834
I don't trust him.

526
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,211
Don't have to.

527
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,506
We just have to believe that taking down
Squish is in his best interest.

528
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,925
Which it is.

529
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,846
I think he's playing the field.

530
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,973
That can only backfire for him.

531
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,558
He can't be that dumb.

532
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,143
Oh my God.

533
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,019
This is driving me crazy.

534
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,938
I feel so hopeless.

535
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,277
I mean,
it's basically a hostage situation.

536
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,614
I just wanted to boost my music career.

537
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,284
This isn't your fault.

538
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,119
You know that, right?

539
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,414
I could have gotten out
through the obstacle course.

540
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,375
Hey, that thing was a death trap

541
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,668
and you know it.

542
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,381
I guess so.

543
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,226
I really wish we had met
on the outside of all this.

544
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,064
We could have done, like, a
project together or something.

545
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,406
Put on your blindfolds

546
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,992
and prepare for Game five.

547
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,704
Who is that?

548
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,756
Second half,

549
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,049
we still good?

550
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,733
Everyone take off your blindfolds.

551
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,788
We need to find a way out of here.

552
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,706
We should go for a window.

553
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,458
The doors are probably locked.

554
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,293
Let's just keep an eye out.

555
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,130
And if one of us escapes we'll send help.

556
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,173
Man, that new guard is kind of short.

557
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,801
Looks like the old guard

558
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,969
got left in the dryer.

559
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,056
What, you don't recognize her?

560
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,766
No, should I?

561
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,314
What's up, guys?

562
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,233
Welcome to Game five.

563
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,901
Hide and seek.

564
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,861
Only five of you remain.

565
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,989
The rules are obvious

566
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,868
You will have sixty seconds to hide
anywhere in this house.

567
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,872
After that,
The Eliminator will try to find you

568
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,667
the first person he finds is out.

569
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,295
Good luck.

570
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:01,513
60, 59, 58,

571
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:06,477
57, 56, 55

572
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:49,853
Shit

573
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:50,395
Maxine.

574
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,689
Get over here with me.

575
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,565
It's fine.

576
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,776
I'll find somewhere else to hide.

577
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,446
24, 23,

578
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,659
22, 21, 20,

579
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:10,624
19, 18, 17, 16, 15,

580
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,627
14, 13,

581
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,258
Can I squeeze
back there with you?

582
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,635
I mean, you can try.

583
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:23,846
Maxine.

584
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,936
Ten. Nine.

585
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,524
Eight. Seven. Six.

586
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,362
Thank you.

587
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,949
Five. Four.

588
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:48,579
Three. Two. One.

589
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,665
Ready or not,

590
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,584
here he comes.

591
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,193
No, no!

592
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,778
Get the fuck out!

593
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,826
Stop!

594
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,247
What are you doing?

595
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,500
Please.

596
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,213
I'm sorry.

597
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,035
What are you doing?

598
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,211
What are you doing?

599
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,704
What are you doing?

600
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,788
I'm so sorry.

601
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,945
Hey, hey, hey.

602
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,071
Look at me.

603
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,114
It was you or her.

604
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:11,990
Okay?

605
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,158
You or her.

606
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,034
You did good.

607
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,334
Please.

608
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,461
Please.

609
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,641
Carrie!

610
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,643
Maxine!

611
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,111
Maxine!

612
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:16,847
I'm so sorry, Maxine.

613
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,688
What happened,

614
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,691
Squish, crammed into the closet
with me and Maxine

615
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,318
and then he threw out when he heard
somebody coming in.

616
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,282
It's nothing personal.

617
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,243
Someone has to lose.

618
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,579
We're down to four.

619
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,126
Carrie, I'm so sorry, it happened so fast.

620
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,544
Go away.

621
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,101
Ruth

622
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:06,938
You were still breathing

623
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,648
when they drug you out.

624
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,028
I'm going to make sure you lose.

625
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,210
So, game seven's coming up.

626
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,045
Mm-Hmm.

627
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,296
What's the plan?

628
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,924
Well, we're going to cash out that night
and then right after Game eight,

629
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,095
we're going to upload the video and he's
going to fly us out to the island.

630
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,930
Good, good.

631
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,766
How are things with Ruth?

632
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,019
As if on cue.

633
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:53,401
Hi!

634
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,326
Ruth, this is my girlfriend.

635
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,787
Oh, Luna Laughlin.

636
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,207
Oh my God,
you're just as gorgeous in person.

637
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,168
You're so sweet.

638
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:11,669
Come on.

639
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,171
I'll give you the tour.

640
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:20,846
Enjoy him while you can, honey.

641
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,018
Hey.

642
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,896
Good work, back there.

643
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:30,814
Thanks.

644
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,360
Final four.

645
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,198
Happens when it's just you and me?

646
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,451
Well, I guess the best man wins.

647
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,465
I was

648
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,427
almost out.

649
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,140
If the guard didn't see you,
you would have escaped, right?

650
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,058
Right.

651
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,853
That means there's holes in their design.

652
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,564
We just have to wait for the next one.

653
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,318
What if I'm not alive in the next one?

654
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,127
Oh my god, will you quit your whining?

655
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,797
Who the hell do you think you are?

656
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,511
I'm just a guy in a game of life or death
and treating it as such.

657
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,431
You killed an innocent person.

658
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,309
No, I didn't.

659
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,061
He did.

660
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,693
You're evil.

661
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,402
You know?

662
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,321
Yeah? Why?

663
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,865
Because I'm fighting for my survival
just like you?

664
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,952
Because you only think about yourself.

665
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,956
So you tell me,
what do I get out of helping any of you?

666
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:14,793
Right.

667
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:22,926
This.

668
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,969
Is my studio.

669
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:28,515
Oh, wow,
so this is where everything happens.

670
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,101
What's up, guys?

671
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,520
JaxPro here.

672
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,315
Locked.

673
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,733
Now...

674
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:42,404
there is one more thing
I'm going to need you to do for me.

675
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,699
Anything for you.

676
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:01,756
Today was your audition and you passed.

677
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,384
Congratulations.

678
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:08,972
This one was caught by another guard
carrying cyanide

679
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,851
most likely to try and kill me.

680
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,440
You know what to do?

681
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,643
Y'know we could just take our chances
and run for it.

682
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,687
They'd shoot us on sight.

683
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,148
What if we rushed them?

684
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,524
They can't take us all out at once.

685
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,359
You rush them, I'll
fight every one of you.

686
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,819
The hell is wrong with you?

687
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,821
I'm about to win this thing
and everybody knows it.

688
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,949
You almost lost the last game.

689
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,202
Careful, Carrie.

690
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,205
You remember what happened to Ruth?

691
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,166
What's up, guys?

692
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,418
Welcome to Game six,

693
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,671
tether ball, a playground favorite.

694
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,299
What's with all the kids games?

695
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,468
Who do you think watches my videos?

696
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,513
The rules are simple,

697
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,807
hit the ball all the way around the pole

698
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:40,271
and you win, we'll be playing three rounds
of one on one tether ball

699
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,567
AJ versus Walt and Carrie versus Squish.

700
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,613
The losers will
then play each other in the final round

701
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,865
to determine who is eliminated.

702
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,784
Still feeling so cocky?

703
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,704
We will be playing Game
seven later this evening and tomorrow

704
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,165
we'll be playing the final game.

705
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:00,750
Good luck.

706
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,222
Oh, my God.

707
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,141
God... Okay...

708
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,405
first up is Walt and A.J..

709
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,215
Sorry we have to do this.

710
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,217
I can see right through you.

711
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,929
I don't know what it is you think you see,
but I promise you, I want what you want.

712
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,557
I know you killed Maxine.

713
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,391
What?

714
00:57:58,892 --> 00:57:59,559
Why would I?

715
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,478
Ah! Jesus!

716
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,939
AJ, you got this. C'mon c'mon c'mon!

717
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,692
Go, A.J., Come on.

718
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,528
Come on, Walt.

719
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,492
Come on, you can do this.

720
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:17,827
Come on, keep going.

721
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,123
Yes!

722
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,712
Oh, fuck me!

723
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,130
And that's for Maxine.

724
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,390
The winner is A.J.

725
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,686
Take that, Boomer.

726
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,648
Next up is Carrie and Squish.

727
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,113
For the record...

728
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,241
Walt killed Maxine.

729
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,367
Only because I told him to.

730
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,161
That's not true.

731
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,373
I guess it's your word against mine.

732
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:32,944
Good job

733
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:35,905
The winner is Squish.

734
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,619
What the hell was that?

735
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:45,540
Think about it. I could either
lose to you, hurt my hands

736
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,792
and then play Walt. Or...

737
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,045
I could let you win.

738
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:54,132
And play Walt with clean hands.

739
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,802
You're not the only one who can play
smart.

740
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,971
That's not fair.

741
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,809
That's what I'm talking about,
that's playing smart.

742
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,021
Next up is Walt and Carrie.

743
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,067
Well,

744
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,695
Nice knowing you, Walt.

745
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,240
Goddammit...

746
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,711
Carrie, please, no...

747
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,255
you know, to do this
to me, Carrie, please.

748
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:37,717
Yes, come on.

749
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,931
He's fucking done.

750
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,529
Winner is Carrie.

751
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,745
Please, please, no,

752
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,082
I don't want to die.

753
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,959
I see you're finally catching on.

754
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:12,960
Good job.

755
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,299
Give me one more game.

756
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,385
I don't wanna die.

757
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,970
Guys, do something!

758
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,723
They're gonna kill me!

759
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:26,516
Carrie...

760
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,435
oh, Jesus Christ.

761
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,853
Do something!

762
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,285
No...

763
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:47,995
You were supposed to

764
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,787
I thought we had a deal. You were...

765
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:02,069
What are you looking at?

766
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,912
Whoa! That was a great game!

767
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,997
Only three of you remain.

768
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,625
Carrie, Squish, and AJ

769
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:19,212
Game seven will be played later tonight.

770
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,174
I'm so excited!

771
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,182
What do we do now?

772
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,851
All I know

773
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,021
is that one of us is going
to make it out of here alive.

774
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,399
It's going to be you or me.

775
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,778
How do you know that?

776
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:49,116
Cause we're going to
make sure Squish dies.

777
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,663
What if it ends up being you versus me?

778
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,126
We're not going to think about that yet.

779
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,889
Honey, where's my G-fuel?

780
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,057
It's coming.

781
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:30,449
Thank you.

782
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,499
Have you tried this?

783
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,168
Oh, yeah, I hate it.

784
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:43,880
But like this flavor?

785
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,090
It's all gross to me.

786
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,553
Every flavor? Come on.

787
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,347
I've tried that one.

788
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,308
No, you haven't this is a new flavor.

789
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:56,851
Come on.

790
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,602
Would you just take a sip for me?

791
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,771
Why do you want me
to try this shit so much?

792
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:05,109
Because I like sharing things
with the people I love. Sue me.

793
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,736
Please just take a sip.

794
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:09,739
I don't want it.

795
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,210
Luna, try it.

796
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,504
It's nasty.

797
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,759
Try it or I'll hurt you.

798
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,138
I just had Ruth

799
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,516
kill a guard
because they were caught carrying cyanide.

800
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,187
Now I don't know if they were trying
to fuck with the games

801
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:47,026
or if they were trying to kill me
or they were trying to give it to you.

802
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,988
And if there's nothing in here,
we have nothing to worry about.

803
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,866
Get back here!

804
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,804
You shot her.

805
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,808
Yes. But when I stopped by to

806
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:23,312
bring you the footage from the game,
I heard you arguing upstairs.

807
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:28,067
And so when she came down the stairs, I
I just wanted to protect you, JaxPro, I...

808
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,194
I didn't know
what she was going to do to you.

809
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,154
Give me the gun.

810
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,678
Just to be sure.

811
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,639
You did the right thing.

812
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,017
I won't forget this.

813
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,814
You might think what I've done is shocking

814
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,192
to me, the OctoGames was the natural

815
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:12,987
answer to the myriad of problems
life had given me.

816
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:17,199
Life and the internet treated me
like a product to be bought and sold,

817
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:20,286
like something to be watched
rather than understood.

818
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:24,623
So I held the OctoGames, a real life
fight to the death

819
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:29,545
where people are treated the way
I was treated my entire life as product.

820
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:35,259
Hmm. That's a hell of a suicide note.

821
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,804
What now?

822
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,433
I pack my bags
and I leave the country after Game eight.

823
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:45,978
Alone?

824
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:48,898
I guess so.

825
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,191
What about me?

826
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,778
I'll pay you the two million
tomorrow morning.

827
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:57,740
You know that's not what I meant.

828
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,368
We couldn't

829
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,537
Why not? We're made for each other.

830
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,456
Yeah, but

831
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,583
you're, like, old and stuff.

832
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,378
But we'll be on an island!
No one can judge us.

833
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,090
I guess that's true

834
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,635
Better with someone old than
no one at all.

835
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:25,226
That might just be insane enough to work

836
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:28,270
you like insane, remember?

837
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,626
What's up, guys?

838
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,796
Welcome to Game seven, Hangman.

839
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,382
A classroom favorite.

840
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,676
The rules are simple.

841
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:45,139
We have a mystery phrase
and each of you will take turns

842
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,726
guessing one letter for each letter
you get wrong

843
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:52,855
you will receive a bigger and bigger
electric shock.

844
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,984
If you guess the phrase,
you'll be released from your chair.

845
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,945
The first person to stop breathing loses.

846
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,239
This one's a fun one.

847
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,409
You have two seconds per guess. Good luck.

848
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,540
Squish.

849
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,209
You're up.

850
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,545
Time's up.

851
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:21,550
T

852
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:26,305
L

853
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:32,310
F

854
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:33,938
Wrong.

855
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,318
Focus on the vowels.

856
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:40,236
A

857
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:43,405
E

858
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:46,825
O

859
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:50,996
I

860
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,166
N

861
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:01,632
Time!

862
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:13,769
B

863
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:15,187
Wrong.

864
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,279
S

865
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:26,698
D

866
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,325
Wrong again

867
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,505
He's bombing.

868
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,257
It's not over yet.

869
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:45,634
R

870
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:47,344
Wrong.

871
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,933
M

872
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,397
Time.

873
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,440
No, no, no, no, no, no.

874
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,567
I'll solve it.

875
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:05,988
Shock him

876
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,449
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

877
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,661
Maxine lost the OctoGames.

878
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,088
Shit.

879
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,602
Congratulations.

880
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,687
You can stand over there.

881
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,571
Don't try anything.

882
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,759
What do we do?

883
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,307
There's no way out.

884
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,394
What are you saying?

885
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:27,820
You want to compete?

886
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,032
I got this.

887
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:36,620
Begin

888
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:38,622
A

889
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:46,296
Time.

890
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,177
E

891
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,263
AJ, what are you doing?

892
01:13:57,724 --> 01:13:58,725
Time.

893
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,021
AJ, stop!

894
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:04,940
I

895
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:07,276
Wrong.

896
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:16,160
Time.

897
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:24,001
AJ, please!

898
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,344
U

899
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:38,682
No...

900
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,227
Time.

901
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,525
No, no. No no no no.

902
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:11,756
Very good game, everyone.

903
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:14,426
Such a tender moment.

904
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,720
I'll see you all tomorrow morning

905
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,723
for the final game.

906
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,657
What do you want?

907
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:37,866
May the best man win.

908
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,788
Best man?

909
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,338
You have cheated your
way through this whole game.

910
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,132
You have almost lost twice.

911
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:56,843
You should be dead instead of. AJ

912
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:00,138
instead of Maxine instead of all of them.

913
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,809
You know,
it doesn't really matter what you think.

914
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:05,519
Right?

915
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:15,571
You think this world belongs to you?

916
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:20,284
To nice people,
to people that play by the rules

917
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,995
that bend over for the will of others?

918
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:24,871
No.

919
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:27,123
No.

920
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,168
It belongs to us.

921
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,171
Those that will do whatever it takes,
even if it means throwing

922
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,091
everybody else under the bus,
that's who it belongs to.

923
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,385
Wake up!

924
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,601
You are going to die tomorrow.

925
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:49,855
And I can't wait.

926
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,806
Uh, I'm looking for Mr. JaxPro?

927
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,267
You're looking at him.

928
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:28,351
Oh.

929
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,188
Are you... Are you...

930
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:35,900
Mr. JaxPro, sir. Hi.

931
01:17:35,942 --> 01:17:37,361
It's an honor to finally see your face

932
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,280
Okay just come in.

933
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,787
Wow.

934
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,000
Do you know why I called you here?

935
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,296
Yes, sir.

936
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:59,549
Oh. Why?

937
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:05,013
Because during the, um...

938
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,348
You wanted to

939
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:10,310
Because you ruined the goddamn illusion
during tetherball!

940
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:12,938
I'm sorry.

941
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:17,401
You let a boomer take off your mask.

942
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,114
Do you know how
un-scary your fucking face is?

943
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,783
You're a fucking dweeb!

944
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:26,868
What does that?

945
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:29,746
The tattoo?

946
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:30,455
Yes!

947
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,833
Yeah, that's yours.

948
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:35,126
I know it's my tattoo.

949
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:36,920
Why do you have it?

950
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:38,630
Because I look up to you.

951
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:39,297
That...

952
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:39,881
Eww!

953
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:40,548
No!

954
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:43,218
I'm a brand, you're nothing.

955
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,095
I know.

956
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:46,972
I'm sorry.

957
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,641
Look, I know you hear this a lot,

958
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:52,394
but I really am your biggest fan. OK?

959
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,105
And I killed all those people,
just like you asked.

960
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:57,566
Did you enjoy it?

961
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:01,403
Well, yeah,

962
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,405
very much.

963
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,656
You know, it's always been a fantasy
of mine to kill someone.

964
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:09,661
And...

965
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,373
For a kid who never
had anywhere to belong,

966
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:18,253
who didn't want to end up like everybody
fucking else in this shithole world,

967
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:20,964
I'm sorry for cussing sir,
but you gave me someone to be.

968
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:24,676
So you decided to be me.

969
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:25,635
That's fucking pathetic.

970
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,595
Ruth!

971
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:28,555
Wait, wait, no, no,

972
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,849
Wait, please, please,
no, no, JaxPro, please!

973
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:31,558
Wait!

974
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,768
No, no, no, no, no!

975
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:40,650
What's up, guys?

976
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:45,071
Welcome to Game eight,
one of you will win it all.

977
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:47,949
The other will lose their life

978
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:50,577
as soon as this is over.

979
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:54,539
Everything will be uploaded to my channel
to be seen by hundreds

980
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:56,624
of millions of people.

981
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:58,877
They'll see what you've been through.

982
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:03,131
The police will ask
all sorts of questions, but I'll be gone.

983
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:06,510
The final game starts now.

984
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,012
Capture the flag.

985
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,097
The rules are simple.

986
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,018
The first person
to hold the flag for three seconds wins.

987
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,230
You cannot kill
or knock out the other contestant.

988
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:21,775
If you do, you will be eliminated.

989
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:25,195
And remember, play smart.

990
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,697
Good luck.

991
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:31,201
Five.

992
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,536
Four.

993
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,204
Three.

994
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:35,747
Two,

995
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:37,666
One.

996
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,796
Here goes nothing.

997
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:57,894
Hey!

998
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,147
Let go, Carrie.

999
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,650
Everything I did was for this moment.

1000
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,819
You will not take this from me.

1001
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,195
He's going to knock her out.

1002
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:07,862
Wait.

1003
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:10,407
I have a clear shot right now.

1004
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,409
Not yet.

1005
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:15,203
You played well. Let it go.

1006
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:16,830
It's nothing personal.

1007
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:45,478
Congratulations! You're the
official winner of the OctoGames!

1008
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:56,174
Hello?

1009
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:04,641
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

1010
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:07,435
You're safe now,

1011
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:08,812
You won.

1012
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:13,942
Where am I?

1013
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:16,528
Your new home.

1014
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:21,032
The video has been uploaded.

1015
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:23,743
The police will likely start

1016
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,703
an investigation.

1017
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:28,873
Carrie.

1018
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,294
What you do next

1019
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,547
is up to you.

1020
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,138
Wait.

1021
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:49,394
Who are you?

1022
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:06,744
Be careful.

1023
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,457
I'm still rooting for you.

1024
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:39,777
911, what's your emergency?

1025
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:51,289
Hey, did you watch the song I just posted?

1026
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,918
Yeah, 200,000 views in one night,
I mean, that's amazing.

1027
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:56,127
How do you feel?

1028
01:26:57,837 --> 01:27:00,256
You mean... To be the OctoGames girl?

1029
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,217
Yeah, but people are watching.

1030
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:05,720
That's what she wanted, isn't it?

1031
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,849
I guess I really don't know anymore.

1032
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,143
Hey, did you see the video I sent you?

1033
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,519
No, not yet.

1034
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,563
Watch it and call me back.

1035
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:16,856
Ok.

1036
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:22,945
What is up, you guys,

1037
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:26,824
it is your boy, Chip Chip Chippy McDaniel
here coming at you with another video.

1038
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,953
I'm here, girlfriend. Ruth!

1039
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:35,249
We're going to try candies from all
over the world, including Japan! Kawaii!

1040
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:38,044
But first,
we're filming from a secure compound.

1041
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:40,088
You know what's not
secure? Your wi-fi at a...
