Are you okay?

Probably just some hunters.

00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,723
It's not like
it's permanent.

518
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,924
I'm not actually--

519
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,459
it's not like
I'm living here.

520
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:50,828
Do you remember
Haley's dog missie?

521
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,464
I mean,
she loved that dog.

522
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,833
We all did, I guess.

523
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:58,836
It was so dumb.

524
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:00,771
It was just
the dumbest dog.

525
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,873
You remember?

526
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,979
I mean, you know,
we treated it like
a normal dog.

527
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,949
We petted it
and fed it,

528
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:14,518
took it to the vet
when it got sick, but...

529
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,254
We all knew--

530
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,257
everybody knew
that there was no hope.

531
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,162
And then one day
missie got hit by a car.

532
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,798
So sad, right?

533
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,803
No. nobody cried.

534
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:35,105
We didn't even
blink an eye.

535
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:39,510
It's not that
we weren't sad.

536
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:41,912
We didn't care.

537
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,316
Everyone expected
that dumb dog to die
a stupid death,

538
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,318
so when it did--

539
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,923
( chuckles )
no, don't cry
over that.

540
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:57,828
Nobody cares
when a dumb bitch
fails at life.

541
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:03,567
Save your tears for something
that matters, rae.

542

I'm sure

- It's like 15 miles.
- They took the car.

549

Do you think
this is like...

550
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,230
A disease breakout
or something?

551
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:34,932
Like with that movie

- or something?
- I don't know.

I don't think so, though.

But how do you know?
I mean, I have this headache.

555

but to just wait.

693
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,610
Nobody goes outside.

694
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:54,878
Okay?

695
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,614
Yeah, the train--
the train--

696
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,883
it could have been
carrying a disease.

697
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:02,085
Scientists, they work
on diseases all the time.

698
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:04,521
I doubt the disease
travels by train.

699
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:05,955
Oh, I'm sorry, Elise.

700
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,124
Are you some sort of viral
transportation expert now?

701
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,660
- You know what, Angela?
Could you just please--
- Angie, in all seriousness,

702
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:12,929
if it was
a contagious disease...

703
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:16,132
We'd all be infected
by now.

704
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,670
You don't know that.
You don't know.

705
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,672
You don't know that.

706
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:25,141
( Coughing )

707
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,277
Do we have any medicine?

708
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:30,647
What, like anti-fog medicine?

709
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,615
Let's go raid
the bathrooms.

710
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:33,716
All right.

711
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,253
<i>( Gunshot )</i>

712
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:41,324
- What was that?
- ( Laughing )
nothing, I'm sure.

713
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:44,193
Maybe it was one
of those hunters.

714
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:46,563
Jordin, honey,

715
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:50,233
if there were any of those
dumb-ass, inbred rednecks

716
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,735
<i>still out there,</i>
<i>they'd all be dead by now.</i>

717
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,704
( Coughs )

718
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,029
Well, it's not much.

719
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,297
At all.

720
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,103
Hey, don't use it all.

721
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,671
We might need
to ration that.

722
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:32,609
I know.

723
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:33,910
My throat's just
a little dry.

724
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:35,345
Honestly, we might--

725
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:36,913
we don't even know
if it's any good.

726
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:39,082
Then why did you
even bring it out here?

727
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:42,952
( Coughs )

728
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:47,056
Ugh, I think this stuff
might be bad.

729
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,191
Let me see that.

730
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:50,126
It burns a little
when it goes down,

731
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,394
<i>but I think</i>
<i>it might work.</i>

732
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,630
- Here.
- um, I think maybe

733
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,965
we should use different spoons.
You know...

734
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:56,966
- Just in case.
- Mmm.

735
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:00,003
( Wheezing )

736
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:13,416
Come on, Kimmy.

737
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:16,052
Come on.

738
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,820
This will make you
feel better.

739
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,325
Come on, this will
make you feel better.

740
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,663
( Wheezes, coughs )

741
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,087
Elise:
<i>oh my god.</i>

742
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:52,789
Angela: what?

743
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,828
( Sizzling )

744
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,365
Angela:
<i>ew, fucking ew.</i>

745
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,338
I guess we don't have
to worry about

746
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,075
feeding the fish anymore.

747
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,710
Maybe we should
flush 'em.

748
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:16,479
I'm not fucking
touching them.

749
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:18,381
( Gasps )
it's ringing!

750
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,821
( Sighs )
it's just a recording.

751
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:26,489
- ( Sighs )
- ( beeps )

752
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:28,091
Male voice:
<i>All lines are</i>
<i>currently occupied</i>

753
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:29,792
<i>in the sinclair valley area.</i>

754
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:31,394
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

755
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,831
<i>Do not, under any</i>
<i>circumstances, go outside.</i>

756
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,200
<i>At this time, rescue teams</i>
<i>are making their way</i>

757
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:39,102
<i>through the valley.</i>
<i>All lines--</i>

758
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:42,405
well, I guess that means
that they know we're out here.

759
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,273
Could have been
recorded hours ago.

760
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:45,742
They said stay dry.

761
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:48,010
So it's gotta be
some sort of...

762
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:49,846
Chemical reaction
or something--

763
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:52,148
oh god, great.
Community college lessons.

764
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,816
High school.

765
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:55,852
It's pretty basic
chemistry, actually.

766
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:59,789
I'm sorry,
i wasn't such a nerd
in high school, okay?

767
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,891
Elise:
where the fuck
are the rescue teams?

768
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,361
Maybe no one's coming.

769
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,429
No.

770
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:08,831
They're coming.

771
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,768
And I'm sure
that they're checking

772
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,102
every single house.

773
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,371
That could take forever.

774
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:18,841
Yeah, what do you--
what do you suggest
we do then, rae?

775
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,243
We wait.

776
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,412
They'll come.

777
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,916

778
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,322
<i>( Coughing continues )</i>

779
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,896
We wait, ladies.

780
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,267
<i>And that's all</i>
<i>that we can do.</i>

781
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,540
Elise:
<i>how's Kimmy?</i>

782
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:52,475
She's fine.

783
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,512
She's sleeping
peacefully...

784
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,315
For now.

785
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,017
Angela:
wish I was.

786
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:05,154
( Elise clears throat )
oh god.

787
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,323
I think I could
fall asleep
standing up.

788
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,892
( Rae laughs )

789
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:13,930
I don't think that's such
a good idea right now.

790
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,565
What?

791
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:18,534
Look, we were--

792
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:21,437
we were up late
last night partying

793
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,172
and, uh...

794
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,342
It's not like we're going
anywhere anytime soon.

795
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,111
What's the big deal
with a little nap?

796
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:33,516
I don't think last night's
what's making us so sleepy.

797
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,218
Nobody's coming.

798
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,588
It takes time, jordin.

<i>They're coming.</i>

800
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:43,893
I'm gonna go
lay down for a little.

801
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:47,063
I'm exhausted

802
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:49,165
and I'm getting married.

803
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,334
No one has a problem
with that, do they?

804
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,107
I'm with you, rae.

805
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:01,110

that I'm gonna be

- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm, oh, yeah.

sitting down too long.

- We just need some coffee.
- Yes.

813
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:17,960
Okay.

lots of sugar.

This is all your fault.

819
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,098
You should have been
watching the road.

for supplies.
- Don't move!

1052
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:02,057

1053
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,591
Away from...

1054
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,527
The haze.

1055
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:07,395
What the hell were you
doing out there?

1056
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:10,465
I was hunting...

1057
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,267

look at my rifle.

1060
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,741
So where's your dog now?

1061
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:22,177
Is he still out there?

1062
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,081

1067

Does anyone...

1068
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:51,072
Happen to have

( Angela coughs )

1070
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,046
I always prided
myself on being
prepared for anything.

1071
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,115
I have a bomb shelter,

1072
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:02,117
<i>I got army supplies</i>

1073
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:04,119

1074

How do you prepare
for this?

1075
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:09,024
You can't.

1076
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,761

1082
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:38,086

Where are your clothes,
Howard?

1084
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:41,756
Uh...

1085
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,525
Okay.

1086
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:45,560
I know this looks
a little ridiculous
right now,

1087
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,063
but I had to get out of those
as quick as I could.

1088
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:49,564
I was starting to sweat.

1089
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:53,234
And you do not want this stuff
on you if you're wet.

1090
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,702
You gotta stay dry.

1091
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,571
Weren't you wearing
a gas mask?

1092
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,207
Yeah, that's the only thing
that kept me alive out there,

1093
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:01,209
<i>but the plastic</i>
<i>started to melt.</i>

1094
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:04,746
It's no good anymore,
not enough to get me home.

1095
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:07,148
<i>And I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>the filter's shot.</i>

1096
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,384
I started tasting
the chemicals.

1097
01:08:09,386 --> 01:08:11,152
And then I saw this place.

1098
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:14,355
- I'm jordin.
- Jesus, jordin!

1099
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:16,591
Can we put
a fucking bell

1100
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:17,759

1101
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:20,428
Nice to meet you,
jordin.

1102
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,563
Howard.

1103

How did you
even get in?

1108
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:44,886
The door
in the back
was open.

1109
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:46,721
I came up
through the basement.

( Scoffs )

1111
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:53,628
I was just gonna go
yell at Kimmy

1112
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,297
for not locking the door
like I told her to.

1113
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,140
Hey, Angie, maybe you
should let Howard

1114
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:07,142
- have his gun back--
- no!

1115
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,277
It's just really comforting.
That's it.

1116
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,280
It's okay.

1117
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:16,251
I fired the last
of my shells hours ago.

1118
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,322
Why?

1119
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,225
Why did I fire it?

1120
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:26,728
( Sighs )

1121
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:30,865
Um, last time--
to attract attention.

1122
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:32,300
Get some help.

1123
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:34,502

1124
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:42,177

1131
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,667

01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:07,869
what that feels like.

1133
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,205

the bathroom.

1134

<i>- Why?</i>

1137
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:37,298

Just so you could
use him right away.

01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:15,703
That's very thoughtful.

Don't give up yet,

I may know a way
out of this mess.

1156
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:35,056
You can get us

- It's broken down, but--
- and you can fix it?

1161
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:47,302

I think I know what's
wrong with it.

an extremely negligent
