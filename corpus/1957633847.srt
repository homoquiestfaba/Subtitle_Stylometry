NARRATOR: Los
 Angeles, California,

7
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,980
nestled in its rolling hills are
 countless multimillion dollar

8
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,000
homes, glamorous
 shopping districts,

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,630
and the most beautiful
 people on earth.

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,140
Most LA natives enjoy this
 incomparable prosperity

11
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,110
without regard for
 those less fortunate.

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,450
But this month, Community
 Interest Programming caught up

13
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,200
with two Angelenos who realize
 that with great privilege

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,760
comes great responsibility and
 want to give something back.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, James and I were
 married about a year ago.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,650
And since then, we've
 been very blessed.

17
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,430
James makes a lot of
 money, so we're very

18
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,310
well taken care of financially.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,640
We're happy, but I think we
 felt like something was missing.

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,430
JAMES: I think for me that
 thing that was missing

21
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,940
was my beautiful Jenna.

22
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,170
I think Jenna's always been
 a very charitable person.

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,720
She's done a lot
 of volunteer work.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,960
She has a very big heart.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,950
That's one of the things
 I really love about her.

26
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,690
And when we got married I
 thought, now that we're getting

27
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,430
married, maybe this is something
 we could do together as a team

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,640
to help make the
 world a better place.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,080
So we decided that we
 wanted to start a charity.

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,880
We just didn't know for who.

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,100
And we actually-- I
 mean this sounds silly,

32
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,260
but we actually
 made a list of all

33
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,130
the different
 charitable organizations

34
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,770
that we might deal with.

35
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,400
It was a very, very sad list.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,290
There's the cancer
 people, and diabetes,

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,740
which is a horrible disease,
 and the Heart Foundation--

38
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,650
JENNA: AIDS babies.

39
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,450
JAMES: --AIDS babies,
 crack babies, the NAACP--

40
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,250
JENNA: Gay men.

41
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,570
JAMES: Right, them.

42
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,720
There's the kids with
 the-- what do you call--

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,670
the-- you know what I'm--
 the rabbit lipped kids.

44
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,470
Cleft palates.

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,830
The kids with
 the cleft palates.

46
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,480
There's an organization out
 there actually dedicated

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,620
to sewing their lips back
 together so that they

48
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,150
can live a normal life.

49
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,290
And there's also the
 conjoined twins, which are

50
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,310
like-- those are Siamese twins.

51
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,760
And I remember when I was a
 kid, I thought that it would be

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,550
really awesome to
 have a conjoined twin,

53
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,330
because you'd always have a
 playmate, somebody to hang

54
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,450
out with no matter what.

55
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,950
You'd never be lonely.

56
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,870
But the reality is much
 more grim than that.

57
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,040
It gets old very
 quickly, and it's

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,910
hard to maneuver through, like,
 a restaurant, or whatever.

59
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,060
You knock over stuff a lot.

60
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,620
JENNA: So finally, we
 came to a group that

61
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,330
really touched very deeply.

62
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,200
JAMES: And that was--

63
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,050
That was the homeless.

64
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,530
The homeless-- the homeless.

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,430
NARRATOR: Since the
 Great Depression,

66
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,360
America has been plagued by
 the plight of the homeless.

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,100
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's
 New Deal started a long line

68
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,250
of well-intended,
 expensive government

69
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,590
and charitable programs aimed
 at giving the homeless American

70
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,470
a pull up by his bootstraps,
 but none of these

71
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,120
has been enough to truly
 and permanently change

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,440
the lives of the homeless.

73
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,160
James and Jenna Gunn had
 a groundbreaking answer.

--Each week, we provide homeless
 individuals with a lollipop.

76
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,920
But they're not just any
 lollipop, which would be great.

77
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,830
Our lollipops feature uplifting
 slogans on the wrapper,

78
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,160
and each wrapper features some
 of James's original artwork.

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,670
Yeah, um, I think
 that with God's help

80
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,440
I'm able to create
 very powerful artworks

81
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,400
that will help to
 make a real change

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,100
in the homeless community.

83
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,390
That a homeless person might
 see one of my artworks,

84
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,390
and it might change their
 worthless life into a life that

85
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,750
has meaning-- transformation--
 that the lollipops of Lollilove

86
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,010
may propel homeless
 people into going out

87
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,770
and to doing something
 good with their lives,

88
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,660
feeling good about themselves,
 perhaps getting a job,

89

maybe using birth control,
 all these types of things--

I'll share something with you.

92

When I was five years old, I had
 a defining moment in my life.

 I saw my own artwork.

 their good intentions,

 married couple in Los Angeles

actually start an
 effective charity?

98

The first thing
 that we need to do

99
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,640
is to find a corporate sponsor.

100
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,690
A corporate sponsor brings
 a level of prestige.

You want to get another
 company involved in you,

102

 knows that you're a big shot.

Lollilove, or Nike a proud
 sponsor of Lollilove?

107
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,890
Oh, good, well I-- yes, I'm
 working with a new group.

108
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,050
It's a brand new charity
 completely different than

109
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,600
anything I've ever done before.

It's called Lollilove.

111
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,580
I think that what
 we're going to find

112
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,880
is when I get on the
 phones, something magical

113
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,180
is going to happen.

 going to respond to me.

 respond to Lollilove.

They told her that
 she was disgusting,

166
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,460
and the idea for
 Lollilove was demeaning.

 a good sign, myself.

him a sick son of a bitch?

177
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,010
And now he's the world's
 biggest-selling novelist.

178
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,900
You know what I mean?

179
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,700
So I don't know.

180
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,420
Somebody called Jenna
 a [BLEEP] last weekend.

181
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,150
And she was about to cry.

182
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,970
But man, I'm like, hey,
 you know, that's good.

183
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,770
That's awesome.

184
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,550
I certainly think
 that's a good sign.

185
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,640
That's a great sign.

186
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,380
I see myself as, like,
 the Martha Stewart

187
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,370
of charity events planning.

188
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,270
I want to take it up
 a notch, you know?

189
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,430
I don't want to start a
 charity just because something

190
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,860
bad happened to me.

191
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,960
Oh no, I got breast cancer.

192
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,490
Oh no, my kid was kidnapped.

193
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,900
Let me start a TV show.

194
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,920
It's not about me.

195
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,170
It's about the people.

196
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,050
It's about the people
 who are suffering.

197
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,410
And if there's a
 way that I can get

198
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,410
attention for myself
 and Lollilove,

199
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,080
that's what I'm about

200
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,030
I don't know if you
 know this about me,

201
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,040
but I used to be a model.

202
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,210
That industry was so selfish
 that I had to get out of it.

203
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,960
That is why today I want
 to be famous for being

204
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,140
a charity events planner.

205
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,950
Oh god.

206
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,840
Personally, I don't
 think-- I don't think I get

207
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,540
a lot out of doing my artwork.

208
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,990
I mean, personally, you know,
 it like saps me of my life,

209
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,360
myself, my being.

210
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,390
It's like-- it's like I take
 something out of myself,

211
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,030
and I put it into
 the art, you know?

212
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,580
And then it's gone
 from me, you know?

213
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,190
And I guess it does
 something for someone else,

214
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,490
but it just saps me of my
 energy and makes me weaker.

215
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,290
So it's hard.

216
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,700
It's a hard, hard process.

217
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,000
It's just like pushing
 at me, man, all the time.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,350
And I really can't think of
 much else but Jesus Christ.

219
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,400
He gave himself.

220
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,880
And that's what
 I do with my art.

221
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,330
The only difference is is that
 Jesus is a totally made up guy,

222
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,810
and I'm completely real.

223
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,240
I really am feeling this.

224
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,760
You read his words in the book.

225
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,560
This is me.

226
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,360
This is real.

227
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,560
And I like to, uh,
 look at the canvas

228
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,870
and ask it what it needs.

229
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,930
I don't like to-- it doesn't--
 I don't think something.

230
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:12,570
It's like I ask the
 canvas, what do you need?

231
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,690
And I try to, like, you
 know-- I just try to feel it.

232
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,230
Feel it, and I try
 to, like, pull it up.

233
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,720
You know what I mean?

234
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,570
[MUSIC PLAYING]

235
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,250
[GROANING]

236
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,050
What am I feeling?

237
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,480
It's like I see colors.

238
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,400
I see a little yellow over here.

239
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,010
That's right-- a little
 yellow bird singing, singing

240
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,430
the song right down here.

241
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,080
I like to pull it up.

242
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,720
Pull up some-- co-- what's?

243
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,500
I see a line of blue.

244
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,900
Pull it up out of
 there, feel it come

245
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,050
up through me-- through me.

246
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,970
Do you know who I am?

247
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,080
Do you know who
 you're talking to?

248
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,020
I am an artist.

249
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,350
I am a creator.

250
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,150
Pull it up.

251
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,310
Come on-- blue, blue, blue.

252
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,120
Sorry, but people are
 being really mean to me.

253
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,640
I'm not having any
 luck with anything.

254
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,440
I can't get anyone--

255
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,280
Honey, honey, honey, how many
 times have I told you this

256
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,310
is my private creative area?

257
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,380
This is for me, alone.

258
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,350
And I've told you a million
 times not to be coming out here

259
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,150
while I'm doing this, all right?

260
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,610
How are you-- you're really--
 -I'm sorry.

261
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,280
- --going to ruin it.
 -No, you're right.

262
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,040
-That's one homeless--
 -I'm sorry.

263
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,940
--person you just killed.

264
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,770
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,490
So um, Jenna is my
 very best friend.

266
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,260
And we met in boarding school.

267
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,650
And we just-- we love to
 do this volunteer thing.

268
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,400
JENNA: Oh no, we're just
 sitting here in the park.

269
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,260
We're doing the flyers today.

270
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,060
I'm with Sarah.

271
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,580
Say hi to Sarah.

272
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,690
Hi.

273
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,960
Hey!

274
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,080
We came to the park today to
 just stay in the public eye,

275
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,230
maybe find a corporate sponsor.

276
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,370
SARAH: Lollilove,

277
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,100
JENNA: Lollilove-- help
 us help the homeless.

278
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,900
BOTH: Lollilove!

279
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,900
Making a difference!

280
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,830
Come take a flyer!

281
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,630
Lollilove.

282
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,710
Lollilove.

283
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,850
Lollilove-- help us
 help the homeless.

284
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,040
Hi!

285
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,840
Make a difference!

286
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,860
Lollilove.

287
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,760
Lollilove.

288
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,370
Lollilove.

289
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,380
Oh, hey, are you and Peter
 coming to that benefit

290
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,290
at the Ritz this weekend?

291
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,720
Oh, yeah, definitely.

292
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
Oh good.

293
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,430
Are you guys going to go?

294
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,370
I think so.

295
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,360
We go every year.

296
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,270
Hey, pretty ladies.

297
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,070
Hey, honey.

298
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm going to go
 get a frappuccino.

299
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,060
You guys want anything?

300
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,290
SARAH: Oh, I would
 love a Diet Coke.

301
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,190
JAMES: Diet Coke, OK.

302
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,080
Same for me.

303
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,310
Running out of Kleenexes.

304
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,470
Hey, listen, we're going
 to that benefit at the Ritz

305
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,500
this weekend, right?

306
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,200
Baby, I don't want to
 go with those people.

307
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,980
They are so out of
 touch with reality.

308
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,270
Can you put the rest of
 this stuff back for me?

309
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,080
Yeah, I got it.

310
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,440
Thanks.

311
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,480
JENNA: It's true.

312
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,070
Doing charity work, you can get
 something out of it personally,

313
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,960
and that is an attractive thing.

314
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,390
Like for me, I have to confront
 my feelings about our wealth.

315
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,260
Like, when I see a homeless
 person, I want to run away.

316
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,670
I don't want to look
 at that, and that's

317
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,400
because I don't want to have
 to think about how very wealthy

318
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,200
we are.

319
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,830
With James, I mean like James
 has his thing with germs.

320
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,280
And if we're going
 to do this, we're

321
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,310
going to have to confront that.

322
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,340
I mean, if we do it, you're
 going to have to confront that.

323
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,580
Well, no, no, I mean,
 I agree with you.

324
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,400
I see a homeless person,
 and I want to run away.

325
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,270
But the germ thing--
 that's not-- I

326
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,230
don't think that's exactly
 something that I need

327
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,780
to confront, because
 there's a way around it,

328
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,790
like, by wearing gloves.

329
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,200
So, man, this is like-- I got
 a-- I went to the mall today,

330
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,210
and I touched the
 escalator rail by accident.

331
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,710
Normally, I stand right in the
 middle and try to avoid it,

332
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,430
but I touched it with this hand.

333
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,460
And I got it all over me.

334
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,260
It's an awareness.

335
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,400
I have an awareness of germs
 other people don't have.

336
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,710
But it's a blessing.

337
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,530
It's a-- I have a second
 sight when it comes

338
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,570
to germs, which protects me.

339
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,200
I'll probably live to be
 a very old man because I

340
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,500
don't touch dirty things.

341
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,010
It's just Jenna thinks I'm
 a little bit-- I don't know.

342
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,330
She doesn't like the fact
 that I wash my hands so much,

343
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,160
but it's not like I'm
 obsessive or anything.

344
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,900
It's just that there's
 a lot of things

345
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,790
out there that you can catch--
 E. coli and Lyme disease

346
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,330
and salmonella
 and mycobacterium,

347
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,460
tuberculosis-- it's just-- there
 is germs all over the place,

348
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,260
you know.

349
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,720
And that's-- I got to admit,
 that's the hardest thing about

350
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,940
working with the homeless is
 that, you know, they got the E.

351
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,960
coli I all over them.

352
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,880
They're used to it.

353
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,690
They've had it in
 them for generations.

354
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,980
It doesn't affect them anymore.

355
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,230
They eat it in their food.

356
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,690
They sleep on it.

357
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,490
And you know, to touch one
 of those guys, it's like,

358
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,420
can you imagine the
 amount of germs in one

359
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,910

360
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,190
It's just like a
 [BLEEP] Petri dish.

 to find financial backing,

362
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,750
James and Jenna Gunn
 approached their circle

JENNA: Oh, so the other
 thing is how expensive

367
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,250
it is to run it as charity.

368
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,240
I mean, like, uh-- like the
 ribbon that we're using-- we're

369
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,470
putting bows on each
 lollipop, and the ribbon

370
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,140
alone cost $15,000.

371
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,230
And the paper is the finest
 handwoven paper you can get,

372
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,070
imported from Bali.

373
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,500
You can tell it's really
 good, because it's

374
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,190
got all the little
 squiggly threads in it.

375
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,950
That's how you tell good paper.

376
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,300
Cost about $80,000.

377
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,660
Wait, is it like, um, cloth?

378
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,890
No, it's paper.

379
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,910
Well, I have a-- OK, since
 you're going to spending so

380
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,000
much money on that, and you're
 going to be wrapping it,

381
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,200
why don't you use it to kill
 two birds with one stone?

382
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,190
-Great idea.
 -Maybe it's a--

383
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,990
Great idea, great idea.

384
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,060
Use it as, like, a napkin.

385
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,500
JASON: Oh my god,
 that's a great idea.

386
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,640
And then after
 eating [INAUDIBLE]

387
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,660
You hear that?

388
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,460
It's just great.

389
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,550
Or you know what?

390
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,970
I hate to say while we eat.

391
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,220
But maybe they use
 it as toilet paper.

392
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,850
That is a gr-- toilet paper.

393
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,640
Why don't you guys
 just use toilet paper?

394
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,570
Yeah, I mean, really.
 JASON: Put a little--

395
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,690
LINDA: You just draw
 the little picture.

396
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:52,750
JASON: Yeah.

397
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,200
LINDA: Make sure it's not--
 the paint doesn't run,

398
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,000
and then they--

399
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,420
No, the thing is is that
 they're going to want to save

400
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,700
the artwork, so they can put
 it on the wall next to them

401
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,500
and look at it.

 my show last year

407

at Merry Karnowsky Gallery.

You really enjoyed it.

Oh, right, you gave
 us, uh, that thing.

410
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,720
It's up in the living room.

That was-- that was--

Uh, well, listen, you guys
 have a lot of great ideas.

425
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,110
And um-- and we can tell you're
 really fired up about the idea.

426

And--

427
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,350
And one of the reasons we
 asked you guys to come-- I

428
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,820
know we don't know
 you that well,

429
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,140
but we do consider you our
 best and our dearest friends.

430
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,940
Wow.

 definitely friends, yeah.

 touches me deeply.

And so--

438
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,030
Well, we would,
 um-- we would like

439
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,450
to offer you the opportunity to
 make a financial contribution

440
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,810
to Lollilove.

441
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,060
That's so-- I would love to.

442
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,480
I would love you.

443
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,460
The operation will
 cost about $250,000.

LINDA: Whoa, come on, now, guys.

446
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,100
$250,000, James.

447
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,010
James, for lollipops.

448
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,950
You guys can't be serious.

449
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,100
These are for homeless
 people, right?

450
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,790
Why don't you just
 give them the $250,000?

451
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, maybe
 then you-- that's-- good point,

452
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,710
Linda, really good point.

453
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,870
But I-- maybe you should
 consider a smaller

454
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,440
contribution, say $225,000?

455
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,310
The answer is no.

456
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,070
I think the idea is a
 little bit ridiculous.

457
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,070
And I think if you really want
 to give something to charity,

458
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,010
just give those
 people the $250,000.

459
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,570
So like, $150,000?

460
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,480
LINDA: No.

461

462
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,200
$100,000.

463
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,170
LINDA: No, I'm not giving
 you a single penny.

464
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,970
$125,000.

465

 to-- you're going

--and then ask for $250,000
 out of our pockets to hand

suckers out to homeless people?

471
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,590

 you're open to the idea,

472

but you're not convinced.

473
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,930

But to a homeless
 person, he looks at this,

and I don't want to get
 too intellectual on you,

 a mirror of his inner psyche.

 wow, this is what I look like.

He's Latino.

778
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,300
You can tell he is because
 he's wearing a sombrero

779
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,460
and a poncho, as Latinos do.

 own random sampling

 that live, like, on my block.

 are Latino-- 75%.

I mean, the one guy is black.

He could be, like, a
 dark-colored Latino.

But that wouldn't
 really make any sense,

789

because that would mean 100%
 of homeless people are Latino.

 this guy named Mustafa.

He's a Muslim.

He's somebody who's
 anti-terrorism.

 had seen Mustafa giving them

 they got in those planes,

Why don't you let me
 wear some of those?

 they're girl gloves.

 wear all this stuff, OK,

because God will protect you.

 in my brain to wear

 things on that day--

1386
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:32,480
I realized that Jenna could have
 been raped by that bum that day

 again and again.

1390
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,370
And so I did a
 little artistic essay

1391
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:46,340
with Jenna getting raped by
 that bum in various positions

1392
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,300
of the Kama Sutra.

1393
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,480
It covers three walls.

1394
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,100
And-- and it's really
 gotten a lot of press--

1395
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,930
not all of it good
 press-- but as you know,

1396
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,710
there's no such
 thing as bad press.

1397
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:00,600
JENNA: Yeah, I don't think
 of this as a failure--

1398
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,470
JAMES: No way--

1399
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,570
-- no, because we got a lot
 of great things out of it.

1400
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:05,950
Um, I think one of
 the great things

1401
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,490
that we got out of it
 is this documentary--

1402
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:08,320
Absolutely.

1403
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,920
--which is
 undoubtedly going to go

1404
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,040
on to inspire a lot
 of other people to do

1405
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,080
a lot of other great things.

1406
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,320
I think this
 documentary is going

1407
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,920
to inspire more
 people than Lollilove

1408
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,580
was going to begin with.

1409
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,330
And you know, you think back
 to, like, the Holocaust--

1410
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:24,060
a terrible, terrible time?

1411
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:24,860
Yes.

1412
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,570
Worth it?

1413
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:30,730
Perhaps, because of all the
 great Academy Award-winning

1414
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:34,210
documentaries that have been
 made about the Holocaust,

1415
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,580
all the people that have gone to
 the theater all over the world

1416
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,290
and cried their eyes while
 watching about the plight

1417
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:40,850
of those poor people.

1418
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,370
And that would have
 never happened--

1419
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:43,910
"Schindler's List" would
 have never happened--

1420
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:44,920
without the Holocaust.

1421
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,720
Can you imagine if "Schindler's
 List" never happened.

1422
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,260
Yeah, I mean it's-- Spielberg
 would have never won an Academy

1423
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,300
Award without the Holocaust.

1424
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:57,070
So everything works
 out in the end.

1425
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,100
A-plus, baby.

1426
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,420
Thank you.

1427
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:18,390
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1428
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,000
This piece in particular
 works really well,

1429
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,450
because I tested it on a
 number of homeless people

1430
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,180
that hang out around
 the shopping center

1431
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,180
where I go buy my groceries.

1432
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:45,800
And all of them were touched.

1433
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,950
They didn't necessarily say
 that, because some of them

1434
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:48,750
can't talk.

1435
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,740
They're like
 [NONSENSE] But they,

1436
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,290
uh-- they were very touched.

1437
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:56,760
For me, what I'm really into
 right now is helping people.

1438
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,730
And if that is going
 to put me in touch

1439
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,760
with certain celebrities,
 I can't help that.

1440
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,840
I mean, I would to get, like,
 Jason Priestley on our team.

1441
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,520
I mean, don't tell James,
 because he gets really jealous.

1442
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,630
But, um-- I don't
 know if you know this,

1443
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:13,530
but Jason Priestley
 hates homelessness.

1444
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,330
We would have so
 much to talk about.

1445
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:16,600
I mean--

1446
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,580
-Thanks, Jenna.
 -Thank you.

1447
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:18,580
-You were awesome.
 -Thank you.

1448
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,200
You were awesome.
 Thanks, James.

1449
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,000
Thank you.

1450
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,400
Thank you so much.

1451
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,430
I really appreciate
 what you said.

1452
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,920
Thank you for digging deep.

1453
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,960
I know that must
 have not been easy.

1454
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,460
I know it, because
 I've been there.

1455
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,260
You bet.

1456
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,870
OK, there it is.

1457
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,040
Thank you.
 -OK.

1458
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,030
And that's how we came up with
 an idea for an animated series.

1459
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:43,070
And it's going to be
 revolving around the character

1460
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:43,880
of Mustafa.

1461
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,660
And Mustafa's going
 to go around the world,

1462
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,830
and he's going to talk
 to different terrorists,

1463
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:51,260
and he's going to talk them
 out of that way of life.

1464
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:55,420
And, you know, there's-- it's
 not about becoming a Christian.

1465
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,910
It's just about how Jesus is
 more realistic than Allah.

1466
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:02,330
I want to also
 appeal to celebrities.

1467
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,500
We have some celebrity
 friends that I would

1468
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,290
like to try and get involved.

1469
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,750
I would like to
 have them maybe be

1470
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:12,170
spokespeople, perhaps do
 some of our television,

1471
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:13,770
print ads for us.

1472
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:16,680
But probably most of that
 stuff they're going to want

1473
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,210
me to do since it's my art.

1474
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,880
So probably most of the
 stuff, they're going

1475
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,830
to be interested me doing it.

1476
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:25,420
And then-- but I
 could probably have

1477
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,920
somebody like William
 Aames as my sidekick,

1478
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,380
or something, right?

1479
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,180
Yeah.

1480
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,090
Or John Schneider.

1481
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:34,640
I think it should
 be somebody of color,

1482
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,190
because I don't think we want
 it to just be white people.

1483
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:40,150
Like Whitney Houston
 could, you know--

1484
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,620
Oh my gosh, I would
 love to get, like,

1485
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:44,480
Halle Berry, because
 she's actually

1486
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,350
half-white and half-black.

1487
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:49,760
I'm trying to think of
 another black person.

1488
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,560
Um.

1489
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:54,970
Eddie Murphy.

1490
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:57,520
Mm-hm.

1491
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,820
Tyra Banks.

1492
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:01,310
Mm-hm.

1493
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,300
George Huff.

1494
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:07,870
Mexican people?

1495
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:10,370
Well, I-- there's still
 more black people left.

1496
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,190
Bill Cosby.

1497
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,070
But what about
 black people we know?

1498
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,450
Sorry.
