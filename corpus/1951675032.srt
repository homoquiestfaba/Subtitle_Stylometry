00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,641
<i>More murders in Juarez!</i>

2
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,872
<i>Juarez terrorized
by wave of killings!</i>

3
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,876
<i>Three more womens' bodies found!</i>

4
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,960
<i>More murders in Juarez!</i>

5
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,663
<i>Juarez terrorized
by wave of killings!</i>

6
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,066
<i>Three more womens' bodies found!</i>

7
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:43,263
<i>Get the truth,
read about it in El Sol.</i>

8
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,194
MORE MURDERS IN JUAREZ!

9
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:12,599
Out of the way!
Confiscate all these newspapers!

10
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,336
Get all this trash out of here!

11
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,999
Move it! Take it all!

12
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,670
<i>The first shift is now ending.</i>

13
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,680
Thank goodness we're done.
I'm so tired.

14
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,000
I have to go downtown
to buy my sister a gift.

15
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,136
What are you going to get her?

16
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,071
A doll.

17
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:16,856
- How much for the doll?
- Twenty. I have different colors.

18
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,791
- Will you take less?
- Fifteen.

19
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,428
Fine. I'll take it.

20
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,786
Stop!

21
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,760
- Are you going to Colonia Anapara?
- Yes. Have a seat.

22
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,962
Do you mind if I get some gas?

23
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,097
No, that's okay.

24
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,839
Yes.

25
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,407
There is no gas station.

26
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,212
Everything is alright.
Don't be afraid.

27
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,401
Stop! I don't want
to have to kill you!

28
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,849
Help me, please! Help me!

29
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,192
<i>Over the last few years...</i>

30
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,329
<i>375 Mexican women
have been raped and murdered.</i>

31
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,032
<i>An additional 700 Mexican women
are still missing.</i>

32
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,024
No one knows who,
no one knows why.

33
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,971
You wanna find out?

34
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,241
- Nobody gives a shit about Mexico.
- Lf you give a shit, they will.

35
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,610
- Okay!
- Just get to the heart of the story!

36
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,612
<i>You used to work
for the El Paso Courier, right?</i>

37
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,747
- What does that have to do with it?
- You speak enough Spanish.

38
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,016
I don't speak Spanish.
I don't know anything about Mexico.

39
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,218
<i>- What was the name of your partner?
- Diaz.</i>

40
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,554
Alfonso Diaz. You guys
were wonderful together.

41
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,957
<i>You won the JFK medal, right?
I'm really trying to help you out.</i>

42
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,461
<i>- But you're so goddamned mighty!
- All right!</i>

43
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,496
<i>I'll do it. But when I do...</i>

44
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,021
<i>I want the foreign
correspondence job. Deal?</i>

45
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,965
Yeah, why not?

46
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,464
<i>I'll leave tonight.</i>

47
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,661
Ma'am? We've arrived.

48
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,175
<i>How are you, Lauren?
This is Frank.</i>

49
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,145
<i>- Hey, Frank.
- I thought I'd give you the heads-up.</i>

50
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,180
<i>George is looking for you.
He's pissed.</i>

51
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,382
<i>You were supposed to call him
the second you landed in Juarez.</i>

52
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,112
Hope you're having a blast down there.
Hold on for Frank.

53
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,121
What the hell is going on?

54
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,491
George. Did you know that they are
claiming that the murders are solved?

55
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:37,724
The police have some guy in custody.
Some Egyptian guy. His name is...

56
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,899
Al-Awar.

57
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,503
<i>It's bullshit. It's different
patterns with the different victims.</i>

58
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,305
Some are strangled
with shoelaces.

59
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,241
Others have bite marks
on their breasts.

60
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,844
<i>- You know, it's not anything.
- It sounds you're onto something...</i>

61
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,881
<i>Don't forget what you promised me.
I want the foreign correspondent job.</i>

62
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,251
One job at a time, kid.
You stay focused.

63
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,219
We'll talk about it
when you get home.

64
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:01,280
Hi, can I speak
to Alfonso Diaz, please?

65
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,475
This is the Chicago Sentinel.

66
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,720
<i>- Diaz?
- Who's this?</i>

67
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,352
This is Lauren.

68
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,196
Lauren Adrian?
Remember?

69
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,235
<i>- Lauren?
- Yeah.</i>

70
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,227
<i>I mean, it can't be.</i>

71
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,301
<i>Where are you calling from?
Chicago?</i>

72
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,302
Actually I'm here.

73
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,804
I'm in Juarez.

74
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:17,847
My...

75
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,289
Fuck.

76
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,339
Excuse me? Excuse me?

77
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,534
Lotte Bravo?

78
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,671
<i>Straight? Okay.
Gracias.</i>

79
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,418
Lauren? Is that you?

80
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,616
It's me.

81
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,852
It's you.

82
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,598
I can't believe it.

83
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,726
- You look good.
- You look good, too.

84
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,372
I was surprised when you called.
I thought I'd never see you again.

85
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:45,400
Maybe you're on CNN
and not here in Juarez.

86
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,611
It has been a long time,
hasn't it?

87
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,989
- What are they doing?
- They're looking for bodies.

88
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,490
Their daughters.

89
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,127
They're the only ones who can find
bodies. Police didn't find anything.

90
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,764
Authorities, well, they're trying
to cover the whole thing up.

91
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,732
- Yeah.
- Anyway.

92
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,828
What are you doing here?

93
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,540
I'm doing a story on the murders.

94
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,041
- There's always a story with you.
- It's not like that.

95
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,411
- Yeah, you always want something.
- I don't want anything.

96
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,214
It's something that I think
we need to do, together.

97
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,478
- I gotta go and find these pictures.
- Come on.

98
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,010
Team up with me.

99
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,479
It'll be like old times.

100
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,422
Old times?

101
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,686
That is exactly
what I want to avoid.

102
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,458
Shit.

103
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,931
Diaz!

104
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:56,741
You have to do something.
Her killers will come back for her.

105
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,449
People know about this.
You will never be safe.

106
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,593
I know. But, who can we go to?
The police?

107
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,561
They won't protect us.

108
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,088
The government...
all they do is steal.

109
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,060
The newspaper El Sol.
We should go there.

110
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,038
Alfonso Diaz can help us.

111
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,576
Hold on. Wait up!

112
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,814
You can't come here for six years
and expect me to help you.

113
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,517
- You're happy to see me, I can tell.
- Yeah, sure.

114
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,044
I need an inside contact, someone
who knows this world the way you do.

115
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,857
My God, what happened here?
What are these, bullet holes?

116
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,451
The price for telling the truth
in Juarez.

117
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,595
You are a great
investigative reporter.

118
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,964
One of the best when we
worked together in El Paso.

119
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,933
- What are you doing in this place?
- Alfonso!

120
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,739
They're saying the devil took a girl
to hell and she escaped.

121
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,607
The rumors are flying.

122
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,042
- This is getting crazy.
- What?

123
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,578
The Indians believe that the devil
himself is doing these murders.

124
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,779
- The devil?
- Yeah.

125
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,582
And they hand us
these reports all the time.

126
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,984
It changes shape every night.

127
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,521
Some nights he's a dandy.
Some nights an old man.

128
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,091
Keeps the women,
takes them to hell.

129
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,494
According to this new report,
some girl escaped from the devil.

130
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,865
Escaped?
Think there's anything to it?

131
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:24,136
Who knows? There's nothing
but hysteria and rumors.

132
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,572
Women are being used
for snuff films.

133
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,109
People kill women, take their organs.
Serial killers come from everywhere.

134
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,245
You wanna kill a woman
for any reason, you come to Juarez.

135
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,647
Is there any evidence
to support any of these theories?

136
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,816
Of course. There's evidence
to support all of them.

137
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,614
They may all be true.
Lauren...

138
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,225
the number of women killed
is not 375.

139
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,261
It's just a number
the police concord up.

140
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,662
But the real number is
probably closer to 5 thousand.

141
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,263
Five thousand?

142
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,967
Maybe it is the devil.

143
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,275
I brought you something.

144
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,551
Remember this?

145
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,029
What?
We earned this together.

146
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,597
I know.

147
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,600
- Take it.
- No, you keep it.

148
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,158
- You sure?
- Yeah.

149
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,303
- This is your family?
- Yeah.

150
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,012
Your wife?

151
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,622
- My wife.
- That was a stupid question.

152
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,056
Your boy. He looks like you.

153
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,037
Those bastards are trying
to take our papers.

154
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,039
You see? It is trying
to stall my liberty of paper.

155
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,675
They are trying to shut me down.
I am overwhelmed right now.

156
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,912
I'm fighting just to keep
my paper open. I can't help you.

157
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,247
- You don't mean that.
- Alfonso!

158
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,017
Another fire in Colonia Anapra.
People were stealing electricity again.

159
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,220
- A fire, what?
- Fires happen all the time.

160
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,388
There's no fire department,
there's no fire trucks.

161
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,084
What. Fire trucks?
There's no water.

162
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,394
Take those papers off the truck!
I don't care what they say!

163
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,730
Diaz, listen to me.
We can get the front page.

164
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,399
Think about it.
They'd never do this to you again.

165
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,670
What is this? More promises
of glory from George?

166
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,439
That's what you left me,
remember?

167
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,875
The answer is no.
Do you understand no? No!

168
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,740
Get more men to help!

169
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,643
You're blowing it, Diaz!
Big time!

170
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,120
What's going on over there?

171
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,647
That girl says that she was in hell
with the devil. And that she escaped.

172
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,720
It's all nonsense.

173
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,965
Open the door! Open the door!

174
00:21:55,847 --> 00:22:00,218
You say your attacker
was the bus driver?

175
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,088
Could you identify him?

176
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,216
Yes... and the other man too.

177
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,796
Ask her if she has any marks
maybe on her neck...

178
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,788
or a bite mark on her breast.

179
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,443
I don't need to ask.

180
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,839
I have already seen... she does.

181
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,254
Do you know what this means?

182
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,858
A lot of our victims had
that bite mark on their breasts.

183
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,932
It all happened in Lotte Bravo.

184
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,991
Almost all the killings
happened there.

185
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,161
Has any other woman
ever survived an attack?

186
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,028
No, never.

187
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,467
This could blow the whole lid over
what's happening here in Juarez.

188
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,885
Have you told this
to any other newspapers?

189
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,580
<i>- No, senorita.
- No?</i>

190
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,914
Will you help me?

191
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,960
<i>Si. We'll help.</i>

192
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,520
Alfonso, the police are here.

193
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,201
You hear that, right? We can't
let the police get to them.

194
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,238
Don't worry. I don't have intentions
of giving them to the police.

195
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,540
We've got to get them out of here,
through the back. Come on.

196
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,376
I'm gonna go with them. This could be
the biggest story of the year.

197
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:36,181
She could never disappear in a crowd
with you, a blonde American?

198
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,984
You're going to put her life
in danger for a fucking story?

199
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,421
But her life is already in danger.
She wants our help. Didn't you hear?

200
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,049
The police have assembled
a fort out there.

201
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,152
- Over here.
- No, no.

202
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,955
That's the first place
they would look.

203
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,094
Shit!

204
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,064
Diaz!

205
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,885
Mr. Lopez? I'm Lauren Adrian
from the Chicago Sentinel.

206
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:17,622
- A woman reporter?
- We've been around since Lois Lane.

207
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,647
I'm doing a story...

208
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:24,229
I'm doing a story on the murders.
Of the factory workers?

209
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,931
You did get my interview request?

210
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,467
- You've heard of me in Chicago?
- Sure.

211
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:33,038
- Can I get your picture for my piece?
- Yeah.

212
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,406
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

213
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,541
Why don't you guys get together?

214
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,177
You know what?
Hold these papers...

215
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,980
and act like you're having
an important conversation.

216
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,278
Perfect. That's it.

217
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,007
You look handsome, Eduardo.

218
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,621
I see you've met my old friend.

219
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,590
I need to talk with you
in your office.

220
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,616
You can't stop delivery
of my paper.

221
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,894
I'm not here for that.
Let's go into your office.

222
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,233
- No. Sorry.
- Okay.

223
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:20,185
It's not about the paper. I'm looking
for a young woman and her mother.

224
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,120
They're Indian.

225
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,957
There are rumors coming out
of Colonia Anapra about this girl.

226
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:29,361
They said that they would
be speaking to your newspaper.

227
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,764
I don't know anything about it.

228
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,967
I've been trying to keep my paper
from being shut down all day.

229
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,504
Do you mind if we look around?

230
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,940
- Do I have a choice?
- No, you don't.

231
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,339
Look outside.

232
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,469
We can't find anybody outside.

233
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,139
Alfonso, you better come with us.

234
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,640
You can't take him anywhere.

235
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,144
It's for questioning. Don't the police
question people in Chicago?

236
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,738
Is all right.
I've been through this before.

237
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,107
Call me for that interview.

238
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,232
You can come out.

239
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,101
You okay?

240
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:00,208
My name is Lauren.
I will help you.

241
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,721
<i>- Do you understand?
- Si. We understand.</i>

242
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,123
We work in El Paso.
A little English, we understand.

243
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:10,288
Maybe with your little English and my
little Spanish we can get through this.

244
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,823
She cannot go home.
They will take her.

245
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,495
- You understand? She cannot go home.
- Yes. Yes.

246
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,142
How about we do this?

247
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:28,113
<i>You tu casa.</i>

248
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,349
And I will take Eva with me.

249
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,084
That's what we'll do.

250
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:37,889
And if you need anything,
talk to Alfonso Diaz.

251
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,358
We'll go out the back.
You'll out the front.

252
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,690
Everything normal.
That's what we'll do.

253
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,471
What's that?

254
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,208
The Virgin.
She protects me.

255
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,227
You like that?
You like the song?

256
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,628
It's Juanes.
He's my favorite.

257
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,596
Look! There he is!

258
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,636
- He's cute.
- Yes, he is.

259
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,865
Very cute.

260
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,961
<i>George, listen to me.</i>

261
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,796
<i>This girl was attacked,
strangled, buried...</i>

262
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,467
<i>and left for dead. She crawled out
of her own fucking grave.</i>

263
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,603
Does anyone else know
about this, any other papers?

264
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,901
No. I'm sitting on an exclusive.

265
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,585
I can't keep her here by myself.

266
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:18,389
There's this woman, Teresa Casillas
And she's on my interview list.

267
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,823
She started a group
for the woman workers.

268
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,936
Get this. She wants to find
the guys who did this.

269
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,438
And I'm going to help her.

270
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:38,307
Well, it's a great angle, Lauren.
But be careful. You're not a cop.

271
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,378
George, I gotta go!

272
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,514
Eva?

273
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,758
Eva!

274
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,277
Do you have my keys?

275
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,093
- Move that piece of junk!
- Shut up!

276
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,979
Oh, shit.

277
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,528
Hi, I'm Lauren Adrian,
journalist from the United States.

278
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,797
I need to speak to Senora Casillas?

279
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,265
She's busy now.

280
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,866
It's an emergency.

281
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,735
<i>- Gracias.
- Si.</i>

282
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,903
Lauren Adrian?

283
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,639
- You Teresa Casillas?
- I thought the interview was tomorrow.

284
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,809
Yeah, but I have a situation.

285
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,578
I have a girl with me.
She was raped...

286
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,180
and almost killed in the desert.

287
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,316
She's weak. She's in my car.
And I'm gonna need some help.

288
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,647
Of course.

289
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,825
This is dangerous.

290
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,732
I don't think you know
how dangerous this is.

291
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:06,304
The government here doesn't want
anyone to know about these things.

292
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:10,074
If you go around
telling people about this...

293
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:14,178
- then you become their enemy.
- But this is an important story.

294
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,681
A story that I desperately
want to tell.

295
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:20,685
Even if you find Eva's attackers...

296
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,589
she will have to identify them
in a formal court proceedings...

297
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,824
before she can have any trial.

298
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:31,596
The court will not be on her side
and she would have no protection.

299
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:35,259
She's going to be putting
her life in danger.

300
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,965
Will she be able to do this?

301
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,606
She crawled out of her own grave.

302
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,010
She wants to do this, Teresa.

303
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,581
There you are.

304
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,625
This place is so beautiful.

305
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,692
It doesn't seem real.

306
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,859
It's real.

307
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:14,939
She's gonna let you
stay here for awhile...

308
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,703
so you don't have to go back
to the hotel or anything.

309
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,604
He came to me that last night
at the hotel.

310
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,674
Who came to you?

311
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,652
The Devil.

312
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,392
Eva, there was nobody
at the hotel last night.

313
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:37,361
- He was.
- It wasn't real.

314
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,591
The Devil wasn't there.

315
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:47,002
There's a doctor here to see you.
He's going to help you get better.

316
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,740
Are you going to fight for me?

317
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,675
Of course I'm going
to fight for you.

318
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,739
Lauren? This is the doctor.

319
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,451
Lauren Adrian.

320
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,919
<i>- Mucho gusto.
- Mucho gusto.</i>

321
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,256
<i>- This is Eva.
- Hola, Eva.</i>

322
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,622
I'm Doctor Cervantes.

323
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,800
<i>- Lauren?
- Diaz. You all right?</i>

324
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,402
<i>I'm fine. The police
released me this morning.</i>

325
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,673
<i>But the mothers, they found
another body in Lotte Bravo.</i>

326
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,709
<i>- Really?
- You have to come. Quickly.</i>

327
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,404
I'm coming right now.

328
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,981
No photographs!

329
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,917
<i>- It's digital.
- Senor, senor.</i>

330
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,763
It's starting to feel like
old times.

331
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,267
Did you see? She was strangled
with one of her shoelaces.

332
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,825
It's one of the patterns.

333
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,963
The Chief of Police right up there.

334
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,343
'Scuse me. Hi, I'm Lauren Adrian
from the Chicago Sentinel.

335
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,112
I don't have time
for any interviews.

336
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,048
But doesn't this killing prove that
there are murderers in Juarez?

337
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:08,352
This is not one of the murders.
It's a case of domestic violence.

338
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,889
- Domestic violence?
- The murders are the work of one man.

339
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:15,092
- His name is Al-Abar.
- Haven't there been many murders...

340
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,328
- since he's been arrested?
- We have reason to believe...

341
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,864
he has been masterminding
these murders from prison.

342
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,199
I'd like an interview with him.
How can I get an interview?

343
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,801
That is totally impossible.

344
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,238
<i>- So no one's allowed to see him.
- Senorita...</i>

345
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:31,976
the man is in total isolation.
No one is allowed to see him.

346
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,068
Really?

347
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,145
Then how is he masterminding
all these killings from prison?

348
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,311
We're still investigating that.

349
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:10,839
So, that night you walked
right through here.

350
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:17,388
On the street.
And then I...

351
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:21,119
I turned down this alley.

352
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:28,566
<i>This is the way I always
take to home. Mi casa.</i>

353
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,899
And this is where the man
who frightened you came up to you.

354
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,766
And then you...

355
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,910
- I went that way.
- Down this way...

356
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,310
and that's where you got
on the factory bus.

357
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,883
Well, we're early.
Let's wait.

358
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:53,083
And when a factory bus comes by,
that'll be our bus.

359
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,419
This city is very ugly.

360
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,092
It's hot.

361
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,936
Not like my home.

362
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,201
It's very green there.

363
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,536
<i>- You miss your home?
- Mucho.</i>

364
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,911
Why don't you tell me about it?

365
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,612
I came from Oaxaca.

366
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,089
I love my land.

367
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:28,947
It's...

368
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,291
my heart, my soul.

369
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,899
But they took the land away.

370
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,401
- Who took the land away?
- The government.

371
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,636
We cannot pay the taxes, so...

372
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:52,415
<i>they tell us, go to the border
and work in the maquiladoras.</i>

373
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,280
Make money to keep your land.

374
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,413
But there is no money here.

375
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:05,994
The government and the factories
take everything.

376
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,888
All the money is for them.

377
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,668
For us, nothing.

378
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,567
My father went to the U.S. To work.

379
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,542
I haven't seen him in many years.

380
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,952
But what can we do?

381
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:36,081
We have no land.
We cannot go home.

382
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,656
Nothing.

383
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,429
I'm sorry.

384
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,126
It's very sad.

385
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,567
But tell me about you.

386
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,414
- About me?
- Yeah.

387
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:00,906
I tell you about me,
now you tell me about you.

388
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,313
All right.

389
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,716
How many children do you have?

390
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,262
I don't have any children.
I'm not married.

391
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,492
- No children?
- No.

392
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,497
But why?

393
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:22,571
- 'Cause I work.
- My mother work and she has children.

394
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:27,211
I have a different kind of work.
It's called a career.

395
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,644
And what is that?

396
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:33,580
A career. Okay.

397
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:39,757
A career is a kind of work
that you want more than anything...

398
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,693
and you give up
everything to get it.

399
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,719
And when you get it...

400
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:52,034
you realize that it's not that great
and you have no life.

401
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,468
I don't understand.

402
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,169
That makes two of us.

403
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,510
- There it is!
- Okay.

404
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,117
I got it.

405
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,259
Oh, my God.

406
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,030
Oh, God.

407
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:29,237
It's the end of a shift.
There's gonna be a lot of buses.

408
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:34,044
Maybe we'll be able to identify
the buses by their numbers.

409
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:38,716
Then I'll follow the buses,
take photographs of the drivers.

410
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:43,085
You can identify them and then,
and then we'll have our man.

411
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,099
Ready? Now!

412
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,172
- That's it!
- You get it?

413
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,139
I got it.

414
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,847
Go, go. You got him.

415
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,128
Let's go. Come on.

416
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,758
- So.
- Just walk.

417
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:47,877
You think we could go around
the other side and get some more?

418
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,348
Oh, shit. Come on!

419
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,165
Come on. Come on!

420
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,779
Stay here!

421
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,916
Come here, come here!
Run!

422
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,167
Down!

423
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,288
- Teresa!
- Yes?

424
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,949
- Come here, please.
- Yes.

425
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,594
- Lauren'll stay with you tonight.
- What happened?

426
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,730
- She can't go back to her hotel.
- Not tonight.

427
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,999
I have a party tonight.

428
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,869
At the Salamanca house.
I have to go.

429
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,304
Can you cancel it?
Hold on.

430
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,874
Don't.
Take Lauren with you.

431
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:20,711
No one will know she's there.
I'll get these guys off her trail.

432
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,645
Excuse me a second.

433
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,518
Laurie, please, do as I say.
Promise me.

434
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,387
- Are you gonna be safe?
- I can take care of myself.

435
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,685
Give me your hotel key.
I'll get your things.

436
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,556
- I'll see you later. Bye.
- Okay.

437
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:43,290
I hope you realize how much he's
jeopardizing his own life for you.

438
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,864
Yeah, I know.

439
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,573
- Is Eva here?
- Yes. She's inside.

440
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,308
We should take her with us
tonight, too, don't you think?

441
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,677
- No. We can't.
- Why?

442
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:56,313
It's gonna be bad for her.

443
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,548
- No.
- Why?

444
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:01,518
You don't understand.
These people are rich and...

445
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:05,322
- she's gonna feel so uncomfortable.
- Somebody just tried to kill us.

446
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,483
I'm not leaving Eva alone tonight.

447
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,894
We can't leave her alone, okay?

448
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,784
Relax.
You look beautiful.

449
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:39,017
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- You look so beautiful. You do.

450
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:52,302
Is that Senator Rawlings?
What is he doing here?

451
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:56,740
Celebrating the 15th birthday
of Don Philippe Salamanca's daughter.

452
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,676
And so is the governor,
the archbishop...

453
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:03,480
and the heads of some American
and Japanese companies.

454
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,416
Really? Who is
the Salamanca family?

455
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,786
Let's just say that the Free Trade
Agreement couldn't happen...

456
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,949
without the support
of the Salamanca family.

457
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:16,989
Excuse me.

458
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:24,289
- This whole party is for her?
- Yeah.

459
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,461
She's lucky.

460
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,372
Yeah.

461
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:33,809
She's lucky.

462
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,413
Perfect.

463
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,363
- What happened?
- It's Juanes!

464
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,593
Oh, my God.

465
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,577
- Why don't you go up there?
- No.

466
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,446
- Yes, get close.
- No.

467
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,949
- Eva, go meet him.
- No...

468
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,784
- I'm gonna take her up there.
- No!

469
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,581
Yes.

470
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:56,515
Particularly extravagant for a girl's
15th birthday, don't you think?

471
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:00,754
I don't know. The chance
to catch Juanes' sweaty vest...

472
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,424
can only come once in a girl's life.

473
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,504
Please allow me to introduce myself.
Marco Antonio Salamanca.

474
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,474
- People call me just Marco.
- I'm Lauren Adrian.

475
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,942
I'm a friend of Teresa Casias'.

476
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,580
Thank you for allowing us
into your lovely home, Marco.

477
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,016
- You're American.
- Yes.

478
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,951
- You new to Juarez?
- Yes.

479
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,913
Listen.

480
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:29,659
I'd love to show you
a sight of Juarez...

481
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,093
that I'm sure you've
never experienced.

482
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,898
So, now I'm seeing a sight
I like right now.

483
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:38,568
But there is another sight...

484
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,906
that is more exciting
and mysterious.

485
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,142
- Sounds dangerous.
- No, no.

486
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:48,873
Just incredibly thrilling.

487
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:55,848
Well, if I ever have
the urge for a tour, Marco...

488
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,985
I know I can find you.

489
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,536
- What's your name?
- Eva.

490
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,574
- Something's wrong.
- What?

491
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,810
Hey, you okay?

492
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:10,215
Let's get her out of here. Teresa.
Let's get her back to your house.

493
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,764
No!

494
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:19,167
You're safe! Eva?

495
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,133
Eva? Eva.

496
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:30,640
It's me.

497
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,579
No. Baby. Baby.

498
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:50,293
How's she doing today?
Is she feeling better?

499
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:55,390
She's not well.
I had to call back that doctor.

500
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,302
- What are these, pictures?
- Yes.

501
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:04,274
Lauren, I don't think
you want to torment her.

502
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,810
I wouldn't do that.
She wants to find these men.

503
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,412
And after I saw the second killer,
her life is in danger.

504
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,881
- We didn't see any killer.
- Yes, we did!

505
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:16,786
You didn't see any killer
because there is no second killer.

506
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:20,357
- What are you talking about?
- The psychologists are convinced...

507
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:23,460
that Eva imagined
the second killer.

508
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,496
I don't care what the doctors say.
I was there. I saw it.

509
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:29,766
She comes from an Indian culture.
Her people...

510
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:34,504
often don't distinguish real things
from the things they imagine.

511
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,307
- Are you saying she's crazy?
- No! She's not crazy.

512
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:43,143
She believes what she says.
But this doesn't mean that it's true.

513
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:47,250
I saw the look on that man's face.

514
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,185
- He recognized her.
- No, please.

515
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:51,154
- That is the man...
- Don't!

516
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:54,391
Don't. This is my house and this
stops here. I can't deal with this.

517
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,860
- You wanted this story, too.
- No!

518
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,829
Your story is destroying her.

519
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,832
And, God, Lauren.
You can be killed too.

520
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:06,791
You understand that? They tried it
before and they will kill you.

521
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,237
I cannot do this anymore.
Please, just leave.

522
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:23,710
- I'm sorry. Did we wake you up?
- Are they photos of the bus drivers?

523
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:27,322
- It's not important right now.
- It is important.

524
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,887
- Eva. Please. You need to heal.
- No, Teresa.

525
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,228
The only thing
that will heal me...

526
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,804
the only thing that will
give me back my life...

527
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,533
is to find my attackers.

528
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,869
Lauren is helping me.

529
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:52,774
And we are gonna find them
together. Right?

530
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,889
This is the road
where Eva was raped.

531
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:48,938
This is where I want you to be.
You and the police.

532
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:52,806
Eva identified the bus driver.
His name is Domingo Esparza.

533
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,409
They drive the victims out here
and then meet the other attacker.

534
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:01,951
I'll go undercover into the factory
he worked for and pose as a worker.

535
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,921
If we know who this Esparza is,
just have him arrested.

536
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,857
If we have him arrested, we have
no chance of catching the second guy.

537
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,849
He's already seen Eva.
He'll come after her.

538
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,864
I'm going into the factory as bait.
It's our only chance to catch both.

539
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:19,202
You can't. We have to warn too many
people. The police'll never allow it.

540
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:23,440
That's why you'll only tell them
after I'm in there already.

541
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,009
They're not gonna risk having
an American journalist killed.

542
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:29,913
There must be people
on the police that you trust.

543
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,982
- People who care about the truth.
- Yeah, I know people.

544
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,985
I think I can trust them.
But you never really know.

545
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:40,023
People get bribed. I'm not going
to gamble with your life.

546
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:43,693
I'm not gonna gamble with Eva's life.
It's now or never. Don't you see?

547
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,995
No, I don't see.
This is out of the question.

548
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:49,232
- Diaz, listen to me.
- I won't listen to you.

549
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:53,896
I won't let you. If anything happened
to you, I'll never forgive myself!

550
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,211
I can't do this.

551
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,359
All right.

552
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:28,004
You are not going into the factory.

553
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,740
And we will find another way
to hunt around this. Get in the car.

554
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,935
It's not your choice to make.

555
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:38,578
I promised Eva that I'd help her
find these men.

556
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,008
And I pray that you'll help me.

557
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:48,488
But even if you don't, I'm going
into that factory tomorrow.

558
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:18,085
Eva! You've come home.

559
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,221
Come in, come in.

560
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,040
How do I look?

561
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:47,780
- With just this.
- Okay.

562
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,016
- Like that?
- Something like that.

563
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,085
You look pretty.

564
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:01,658
For good luck.

565
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,594
Now you look like me.

566
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,011
I want to give you something.

567
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:21,384
- No, it's okay.
- Yes. Yes. No.

568
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:26,447
She protect me that night.

569
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,752
Now she's gonna protect you.

570
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,151
Let me.

571
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,391
Okay.

572
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,837
You are safe now.

573
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,605
Daughter, Cecilia is here.

574
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:54,710
- Hi. Lauren.
- Eva.

575
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:59,322
This is dangerous.
You shouldn't be doing this.

576
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,790
It's too dangerous.

577
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,258
I'll be fine.

578
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,600
Good luck, Lauren.

579
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,347
- This is my cousin, Silvia Rojas.
- Yes, we've been expecting her.

580
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,680
We've received her paperwork
from the front office.

581
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:33,153
This is where you'll work.
This is your supervisor.

582
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:56,479
<i>Lines 1 and 3 are falling
behind their quotas.</i>

583
01:01:56,479 --> 01:02:00,347
<i>Accelerate production.</i>

584
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:18,527
<i>Accelerate production.</i>

585
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:53,636
<i>The shift has ended.
Please leave quickly.</i>

586
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:57,299
<i>The next shift starts
in 10 minutes.</i>

587
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,435
<i>Please leave quickly.</i>

588
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:05,242
<i>The next shift starts
in 10 minutes.</i>

589
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,413
Do you mind if I stop for gas?

590
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,619
<i>Attention all units.
There's still no sign of the bus.</i>

591
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:14,093
Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

592
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,640
<i>We've received a call
from lauren.</i>

593
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,734
<i>She's in a junkyard.</i>

594
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:46,215
You all right?

595
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:50,587
A mass grave.

596
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:54,029
It was a mass grave.

597
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,532
We didn't find the other attacker.

598
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,138
There was nobody there.

599
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,176
Well, he was there.
He's out there.

600
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,644
I'm telling you, he was here.

601
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,216
He can see us.
I can feel it.

602
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,741
This isn't over until I find him.

603
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,149
When I was on that bus...

604
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,196
everything was just as Eva told it.

605
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,293
It made me feel like
I was living her story.

606
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:03,232
<i>"The screams of the women
of Juarez are silent...</i>

607
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,995
<i>because no one will listen...</i>

608
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:10,104
<i>not the corporations who make
their profits from their labor.</i>

609
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:15,044
<i>Not the governments of Mexico
and the United States...</i>

610
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,808
<i>who benefit
from the free trade agreements.</i>

611
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,642
<i>No one will listen.</i>

612
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:25,083
<i>All the evidence points to the fact
that there are many killers.</i>

613
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,357
<i>A whole culture of murder
that just gets worse and worse...</i>

614
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:31,224
<i>the more it's denied
and covered up.</i>

615
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:36,688
<i>Covering it up is less expensive
than protecting these women.</i>

616
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,867
<i>Money is
about the bottom line.</i>

617
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:43,137
<i>And so the death toll mounts.</i>

618
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:48,043
<i>Eva Jimenez, 16 years old.</i>

619
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:52,207
<i>She works in a factory
assembling televisions.</i>

620
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:55,117
<i>She makes five dollars a day."</i>

621
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:58,687
- I finished your story.
- Yeah? You finished my story.

622
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:02,179
Tomorrow it'll be printed
and everybody will know about it.

623
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:05,894
Don't forget that in five days
you're gonna have to go to court.

624
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,429
- I know.
- You'll have to talk to a judge...

625
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:11,195
and you'll have
to tell him everything.

626
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:15,266
- Can you do this?
- I think I can.

627
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:27,410
The man we saw at the party,
we didn't catch him.

628
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,886
- What?
- I know. It's gonna be okay.

629
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:35,791
No, you don't.
He is the Devil. The Devil.

630
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:39,728
He'll take me to Hell.
He don't want me to go to the judge.

631
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,298
Eva, please.

632
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,993
You'll be safe.

633
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,201
You have to believe me.

634
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,537
I will not let anything
happen to you.

635
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:50,873
And I will find this man.

636
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,774
You're gonna be okay.
I know how to find him.

637
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,236
- Just leave the glass there?
- Just leave the glass there.

638
01:12:56,605 --> 01:13:00,476
- Here comes the magic.
- All right.

639
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:04,276
- You gonna show me something?
- Now it's gonna disappear.

640
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,878
It took me two semesters at Harvard
to learn that trick.

641
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,361
I learned that first week
at St. Mary's High.

642
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:22,865
- I was always a poor student.
- Don't worry. I give tutorials.

643
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,526
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

644
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:29,838
What was it like being a Mexican at
Harvard? They had two of you there?

645
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:32,830
But I'm an American citizen.

646
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,311
It's convenient. I can be Mexican
whenever I want to or American.

647
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:38,981
- So, deep down you're just a gringo.
- Well, of course.

648
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,814
It's the best thing to be.
The whole world wants to be gringo.

649
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,987
Come to think of it, there were a lot
of gringos at your party that night.

650
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,156
- I even saw Senator...
- Rawlings.

651
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:48,657
- Right.
- You know...

652
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:51,994
my family owns most of the land.

653
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:55,030
So, he's given us a great
opportunity with NAFTA.

654
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:58,200
There was somebody else there, too.

655
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,639
So he was tall. He was kind
of dark eyes. Gold teeth?

656
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:07,409
- Why do you wanna know?
- No reason. It was just...

657
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:13,182
something that Teresa had said.
He had a scar right here.

658
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:16,640
Aris. Aris Rodriguez.

659
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,888
His family's involved
with the NAFTA factories.

660
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:21,412
A very old family, too.

661
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,393
Who's calling me?

662
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:29,391
George!

663
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:34,526
Hey can you give a minute?
Hold on. I'm in a restaurant.

664
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,207
So, did you read the piece?
What'd you think?

665
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:42,911
<i>Best think you've ever done.
It's got something I've never seen.</i>

666
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:44,980
Some incredible humanity.

667
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,983
And this portrait of Eva?
Quite beautiful.

668
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,578
I don't know what to say.
You're my inspiration, George.

669
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,523
It means the world to me
that you liked it.

670
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,583
Frankly, I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

671
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:00,027
Congratulations.

672
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:17,079
Diaz, I just got off the phone
with Chicago. They loved the story.

673
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:20,048
You want my husband.

674
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:24,951
<i>- Alfonso, telephone.
- In a minute.</i>

675
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:34,258
<i>Daddy! Kick me the ball.</i>

676
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:41,781
- Hey, George.
- No. This is Frank.

677
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:49,131
I'm not supposed to tell you this,
but George didn't print the story.

678
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:52,300
He got a visit from some political
types, including Senator Rawlings.

679
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,403
After that, it was a no go.

680
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,705
They're not printing it at all?

681
01:17:56,705 --> 01:18:00,709
You don't understand. Rawlings is
pushing a bill through Congress...

682
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:03,612
to expand the Free Trade agreements
to include Central America...

683
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:06,581
and they don't want
any bad press right now.

684
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:09,584
- You dug too deep.
- Okay.

685
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:14,189
<i>- Your story is too fuckin' hot.
- Do me a favor.</i>

686
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:18,126
- Put me on the phone with George.
- He's not gonna talk to you.

687
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:21,163
They're gonna say it's temporary
and for you to stay put.

688
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:23,265
But that's just a smoke screen
to kill it.

689
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,234
If you want the story printed,
you've gotta get back here.

690
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:29,337
<i>- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause it's a great story.</i>

691
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:32,636
It needs to be printed.
It's now or never.

692
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:08,936
<i>So, Eva, I have something
to tell you. Your story...</i>

693
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,613
I have to fight for it.

694
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:18,620
<i>What do you mean?
They don't want my story?</i>

695
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:21,384
No, they will want it.

696
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:24,417
But, because of that...

697
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:29,163
- I have to go.
- You can't go.

698
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:31,833
<i>I have to talk to the judge
in three days.</i>

699
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:35,871
<i>- I know.
- The murderer'll be there.</i>

700
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:39,272
- I'm very afraid. You can't go.
- Don't worry.

701
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:44,370
<i>I will return.
They will not publish my story.</i>

702
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,705
And you will not return.

703
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:52,587
People promise many things,
but that never happens.

704
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:54,656
<i>I will get your story printed
and I won't stop...</i>

705
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:57,259
<i>until both of your attackers
are punished.</i>

706
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,988
And I will be back.

707
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:00,592
Eva, look at me.

708
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:03,431
I will return.

709
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,796
I promise.

710
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,303
Teresa!

711
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:56,506
Teresa! Teresa!

712
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,680
What happened?

713
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:04,292
- Calm down.
- He's in there.

714
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,522
Search her room.
Search outside!

715
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:12,534
What's the matter?

716
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,603
- The Devil is here.
- Who?

717
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,537
The Devil!

718
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:21,741
It's all right. It's all right.

719
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,346
Tell me.

720
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:26,915
- Nobody is there.
- Nobody, right?

721
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:29,818
See? No one is there.

722
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:34,723
It was just a nightmare.
Look at me.

723
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,056
He's not real.

724
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:43,558
It was just a nightmare.

725
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:48,797
Everything is all right.

726
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:16,759
Miss, you can...
Lauren, is that you? Wait a minute!

727
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:23,429
- Could you just...
- Lauren, come in.

728
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,408
Lauren Adrian,
this is Samuel Denton...

729
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:30,045
the C.E.O. Of the publishing
syndicate that owns the Sentinel.

730
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:33,048
- This is Senator...
- Rawlings, I know.

731
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:35,483
Saw you in Juarez last week
at the Salamanca house.

732
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:39,454
- What were you doing there?
- Hi. I'm Denise McKenzie.

733
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:41,489
I'm head
of all syndicate operations.

734
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:45,460
Congratulations. You're gonna make
an exceptional foreign correspondent.

735
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,587
We are all very excited.

736
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:53,435
We're gonna have to let you go, or
else we're not gonna make our lunch.

737
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,070
- I'll talk to you later.
- All the best.

738
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,935
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

739
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,906
- Foreign correspondent?
- How about that?

740
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,711
- It's unbelievable.
- Your first assignment.

741
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:18,460
- This is a bribe, isn't it?
- What do you care?

742
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,628
You'd do anything for this job.
Consider it a freebie.

743
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:24,566
This can't be you.
You can't bow to those people!

744
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:26,801
- I'm not bowing to anyone.
- Then print my story.

745
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:29,137
We cannot print your story.

746
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:31,506
In three days,
a 16-year-old girl...

747
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:34,075
is going into court to face
the man who tried to kill her!

748
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:37,078
All because we said
that we would print her story.

749
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:41,116
This story could save her life and
the lives of many women in Juarez.

750
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:42,951
This is a fucking important story!

751
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:45,053
I understand that.
But you are blaming...

752
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,489
- the Mexican and American governments.
- You're god damned right I am.

753
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:50,558
- And the Free Trade Agreement.
- It isn't free trade!

754
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:54,596
It's slave trade. It's a scam.
Everybody is making too much money...

755
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,698
- to give a shit about these women.
- Listen to me.

756
01:23:56,698 --> 01:24:00,568
These are very serious accusations,
they're damn near criminal.

757
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,504
And this newspaper is not
prepared to make 'em...

758
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:04,472
- and you can't substantiate them.
- And they're true!

759
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,975
This is now a matter
of corporate responsibility.

760
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:10,045
Since when do you put corporate
responsibility above the truth?

761
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,848
Get off your soapbox. I liked you
better as a cutthroat reporter.

762
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:17,152
I like you better as an editor who
couldn't be bought or intimidated!

763
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,220
- A man I admire.
- The days of investigative reporting...

764
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,156
are over, Lauren.

765
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:25,060
The news isn't news anymore. It's
as dead as the typewriter I used!

766
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,595
Corporate America
is running the show now.

767
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:31,766
And their news agenda is free trade,
globalization and entertainment.

768
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:34,599
That's our glorious future!

769
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:38,106
You know what would happen to me
if I published your story on my own.

770
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:40,008
If you don't have the balls
to print my story...

771
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:43,034
- I will find someone who will.
- It's not that easy, kid.

772
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,837
Read your contract.

773
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:50,184
The Sentinel owns your story.
Hell, it owns you.

774
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:55,122
Nobody owns me!

775
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,822
That's the difference
between me and you.

776
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:01,493
Lauren!

777
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,216
Take the job, Lauren.

778
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,056
You got a damn fine career
in front of yourself...

779
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,958
and you're throwing it all away
and for what?

780
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:33,018
Your story about these women
is just not worth it.

781
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,630
Not worth it?

782
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,665
I forgot. They're just Mexican women
so they're not worth it.

783
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,565
I didn't mean it that way.

784
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:42,564
Do you see this?

785
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:45,036
And this?

786
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:50,668
And this? And this? And this?

787
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:56,084
All of it is assembled in Juarez
and it's all covered with blood.

788
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,386
Would you calm down?
If you walk out of here today...

789
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,388
you could never get back in here,
and you know it.

790
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:03,057
- For God's sakes, let this thing go!
- I can't.

791
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:04,993
- You think this is your big story.
- My parents are from Mexico.

792
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:09,589
- You identify with it.
- I'm one of them. Can't you see?

793
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:16,693
My parents came here
as migrant farm workers.

794
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,603
They were killed...

795
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,269
so I was adopted.

796
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:35,316
I only have vague
memories of them.

797
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:42,324
I remember a field
filled with workers...

798
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:46,600
My mother.

799
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:49,660
My father.

800
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,103
I was there when he was killed.

801
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:04,718
I saw him die.

802
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:10,725
- I'm sorry.
- When I met Eva, I saw myself.

803
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:16,789
I've been running away
from who I am my whole life.

804
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:22,232
Because you don't wanna be Mexican,
not in this country.

805
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,773
You see?

806
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,913
I could be one of the women
in those factories.

807
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:41,455
It could be me
in one of those graves.

808
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,720
I can't let this go.

809
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:27,335
Alfonso, hurry.
What are you doing?

810
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,769
Just a minute, my love.

811
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:58,889
Alfonso!
Call an ambulance!

812
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:01,062
Out of the way!

813
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:20,214
Get up. Let's go.

814
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:24,949
Come on. Quickly!

815
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,524
Get in before the Border Patrol
finds us!

816
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:34,096
Watch your head.

817
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:56,821
Can I speak to Diaz?

818
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:58,923
What?

819
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:51,937
He's coming back. Let's go!

820
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:31,879
What?

821
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:09,954
- Who did this?
- I don't know. Nobody does.

822
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:12,293
Diaz is gone.

823
01:32:12,293 --> 01:32:16,097
And tomorrow the bus driver's
gonna be a free man.

824
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:20,234
No! With Eva's testimony,
he will go to jail.

825
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:22,770
- Eva's gone.
- What?

826
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:27,708
She ran away. Nobody knows
where she is, not even her mother.

827
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:31,012
Her mother. To move away
from Colonia Anapra.

828
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:35,516
She want to be there for her,
waiting for her at their home...

829
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:39,086
but she doesn't feel safe
there anymore.

830
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:41,522
How could she? Tomorrow...

831
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:44,423
Domingo Esparza
is gonna be a free man.

832
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:49,229
- This isn't happening.
- It is happening.

833
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,361
It's all over.

834
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:34,806
Kids, get up.

835
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:40,012
Oh, jeez. Poor people.

836
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,736
- Lauren.
- Who are you?

837
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:16,517
Would you gentlemen please
excuse us for a moment?

838
01:34:16,517 --> 01:34:18,319
Do you believe in anything?

839
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,222
Are you, Mexican? American?
What are you?

840
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:26,193
These are limiting terms. They don't
mean much now in a modern world.

841
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:29,163
Alfonso Diaz was my friend.
Now he's dead.

842
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:31,097
I wanna know what happened to him.

843
01:34:35,469 --> 01:34:38,438
He was reporting things
people didn't want reported.

844
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:40,307
What did you think
was going to happen to him?

845
01:34:40,307 --> 01:34:43,344
- Who did it?
- Do you think I know that?

846
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:46,113
Do you think I even concern myself
with such things?

847
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:49,884
- It gets taken care of.
- Is Aris involved?

848
01:34:49,884 --> 01:34:53,120
How many more women is he gonna kill?
Why don't you tell somebody about it?

849
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:56,757
And who am I gonna tell?
These people know more than me.

850
01:34:56,757 --> 01:35:00,394
- Lf they arrest him, nothing'll change.
- He's a murderer.

851
01:35:00,394 --> 01:35:03,764
- He's protected by the authorities.
- You have to be realistic.

852
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:05,733
There are two sets of laws
in any country, okay?

853
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:09,637
The laws for rich and powerful people
and the laws for everybody else.

854
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:11,439
And don't think it's any different
in the United States...

855
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:15,170
because I buy politicians on both
sides of the border all the time.

856
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,173
What do you think built this?

857
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:23,246
Now...

858
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:27,154
when can we get together again?

859
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:30,257
I can free my schedule anytime.

860
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:31,554
What do you say?

861
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:39,723
I wish people like you didn't exist.

862
01:35:50,177 --> 01:35:51,946
And on top of everything else...

863
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:54,346
you're a lousy god damned fuck.

864
01:35:56,650 --> 01:36:04,147
<i>The first shift has ended.
Please leave quickly.</i>

865
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:08,562
<i>The second shift
will start in 10 minutes.</i>

866
01:36:08,562 --> 01:36:12,157
<i>Please leave quickly.</i>

867
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:19,638
<i>The first shift has ended.
Please leave quickly.</i>

868
01:36:21,308 --> 01:36:23,778
<i>Vamanos. Let's go.</i>

869
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,609
They're shipping you back
to Juarez.

870
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:44,792
Hurry up, Nacho.
We need the electricity.

871
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:46,783
Hold on. I'm doing it.

872
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:30,865
Eva?

873
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:33,566
Eva?

874
01:42:33,614 --> 01:42:37,550
It's morning and the court
will be in session soon.

875
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:43,089
They're gonna be waiting for you.

876
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,191
We're both pretty beat up.

877
01:42:53,367 --> 01:42:57,269
Maybe if we help each other...

878
01:42:58,805 --> 01:43:00,636
well then we can make it.

879
01:43:36,777 --> 01:43:40,713
<i>Eva testified against her attacker,
Domingo Esparza.</i>

880
01:43:40,948 --> 01:43:42,882
<i>He is awaiting trial.</i>

881
01:43:44,952 --> 01:43:47,284
<i>Eva was reunited with her mother.</i>

882
01:43:47,654 --> 01:43:50,851
<i>They are being protected
by a human rights organization.</i>

883
01:43:55,462 --> 01:44:00,365
<i>Aris' body was found.
It was never claimed.</i>

884
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:08,667
No one was arrested
for the murder of Alfonso Diaz.

885
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:16,712
<i>I took over Diaz's paper.</i>

886
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:21,120
<i>I continue to write to tell
the truth about Juarez.</i>

887
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:26,093
<i>Congress passed the bill expanding
the free trade agreements...</i>

888
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,323
<i>to Central America.</i>

889
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:32,995
<i>There are still no provisions
protecting the workers.</i>

890
01:44:37,404 --> 01:44:41,308
<i>Last week another body
was found in the desert.</i>

891
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:45,301
<i>A girl. About seventeen.</i>

892
01:44:49,216 --> 01:44:52,811
<i>She was still dressed
in her blue factory smock.</i>

893
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:06,032
<i>The murder of woman
in Juarez continues.</i>
