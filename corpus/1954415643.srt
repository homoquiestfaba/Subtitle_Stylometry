1
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:53,631
I need more red.

2
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,039
Don't move.

3
00:00:58,232 --> 00:00:59,881
I need more red.

4
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:02,881
Fuck.

5
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:04,593
Fuck!

6
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:06,804
Stay still. Stay still.

7
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,819
I'm doing the mouth so don't...

8
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,019
No talking.

9
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,851
I'll be right back.

10
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:14,851
Don't talk.

11
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,066
Don't move.

12
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:44,402
Hey. Hey, excuse me.

13
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:47,642
Can you please help?

14
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:40,795
We need to send
"Green Sunbeam" to New York.

15
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,488
Impossible.

16
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,952
It's going to be in
Berlin at the same dates.

17
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:45,360
How about...

18
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,160
"Curves of the Universe"

19
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:48,265
instead, Francoise?

20
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:51,265
No, no, no! No way!

21
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:53,682
Nothing from the 1995 series.

22
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:55,803
Can you picture it? At the MOMA?

23
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,383
It would clash with the space.

24
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,899
We promised "Green Sunbeam"

25
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,916
to the Hamburger
Bahnhof months ago.

26
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,356
They're really counting on it.

27
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:04,476
Hello Lilas, it's Annabelle.

28
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,620
- Are you okay?
- I'm great. You?

29
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,621
Are you sure?

30
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:09,437
Your mum is worried sick.

31
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,389
Leo called and said
you were missing.

32
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,597
I can't be missing
if I'm talking to you.

33
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,447
You know exactly what I meant.

34
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,695
So what?
I have more than 500

35
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:19,296
pieces in my catalog.

36
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:21,886
Something will find
grace in their eyes, no?

37
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,424
Listen, Lilas, deep down,

38
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:25,696
she just wants you to be happy.

39
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:27,713
But you should let
her know how you are.

40
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:28,872
Look, Stephane, honey,

41
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,624
I'm just not feeling it.

42
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,905
Find a solution.

43
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,696
I want "Green
Sunbeam" in New York.

44
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:35,811
Why is she
talking about New York?

45
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,186
The MOMA is
having a retrospective

46
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:38,626
of her work in two weeks.

47
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:39,491
She hasn't told you about it?

48
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:40,898
Will she be there?

49
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,459
No, it looks
like she will be in Berlin.

50
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,533
So, Annabelle

51
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:45,540
what's the word?

52
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,141
She's saying that everything is fine
and that you shouldn't worry.

53
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,508
Pass me the phone.

54
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,088
Your mum wants to talk to you.

55
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:53,030
Lilas, are you completely

56
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,374
out of your mind?

57
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,575
How long am I going
to have to endure your childishness?

58
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,150
I didn't ask for anything.

59
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,239
I am tired.

60
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,744
I have more important
things to do.

61
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:01,991
You are the one who calls me.

62
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:03,208
I can't believe you passed

63
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,896
on the best art
school for this crap.

64
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,335
So, you will do as you are told,
and come back to Paris.

65
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:09,231
Annabelle will book
a flight for you.

66
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:10,483
See you tomorrow!

67
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,698
Surprise.

68
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,770
Hi! What's
with the suitcase?

69
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,852
What suitcase?

70
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:24,853
Lilas...

71
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,797
Yeah?

72
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:28,357
Did something happen with Leo?

73
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:29,902
No.

74
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:32,052
Well, stop filming me.
Tell me what happened.

75
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:33,549
Nothing happened.

76
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,038
I just needed a little
bit of fresh air.

77
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:38,285
Listen, I'll be done in an hour.

78
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:39,655
We'll figure it out. Okay?

79
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:42,661
- Why do you work?
- What?

80
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,791
Why do you work?
What's your dream?

81
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:25,745
Hey honey. It's me.

82
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:30,104
I'm just calling to
say that I am running

83
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:31,576
a little bit late tonight.

84
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,209
Shouldn't be too bad hopefully.

85
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,420
Should be home a
little after 11:00.

86
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
Yeah.

87
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:43,547
Mr.,
I mean I think I spoke

88
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:46,909
to you a little bit
about him, but he passed

89
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,526
today, so it's
been a little hard.

90
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,181
Make sure to give
Maggie her food.

91
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,191
I left it in the fridge
and hopefully she'll get

92
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:01,535
in bed at a time...

93
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:06,449
Well she should be in
bed right now, but okay.

94
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,267
I miss you both, bye.

95
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,131
...that then through a complicated

96
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:26,085
series of molecular
attractions lead to the

97
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:27,493
psychedelic effect.

98
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,629
It's not especially well
understood, currently,

99
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,766
but maybe one day we'll
know a little bit better

100
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,557
exactly how the
effect is produced.

101
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,225
That kind of sounds

102
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,539
like a Randy Newman song.

103
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,540
Yeah.

104
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:10,732
That should
have been in Toy Story.

105
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:13,326
Let me tell you about this one,

106
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:16,904
since we're talking about capitalism
and how he's a corporate sell out.

107
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,535
I mean it's kind of like
this idea that we're

108
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:21,288
all being watched
by the one eye.

109
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,662
Hey guys. Guys.

110
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,896
This is that book, the
book, Give it to the People.

111
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:28,400
Inside here are all
the ideas we need to

112
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:31,665
break the bad karma of
this capitalist society.

113
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,649
I didn't know you could read.

114
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,802
No, I'm serious.

115
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:37,427
Look, this is a very
unique single copy.

116
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:39,188
This is the only copy
in the whole wide world

117
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:40,595
and it's this book right here.

118
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:42,132
You know, I share your etiology,

119
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,571
but there I just don't agree.

120
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:45,300
Yeah, he's definitely right.

121
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:47,731
You can't change the
world with a single copy book.

122
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:48,564
Hear me out,
hear me out, hear me out.

123
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:50,037
This is participatory.

124
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:51,445
This has been around
since the '70s.

125
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:52,692
Okay?

126
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:55,254
And what happens is
when the owner of this

127
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,942
book gets it, he reads
it and then inside he

128
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:59,259
puts an enlightened idea.

129
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:01,687
Then when he's done
he passes it on to

130
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:07,479
another person he trusts
and the idea is to

131
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
build enough ideas.

132
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:12,888
Just to build a society
based on happiness

133
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:13,978
and creativity.

134
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:15,123
That's bullshit.

135
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,499
Well, if you're not nice to me

136
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,667
I'm going to give it to
somebody else after I'm done.

137
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:21,668
Then what?

138
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,729
The second
couch is a little small,

139
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,714
but you're not too big
so it should be okay.

140
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:56,994
Okay. Are you
sure it's going to be

141
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:58,417
okay with Leeward and Mary.

142
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:00,412
Yeah, absolutely.

143
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:03,677
Excuse me. Oh,
I'm Jocelyn by the way.

144
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:07,556
- Do you want some fruit?
- No thank you.

145
00:10:07,557 --> 00:10:09,189
- Nice to meet you.
- Are you sure?

146
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,243
I have strawberries.

147
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,356
Are you sure Shiraz?

148
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:13,701
I'm fine, thank you.

149
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:14,725
See you up there.

150
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:15,726
See ya.

151
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:20,422
Now the junkyard on the right.

152
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:22,048
See the dim and fading light.

153
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:24,167
Thank you.

154
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,642
I got it fresh this morning.

155
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:28,776
Up the hill and up the stairs.

156
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:30,690
Give a shout nobody cares.

157
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,690
Hey guys.

158
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,947
Hi Rainbow.

159
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,032
Move your asses.
Move your asses.

160
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,653
I'm Lilas.
Nice to meet you.

161
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,292
How's your tea?

162
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:50,958
Oh, it's beer.

163
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:55,956
Hey there Mr. Leeward.

164
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,892
Nice to see you Gus.

165
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,686
Did you make that?

166
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:02,417
Yeah. No.

167
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:08,690
You're a great
musician, like your dad.

168
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,739
I became afraid of

169
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,014
dinosaurs and my fears
became so irrational.

170
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:34,677
My bar has this crazy open mic

171
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:36,118
night next week.

172
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,686
You should definitely
come down and perform.

173
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,254
- Okay yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

174
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:40,470
Sure.

175
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,680
Cool. Oh, this is my friend Lilas,
by the way.

176
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,881
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

177
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,711
Actually, I think
we already met once.

178
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,569
- Really?
- Oh, you're the French girl?

179
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,233
- You're French?
- Yes.

180
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:51,257
Okay, bonjour.

181
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:53,946
Bonjour, bonsoir.

182
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,019
She actually
really needs a place to crash.

183
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:58,427
I was wondering if
she could stay here

184
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:00,113
for a few days, just a few days.

185
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,898
Yeah, okay.
Sure a few days.

186
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:04,955
Thank you.

187
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:05,916
Yeah, sure.

188
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,355
See!

189
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:08,829
I am going to get a beer.
Can I get you something?

190
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,359
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

191
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:12,728
All right.
One, two, three.

192
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:08,659
It's Mary.

193
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,713
What's the password?

194
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:11,614
I forgot my keys.

195
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,792
That's not the password.

196
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:17,792
Not very funny.

197
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:19,382
Open the door.

198
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:20,822
You're not even close.

199
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:22,945
Open the fucking door.

200
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,273
All right. Come on guys.

201
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:31,020
We should go somewhere else.

202
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,136
Hey Mary!

203
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,191
Who are all those people?

204
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:05,192
What people?

205
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,346
Come on.

206
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:10,849
Did you just have a party?

207
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,482
Well what would you call party?

208
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:14,146
Come on Benjamin,
there's a three

209
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,475
year old in the house.

210
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,333
Can you pick this up?

211
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:10,566
Did Maggie eat her dinner?

212
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:15,143
Yes. Yes,
Rainbow ate her dinner.

213
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,388
Her soup?

214
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,126
Half of her
soup and a Mr. Freeze.

215
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:22,024
A Mr. Freeze?

216
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:24,495
Mr. Freeze is
an ice cream without

217
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,319
the cream. It's so
good. It's good.

218
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,951
No, I know
what a Mr. Freeze is.

219
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,115
It's good.

220
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,586
We wrote a song though,
we wrote a song.

221
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:43,227
- Really?
- Yeah.

222
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:45,052
Together.

223
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:47,085
Did she ask about me?

224
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:54,069
Tonight?
No, but that's just

225
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,350
because she was...

226
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:56,990
There was a million other people here
distracting her?

227
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:58,366
Probably.

228
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:00,586
- How many?
- 20.

229
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:02,966
- 20?
- Yeah, thousand.

230
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:03,967
20,000?

231
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,121
People.

232
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,352
Seriously, how many?

233
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,353
15.

234
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:12,634
14, 13, 12.

235
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,618
Hey, Benjamin,
whose suitcase is that?

236
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,652
Which suitcase?

237
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:23,652
That suitcase.

238
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,394
Oh, that suitcase.

239
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,365
That's Lilas'.

240
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,418
That's Shiraz's friend,
the French girl.

241
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,813
Why is Lilas the French girl's

242
00:17:34,814 --> 00:17:36,574
suitcase in our kitchen?

243
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:39,248
Um, she didn't
have any place to go.

244
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:42,880
So where exactly is
she going to stay here?

245
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:44,414
Under the couch?

246
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:46,750
Maybe under the
couch, behind the couch

247
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,064
or something like that.

248
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:49,663
Seriously, how
long is she staying here?

249
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:51,666
A couple of days.
A couple days. Okay?

250
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,882
Did you call Ted?

251
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:00,834
Ted?
Ted?

252
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,082
Ted, the commercial guy. Ted.

253
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,532
Oh, you mean
Ted the commercial guy.

254
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:07,532
No.

255
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:09,213
Did Ted call you?

256
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:11,213
Yes.

257
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:16,389
What did he say?

258
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,309
He said like, "Hey, this is Ted.

259
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,126
I'm the commercial
guy. Would you like

260
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:22,631
to do a commercial with me?"

261
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:23,632
What did you say?

262
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:25,990
I said, "I'm
not sure that I want

263
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:27,458
to do that Ted."

264
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:29,512
You told him
you don't want to do

265
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:30,594
the commercial?

266
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:32,809
I said I'll think about it,

267
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,705
but obviously I
don't really want to.

268
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:36,381
Benjamin, it's $5000.

269
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:38,761
You have to compose one song.

270
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:40,427
It would be so easy for you.

271
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:41,739
That would not be easy.

272
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,083
It would not be easy
just to compose one song.

273
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:46,220
This kind of thing would
kill my artistic integrity.

274
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:47,403
Do you realize that it's twice

275
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:49,669
my monthly salary?

276
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:52,333
Come on, Benjamin. I
really need your help.

277
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:53,548
I do help. I do help.

278
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,829
I found Shiraz.

279
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,967
I just can't.

280
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,597
I just can't live
like this anymore.

281
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,774
You know Maggie is
in our room with us.

282
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:02,990
We have no privacy.

283
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:04,105
Rainbow's very happy.

284
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,256
That's not the point.

285
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:08,640
The point is is that I'm too
old to have all these roommates

286
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,415
and now there's two women living here.

287
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,786
Come on.

288
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,608
All right, I
will find some money

289
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:15,609
somehow.

290
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:18,146
I just don't want to
do the commercial.

291
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,233
Do whatever you want to do.

292
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:25,948
I'm really tired.
I'm going to sleep.

293
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,309
What's your poison?

294
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,462
Rum and coke.

295
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,255
Rum and coke all right.

296
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:44,599
Thank you.

297
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:01,403
You should meet my friend Lilas.

298
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:02,586
She's an amazing artist.

299
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:03,643
Oh yeah?

300
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:05,372
Yeah. She's
here actually.

301
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:07,547
- She's in the bathroom.
- Really? I would love to meet her.

302
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:08,572
Always looking for new talent.

303
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:09,573
Speak of the devil.

304
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,693
Hi, I'm
sorry. I need to go.

305
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:15,806
My mom just sent me
a flight to get home.

306
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:16,989
Wait, what?

307
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,173
I'm going back
to Paris tomorrow.

308
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:19,391
No, no, no, no.
You can't leave now.

309
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:21,631
I just met a curator. A curator.

310
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:23,326
Shiraz, Shiraz.
I should introduce you.

311
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:24,479
I'm serious.

312
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,975
Adam, this is my friend Lilas.

313
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:27,776
Hey it's very nice to meet you.

314
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:29,983
Hi.
I heard you make great art.

315
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:33,375
Um, well I'm trying to.

316
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:34,587
Yeah? What kind of art?

317
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,929
Visual.

318
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,377
I make experimental videos
and that kind of stuff.

319
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:42,690
Very cool. Very cool.

320
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,578
You should come
show me something.

321
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,860
I would love to see your work.

322
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:47,805
Come visit me at the
gallery some time.

323
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:50,373
That's kind
thank you, but I can't.

324
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,374
I'm leaving New York
for good tomorrow.

325
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,327
Tommorrow? What time?

326
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:57,732
7:00 pm. Why?

327
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,839
That's perfect.
Just come in the morning.

328
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:02,886
Well...

329
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:03,887
Well yes.

330
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:05,864
You should go.

331
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,553
Come on. I hate
to miss a talent.

332
00:21:08,553 --> 00:21:10,248
I'll try. I'll
do my best, but...

333
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:11,728
- You should.
- I can't promise...

334
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:12,841
I'm telling you.

335
00:21:12,842 --> 00:21:14,849
Okay well give me your number
just in case.

336
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:16,849
What is it?

337
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:21,412
It's 606-555-7966.

338
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:24,940
7966. Okay. Lilas?

339
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:25,941
Yeah. Lilas.

340
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,307
And your last name?

341
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:28,394
It's de Castillon.

342
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:30,757
- D-E C-A-
- Wait a minute.

343
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,588
Are you related to Francoise?

344
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:33,772
She's her mom.

345
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:34,773
Are you serious?

346
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:36,191
I love her.

347
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,822
Her early stuff is absolutely...

348
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:40,910
Brilliant! Brilliant!

349
00:21:40,911 --> 00:21:42,447
- Brilliant.
- She's amazing.

350
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:43,535
Do you want a
drink or something?

351
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,431
No, I'm fine.

352
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:45,643
Can I just get a drink.

353
00:22:03,412 --> 00:22:06,324
- Hey.
- Oh. Hey.

354
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,538
How are you?

355
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:10,164
I'm good.
How are you doing?

356
00:22:10,165 --> 00:22:11,477
How was your night?

357
00:22:11,478 --> 00:22:14,693
Very good.
The bar was nice,

358
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,741
but apparently that
wasn't the place to be.

359
00:22:18,742 --> 00:22:19,893
What?
You mean? Oh here.

360
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:21,142
This looks nicer.

361
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:22,831
Yeah, it's
cool. It's so cool here.

362
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:24,598
It's hot. You want to sit down?

363
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,472
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

364
00:22:28,104 --> 00:22:29,368
Oh, this looks cool too.

365
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:31,416
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,985
Where did you find it?

367
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,393
Oh, no I
built it. I built it.

368
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,710
You built all that stuff?

369
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,315
Yeah, I'm
calling it a magic globe.

370
00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:41,145
See here put your hands...

371
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:42,146
Put your hands on it.

372
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:43,267
Like that?

373
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:44,759
Oh.

374
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:45,828
Yeah.

375
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:50,396
This is actually magic.

376
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:51,612
Just keep doing that.

377
00:22:51,613 --> 00:22:53,561
Up, down there we
go. Okay here we go.

378
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:03,487
This is your song
that you played tonight.

379
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:04,735
Yeah.

380
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:06,174
I don't get a
chance to tell you,

381
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:07,702
but I love that song so much.

382
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:08,961
Yeah?

383
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:10,496
Yeah.

384
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:13,076
I would love to get it on
a CD if that's possible.

385
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:16,986
Impossible.
I don't have a CD.

386
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:18,971
You don't have a CD for me?

387
00:23:19,971 --> 00:23:21,779
No.

388
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,517
- What?
- I've never recorded it.

389
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:30,691
You've never recorded a CD

390
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:31,908
in your entire life?

391
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,861
No. No I mean, yeah I've never
recorded an album or anything.

392
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:34,862
Why?

393
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:36,894
Oh, I don't know.

394
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,557
What about you and your art and

395
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:40,980
your projects and all that.

396
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,343
What are you going to...

397
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:43,495
Do you have any plans?

398
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:44,903
Actually, I'm
going back to Paris

399
00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:45,928
tomorrow.

400
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:47,303
Really?

401
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:49,703
Yeah, so you see
that's why I need the CD.

402
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:50,951
Why would you...

403
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:52,904
I don't understand.
Why would you go back to Paris?

404
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:54,856
I mean New York is a great place
for an artist.

405
00:23:54,857 --> 00:23:56,739
- It's the best place.
- Yeah, yes I know.

406
00:23:57,739 --> 00:23:59,658
It's crazy for
example even tonight

407
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:03,299
at the bar I just met with
a curator or something

408
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:07,948
and he told me that he
wants me to show him

409
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:08,949
my work.

410
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:10,347
See that's good.

411
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:11,780
I mean that's what New York's
all about is meeting people.

412
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,534
That's awesome.

413
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:17,229
That means you
should probably stay.

414
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,934
My visa is going to expire and

415
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,480
I don't even know if I
want to show my work.

416
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,694
Well, I don't know.

417
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:29,695
Maybe it's going to
be hard but maybe...

418
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:32,305
I think you should
probably give it a try.

419
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,043
I mean it's worth
giving it a try.

420
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:35,985
Maybe you're right.

421
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:38,610
- I think you should too.
- What?

422
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,944
Record your album.

423
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,193
Record an album. No.

424
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:43,507
I have an idea.

425
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:47,220
If I go to that
gallery you go record

426
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:49,005
your first album.

427
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:51,508
Oh you mean like a deal?

428
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:52,725
Yes, like a deal.

429
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:55,797
Oh, no. Noway.

430
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,009
You go record an album.

431
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:59,051
Okay, and you go to the gallery.

432
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:25,787
- Hey, do you want a blanket?
- Yes, thank you.

433
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:26,970
All right. Good night.

434
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:27,971
Good night.

435
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:41,582
I don't dream that much.

436
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,959
I mean I dream I
guess, but I rarely

437
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:45,616
remember my dreams.

438
00:25:47,616 --> 00:25:50,090
When I do remember them
I don't understand them.

439
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:53,661
Last week, for
example, I had a dream.

440
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:56,418
There was a tiny green
door in the middle

441
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:57,419
of the desert.

442
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,362
On the other side
of the door was the

443
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:01,732
exact same desert except
I wanted to be there.

444
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:04,509
I could have bypassed the door,
but no I wanted to go through it.

445
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:07,587
I tried again and again
but I was definitely

446
00:26:07,588 --> 00:26:08,588
too big.

447
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:12,325
Thus, I just sat in
front of the door

448
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:14,011
and contemplated the other side.

449
00:26:38,122 --> 00:26:42,779
So, what are you saying?

450
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:46,148
How much can you count to?

451
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:47,731
21.

452
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,826
Why can't you
can't to 22 though?

453
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:52,971
Why?

454
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:53,972
I don't know.

455
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:57,229
Morning.

456
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,710
Hey, why don't you sit down
with us and have some orange juice?

457
00:26:59,855 --> 00:27:01,367
No?

458
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,473
Maggie, I need you
to finish your cereal.

459
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:08,304
Okay?

460
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:10,953
Finish it up
or you don't get the prize.

461
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:13,392
No, no.

462
00:27:13,393 --> 00:27:15,114
Not until she
finishes her cereal.

463
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:16,881
Here.

464
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:18,322
I think your mom would
like some cereal.

465
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:19,473
Tell your mom. Tell your mom.

466
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:20,563
No, no I don't want...

467
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:22,482
Come on. Here we go.
Come on.

468
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:24,179
Momma, eat.

469
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
No.

470
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:26,739
Hey. Hi.

471
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,892
Hi.

472
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:28,948
Hi, I'm Lilas.
Nice to meet you.

473
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:30,387
Hi, nice to meet you.

474
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:31,604
Thank you very much for letting

475
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:33,268
me stay at your place.

476
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:34,485
Yeah.

477
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,486
I'm very grateful.

478
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:39,382
- Hey Rainbow.
- Hi.

479
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:40,758
You look cute today.

480
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,453
Thank you.

481
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:43,454
Well, I need to go.

482
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,375
Bye.

483
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,928
Do you want to see
a 2-D movie tonight

484
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,279
or a 3-D movie?

485
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,720
We have Shabbat dinner tonight

486
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:54,721
with your parents.

487
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,280
I'm picking you up at 7:00.

488
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,464
This is for lunch.

489
00:27:57,465 --> 00:27:59,315
I didn't have time to
make something. Maggie...

490
00:27:59,515 --> 00:28:00,281
Okay thanks.

491
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:01,282
Give mommy kiss.

492
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:03,419
I love you.

493
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,345
I've got to go.

494
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:05,346
Bye.

495
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:08,251
It looks like you
have a whole bunch...

496
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:10,556
Okay you have way
to much milk left.

497
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:11,926
Are you going to drink it?

498
00:28:13,662 --> 00:28:15,931
Do you think we should waste it?

499
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:17,968
Okay.
This is what we do.

500
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,811
Do you know why
your name's Rainbow?

501
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:27,391
What do you like better?

502
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:29,472
You like Maggie better
or do you like Rainbow better?

503
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,257
- Rainbow.
- That's a good choice.

504
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:33,914
I think Maggie is a shitty name,

505
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,993
if you ask me personally.

506
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:37,993
Okay you ready?

507
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:39,553
Watch it carefully.

508
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:40,554
Watch carefully.

509
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:42,346
Wow!

510
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:44,509
Whoa! Did you see that?

511
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,877
All right, do not
drink that milk.

512
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:04,806
Hello Studio.

513
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:05,959
Hey, this is Leeward.

514
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,496
I mean my name is Leeward.

515
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,182
How much does it cost to record?

516
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:10,663
We can
do one-day recording

517
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:13,561
and burn 100 CDs for
you for only $999.

518
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:18,761
That's $999?

519
00:29:18,762 --> 00:29:20,905
Yeah, dollars.

520
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:21,802
I'm getting very busy.

521
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,003
Do you want to book a day now?

522
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:25,770
No. Okay. I
was just wondering.

523
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:27,595
Okay, just let me know.

524
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:28,596
Thanks.

525
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:04,722
Hi.

526
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:05,555
Yes.

527
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:07,731
- Is Adam here?
- He should be downstairs.

528
00:30:07,732 --> 00:30:09,203
Probably be up in just a minute.

529
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:10,420
Okay, thank you.

530
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:11,988
Now what was I just saying?

531
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:12,989
Iptal?

532
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,067
Iptal. Right.

533
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:15,647
It means cancelled in Turkish.

534
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,301
The X.

535
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:19,190
So he's in this...

536
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:20,438
Hi.

537
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:21,910
How are you?
Thanks for coming.

538
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:23,862
Thank you for inviting me.

539
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,982
So what did you bring me?

540
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,806
I brought a roll of film.

541
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,504
It's a sample of
the video project

542
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:29,816
I'm working on.

543
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:30,968
Great.

544
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:32,214
I brought the projector.

545
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:34,456
Perfect. Let me just find
somewhere to plug this in.

546
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,457
Okay, great.

547
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:43,129
- Adam?
- Yes?

548
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,130
What is this?

549
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:46,267
The labyrinth.

550
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:49,453
That is called Mad Mice Maze.

551
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,854
It's by the Italian artist.

552
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,876
He aims at showing
the fragility of life

553
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:56,462
and the severity of destiny.

554
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:14,665
It's tremendous.

555
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,065
Really? You like it?

556
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:17,280
Like it? I love it.

557
00:31:17,281 --> 00:31:18,882
I mean it's beyond
my comprehension.

558
00:31:18,883 --> 00:31:20,610
I don't even know
how to explain it.

559
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:22,402
Actually, you're
the first one to see it.

560
00:31:22,403 --> 00:31:24,354
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

561
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:26,076
I just finished the
editing yesterday.

562
00:31:26,276 --> 00:31:27,714
I love it.

563
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:29,635
I mean it's just...
the way you capture

564
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:32,740
people's emotions it's
like there's no camera at all.

565
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:34,564
It's magical.

566
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:37,444
Listen, my boss George
he's been commissioned

567
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:40,198
by PS1 to find new and
emerging talent for

568
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,766
his upcoming show.

569
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,103
Now, he's very demanding
but if you can promise

570
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:46,343
you can get a project
to me, a full project...

571
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:48,134
Sure.

572
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,318
Two weeks.

573
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm going to see
what I can do okay?

574
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:52,231
That would be amazing.

575
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:53,449
Thank you so much.

576
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,505
Well I mean it was amazing.

577
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:56,729
I have to do it.
It's the least I can do.

578
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,376
I don't know what to say.

579
00:31:58,377 --> 00:31:59,882
Just say you'll do it.

580
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,125
Allo?

581
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Mom?

582
00:32:14,444 --> 00:32:15,918
No, no! I'm not coming back.

583
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:18,110
I'm staying in New York.

584
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,329
I met a gallery curator and...

585
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:25,679
How could you say that?

586
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,312
You've never even seen my work!

587
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:29,737
Allo?

588
00:32:30,737 --> 00:32:32,580
I can't hear you,
I'm on the subway!

589
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:34,457
You're breaking up!

590
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:37,018
Bye, bye, bye!

591
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,619
Okay, occupation?

592
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:41,864
I'm an artist.

593
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:43,049
Okay, do you have any proof

594
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,330
that your art has been shown

595
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,340
in an official art venue?

596
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,546
No, actually it
hasn't been shown in

597
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:52,587
an official venue.

598
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:53,931
Okay, but to get a visa

599
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:57,004
as an artist you can't
just say, "I'm an artist."

600
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:58,892
You know?

601
00:34:58,893 --> 00:35:01,133
I mean I could say, "I'm
an artist. I'm an artist."

602
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,956
But that doesn't
make me an artist.

603
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:08,814
Okay? Unfortunately,
then we are not able

604
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,024
to do anything for you.

605
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:11,888
It has to be shown
at an official venue.

606
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:15,281
But it will
probably be part of the PS1

607
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,593
upcoming show.

608
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:17,808
Okay.

609
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:20,560
All right then. So
you come back and you

610
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:21,803
see me at that point. Okay?

611
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:23,826
How can I come back if I'm not

612
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:25,512
allowed to stay in the meantime?

613
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:32,370
But you need something

614
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:33,683
to back it up.

615
00:35:33,684 --> 00:35:35,675
- You can't...
- Yeah, I know.

616
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:38,270
All right, well I'll ask my boss,

617
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:42,901
but I really don't think that
there's anything that we can do for you.

618
00:35:42,902 --> 00:35:43,902
All right?

619
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:45,822
Hang on.

620
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:18,524
Okay, so the best
we can do is give

621
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:20,375
you a 10-day extension.

622
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:22,973
Okay, but that would be it.

623
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,888
You would not get
another one after that.

624
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:26,942
Okay, sure.

625
00:36:26,943 --> 00:36:27,943
All right?

626
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,601
Thank you. Yeah.

627
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,346
Okay, out we go.

628
00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:38,346
Take my hand.

629
00:36:39,235 --> 00:36:40,594
Come on.

630
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,834
- Benjamin what are you doing?
- Just putting on my tie.

631
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,046
We're going to be late.

632
00:36:46,307 --> 00:36:48,451
Um, I'm going

633
00:36:48,452 --> 00:36:49,558
to do the commercial.

634
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:51,555
What?

635
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:53,122
I'm going to do the commercial.

636
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:54,123
When?

637
00:36:56,228 --> 00:36:58,915
Oh, there's
a hug for capitalism.

638
00:36:58,916 --> 00:36:59,916
Do you love it?

639
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:02,374
Thank you for participating hug.

640
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,620
Oh I do it for you.

641
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,415
Oh Maggie!
Daddy's song is going

642
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:06,416
to be on TV.

643
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,766
Yeah, on the television lady.

644
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:11,752
It's open.

645
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:13,249
It's going to be unbelievable.

646
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:14,976
People are going to be like...

647
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:16,488
Okay, imagine you're watching

648
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:17,736
television and
there's a commercial.

649
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,843
There's a hamburger
and there's my music.

650
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,674
It's going to be juicy
and there's going to

651
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:23,401
be a hamburger and
my music and people

652
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:25,098
are going to hear the
music and they're going

653
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,506
to be like, "I love
this music. I need

654
00:37:26,507 --> 00:37:27,507
a juicy hamburger!"

655
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:29,227
Is that exciting to you?

656
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:30,475
Listen to me.

657
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:33,611
She doesn't care about
the hamburger or my music.

658
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:34,602
I'm really proud of you.

659
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:35,980
You love it. Really?

660
00:37:35,981 --> 00:37:37,196
Are you proud?

661
00:37:37,197 --> 00:37:39,147
Yeah, I think
it's a really great first step.

662
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:41,255
Yeah.
First step to what?

663
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:44,558
To the participation
of the wellbeing

664
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,559
of your family.

665
00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:47,849
That's great.

666
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,826
I don't know,
maybe we could move.

667
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:00,624
What?

668
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,776
Oh is that...

669
00:38:01,777 --> 00:38:03,442
- I didn't know... What'd you say?
- So absurd.

670
00:38:03,443 --> 00:38:04,625
No, what'd you say?

671
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,066
No, I just said
maybe we could move.

672
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,218
You know?

673
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:08,306
Yeah, move right.

674
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:10,386
- You know I make a little money.
- You make a little money.

675
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,203
Well just because I work for Burger Mama
doesn't mean I want to be a property owner.

676
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:14,549
I understand that.

677
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,116
I just thought
maybe we were moving

678
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:19,669
past some of these
infantile notions of...

679
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,852
Oh, man. Come on.

680
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:22,678
- Capitalism.
- Really?

681
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:23,797
What?

682
00:38:23,798 --> 00:38:25,397
Right. You
should read GTTP.

683
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:26,614
What is GTTP?

684
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:27,668
You know what it is.

685
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,583
Give to the People.

686
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:31,863
If you read it you would see...

687
00:38:31,864 --> 00:38:33,585
I give to the people.

688
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:35,703
You give to the people?

689
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:36,825
Yeah.

690
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:37,913
What would make
me happy would be

691
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:40,402
to spend some time
with my family

692
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:42,042
and hang out with...

693
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:42,643
Yeah.

694
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,386
Hi.

695
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,387
Hey. Look.

696
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:46,042
How are you?

697
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:47,155
Hey, what's going on?

698
00:38:48,155 --> 00:38:50,875
Nothing
special. How about you?

699
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:51,925
You're very dressed up.

700
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,276
Yeah.

701
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:56,477
We're going to a family thing.

702
00:38:56,478 --> 00:38:58,268
Cool. I love family things.

703
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,741
- You do?
- Yeah.

704
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:01,111
Do you like this kangaroo?

705
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,630
Is it sweet?

706
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:04,583
It's soft.

707
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,072
Look, he likes her.

708
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:12,256
PS1 that's great.

709
00:39:12,257 --> 00:39:13,406
Does that mean you're staying?

710
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:15,161
Yes.
Actually a week or two.

711
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:19,040
Would it be possible by
chance to crash on your

712
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:21,569
couch a few more days?

713
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,708
Yeah, sure.

714
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:29,708
Woops.

715
00:39:33,476 --> 00:39:34,476
Excuse me.

716
00:39:35,302 --> 00:39:36,302
Sir!

717
00:39:36,692 --> 00:39:38,149
Would you fill up for me please?

718
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,268
Put it on. Put it on.

719
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:40,453
You hear me?

720
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:41,669
Yeah?

721
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,487
Would you fill up for me please?

722
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:46,759
What the
hell are you waiting for?

723
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,129
I don't have all goddamn
night. Move your ass.

724
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:57,411
Finally!

725
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:14,806
No. Don't film me.
Please, please, please.

726
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:22,806
Thank you.

727
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:28,558
Here.

728
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,870
No, no, no.

729
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:30,871
He paid for it.

730
00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:43,728
They're here. Hello.

731
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:48,499
Shabbat Shalom.

732
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,906
This is our friend Lilas.

733
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:50,907
Hi Lilas.

734
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,612
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi Jacob. How are you?

735
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:06,288
Mary! You
don't feed him or what?

736
00:41:07,288 --> 00:41:08,855
Doesn't she feed you?

737
00:41:08,856 --> 00:41:10,804
- Nice to meet you Lilas.
- She barely feeds me.

738
00:41:13,496 --> 00:41:14,970
Oh, what have you got there?

739
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:16,502
What is that?

740
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:18,712
This is a box for you.

741
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:19,928
It's a hat box.

742
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:21,145
Well, what do you think?

743
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,033
- Do you think it's for you?
- Is it for me?

744
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:24,218
Okay, it's for you.

745
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:26,201
- Do you know what it is?
- Neither do I?

746
00:41:26,202 --> 00:41:27,578
Here we
go. Look at that.

747
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:29,883
Oh wow! Oh my God!

748
00:41:29,884 --> 00:41:32,859
Oh, it's so elegant and big.

749
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,011
Where will I wear it?

750
00:41:34,012 --> 00:41:35,292
I'll wear it to...

751
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,828
Oh the ladies in the
mahjahonng club will...

752
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,556
Wait until they
see, and it's pink.

753
00:41:38,557 --> 00:41:40,189
- What do you think?
- My favorite.

754
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,276
Let's see it.

755
00:41:41,277 --> 00:41:42,751
We celebrate the seventh day

756
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:45,175
of rest and family reunion.

757
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:48,415
You cannot have any
activities that relate

758
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:49,416
to work.

759
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:51,488
Okay. Like what?

760
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:52,489
It means you can't

761
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:57,153
handle money, you
can't handle fire.

762
00:41:57,154 --> 00:41:58,497
And that's why people

763
00:41:58,498 --> 00:42:00,288
who are late who are responsible

764
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:04,251
for us having a cold meal
tonight and no smoking.

765
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:06,251
Are those for me?

766
00:42:07,012 --> 00:42:08,276
That's really beautiful.

767
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,995
You know it's your
birthday next week.

768
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:13,981
We're going to have
a big party for you.

769
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:15,997
Do you know how old
you're going to be?

770
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:17,477
Four!

771
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:18,756
Wow!

772
00:42:18,757 --> 00:42:20,100
You're a big girl now?

773
00:42:20,101 --> 00:42:22,404
So big.
She's going to school next year.

774
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:24,997
Why does she have to go to school?
Look how well she draws.

775
00:42:24,998 --> 00:42:26,598
And she makes music too.

776
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:28,127
She learns a lot with her daddy.

777
00:42:28,327 --> 00:42:30,432
Listen.
School is bullshit.

778
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:33,607
Parents who don't care
for their children

779
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:35,368
well they just send
them to school.

780
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:36,743
So, how is your music going?

781
00:42:36,744 --> 00:42:37,959
Well if you guys want to know

782
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,073
the honest truth I
am going to record

783
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:41,256
an album.

784
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:42,257
What?

785
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,169
An album really?

786
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,897
Oh that's great.

787
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,426
I'm just
joking. Stupid.

788
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:49,676
That's not great.

789
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:51,466
But actually
he's composing music

790
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:53,803
for a commercial.

791
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,908
Yeah,
yeah. A commercial.

792
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:59,437
Isn't that going to interfere
with working on your own music?

793
00:42:59,438 --> 00:43:01,613
It's going to be for hamburgers.

794
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:03,725
I'm going to make juicy music

795
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:06,317
for juicy non Kosher hamburgers.

796
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,406
Oh, that's terrible.

797
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:09,007
You're going to lose
your creativity.

798
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,254
Don't do it!

799
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,297
It's a very, very creative job.

800
00:43:13,297 --> 00:43:14,613
It's a very creative job.

801
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,489
Commercials are evil.

802
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:19,345
You should all be talking to...

803
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,969
What do you want me to draw?

804
00:43:21,813 --> 00:43:23,761
You know anything
you want sweetheart.

805
00:43:23,762 --> 00:43:26,930
And it's bringing good
money. So that's great.

806
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:28,082
Come on. Let's go.

807
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,459
Well, that's your business.

808
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,826
Well he isn't a child.
He can hold down a job like the rest of us.

809
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:32,827
He works.

810
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,676
He has a lot to
do with his music.

811
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:35,924
What do you want a drawing of?

812
00:43:35,925 --> 00:43:37,460
Can you draw me a house?

813
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:38,484
Sure I can.

814
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:39,316
Okay.

815
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,531
Thank you.

816
00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:42,286
What does Leeward really mean?

817
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:44,339
Oh Grandma, come on.

818
00:43:44,775 --> 00:43:46,517
I told you a million
times, come on.

819
00:43:46,518 --> 00:43:47,734
I know you did, but my brain

820
00:43:47,735 --> 00:43:49,975
is old and I'm
just getting older.

821
00:43:49,976 --> 00:43:53,303
Anyway, I have a little
something for you.

822
00:43:53,304 --> 00:43:54,551
Okay?

823
00:43:54,552 --> 00:43:55,863
Here.

824
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:57,111
My favorite
candy. Thank you.

825
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:58,968
Yeah, well it's not all.

826
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,504
I have something else.

827
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:04,120
I know it's Sabbath
and I know I should not

828
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:06,970
handle money, but you need it.

829
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:08,724
So, I felt justified.

830
00:44:09,724 --> 00:44:12,988
It's $2000. It's all
I had, but I hope it's

831
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:14,747
going to be enough
to keep you from

832
00:44:14,748 --> 00:44:16,892
making that commercial.

833
00:44:16,893 --> 00:44:19,325
Grandma this is too much, $2000.
This is too much money.

834
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,444
No, no, no.

835
00:44:20,445 --> 00:44:21,629
It is what I was
going to leave you

836
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:25,982
as your inheritance,
but I may not be dead

837
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,863
but I maybe around a
longer time than I thought

838
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:30,449
and you need it now.

839
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:35,233
All right. Okay.

840
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:41,050
Hey Jacob, dinner is ready.

841
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,483
Okay.

842
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:56,621
Dinner's ready.

843
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:01,029
Leeward, come on in.

844
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,276
We're ready to it.

845
00:45:02,277 --> 00:45:04,239
I'm sorry,
but I just don't think I can do it.

846
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,533
Then the tight
rope walker took off

847
00:45:06,534 --> 00:45:09,407
his shoes gingerly
but unceremoniously.

848
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:14,439
He climbed up again, took
a step, lost his balance

849
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,081
and fell, but he knew
how to fall, like a cat.

850
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:21,450
Eventually he climbed
the rope and took a step

851
00:45:22,027 --> 00:45:24,185
and then started dancing
from foot to foot

852
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,884
to the applause
of the onlookers.

853
00:45:27,884 --> 00:45:31,084
He got to the end, he
turned around, danced

854
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:34,220
back to where he
started and he finally

855
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:36,971
agreed to reveal his secret.

856
00:45:36,972 --> 00:45:39,404
He told them I keep
my eye on where I'm

857
00:45:39,405 --> 00:45:42,246
going, but never
think of falling.

858
00:45:42,846 --> 00:45:44,558
And then he said, "You
know what the hardest

859
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,047
part is? The hardest
part is turning around

860
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,326
because when you
turn around you lose

861
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:51,823
sight of your goal for a second.

862
00:45:51,824 --> 00:45:53,667
The hardest part
is turning around."

863
00:46:04,978 --> 00:46:05,978
Amen.

864
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:24,470
Mom wee-wee.

865
00:46:24,471 --> 00:46:25,663
Okay.

866
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:30,678
Mom wee-wee.

867
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:31,679
Okay, wait for me.

868
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:36,377
You all right?
I'm sorry I hit you in the eye.

869
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,536
She got it in her eye.

870
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:39,832
Here's some water.

871
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41,337
No, keep your eye closed.

872
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:42,634
No, she needs to put some
water on her.

873
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:43,962
Mom wee-wee.

874
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:45,113
No, it happened to your father

875
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:46,745
once and he was told
keep the eye closed.

876
00:46:46,746 --> 00:46:48,346
She can't stay with her eye
closed all night.

877
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,201
Yes, she can.
It's almost bed time.

878
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:51,482
One eye open, one eye closed.

879
00:46:51,483 --> 00:46:52,667
What difference does it make?

880
00:46:52,668 --> 00:46:53,658
Keep it closed.

881
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:54,843
Mom, wee-wee.

882
00:46:54,844 --> 00:46:56,398
All right.

883
00:46:58,331 --> 00:46:59,805
Your eye feeling any better?

884
00:46:59,806 --> 00:47:00,806
Yeah, it's fine.

885
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,741
Wee-wee.
Come on. Wee-wee.

886
00:47:03,742 --> 00:47:05,900
I'm really fed up
with your family though.

887
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,326
If you don't start
asserting yourself,

888
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,638
Benjamin, they're
just going to keep

889
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,167
treating you like a child.

890
00:47:11,168 --> 00:47:12,642
Here we go.
Come on. Wee-wee.

891
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:15,873
Wee-wee. Wee-wee. Wee-wee.

892
00:47:23,691 --> 00:47:25,218
There is a game we play where

893
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:28,052
I blow on her like a
dandelion and she falls.

894
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:32,853
She falls onto the
bed in one piece.

895
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,485
Small people can fall that way.

896
00:47:39,204 --> 00:47:41,221
Yesterday she said
wechother instead of

897
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:42,222
each other.

898
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:45,798
I don't think I'll correct her.

899
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:52,721
She, he, we chother.

900
00:48:06,603 --> 00:48:09,693
Oh. Woo!

901
00:48:11,693 --> 00:48:12,693
Surprise.

902
00:48:13,005 --> 00:48:14,475
Surprise me?

903
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:16,266
But I thought it
was your birthday?

904
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:17,611
It is.

905
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:20,157
Happy Birthday birthday girl!

906
00:48:23,455 --> 00:48:25,165
I can't believe
she's four years old.

907
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:26,413
Can you believe
she's four years old?

908
00:48:26,414 --> 00:48:27,463
No.

909
00:48:28,463 --> 00:48:29,645
Time goes so quickly.

910
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:30,542
Yes, no.

911
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:31,759
You're such a big girl.

912
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,806
Pretty soon you're going to
have to have your own bedroom.

913
00:48:33,807 --> 00:48:36,521
Time for a triple cuddle.

914
00:48:37,521 --> 00:48:38,768
Get over here.

915
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:39,855
Triple cuddle.

916
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:40,856
All for you.

917
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:46,500
What did you make me?

918
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:50,386
Toast, orange juice and tea

919
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:51,826
and a banana.

920
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:53,459
I thought that was a telephone.

921
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:55,829
A telephone
banana. Okay?

922
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:03,765
Hello? Yeah,
no the birthday

923
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:05,871
girl is right here. Hold on.

924
00:49:06,871 --> 00:49:08,831
- It's for you.
- Oh, hello?

925
00:49:12,856 --> 00:49:14,737
How the commercial is going?

926
00:49:15,737 --> 00:49:17,208
It's like it goes...

927
00:49:21,114 --> 00:49:22,489
Hamburger!

928
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,121
Hamburger.
Hamburger time.

929
00:49:25,018 --> 00:49:26,844
It goes hamburger.

930
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:32,890
Tell him that it
sounds good so far.

931
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:34,939
It sounds good so far.

932
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,256
Well thank
you. Thank you.

933
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:40,317
Tell Daddy it's for him and ask

934
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:42,871
him why he never
wrote mommy a song.

935
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,622
- It's for you.
- Hello?

936
00:49:46,623 --> 00:49:50,168
Why didn't you
never wrote mom a song?

937
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:52,695
Maybe I
have. Maybe I haven't.

938
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,408
Okay. Have they paid you?

939
00:49:57,409 --> 00:49:58,560
The commercial?

940
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:00,552
They gave me $1000.

941
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:03,105
When are they going to pay you

942
00:50:03,106 --> 00:50:04,106
the other $4000?

943
00:50:04,353 --> 00:50:05,353
Soon.

944
00:50:06,018 --> 00:50:07,489
Soon like this week?

945
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:09,755
Well, the $1000
is just an advance.

946
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:12,420
But they like the music, so...

947
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,789
I have a surprise for you.

948
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:19,843
- For who?
- For you.

949
00:50:19,844 --> 00:50:20,844
What is it?

950
00:50:21,094 --> 00:50:22,831
I can't tell
you. It's a surprise.

951
00:50:23,206 --> 00:50:25,438
Will you meet me
tomorrow at 4:00?

952
00:50:26,438 --> 00:50:27,965
Meet me outside the hospital.

953
00:50:28,231 --> 00:50:30,631
Really?
That sounds weird.

954
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:31,750
Kind of.

955
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:33,015
You're being mysterious.

956
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:34,992
Will you do it?

957
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:37,777
Yeah we'll be there.

958
00:50:40,777 --> 00:50:43,209
- I'm late.
- Yeah? Wait.

959
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,210
Bye, bye.

960
00:50:47,306 --> 00:50:48,833
What do you want to do today?

961
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,538
Listen! I have the
most important thing

962
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:51,691
I have to tell you.

963
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:53,604
I have to tell you
something very, very...

964
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:54,804
No I'm serious.

965
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,035
This is going to save your life.
You're not listening.

966
00:50:57,036 --> 00:50:58,036
Okay.

967
00:51:02,255 --> 00:51:03,911
What are you doing?

968
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:06,079
I'm sleeping.

969
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,079
Okay. Goodnight.

970
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:35,187
Hey.

971
00:51:35,188 --> 00:51:36,660
Hey, how's it going?
Oh is that the project?

972
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:38,547
- Yes.
- Oh, that looks nice.

973
00:51:38,548 --> 00:51:39,316
Thank you.

974
00:51:39,317 --> 00:51:40,500
How you feel?

975
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:41,997
I think that I'm
pretty happy with it.

976
00:51:42,197 --> 00:51:43,197
That's cool.

977
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,308
Can you watch Rainbow?

978
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,383
Yes, of course.

979
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:48,490
All right. Thank you.

980
00:51:54,297 --> 00:51:55,297
Bye, see you.

981
00:52:03,034 --> 00:52:04,154
Lila, it's mom.

982
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:05,593
I need you to call
me right away.

983
00:52:05,594 --> 00:52:07,474
It looks like you're still
buying that PS1 crap.

984
00:52:07,483 --> 00:52:09,330
Being an artist is not
that easy, you know?

985
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,482
Some buy led you on
and you fell for it.

986
00:52:11,483 --> 00:52:12,634
You know what?

987
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:14,393
I'm canceling my appearance in Berlin
because of you.

988
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:15,578
I'm coming to that MoMa thing

989
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:16,948
and I'm bringing you home.

990
00:52:40,097 --> 00:52:41,183
Leeward did you say?

991
00:52:41,184 --> 00:52:42,305
Yeah.

992
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:44,096
- That's an unusual name.
- Yeah.

993
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:45,698
- Well anyway, how are you?
- Yeah wow.

994
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:47,489
- Check it out.
- Cool.

995
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,314
- It's a nice place, right?
- Yeah.

996
00:52:49,315 --> 00:52:50,499
Anyway, this is why you want

997
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,714
to come to a studio,
all this kind of gear.

998
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:53,506
So we have a good
selection of mics.

999
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:54,692
Yeah.

1000
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:57,540
We have old back there.
We have all kind of...

1001
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,812
- Can I see this?
- Yeah, go ahead.

1002
00:52:59,813 --> 00:53:00,813
It's a tube mic.

1003
00:53:01,766 --> 00:53:03,493
- What's this?
- It's a powerful mic.

1004
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:04,964
It's a tube mic.

1005
00:53:04,965 --> 00:53:06,212
We've got all the mics
you're going to need.

1006
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:07,397
Believe me.

1007
00:53:07,398 --> 00:53:09,279
Here we've got a
piano, keyboards.

1008
00:53:10,279 --> 00:53:11,279
We've got a B3.

1009
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:17,616
This was at Woodstock
with Sly Stone.

1010
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:19,536
Knock yourself out.

1011
00:53:19,802 --> 00:53:23,043
We've got Annie Lennox
and Dave Stewart in here all the time.

1012
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,265
Wow.

1013
00:53:24,266 --> 00:53:25,417
Yeah, he
lives around the corner.

1014
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:26,537
All these people
pretty much recorded

1015
00:53:26,538 --> 00:53:27,625
here and live in
the neighborhood.

1016
00:53:27,626 --> 00:53:28,265
Really?

1017
00:53:28,266 --> 00:53:30,058
- The Eurythmics?
- Yeah, Annie Lennox?

1018
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:31,754
- The Cars?
- Yeah, absolutely.

1019
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:32,810
Ric Ocasek. Yeah.

1020
00:53:32,811 --> 00:53:33,996
Whoa.

1021
00:53:42,462 --> 00:53:43,821
What do you think? Sounds good?

1022
00:53:43,822 --> 00:53:44,973
Yeah.

1023
00:53:44,974 --> 00:53:46,573
If you need any drums
I'm here for you.

1024
00:53:46,574 --> 00:53:48,462
- I have funny drums.
- Okay.

1025
00:53:48,463 --> 00:53:49,486
Electronic funny drums.

1026
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:51,341
All right, sure.
Well we can make that happen too.

1027
00:53:51,342 --> 00:53:53,359
- You know Gigi Allen?
- No.

1028
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,872
I... used to play with him
when I was a kid.

1029
00:53:54,929 --> 00:53:56,584
- Who is it?
- This guy was like an outlaw punk.

1030
00:53:56,784 --> 00:53:57,904
Yeah.

1031
00:53:57,905 --> 00:53:59,759
He was supposed to kill
himself on stage.

1032
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,881
What are these his teeth?

1033
00:54:00,882 --> 00:54:02,033
This is his real teeth.

1034
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:03,185
When I was a kid I
used to play with him.

1035
00:54:03,186 --> 00:54:04,305
He took a mic and
smashed his teeth.

1036
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:06,480
I picked it up and
my friend made a necklace out of it.

1037
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:08,075
Anyway, we've got a lot
of history in this place.

1038
00:54:08,275 --> 00:54:09,489
It should make you...

1039
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,379
Take it in and use
it for your recording

1040
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,595
and make it what you want.

1041
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:14,092
So $999.

1042
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:16,692
Okay, and so I've got cash.

1043
00:54:16,693 --> 00:54:17,812
Yeah, that's fine.

1044
00:54:17,813 --> 00:54:19,708
That's what I accept.
US is good too.

1045
00:54:19,908 --> 00:54:22,133
I have all this cash.
It's already ready to go.

1046
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,413
Okay. All right.

1047
00:54:23,414 --> 00:54:24,414
All right.

1048
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,795
I trust
you. I'll count it later.

1049
00:54:27,094 --> 00:54:28,245
I trust you.

1050
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:30,038
Absolutely. No problem.

1051
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,605
Don't be upset. It's
going to be all right.

1052
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:32,821
It's going to be all right.

1053
00:54:32,822 --> 00:54:33,822
I'm excited.

1054
00:54:34,126 --> 00:54:35,863
All right here we
go. Let's do it.

1055
00:54:35,864 --> 00:54:37,368
Come out of there.
Get out of there.

1056
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:38,776
Here we go dry you off.

1057
00:54:38,777 --> 00:54:39,928
Dry you off. Okay.

1058
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:41,752
Are you ready? Are you hungry?

1059
00:54:41,753 --> 00:54:42,712
Yes. Yes.

1060
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:43,825
Okay, okay. Here we go.

1061
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:44,870
Guess what we're going to have?

1062
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,296
We're going to have
guacamole. Are you ready?

1063
00:54:46,297 --> 00:54:47,297
Guacamole?

1064
00:54:48,007 --> 00:54:49,113
Guacamole. Guacamole.

1065
00:54:49,114 --> 00:54:50,203
Guacamole.
Go, go, go, go.

1066
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,803
Get dressed. Get
dressed. Here he comes.

1067
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:52,804
Go get dressed.

1068
00:54:54,556 --> 00:54:56,820
Fernando, here he comes.
Your favorite food.

1069
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,016
I can hear him
coming up the stairs.

1070
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:07,165
Your favorite food.
Come on here he comes.

1071
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:08,509
I can hear him
coming up the stairs.

1072
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,462
Here he comes!
Come on! Here we go! Here we go!

1073
00:55:10,463 --> 00:55:11,966
Woo! Woo!

1074
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:13,245
Oh he's almost here.
He's almost here.

1075
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:14,352
Here comes your food.

1076
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,063
Hey.

1077
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:18,248
Hi. Is Shiraz here?

1078
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:20,201
No.

1079
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:22,080
You don't happen to know

1080
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:23,130
where Lilas lives?

1081
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,497
Um, no I don't.

1082
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:28,450
Can you have Shiraz
give this to her?

1083
00:55:28,451 --> 00:55:29,826
From Leo.

1084
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,067
Shiraz to give this to Lilas.

1085
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:33,698
- I see. Okay.
- Please.

1086
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:35,693
- Oh, Fernando.
- Hi. For deliver.

1087
00:55:37,123 --> 00:55:38,123
It's 15 bucks.

1088
00:55:41,932 --> 00:55:43,301
Will you give this to him?

1089
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:45,156
Will you give this to Fernando?
Give that to him.

1090
00:55:45,157 --> 00:55:46,917
Tell him to keep the change.

1091
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:48,549
Keep the change.

1092
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,926
Thank you.

1093
00:55:49,927 --> 00:55:51,007
Have you guys eaten?

1094
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:52,638
Fernando, have you eaten?

1095
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:53,838
Not yet.

1096
00:55:55,304 --> 00:55:56,353
Nothing special.

1097
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,792
The free special.

1098
00:55:58,793 --> 00:55:59,793
Yeah.

1099
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:03,106
It wouldn't just
fly to us by itself.

1100
00:56:04,106 --> 00:56:05,106
Right.

1101
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:07,562
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1102
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:09,321
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

1103
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:10,322
Bye.

1104
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:36,431
I need to speak to.

1105
00:56:36,432 --> 00:56:38,607
Hi.
Just one second.

1106
00:56:38,608 --> 00:56:39,471
Si, si.

1107
00:56:39,472 --> 00:56:40,624
Hold on one second. Okay?

1108
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:41,625
I just... Let me.

1109
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:44,272
I don't care that he's
in a fucking monastery in Bergamo.

1110
00:56:44,273 --> 00:56:45,808
I need to speak to.

1111
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:47,153
Don't put me on hold.

1112
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,241
Don't put...

1113
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:49,489
Fuck!

1114
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,570
What happened?

1115
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:52,570
The snake died.

1116
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,163
One of the mice must
have had a disease

1117
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:55,164
or something.

1118
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:56,531
I'm sorry.

1119
00:56:56,532 --> 00:56:58,451
Listen, just put that there.

1120
00:56:58,452 --> 00:57:01,428
I'll call you as soon as
I handle all this. Okay?

1121
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:03,604
Don't worry about anything.
Everything's going to be fine.

1122
00:57:03,605 --> 00:57:05,812
No, si, si. Por favor
okay?

1123
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:07,381
- I need to speak...
- Good luck.

1124
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,598
Thank you, bye.

1125
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,421
I need to speak to
. Okay?

1126
00:57:10,422 --> 00:57:11,477
Just put somebody
on the phone that

1127
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:12,584
speaks English. Okay?

1128
00:57:19,032 --> 00:57:20,032
Rainbow!

1129
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:23,864
Daddy. There's Lilas.

1130
00:57:23,865 --> 00:57:25,529
- Oh hey.
- Hey. Hi.

1131
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,129
Hey, how's it going?
How are you?

1132
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,218
Good how are you?

1133
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:30,073
Good. Where
are you going?

1134
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:31,578
Come on Daddy.

1135
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:32,859
We're just well...

1136
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,875
Come on Daddy.

1137
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:37,237
You want to go in the fish shop?

1138
00:57:37,837 --> 00:57:39,259
I guess we're going
in the fish shop.

1139
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,141
- How'd it go?
- I don't know.

1140
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,517
No, they're going to love it.

1141
00:57:43,518 --> 00:57:44,701
You think so?

1142
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:46,650
Yeah, they're
going to love it. I bet.

1143
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:50,814
Wow. Do you
see all these fish?

1144
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:52,605
They're like you.
They're rainbows.

1145
00:57:53,152 --> 00:57:54,731
How does it do with its mouth?

1146
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:01,567
Wow, what is this backpack?

1147
00:58:01,568 --> 00:58:03,937
This is very cool.
My dad made it for me.

1148
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:04,993
Really?

1149
00:58:04,994 --> 00:58:06,626
It has headphones and speakers.

1150
00:58:07,394 --> 00:58:08,576
Wow.

1151
00:58:08,577 --> 00:58:10,305
So I can listen
to my dad's music.

1152
00:58:10,306 --> 00:58:11,424
To what?

1153
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:12,636
She said Justin Bieber.

1154
00:58:12,942 --> 00:58:14,595
- You know him?
- Seriously?

1155
00:58:14,596 --> 00:58:16,872
- Justin Bieber.
- That's not what she said.

1156
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:21,988
Hey. Wow
look at these fish.

1157
00:58:21,989 --> 00:58:23,428
I want that one.

1158
00:58:23,429 --> 00:58:25,093
- Which one?
- That one.

1159
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:26,094
This one?

1160
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:27,726
I want that one.

1161
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:29,957
Okay, wait,
wait, wait. I got it.

1162
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:31,558
Seriously, are
you going to do it?

1163
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:32,559
No, no.

1164
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,567
Hey, could you come
here for a second?

1165
00:58:34,568 --> 00:58:35,752
Is he going to record?

1166
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:37,799
I was just wondering how much
this fish costs.

1167
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,783
The orange one with
the wierd head there.

1168
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:40,837
That one 50 dollars.

1169
00:58:41,065 --> 00:58:44,265
The small one.
How much is that one?

1170
00:58:44,266 --> 00:58:45,897
This one 20.

1171
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:47,562
Okay. Look at that one.

1172
00:58:47,563 --> 00:58:49,546
No, I want that one.

1173
00:58:49,547 --> 00:58:51,106
I know, but
this one is 20 dollars.

1174
00:58:51,306 --> 00:58:53,674
Just look into his eyes.

1175
00:58:53,675 --> 00:58:55,363
I think this one
was born for you.

1176
00:58:55,563 --> 00:58:56,563
I want that one.

1177
00:58:57,036 --> 00:58:58,154
You see that one?

1178
00:58:58,155 --> 00:58:59,339
You see how pretty it is?

1179
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,288
It's a princess fish,
so try this one.

1180
00:59:01,712 --> 00:59:03,660
You like this one?
Let's get this one.

1181
00:59:03,661 --> 00:59:05,868
- We got this one.
- No, I want that one.

1182
00:59:05,869 --> 00:59:08,487
You see how his
head is shaped strange?

1183
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:11,175
No, I want that one.

1184
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:17,040
Let's just say you'd make

1185
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:19,375
somebody very happy if you...

1186
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:21,424
How about 25 dollars?

1187
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:22,640
50 dollars.

1188
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:24,681
Charging people 50 dollars
for this tiny little fish

1189
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,928
that you got for free in the ocean
and then you bring it here

1190
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:28,785
and you put it in
this cage of water,

1191
00:59:28,786 --> 00:59:31,730
and then you expect
people to spend 50 dollars

1192
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:33,426
on this small,
little, tiny fish.

1193
00:59:33,427 --> 00:59:34,707
Fish 50 dollars.

1194
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:36,989
You don't want to pay
you catch yourself.

1195
00:59:43,824 --> 00:59:45,877
All right. Okay.
So you're sure it's 50?

1196
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:50,608
- 50 dollars.
- Okay. Let's see.

1197
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:52,855
Okay, wait a minute here.

1198
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:55,959
Here, that's 50 bucks.

1199
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,645
Actually can I
get a 10 for that?

1200
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:03,889
Thank you.

1201
01:00:04,889 --> 01:00:06,963
Actually can I get
two fives for this?

1202
01:00:07,963 --> 01:00:09,241
And just maybe...

1203
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:10,810
There, that makes 20.

1204
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:11,954
Thank you. Sorry.

1205
01:00:12,554 --> 01:00:14,107
Wait actually can I just get...

1206
01:00:14,108 --> 01:00:15,194
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1207
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,932
Can I get one five
and five ones?

1208
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,308
Thank you. This is
perfect. Thank you.

1209
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:23,100
- Now get out.
- Perfect.

1210
01:00:23,101 --> 01:00:25,030
You're making us very happy.
Thank you so much.

1211
01:00:25,405 --> 01:00:27,927
Thank you.

1212
01:00:28,927 --> 01:00:36,127
I gave him ten dollars
and then I got 50 more.

1213
01:00:36,128 --> 01:00:38,872
- So, I made 40 dollars.
- Hey, whoa.

1214
01:00:39,072 --> 01:00:40,192
That's crazy?

1215
01:00:40,193 --> 01:00:41,600
How did you do that?

1216
01:00:41,601 --> 01:00:42,970
I have an infallible strategy.

1217
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,544
Oh. What strategy?

1218
01:00:44,545 --> 01:00:45,729
Well, it's a secret.

1219
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:47,573
It's a big secret.
I can't tell you.

1220
01:00:55,556 --> 01:00:56,652
Do you hear that?

1221
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:01,179
Gosh, that's driving me nuts.

1222
01:01:01,634 --> 01:01:02,845
Okay, how are we doing?

1223
01:01:03,045 --> 01:01:04,098
Are we almost there?

1224
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:07,742
Hey Ruth, how are you doing?

1225
01:01:08,742 --> 01:01:09,742
Almost ready.

1226
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:12,582
Okay. All
right. We will.

1227
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:13,864
Okay bye.

1228
01:01:37,036 --> 01:01:38,181
Surprise!

1229
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,990
Happy little birthday girl.

1230
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,639
This is chill Phil.

1231
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:51,790
Hello.

1232
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,654
A new friend.

1233
01:01:52,655 --> 01:01:53,935
How are you everyone?

1234
01:01:53,936 --> 01:01:58,257
Happy, happy birthday to you.

1235
01:02:01,936 --> 01:02:07,081
Happy, happy
birthday to Rainbow!

1236
01:02:18,164 --> 01:02:20,852
I'm Rainbow and you're Maggie.

1237
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:24,302
No. I'm Maggie and
you're Rainbow.

1238
01:02:25,302 --> 01:02:26,566
Yes. That's what I said.

1239
01:02:27,063 --> 01:02:29,589
No, that's what I said.

1240
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:31,767
Besides I'm the only princess.

1241
01:02:31,768 --> 01:02:34,128
No, I'm a princess too.

1242
01:02:39,128 --> 01:02:41,464
Hey Rainbow. How are you?

1243
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:42,849
Good.

1244
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:46,970
All right get in.

1245
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,851
Hi.

1246
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:56,732
I hear that parents
that take baths

1247
01:02:56,733 --> 01:02:59,515
with their children,
it helps the children's

1248
01:02:59,516 --> 01:03:00,988
creativity.

1249
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:03,133
- Is that from Give to the People?
- Yeah, Give to the People.

1250
01:03:03,134 --> 01:03:04,630
This guy Joseph White.

1251
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,957
Whoa. Here, you have these.

1252
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:11,222
This guy Joseph White
in 1976 he wrote that.

1253
01:03:12,704 --> 01:03:14,526
And what is
Leeward going to write?

1254
01:03:14,527 --> 01:03:16,287
- What am I going to write?
- Yeah.

1255
01:03:16,288 --> 01:03:17,406
I don't know yet.

1256
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:19,743
I still have to
finish reading it.

1257
01:03:19,744 --> 01:03:20,955
I've got 15 more pages.

1258
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:23,296
Do you have an idea?

1259
01:03:23,297 --> 01:03:24,434
No, not yet.

1260
01:03:30,434 --> 01:03:31,698
Ask her to come with us.

1261
01:03:32,195 --> 01:03:33,301
Can you come with us?

1262
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,291
Where are you going?

1263
01:03:44,838 --> 01:03:46,917
Through the ditch, past the pool

1264
01:03:46,918 --> 01:03:48,902
where we met after school.

1265
01:03:52,902 --> 01:03:55,303
Past the hotel
you're aloof where we

1266
01:03:55,304 --> 01:03:56,585
threw shit off the roof.

1267
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:03,752
And those radiators in
the junkyard, they're

1268
01:04:03,753 --> 01:04:05,160
all runaways.

1269
01:04:05,161 --> 01:04:07,161
Got straight up and ran away.

1270
01:04:09,161 --> 01:04:12,201
In the tower on the
hills, just a relic from

1271
01:04:12,202 --> 01:04:13,866
the old days.

1272
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:15,723
Let's pretend that
we're runaways.

1273
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:18,252
Let's pretend that
we're radiators.

1274
01:04:18,253 --> 01:04:19,990
Let's pretend that
we're runaways.

1275
01:04:48,779 --> 01:04:50,674
Hey, this is
Leeward leave a message.

1276
01:04:50,675 --> 01:04:52,139
Hi honey. It's me.

1277
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,634
I'm here. I'm waiting
for you. I don't know

1278
01:04:55,635 --> 01:04:57,971
where you are, but
I'm just going to go

1279
01:04:57,972 --> 01:05:00,020
directly there so meet
me directly at this

1280
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:05,203
address, 57 Rosarie Street.
It's in Jersey City.

1281
01:05:05,204 --> 01:05:06,204
Okay?

1282
01:05:06,293 --> 01:05:07,293
Okay, I'll see you.

1283
01:05:46,727 --> 01:05:48,885
I know you'll be
very happy in this house.

1284
01:05:49,085 --> 01:05:51,243
Thanks, you have my
numbers call any time.

1285
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,382
Thank you.

1286
01:05:54,143 --> 01:05:56,856
Mary, it's good to see you.

1287
01:05:57,856 --> 01:05:59,383
So there's a lot of interest?

1288
01:06:00,097 --> 01:06:01,663
Oh, yes. Good people.

1289
01:06:01,664 --> 01:06:02,879
They love this place, but
they haven't put their

1290
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,832
name down on anything so
it could still be yours

1291
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,560
if you haven't
changed your mind.

1292
01:06:06,561 --> 01:06:07,803
No, no, no. Of course not.

1293
01:06:08,003 --> 01:06:09,761
I'm just waiting for my husband.

1294
01:06:09,762 --> 01:06:12,225
He should be here any second.

1295
01:06:12,226 --> 01:06:14,069
You know I'm just
going to call him.

1296
01:06:33,143 --> 01:06:35,174
He's been working so
hard on that commercial.

1297
01:06:35,175 --> 01:06:36,357
He should be here any second.

1298
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:37,254
I understand.

1299
01:06:37,255 --> 01:06:38,759
I do need to see a client.

1300
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,680
They're only five minutes away.

1301
01:06:40,681 --> 01:06:42,087
So if you don't mind
I'll just go take care

1302
01:06:42,088 --> 01:06:43,241
of that and I'll be right back.

1303
01:06:43,242 --> 01:06:44,808
Hopefully your husband
will be here too.

1304
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:46,056
Would it be all
right if I were to wait

1305
01:06:46,057 --> 01:06:47,145
inside?

1306
01:06:47,146 --> 01:06:48,424
Sure. Door's unlocked.

1307
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:49,737
I'll be right back.

1308
01:07:26,737 --> 01:07:28,714
- That was awesome. Yeah.
- Oh thanks. I really like your music.

1309
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:30,417
- You did a great job.
- Really?

1310
01:07:30,418 --> 01:07:31,730
Yeah.

1311
01:07:31,731 --> 01:07:33,553
Thank you. Yeah. I like this studio.
It's awesome.

1312
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:35,283
Tell some other people and come
by and do some more too.

1313
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:36,754
Thank you.

1314
01:07:36,755 --> 01:07:38,772
I'll have
your CDs in about an hour.

1315
01:07:38,773 --> 01:07:39,892
An hour? Okay.

1316
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,651
Yeah, so just come back
in like an hour.

1317
01:07:41,652 --> 01:07:43,732
Great, all right thanks.
See you later.

1318
01:07:43,733 --> 01:07:45,267
So you guys want to get ice cream
or something for an hour?

1319
01:07:45,268 --> 01:07:46,388
Ice cream?

1320
01:07:46,389 --> 01:07:47,414
Okay, I'll see you.

1321
01:07:54,454 --> 01:07:55,665
What do you want to do?

1322
01:07:58,295 --> 01:08:00,951
Well, I don't
want to lose this house.

1323
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:01,952
I'm aware of that.

1324
01:08:02,137 --> 01:08:03,822
I have a good feeling about you.

1325
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:05,881
Now, I'm not
supposed to do this,

1326
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:08,312
but this is what I propose.

1327
01:08:08,313 --> 01:08:12,953
You pay half of the
first payment right now.

1328
01:08:12,954 --> 01:08:15,060
I'll hold the house
for you for two days.

1329
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,274
Now in a couple of days
if you change your mind

1330
01:08:17,275 --> 01:08:19,004
the house goes back
on the market and you

1331
01:08:19,005 --> 01:08:20,341
lose your deposit.

1332
01:08:21,341 --> 01:08:22,710
It's the best deal I have.

1333
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,435
Let me just...

1334
01:08:25,436 --> 01:08:26,524
Let me just call
him one more time.

1335
01:08:26,525 --> 01:08:27,325
I'm sorry.

1336
01:08:27,326 --> 01:08:28,326
I understand.

1337
01:08:45,858 --> 01:08:46,858
It's my only offer.

1338
01:08:47,841 --> 01:08:49,994
I do have to go to
another meeting.

1339
01:08:52,994 --> 01:08:54,337
Okay, what do I do?

1340
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:55,496
Okay, so that's a yes.

1341
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,436
I need you to sign right here.

1342
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:03,973
All right I will
need a check from you

1343
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,310
for real estate.

1344
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,701
All right 6% of
119,000 divided by...

1345
01:09:09,702 --> 01:09:12,689
That will be $3570.

1346
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:20,889
Okay.

1347
01:09:22,889 --> 01:09:23,889
You did it.

1348
01:09:25,417 --> 01:09:26,939
Congratulations.

1349
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:30,529
Now you can listen to...

1350
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:32,649
Does it work?

1351
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:33,650
Want some?

1352
01:09:34,314 --> 01:09:35,563
Free CDs.

1353
01:09:35,564 --> 01:09:36,802
Free CDs.
Giving them away.

1354
01:09:37,002 --> 01:09:38,059
Hot. Hot. Hot.

1355
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,978
Free CDs.
Free CD for you.

1356
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:41,716
CDs. Free CDs.
CDs. CDs. Free CDs.

1357
01:09:43,564 --> 01:09:44,971
Free CDs.

1358
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,309
Hey, are you coming to
Shiraz's bar for the open mic?

1359
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:48,336
Yeah, sure.

1360
01:09:56,176 --> 01:09:57,966
Hey, hey. Don't
tell your mom about

1361
01:09:57,967 --> 01:09:59,535
the CDs okay?

1362
01:09:59,536 --> 01:10:00,536
Okay.

1363
01:10:17,076 --> 01:10:18,076
Hi.

1364
01:10:23,284 --> 01:10:24,284
Allo?

1365
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:26,438
Hi, Adam. How are you?

1366
01:10:28,438 --> 01:10:29,812
Allo?

1367
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:32,129
Oh, wait a second I
can't hear you very well.

1368
01:10:35,926 --> 01:10:36,822
You okay?

1369
01:10:36,823 --> 01:10:37,936
Yeah, I'm fine. I mean...

1370
01:10:38,136 --> 01:10:39,765
I was waiting for
you for a while.

1371
01:10:39,766 --> 01:10:40,815
Why? What do you mean?

1372
01:10:41,015 --> 01:10:42,015
Because of...

1373
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:43,511
Oh.

1374
01:10:43,512 --> 01:10:44,696
You forgot obviously.

1375
01:10:44,697 --> 01:10:47,113
The surprise
day. Oh. Sorry.

1376
01:10:49,035 --> 01:10:50,457
Ted called and I had to go.

1377
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:53,273
The client was unsatisfied
so there was a problem

1378
01:10:53,274 --> 01:10:54,457
so I had to go fix the problem.

1379
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,921
I had to go over
there. I'm sorry.

1380
01:10:56,922 --> 01:10:58,874
What do you mean the
client was unsatisfied?

1381
01:10:58,875 --> 01:10:59,915
He was just unsatisfied.

1382
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,420
But they're
going to pay you right?

1383
01:11:01,435 --> 01:11:03,515
I don't think so.

1384
01:11:03,516 --> 01:11:04,730
It didn't sound like it.

1385
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:05,884
They have to pay you if you've

1386
01:11:05,885 --> 01:11:07,291
done the work. You
have to get paid.

1387
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:08,932
The client's
unsatisfied with my music.

1388
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:10,366
Yeah, it doesn't
matter if they like

1389
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:12,670
your stuff or are happy with
it or not happy with it.

1390
01:11:12,671 --> 01:11:14,777
If you did the work
you have to get paid.

1391
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:17,423
So call him.

1392
01:11:19,423 --> 01:11:20,639
Right?

1393
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,760
Yeah. That's
what I'm saying I

1394
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:23,200
just talked to him.
I was just there.

1395
01:11:23,201 --> 01:11:24,542
I talked to the guy.
I talked to them.

1396
01:11:24,543 --> 01:11:25,596
Let me talk to them.

1397
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:28,672
- There's no reason for you to call him.
- Yes there is.

1398
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:29,792
First of all, I know Ted.

1399
01:11:29,793 --> 01:11:31,874
What do you want me to do?
You want me to call him up?

1400
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,600
And I just think I'm better at handling
these matters than you.

1401
01:11:33,601 --> 01:11:35,457
You want me to call him
and chew him out in front of you.

1402
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,739
- Is that what you want me to do?
- Yeah. I want you to...

1403
01:11:38,035 --> 01:11:39,876
All right. I got
it. I got it. I got it.

1404
01:11:39,877 --> 01:11:40,739
Go, go, go, go.

1405
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:41,795
Jeez.

1406
01:11:41,796 --> 01:11:43,112
Do whatever you're doing.

1407
01:11:47,078 --> 01:11:48,631
Ted, it's Leeward.

1408
01:11:50,231 --> 01:11:51,685
I'm just calling
you about the money

1409
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:52,990
situation.

1410
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,590
Yeah, I mean I understand that

1411
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:58,215
the client's unsatisfied
but I still don't understand

1412
01:11:58,216 --> 01:12:00,135
the part where I
am not getting...

1413
01:12:00,136 --> 01:12:01,670
Paid for
the hours that you put in.

1414
01:12:01,671 --> 01:12:02,888
I'm not getting paid for all

1415
01:12:02,889 --> 01:12:04,166
the hours that I
worked and put in.

1416
01:12:04,167 --> 01:12:05,992
I mean no, I know you
don't like the music.

1417
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:07,431
I worked very hard on it.

1418
01:12:07,432 --> 01:12:09,063
That's not the point.

1419
01:12:09,064 --> 01:12:10,970
Sorry.

1420
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:14,603
- Let me talk.
- No, no, no.

1421
01:12:14,604 --> 01:12:16,810
No, I know him Benjamin.
Let me talk to him. Stop it.

1422
01:12:16,811 --> 01:12:18,251
Okay, listen.
I'm not going to

1423
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:20,586
work with you if
you act like this.

1424
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:22,009
This is not a fucking joke.

1425
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:23,605
It's not a fucking joke.

1426
01:12:26,605 --> 01:12:28,902
You motherfucker.

1427
01:12:29,902 --> 01:12:31,614
See nothing worked.

1428
01:12:33,614 --> 01:12:35,351
He said the
commercial's canceled.

1429
01:12:36,073 --> 01:12:37,389
It's completely canceled.

1430
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:39,047
So he's not going
to pay me at all.

1431
01:12:39,247 --> 01:12:40,462
That's insane.

1432
01:12:40,463 --> 01:12:42,479
- The whole thing is canceled.
- What?

1433
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,599
The whole thing's canceled.

1434
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,455
What do you mean
the whole thing is canceled?

1435
01:12:45,456 --> 01:12:46,992
That's what
he said? Yeah, anyway.

1436
01:12:46,993 --> 01:12:48,314
Oh well.

1437
01:12:51,314 --> 01:12:53,306
I need you to
get that money somehow.

1438
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:57,715
Can you not do that for a second

1439
01:12:57,716 --> 01:12:59,059
and have this
conversation with me?

1440
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:00,563
Okay, what do you want to talk about?

1441
01:13:00,564 --> 01:13:01,652
I just need you to...

1442
01:13:01,653 --> 01:13:03,667
I'm sorry.
It doesn't sound like it's my fault.

1443
01:13:03,668 --> 01:13:05,107
I don't know whose fault it is,

1444
01:13:05,108 --> 01:13:08,148
but I know that you had
a job and that you worked

1445
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:10,389
and I'm telling you.

1446
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,430
I don't feel like
you're hearing me,

1447
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,957
but we really need that money

1448
01:13:16,152 --> 01:13:17,416
because I did something.

1449
01:13:17,616 --> 01:13:20,599
The best thing we can do is just
pretend that the commercial never existed.

1450
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,600
Right?

1451
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,496
You have an idea that
we have this money that we don't have.

1452
01:13:25,497 --> 01:13:28,505
What are you going to say?
There's nothing you can say.

1453
01:13:28,506 --> 01:13:30,041
He's not a good person.
Just don't talk to him.

1454
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:31,635
Let me see this.

1455
01:13:32,635 --> 01:13:33,635
Stop it.

1456
01:13:39,195 --> 01:13:40,248
Okay. Don't get mad.

1457
01:13:40,652 --> 01:13:43,099
The commercial,
I wasn't even going to do the commercial.

1458
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,260
I never did the commercial.

1459
01:13:44,381 --> 01:13:45,435
What? What?

1460
01:13:45,436 --> 01:13:47,325
- Don't get mad.
- I'm not mad!

1461
01:13:47,326 --> 01:13:48,597
Look at me you're getting mad.
You're getting mad.

1462
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:49,853
I'm not mad.

1463
01:13:49,854 --> 01:13:51,773
I'm trying to understand
what the fuck is going on?

1464
01:13:51,774 --> 01:13:52,701
What do you mean you
didn't do the commercial?

1465
01:13:52,702 --> 01:13:53,853
Don't touch me right now.

1466
01:13:53,854 --> 01:13:55,519
- Did you lie to me?
- No.

1467
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,702
Yes, you did.

1468
01:13:56,703 --> 01:13:58,303
I was under a lot of pressure.

1469
01:13:58,304 --> 01:13:59,679
I don't care
what kind of pressure.

1470
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,279
- Stop it.
- Oh, come on.

1471
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,367
You're being...

1472
01:14:02,368 --> 01:14:03,895
Don't do this in front of her

1473
01:14:04,545 --> 01:14:05,545
Come on.

1474
01:14:06,274 --> 01:14:08,224
Okay, this can't
happen any longer.

1475
01:14:08,225 --> 01:14:09,505
You have to go.

1476
01:14:09,506 --> 01:14:11,553
- What are you doing?
- She has to go.

1477
01:14:11,554 --> 01:14:13,537
- You know what?
- Yeah right...

1478
01:14:13,538 --> 01:14:14,657
This fucking book has to go.

1479
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:16,803
Yeah right.
You want me to go do this commercial?

1480
01:14:16,804 --> 01:14:18,754
Yes, I can't believe
that you lied to me

1481
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:19,810
about this that you...

1482
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:20,836
Hold on. Just give me a second.

1483
01:14:20,837 --> 01:14:21,858
I'm sorry.

1484
01:14:21,859 --> 01:14:23,075
What?

1485
01:14:23,076 --> 01:14:24,925
Mommy, why isn't my fish moving?

1486
01:14:25,846 --> 01:14:27,268
Oh, wait,
wait, wait. Honey.

1487
01:14:27,269 --> 01:14:28,631
Oh God.

1488
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:35,789
Where you going to go?

1489
01:14:43,176 --> 01:14:44,769
Hey it's Adam.

1490
01:14:45,769 --> 01:14:47,769
You know how much I
liked your project.

1491
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,394
I tried talking to them.

1492
01:14:53,097 --> 01:14:54,410
I'm really sorry.

1493
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:57,412
The committee felt
like it lacked originality.

1494
01:14:58,412 --> 01:15:02,341
I mean maybe if your
mother could intervene

1495
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:05,886
they might listen to her.

1496
01:15:07,886 --> 01:15:08,886
Lilas?

1497
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:11,671
Lilas?

1498
01:16:22,764 --> 01:16:24,219
Man hanging upside Hey Lilas.

1499
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,308
Long time no see.

1500
01:16:25,309 --> 01:16:26,461
Hey.

1501
01:16:40,895 --> 01:16:42,929
Come in. It's open.

1502
01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:46,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1503
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:49,747
A little what?

1504
01:16:51,747 --> 01:16:57,436
Hi. I got your letter.

1505
01:17:06,436 --> 01:17:10,309
I'd like to say
that I'm sorry for

1506
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,686
the way I left.

1507
01:17:15,686 --> 01:17:16,920
What do you want?

1508
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,920
I don't know.

1509
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:24,056
You want to leave again?

1510
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:27,688
You love me?

1511
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:29,353
You want to be an artist?
You want to be an animal?

1512
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:32,296
You want to be safe?

1513
01:17:32,297 --> 01:17:33,682
You want to be pretty?

1514
01:17:36,366 --> 01:17:37,419
You want to love me?

1515
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,420
You want to leave?

1516
01:17:38,972 --> 01:17:40,170
You want to be tied up?

1517
01:17:40,171 --> 01:17:41,476
You want to be let go?

1518
01:17:42,476 --> 01:17:44,161
Why are you still painting that?

1519
01:17:46,796 --> 01:17:48,323
Because I love this painting.

1520
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:51,596
And who's that girl?

1521
01:17:51,597 --> 01:17:54,702
Christina, from
Hungary, is lovely,

1522
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,237
but she wouldn't be here
if you didn't leave.

1523
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,453
Yeah.

1524
01:17:57,454 --> 01:17:58,734
And you're still
here. Look at who it is.

1525
01:17:58,735 --> 01:18:00,430
Yeah, I guess I should go.

1526
01:18:00,431 --> 01:18:02,158
- Why?
- Why did you come?

1527
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,755
I don't know. Bye Leo.

1528
01:19:00,828 --> 01:19:02,491
Hi.

1529
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:03,772
What's up?

1530
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:04,955
Where is Leeward?

1531
01:19:04,956 --> 01:19:06,116
I don't
know. He didn't show.

1532
01:19:06,173 --> 01:19:07,644
Why?

1533
01:19:07,645 --> 01:19:08,859
I don't know. He's
supposed to go on at nine.

1534
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:11,071
We had to put someone
else in front of him.

1535
01:19:13,023 --> 01:19:15,447
That bitch.
That's fantastic.

1536
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:17,501
You okay?

1537
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:18,846
Yeah, I'm okay.

1538
01:19:18,847 --> 01:19:20,670
PS1 found my art shitty.

1539
01:19:20,671 --> 01:19:21,854
I'm so sorry.

1540
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:24,608
My visa is going
to expire in two days,

1541
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:26,943
but I'm really
fine. Can't you see?

1542
01:19:26,944 --> 01:19:29,216
Don't put the fuck about
the visa. Okay?

1543
01:19:29,217 --> 01:19:30,464
Do like I did, okay?

1544
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,706
I come here, I meet
this guy Pablo.

1545
01:19:32,707 --> 01:19:34,444
I sleep on his
floor for one year.

1546
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:36,961
Nothing come from me. Okay?

1547
01:19:36,962 --> 01:19:39,299
You just overstay and rock on.

1548
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,300
Rock on girl!

1549
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:42,852
Rock on girl!

1550
01:19:42,853 --> 01:19:44,804
Do like me, I've
been fucked by Pablo

1551
01:19:44,805 --> 01:19:47,716
and all the other jankies in this pub,
but that's fine.

1552
01:19:47,717 --> 01:19:49,540
I don't need a visa for that.

1553
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:50,532
That's great.

1554
01:19:50,533 --> 01:19:51,533
Give me the glass.

1555
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,318
Rock on girl.

1556
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:54,530
Okay, you need to stop.

1557
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,123
Do you want to talk?

1558
01:19:58,471 --> 01:19:59,630
Lilas?

1559
01:20:27,499 --> 01:20:28,973
Well, I assume the PS1 thing

1560
01:20:28,974 --> 01:20:33,221
didn't pan out or you
would answer the phone.

1561
01:20:34,221 --> 01:20:35,751
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1562
01:20:36,751 --> 01:20:38,350
Your message has been deleted.

1563
01:20:38,351 --> 01:20:39,725
New message.

1564
01:20:39,726 --> 01:20:41,516
Lilas, I asked
you to call me back.

1565
01:20:41,789 --> 01:20:44,105
I don't have any news,
I'm starting to worry.

1566
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:46,200
So, callm e back.
Call me right away!

1567
01:20:46,672 --> 01:20:48,496
Your message has been deleted.

1568
01:20:48,497 --> 01:20:49,776
New message.

1569
01:20:49,777 --> 01:20:51,313
Lilas, it's very late in Paris.

1570
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:52,754
I'm going to bed.

1571
01:20:52,755 --> 01:20:54,955
I'll be in New York tomorrow
for the MOMA retrospective.

1572
01:20:55,091 --> 01:20:56,355
I hope to see you there.

1573
01:20:58,131 --> 01:20:59,555
I miss you.

1574
01:21:50,109 --> 01:21:51,846
Hey.

1575
01:21:54,846 --> 01:21:56,268
Can you sing a song for me?

1576
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,039
Please.

1577
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:03,079
Yes.

1578
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:10,761
Let's see...

1579
01:22:18,722 --> 01:22:21,243
Flashlights on the concrete,

1580
01:22:22,243 --> 01:22:28,899
today in every paper
we read that he never

1581
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:34,982
made a sound, drove a
gentle boy from town.

1582
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:40,679
So, latch the windows as
families take their rest

1583
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:45,034
and she said this is how
I like the house the best.

1584
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:54,952
- What are you...
- Come here.

1585
01:22:54,953 --> 01:22:56,297
What are you doing? Come here.

1586
01:22:56,298 --> 01:22:58,474
Come on. Lay down.

1587
01:22:58,475 --> 01:22:59,528
Come on. Here, here.

1588
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:01,076
Just lay down okay.

1589
01:23:18,448 --> 01:23:21,614
Here. There you go. All right?

1590
01:23:21,615 --> 01:23:23,352
You should go to
sleep, all right?

1591
01:23:23,889 --> 01:23:24,921
Okay.

1592
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:28,921
Hey.

1593
01:23:32,403 --> 01:23:33,403
Finish the song.

1594
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:52,206
Flashlights on the concrete.

1595
01:23:53,206 --> 01:23:58,263
Today in every paper we read

1596
01:23:58,264 --> 01:24:01,943
that he never made a sound.

1597
01:24:01,944 --> 01:24:07,569
Drove a gentle boy from
town so latch the windows

1598
01:24:08,569 --> 01:24:12,889
as families take their
rest and she said this

1599
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:17,978
is how I like the
house the best when all

1600
01:24:17,979 --> 01:24:21,173
I hear is nothingness.

1601
01:25:11,173 --> 01:25:13,173
Maggie, what kind
of pizza do you want?

1602
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:15,823
Maggie!

1603
01:25:16,327 --> 01:25:18,117
I'm sorry. Can you
hold on one sec?

1604
01:25:19,143 --> 01:25:20,143
Hey!

1605
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:21,648
Maggie.

1606
01:25:24,215 --> 01:25:25,736
Can you take your headphones off

1607
01:25:25,737 --> 01:25:26,737
for a second honey?

1608
01:25:30,506 --> 01:25:31,539
I'm talking to you.

1609
01:25:38,539 --> 01:25:39,750
Come on take these off.

1610
01:25:43,693 --> 01:25:44,693
Hey!

1611
01:28:11,434 --> 01:28:13,377
One at a time please.

1612
01:28:13,977 --> 01:28:15,937
Mister with the blue shirt,
what is your question?

1613
01:28:16,106 --> 01:28:17,993
- I
- don't mean to be rude,

1614
01:28:17,994 --> 01:28:19,843
but don't you think it's
a little bit too easy?

1615
01:28:20,043 --> 01:28:22,675
Do you think art can be
just one color or one plan?

1616
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:24,778
How can you account

1617
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:26,464
for the simplicity of your work?

1618
01:28:27,372 --> 01:28:28,779
You know, by letting the

1619
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:32,742
untouched parts talk, I
allow reality to take over.

1620
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:36,058
I merely act as a sort
of catalyst, a filter.

1621
01:28:37,614 --> 01:28:38,925
Do you understand?

1622
01:28:38,926 --> 01:28:40,109
I don't really understand.

1623
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:42,094
What's the link
between emptyness

1624
01:28:42,095 --> 01:28:43,822
and reality?

1625
01:28:43,823 --> 01:28:48,073
Emptiness is filled by the face

1626
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:50,577
and the voice of the Other.

1627
01:28:50,578 --> 01:28:51,736
You often refer to the

1628
01:28:52,752 --> 01:28:55,384
How would you explain your
relationship to the art.

1629
01:28:59,603 --> 01:29:00,603
Mrs. de Castillon?

1630
01:29:02,354 --> 01:29:04,011
The artist is irrelevant.

1631
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:06,764
So is the piece.

1632
01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:10,533
What matters is what
emanates from it.

1633
01:29:12,133 --> 01:29:13,941
What people allow
themselves to see in it.

1634
01:29:13,942 --> 01:29:15,894
That's beautiful, but
concretely I mean...

1635
01:29:15,895 --> 01:29:17,992
What do you see?

1636
01:29:19,992 --> 01:29:21,185
Honestly?

1637
01:29:24,185 --> 01:29:26,569
First I see nothing.

1638
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:31,800
Then a deep nothing,
and then if I really

1639
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:34,354
try hard I can just
my out my shadow.

1640
01:29:35,354 --> 01:29:37,203
Interesting.

1641
01:29:37,803 --> 01:29:39,866
It speaks volumes
about your relationship

1642
01:29:39,867 --> 01:29:41,915
with reality.

1643
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,452
Now if you'll excuse me.

1644
01:29:53,709 --> 01:29:55,036
Mrs.
Castillon says it's part

1645
01:29:55,037 --> 01:29:56,118
of the show.

1646
01:29:57,118 --> 01:29:59,540
Yeah, she'd like the
lights to be switched off.
