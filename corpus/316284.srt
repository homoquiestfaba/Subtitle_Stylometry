1
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,953
Chapter six.

2
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,556
He used to love the city.

3
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,032
Her chrome and glass...

4
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:38,060
her buildings painted
with a hooker's blue eye shadow.

5
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:41,767
Her hills, her beaches...

6
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,572
her sleazy past
all cast a spell on him.

7
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,809
But now it was over.

8
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:52,079
His romance with the city had
gone the way of all the others.

9
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:56,680
The truth is, she was
suffocating him--literally.

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,920
Plus, he'd had it with
her insecurity about her looks.

11
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,527
And her constant need
to have work done to herself.

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,499
Not that he was any prize.

13
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:12,130
He wrote biographies of
the notorious and semi-famous.

14
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,969
A job where
the most important words...

15
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,975
were usually left off the page.

16
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,876
There was his first book,
''Dead Parents Society''...

17
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,743
about the homicidal
high school twins.

18
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,611
We ate, like, two rolls
of cookie dough...

19
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,776
and then we shot Mom.

20
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,446
You're not gonna put that
in the book, are you?

21
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,387
The part about the cookie dough?

22
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,253
There was the porn star.

23
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,419
Can we just forget about 1972
altogether?

24
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,793
The grandmother
who strangled six men.

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,388
l'd rather you not mention
the part...

26
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,524
where l took his jar of pennies.

27
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,400
And his current subject,
the astronaut.

28
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,337
Where the hell do you come up
with this steaming crap?

29
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,273
Uh, your journal.

30
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,642
l told you, mister,
l had a drinking problem then.

31
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,807
But the drinking problem doesn't
start till chapter nineteen.

32
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,942
Come on!
l just got back from the moon.

33
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,508
l was getting blown every night.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,744
His job was a freak show...

35
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,483
and his love life
wasn't much better.

36
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,822
Still, he believed there was
that one person out there...

37
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,260
who could
make everything OK again.

38
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,762
After exhaustive research...

39
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,698
he was fairly sure
she didn't live in Los Angeles.

40
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,327
Oh, l'm not gonna order
anything.

41
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,030
l brought my oats.

42
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,538
By the way, did l tell you...

43
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,302
l'm getting back together
with my old boyfriend?

44
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,867
l'll have
the lobster and the crab.

45
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,880
l think you're ready
to meet my doctors.

46
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,712
The truth is, he was never
going to find anyone here.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,048
He should have changed cities
years ago...

48
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,713
but, no, here he was...

49
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,621
living in the same house
with the same best friends...

50
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,318
with the same books.

51
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,192
He was never gonna break up
with the city.

52
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:46,221
And then one night,
she kicked him out of bed.

53
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,735
Uh...

54
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,171
Unh! Aah!

55
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,409
Ah. Oh.

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,474
Mom...

57
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,238
Susan, relax. l'm fine.

58
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,505
You know, you haven't asked
how l am once.

59
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,944
Yes.
l'm standing in the doorway.

60
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,971
-Sweetie, it was just a tremor.
-Mom! Mom!

61
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,176
Yeah, it was a big tremor, OK.

62
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,617
l don't know. Three at most.

63
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,018
l mean, four is for,
like, major shock.

64
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,387
That was at least a six.

65
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,393
Dude, l'm talkin' dosage here,
not Richter scale.

66
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,587
All right? Bye.

67
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,323
Dosage. Yeah, of course.

68
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,763
No, Mom, you're not gonna die
from a gas leak.

69
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,461
Why not?
Because your stove is electric.

70
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,093
l got to go. Yeah. Bye.

71
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,467
You OK?

72
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,563
l'm above ground.

73
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,972
This is Donnie.

74
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,276
Donnie, could you go stand
in that doorway over there?

75
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,506
Why?

76
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,072
Well, l've known Owen longer.
l'd rather die with him.

77
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,317
So, who's Donnie?

78
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,084
My waiter at lunch.

79
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,613
Lunch? But it's 2:00 a.m.

80
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,023
You actually spent twelve hours
with the same guy?

81
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,754
Yeah, well, it was a late lunch.

82
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,827
Hello?

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,627
Eileen.

84
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,832
No, l'm fine. How--OK.

85
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,638
Right now?

86
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,337
Yeah, l still have the keys.

87
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,710
OK. OK.

88
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,345
Was that the call?

89
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,113
She wants me to come over.

90
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,348
Oh, it was the call, all right.

91
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,482
The thought of going down
in a quake alone...

92
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,288
without your soft, doughy butt
to hang onto terrified her.

93
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,761
So then she realizes she never
should have dumped you.

94
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,730
Hey, it wasn't a dump.
lt was mutual.

95
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,891
l can't believe
you're going to go over there...

96
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,126
after she dumped you.

97
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,361
Would you really take
Eileen back?

98
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,870
Well...l mean,
she did cheat on me.

99
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,030
Mm-hmm.

100
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,198
-And leave me.
-Yeah.

101
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,368
And, you know, she made
last year totally miserable.

102
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,570
Uh-huh.

103
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,808
But on the other hand, it takes
a pretty special woman...

104
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,546
to make you feel that shitty,
so, yeah, l might.

105
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,614
l'm sorry.
We can't let you do that.

106
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,885
Dude, she's right.
We're going with you.

107
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,721
Let's go.

108
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,527
l've been thinking
a lot about us lately...

109
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,826
and we can't just
keep on standing still.

110
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,661
l totally agree.

111
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,827
Yeah. l--l mean,
it's been a whole year...

112
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,233
since we've been going out...

113
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,238
and l still haven't found
anybody that l liked.

114
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:43,402
Me, neither. l--l think
it's time we moved forward.

115
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,308
Oh, God. l am so glad
to hear you say that.

116
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,903
l mean,
l was sitting here tonight...

117
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,074
and watching the walls
crack around me...

118
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,380
and waiting for the pool
to fall through the roof...

119
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,976
and obliterate me...

120
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,319
and suddenly,
it was all very clear to me.

121
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,087
l saw my future--the house...

122
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,754
the white picket fence,
the kids...

123
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,092
but l didn't see you.

124
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,330
Uh, w-well, maybe l was at work.

125
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,337
Or the hardware store.
Was it a Saturday?

126
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,339
l was probably out
buying fertilizer.

127
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,897
No, no. l didn't see you...

128
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,432
because you're not
a part of my future.

129
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:21,880
l'm sorry, but l just--
l can't meet anybody...

130
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:26,283
with you
just waiting around for me.

131
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,482
Look, l mean,
this is obviously...

132
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:33,583
just a stress reaction
to a scary event...

133
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,753
like when your mother
got remarried...

134
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,558
and you went out
and bought a kiln.

135
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,224
Ohh! Owen, stop spinning this.

136
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,256
l'm not spinning this!

137
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,360
l'm simply saying that
the lies and the cheating...

138
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,929
and the name-calling,
it's made us stronger.

139
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,235
OK, stop it!

140
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,469
This is not one of
your stupid biographies...

141
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,478
where everybody gets
what they want.

142
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,139
l am never
going to become a D.A...

143
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,013
and you are never
going to become a novelist.

144
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,416
And we are never, ever going
to move back to New England...

145
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,478
and get married. lt's over.

146
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,218
lt is all over.

147
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,419
There!

148
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,395
God, l feel so much better,
don't you?

149
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,145
How could she break up with you?
You weren't even going out.

150
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,911
l don't know what happened.
l mean, she's right, though.

151
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,578
l am always spinning things
to make them look better.

152
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,109
l got to face reality.

153
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,622
-Thai stick?
-Thanks.

154
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,660
l mean, this city has not worked
out for me. l got to get out.

155
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,492
Come on.
You're not going anywhere.

156
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,259
l am. l am leaving.

157
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,767
Hey, honestly, man, l think
you're aiming a little bit high.

158
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,735
Aiming high?

159
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,499
l'm talking about
buying a ticket...

160
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,597
and sitting on a plane
for four hours...

161
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,108
while somebody flies me
to a new destination.

162
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,304
That is
a beautiful theory, man...

163
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,643
but this city's got you
by your cojones.

164
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,845
l mean, look at her.
Ohh, she's beautiful.

165
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,876
You can't turn your back
on that.

166
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,378
Stand back and watch, my friend.

167
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,450
OK. OK.
l'm gonna show you something.

168
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,859
Now, you take this next left.

169
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,695
Historically, this town
has never been easy to escape.

170
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,292
Even the dinosaurs
had a hard time.

171
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,303
Dude, we live in a basin...

172
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,670
and by definition,
a basin contains shit.

173
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,901
That's why there's smog.

174
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,738
Air can't even escape
out of here.

175
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,676
OK, look, so it's finally over
with Eileen.

176
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:33,701
l mean, look on the bright side.

177
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,977
The relationship was shallow,
sexless, and rooted in lies.

178
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,450
Yeah, well, it's not just Eileen
l've been lying about.

179
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,852
lt's every relationship l've
had, every book l've written.

180
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,119
People hire me
to write their life stories...

181
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,887
because l make them look better
than they really are.

182
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,519
l lie!

183
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,427
And you're just now
figuring this out?

184
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,159
No,
l just can't avoid it anymore.

185
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,167
You can't run away
from yourself, Owen.

186
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,327
Your whole life is here.

187
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,837
Yeah, well, my life and l...

188
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,338
have been growing apart
over the years.

189
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,672
l mean, l've been going one way,
and it's been going another.

190
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,233
We're getting
a trial separation.

191
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,404
So, you're breaking up
with your life?

192
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,673
You can't break up
with your life.

193
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,840
You'll just come crawling
right back to it.

194
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,012
You're right.
l've got to kill it.

195
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,652
First, he had to say good-bye
to his support group.

196
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,318
Well, l had a little slip.

197
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,587
Last night,
after the earthquake...

198
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,652
my ex said she was never
coming back to me...

199
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,790
and l realized
that l was lying to myself...

200
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,993
and the people at work...

201
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,469
and everyone else in my life.

202
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,962
And so today,
l've come to tell the truth.

203
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,373
-All right!
-Good for you.

204
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,968
That's nice.

205
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,502
Last night,
l got so deliriously...

206
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,141
rhapsodically stoned...

207
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,208
it was fucking fantastic.

208
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,149
And l realized
that for all the progress...

209
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,280
that we make here at AA...

210
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,518
l mean, we might as well
be getting stoned.

211
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,652
l mean, Keith--Keith
may not be drinking...

212
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,027
but he sent his father
another dead sparrow.

213
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,861
And, Joan,
well, Joan is sober...

214
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,993
but she handed out Halloween
candy naked again this year.

215
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,004
Anyway, take it easy.

216
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,905
l'm leaving town
to start my new life over.

217
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,502
But before l do,
l'm gonna blow a big, fat doob.

218
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,077
-Such a disgrace.
-Mm-hmm.

219
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,892
Owen! Stop! Stop! Owen!
Listen to me, will you?

220
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,758
Listen to me.
lf you don't turn back now...

221
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,127
you will drive yourself
over the edge!

222
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:36,498
Jack, relax. The world is round.

223
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,662
Next, he had to set things
straight at work.

224
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,830
l've made some revisions...

225
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,032
because l feel like
we need to offer...

226
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,700
a more complete account
of events.

227
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,232
The most important thing
is we write a book...

228
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,675
we can both be proud of.

229
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,905
Well, Shakespeare,
there's two things...

230
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:51,508
l want this book to make us--
proud and money. Shoot.

231
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,713
''The competition
for the Apollo mission...

232
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,724
sizzled hotter than
a Houston parking lot in July.''

233
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,157
That's good. l like that.

234
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,752
''l knew the final selection
would come down to politics...

235
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,730
''so l volunteered to pilot
Senator Baldridge's plane.

236
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,096
''That weekend l was ordered...

237
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,862
''to fly some hookers
to Camp David.

238
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,095
''The Soviets were in town...

239
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,036
''and Nixon wanted to make
a good impression.

240
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,800
''The rest is history.
To this day...

241
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,239
''l think if Brezhnev
had not been sated...

242
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,573
''by a little Korean stripper
named Susu...

243
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,101
''l might never have become...

244
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,307
the national hero
that l am today.''

245
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,884
Just who in the fuck
do you think you are?

246
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,547
Oh, yeah? l was gonna ask you
the same question...

247
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,182
because you're definitely
not the guy in the book!

248
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,728
And then came
the hardest part...

249
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,821
the final farewell
to his friends.

250
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,594
What does that mean,
breaking up with your life?

251
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,727
ls that one of the twelve steps?

252
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,862
No, l finally got honest
with myself...

253
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,998
and everyone else in my life.

254
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,099
Cool. Well, good luck, man.

255
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,439
Yeah.

256
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,774
Hey, before l go,
there's something...

257
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,279
l always wanted to tell you.

258
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,679
You remember that guy
on your wedding tape...

259
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,910
who was humping
one of the caterers...

260
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,349
in the video greeting arbor...

261
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,977
and all you could see
was his hairy white ass?

262
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,851
Oh, my God!
You found out who that was?

263
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,880
Yeah! That was me.

264
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,120
-Ahem.
-Ha ha!

265
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,957
Remember when Allison
was into girls...

266
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,363
and you asked me to find out
if she wanted to sleep with you?

267
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,801
Yeah. As l recall, she said
l was a moped with a vagina.

268
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,303
Actually, she didn't say that.
l did.

269
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,902
Heh. That was you?

270
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,278
Yep. Allison actually thinks
you're hot.

271
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:35,142
So l could have been
fucking Allison all this time?

272
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,712
Oh, my God!

273
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,419
Well, if my show's the welfare
cheese of the American mind...

274
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,950
then what the hell's
the crap you write, huh?

275
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,395
You talentless fuckhead!

276
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,127
At least my cheese
doesn't stink.

277
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,500
Well, thanks, Blaine.
l'm glad we could catch up.

278
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,562
Good luck to you, buddy.

279
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,705
What the hell was that about?

280
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,004
l don't know.

281
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,137
l've started speaking
from my heart, you know?

282
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,671
And in about an hour, l'll have
absolutely no friends left...

283
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,207
so there'll be less reason
to come back.

284
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,243
Hey, man, l'm still your friend.

285
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,256
Yeah,
l was just getting to that.

286
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,885
Rob, listen, you're one of
my closest, dearest friends...

287
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,727
so l say this with true love.

288
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,325
Your girlfriend
is a huge screaming cunt.

289
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,995
She's cut you off
from your friends...

290
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,765
and made you take
these anti-depressives...

291
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,569
that have turned you
into a sad, boring ghost...

292
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,768
who leaves parties early
and drinks out of a juice box...

293
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,904
and most likely
sits down to piss.

294
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,573
Trust me.
All your friends agree...

295
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,479
this woman has the brain
of a Pilates machine...

296
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,450
and a heart
the size of a Zoloft.

297
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,112
Dump her!

298
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,780
Hey. What's going on?

299
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,053
Hi! l was just telling Rob here
what a cunt you are...

300
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,490
and how dull you've made him--

301
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,050
Unh!

302
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,392
Fuck you, Owen.

303
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,197
Let's go.

304
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,536
So long, old friend.

305
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,403
l'm gonna miss you.

306
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,973
Well, this is a nice way to say
good-bye to all your friends.

307
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,347
Well, you can't say
l wasn't honest.

308
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,846
Aah. At least l leave
with a clear conscience.

309
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,224
What are you gonna do
when you want to come back?

310
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:26,061
Well, that's the beauty of it.
Now l can't.

311
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,430
Great. Great.

312
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:32,460
So, you trashed your life.
For what?

313
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,835
Ahh.

314
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,468
Well, among other things...

315
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,876
an ex-Soviet
Nobel prize-winning physicist.

316
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,918
l told him l'd give him
his first three chapters...

317
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,444
for free
if he hired me to write his bio.

318
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:55,517
Dear Mr. McCabe, l am most
interested in your proposal.

319
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,085
The sooner
you come to Breighton...

320
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,460
the sooner we can begin.

321
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,625
ln fact, l suggest
you leave immediately...

322
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,862
before there is
another earthquake.

323
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,996
L.A. is a doomed city.

324
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,404
Yours, Vassily Stepniak.

325
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,738
That's...

326
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,676
Wow. Ha!

327
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,339
So, l guess this is, uh...

328
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,043
this is really it.

329
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,951
Don't you have any final
earth-shattering words for me?

330
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,113
Ha ha!

331
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,984
There are no words for you.

332
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,853
Mmm. Mm.

333
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,361
Mm. Mm. Mm!

334
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,138
Owen?

335
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,336
Owen.

336
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:20,940
Eileen's boyfriend, right?

337
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,609
Oh, my God. Hi.
l didn't recognize you.

338
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,447
Yeah, well,
last time you saw me...

339
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,850
l probably had my eyes open...

340
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,478
and my tongue
wasn't down someone's throat.

341
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,684
l knew there was something
different. lt's Val, right?

342
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,852
Yeah. And this is Max--
my boyfriend Max.

343
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,224
-This is Owen.
-Hi.

344
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,162
Owen and l met at this
oil spill cleanup years ago.

345
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,223
Ah, so you must be
in Friends of the Earth, too.

346
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,632
No, l was just there
to pick up girls.

347
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,163
Heh. So, how are you?
Are you still with Eileen, or...

348
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,869
Well, Eileen and l, you know...

349
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:55,141
l mean, we decided
we'd be happier, um...

350
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,977
lt's complicated.

351
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,643
l got dumped.

352
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,653
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

353
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,781
Hey, darling, listen,
my plane's going. l got to go.

354
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,519
-But you have ten minutes.
-Yeah.

355
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,119
-l'll call you.
-OK.

356
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,563
Mmm.

357
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,757
-Bye.
-Bye.

358
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,770
So, how long
have you guys been together?

359
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,937
Oh, um, four years.

360
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:31,109
He, um, he just got this
really great job in Miami...

361
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,017
so he's gonna try living there
for a while.

362
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,953
Which is fine, really.
l mean, we--

363
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,683
lt's complicated, but...

364
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,691
l got dumped, too.

365
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,217
Really? That's great.

366
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,388
lt's great?

367
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,594
Well, great, like--yeah, great.
l mean, you know--l mean, l--

368
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:52,035
Max and l don't go back
very far, but ''l'll call you''?

369
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,971
l mean, a woman like you--

370
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:58,773
you could get anyone you want,
and...

371
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,802
You know,
it's none of my business.

372
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,877
Do you want to get a drink?

373
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,385
Yeah, l could use another.

374
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,320
OK, OK. Now, just go out there
and be honest...

375
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,515
because if you're honest...

376
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,081
and you say exactly
what's on your mind...

377
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,854
then she'll never
speak to you again...

378
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,418
and you can get
the hell out of here.

379
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,055
OK. Team.

380
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,966
You were the best nine seconds
of my entire fantasy life...

381
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,368
which is a lot more competitive
than my normal life.

382
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,397
Heh. God, that's funny.

383
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,434
No, that's very, very sick.

384
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,312
No, l mean, that's funny,
because, um...

385
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,811
l fantasized about you, too.

386
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,616
-Heh.
-Ha!

387
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,178
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

388
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,748
Gosh, what were those like?

389
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:51,957
Um, they were just, like,
your basic sordid...

390
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,988
wake-up-in-the-middle
of-the-night-sweating...

391
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,829
kind of fantasies.

392
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,699
Hmm. Heh heh.

393
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,231
Oh, shit.

394
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,934
Are you OK?

395
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,967
You know, not even close.

396
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,606
Yeah, you know, you seem
a little--l don't know--

397
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,707
manic-depressive or something.

398
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,718
Well, lucky for me,
the airlines don't charge...

399
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,481
for excess personal baggage.

400
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,716
This is the final announcement
for flight 505...

401
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,281
nonstop service to New York.

402
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,821
Damn. Um...that's my flight.

403
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,093
Oh.

404
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:34,497
OK, well,
call me when you get back.

405
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,837
Sure.

406
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,071
Just walk away and praise God
that you don't have her number.

407
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,840
Wait, Owen!

408
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:45,509
l almost forgot
to give you my number. Heh.

409
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,179
-Thanks.
-Have a great trip.

410
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,551
Thank you.

411
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,484
Hey, is this flight 505?

412
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,358
Yeah. We just closed the gate.

413
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,160
No, no.
l've got to get out of here.

414
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,167
l have burned all my bridges
in this town.

415
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,965
And even if l wanted to,
l could never go back.

416
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,062
And now, because
your plane was late...

417
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,437
well, l met a woman that
l could fall in love with...

418
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,702
and l'm telling you...

419
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,801
if l don't get
on this plane right now...

420
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,142
l might just call her.
And then what?

421
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,614
l mean,
l could be here for years.

422
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,412
What if the relationship
works out?

423
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,884
Get real. lt won't.

424
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,580
How do you know that?

425
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,452
l mean, what if,
by leaving now...

426
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,286
l'm dooming myself
to a lifetime...

427
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,883
of shallow, failed
relationships...

428
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,791
because l'll always be
thinking about her?

429
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,591
Are you getting on the plane?

430
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,566
No, thanks.

431
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,373
Well, better luck next time.

432
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,778
Jesus!
You scared the shit out of me.

433
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,303
Sorry. l don't know
what l was thinking...

434
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,976
getting into my own bed
like that.

435
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,509
OK, you can go now.

436
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,283
l'm really sorry. lt's just
l thought you were gone...

437
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,314
and you have
a king-size bed, so...

438
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,259
Stephanie, can you please
hand me my underwear?

439
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,286
Get your own.
l don't have anything on.

440
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,059
Well, neither do l.

441
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:46,369
Look, clear out, asshole.
She's mine.

442
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,341
OK, Owen,
what the hell happened?

443
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,774
Well...

444
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,578
l met someone.

445
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,205
You came back for a woman?

446
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,342
l know, l know.
Things were going so well.

447
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,976
Well, who is she?

448
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,247
She's a friend of Eileen's.

449
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,982
You came back
for a friend of Eileen's?

450
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,547
Eileen
has horrible, ugly friends.

451
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,115
OK, she was an acquaintance.

452
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,594
We met a few years ago,
only then, she had a boyfriend.

453
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,221
Then tonight, at the airport,
l run into her...

454
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,164
and, of course,
we're both single.

455
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,928
Oh, so she ruined your exit.

456
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,628
Well, l mean,
l can't walk away now...

457
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,330
knowing
she's there and available.

458
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,534
Otherwise, l'll just be back
in three weeks.

459
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,599
Uhh. Do you wear a 32 Hanes?

460
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,272
Oh. Yeah.

461
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,974
So, wait, what are you gonna do?
You're just gonna go on a date?

462
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,779
Well, l have to make sure
that she's wrong for me.

463
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,944
You know, psychologists
say it takes...

464
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,317
at least three months
before the real you shows up.

465
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,483
No, no. l'm putting this
on the fast track.

466
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,355
The real me is gonna show up
the first date...

467
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,293
and l'm giving her the bad news
right up front.

468
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,353
l don't want to be her friend.

469
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,194
l don't want children,
'cause there's already...

470
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,859
too many parents in the world
as it is.

471
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,164
And l have no opinions
about shoes.

472
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,194
Do you really expect her
to go for that?

473
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,138
Well, there's always
that chance.

474
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:59,269
l mean, who knows where or when
love will strike?

475
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,745
l mean, l've just got
to give it an honest shot.

476
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,077
So, l guess you'll be
wanting your room back.

477
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,777
No, l'm booked on the red-eye
tomorrow night.

478
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,857
Yes, Bucky,
l am still in Los Angeles.

479
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,119
l'm just calling to tell you...

480
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,218
you are a great writer,
Shakespeare.

481
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,058
You could be
another Michael Crichton.

482
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,462
Well, we do both write
about dinosaurs.

483
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,797
Come on,
why do you hurt me like that?

484
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,302
l have nothing
but the utmost respect for you.

485
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,770
What do you say to $5,000?

486
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,103
Bucky, listen,
this is not about money.

487
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,631
lt's about self-respect.

488
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,609
l hear you. How about 7,000?

489
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,807
l said no! l quit! Period!

490
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,747
OK, fine.

491
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,274
You're being honest with me.
l appreciate that...

492
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,912
because now
l can be honest with you...

493
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,546
you stinkin' little hack!

494
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:49,492
l am a--a historical figure,
God damn it!

495
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,359
And l'll show
all you little writer faggots!

496
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,229
Anyone can write a book,
ass-wipe!

497
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,570
Come on. There's no way...

498
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,401
you're gonna bag her
on the first date.

499
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,567
Besides, you've never
gotten laid on a first date...

500
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,768
in your entire life.

501
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,576
See, l am sick of waiting till
the third date to be denied sex.

502
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,877
l'm just gonna say to her,
''Look, we're both adults.

503
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:14,283
''We both know why we're here,
so let's have sex, tonight.''

504
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,684
And if that goes well...

505
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,245
we'll build toward
a nice get-to-know-you lunch.

506
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,021
Maybe you should call
the airport shuttle now.

507
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,687
l hope you don't mind
my calling so soon.

508
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,595
Usually l'd act like l was busy
and wait five days...

509
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,656
but l'm kind of experimenting
with honesty.

510
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,498
Damn, l thought it was
just 'cause l was hot.

511
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,595
-Not...entirely.
-Ha ha!

512
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,573
l mean, for me, brains
and intellectual curiosity...

513
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,442
count for at least
three percent.

514
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,504
So, which car is yours?

515
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,983
Uh...the one
with the light on top.

516
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,985
The taxi?

517
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,884
Yeah, l kind of sold my car.

518
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,618
Oh. OK.

519
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,216
So, you grew up in Glendale.

520
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,921
Yes, l did.

521
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,452
Do your parents
still live there?

522
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,930
Oh, yes.

523
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:04,265
They're very sweet.
They're just not very exciting.

524
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,202
And what are their names?

525
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,537
Roberta and George. Ha!

526
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,667
l'd love to meet them sometime.

527
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,237
Well, maybe sometime you can.

528
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,475
What are they doing tonight?

529
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,918
l don't know. Why?

530
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,886
Do you think they'd mind
if we stopped by?

531
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,152
l mean, you said they didn't
have much going on. l--

532
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,991
Ha! Why would you want
to meet my parents?

533
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,690
Well, look, you know,
we can have the same old...

534
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,824
how's-the-salmon
first date type of night...

535
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,857
or we could see if
there is any future for us...

536
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,426
and meet your family.

537
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,405
OK, this is insane.

538
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,101
ls it really? Why wait till
date twelve or sixteen...

539
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,507
to find out
if your parents hate me?

540
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,341
lf there's a problem,
wouldn't you rather know now?

541
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:52,043
Heh. Well, they never liked Max.

542
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,551
You see? And where's Max now?

543
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,077
l mean, think of all the time
we could save.

544
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,987
Tick, tick, tick.

545
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,252
Driver, we're going to Glendale.

546
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,384
Wait, l--

547
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,529
Well, we were
in the neighborhood...

548
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,259
so we thought we'd stop by.

549
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,392
This is very weird, dear.

550
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,561
Would you like
some more grape juice, Owen?

551
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,730
Thank you.

552
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,967
This is really great egg salad.

553
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,941
Oh. lt's the gherkins.

554
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,137
Now, you know Val from where?

555
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,146
Well, from the airport, George.

556
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,340
l was standing there
last night...

557
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,609
feeling a little depressed...

558
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,116
doggin'
a gin and peach iced tea...

559
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,051
when our eyes met,
and it was like--

560
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,054
you know how dogs can smell
and hear things...

561
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,420
that other people can't?
We were like two dogs...

562
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,719
and there was this scent
between us...

563
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,658
that no one else
could pick up on.

564
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,252
Owen's a writer.

565
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,058
What kind of writing?

566
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,065
Well, l started writing
short stories.

567
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,657
Then l moved to Los Angeles...

568
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,430
where l continued
to build self-esteem...

569
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,700
by lowering expectations
and co-writing autobiographies.

570
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,900
Oh. Any we would know?

571
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,102
Um, well, there's
''Dead Parents Society.''

572
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,371
Do you remember the twins...

573
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,935
who hired the Crips
to kill their parents?

574
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,040
And then some stranglers,
but mostly minor ones.

575
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,415
You know, son,
you have a very bad attitude.

576
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,749
Oh, come on, Dad.

577
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,481
Don't get fresh, young lady.

578
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,354
Now, when l was a young man...

579
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,519
my dream was to build
the first U.S. space station.

580
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,586
l got a job at Lockheed...

581
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,861
where l worked sixty-hour weeks
for thirteen years...

582
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,958
to try and reach that dream.

583
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,594
And then one day, it hit me.

584
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,834
l was painting a new wing flap
on an L-1011...

585
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,272
when suddenly l realized...

586
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,538
my dream
was never gonna come true...

587
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,978
because dreams don't mean shit.

588
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,608
That's why
they're called ''dreams.''

589
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,481
They don't ever happen.

590
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,679
They're just figments
of the imagination...

591
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,348
that make people feel bad
about what they do.

592
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,487
So, don't put yourself down
for not fulfilling some dream.

593
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,722
Yeah, but don't you think...

594
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,230
you should be
a little more demanding...

595
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,357
of the men
your daughter brings home?

596
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,867
Well, we trust Val.

597
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,233
lf Val likes someone,
we like him, too...

598
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,397
even if they're not
very successful.

599
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,565
Mom.

600
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,302
Roberta and l
keep telling Val...

601
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,537
that someone with
a lot of money and ambition...

602
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:02,444
is not gonna put in the time
to make as nice a home...

603
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,880
as a fella
with average talents...

604
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,384
someone who's mature enough
to realize...

605
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,855
he's not gonna change the world
one jack shit.

606
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,151
Cheers.

607
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,350
Heh.

608
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,193
Oh, thank you, Owen.

609
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,493
Yeah.

610
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,863
Yeah.

611
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,532
l don't know what to do
with Allison.

612
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:29,767
We were supposed
to go to a movie...

613
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,275
and now she says
she doesn't want to go.

614
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,504
The whole evening's
turning into a fucking disaster.

615
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,012
You gotta help me out, OK?

616
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,946
All right, all right.

617
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,949
Take her to the new gallery
on Melrose...

618
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,383
and then stop off
for a miso soup at Banzai.

619
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,852
Thank you. So, how's it going...

620
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,787
with your hot little
piece of ass?

621
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,815
Oh, not so good.
Her parents seem to like me...

622
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,520
and she does, too. lt just--

623
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,392
You're never leaving.
l knew you'd fag out.

624
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,329
No, there's still some hope.

625
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,059
l'm gonna show her
a side of me...

626
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,931
that no self-respecting woman
from Glendale...

627
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,993
will be able to tolerate.

628
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,412
ls this not great?

629
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:12,280
Yeah. And $2.17. Who knew?

630
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,844
l love buses. l mean, you know,
in a city full of commuters...

631
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,821
where everybody's
cut off from each other...

632
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,517
l mean,
this is the only place...

633
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,388
we can experience life
with other people.

634
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,656
l mean, look at this.

635
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,563
Nothing brings people together
like a bus.

636
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,567
l never liked buses.

637
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,164
Well, they're not for everybody.

638
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:49,145
You know, it's true, though.

639
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,348
l mean, when you drive around
in a car all day...

640
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:55,348
you never get a chance
to look at anything.

641
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,861
But at least in a bus,
you can...

642
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,764
really notice
how beautiful the city can be.

643
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,427
Excuse me?

644
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,299
l mean, especially
on a night like tonight.

645
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,826
You know, it's so clear.

646
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,465
The wind's just blowing away
all that haze and crap...

647
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,168
and you can really see.

648
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:17,011
lt's like the unveiling
of a painting or sculpture.

649
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,778
For some reason,
a stripper comes to mind.

650
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,753
Oh, come on.
The skyline is to die for.

651
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,982
And someday,
it'll probably topple over...

652
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,048
and kill a lot of people,
most likely.

653
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,353
Heh!

654
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,527
Gonna get that? lt's OK.

655
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,898
Owen! lt's Jack.

656
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,631
The Fairfax meeting
starts in twenty minutes.

657
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,730
We're all still praying for you.

658
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,469
You're still an alcoholic,
and your life is--

659
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,239
OK, take a look at this.
This is what l'm talking about.

660
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,178
You see that building
over there?

661
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,738
What, the Falafel Queen?

662
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,047
No, not the Falafel Queen.
Above it. Look up.

663
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,145
ls that new? l don't think
l've ever seen that before.

664
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,382
lsn't it beautiful?

665
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,192
lt is kind of beautiful.

666
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,266
l had a really nice time.

667
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,995
Yeah. Me, too.

668
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,262
Sorry. Heh.

669
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:50,263
Look, l, um, l just wanted
to say that we're both adults...

670
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,003
and we both know
why we're here--

671
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,806
Zeke! Come on, Zeke! Shh!

672
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,870
Shh, shh, shh! l'm sorry.

673
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,404
No, it's OK.

674
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:01,179
And we've been through this
with a lot of other people, so--

675
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,880
Zeke! Come on!

676
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,821
Uh, he's--he's an only dog.

677
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,050
-Yeah.
-Sorry.

678
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,081
And, l mean, l think
we both know why we're here--

679
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,991
Just hang on one sec.

680
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,792
Zeke, shush.

681
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,799
Ha ha ha ha! This is a great--

682
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,960
Aww. Oh, l'm sorry.

683
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,300
No, it's fine.
You know, it's a great dog.

684
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,329
Sorry! He's sorry. So sorry.

685
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:25,137
-Heh. lt's OK.
-Ha!

686
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,700
Heh.

687
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:30,236
Now, as l was saying, um...

688
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,340
Thanks. Call me.

689
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,046
l'd invite you in, but l'm still
feeling a bit vulnerable.

690
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,213
No, it's--

691
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,552
Plus, you smell like
lamb kibble.

692
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,147
-Heh.
-Ha ha!

693
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,783
lt's OK. Um...

694
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,316
Good night. Thanks again.

695
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,692
-Thank you. Good night.
- Come on, baby.

696
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,697
Good night. Good night.

697
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:47,959
OK.

698
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,492
OK? lt's not--

699
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:57,031
Ah, how could you say ''lt's OK''?
lt's not OK. lt sucks!

700
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,406
So, did you do her
like you said you would?

701
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,642
No, it was a total failure.

702
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,377
Then why are you
selling your bed?

703
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,011
Because l'm trying
to stay positive.

704
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,179
We've done the parents thing.

705
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,155
Now it's time
to meet the friends.

706
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,658
Owen,
you don't have any friends.

707
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,855
Besides which, she's not dating
your friends. She's dating you.

708
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,090
Come on,
you don't date the person.

709
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,564
You date the package.

710
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,533
Friends,
their family, their job.

711
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,195
l mean, the whole thing
has got to work out.

712
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,567
One of my biggest problems
with Eileen...

713
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,265
is that she hated
all my friends.

714
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,070
She thought you and Rob
were clannish and rude.

715
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,370
What are you doing tonight?

716
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:36,505
No. l am not gonna be
a bitch to this girl...

717
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,741
just to make you happy.

718
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,773
Hey, did l say be a bitch?

719
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,251
Just be you.

720
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,718
Fuck a lot of girls on this?

721
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,885
l'm not selling you my mattress.

722
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,827
Why not? 'Cause l'm gay?

723
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,660
No, because you're
sleeping with the woman...

724
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,256
l've always wanted
to have sex with.

725
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,425
Hey, you know what?

726
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,664
l, uh, took her to that gallery
you told me about. She loved it.

727
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,535
So now l'm thinking
l want to buy her something.

728
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,664
l don't know what to get her.

729
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,471
l was thinking maybe a piece
of hot lingerie or something.

730
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,977
They got those nursing bras
in silk.

731
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,912
-You just pop the top and go.
-Please, just stop.

732
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,438
No, seriously. Look,
you gotta help me out here.

733
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,075
Allison and l, uh...

734
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,484
we're having
some sexual issues, OK?

735
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,011
What does she like in bed?

736
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,216
l don't know. Breakfast.

737
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,317
Oh, what? Like guys don't talk
about this shit all the time?

738
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,827
She can't keep her hands
off my titties...

739
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,089
but l can't make her come.

740
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,427
There's more to it
than just sex, though.

741
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,865
l mean, women are emotional.

742
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,630
-They--
-Right?

743
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,762
At least, most of them are.

744
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,239
Yes, go buy her something.
That sounds fantastic.

745
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,798
What? Buy her what?

746
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,970
l don't know. A hat. A cap.
Something not white.

747
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,037
A hat. Thank you.

748
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,174
Thank you. OK, uh...

749
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,150
so, what?
A hundred bucks for the bed?

750
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,880
Do you not already have a bed?

751
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,753
l've been living at my parents'.
Now l'm moving out. Here.

752
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,188
Fine.

753
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,552
So, where are you moving to?

754
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,494
Aw, fuck!

755
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,828
Heh heh.

756
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,435
l can't believe
you gave Stephanie my room.

757
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,062
Actually, Rob did.

758
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,164
Well, you guys
could've at least told me.

759
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,504
What difference does it make?

760
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,668
You knew someone
was gonna move in.

761
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,544
-Can l ask you something?
-Mm-hmm.

762
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,815
ls this thing with Stephanie
for real?

763
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,518
You know me.
l enjoy being worshipped.

764
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,185
But she's moving in.

765
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,660
Across the hall.
We're just getting...

766
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,424
the sex part out of the way
so we can be housemates.

767
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,830
Yeah, but you never got the sex
out of the way with me.

768
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,597
You wouldn't even let me see
your boobies on a French beach.

769
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,160
Have you even
stopped to think...

770
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,399
about what's gonna happen to me
when you're gone?

771
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,068
You are leaving
an enormous hole in my life...

772
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,134
and at the moment,
l'm filling it with Stephanie.

773
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,509
-Ha ha ha.
-Anyway...

774
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,673
it turns out we have more
in common than l thought.

775
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,650
She likes galleries,
cheap Japanese restaurants...

776
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,675
just like you and me.

777
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,620
Well, l'm glad it's working out.

778
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,130
-Hey, Owen.
-Hey, Owen, how you doin'?

779
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,563
-Who the hell is that?
-Some friends from AA.

780
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,627
Hi! How are you guys doin'?
Great!

781
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,781
Aren't we moving
a little fast here?

782
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,579
No, it only seems that way
because we're on Fairfax...

783
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,347
and everybody else
is using a walker.

784
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,787
Heh. No, but, l mean...

785
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,256
isn't it a little early
for me to meet your friends?

786
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,317
l mean, l usually don't
introduce a guy to my friends...

787
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,227
till l'm pretty sure
how things are gonna go.

788
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:42,130
Oh, l'm pretty sure
how things are gonna go.

789
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,429
So, then Adam and Sue say, ''Are
you going to Rick's wedding?''

790
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,596
And l say, ''What wedding?''

791
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,866
And they look at me
like l'm a turkey...

792
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,430
who doesn't know
it's Thanksgiving.

793
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,271
When are you gonna get over
this whole Rick thing?

794
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,335
l mean, you can't blame
Adam, too...

795
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,243
because Rick didn't tell you
he was getting married.

796
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,044
-Who are Adam and Sue again?
-Do you know Neil Lobenthal?

797
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,641
Um...no.

798
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,448
Neil was a friend
of mine and Rob's.

799
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,783
He lived with Adam and Sue
in college...

800
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,221
and introduced Allison to Rick,
her old boyfriend.

801
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,884
l just can't believe
l'm not invited.

802
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,825
All my Stanford friends
are gonna be there. lt sucks.

803
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,158
-Are we back on Rick again?
-Apparently so.

804
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,596
Wait a second. You went to
Stanford? When did you graduate?

805
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,395
'97. l mean, here's the thing.

806
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,426
Even though l wouldn't go,
l'd like to be invited.

807
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,596
l was '96.

808
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,072
l mean, you broke up with Rick
seven years ago.

809
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,267
Exactly. Move on.

810
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,105
l have moved on,
but l just come back for visits.

811
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,111
This isn't Rick Labutier
by any chance, is it?

812
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,204
No, it's just some freak
that Allison went out with.

813
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,978
-You know Rick?
-Yeah. Heh.

814
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,644
Yeah, we dated junior year.

815
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:38,678
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Ha ha ha!

816
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,214
You're not the girl
that he, um, proposed to...

817
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,989
at his parents' Christmas party,
and you said no?

818
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,359
Yeah, because he was screwing...

819
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,058
some stupid little groupie
from his band.

820
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,897
-That would be me.
-Oh.

821
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,735
Yeah. l'm not a big fan
of yours, either.

822
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,570
You know, l, um, l always
wanted to meet you...

823
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,271
so l could look you
in the eye and...

824
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:05,908
thank you for saving me
from such a huge jerk.

825
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,815
Oh, my God. Wasn't he?

826
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,480
Wasn't he?
l mean, him and his stupid van!

827
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,648
-Oh, l hated that van!
-And his mother?

828
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,659
OK, can you imagine spending
every Christmas with that mother?

829
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:16,955
OK, do you remember
that thing on his--

830
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,188
Oh, you mean the--

831
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,789
The--the what?
What on his thing?

832
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,991
Wait a second, wait a second.

833
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,364
Did you know
that friend of his--Dan?

834
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,801
Do you remember Dan? He was
always trying to jump my bones.

835
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,360
Oh, God! Me, too!

836
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,963
As a matter of fact,
he did jump my bones.

837
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,769
Oh, my God. You slept with Dan?

838
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,400
Oh, my God! Ha ha!

839
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,671
Wait, Dan who?
Dan Monahan, or--

840
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,111
l always wanted
to sleep with Dan...

841
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,876
but l was just kind of
too chicken to do it.

842
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,109
Who the hell's Dan?

843
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,913
OK, you can stop wondering.
l'm gonna tell you.

844
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,350
Oh, my God. Will you really?

845
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,219
Excuse me. OK, start
from the beginning now.

846
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:50,122
Unbelievable.
Allison actually likes her.

847
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,186
She does have a hell of a rack.

848
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,289
When you go,
could l get her number?

849
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,732
Would that be possible?

850
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,529
l really liked your friends.

851
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,198
Yeah, they liked you a lot, too.

852
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,470
Of course, they were mentally
raping you the entire meal.

853
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,771
Heh.

854
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,780
Whoa. Heh. l really wasn't
expecting anything like this.

855
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,419
-Were you?
-Definitely not.

856
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,258
Ha!
l keep waiting for the catch.

857
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,422
The catch?

858
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,830
Yeah, you know, like,
you're really a robot...

859
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,993
or you have three balls
or something.

860
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,627
Well, negative to both...

861
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,297
but please
don't take my word for it.

862
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:37,432
Ha ha! Seriously. l, um...

863
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,238
l really feel like
this could go somewhere.

864
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,834
lnside would be nice.

865
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,745
Heh.
Look, l mean, the thing is...

866
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,648
l just--l just came off
a really bad breakup, you know?

867
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,278
And l wasn't really looking
for another relationship.

868
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,787
Perfect.

869
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,413
Until the last couple of days.

870
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:56,415
l guess l just think we should
take things slow, you know?

871
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,258
Otherwise, it's just gonna be
one of those rebound flings...

872
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,594
that just go down in flames,
do you know what l mean?

873
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:02,758
Yes, l totally agree.

874
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,894
Right. Mm...mm...
what l'm saying is--

875
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,403
Hey, hey, hey!

876
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,532
l say l want to take things
slow, and you grab my ass?

877
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,041
l was disagreeing with you.

878
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,341
Well, thank you.
l appreciate your enthusiasm...

879
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:19,110
but l'm not ready.
l want to wait.

880
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,280
Why? Why is waiting a good idea
when it comes to men and women?

881
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,289
Because when it comes to
everything else, waiting stinks.

882
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,847
l mean, my whole life,
l've been waiting...

883
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,359
for things that never came--

884
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,657
Santa Claus,
the Police reunion tour...

885
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,823
the right time to quit my job...

886
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,631
phone calls from friends
when my dad died.

887
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:43,003
Waiting is death, and l'm
just not gonna do it anymore.

888
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:50,311
Well, then maybe
you should move on...

889
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,545
'cause l don't think
this is gonna work.

890
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:25,174
Ahh! Shit!

891
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,342
Ah! Come on!

892
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:43,465
Hey. Dude, come here.

893
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,298
Sorry, l'm not in the mood
for a cuddle.

894
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,397
Look, she loved the hat.
Came like a freight train.

895
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,399
What now?
She wants to go away somewhere.

896
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,241
Do you know any nice walks?

897
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,540
Rock Springs Ranch.
Out past Yucca Valley.

898
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,551
lt's in the desert,
but it's got a nice breeze...

899
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,985
like you're in Cascais.

900
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,930
Hi.

901
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,868
You want a waffle?

902
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,201
Uhh.

903
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:25,368
Shouldn't you be, uh,
having sex right now?

904
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,344
Actually, l think
l'd be on to the cigarette...

905
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,575
or the embarrassing silence
by this point.

906
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,708
Hmm. What happened?

907
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,480
You know...

908
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,478
she's not ready, take time,
wants to make it special.

909
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,753
Too bad.
She seemed like she was OK.

910
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,257
Yeah. For a minute there,
l thought l met someone...

911
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,423
who could make it
all good again.

912
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,694
Wow. One of those.

913
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,934
When was the last time
you met someone like that?

914
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,965
Been a while. You?

915
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,706
Ah. l don't think
they really exist.

916
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,911
Good night.

917
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,215
Good night.

918
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,714
Yeah, well, maybe it's just as
well you're getting out of town.

919
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,590
l mean,
wait till you see the e-mail...

920
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,618
that Grant and Nancy sent me.

921
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,653
What e-mail?

922
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,158
Check out that ass.

923
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,259
Well, does it look fat
or anything?

924
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:28,169
Well, l mean, you could've
shaved for the occasion.

925
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,537
Well, fuck, how many people
did they send this to?

926
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,873
A few friends. lt--
OK, everybody we know.

927
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:37,904
Aw, cheer up. Want some ''X''
For the plane ride?

928
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,384
l don't need it anymore,
now that l'm in a relationship.

929
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,216
Waah-ha-hoo! You are doing it.

930
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,655
-Yes!
-You are really leaving.

931
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,125
Yeah, four days, nine
ex-friends, and one job later...

932
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,286
l'm getting out.

933
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:52,920
Yes, you are. Yes!

934
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,123
Damn it!

935
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,361
Hey, come out and meet me
at the Venice meeting.

936
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,870
You can probably get here in
time for the serenity prayer.

937
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,030
God, Goddess, Grace...

938
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,199
Prayer Father, Holy Mother,
Source Energy.

939
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,003
-All right, where were we?
-You were doing it.

940
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,604
Right. Right!

941
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,682
Thy will, not mine, be done.

942
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,950
No, my will, not thine.
l'm getting out.

943
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,457
You're doing it, man!
You're doing it!

944
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,188
Fuck you, city!
You can suck on it!

945
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,991
-Yeah!
-Suck on it!

946
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,998
Yeah!

947
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,500
l'm not coming back.

948
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:33,332
You can go fuck yourself,
you big dickwad.

949
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,167
-Owen?
-Val?

950
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,339
-Hi.
-Hi.

951
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,173
l'm sorry. Are you
in the middle of something?

952
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,702
Um, well, actually, at the end.

953
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,012
Well, l was just calling...

954
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,815
because l was thinking about
what you said last night...

955
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,582
and, um...

956
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:55,422
how we're not supposed
to go through life waiting.

957
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,393
You know what?
Don't give that another thought.

958
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,555
Obviously, l was drunk,
and l was horny...

959
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,064
and l was groveling
at the chance...

960
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,329
to do filthy,
shameful things to you.

961
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,666
Fortunately,
you--you saw through...

962
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,070
my sad little diatribe,
and you sent me packing.

963
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:12,303
No, actually, l was calling
to say you were right.

964
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:13,502
No.

965
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:15,769
No?

966
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,907
-No way, no way. That's great.
-What?

967
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,144
Just one question--
why would you think that?

968
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,949
Well, l've just been doing
a lot of thinking about it...

969
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:27,286
about Max and how
that never went anywhere.

970
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:31,522
And l just--l really like you.

971
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,120
Oh.

972
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,262
Are you free tonight?

973
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,097
Sure.

974
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,634
OK, l'll pick you up at 7:00.

975
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,333
OK, bye.

976
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,807
Don't tell me. U-turn?

977
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:53,449
Well, if living here doesn't get
you depressed, nothing will.

978
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,816
l'm sorry, but that goddamned
fucking phone call...

979
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,515
just made me feel so happy.

980
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,489
l hate this!

981
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,838
You done?

982
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,139
Face it--you're gonna be here
for a while.

983
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,145
No. No, no, no.

984
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,171
Look, you put this relationship
on the fast track.

985
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,683
You met the parents, introduced
her to your friends...

986
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,312
insisted that she have sex
with you almost immediately...

987
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,822
and for some reason
she still likes you.

988
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,187
What else do you need to know?

989
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,158
That l can trust her.

990
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,421
Oh, right.

991
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,861
Well, then l suggest you get
your ass back to the house...

992
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:43,162
eat some shit with your friends,
and get your job back...

993
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,430
because that, my darling,
is going to take time.

994
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,927
l--l just need one more day. l--

995
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,304
What are you going to do,
hook her up to a lie detector?

996
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,637
Rory Riseman's having a party.
l'm going to take her.

997
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:58,444
Rory Riseman
is a drunken venal creep.

998
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,143
l thought you slept with him.

999
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,412
Well, he gets me hot.

1000
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:02,816
See? Exactly. l mean...

1001
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,651
he's hit on every girl
l've ever dated here.

1002
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:07,486
So what? He tries
to sleep with everybody.

1003
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:11,016
l don't hate him for trying.
l hate him for succeeding.

1004
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,459
Dude,
what the hell are you doing?

1005
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,464
l can see you.

1006
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,443
Val's coming over...

1007
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,471
and she doesn't know
l don't live here anymore.

1008
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,649
Look, man, phone call.

1009
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,882
Get the rest of your shit
out of here.

1010
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,621
-Hello?
-Shakespeare?

1011
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,184
Bucky,
what the fuck do you want?

1012
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:48,289
l drink
seven cups of coffee a day.

1013
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:52,826
l sit at my desk
and put commas in.

1014
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,236
l take commas out.

1015
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,536
Writing is very, very hard.

1016
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,777
You want the truth, Shakespeare?
l'll tell you the truth.

1017
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,542
l need money.

1018
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,879
lt seems that l took a shine...

1019
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,977
to a lovely young lady
sometime back--

1020
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,545
a professional, if you will.

1021
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,319
She was costing me
eight grand a month.

1022
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,386
l went through everything,
and then she left me.

1023
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,159
You're kidding me. A hooker
only loved you for your money?

1024
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,464
Shakespeare,
you're--you're delightful.

1025
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:30,872
My wife doesn't have a clue.
l--l remortgaged my house.

1026
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,366
Now l owe people--big people.

1027
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,242
They want the book.

1028
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,907
Hey!

1029
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,246
They will fuck you up.

1030
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:46,154
Well, they better hurry, because
l don't even live here anymore.

1031
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,568
#' Extra, extra, read all about it #'

1032
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,552
-Wow, this is nice.
-Yeah.

1033
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,253
Dave? Dave, it's me, Lucy.

1034
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,524
Dave, it's so good to see you.

1035
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,929
Hey, Fuck face,
what are you doing here?

1036
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,957
You know, l always wanted
to call you that...

1037
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:32,901
Fuck face.
Fuck face, Fuck face!

1038
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,369
OK, tell me you didn't
sleep with her.

1039
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,804
Even l couldn't get that drunk.

1040
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,774
Oh, shit.

1041
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,299
Oh, my God.

1042
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,505
Dude! Nice butt.

1043
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:43,672
Rory.

1044
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,738
Come on, man. You're famous now.

1045
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:47,147
-Oh!
-At least your ass is, huh?

1046
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,243
Wait a minute.
That--that's you up there?

1047
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,948
l really don't see
a resemblance. Do you?

1048
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,354
Oh ho ho!

1049
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,483
We were at this terrible
wedding years ago.

1050
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,255
He gets drunk. Does the caterer
in the video arbor...

1051
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,455
only the tape's running.

1052
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,691
The next morning,
bride and groom are watching...

1053
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,064
their little treasured
wedding memories on video...

1054
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,160
when suddenly his hairy ass
comes on-screen...

1055
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,535
just a-humpin' away.

1056
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,063
Ha ha. Oh, my God.
That is you. Wow.

1057
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:15,272
Well, l've toned a lot
since then. l--in my opinion.

1058
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,040
l'm Rory, by the way.

1059
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,070
-Oh.
-Oh.

1060
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:21,209
-Hi, l'm Val.
-Sorry.

1061
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,151
God, you look familiar
or something.

1062
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,518
Oh, yeah.
Maybe this will jog your memory.

1063
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:28,456
Coming up, we got Gin Blossoms,
Box, Blind Melon, Silverchair.

1064
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,586
Plus, the new video from Belly
and an exclusive extra--

1065
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,188
Kennedy interviews
the guys in Candlebox.

1066
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,392
Oh, my God. You're Rory,
who used to be on MTV.

1067
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,957
-Yeah, yeah.
-Wow.

1068
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:41,061
Oh, man, l love doing that
to people, man.

1069
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:42,628
Ask him about
the shampoo commercial.

1070
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,197
His hair is apparently amazing.

1071
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,834
Well, actually,
l just finished a novel.

1072
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,208
Oh.

1073
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,542
About the rise and fall of a VJ.

1074
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,377
Well, Kelly Ripa
has a book club.

1075
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,010
Actually,
l just sold it to Random House.

1076
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,248
What?

1077
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,414
Dude,
that's what the party's for.

1078
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,289
Are you smoking crack right now?
Come on, man.

1079
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,226
Congratulations.
That's fantastic.

1080
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,524
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1081
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,726
You know, actually, l got
some advance copies downstairs.

1082
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:13,031
Fuck it. l'll sign one for you
if you want.

1083
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,470
Sure. Thanks. Great.

1084
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,439
-Right on.
-Come on.

1085
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:20,705
Fuck it. l--sorry. Really,
l'm OK. Let's just go home.

1086
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,269
Would you stop being like
an idiot? He's your friend, OK?

1087
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:24,302
Let's just go home. lt's fine.

1088
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:27,839
-Ohh. Just two minutes, OK?
-l'm fine. Thank you.

1089
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,849
Here you go.

1090
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,220
Oh, my God.
That was another earthquake.

1091
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,231
Did you feel that?
Did you feel that earthquake?

1092
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,357
We just had an earthquake.

1093
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,130
l haven't felt anything
since Tuesday.

1094
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,932
lt's not a tremor.
That is an earthquake.

1095
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:51,771
lt's just like the one that
they had here last week.

1096
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:10,489
Look, l'm just trying
to make some points.

1097
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,324
l'm not myself tonight.

1098
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:15,658
-Oh, God!
-Did you feel that?

1099
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,064
-Yes, l felt that.
-OK.

1100
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,796
OK, now, that was for real.
l was not making that one up.

1101
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,667
OK, that was--that was
not my imagination.

1102
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,935
-l know.
-OK, OK.

1103
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,965
All right. OK.
We're having an earthquake.

1104
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,738
l think the--look.

1105
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,210
-Oh, God.
-Did you feel that?

1106
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,680
-l felt it. l felt it.
-He felt it. He felt it, too!

1107
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:32,875
We're going to die!
This is an earthquake!

1108
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,474
-This is an earthquake?
-What?

1109
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,145
We're going to die!

1110
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,885
Let's get out of here!

1111
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,029
Ha ha ha!

1112
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,698
Come back here! Sissy dude,
l paid you two grand, man.

1113
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,705
Get your ass back in there. Cut
that shit.

1114
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,633
Come on. Hey. No, no, no.
No. Come on.

1115
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,168
-Ow! Stop pushing!
-Ow, my foot!

1116
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:04,703
Forget it! Leave it!

1117
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:11,253
There you are. l've been
looking all over for you.

1118
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,020
l knew this night
was going to end badly.

1119
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,526
What--what do you mean?

1120
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,587
How was your book signing?
Was it totally awesome?

1121
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,461
Are you mad at me?

1122
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:26,265
l was just trying to make
an effort with your friend.

1123
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,703
l know. Rory's amazing.
He's really incredible.

1124
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,206
lt only took him twenty minutes
to get your number.

1125
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,540
My--what are you talking about?
l didn't give him my number.

1126
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,706
Val, l saw you.

1127
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,874
Are you kidding me?

1128
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:44,080
Just so you know, it wasn't
my number--it was my shrink's.

1129
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,179
The guy's a mess.

1130
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,089
And you know what else?

1131
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:52,117
l didn't even want
to come here, you know?

1132
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,891
l thought
we might go out to dinner...

1133
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,420
the two of us--you know, talk?

1134
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,695
But, no, you drag me
to this lame party...

1135
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,702
where l don't know anyone.

1136
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,636
l don't see you,
and l spend my night...

1137
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:05,869
smiling and nodding
to some ex-VJ with manorexia.

1138
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,570
And you're down here
convincing yourself...

1139
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:08,942
that l'm cheating on you?

1140
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:11,504
l mean, are we even dating?

1141
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,573
Wait, where are you going?

1142
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:17,644
l'm going home. Take the bus.
You like the bus.

1143
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:52,686
#' No matter what you do #'

1144
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,528
#' l've given up on you #'

1145
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:07,400
#' No matter what you say #'

1146
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:14,206
#' l'm leaving you today #'

1147
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,258
Hey.

1148
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,157
Can we talk?

1149
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,920
You got a fax.

1150
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:07,191
Dear Mr. McCabe, l am sorry
l cannot honor your request...

1151
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,527
to work from Los Angeles.

1152
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,726
You must make a choice.

1153
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,827
Like the atom,
a man split in two parts...

1154
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,668
unleashes uncontrollable chaos
and deconstruction.

1155
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,901
The man does make a good point.

1156
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:22,105
There's only one problem.
Val passed the Rory test.

1157
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,238
She chose you over Rory?

1158
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,248
l know. l was shocked.

1159
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,443
l thought
that was what you wanted.

1160
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:32,581
No. l wanted her to be
some shallow selfless nut...

1161
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:33,884
l could walk away from
without any guilt...

1162
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,356
and of course
she turned out to be...

1163
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:39,351
some beautiful, charming,
loyal woman. Why?

1164
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:43,730
You know, l'll still respect you
if you decide to stay.

1165
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,325
Yeah,
but me and all your friends...

1166
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:46,960
we'll just think
you're a big pussy.

1167
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,402
l mean, there's just
a few more things...

1168
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,099
l need to know, and l just--

1169
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,472
What?
You've done the Rory test...

1170
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,636
the parents test,
the best friends test.

1171
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,167
What other tests are there?

1172
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,772
Sex.
l mean, not to mention...

1173
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,612
the ''can l spend a weekend
alone with this person'' test.

1174
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,049
Of course,
that's all contingent...

1175
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,575
on her passing
the forgiveness test...

1176
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,282
because right now she hates me.

1177
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,313
Well, talk about plans
for the weekend.

1178
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:09,882
l mean, l'm supposed
to go with her...

1179
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,052
to some animal rights thing
tonight...

1180
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,254
only she's not calling me back.

1181
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:13,922
So, what are you going to do?

1182
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,954
Go anyway. l mean,
if we click back on...

1183
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,626
l'll invite her
to spend a weekend with me...

1184
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:18,964
at Rock Springs Ranch.

1185
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,264
lt's this place
out in the desert...

1186
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:21,964
but it's got a breeze
like you're in Cascais.

1187
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:24,269
And by Sunday,
hopefully, l'll know.

1188
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,902
Rock Springs Ranch--isn't that
where you wanted to go?

1189
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,572
Uh, no, l don't think so.

1190
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:32,840
Yeah, no, l remember.

1191
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:37,512
You described it the exact
same way, like Cascais.

1192
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:41,914
Well, maybe l heard it
from Stephanie. l--

1193
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,560
You've been to Cascais, yeah?

1194
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,563
-Stephanie?
-What?

1195
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,428
Have you been to Cascais?

1196
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,833
-Uh-huh. Yeah.
-Oh. When?

1197
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:57,465
Uh, the--the bike trip
l took to France.

1198
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:02,604
Well, that's funny.
Cascais is in Portugal.

1199
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,943
Fine. lt was Owen's idea.

1200
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,608
Listen, l was just
trying to give her...

1201
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,742
some pointers
on what you're into. lt--

1202
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,481
Oh, really? Like you would know.

1203
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:12,647
Hey, thanks to me...

1204
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,156
your one week anniversary
present was that hat...

1205
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,714
and not an autographed
Raiders helmet.

1206
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,316
Oh, fuck you.

1207
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,729
Great. This is great.
So, um, it was all you--

1208
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:25,200
the trip, the gallery, the hat.

1209
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,726
This whole relationship
is a lie.

1210
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:32,036
No. l like you.
Owen was helping me.

1211
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,406
l'm sorry. lt...

1212
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,671
l mean, you were
one of the only reasons...

1213
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,110
l was staying in L.A...

1214
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,136
and l knew that if
you were with someone else...

1215
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,445
l wouldn't be able
to stick around and watch that.

1216
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:41,745
Well, l guess you were wrong.

1217
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:45,083
You never even left
the area code.

1218
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:49,091
-Wait, l can explain.
-l--l...

1219
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,518
Allison!

1220
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,949
Well, a gift of just $2,000...

1221
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,850
will provide an operating room
for spaying and neutering...

1222
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,013
so anything you could give
would be wonderful.

1223
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,852
Well, we did want to do
something...

1224
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,687
-to commemorate Ronnie.
-Oh.

1225
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,387
He bit a three-year-old
in the face--really did a job.

1226
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,795
-He didn't mean it.
-Judge made us put him down.

1227
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,628
Well, maybe--maybe you'd like...

1228
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,397
to buy a commemorative plaque
for Ronnie in our new building.

1229
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:34,767
l think Ronnie--

1230
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,966
Excuse me for one moment.

1231
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,533
What are you doing here?

1232
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,978
Look, l wanted to say that
l was sorry about last night.

1233
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:45,844
OK, Owen,
l can't do this right now.

1234
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,747
l have two hours
to raise twenty grand, OK?

1235
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:48,910
Can you just go, please?

1236
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:50,510
Look, l want to be here for you.

1237
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,316
Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

1238
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:55,085
Oh, Mr. Brandt, hi!
Welcome. Nice to see you.

1239
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,388
-You know this guy?
-Um...

1240
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,055
l was about to make a donation.
What about you?

1241
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,495
Oh, l'd be happy
to contribute...

1242
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,931
as soon as this little prick
finishes my friggin' book.

1243
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,663
-Excuse me?
-What about five hundred bucks?

1244
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,194
Five hundred bucks?
Screw that, mister.

1245
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:12,833
l've got bigger worries than
Chihuahuas fucking in east L.A.

1246
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:16,038
Besides, l'm not contributing
2 cents to some crap charity...

1247
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,013
that's got your name
on its guest list.

1248
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,845
Get me my goddamn pages.

1249
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,878
What was that about?

1250
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,014
Actually, no. You know what?
l don't want to know.

1251
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,120
l saw the cutest little puppy...

1252
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,061
at that adoption center
on Laurel Canyon--

1253
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,827
Bucky. Oh, Mrs. Brandt,
it's really nice to see you.

1254
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:39,460
Listen, you forgot to sign
your pledge card.

1255
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:42,062
lt's $2,000.
lt's, uh, very generous.

1256
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,767
-Excuse us.
-Ha ha.

1257
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,638
You little runt.

1258
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:50,043
Go shove this pledge
up your girlfriend's ass.

1259
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,774
lt's still a lot cheaper
than what your wife would cost.

1260
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,752
l'm sure her version
of Christmas, 197 4...

1261
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,778
is a little different
from yours.

1262
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,017
l think the journal entry
went something like...

1263
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,117
''When everyone was singing
Joy to the World...

1264
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,856
''l was banging Suzie Shapiro
on my workbench.

1265
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:08,830
''She was an oversexed
little hottie of a J.A.P...

1266
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,628
and why she was dating my son
l'll never know.''

1267
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,534
Hey, mister, you signed
a confidentiality agreement.

1268
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:14,968
l will sue your ass.

1269
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:18,303
l got news for you, Bucky--
you can't touch me.

1270
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,276
You can't lean on my friends,
because l don't have any.

1271
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,177
You can't stake out my house,
because l don't live anywhere.

1272
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:27,307
You can't fuck my career,
because l already did.

1273
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,342
You can't call my cell phone,
because l don't have one...

1274
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:34,254
and you can't bring me down,
because l've already jumped.

1275
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,053
And the only question left is...

1276
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,822
do l bring you
down with me or not?

1277
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:42,194
No. Please. Look, l can go
a couple of hundred bucks...

1278
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,165
but that's it.
l am cleaned out.

1279
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,462
Well, you better get
your friends out there...

1280
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,298
to start writing checks.

1281
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:49,861
You got till dessert.

1282
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,739
l was thinking
about all the dogs...

1283
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:55,642
that have been gassed in L.A.
over the years...

1284
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:59,307
and it occurred to me that
we're all kind of stray dogs...

1285
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:01,145
on this lonely planet.

1286
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:04,381
So, l'm asking you to join me
in showing our love...

1287
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,878
not only for
these poor homeless mutts...

1288
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:09,289
but for each other.

1289
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:11,384
Please, give generously.

1290
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,226
l know l will.

1291
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:18,598
ls the bar still open?

1292
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:22,195
-Do you have a valet ticket?
-We'd better get going, honey.

1293
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,729
My throat's dry. l want to go.

1294
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:11,584
#' A candy-colored clown
they call the sandman #'

1295
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,079
#' Tiptoes to my room
every night #'

1296
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:19,026
#' Just to sprinkle stardust
and to whisper #'

1297
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:25,227
#' ''Go to sleep,
everything is all right'' #'

1298
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:29,705
#' l close my eyes #'

1299
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:34,608
#' Then l drift away #'

1300
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:39,604
#' lnto the magic night #'

1301
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,812
#' l softly say #'

1302
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:47,118
#' A silent prayer #'

1303
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:52,458
#' Like dreamers do #'

1304
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:56,727
#' Then l fall asleep to dream #'

1305
01:03:56,766 --> 01:04:01,066
#' My dreams of you... #'

1306
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,163
-Hi.
-Hey.

1307
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,698
Look, l don't know
what you said to Bucky Brandt...

1308
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:10,075
but whatever it was, it worked.

1309
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,602
l mean, l didn't even think...

1310
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,012
anybody was listening
to the guy...

1311
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:17,884
and now l'm $4,000 over my goal,
so...thank you.

1312
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,888
You saved me.

1313
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,482
l'm just happy it worked out.

1314
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,461
Do you want to dance?

1315
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:32,831
Yeah. Love to. Heh.

1316
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:41,576
#' Only in dreams #'

1317
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:51,049
#' ln beautiful dreams #'

1318
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,360
-Heh.
-Heh.

1319
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,303
Do you do this professionally?

1320
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:19,212
l do. l'm a professional
circus freak makeup artist.

1321
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,977
-Ha ha.
-Ha ha ha!

1322
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:24,180
Mmm. l just need
a little more right here.

1323
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,653
Ha ha ha!

1324
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,555
Oh, God, l think that the, um...

1325
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:32,220
the water is not cold enough
to make Jell-o. Ha ha ha ha!

1326
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,491
-lt was an inspired idea.
-Thank you.

1327
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,397
-Here, you want that?
-Ah! Ow! Ow!

1328
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,060
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Shit!

1329
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,796
-Use that.
-Ow.

1330
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:43,396
Ha ha ha! Wait, l don't know--

1331
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,997
-Ha ha ha.
-Ha ha ha!

1332
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,009
You...come here.

1333
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:49,876
Mm. Mmm.

1334
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:52,273
OK.

1335
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:54,909
-Want that now?
-Mm-hmm.

1336
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,680
All right.

1337
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,812
-Heh.
-Ha ha ha ha!

1338
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:00,788
Hi.

1339
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:02,814
lsn't sex great?

1340
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:05,452
Yeah. l was
a little worried, though...

1341
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:07,325
because usually,
if you're with somebody...

1342
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:11,060
who's funny and caring and nice,
the sex is gonna be...

1343
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,568
-Really shitty.
-Pretty terrible.

1344
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,297
Ha ha ha ha!

1345
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:20,701
Listen, there's something
l always wanted to tell you.

1346
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,267
Yeah?

1347
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:25,508
-No. Come here.
-What?

1348
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:27,539
Come here. Let's just
go back to where we were.

1349
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:28,709
Wait, wait, wait.

1350
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,309
-Mm-mmm.
-Mmm.

1351
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:31,820
-Uh-huh.
-Mm-mmm.

1352
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:34,482
Wait a minute. Ha ha ha! Wait.

1353
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,821
l want to hear
what you were gonna tell me.

1354
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,754
What was it?

1355
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,200
OK, what if l say it first?

1356
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:47,759
Come here.

1357
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,296
l love you.

1358
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:58,080
Oh. OK. Heh.

1359
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,979
l love you, too.

1360
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,529
Hello?

1361
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,036
Hey, it's me.

1362
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:27,202
Um, we really need to talk,
so can you come over?

1363
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,711
OK.

1364
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:32,373
l'll be back around 6:00.

1365
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:35,509
-Having fun with Val?
-Yeah.

1366
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,179
Bye.

1367
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:00,802
Mmm.

1368
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,270
-Thank you.
-Good night.

1369
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:08,374
-l'm gonna call...you...later.
-OK. Ha ha ha!

1370
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,078
OK, bye.

1371
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,259
Hey, Val.

1372
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:21,058
Eileen! Oh, my God. How are you?

1373
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,589
l'm great.
Um, l hope l'm not too late.

1374
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,796
The drive from Laurel Canyon
was just terrible.

1375
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,362
Heh. Late...for what?

1376
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,896
Um...

1377
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,641
Heh.

1378
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,976
Allison. Allison?

1379
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,188
What the hell is this?

1380
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:50,988
Don't get mad. We're here
because we want to help you.

1381
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,994
l'm sorry.
l thought l made myself clear...

1382
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,019
when l said, ''Go fuck yourself.''

1383
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,089
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
lt's not just Jack.

1384
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,532
We're all here
at this intervention...

1385
01:08:58,567 --> 01:08:59,693
because we're worried.

1386
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:03,535
lntervention? What, like--
like l'm some drug addict?

1387
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,267
No, no, no. That's not it.

1388
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,002
We did an intervention
for my mom...

1389
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,339
when she tried to kill herself.

1390
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:11,039
Joan,
your mother did kill herself.

1391
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,947
Eventually...yes.

1392
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,543
And thank you for
bringing that up, Mr. Shithead!

1393
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:18,849
Oh, God!

1394
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:20,856
Joan, Joan--see?

1395
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,084
This is exactly
what we're talking about.

1396
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,490
-You're out of control.
-You're crying out for help!

1397
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:26,893
-You're over the edge.
-You used to be so pleasant.

1398
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,726
You're such an asshole.

1399
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:31,130
Jesus. What the hell
are you doing here?

1400
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,498
Oh, you're dating
one of my friends...

1401
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,628
and you don't even have
the balls to tell me about it?

1402
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,467
-Owen?
-Val.

1403
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,531
-What's going on here?
-Listen--

1404
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,202
Owen's friends and l
called for an intervention.

1405
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,369
What?

1406
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:44,879
He's pissed on all his friends.
He needs help.

1407
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,381
We just wanted to talk to him
before he leaves.

1408
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,042
Leaves? You're leaving?

1409
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,074
Face it, Owen. You're not
gonna have a support group...

1410
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,347
when you're at Breighton.

1411
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,321
Breighton?
What--what is he talking about?

1412
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,481
You didn't even tell her?

1413
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:57,617
-Tell me what?
-Listen, l--

1414
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,694
Uh...l got offered a job.

1415
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,460
Oh, you are a wee little man.

1416
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,060
A what?
What are you even doing here?

1417
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:09,400
She's a friend.
And she loves you.

1418
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,406
Listen,
will you get out of my house?

1419
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,601
Dude, it's not your house.
You don't live here.

1420
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,769
Great. You don't even live here.

1421
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:17,369
No, l do.
Would you listen to me?

1422
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,881
Just forget it, Owen...
if that really is your name.

1423
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:21,780
ls there any--wait!

1424
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:36,553
Wait. Can you wait a second?

1425
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,432
Can l at least explain
my side of it?

1426
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:42,028
You knew l was coming off
a bad relationship.

1427
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:45,302
l don't--how could you
just lie to me?

1428
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:48,071
Listen, l needed to find out
if it was real or not.

1429
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,635
l mean, they say that it takes
three months of dating...

1430
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:52,738
before a person reveals
their worst qualities.

1431
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,681
Well, l didn't have
three months...

1432
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,947
so l showed you all
my worst qualities in a week.

1433
01:10:56,986 --> 01:11:02,982
So, all this time, you've been
trying to test this?

1434
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,721
No, not test it, tank it.

1435
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:09,288
But even l can't screw this up.

1436
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:11,558
Wow.

1437
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,465
l don't want to lose you.

1438
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,968
You--you--
Come to Jersey with me.

1439
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:23,506
lf you have so much faith in us,
why don't you stay?

1440
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:27,948
Because l can't go back
in there, all right?

1441
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:30,474
My life here is over.
lt was all a big lie...

1442
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:31,645
so l burned it to the ground...

1443
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:32,813
and the only thing
that l have left...

1444
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:34,948
is this tiny shard
of self-respect...

1445
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:38,482
and if l don't get out of here,
then l'm gonna lose that, too.

1446
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:41,325
l think you already have.

1447
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,636
# l... #

1448
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:57,771
Hey, Holmes.

1449
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,145
-Come here.
-Ohh!

1450
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,581
Ohh...

1451
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:04,108
Oh. Ohh.

1452
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,678
Uhh.

1453
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:07,814
Ohh.

1454
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:10,825
Hi. You got to help me out.

1455
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,225
These guys really want
their goddamn money.

1456
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,025
l tried writing
the ending myself.

1457
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:19,160
Could you just take a look
at pages 188 to 301?

1458
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:23,194
Chapter twenty-two
is a fuckin' snore.

1459
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:24,637
Ohh.

1460
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,036
# We #

1461
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:31,703
Ohh.

1462
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,739
# Walked for hours #

1463
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:39,345
# lt seems she didn't like #

1464
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:42,050
# That day #

1465
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:48,894
# So we paint the picture gray #

1466
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:56,669
# l don't want truth,
l just want her #

1467
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:03,002
# The chance has come #

1468
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:09,745
# The chance has come #

1469
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:40,748
Professor, at last. lt's really
an honor to see you again.

1470
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:43,752
Welcome, my friend.
l see you finally made it, huh?

1471
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:47,620
But not without
a good L.A. beating, huh?

1472
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,485
Now, are you actually
from Los Angeles?

1473
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:54,894
Um, no. The east coast, but
l moved there seven years ago.

1474
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,659
l thought it might be
a good place to write.

1475
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,030
So did
Faulkner, Huxley, and Didion.

1476
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,230
They left bitter,
creatively impotent.

1477
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,707
Well, at least
it was creatively.

1478
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,231
Do you miss it?

1479
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,575
Um, it was fun while it lasted.

1480
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,137
Yeah, you sleep with L.A.
You don't marry her.

1481
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:16,345
Well, he didn't, did he?

1482
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:44,911
Hi.
For Stephanie, press star two.

1483
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:47,347
For Allison,
leave a message after the beep.

1484
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,077
ldiot.

1485
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:16,471
l really enjoyed
the first three chapters.

1486
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:20,414
They are funny,
but also disturbing and violent.

1487
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:24,279
Now, an intro. Uh...

1488
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,877
Where's my Nana?

1489
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:29,856
l don't know. For some reason,
she wasn't mentioned...

1490
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,120
in the U.N. summit address.

1491
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,456
Oh, forget summit.

1492
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:35,224
Here, we'll put a story about
my Nana beating my ass black.

1493
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:38,932
But l thought
we were going to focus...

1494
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:42,266
on the roles of physics
and social responsibility.

1495
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:43,430
Nobody cares about the physics.

1496
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:47,875
They want
pain, suffering, and victory.

1497
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,537
But this is your chance
to rewrite history...

1498
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:50,704
and finally tell the truth.

1499
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:54,079
lf l wanted to write history,
why would l hire you?

1500
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,908
Excuse me?

1501
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,920
l hire you because you sell.

1502
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,289
Now, chapter one.

1503
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,301
Professor, l...

1504
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,099
You know,
l--l don't think l can do this.

1505
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,129
Why not?

1506
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:22,335
Well, because l came here...

1507
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:23,867
to write the truth
about your life...

1508
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:25,812
no matter
how difficult that may be.

1509
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:28,179
l am a historical figure,
God damn it.

1510
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:30,047
You write what l say to write.

1511
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:36,317
Now...

1512
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:41,153
forget about this whole...

1513
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:42,663
Here we tell the story...

1514
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:49,001
about alcoholic violin teacher
and Doris, her little spaniel.

1515
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,336
Hello?

1516
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,280
Hi.

1517
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,114
Where are you?

1518
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,807
Hi.

1519
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,478
Hi.

1520
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,744
Look, l, um...

1521
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,879
l know your new life
probably doesn't like it...

1522
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:44,654
when your ex-life
shows up uninvited, but...

1523
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:48,652
l was in the city, and
l wanted to stop by and say hi.

1524
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,358
So, hi.

1525
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:53,163
No, no, l'm really glad you did.

1526
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:55,135
What are you doing here anyways?

1527
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,503
lnterviewing
for some teaching jobs overseas.

1528
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,667
You're kidding.
You're leaving L.A.?

1529
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:04,110
Well, my interview at
the lnternational lnstitute...

1530
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,306
didn't go so well.

1531
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,249
How's Stephanie?

1532
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:09,841
We broke up.

1533
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,318
Really?

1534
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,787
What--what happened?

1535
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:16,552
Well, l, um...

1536
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:20,789
l--l realized that
the things l liked about her...

1537
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:25,289
weren't hers, they were yours.

1538
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:29,699
You know, what you did to me
was really shitty.

1539
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:31,501
Well, if it's any consolation...

1540
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,703
your little intervention
left me pretty shattered.

1541
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:37,371
So, l guess we're even.

1542
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:40,978
OK.

1543
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,382
Have you heard anything
from Val?

1544
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,547
Not a word. You?

1545
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,955
She's moving to London.

1546
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:52,085
What?

1547
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,459
She got a job with an animal
rights group, three year gig.

1548
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:55,861
There's a--

1549
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,866
There's a going away party
for her, actually.

1550
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,163
l'm throwing it.

1551
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:04,434
We kind of became friends, so...

1552
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:10,741
Oh, that's great.
You know, that's...

1553
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,009
l mean, l can't believe
she doesn't even tell me...

1554
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:15,312
that she's leaving the country
for three years.

1555
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:19,116
l mean, nothing--not even
a--a text message, you know?

1556
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:21,281
''Changing continents.
l hope you're doing well.''

1557
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,154
Look, if you've been
thinking about it that much...

1558
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:26,649
maybe--maybe
you should go back and tell her.

1559
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:28,060
Forget about it.

1560
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,462
God, you know,
you always do this, Owen.

1561
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,957
You wait and you wait, and then
you wonder why you miss out.

1562
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:36,971
Come on, l did that once--
with Eileen.

1563
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:38,472
And us.

1564
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,009
Yeah.

1565
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,377
Yeah, l always thought
we'd end up together.

1566
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,647
l wonder what happened.

1567
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:54,655
Well, l think we were saving it
for a rainy day--

1568
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:57,385
only it's L.A.

1569
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,120
lt never rains.

1570
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:40,696
That morning began
like any other.

1571
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:42,862
l walked into the office,
took a sip of coffee...

1572
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:44,735
and started reading
the writer's latest chapters.

1573
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:47,105
lt was then that it hit me.
He was gone.

1574
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:48,541
And at that moment,
l realized...

1575
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:50,101
what the writer
had already figured out.

1576
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:52,875
l had a brilliant mind,
but l was a morally bankrupt...

1577
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:54,643
greedy little man
whose entire personal life...

1578
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,982
was nothing more than one boring
seventy-two-year-long fart.

1579
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:08,857
Well, this truly is a fine
piece of verse, my friend.

1580
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,990
You've made this explorer proud.

1581
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,159
Can you please
call off your thugs now?

1582
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,431
Ha ha. Done, amigo.

1583
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,995
l just hope you're not
still feeling dirty...

1584
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,165
and cheapened by this.

1585
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,504
Bucky, let's face it.

1586
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,635
This is the literary
equivalent of syphilis.

1587
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,805
Ha ha. Well, of course
you feel that way now.

1588
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:27,439
You're a young man.

1589
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:28,972
As you grow older,
you're going to find...

1590
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:33,852
that all those feelings of guilt
and fear of moral retribution...

1591
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,347
all that shit we learned
as kids, it all disappears.

1592
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,451
Gradually, we heal.

1593
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:41,291
How can you say that...

1594
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:43,763
when your lack of morality
almost cost you your home...

1595
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:46,198
your family,
everything good in your life.

1596
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:51,001
OK, so l did a few bad things,
but the book came out perfect.

1597
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,634
l paid my debt.
l even made twenty grand.

1598
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:57,873
lt really is a wonderful life.

1599
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,710
Thank you.

1600
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:19,623
Owen?

1601
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,761
-Hi.
-Hi.

1602
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:25,295
-What are you doing here?
-l just got off a plane.

1603
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,069
So, here you are.

1604
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,440
-l am.
-Oh.

1605
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:30,774
And l was thinking
about what you said.

1606
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:33,042
Look who's back. Hey, stranger.

1607
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:34,514
Jack.

1608
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:37,609
Hi. Allison, Jack.
Jack, Allison.

1609
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,176
Hey, there.

1610
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,915
l'm going to talk to you later.

1611
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,184
OK.

1612
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:46,090
Jack,
l'm sorry for being such a jerk.

1613
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,687
Um, l know that you
and everyone in the group...

1614
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:51,028
were just trying to do
what's good for me...

1615
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:54,433
and l apologize for being
such a prick about everything.

1616
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:56,960
Don't worry about it.
Not a problem.

1617
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:59,269
No, seriously. l owe you a--

1618
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,934
lt's OK. l mean...

1619
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:04,309
l honestly haven't given it
a second thought.

1620
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:06,405
l'm not in AA anymore.

1621
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:09,679
You're kidding me.
Why? What happened?

1622
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,709
lt's all a load of shit.

1623
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:15,712
The same depressing people
every week--l had to get out.

1624
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,691
Me and a few guys
from the group...

1625
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:20,889
we went in on a vineyard.

1626
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,829
Anyway, nice to see you.

1627
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:25,230
lt was nice seeing you.

1628
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,598
Look, l am really sorry...

1629
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:30,627
that things didn't work out
with you and Allison, but we--

1630
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,774
l am really sorry
about that wedding video.

1631
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:39,143
l mean, it was
tasteless and offensive...

1632
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:42,081
and you guys really got me back
by sending out that MPEG.

1633
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:46,019
l mean, practically everyone
here has seen my ass.

1634
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:47,214
So, what do you say?

1635
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,749
OK.

1636
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,123
l'm so sorry
that l used the ''C'' word.

1637
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,254
lt wasn't about you. lt was me.

1638
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:13,244
Hey, man, welcome back.

1639
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:14,339
Thanks.

1640
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,850
l see you finally spoke
to Susan.

1641
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:21,049
Yeah. l guess it's official.
l'm off the Christmas card list.

1642
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:23,523
Yeah, man, don't worry about it.
You were never on it.

1643
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:27,688
Well, that's fine, if that's
the way you want it to be.

1644
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,822
Oh, it is.
l don't ever want to see...

1645
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:31,593
any of my friends
talking to her again.

1646
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:33,692
What?

1647
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:37,364
You were right, man.
We broke up. Tch. Fuck it.

1648
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:39,532
l started asking my friends
what they thought about her...

1649
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:40,700
and no one liked her.

1650
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,710
Then l realized l've become
a different person...

1651
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,302
ever since
l started dating her...

1652
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:47,280
only no one wanted to tell me--
except you.

1653
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,543
Thanks, man.

1654
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:52,144
Well, the pleasure was not mine.

1655
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:54,883
-Hey.
-Can you believe it?

1656
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,823
Ahh. My boy is back.

1657
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:58,485
Yeah. Ha ha.

1658
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:00,619
Let's get something to drink.

1659
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,391
Fuckin' juice box.

1660
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,231
-Come on.
-Yeah.

1661
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,936
As l was saying outside, l, um--

1662
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:13,907
Dude, there she is.

1663
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,410
Now, this is your shot.
Don't be a pussy.

1664
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:23,815
lt's a great plan,
so l'm really, really--

1665
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:27,650
-Will you excuse me for a second?
-Yeah, yeah.

1666
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:30,752
-Owen, hi.
-Hi.

1667
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:31,986
-Oh, God.
-Oh, God.

1668
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:34,586
l thought you were back east.
What are you doing here?

1669
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,256
There was a problem
with the book.

1670
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:39,323
l mean, the guy turned out
to be a complete and utter hack...

1671
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:43,133
and l, uh, l made a big mistake.

1672
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:44,798
l'm sorry.

1673
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:46,500
Anyway, l--l hear
you're moving to London.

1674
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:49,339
-Yeah.
-Wow.

1675
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:50,537
l've never been
out of the country.

1676
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:52,978
l mean, Alaska doesn't count.

1677
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:58,676
Besides, l've just been feeling
like l need a change, you know?

1678
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,415
Oh.

1679
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:07,224
You know, t-there's something
l wanted to tell you...

1680
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,721
before it's too late.

1681
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:16,462
Look, Owen, maybe we can
talk about this some other time.

1682
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,472
No,
l--l really need to say it now.

1683
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:20,974
OK. Ahem.

1684
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:26,546
l'm sorry.

1685
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:29,880
l'm sorry for everything.

1686
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:34,153
Thank you.

1687
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:37,215
l just--l just wanted
to put that out there...

1688
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:38,816
before you took off.

1689
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,225
Thanks.

1690
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:45,892
So, what are you
going to do now?

1691
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:47,561
-l'm starting a book.
-Yeah?

1692
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,627
-A novel.
-Wow.

1693
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,502
l'll bet you write
something great.

1694
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,235
We'll see.

1695
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:56,436
Anyway,
it--it's good to see you.

1696
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:58,502
-You, too.
-Thanks for coming.

1697
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,413
Take care of yourself, OK?

1698
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,212
You take care of you, too.

1699
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:28,069
So, did you get her back?

1700
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:30,134
No.

1701
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:33,045
What? What happened?

1702
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,413
l apologized, and she said OK.

1703
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,441
Oh, my God. Owen,
you are such a fucking pussy.

1704
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:39,316
Hey, l don't have
to explain myself to you.

1705
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:41,754
l just--l can't believe you came
all the way back here...

1706
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,848
to get her back, and you folded.

1707
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:47,122
-No, l didn't.
-Meow, meow, meow.

1708
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,458
l came back for you.

1709
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,125
What?

1710
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:55,329
l want to be with you.

1711
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:57,937
l...

1712
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:03,901
When did this happen?

1713
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,014
l--sometime between
the first day we met...

1714
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:11,780
and last Tuesday
at the Newark airport.

1715
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:17,012
-Aw, shit. God damn it, Owen.
-What?

1716
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:21,791
l got the job, and l'm leaving
for China next week.

1717
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,694
Jesus Christ!

1718
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:25,198
l mean, you're the one
who said L.A. was giving you...

1719
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:26,632
frontal lobe cirrhosis.

1720
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:27,794
l probably wouldn't have
even thought of it...

1721
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:28,961
if it wasn't for you.

1722
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,664
Well, l'm glad l could help.

1723
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,032
Well, it's only six months.

1724
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:35,838
Yeah, but, you know,
you're going to go out there...

1725
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:36,866
you're going to meet
other people.

1726
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:38,606
You may never come back here.

1727
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:39,874
l'll come back.

1728
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:43,646
l will. l'll come back.

1729
01:28:45,186 --> 01:28:47,154
Where are you going to be?

1730
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,382
l'll be here.
