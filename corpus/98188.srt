1
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:24,988
Ray, you wanna lose
your mouthpiece again?

2
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:26,665
Come on, use your jab!

3
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,596
Box the damn guy,
come on!

4
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:30,667
Get out of that corner!

5
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:35,500
Thaùs it, thaùs my little brother!
Come on, busy hands!

6
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:40,802
Jab! Jab!
Come on, Uncle Ray.

7
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:43,410
Thaùs it, little brother.
Come on.

8
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:47,052
He's getting to you, Ray.
Come on.

9
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,452
- Thaùs it, thaùs it.
- Left hook.

10
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:52,250
- Once is not enough. Come on, again.
- Jab, jab.

11
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:59,128
Thaùs it. You see what happens
when you listen to me?

12
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,129
- Way to go.
- Thanks.

13
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:13,010
Hey, you do not belong up here,
all right? I'm not gonna tell you again.

14
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:15,874
Go wash your hands
and make yourself invisible.

15
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:18,584
Pete, she's your daughter.
She wants to help out.

16
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:22,221
She's a midget with a head full
of stupid. Who's she gonna help, huh?

17
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:27,485
- Crisco, can I get a hand over here?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:30,085
On the way, Mr. K.

19
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,496
Come on!

20
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,812
Hey, do you know
who you are

21
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:55,885
out of all the girls
in the world?

22
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:58,786
I'm your favorite?

23
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:01,051
And whaùs she gonna do
when she grows up?

24
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,931
- Kick butt and break hearts.
- Thaùs right.

25
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:08,157
The worlÔs an oyster
and you're a pearl.

26
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:11,599
Pearls are pretty,
and they're tough.

27
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:15,002
And pretty tough can do anything.
Remember that.

28
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:18,435
OK, Uncle Ray.

29
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,006
OK.

30
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,623
Hey, Mr. Abel.

31
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:12,759
- Hey, how are you, sir?
- Good to see you.

32
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,427
- Good morning, Mr. Abel.
- Yeah, beautiful.

33
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:22,098
Coffee.

34
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,908
Where's my coffee?

35
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:30,116
Coffee. It was not a question
the first time I asked for it.

36
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,719
You told me last week,
"absolutely, positively no coffee",

37
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:37,389
and I absolutely,
positively believed you.

38
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:40,916
Tear sheets for tomorrow.
<i>The Telegram</i> bled our ad.

39
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:44,654
Iùs nothing major, but we should
get credit for the next fight.

40
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,559
Memo from finance:
The budget

41
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,132
is officially overdue.
I ran some numbers...

42
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:52,669
- Did you take care of my bookie?
- I stalled him and your ex-wife.

43
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:56,000
I also printed out your e-mail,
restocked your bar,

44
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,336
hosed down Mel Harris.
Numbers:

45
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:02,345
Top drawer, left side, all you
have to do is sign off on them.

46
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:05,382
You see, thaùs why
I'm the boss, Kallen.

47
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,553
Because I let you handle
things for me.

48
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,746
Nobody gives me credit,
but if I were you and worked for me,

49
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,390
I would send myself roses.

50
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:18,553
Well, roses die and you might be
allergic, but thanks for thinking of you.

51
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:22,666
LaRocca's event briefng,
where do you want that?

52
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:26,498
In the conference room. And don't
stick the cutout in the corner.

53
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:27,968
Iùs my handiwork.

54
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:30,836
Put it someplace Sammy can see.

55
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,208
All right?

56
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:45,088
I hate it.

57
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,893
I hate it a lot.

58
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:50,929
Are these guys
gonna fight or foxtrot?

59
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,190
They look like <i>Homo saplens</i>
or something.

60
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,766
They are <i>Homo saplens.</i>

61
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,333
Kallen speaks.

62
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,029
And from a mile away.

63
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:04,404
- Am I contagious or something?
- No, iùs not a hygienic thing.

64
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,544
She just gets
kind of shy around you.

65
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:27,228
I'm sorry you're unhappy
with the standee,

66
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:30,631
but we only went with the shot
because your guys approved it.

67
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:46,210
If I say the shiùs shit,
iùs shit.

68
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:50,648
I mean, they told me that you
signed off on it, Sammy.

69
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:54,349
I don't know what the hell happened.
Jackie, what happened?

70
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:59,529
I don't care what happened.
You have 48 hours before the fight.

71
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,259
I want the two faggots fixed.

72
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:06,869
I mean, who the hell does
Sam LaRocca think he is?

73
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:10,236
- A made man, thaùs who.
- No, he is the antichrist.

74
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:13,105
He is...
With a bank account.

75
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,103
He is this.

76
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:17,210
An $80 shoe?

77
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,645
He is the gum
on the bottom of my shoe.

78
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,821
Thaùs what Abel and LaRocca are.

79
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,856
They're the gum,
you're the shoe.

80
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:26,923
How come they walk all over you?

81
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:38,568
Get a little older, work a little longer,
you won't be so judgmental then.

82
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:42,173
You think I like working for idiots
who take advantage of me?

83
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,833
Thaùs easy for you to say.
This is not the best job you ever had.

84
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,879
At least here I get to see boxing,
in person, for free.

85
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,347
Boxing makes
all the other shit bearable.

86
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,247
If I didn't love it
as much as I do,

87
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:58,423
I'd be the first in line to bend over so
LaRocca and Abel could kiss my ass.

88
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:01,026
OK, don't get upset with me

89
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,957
just because you know
that I know how smart you are.

90
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:06,462
So now you think smart
is all there is to it?

91
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:10,500
That your brain can just plot the best
course and your life just goes there?

92
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:12,933
The world is not an oyster.

93
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,501
It is a smelly tank
full of dirty water and sharks.

94
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:20,770
It is not that easy to swim.

95
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:29,446
Jackie, you need to get
real about where you are,

96
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,214
which is stuck.
In the basement.

97
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:35,326
You can't even see
the glass ceiling from here.

98
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:38,622
Find an elevator,
press some buttons.

99
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:41,257
At least the only way out is up.

100
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:01,511
Yo, Tyrell, wait up!

101
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:05,223
Clean towels,
we need more clean towels.

102
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:09,856
Bad break, Rex.

103
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:11,530
Bad break?
I won that fight.

104
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,858
Come on, you saw it.
Everybody saw it.

105
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,661
You woulÔve won
if you hadn't run out of gas.

106
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:20,038
You train serious,
you could have a career.

107
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,971
I woulÔve given you a draw.

108
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:25,201
You deserved a draw.

109
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:36,587
He looks like shit.
Day-old shit.

110
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,257
If day-old shit
shook like an AK-47.

111
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,917
Shut up! You can't say dick
that wouldn't piss me off more.

112
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:46,562
Iùs all good.
Mr. LaRocca, iùs adrenaline.

113
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,868
Shakes don't mean nothing.
Ask my last 12 wins.

114
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:52,128
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, Devon.

115
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,670
I'm only interested
in the 13th.

116
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:58,569
Lose tonight and you'll be waving
bye-bye to your career, your fan club

117
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:01,178
and the free hoochie mamas
that go with it.

118
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,178
What are you selling?

119
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:06,378
Sorry to interrupt,
but iùs showtime.

120
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:11,288
Leùs get out of here.

121
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,354
Come on, you can do this.
Leùs do this.

122
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:18,029
Get your hands up, you bum!

123
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:23,035
He's got no left hand. Whaùs going
on? Whaùs the story with Greene?

124
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:31,034
<i>Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!</i>
<i>Pedro! Pedro!</i>

125
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,610
Get off the ropes!

126
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,852
OK, OK. Thaùs it. Thaùs it.

127
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:50,825
- Forget this guy Greene.
- Yeah.

128
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:53,431
No more, no more.

129
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,231
He's dead.
Thaùs a kaput.

130
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:59,200
No, he's good. Iùs like
he didn't bother to show up.

131
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:03,569
Trust me, he's dead. And if I know
Sammy, he already wrote the obituary.

132
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:05,243
- See you, Gavin.
- See you.

133
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:28,025
Excuse me. Yeah.

134
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:37,139
Jacqueline.

135
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,717
I'd offer a seat, but I don't think
anyone would get up.

136
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:50,854
- Thirsty?
- Let me buy you a drink.

137
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:54,186
Bowie, hi.
Can I get a wine cooler

138
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:57,727
and whatever Gavin's drinking
whenever he's ready? On me.

139
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,455
- All right.
- Like that dress.

140
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:05,200
- The cleaner's shrunk it.
- I'll send a thank-you note.

141
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,636
Did you get that fax on Needles'
demos? They're good.

142
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:15,075
Put him on your show. He's exactly
what your advertisers want.

143
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,579
- Do we have to do this now?
- Do what, talk?

144
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:20,582
We're not talking.
You're negotiating. Stop it.

145
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:24,416
Listen, if I was a man trying
to close a deal, you wouldn't say that.

146
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:28,287
Oh, please.
Don't throw sex in my face.

147
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,556
- Unless you mean it.
- You see how you are?

148
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,994
I can't have a regular
conversation with you.

149
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,962
You're afraid to have
a regular conversation with me.

150
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,695
Oh, right. You're Mr. Irresistible.

151
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,071
I wish.

152
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:43,640
Kallen!

153
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:46,812
Come here.
Come here!

154
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:49,675
I gotta go.

155
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,651
There it is.

156
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:58,380
For the pride of Puerto Rico.

157
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,827
Promise me you'll wear
this for the championship bout.

158
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:01,191
Promise me you'll wear
this for the championship bout.

159
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:03,624
- Here we go.
- Oh, yeah!

160
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:12,167
Kallen. Good. J. Lo's coming
to the Coliseum next month.

161
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:14,805
I want me and Pedro
front and center.

162
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:18,170
- Front and center? Consider it done.
- Done and done.

163
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:22,109
- Hey, shouldn't you have that on ice?
- What are you, a doctor?

164
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:25,078
No, the doctors are busy
stitching up Greene.

165
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:28,253
Unprofessional pussy
didn't even bother

166
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:30,752
to give the fans
a decent fight, nothing.

167
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:33,450
Screw him. He's a Polaroid.

168
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:35,354
He's out of the picture.

169
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:42,258
Pedro, I'm a man who hates defeat,

170
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:44,959
but I'm not too proud
to be candid.

171
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:49,073
You won because you worked
and Greene didn't.

172
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:52,574
He's a lazy-ass fighter,
and lazy-ass always loses.

173
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,643
Thaùs a fact.

174
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,608
Right, half-pint?

175
00:13:58,451 --> 00:13:59,713
Well, I'm...

176
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,318
I'm not sure why Devon lost.

177
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:08,591
Maybe he just felt
insecure about his corner.

178
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:10,819
You know, boxing is a team sport.

179
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,090
If a boxer doesn't feel
support in his corner,

180
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,564
sometimes it comes out
in the ring.

181
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,261
Listen to the Barbie doll
with the glass balls.

182
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,607
What do you know about support?

183
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:25,709
What do you know about boxing?

184
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:28,704
Executive assistant.

185
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:32,377
You wipe Irv Abel's ass for a living.

186
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:42,050
I cover Irv Abel's ass for a living.

187
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:46,832
And I know as much
about boxing as either of you.

188
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,334
Whaùs that mean?

189
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,372
- Nothing. Forget it.
- Forget it?

190
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,637
You talk like you think
you can do what I do.

191
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:05,613
Whaùs the point in thinking that?
I don't have a boxer.

192
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:08,719
Do you think
you can do what I do?

193
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,947
- Possibly, if given a chance.
- A chance? Thaùs all you need?

194
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:15,559
- Yeah, probably.
- Greene's contract. Iùs yours.

195
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,430
- Sure it is.
- Hey! You don't want it?

196
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:28,671
- I can't afford it.
- You can't afford it. I'll make it easy.

197
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:31,638
- Iùs yours for a dollar.
- I don't have a dollar.

198
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,248
I'll lend you a dollar.

199
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,656
I tell you what, half-pint.

200
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,350
I'm gonna forget
what you said

201
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:51,860
since you don't know
what you're talking about.

202
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:53,531
Because if you did,

203
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:58,070
you'd know it don't pay
to shoot your mouth off at me.

204
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:10,914
I just bought a boxer for a buck.

205
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:13,017
I think it pays pretty well, Sam.

206
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:44,380
I'm not keeping him.
I'm not keeping Greene.

207
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,178
It was a thing that became a thing.
LaRocca insulted me.

208
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:49,945
So what?
Sammy insults everybody.

209
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:53,887
You're gonna call him, make up,
kiss his ass if you have to.

210
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:55,492
If anybody asks
about Greene,

211
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:58,994
it was a joke, a little parlor trick
that you and Sammy played.

212
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,133
You lost your temper,
you said a few ridiculous things.

213
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,235
You set it right.
Iùll blow over.

214
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:07,634
Sammy won't think you're trying
to grow a brain on me.

215
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,976
It wasn't ridiculous, what I said.

216
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:15,204
And you shouldn't be
drinking that coffee.

217
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,257

Renee, iùs me. Quick.

231
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:08,395
Turn on Channel 28.
I'm on TV!

232
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:12,037
<i>Hey, Sam, do you know what</i>
<i>a coup ÔÈtat Is? Look It up.</i>

233
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:15,071
<i>I'm Gavin Reese for the</i> Reese Report.

234
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,860
Girl, what the hell
happened to all his money?

235
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,093
I didn't have a chance to ask.

236
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:47,499
His phone's disconnected,
so I had to come.

237
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,271
I got here, I was fine,
and then I wasn't fine.

238
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:52,876
So you called me for blackup.

239
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,569
Like I need Gangster Incorporated
in my life.

240
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:58,511
Like LaRocca is gonna
let you waltz off with his boxer.

241
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,481
Like any of this makes any sense.

242
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:05,852
Last night, after I vomited
and ruled out suicide, I realized

243
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,356
I'm more scared
not to do this than to do it.

244
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:11,121
Devon is a ranked boxer.

245
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,855
God practically dropped
him in my lap.

246
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:17,627
How can I walk away? I might
as well spit in the face of destiny.

247
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:19,866
Now he's your destiny?

248
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:27,945
Devon, are you in there?
Iùs Jackie Kallen.

249
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,442
We tried. We failed. Leùs go.

250
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,049
Wait, wait, I hear something.

251
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,584
He's unlocking the door.
He's home.

252
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,217
Devon, did you know
your phone's not work...?

253
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,368
You know Stormy.

254
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,668
This ain't no double date.
Get the shit.

255
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,473
We don't have any shit.

256
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:07,618
- Then why'd you page me?
- We didn't.

257
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,219
- Why?
- Devon, iùs me.

258
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,756
Iùs Jackie from the arena.
We just...

259
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:15,450
Anyway, we came by to say hey.

260
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:17,629
And you're busy,
so we'll come back.

261
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,630
You bitches ain't going nowhere till we
get our rock! Give my man your bag!

262
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:26,262
There's just enough tokens
in there for my laundry.

263
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:29,464
- Thaùs all I have with me...
- A dollar bill, maybe.

264
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:31,937
What am I, a punk?

265
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:35,341
A chump? You can just
smoke T.J.'s shit like iùs a gift?

266
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,276
Man, come here!

267
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,397
Man, you done messed up my high.

268
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:15,018
Come on, Jackie, leùs go!
Leùs go! Leùs go! Leùs go!

269
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:46,612
- I'm sorry.
- I don't forgive you.

270
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:49,349
"Where's my rock, bitches?"

271
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:59,453
What about that guy, the way he
waxed the floor with both their asses?

272
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:01,530
- That was off the hook!
- Honey, no.

273
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:05,295
He was a thug
who out-thugged another thug.

274
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:08,132
A thug-and-a-half
if you count your boy Devon,

275
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,399
who is pathetic, Jackie!

276
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,577
His contract only cost a dollar.

277
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:14,177
You still overpaid!

278
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,409
- Call me later.
- I'm sorry.

279
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,550
You better be.

280
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,295
I'm going to see my cousin Malik.

281
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:46,203
I don't know why you mess with me,
all these criminals out here, man.

282
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:06,830
Oh, hey, Luther Shaw.
Jackie Kallen.

283
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:08,522
I bailed you out.

284
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,531
- I know you?
- No, no. Not exactly.

285
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:13,569
Listen. Do you have a minute
for a cup of coffee, a beer?

286
00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:16,570
- How about a milk shake?
- A milk shake?

287
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,938
Yeah. Yeah, whatever you drink.

288
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,980
Listen, I know this is unusual.

289
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,481
Believe me, I don't make a habit
of bailing strangers out of jail.

290
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:28,676
That would make me a nut,
a broke nut.

291
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:31,754
And I'm not. I'm not nutty.

292
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm just a person
taking a chance.

293
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:36,952
You might be interested in who I am
and what I have to say.

294
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:40,723
If you're not, I totally understand.
You don't owe me a thing.

295
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:44,630
Lf, on the other hand, you are,
my car's parked around the corner.

296
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:47,772
I'm harmless. Really.

297
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:50,441
Really, the worst
I could give you is a ride.

298
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:54,544
It was brutal, you know,
it was beautiful the way you fought.

299
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,044
Yeah. I can tell you fought before.
You boxed.

300
00:23:57,282 --> 00:24:00,183
You had some training,
you won some amateur bouts.

301
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,787
- You were good...
- Do you always talk like this?

302
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:04,285
- Like what?
- Too much?

303
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,822
- Actually, people have said...
- Thaùs a yes.

304
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,617
Know what, pull over right here.

305
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:11,352
- Right here. Pull over right here.
- OK, Luther.

306
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:13,622
This shit you're talking is crazy.

307
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:17,324
I think you're crazy. You gotta be.
Hanging with crackhead Devon.

308
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,629
I wasn't hanging with him.
I came to see...

309
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:23,296
Look, I didn't know he was
doing crack, OK? Iùs sad.

310
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:27,377
Another black man bites the dust.
Thanks for the bail, bitch.

311
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,415
- Jackie!
- Whaùs up?

312
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:33,140
My name is Jackie!

313
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:35,717
Crazy broad.
Whaùs happening?

314
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:46,259
Now, Luth, we ain't saying that
you ain't bad. We know that,

315
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,490
but don't be selling us some bullshit,

316
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,931
because you know you ain't mopped
the floor with no Devon Greene.

317
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:56,540
I'm telling you, man, I gave that fool an
old-fashioned, project ass-whupping.

318
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:59,768
I'm telling you, his partner
tried to get brave and sneak me.

319
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,742
I had to dust his ass off too.

320
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:08,746
- You still here?
- Yeah.

321
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:11,449
- Go home.
- I can't.

322
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:14,148
You didn't let me finish.

323
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,394
- Following him and shit.
- Whaùs up with that?

324
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,564
A little uptown piece.

325
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:30,538
I know. It must seem a little out there.
All right, way out there.

326
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:35,110
But that is where all the good stuff is,
Luther. Like talent, and you...

327
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,678
...you're talented.

328
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:42,252
So this chance you call yourself taking,
why you taking it on me?

329
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:45,218
Because I've been around
boxing my whole life.

330
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:49,986
I know it like the back of my hand.
I know potential, and I see it in you.

331
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:51,719
I do, Luther.

332
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,295
- I got potential?
- Yeah.

333
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:56,365
- Watch out, world.
- Don't laugh at me. All right?

334
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:58,297
I'm serious.
If you took me serious,

335
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:00,698
we could be driving Jags
and sporting Versace.

336
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:02,339
You're a woman.

337
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,872
And you're white.

338
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:05,744
- Say it like I'm a disease.
- In the fight game, you are.

339
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:06,938
- Say it like I'm a disease.
- In the fight game, you are.

340
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:12,406
I'm not saying it would be easy.
All right? But I'm used to hard.

341
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:16,216
I am. OK?

342
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:20,949
How do you want to do this?
Do you want to work together?

343
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:23,286
You want to make a deal?

344
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:25,427
- Make a deal?
- Yeah.

345
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:27,895
You never managed
nobody in your whole life.

346
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,500
How you gonna front me,
you can't front yourself?

347
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:33,398
You're nine-to-fiving it.
You're driving a damn Honda.

348
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:36,836
I have some savings, I'll do a budget.
I'm good with budgets.

349
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:39,737
And I'm really good with people.
I can read them.

350
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:44,574
And I can read you, Luther,
and I know you want to do this.

351
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,784
Maybe I'm interested.

352
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:48,884
Maybe I'll call you.
Maybe I won't.

353
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:52,590
You're the one thaùs gonna
have to wait and see.

354
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:28,653
When you pay your tickets,
you can register your vehicle.

355
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:35,355
Basically, iùs what you call an
"all there is to it" situation.

356
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:45,535
Mister, when you pay your tickets,
you can register...

357
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:48,302
- Hey, Felix.
- Next!

358
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,947
Jackie Kallen.
We spoke on the phone.

359
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,777
I remembered you, you didn't
remember me. Remember?

360
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:00,220
Hey, Cynthia, I'm breaking.

361
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:04,253
So you say this boy is good, huh?
Well, good is a dime a dozen.

362
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:07,296
Oh, no, he's better than good.
He's the bomb.

363
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:08,864
And you're the best.

364
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,831
You've turned more chumps
into champs than Eddie Futch.

365
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:14,267
I got out of the game
for a reason, you know.

366
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:17,931
Yeah, I know you had a stroke in '96.
I was sorry to hear about that.

367
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:20,737
The stroke didn't do
nothing but clear my head.

368
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:25,212
Look, I ain't got time to waste
training no cash registers

369
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,747
in it for the money.

370
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:31,144
Thaùs a wonderful sentiment,
and I totally agree.

371
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,449
Although ultimately,
boxing is a business.

372
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:35,319
Iùs a sport first.

373
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:37,927
You know, learn your craft,
pay your dues.

374
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,257
Money will come,
and it will go.

375
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:43,096
Thaùs why they call it "cash flow".

376
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:48,532
Felix, this kid reminds me
of Marvin Hagler.

377
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,836
Iùs just nonstop punches.
He is the real deal.

378
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:55,046
I wouldn't have
troubled you otherwise.

379
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:02,449
Ray-Ray Kallen's niece.

380
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:09,056
All right. I'll take a meet.

381
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:11,962
Felix.

382
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:19,595
Luther may just...
He may be just a... tiny bit raw.

383
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:22,205
Well, raw's workable.

384
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,034
Rotten isn't.

385
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:30,340
Look, Felix,
I don't know what to tell you.

386
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:33,073
- Hey, Felix, iùs traffic, iùs rush hour.
- Yes.

387
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,343
This time every day.

388
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,488
Hey, Luther!

389
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:39,719
There he is.

390
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,756
Felix Reynolds.

391
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:45,257
This tired-ass old man
is gonna be my trainer.

392
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:48,024
Lady, I thought you said
you had a plan.

393
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,840
Let me see your stance.

394
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:05,248
He ain't worth it.

395
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,680
- Oh, well. Next.
- Next?

396
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:12,122
Hey, do you see a line anywhere?
You stop being a brat and apologize.

397
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:14,224
A brat?
Whaùs that supposed to mean?

398
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:16,690
Whatever it takes
to get him back. He is it.

399
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:19,193
Hey, Felix!

400
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,590
Now, Luther has
something to say to you.

401
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,932
- Luther.
- Hey.

402
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:30,768
Look, old man, hold up. No disrespect
intended, but what have you done?

403
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:34,736
Who have you trained? Leùs hear
some actual ring experience.

404
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:37,912
You first.

405
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:44,583
Was I right or what?

406
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:47,019
Yeah, he packs a helluva
punch like you said.

407
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:49,785
Combinations need tightening.
They're all over.

408
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:53,590
But he's strong, got a great feint,
and he's a southpaw like Hagler.

409
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:56,562
He could make some noise
in the middleweight division.

410
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,134
All right. Time, boys.

411
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:02,701
Well, if he can learn
to be a switch hitter,

412
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:05,570
fight from the right-hand stance
as well as the left,

413
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:08,610
- he could surprise some people.
- Left, right, whatever.

414
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:11,873
- It was all right?
- It was better than all right.

415
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:15,575
But you gotta get in shape,
you gotta get in boxing shape, right?

416
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,119
Yeah, your body's strong.
Your mind...

417
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:21,315
...gonna need
a whole lot of discipline.

418
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:23,892
Ain't nothing wrong with my mind.

419
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:27,859
The ring. Get it at 5:00.

420
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,534
Oh, no, I don't get
off of work till 6.

421
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,600
In the morning.

422
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:35,196
Is it cheaper?

423
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:37,841
No. Iùs available.

424
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:41,012
Five o'clock in the morning?
Man, you can forget that.

425
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:43,181
You gotta leave
some room for sleep.

426
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:46,881
Haven't you slept enough, son?

427
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,684
In three years, I pay you 2...
Luther? Listen.

428
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:54,859
Three years, 250 a week,

429
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,324
then I recoup that amount
from your winnings.

430
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:00,123
After that, after we
start making a profit,

431
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:02,630
you take the lion's share,
I get 33 and a third.

432
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:06,067
What you think, Felix?

433
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:08,171
You heard what the lawyer said.

434
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:11,774
She's assuming all the risks.
She's making an investment in you.

435
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:19,680
Well, she ain't got to worry.

436
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:23,183
You bring it all on. I'm gonna squash
whatever you send my way.

437
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:28,586
Lady, thaùs the best I can do.

438
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,886
A grand for all that gold?
Are you nuts?

439
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:32,996
Iùs worth three times
more than that.

440
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:34,961
Worth ain't the way it works.

441
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,960
What about fair?
Does fair work?

442
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:40,765
No?

443
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:42,901
OK.

444
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:45,375
OK, what about this?

445
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:51,214
You give me 1,250,
I throw that in for free. 1,250.

446
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,918
Please don't screw me
beyond that point.

447
00:32:55,754 --> 00:32:56,982
I have kids.

448
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,656
How are you doing?
How the hell you been?

449
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:08,331
How you been?
Hey, Luth, look here.

450
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:12,299
This here is Kevin Keyes,
the best cutman in the business.

451
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:14,472
- Good to meet you.
- How you doing?

452
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:17,506
This is Cedric Mouketendi,
your sparring partner.

453
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:19,870
- Mouke what?
- Mouketendi.

454
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:22,842
Iùs Ugandan.
Call me Rick. Iùs easier.

455
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:30,083
I'm gonna take you out, Africa.

456
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:33,257
Monkey's ass always talks shit.

457
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:38,259
Off the ropes! Off the ropes! Come on,
spin out of there, now! Time! Time.

458
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:39,930
Time.

459
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:43,031
Now you see what the hell
I'm telling you about your jab?

460
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:45,665
Stop street fighting.

461
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:48,332
When he misses,
counterpunch him.

462
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,976
- His rhythm's great.
- It ain't his rhythm I'm worried about.

463
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,769
In a minute,
when I say again.

464
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:57,072
I put him in with a bigger man
so he'd learn how to move.

465
00:33:57,415 --> 00:34:00,441
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Luther!

466
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:02,210
- Luther!
- Hey! Come on!

467
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,046
Come on, now. Come on.

468
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:06,246
Boy, you wanna fight
like a damn hoodlum?

469
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:10,055
I'll toss your black ass
back out on the street!

470
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:13,154
You think I'm playing with you?

471
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:14,855
I ain't playing with you, boy!

472
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:20,993
Hey, Luther, look at me.
Look, look.

473
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:24,505
You can't win if you fight dirty,
do you understand that?

474
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:27,538
- You all right, son?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

475
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:31,179
- He's here to help you.
- Sorry, it won't happen again.

476
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:32,975
Will it?

477
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:35,778
- Won't happen again.
- Say it like we can hear it!

478
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:37,818
It won't happen again!

479
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:53,361
Hey. Hey. I don't want any
threatening or yelling.

480
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:55,038
That is not helping him.

481
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,176
Yeah, well, I'm trying to teach
the boy how not to use his fists.

482
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:03,939
What do you suggest?
Handcuffs?

483
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:25,802
Whatever happened to this dude?
Your uncle Ray-Ray.

484
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:29,299
He died about a year
after that was taken.

485
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:36,343
Hey, I'll start a scrapbook for you
as soon as we get our first fight.

486
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:40,408
So did your dad start
you in boxing?

487
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:42,586
No. Counselor, juvenile hall.

488
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:45,455
In your lap.

489
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,118
And your dad?

490
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:51,656
May he rest in peace.

491
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,233
And your mom?

492
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:59,562
Who the hell knows, man?

493
00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:02,069
Do you have any
brothers and sisters?

494
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:06,742
I got a brother named Michael
in Philly. He's a year older.

495
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:10,973
Stupid-ass Social Services.
They separated us,

496
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:14,811
so we grew up apart. I see him
when I see him. Iùs no big deal.

497
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:18,517
I thought we were
gonna be straight.

498
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:20,155
I'm being straight with you.

499
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:25,428
Who were you beating up today
in the gym? It wasn't Mouketendi.

500
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,757
- I lost my temper.
- You found your temper.

501
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:30,058
What you lost is the rest of you.

502
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:33,396
Look, I go off sometimes, all right?

503
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:36,803
Iùs just how I am.
Iùs not a problem.

504
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:39,772
Yeah? The problem you don't have
already got in your way,

505
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:42,242
and you haven't thrown a punch
in a pro fight.

506
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:47,343
I mean, don't you wanna win, Luther?
I do. I wanna win.

507
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:50,418
You know, you got
all these expectations.

508
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:53,180
What are you gonna do
if this don't work out?

509
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,390
Lùll work out, Luther. You just
have to let yourself trust me.

510
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,690
I am not the enemy.

511
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

512
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,305
Hold up, old man,
I ain't into no S & M stuff.

513
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:20,746
Who do you think you is? Marvelous
Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Robinson?

514
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:23,750
You another young wannabe
fighter, come a dime a dozen,

515
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:26,617
trying to look pretty.
Start with the basics.

516
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:29,986
I'll tie down your right arm
so you can learn to throw a left.

517
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:33,425
You gotta learn to be
balanced on both sides.

518
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,225
Fight somebody that know
how to handle a southpaw,

519
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,958
better be ready to show
him something different.

520
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,832
Now snap out that jab.
Let me see it.

521
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:48,945
5:00's the best I can do.
I need your locker dues.

522
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:51,206
- OK, coach.
- Come get it.

523
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53,475
You know there's
a powder for that.

524
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:55,915
Six-thirty is open.
I want a 6:30.

525
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,214
Yeah, and I want a blowjob
every hour on the hour.

526
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:04,990
Is that why you're acting
like such a dick?

527
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:12,596
All right, dig it in, thaùs right,
dig it in. Now jab him out. Jab him.

528
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:17,870
To the body, to the body,
to the body. Combination.

529
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:26,281
All right, push him off,
push him off, push off.

530
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:28,475
Jump right back on him.

531
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:33,546
Now, Kallen and this amateur monkey
she scraped off the street, Shaw,

532
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,122
you said they were nothing.

533
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,317
- That ain't what I hear.
- It was, Sam.

534
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:39,325
He's been training
with Reynolds.

535
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,931
He's been kicking the shit out of
some guys in the gym.

536
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:46,433
That bitch does not find a fight
in this town, or nowhere near it.

537
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:48,230
Ever. Make it understood.

538
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:51,875
Anybody puts Kallen's boy on a card
puts his own ass out of business.

539
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:56,240
Shaw. Luther Shaw. S-H-A-W.

540
00:38:56,648 --> 00:39:00,209
Just because you never heard
of him, he can't be phenomenal?

541
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:01,909
No, you can't call me back.

542
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,715
No, iùs his manager.
Yeah, I'm a woman. No.

543
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:09,620
I haven't thought about strapping
one on, mister. Have you?

544
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:13,728
Well, I think you have a really
nice voice too.

545
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,899
I do.

546
00:39:17,735 --> 00:39:23,332
But I can't cash those compliments
at a bank. I don't need a date.

547
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:26,299
What I really need
is a fight for my boxer.

548
00:39:26,511 --> 00:39:28,741
Jackie Kallen for Crisco Cohen.

549
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:31,346
No, he does know who I am.

550
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:35,776
<i>Did you hear me?</i>
<i>I've known hlm slnce we were klds.</i>

551
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,888
<i>How many times do I have</i>
<i>to say thls? Are you listenlng?</i>

552
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:43,755
<i>Now put your hands together</i>
<i>and give a warm Buffalo welcome</i>

553
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:46,463
- All right, baby.
- <i>to our trio of preclous gems,</i>

554
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:51,931
<i>Ruby, Emerald and Sapphire.</i>

555
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:07,111
All that plastic.

556
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:10,981
Iùs a wonder she doesn't
melt in that spotlight.

557
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:13,787
Crisco, iùs me, Jackie Kallen.

558
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:15,720
What the hell
are you doing here?

559
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,450
I got a boxer.

560
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:21,187
You drove 200 miles to tell me that?
You couldn't pick up the phone?

561
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:24,095
I did. Four times.

562
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,099
Hey, I'm a businessman.

563
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:28,329
Yours ain't the only number
I gotta call.

564
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:30,336
How's Judy?

565
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:34,978
I have never cheated on her. I just
come to these joints for relaxation.

566
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:38,979
I remember that, Crisco.
How do you think I found you?

567
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:43,279
- It took me a while, but I found you.
- Yeah, well...

568
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:46,019
Great. What are you...?

569
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:49,125
- Well...
- You got a boxer? Good luck.

570
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:51,523
100 men ahead of you
manage for a living.

571
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:54,095
- I never even heard of your guy.
- Luther Shaw.

572
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:56,698
Put him on an undercard.
See what he can do.

573
00:40:58,169 --> 00:41:00,967
Hey. We'll never get a fight
in the Midwest

574
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:03,504
as long as Sam LaRocca
lives and breathes.

575
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:04,936
Too bad.

576
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:08,870
I can't believe you have the nerve
to shirk me off.

577
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,480
My father taught you everything
you'll ever know.

578
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:15,778
Pete Kallen is the only reason
you are where you are today.

579
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:19,315
Pete would spin in his grave
if he could see what you're doing.

580
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:23,418
Look, stick to what you know.
You're a secretary, for chrissake.

581
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:28,189
And you're a married man addicted to
strip joints and God knows what else.

582
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:31,963
I am sure I could find out.

583
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:35,298
- What, are you threatening me now?
- No.

584
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:37,906
I'm thanking you in advance

585
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:41,169
because I know that you're
gonna help me

586
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:44,075
the same way my dad helped you.

587
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:49,446
Yeah, UUF.

588
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:51,622
UUF? What the hell is that?

589
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:56,021
- Ulterior Uterine Fibrosis.
- Oh, UUF.

590
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:58,354
- Iùs a venereal disease.
- No.

591
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:01,565
Iùs a female disease.
There's nothing venereal about it.

592
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:03,357
Iùs still difficult to discuss.

593
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:05,702
Yeah, privates are tough
to talk about.

594
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:07,734
Most women woulÔve
made something up.

595
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:10,537
I'll probably only need
a few days sick leave

596
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:14,233
because the procedure I'm having,
iùs really just minor surgery.

597
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:17,005
Thaùs good. Where is the operation?

598
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:22,010
I'll probably just have it
in my doctor's office downtown.

599
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,688
Well, thaùs a little out of the way,
isn't it?

600
00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:27,089
Unless you mean downtown Buffalo.

601
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:31,989
How long am I in this business?
Long enough.

602
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,891
Nothing goes behind my back.

603
00:42:34,098 --> 00:42:36,760
What did you think?
It wouldn't get back to me?

604
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:39,528
Well, how can I think?
I don't have a brain.

605
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:41,329
You also don't have a job now

606
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:44,372
unless you stop with this
silly extracurricular bullshit.

607
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:47,043
Now, you will stop,
or I'll fire your ass.

608
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:52,312
And you'll lose your pension, your
benefts, everything I let you work for.

609
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:56,945
Trust me, Kallen, you don't want
this kind of kaput.

610
00:42:57,388 --> 00:43:01,256
I'd rather have that kind of kaput
than your kind of stupid.

611
00:43:12,136 --> 00:43:16,197
And remember, use your jab.

612
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:19,275
- Nervous?
- Why I gotta be nervous?

613
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:22,241
Thaùs good. You're nervous.
Use the energy, Luther.

614
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:25,210
This guy's all that stands
in your way of the next guy.

615
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:28,385
You knock him down.
Knock him out.

616
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,119
Oh, gotta get our picture.

617
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:32,956
OK, fighters only.

618
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,784
And get the three of us in
and make this great.

619
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:38,086
OK, just this once.

620
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:50,874
Jab. Jab him. Jab.

621
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:54,772
Stay on him.

622
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:56,742
Don't let him tie you up.

623
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:59,439
- Get rough with him.
- Let him go. Let him go.

624
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:03,415
All right, stick that jab out there.
Hands up, hands up.

625
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:07,484
- You threw a punk shot!
- Got him!

626
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:13,220
One, two, three, four, five, six.

627
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:14,931
Iùs over!

628
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:18,696
Yeah!

629
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:21,537
That was beautiful.
That was beautiful.

630
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:25,175
Nice work on the jab.
Did you see that right hook, Felix?

631
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:27,003
Did you see that? That was great.

632
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:29,270
Yeah, he did all right.

633
00:44:30,514 --> 00:44:32,846
Hold on, hold on. One second.

634
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:37,146
Listen. Whoever it is,
nobody act surprised that we won.

635
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:38,855
OK?

636
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:46,355
- Come on in.
- Hey.

637
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:49,055
Hey. Oh, hey, guys,
this is Crisco Cohen.

638
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:52,236
Oh, hey, my girl's homeboy.
The one that put us on the card.

639
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:53,066
Oh, hey, my girl's homeboy.
The one that put us on the card.

640
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,000
- Jackie said you weren't coming.
- Jackie says things.

641
00:44:56,207 --> 00:45:00,268
I'm a promoter. Promoters show up.
We don't read punches in the paper.

642
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:02,379
- Nice fight. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

643
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,071
- How you doing? Felix Reynolds.
- Sorry, Felix.

644
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:06,806
I didn't know you were back.

645
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:08,986
- Very nice job tonight.
- Thank you.

646
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:12,178
KO. Just like I said.
Better than good.

647
00:45:12,423 --> 00:45:15,256
Listen, Luther, we got to talk
your next fight now.

648
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,222
- Great.
- Here it is.

649
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:21,496
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing?

650
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:25,430
You talk to me. He boxes.
I book.

651
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:31,999
Yeah.

652
00:45:34,412 --> 00:45:37,813
We need local exposure.
You need an A-plus story.

653
00:45:38,015 --> 00:45:41,382
I'm handing you one, exclusively.

654
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:43,382
Iùs not algebra, Gavin.

655
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:47,990
Jackie, you against LaRocca
makes a great, quaint anecdote.

656
00:45:48,192 --> 00:45:50,126
Don't make a mission out of it.

657
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:53,990
So, what, you're trying so hard not
to say is that iùs a man's world?

658
00:45:54,198 --> 00:45:56,063
I don't have to say it.
You know it.

659
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:57,791
You have a love
for the sport...

660
00:45:58,002 --> 00:46:03,531
But I should worship from afar. God
forbid I use anything from the neck up.

661
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:07,840
He has to win a few more fights.

662
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:10,605
He has to climb up the card
before I hot-dog him.

663
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:12,612
- One more fight.
- Whaùs your rush?

664
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:17,117
Well, I got fired. Or maybe I quit.
As if you didn't know.

665
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:21,757
The point is, I can't wait for you to
decide if Luther is newsworthy. He is.

666
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:27,861
Luther Shaw weighs in at...

667
00:46:28,065 --> 00:46:33,935
...159 pounds on the dot.

668
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:37,836
Here you go.

669
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:41,335
They get on the scale thirsty.
They get off even thirstier.

670
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,240
- He's heavier since Buffalo.
- Yeah, he's stronger.

671
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:48,350
Your guy looks pretty good too.
Thank you so much.

672
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,318
Don't drink that.

673
00:46:54,558 --> 00:46:58,119
Don't even smell it. I'm serious.
I'll get you another one.

674
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:18,647
Hey there, Mathias.

675
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:20,248
Hi.

676
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:24,853
Listen, I saw your last fight, and wow.

677
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:31,153
That was one beautiful left hook.
Oh. Oh, oh, sorry.

678
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:36,632
Oh, thanks.

679
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:39,694
I just wanted to say
may the best man win.

680
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:42,134
No hard feelings,
no matter what happens.

681
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:43,806
No.

682
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:53,714
Stay back.

683
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:56,751
He don't like it down there.
He don't like it down there.

684
00:47:57,521 --> 00:47:58,749
Nice jab. Good jab.

685
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:01,321
Luther, go back to the body.

686
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,719
Jump on him, thaùs right.
Get up on him. Hit him hard.

687
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:12,402
Beautiful jab.

688
00:48:12,603 --> 00:48:14,468
Break clean. Come on.

689
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:20,533
You OK, Mathias?

690
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:23,713
- He don't wanna fight no more?
- Turn around and box.

691
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:27,345
Can you continue, Mathias?
Do you want to box?

692
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:29,075
- All right.
- Iùs over.

693
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:38,459
Way to go to the body, huh?
That felt good.

694
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:41,358
- Thaùs the way to work downtown.
- What happened?

695
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:44,500
- Easy, take it easy, easy.
- Get them off. Get them off!

696
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:50,373
Oh, kid.

697
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:01,648
Thanks.

698
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:03,581
OK, well, thaùs my job...

699
00:49:05,422 --> 00:49:07,652
...to see shit coming.

700
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:27,526
Break it up.

701
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:30,272
Neutral corner.

702
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:37,744
Four or five more miles.
Come on, grab my hand.

703
00:50:37,948 --> 00:50:41,611
If you grab my hand, I'm going
to bring you up the hill.

704
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,821
Come on, keep turning.
Get on the inside and turn.

705
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:12,011
Get back. One...

706
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:37,800
- Sounds like things are going great.
- Oh, better than great. Terrific.

707
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:45,547
Iùs over.

708
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:50,552
No.

709
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:53,083
No? Why?

710
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:15,171
All right, no elevator, but the rooms
are huge. Electric's included.

711
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:18,007
The fireplace burns real wood.

712
00:52:18,215 --> 00:52:20,843
Open this thing on the top
before you light a fire.

713
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:24,111
Iùs called a flue. Don't ask me why.
What do you think?

714
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:28,189
Tell you, the place is tight.
I think I like it.

715
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:30,660
You know, I hope I can afford it.

716
00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:33,196
Iùs all about balancing
your checkbook.

717
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:36,195
Did you fill out those bank
applications I gave you?

718
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,697
Oh, I don't know.

719
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:40,062
I don't even remember
what I did with those.

720
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,738
This is the lease agreement
for you to look over.

721
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,570
Iùs the usual, first and last. And I got
you an extension on your tax returns,

722
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:51,407
but get it in next week. Envelopes,
stamps, stationery, all in here.

723
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:53,947
So how come you don't
have any kids?

724
00:52:57,221 --> 00:53:00,657
It just never came up,
the opportunity.

725
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:03,224
It could still, later. I guess.

726
00:53:03,427 --> 00:53:07,830
I think that you would
be dope as a mom.

727
00:53:08,298 --> 00:53:12,291
Oh, thanks. Luther, I think you're
going to want to get renter's insurance.

728
00:53:14,304 --> 00:53:15,771
Yeah.

729
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:18,971
Yeah, sure. Listen, Jackie...

730
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:24,409
Man, this is embarrassing to admit,
but, you know, guys like me...

731
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:27,076
I don't know nothing
about tax forms

732
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:29,980
and lease agreements,
insurance or whatever.

733
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:32,781
Hell, man, I never even voted.

734
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:37,017
In my former line of business,
I dealt with cash.

735
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:41,095
Iùs either cash on the barrel,
or I'm gonna hit you with the barrel.

736
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:44,631
You know, balancing a
checkbook... Forget about it.

737
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:50,538
Luther, you don't need to be ashamed
or embarrassed about anything, OK?

738
00:53:50,741 --> 00:53:53,369
All kinds of people don't know
all kinds of shit.

739
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:57,570
I can really help you with this stuff.
We could fill those forms out togeth...

740
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:01,417
What was that for?

741
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:03,985
For everything.

742
00:54:09,126 --> 00:54:12,061
We're the new kids on the block,
we expect to be picked on,

743
00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:16,455
but we don't run from anybody.
I can't say the same for some people.

744
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,525
By "some people",
do you mean the newly crowned

745
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:22,034
Middleweight World Champion
Pedro Hernandez?

746
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:24,969
Hernandez claims he's hungry
for a worthy opponent.

747
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:27,200
Everybody knows
Luther's that guy.

748
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:30,141
I mean, what, to him,
Luther's the invisible man?

749
00:54:30,347 --> 00:54:32,815
Oh, but I guess iùs hard
to see someone

750
00:54:33,016 --> 00:54:38,613
when you're running away from him,
especially if you're running scared.

751
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:42,425
Now, Pedro Hernandez
won the middleweight crown

752
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:45,561
in devastating fashion
against a great ex-champ.

753
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:48,697
Luther, with only 14 fights,
do you think you can beat him?

754
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:51,767
I can, I could,
and I most defnitely would.

755
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:55,996
I'd probably knock him out
if he didn't faint first, Pedro.

756
00:54:56,773 --> 00:54:59,867
Well, there's only one way to see
how this cliffhanger will end.

757
00:55:00,077 --> 00:55:01,601
Stay tuned to Channel 28.

758
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,372
Don't miss what you can
see here with me.

759
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:07,345
Exclusively. You're our local guy.

760
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:10,042
As for Pedro Hernandez,
if you're watching,

761
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:14,485
this is Gavin Reese, desperately
hoping it wasn't something I said.

762
00:55:14,758 --> 00:55:18,125
You think I can't smell bullshit
when I see it? Kallen's baiting us.

763
00:55:18,328 --> 00:55:21,764
I don't care. I don't care what
you think, because it ain't your rep.

764
00:55:21,965 --> 00:55:24,331
That bitch has people believing
I'm a bitch...

765
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:27,560
And you're whining like one,
and iùs starting to annoy me.

766
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:29,636
I'm not sitting on my
hands no more.

767
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,207
Listen, I'm fighting Shaw.
You set it up.

768
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:36,675
Pedro. Pedro, come here.

769
00:55:42,986 --> 00:55:45,477
Every piece of garbage
I float to the top

770
00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:50,649
gets in his head he can tell
me what to do. Thaùs a mistake.

771
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,960
You fight who I say,
when I say.

772
00:55:55,165 --> 00:55:56,826
Now go away before I get upset.

773
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:11,948
Hey, Jackie. Whaùs up?

774
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:17,308
Brunch. Oh, I didn't know you had a...

775
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:21,287
Renee. There's
just enough for two.

776
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:24,392
- Iùs OK, I already ate.
- Well, here's an idea.

777
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:27,358
You take this. You're not
hungry now, save it for later.

778
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:30,658
- You sure?
- Yeah. I gotta go home anyways.

779
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:33,165
I've got a lot of stuff to do.

780
00:56:37,641 --> 00:56:38,972
What?

781
00:56:39,676 --> 00:56:43,772
Leùs go. Leùs go,
leùs go, leùs go.

782
00:56:54,891 --> 00:56:57,519
- Good evening, sir.
- How are you doing tonight?

783
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,286
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

784
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,563
Luther, listen.

785
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:08,363
All right, now, this is our shot.
Stay calm.

786
00:57:08,572 --> 00:57:10,597
Act natural
and let me handle it.

787
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:13,469
Look, Jackie, look,
I'm down with you, OK?

788
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:16,703
But I only get one day off.
Shit, I coulÔve been kicking it.

789
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:18,244
Kicking it with who, Renee?

790
00:57:20,016 --> 00:57:24,214
Now, look, Luther,
Renee is my friend. I love her.

791
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:27,912
But she has school to finish.
You have everything ahead of you.

792
00:57:28,158 --> 00:57:31,594
The last thing either of you want
is to get in each other's way.

793
00:57:33,663 --> 00:57:37,326
If I want whaùs best for her
and she wants whaùs best for me,

794
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:40,002
how can we get in
each other's way?

795
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,070
You look great in that suit.

796
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:02,682
You know what I'm saying, half-pint?
Let bygones go by.

797
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:04,951
Life's too damn short.
Right, Lou?

798
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:07,023
Name's Luther.

799
00:58:08,598 --> 00:58:10,293
We want a shot at Pedro, Sam.

800
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,661
I know that.

801
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:17,238
Look, why don't you
close your mouth,

802
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,603
drink a drink and relax.

803
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:25,145
I gotta tell you, I like the way
Luther here listens.

804
00:58:25,348 --> 00:58:29,182
A win in Tampa could put him on the
undercard the next time Pedro fights.

805
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:34,153
After that, down the line,
maybe a shot at the title.

806
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:35,855
Of course, that would mean

807
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:39,995
you would start to do some
very serious pro-Pedro press.

808
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,631
Like what an honor it is for you
to be fighting him, shit like that.

809
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:47,668
And the expiration date on shit
like that is fight night.

810
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:49,805
- Of course.
- Sure.

811
00:58:50,006 --> 00:58:51,803
Sounds like we got a deal.

812
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:56,240
So if you'll excuse me,
I gotta go, but I'll be back.

813
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:03,644
I'd watch half-pint if I was you.

814
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,953
Believe me, man,
I already know how she walks.

815
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:09,488
Well, she'll walk all over you.

816
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,562
Why do you think iùs her name on
everybody's lips? Her name, not yours.

817
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:16,322
Oh, that don't bother me, man.

818
00:59:18,902 --> 00:59:21,530
Keep up the good work.
She'll be famous. You'll be...

819
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:25,401
Fine. You understand that?

820
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:27,736
I'll be just fine.

821
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:37,548
Iùs the tenth round, understand?
Don't leave it to the judges.

822
00:59:37,754 --> 00:59:40,154
Go ahead, baby.
Henry Armstrong his ass.

823
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:42,552
All right? Henry Armstrong.
Nonstop punches.

824
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:44,555
OK, guys.

825
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:47,686
Iùs the last round.
Touch them up.

826
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:56,902
Break. Stand back.

827
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:05,414
All right. Let go.
Break. Step back.

828
01:00:11,388 --> 01:00:12,980
Tear him up, Luther,
tear him up.

829
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:17,659
All right, guys, let go.
Step back.

830
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:21,729
Come on, step back.
All right, box.

831
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:36,210
- Stay at him, Luther, stay at him.
- Let go, step back, now, come on.

832
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:38,142
All right.

833
01:00:58,601 --> 01:01:00,330
Yes!

834
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:05,769
Four, five, six.

835
01:01:10,146 --> 01:01:13,775
- Abe Jacobs, <i>Boxlng Monthly</i>.
- Hi, Abe.

836
01:01:14,918 --> 01:01:16,613
You said this fight was important.

837
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:20,017
Now that you've won, can you say
what that means to your career?

838
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:23,851
- Hey, there's nowhere to go but up.
- Actually, that was for Jackie.

839
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:28,619
We've wanted a fight in our own
back yard, and with this win, we can.

840
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:32,596
You're one of the few women having
any success in this, whaùs it take?

841
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:38,339
- Hard work and thick skin.
- A great boxer don't hurt either.

842
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:46,015
<i>USA Today.</i> Jackie, any truth to
the rumor you're posing for <i>Playboy?</i>

843
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:50,346
- I don't know. You think I should?
- Oh, yes, absolutely, absolutely.

844
01:01:50,553 --> 01:01:53,113
Marsha Gary, <i>Detrolt Tlmes</i>.
This is for you, Luther.

845
01:01:53,823 --> 01:01:55,916
You've had a real meteoric rise,

846
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,060
but we all know that sometimes
meteors crash and burn.

847
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:02,163
- Any chance of that happening?
- Are you kidding? No way.

848
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:05,425
- Hey, look, it happens to everybody.
- Eventually.

849
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:12,097
I'm teaching Luther the dictionary.
We haven't gotten to the E's yet.

850
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:20,276
All right, show-and-tell's over.
Come on.

851
01:02:20,483 --> 01:02:23,475
- Can we have one more?
- What are you gonna do after Miami?

852
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,620
- Are you calling me stupid?
- What?

853
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:27,880
Tell them you're
teaching me the alphabet.

854
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:30,992
Come on, Luther, it was a joke.
Thaùs why they laughed.

855
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:34,093
All right, ready?
Picture, press, professional.

856
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:39,733
So you didn't return my phone call
about Luther.

857
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:41,335
- How come?
- I've been busy.

858
01:02:41,538 --> 01:02:45,167
There cannot be another crisis next
week. My schedule is already full.

859
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,639
Don't give me
the talk-show answer, Jackie.

860
01:02:47,844 --> 01:02:50,711
Iùs not a talk-show answer, Renee.

861
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:53,144
I haven't had time
to breathe since Tampa.

862
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:59,984
Tampa. Yeah, I heard about Tampa.

863
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:03,893
We won.
What else did you hear?

864
01:03:04,427 --> 01:03:06,554
- You don't know?
- No.

865
01:03:07,097 --> 01:03:10,760
The press conference. Maybe you
don't realize how you came off.

866
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:12,264
I came off fine.

867
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:14,801
Iùs fine to act like Luther's
schoolteacher?

868
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:17,837
To humiliate him in front of everybody?

869
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:23,339
Press conferences are so out-of-body.
You say what you say.

870
01:03:23,546 --> 01:03:26,538
- Is Luther still bitching about that?
- No, I'm bitching about it.

871
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:30,012
Oh, so you speak for him now?

872
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:33,750
- Please, you hardly know him.
- I know him well enough.

873
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:36,982
Biblically. Don't confuse
that with intimately, Renee.

874
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:41,386
Iùs an entirely different testament.
Thank you.

875
01:03:48,605 --> 01:03:51,233
You enjoy your lunch, Jackie.

876
01:03:58,014 --> 01:04:01,074
Here you go, girls.
Thanks for coming by.

877
01:04:01,284 --> 01:04:04,014
- Hi, whaùs your name?
- Janey.

878
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:07,280
- Hi, Janey. Whaùs your sport?
- Track and field.

879
01:04:07,524 --> 01:04:10,857
- Will you sign my sneakers?
- Sure.

880
01:04:12,095 --> 01:04:15,656
All right, now, listen up, Janey. Here's
some advice from Jackie Kallen.

881
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:19,969
Run with the big dogs.
Don't just sit on the porch and bark.

882
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,538
OK?

883
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:26,474
- Oh, and don't forget your free socks.
- Thank you.

884
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:32,871
Here he is. Paul, come with us and
make sure you have plenty of film.

885
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:36,643
Here's my gym. There's Luther.
He's something.

886
01:04:36,886 --> 01:04:39,878
Iùs 2:00. Aren't you supposed
to be sparring?

887
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,057
Friday's Africa's day off.

888
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:45,986
Oh, thaùs right.

889
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:47,787
- My bad, Africa...
- Wrong!

890
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:51,965
Africa's gone! I've had
a new man for almost a week.

891
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:57,367
Megan Moore. <i>Self</i>magazine.
I'm writing a cover story on Jackie.

892
01:04:57,574 --> 01:05:00,737
This is Paul, staff photographer.

893
01:05:06,816 --> 01:05:10,081
Hey, hey, hey.
Whaùs the matter?

894
01:05:10,286 --> 01:05:12,880
I don't know where you've been.
You're my manager.

895
01:05:13,122 --> 01:05:15,386
The most important fight
of my career's coming.

896
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:17,422
You're off doing
a goddamn talk show.

897
01:05:17,627 --> 01:05:19,527
When's the last time
you were in here?

898
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:23,324
I've been doing publicity.
Publicity for me is exposure for you.

899
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:25,228
- Iùs part of...
- Foot Locker?

900
01:05:25,435 --> 01:05:27,835
Handing out socks ain't got
shit to do with me!

901
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:29,800
OK, OK, I won't do it.

902
01:05:30,006 --> 01:05:32,975
I don't want nosy reporters
in the gym while I work out.

903
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:35,303
All right, I'll send them away.

904
01:05:38,648 --> 01:05:41,446
Look, Luther,
I just want whaùs best for you.

905
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:49,651
I'm kind of nervous about this fight.
Sands ain't nothing to play with.

906
01:05:50,893 --> 01:05:52,884
I need you to pay
better attention to me.

907
01:05:53,563 --> 01:05:57,727
Hey, after this, I am absolutely
all yours until after the fight.

908
01:05:57,934 --> 01:06:00,198
OK? Iùs a deal.

909
01:06:00,336 --> 01:06:03,499
I promise, Luther. OK?

910
01:06:10,313 --> 01:06:12,304
Kallen's Gym.

911
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,850
Yeah, hold on.

912
01:06:16,452 --> 01:06:19,717
Hey, Jackie.
Doug-somebody from HBO.

913
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:34,064
- Hello?
- <i>You know who I am?</i>

914
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:37,865
Doug Doherty.
Of course I know who you are.

915
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:40,299
Who forgets the unforgettable?

916
01:06:42,145 --> 01:06:45,774
Listen, HBO wants pre and post
with Shaw and Sands.

917
01:06:45,982 --> 01:06:47,506
<i>Doable?</i>

918
01:06:48,151 --> 01:06:50,642
Well, there's a reason
iùs not in the contract.

919
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:53,981
We promised our first dance
in Cleveland to a native son.

920
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:56,181
<i>Native? As In local?</i>

921
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:58,894
- You're kidding me.
- <i>Luther knows thls reporter.</i>

922
01:06:59,095 --> 01:07:01,928
- <i>He's comfortable with hlm.</i>
- Jackie, come on.

923
01:07:02,131 --> 01:07:05,464
This is HBO, the major-domo
of boxing, we're talking about.

924
01:07:05,668 --> 01:07:07,727
Not some over-the-air,
commercial network.

925
01:07:07,937 --> 01:07:12,135
<i>Look, Doug, we agreed to a post.</i>
<i>Thaùs the best I can do.</i>

926
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:14,772
<i>Thls local guy has been</i>
<i>too terrific to me.</i>

927
01:07:14,977 --> 01:07:17,104
Can he guarantee
a double-digit rating?

928
01:07:18,348 --> 01:07:22,341
<i>Make you queen for a day?</i>
<i>Longer If Luther wlns?</i>

929
01:07:22,685 --> 01:07:25,085
I'm holding the keys
to the kingdom, Jackie.

930
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:27,654
All you gotta do is reach out
and grab them.

931
01:07:28,758 --> 01:07:30,851
<i>If you're man enough.</i>

932
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:34,194
- <i>Are you man enough, Jackle?</i>
- Thaùs highly sexist.

933
01:07:34,397 --> 01:07:37,025
- And wouldn't you like to know?
- <i>I certalnly would.</i>

934
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:41,466
You know what you need?
It just came to me.

935
01:07:41,738 --> 01:07:43,433
A personal profile.

936
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:47,701
<i>We get some great tape</i>
<i>on fight nlght.</i>

937
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,538
<i>Mlx It up, post and pre.</i>

938
01:07:50,747 --> 01:07:52,442
<i>Thlnk about It, Jackle.</i>

939
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:54,047
<i>You...</i>

940
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,275
<i>... on HBO...</i>

941
01:07:56,819 --> 01:07:59,014
<i>... mano a mano...</i>

942
01:07:59,689 --> 01:08:01,281
<i>... with me.</i>

943
01:08:09,565 --> 01:08:13,160
Iùs a clichÈ, but I'm living proof
dreams do come true.

944
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:16,668
This is the best day, the best time
and really exciting.

945
01:08:16,873 --> 01:08:19,603
Just one step away
from champion of the world.

946
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:23,670
Yeah.

947
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,280
- What about a whoop?
- A whoop?

948
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:29,007
You know, real exciting,
then whoop, like a cheer.

949
01:08:29,218 --> 01:08:31,743
Walk toward us.
Give that a try.

950
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:35,654
This is the best day, the best time
and really exciting.

951
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:41,023
Just one step away
from champion of the world.

952
01:08:42,365 --> 01:08:44,458
Hey, pal, you mind stepping out
of my shot?

953
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,157
Oh, this is your shot?

954
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:50,499
- Hi.
- Low. Very low, Jackie!

955
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:54,032
- Doug, can we take five?
- Who is this?

956
01:08:54,243 --> 01:08:59,875
I need five minutes. I'll meet you at
the dressing room. Outside the room.

957
01:09:02,018 --> 01:09:03,679
- I can explain...
- Oh, really?

958
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,945
Well, go ahead. Explain.

959
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:09,920
Explain to me how my deal
and my exclusive rights to your story

960
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:12,094
wind up in the lap
of that idiot savant?

961
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:15,388
He's a smart idiot, Gavin.
And iùs a long story, so I...

962
01:09:15,598 --> 01:09:17,293
Let me give the abridged version.

963
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,832
Once upon a time,
there was HBO!

964
01:09:21,204 --> 01:09:25,607
You know what, Jackie? For all of your
hustle and bustle and bullshit,

965
01:09:25,808 --> 01:09:30,211
the one thing that you always were
was honorable, in a very real way.

966
01:09:30,413 --> 01:09:34,509
If you said something, you meant it.
And if you didn't say it,

967
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:35,945
well, you meant that too.

968
01:09:36,886 --> 01:09:41,084
Thaùs quite an attribute.
Not a lot of people have that.

969
01:09:41,724 --> 01:09:43,817
And now neither do you.

970
01:09:48,998 --> 01:09:51,831
- Wait, what is the problem?
- A little pre was the deal.

971
01:09:52,034 --> 01:09:55,697
No, pre with me. Post with Luther.
That was the deal, Doug.

972
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:58,066
If it was, iùs not now.

973
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:00,003
We got great stuff
with you, Jackie.

974
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:02,837
But if we don't get Luther,
my audience won't bite.

975
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:05,377
You become the latest waste
of tape.

976
01:10:08,818 --> 01:10:10,046
OK.

977
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:13,151
Thaùs nice, man.

978
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:17,888
Hey, guys. Doug Doherty, HBO,
as if you didn't know.

979
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,858
And this is his crew,
Steven and Nick and Beth.

980
01:10:21,063 --> 01:10:26,467
They're here to observe, not to interact
or interfere, so act natural.

981
01:10:26,669 --> 01:10:29,365
You guys just back up a little bit.
I'll be back.

982
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,467
Get your goddamn hands off of me!
And get them the hell out of here!

983
01:10:36,112 --> 01:10:37,374
HBO.

984
01:10:37,947 --> 01:10:40,040
OK? Please.

985
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:42,240
"Please", shit!
I'll throw them out!

986
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:46,854
No need to be alarmed or take notes.
He's venting. Iùs tactical.

987
01:10:47,089 --> 01:10:51,389
- But we do need the room.
- Everybody out, come on, guys.

988
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:05,506
They weren't gonna stay.

989
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:08,038
All they wanted was ten minutes
of your time.

990
01:11:08,244 --> 01:11:11,941
- I don't have that kind of time!
- You could have made it!

991
01:11:12,515 --> 01:11:16,315
Jesus, I do. I work my ass off
to get you everything you want.

992
01:11:16,519 --> 01:11:18,384
No, everything you want!

993
01:11:19,288 --> 01:11:22,382
You still think you own me?
That I owe you?

994
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:25,660
You do owe me.

995
01:11:25,928 --> 01:11:29,955
Where do you think this world you're
living in came from? It came from me.

996
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:34,397
Putting my life on the line,
having faith in you, Luther.

997
01:11:34,604 --> 01:11:37,437
- Giving you faith in yourself.
- You bitch!

998
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,265
I gave your ass a damn chance!

999
01:11:40,476 --> 01:11:43,673
Everything you did for me,
I did the same goddamn thing for you!

1000
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:46,871
Thaùs how you got the world
you're living in.

1001
01:11:50,052 --> 01:11:52,748
HBO's in the ring after the fight.

1002
01:11:52,989 --> 01:11:55,958
- We are doing that interview.
- No, you do it!

1003
01:11:56,192 --> 01:11:58,422
Our shit is permanently disconnected!

1004
01:11:58,761 --> 01:12:01,924
You stay away from me! And you
stay the hell away from my corner!

1005
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:04,463
Do you understand that English?

1006
01:12:05,267 --> 01:12:08,134
The only English I understand
is in our contract.

1007
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:11,131
You fight for me,
or you don't fight at all.

1008
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:32,519
Break! Break!
Step back!

1009
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:35,691
We're in the middle
of the eighth.

1010
01:12:35,931 --> 01:12:39,560
I don't know whaùs holding Sands up.
He is taking a lot of punishment.

1011
01:12:39,769 --> 01:12:42,329
- Hard shots to the body.
- Take it to him! Get him!

1012
01:12:42,538 --> 01:12:46,133
Shaw's conditioning is just superb.
He really came to fight.

1013
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:51,507
Moving well, crisp combinations.
He's showing me a lot of finesse.

1014
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:55,581
Thaùs it! Thaùs it! Sands is down,
and he's not getting up.

1015
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,414
- Fighùs over!
- Thaùs what I'm talking about.

1016
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:02,954
Thaùs what I'm talking about.

1017
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,986
I got you. Iùs all right, man.

1018
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:11,322
Excuse me, coming through.

1019
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,535
Y'all see that?

1020
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:20,867
You ain't got shit!

1021
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:23,401
You ain't got shit!

1022
01:13:23,846 --> 01:13:25,143
You talking to me, sucker?

1023
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:30,918
- Great fight. Great fight.
- Great fight.

1024
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,088
- Give me that belt!
- Chump!

1025
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:36,085
Come on.

1026
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:39,757
Excuse me. Luther!

1027
01:13:43,032 --> 01:13:45,466
- Good fight, good fight.
- Thanks.

1028
01:13:45,668 --> 01:13:47,602
I'll get him to talk with you.
Luther!

1029
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,705
I'll get him.

1030
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:58,170
- Congratulations, Luther, great fight.
- Luther.

1031
01:13:59,715 --> 01:14:01,182
Luther.

1032
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:04,443
We'll just give Luther a minute
to celebrate with his friends,

1033
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:07,053
and then we're gonna look
at the instant replay.

1034
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:09,953
Anyway, terrific performance
from Luther Shaw.

1035
01:14:10,192 --> 01:14:14,151
Stunning left-cross, right-hook
combination that put Sands down.

1036
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:19,267
Jackie, you've gotta be very, very
happy with his performance tonight.

1037
01:14:28,043 --> 01:14:29,635
Did you read this?

1038
01:14:29,845 --> 01:14:32,313
You're glued to Kallen
for the next 24 months.

1039
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:35,245
I ain't fighting for her
and thaùs all there is to it.

1040
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:38,611
You don't have a choice unless
you choose not to fight at all.

1041
01:14:38,821 --> 01:14:40,948
Buy me out like you did Hernandez.

1042
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:45,592
Hernandez was a bargain. You're
a gamble who won't come cheap.

1043
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:47,695
Half-pint will hold me up like a bank.

1044
01:14:47,897 --> 01:14:51,060
Why the hell do you think I'm here?
I wanna fight for you.

1045
01:14:51,267 --> 01:14:55,067
You're here because you're mad.
Because you made a bad deal.

1046
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:57,899
You throw tantrums in your room
instead of parties.

1047
01:14:58,107 --> 01:15:01,440
I don't minus points for that.
Hell, I like mad on my boxers.

1048
01:15:01,644 --> 01:15:03,669
I don't think you can
hold that thought

1049
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:07,178
or keep your shit together sitting it out
for the next two years.

1050
01:15:13,856 --> 01:15:16,654
The guy with the two left feet
looks good.

1051
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:18,850
I like the one
with the two left eyes.

1052
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:28,095
Yeah, I try to make a champ,
I wind up with a monster.

1053
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:31,000
So screw Luther,
I'll get somebody else the damn belt.

1054
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:32,435
I wouldn't count on that.

1055
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:36,509
Champ material is just like
any other special thing: Rare.

1056
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:43,746
What are you doing for dinner tonight?
My HBO thing's coming on.

1057
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:47,214
I'd appreciate it
if you watched it with me.

1058
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:51,088
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'll watch it with you.

1059
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:55,630
<i>Iùs a cllchÈ, but I'm living proof</i>
<i>dreams do come true.</i>

1060
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:58,663
<i>Just one step away from</i>
<i>champlon of the worid.</i>

1061
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:01,632
<i>Jackle Kallen.</i>
<i>Even If you don't follow boxlng,</i>

1062
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:04,203
<i>chances are you still</i>
<i>recognlze the name.</i>

1063
01:16:04,406 --> 01:16:07,273
<i>Kallen dldn'tjust claw her way</i>
<i>Inslde the boxlng arena,</i>

1064
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:08,966
<i>she captured center ring.</i>

1065
01:16:09,178 --> 01:16:12,170
<i>Kallen's a snake-ln-the-grass</i>
<i>charmer. I gave her a start</i>

1066
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:13,871
<i>and took a lot of heat for It.</i>

1067
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:18,076
<i>She thought she was somethlng</i>
<i>speclal. I dldn't. Still don't.</i>

1068
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:20,152
- <i>Back off, fool.</i>
- <i>No comment.</i>

1069
01:16:20,356 --> 01:16:22,847
<i>Thaùs all, so get the camera</i>
<i>out of my face.</i>

1070
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:24,855
<i>Why do you thlnk</i>
<i>you've done well In,</i>

1071
01:16:25,227 --> 01:16:27,718
<i>for lack of a better term,</i>
<i>a boys' club?</i>

1072
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:30,899
<i>Where women are notoriously</i>
<i>non grata.</i>

1073
01:16:31,934 --> 01:16:36,098
<i>Well, I dldn't Ingratiate myself, Doug.</i>
<i>I went toe-to-toe with the guys.</i>

1074
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:38,068
<i>I made them deal with me.</i>

1075
01:16:38,274 --> 01:16:40,936
<i>They never saw feroclous</i>
<i>In hlgh heels before.</i>

1076
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:46,040
<i>In deallng with you, some of the guys</i>
<i>seem to have got pretty prickly.</i>

1077
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:49,478
<i>Oh, prickly.</i>

1078
01:16:50,686 --> 01:16:52,950
<i>Interesting cholce of words, Doug.</i>

1079
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:57,181
<i>Look, I'm really good at what I do.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna dlsappear</i>

1080
01:16:57,426 --> 01:17:01,192
<i>just because I make some people</i>
<i>uncomfortable. Iùs not gonna happen.</i>

1081
01:17:01,397 --> 01:17:05,493
<i>Just ask her, and she'll qulckly</i>
<i>remlnd you that Luther Shaw,</i>

1082
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:08,829
<i>her mlddlewelght wannabe of</i>

1083
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:12,633
<i>If she weren't where she Is,</i>
<i>whlch Is all over the place,</i>

1084
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:15,139

1085
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:18,780
<i>Her lmpact on boxlng Is Irrefutable,</i>
<i>but Iùs still a man's worid.</i>

1086
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:23,384
<i>A heartless, egocentric,</i>
<i>self-centered boys' club.</i>

1087
01:17:23,886 --> 01:17:27,413
<i>And Jackle Kallen</i>
<i>Is its newest member.</i>

1088
01:17:28,657 --> 01:17:33,117
<i>Funny thlng Is, she'll probably thlnk</i>
<i>that was a compllment.</i>

1089
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:36,763
<i>I'm Doug Doherty for HBO Sports.</i>
<i>Thanks for watchlng.</i>

1090
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:42,367
I'm not like that.

1091
01:17:43,105 --> 01:17:45,938
I mean, come on.
Do you think I'm like that, Felix?

1092
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:51,512
No.

1093
01:17:53,415 --> 01:17:54,677
Not to me.

1094
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:03,114
See you tomorrow.

1095
01:18:50,472 --> 01:18:52,463
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1096
01:18:52,674 --> 01:18:53,936
OK, Joanne.

1097
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:02,012
I'd call, but I was afraid
you wouldn't see me.

1098
01:19:02,217 --> 01:19:04,310
There's a lot of that going around.

1099
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,921
Well, you're right, I wouldn't have.

1100
01:19:08,991 --> 01:19:12,859
But you're here now,
so, what do you want, Jackie?

1101
01:19:14,096 --> 01:19:15,859
Listen, I'm sorry.

1102
01:19:17,599 --> 01:19:21,968
I am, I'm sorry. I knew a million people,
but I only had a couple of friends.

1103
01:19:22,171 --> 01:19:26,335
I grabbed a chance for myself, and
I took a great opportunity from you.

1104
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:30,774
You did. I was counting on it,
and I was counting on you.

1105
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:38,781
You know, for the first time in my life,
people heard what I had to say.

1106
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:43,553
They had to listen
because I was too important to ignore.

1107
01:19:43,792 --> 01:19:49,230
That is not an excuse,
but it is an explanation.

1108
01:19:51,033 --> 01:19:53,024
I thought I could handle it,
had control.

1109
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:56,932
But with guys like Sam LaRocca,
I'm just way overmatched.

1110
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:01,438
Well, you changed
the face of boxing, Jackie.

1111
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:05,413
You cracked some pretty hard cement.

1112
01:20:06,081 --> 01:20:07,878
You can be proud of that.

1113
01:20:09,818 --> 01:20:12,150
Well, I can't be proud
of what I did to Luther.

1114
01:20:12,988 --> 01:20:14,512
We're finished.
I accept that.

1115
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,187
Listen, Gavin.

1116
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:22,861
I don't expect you to forgive me,
but I just don't want you to hate me.

1117
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:42,743
Jackie Kallen for Sam LaRocca.

1118
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:46,219
Sir, Jackie Kallen's here to see you.

1119
01:20:47,589 --> 01:20:49,853
He wants to know what iùs about.

1120
01:20:53,328 --> 01:20:56,058
Just tell him I have something
he wants.

1121
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:08,835
You're here to make this deal?

1122
01:21:09,044 --> 01:21:12,104
Luther deserves a shot at the title.

1123
01:21:12,314 --> 01:21:14,475
Iùs the right thing to do,
so I'm doing it.

1124
01:21:15,817 --> 01:21:19,583
I'm here to negotiate myself so I know
he won't get screwed by you.

1125
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:26,557
Well, I'm happy to amuse you, Sam,
but this is how iùs gonna be.

1126
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:29,230
He gets a shot at Hernandez
within a year.

1127
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:32,526
He wins the title,
he gives you two years.

1128
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:37,131
He loses, close or good,
you give him three additional fights.

1129
01:21:37,339 --> 01:21:43,744
And if he wins those fights,
you guarantee a rematch for the title.

1130
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:48,646
I don't want him that bad.

1131
01:21:50,752 --> 01:21:52,219
Well...

1132
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:56,382
...Luther's the next middleweight
champ. You know it, I know it.

1133
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:59,423
This is one-stop shopping.
Iùs a one-time deal.

1134
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:03,997
I go down the street,
I get a manicure.

1135
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,963
I come back,
the papers are drawn up.

1136
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:11,905
The terms are clear.

1137
01:22:24,786 --> 01:22:27,084
Once this deal is done...

1138
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:29,187
...you're done with Shaw.

1139
01:22:30,525 --> 01:22:31,992
You disappear.

1140
01:22:32,194 --> 01:22:35,288
No wiping his ass
between rounds.

1141
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:37,157
You understand?

1142
01:22:39,067 --> 01:22:41,160
I don't wanna see you.

1143
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:51,408
At last...

1144
01:22:52,481 --> 01:22:53,709
...the feeling is mutual.

1145
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:07,225
Too smart by half.

1146
01:23:07,596 --> 01:23:10,622
I thought the agency was kidding
when they faxed your rÈsumÈ.

1147
01:23:10,832 --> 01:23:12,356
I read it twice just to be sure.

1148
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:16,731
I mean, insurance is about as far away
from boxing as a girl can get.

1149
01:23:16,938 --> 01:23:18,428
I'm counting on it.

1150
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,837
You won't have trouble at Dee-Dee's
desk. Iùs very organized.

1151
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:26,105
And Mr. Sloan doesn't expect much,
just answer his phones, get his coffee,

1152
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:28,806
don't take it personally
if he doesn't talk to you.

1153
01:23:29,017 --> 01:23:31,008
Mr. Sloan never bonds
with the temps.

1154
01:23:33,155 --> 01:23:35,487
OK, Kim, what about these?

1155
01:23:36,258 --> 01:23:38,249
Those are client files.

1156
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,486
Do you think you can put them
in alphabetical order?

1157
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:44,931
Sure. Is there anything else
I should know?

1158
01:23:46,535 --> 01:23:49,436
Dee-Dee would appreciate it
if you water her plant.

1159
01:23:56,845 --> 01:23:58,437
Hello?

1160
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:02,410
Hey, Felix.

1161
01:24:03,785 --> 01:24:05,878
What? Whaùs the problem?

1162
01:24:09,825 --> 01:24:12,760
You're downstairs?
Yeah, OK.

1163
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:16,663
Felix.

1164
01:24:16,865 --> 01:24:19,800
Hey. Whaùs wrong?

1165
01:24:22,137 --> 01:24:24,401
- What?
- LaRocca's putting Luther in the ring

1166
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:27,370
with Hernandez in three weeks.

1167
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:29,834
Thaùs too soon.
Thaùs crazy.

1168
01:24:30,045 --> 01:24:32,513
The guy Pedro was scheduled
to fight,

1169
01:24:32,714 --> 01:24:35,911
they're saying he cracked a rib,
so he's subbing Luther instead.

1170
01:24:36,118 --> 01:24:39,178
- "They're saying"?
- There's nothing wrong with his ribs...

1171
01:24:39,388 --> 01:24:42,482
- I know, Felix.
- Thaùs why I hate this game.

1172
01:24:42,691 --> 01:24:45,489
We wanted a shot at the title.
We wanted an honest shot.

1173
01:24:45,727 --> 01:24:47,627
Why should he give us
an honest shot?

1174
01:24:47,829 --> 01:24:50,889
So he can watch the fighter you found
walk away with the belt?

1175
01:24:51,099 --> 01:24:56,002
I mean, he knows there ain't no way
I can get that boy ready in time.

1176
01:24:57,139 --> 01:24:59,471
What am I supposed to do, huh?

1177
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:04,201
I can't take this to Luther, Jackie.
I can't do it. I can't.

1178
01:25:39,047 --> 01:25:42,244
I wanna see LaRocca.
Did you hear me?

1179
01:25:42,451 --> 01:25:43,941
Did you hear me?

1180
01:25:44,186 --> 01:25:45,551
Mr. LaRocca's in a meeting.

1181
01:25:45,787 --> 01:25:48,779
Look, he can't screw
my fighter like this.

1182
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:52,482
He is setting him up to lose,
goddamn it.

1183
01:25:52,727 --> 01:25:55,525
If he is in a meeting,
you go in there,

1184
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:59,188
and you tell him
to get the hell out right now.

1185
01:25:59,434 --> 01:26:02,562
He said to tell you he's in a meeting
for the rest of your life.

1186
01:26:07,843 --> 01:26:12,212
Ain't no way I can train for Hernandez
in three weeks, Felix.

1187
01:26:13,014 --> 01:26:15,744
Ain't no way.
Whaùs the point?

1188
01:26:16,585 --> 01:26:18,951
Point is, you still got a shot, son.

1189
01:26:19,154 --> 01:26:23,818
It ain't the fairest shot,
but you still gotta take it.

1190
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:27,061
I ain't ready.

1191
01:26:29,264 --> 01:26:33,257
Oh, you think you the first boxer
to have a bad time, huh?

1192
01:26:33,602 --> 01:26:35,934
A raw deal.

1193
01:26:36,671 --> 01:26:40,402
Luther, you gotta take the shot.

1194
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:07,324
Right here.
Y'all put your hands in the air!

1195
01:27:07,569 --> 01:27:09,833
Put your hands in the air!

1196
01:27:11,873 --> 01:27:14,740
Thaùs what we're doing!
Luther Shaw!

1197
01:27:19,247 --> 01:27:22,876
Well, tonight, Luther Shaw's dream
has become bona fide real life.

1198
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:24,711
He's about to face
Pedro Hernandez

1199
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:27,217
for the WBC Middleweight
World Championship.

1200
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:29,582
And he comes into this fight
a big underdog.

1201
01:27:29,824 --> 01:27:32,224
- How do you see it?
- "Underdog" is the word.

1202
01:27:32,427 --> 01:27:34,395
This is a big question mark.
I like Shaw.

1203
01:27:34,629 --> 01:27:36,995
He's got lots of courage, heart,
but he's green.

1204
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:39,962
To put him in the ring,
with only 16 professional matches,

1205
01:27:40,168 --> 01:27:42,432
<i>agalnst Hemandez,</i>
<i>thaùs the decldlng factor.</i>

1206
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:45,003
<i>You know, Hemandez</i>
<i>has made It abundantiy clear</i>

1207
01:27:45,206 --> 01:27:48,573
<i>he has no love lost whatsoever</i>
<i>for young Shaw.</i>

1208
01:27:48,777 --> 01:27:50,210
<i>Here comes Shaw now.</i>

1209
01:27:54,182 --> 01:27:57,015
Luther was not the originally
scheduled opponent tonight.

1210
01:27:57,218 --> 01:27:58,776
That was meant to be
Cecil Young,

1211
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:02,616
who suffered an injury in training,
creating the opening for Shaw.

1212
01:28:24,112 --> 01:28:27,240
<i>Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!</i>

1213
01:29:00,315 --> 01:29:02,442
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pedro Hernandez,

1214
01:29:02,651 --> 01:29:06,246
the WBC Middleweight Champion
of the World, is entering the ring.

1215
01:29:06,454 --> 01:29:08,615
And what a hand
he's getting from the crowd.

1216
01:29:08,823 --> 01:29:11,917
Iùs overwhelming here.
He is lighting this place up.

1217
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,492
This is the one you wanted.
Don't feel him out.

1218
01:29:14,696 --> 01:29:16,960
- Smoke this sucker! Leùs go.
- He's nothing.

1219
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:21,296
- He has got a mission to accomplish.
- Hernandez is a fast starter.

1220
01:29:21,503 --> 01:29:23,198
In the early rounds,
iùs necessary

1221
01:29:23,405 --> 01:29:26,465
for Shaw to use his legs,
stay on the outside, remain elusive.

1222
01:29:26,675 --> 01:29:29,769
- Look at me, man!
- He doesn't want a slugfest early on.

1223
01:29:29,978 --> 01:29:31,502
There's no question about that.

1224
01:29:31,713 --> 01:29:34,375
And we'll see what kind of fight
Hernandez brings too.

1225
01:29:34,582 --> 01:29:36,777
Hernandez, of course,
has tremendous power.

1226
01:29:36,985 --> 01:29:38,976
He's undefeated
in 30 professional bouts.

1227
01:29:39,187 --> 01:29:42,816
And he really brings
a complete package into the ring.

1228
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,856
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the moment we've all been waiting for.

1229
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:51,655
Twelve rounds of boxing

1230
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:58,237
for the WBC Middleweight
Championship of the World.

1231
01:30:00,141 --> 01:30:02,939
And now, for the thousands
in attendance

1232
01:30:03,144 --> 01:30:06,307
and the millions
watching around the world,

1233
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:10,211
leùs get ready to rumble!

1234
01:30:27,936 --> 01:30:30,996
- Iùs sold out.
- Sorry, lady.

1235
01:30:31,506 --> 01:30:32,905
Sold out.

1236
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:37,102
Here is the pride of Cleveland, Ohio.

1237
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:43,907
The undefeated challenger,
Lethal Luther Shaw!

1238
01:30:44,419 --> 01:30:47,820
<i>Luther! Luther! Luther!</i>

1239
01:30:48,523 --> 01:30:50,320
And fighting out of
the red corner...

1240
01:30:51,025 --> 01:30:52,720
Listen to me.

1241
01:30:53,628 --> 01:30:55,118
You stay relaxed.

1242
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:57,798
Keep your hands up and circle him,
you understand?

1243
01:30:57,999 --> 01:31:01,560
All right, keep him turning. Every now
and then, touch him with a jab.

1244
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:03,931
All right? Now, don't worry
about his head.

1245
01:31:04,139 --> 01:31:06,437
Hit him in the chest, shoulders,
arm, anywhere.

1246
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:09,838
Thaùs all I want this first round.
Understand what I'm saying?

1247
01:31:10,211 --> 01:31:16,172
Pedro "El Tigre" Hernandez!

1248
01:31:23,825 --> 01:31:26,157
Referee in charge of the action,
Ray Marsh,

1249
01:31:26,361 --> 01:31:28,761
will give instructions
at ring center.

1250
01:31:29,097 --> 01:31:32,191
Gentlemen, you both had the rules
explained in the dressing room.

1251
01:31:32,534 --> 01:31:34,502
I wanna see a good, clean fight.

1252
01:31:34,903 --> 01:31:39,135
Good luck to the both of you.
Touch gloves. Leùs do it.

1253
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:40,864
You're nothing.

1254
01:31:42,343 --> 01:31:43,571
He looks a little scared.

1255
01:31:43,778 --> 01:31:46,576
Iùs nothing but another fight,
thaùs all it is.

1256
01:31:51,352 --> 01:31:53,183
SeconÔs up!

1257
01:31:53,688 --> 01:31:56,316
Remember, stay relaxed.
Keep your hands up.

1258
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,726
- Come on!
- We're set for round one.

1259
01:31:59,928 --> 01:32:01,862
Hernandez has a look of fury
in his eyes.

1260
01:32:02,096 --> 01:32:03,654
Hernandez comes charging out!

1261
01:32:03,898 --> 01:32:07,265
Oh, a big right hand
lands for Hernandez.

1262
01:32:08,903 --> 01:32:10,962
Come on, Luther.
Punch out, punch out.

1263
01:32:20,014 --> 01:32:22,881
Come on, turn him. Turn him, Luther.
Off the ropes.

1264
01:32:23,518 --> 01:32:26,180
Shaw is taking punch after punch.
Can't throw his own.

1265
01:32:26,588 --> 01:32:29,489
Clearly, Hernandez wants to finish
in the first round.

1266
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:31,190
No feeling-out process here.

1267
01:32:31,392 --> 01:32:33,917
He must be double-parked
because he's in a hearse.

1268
01:32:34,162 --> 01:32:35,527
Yes!

1269
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:39,590
- Oh, look at that.
- An intentional foul.

1270
01:32:39,801 --> 01:32:43,259
- That was very, very, low.
- Referee Ray Marsh is all over him.

1271
01:32:43,471 --> 01:32:45,939
Luther can take up to five minutes
if he wants to.

1272
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:49,303
If Shaw retaliates with the same,
this will be a dirty fight.

1273
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:52,343
Surprisingly, Hernandez is the one
letting his emotions

1274
01:32:52,547 --> 01:32:54,481
- get the better of him.
- Fight clean!

1275
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,515
Punch out and move.
Turn him. Thaùs it.

1276
01:33:02,757 --> 01:33:05,487
Keep that jab in there,
keep that jab in there.

1277
01:33:05,727 --> 01:33:10,096
All night long, all night long, thaùs it!
Keep him missing!

1278
01:33:10,298 --> 01:33:13,665
Shaw's starting to dance...
Oh, Pedro leaps in with a left hook!

1279
01:33:13,868 --> 01:33:17,133
- A huge shot!
- Follows with a right-left combination.

1280
01:33:17,805 --> 01:33:20,467
Oh, a great shot to the jaw!
And you know what?

1281
01:33:25,013 --> 01:33:27,538
Luther's hurt.
He's gotta feel hurt.

1282
01:33:27,749 --> 01:33:29,910
Come on, Luther!
Come on, baby! Come on!

1283
01:33:40,395 --> 01:33:43,193
There's the bell to end round one.
What a furious pace!

1284
01:33:43,398 --> 01:33:45,059
Come on, Ray!
How much rough stuff

1285
01:33:45,266 --> 01:33:48,702
you gonna let him get away with?
I'm gonna turn my boy loose next!

1286
01:33:56,277 --> 01:33:57,801
Gavin!

1287
01:33:59,847 --> 01:34:02,645
I'd pay to see the look
on Kallen's face right now.

1288
01:34:03,151 --> 01:34:05,881
Oh, really. Name your price, Irv.

1289
01:34:06,587 --> 01:34:08,248
What?

1290
01:34:18,666 --> 01:34:20,600
Shit.

1291
01:34:21,402 --> 01:34:22,926
Listen to me, Luther. Listen.

1292
01:34:23,137 --> 01:34:25,435
The only chance you got
of winning this fight,

1293
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,301
you gotta do what I tell you, now.

1294
01:34:31,412 --> 01:34:33,073
He's charging in there
wide open,

1295
01:34:33,281 --> 01:34:35,977
- and you ain't making him pay.
- He's hitting me low.

1296
01:34:36,184 --> 01:34:39,085
Luther, there comes a point
in every boxing match

1297
01:34:39,287 --> 01:34:41,346
where a fighùs gotta start, understand?

1298
01:34:41,689 --> 01:34:44,351
He hits you low, hit him back.
Get rough with him.

1299
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:48,957
Deep breath.

1300
01:34:50,398 --> 01:34:52,628
If you use your skill,
you can beat this boy.

1301
01:34:52,834 --> 01:34:55,428
Just give yourself
some punching room, now.

1302
01:34:55,636 --> 01:34:57,968
Stand up off him
and box the damn man.

1303
01:34:58,172 --> 01:35:00,265
Box him. Use your skill.
Now, come on.

1304
01:35:00,408 --> 01:35:01,705
Get up, get up.

1305
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,438
There's the bell for round two.

1306
01:35:07,648 --> 01:35:10,378
Hernandez applies pressure,
now from behind the jab.

1307
01:35:10,585 --> 01:35:13,918
Somebody's opened a can of
Puerto Rican whup-ass out here.

1308
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:20,454
Hernandez is just mauling
him out there.

1309
01:35:24,165 --> 01:35:27,100
And now Hernandez
is taunting Shaw.

1310
01:35:28,803 --> 01:35:30,998
Come on, Pedro!
Come on! Break!

1311
01:35:31,205 --> 01:35:32,729
What the...?
You know something?

1312
01:35:33,608 --> 01:35:37,066
If he continues this, he's gonna
lose his title on disqualification.

1313
01:35:37,278 --> 01:35:39,940
This could get ugly real fast.
I'm telling you now.

1314
01:35:42,283 --> 01:35:44,513
Pedro Hernandez is
very heavy-handed.

1315
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,516
He has knockout power
and slow fists.

1316
01:35:46,721 --> 01:35:48,484
- Keep them up!
- Yeah, baby!

1317
01:35:48,689 --> 01:35:51,681
Thaùs the way to make a hit!
Thaùs it!

1318
01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:54,895
Go right back at him!

1319
01:35:59,367 --> 01:36:00,595
Get up!

1320
01:36:01,202 --> 01:36:03,170
Go on, there, Pedro!
Neutral corner!

1321
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:06,407
One, two...

1322
01:36:06,607 --> 01:36:08,575
- Get up, come on!
...three!

1323
01:36:08,776 --> 01:36:14,806
- <i>Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!</i>
- Four, five, six...

1324
01:36:15,016 --> 01:36:16,415
- You OK, Luther?
- Yeah.

1325
01:36:16,617 --> 01:36:18,482
- Where are you?
- Cleveland Coliseum.

1326
01:36:18,686 --> 01:36:20,244
- What round is it?
- Second.

1327
01:36:20,455 --> 01:36:23,652
- The towel's coming out.
- I don't think he'll make this round.

1328
01:36:23,891 --> 01:36:26,325
- OK, leùs go.
- Hernandez is a great finisher.

1329
01:36:26,527 --> 01:36:27,926
Shaw's on rubber legs...

1330
01:36:28,129 --> 01:36:30,222
- Hernandez is back at him again!
- Don't.

1331
01:36:30,465 --> 01:36:32,433
Can he go for five rounds
of that?

1332
01:36:32,633 --> 01:36:36,729
Break, break! Come on, guys!
Break, listen to me here!

1333
01:36:44,979 --> 01:36:48,346
Look at that! Shaw comes back
and lands a combination!

1334
01:36:48,549 --> 01:36:51,985
Luther Shaw's doing tremendous
harm. And a big left hand!

1335
01:36:52,186 --> 01:36:53,949
Head-butt.
The head-butt, Dougie!

1336
01:36:54,188 --> 01:36:55,587
Come on, now!
Watch the head.

1337
01:36:58,226 --> 01:36:59,716
- You OK, Luther?
- Yeah.

1338
01:36:59,961 --> 01:37:02,122
OK, leùs go.
Come on!

1339
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:03,922
Want some of this?

1340
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:17,439
Send him back to the ghetto!

1341
01:37:33,094 --> 01:37:35,892
There's the bell to end round two.
An unbelievable rout.

1342
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:39,123
Four fouls from Hernandez,
and no point deducted.

1343
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,699
Who paid for your
vacation break?

1344
01:37:42,336 --> 01:37:46,534
I don't believe this. Jackie Kallen
just entered the ring.

1345
01:37:46,741 --> 01:37:48,641
- What the...?
- Damn it, back him up!

1346
01:37:48,843 --> 01:37:50,970
- Don't let him back you up.
- Let me talk.

1347
01:37:51,179 --> 01:37:54,546
- I'll be damned.
- Luther, I've got one minute.

1348
01:37:55,349 --> 01:38:00,548
I'm sorry. I screwed up.
I screwed up bigtime.

1349
01:38:00,788 --> 01:38:03,518
But you have got to get up.

1350
01:38:03,724 --> 01:38:07,251
You can do this. You can handle it.
You are in shape.

1351
01:38:07,495 --> 01:38:12,523
You can go 12 rounds.
You are a champion, damn it.

1352
01:38:13,734 --> 01:38:16,498
Hernandez is fighting dirty
because he knows

1353
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:19,400
thaùs the only way he can beat you.

1354
01:38:19,607 --> 01:38:20,835
Listen to me. Listen.

1355
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:24,540
You have a chance
to make boxing history tonight.

1356
01:38:25,513 --> 01:38:28,414
You have potential for
that kind of greatness.

1357
01:38:28,616 --> 01:38:30,811
You don't need me.

1358
01:38:31,652 --> 01:38:34,052
You already have it.
Always did.

1359
01:38:34,222 --> 01:38:35,814
Seconds!

1360
01:38:36,324 --> 01:38:37,882
I want you to get in there,

1361
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:41,561
and you knock this guy's ass
off the champ map.

1362
01:38:41,762 --> 01:38:44,458
Come on, Luther. Come on.
Back him up. Back him up.

1363
01:38:46,968 --> 01:38:48,993
Switch up on him.
Go right-handed.

1364
01:38:49,203 --> 01:38:51,262
Nail his ass when he's charging in.

1365
01:38:51,472 --> 01:38:52,905
Now go handle your business.

1366
01:38:53,107 --> 01:38:56,304
The Middleweight Championship
of the World, baby. Come on!

1367
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:58,705
What do you think about
everything tonight?

1368
01:38:58,913 --> 01:39:01,677
As we get set for round three,
Hernandez rushes out!

1369
01:39:01,882 --> 01:39:04,476
He's on fire again!
Shaw is moving better now.

1370
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:07,654
Shaw is moving a little better,
swinging out of the corner.

1371
01:39:07,888 --> 01:39:09,913
Whatever Kallen said to him
woke him up.

1372
01:39:10,124 --> 01:39:13,218
- He's pumping that jab now too.
- Double that jab up, baby!

1373
01:39:13,461 --> 01:39:15,622
What the hell is he waiting for?

1374
01:39:15,863 --> 01:39:17,262
Come on! Come on!

1375
01:39:17,465 --> 01:39:19,626
Come on, fight!
Come on, fight me!

1376
01:39:20,234 --> 01:39:22,896
- Power box his ass!
- Whaùs he waiting for? Come on!

1377
01:39:23,104 --> 01:39:24,901
Shaw is not fighting Pedro's fight.

1378
01:39:25,106 --> 01:39:28,234
Hernandez is physically enraged!

1379
01:39:30,578 --> 01:39:33,012
- Yes!
- A big right hand by Shaw!

1380
01:39:33,214 --> 01:39:35,409
And back comes Hernandez!

1381
01:39:35,616 --> 01:39:39,211
They're throwing nuclear
weapons in there!

1382
01:39:39,453 --> 01:39:41,216
Beautiful shot! Yes!

1383
01:39:43,524 --> 01:39:45,219
Hey, quick! Get out of there!

1384
01:39:47,194 --> 01:39:49,628
That last body shot inside
wobbled Hernandez.

1385
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:51,923
- I think he's cut!
- Break! Come on, guys!

1386
01:39:52,133 --> 01:39:53,361
Break. No holding!

1387
01:39:55,903 --> 01:39:57,700
Hernandez's trying to jab
his way in,

1388
01:39:57,905 --> 01:39:59,736
but there's nothing on those punches!

1389
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:02,170
Break! Break!

1390
01:40:03,277 --> 01:40:07,213
A little bit the tables have turned!
Dancing Shaw is the bully now!

1391
01:40:08,249 --> 01:40:12,015
Switch up on him, Luther!
Take it to him now, Luther!

1392
01:40:14,689 --> 01:40:18,318
Shaw switches from southpaw
and lands a big right hand!

1393
01:40:18,559 --> 01:40:20,686
You got him!
You got him!

1394
01:40:30,037 --> 01:40:31,436
Go!

1395
01:40:31,772 --> 01:40:33,831
- Yes!
- Yes!

1396
01:40:36,777 --> 01:40:38,836
- He's cut, he's cut, he's cut!
- Come on!

1397
01:40:39,046 --> 01:40:40,536
Come on!

1398
01:40:48,222 --> 01:40:49,553
Break! Break!

1399
01:40:49,924 --> 01:40:52,154
- Break clean!
- Let me see, Pedro.

1400
01:40:52,393 --> 01:40:53,621
- Let me see!
- No, no.

1401
01:40:53,828 --> 01:40:55,295
- I'm all right.
- Let me look.

1402
01:40:55,529 --> 01:40:57,224
- Thaùs a bad cut.
- You got him!

1403
01:40:57,431 --> 01:41:00,059
- No, no, no. Come on!
- He's gonna let it continue.

1404
01:41:00,267 --> 01:41:04,226
Hernandez still wants to fight,
but he is doing the same exact move.

1405
01:41:06,574 --> 01:41:10,032
And Hernandez moves!
He's out on his feet!

1406
01:41:11,412 --> 01:41:12,970
Yes!

1407
01:41:14,715 --> 01:41:17,684
- Yes, yes!
- One, two...

1408
01:41:17,885 --> 01:41:20,445
- Get up!
- Get up! Come on!

1409
01:41:20,688 --> 01:41:22,087
Yes!

1410
01:41:31,399 --> 01:41:33,026
Oh, my God!

1411
01:41:34,635 --> 01:41:37,126
I told you! I told you!
I told you!

1412
01:41:59,827 --> 01:42:02,728
<i>Luther! Luther! Luther!</i>

1413
01:42:06,567 --> 01:42:10,435
What? What?

1414
01:42:10,638 --> 01:42:12,162
Leùs take him home!

1415
01:42:21,081 --> 01:42:22,605
Jackie!

1416
01:42:24,885 --> 01:42:28,616
Jackie! Jackie!

1417
01:42:28,856 --> 01:42:31,950
Where she at? Where's Jackie?

1418
01:42:33,027 --> 01:42:34,790
Jackie!

1419
01:42:35,963 --> 01:42:38,761
Jackie! Jackie!

1420
01:42:39,834 --> 01:42:41,461
Jackie!

1421
01:42:44,772 --> 01:42:47,366
<i>Luther! Luther! Luther!</i>

1422
01:43:04,058 --> 01:43:07,357
Hey, Felix. Always good
to see you, my friend.

1423
01:43:08,462 --> 01:43:09,656
And a guest.

1424
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,388
Hey, Felix.

1425
01:45:08,215 --> 01:45:10,843
Put your goddamn hands up!
