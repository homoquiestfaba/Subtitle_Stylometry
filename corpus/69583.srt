1
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:13,820
( rain pattering )

2
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:31,677
TEENAGED GIRL:
I hate teIevision.

3
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:33,009
Gives me headaches.

4
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:34,104
( woman on TV ):
...makes your

5
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:35,011
coIor-treated hair...

6
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:36,242
You know, I heard there's

7
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:38,877
so many magnetic waves traveIing
through the air

8
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:42,286
because of TV and teIephones,
that we're Iosing, Iike

9
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:45,416
ten times as many brain ceIIs
as we're supposed to.

10
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,223
Like, aII the moIecuIes
in our heads are aII unstabIe.

11
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:49,819
AII the companies know
about it

12
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:51,660
but they're not
doing anything about it.

13
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:54,292
It's, Iike, a big conspiracy.

14
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:56,302
( sighing ):
You can pick something.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,860
I don't care.

16
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:59,804
Say heIIo to Iuscious,
fuII bod...

17
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,441
You have any idea
how many eIectro-rays

18
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:06,446
are traveIing
through our head every second?

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,447
I got a better one.

20
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:09,672
Have you heard about
this videotape

21
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:11,479
that kiIIs you
when you watch it?

22
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:13,212
What kind of tape?

23
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:15,483
A tape, a reguIar tape.

24
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:16,853
PeopIe rent it, I don't know.

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,187
You start to pIay it

26
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,955
and it's, Iike,
somebody's nightmare.

27
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:24,430
Then suddenIy,
this woman comes on

28
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:26,728
smiIing at you, right?

29
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:29,964
Seeing you through the screen...

30
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,699
and as soon as
it's over...

31
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,502
your phone rings.

32
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,635
Someone knows
you've watched it

33
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:40,202
and what they say is...

34
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:43,512
''You wiII die
in seven days''

35
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,518
and exactIy seven
days Iater...

36
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,020
Who toId you that?

37
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:49,817
Somebody from Revere.
I don't...

38
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,153
Who toId you?

39
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:53,250
What's your probIem?

40
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:56,490
I've watched it.

41
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,657
( sighing ):
It's a story, Katie.

42
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:00,529
No, me and Josh,
we saw it Iast weekend.

43
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:01,693
I thought you were
with your parents.

44
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:02,861
I wanted to teII you.

45
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,029
You were with
Josh aII weekend?

46
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,697
Some of his friends
got this-this pIace

47
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,706
up in the mountains.

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,731
They were trying
to record a footbaII game.

49
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:10,402
I guess the reception
was so bad...

50
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:11,433
What are you taIking about?

51
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:12,445
Listen to me!

52
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,845
When we pIayed the tape,
the game wasn't there.

53
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:17,611
It was...

54
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,278
What?

55
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,911
Wh-What was it?

56
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:23,946
It was something eIse.

57
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:30,223
We thought it was
some kind of sick joke...

58
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:32,390
and then the phone rang.

59
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,702
It was a week ago...

60
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:40,832
one week ago tonight.

61
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:42,842
( chuckles nervously )

62
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:45,174
You're just trying to scare me.

63
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:50,747
( gagging )

64
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,316
( gagging continuing )

65
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:56,413
Oh, my God, Katie!

66
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:58,150
Are you okay?

67
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,419
Katie... oh, my...

68
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:00,424
( snickering )

69
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,961
You freak!

70
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,964
( laughing ):
You totaIIy feII for it!

71
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:06,659
No.

72
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,137
So... did you guys,
you know, do anything?

73
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:14,368
Like what?

74
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:17,035
Oh, my God, you totaIIy did!

75
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,305
You ho!

76
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:19,573
TeII me now!

77
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:20,739
( phone ringing )

78
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,045
( gasps )

79
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,052
( ticking )

80
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:27,747
( ringing continuing )

81
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:38,991
There reaIIy is a tape?

82
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,193
( ringing continuing )

83
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,267
( ringing continuing )

84
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:02,355
( sighs )

85
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,686
This is so Iame.

86
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:04,849
Wait, don't!

87
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,859
Embrey residence.

88
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:08,884
( pants nervously )

89
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,896
( rain continuing )

90
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:28,043
HeIIo.

91
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:30,049
Hi, Mom.

92
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,050
( sighs angrily )

93
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:32,016
( chuckles )

94
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:33,178
Yeah, that was Becca.

95
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,345
My mom says hi.

96
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,513
She's gIad you're here.

97
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,682
Ask her where she keeps
the Vicodin.

98
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:38,850
( chuckles )

99
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:40,860
Yeah, we're about
to go to sIeep.

100
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:44,022
Okay. Yeah, I wiII.

101
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:48,160
Okay! Okay, yeah, yeah, I wiII.

102
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:51,170
No, I won't.

103
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:52,501
Bye, Mom.

104
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,803
( beeps )

105
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,401
( TVstatic blaring )

106
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,544
( static continuing )

107
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,825
Becca, quit being a bitch.

108
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,356
Where's the remote?

109
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:31,175
( rain continuing )

110
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:34,203
( TVstatic resumes )

111
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,580
( static continues )

112
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:48,593
Becca, quit it!

113
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,220
( static continues )

114
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:55,890
( whimpers )

115
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:59,935
( panting nervously )

116
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:01,167
( sighs )

117
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:04,574
( gasps ) ( eerie rumbling )

118
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:27,333
( panting )

119
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,358
( whimpers softly )

120
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:36,706
( whimpers )
( thump )

121
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:49,488
Becca, can you hear me?

122
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:52,514
( panting )

123
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:58,954
( static hissing )

124
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,966
( hissing continuing )

125
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,175
( breathing nervously )

126
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:29,422
( high-pitched
electronic whine )

127
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:31,953
( static blaring )

128
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:33,995
( rain continuing )

129
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:47,307
( rain pattering )

130
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:48,644
( distant door opens )

131
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,444
WOMAN:
Don't teII me what to write!

132
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,610
That asshoIe's screaming
for my attention

133
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,882
and I'm not going
to give it to him.

134
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,286
I am being objective!

135
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:58,381
Listen, Harvey,
you punctiIious prick

136
00:07:58,424 --> 00:07:59,516
you touch my coIumn

137
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,357
and I'm coming down there
and poking your eye out

138
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:04,955
with that IittIe red penciI
you Iike so much!

139
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,260
Harvey?

140
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:07,960
Shit!

141
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:12,961
Hey...

142
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,304
Hey.

143
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:17,138
Sorry I'm Iate.

144
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:19,145
No worries.

145
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:21,170
I'II wait in the car.

146
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:25,583
Have you got a moment,
Ms. KeIIer?

147
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:26,744
Um, sure.

148
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,253
CaII me RacheI.

149
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:29,880
PIease, sit down.

150
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:32,619
He certainIy is
very independent, isn't he?

151
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,126
Oh, yeah, he sure is.

152
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,355
I never have to teII him
to do anything.

153
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:37,761
WeII, if that's a probIem

154
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,493
you'd be the first teacher
in history to say so.

155
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,501
Ms. KeIIer...

156
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:43,297
RacheI.

157
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,297
I know that Aidan recentIy Iost

158
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:47,431
his cousin...

159
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:48,667
Yes, and I'm doing what I can

160
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,505
to find him some good
daycare. It's just...

161
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:51,874
Oh, no,
that's not what I meant.

162
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,105
By aII means, take your time.

163
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:55,808
I know they were very cIose,
Aidan and his cousin.

164
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,409
Yeah. They spent a few
nights a week together.

165
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:00,783
Did he taIk to you
about her death?

166
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,256
WeII, Iike you said, he's
not the taIkative type.

167
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,952
That doesn't mean
he has nothing to say.

168
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,490
He knows I'm there.

169
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:13,999
Yes, I'm sure he does

170
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:18,299
but he may be expressing himseIf
in... other ways.

171
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:21,068
I'd Iike to show you something.

172
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,751
That's his cousin.

173
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:35,413
That's Katie.

174
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:39,516
Ms. KeIIer...
I'm bothered by these drawings.

175
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:45,355
Listen, I appreciate
your concern

176
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:48,834
but my son Iost his best
friend three nights ago.

177
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:50,802
He's just trying
to deaI with it.

178
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,203
Yes, I understand,
but these pictures...

179
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,831
Are Aidan's way
of working it out...

180
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,636
of expressing himseIf,
Iike you said.

181
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:58,303
( keys jingling )

182
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,835
He'II be okay.

183
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,645
You say she died
three nights ago?

184
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:07,152
Yeah, that's right.

185
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:10,349
Aidan drew these Iast week.

186
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:15,918

187
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,462

188
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:37,274
What?

189
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,016
Nothing.

190
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,096
ShaII we read something?

191
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,654
I'm kind of tired.

192
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:53,825
Okay.

193
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:57,299
Sweet dreams.

194
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:01,897
We don't have enough time.

195
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:07,172
Oh, honey,
I know I've been working a Iot

196
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,271
and I'm sorry

197
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:11,340
but I promise you,
I'm going to make it up to you.

198
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:13,545
I'm not taIking about that.

199
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:16,714
I'm taIking about
time before we die.

200
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,192
You have Iots of time.

201
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:22,694
So, you know when I'm going
to die?

202
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:23,696
No.

203
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,197
No one does

204
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,223
but I know you don't have
to worry about it.

205
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:30,930
Katie knew.

206
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,436
She toId me.

207
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,032
Katie toId you she was going
to die?

208
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,770
She said she didn't
have enough time.

209
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:42,906
Good night, RacheI.

210
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:59,888

213
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,298
Aidan...

214
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:10,369
Goddamn it!

215
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,707
Honey?!

216
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:14,804
Have you seen my bIack dress?

217
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,838
Aidan?

218
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:19,215
Have you seen my bIack...

219
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:21,243
dress?

220
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:25,952
It's a IittIe wrinkIed.

221
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,925
It's fine.

00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:41,371

Kids don't have strokes...

229

unIess they're on drugs.

230
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:47,336
So, then,
why the cIosed coffin?

231
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,579
Oh, Ruthie.

232
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:56,241
I'm so sorry.

233
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:59,581

234
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:07,526
You aII right, Dave?

235
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:12,463
Yeah, I'm fine.

236
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:14,864
How are you?

237
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:26,500
He sIeeps aII day.

238
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:27,843
He doesn't move.

239
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,006
( dish clatters )

240
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:32,074
It's too much for him.

241
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:37,351
It doesn't make
any sense, RacheI.

242
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,984
I spent four hours
on the Internet

243
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,620
and I couIdn't find
one singIe case

244
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:46,063
of a 16-year-oId girI's
heart just stopping.

245
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:49,499
I spoke to three different
doctors and not one of them

246
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:54,097
couId teII me exactIy what
happened to my daughter.

247
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,505
( dish clatters )

248
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,135
( water stops running )

249
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:02,147
She was cIose...
( sniffles ) with you.

250
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,842
And Aidan.

251
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,511
But she confided in you.

252
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:09,020
Yeah, but she never
said anything...

253
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,922
nothing that wouId expIain
what happened.

254
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,017
But you couId find out.

255
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,551
It's what you do, isn't it--

256
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,086
ask questions?

257
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,464
RacheI, pIease.

258
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:29,297
I saw her face.

TEENAGED GIRL:
I knew Becca.

260
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,811
I mean, she was a IittIe
intense, but she wasn't crazy.

261
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,824
They don't put you in booties
and a straightjacket

262
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:47,519
if you're just freaked out.

263
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,757
Something scared the shit
out of her.

264
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:52,024
Hi.

265
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:53,964

266
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,901
So, who's
in the mentaI hospitaI?

Becca...

268
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:00,071
Katie's friend.

269
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,596
Oh, right.
She was the one who was...

270
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,973
There when it happened.

271
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,673
So, what do you think
they were doing up there?

272
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:11,612
Oh, thanks.

273
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:13,710
I remember I was that age.

she was into...?

TEENAGED BOY:
It's not about that.

278
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,429
It's about the tape.

KeIIen, don't even.

280
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,600
What tape?

281
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,659
The one that kiIIs you
when you watch it.

282
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,227
Oh, pIease.

283
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,898
What was on the tape?

284
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,840

Not Katie.

He goes to Revere.

292

It was kind
of a secret.

Pick a card, any card.

Was there a probIem?

It's my niece.

359
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:33,254
on her parents.

I have some photos here.

That's her and her friends.

363

I think they stayed
here a night or so.

364
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,869
Yeah, they were in Cabin 12.

365
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:46,071
They didn't pay.

366
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:49,774
Had a number of compIaints,
about the TV, mainIy.

367

Uh, reception's never good here.

368
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:53,942
That's why we bought

tape pIayers for videos.

370
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:59,020

371
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:01,253
( scoffs )

372
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:02,624
MostIy they're hand-me-downs

373
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:03,821
Ieft by other guests.

374
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:07,491
Anyway, they didn't pay.

375
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,967
And kids Iike that
sometimes don't.

376
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,560
Miss?

377
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,298
You know, I'm kind of tired.

378
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:16,307
I'm thinking I might take a nap
before I drive back.

379
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:17,467
( sniffles )

380
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:19,272
I'II take Cabin 12.

381
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:32,989
Hey.

382
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:37,089
This is your card, right?

383
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,664
That's it.

384
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,994

Seven days.

414
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,958
I'm going to schooI.

00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:20,284
HoId up.

RACHEL:
What do you think?

420
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:45,641
MAN:
WeII, it's a pretty cooI effect.

421
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:50,546
What does this have to do
with the tape?

422
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:53,745
Take my picture.

423
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:58,085
( whirring )

424
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,590
Are you going to Iook at me

425
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,819
at Ieast?

426
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,591
( camera beeps )

427
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,526
This the same camera?

428
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:11,468
No. Scan the rest.

429
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:15,128
( beeping )

430
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:17,004
So, what do you think?

431
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,939
WeII, Iook, I thought you said
this was about a tape.

432
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:26,109
( sighing )

433
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:32,280
I'm thinking maybe
you shouIdn't see it.

434
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:33,450
( chuckling )

435
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,120
No, I shouId know
more about it first.

436
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:38,095
WeII, isn't that why I'm here?

437
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,394
So you can benefit
from my wisdom?

438
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,127
Four kids are dead, Noah.

439
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:45,500
Not from watching a videotape.

440
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,605
( clock ticking )

441
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,268
Come on, show it to me.

442
00:28:55,914 --> 00:29:00,214
( eerie humming and whining )

( door slides open )

452
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,773
RoII credits.

453
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:10,151
That was very student fiIm.

454
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,324
I'm sure it's a Iot...
scarier at night.

455
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,657
( phone ringing )

456
00:30:16,695 --> 00:30:18,959

( ringing continues )

458
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,634
You going to get that?

459
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:33,801
( ringing continues )

460
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:37,673
( ringing stops )

461
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:45,319
So, you been working a Iot?

462
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,655
I'm not tired, Noah.

463
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:48,989
Okay.

464
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:51,325
That tape didn't scare you?

465
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,830
No, not reaIIy. Sorry.

466
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:53,888
Four peopIe are dead.

467
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:56,025
Yeah, but Iike I said,
not from watching...

468
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:57,329
Four peopIe who watched it.

469
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:58,529
Come on, we watched it.

470
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,537
We're hanging.

471
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:01,698
It... takes a week.

472
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,868
Right. Yeah, I'm just
going to go downtown.

473
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,537
I got to pick up some
cameras from this guy

474
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:07,670
and then I got
to prep this thing

475
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:08,906
that I may end up
doing next week.

476
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:10,107
--Noah...
--Hmm?

477
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:12,582
WouId you say that I'm guIIibIe?

478
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:13,709
No.

479
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:14,719
EasiIy rattIed?

480
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:15,777
DefiniteIy not.

481
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,912
I mean, you're a IittIe

482
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:18,582
highIy strung maybe.

483
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:20,716
And you ain't much
of a dresser.

484
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,726
Who made it?

485
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,591
Where'd it come from?

486
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,527
AII right.

487
00:31:26,565 --> 00:31:30,228
Make me a copy.
I'II see what I can do.

488
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:35,895
Thanks.

489
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:40,637
Yeah.

490
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,840
( door closes )

491
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:47,578

492
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:01,387

493
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:02,661
( beep )

494
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:06,325
( phones ringing,
typewriters clacking )

495
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:20,045
( whirring )

496
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,084
( eerie humming and whining )

497
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:43,031
( woman singing softly )

498
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:55,248
( blipping, whirring )

499
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:05,961
* *

500
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,003
( slight static burst )

501
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:26,078
( whirring )

502
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,517
You sure this is a copy?

503
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:32,682
Yeah, why?

504
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,659
The numbers are aII screwed up.

505
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:43,031
The same probIem
got copied, I guess.

506
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:44,425
That's impossibIe.

507
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:46,027
The numbers of
the controI track

508
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,266
they put on the tape
whenever it's recorded

509
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:51,139
which means theoreticaIIy,
there shouIdn't be any images.

510
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:53,542
Hey, Noah, can you pretend
for one minute

511
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:55,808
that I don't read
Video Geek Magazine?

512
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:57,280
Okay, when you record a tape

513
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:59,748
the makeup of the tracks
is Iike a signature

514
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:01,513
for whatever did the recording

515
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:03,919
Iike a camcorder,
VCR, whatever.

516
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:06,617
So the controI track couId
teII us where it came from.

517
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:08,125
But to not have one...

518
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,457
I mean, that's Iike being born
without fingerprints.

519
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:13,259
Then, how did this get recorded?

520
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,198
I don't know.

521
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:18,634
But I'm going to find out.

522
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,262
NOAH:
AII right, take a Iook.

523
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:22,500
You shouId be abIe
to see the camera here

524
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,700
in the refIection.

525
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,801
The angIe's straight
on, but you don't.

526
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,573
Hmm. What's that?

527
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:29,439
It Iooks Iike she's waIking away

528
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:30,448
whoever she is.

529
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:32,245
No, I mean up there at the top.

530
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,442
Oh, no, that's
just the tracking.

531
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:37,079
I can fix that.

532
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:38,111
Whup, sorry.

533
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,123
Wait, go back.

534
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,317
There's something there.

535
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,290
Yeah, you're right.

536
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:43,726
--There's more picture.
--HoId on.

537
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:44,922
I'm going to stretch
the aIignment.

538
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:46,123
Yeah, it's working.

539
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:47,131
Yeah, it won't go any further.

540
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:48,097
Okay, keep going.

541
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:49,100
No, no, no, no, Iet me do it.

542
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:50,123
Wait, it won't go any further.

543
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,260
It won't go any further!
Get...

544
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:52,530
--Let me do it.
--Shit!

545
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,537
Oh...

546
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:55,436
( door opens )

547
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:56,337
Hey, Noah

548
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:57,602
I picked up the cameras.

549
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:58,973
They're in reaIIy good shape.

550
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,443
Did you see the reprints I did

551
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:02,173
of that GuatemaIa stuff?

552
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:04,704
'Cause they came out kind of...

553
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,148
overexposed.

554
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:07,549
You working?

555
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:09,815
This is a friend, RacheI KeIIer.

556
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,446
She writes for the ''P.I.''

557
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,855
RacheI, this is Beth,
my assistant.

558
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:16,224
WeII, I prefer
''partner in crime.''

559
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:17,626
( all chuckling )

560
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,994
She's a journaIism student
at KirkIand, actuaIIy.

561
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:21,555
WeII, I'II stay
out of your way.

562
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,588
I'm not even here.

563
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:27,733
RacheI is researching a story.
It's this video hoax.

564
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:29,672
It's sort of interesting.
So you know video.

565
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:31,538
Why don't you come take a Iook
at this thing with the tracking.

566
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:32,565
RACHEL:
You know, I'm Iate.

567
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,577
I reaIIy shouId go.

568
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:34,873
Yeah, but why are you taking...?

569
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,005
I got to go.

570
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,537
It's good to meet you.

571
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:42,680
( elevator grinding )

572
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,347
So you're taking the tape?

573
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:45,617
I don't want her to see it.

574
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:47,318
Whoa. You don't
want her to see it?

575
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:48,382
What about me
seeing it?

576
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:50,222
You had no probIem
showing it to me.

577
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:52,661
I did have a probIem.

578
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:53,686
You're angry.

579
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:54,857
I'm not angry.

580
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,560
Oh, no? What
are you then?

581
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:58,159
In a hurry.

582
00:35:58,203 --> 00:35:59,363
( scoffs )

583
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:02,032
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm
not going to get aII worked up

584
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,438
over some high schooI rumor.

585
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:08,171
What are you thinking?

586
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,408
I'm thinking this is
the part where I say

587
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,779
''You're a fIake,
never finishes anything.''

588
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:14,876
Then you say
I'm ''an obsessive bitch.

589
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,352
Needs to Iighten up.''

590
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:17,547
Then I storm out

591
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,955
aII pissed off, kicking myseIf
for ever thinking

592
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,424
that you couId just...

593
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,723
grow up.

594
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:30,729
So, why don't we just
cut to that part right now

595
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:33,066
and save ourseIves
a Iot of grief?

596
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:37,134
AII right.

597
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:39,234
Bye.

598
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:02,225

599
00:37:06,804 --> 00:37:08,328
Watch out, missy.

600
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:10,364
Bad Iuck.
You don't need that.

601
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:15,441

clicking )

602
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:27,482

605
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:42,305
Becca?

606
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,104
Becca.

607
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:47,338
We're aImost there.

608

HOST ( on TV ):
Summer, actuaIIy.

609
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,514
So circIe gets that square.

610
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:53,483
We take a break,
whiIe you check this out.

611
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:55,748
This is how you can be part...

612

RACHEL:
Do you remember anything

613
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,083
about that night...

614
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:01,182
that night with Katie?

615
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:06,656
Do you remember...

616
00:38:06,698 --> 00:38:08,689
how she died?

617
00:38:11,135 --> 00:38:13,797
Becca?

618
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:26,215
She toId you about a videotape,
didn't she?

619
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,481
She was afraid, wasn't she?

620
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:37,426
Something was happening to her.

621
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:39,930
Becca...

622
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:42,990
how did she die?

623
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,763
PIease.

624
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:46,929

628
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:02,484
Who wiII show me?

629
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,614
Not now.

630

00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:22,397
WOMAN:
Yeah, weII, your home VCRs

632
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,702
wiII give you a tracking window

633
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,072
but they won't
Iet you stretch it.

634
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:27,543
There's no point, reaIIy, unIess
you're taIking restoration.

635
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:28,772
Archives wiII come in here

with these crummy oId tapes
sometimes.

637
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,776
Tracks totaIIy shot--
servos can't Iine them up.

638
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:34,341
But the big box here's
a warhorse.

TotaIIy anaIog.

640
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:37,513
She'II read to the very edge
of your tape.

641
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:40,353
Just don't force her or
she'II get pissy with you.

642
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:43,622
Your tracking, your monitor,
your printer, if you need it.

643
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:46,061
So, uh...

644
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:48,531
what are we watching,
home movies or something?

645
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:51,967
I'd reaIIy
rather watch it aIone.

646
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:53,732

647

00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:39,059
This isn't the best time for me.

739
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:40,070
( coughing )

740
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:42,402
RacheI? RacheI, are you there?

741
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:44,407
HoId on a sec...
Sorry.

742
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:46,807
( coughing and gasping )

743
00:47:46,844 --> 00:47:48,573
RacheI?

744
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:50,102
Is this about Katie?

745
00:47:50,214 --> 00:47:53,206
( retching )

746
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:05,923
( retching and gasping )

747
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,002
Ruthie...

748
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:22,406
( eerie rumbling )

749
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,680
( gasping )

750
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:40,920
Aidan?

751
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:44,866
( eerie rumbling )

752
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:58,474
( unearthly screeching )

753
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:02,518
( gasping )

754
00:49:11,562 --> 00:49:14,190
( panting )

755
00:49:20,337 --> 00:49:22,635
( panting slows )

756
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:32,147
( rainfall outside )

757
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:39,956
( deep rumbling )

758
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:47,791
( grunts )

759
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:53,199
No!

760
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:57,264
( static hissing )

761
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:03,910
Why, baby, why? Why?!

762
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:05,744
I couIdn't sIeep.

763
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:14,180
Who is she, RacheI?

764
00:50:14,224 --> 00:50:16,215
( phone ringing )

765
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:27,736
( ringing stops )

766
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,432
( gasping )

767
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:30,940
( ringing )

768
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:32,839
Leave him aIone!

769
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:34,241
NOAH ( on phone ):
RacheI?

770
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:36,007
( sobs )

771
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:39,979
Noah...

772
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:41,450
L-Listen to me. R-RacheI...

773
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:43,453
I need to taIk to you, okay?

774
00:50:43,487 --> 00:50:45,546
I...

775
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:50,292
I beIieve you.

776
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:53,524
RacheI, you there?

777
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:54,963
( quiet sobbing )

778
00:50:54,998 --> 00:50:58,161
He... He watched the tape.

779
00:50:58,202 --> 00:51:01,137
Who? Who watched it?

780
00:51:01,171 --> 00:51:03,162
( sobs )

781
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,802
Our son.

782
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:14,147
( unearthly whistling )

783
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,028
( rain pattering )

784
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:33,432
You took my picture.

785
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:40,606
I've seen you.

786
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:44,341
When I'm in the yard at schooI.

787
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:46,406
You're there.

788
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,744
You wish I was around more?

789
00:51:49,787 --> 00:51:52,585
No.

790
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:54,352
Do you want to be around more?

791
00:51:55,726 --> 00:51:57,489
RacheI and I were...

792
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,462
Young.

793
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:01,487
Mom's toId me that story.

794
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:07,894
The thing is, I...

795
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:10,532
I don't think
I'd make a good father.

796
00:52:12,443 --> 00:52:15,378
Maybe it was because
my own was...

797
00:52:15,446 --> 00:52:18,609
such a... disappointment.

798
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:30,149
Thing is, I don't want
anyone eIse to do it, either.

799
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,794
Be your father.

800
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,391
It's a conundrum.

801
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:39,425
( laughs )

802
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:43,539
Yeah, it is.

803
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:47,066
( paper crackling )

804
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:58,686
( pages turning )

805
00:53:08,098 --> 00:53:11,329
( rain falling )

806
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:20,701
( door opening )

807
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:23,440
Time to go, mister.

808
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,640
I'm not finished.

809
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,712
Noah said to make one for you.

810
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:38,818
RACHEL:
You could almost draw

811
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:41,160
a line through her life.

812
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:43,723
On one side,
there's this happy woman

813
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:47,464
who spends her time with her
husband, riding horses

814
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:51,099
everything sheltered,
protected and comfortable.

815
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:55,703
Her face, there's... light,
there's pride.

816
00:53:55,746 --> 00:53:57,941
And then, one day,
something happens

817
00:53:57,981 --> 00:54:00,415
and she takes
this hard corner

818
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,475
and the light... goes out

819
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:05,613
and then she ends up
at Eola County Psychiatric

820
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:07,624
all alone.

821
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:09,649
NOAH:
What happened to her?.

822
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:11,661
l don't know yet

823
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:14,323
but l think it has something
to do with the horses.

824
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:16,764
lt think we should go
to the island together.

825
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,324
lt's Tuesday, Noah.

826
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:20,427
l only have one day left.

827
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,903
l need you to go to the
hospital

828
00:54:21,939 --> 00:54:23,839
and find out as much
as you can about Anna.

829
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:27,867
The images on the tape
are Ieading us somewhere.

830
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:29,435
Katie saw them aII, too.

831
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:33,074
I think... before you die

832
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:35,107
you see the ring.

833
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:48,225
( wipers clacking )

834
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:49,323
Shit!

835
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:52,164
Hey, Rach! Wait!

836
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:03,836
( rain splattering )

837
00:55:07,184 --> 00:55:13,214
( bell clanging )

838
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,359
( ferry engine roaring )

839
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:27,627

840
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,938
* *

841
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,458
A daughter?

842
00:55:58,468 --> 00:56:00,231
* *

843
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,272
( ferry engines
rumbling smoothly )

844
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:24,259
( footsteps approaching )

845
00:56:26,263 --> 00:56:27,628
( chuckles softly )

846
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:29,631
Hey, you.

847
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:31,360
( nickers )

848
00:56:31,401 --> 00:56:33,562
Ooh.

849
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:36,765
It's okay.

850
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:38,399
I'm not going to hurt you.

851
00:56:39,576 --> 00:56:40,543
Yeah.

852
00:56:40,577 --> 00:56:42,044
Easy, boy.

853
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,944
( nickering )

854
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:48,008
That's it.

855
00:56:48,051 --> 00:56:51,646
( whinnying nervously )

856
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:55,158
Hey, boy.

857
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:56,659
I'm not going to hurt you.

858
00:56:56,693 --> 00:56:59,093
( whinnying frantically )

859
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:04,500
It's okay. CaIm down.

860
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:06,365
( whinnying )

861
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:09,472
Somebody!

862

864
00:57:19,182 --> 00:57:20,308
Jesus Christ!

866

( grunting )

868
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,427
Daddy, my horse!

869
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:35,258
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

870
00:57:35,298 --> 00:57:36,322
( horse whinnying )

871
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:37,458
He's going out!

872
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:38,934
Over here!

873
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:40,800
Whoa! Whoa! Easy!

874
00:57:40,837 --> 00:57:42,031
Come on.

875
00:57:43,006 --> 00:57:44,564
( snorting )

876
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:48,072

( whinnying )

878
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:51,706
No, down! No!

879
00:57:51,815 --> 00:57:53,214
( grunting and gasping )

880
00:57:56,553 --> 00:57:57,645

( speaking indistinctly )

892
00:58:49,272 --> 00:58:50,603
I need to see the records

893
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,369
for a patient named Anna Morgan.

894
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:54,877
Are you a reIative?

895
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:56,208
WeII, no.

896
00:58:56,246 --> 00:58:57,372
I'm sorry, sir.

897
00:58:57,414 --> 00:58:59,211
We're a mentaI heaIth faciIity.

898
00:58:59,249 --> 00:59:00,546
Our records are private.

899
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:02,381
WeII, she's been dead 24 years.

900
00:59:02,419 --> 00:59:03,909
I don't think she'II mind.

901
00:59:03,954 --> 00:59:05,251
I'm sorry.

902
00:59:05,288 --> 00:59:07,188
It's impossibIe.

903
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:09,215
Look...

904
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:11,420
I've seen them before.

905
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:12,985
I've been up there.

906
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:14,087
MAN:
Nice try.

907
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,758
The record rooms
are downstairs, guy.

908
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,791
( chuckles softly )

909
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:21,337
You win.

911
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,232

( hammering continuing )

926
01:01:59,496 --> 01:02:00,793
Excuse me, Mr. Morgan.

927
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:04,190
I was wondering if you'd have
a moment to speak with me.

928
01:02:04,234 --> 01:02:05,258
My name's RacheI KeIIer.

929
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:06,859
I'm a writer with
the ''SeattIe P.I.''

930
01:02:06,903 --> 01:02:08,837
You want to know
about the horses.

931
01:02:11,408 --> 01:02:12,500
I didn't mean to...

932
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:15,375
It's just I wasn't abIe to
find a number to reach you.

933
01:02:15,412 --> 01:02:18,381
Every now and then,
a writer comes aIong...

934
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:20,246
heard about what happened.

935
01:02:20,283 --> 01:02:23,719
What's Ieft to write about,
though, I don't know.

936
01:02:23,753 --> 01:02:26,381
I was hoping you had
just a few minutes.

937
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:30,382
WeII, work never ends
around here, reaIIy...

938
01:02:30,427 --> 01:02:32,657
but I guess I got a few.

939
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:35,823
So, what is it
you're writing, miss?

940
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:37,458
About horses in generaI

941
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,694
or just those that go strange?

942
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:41,363
I read you had
to put so many down.

943
01:02:41,404 --> 01:02:43,372
Most put themseIves down.

944
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:44,703
They drowned.

945
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:45,867
How'd they get out?

946
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:47,206
They just broke

947
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:50,269
through the fences
and ran to the shore.

948
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:51,871
So, they went crazy?

949
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:54,008
It wouId seem so, yes...

950
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:57,382
or maybe they just sense things
before we do.

951
01:02:59,456 --> 01:03:02,448
So, where are your horses now?

952
01:03:04,461 --> 01:03:06,019
I don't breed anymore.

953
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:08,394
I guess you wouIdn't...

954
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:10,831
not after what happened.

955
01:03:10,867 --> 01:03:15,327
That must've been hard...
on both of you...

956
01:03:15,371 --> 01:03:18,397
you and your wife.

957
01:03:18,441 --> 01:03:20,909
( thunder rumbling )

958
01:03:20,944 --> 01:03:25,574
I'm sorry, miss,
what's your name again?

959
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:26,980
RacheI.

960
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:28,483
WeII, RacheI...

961
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:31,851
you want to teII me what's
reaIIy on your mind?

962
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:37,325
Do you know what this is?

963
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:41,820
I think it's a message...

964
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:43,856
from your wife.

965
01:03:45,635 --> 01:03:46,829
Anna's on this tape.

966
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,531
She's right there in that room.

967
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:52,007
You can see the Iighthouse,
the horses...

968
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,637
Where'd you get that?

969
01:03:55,678 --> 01:03:57,543
SheIter Mountain Inn.

970
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:01,447
Is that the onIy one?

971
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,114
I made a copy.

972
01:04:08,258 --> 01:04:09,919
( sighs )

973
01:04:12,395 --> 01:04:16,354
I've got a Iot of work
to do today...

974
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:18,390
a Iot of acres out there.

975
01:04:18,434 --> 01:04:21,699
Minute I think I'm done
with one thing...

976
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,669
...another thing needs fixing.

977
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,940
You don't want to see this tape?

978
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:31,674
You're not even curious?

979
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:33,341
Curious?

980
01:04:33,383 --> 01:04:35,715
No. I don't think so.

981
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,218
Mr. Morgan...

982
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:40,415
I can't heIp you.

983
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:44,119
Where's your daughter?

984
01:04:44,227 --> 01:04:45,888
Maybe she couId heIp...

985
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:48,227
I don't have a daughter.

986
01:04:48,264 --> 01:04:49,492
Excuse me?

987
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:51,591
What is it with reporters?

988
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:53,966
You take one person's tragedy

989
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:57,131
and force the worId
to experience it...

990
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,539
spread it Iike sickness.

991
01:05:00,577 --> 01:05:01,635
Mr. Morgan...

992
01:05:01,678 --> 01:05:03,009
TeII me, miss...

993
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:05,606
what is it you think you know?

994
01:05:07,717 --> 01:05:10,311
Then Ieave it aIone.

995
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:16,447
( slams )

996
01:05:16,492 --> 01:05:18,790
( sighs )

997
01:05:23,299 --> 01:05:24,926
( sighs )

998
01:05:24,968 --> 01:05:27,960
* *

999
01:05:37,981 --> 01:05:40,176

1000
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:42,751
( rope creaking )

1001
01:05:53,263 --> 01:05:56,198
* *

1002
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:08,807

1003
01:06:15,018 --> 01:06:17,680
( banging )

1004
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:26,487
( whispering ):
Anna.

1005
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:33,632
''Anna Morgan's...

1006
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,230
...HaIIucinations''?

1007
01:06:36,339 --> 01:06:38,170
What's wrong with you?

1008
01:06:42,812 --> 01:06:45,110
'''65, conceived.''

1009
01:06:45,148 --> 01:06:46,547
'''65, miscarriage.''

1010
01:06:46,582 --> 01:06:48,106
'''66, conceived.''

1011
01:06:48,151 --> 01:06:49,880
'''66, miscarriage.''

1012
01:06:49,919 --> 01:06:52,752
Christ, she wouIdn't give up.

1013
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:59,117
( file falls on floor )

1014
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:10,537
* *

1015
01:07:23,686 --> 01:07:28,589
''Sessions terminated...
at father's request.

1016
01:07:28,624 --> 01:07:32,526
See Video Record S-M-0-1-5.''

1017
01:07:32,562 --> 01:07:34,689
( phone ringing )

1018
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:37,723
( grinding furiously )

1019
01:07:41,437 --> 01:07:43,405
RUTH:
Aidan?

1020
01:07:43,439 --> 01:07:45,430
Aidan, it's your mom.

1021
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:55,417
( Aidan over telephone ):
Hi, Mom.

1022
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:57,578
Honey, the house you drew
for me...

1023
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:58,587
Uh-huh?

1024
01:07:58,621 --> 01:08:00,020
...where did you see it?

1025
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:01,717
Did you see it in your head?

1026
01:08:01,758 --> 01:08:03,316
Is that why you drew it?

1027
01:08:03,426 --> 01:08:04,757
In my head?

1028
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:07,592
Aidan... why did you draw
that house?

1029
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:09,325
Because she toId me to.

1030
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:10,626
Who?

1031
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,829
Who toId you to?

1032
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,531
The IittIe girI.

1033
01:08:18,975 --> 01:08:22,467
She taIks to you?

1034
01:08:22,512 --> 01:08:24,480
No.

1035
01:08:24,514 --> 01:08:26,482
She shows me things.

1036
01:08:26,516 --> 01:08:29,110
Did she show you the horses?

1037
01:08:29,152 --> 01:08:32,280
She doesn't Iike it in the barn.

1038
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:35,484
The horses keep her up at night.

1039
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:39,120
So, she stiII Iives there?

1040
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:43,631
No.

1041
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:46,863
( whispering ):
She Iives in a dark pIace now.

1042
01:08:55,278 --> 01:08:56,768
( clock ticking )

1043
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:06,786
( puzzle pieces clicking )

1044
01:09:06,823 --> 01:09:08,791
( ticking loudly )

1045
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:10,850
( puzzle pieces clicking )

1046
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:13,120
( door opening )

1047
01:09:13,162 --> 01:09:14,629
WOMAN:
You're getting a IittIe oId

1048
01:09:14,664 --> 01:09:16,393
to be crabbing out there, CaI.

1049
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:18,593
Your body's about outIived
its warranty, you know.

1050
01:09:18,634 --> 01:09:20,602
You ain't exactIy
the catch of the day.

1051
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:23,366
Oh... Iet's see you
catch one better!

1052
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:24,373
CAL:
Yeah...

1053
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:26,375
Good afternoon.

1054
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:28,377
I'm Dr. Grasnik.

1055
01:09:28,411 --> 01:09:30,379
I think he was here before me.

1056
01:09:30,413 --> 01:09:33,382
Darby? Darby's aIways here.

1057
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:35,384
Aren't you, Darby?

1058
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:37,010
He's my son's boy.

1059
01:09:37,053 --> 01:09:39,715
Come over on the ferry, did you?

1060
01:09:39,755 --> 01:09:41,222
Yes.

1061
01:09:41,257 --> 01:09:44,920
Um... have you Iived here Iong?

1062
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:45,928
Born and raised.

1063
01:09:45,962 --> 01:09:47,554
OnIy doctor on the isIand.

1064
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:51,226
Then you know the Morgans
and their daughter.

1065
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:53,792
Do you know
their daughter?

1066
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:56,396
Do you know their daughter?

1067
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:58,066
( clock ticking continuing )

1068
01:09:58,107 --> 01:09:59,404
What's this about?

1069
01:09:59,442 --> 01:10:01,069
Look, I'm sorry.

1070
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:03,442
I-I don't know how to say this

1071
01:10:03,513 --> 01:10:06,971
but I'm seeing things
in my head-- images--

1072
01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:08,984
and so is my son.

1073
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:12,613
My son, that...
that's why I'm here

1074
01:10:12,655 --> 01:10:16,455
and somehow,
I don't know how, but...

1075
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:19,256
it's because of that girI.

1076
01:10:22,632 --> 01:10:26,159
Haven't heard anybody say that
in a Iong time.

1077
01:10:27,803 --> 01:10:29,100
( squeaking loudly )

1078
01:10:29,138 --> 01:10:31,572
She wanted a chiId
more than anything.

1079
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:32,733
Poor Anna.

1080
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:34,402
They tried hard for years

1081
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:37,003
but sometimes
it's just not meant to be.

1082
01:10:37,046 --> 01:10:39,071
Then one winter, they went away.

1083
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:40,377
When they came back

1084
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:42,384
it was with Samara.

1085
01:10:42,418 --> 01:10:44,386
Adopted, they said.

1086
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,354
Never did say from where.

1087
01:10:46,389 --> 01:10:49,790
Said the mother had died
of compIications.

1088
01:10:49,825 --> 01:10:52,589
But they had their baby,
they had their horses--

1089
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:54,619
everything was fine...

1090
01:10:54,664 --> 01:10:57,030
tiII Anna started coming
to see me.

1091
01:10:57,066 --> 01:10:59,261
Said she was
suffering visions...

1092
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:00,599
seeing things...

1093
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:02,604
horribIe things...

1094
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:05,402
Iike they'd been burned
inside her...

1095
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,409
and it onIy happened

1096
01:11:07,443 --> 01:11:08,740
around Samara...

1097
01:11:08,778 --> 01:11:11,110
that the girI put them there.

1098
01:11:11,147 --> 01:11:13,115
( merry-go-round
squeaking continues )

1099
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:16,118
Were you Samara's
doctor, too?

1100
01:11:16,152 --> 01:11:18,916
Was there anything wrong
with her?

1101
01:11:18,955 --> 01:11:20,422
You mean medicaIIy?

1102
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:22,515
I mean whatever you mean.

1103
01:11:22,592 --> 01:11:24,924
( squeaking continuing )

1104
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:28,419
When Darby, there, was born...

1105
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:33,401
we knew something wasn't right
with him...

1106
01:11:33,436 --> 01:11:36,462
but we Ioved him anyway.

1107
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:38,837
Takes work, you know.

1108
01:11:38,874 --> 01:11:41,638
Some peopIe have Iimits.

1109
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,512
So, what happened to her?

1110
01:11:46,549 --> 01:11:49,245
I referred them
to EoIa Psychiatric

1111
01:11:49,285 --> 01:11:50,547
on the mainIand.

1112
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:52,645
I assume she's stiII there.

1113
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:55,156
You don't know?

1114
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:58,649
How can you not know?

1115
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:01,162
We've been through...

1116
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:04,325
a Iot of hard years out here...

1117
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:06,301
mean winters...

1118
01:12:06,335 --> 01:12:09,463
smaII hauIs, no fish...

1119
01:12:09,505 --> 01:12:12,941
and that was Iong
before the horses.

1120
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:15,034
See, when you Iive on an isIand

1121
01:12:15,077 --> 01:12:17,773
you catch a coId,
it's everybody's coId.

1122
01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:18,939
No offense, ma'am

1123
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:21,176
but what the heII
does that mean?

1124
01:12:21,217 --> 01:12:24,448
It means ever since
that girI's been gone

1125
01:12:24,487 --> 01:12:26,455
things have been better.

1126
01:12:26,489 --> 01:12:29,322
( squeaking continuing )

1127
01:12:29,358 --> 01:12:30,825
MAN:
1978.

1128
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,351
Man, we're reaIIy going
back in time, here.

1129
01:12:33,396 --> 01:12:35,864
Yeah, the Iady at reception said
it shouId stiII be here.

1130
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:38,992
ShouId be. You say you're
the patient's father, right?

1131
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:40,900
Yep. Richard Morgan, that's me.

1132
01:12:40,936 --> 01:12:42,335
What is your secret?

1133
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:44,202
Diet and exercise, man.

1134
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,207
No shit!

1135
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,539
Yeah, that's aII it takes.

1136
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:49,908
You know, I'm
not an idiot.

1137
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:52,413
You try and waIk out
of here with my fiIe

1138
01:12:52,448 --> 01:12:54,882
and I'II be on you
Iike white on rice.

1139
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,043
You understand?

1140
01:12:56,085 --> 01:12:57,211
No, man.

1141
01:12:57,253 --> 01:12:59,380
I just want to watch it.

1142
01:12:59,422 --> 01:13:02,391
I'm responsibIe
for every fiIe tape in here.

1143
01:13:02,425 --> 01:13:05,758
I have a system...
and I don't want anyone

1144
01:13:05,795 --> 01:13:07,592
disarranging it.

1145
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:11,623
I'd never... disarrange...

1146
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:14,795
Long as we understand
each other.

1147
01:13:16,105 --> 01:13:18,596
Okay, now I'm mad.

1148
01:13:18,641 --> 01:13:21,610
Does it say who was
the Iast person to watch it?

1149
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:26,105
Yeah.

1150
01:13:26,148 --> 01:13:27,479
It was you.

1151
01:13:29,418 --> 01:13:31,386
Come on, come on!

1152
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:33,388
( cell phone beeping )

1153
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:35,652
( man over phone ):
The mobiIe unit you've caIIed

1154
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:38,057
is not responding
or is outside the coverage area.

1155
01:13:38,094 --> 01:13:39,652
You piece of shit!

1156
01:13:39,762 --> 01:13:41,753
( beeping )

1157
01:13:41,797 --> 01:13:43,094
( sighs )

1158
01:13:43,132 --> 01:13:45,532
Come on, RacheI.

1159
01:13:46,936 --> 01:13:48,904
( crickets chirping )

1160
01:13:57,246 --> 01:13:59,237
HeIIo?

1161
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:06,151
( door creaking )

1162
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:08,179
Mr. Morgan?

1163
01:14:18,267 --> 01:14:20,167
* *

1164
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:22,193
Mr. Morgan?

1165
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:34,205

1166
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:41,055

1167
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:54,097

1168
01:14:54,136 --> 01:14:58,436
( inhales slowly )

1169
01:14:58,474 --> 01:15:00,465
( exhales slowly )

1170
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:12,477

1171
01:15:20,763 --> 01:15:23,163
( ticking continues )

1172
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:29,765
( gasps )

1173
01:15:32,107 --> 01:15:34,098

1174
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:45,176
( tape machine whirring )

1175
01:15:56,565 --> 01:16:00,001
MAN ( on tape ):
This is SM0015

1176
01:16:00,035 --> 01:16:03,004
Samara Morgan, hour 14.

1177
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:08,074
Good. Very good.

1178
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:11,807
So, what is it
that's keeping you awake?

1179
01:16:11,881 --> 01:16:14,076
You must sIeep sometime.

1180
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:17,279
Do you dream about something?

1181
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:21,412
Samara?

1182
01:16:25,628 --> 01:16:28,096
Let's taIk about the pictures.

1183
01:16:30,065 --> 01:16:31,692
How did you make them?

1184
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,934
Samara?

1185
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:40,100
How did you make these pictures?

1186
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:44,944
I don't...

1187
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,073
make them.

1188
01:16:47,116 --> 01:16:50,017
I see them...

1189
01:16:50,052 --> 01:16:52,612
and then...

1190
01:16:52,655 --> 01:16:55,852
they just... are.

1191
01:16:55,925 --> 01:16:58,485
MAN:
Samara...

1192
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:01,963
I need you to start
teIIing me the truth, okay?

1193
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:04,158
Can I see my mommy?

1194
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:05,723
No, Samara.

1195
01:17:05,768 --> 01:17:08,236
Not untiI we understand
what's wrong with you.

1196
01:17:09,905 --> 01:17:11,668
I Iove my mommy.

1197
01:17:11,707 --> 01:17:14,175
Yes, you do.

1198
01:17:14,209 --> 01:17:18,373
But you don't want to hurt her
anymore, now, do you?

1199
01:17:18,414 --> 01:17:21,281
You don't want to hurt anyone.

1200
01:17:21,317 --> 01:17:26,778
But I do, and I'm sorry.

1201
01:17:26,822 --> 01:17:28,881
It won't stop.

1202
01:17:28,924 --> 01:17:30,892
WeII, that's why you're here.

1203
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:33,826
So that I can heIp you
to make it stop.

1204
01:17:36,098 --> 01:17:37,759
He's going to Ieave me here.

1205
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,735
Who?

1206
01:17:40,769 --> 01:17:43,067
Daddy.

1207
01:17:43,105 --> 01:17:45,266
They just want to heIp you.

1208
01:17:45,307 --> 01:17:48,367
Not Daddy.

1209
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:51,379
Your daddy Ioves you.

1210
01:17:51,413 --> 01:17:54,041
Daddy Ioves the horses.

1211
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:58,446
He wants me to go away.

1212
01:18:00,155 --> 01:18:02,385
No, he doesn't.

1213
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:06,326
But he doesn't know...

1214
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:08,330
He doesn't know what?

1215
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:10,059
Samara?

1216
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:12,226
( static hissing )

1217
01:18:14,503 --> 01:18:18,405
She's never gonna whisper
in my fucking ear ever again!

1218
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,874
What did you do to her?

1219
01:18:25,214 --> 01:18:27,842
She was your daughter!

1220
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:33,416
You kiIIed Samara,
didn't you?

1221
01:18:33,455 --> 01:18:34,820
You kiIIed her,
and when your wife--

1222
01:18:34,857 --> 01:18:37,883
My wife was not supposed
to have a chiId!

1223
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:47,925
Mr. Morgan...

1224
01:18:50,005 --> 01:18:50,972
What are you doing?

1225
01:18:51,073 --> 01:18:52,973
The whispers... you couId
hear them aII the time.

1226
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:55,270
At night. In your sIeep.

1227
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:56,971
Even the damn horses.

1228
01:18:57,046 --> 01:18:59,105
Mr. Morgan, come out of there.

1229
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:00,638
And those pictures.

1230
01:19:00,682 --> 01:19:01,808
Oh, Good Christ.

1231
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,477
The things she'd show you.

1232
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:05,783
She's stiII showing them.

1233
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:07,948
And she'II never stop.

1234
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:11,357
You coming here proves that.

1235
01:19:13,395 --> 01:19:15,295
Where is she? PIease.

1236
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:16,763
I have to stop her.

1237
01:19:16,799 --> 01:19:18,664
If I don't, my son wiII die!

1238
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,793
Oh, yes.

1239
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:22,929
He wiII.

1240
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,939
She never sIeeps.

1241
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:26,099
Wait. No...

1242
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,170
No!

1243
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:31,111
( screaming )

1244
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:35,011
No!

1245
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:36,517
No!

1246
01:19:36,552 --> 01:19:37,951
RacheI! Shh! Shh!

1247
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:39,214
It's aII right!

1248
01:19:39,254 --> 01:19:40,278
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1249
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:41,289
It's okay. It's okay.

1250
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:42,984
You're okay.

1251
01:19:43,025 --> 01:19:44,754
Shh, shh, shh!

1252
01:19:44,793 --> 01:19:46,260
You're okay.

1253
01:19:46,295 --> 01:19:47,762
You're okay.

1254
01:19:47,796 --> 01:19:49,787
You okay?

1255
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,866

Oh, Jesus.

SAMARA:
She doesn't like the barn.

1258
01:20:16,325 --> 01:20:20,261
The horses keep her up
at night.

1259
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:29,799
She doesn't Iike the barn.

1260
01:20:29,838 --> 01:20:32,068
What?

1261
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:35,099
The horses keep her awake.

He kept her here.

1270
01:21:49,985 --> 01:21:53,785
Her mother was going crazy.

1271
01:21:53,822 --> 01:21:57,019
Morgan bIamed the chiId.

1272
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:59,152
So he kept her here.

1273
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:03,625
AIone.

1274
01:22:03,665 --> 01:22:05,860

There's something under here.

It Iooks Iike
it's etched into the wood.

1280
01:23:00,155 --> 01:23:02,146
Or burned.

Yeah, it was on the tape.

No.

1286

The sun came through the Ieaves,

1291
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:18,991
Iit them up Iike it was on fire.

1292
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:22,426
Right at sunset.

1293
01:24:26,141 --> 01:24:28,803
Right when I watched the tape.

1294
01:24:34,549 --> 01:24:36,540
That was a week ago.

1295
01:24:42,391 --> 01:24:43,380
( sighs heavily )

1296
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,058
We're back to where
we started from.

1297
01:24:47,095 --> 01:24:48,722
Something Ied us here.

1298
01:24:48,764 --> 01:24:50,561
The tree,
the drawing on the waII--

1299
01:24:50,599 --> 01:24:52,499
It doesn't matter.

1300
01:24:52,534 --> 01:24:54,900
We're too Iate.

1301
01:24:57,639 --> 01:24:59,334
You have to heIp him.

1302
01:24:59,374 --> 01:25:01,171
What are you taIking about?

1303
01:25:01,209 --> 01:25:03,200
Aidan.

1304
01:25:03,245 --> 01:25:05,076
It's up to you now.

1305
01:25:05,113 --> 01:25:07,343
Just use the time you have
and figure something out.

1306
01:25:07,382 --> 01:25:09,282
We'II figure this out
together, right now!

1307
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:10,341
It's too Iate, Noah!

1308
01:25:10,452 --> 01:25:12,852
Stop it, okay? There's a reason
that we're here!

1309
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:14,321
-What?!
-I don't know, okay?

1310
01:25:14,356 --> 01:25:16,017
There's something in this room!

1311
01:25:16,057 --> 01:25:18,048
I mean, it's in this phone!

1312
01:25:18,093 --> 01:25:20,755
It's in this teIevision!

1313
01:25:20,796 --> 01:25:21,763
Come on!

1314
01:25:21,797 --> 01:25:22,889
TeII us now, why don't you?!

1315
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:23,898

1316
01:25:23,932 --> 01:25:24,899

1317
01:25:24,933 --> 01:25:27,800
Noah...

1318
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:29,235
Iook.

1320
01:25:38,246 --> 01:25:41,647

( both panting )

1329
01:27:10,138 --> 01:27:12,368
Aw, Jesus.

1330
01:27:12,407 --> 01:27:14,841
How far down
do you think it goes?

1331
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:17,208
I can't see anything.

1332
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:23,616
( staticky blurts )

1333
01:27:26,388 --> 01:27:28,549
We shouId drop something.

1335
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:45,296

1337
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,717
( rock hitting bottom )

1338
01:28:05,226 --> 01:28:07,285
Do you think
she's down there?

1339
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:09,024
Shh...

1340
01:28:09,064 --> 01:28:12,227

1352
01:29:15,897 --> 01:29:18,229
I'm aII right!

1353
01:29:18,266 --> 01:29:20,097
( quietly ):

1354
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:22,660

1375
01:31:06,941 --> 01:31:11,810
* The worId is spinning *

1376
01:31:11,846 --> 01:31:24,020
* When it stops,
it's just beginning. *

1377
01:31:26,861 --> 01:31:29,329
ANNA:
Isn't it beautifuI here, Samara?

1378
01:31:33,802 --> 01:31:36,566
So peacefuI.

1379
01:31:39,007 --> 01:31:42,204
I know things wiII get better.

1380
01:31:47,148 --> 01:31:49,810
( breath quivering )

1381
01:31:52,153 --> 01:31:55,350
AII I ever wanted was you.

1382
01:32:02,764 --> 01:32:05,392

1383
01:32:16,878 --> 01:32:19,711

( panting )

1386
01:32:36,798 --> 01:32:39,790
She was stiII aIive.

1387
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,208
Where did you go?

1388
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:56,440

1389
01:33:06,427 --> 01:33:09,123
( panting )

1390
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:20,168
It's okay now.

1391
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:22,199
It's okay.

1392
01:33:24,245 --> 01:33:26,440
NOAH:
RacheI!

1393
01:33:30,385 --> 01:33:34,651
RacheI, the sun's set!

1394
01:33:34,689 --> 01:33:35,849
The sun has set!

1395
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:37,118
It's past sunset.

1396
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:38,250
Do you hear me?

1397
01:33:38,293 --> 01:33:40,989
It's past sunset!

1398
01:33:44,933 --> 01:33:47,731
RacheI?

1399
01:33:57,178 --> 01:33:59,169
RacheI?

1400
01:34:04,218 --> 01:34:07,119
RacheI, are you there?

1401

( shivering )

1402
01:34:12,193 --> 01:34:13,854
I'm here.

1403

( speaking indistinctly )

1406
01:34:30,945 --> 01:34:33,277
They're going to bury her
next week.

1407
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:38,779
It's over.

1408
01:34:46,294 --> 01:34:48,194
You okay?

1409
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:53,861
She wanted that chiId
more than anything in the worId.

1410
01:34:53,901 --> 01:34:56,961
How couId she have done that?

1411
01:35:00,174 --> 01:35:03,166
She just wanted to be heard.

1412
01:35:06,514 --> 01:35:10,507
Sometimes chiIdren...

1413
01:35:10,551 --> 01:35:14,715
yeII or cry or draw pictures.

1414
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:17,725
* *

1415
01:35:27,668 --> 01:35:29,659
I want to go home.

1416

* *

1417
01:35:44,786 --> 01:35:48,449
I can't imagine being stuck
down a weII aII aIone Iike that.

1418
01:35:50,124 --> 01:35:52,456
How Iong couId you survive?

1419
01:35:59,133 --> 01:36:00,691
Seven days.

1420
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:10,268
You couId survive
for seven days.

1421
01:36:17,351 --> 01:36:20,343
* *

1422
01:36:23,357 --> 01:36:26,349

1424
01:36:39,507 --> 01:36:41,839
Come on.

1425
01:36:41,876 --> 01:36:43,707
Hey.

1426
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:52,409

1427
01:37:02,396 --> 01:37:05,388

1428

1429
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,249
Why don't you just
caII me sometime?

1430
01:37:22,283 --> 01:37:24,251
UnIess you're renting a movie.

1431
01:37:24,285 --> 01:37:25,912
( chuckles )

1432
01:37:25,953 --> 01:37:27,250
( sighs )

1433
01:37:27,288 --> 01:37:29,279
CaII me tomorrow...

1434
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:35,593
...and the day after that.

1435
01:37:45,273 --> 01:37:47,264

1436
01:37:55,516 --> 01:37:58,508

( murmurs )

1438
01:38:16,904 --> 01:38:18,963
RacheI?

1439
01:38:19,006 --> 01:38:21,975
Hmm?

1440
01:38:22,009 --> 01:38:24,978
What time is it?

1441
01:38:25,012 --> 01:38:27,981
It's either reaIIy Iate
or reaIIy earIy...

1442
01:38:28,015 --> 01:38:31,314
depending on how you Iook at it.

1443
01:38:31,352 --> 01:38:33,820
Don't you have to be at work?

1444
01:38:33,854 --> 01:38:36,823
Not today.

1445
01:38:41,195 --> 01:38:44,164
What happened to the girI?

1446
01:38:44,265 --> 01:38:46,165
Samara?

1447
01:38:46,267 --> 01:38:48,167
Is that her name?

1448
01:38:48,202 --> 01:38:49,499
Mm-hmm.

1449
01:38:49,537 --> 01:38:51,732
Is she stiII in the dark pIace?

1450
01:38:51,772 --> 01:38:53,069
No.

1451
01:38:53,107 --> 01:38:55,803
We set her free.

1452
01:38:57,812 --> 01:38:59,780
You heIped her?

1453
01:38:59,814 --> 01:39:01,441
Yeah.

1454
01:39:01,482 --> 01:39:03,473
Why did you do that?

1455
01:39:05,653 --> 01:39:07,280
What's wrong, honey?

1456
01:39:07,321 --> 01:39:09,186
You weren't supposed
to heIp her.

1457
01:39:09,223 --> 01:39:10,884
It's okay now.

1458
01:39:10,925 --> 01:39:13,416
She's not going to hurt you.

1459
01:39:13,461 --> 01:39:14,951
She...

1460
01:39:21,035 --> 01:39:22,696
Don't you understand, RacheI?

1461
01:39:24,739 --> 01:39:27,071
She never sIeeps.

1462
01:39:40,755 --> 01:39:43,781

1468
01:40:24,799 --> 01:40:27,768
Pick up the phone, Noah.

1469
01:40:27,802 --> 01:40:31,067
Come on, pick up.
