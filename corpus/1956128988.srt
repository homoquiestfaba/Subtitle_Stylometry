Work. Sunday brunch.

00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,153
I'm already late.

No, he was hot, right?

to talk to you...

before you say anything...

I saw you looking at it
last time you were over.

29
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,387
It's the artwork
I did for the florists.

30
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,224
I thought that print would,
you know, look good
in your bedroom.

Thank you.

Yeah, just...
Just a break
for a little while.

We're not breaking up. I...
Why?

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,482
I mean, I just need some time
to just figure things out.

38
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,618

we should take a break.

Well, here's the thing, though.
He doesn't make
himself available.

111
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,247
So it's not like
he's gonna find someone.

And never settles down with
any of them.

to take him out

try an open relationship?

143
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,995
We could try.

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,031
Yeah?
Maybe.

We definitely need rules.

00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,985
Okay, no repeats.
We only have fun
with a guy once

and we always,
always tell each other.

Come on.

154
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,626
Let's not make rules

Please don't ever
lie to me, Marcus.

bring him up.

playing his boyfriend.

to have people over, or we...
