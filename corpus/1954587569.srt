1
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,293
Woman:
This big one.

2
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:29,328
Man:
No, no, she can't have that.

3
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,664
What is it, Pheebs?
What is it?

4
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:34,167
Phoebe:
A microscope!

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,002
Man:
Excellent.

6
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,004
Did you want that?

7
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,839
- Yes?
- Yes.

8
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:42,508
Woman: How does he know
what you want?

9
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,510
You must have been
such a good girl.

10
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,179
Man:
Did Santa get it right?

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,313
Yes.

12
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:50,049
Right, Elliot,
anything for you, buddy?

13
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:52,785
Well, I think we might
have one more.

14
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:56,122
Maybe.
It might be this one.

15
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:01,094
This is what Santa gives you.

16
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,795
I love you.
Thank you.

17
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:04,664
It's not me, it's Santa.

18
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:07,900
No.

19
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,769
Yes.
Is that the one we saw?

20
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,846
Come on, Dad, you promised
we'd go to the festival.

21
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,013
Yeah, you promised.

22
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:24,317
Okay, okay.
We'll go to the festival.

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,052
- Yay!
- Yay!

24
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,169
( dogs barking )

25
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,477
Which one can I get
for three bucks?

26
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,881
Well, how about, if you
can convince your parents

27
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,883
to take one home today,
I'll give you three bucks

28
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,018
to buy its first bag
of puppy food?

29
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:03,389
Phoebe, no, forget it,
Dad will never go for it.

30
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:04,991
Don't listen to him.

31
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,326
We'll take one puppy
in a to-go box, please.

32
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,863
My dad won't mind.
It's a surprise.

33
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:12,598
Phoebe, no, we're about to
order.

34
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:16,502
And Dad's already mad you came
out here without permission.

35
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:17,970
Come on,

36
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,673
not even for the crazy-eyed spaz
in the back corner?

37
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,208
Oh.

38
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,377
Looks like I'd be
doing you the favor.

39
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,082
( chuckles )

40
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:35,421
That would--
oh, there they are.

41
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:39,125
What would my two most favorite
customers like today?

42
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,095
How about a break
from the baloney?

43
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,198
Fruit tarts
for both of us, please.

44
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:48,034
Okay.

45
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,340
Phoebe?

46
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:56,409
Now what did we all
talk about last night?

47
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,344
How we should respect Daniela

48
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,846
'cause she's
your new girlfriend.

49
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,348
Yes.

50
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,250
No, no,
she's not my girlfriend.

51
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:05,785
Yet.

52
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,954
We've only gone out
a couple of times.

53
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,822
Now look, she's trying
really hard with you guys,

54
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:13,826
so I would appreciate it
if you would be nice--

55
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,330
both of you.
Okay?

56
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,103
All righty, here we have two
tarts
for the two of you

57
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:27,506
and one yummy chocolate
croissant
for the handsome man.

58
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,041
Ooh.

59
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:33,980
I baked these fresh
just for you and you.

60
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,082
Well, thank you,
we appreciate it.

61
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:39,085
One piping hot
pumpkin spiced latte to go.

62
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,321
Thank you.
Kids, what do we say?

63
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,290
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

64
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:45,992
Daniela:
Oh, no problem.

65
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,527
So are we still on
for tomorrow night?

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,062
Oh, I don't know.

67
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:51,797
I forgot to ask their
grandmother
if she could stay.

68
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,900
Oh, why don't I just come over
and cook dinner for everybody?

69
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,202
How about that?

70
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,971
Yeah, that sounds--
that's wonderful.

71
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,406
Okay, I'll see you
at 7:00.

72
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,208
- Okay.
- All right.

73
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,243
Bye.

74
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:10,816
You lucky-lou.

75
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,719
What a hunky slab
of pumpkin bread that is.

76
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:15,221
I know.

77
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:17,423
Oh, and you should see
the house they live in.

78
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,759
It's beautiful.

79
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,794
It sounds almost perfect.

80
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:24,730
Too bad his kids
are such snarky little tarts.

81
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,232
That doesn't faze me.

82
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,769
Nothing a little discipline
can't fix.

83
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,039
( jingling )

84
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,216
( jingling )

85
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:59,165
Oh, it's you again.

86
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,666
Did your parents
change their mind?

87
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,737
Did your parents change
their mind about what?

88
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,539
Elliot, you did not tell
this nice lady

89
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,574
that we were looking
to adopt a dog, did you?

90
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:09,942
No, Dad, I didn't.

91
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,278
I just-- earlier, Phoebe
was over here and I--

92
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:15,081
Oh, I don't know
what's gotten into her.

93
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,184
Oh.

94
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,186
It looks like she likes you.

95
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,856
Okay, she is very, very,
very cute, okay?

96
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,391
But the Barrows family
household

97
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:28,761
has a very strict
no-puppy policy.

98
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:30,863
Oh, are you allergic,
Mr. Barrows?

99
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,598
No, no.

100
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:35,368
So may I ask why the policy?

101
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,669
( chuckles )

102
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:39,705
Okay, fine, here's how
this scenario unfolds.

103
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:42,575
Adopt lovely canine for the kids

104
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,910
and after a couple of weeks,
kids lose interest

105
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:48,147
and Pops ends up
taking care of said canine

106
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,682
for the next 10 to 12.

107
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,617
Is that how you guys see
this scenario playing out?

108
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,386
No, ma'am.

109
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,254
'Cause it sounds like you've
been
skipping out on your chores

110
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,356
and leaving them
for good old Pops, huh?

111
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,325
Well, no--

112
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,161
well, sometimes when I say
I dusted the mantel,

113
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,563
when I really
just blew the surface.

114
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:07,299
But typically, no.

115
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:11,003
Because, you know,
this is a shepherd mix.

116
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,805
She's gonna eat a lot

117
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:15,074
and poop a lot
and shed a lot.

118
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,509
Basically drive you crazy

119
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,011
for the first year or two
that you have her.

120
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:22,214
But she's also gonna
crack you up every day.

121
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:24,083
Oh, oops.

122
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:26,919
And she's gonna
cuddle you like crazy

123
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,988
and basically
love you unconditionally

124
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,590
till her last day on Earth.

125
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,860
I promise you won't regret it.

126
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:39,598
That's a very, very good pitch,
I will give you that.

127
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:43,035
I'm sorry, we just can't do it.
Not this year.

128
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:45,538
But I appreciate it.

129
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,706
Thank you.
Come on, kids, let's go.

130
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:50,076
- Daddy, please?
- Honey, come on.

131
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,012
( doorbell ringing )

132
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,281
Dad: Hey, guys, will one of you
get the door, please?

133
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:04,490
Ah, my merry little
mischief makers.

134
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,626
It's good to see you.

135
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,262
Grandma.

136
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:12,498
What's wrong, Elliot?

137
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,135
Are you not happy to see
your wrinkly old granny?

138
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:19,205
He's crying because
you called him "mischief maker."

139
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,907
Mom called us that
sometimes, too.

140
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,176
Nuh-uh. I wasn't crying, Phoebe.

141
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,879
Grandma's perfume
burned my eyes.

142
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:30,616
Well, did your mama never tell
you
where that nickname came from?

143
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,386
She got it from herself.

144
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,057
Every Christmas Eve when she
and Uncle Ted were your age,

145
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,859
they would sneak down
the stairs

146
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,762
and try to unwrap
every present under the tree

147
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:46,765
without tearing
any of the wrapping paper.

148
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:49,435
One year, your mama even
got a roll of Scotch tape

149
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,271
and she tried
to re-tape the things

150
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,173
that they'd accidentally torn

151
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,674
and I'll tell you what,

152
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:59,178
sly old Granny
was waiting and watching.

153
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,881
I caught her red-handed!

154
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,052
Gee, Mom sure was naughty.

155
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:10,289
- Must be where I get it from.
- Maybe so.

156
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,224
But why call us that?

157
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:15,027
We never did anything
to earn Mom's nickname.

158
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,096
Well, honey, never say never.

159
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,900
You don't know what mischief
the holidays can bring.

160
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,603
I don't want Mom's nickname.

161
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,306
Oh, hey, Marnie,
thank you so much for coming.

162
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,607
I really appreciate it.

163
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,510
I didn't even think about
needing a sitter,

164
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:33,746
this being
the first time since--

165
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:38,017
Don't mention it.
You know I love being here.

166
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,618
Should I feed them
dinner, too?

167
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:42,354
No, no, I should be done
and back by 6:00, so...

168
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,223
Well, I'm already here.

169
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,725
I might as well fix them
a proper meal.

170
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:49,828
I bet the kids are getting tired
of rotisserie chicken

171
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:51,931
- from the grocery store.
- ( Dad chuckles )

172
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,532
All right, you know me
too well, Marnie.

173
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:55,634
Thanks. Uh...

174
00:08:55,667 --> 00:09:00,205
Actually, that lady friend
that I told you about,

175
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:05,578
she was actually planning on
coming by and cooking, so--

176
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,612
That's nice.

177
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,347
Maybe you can stay
and you could meet her,

178
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,949
unless that would be weird.

179
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,518
Glenn, you know,
I've told you a thousand times,

180
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,620
my Janey loved you.

181
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,322
She would want you
to find somebody

182
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,657
to make you
and the kids happy.

183
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,526
And, of course, you know
I would want to meet her.

184
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,027
I love you like a son.

185
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,930
Now you get on out of here
before it's too late.

186
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:28,267
Thank you.
See you, honey, okay?

187
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,837
( sighs )

188
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,007
So that's what you think of the
lady
your daddy's seeing?

189
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,977
If I said out loud
what I thought of her, Grandma,

190
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,480
Santa would surely skip
bringing me presents this year.

191
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:44,350
Oh, that's really bad.

192
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,222
Hey, buddy.

193
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,558
Did you ask Malcolm
if he wanted to ride bikes with
you?

194
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,894
Elliot, I don't want
to do anything

195
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:59,164
that makes you
or your sister uncomfortable.

196
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:01,133
Okay, so if it's too early
for all this stuff,

197
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:05,104
- I'll just tell Dani that--
- No, Dad, it's fine.

198
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,573
If you like her,
I want you to be happy.

199
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,376
I'm sure deep down
Phoebe does, too.

200
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,244
I want us all
to be happy, buddy.

201
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,649
Be careful out here,
will you?

202
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,685
- All right. Love you.
- You, too.

203
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:22,288
( engine starts )

204
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:34,600
Boom.
Blindsided by the blonde.

205
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,035
What?

206
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,137
When my dad left, my mom said

207
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,040
it was because he was
blindsided by a big booty,

208
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,810
but your dad, same thing,
only a big-headed blonde.

209
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,948
Thought you were going
to a Christmas play

210
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:52,251
with your mom
at your church today.

211
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,652
Got out of it.

212
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:56,255
Said I had kidney beans
for a late-night snack.

213
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,658
And that if she took me,
I'd be pooting on the pews.

214
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:02,428
Have you ever heard
of a poot on a wooden pew?

215
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,798
It sounds like a choir of one
praising hallelujah.

216
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,169
So why didn't you want to go?

217
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,871
Well, it's not like
I could ever leave you alone.

218
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:16,875
You've been such a sad Santa
sack
ever since school let out.

219
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,744
How many times
do I have to I tell you?

220
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm fine.

221
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,583
So what are you doing out here
all alone anyway?

222
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:27,186
I was trying to be alone.

223
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,855
Or maybe you were trying

224
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:33,892
to drive back and forth
past the Kane residence,

225
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:37,196
wait and see if a certain
third-grader was selling

226
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,799
hot chocolate like last year.

227
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:44,970
I already told you, Malcolm,
I don't like Riley Kane, okay?

228
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,406
Not even when
she's looking all fine

229
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,842
like that in her winter's best?

230
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:55,981
I don't know about you,
but I'm thirsty.

231
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:10,395
You're not getting free cocoa
again this year, Malcolm.

232
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:12,798
If you really have
low blood sugar,

233
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,833
go and see your pediatrician.

234
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,603
I wasn't asking for a handout.

235
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:22,174
A man with a job
gladly pays for his cocoa.

236
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:25,978
Now with extra
marshmallows, please.

237
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,653
( Malcolm slurping )

238
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:43,996
And what's this alleged job
of yours anyways, Malcolm?

239
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,564
I scoop doggie doo

240
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:48,367
for the greater citizens
on the west block.

241
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:51,170
So what's the cause?

242
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:55,174
All proceeds go to Hands on
Paws,
our local dog rescue.

243
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,476
Hey, they were set up
in front of the bakery.

244
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,545
Had a really cute pup I loved.

245
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,847
- You like dogs too, Elliot?
- Sure, I do.

246
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,651
My dad won't let us get one,
but I really wish we could.

247
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,786
My parents won't
let me get one either.

248
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:10,722
It's nice you're trying to help
all the dogs
with the fundraiser, though.

249
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:14,259
The things a boy will say
to get a girl to believe him.

250
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:15,794
What are you
talking about?

251
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:18,297
I bet he never even heard

252
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,532
of Hands on Paws
before you mentioned it.

253
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:23,502
Besides, you're hardly
mature enough

254
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:25,871
to handle a dog
responsibly, Elliot.

255
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,773
And you're hardly mature enough

256
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,176
to handle a gentleman
like my fine friend here.

257
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,579
Now quit gawking at him
like you're not mad

258
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,415
he didn't talk to you first,
Penny "Whiner."

259
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,251
You had your cocoa,
so leave already.

260
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,420
No loitering.

261
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:52,531
Goodness, I'm so sorry.

262
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:54,099
If I had known there
was gonna be a guest,

263
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:57,536
I would have brought another
cranberry Cornish hen.

264
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,171
But you are the guest,

265
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:02,441
so how did you not
know you'd be here, silly?

266
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,445
It's fine.
Phoebe and I will share.

267
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,746
Oh, good.

268
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,349
So, Daniela, what kind
of work do you do?

269
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,752
Oh, well, I work at the bakery
down on Main Street.

270
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:16,922
Which explains why she's such
a good cook, doesn't it, guys?

271
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,560
Marnie: Well, now,
that's a nice little place.

272
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:23,762
So have you always lived
in Tennessee?

273
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:26,765
Oh, well, I actually lived
in L.A. for a little bit.

274
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,067
You know, I did some modeling
and some acting

275
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,570
and that just didn't pan out.

276
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:34,072
So I'm back here
starting fresh and anew.

277
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:35,173
Marnie:
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:37,576
What did you say
your last name was again?

279
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:39,111
Oh, it's Downy.

280
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:45,651
Uh, Dani actually said
she knew of Janey in school.

281
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,687
Yes, Daniela, I do believe
I remember you.

282
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,958
You were in a bunch of local
pageants
growing up, as I recall.

283
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:56,895
Yes.
Yes, I was.

284
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:59,298
Fancy that, someone
who went to my pageants.

285
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,966
Oh, I didn't.

286
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,668
I just...

287
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,372
I read about them
in the paper, that's all.

288
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:08,440
Oh.

289
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:10,609
That's a pretty sharp memory
there, Marn.

290
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:16,982
Wait. So you knew my mom and you
think it's okay to like my dad?

291
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:21,086
Elliot, I barely knew
your mom,

292
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,889
you know, and I've been
getting your daddy's coffee

293
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:30,195
for over a year now
and never knew that Janey--

294
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:33,632
well, you know, I just wanted
to make you all a nice dinner.

295
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:35,801
It's just really weird.

296
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,839
No wonder she did bad in L.A.

297
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:43,008
That was a terrible performance.

298
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,178
I think you guys
owe Dani an apology.

299
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:54,586
Oh.

300
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,822
Ah.

301
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,260
Mm...

302
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:07,032
( gasps )
Oh, my.

303
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:17,275
You know, those ungrateful
little heathens.

304
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:20,479
I mean, those Cornish hens,
those are a real pain in my--

305
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,916
- ( knocking on door )
- Oh. Just a minute.

306
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:27,753
Okay.

307
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,757
You all right?

308
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,696
Yeah, I'll be fine.

309
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:40,098
I'm really sorry.

310
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:43,602
I mean, this whole situation's
just so new for everybody,

311
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,636
and they're just--

312
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,004
Right.

313
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:48,673
I completely understand.

314
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:51,910
I mean, I know
because I lost my mother

315
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:54,913
over the holidays
and I know exactly

316
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:57,215
what they're
going through, so...

317
00:16:57,248 --> 00:17:01,053
- I'm sorry. I had no idea.
- I do, I do.

318
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,087
Uh...

319
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,492
Sorry.

320
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,797
Elliot, are you okay, honey?

321
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,232
Well, if it's any consolation,

322
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,835
your mother didn't care
for Dani either.

323
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:21,339
But that information is strictly
between us big kids.

324
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:23,242
Pinky swear?

325
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,144
And I only say that

326
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:30,082
because your daddy needs
to find out for himself.

327
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,917
He probably thinks
he's doing what's right

328
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,288
for you kids right now,
but he's a smart man.

329
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,156
Just give him
a little time, okay?

330
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:42,661
But I thought she said
she didn't know Mom that well.

331
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,696
Mom didn't like her?

332
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,231
Honey, your mama
liked everyone.

333
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:49,101
It was Dani who was jealous
of your mom.

334
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,535
Why?

335
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:52,170
Well, back
when they were seniors,

336
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:55,574
your mom was voted
the most popular in school

337
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:59,044
and somehow Dani claimed
that the ballots had been
rigged,

338
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:03,115
but when they did a recount,
Janey won by a landslide.

339
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,617
Can you imagine?

340
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,321
Daniela Downy must have
fake cried the whole way home.

341
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,388
"Oh-hh!"

342
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:12,324
( all laughing )

343
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,127
Glenn:
Ahem.

344
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,830
Guys, is there something
you'd like to say to Dani?

345
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,265
Both:
Sorry.

346
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,868
Is there anything else
you want to say to Dani?

347
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,902
Food?

348
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,304
Both:
Thanks for the food.

349
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:27,973
Yes, thank you, Dani.

350
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,675
Oh, you are so welcome.

351
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,078
I actually made the same meal
for the homeless

352
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:35,380
down at the shelters.
Quite a treat.

353
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:38,250
Glenn:
Well, that's very nice of you.

354
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,986
And, guys, since Dani doesn't
have any family to go home to

355
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,088
for the holidays, I told her
that she could spend

356
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:47,092
the holidays with us,
okay?

357
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,294
Dani:
And thank you so much.

358
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:51,263
I mean, you don't know
how much this means to me.

359
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,431
I thought I was gonna
have to spend the holidays

360
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:56,001
all by myself in my dreary
little house

361
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:00,105
but, oh, we get to make pies
and play games

362
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:04,409
and, oh, it's just gonna be
the best holiday ever together!

363
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:07,012
Oh, I got lots to do.

364
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,953
Oh, no. Oh.

365
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:18,690
How do I--? Oh-hh.

366
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:20,725
Oh, good morning.

367
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:22,127
Hey, good morning.
How did you sleep?

368
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,863
Oh, that bed is more comfortable

369
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,165
than the one I sleep on
at home every night.

370
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:29,968
So what are you guys
up to here?

371
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:33,638
We are making French toast.

372
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:35,340
French toast!

373
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,542
Oh, I make
the best French toast.

374
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,711
Here, let me handle this.

375
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,180
Oh.

376
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,182
I've got bread, got our eggs.

377
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,952
Oh, milk,
I got to get some milk.

378
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,422
( doorbell ringing )

379
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,428
- ( whimpers )
- Hey, you brought the puppy!

380
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,629
Woman:
Hi.

381
00:19:57,662 --> 00:19:59,931
I didn't get your name
the other day.

382
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:03,001
- It's Elliot.
- Well, is your dad home,
Elliot?

383
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,803
Puppy!

384
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,905
- Can you hold her?
- Yeah.

385
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,907
Elliot, did you--

386
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,711
No, no, it wasn't him.
It was me.

387
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,815
Look, I can't really explain it

388
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:22,120
but what happened with this dog
and Elliot yesterday, it's--

389
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:25,290
connections like that
aren't made every day.

390
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:27,525
This dog loves your son.

391
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:30,562
She's been crying
ever since he left.

392
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:33,031
And look, I don't want
to tell you how to parent

393
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,966
because I have
no experience with it.

394
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,135
I've never parented anything
other than the dogs

395
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:40,038
that I foster every year.

396
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:44,009
But I think in order
to learn responsibility,

397
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,045
you have to be given
responsibility.

398
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:49,614
And that applies
to the kids here, right?

399
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:52,751
Please, Dad? I promise
I'll take good care of her.

400
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,986
Pretty, pretty, pretty please?

401
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,590
You can even take back our--
oh, sorry.

402
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:01,426
I mean, Elliot's shares
of the presents back

403
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:04,029
if we can just have
this one puppy.

404
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,731
Please, Daddy, please?

405
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:08,433
I mean, you show up
on my doorstep here

406
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,303
with this fuzzy little bit
of cuteness

407
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,039
with a bow on and everything.

408
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,208
It's not like I ever really
had a choice, huh?

409
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:19,711
Okay.

410
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,213
Both:
Yay! Thank you, Daddy!

411
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:24,115
Give me the papers
and let me sign

412
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:26,651
on the dotted line
before I change my mind.

413
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:27,986
Ready for you right there.

414
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,554
Yes, you are.

415
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:31,923
Well, last step is you guys
have to name her.

416
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,526
Yeah, Elliot.
What you gonna name her?

417
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,929
Belle.
Her name is Belle.

418
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,131
Oh, what do we have
going on here?

419
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:42,500
- Woman: Hi.
- Oh--!

420
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:45,937
- ( sneezes )
- Glenn: Bless you.

421
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,272
Oh, you must be the neighbor

422
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,441
and you adopted a dog,
isn't that nice?

423
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,143
Nope, she's ours
for the keeping.

424
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:55,714
And you're allergic, ain't you?

425
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,850
Glenn, please tell me
that you did not adopt a dog

426
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,852
from a complete stranger.

427
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:03,521
I mean, no offense,
you seem lovely.

428
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:05,156
She's not a stranger.

429
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:08,159
And Belle isn't a random dog.
Are you, Belle?

430
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:09,928
She's part of our family now.

431
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,364
Dani, this is the director

432
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,899
of the local dog rescue
here in town.

433
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:16,935
We actually met yesterday,

434
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,471
actually right outside
your bakery.

435
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,539
- I'm Kate.
- ( sneezes )

436
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:24,576
- Kate: Nice to meet you.
- Bless you.

437
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,978
This is Dani and Dani is--

438
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,414
Our homeless holiday guest.

439
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:31,549
Thanks.

440
00:22:31,582 --> 00:22:34,452
You are allergic to dogs,
aren't you?

441
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:35,954
Mm-hmm, yes.

442
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:42,327
Oh, to the fur, to their drool,
to the feces-- all of it.

443
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,461
Glenn:
I had no idea.

444
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:46,231
But, you know, actually
they have shots now for that

445
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,767
- and they're pretty simple,
so--
- Oh, really?

446
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,068
I'm gonna get going but
I'm gonna give you my card.

447
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:51,403
It has my cell number on it.

448
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,205
Call me anytime
if you need anything.

449
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:58,743
All of her papers
and she's got all of her shots.

450
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:00,111
The number
for the vet is on there

451
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,379
and there's
an after-hours emergency,

452
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:03,982
just in case something
goes wrong.

453
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,818
Perfect. That's great,
thank you so very much.

454
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,787
Yes, thank you,
thank you, Kate.

455
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,989
You are so welcome.

456
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,624
Merry Christmas, Kate.

457
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,692
- Enjoy Belle.
- We will.

458
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,594
- Take good care of her.
- Okay.

459
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,196
I appreciate it, Kate.
Thank you, very, very much.

460
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:20,698
Thank you.
Bye, guys, nice meeting you.

461
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,500
Dani:
Yeah.

462
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,903
Okay, girl, let's get you
something to eat.

463
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,938
I bet you're starving.

464
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:29,040
Elliot, you can't just
feed her anything, okay?

465
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:31,176
She can't have chocolate.
She can't have onions...

466
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:34,679
( sneezes )

467
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:16,648
( knocking on door )

468
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,583
Hey, bud.

469
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,823
Everything okay with Dani?

470
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:28,927
Well, at least
she stopped crying.

471
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,297
Belle makes you
pretty happy, doesn't she?

472
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,399
Yeah, I don't think
I've seen you this

473
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,334
consistently happy
in a long time.

474
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,369
Belle is so happy
all the time.

475
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:40,772
I've got to work hard
to keep up, you know.

476
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,308
And I've been telling Belle
all about Mom.

477
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,444
How she was the most amazing
architect ever

478
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:48,212
and how we used to lay
on the floor of her study

479
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:49,647
and draw pictures

480
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,250
while she would work
on blueprints at her desk.

481
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:58,656
You don't think Mom's starting
to think
that I forgot about her

482
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:00,558
because Belle
makes me so happy?

483
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:05,430
No, no, no way, buddy,
no way.

484
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:10,268
Your mom,
she is watching down on you.

485
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:14,238
And every single time
that you or your sister smile,

486
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:18,043
I promise you,
she smiles, too.

487
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:22,647
And speaking of drawing,

488
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,383
you know, I haven't
seen you draw in a long time.

489
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:27,385
You used to draw everywhere.

490
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:30,288
You ever think about
taking it back up?

491
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:35,693
I'm just saying there's
this pretty girl up the street

492
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:39,464
who could probably use
a sketch of Belle for Christmas,

493
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,067
seeing as how she doesn't
have a dog of her own.

494
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:48,172
- I don't know.
- No? Hey, no pressure.

495
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:51,342
Just a creative mind
can get you pretty far, buddy.

496
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,778
I mean, your mom's
ability to design,

497
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:56,848
that was just one of the--
one of the many reasons

498
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,717
that I fell in love with her.

499
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:03,621
Just think about it.

500
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:06,324
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night, Dad.

501
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,842
"Dear Janey, Merry Christmas
to you and yours.

502
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,844
I know we haven't spoken
for some time now,

503
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:30,181
but I just wanted you know
that your presence--"

504
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,357
( phone beeps )

505
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:46,130
Hey, Marnie, good morning.

506
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:48,466
I have a quick
question for you.

507
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,268
Do you know if Janey
ever designed

508
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:53,171
some home plans
down in Wimberley?

509
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:57,775
Yeah, I don't remember
that either.

510
00:27:57,808 --> 00:27:59,444
I was just curious.

511
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,979
Okay, we're gonna
see you later today?

512
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:03,915
Okie-dokie, bye-bye.

513
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,950
( phone beeps )

514
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:10,354
- Good morning.
- Oh, hey.

515
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:11,856
Oh, you have to work
on Christmas Eve?

516
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:15,760
Yeah, it's Honey Brook
Annual Baking Contest

517
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:19,297
and I have to get a four-tiered
red velvet Christmas cake ready

518
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,666
before 5:00
for the attendees.

519
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,669
Would you--
would you like to come?

520
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,804
- ( sneezes )
- Oh!

521
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,306
Yeah, that sounds
like it'd be fun.

522
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,707
I think the kids
would enjoy that.

523
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,745
And you could probably use
a little break from your
allergies, too.

524
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,381
Yeah. Well, why don't I
just come back around 6:00

525
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:39,717
and you and me and the kids,
we can all ride together?

526
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,385
- That sounds great.
- All right.

527
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:42,820
You have a really
good day, dear.

528
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:44,889
- Thank you.
- ( sneezes )

529
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:46,958
Ooh. Sorry.

530
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,326
( both chuckle )

531
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,862
- You have a good day.
- ( chuckles )

532
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,000
( door closes )

533
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:09,847
Hey, kids, why don't you guys
get dressed in something decent

534
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,517
and come on down here.
We're gonna take a little road
trip.

535
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:26,831
I still don't see
why we couldn't bring Belle.

536
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:29,033
Well, because, Elliot,
what happens in the New Year

537
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,535
when you start school again?

538
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,971
She has to learn to stay home
by herself a little bit each
day.

539
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,353
Ooh, looks delish.

540
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,189
What's wrong?

541
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:54,091
I thought you were ecstatic
to be spending the holidays

542
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:58,663
with the big-shot boyfriend,
the lawyer and his rugrats.

543
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,365
You said it was your
"champagne dream come true."

544
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:04,602
It was, until that Belle
came along.

545
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,405
Bell?
Like a sleigh bell?

546
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:12,810
No, more like a mangy
eight-pound ball of fur

547
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:15,980
who cries constantly
and drools incessantly

548
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:19,517
and whose breath smells
like a cheesy bacon fart.

549
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,420
Oh, they got a puppy!
How cute.

550
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,723
I mean, ooh, how gross.

551
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:28,626
I mean, I hope you put out
rat traps for the little vermin.

552
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,660
Hmm...

553
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:32,096
So what are you
gonna do now?

554
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,232
Huh?
What can I do?

555
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,601
I mean, this dog
has won the affections

556
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,636
of this entire household

557
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:40,438
before I could even
get my favorite

558
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,440
crocodile boots
through the door.

559
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,609
Glenn included.

560
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:48,179
These kids,
they can't stand me.

561
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:50,915
Oh, but ever since that dog--

562
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:53,251
oh, my gosh, I can't even
be in the house

563
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,320
without sneezing my head off.

564
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:59,991
I guess it's back
to the old drawing board

565
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,526
for my future.

566
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,462
What am I supposed to do?

567
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,365
Maybe, maybe you could date
that Skip Jeffries

568
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:11,068
that comes in here all the time.
He's really pretty cute.

569
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,504
Uh, Kimmy, he's a plumber.

570
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:14,572
Yeah.

571
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:18,609
Yeah, he comes in here
and he unclogs toilets.

572
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:20,978
- Oh.
- And every time he bends over,

573
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:23,681
I feel like I'm visiting
the Grand Canyon.

574
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:25,983
You know, I don't think so.

575
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:28,786
Oh! Oh!

576
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:31,188
Look at what you
made me do!

577
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:34,091
- Kimmy: I'm so sorry.
- Oh, God, you got me so upset.

578
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:38,562
You still look really pretty
even covered in batter.

579
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:41,165
I cannot go to the contest
looking like this.

580
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:43,467
I got to get home and change.
Oh, my gosh.

581
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,238
Oh, okay. You finish the cakes,
I will be back in 30 minutes.

582
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:48,439
Okay.

583
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:54,012
Glenn:
We're here, guys.

584
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,928
Elliot, ring
the doorbell, please.

585
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:12,930
Yes, Dad.

586
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:14,766
( doorbell rings )

587
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:21,305
Yes, may I help you?

588
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:23,541
Hi, yeah, I'm Glenn Barrows.

589
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,910
I'm Janey Barrows' husband.

590
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:29,347
Oh, my,
what a wonderful surprise.

591
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,182
And this must be
Elliot and Phoebe.

592
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,616
Yes, ma'am.

593
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,952
I've heard Janey speak
many times of them.

594
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:37,321
Where is Janey?

595
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:40,358
Actually, that's what I came
here
to talk to you about.

596
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,060
Oh, okay.
Well, please do come in.

597
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,395
Thank you.

598
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:50,534
Well, let's just see
if there is anything left

599
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,937
on Mr. Barrows'
Christmas wish list

600
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,807
after he's had a slice
of this red velvet cake.

601
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:06,651
( sneezes )

602
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,088
( gasps )

603
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,863
Where are you?

604
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,433
( sneezes )

605
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:23,935
Where are you?

606
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,840
Ah.

607
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:36,047
Oh, you have been waiting
under the wrong Christmas tree.

608
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,561
( sneezes )

609
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:12,016
- ( popping )
- ( screaming )

610
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:18,022
Malcolm, are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

611
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:20,591
What did I tell you about
firecrackers in the front yard

612
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:21,759
before New Year?

613
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:24,529
Get your butt over here, boy.

614
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,072
Kimmy, Kimmy,
phone call for you.

615
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:37,141
Will you please take it
on the kitchen line?

616
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:38,676
Yes, ma'am.

617
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,650
- Hello?
- Oh, Kimmy, it's me.

618
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:47,885
I was wondering
if you could whip up

619
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,687
some of that
cream cheese frosting.

620
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,388
I'm gonna be a little later
than I thought.

621
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:52,957
Copy that.

622
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,259
I'll be licking the beaters
till you get back.

623
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:57,094
Um, is everything okay?

624
00:34:57,127 --> 00:35:01,165
Oh, everything is just
powdered sugar now.

625
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:04,001
I'm actually on my way
to displace

626
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:06,504
this little fleabag
in her new home right now.

627
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,140
Okay.
See you when you get back.

628
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:15,980
Woman:
Y'all come on now, have a seat.

629
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,681
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

630
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,383
This is beautiful.

631
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:21,418
Oh, well, thank you.

632
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:22,987
- Grandma?
- Woman: Yes, come on, baby.

633
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,355
- Come on.
- Glenn: Thank you.

634
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,191
Now this here is my grandbaby,
Miss Adelaide.

635
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:28,926
Her mom and daddy
went out to get us

636
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,929
a nice smoked ham
for dinner, didn't they?

637
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:34,798
Hi.
You can call me Addie.

638
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:39,436
Hi, Addie, I'm Phoebe
and this is my little brother
Elliot.

639
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:42,473
He's shy.

640
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:44,542
My daddy made me
a Santa sleigh.

641
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,645
- You want to see?
- Sure.

642
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,014
Wait, wait,
now y'all get your cookies.

643
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,048
Oh.

644
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,919
Just one each, just one.

645
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,387
Okay.

646
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,055
Well, you're lucky.

647
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,357
I was just making
my afternoon tea.

648
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,726
Perfect, that's gonna
hit the spot, thank you.

649
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:04,128
Oh, you're welcome.

650
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,996
You know,
when that flood came through,

651
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:08,265
this tea set was one of the few
things
I was able to salvage.

652
00:36:08,298 --> 00:36:10,434
I remember that.
That was terrible.

653
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,169
I bet you do.

654
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:15,573
Lord, they sure look
an awful lot like her, don't
they?

655
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:16,974
You know,
it's a shame that Janey

656
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:19,343
couldn't come
with you all today.

657
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:23,381
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

658
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,550
Um...

659
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:30,521
see, we lost Janey
earlier this year...

660
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:32,356
in a car accident.

661
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,566
I am so sorry
for your loss, Glenn.

662
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:46,770
I can't tell you how much
this breaks my heart.

663
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:49,807
She was a good peach,
that girl.

664
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,976
She was one of the best
of the bundle.

665
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:55,412
Yes, she really was.

666
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:57,781
And that's the thing is--

667
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:01,585
See, I got your Christmas card
this morning,

668
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:03,887
but how did you know Janey?

669
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,222
Because I don't remember
her doing any work--

670
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:07,992
Oh, my heavens.
She never told you.

671
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,333
Woman:
Thank you.

672
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,039
Seriously?

673
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:24,842
Serious as Santa
in a snowstorm.

674
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,878
My Janey blueprinted
the remodeling

675
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:31,215
of every single home
in this entire neighborhood?

676
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,050
It was over the year
after the flood came through.

677
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,552
You know, most of us
didn't have insurance.

678
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,154
Since we weren't
in a floodplain,

679
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:39,156
we didn't think
it could happen to us.

680
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:41,558
And Janey didn't charge
a one of us a dime,

681
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:43,727
even helped us
find cheap contractors

682
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,262
to do the labor, too.

683
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:49,967
I mean, come on, how did you
not notice how busy she was?

684
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,236
Then again, I thought she said
she had another job, too.

685
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:55,172
No, she was always
very, very busy

686
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:57,941
but she always made time
for me and the kids.

687
00:37:57,974 --> 00:38:00,678
She seemed like the kind of girl
who always somehow

688
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:04,114
found enough hours
in a day.

689
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:05,816
I just don't understand,
I don't know why

690
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:07,952
she never said
anything to us about this.

691
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,891
I can't say for sure,
but I will tell you this.

692
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,560
I've seen people
who are always preaching

693
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:19,063
about the things that others
should be doing

694
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,265
and keeping a spreadsheet
of every nice thing

695
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:24,068
they ever did for you
and always expecting

696
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,304
every good deed to come
with some big reward.

697
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:30,607
I mean, heck,
most kind gestures,

698
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,910
well, they come with a price.

699
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,012
Now, while there are still
others I've known

700
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:39,683
to do things--
good, kind, loving things,

701
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:41,752
who do them quietly

702
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:44,521
in the privacy of their own
hearts and minds--

703
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:48,492
simply because they believe
it's the right thing to do.

704
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:56,166
Elliot, Pheebs,
come here, guys.

705
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,702
Adelaide, come here, baby.

706
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:00,905
Come here, guys.

707
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:05,743
You take a look at every single
one of these houses, okay?

708
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,511
See them?

709
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:11,515
Your mother is responsible
for every one of these.

710
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:14,151
- Wow.
- Pretty cool, huh?

711
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:17,021
- Wow.
- Yeah.

712
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:24,328
Our mom was the coolest.

713
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,864
Yeah, she was.

714
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,767
- You guys are pretty cool, too.
- Thanks, Dad.

715
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,509
( sneezes )

716
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:43,147
Get back.
Now get back.

717
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:48,953
( Belle yelping )

718
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,429
- ( Belle whimpers )
- ( sneezes )

719
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,535
( dogs barking )

720
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:12,676
( bird squawks )

721
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,413
- Hello, bird.
- ( squawks )

722
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:19,183
Hello, there.
For heaven's sakes, Alberta.

723
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:23,887
Sorry about that.
We just weren't expecting
anybody,

724
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,423
- being Christmas Eve and all.
- ( sneezes )

725
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:28,325
Oh, that's okay.

726
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:32,296
Special occasions
call for special deliveries.

727
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,932
And what kind of special
deliveries do we have here?

728
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:38,903
Well, this little beast
needs to be put down.

729
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,239
Now why would you
want to have

730
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:44,741
a little looker like this
put down for?

731
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:47,945
She'd probably have no problem
finding a great home.

732
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,848
Oh, well, I was supposed to be
her forever home,

733
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,383
that's why I adopted her.

734
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:56,520
But then,
once I got her home,

735
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:59,523
I shortly realized that
she's a complete lost cause.

736
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:02,726
- A lost cause?
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:04,261
( sneezes )

738
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:06,396
How so?

739
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:11,301
Hmm? Well, um,
she killed my cat.

740
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:14,371
She killed your cat?

741
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:16,407
She's barely the size of a cat.

742
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:20,177
It was a very small cat.

743
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,113
A kitten.

744
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:25,849
Now are you sure we're
talking about the same dog?

745
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:27,584
This dog right here?

746
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:31,088
Oh, yeah, don't be deceived
by her charms, mister.

747
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:34,491
I am telling you,
this dog is a killer.

748
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:35,859
( squawks )

749
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:38,061
She even killed some birds.

750
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:40,998
Yep, in my back yard,
she killed these, like, parrots,

751
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,299
sparrow-looking things.

752
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,002
A bird killer, huh?

753
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,770
Well, I might just have to move
this one to the top of my list.

754
00:41:46,803 --> 00:41:49,172
Wonderful.
How soon can it be done?

755
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:51,542
Sunday morning, on account of
we're closed for Christmas.

756
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,111
Well, but you said
humanely, right?

757
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,648
I mean, I don't want her
to suffer or anything.

758
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,650
Mm-hmm.

759
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,052
( sneezes )

760
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,023
( sighs )

761
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,661
( humming )

762
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:11,896
( sighs )

763
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:41,525
Belle?
( claps )

764
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:47,398
Belle?

765
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:51,101
Belle!

766
00:42:55,271 --> 00:42:57,841
Where do you think you're going?

767
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,946
Shut up.

768
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:06,283
I'm not covering you for this
time
and you will be totally busted.

769
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:07,818
( sighs )

770
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,488
Why am I the only sane person
in my family?

771
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,858
All:
Belle.

772
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:17,561
- Belle?
- ( whistles )

773
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:19,663
Come here, Belle.
Come here, Belle.

774
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:22,633
- Hey, guys, no luck yet?
- No. Come on.

775
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,968
Let's you and I go this way
and you guys go that way.

776
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:29,740
Okay, fine, but do not go on the
road
unless you see Belle, okay?

777
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,975
- Don't leave our subdivision.
- Elliot: Yes, sir.

778
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:33,410
Elliot:
Belle? Belle?

779
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,050
Thank God you're back.
I don't know how to ice this
thing.

780
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,453
Don't worry,
I have it all under control.

781
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:47,891
- And the little dog, too?
- I told you, everything.

782
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:51,995
So you, like, killed it?

783
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:54,398
- No, I didn't kill it.
- Oh.

784
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:58,101
What kind of a monster
do you take me for?

785
00:43:58,134 --> 00:43:59,469
I took it to be euthanized.

786
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:03,106
Oh. Oh!

787
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:05,108
So I've exactly one hour

788
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:08,779
to get this cake tiered
into confection perfection

789
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,081
and then I got to pick up
the kids and Glenn,

790
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:14,418
hold them for about five minutes
while they cry

791
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,821
over the untimely disappearance
of their little mutt

792
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:20,424
and then bring them back here
in time for the contest,

793
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,694
where they can have a nice big
piece
of my red velvet cake.

794
00:44:24,694 --> 00:44:25,963
Hmm?

795
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:30,167
Thank you.

796
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,636
Elliot, we should turn back.

797
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:34,504
Maybe we passed her,

798
00:44:34,537 --> 00:44:36,674
or maybe your dad
and Phoebe found her by now.

799
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:40,010
( sighs )

800
00:44:40,043 --> 00:44:41,845
Hey, look, we're
gonna find her, okay?

801
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:44,948
I will help you look for her
every day until we do.

802
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:47,451
I pinky promise.

803
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:53,457
Okay, come on.
Let's get back to the house.

804
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,425
Riley:
Belle, Belle?

805
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,661
Glenn:
Hi, Kate, this is Glenn Barrows.

806
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,429
I'm calling about Belle.

807
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:01,865
It seems that she's gone missing
and we can't find her anywhere.

808
00:45:01,898 --> 00:45:04,468
Could you please give me a call
as soon as you get this message?

809
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,603
- Thank you.
- ( phone beeps )

810
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:08,038
Elliot, did you ask Malcolm

811
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:09,873
if he saw any sign
of Belle this afternoon?

812
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:11,374
His mom said he had to call back

813
00:45:11,407 --> 00:45:13,276
after they finished
Christmas dinner.

814
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:15,946
- Dad, we have to find her.
- I know, honey.

815
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,048
But there's nothing more
that we can do right now.

816
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,684
I still can't figure out
how she got out the front door.

817
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,586
I was sure we closed it.

818
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,788
Hey!
How's it going?

819
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:28,091
Are we all ready to go have
some delicious Christmas treats?

820
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:32,295
Oh, why the long faces?

821
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:34,131
It's Belle, she went missing
this afternoon.

822
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,465
We can't find her anywhere.

823
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:38,502
Oh.
Oh, that's just terrible.

824
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:41,805
Oh, well-- do you have any idea
where she could be?

825
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:43,807
No, we've been up
and down the block twice.

826
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,309
We've asked everybody,
nobody has seen any sign of her.

827
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:48,545
Dani:
Oh.

828
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:51,681
Maybe if you guys go to the
square,
you could ask around.

829
00:45:51,714 --> 00:45:53,917
Maybe somebody has
seen her running around.

830
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,452
That's not a bad idea.

831
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:57,521
But, Dad, I don't want
to go to the square.

832
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,724
If Belle comes back,
I have to be here.

833
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,827
Listen, I'm sure she's fine.

834
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,428
I'm sure we'll find her.

835
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:07,531
Let's just go up
to the square and see.

836
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,533
Maybe she's been
running around up there.

837
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:12,102
You're wasting
your breath, lady.

838
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:14,972
We ain't moving
till Belle's back.

839
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:19,276
Glenn, here.

840
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:24,147
Listen, why don't we
just leave the kids here?

841
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,482
You could call Marnie
and she could watch them.

842
00:46:25,515 --> 00:46:28,785
You know, 'cause this is my
thing.
I got to be there tonight.

843
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:31,154
I know that, but Marnie,
that's not gonna happen.

844
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:34,925
She has this midnight mass
with a lady she does every year.

845
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,627
I'm sorry.

846
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,129
( sighs )

847
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:42,432
Guys, see what she's wearing?

848
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:43,934
She wasn't wearing that
this morning.

849
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,405
She's obviously been back
to change since we left.

850
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,742
Bet she's the one who left
the door open-- on purpose.

851
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:55,445
Ahem.
Guys, listen.

852
00:46:57,046 --> 00:46:59,115
Why don't we go to the square

853
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:01,484
and we can put up
some missing puppy flyers?

854
00:47:01,517 --> 00:47:03,954
Okay, and then
in the morning I promise you,

855
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,789
we will go out and we will look
for Belle again.

856
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:10,227
But, Dad, if Belle comes back,
I have to be here.

857
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,396
Oh, Elliot, that's just
not gonna happen.

858
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:15,265
I mean, she's a puppy,
they're not that smart.

859
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:17,300
Who knows
where she could be?

860
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:20,370
I bet you know
exactly where she is.

861
00:47:20,403 --> 00:47:21,705
I'm sorry?

862
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,608
You took Belle.
We know it was you.

863
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,109
Pheeb, honey,
it's pretty obvious

864
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:27,978
that Belle went out
the open front door.

865
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:31,047
Probably because
she left it open.

866
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,682
I mean, you got to admit,

867
00:47:32,715 --> 00:47:35,619
it would be a lot easier for her
to reach the front door handle

868
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:39,189
than it would be for Belle to,
that's for darn sure.

869
00:47:39,222 --> 00:47:42,058
Phoebe, I haven't
been here today. Okay?

870
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:46,096
I mean, I left the house
before you did this morning.

871
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,732
Yeah? Well, you weren't
wearing that tacky dress

872
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,133
the first time you left.

873
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:52,369
Listen, I went to my house

874
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,238
and I changed my clothes
this afternoon, okay?

875
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:58,575
That's a lie. I saw that ugly
thing
the first night

876
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:02,012
when I was checking your bags
for narcotics and firearms.

877
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,713
You went through
my suitcase?

878
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:05,448
Phoebe, we do not
go through

879
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:08,118
other people's
private belongings.

880
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,819
You know better than that,
young lady.

881
00:48:09,852 --> 00:48:12,322
Dad, she doesn't even care
about us.

882
00:48:12,355 --> 00:48:14,324
She just wants you
because you're a hot catch

883
00:48:14,357 --> 00:48:15,692
and you have lots of money.

884
00:48:15,725 --> 00:48:18,728
That's it. Phoebe,
apologize to Dani right now.

885
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:20,530
No, Dad.
Phoebe's right.

886
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:22,532
Dani did something to Belle.

887
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:25,969
Just look at her,
it's written all over her face.

888
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:28,571
- Elliot, you are not helping.
- And neither are you.

889
00:48:28,604 --> 00:48:31,608
You're being blindsided
by that big-headed blonde.

890
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:33,410
( gasps )
Oh!

891
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:37,847
Guys, what is wrong with you?

892
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,983
Knock it off.

893
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:44,621
Do you know that Dani lost
her mother at Christmas, too?

894
00:48:45,655 --> 00:48:47,857
You need to think about
other people's feelings, too.

895
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,026
Maybe the holidays are tough
for other people as well.

896
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:52,829
- But, Dad, she--
- No, but nothing, Elliot.

897
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:55,332
Okay, Belle
is gone right now,

898
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,500
there's nothing
we can do about it.

899
00:48:57,533 --> 00:48:59,569
But if we're gonna accuse
somebody of doing something,

900
00:48:59,602 --> 00:49:02,172
you need to have evidence.

901
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,107
All right?
Then tomorrow, like I said,

902
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,143
we will go
and we will look for Belle.

903
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:08,979
In the meantime, you guys
are making me wonder

904
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,914
whether you were ever
responsible enough

905
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:14,651
to have adopted this dog
in the first place.

906
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:17,020
( Dani grunting )

907
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,126
Dani, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, Dani.

908
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:24,194
No.

909
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:27,297
Hey, hey, I am so sorry.

910
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:30,333
The kids, they didn't mean
the stuff that they were saying.

911
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:32,202
They didn't. They just--

912
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,005
I think they're just taking
this whole dog thing so hard

913
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:38,708
because they really
just miss their mom.

914
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:40,276
They do.

915
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:42,245
And your bakery contest thing,

916
00:49:42,278 --> 00:49:44,280
it sounds like a lot of fun.

917
00:49:44,313 --> 00:49:47,283
I get it. It's just--

918
00:49:47,316 --> 00:49:50,353
it's that I told all my
co-workers

919
00:49:50,386 --> 00:49:55,959
that they were gonna meet
this really great guy, you know?

920
00:49:55,992 --> 00:50:00,930
And it's all right,
I'll just be by myself.

921
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:05,969
Okay?
I'll just be all alone,

922
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:10,940
by myself like I always am.
I'm very used to it, it's okay.

923
00:50:10,973 --> 00:50:13,977
- All right?
- Dani.

924
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,312
Come on.
I feel terrible,

925
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:19,582
but what else can I do?

926
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:22,786
The kids won't go
anywhere without Belle

927
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,955
and I can't leave them
here alone.

928
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:30,794
Well, I mean, if you came
with me for just a little bit,

929
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:34,164
then you could
put up those signs.

930
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,933
I know somebody
who could look after them.

931
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:41,104
All right. Listen up.

932
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:44,774
You will do exactly as I say

933
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:47,377
or I will call the evil little
elves
to come and get you

934
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:49,612
and take you away
where you will be fed nothing

935
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:53,183
but clear-colored snow cones
without sugar

936
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,653
and placed on an assembly line
making fun toys

937
00:50:56,686 --> 00:51:01,591
for everyone but yourselves
year round. Got it?

938
00:51:01,624 --> 00:51:02,759
Good.

939
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:04,961
Now do you have any
caramel glaze in the kitchen?

940
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:09,132
Guys, we can't just sit here.

941
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,935
Belle has to be out there
somewhere right now

942
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,170
and might really need our help.

943
00:51:14,203 --> 00:51:17,440
Well, what do you
expect us to do?

944
00:51:17,473 --> 00:51:20,443
"Cheesecake Monster"
over there

945
00:51:20,476 --> 00:51:24,114
sure isn't gonna let us
out of her sights anytime soon.

946
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:27,417
I know. We just have to figure
out
a way to get out of here.

947
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,719
( phone ringing )

948
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,323
Hello?

949
00:51:35,224 --> 00:51:37,160
It's for you.

950
00:51:39,462 --> 00:51:41,731
But make it quick.

951
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:48,104
Is it Dad?
Did they find Belle?

952
00:51:48,137 --> 00:51:49,672
Not now.

953
00:51:49,705 --> 00:51:52,575
Malcolm: Sorry, Hambone.
I was eating turkey.

954
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:54,611
My mom says you called earlier.

955
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,679
It's Belle, we can't find her.

956
00:51:56,712 --> 00:51:58,581
What do you mean
you can't find her?

957
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:00,350
Elliot: She was gone tonight
when we got home.

958
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,018
And the front door was open.

959
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:03,786
You didn't see her
outside, did you?

960
00:52:03,819 --> 00:52:06,990
Nope, but I did see that
big-headed blonde over there

961
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:10,126
earlier this afternoon
when I was giving Penny Reiner

962
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:11,194
a Christmas Eve scare

963
00:52:11,227 --> 00:52:13,630
with my stampede string
of Black Cats.

964
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:16,966
She was here this afternoon?

965
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:20,637
Um, I mean,
you saw Belle where?

966
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,907
I said I saw
the big-headed blonde.

967
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,010
Yeah, I heard what you said,

968
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,745
but we actually
can't go looking

969
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:31,014
for Belle right now
unfortunately,

970
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:35,151
because my dad is not here
and we've a sitter.

971
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:36,819
You have a sitter?

972
00:52:36,852 --> 00:52:39,556
Yeah, a friend of my dad's
new girlfriend.

973
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,159
She's really nice, too.

974
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:45,662
Dude, you're freaking me out.

975
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,330
Are you in trouble
or something?

976
00:52:47,363 --> 00:52:50,366
Yeah, we're pretty bummed
about Belle, too,

977
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:53,236
but sure, an early Christmas
gift
from you

978
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:56,039
actually would lift my spirits,
I think.

979
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,875
Name the gift
and Santa will deliver.

980
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:01,678
Hey, no visitors tonight, okay?

981
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:03,580
Wait.

982
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:06,149
The babysitter says you can't
bring it tonight, though.

983
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,351
Santa don't wait for no sitter.

984
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:09,552
Wait, what's that?

985
00:53:09,585 --> 00:53:12,889
You got me the same thing
you got Penny Reiner?

986
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:14,390
Wow, thanks, Malcolm.

987
00:53:14,423 --> 00:53:18,962
I love that awesome collection
of, um... cat stamps.

988
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,664
"Operation Jingle Belle
Jailbreak"

989
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:25,335
is in T-minus 10 minutes
and counting.

990
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:32,208
So Malcolm said he thought

991
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:34,711
he saw Belle
in Mr. Polinsky's back yard.

992
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,680
Really?
You can see their back yard

993
00:53:37,713 --> 00:53:39,616
from your room upstairs.

994
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,351
I know, let's go.

995
00:53:58,067 --> 00:54:00,303
Belle!

996
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:04,140
Belle, if you can hear me,
wave one paw in the light.

997
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:07,744
Sorry, kids, but your dog
is not down in that yard.

998
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,646
Well, guess it's a good thing.

999
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,516
I was just worried about what
Mr. Polinsky swore he would do

1000
00:54:13,549 --> 00:54:16,019
if he ever caught our dog
in his back yard.

1001
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,755
What did he swear
he would do?

1002
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:22,125
Well, he said he would
take his .22 rifle

1003
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,227
and open fire
on our front lawn.

1004
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:03,399
But, Elliot, I always thought
Mr. Polinsky was so nice.

1005
00:55:03,432 --> 00:55:05,568
Huh, the craziest ones
usually are.

1006
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:07,103
Mal--

1007
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:09,172
Kimmy: Your neighbor,
he sounds like a real loony.

1008
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,606
If I were you, I'd move away

1009
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:12,809
before he decides to blow
this whole neighborhood.

1010
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,345
- ( popping )
- ( screaming )

1011
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:19,482
Kids, get down! It's not Santa!
Has Mr. Polinsky gone postal?

1012
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:25,121
Elliot, I'll meet you outside.

1013
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:30,927
Hurry, hurry.

1014
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,498
Rugrats?
Any of you still alive?

1015
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:39,602
- Wow. Good job, Elliot.
- ( Kimmy banging on door )

1016
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:41,637
Kimmy: What?
You guys tricked me!

1017
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,374
Yeah, and if you make
even so much

1018
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:47,210
as one peep while we're gone,
I'll call Santa

1019
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:51,481
and you'll be forced to shovel
reindeer poop for an eternity.

1020
00:55:57,086 --> 00:55:59,722
So what's next?

1021
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:01,090
Elliot's calling us a ride.

1022
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:03,126
Riley:
But where are we going?

1023
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:07,430
We're going to save Belle.
Come on.

1024
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:19,042
Ugh. what's taking
Grandma so long?

1025
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:23,380
( all laughing )

1026
00:56:29,218 --> 00:56:32,688
So I hear my merry
mischief makers

1027
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:35,858
need a little lift into town.

1028
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:39,562
It's like a fallen ice skater's
frostbit bottom out there.

1029
00:56:39,595 --> 00:56:41,598
Are you kids
getting in or what?

1030
00:56:49,138 --> 00:56:51,174
Okay, so now what?

1031
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:55,711
We need to get inside the bakery
and find Dani's purse.

1032
00:56:55,744 --> 00:56:57,447
What do we need
from her purse?

1033
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,248
Her address and her keys.

1034
00:56:59,281 --> 00:57:01,384
If she took Belle,
that's where she will be.

1035
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:05,054
Wait. What if we
run into Dani or your dad

1036
00:57:05,087 --> 00:57:09,125
moving through all these people?
We'll be totally busted.

1037
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:11,094
Good point.

1038
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:16,566
Phoebe, let's get eyes
on Dani and Dad, will you?

1039
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,201
Yeah, all right.

1040
00:57:24,573 --> 00:57:29,245
Excuse me, mister, I'm having
a hard time locating my father.

1041
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:31,314
Can I trouble you
for an elevator ride

1042
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,682
up to your top floor?

1043
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,317
Well, sure, kid,
and while you're up there,

1044
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,718
why don't you see
if they've got a Danish?

1045
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:38,254
I think they're gonna run out
before I can get to the table.

1046
00:57:38,287 --> 00:57:41,858
- Okay.
- Now, so you know, every
piece...

1047
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,928
Oh, yeah, there's
a big plate of them.

1048
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:48,565
...I will make. Yay!

1049
00:57:50,499 --> 00:57:53,770
All right, now the line starts
right here, right by Santa.

1050
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:58,475
Man down, man down!

1051
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,617
Did she see you?

1052
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,153
No, I don't think so. And we're
clear
if we go around back.

1053
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:13,189
Dad and Dani are at the front.

1054
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:18,160
Phoebe, wait.
Where are you going?

1055
00:58:18,193 --> 00:58:20,830
Phoebe: Don't worry.
Just get the keys and address.

1056
00:58:20,863 --> 00:58:23,099
I'll meet you around back
in 10 minutes.

1057
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,668
Okay.
Come on.

1058
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,540
( whistling "Jingle Bells" )

1059
00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:49,092
( whistling continues )

1060
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,355
( silent )

1061
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:06,535
Oh, this cheesecake
is amazing.

1062
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:09,338
Oh, I made the red velvet.

1063
01:00:09,371 --> 01:00:11,841
Oh, yeah, that's not bad either.

1064
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:15,044
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1065
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:17,246
It's so good.
Thank you.

1066
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,216
Oh. Oh, you got a bunch
in your-- right here.

1067
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:24,453
- Your-- let me see. Yeah.
- ( gasps )

1068
01:00:24,486 --> 01:00:27,356
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

1069
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:30,860
That's all right.
Mmm.

1070
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:34,263
Bingo.

1071
01:00:36,131 --> 01:00:37,700
Bingo.

1072
01:00:40,002 --> 01:00:42,005
I think I have it.

1073
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:47,843
5217 Spicewood Road.

1074
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:49,212
Got them.

1075
01:00:51,113 --> 01:00:54,417
( rattling )

1076
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,620
Someone's coming.
Hide!

1077
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:10,333
( sucking )

1078
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,144
( cell phone ringing )

1079
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,815
Ahem.

1080
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,384
Kate, hi.
Thanks for calling me back.

1081
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,520
Kate:
Sorry, I've been so busy

1082
01:01:31,553 --> 01:01:33,823
with Christmas stuff.
Have you guys found Belle?

1083
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,792
No, no, we have not yet,
unfortunately.

1084
01:01:36,825 --> 01:01:39,929
I'll come right over
and help you guys look.

1085
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,864
Yeah, I'd like that.

1086
01:01:41,897 --> 01:01:43,733
Kate: Great.
I'll be at the house in 15.

1087
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:45,868
We can drive the kids
around to find her.

1088
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:48,171
Glenn:
Okay, great.

1089
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:54,143
- ( phone beeps )
- Wow.

1090
01:01:57,179 --> 01:01:59,182
( floss squeaks )

1091
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,192
( sneezes )

1092
01:02:13,195 --> 01:02:14,764
Run!

1093
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:17,800
- ( screams )
- ( banging )

1094
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:21,270
( gasps )

1095
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:47,763
You mischievous
little mongrels!

1096
01:02:47,796 --> 01:02:50,099
I don't know if you think
you know what you're up to,

1097
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:53,469
but I can promise you,
you won't get away with it!

1098
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:55,738
Ugh!

1099
01:03:13,021 --> 01:03:14,223
Is everything all right?

1100
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:16,325
Oh, it's just all
powdered sugar.

1101
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:18,994
Yeah, I can see that.

1102
01:03:19,027 --> 01:03:21,330
- What?
- 'Cause--

1103
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:24,133
Oh, I'll be right back.

1104
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:26,502
Wait, wait,
Dani, Dani, wait.

1105
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:28,537
I really need to get back
for the kids

1106
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:31,106
'cause they're gonna be
so worried about Belle.

1107
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,442
Do you need to go clean up
or do you mind if I go back?

1108
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:37,346
No, no, you just--
you go on home.

1109
01:03:37,379 --> 01:03:40,049
It's okay.

1110
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:43,886
I'm sure the kids will be
waiting for you with bells on.

1111
01:03:43,919 --> 01:03:45,554
Well, just call me when you
want me to come pick you up.

1112
01:03:45,587 --> 01:03:48,424
- I'll just be a bit.
- Okay. Give me a call then.

1113
01:03:54,396 --> 01:03:55,831
That was a close call.

1114
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:57,132
That was awesome.

1115
01:03:57,165 --> 01:03:58,500
Phoebe,
where have you been?

1116
01:03:58,533 --> 01:04:01,871
Found Dad's car
down on the street corner,

1117
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,772
swiped his GPS.

1118
01:04:03,805 --> 01:04:07,176
How else were we gonna go
to Dani's house?

1119
01:04:07,209 --> 01:04:09,545
You're a genius.

1120
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:13,949
Okay, it's only
four blocks from here.

1121
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:17,553
We need to go that way.

1122
01:04:17,586 --> 01:04:20,990
Wait. How did you get
into a locked car?

1123
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:24,060
Where there's a woman,
there's a way.

1124
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,344
( sighs )

1125
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,916
Hey, Mom.

1126
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:49,318
Bet you're wondering
why I'm out here

1127
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:53,088
all alone at night
without Dad, huh?

1128
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:55,524
Well, don't worry too much.

1129
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:57,426
I'm not in too much trouble--

1130
01:04:57,459 --> 01:04:59,795
well, yet anyway.

1131
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:06,568
You see,
Dad let us adopt this dog

1132
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:08,604
and I named her Belle,

1133
01:05:08,637 --> 01:05:12,241
and she's this adorable,
cream-colored shepherd

1134
01:05:12,274 --> 01:05:14,410
and you would just love her.

1135
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:19,949
But I guess if you're
looking down on me,

1136
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,585
you probably already
know all of this, huh?

1137
01:05:24,853 --> 01:05:28,457
Well, I guess I just
wanted to let you know

1138
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,427
that no matter
where I go or what I do,

1139
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,398
every time you see me smile,
I think of you.

1140
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:39,068
Merry Christmas, Mom.

1141
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,103
We love you.

1142
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:54,616
- Glenn: Kate, hi.
- Hey.

1143
01:05:54,649 --> 01:05:56,418
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Yeah.

1144
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:58,654
- Sorry, it took me so long.
- No, it's fine.

1145
01:05:58,687 --> 01:06:01,857
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yeah, they didn't answer.

1146
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:03,659
Really?

1147
01:06:05,427 --> 01:06:07,096
Phoebe?

1148
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,999
Elliot?

1149
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,668
Kimmy? Hello?

1150
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:15,771
Oh.

1151
01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:18,474
Kate: Looks like someone
had a serious Christmas party.

1152
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:20,543
Kids?
What the heck?

1153
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,216
- Kimmy: Oh.
- Kimmy?!

1154
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,385
- Kate: Oh, my gosh.
- Are you okay?

1155
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,253
What happened to you?
Where are the kids?

1156
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:33,989
What happened to me
are those kids!

1157
01:06:34,022 --> 01:06:35,724
What do you mean?
Where are the kids?

1158
01:06:35,757 --> 01:06:39,028
- The kids did this to me!
- Where are the kids?

1159
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:41,163
I don't know.
They're probably looking for
that dog

1160
01:06:41,196 --> 01:06:42,698
they're all worried about.

1161
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:45,901
The kids think that Dani
did something to the dog.

1162
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:47,403
You don't think they went
to the bakery, do you?

1163
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,905
- I was just there.
- I don't know.

1164
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:52,207
But whatever they're doing,
it's probably illegal.

1165
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,575
Look, my kids
may be a handful

1166
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:55,544
but they would never do
something illegal.

1167
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:12,027
Okay, guys, let's look
for signs everywhere,

1168
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,797
anywhere that Belle
could possibly be. All right?

1169
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,204
- Okay.
- Okay.

1170
01:07:22,237 --> 01:07:24,139
I'm gonna take Mundy Lane
to Carlson Circle.

1171
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:26,408
Great. Okay, I'll take
Maple Drive to City Square.

1172
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:28,611
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

1173
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,681
You've got to be kidding me.

1174
01:07:41,623 --> 01:07:42,758
Jackpot.

1175
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:52,868
( switch clicks )

1176
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:54,736
Woman on recording:
Hello, Dani, this is Linda.

1177
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:57,639
Remember me?
Your mother?

1178
01:07:57,672 --> 01:08:01,176
You're treating your father and
me
like we're dead, but we're not.

1179
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:03,946
We're in Florida
and we thought we talked about

1180
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,881
you coming down
for the holidays.

1181
01:08:05,914 --> 01:08:07,783
Call me back.
Love you, dear.

1182
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:20,963
( both screaming )

1183
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:25,367
( both sigh )

1184
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:36,078
Belle?

1185
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,819
Belle?

1186
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:46,956
I thought you'd be here.

1187
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:56,198
Where are you, girl?

1188
01:08:56,231 --> 01:08:59,001
Hi, honey, we're just finishing
up here,
just cleaning up.

1189
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,836
I was wondering if you
could pick me up in 20?

1190
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:03,305
Yeah, okay, but, Dani,
have you seen the kids?

1191
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:06,141
- Have they been by there?
- No, I haven't seen them.

1192
01:09:06,174 --> 01:09:07,943
Okay, well, they left the house.

1193
01:09:07,976 --> 01:09:09,711
I'm out looking
for them right now.

1194
01:09:09,744 --> 01:09:11,947
If they come by,
will you please give me a call?

1195
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:16,218
Dani: Gosh, anything for your
kids,
honey, anything.

1196
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:18,120
- Okay, thanks.
- ( phone beeps )

1197
01:09:18,153 --> 01:09:19,955
Elliot:
Maybe Dad was right.

1198
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:22,524
Maybe Dani didn't
really take Belle.

1199
01:09:22,557 --> 01:09:26,128
And maybe we did just
imagine all this in our heads

1200
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:28,931
because we don't like
that Dad has a new girlfriend.

1201
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:33,335
Riley: But, Elliot, you weren't
imagining
that Dani is a terrible person.

1202
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:35,304
And just because Belle is not
here,

1203
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,773
doesn't mean Dani is not
responsible
for her disappearance.

1204
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:40,175
Yeah, she could have left
the front door open

1205
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:43,045
'cause she knew Belle would go
running outside looking for you.

1206
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:45,747
But, guys, it doesn't matter.

1207
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:49,051
Belle isn't here.
If she's not here,

1208
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,154
then I have no idea
where she could possibly be.

1209
01:09:52,187 --> 01:09:55,691
And if I can't find her,
then I can't save her!

1210
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:57,759
So what?
So Belle is not here.

1211
01:09:57,792 --> 01:10:00,362
So we go home and
start over again tomorrow.

1212
01:10:00,395 --> 01:10:02,397
Recruit more help
and start another search.

1213
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,967
And we keep looking for her
until we find her.

1214
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,070
The world doesn't
work that way, Riley.

1215
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:12,374
I keep looking and waiting
for my mom all the time.

1216
01:10:12,407 --> 01:10:15,911
But look around,
she's still not here, is she?

1217
01:10:15,944 --> 01:10:18,113
And it's 'cause
she's never coming back.

1218
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:20,816
( sobs )
And sooner or later,

1219
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:24,319
we need to accept
that Belle isn't either.

1220
01:10:24,352 --> 01:10:27,022
Elliot, you're right. Sometimes
rotten things happen to us,

1221
01:10:27,055 --> 01:10:29,124
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

1222
01:10:29,157 --> 01:10:31,627
But that doesn't mean we should
give up on everyone else

1223
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,695
who still loves us
and needs us.

1224
01:10:33,728 --> 01:10:35,998
I mean, what if Belle's
out there right now,

1225
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,167
and she's hurt or scared
and still needs our help?

1226
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,204
Do you really think Belle
would give up on you that easy?

1227
01:10:42,237 --> 01:10:45,274
Or would your mother have,
if she was still here?

1228
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,916
You know what?
You're right, Riley.

1229
01:10:54,949 --> 01:10:59,054
My mom would never have given
up.
So neither can we.

1230
01:10:59,087 --> 01:11:02,157
Christmas is still
the season of hope

1231
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:06,194
and Belle has to be
out there somewhere still,

1232
01:11:06,227 --> 01:11:08,163
and counting on us
to find her.

1233
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:11,967
- Then let's go get her.
- ( phone ringing )

1234
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,902
Dani on recording:
Hello, you've reached

1235
01:11:13,935 --> 01:11:16,371
the answering service
of Daniela Downy

1236
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:19,808
and although I can't get
to the phone at the moment,

1237
01:11:19,841 --> 01:11:21,476
please feel free
to leave me a pleasantry

1238
01:11:21,509 --> 01:11:24,579
- and I'll be sure to return it
soon.
- ( machine beeps )

1239
01:11:24,612 --> 01:11:26,348
Kimmy:
Dani, it's Kimmy.

1240
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:29,885
You wouldn't believe what those
snarky little tarts did to me.

1241
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,788
Anyway, I just wanted
to give you a heads-up.

1242
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,790
Their dad's looking
for them now.

1243
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,692
But I think they went
to find that dog.

1244
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,860
So you better call the pound
and make sure

1245
01:11:38,893 --> 01:11:40,796
they remove that pup
from visibility

1246
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,799
- until someone pulls the plug
on it.
- ( machine beeps )

1247
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:46,201
We have to get to the pound
before they close.

1248
01:11:46,234 --> 01:11:48,203
But they're probably
already closed.

1249
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:49,805
Then we break in.
We have to.

1250
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,206
There might not be
much time.

1251
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:53,508
Dani is trying
to have her put to sleep.

1252
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:56,011
But we can't put
the pound into the GPS

1253
01:11:56,044 --> 01:11:58,146
because we don't even know
where we're going

1254
01:11:58,179 --> 01:12:00,349
and we don't even have
their address.

1255
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:04,419
Right. We need someone
with a phone and a car.

1256
01:12:04,452 --> 01:12:05,587
Who do we know?

1257
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:09,791
Well, if we had proof,
we could call Dad.

1258
01:12:09,824 --> 01:12:12,694
No, it's too late.
We can't call Dad.

1259
01:12:12,727 --> 01:12:14,129
He's already out
looking for us,

1260
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:16,531
which means
we're in a ton of trouble.

1261
01:12:16,564 --> 01:12:18,834
Is there anyone else?

1262
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,869
Wait, I know someone.

1263
01:12:24,472 --> 01:12:26,341
We're not going.

1264
01:12:26,374 --> 01:12:28,944
Christy, no, you promised
you would take us to the pound.

1265
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:30,579
Yeah, well, that was
to get you in the car.

1266
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:33,081
I'm now 30 minutes late
for my champagne cider party

1267
01:12:33,114 --> 01:12:34,916
because of you,
and Troy already went without me

1268
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:38,153
because I had to pick up you
and your sweaty little friends
back there.

1269
01:12:38,186 --> 01:12:42,157
But, Christy, Elliot's dog's
life
is at stake here.

1270
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:45,327
If the dog is there, Elliot's
dad
can take them to pick it up
Sunday.

1271
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,429
Elliot:
Psst. Hey, Riley.

1272
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:51,400
20 bucks to prove you're right.

1273
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:54,803
And I know you need it
after Dad cut off your allowance

1274
01:12:54,836 --> 01:12:56,905
for failing algebra.

1275
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,551
It's locked.

1276
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,325
( all banging, screaming )

1277
01:13:17,358 --> 01:13:19,294
( dogs barking )

1278
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:27,302
Hey, mister, sorry to bother you
on Christmas Eve,

1279
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:29,671
but I think you have
our dog in there.

1280
01:13:29,704 --> 01:13:31,273
Oh, yeah?
What makes you think that?

1281
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:34,142
Well, we think the lady
dating our dad

1282
01:13:34,175 --> 01:13:36,578
dropped her off so you guys
could kill her.

1283
01:13:36,611 --> 01:13:38,313
How do you know
it's really yours?

1284
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:40,348
- Is it microchipped?
- Not yet.

1285
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:42,083
We've only had her
for a couple of days.

1286
01:13:42,116 --> 01:13:45,654
- What's it look like?
- She's a cream-colored
shepherd.

1287
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,189
Small, cute, fluffy.

1288
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:50,492
"Small, cute, fluffy."

1289
01:13:50,525 --> 01:13:52,494
No, I don't got
no cute dogs in here.

1290
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:54,296
She would have been
dropped off today

1291
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,098
by a big-headed blonde lady.

1292
01:13:57,131 --> 01:13:59,901
Oh, yeah, the bird-killer.

1293
01:13:59,934 --> 01:14:02,771
"Bird-killer"?
Belle never killed any bird.

1294
01:14:02,804 --> 01:14:04,272
How would you know?

1295
01:14:04,305 --> 01:14:06,007
You just said you've only
had her for a few days.

1296
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:09,211
Because I think I know
my own dog pretty well, okay?

1297
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:11,746
All right, fine.
That'll be 60 bucks

1298
01:14:11,779 --> 01:14:13,515
and you can buy
the little mutt back.

1299
01:14:13,548 --> 01:14:18,119
60 bucks?
We don't have 60 bucks.

1300
01:14:18,152 --> 01:14:20,455
Here, this is all we have left.

1301
01:14:20,488 --> 01:14:22,424
You don't got 40 more dollars,

1302
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:24,460
I don't got no bird-killer
for you.

1303
01:14:28,663 --> 01:14:31,166
Ugh. Now what?

1304
01:14:32,867 --> 01:14:35,337
Come on, I've got an idea.

1305
01:14:37,705 --> 01:14:42,244
TV announcer: ...the more
the muscle's gonna grow, okay?

1306
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,578
Take a look
at what I've done here.

1307
01:14:43,611 --> 01:14:45,647
No freaking way.

1308
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,417
Those toes just aren't
gonna pedicure themselves.

1309
01:14:49,717 --> 01:14:51,653
( dogs barking )

1310
01:14:56,257 --> 01:14:58,860
Hi.
My name is Christy Kane.

1311
01:14:58,893 --> 01:15:00,962
You know, like a candy cane?

1312
01:15:00,995 --> 01:15:03,632
- Hi.
- I'm sorry to bother you,

1313
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,867
but I was just on my way home
from this apple cider party

1314
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,570
and I just had
way too much cider, you see,

1315
01:15:08,603 --> 01:15:11,640
and I just don't think
I can wait till I get home,

1316
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,642
so may I use
your ladies' room?

1317
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,645
Yeah. My bird drinks
way too much apple cider, too.

1318
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,313
Come on.

1319
01:15:18,346 --> 01:15:20,616
( dogs whimpering, barking )

1320
01:15:40,401 --> 01:15:41,970
Bathroom is right
through there.

1321
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:45,607
Just holler at me if you need
any toilet paper or anything.

1322
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,175
Thanks.

1323
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:56,652
"Toilet paper." Stupid!

1324
01:15:57,685 --> 01:15:58,987
( Elliot whispers )
Belle!

1325
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:02,490
So how are we gonna get her?

1326
01:16:02,523 --> 01:16:04,726
You guys are
just gonna stay here

1327
01:16:04,759 --> 01:16:06,728
and when he goes back
in that office,

1328
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:09,531
we're just gonna sneak up
and spring him out really fast,

1329
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:12,233
so we all can run
right out of here, okay?

1330
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:14,736
But, Elliot, what about
the others?

1331
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:17,138
We can't just leave
the other dogs here.

1332
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:19,174
This is the pound.

1333
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,043
They'll all be doomed
unless we save them.

1334
01:16:22,076 --> 01:16:25,380
I know, but we can't fit
all of them in your sister's
car.

1335
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:26,715
There's not enough room.

1336
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,951
There's a bunch
of other dogs in here.

1337
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,354
We may not be able
to fit all of them

1338
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,422
in your fine sister's car,

1339
01:16:34,455 --> 01:16:37,258
but I bet we can fit
some of them

1340
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:40,161
into that pound van
we saw out back.

1341
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:43,231
We just need keys.

1342
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:45,433
And as it just so happens,

1343
01:16:45,466 --> 01:16:49,071
I happen to know
a really good key thief.

1344
01:16:57,211 --> 01:16:59,247
- All better now?
- Yeah.

1345
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,616
Thanks, I really appreciate you
letting me use your restroom.

1346
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:02,817
Yeah.

1347
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:05,553
Which translates to
I wouldn't stand on that toilet

1348
01:17:05,586 --> 01:17:07,556
in my cheapest pair
of shoes.

1349
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:11,693
And a very
merry Christmas to you.

1350
01:17:11,726 --> 01:17:13,562
Merry Christmas to you, too,
Miss Kane.

1351
01:17:16,397 --> 01:17:17,399
Ooh.

1352
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:20,068
( dogs barking )

1353
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:32,247
( dogs barking )

1354
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,182
( bird squawks )

1355
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:37,653
Huh.

1356
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:51,767
( bird squawks )

1357
01:17:57,405 --> 01:17:59,775
( silent )

1358
01:18:03,544 --> 01:18:07,015
Malcolm, now you pull the van up
so we can load.

1359
01:18:11,385 --> 01:18:14,155
Riley, you and I
will need to take one side.

1360
01:18:14,188 --> 01:18:15,724
We'll go down one by one

1361
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:18,760
till all the dogs
are out safely, all right?

1362
01:18:28,936 --> 01:18:30,505
( snoring )

1363
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:35,010
( barks )

1364
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,757
( dogs barking )

1365
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,425
Come on.

1366
01:18:51,559 --> 01:18:53,695
Phoebe, let's go!

1367
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:57,199
What are you kids doing?

1368
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:00,502
( dogs barking )

1369
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:13,582
Elliot:
Malcolm, let's move!

1370
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:19,154
( tires screech )

1371
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,322
( grunts )

1372
01:19:23,324 --> 01:19:26,862
( tires screech )

1373
01:19:33,367 --> 01:19:35,336
( sighs )

1374
01:19:35,369 --> 01:19:37,506
I have to call the police.

1375
01:19:45,913 --> 01:19:47,315
Malcolm...?

1376
01:19:49,183 --> 01:19:50,919
( engine starts )

1377
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,554
You okay, girl?

1378
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:55,657
I've been worried sick about
you.
It's good to have you back.

1379
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,559
You did all right tonight,
Elliot.

1380
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,360
I didn't think
you had it in you.

1381
01:19:59,393 --> 01:20:00,995
I did.

1382
01:20:01,028 --> 01:20:05,466
But, guys, how are we gonna feed
all these dogs tomorrow?

1383
01:20:05,499 --> 01:20:08,269
The pet stores won't be open
on Christmas.

1384
01:20:08,302 --> 01:20:09,871
We can call Kate
from the rescue.

1385
01:20:09,904 --> 01:20:11,573
She will know
what to do with them.

1386
01:20:13,307 --> 01:20:16,010
( horn honking )

1387
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:18,346
Malcolm:
Who is that following us?

1388
01:20:18,379 --> 01:20:20,882
I think it's that
crazy dog catcher.

1389
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:23,918
( honking continues )

1390
01:20:23,951 --> 01:20:27,088
Uh-oh.
Dad's on our trail now, too.

1391
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:31,659
Oh, man, if I get arrested,
my mom's gonna kill me!

1392
01:20:31,692 --> 01:20:33,995
Pull over before
he causes a wreck.

1393
01:20:34,028 --> 01:20:36,698
Now that we have Belle,
my dad will get us out of
trouble.

1394
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:40,268
Pull over right there!

1395
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:41,970
I'm trying!

1396
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,172
( horn honks )

1397
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:46,574
All:
Whoa!

1398
01:20:46,607 --> 01:20:48,309
( gasps )

1399
01:20:48,342 --> 01:20:51,546
( screams )

1400
01:20:53,314 --> 01:20:55,316
( brakes screech )

1401
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:58,353
No, not my cake!

1402
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:03,692
( screams )

1403
01:21:09,363 --> 01:21:10,598
( grunts )

1404
01:21:10,631 --> 01:21:12,533
Is everybody okay?

1405
01:21:12,566 --> 01:21:16,838
We're great, Dad.
Look, we even found Belle.

1406
01:21:16,871 --> 01:21:19,875
So how was your night?

1407
01:21:20,908 --> 01:21:22,343
Get out.

1408
01:21:22,376 --> 01:21:25,947
- You need some help up?
- Oh.

1409
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,523
But, Dad, we had
to take the other dogs

1410
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:37,626
or else
he was gonna kill them.

1411
01:21:38,626 --> 01:21:41,629
Elliot, that is not your place.

1412
01:21:41,662 --> 01:21:44,832
Okay, you should know
that stealing someone's vehicle

1413
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:47,302
is a very serious offense,

1414
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:50,171
especially if that vehicle
belongs to the city.

1415
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,943
Oh. Oh, you must be
from the pound.

1416
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:58,046
Yeah, look, I'm so sorry

1417
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,248
about any trouble
this might have caused you
tonight,

1418
01:22:00,281 --> 01:22:02,917
but it's a big mix-up.
See, this dog here,

1419
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,852
this actually is our dog.

1420
01:22:04,885 --> 01:22:06,354
Yeah?
Well, if you want it back,

1421
01:22:06,387 --> 01:22:08,723
it's gonna cost you,
Mr. Fancy Pants.

1422
01:22:11,926 --> 01:22:13,127
Um...

1423
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,931
Okay. How much for the dog,
and, you know,

1424
01:22:16,964 --> 01:22:20,735
to keep this little Christmas
incident
between the two of us?

1425
01:22:24,405 --> 01:22:27,676
What?
For that amount--

1426
01:22:31,312 --> 01:22:33,614
( chuckles )
Okay, okay.

1427
01:22:33,647 --> 01:22:36,317
Sure, that's just fine.

1428
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,319
No plastic.
No.

1429
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:41,122
No, of course.
All right.

1430
01:22:41,155 --> 01:22:42,157
Um...

1431
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,260
Thanks.
You can just return my van

1432
01:22:46,293 --> 01:22:48,997
after you transport the pups.
Enjoy them.

1433
01:22:54,068 --> 01:22:56,771
Thanks, Dad.
You're our hero.

1434
01:22:56,804 --> 01:22:58,106
Yeah.

1435
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,608
And sorry we left the house
without your permission.

1436
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:02,477
Well, that's okay,
actually I'm sorry.

1437
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:03,911
I apologize to you guys.

1438
01:23:03,944 --> 01:23:07,348
I should have never left you
on Christmas Eve.

1439
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:11,519
But, we still have plenty
to talk about, okay?

1440
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:14,756
And don't even think about
keeping any more of these dogs.

1441
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:17,825
We are not gonna do that.
We will, however,

1442
01:23:17,858 --> 01:23:21,462
find homes for each
and every one of them.

1443
01:23:21,495 --> 01:23:23,564
And you guys
will have plenty of time to look

1444
01:23:23,597 --> 01:23:25,800
because you're both grounded.

1445
01:23:28,869 --> 01:23:31,139
Wait, where's Belle?

1446
01:23:33,574 --> 01:23:35,377
Oh, no.

1447
01:23:36,844 --> 01:23:39,047
Oh, this is all your fault,

1448
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,015
you mangy, little
homewrecking--

1449
01:23:41,048 --> 01:23:42,750
( Dani screams )
Oh!

1450
01:23:42,783 --> 01:23:44,685
Back off,
big-headed blondie.

1451
01:23:44,718 --> 01:23:47,088
We know you lied
and we know you took Belle

1452
01:23:47,121 --> 01:23:49,590
and left her
at the pound to be killed.

1453
01:23:49,623 --> 01:23:51,859
Glenn, do you hear this?

1454
01:23:51,892 --> 01:23:55,229
Do you hear what they
are accusing me of?

1455
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:57,465
Dani: Oh, come on. What kind of
proof
do you have anyway?

1456
01:23:57,498 --> 01:23:59,801
It's all on this machine.

1457
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:03,538
Riley: Including a recent
message
from your mom,

1458
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:07,475
who must somehow
be calling from the grave...

1459
01:24:07,508 --> 01:24:09,744
or is it Florida?

1460
01:24:09,777 --> 01:24:12,980
Wait, you broke into my house
and you stole things?

1461
01:24:13,013 --> 01:24:16,818
It's not really breaking in
when you have the keys.

1462
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:21,055
Plus, we did it for the right
reason,
unlike you, who took Belle

1463
01:24:21,088 --> 01:24:25,693
and stole jewelry that was my
mother's
for your own gain, right?

1464
01:24:25,726 --> 01:24:28,029
Is that my wife's necklace?

1465
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:31,299
Um, I--
I was just trying it on

1466
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:33,401
and I was going to return it,

1467
01:24:33,434 --> 01:24:36,270
but I just--
I got busy with the cake

1468
01:24:36,303 --> 01:24:38,072
and the children's hospital
and everything.

1469
01:24:38,105 --> 01:24:39,841
I was just trying to--

1470
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,709
How do you
see yourself, Dani?

1471
01:24:42,943 --> 01:24:46,614
Are you one of those people
who expects some kind of reward

1472
01:24:46,647 --> 01:24:48,716
with every single good deed
that you do?

1473
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,121
Have you ever just one time
done something kind

1474
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:57,759
and loving just because
it was the right thing to do?

1475
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:03,364
I already have
my opinion on that.

1476
01:25:03,397 --> 01:25:05,300
May I have my wife's
necklace, please?

1477
01:25:10,404 --> 01:25:11,973
Let's go, kids.

1478
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:24,319
Your red velvet?
It needs work, too.

1479
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:27,989
She's right about
your red velvet, Dani.

1480
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:32,160
Oh, and by the way,
you're fired, dear.

1481
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:34,862
( sighs )

1482
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:37,132
( sobs )

1483
01:25:46,173 --> 01:25:49,210
Well, if it looks like a duck,

1484
01:25:49,243 --> 01:25:52,079
quacks like a duck,

1485
01:25:52,112 --> 01:25:55,216
it's probably a golddigger.

1486
01:25:55,249 --> 01:26:00,087
Maybe you ought to go on home,
see your folks.

1487
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,258
It is the holidays after all.

1488
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:10,231
I can't stand my folks.
That's why I'm like this.

1489
01:26:10,264 --> 01:26:13,401
'Tis the season to forgive,
little lady.

1490
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:17,305
Besides, I wouldn't
wait around for Santa.

1491
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:20,909
He's not gonna bring you
any gifts this year.

1492
01:26:23,911 --> 01:26:26,013
( sighs )

1493
01:26:26,046 --> 01:26:28,183
( sobbing )

1494
01:26:42,229 --> 01:26:45,266
- You all right there, Marn?
- Ooh.

1495
01:26:45,299 --> 01:26:48,569
Midnight mass
is still talking to me.

1496
01:26:48,602 --> 01:26:50,538
Ooh.

1497
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:51,772
( door bell ringing )

1498
01:26:51,805 --> 01:26:54,008
Ooh, that's probably Kate
from the shelter.

1499
01:26:57,344 --> 01:26:58,946
You kids sure lived up

1500
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:02,217
to your merry mischief maker
nickname this year.

1501
01:27:03,884 --> 01:27:06,154
Glenn:
Elliot, it's for you.

1502
01:27:15,462 --> 01:27:16,698
Elliot:
Hi.

1503
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,438
Hey.

1504
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:26,440
Guess what?
I can keep him.

1505
01:27:26,473 --> 01:27:28,376
Really?
That's awesome.

1506
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:32,380
Yeah, they were so terrified
that I wasn't in bed last night,

1507
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,715
so they couldn't say no.

1508
01:27:34,748 --> 01:27:36,517
( both laughing )

1509
01:27:50,964 --> 01:27:54,101
Thanks.
Rufus will love having this

1510
01:27:54,134 --> 01:27:56,037
on the days
we can't see Belle.

1511
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,139
Which hopefully
won't be many.

1512
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:00,107
Merry Christmas, Riley.

1513
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:02,009
Merry Christmas to you,
Elliot.

( cheering )

1524
01:28:48,655 --> 01:28:50,792
That was amazing.

1525
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:54,796
- Man: Oh, my pleasure.
- Wow.

1526
01:28:57,965 --> 01:28:59,700
Phoebe:
Merry Christmas.

1527
01:28:59,733 --> 01:29:01,869
Merry Christmas to you.

1528
01:29:11,345 --> 01:29:14,115
- Hi.
- Hey.

1529
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:17,051
How are the dogs?

1530
01:29:17,084 --> 01:29:19,153
They are safe and sound.

1531
01:29:19,186 --> 01:29:21,889
Right. Hey, well,
come on inside, please.

1532
01:29:25,192 --> 01:29:28,863
Everybody, please come on inside
for some eggnog,

1533
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:31,365
maybe a hot toddy,
some hot chocolate.

1534
01:29:31,398 --> 01:29:33,401
Glenn:
Come on, come on.

1535
01:29:39,873 --> 01:29:42,143
( silent )

1536
01:29:55,522 --> 01:29:58,459
( instrumental music playing )
