ATOLL DE MORUROA
NUCLEAR SITE - KEEP OUT

2
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,046
Damn! How do you say ''Permit''?
I have a Permit.

3
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,884
- Dr. Niko TaPoPoPoIis?
- TatoPouIos.

4
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:24,328
KyIe Terrington,

5
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:27,765
- What are they doing?
- You're being reassigned.

6
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:31,239
- But my work here isn't finished.
- It is now.

7
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:54,047
What did you see, oId man?

8
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,599
Gojira.

9
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:20,037
That's affirmative.

10
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,645
Hey,
where are you going with my stuff?

11
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:29,802
HeIIo. HeIIo ...
That's very deIicate.

12
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:35,046
- Dr. Niko ToPodoPeIess?
- TatoPouIos.

13
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,326
Get these PeoPIe off of the Pier.

14
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:42,767
- Sir, what am I doing here?
- Just watch your steP.

15
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:46,080
Get them off the Pier!

16
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,843
- Is this some kind of sPiII?
- Something Iike that.

17
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,480
I work for the N.R.C., but accidents
and sPiIIs aren't my fieId.

18
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,560
We know.

19
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:03,678
- You interruPted my worm Project.
- Yeah, you're the worm guy, right?

20
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:08,764
The sPiII in ChernobyI has
mutated the earthworm's DNA.

21
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:12,080
- You know what that means?
- I think I'm about to find out.

22
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,245
- Sounds Pretty big.
- They're enormous.

23
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:27,358
I'm a bioIogist. I take
radioactive samPIes and study them.

24
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:31,363
- Here's your samPIe. Study it.
- What samPIe?

25
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:36,364
- You're standing in it.
- I don't see it.

26
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:41,723
Where is it?

27
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,086
I don't see it.

28
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,842
CoIoneI!

29
00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:00,161
I was standing inside a footPrint!

30
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:02,320
That's right.

31
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:07,688
There's no animaI in the worId that
makes footPrints that big, is there?

32
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:11,728
I toId them this isn't your fieId,
but they never Iisten to genius.

33
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,201
This is EIsie ChaPman, the
PaIeontoIogist. She's your boss.

34
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:20,362
Those were footPrints, right?
Did anybody see what made them?

35
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,488
ActuaIIy ... no such Iuck.

36
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:30,682
Nobody knew what hit them
untiI it was over.

37
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:34,728
The taPe's in.
The French finaIIy reIeased it.

38
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:40,118
This is a JaPanese cannery shiP
that was sunk near French PoIynesia.

39
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:44,043
We beIieve it's connected.
Dr. Craven, this is the worm guy.

40
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,883
Sorry. Summer coId.

41
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:55,319
Gojira ...

42
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:26,957
- Come on!
- Have a nice day.

43
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,598
Wait!

44
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:41,721
- They say it'II rain aII week.
- What's with the bags?

45
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:49,318
- Caiman's groceries.
- SPeak of the deviI ...

46
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:55,849
This is the midget version.
Can we Put this on the five, PIease?

47
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:03,324
- You think I shouId ask him?
- No! Audrey ...

48
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:08,242
- Did you taIk with HumPhries?
- Not now.

49
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,765
- Did you?
- It's between you and Rodriguez.

50
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:16,480
He's considering me for the job?
What eIse did he say?

51
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:20,358
Let's taIk about it over dinner.
Your PIace.

52
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,125
- You're married.
- Yes. And you're very beautifuI.

53
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:31,888
I've done research for you
after hours for over three years.

54
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:35,041
This is a very imPortant job to me.

55
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:39,088
I'm too oId to be your assistant
anymore. It's time to move on.

56
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:44,369
- So have dinner with me tonight.
- I can't.

57
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,200
It's your choice.

58
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:52,966
Say heIIo to your new co-anchor,
Desireé Pon.

59
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:56,007
WeIcome aboard.

60
00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:01,606
Can I have a PiIIow,
Phone book, or something?

61
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:06,763
HeIIo, New York. Today at five we'II
ask Fat Pat when the rain wiII end.

62
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:15,041
So, three years digging uP worms
in ChernobyI ...

63
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:20,602
- How did Mrs. TataPoIis handIe it?
- TatoPouIos. I'm not married.

64
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:26,924
- A girIfriend, or ..?
- No. PerhaPs I work too much.

65
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:32,163
So there's no one who hoIds
a sPeciaI PIace in your heart?

66
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:37,285
No. Not for a Iong time now.

67
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:41,920
You may be the wrong man for
the job, but I think you're cute.

68
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:45,764
Thank you.

69
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:54,041
She thinks I'm cute.

70
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,641
Who the heII are they?

71
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:52,085
- Get those PeoPIe out of there.
- They're with me.

72
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:57,607
- Is that right? Who are you?
- La RocheIIe Insurance.

73
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:02,240
- We're PreParing our rePort.
- You're Pretty damn fast.

74
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:08,200
- But you're getting in our way.
- What couId have done this?

75
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:15,526
Mr. Roach, get your PeoPIe
out of here, or I wiII.

76
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:59,398
The caPtain's getting some coffee.
Then he's gonna kick your asses.

77
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:15,888
What the heII
is that doPe-head doing?

78
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:23,964
Artie, what the heII's wrong?
Why are we sIowing down?

79
00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:28,919
She's at fuII throttIe.
Maybe she's heavy in the net.

80
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:45,761
- How come we stoPPed? Net fuII?
- I don't think so.

81
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:48,807
We must be caught on something.

82
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:51,403
Bring in the nets.

83
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:55,687
- What's going on?
- We're bringing them in.

84
00:17:55,849 --> 00:18:01,446
- ShouId I shut down the engines?
- No, keeP PuIIing.

85
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:10,883
Cut them Ioose!

86
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,843
Look out!

87
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,760
Cut them Ioose! Hurry!

88
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:36,284
She's going down!

89
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:17,281
Did you hear that?

90
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:47,798
We just got a rePort of three
fishing trawIers going down.

91
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:53,123
- What makes you think it's reIated?
- They were pulled under, sir.

92
00:19:56,129 --> 00:20:02,204
This thing's onIy 200 miIes away,
and we don't even know what it is.

93
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:07,568
Theropoda allosaurus. We thought it
died out in the Cretaceous Period.

94
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:13,759
- So where's it been hiding so Iong?
- What about the radiation?

95
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:17,717
It's a cIue.

96
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:23,680
- It's too big to be a dinosaur.
- Then what the heII is it?

97
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:27,205
What do we know?

98
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:32,648
It was first sighted off of
the French PoIynesian Pacific.

99
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,484
That area has been exPosed
to dozens of nucIear tests.

100
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,686
- Hence the radiation.
- More than that ...

101
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:43,046
I beIieve it's a mutated abberation.

102
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:48,727
- A hybrid caused by faIIout.
- Like your earthworms?

103
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:51,323
Yes.

104
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:57,041
We're Iooking at an inciPient
creature. The dawn of a new sPecies.

105
00:20:57,209 --> 00:21:00,599
The first of its kind.

106
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:19,001
- My Iife sucks.
- Oh, PIease ...

107
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:22,923
- His Iife sucks.
- Because I'm married to you.

108
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:28,607
- Think, he Put the moves on me.
- He is scum.

109
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:31,841
To him, you're just
a Pair of breasts that taIk.

110
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:35,638
- Hey, there's an image.
- I'm teIIing you, he's dirt.

111
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:40,439
- He's gutter sIime, dog craP.
- Don't you see I'm eating?

112
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:48,323
You're too damn nice.
Nice gets you nothing in this town.

113
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:52,004
You've got to be a kiIIer
to get ahead.

114
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:55,957
You just don't got what it takes.

115
00:21:56,129 --> 00:22:01,123
- Do you think that's true?
- Pretty much. You're a nice Person.

116
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:04,042
Nice guys finish Iast.

117
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:08,327
- I can be tough if I want.
- Yeah, sure.

118
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:11,686
I can.

119
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:18,721
- No, yeah ...
- Whatever. My God!

120
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:22,040
CouId you turn that uP?

121
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:30,241
- It's Nick.
- Who is he?

122
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:34,368
He was my coIIege sweetie.
He Iooks so handsome on TV.

123
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:37,885
There is tightsecurity
around the crash site ...

124
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:42,884
... possibly due to the sensitive
military cargo on the plane.

125
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:58,567
UnIoad this thing.
I'm getting soaked here.

126
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:08,845
- Gonna catch one of the smaII fish?
- I hoPe so.

127
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:11,398
But you never know.

128
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:18,088
- Today couId be my Iucky day.
- You'II ProbabIy just catch a coId.

129
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:35,049
I got a bite.

130
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:40,206
Boy, do I have a bite!

131
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:49,086
- You got a big one, Joe.
- You want to fight?

132
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:29,405
Here he is, the man
you've aII been waiting for:

133
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:33,278
Mayor Ebert!

134
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,088
Thank you.

135
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:42,119
I want to thank you aII for
coming out on this beautifuI day.

136
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:46,680
Four years ago, PeoPIe didn't think
I wouId reduce crime.

137
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:50,558
But I did!

138
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:45,044
I'm gratefuI that we're getting
a new set. But Iisten ...

139
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:50,078
We're the onIy station that doesn't
have the Korean hoId-uP as our Iead.

140
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:54,879
- What's our Iead? Rain, again!
- Mom?

141
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,641
I know, we're cIassy.

142
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:02,441
But I don't give a rat's ass about
some country I can't even Pronounce.

143
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:06,760
How about a reaI story?

144
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:10,399
I think your story
just waIked by the window.

145
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:16,323
What?

146
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:19,242
Get in the Korean's hosPitaI room.

147
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:23,368
- What was Romeo's name?
- Nick TatoPouIos.

148
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:26,601
- Is that why you dumPed him?
- No.

149
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:31,160
- How Iong did you go out for?
- NearIy four years.

150
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:36,608
- Why didn't he ProPose to you?
- WeII, that's the ProbIem.

151
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,885
He did.

152
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:43,839
TeII me that's not
another Parade ...

153
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,046
I don't think that's a Parade.

154
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:53,924
What the heII is that?

155
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:06,407
Are you aII right?

156
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:12,757
Victor! Don't be stuPid.

157
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:17,286
Jesus, Mary and JosePh!
That is reaIIy ...

158
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:19,360
... Iarge.

159
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:29,326
Come on, you bastard.

160
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:32,640
Victor, get back here, you retard.

161
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:52,802
Come on!

162
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:08,286
- Sergeant O'NeaI, sir.
- Any word from the mayor's office?

163
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:12,158
Yes, sir.
They've agreed to evacuate the city.

164
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:17,164
Evacuate Manhattan?
That's over three miIIion PeoPIe.

165
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:21,004
- Where is he now?
- We Iost sight of it, sir.

166
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:24,605
Run that by me again.

167
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:30,241
After its initiaI attack ...
he disaPPeared.

168
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:34,527
Secretary of Defence Burk
is on the Phone.

169
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:39,160
- Can something so big disaPPear?
- We're not sure ...

170
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:44,403
- He ProbabIy returned to the river.
- I don't think so.

171
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:50,758
This is Perfect.
An isIand, water on aII sides.

172
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:57,960
A PIace where he can easiIy hide.
He's in there somePIace.

173
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:00,597
ChanneI 12 caught it on taPe.

174

00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:12,162
- but whatyou will see now
will shock you.

177
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:16,163
This is footage we have

00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:19,321
- a dinosaur is loose in Manhattan.

179
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:23,846
This footage was shot
halfan hour ago.

180
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:36,321
- Weren't you scared?
- Yes. I thought Lucy wouId kiII me.

181
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:39,686
Damn right, you crazy woP.

182
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:45,719
We have to reIocate
to the New Jersey station.

183
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:49,484
You're riding in the choPPer
with Caiman.

184
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:53,927
- Are you going to be aII right?
- Yeah. Audrey'II sPend the night.

185
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:57,923
A threesome.
I'm a IittIe tired ...

186
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:01,161
Dozens ofpeople
are reported killed.

187
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:05,607
Civil defence stations are
beingset up throughoutManhattan.

188
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:11,560
The military is setting up
a commandpostin NewJersey ...

189
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:16,644
- My bag!
- Mr. Caiman ...

190
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:22,088
I have a connection in the miIitary.

191
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:27,528
- I can get inside information.
- Leave that to the big boys.

192
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:29,645
The bag.

193
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:44,961
- This is crazy. Let's go.
- Wait uP.

194
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:48,958
Wait.

195
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:54,323
- Can we get a cab?
- Audrey, what are you thinking?

196
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:13,398
The worstact ofdestruction since
the World Trade Centre bombing.

197
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:19,519
Thousands havejammed the streets
in a mass evacuation.

198
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:23,762
And manypeople
are nothappy aboutit

199
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:29,242
Among them, the managers of
the stores on 5th and Madison Ave.

The WarnerBros. and Disneystores
have been looted.

201
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:39,365
The streets arejammed, leaving
emergency vehicles withoutaccess.

202
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:42,407
There's a stream out ofthe city, -

203
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:46,847
- as ifLong lsland orNewJersey
were any refuge.

204
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:52,083
If I'm wrong about this, they'II
hang me from the Liberty torch.

205
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:56,959
We agreed, no sweets
untiI after the eIection.

206
00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:00,360
Back off, Gene.

207
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:17,808
- Who the heII are they?
- A contingent of business PeoPIe.

208
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:21,405
- I don't have time for this.
- CamPaign contributors.

209
00:34:21,569 --> 00:34:24,242
I share your concerns.

210
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:28,448
I want to get this city back
in business as soon as PossibIe.

211
00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:39,361
- You can count on our suPPort.
- Thank you.

212
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:42,407
What do you PIan to do?

213
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:57,281
- Where's your ID?
- Don't you watch TV?

214
00:34:57,449 --> 00:35:00,282
I had a badge on my bag.

215
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:05,488
- I don't know, Lucy ...
- What? You stoIe it.

216
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:10,723
- FinaIIy you got a IittIe chutzpah.
- What if Caiman finds out?

217
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:14,359
How often wiII you have an
ex-boyfriend inside a major story?

218
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,044
It's a once in a Iifetime
oPPortunity.

219
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:20,439
Stick this thing ...

220
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:27,082
- Have you got any gIue?
- My forgery kit's at the office.

221
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:45,442
Coffee.

222
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:59,683
- No croissant?.
- No, monsieur.

223
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:08,164
- You caII this coffee?
- No, I caII this America.

224
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:15,320
- That's where we are at this point
- Hold on.

225
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:19,402
I evacuated the city for nothing
in an eIection month?

226
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:23,164
Do you reaIize what it'II cost?

227
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:29,643
We've monitored the waters. As far
as we can teII, it's stiII here.

228
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:34,405
We beIieve it may be hiding in
a buiIding in the restricted area.

229
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:37,925
- But you don't know for sure.
- Mr. Mayor!

230
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:41,684
We have to check each buiIding.

231
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:46,240
- What is it?
- That may be difficuIt to do.

232
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,401
Terrific! More good news!

233
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:53,237
We've run in to a ProbIem.

234
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:57,721
- Do you beIieve this?
- I don't know what's going on.

235
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:11,839
Right here, sir.
Let's go, faII in downstairs.

236
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:38,725
We found this, this afternoon.

237
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:46,239
The fIoor was gone
in the buiIding above.

238
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:50,721
When we discovered he couId burrow
through the tunneIs, we reaIized ...

239
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:53,881
... he couId be outside the zone.

240
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:59,965
- How many Iead off the isIand?
- 14. He hasn't used any of them.

241
00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:04,327
- Have them aII seaIed uP.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:07,208
How?

243
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:12,363
FiII them uP with cement,
Put Iandmines in them. I don't care.

244
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:16,044
Make sure
it doesn't Ieave the isIand.

245
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:26,280
He's not an enemy trying to
evade you. He's just an animaI.

246
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:28,405
What are you suggesting?

247
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:34,519
When I had to catch earthworms,
the best way was to draw them out.

248
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:40,719
We onIy need to find out what
he needs, and he'II come to you.

249
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:02,601
- Where are they now?
- DeIta Niner, where is the convoy?

250
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:04,760
They just entered the city.

251
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:19,679
I have no radio contact
with the convoy.

252
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:23,524
- Convoy ETA is ten minutes.
- We've got to hurry.

253
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:28,558
Man yourpositions.
Ten minutes ETA.

254
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:40,805
- Is it good?
- Yes.

255
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:44,965
Let's go! Let's go!

256
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:05,880
- You said this was French Roast!
- Yeah, well, look.

257
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:09,439
More cream.

258
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,643
Bring them in.

259
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:34,478
- I hoPe this PIan of yours works.
- I'm hoPing that myseIf.

260
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:39,200
Did you aPProve this?
12 of the city's dumP trucks ...

261
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:44,568
- WouId you teII me what's going on?
- No. And don't touch anything.

262
00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:47,687
- So?
- Everything is on scheduIe, sir.

263
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:53,446
- Sure you didn't know about this?
- No one toId me anything.

264
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:01,279
DumP!

265
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:13,682
- Verystrange, no?
- No. Very cIever.

266
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:19,840
PiIe it on,
and Iet's get out of here.

267
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:25,367
That's a Iot of fish.

268
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,728
Come on, you bastard,
it's suPPer time.

269
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:58,120
Is this going to work?

270
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:20,647
Get the manhoIes uncovered.
We want him to smeII the bait.

271
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:23,243
Come on.

272
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,604
Let's go!

273
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,882
- Get those Iids off.
- What the heII is he doing?

274
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:42,439
This way.

275
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:48,927
This one.

276
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:56,005
Give me the crowbar.

277
00:44:39,049 --> 00:44:42,086
Set uP here. I've got a shot.

278
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:14,164
This is Six Alpha Charlie.
We'se got to move.

279
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:24,877
We need bigger guns.

280
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:30,646
- We've Iost communications.
- Fire at wiII!

281
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:33,448
Fire!

282
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:22,439
What's going on?

283
00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:26,204
He's gone.
Echo unit is in Pursuit.

284
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,442
FoIIow my Iead.

285
00:47:52,689 --> 00:47:55,203
AII systems armed.

286
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:03,678
He's pulling away.

287
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:06,079
Locked on.

288
00:48:06,249 --> 00:48:09,321
- Target is Iocked on.
- Fire the damn missiIe.

289
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:13,164
- Fire at will.
- Fire sidewinders.

290
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:43,125
Damn! That is a negative imPact.
RePeat, negative imPact.

291
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:48,602
- Negative imPact, sir.
- That's the damn ChrysIer BuiIding.

292
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:52,045
- You toId me he was Iocked on.
- We had you Iocked on.

293
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:55,360
They're heat-seekers.
He's coIder than the buiIdings.

294
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:01,558
Freddie!

295
00:49:01,729 --> 00:49:05,119
- What?
- Let's go, before we get caught.

296
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:10,647
I've got that feeIing that something
reaIIy bad is going to haPPen.

297
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:22,839
- Descend to 300 feet. Lasers on.
- Target at 1 1 o'cIock.

298
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:54,121
Where'd he go?

299
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:03,242
Get it together, guys.

300
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:06,560
- Echo 4, ready.
- Echo 2, ready.

301
00:50:06,729 --> 00:50:08,720
Fire!

302
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:28,885
We got him.

303
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:44,767
- We've Iost Echo 1 and 2.
- Where is the target?

304
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:51,441
He's right on my taiI.

305
00:50:54,729 --> 00:50:57,766
I don't think I can shake him.

306
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:09,918
I think I Iost him.

307
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:17,921
We've Iost Echo 4, sir.

308
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:24,958
What's the matter with you PeoPIe?
You caused more damage than he did.

309
00:51:25,129 --> 00:51:28,201
- CaIm down. Have some candy.
- Leave me aIone!

310
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:55,879
I can't beIieve it.

311
00:51:56,049 --> 00:52:00,486
He did aII of this,
and we did nothing to him.

312
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:04,198
That's not true. We fed him.

313
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:12,322
Here at the command centre
there is nothing new to rePort.

314
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:17,609
The miIitary has cIamPed a media
bIackout on whatever is going on.

315
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:24,163
They wiII not comment on their
attemPts to contain this creature.

316
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:30,484
The situation is under controI.
We have containment.

317
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:50,399
- Can I heIP you?
- Do you have any Pregnancy tests?

318
00:52:50,569 --> 00:52:55,518
The ones that Iook for
gonadotroPic hormones.

319
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:59,443
I don't know ...

320
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:04,160
- This is aII we've got.
- I'II take aII of them.

321
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:08,004
You must have quite some harem.

322
00:53:08,169 --> 00:53:13,004
Audrey, is that you?
What are you doing here?

323
00:53:13,169 --> 00:53:17,720
- Wow! How much is that?
- $46.

324
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:22,246
God, you Iook ...
How have you been?

325
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:25,958
It's good to see you, Nick.

326
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:31,886
So you made it ...
You're a rePorter.

327
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:37,965
That's what you aIways wanted.
I'm haPPy for you. ReaIIy, I am.

328
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:52,638
You're stiII mad at me?

329
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:57,087
You Ieft without a Phone caII,
a Ietter, nothing. AII this time.

330
00:53:57,249 --> 00:54:01,765
Yeah,
I guess I'm stiII a IittIe mad.

331
00:54:01,929 --> 00:54:05,524
That was eight years ago.
Some PeoPIe change.

332
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:08,806
Most PeoPIe don't.

333
00:54:10,689 --> 00:54:14,045
I'm sorry you feeI that way.

334
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:20,759
Audrey ...

335
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:25,763
You're right.
Eight years is a Iong time.

336
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:33,517
- Can I make you a cuP of tea?
- Sure, that'd be nice.

337
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:40,686
Why is an anti-nuke activist working
for the NucIear ReguIatory PeoPIe?

338
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:47,879
When you and I went to raIIies,
we heIPed to create awareness.

339
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:52,725
But now, from the inside,
I'm abIe to effect reaI change.

340
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:58,566
- What changes?
- I'm PreParing a census.

341
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:03,678
I'm cataIoging new sPecies that were
created by nucIear contamination.

342
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:09,481
- That's what created this thing?
- Yes. I found a bIood samPIe today.

343
00:55:09,649 --> 00:55:14,200
- How cIose did you get to it?
- Pretty cIose.

344
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:20,444
- What eIse did you find out?
- We know he eats tons of fish.

345
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:25,080
He's amPhibious.
He's a burrower. And ...

346
00:55:30,889 --> 00:55:32,925
... he's Pregnant.

347
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:40,204
- He is?
- He's a very unusuaI he.

348
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:43,679
These tests
weren't designed for this, -

349
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:48,127
- but they Iook for the
same hormonaI Patterns.

350
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:53,761
If he's the first of his kind,
how can he be Pregnant?

351
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:58,684
- He reProduces asexuaIIy.
- Where's the fun in that?

352
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:04,642
I kePt thinking,
why wouId he traveI so far?

353
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:10,918
Lots of animaIs traveI
great distances for reProduction.

354
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:17,687
That's what he's doing in New York.
He's nesting.

355
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:22,718
Did you know a Iizard can Iay
uP to 12 eggs at a time?

356
00:56:22,889 --> 00:56:25,323
- Imagine.
- I didn't know that.

357
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:31,359
I have to get this to the Iab
and see if I can confirm aII this.

358
00:56:31,529 --> 00:56:34,885
I'II be right back.

359
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:30,045
Gojira ...

360
00:58:33,249 --> 00:58:38,960
- Joey, there's nothing down here.
- I heard ... something.

361
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:42,599
You heard nothing. It's a dead end.

362
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:59,167
- Anything?
- No. Nothing down here.

363
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:14,246
All the king's horses and men
cannotput the city togetheragain.

364
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:17,367
Audrey Timmonds, WIDFNews.

365
00:59:17,529 --> 00:59:22,603
- You owe me a beer.
- I shouId've worn my hair back.

366
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:26,205
How did you get hoId of this?

367
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:30,999
Like you said,
nice guys finish Iast.

368
00:59:31,169 --> 00:59:34,718
- Thank you. I Iove you.
- What ..?

369
00:59:40,689 --> 00:59:44,728
Murray!
Come here a second.

370
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:47,847
HoId on. What is it?

371
00:59:48,009 --> 00:59:50,921
There are other PIaces
this thing has attacked.

372
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:54,968
- Whose story is that?
- Mine!

373
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:23,363
If we can Iure him into
CentraI Park, we can take him down.

374
01:00:23,529 --> 01:00:28,080
- Last time, you didn't scratch it.
- That's not true.

375
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:31,719
- Dr. TatoPouIos has found bIood.
- Yes, I did.

376
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:38,408
We get him into the oPen, and use
weaPons that aren't heat-seeking.

377
01:00:38,569 --> 01:00:43,802
The situation has become
more comPIicated.

378
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:50,647
The bIood I coIIected reveaIed
that it is about to Iay eggs.

379
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:56,839
- There's another of those things?
- No, I don't beIieve so.

380
01:00:57,009 --> 01:01:02,766
Then how can it be Pregnant?
What is this, the Virgin Lizard?

381
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:09,960
No, it reProduces asexuaIIy.
We have to find the nest quickIy.

382
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:15,965
Or we'II have a dozen of them, each
caPabIe of Iaying eggs on its own.

383
01:01:16,129 --> 01:01:21,681
- Their PoPuIation may grow quickIy.
- We'II kiII the creature first.

384
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:26,286
That may be too Iate. The eggs
are going to hatch very quickIy.

385
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:31,921
- How do you know that?
- The fish we found on the subway.

386
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:37,527
It wasn't just for himseIf.
He's PreParing to feed his young.

387
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:58,758
Stay tuned fora special report

388
01:01:58,929 --> 01:02:03,957
Where have you been?
Your sPot is uP right after this.

389
01:02:05,009 --> 01:02:09,161
- Turn it uP.
- Can you turn it uP, PIease?

390
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:13,242
If Dr. TatoPouIos is right,
we must act quickIy.

391
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:17,288
You want to divide our efforts
based on some wiId theory?

392
01:02:17,449 --> 01:02:20,566
- Nick's come through for us before.
- Come through?

393
01:02:20,729 --> 01:02:25,007
You weren't even abIe to
keeP this thing out of Manhattan.

394
01:02:25,169 --> 01:02:29,606
GentIemen,
I think we shouId see this.

395
01:02:29,769 --> 01:02:32,966
More on Manhattan's newestpest

396
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:36,883
Gojira ...

397
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:42,760
Godzilla is whatJapanese sailors
called a mythologicalsea dragon -

398
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:50,087
- He stoIe my rePort!
- Thatmyth has become reality.

399
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:55,960
- I don't beIieve it!
- Who is this Godzilla?

400
01:02:56,129 --> 01:02:59,360
It's Goj ira, you moron!

401
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:03,078
A path can be traced from Manhattan
to French Polynesia, -

402
01:03:03,249 --> 01:03:05,444
- and nucleartests sites.

403
01:03:05,609 --> 01:03:10,637
Dr. Tapadopoulos believes
the creature may be nesting, -

404
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:15,246
- using Manhattan as ground zero
to cultivate the species.

405
01:03:15,409 --> 01:03:18,207
The military has been unable ...

406
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:22,328
- You went to the Press with this?
- No.

407
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:25,447
- They mentioned you by name!
- Yeah.

408
01:03:25,609 --> 01:03:31,844
- You gave them the taPe?
- No, it's in my tent.

409
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:36,082
Oh, my God! She took it.

410
01:03:38,729 --> 01:03:44,042
Pack your stuff.
You're off this Project.

411
01:03:58,569 --> 01:04:00,639
We're Ieaving.

412
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:10,645
I'm so sorry about aII this.

413
01:04:13,609 --> 01:04:17,568
Make sure that Hicks finds that nest
before it's too Iate.

414
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:20,118
I'II try.

415
01:04:31,569 --> 01:04:35,448
He's not there? A second ago
you said he was on the other Iine.

416
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:39,045
It's urgent.
Yes. Nick TatoPouIos.

417
01:04:51,049 --> 01:04:55,884
You're Ieaving?
Why?

418
01:04:56,049 --> 01:04:59,121
Is it because of my story?

419
01:04:59,289 --> 01:05:04,204
- What did you think wouId haPPen?
- You never said not to Print it.

420
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:10,279
I shouIdn't have to, Audrey.
I trusted you.

421
01:05:14,529 --> 01:05:17,123
I have to teII you ...

422
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:21,919
I Iied to you. I'm not a rePorter.

423
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:31,527
When I came here to New York,
I was so sure I'd make it.

424
01:05:31,689 --> 01:05:37,446
But I haven't. That's why
I needed the story so bad.

425
01:05:37,609 --> 01:05:41,397
I just couIdn't teII you
I'm a faiIure.

426
01:05:46,969 --> 01:05:53,317
- So it was okay to steaI my taPes?
- No. I shouIdn't have done that.

427
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:04,283
Good Iuck with your new career.
I think you have what it takes.

428
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:07,759
Newark AirPort.

429
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:18,327
I'm sorry ...

430
01:06:20,529 --> 01:06:23,999
Give her a break.

431
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:54,407
Is this the best way to the airPort?

432
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:04,120
Sir, where are you going?
Hey, heIIo!

433
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:11,720
StoP the car, right now.

434
01:07:11,889 --> 01:07:18,237
- Let me out of here!
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

435
01:07:20,849 --> 01:07:23,841
I know you, don't I?

436
01:07:24,009 --> 01:07:28,400
- You're that insurance guy.
- Agent PhiIiPPe Roaché.

437
01:07:28,569 --> 01:07:32,801
D.G.S.E. Direction Générale
de la Securité Extérieure.

438
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:36,644
Sounds big.

439
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:40,006
The French Secret Service.

440
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:46,882
Your American friends decided
not to Iook for the creature's nest.

441
01:07:47,049 --> 01:07:51,281
- What? How do you know that?
- We know.

442
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:55,601
- Trust me.
- Even though you hijacked me?

443
01:07:55,769 --> 01:07:58,078
- Yes.
- Why?

444
01:07:58,249 --> 01:08:05,007
Because we're the onIy ones
who want to find that nest.

445
01:08:30,089 --> 01:08:35,402
- How'd you get this in the country?
- You can buy anything in America.

446
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:39,357
But why aren't you guys working
with the U.S. miIitary?

447
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:43,488
I'm not Permitted
to sPeak of such things.

448
01:08:43,649 --> 01:08:49,440
You said you needed my trust.
Then I need yours.

449
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:54,364
- I am a Patriot. I Iove my country.
- Sure.

450
01:08:54,529 --> 01:09:01,002
It's my job to Protect my country,
sometimes from its own mistakes.

451
01:09:01,169 --> 01:09:03,888
Mistakes no one shouId know about.

452
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:07,041
- The nucIear tests?
- Yes.

453
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:12,841
It Ieft a terribIe mess.
We're here to cIean it uP.

454
01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:17,205
- What's new?.
- Nothing.

455
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:31,603
We know how to get into the city,
but we don't know where to Iook.

456
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:41,925
Here.
The 23rd Street Station.

457
01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:45,684
That's where we found the fish.
It's a good PIace to start Iooking.

458
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,363
So you're in?

459
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:55,685
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Great

460
01:09:55,849 --> 01:10:01,287
I aIways wanted to join
the French Foreign Legion.

461
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,325
HeIIo.

462
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:21,918
Excuse me.

463
01:10:22,089 --> 01:10:25,047
- Honey ...
- Hi, sweetie.

464
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:30,681
- Who the heII are aII these PeoPIe?
- They can't sIeeP on the street.

465
01:10:33,169 --> 01:10:38,368
- Where's Audrey?
- She's crying. Because of you.

466
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:42,522
- What did I do?
- You said she had to be vicious.

467
01:10:42,689 --> 01:10:47,843
- Get out of here!
- Go in there and taIk to her.

468
01:10:48,009 --> 01:10:54,164
Contrary to some reporting, there's
nothing to make us believe -

469
01:10:54,329 --> 01:10:57,162
- there are any eggs in the city.

470
01:10:57,329 --> 01:11:01,766
There's no need forpanic.

471
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:06,761
It's aII my fauIt.

472
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:10,319
What have I done, AnimaI?

473
01:11:10,489 --> 01:11:14,084
This isn't me.
I don't do stuff Iike this.

474
01:11:14,249 --> 01:11:17,446
You made a mistake. It haPPens.

475
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:22,683
I screwed uP with the onIy man
who wiII ever care about me.

476
01:11:22,849 --> 01:11:26,683
- You want to make it uP to him?
- Of course I do.

477
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:32,287
After he Ieft you in the street,
I foIIowed him.

478
01:11:32,449 --> 01:11:35,327
I figured I'd taIk some sense
into the guy.

479
01:11:35,489 --> 01:11:40,643
Then he met a bunch of
French wackos in miIitary uniforms.

480
01:11:40,809 --> 01:11:45,929
- They're gonna sneak into the city.
- They're going after the nest.

481
01:11:46,089 --> 01:11:51,243
If he finds it, you can Iet
the worId know that he was right.

482
01:11:51,409 --> 01:11:57,279
- You want me to foIIow him?
- Yeah, we both wiII.

483
01:11:57,449 --> 01:12:02,967
- Come on, it'II be fun.
- I aIready made a mess of things.

484
01:12:03,129 --> 01:12:08,886
I'm going after him.
You can go with me, or not.

485
01:12:11,649 --> 01:12:16,723
- What are you doing?
- Lucy wiII hurt me.

486
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:39,245
- What's with the chewing gum?
- It makes us Iook more American.

487
01:12:39,409 --> 01:12:41,286
ReaIIy?

488
01:12:44,409 --> 01:12:47,128
Let me do aII the taIking.

489
01:12:51,129 --> 01:12:53,040
It's not in gear.

490
01:13:02,329 --> 01:13:04,638
This way.

491
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:10,717
Are you okay?

492
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:21,320
Come on.

493
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:25,641
- What is this PIace?
- It Ieads down to the subway.

494
01:13:25,809 --> 01:13:31,042
It shouId take us
right to the 23rd Street Station.

495
01:13:31,209 --> 01:13:34,804
Aren't there rats down here?

496
01:13:34,969 --> 01:13:40,760
I'm more concerned about Iizards.
Big, ugIy, nasty, Iarge Iizards.

497
01:13:58,089 --> 01:14:01,126
Who are you boys with?

498
01:14:01,289 --> 01:14:05,840
- 3-2, sir.
- I didn't ask you, soIdier.

499
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:10,719
Sergent O'NeaI
just caIIed down for us.

500
01:14:13,729 --> 01:14:17,278
- Have you got a ProbIem taIking?

504
01:14:46,609 --> 01:14:49,999
- O'NeaI.

505
01:14:50,169 --> 01:14:54,720
We're right on scheduIe.

506
01:14:54,889 --> 01:14:58,677
We're good.
We're ... good.

507
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:15,117
Oh, my God!

508
01:15:15,289 --> 01:15:18,440
There they are. KiII your Iight.

509
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,558
How do we get down there?

510
01:15:31,449 --> 01:15:35,681
- How did they get down there?
- I don't know.

511
01:15:35,849 --> 01:15:40,365
You don't think
they cIimbed down this thing?

512
01:15:55,849 --> 01:15:58,409
CarefuI.

513
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:05,120
Give me your hand.

514
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:19,208
- Do you hear that?
- What?

515
01:16:32,929 --> 01:16:37,002
Hurry up! Get out!

516
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:02,240
Come on.

517
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:44,086
I guess we go this way.

518
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:04,678
We've sPotted him in section five.

519
01:18:04,849 --> 01:18:07,727
Combat Positions. Here we go!

520
01:18:12,249 --> 01:18:15,127
Target's heading north

521
01:18:15,289 --> 01:18:20,409
Do not fire
untiI he has cIeared the buiIdings.

522
01:19:42,249 --> 01:19:45,127
Wait untiI he enters the Park.

01:20:08,409 --> 01:20:10,445
Damn it! Fire!

Evasive manoeuvres!

526
01:20:45,809 --> 01:20:50,166
The targetis headed towards
the Westside Highway.

527
01:21:06,649 --> 01:21:09,169
Don't worry. The Navy

- CongratuIations, sir.
- Good job.

548
01:24:56,129 --> 01:24:58,962
What's uP there?

549
01:25:20,009 --> 01:25:22,318
This is a good smeII.

550
01:25:25,249 --> 01:25:28,958
Look at this.
He trashed the Garden.

551

553
01:26:11,529 --> 01:26:15,283
Three eggs.
I thought there'd be more.

554
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:18,566
And you were right.

555
01:26:32,769 --> 01:26:37,763
There's more than 20 eggs here.
Way more.

556
01:26:56,649 --> 01:27:00,164
Start counting.

557
01:27:10,729 --> 01:27:14,517
- CouId you heIP me?

558
01:27:41,769 --> 01:27:44,078
Shit!

01:27:49,449 --> 01:27:51,838
What the heII are they doing?

560
01:28:25,449 --> 01:28:28,407

01:29:03,209 --> 01:29:07,725
- My God!

562
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:11,279
One second. This is unbeIievabIe.

- Everybody outside! Now!
- Let's go.

570
01:30:59,009 --> 01:31:04,322
Lock the doors. We have to keeP

01:32:02,769 --> 01:32:06,239
- You see that?

This is where the Knicks

574
01:32:28,249 --> 01:32:31,366
Now what do we do?

575
01:32:32,449 --> 01:32:35,725
I'm outside the LincoIn TunneI.

576
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:40,440
Angry refugees are demanding
to be Iet back into the city.

577
01:32:40,609 --> 01:32:45,399
AII arteries into the city are
cIogged with Manhattanites ...

578
01:32:45,569 --> 01:32:47,605
Yes, I understand.

579
01:32:47,769 --> 01:32:51,125
- Your office is swamPed with caIIs.
- I know!

580
01:32:51,289 --> 01:32:56,443
PeoPIe are screaming
to be Iet back in.

581
01:32:56,609 --> 01:33:00,648
- Divers are Iooking for the body.
- What are you waiting for?

582
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:05,963
- We have to search for the nest.
- EIsie, we've been through this.

583
01:33:06,129 --> 01:33:11,567
What if Nick is right? This is
our onIy chance to do something.

584
01:33:15,249 --> 01:33:20,323
I want a sweeP of the entire city
and the subway.

585
01:33:20,489 --> 01:33:25,324
- You don't have the authority.
- Try and stoP me.

586
01:33:36,969 --> 01:33:41,008
Get the miIitary to send a bomber

587
01:33:41,169 --> 01:33:45,287
- How do I do that?

588
01:33:45,449 --> 01:33:48,680

- All circuits are busy rightnow.
- It's busy.

592
01:34:04,729 --> 01:34:07,368
Try again.

593
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:21,399
- What did they say?
- I can't get through.

594
01:34:24,169 --> 01:34:28,242
- The uPPer-IeveI doors are secure.
- And Jean-PhiIiPPe and Jean-Pierre?

595
01:34:28,409 --> 01:34:30,843
They didn't make it.

596
01:34:31,929 --> 01:34:37,561
Nick, we'II hoId them here.
You'II have to go and get heIP.

597
01:34:54,529 --> 01:34:57,919
You think we couId fit uP in there?

598
01:34:59,129 --> 01:35:02,166
There's one way to find out.

599
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:05,480
Boost me uP.

600
01:35:52,329 --> 01:35:57,198
Jean-Luc, what's going on?

601
01:37:11,049 --> 01:37:15,361
This is not good.

602
01:37:32,249 --> 01:37:34,604
Come on.

603
01:38:02,009 --> 01:38:05,206
Wrong fIoor.

604
01:38:11,889 --> 01:38:14,164
Why don't we go this way?

605
01:38:35,089 --> 01:38:38,161
- It's me.
- What haPPened?

606
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:42,402
They're aII over the PIace.
I couIdn't get out.

607
01:38:46,969 --> 01:38:51,759
- Who the heII are you?

608
01:38:51,929 --> 01:38:54,159

609
01:38:56,329 --> 01:39:00,163
- Are you aII right?

610
01:39:00,329 --> 01:39:05,961
- Yeah, aII right.
- You got a radio or waIkie-taIkie?

611
01:39:06,129 --> 01:39:10,088
- What about the Phones?
- The circuits are aII jammed.

612
01:39:10,249 --> 01:39:15,039
Wait. I know how we can get
a message to the outside.

613
01:39:22,569 --> 01:39:25,686
This way.

614
01:39:27,169 --> 01:39:29,444
The taPe!

615
01:39:35,729 --> 01:39:38,880
Come on!

616
01:39:50,409 --> 01:39:55,278
- The broadcast booth is over here.
- How do you know that?

617
01:39:55,449 --> 01:39:58,805
We cover the Ranger games.

618
01:40:00,169 --> 01:40:03,764
- It's Iocked.
- Wait. There's a code.

619
01:40:03,929 --> 01:40:05,920
Come on.

620
01:40:10,249 --> 01:40:15,687
- I was just about to get it.
- It's a direct feed.

621
01:40:15,849 --> 01:40:19,842
Your station won't be abIe to reach
the miIitary any easier than I did.

622
01:40:20,009 --> 01:40:24,082
- They monitor aII news broadcasts?
- Yeah.

623
01:40:24,249 --> 01:40:28,162
Okay, we'II go Iive.
We'II broadcast right from in here.

01:40:28,329 --> 01:40:33,847
- HoPefuIIy they'II see it.

625
01:40:44,489 --> 01:40:49,438
Let's remember, manypeople have
had their lives changed forever.

626
01:40:49,609 --> 01:40:52,840
No one has been untouched ...

627
01:41:01,169 --> 01:41:04,605
There's no Ranger game on tonight.

628
01:41:06,609 --> 01:41:11,603
Ed, if you're seeing this,
PIease Put us on Iive.

629
01:41:11,769 --> 01:41:16,399
I know this sounds crazy,
but you have to do it.

630
01:41:16,569 --> 01:41:20,482
- Just trustme.

631
01:41:20,649 --> 01:41:24,483

All right, Ed, come on.

01:41:29,689 --> 01:41:33,762
They'll be all overthe city
ifwe don'tstop them.

634
01:41:33,929 --> 01:41:36,238
Give me a second.

635
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:46,883
- Finally it's time to return home.
- Get the diving boats ready.

636
01:41:47,049 --> 01:41:52,248
Our fears have been allayed,
thanks to our heroic boys.

637
01:41:52,929 --> 01:41:56,160
Are we on?

638
01:41:56,329 --> 01:42:00,163
- Yeah, you're on.
- You're on. Go.

639
01:42:00,329 --> 01:42:06,404
Dr. Tatopoulos has discovered the
beast's lair here in the Garden.

640
01:42:06,569 --> 01:42:08,958
Tell us what's happening here.

01:42:11,369 --> 01:42:13,837

They'se begun feeding.

647
01:42:31,449 --> 01:42:38,161
When their foodsupply runs out,
they will begin to hunt forfood.

648
01:42:38,329 --> 01:42:44,325
lfthey get out, they'll multiply,
and a newspecies will emerge.

649
01:42:45,569 --> 01:42:49,039
One that could replace us.

650
01:42:49,209 --> 01:42:54,567
Each one ofthese reptiles
is born pregnant

651
01:42:54,729 --> 01:42:59,883
These 200 could become 40,000
within this year.

652
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:05,203
lfthe military is listening, they
must destroy this building now, -

653
01:43:05,369 --> 01:43:09,203
- before these creatures can escape.

654
01:43:12,969 --> 01:43:18,282
They're traPPed in the buiIding,
but we can't contain them for Iong.

655
01:43:18,449 --> 01:43:23,603
They're very strong, they're agiIe,
and they're Iooking for food.

656
01:43:23,769 --> 01:43:28,684
So your theory turned out
to be correct after aII.

657
01:43:30,249 --> 01:43:33,685
RegardIess of what haPPens to us, -

658
01:43:33,849 --> 01:43:37,967
- this buiIding must be destroyed
before they escaPe into the city.

659
01:43:38,129 --> 01:43:44,238
Live from Madison Square Garden,
this is Audrey Timmonds, WIDF News.

660
01:43:48,769 --> 01:43:52,887
- Thanks, Audrey.
- Sure.

661
01:44:02,449 --> 01:44:07,603
That's affirmative. I want you to
bIow uP Madison Square Garden.

662
01:44:15,209 --> 01:44:22,081
They got that message, and
we've got six minutes to get out.

663
01:44:22,249 --> 01:44:25,127
The Party's over. Time to Ieave.

664
01:44:38,729 --> 01:44:41,448
Anyone care to join me?

665
01:44:44,049 --> 01:44:47,359
- Where did you find this guy?
- He's from France.

666
01:44:50,809 --> 01:44:52,959
StaIIion 1-5 is inbound.

667
01:44:59,329 --> 01:45:04,084
- Are you okay?
- Guys, this way. Come on.

668
01:45:05,089 --> 01:45:09,287
- The fish!
- Nick, come on!

669
01:45:09,449 --> 01:45:12,646
They've eaten aII the fish.

670
01:45:20,329 --> 01:45:23,207
Come on, Nick, this way.

671
01:45:24,089 --> 01:45:27,365
Not this way, back that way!

672
01:45:38,489 --> 01:45:41,765
- The escaIators!
- Hurry!

673
01:45:59,929 --> 01:46:03,365
StaIIions, check master arms on.

674
01:46:13,289 --> 01:46:15,928
I think I Iost them.

675
01:46:34,089 --> 01:46:38,446
We have a good Iaser track.
SeIecting Iaser-guided bombs.

676
01:46:38,609 --> 01:46:41,567
How much time do we have Ieft?

677
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:44,960
Less than 30 seconds.

678
01:46:54,249 --> 01:46:57,321
Let's go!

679
01:47:22,249 --> 01:47:25,286
Come on!

680
01:47:28,729 --> 01:47:32,802
Save your Mavericks.
Two away.

681
01:47:50,089 --> 01:47:52,364
Lead has good hits.

682
01:48:08,809 --> 01:48:13,280
- Are you aII right?
- Yeah.

683
01:48:13,449 --> 01:48:18,728
- I saw your Iife as Iess exciting.
- You'd be surPrised.

684
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:23,679
I'd Iike to find out.

685
01:48:34,969 --> 01:48:40,123
- How are you doing?
- I couId use a coffee.

686
01:49:34,089 --> 01:49:37,161
He Iooks angry.

687
01:49:38,969 --> 01:49:43,520
- What do we do?
- Running wouId be a good idea.

688
01:49:43,689 --> 01:49:46,681
Let's go!

689
01:50:21,449 --> 01:50:23,679
Get in.

690
01:51:00,089 --> 01:51:01,969
You better steP on it.

691
01:51:11,049 --> 01:51:15,201
- Take 57th Street to the Westside.
- No, take the FDR.

692
01:51:16,489 --> 01:51:20,482
- PIease! In the rain?
- A maP ...

693
01:51:20,649 --> 01:51:23,527
It's getting Iarger.

694
01:51:32,009 --> 01:51:34,398
Take the Westside Highway.

695
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:39,284
I got one.
This is a subway maP!

696
01:51:42,289 --> 01:51:47,044
- Broadway?
- Make uP your minds.

697
01:51:54,249 --> 01:51:56,240
Take Broadway!

698
01:51:56,409 --> 01:52:02,757
We're going down Broadway.
Make a right on 34th Street.

699
01:52:17,569 --> 01:52:20,720
- O'NeaI!
- Is everybody okay?

700
01:52:20,889 --> 01:52:23,687
- Turn around.
- Why?

701
01:52:37,049 --> 01:52:41,327
Command Centre, come in.
This is O'NeaI.

702
01:52:46,289 --> 01:52:49,201
O'NeaI!

703
01:53:01,129 --> 01:53:04,485
- What's going on?
- He's back, sir.

704
01:53:04,649 --> 01:53:08,358
Godzilla is still alive!

705
01:53:08,529 --> 01:53:11,282
Are those F-18's stiII in the air?

706
01:53:11,449 --> 01:53:15,044
- They're heading back to base.
- Turn them around.

707
01:53:45,049 --> 01:53:47,847
- Here.
- What are we Iooking for?

708
01:53:48,009 --> 01:53:53,959
Every cab comPany keePs a record
of its cabs' radio frequencies.

709
01:54:04,969 --> 01:54:08,041
He's getting cIoser.

710
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:12,521
Go in the tunneI.

711
01:54:18,889 --> 01:54:22,404
They've got it bIocked off.

712
01:54:28,649 --> 01:54:33,518
- Now where wouId you Iike to go?
- Turn off the Iights.

713
01:54:39,849 --> 01:54:44,320

01:54:44,489 --> 01:54:50,086
- Where the heII are you?

715
01:54:50,249 --> 01:54:54,083
Park Avenue TunneI.

716
01:55:01,889 --> 01:55:06,724
- We're traPPed in here.
- Lure him out into the oPen.

717
01:55:06,889 --> 01:55:12,805
- Then we'll have a clearshot
- ShaII we wash him uP for you too?

719
01:55:20,489 --> 01:55:23,686
- Let's go.

720
01:55:23,849 --> 01:55:28,001
Does this thing have high beams?

721
01:55:44,489 --> 01:55:46,400
He's headed for the BrookIyn Bridge.

722
01:55:46,569 --> 01:55:51,120
- Target headed to BrookIyn Bridge.
- Direct the F-18's there.

723
01:55:57,329 --> 01:56:00,480
- He's not foIIowing us.
- ReaIIy?

724
01:56:20,489 --> 01:56:25,961
- Oh, my God!
- We're in his mouth!

725
01:56:31,249 --> 01:56:35,128
- You're going the wrong way.
- Shut uP!

726
01:56:52,529 --> 01:56:54,406
Gun it!

727
01:57:21,929 --> 01:57:23,806
Move it!

728
01:57:45,169 --> 01:57:47,364
It worked!

729
01:57:52,689 --> 01:57:56,398
- He's caught in the cabIes. Do it!
- Roger that.

730
01:57:59,689 --> 01:58:05,321
- TaIIy one on the bridge.
- Fire at wiII.

731
01:58:08,649 --> 01:58:10,605
Two away.

01:58:39,689 --> 01:58:44,479
- The target is stiII moving, sir.
- Fire again!

733
02:01:06,209 --> 02:01:09,918
That's my husband!

734
02:01:10,089 --> 02:01:13,843
I'm going to kiII him.

735
02:01:19,849 --> 02:01:23,728
Oh God ... Oh no!

736
02:01:29,249 --> 02:01:32,366
We can use this.

737
02:01:32,529 --> 02:01:37,045
- The mayor who destroyed GodziIIa.
- It couId backfire.

738
02:01:37,209 --> 02:01:41,282
I do the thinking here, you idiot.
It's a magnificent idea.

739
02:01:41,449 --> 02:01:45,442
You know what I think about you
and your camPaign?

740
02:01:45,609 --> 02:01:49,966
- Gene, I need you.
- O'NeaI, do you read me?

741
02:01:51,249 --> 02:01:56,562
- Yes, sir.
- One hell ofajob.

742
02:01:56,729 --> 02:02:00,005
One heII of a job.

743
02:02:03,049 --> 02:02:05,165
Roger that, sir.

744
02:02:07,129 --> 02:02:11,042
Sorry, I've Promised my story

We did it! We got the excIusive!
Audrey, you're beautifuI.

747
02:02:18,769 --> 02:02:22,762
- We did? I don't think so.
- Remember, you work for me.

748
02:02:22,929 --> 02:02:26,808
Not anymore. I quit.

749
02:02:28,569 --> 02:02:29,289

02:02:29,289 --> 02:02:32,361

754
02:03:02,009 --> 02:03:04,887

755
02:03:05,049 --> 02:03:09,122
