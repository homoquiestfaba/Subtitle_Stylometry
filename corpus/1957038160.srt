00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,183
- That's Adolfo.

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,730
- So, yeah it's pretty chill.

27
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,870
We have barbecues.

28
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,880
- Cool, I like that.

29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,740
- So what are you, what

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,580
or what do you do?

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,023

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,533
what are you studying?

34
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:03,850
- English actually.

35
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,150
- Oh wow.

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,090
- Yeah I just, I wanted
a place a little closer.

37
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,760
I've been staying with my boyfriend.

38
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,500
He's right in the financial district

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,060
so it's just such a bear

40
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,150
to get out of there in the mornings.

41
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,570
- [Robert] Yeah.

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,040
- Okay.
- Oh, kitchen.

43
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,033
- Oh yeah, nice kitchen.

44
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,247
That's really pretty.

46
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:23,484
- Thanks.

47
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:24,460
- Oh, did you do that?

48
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,923
- Yeah, but I'm still, I'm still learning.

49
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:31,669
- Yeah it's, it's nice.

50
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,000
- So what do you do for work?

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,924
- Um, I'm a princess.

52
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:39,921
- What?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:40,754
(Jenny laughs)

54
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:41,587
- You're a princess?

55
00:02:41,587 --> 00:02:42,420
That's a job.
- Yeah,

56
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,253
I work for this company.

57
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:45,442
They send princesses out to
little girls birthday parties.

58
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:46,900
- [Robert] Oh.

59
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,210
- I'm a little embarrassed by this still.

60
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,334
- What?
- Yeah.

61
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:51,920
But, it's fun.
- Whatever.

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,780
- It's totally fun.

63
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,717
- I help, I help this old hippie guy out.

64
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:58,357
I get him his Chinese
herbs and his organic tea

65
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,913
and all that junk.

66
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:01,821
- [Jenny] That's perfect.

67
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:03,280
- But it's, you know,
it's for right now, so.

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,981
- Yeah, I mean.

69
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:07,360
So many people.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,293
- Gigs right now.

71
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,530
- Um, cool well,

72
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,847
let me get your information.

73
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:17,680
- Sure.

74
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:21,181
Well I really like the place so.

76
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:23,984

- Hello?

146
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,766
Leo?
- [Leo] I'm back here.

147
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:29,700
- Shit.

148
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,470
You know you left a cigarette
burning on the table.

149
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,220
- [Leo] I'm almost done, come here.

150
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,980
- Seriously, Leo.

151
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,350
How many hours a day do you spend in here?

152
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,590
It's disgusting.

153
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,500
- It's the only place I know

154
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,990
where I can get some peace and quiet.

155
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,730
A little solitude, eh.

156
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,790
With no distractions.

157
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,100
- Well, how bout an office?

158
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,660
- Nah, offices are for bean counters.

159
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,520
People who file reports and lawyers,

160
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,464
accountants, salesmen.

161
00:08:57,464 --> 00:09:00,130
As an artist, you need some ambiance.

162
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,993
Some place that nurtures creation.

163
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,350
- [Robert] And for you, it's the bathroom?

164
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,183
- Exactly.

165
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,410
How do you spell embody?

166
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,243
E-M-B.

167
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:10,925
There.

168
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,683
Ready to go.

169
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:14,070
- So Leo, your medication's
on the counter.

170
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,600
Do you need anything else?

171
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,750
- You know where I can
get a peyote button?

172
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,790
Relax kid, I'm just kidding.

173
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,970
What are you doing right now?

174
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,024
- All right, come with me.

175
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,095
- What, where?

176
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:28,357
- Come with me, trust me.

177
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:30,210
Come on, just come with me.

178
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,930
The hands of time move.

179
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,773
A steady beat.

180
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,463
I wait.

181
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,023
Reflecting on words I spoke.

182
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,290
Still kindle the fire within my soul.

183
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,710
Now in these final moments,

184
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,203
questions everything about you.

185
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,403
Everything about me.

186
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,653
I wait.

187
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,650
Sunshine.

188
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,610
Rain in the morning.

189
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,310
And you wanna leave San Francisco.

190
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,373
- Leo, that was amazing.

191
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,763
- Thank you.

192
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:15,320
- Where do you come up with this stuff.

193
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,329
- Ah, sometimes the most vivid ideas

194
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:22,970
come from the bowels of ones darkness.

195
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,520
Ah, that one I should remember.

196
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,840
So how's that work coming along, hm?

197
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,600
Am I ever gonna get to
see any of those drawings?

198
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
- Ah, it's garbage.

199
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,830
- Talkin' bout, it's garbage?

200
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,390
How can you consider yourself an artist

201
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,710
and not want people to see your work.

202
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,260
- Oh I'm not the artist,
you're the artist.

203
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,200
- That's where you're wrong.

204
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,172
You see what I did in there?

205
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:46,330
You just gotta let it flow.

206
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,770
You have it in you.

207
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,853
I've seen your work, it's excellent.

208
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:52,589
So you're gonna tell me

209
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:53,760
you're not gonna miss
anything about San Francisco?

210
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,650
The air, the people, the architecture?

211
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,580
You wanna cut and run?

212
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,120
I cut and run on my whole life.

213
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,470
You wanna cut and run
and you don't believe in your own gift

214
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,317
when other people around you believe

215
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:06,600
and see that you have a gift

216
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,790
and they just want you to be happy.

217
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,540
You came out here from back
home looking for something.

218
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,670
And because it didn't happen overnight,

219
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,900
you're looking to run again.

220
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,580
I think that you, that's just my opinion.

221
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,440
It might be, it might be.

222
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,310
- Leo.
- What?

223
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,972
- I get where you're coming from but.

224
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,660
- No you don't, you don't get
what you're coming, you set.

225
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,090
- No no no, hold up, hold up a second.

226
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,850
You don't get where I'm
coming from, all right.

227
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,340
You're from a completely
different generation.

228
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,680
I know you're really floaty and flowery

229
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,320
and all this stuff sounds great, you know.

230
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,130
But I'm 25 years old, you're right.

231
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,730
- 25 years old, you have
all the answers, don't you?

232
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:40,785
- You didn't think I was 25 years old.

233
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:41,618
- No no.
- Hold on.

234
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,110
Did you think I was 25 years old once?

235
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,240
You think I didn't know everything?

236
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,410
I knew nothing, nothing.

237
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,210
And once I admitted that I knew
nothing, I became teachable.

238
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,230
And all I'm trying to do

239
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,090
is save you some of the
pain that I went through.

240
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,640
If you're willing to be teachable.

241
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,838
- What?

242
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,013
- You do what you have to do.

243
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,290
You ever wonder why you came
out here in the first place?

244
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,600
I mean, you came out here to create.

245
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,930
Create your life, create art.

246
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,880
To recreate something
so completely different

247
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,630
than what was dictated to
you that it really should be.

248
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,990
- I know Leo, it's just,

249
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,950
I don't know if that's enough anymore.

250
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,830
- I know what's wrong?

251
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,860
- What?

252
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,693
- You.

253
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,752
You just keep getting in your own way.

254
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:25,585
- Okay.
- I'll tell you what,

255
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:27,140
I wanna buy it from you.

256
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,960
- Buy what?
- That drawing.

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,120
If you don't know what good art is, I do.

258
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,920
I'd like to make the investment.

259
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,753
- Leo.

260
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,170
- I wanna be the first one
to own a Robert Matsuda.

261
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,342
300 bucks.

262
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,593
- You don't need to do that.

263
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,570
- I don't need to do anything.

264
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,840
Come on, get the gate.

265
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,560
I gotta take a leak.

266
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,143

- Hey.
- Hey, Glen.

273
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,413
- Robert, what's up?

274
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:26,246
You need a hand?

275
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:27,469
- Nah, I'm good.

276
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:28,371
- I gotta take it for you.

277
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,274
- No, it's really okay.

278
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:30,107
- Piece of cake, I got it.

279
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:31,040
I got it.

280
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,343
- All right, thanks.

281
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,480
Oh not to the side, this
way, this way, this way.

282
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,880
- Nah it's okay, we'll just.

283
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:39,329
What you got, it's safe in there?

284
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:40,829
- Yeah, thank you.

285
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:46,055
- Sometimes you just gotta
force it in, you know?

286
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,543
Fragile stuff.

287
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,870
There we go, look at that.

288
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,040
Good?

289
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,873
- Yeah.

290
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,843
- All right, let's go get warm.

291
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:02,600
- All right, thank you.

292
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,550
- Yeah, no problem.

293
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,050
- Jenny tells me you're
headed back east, huh?

294
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,883
- Yup.

295
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,933
- You excited?

296
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:13,560
- Yeah, yeah I'm excited.

297
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,393
- Nice.

298
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:15,900
- I heard they just had
a blizzard out there.

299
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,687
- Oh, have you seen any
protein bars in here?

300
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:20,010
I thought I left it.

301
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,840
- I don't know, I would not know.

302
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,090
- Um, well, I mean,

303
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,416
at least you'll have some
opportunities, right?

304
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,120
- Yeah, that's one way to look at it.

305
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,250
- I mean the economy's bouncing back.

306
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,010
Manhattan's a good place to be right now.

307
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,780
Even Brooklyn's not bad, I mean,

308
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,115
a short commute to the city.

309
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:39,303
- Well actually I'm gonna be in upstate.

310
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,173
- Oh.

311
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,880
What's that like?

312
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,603
- It's cold.

313
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,240
- I bet.

314
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,343
Well, if you ever need a
place to stay in New York.

315
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,250
- Hello gentlemen.

316
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,860
- Hey.

317
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,779
Good to see you.

318
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:53,682
- Hi.

319
00:14:53,682 --> 00:14:54,750
- Sorry, sweat all over you.

320
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,900
- Hot, sweaty.
- Yeah.

321
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,440
- Oh how was your party the
other night, by the way?

322
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,200
Sorry I missed that, I
was swamped with stuff.

323
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,033
- It was good.

324
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:06,090
- [Glen] Yeah?
- Yeah, it was, it was good.

325
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,510
It was really nice that
everyone put it together?

326
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,970
- [Glen] Last hurrah, huh?

327
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,560
Did you behave yourself?

328
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,890
- How you felling this morning?

329
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,090
- [Robert] I'm feeling great.

330
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,190
- Good, good.
- Yeah.

331
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,529
Well, I will head out.

332
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:21,362
- Feel like getting some take out?

333
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:22,490
- Um.
- I feel like Chinese

334
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,600
or Thai or something.

335
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,433
What do you feel like having?

336
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:25,463
- More Thai than Chinese.

337
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:27,900
Hey.

338
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,872
- [Robert] Hey.

339
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:31,240
- Can we talk for a sec?

340
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,073
- Hey babe, you want you
spice eggplant thing?

341
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:34,520
- Yeah, eggplant's good, thanks.

342
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,420
I feel like we should talk about this.

343
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:38,463
- What's there to say?

344
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:42,254
I, I think right now is
not really the right time.

345
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:44,059
- [Glen] Hey, can you
come here for one second?

346
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,972
- And I'm double parked outside.
- [Glen] Is it in your purse?

347
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:46,805
I can't find your purse anywhere.

348
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:47,638
- Hold on.

349
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,509
- We'll talk later.

350
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,000
- Okay.

351
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,273
- Okay?
- Sure.

352
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,220
- Adolfo, it was a mistake.

353
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,870
- [Adolfo] Mistake my balls, man.

354
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,090
- [Robert] You realize
what this means, right?

355
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,005
- What?
- I'm that other guy.

356
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:13,630
I'm the asshole, she's got a boyfriend.

357
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,190
- Bro, she's always had a boyfriend.

358
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,930
It's all good, my man.

359
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,880
- I'm being serious.

360
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,702
- I love Jenny, she's a great girl,

361
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:24,390
but you've got her on this
fucking pedestal someplace man,

362
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,280
you gotta forget about her.

363
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,380
Did you sleep with her?

364
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,213
- No.

365
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,046
- [Adolfo] Did she blow you?

366
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,690
- No.

367
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,030
- So nothing really happened.

368
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,760
Come Monday, you're gonna be in New York

369
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,510
and she's gonna be around
here doing whatever the fuck.

370
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,841
Problem resolved.
- Just forget about it.

371
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,040
- Life goes on, bro.

372
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,435
On to the next one.

373
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,285
- Why do I tell you anything anymore?

374
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:48,935
(whimsical music)

375
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:17,160
(cat meowing)

376
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,170
- Hey, cookie monster, shut up!

377
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,550
- Stop.
- No.

378
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,571
What is the cat's name, Malimar
or something, I don't know?

379
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:23,404
- Stop, please.

380
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:24,237
- It's some kind of cookie.

381
00:17:24,237 --> 00:17:25,070
Hey, shut up!

382
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,045
- Be nice, be nice.

383
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,780
- What, it sounds like he's in heat
or he's dying or he's both.

384
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,630
- Yeah, he's not in heat, he's fixed.

385
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,463
- [Glen] I'm just tired of it.

386
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:34,800
It's every single night.

387
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,140
- [Jenny] Be nice, be nice.

388
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,100
- Just one more problem
we won't have to worry
about on the 14th floor.

389
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,230
- Well, what about the
next big earthquake.

390
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,130
(cat meowing)

391
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,560
You'll be buried under piles of rubble.

392
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,393
- Well it's a good thing we have

393
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:48,144
all these giant parachutes
that you brought home with you.

394
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:50,640
Are we taking all these things with us?

395
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,866
- [Jenny] Yes.

396
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,000
- I just thought,

397
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,780
maybe you'd give it up by the time we go.

398
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,073
Maybe stop, you know, doing the dress up.

399
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:59,141
- It's not dress up.

400
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:01,800
- [Glen] Okay.
- I'm a children's party entertainer.

401
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,808
I don't do this for kicks,
I make money doing this.

402
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,341
- Yeah, I know, I just.

403
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:09,220
I figured it was a fresh
start, it was a new beginning

404
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,896
and that, you know.

405
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,413
It was a chance for you to--

406
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:13,246
- It's not like I'm a prostitute,

407
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:14,520
I'm a children's party entertainer.

408
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,950
I don't need a fresh start.

409
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,920
You were the one who last week,

410
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,310
you said that I make kids happy.

411
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,070
What happened to that?

412
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,410
- [Glen] I know you make
kids happy, it's just that.

413
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,750
- You change your mind so fast,

414
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,137
and excuse me, do you do this
at the office, 'cause uh?

415
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,161
- [Glen] No, I don't take
my pants off at the office.

416
00:18:28,161 --> 00:18:29,320
(Jenny sighs)

417
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,876
- What did you do, there's stuff in there?

418
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:35,380
- [Glen] It's just, it's just
a pair of headphones, here.

419
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,530
- You hurt my feelings.

420
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,771
I don't like it when you call it dress up.

421
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,100
- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean anything by it, okay?

422
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,690
You know that I really do love
what you do for the children.

423
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,190
If you're happy, I'm happy, I'm serious.

424
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,593
It's always been that way.

425
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:52,810
Have I ever not supported you?

426
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,880
I always have.

427
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,028
I just don't want to see
you wasting your time.

428
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:58,700
- [Jenny] I'm not wasting time.
- I know you're not, I just.

429
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,760
I think about this new place, you know,

430
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,000
it's a new beginning.

431
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,300
For you and for me.
I mean, we can really start a life.

432
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,508
It's not just shuttling back and forth,

433
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:08,600
and I thought that maybe with a new life

434
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,500
you'd want to start a new career, too.

435
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,480
- Okay, I'm happy doing this
and I'm going to school, so,

436
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,948
you don't have to worry about
my career yet, all right?

437
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:21,620
- What's R-I-T?

438
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,920
- Oh, it's, I don't know,
it's Robert's thing.

439
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:26,523
It's his college or something.

440
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,623
- Come here.

441
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,653
I'm sorry, okay?

442
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,560
I am.

443
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,760
I just know how much
potential you have and,

444
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,727
just want to make sure that, you know.

445
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,520
When you're ready, you're ready.

446
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,663
I'll be here, okay?

447
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:02,446
- Suck up.

448
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:07,446
- That's right.

449
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,792
(light-hearted music)

450
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,963
- Hi.
- Hi.

451
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,753
- You live here?

452
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:46,284
- Yeah, no.

453
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:47,117
- Yeah, no.

454
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:48,783
(Robert laughs)
- I don't live here.

455
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:50,193
- Okay, where are you going?

456
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:51,610
- Um, up, stairs.

457
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:53,455
- Okay.

458
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:55,230
- Where are you off to, today?

459
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,062
- Well, I'm visiting
this guy I take care of.

460
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:01,650
The third floor.
- Yeah, what's his name?

461
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,590
- Yeah, Leo.

462
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,910
- Leo!

463
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,903
Leonard, yes.
- What you know him?

464
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:07,360
- That's who I'm here for.

465
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,350
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

466
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,540
Can I, can I?
- As in Leo in apartment five?

467
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,930
- Yes, yes, five.

468
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,450
- You want me to sign for anything or?

469
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,470
- No, no no no.

470
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,520
This is a hand to hand package deal here.

471
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,173
Gotta get it right to him.

472
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,843
Forage on.

473
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,072
Actually I'll follow you

474
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:26,990
'cause I don't know where I'm going.
- Well it's just that, you
know, I take care of him

475
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,610
and I'm responsible for his place, so.

476
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,133
- Yeah, that's okay.

477
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,990
- I can't really have
people just following me.

478
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,240
- No, that's good, that's good.

479
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,353
Can I use the bathroom though?

480
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:39,813
I have to pee really bad.

481
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:41,310
I waited a long time downstairs.

482
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,330
- Okay.
- Number five you said?

483
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,450
Apples, that's good, that's good.

484
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,600
- [Robert] Yeah, he loves
all that organic shit.

485
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
- Keeps the doctor away.

486
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,210
Where's the bathroom?

487
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,043
- On the left.

488
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,233
Leo?

489
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,993
Hello?

490
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,280
- Thank you, God.

491
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,460
I was sitting out there
for like five hours.

492
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,880
I thought I was gonna get
another bladder infection.

493
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,670
- Ah, you feel better?

494
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,090
- Oh God, yeah I do actually.

495
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,363
Thank you, but.

496
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,020
- [Robert] But what?

497
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,200
- Wow.
- Everything okay?

498
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,030
- Yeah, there's dead animals everywhere.

499
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,315
What's that about?

500
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:36,970
What is that?

501
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,123
Is that a dinosaur?

502
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,410
- No, that's a cat.

503
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,480
What's your name again?

504
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,490
- Yeah uh, Sara, Sara Landis.

505
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,810
- Robert.

506
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,030
- Are, are you Hawaiian.

507
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,150
- I'm half Japanese.

508
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,555
But there are a lot of halfies in Hawaii.

509
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:52,730
- Japanese.

510
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,360
You know I love Japan town.

511
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,170
Sapporo, there's some great
sushi restaurant's there.

512
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,700
We should, we should do that sometime.

513
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,350
You and me, yeah?

514
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,976
What is that?

515
00:23:01,976 --> 00:23:03,163
It's a smoking monkey.

516
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:04,864
- Hm.

517
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,540
Can I have some water?

518
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,033
- Yeah, sure.

519
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,410
- [Sara] So are you his nurse?

520
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,920
- No, I just, I watch
over Leo a little bit.

521
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,850
- Where are you from anyway?

522
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,412
Are you a native.

523
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:20,720
- I'm from Rochester.

524
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,060
- I'm from Vermont.

525
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,700
- Cool, same neck of land.
- Oh my God.

526
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,110
You take the 89 to the four to the 80

527
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,440
and your in fucking Rochester.

528
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,643
We're like neighbors.

529
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,870
It's like an hour and a half away.

530
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,703
- Right.

531
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:32,536
- Well, six hours.

532
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,450
But you know, I mean, it
depends if you get the.

533
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,210
- I'm sorry to cut this short.

534
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,160
I would love to hear where you're from,

535
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,340
it's just not the right time.

536
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,210
- Yeah, yeah.

537
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,490
Can I get that water?

538
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,540
Really thirsty.

539
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,620
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

540
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,166
- Good?

541
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,068
- That was a lot of water.

542
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:57,230
- Is this gonna affect
your bladder infection?
- I gotta get finished.

543
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,947
No, that's actually good for it.

544
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,790
- And how did you say you knew Leo?

545
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,960
- Yeah, oh we, I told you.

546
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,580
Long, long time ago we met.

547
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,413
We're good friends.

548
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:07,540
- Okay, you're done with this, right?

549
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,540
- Yeah.
- Good.

550
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,880
- [Sara] Sure.

551
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,320
- So what do you, I don't
know, what do you want?

552
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,153
Ball's in your court.

553
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:14,250
- Yeah, no, we can't,
we gotta give it to him.

554
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,300
I can't just leave it here.

555
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,800
- Okay, so I guess you
can try back tomorrow.

556
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,440
Maybe tomorrow morning.

557
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,760
Catch him either early in
the morning or late at night.

558
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,840
- Um, let me just, yeah okay.

559
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,730
All right, well here, I'll just.

560
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,620
- I don't even think
it's taking a picture.

561
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,980
- Yeah I got it.

562
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,220
I guess I'll leave it here,

563
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,053
but um,

564
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,270
ah, I don't know.
- Are you okay?

565
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,140
Is everything okay?

566
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,268
I have to go.

567
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,173
Let's go.

568
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:42,810
- Um, just uh, I'm starving.

569
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,539
Oh, can I get a, what the hell is that?

570
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:45,372
- Whoa whoa whoa.

571
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:46,205
Come on, come on.

572
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:47,038
We really have to get out of.

573
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:49,086
- That is disgusting.

574
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:50,035
- Let's go.
- All right.

575
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:53,299
- You know, I thought you
were a bike messenger
when I first saw you.

576
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,650
- You thought I was a local.

577
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,950
Shut up.

578
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,390
That's awesome.

579
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,310
Oh my God.

580
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,225
You know how lucky I feel right now?

581
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:01,190
- [Robert] Let's go.

582
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,490
Oh my God.
- Okay.

583
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,240
All right, that's great, thank you.

584
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,070
- Leo will get your package,
it's safe in the house.

585
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,340
Why don't I take your number,

586
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,840
maybe you'll feel better about it?

587
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,980
- Yeah, that's problematic.

588
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,170
I don't, I don't actually have a number.

589
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,550
Uh, but let me take yours.

590
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,383
Go ahead.

591
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:19,756
Thank you.
- Okay.

592
00:25:19,756 --> 00:25:20,756
- Thank you.

593
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:23,120
Good, okay.

594
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,130
- I have no idea.
- Yeah, oh yeah.

595
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,900
- Why you're here or where you're going,

596
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,840
but it seems like you're on a journey.

597
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,515
- Yeah.
- And a nice lady, so.

598
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:33,053
- Okay.
- Okay.

599
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,830
- All right.
- Good luck.

600
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,663
- Yeah.

601
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:37,502
You're a good guy, Bobby.

602
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:38,533
You're a good guy.

603
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:39,603
- It's Robert.

604
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,600
- [Adolfo] Who was she?

605
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,730
- I don't know.

606
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,630
- But was she hot?

607
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,380
- She was odd, or odd hot.

608
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,460
- Hey you got someone coming up here.

609
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,360
Give them a flyer.

610
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,180
- Hey, there's this thing tomorrow night

611
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,300
and it's this party,

612
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,350
and my friends gonna.

613
00:25:58,171 --> 00:25:59,470
Fuck him.

614
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,910
- Robert.
- This sucks, man.

615
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,311
- What are you doing, man?

616
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,144
What the fuck, man?

617
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,810
- Every single fucking time.
- Look how many flyers
you got in your hand.

618
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,500
You can't be acting up,
jumping on people like that.

619
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,950
It's a party, not a funeral man.

620
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,783
There's nothing to be nervous about.

621
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:10,870
- So what do I say?

622
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,180
- You got someone coming
up right here, right?

623
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,150
You make eye contact.

624
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,974
Don't jump on 'em.

625
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:17,220
Just say, hey, party tomorrow night.

626
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,053
Hope you can make it.

627
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:19,674
All right, here she comes, here she comes.

628
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:20,674
- All right.

629
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,160
- Are you kidding me?

630
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,370
You look like a retarded Travolta, man.

631
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,200
- Really?
- Dude.

632
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,210
It's a party.

633
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,360
Loosen up a little bit.

634
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,270
(phone ringing)

635
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,103
- Hello?

636
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:36,720
- Hi.
- Hey.

637
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,500
- I'm on a gig right now.

638
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,268
Actually I just stepped
outside for a moment.

639
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,953
We need to see each
other before you leave.

640
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:43,786
- [Robert] Yeah.

641
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:46,734
- [Jenny] What about,
tomorrow, have a day?

642
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:47,924
- [Robert] Okay.

643
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:51,670
- How bout, 9:30, at Mojo?

644
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,120
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, great.

645
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,300
So I'll see you then.

646
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,287
- [Robert] Yeah, I'll see you then.

647
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:00,537
All right, bye.

648
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,953
- Well?

649
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,103
- Tomorrow at Mojo, 9:30, me and Jenny.

650
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,160
Fuck yeah, boy.
- Got 'em!

651
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,403
- Excellent, excellent.

652
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:22,120
(phone ringing)

653
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,183
- Hello?

654
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:30,460
- You're not gonna tell me what to do,

655
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,346
I'm telling you what to do.

656
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:32,179
- [Sara] No, I'm trying to tell you.

657
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:33,012
- Keep your mouth shut.

658
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:34,693
- Bobby.
- Are you Robert?
- Bobby, Bobby.
- Yes.

659
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:35,586
- Do you have ID?

660
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:36,419
- This is my boyfriend.

661
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:37,252
- I do.

662
00:27:37,252 --> 00:27:38,085
- This is my boyfriend, Robert.

663
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:39,300
- All right, we had a report
of a burglary in progress.

664
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,280
We got here, we found her
in one of the apartments.

665
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,457
- Okay.

666
00:27:42,457 --> 00:27:43,358
- She says that you're her boyfriend.

667
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:44,670
That you gave her permission
to be in the apartment.

668
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,753
Is that true.
- I was trying.

669
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,452
- Sir, I need you to
focus on my right now.

670
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:49,200
- Yes, that's, that's my girlfriend.

671
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
Here, there you go.

672
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,793
- [Officer] Right, well
the address on here

673
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:52,626
doesn't match it.

674
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:53,560
- I understand officer.

675
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,010
I take care of Leo Glass in number five.

676
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,990
I have keys.
- Baby.
I missed you so much, sweetie.

677
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,145
- You have a key?

678
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,120
- Yeah.
- All right, go ahead
and try to open the door.

679
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,090
Let me see if your key works.

680
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,993
- Bobby.
- Keep your mouth shut.

681
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:08,930
- See I told you, I told you.

682
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,377
- All right that's
fine, come on over here.

683
00:28:11,377 --> 00:28:12,860
One last question.

684
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,693
- Yeah.

685
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:14,640
- Where's she from?

686
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,386
- She's from, she's from Ver.

687
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:19,292
- From where?

688
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,125
- From Vermont.

689
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,133
- Are you sure?
- Yes, yes I'm sure.

690
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,280
- All right.

691
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,770
- Thank you so much, officer.

692
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,620
I'm really sorry.

693
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,133
- Okay, let me give
you a little piece of--

694
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:29,784
- Can I borrow those for the night?

695
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:30,784
- Let me give you a little
piece of advice, all right?

696
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:31,680
- Yes.

697
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,850
- Next time you're visiting,

698
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,630
don't break into the place, all right?

699
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,740
If you don't have a key,

700
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,282
wait for a person that has a key.

701
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,090
- Absolutely.
- You get it?

702
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,740
- Absolutely.
- I don't think so.

703
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,968
Good luck.

704
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:43,976
- Bobby!

705
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:44,809
Thank you so much.

706
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:47,976
(Sara kissing Robert)

707
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:55,040
(Sara laughing)

708
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,730
Did you see the look on his face

709
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,810
when your key went right into that slot?

710
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,931
He didn't know that.

711
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:02,160
(Sara laughs)

712
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,600
I'm not gonna fuck you by the way.

713
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,570
Oh my God, it's still here.

714
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,933
Oh God.

715
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,613
- You trying to rob this place?

716
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:12,441
- [Sara] No, of course not.

717
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:13,343
- Then what are you doing breaking in

718
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:14,460
in the middle of the night?

719
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,980
- Well I just needed to get my package.

720
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,740
What's there to rob here
besides dead animals?

721
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,690
- [Robert] Exactly.

722
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:21,354
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Okay,

723
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:22,763
cut the fucking bullshit.

724
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,510
- Okay, everyone just
chill out for a second.

725
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,380
- [Robert] No.

726
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,650
- The package, there's no note.

727
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,070
It would have been weird if he came home

728
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,614
and it was sitting in his kitchen.

729
00:29:32,614 --> 00:29:33,532
- You didn't think about this before?

730
00:29:33,532 --> 00:29:34,365
The thought didn't cross your mind

731
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,883
when you dropped it off?

732
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,683
- You got a point.

733
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,590
You got a point.

734
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,580
- Okay, we're leaving.

735
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,766
- [Sara] Bobby, hold on.

736
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:44,599
- We're leaving.

737
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,432
- You're the only one that knows Leo,

738
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:46,265
and I need your help.

739
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:47,098
I have to find him.

740
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:48,764
- We are getting out of here.
- No, no no no.

741
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:49,597
You have to help me find him.

742
00:29:49,597 --> 00:29:50,800
We can stay here tonight, Bobby.

743
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,753
- You crazy, you think I'm
gonna help you find him now?

744
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:53,823
- I'll sleep on the couch.

745
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,040
Come on, Bobby, I
thought you were a nurse.

746
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,530
Aren't nurses supposed to help people?

747
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,370
- I'm here at two o'clock
in the fucking morning

748
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,560
in my pajamas, all right?

749
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,747
- [Sara] No, I know, I
know, you're adorable.

750
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:06,140
- No, this is, this is not a joke.

751
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,520
Who the hell do you think you are?

752
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,353
What makes you think

753
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:10,620
that I should be here saving your ass

754
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,670
and how long have you been?

755
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,800
- Okay, okay, listen all right?

756
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,100
I get it.

757
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,763
We got off on the wrong foot, I'm sorry.

758
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,670
And the whole situation is very ah!

759
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,483
I get it, but,

760
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,930
this is a very delicate
situation and if you knew

761
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,880
you wouldn't be talking like this.

762
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,713
You're gonna feel like such a jackass.

763
00:30:28,713 --> 00:30:29,880
- Okay, then explain it to me.

764
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,257
What's the situation?

765
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,300
I'm done.

766
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,250
- What are you some
kind of soulless maniac?

767
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,350
What's wrong with you?

768
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:41,203
I'm in the street tonight.

769
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:43,884
Shit!

770
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,073
(whimsical music)

771
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:02,503
- Ah, blueberry, my favorite.

772
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:06,640
Hi.
- No.

773
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,549
- Oh God.
- Unbelievable.

774
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:10,830
- Look, hold on, hold on.

775
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,360
The way I see it is,

776
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,420
you can give in now or later,

777
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,180
'cause we both know
I'm not going anywhere.

778
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,013
- I've given in, okay?

779
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:18,167
- Take this as an
opportunity to help somebody.

780
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:19,450
Meet somebody new.

781
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,000
- Yeah well, we've already met.

782
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,310
Enjoy the muffin, all right?
- I promise, I'm really fun.

783
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,460
- Mm-hm.

784
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,027
I think I've already
seen how fun you can be.

785
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:29,191
- Bobby, wait.
Wait wait wait wait wait.

786
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:31,857
Bobby wait.

787
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:33,471
Bobby, wait wait wait wait.

788
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:34,790
Okay okay, let me break it down.

789
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,637
Um, have you ever, have
you ever had a secret

790
00:32:37,637 --> 00:32:39,999
that you couldn't tell
anybody in your life

791
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,290
that was so important but that,

792
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,150
that some fucked up life experience

793
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,610
wouldn't allow you to get what you needed?

794
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,210
Have you ever, have you ever had that?

795
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,140
- Sure, that's the human condition.

796
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,450
We have have those, so what?

797
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,033
- Look, okay okay, I can help you.

798
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:58,180
- I think the only way you can help me

799
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,890
is by leaving me alone.

800
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,640
- I'll do anything you need, Bobby.

801
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,885
It's that important.

802
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:03,718
- I don't need anything from you.

803
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:06,290
- Just take 10 minutes out of your life

804
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,220
and just take me to a
place that Leonard goes.

805
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,313
10 minutes.

806
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,023
10 minutes.

807
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,150
- I can't help you.

808
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,725
This is, it's not my job to,

809
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:20,420
to take care of your psychological issues.

810
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,643
- Oh Bobby, I see it.

811
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,400
- What do you see?

812
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,850
- I see it, I see it, I see it.

813
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,230
I'm so sorry.

814
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,063
Whatever it is.

815
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:32,742
I know.

816
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,363
- 10 minutes, okay?

817
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,910
I'm fine, I'm fine.

818
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,070
10 minutes, okay?

819
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,050
So I have no idea if he's
gonna be here or not.

820
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,800
Just letting you know.
I don't want to get your hopes up but,

821
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,463
a lot of times on a sunny
day he does yoga out here.

822
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,360
- This is where he does yoga.

823
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,663
- Yup.
- oh my God, dog.

824
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,593
Dogs!

825
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:03,533
Hi cuties.

826
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:07,060
(Sara barks)

827
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,390
God, I didn't realize we were
gonna be mountain climbing.

828
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,980
This bag is so heavy.

829
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,350
Thank you.

830
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,061
- You're welcome.

831
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:15,260
- Throw it on there.

832
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,550
I'm like a snail, you know?

833
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,428
A snail has a big apartment on its back.

834
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:21,261
So I just carry.

835
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:22,200
- Yeah, now I'm like a snail.

836
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,520
- I just, I don't buy
into the whole philosophy

837
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,860
of defining yourself
by the things you have.

838
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,470
I mean that's what the society does.

839
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,569
It it it tries to make you think

840
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,740
that that's how you have to be.

841
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,605
But you don't.

842
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:34,850
- Well if you don't define
yourself by your things

843
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,950
then why do you carry everything with you?

844
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,924
- What do you mean?

845
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:40,307
It means everything that
I have is important to me.

846
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:42,770
Don't you have things that
people important to you gave you?

847
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,463
Like your mom or your
sister or your girlfriend?

848
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,690
You don't have a girlfriend?

849
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:52,080
- No.

850
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:56,160
- Are you in love with somebody.

851
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,170
What's her name, Bobby?

852
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,223
- Uh.

853
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,270
Her name's Jenny, okay?

854
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,420
We'll leave it at that.

855
00:35:03,374 --> 00:35:04,970
- Jenny?

856
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,770
I can help you with Jenny!

857
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,640
I know women, I am a woman.

858
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,473
- Yeah?

859
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:10,690
- I am a woman.

860
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,660
Okay, we'll set it up.

861
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,165
I'll set it up for you.

862
00:35:13,165 --> 00:35:14,831
You just sit back and I'll
take care of everything.
- There's nothing to set up.

863
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:16,481
I'm leaving, she has a boyfriend.

864
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:18,286
- Yeah.
- It's complicated.

865
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:19,940
- [Sara] Boyfriends are tough.

866
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,773
What's he like?

867
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:21,606
- He's perfect.

868
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:24,533
- Well what time did they walk in today?

869
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,590
They didn't call, they just showed up?

870
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,920
Yeah, with no appointment?

871
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,800
Well I had I no idea
they were gonna come in.

872
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,540
Sorry, this client came in
and didn't have an appointment

873
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,626
and they wanted us to come
up with a proposal for them

874
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:39,529
on the spot, I just, yeah.

875
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:41,350
- I know, I heard, I know.

876
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,194
I hope they give you unlimited
minutes on that thing.

877
00:35:44,194 --> 00:35:45,340
- It's for the greater good, baby.

878
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,690
You want to eat, don't you?

879
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,646
Hey good morning.

880
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,546
How you doing?
- Hey Glen, good morning.

881
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:50,507
- Good to see you.

882
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:51,409
- Yeah, you too.

883
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:52,354
- Dr Hollerman, this
is my girlfriend Jenny.

884
00:35:52,354 --> 00:35:53,295
Jenny, this is Dr Hollerman.

885
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:54,217
- [Doctor] Hi Jenny, nice to meet you.

886
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:55,050
- Nice to meet you.

887
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,716
- We played doubles last week
at the club for the first time.

888
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:57,822
- [Doctor] Yeah he beat my butt.

889
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,655
(Glen laughs)

890
00:35:58,655 --> 00:35:59,630
- This guys got a hell of
a backhand, I tell you.

891
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,463
- Really?

892
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:01,296
- So what do you do?

893
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:02,129
- Well--

894
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:03,290
- She's actually getting her MFA.

895
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,640
She's going into publishing.

896
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,804
- It's a MFA in writing.

897
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:07,857
- That's terrific.
- She's so talented.

898
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:10,260
- He's a great guy, hold on to him.

899
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,887
- Aw, come on.
- Thank you.

900
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,660
- [Sara] My passion is
traveling, actually.

901
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,869
- [Robert] Yeah.

902
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:19,578
- I love going somewhere
new, it's so exciting.

903
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:22,760
And then there's new food and new places.

904
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,910
Where have you been to?

905
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,260
- I've traveled plenty.

906
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,650
- Yeah, where?

907
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,410
- I've been to Toronto and Niagra Falls.

908
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,190
- Toronto, okay, all right.

909
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,023
- That's like being.

910
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,220
- You need to get on an airplane

911
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,830
and go somewhere immediately, I'm serious.

912
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,390
- Yeah, with what money?

913
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,223
- Who cares?

914
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:39,056
Just get there.

915
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:40,700
- Okay, so you're traveling the world.

916
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,130
You're a nomad, you're a gypsy.

917
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,617
How long is that gonna last you

918
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:45,428
before at some point,

919
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:48,540
you have to figure out how
to put food on the table?

920
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,530
I mean do you want kids?

921
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,669
- Food on the table?

922
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:51,502
- Do you want to get married?

923
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:52,335
I mean what about you?

924
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,470
You're asking me all these questions

925
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,160
about love, love, love, love.

926
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,633
Do you have a boyfriend?

927
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:00,741
What?

928
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:01,574
I'm joke,

929
00:37:01,574 --> 00:37:02,407
I'm just saying.

930
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,559
You know, if you think that it makes,

931
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,745
it would make me feel better
to talk about my romance.

932
00:37:06,745 --> 00:37:07,663
- Just stop, okay?

933
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:09,540
No, no no no no, just.

934
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,140
You do not need to be asking
me anything about my life.

935
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,810
You have no right to pry into my life.

936
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,077
You don't know who I am.

937
00:37:15,077 --> 00:37:17,710
You don't know what I've
been through, okay Bobby?

938
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,463
- All right, so I'm just, I'm sorry.

939
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,820
I just, I was just asking.

940
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,983
I'm sorry, we don't have to talk about it.

941
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:34,993
(phone ringing)

942
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,380
- What up, bro?

943
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,653
- Hey, what's up, man?

944
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:40,444
- [Adolfo] I'm cooking.

945
00:37:40,444 --> 00:37:42,290
Anyway, what are you doing man?

946
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,430
- [Robert] Well you're
not gonna believe this.

947
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,410
I'm in the Hague

948
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,660
and I'm still with that
chick from yesterday.

949
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:49,110
- [Adolfo] The nutty one?

950
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,970
- [Robert] Yeah.
(Adolfo laughs)

951
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,463
At first she was pretty crazy and,

952
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:55,730
I was a little bit surprised.

953
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,910
I didn't know what to
do, but she's not so bad.

954
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,233
- [Adolfo] Why are you in the Hague?

955
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,640
- [Robert] Yeah, you know,
she needs to find Leo

956
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,290
and I need to find Leo,

957
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,199
so at this point I could
really use the money.

958
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,770
He's offered to buy my drawing.

959
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,830
- [Adolfo] What?

960
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,663
- [Robert] Yeah.

961
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,280
- [Adolfo] That's great.

962
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,670
- [Robert] Yeah it's
pretty cool, pretty cool.

963
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,793
But I think it's a real sympathy move.

964
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,420
- [Adolfo] No, oh come on.

965
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,410
No that's validation, baby.

966
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,870
That's nothing less.

967
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,970
A little validation goes all the way, man.

968
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,123
- [Robert] I guess so,

969
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,703
but do you really think
it's worth 300 bucks?

970
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,683
- [Adolfo] Who cares?

971
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:40,130
(Adolfo laughs)

972
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,927
Listen, are you coming
to the party tonight?

973
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:44,940
'Cause it's gonna be epic baby, epic.

974
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,720
- [Robert] Yeah, well
hopefully all that hard work

975
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,812
will have paid off then.

976
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:49,841
(alarm beeping)

977
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,108
- Bobby, Bobby!

978
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:52,721
Oh my God.
- What's the matter?

979
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:53,598
- Come on, let's go!

980
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:54,637
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

981
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:55,748
Come on, grab my bag, grab my bag!

982
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:56,581

and say hey, listen, we're
gonna steal something today.

1007
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:23,590
Can you just wait outside

1008
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,310
or at least have me wait
around the block, but.

1009
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,280
- You sound like a
jaded asshole right now.

1010
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,820
You were happy and you didn't
want to be anywhere else.

1011
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,290
We were in the moment, all right?

1012
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,297
So let's, let's stick with that, okay?

1013
00:40:35,297 --> 00:40:36,200
- [Robert] Okay.

1014
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,353
- And stop being so fucking grumpy.

1015
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,120
- There's only on place
I can really think of

1016
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,853
that Leo's likely to be at.

1017
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,630
- Oh hi.
- Hey,

1018
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,110
you haven't see Leo around
at all today, have you?

1019
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,503
- No, not yet.
- No?

1020
00:40:54,513 --> 00:40:55,346
- Wow.

1021
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,810
Wow wow wow wow wow.

1022
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,147
This place is amazing, oh my God.

1023
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:01,813
- I know.
- Can we just hang out for a second?

1024
00:41:01,813 --> 00:41:03,467
I just wanna look around.

1025
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,153
Hey, can we um,

1026
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:08,640
can we grab some valerian
root when we get outta here?

1027
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,607
- [Robert] What's that?

1028
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:15,607
- It says it's the 19th century
form of Xanax, herbal form.

1029
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,100
- Oh yeah, well if it calms
your ass down we definitely can.

1030
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,500
- Ha ha ha ha.

1031
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,390
- Right after we learn
how to train a parrot.

1032
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,340
- I trained a parrot once.

1033
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,613
- Yeah?
- yeah.

1034
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,640
- How's it working out?

1035
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,083
- I don't know, it's dead.

1036
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,763
The travel section.

1037
00:41:40,676 --> 00:41:42,053
Hey.

1038
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:44,483
We like travel, right?

1039
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:46,920
- Um, yeah.

1040
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,400
- Where we going, where
we going, where we going?

1041
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,290
Pick a place, pick a place, pick a place.

1042
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,123
- Stop.

1043
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,093
- Prague.
- Prague.

1044
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,660
- Where's Prague?

1045
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,321
- How bout Tibet, Sydney, Peru?

1046
00:41:59,321 --> 00:42:01,010
- I'd love to see Tibet.

1047
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,030
- What about Brazil?

1048
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,239
Morocco, Norway?

1049
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,300
- I don't know where I would begin.

1050
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,940
I'd love to see the whole world.

1051
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,773
- Look.

1052
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,883
You could go there.

1053
00:42:09,882 --> 00:42:11,350
- That's beautiful.
- You could go, right?

1054
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:14,150
There and walk into that
building and see what's inside.

1055
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,490
So what's up with this Jenny, huh?

1056
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,000
What's her deal?

1057
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,793
- I mean, she's pretty amazing.

1058
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,400
She's got a really cutesy sense of humor

1059
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,830
and.
- Cutesy.

1060
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,880
- She's really charismatic.

1061
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,713
- [Sara] Mm-hm, mm-hm.

1062
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:35,713
- She walks into a room and
everyone stops for a second,

1063
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:36,588
it's, she's breathtaking.

1064
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:40,362
- Oh yes, she sounds like
a breath of fresh air.

1065
00:42:40,362 --> 00:42:42,069
(Robert laughs)

1066
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:43,113
- She is.

1067
00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:45,490
- Have you tried anything with her?

1068
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,240
- Well, we kissed last Friday.

1069
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,963
- You piece of shit.
- Only once.

1070
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,053
What?

1071
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:53,500
- You're scum.
- I know.

1072
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,560
But I wouldn't expect,

1073
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,180
you're telling me to be brave and explore,

1074
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,010
now you're calling, now I'm
scum and a piece of shit.

1075
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,363
- Wow, you kissed a girl with a boyfriend.

1076
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,290
Oh my God.

1077
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,310
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

1078
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,500
Look.

1079
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,940
- The "Tropic of Cancer."

1080
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,152
- Amazing.

1081
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:13,073
- Yeah, you know Leo's
got that in his house.

1082
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:15,902
- Look, okay.

1083
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,150
You have to read this book, okay?

1084
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,120
It's gonna change your life.

1085
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,950
This guy, he just basically
picks up and takes off

1086
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,960
and doesn't give a fuck

1087
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,110
about anything that he's left behind

1088
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:35,230
and he just goes out into
the world and he just lives.

1089
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,983
And he basically just embraces it.

1090
00:43:39,738 --> 00:43:40,571
You gotta read it.

1091
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,473
Buy it.

1092
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:44,812
I don't have any cash.

1093
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:48,783
God, my nails are a mess.

1094
00:43:48,783 --> 00:43:50,700
- They look fine to me.

1095
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,680
- No no no no, I have to do a little work,

1096
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,513
a little maintenance.

1097
00:43:53,513 --> 00:43:58,240
Just one click little
swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe.

1098
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,163
See, that easy.

1099
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,730
- [Robert] They're cute, they
look like abalone shells.

1100
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,276
- Do you like 'em?

1101
00:44:04,276 --> 00:44:05,311
Thanks.

1102
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:06,661
- Think it fits your style.

1103
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,998
- What are you eating?

1104
00:44:09,998 --> 00:44:11,583
- [Robert] Just some noodles and chicken.

1105
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,883
- Chicken?
- mm-hm.

1106
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,720
- Bobby, animals are our friends, okay?

1107
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,180
- [Robert] All right.

1108
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,770
- They're our friends,
be nice to your friends.

1109
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,750
- Okay, thanks pal.

1110
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,770
I really appreciate you
sacrificing your life

1111
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,110
so I could enjoy you, your deliciousness

1112
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:31,637
and get my protein and
thank you very much.

1113
00:44:31,637 --> 00:44:34,000
- You think you're cute, don't you?

1114
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:36,320
You're not cute.

1115
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,620
So talk to me about Jenny.

1116
00:44:40,629 --> 00:44:43,400
- I don't want to wallow
in my depression right now.

1117
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,740
I have to be excited
about where I'm going.

1118
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,743
- [Sara] Let's not think about that.

1119
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,293
Have you told her how you feel?

1120
00:44:50,712 --> 00:44:53,433
- Sure, she knows I really care about her.

1121
00:44:54,437 --> 00:44:55,270
She knows.

1122
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,103
We kissed.

1123
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:57,133
That's a connection, she gets that.

1124
00:44:57,133 --> 00:44:58,620
Am I gonna just, you know,

1125
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,140
tell her how I feel and
screw things up even more?

1126
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,800
If it really mattered that much to her,

1127
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,000
she would have come to
meet me this morning.

1128
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,020
- She doesn't know how you feel, Bobby.

1129
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,260
How is she supposed to
give up her entire life

1130
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,920
for somebody she can't
even, she doesn't even know?

1131
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,760
- [Robert] I'm not asking her to.

1132
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,593
- Okay.

1133
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,910
Look, you have to tell her how you feel.

1134
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,020
If you want her to come
to you she needs to know.

1135
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,540
Put it down.

1136
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,300
Put it down, gone, gone.

1137
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,133
All right.

1138
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,550
I'm gonna give you V-L-T,
visual love technique.

1139
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,313
It works, it works.

1140
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,313
Okay, look at me.

1141
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,343
Square up.

1142
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,040
Go into your Zen Buddha
place, heart of the Buddha.

1143
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,753
And I want you to imagine
that I am Miss Jenny.

1144
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,523
Whatever you say, I'm gonna
be completely receptive to.

1145
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,110
- Okay.
- Okay?

1146
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,790
All right, take your time
and when you open your eyes,

1147
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,623
I am Jenny.

1148
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,113
- Hey Jenny.

1149
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,080
I really want to have things
be really good with us.

1150
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,564
- Okay stop, that's pathetic.

1151
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:14,753
(Robert laughs)

1152
00:46:14,753 --> 00:46:16,380
- This feels silly, do you have to have.

1153
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,230
- Work with me on this, okay?

1154
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,950
All right, let's do it again.

1155
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:20,783
- Okay.

1156
00:46:25,211 --> 00:46:28,044
(endearing music)

1157
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,230
Hey Jenny.

1158
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,063
- Hey.

1159
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:35,351
- You look beautiful.

1160
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:37,853
- You're so sweet Robert.

1161
00:46:38,747 --> 00:46:40,147
You're always so nice to me.

1162
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,060
- What happened the other night?

1163
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:46,700
- I don't know.

1164
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,076
I feel so confused about that.

1165
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:52,883
I've been thinking about
what I'm gonna say to you.

1166
00:46:53,857 --> 00:46:54,690
- Okay.

1167
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,300
- And I, I still don't know what to say.

1168
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,813
- Do you feel anything?

1169
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:00,350
Am I, am I an idiot?

1170
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,563
Am I alone on this?

1171
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,683
- I feel so guilty.

1172
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,483
And it's not even,

1173
00:47:06,483 --> 00:47:09,640
I don't even just feel
guilty towards Glen,

1174
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,223
I feel guilty towards you, too.

1175
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:16,453
- I need to know, do we have a chance?

1176
00:47:23,669 --> 00:47:24,502
- Bobby,

1177
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:28,345
Bobby.

1178
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,060
(people chattering)

1179
00:47:35,013 --> 00:47:37,106
That was so good.

1180
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:37,939
Are you okay?

1181
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,826
That's beautiful, come here.

1182
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:43,659
Come here.

1183
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:52,710
(Glen sighs)

1184
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,943
- [Glen] Sure beats the
hell out of the office.

1185
00:47:54,943 --> 00:47:55,776
- [Jenny] I know.

1186
00:47:55,776 --> 00:47:56,630
- I ready your story.

1187
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,383
- Falsetto?

1188
00:47:58,383 --> 00:48:00,173
- Yeah, and I read it and I loved it.

1189
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:05,480
And I have a friend of mine in publishing.

1190
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,400
I forget what company she works for,

1191
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,813
but I gave it to her and she read it.

1192
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,290
- What'd she say?

1193
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,860
- Well, if you're interested,

1194
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,020
when the semester's over, she uh,

1195
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,083
would like to offer you an internship.

1196
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,880
I think she said,

1197
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,295
I'm trying to remember
her exact words but,

1198
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:28,350
that you showed a lot of promise

1199
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:31,343
as a young up and coming writer.

1200
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,482
- I do.
- Don't you?

1201
00:48:33,482 --> 00:48:34,315
(Glen laughs)

1202
00:48:34,315 --> 00:48:35,148
I like the way it sounded too.

1203
00:48:35,148 --> 00:48:36,690
It was like print that, print that.

1204
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,480
- [Jenny] Oh, thank you, baby.

1205
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,823
That's uh, that was so thoughtful
of you to show her that.

1206
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,420
What made you wanna?

1207
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,770
- Well, I mean, it's your future.

1208
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,458
It's important to me

1209
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,416
and I just want to do
anything I can to help.

1210
00:48:51,416 --> 00:48:53,107
So.
- Thank you.

1211
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,360
So um, who were you on the
phone with so late last night?

1212
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,343
- Ah, Sammy.

1213
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,400
It wasn't a work related call, I swear.

1214
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,540
Poor guy.

1215
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,123
Him and Roxy are breaking up.

1216
00:49:06,795 --> 00:49:08,160
- What do you mean?

1217
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,180
We just saw them on Friday.

1218
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,180
- I know.

1219
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,300
Um, I don't know what happened.

1220
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,810
She's been, I guess he was just telling me

1221
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,320
that she's been acting
really weird lately.

1222
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,260
- They seemed fine.

1223
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,730
- I know, right?

1224
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,063
- That's too bad.

1225
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,473
- Yeah.

1226
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,773
Got me thinking a little bit.

1227
00:49:28,952 --> 00:49:30,820
- What do you mean?

1228
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,463
- Just got me thinking about us.

1229
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:39,840
Uh, I know that I work a lot

1230
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,640
and I take phone calls sometimes
at inappropriate times.

1231
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,633
But I'm only doing it for us.

1232
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,660
Because, I just want to make sure that

1233
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,680
kind of everything will
be okay for the future.

1234
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,513
I love you.

1235
00:49:58,513 --> 00:49:59,980
You're the most important thing.

1236
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,893
So don't ever think you're not, please.

1237
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,970
- No way.

1238
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:12,343
- Jenny.
- Hey.

1239
00:50:13,538 --> 00:50:14,580
Good to see you.
- You too.

1240
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:16,427
What are you doing here?

1241
00:50:16,427 --> 00:50:18,210
- Oh, we're just, we had the day off

1242
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,460
so we're kind of strolling.

1243
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,300
- I've seen you before,
around, I'm not sure.

1244
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,390
I'm Glen, hi.

1245
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,630
- Glen, it's Morgan.

1246
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:24,990
- We, we go to school together.

1247
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,365
- Your party the other night was so fun.

1248
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:27,198
- I know.

1249
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:28,870
Where you pretty hung
over the next morning?

1250
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:31,500
- I will never drink rum
for the rest of my life.

1251
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,655
- Oh yeah you will.

1252
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:33,488
- You sure.

1253
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,321
(all laugh)

1254
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:36,190
- That guy Robert is so cute.

1255
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,507
He was cracking me up.

1256
00:50:37,507 --> 00:50:39,370
- Oh, yeah.
- Adorable.

1257
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,203
- You think so.

1258
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,363
Yeah he's pretty fun.

1259
00:50:46,617 --> 00:50:48,523
- I don't know why you didn't

1260
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:50,860
hook Robert up with
your friend over there.

1261
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,060
- Morgan?

1262
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,790
She's really not his type.

1263
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,840
- [Glen] She's hot, she's anybody's type.

1264
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,490
- Really?

1265
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,765
She's hot so that makes
her anybody's type.

1266
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:03,598
- [Glen] Just saying.

1267
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:05,140
- She's hot so she's anybody's type.

1268
00:51:06,144 --> 00:51:07,590
- [Glen] She's not an ax murderer, is she?

1269
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:08,423
- Yeah, right.

1270
00:51:08,423 --> 00:51:10,980
'Cause if you're not hot,
you're probably an ax murderer,

1271
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,813
right Glen?

1272
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,890
- Well, guess there's no
better time to do this.

1273
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,840
There's tickets to the theater tonight.

1274
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:20,823
- No Exit.

1275
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,710
You wanna go to this?

1276
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,060
- Yeah, I love musicals.

1277
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,306
I just don't know if I
want to take you anymore.

1278
00:51:27,306 --> 00:51:28,930
(Jenny laughs)

1279
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,080
- Baby, it's not a musical.

1280
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,420
- [Glen] Right.

1281
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,890
- You would sit through this for me?

1282
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:36,258
- Yeah, you know.

1283
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:37,966
You like the theater.

1284
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:38,888
I want to make you happy.

1285
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:39,721
It'll be fun, we'll make a night of it.

1286
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,403
- Yeah, but it's Robert's last night here.

1287
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,700
- [Glen] Well um, maybe
we can get out in time?

1288
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,523
- Yeah, I don't think so, it's.

1289
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:51,263
- [Glen] Well it's fine,
we don't have to go.

1290
00:51:51,263 --> 00:51:53,300
- No, no we, I want to go.

1291
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,320
Yeah, I think we should go.

1292
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,630
I mean, when else am I gonna get

1293
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,540
to drag you to the theater, right?

1294
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,054
Depending on how this goes.

1295
00:52:01,054 --> 00:52:02,911
- [Glen] Depending on how it goes.

1296
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:03,744
- Thank you.

1297
00:52:03,744 --> 00:52:04,908
Thank you so much.

1298
00:52:04,908 --> 00:52:07,575
- You're welcome.
- It's perfect.

1299
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,350
- Hey Leo, it's Robert.

1300
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:12,190
I haven't seen you
around in a little while

1301
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,233
so I hope everything's okay.

1302
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,460
But I was by the house and I was wondering

1303
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,010
if you still want to buy my drawing.

1304
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,240
I didn't see any money there.

1305
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,010
So please please give me a
call before I leave tonight.

1306
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,250
I'd really appreciate it.
I'd love to say goodbye.

1307
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,570
As a side note, there's someone here

1308
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:31,810
that has a package for
you, so give me a call.

1309
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,123
All right, take care, bye.

1310
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,164
- What's he giving you money for?

1311
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:39,064
- It's a, it's a drawing I did of him.

1312
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:41,683
- Really?
- Yeah.

1313
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:43,560
- So you're like a real artist?

1314
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,495
Oh my God!

1315
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,586
Bobby, that's amazing!

1316
00:52:45,586 --> 00:52:46,488
- I guess so.

1317
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:47,386
- You're like Picasso
or Monet or Terenzio,

1318
00:52:47,386 --> 00:52:49,053
I'm so proud of you.

1319
00:52:51,383 --> 00:52:52,661
That's amazing, let's go do something fun.

1320
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:55,610
- Well I think he just feels
bad for me to be honest.

1321
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,210
- No, come on, you're amazing.

1322
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,302
Let's do something fun, let's celebrate.

1323
00:52:58,302 --> 00:52:59,143
- Like what, like what?

1324
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:00,560
- I don't know, anything.

1325
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,410
Be spontaneous.

1326
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,243
Come on, Bobby.

1327
00:53:02,243 --> 00:53:03,076
- Let's get outta here.

1328
00:53:03,076 --> 00:53:04,562
- Yeah.

1329
00:53:04,562 --> 00:53:07,312
(engine choking)

1330
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,103
What's going on?

1331
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:11,940
- I don't know, hold on.

1332
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,730
- Just, you know, give it a good one.

1333
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:14,720
Wait, hold on, hold on.

1334
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,325
Give it a good, you know.

1335
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:19,300
Give it a good solid.

1336
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,866
Come on.

1337
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:21,699
- Oh crap.

1338
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,290
You know how long I had that car for

1339
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,110
and how much money I've put into it?

1340
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,530
- Ugh, poor you.

1341
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:39,700
Aren't you leaving anyway?

1342
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,670
Why do you need a car?

1343
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,780
- My friend was gonna sell it for me.

1344
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,963
- [Sara] For what?

1345
00:53:43,963 --> 00:53:45,880
Fives of tens of dollars?

1346
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,186
- Look, Sara, I think it's
best we go our separate ways.

1347
00:53:49,186 --> 00:53:50,019
- [Sara] What?

1348
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,120
No.
- I gotta catch a bus home.

1349
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,440
- No, Bobby, what about Leo?

1350
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,273
What are you talking about right now?

1351
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:54,106
- What about him?

1352
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:55,290
We're not gonna find Leo.

1353
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,160
I mean we've looked for him.

1354
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,082
How do you expect us to get around town?

1355
00:53:58,082 --> 00:54:01,330
- We can, we can, we
can, we can take a cab.

1356
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,260
- A cab?

1357
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,150
With my money?

1358
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,760
I mean, I can't pay for a cab

1359
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,340
to wander around the city right now.

1360
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,573
- Yeah, okay.

1361
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,393
Yeah.

1362
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:12,500
Money's tough, huh?

1363
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,333
- What?

1364
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,343
- Sara.
- Okay.

1365
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:17,130
Okay.
- Sara, what are you doing?

1366
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,466
- Come on.

1367
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:19,299
- What?
- Oh my God,

1368
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:20,347
the keys are in it, come on.

1369
00:54:20,347 --> 00:54:21,180
- This is crazy.

1370
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,810
You're gonna steal a go-kart.

1371
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:23,989
- Get in the car.

1372
00:54:23,989 --> 00:54:25,870
Or whatever this thing is.

1373
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,620
- Get, God.
- Get in.

1374
00:54:28,575 --> 00:54:29,492
Yes, Bobby.

1375
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:32,251
You in?

1376
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:33,084

- Yeah, you know what?

1391
00:55:55,797 --> 00:55:56,630
I had a pet in school.

1392
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:57,463
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1393
00:55:57,463 --> 00:55:58,618
He was this gimp.

1394
00:55:58,618 --> 00:55:59,451
- Back in your yard.

1395
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:00,890
- Yeah, it was a gimp that
lived in the neighborhood

1396
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,430
and I took him in, I
lured him in with nuts

1397
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:04,557
and I trained him.

1398
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:06,081
Can you believe it?

1399
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:07,170
- Okay.

1400
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,003
- I trained him.

1401
00:56:08,003 --> 00:56:10,667
I trained him to pee in a
cat box in the bathroom.

1402
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,899
- You trained your squirrel
to pee in a cat box?

1403
00:56:12,899 --> 00:56:14,020
- Yeah.

1404
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,580
Yeah, it was awesome
- Yeah right.
You know I used to play golf.

1405
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,413
- You did?

1406
00:56:17,413 --> 00:56:19,190
- Yeah, in high school.

1407
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:20,023
- Sunny?

1408
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,586
Hey.

1409
00:56:22,586 --> 00:56:23,419
(speaking in foreign language)

1410
00:56:23,419 --> 00:56:24,252
Wow.

1411
00:56:26,715 --> 00:56:27,723
- Bobby, come on, let's go.

1412
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:29,523
- Is everything okay?

1413
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,520
- [Man] How's Jeremy?

1414
00:56:32,919 --> 00:56:36,836
(speaking in foreign language)

1415
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,757
- Do you know this guy?

1416
00:56:39,757 --> 00:56:40,590
- No.

1417
00:56:44,691 --> 00:56:45,524
Come on.

1418
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:48,770
- Do you want to explain to
me what that was all about?

1419
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,700
- No, I don't.

1420
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,130
- Huh Sara?

1421
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,270
Or should I call you Sunny?

1422
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:58,219
- I told you, my name is Sara
Landis, I'm from Vermont.

1423
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:00,600
- Oh yeah, well I don't know
what to believe anymore.

1424
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,620
- What do you want me to say?

1425
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,980
What the fuck do you want me to say?

1426
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,560
- Well I told you everything about myself.

1427
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,941
The one time I ask you
a question about you,

1428
00:57:05,941 --> 00:57:08,003
it's like I lit a fire under your ass.

1429
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:10,275
- You know what?

1430
00:57:10,275 --> 00:57:11,108
You know what?

1431
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:12,774
- [Robert] What?
What?

1432
00:57:12,774 --> 00:57:13,607
- You don't give a fuck about me.

1433
00:57:13,607 --> 00:57:14,940
You don't care anything about me,

1434
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,040
or my life or my fucking problems.

1435
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,340
Go back to your fucked up,
bourgeois world, Bobby.

1436
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,910
Go back to your lame ass problems.

1437
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,153
- How can you say that?

1438
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:23,440
- And you lame ass fucking
girlfriend, all right?

1439
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,669
I don't, you know what?

1440
00:57:24,669 --> 00:57:25,568
- [Robert] Do you know what?

1441
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:26,530
- Fuck off.

1442
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,730
- Fine, I will fuck off.

1443
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,880
Here's your everything.

1444
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,860
- Fine!

1445
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:45,693
Fine.

1446
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,623
Sunny was a nickname he gave me.

1447
00:57:49,623 --> 00:57:51,173
- Who, the guy on the train?

1448
00:57:54,822 --> 00:57:57,190
(Sara sighs)

1449
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,023
- No.

1450
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,313
My husband.

1451
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:03,970
- You're married?

1452
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,590
Sara.

1453
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:06,423
Wait.

1454
00:58:06,423 --> 00:58:07,256
Wait, hold up a sec.

1455
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,030
(dramatic music)

1456
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:52,523
- I apologize for overreacting.

1457
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:58,650
I just uh, I was really
caught off guard by him.

1458
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,063
I didn't expect to see him.

1459
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:02,103
- [Robert] Yeah, who was that?

1460
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:08,263
- He's a, he's an old friend.

1461
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,560
He's a friend of my husband's.

1462
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,758
We used to party together.

1463
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,175
- [Robert] Mm-hm.

1464
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,040
- I don't think he knew.

1465
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:21,663
- [Robert] Knew, what?

1466
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:33,500
- My husband, he was called
on a long tour in Afghanistan

1467
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:39,010
and I thought he was coming home

1468
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:42,563
but then he got called on a second tour.

1469
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,733
- [Robert] It must be really
difficult to be apart.

1470
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,943
- You have no idea.

1471
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,523
The last time I saw him,

1472
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,733
he made me blueberry pancakes.

1473
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,963
Brought them to me in bed.

1474
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:36,713
He's gone.

1475
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,030
- [Robert] What do you mean?

1476
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,073
- He's dead.

1477
01:00:53,452 --> 01:00:56,530
(Sara sighs)

1478
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,093
He died about a year ago.

1479
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:05,923
I got a knock at the door.

1480
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:15,203
And they gave me a flag and a letter.

1481
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,993
Your husband's gone.

1482
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:25,830
That was it, I don't know.

1483
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,533
Look, Bobby, you gotta live your life.

1484
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,473
Okay, you need to everything that,

1485
01:01:48,699 --> 01:01:50,500
that you need to do
everything that you want to do

1486
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,010
and say everything that you want to say

1487
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:53,250
and don't hold it back.

1488
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,593
'Cause you don't know,
you just don't know.

1489
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,260
You don't know what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

1490
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,260
You could lose everything just like that.

1491
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,263
You get it?

1492
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,063
You need to talk to her.

1493
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,453
No regrets.

1494
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,273
Time's precious.

1495
01:02:25,124 --> 01:02:27,791
(phone ringing)

1496
01:02:29,294 --> 01:02:31,240
Are you gonna get that?

1497
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,073
- It's okay.

1498
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:34,727
- No, get it.

1499
01:02:34,727 --> 01:02:37,310
It could be somebody important.

1500
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,157
(Sara sniffles)

1501
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:41,133
- Oh, it's Jenny.

1502
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,353
- Answer it.

1503
01:02:45,403 --> 01:02:46,305
- I don't know.

1504
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:47,138
- Are you crazy?

1505
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:47,971
Answer it.

1506
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,220
- Hello?

1507
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,053
- Hey.

1508
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,970
so I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

1509
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:57,993
but I don't think I'm gonna be able to see

1510
01:02:57,993 --> 01:02:59,573
you before you go.

1511
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:04,170
Glen surprised me.

1512
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:05,990
He planned this whole day.

1513
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,410
We went to Sausalito

1514
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,560
and now I think we're
going to the theater.

1515
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,480
I feel like I'm not gonna
get to say goodbye to you.

1516
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:17,990
- [Glen] Hey babe, have you
seen my contact solution?

1517
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:18,823
Who's that?

1518
01:03:20,138 --> 01:03:25,138
- Robert.

1519
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:27,260
- Robert, how you doing buddy.

1520
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,190
- Hey Glen.

1521
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:30,460
- [Glen] Are you, are you leaving tonight?

1522
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,510
- Yeah, I am.

1523
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,863
- [Robert] Oh, okay.

1524
01:03:33,713 --> 01:03:35,470
What are you, at the airport right now?

1525
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:38,148
- No, I've got a red eye tonight.

1526
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,880
- [Glen] Oh, that's rough.

1527
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,980
Listen, good luck to you, okay?

1528
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,750
And if you need anything
while you're in NYC

1529
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:45,583
just give me a call

1530
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:47,890
and I'll do my best to
help you out, all right?

1531
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:53,050
- Glen, I was wondering,

1532
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:55,100
do you guys want to get together tonight?

1533
01:03:56,062 --> 01:03:57,713
- Hold on one second.

1534
01:03:57,713 --> 01:03:59,553
- Do you want to hang
out with Robert instead.

1535
01:03:59,553 --> 01:04:03,009
- I mean, it's his last
night, but, can we?

1536
01:04:03,009 --> 01:04:04,176
Is that okay?

1537
01:04:04,176 --> 01:04:06,772
- Yeah, I'll just change the
tickets for another night.

1538
01:04:06,772 --> 01:04:07,810
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1539
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,880
Hey, Robert, I think we're
gonna scrap the theater plans

1540
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,713
so what would you say

1541
01:04:12,713 --> 01:04:15,480
for meeting us for a
drink at nine o'clock?

1542
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,180
- Yeah that, that sounds great.

1543
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,700
- What's going on?

1544
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,150
- [Glen] Who's that?

1545
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,070
- Nobody.

1546
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:24,080
- [Glen] Are you on a date?
Are you taking a phone call
in the middle of a date?

1547
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,377
- No no no no no.

1548
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:26,210
(Glen laughs)

1549
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:27,043
- [Glen] No, that's awesome.

1550
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:28,137
I think you should bring
her, I want to meet her.

1551
01:04:28,137 --> 01:04:29,470
- No, she's just a friend.

1552
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:30,980
- [Glen] Okay, whatever you say.

1553
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,440
All right, so we'll see
the two of you tonight.

1554
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,510
Ocean's, nine o'clock.

1555
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,640
All right, I'll talk to you later.

1556
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,473
- Okay, bye.

1557
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:41,560
- And?

1558
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,393
- And,

1559
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,620
I think we have a date.

1560
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,140
- Nice.

1561
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,277
Hi five.

1562
01:04:48,277 --> 01:04:50,694

I'm gonna, I'll just be right back.

1575
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,238
- [Robert] Where you going?

1576
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:42,071
- Give me 10 minutes,
I'll meet you in there.

1577
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,737
- It's right here.
- No, I'll meet you in there.

1578
01:05:43,737 --> 01:05:45,220
It's fine.

1579
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,780
Wait for me.
- All right.

1580
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:52,150
- [Glen] So where is she?

1581
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,270
- [Robert] She'll be here soon.

1582
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:56,060
- Who is this girl?

1583
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,210
- It's my friend, Sara.

1584
01:05:58,986 --> 01:06:01,210
- You just never mentioned a Sara.

1585
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:03,010
- I know, you'll get to meet her.

1586
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:03,843
She's cool.

1587
01:06:04,938 --> 01:06:06,110
- [Jenny] All right.

1588
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,060
- [Glen] Is uh, is that her over there?

1589
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:11,772
- Yeah, it is.

1590
01:06:11,772 --> 01:06:14,110
- Oh, hi.

1591
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:15,630
- Hey.

1592
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,840
Wow.

1593
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,900
I love this.

1594
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,363
How'd you put that together?

1595
01:06:20,988 --> 01:06:21,821
Wow.

1596
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,373
Jenny.
- Yes, it's nice to meet you.

1597
01:06:24,373 --> 01:06:25,780
- Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.

1598
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:27,010
Give me a hug.

1599
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:28,607
- [Glen] Good for you, seriously.

1600
01:06:28,607 --> 01:06:30,137
I'm really happy for you.

1601
01:06:30,137 --> 01:06:31,510
You taking her with you?

1602
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,020
- Oh, Sara.

1603
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,104
I don't think she's coming with me.

1604
01:06:36,104 --> 01:06:37,004
- Love the dress.

1605
01:06:37,004 --> 01:06:38,792
- Really?
- She's just a friend of mine.

1606
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:39,625
- Just a friend, hi, hi.

1607
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:40,458

01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:41,365

- Nice to meet you, give me a hug.

1610
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:45,363
Yes.

1611
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:48,165
All right, sorry I'm late you guys.

1612
01:06:48,165 --> 01:06:51,220
- [Jenny] That's all right.

1613
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,410
- Okay, all right, all right.

1614
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,010
Horoscopes, all the way around.

1615
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,390
When were you born and
what's your horoscope.

1616
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:59,690
- December 8th, and I'm a Sagittarius.

1617
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,950
- [Jenny] He's very much a Sagittarius.

1618
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:03,550
- [Robert] Oh yeah, how so?

1619
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,003
- You're very philosophical.

1620
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:08,840
- Yeah, and romantic and passionate,

1621
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,498
and at times unorganized and.

1622
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:13,219
- That's true.

1623
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:14,371
Thank you.

1624
01:07:14,371 --> 01:07:15,400
- Here, I'll take care of you.

1625
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,233
Thanks.

1626
01:07:17,174 --> 01:07:19,248
- We should drink to something.

1627
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:20,358
- [Sara] Yeah, of course.

1628
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:21,583
Always toast.

1629
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,850
- Glen you bought, you make a toast.

1630
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:25,683
- Okay.

1631
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:28,703
To Robert,

1632
01:07:29,777 --> 01:07:32,950
may you have safe travels
and I hope you find

1633
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:36,043
everything you're looking for in New York.

1634
01:07:36,043 --> 01:07:38,720
- Thank you.
- Okay, hold up, hold up, I'm sorry.

1635
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,030
I need to hijack your toast.

1636
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:41,863
My bad.

1637
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:47,040
To living your dreams,
following your heart,

1638
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,850
and trying new things.

1639
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,413
- I like that.
- Cheers.

1640
01:07:50,413 --> 01:07:51,996
- Why not?
- Cheers.

1641
01:07:57,933 --> 01:07:59,330
- [Sara] Looks like a party.

1642
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:01,143
How many drinks are there?

1643
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,476
- [Glen] Enough.

1644
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:04,731
- 14!

1645
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:05,924
- 14.
- Whoa, very good.

1646
01:08:05,924 --> 01:08:06,865
- [Sara] I'm impressed.

1647
01:08:06,865 --> 01:08:09,365
- What a bunch of lushes, man.

1648
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,923
I'm just gonna run to the restroom.

1649
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,615
- You just reminded me I have to pee, too.

1650
01:08:18,615 --> 01:08:20,240
I'm just gonna leave my jacket.

1651
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,073
- Okay.

1652
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:26,810
- She's a firecracker.

1653
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:27,773
- [Robert] Oh yeah?

1654
01:08:27,773 --> 01:08:28,606
- I love it man.

1655
01:08:28,606 --> 01:08:29,783
I guess you got your hands full, don't ya.

1656
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,183
Listen, um,

1657
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:40,340
I know that, this past year's
been a little rough for Jenny,

1658
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:45,650
she's you know, kind of
had a lot on her plate,

1659
01:08:45,985 --> 01:08:48,990
and you've been there through a lot of it.

1660
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:53,776
And, sorta like the other guy in her life.

1661
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:54,926
And I get it, I get it.

1662
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:57,003
And I appreciate it.

1663
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,693
I guess what I'm trying to
say is thank you, bottom line.

1664
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:04,362
And, I owe you a lot.

1665
01:09:06,317 --> 01:09:08,067
More thank you think.

1666
01:09:10,196 --> 01:09:11,751
- Ah, I love your necklace.

1667
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:13,340
- Oh, thanks.

1668
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,010
I got it at a thrift shop.

1669
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,030
- Oh, that's cool.

1670
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:20,690
So um, are you and Robert, dating?

1671
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,100
- Oh, no.

1672
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,370
I love Robert, he's
adorable but, I'm married.

1673
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,510
- Oh wow, okay.

1674
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,343
- Yeah.

1675
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:32,310
How long have you know Robert?

1676
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,630
- Long enough to know he's a great guy

1677
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,030
and guys like that don't
come around very often.

1678
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,160
I'm a better person for knowing him.

1679
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,480
Well, I'll see you out there, okay?

1680
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,313
- Sure.

1681
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,990
- All right well, good luck, Bobby.

1682
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,823
Good luck with everything.

1683
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:55,790
- Thanks, Glen.

1684
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:56,760
- What no.

1685
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,640
No no no, no no no.

1686
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,194
The night's not over yet.

1687
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:02,466
No we still have time.

1688
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:05,060
We should um, we should go dancing.

1689
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,259
Yeah, let's go dancing.

1690
01:10:06,259 --> 01:10:07,411
- Are you sure?

1691
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:08,314
- I have an early morning tomorrow.

1692
01:10:08,314 --> 01:10:09,216
I have some meetings.

1693
01:10:09,216 --> 01:10:10,118
- Oh babe, come on.

1694
01:10:10,118 --> 01:10:11,018
- Well you know what?

1695
01:10:11,018 --> 01:10:13,382
There's this thing that Adolfo's running.
It's at Mighty on Utah.

1696
01:10:13,382 --> 01:10:14,342
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

1697
01:10:14,342 --> 01:10:15,175
- I haven't been, let's go for it.

1698
01:10:15,175 --> 01:10:16,008
- [Jenny] We have to go to that.

1699
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,761
- [Sara] Yes, Jenny.
- I'd really like to say goodbye.

1700
01:10:17,761 --> 01:10:18,770
- We, we should go, we really should.

1701
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:19,660
- [Sara] Yes, Glen?

1702
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:20,921
- Baby, come on.

1703
01:10:20,921 --> 01:10:22,589
- [Sara] Glen.

1704
01:10:22,589 --> 01:10:23,645
- Come on, you want to dance.

1705
01:10:23,645 --> 01:10:24,547
- [Sara] Come on, one more drink.

1706
01:10:24,547 --> 01:10:25,450
- We have enough time?

1707
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:27,920
- Well do you have room
for another Manhattan?

1708
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,670
- Yeah, if she's paying for it.

1709
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,440
- I'm paying for it.

1710
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,030
- All right, let's go.

1711
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:34,813
- Okay.
- You have cash, right?

1712
01:10:40,012 --> 01:10:41,607
- Robert, oh!

1713
01:10:41,607 --> 01:10:42,510
You showed up, baby.

1714
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,140
You showed up in style, man.

1715
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,070
What is this?

1716
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,506
- Glen wanted to do it.

1717
01:10:46,506 --> 01:10:47,403
- Hello.
- Hey.

1718
01:10:49,423 --> 01:10:50,604
- Oh, look at you.

1719
01:10:50,604 --> 01:10:51,437

1720
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:52,901
- Hey, Adolfo.

- How you doing?

1722
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:55,060
I was not waiting for a cab.

1723
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,246
- I can see that.

1724
01:10:56,246 --> 01:10:57,890
I can see that, bro.

1725
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:59,340
- Hey Danny, let this guy in.

01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,149
Party people.

01:11:03,149 --> 01:11:06,018
So, what's going on?

1728
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:08,867
- I'm gonna check my purse.

1729
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:09,700
- I'm Sara.

1730
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,700

1731
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,400
- Adolfo, oh my God.

1732
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,647
I've heard so much about you.

1733
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:17,300

What are you telling your friends?

01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,973
He's not my type.

1742
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,070
- He's not my type either.

1743
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:36,736

1776
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:28,502
- [Robert] Hey.

1777
01:13:28,502 --> 01:13:29,827
- Hey.

1778
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:32,494
You were getting down out there.

1779
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,000
I can't wrap my mind around the fact

1780
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,743
that you're just not
gonna be here tomorrow.

1781
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,570
- [Robert] I'm glad it all worked out.

1782
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:44,403
- Yeah, me too.

1783
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:48,160
So, Sara's cool.

1784
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:48,993
- Mm-hm.

1785
01:13:49,965 --> 01:13:50,942
She's a riot.

1786
01:13:50,942 --> 01:13:52,880
- [Jenny] She's damn funny.

1787
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,030
- Sara's a good friend.

1788
01:13:56,078 --> 01:13:56,911
- Good.

1789
01:13:58,810 --> 01:13:59,643
- So are you.

1790
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,870
- You're a good friend.

1791
01:14:04,812 --> 01:14:05,703
You're the best.

1792
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:09,963
- Just wish we had more time.

1793
01:14:12,742 --> 01:14:13,659
- For what?

1794
01:14:16,371 --> 01:14:18,326
- For everything.

1795
01:14:18,326 --> 01:14:19,450
- There you guys are.

1796
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:21,250
My gosh, I was looking all over for you.

1797
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,070
I can't believe you left
me alone with Adolfo.

1798
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,530
He's crazy, I mean I'm up at the bar

1799
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:25,929
and he was like trying

1800
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:28,000
to give me drinks I
don't like, it was crazy.

1801
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,240
This was a great idea, by the way.

1802
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,530
I'm really glad we came out tonight.

1803
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:31,800
I canceled my meetings tomorrow morning

1804
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,090
so let's just go for it.

1805
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,420
You guys want another drink?

1806
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,820
- [Jessie] I love your
outfit tonight by the way.

1807
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,739
Is this vintage?

1808
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:40,083
- Um, yes it is.

1809
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:43,287
I don't know, I just threw it on.

1810
01:14:43,287 --> 01:14:44,843
(phone ringing)

1811
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:45,676
- Is that your, your phone.

1812
01:14:45,676 --> 01:14:47,880
- Oh, I don't have a phone.

1813
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,603
Oh, it must be Bobby's, hold on.

1814
01:14:51,175 --> 01:14:52,008
- You got it?
- Shit, can you hold?

1815
01:14:52,008 --> 01:14:53,883
- Yeah yeah yeah, let me take it.
- Sorry.
- No problem.

1816
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,350
- Oh, uh.

1817
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:02,370
I gotta take this, sorry.

1818
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,703
- [Jessie] Okay.

1819
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,418
- Hello?

1820
01:15:08,418 --> 01:15:11,126
- What we should do, we should
go wine tasting next week.

1821
01:15:11,126 --> 01:15:12,566
My friend Sal owns the winery.

1822
01:15:12,566 --> 01:15:13,941
We can stop by his place,
it'll be a lot of fun.

1823
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:16,520
The one with the great big tree.

1824
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,984
- Leo called, I talked to him.

1825
01:15:18,984 --> 01:15:19,817
- Yeah?

1826
01:15:24,014 --> 01:15:26,597
- I think I'm gonna go see him.

1827
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:30,529
Well, off to see Leo.

1828
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:40,133
- So, this is it.

1829
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:43,993
- For now.

1830
01:15:45,413 --> 01:15:46,630
I've got something for you.

1831
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,607
But, before I give it to you,

1832
01:15:49,607 --> 01:15:53,170
you have to promise me that
you're not gonna get mad.

1833
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:55,500
- I promise that I won't be mad at you.

1834
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,343
- Pinky swear?

1835
01:15:58,370 --> 01:15:59,800
Wait, okay.

1836
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,170
We're solid, right?

1837
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:02,003
Okay, here.

1838
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,080
I'm sorry.

1839
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,080
I needed some leverage,

1840
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,683
I didn't know if you were gonna ditch me.

1841
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:15,822
I apologize, Bobby.

1842
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:18,200
(Bobby chuckles)

1843
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,560
You said you wouldn't be mad at me.

1844
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,570
I'm really glad we met.

1845
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:23,090
I feel like we met for a reason.

1846
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:24,573
I don't know what it is, but,

1847
01:16:26,878 --> 01:16:27,711
thank you.

1848
01:16:30,487 --> 01:16:31,320
Thank you.

1849
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,053
Okay, come here.

1850
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:46,050
I hate goodbyes, I'm gonna go.

1851
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,920
- I just gotta ask you something.

1852
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,753
- What?

1853
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,610
- What's in the box?

1854
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:57,443
- I don't know.

1855
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,983
You gotta ask Jeremy.

1856
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,893
- Who's Jeremy?

1857
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:06,433
- My husband.

1858
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,623
- Stay in touch.

1859
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,177
Talk to you later.

1860
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:38,840
- I'm gonna miss you so much.

1861
01:17:41,095 --> 01:17:46,095
- [Robert] I'm gonna miss you, too.

1862
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:55,384
(dramatic music)

1863
01:17:58,237 --> 01:17:59,070
- Bye.

1864
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,313
- [Leo Voiceover] Passing stranger.

1865
01:18:37,689 --> 01:18:40,043
You do not know how
longingly I look upon you.

1866
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,153
You must be he I was seeking
or she I was seeking.

1867
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:50,743
I have somewhere surely
lived a life of joy with you.

1868
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:56,470
All is recalled as we flit by each other.

1869
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:59,103
Fluid, affectionate, chaste, matured.

1870
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:04,793
You grew up with me,

1871
01:19:05,894 --> 01:19:06,844
were a boy with me,

1872
01:19:09,068 --> 01:19:09,968
or a girl with me.

1873
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:15,013
I ate with you and I slept with you.

1874
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:18,653
Your body has become not yours only,

1875
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:21,013
nor left my body.

1876
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,453
Mine.

1877
01:19:25,436 --> 01:19:26,269
Only.

1878
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,903
You give me the pleasure of your eyes,

1879
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:34,783
face,

1880
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:37,653
flesh.

1881
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,163
As we pass you,

1882
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:43,810
you take my beard,

1883
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:46,583
my breast,

1884
01:19:48,546 --> 01:19:49,379
hands.

1885
01:19:53,019 --> 01:19:56,283
In return I am not to speak to you,

1886
01:19:56,283 --> 01:20:00,913
I am to think of you
and I sit alone, awake.

1887
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,313
At night alone.

1888
01:20:13,372 --> 01:20:14,455
I am to wait.

1889
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,667
I do not doubt that I
am to meet you again.

1890
01:20:24,441 --> 01:20:27,350
I am to see to it that I do not lose you.

1891
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:53,737
(people chattering)

1892
01:20:53,737 --> 01:20:56,820
- [Attendant] Are you checking
any bags this evening?

1893
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,703
- Uh yeah, one.

1894
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,037
- That'll be $35 please.

1895
01:21:10,249 --> 01:21:12,916
(phone ringing)

1896
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:28,863
- You know what?

1897
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,828
Cancel my flight.

1898
01:21:31,828 --> 01:21:33,130
- [Attendant] Cancel your flight.

1899
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,390
Are you sure?

1900
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,223
- I'm sure.

1901
01:21:36,061 --> 01:21:37,453
- [Attendant] All right.

1902
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,290
Just be aware that cancellation

1903
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:42,150
of all non-refundable tickets

1904
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:47,150
results in $150 administration
fee, plus the difference

1905
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,693
between the previously
purchased fare and the new fare.

1906
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:55,913
Can I reschedule your flight to Rochester?

1907
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,343
- Actually, I'd like to book a new flight.

1908
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:07,170
- [Attendant] Final destination?

1909
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:11,186
(jet engine roaring)

1910
01:22:22,365 --> 01:22:25,198
(whimsical music)
