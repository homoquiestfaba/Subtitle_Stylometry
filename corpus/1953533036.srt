00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,960
Can I trouble you for an autograph?


182
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Sure.


183
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,080
Who would I make it out to?


184
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,800
Oh...


185
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,440
Not you, sir.
I meant Mr Neil Armstrong.


186
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,680
First man on the moon.


187
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
You could mail it.


188
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,880
That's my driver number,
at that address.


189
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,800
OK.


190
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
I promise. Thank you.


191
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,120
Thank you.


192
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
So what do you expect to find?


193
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,720
Mr Feynman, what do
you expect to find?


194
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,960
Pardon me.


195
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,320
Mr Armstrong, I think we met...
Excuse me.


196
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,560
I'm Bill Rogers.
I'm chairman of the Commission.


197
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,480
We're very fortunate
to have you with us.


198
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,200
Hey, I've got somebody
who wants to meet you.


199
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,400
Dr Sally Ride.


200
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Oh... Our first woman in space.
Well...


201
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,960
Nice to meet you.


202
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
You too. Mmm.


203
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,280
Good journey?


204
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,560
I took the red-eye from LA.


205
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,880
Don't ever do it.


206
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,800
Dr Alton Keel,
our executive director.


207
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,720
Nobel laureate, Richard Feynman.


208
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,840
Your name I recognise too.
Fellow physicist.


209
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,880
Formerly. I've been in Washington
several years. Oh.


210
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,400
HE CHUCKLES


211
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,720
How's your integrity?


212
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,920
That's just insulting. No!


213
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,520
Don't take me seriously.


214
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,400
Commissioners.


215
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,240
I appreciate you all coming together
at short notice.


216
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,320
We have a huge, vital task
ahead of us,


217
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,160
upon which might depend the future


218
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,360
of manned space flight
in this country.


219
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,920
Now, I intend for this investigation


220
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,480
to follow an orderly
and proper procedure.


221
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,480
We are not going to conduct it
in a manner that is in any way


222
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,680
unfairly critical of NASA.


223
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,080
Because we believe,
and certainly I believe,


224
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,520
that NASA has done an excellent job.


225
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,440
And I believe that the American
people think so too.


226
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,680
Anyone?


227
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,000
We have to accept the fact
that this shuttle


228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,560
is the most complex machine
that's ever been built.


229
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,320
I understand it has more than
two and a half million parts.


230
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,960
It may be, after due consideration,


231
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,600
it's just not possible
to identify the cause.


232
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,680
Now...


233
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,880
In terms of scheduling...
That's nothing.


234
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm sorry, Dr Feynman?


235
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Two and a half million -
small potatoes.


236
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,400
No, really look - I don't know
much about space rockets,


237
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,560
but I know a little something
about probability.


238
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,880
Something I developed called, um...
path integral formulation.


239
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,840
It's quantum mechanics, yuck, yuck.
But, um...


240
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,640
Basically, what it means is that
you can figure out the probability


241
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,840
of something occurring,


242
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,480
not just when you get
two and a half million events,


243
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,000
but an infinity of possibilities.


244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,200
However large
the number of causal paths


245
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,320
for whatever happened to Challenger,


246
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,280
an explanation can be found.


247
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,720
What are we doing here if
we don't think it's possible?


248
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,080
Right?


249
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,240
Er...Chairman Rogers,
I headed an investigation


250
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,160
into the failure of a Titan rocket,


251
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,040
and I suggest I outline
the procedure we used there.


252
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,200
I appreciate the offer,
General Kutyna,


253
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,800
but I think in this case there's
far less collectable evidence.


254
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
I don't like to contradict you, sir,
but in the case of the shuttle,


255
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,080
as there are human beings aboard,


256
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,040
it generates far more
database material.


257
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,600
Mr Rogers, what the general
said is the case.


258
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,320
There are external cameras,
there are black box recordings,


259
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,200
there are telemetry sensors,
there's a great deal of information.


260
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,880
Thank you, General Kutyna.


261
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,080
And Mr Armstrong.


262
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,600
I'm certain we can get back to this.


263
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,880
Please, anyone.


264
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,960
Chairman. Yes.


265
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,640
I don't know about anyone else,
but, um...


266
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,200
Coming in, I got
some major press attention.


267
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,400
I'd like to know what we're to say.


268
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,920
For the sake of
the astronaut families,


269
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,120
what are we saying at this point?


270
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,680
This is very important.


271
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,760
Any and all enquiries from the press


272
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,240
are to be directed
to Chairman Rogers's office.


273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So, the plan is...


274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,320
lady and gentlemen...


275
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,560
we will reconvene
in five days' time.


276
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,160
But for the present,
enjoy your stay in Washington.


277
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,200
What?


278
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,360
We're not going to..? That's it.


279
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,120
Keel. We don't start right away?


280
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,400
(Great.)


281
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,440
Dr Feynman.


282
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,080
Bill Graham, head of NASA.


283
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,800
Thank you.


284
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,080
You're the guy that got me
into this.


285
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,920
Well, I took your physics lectures
way back, never forgotten.


286
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,440
I think you're going to bring
something unique to the Commission.


287
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,600
I abandoned my teaching and a lot
of important consulting to come here,


288
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,680
didn't imagine I was going to be told
to sit on my tush for a week.


289
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,720
So, here's what I'm going to need.


290
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm going to need a crash course
in shuttle design.


291
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,760
I need to know everything on
how this thing was put together,


292
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,120
so if you can start supplying me with
the technical manuals and so forth,


293
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,240
and most of all, you gotta get me
straight on the factory floor.


294
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,720
Pretty new to NASA myself -


295
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,800
I actually only took over
two months ago.


296
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,360
That's bad timing.


297
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,200
We're based here in Washington,


298
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,760
but the shuttle engines and systems


299
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,880
are all out of the Marshall
Space Flight Center.


300
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,440
It pretty much takes care of itself.


301
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,000
You're the head of the whole shmeer,


302
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,920
I mean, you can get me
in this Marshall place,


303
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
otherwise I'm a busy fella.


304
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,400
I'll do my best.
I'll get on it right away.


305
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,920
Right, thanks.


306
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I like that you didn't let up there
on the mighty chairman.


307
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,200
You take it.
I don't care for limousines.


308
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,280
Well, neither do I -


309
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,240
I'm just a two-star general,
don't get assigned a limousine.


310
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,680
Take the subway.


311
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,960
Hmm.


312
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,280
Pleasure. You too.


313
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,000
Taxi!


314
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,320
Oh, and there was a phone call
for you, sir.


315
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,960
Please call your doctor.


316
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
Dr...Weiss?


317
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,960
The elevator's just
to your right, sir.


318
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,160

a lengthy process.

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,440
Hello.


325
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,680
Graham.


326
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
You got me in, great.


327
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,320
I'll take a plane down
in the morning.


328
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,040
Thanks.


329
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,080
Alpha plus.


330

'I've always had great faith in

'That's the way freedom is and

335
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,600
Wow, it's immense.


336
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,160
This is an identical craft?


337
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
No, it's a training simulator.


338
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,520
but for your purposes, the flight
deck systems, the payload bay, etc,


339
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,040
virtually identical.


340
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,640
Want to see the flight deck?


341
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,720
You have four human beings
jammed in this space?


342
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,760
Can I sit here?


343
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,800
Yeah.


344
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480
Wow.


345
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,120
OK. So...


346
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,000
they got S-Band
communication links...


347
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,640
environmental control systems...


348
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,520
cabin pressure gauges...


349
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,880
What is that? Emergency oxygen.


350
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,080
Don't touch things.


351
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,360
Hmm.


352
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,080
Come on.


353
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,560
Dick Feynman. I'm on the Commission.


354
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,160
I got nothing to hide.


355
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,720
If I was to ask you engineers,


356
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,440
never mind what the managers say,
but you guys...


357
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,000
Given all your experience,


358
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,840
what you thought the probability was
of an accident on any single launch,


359
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,880
what would you say?


360
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,320
I mean, if you don't want to say
out loud,


361
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
perhaps you could write it down
on a piece of paper.


362
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,440
So you're looking at the solid
rocket boosters.


363
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,080
OK, so...


364
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,240
They're not made here.


365
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
No - they're made by contractors,
Morton Thiokol in Utah.


366
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,920
Railroaded into Kennedy in sections.


367
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,960
That's a pretty standard
tang and clevis joint.


368
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,520
Look, there's no ways it
was the solid rocket boosters.


369
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,760
How so certain? Because they don't
fly with holes in them.


370
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,120
If it was the SRB, it would have
exploded on the launch pad.


371
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,400
These kept on flying,
you see it in the footage.


372
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,440
You watched the footage.
Tell me what you saw.


373
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,040
What went through your mind?


374
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,360
What did you think it was?


375
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,880
I thought it was the main engines.


376
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,000
OK. Why? Why the main engines?


377
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,560
Because of the complexity.


378
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,000
They're working at the outer edge
of any experience base.


379
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,800
In the blade technology?


380
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
No, no, no, it's more than
the blades, it's...


381
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,840
Hey...


382
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,000
There is no ways that I'm ratting
out my co-workers here.


383
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,520
Look, pal...


384
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,800
If we're not allowed to find out
what went wrong,


385
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,880
there will be no more co-workers.


386
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,040
All these jobs will be gone, kaput.


387
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,400
Won't be another shuttle launch.

The boats just pulled in
the crew compartment.


408
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,720
Can you tell me,
was the oxygen activated?


409
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,120
Yes, Dr Ride.


410
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,600
It was.


411
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,960
We...


412
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,840
maybe won't make that public
straight away.


413
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,400
Excuse me.


414
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,120
Dr Feynman.


415
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,240
It's very important that this team
stays together all the time.


416
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,400
Why?


417
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,960
It's been reported to me that
you spent some time at Marshall.


418
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,800
Alone.


419
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,360
That's not very helpful.


420
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,880
Oh, Mr Rogers, I don't find it
helpful to stand around.


421
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,360
The other commissioners
are just being respectful.


422
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,760
And you're saying I'm not?


423
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,680
You understand the implications
of the oxygen being activated?


424
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,160
I do.


425
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,560
The astronauts
had to do that themselves.


426
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,640
Which means that they were alive


427
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,440
for at least some of those
two minutes and 36 seconds


428
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,480
before they slammed into the ocean.


429
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,640
Mr Rogers, I'm an atheist.


430
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,120
I personally doubt that
they're touching the face of God,


431
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,400
so I prefer to show my respect


432
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
by finding the cause
of their appalling deaths


433
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,080
and not stand around looking sad.


434
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,240
You know, I didn't even want
to be on this commission


435
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,320
but now that I'm on it,


436
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,680
I've got every intention
of finding out what went wrong.


437
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,040
You know, I don't know that NASA
did an excellent job.


438
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,080
The group will be leaving
in 30 minutes.


439
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,760
Except for General Kutyna,
who's made his own arrangements.


440
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,800
I also may have my own arrangements.


441
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,200
I can't force you to go.


442
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,520
Nope.


443
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,640
Are you going to work all night?


444
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,440
Er...if necessary. I don't know.


445
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,640
How do you plan to get back
to Washington?


446
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,920
Er...I got myself in
kind of a pickle.


447
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,600
I want to go back to Marshall.


448
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,480
Guess I'll hire a car,
but it's hundreds of miles.


449
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,800
I can give you a lift.
I'll drop you in Alabama.


450
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,720
Oh.
HE CHUCKLES


451
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,840
Thank you.


452
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,160
Here. 0600?


453
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,200
OK.


454
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,200
HE CHUCKLES


455
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,720
I may not get a limo,


456
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,160
but occasionally I get the use
of a government jet.


457
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,600
No..! You imagined I was going
to drive you 400 miles?


458
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,760
This is tremendous.


459
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,040
New for you?


460
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,200
You serious? No!


461
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,040
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!


462
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,080
Oh!


463
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,080
It's OK.


464
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,360
You know, what you have to realise


465
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,640
is that you are
uniquely independent.


466
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,640
Yeah, how's that?


467
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,680
Well...


468
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,600
everyone on the commission
has strong associations.


469
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,400
To whom?
Well, to NASA - Armstrong, Ride...


470
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,440
The government - Keel -
Rogers was Secretary of State.


471
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,520
And Bill Graham's even a personal
friend of President Reagan's.


472
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,480
And you?


473
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,520
Me, the Air Force.


474
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,600
BLEEPING


475
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,280
How does the Air Force...
Air Force three niner two six five.


476
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,480
INDISTINCT REPLY ON RADIO
Low on four three zero.


477
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,720
Heading three two zero.


478
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,640
Two six five.


479
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,000
How does the Air Force...
You're the only independent.


480
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,040
I'm independent.


481
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,560
I'm invincible.


482
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,240
Yeah...


483
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,680
but check six.


484
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,480
What check six? That's, um...


485
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,640
That's a fighter pilot's expression.


486
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,320
Six o'clock.


487
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,440
The blind spot. Directly behind you.


488
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
Uh-huh.


489
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,000
Watch my ass.


490
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,160
THEY LAUGH


491
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,920
OK, watch your ass here.


492
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,680
What? It's a little steep.


493
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,440
ENGINE ROARS


494
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,200
That's what we call the diamond.


495
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,080
Wow, now that is very beautiful.


496
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
RATTLING


497
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,800
What the hell?


498
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,160
You happy with that,
with that vibration?


499
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,320
Don't worry, it steadies again
after 65%.


500
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,960
But to get to 65%,
you gotta go through that?


501
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,640
Sometimes, yeah.


502
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,600
Can I see components, the blades?


503
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,840
Oh, what is that?


504
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,600
It's a crack...in this blade.


505
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,720
There's an obvious crack.


506
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,400
Yeah.


507
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,680
The blades often get those
after a flight,


508
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,320
but that's not
a flight safety problem.


509
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,600
Well, what is it, then?
We were told to log it
as a maintenance problem.


510
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,400
Only if it develops into a full
fracture, THAT would be a failure.


511
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,240
So a failure only happens
if it actually shears off?


512
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,280
Uh-huh.


513
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,080
Bull! The failure is the crack.


514
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,680
Well, you could argue that...


515
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,000
The failure is the crack - I mean,
because it's not in the design.


516
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,600
You know and I know
it's not supposed to crack.


517
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,880
Who has the rest of the test data?


518
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,920
Is that it?


519
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,760
I think we should start this
discussion on the step-by-step
process, so...


520
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,480
Concentrate the investigation
on the main engines.


521
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,400
There are cracked turbine blades.


522
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,000
As early as 1,375 seconds,
equivalent to full power level.


523
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,960
Also, at 4,000 hertz,
there are some nasty vibrations.


524
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,920
So you think the cause lies
within the engines?


525
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,720
I'd bet my last dime on it.
I just got back from Marshall.


526
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,160
I just heard an interesting new
definition of the word "failure".


527
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,920
Well, it's interesting that
you should say that, Doctor.


528
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,320
We've just received
the telemetry data from NASA,


529
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,480
and the sensors on the engines


530
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,000
show that they performed
absolutely perfectly.


531
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,040
Get out of here!


532
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:45,240
The engines began to shut down
as fuel pressure decreased,


533
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,800
exactly as designed.


534
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,960
That's extremely lucky,
because I'm telling you, those
engines have profound problems.


535
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,600
Now there is a step-by-step process
for us all to follow,


536
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,840
and I respectfully request
that from now on, you abide by it.


537
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,640
We're all trying to find the answer.


538
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,320
All right, we begin.


539
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,160
Step by step.


540
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,360
Crap.


541
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,560
Prof...


542
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Don't let the chairman put you off.


543
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,960
Look, you should come by the house
some night for a bite,
if that appeals.


544
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,520
Yeah? OK, good.
Excuse me for a second.


545
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,200
(Listen...)


546
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,520
Graham, why didn't I know that we had
the results from the sensors
on the engines?


547
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,800
Is NASA drip-feeding us
information to suit itself?


548
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,000
I hear you. I'm doing this
with one hand tied behind my back.


549
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,040
I hear you, but...
RICHARD GROANS


550
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,240
Richard...?
RICHARD EXHALES LOUDLY


551
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,520
You OK?


552
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,160
I'll see you tomorrow.


553
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,720
I goofed. I thought I had the answer.
I was way off.


554
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,040
'So what are you going to do?
Are you going to stick with it?'


555
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,720
I don't know.


556
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,920
KNOCKING


557
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,760
Listen, there's a knock on the door.
I'll call you later. 'All right.'


558
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,840
I'm not sure why they chose to
just lay them in this order.


559
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,720
It's difficult to tell,


560
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,320
but this is...this is half that...


561
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,720
Chairman Rogers...


562
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,480
NASA's Failure Analysis team
supplied a still from camera E207,


563
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,080
trained on-flight.


564
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,560
It looks like it took a long time
for this photograph to appear.


565
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,280
Well, it's here now.
What is that?


566
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,280
A flame?


567
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,760
Coming from a position on the side
of the solid rocket booster?


568
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,160
Did we know that?
Did we know that already?


569
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,680
Did we get stills from other angles?
Am I right?


570
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,120
They had cameras all around?
Yeah. Yes.


571
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,880
Some of the cameras that were
looking directly at the area


572
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,000
were not working on the day,
I'm told.


573
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,560
Well, that's unfortunate. Hm.


574
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
May I have that, please? Of course.


575
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,440
DOORBELL RINGS


576
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,560
Am I super-late?
I had to pick this up at the lab.


577
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,280
No, no, it's not a problem.
Nice car.


578
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,880
You like it? Like it? I LOVE it.


579
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,680
I don't know if that enlargement's
going to tell us anything.


580
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,080
Let's see.


581
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,640
Well, it's somewhat clearer, no?
No, that just makes
the whole thing wider open.


582
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,600
But the flamer is sharper. But
that flame, where is it originating?


583
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,880
Perhaps what we're seeing
is the tip of a larger flame


584
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,320
on the other side
where there's no damned camera.


585
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,920
A flame is not a cause. A flame is
an effect, it's a symptom.


586
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,880
That doesn't tell us
which component split,


587
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,360
sheared off, cracked.
It shows us nothing.


588
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,680
It takes us nowhere.


589
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,000
I want to show you something.


590
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,800
Multiple successful launches,
identical components


591
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,360
and launch locations,
so what made that day special?


592
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,720
What were the variables?


593
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,840
Take a break, Prof.


594
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,800
Oh!


595
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,480
You lucky fella!


596
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,120
Yeah, I'd be luckier if I could get
it running. It's out of commission.


597
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,440
The carburettors seize
in this weather.


598
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,960
This must be how you stay calm.


599
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,640
Roger The Dodger's got me going
crazy with that process of his.


600
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,720
He's a lawyer. He's working it
through the way he knows.


601
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,640
Yeah, well, maybe some others
are kind of working it through
the way they know.


602
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,560
What? You think somebody's
working it for themselves?


603
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,200
Do you? It's Washington, after all.


604
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,440
I can't believe I got myself
back in this world -
government, politics...


605
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,080
And military guys like me.


606
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,440
You're surprisingly OK.


607
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,760
I guess you had your fill of
military personnel through the '40s.


608
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,440
What was your role back then?


609
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,760
When?
During the war, with the A-bomb.


610
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,280
I did the theoretical figuring.
It was the math.


611
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,480
I calculated how much fissionable
material would be necessary
to make an effective weapon.


612
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,360
It's not a good use of science.


613
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,760
You helped end the war.


614
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,520
RICHARD LAUGHS


615
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,840
Wow, this is beautiful!


616
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,280
Shall we try that Bordeaux?


617
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,560
You go ahead. I no longer drink.
If I drink, I can't think.


618
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
Oh, sir, we had maintenance
look at your heating.


619
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,480
Oh, thank you. Let me know
if you still feel chilly.


620
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,160
Could you help me find the number
of the National Weather Service?


621
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,160
There you go.


622
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,120
Can I borrow this? Sure.


623
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,600
Yeah, please. Not a forecast.


624
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,840
The temperature at Cape Canaveral.
Nearby?


625
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,440
Yeah, Jacksonville, Florida, on
the morning of the 28th of January.


626
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,720
Thank you.


627
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,480
That's the variable.


628
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,840
I got the variable.


629
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,960
It was freezing cold on the morning
of the launch. We need to focus


630
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,920
our questioning of the NASA managers
on stuff to do with temperature.


631
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,840
Temperature?
You're talking about ice?


632
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,920
I don't know.
Perhaps added weight of ice,
perhaps some metal component


633
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,200
becoming brittle.
I don't know which component.


634
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,720
There are only two and a half
million possibilities(!)


635
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm pretty certain.


636
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,160
As certain as
you were about the engines(?)


637
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,040
Anything from NASA Failure Analysis?
Due this afternoon.


638
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,720
Dr Feynman's becoming
a real pain in the ass. >


639
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,840
Well, yeah.


640
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,760
You betcha.


641
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,960
MUTED DISCUSSION


642
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,560
Dr Weiss? Dick.


643
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,000
What are you doing here?


644
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,600
Well, if the mountain won't go
to Muhammad...


645
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,400
You didn't answer my calls.


646
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,880
So you tracked me down
all the way across the country?!


647
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,800
Nah, nah, nah. I'm at Washington
Hospital Center for a conference.


648
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,520
You got an hour to come over there?


649
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,280
Now? Yeah.


650
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,240
Sure. Hold on.


651
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,640
Um...I need to get this delivered
to Dr Keel, Presidential Commission -


652
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,080
this address.


653
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,320
It's extremely important
that it gets there.


654
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,640
Yes, sir. Thank you.


655
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,560
Good to see you!


656
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,440
With a vengeance? Mm-hm.


657
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,920
It's compromising
your remaining kidney.


658
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,680
Show me the cells. It's here.


659
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,200
RICHARD SNORTS


660
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,120
OK. That is not so pretty.


661
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,400
I read up on my chances
if my sarcoma recurred.


662
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,080
What's the deal
if we add in this lymphoma?


663
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,760
It's pretty difficult
to calculate the combined...


664
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,400
Don't weasel it, Doc. It's math.


665
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,680
Look, Dick,
it's not something we see.


666
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,760
The particular cancers you have,
they're...


667
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,520
they're extremely rare. The chance
of having them in conjunction...


668
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,840
Well, given what you were
doing during the war...


669
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,240
If it even matters.


670
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,800
What do you think?
Well, the radiation -
what safety precautions were there?


671
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,200
For the test, I...


672
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,680
For the test I had a pair of dark
glasses, which I never put on.


673
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,640
Jeez, they were...
they were crazy days.


674
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,960
We never slept.


675
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,880
We were on fire, you know,
getting the theory and the math


676
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,520
and the physics. It was a race. We
thought we were saving civilisation,


677
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,880
but then we found out the Germans
didn't have nuclear capability


678
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,800
and we kept on.
The science was...so exciting.


679
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,520
Should have stopped.


680
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,880
We threw a party. While people
struggled and died, we threw a party.


681
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,120
Hey, you were young.


682
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,160
I wasn't a child.


683
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,640
Yeah.


684
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,760
OK.


685
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,040
I guess we'll talk on the phone.
Sure.


686
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,200
I think there are probably
worse ways to go.


687
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,320
Hey, your hands are cold.


688
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,840
All the time. What is that?


689
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,240
It's possibly lymphoma.


690
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,680
The blood gets gummy.
Capillaries lose their flexibility -


691
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,800
they can't expand.


692
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,240
Thanks.


693
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,160
Yeah, just talk to me about
components that are flexible.


694
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,960
What about a solid rocket booster?


695
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,280
Go ahead.


696
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,240
Thank you, Louis.


697
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,880
Hey, I thought
this might be helpful.


698
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,920
It's a section model
of the SRB joint.


699
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,200
I don't want to see a model.
I want to see the real thing.


700
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,560
So there are two O-rings


701
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,920
and they squidge in here?


702
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,360
Correct.


703
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,160
Has there ever been
a history of problems with them?


704
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,080
Well, there has been some erosion,
even some blow-by.


705
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,520
"Blow-by" is what?


706
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,880
Soot getting past the first O-ring.


707
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,920
That would mean that
the seal is incomplete?


708
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,640
Right, but the manufacturer
said that... Morton Thiokol?


709
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,960
Right, Thiokol said that
the blow-by never got past
the second O-ring, never.


710
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,960
But if something prevented
the O-ring from doing its job...


711
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,680
..if it became rigid because,
for example, it was cold...?


712
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,720
I think what we're looking at
is the O-rings


713
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,840
within the seal of the SRB.


714
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,880
Lower temperatures would
diminish the flexibility.


715
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,040
Rubber would get harder,
less malleable.


716
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,400
At a certain point it would be
too rigid to move into the gap.


717
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,680
Bill...


718
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,320
I need any data NASA have
on the timings of spring-back.


719
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:53,320
Resilience of the SRB O-rings
in response to temperature.


720
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,120
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.


721
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,600
Just a reminder that we have
many witnesses today


722
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,840
and the press will be in the room.


723
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,960
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like
to call the commission to order,


724
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,960
so please take your seats,
make yourselves comfortable.


725
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,640
Pilot to co-pilot, fix your hair.


726
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,760
Our first witness is Mr Mulloy.


727
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,040
Mr Mulloy, would you come forward
and identify yourself, please?


728
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,440
I am Lawrence Mulloy.


729
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,280
Solid rocket booster project manager
for NASA


730
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,680
at the Marshall Space Flight Center.


731
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,080
All right. Commissioners? Anyone?


732
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,040
Dr Ride?


733
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,440
Mr Mulloy...


734
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,040
in your position
at the Marshall Space Flight Center,


735
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,800
you'd be aware of
correspondence, memos, etc?


736
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,000
I guess I'm wondering
whether memos exist relating


737
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,560
to problems of launching with
O-rings at low temperatures.


738
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,280
I understand the morning of the
launch was exceptionally cold.


739
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,440
I'm not aware of such documents
at Marshall.


740
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,920
It's not correspondence, but
on the evening before the launch,


741
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,960
as a matter of routine, those of us
from NASA asked our technical people


742
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,840
and our contractors if there were
any concerns about low temperature.


743
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,840
Morton Thiokol, who make the solid
rocket boosters, presented us


744
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,960
with the fact
that the lowest temperature


745
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,880
we had ever flown an O-ring
was 53 degrees,


746
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,080
and they wanted to point out
that we would be outside
of that experience base.


747
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,440
But having heard the discussion,
we...we all concluded that there


748
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,120
was no problem with the predicted
temperatures, and I have


749
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,040
a document from the management
of Morton Thiokol to that effect.


750
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,640
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Mulloy.


751
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,640
You may stand down,
for the time being.


752
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,640
There's some guy in the back
who wants to say something.


753
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,280
I have something to add.


754
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,400
I beg your pardon? I...I need to add
to what he said, please.


755
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,840
All right, sir.
Please, step forward, step forward.
Identify yourself.


756
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,920
My name is Allan McDonald.
I work for Morton Thiokol.


757
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,920
I'm the director
of the solid rocket motors project,


758
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,160
so I was at the launch at Kennedy.


759
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,200
I'd like to say something
about the meeting


760
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,520
the night before the launch
that Mr Mulloy talked about.


761
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,560
Our Thiokol engineers...warned NASA.


762
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,120
They recommended NASA not to launch
below 53 degrees


763
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,280
and I agreed with them.


764
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,760
That was the coldest
that we knew was safe.


765
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,720
So you said not to launch
below 53 degrees?


766
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,920
And what was the actual
temperature that morning?


767
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,320
We believed that, at launch,
it was going to be much colder.


768
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,800
Below 32 degrees, below freezing.


769
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,840
NASA wasn't happy with that.


770
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,040
Larry Mulloy said, "My God, Thiokol!


771
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,320
"When do we launch? April?!"


772
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,400
Let me understand this -


773
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,840
now...are you saying
that NASA applied pressure


774
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,120
to change the launch recommendation?


775
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,160
Yes, sir, there was pressure.
They said, "Go review the data."


776
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,560
Our people in Utah came back,
and recommended to NASA to launch.


777
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,600
I refused to sign.


778
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,440
It is important that NASA be given


779
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,160
the-the opportunity to respond
to what's just been alleged.


780
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,680
We must allow...


781
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,480
What the hell is going on here?


782
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,920
Some people say
McDonald's doing a CYA.


783
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,560
"CYA". What is that?
That stands for "cover your ass".


784
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,720
But if they were warned...
The astronauts sure weren't.


785
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,320
I want to know what's happening
right here between NASA


786
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,680
and the contractors.
We need to talk more to HIM.


787
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,840
Richard. Richard,
the data you wanted


788
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,920
on the resistance timings
of the O-rings...


789
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,800
OK, thanks.
We need to hear more from him.
Can you stop Mr McDonald from...?


790
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,520
Damn.


791
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:05,640
Hi. I need to contact Allan McDonald
with NASA's Challenger
Failure Analysis team.


792
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,000
I phoned, but I was told
he's no longer in Washington.


793
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,680
That information is restricted.


794
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,800
He was on the team
but he's been removed?


795
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,000
I can't answer that, sir.


796
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,840
Look, all I want to do is speak
to Allan McDonald. What?!


797
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,760
So there's no-one I can talk to in
the whole entirety of Morton Thiokol?


798
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,200
There's no-one
who can answer my question?


799
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,600
Well, have a nice day(!)


800
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,760
General...


801
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,520
I tried to find McDonald.


802
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,200
No luck, and it's clear why
his bosses wanted to please NASA -


803
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,720
very big money at stake.


804
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,400
I'll catch you later.


805
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,440
Hey, Graham.


806
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,960
That spring-back on the O-ring
was measured over two hours.


807
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,960
It's useless information.


808
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,200
I'm really sorry.
That's what I got from Marshall.


809
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,600
Remember what it was to be
a scientist before government
got to you?


810
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,440
You don't think I gave you...?
On purpose...?


811
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,960
No.


812
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,160
Look, I have this grand title.


813
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,760
The NASA old guard,
they handed me a list
of who should be on the commission.


814
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,080
It was tough to persuade them
to take you.


815
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,880
I'm sorry to have gotten you
into this.


816
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:21,240
Well, when you read my notes
that I sent, you'll see the crap
that goes down at Marshall.


817
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,040
Notes? My write-ups.


818
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,840
Those analyses and my examination
of the crazy engineering.


819
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,680
Richard. Richard...


820
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:46,560
Sally, did you get a set of notes,
my observations?


821
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,440
No, I haven't had anything.


822
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,560
What the hell happened to my notes?


823
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,960
Sally Ride says she didn't get them.
Did the others?


824
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,240
OK. I had sent over from my hotel


825
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,240
a stack of typed-up notes,
wrapped in brown paper,


826
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,200
proper analyses
of all my observations
of the engineering so far,


827
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,480
with a request for you to have copies
made for each commissioner.
I have no knowledge of this.


828
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,720
No such notes ever arrived
on this desk. Perhaps you
can have them redone?


829
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,040
I don't have time for this!


830
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,360
You trusted your hotel
to deliver something so important?


831
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,000
Yeah.


832
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,760
Dr Feynman, please, as you can see,


833
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,040
NASA is now co-operating fully with
all of our requests for information.


834
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,400
Well, then,
have copies made of everything


835
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,040
and have it sent over to my hotel.


836
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,640
I don't know what's going on, honey.


837
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,880
I landed myself right back
in a load of political crap.


838
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,960
People seem to know a lot more
than what they're saying. 'Yeah?'


839
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,240
And I finally got
a ton of stuff from NASA.


840
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,920
It's full of anomalies.
How can that be critical one moment


841
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,560
and safe to operate the next?


842
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,800
Honey, I'm sorry.
It's best for me to call you later.


843
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,600
'Are you all right?' I'm fine.


844
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,000
'Honestly?'


845
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,520
No, I feel very well.


846
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,600
'Oh, all right. Speak tomorrow.'


847
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,080
Yeah.


848
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,160
"Ivory soap."


849
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,760
"Ivory soap."


850
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,680
PHONE RINGS


851
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,520
General.


852
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,240
OK, look, this is driving me crazy.
I got a room full of NASA bullshit


853
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,400
that just makes me more sure certain
what caused the explosion.


854
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,160
The cold, OK?
We've got a guy who agrees with us.


855
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,960
He gets shoved off the enquiry.


856
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,320
We both know why,
but none of it answers.


857
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,960
There's a logic thing here
that I'm just not getting.


858
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,280
It's about
what is at the heart of this thing.


859
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,160
Why did NASA need to launch so bad?


860
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,880
OK, stop, Prof,
I can't answer this here.


861
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,920
Erm... I'll pick you up
in the morning. 8:15.


862
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,360
And bring full ID. OK?


863
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,200
Goodnight. Goodnight.


864
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,960
Where are we going?


865
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,680
We're going to the Pentagon?


866
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,680
ID, please.


867
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,200
Sir.


868
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,400
Thank you, sergeant.
Stand by outside.


869
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,680
Prof, why don't you
grab a seat down here?


870
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,960
Right there.


871
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,920
NASA. The agency of
the United States Government


872
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,840
responsible for the nation's
civilian space programme


873
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,120
and for aeronautics
and aerospace research.


874
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,320
Note the word "civilian" in there.


875
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,040
The project cost in US dollars
of running the space programme...


876
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,600
The actual cost, I get it.


877
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:03,160
And knowing this is unsustainable,
NASA needs to prove itself,


878
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,640
needs to bolster its purpose,


879
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,080
over and above civilian scientific
research and discovery, OK.


880
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,600
So park that for a moment.


881
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,040
The Air Force, meanwhile,
wants to upgrade Titan.


882
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,440
An efficient fleet of
unmanned rockets to deploy
spy satellites into space.


883
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,040
Paranoia. OK.


884
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,360
Whatever you civilians are told,
we are still deep in the Cold War.


885
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,320
What's it got to do with NASA?


886
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,920
NASA approaches Congress
with a deal.


887
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,760
That seems to make
great economic sense,


888
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,040
the government can stop funding
Titan and instead divert


889
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:38,880
the money to NASA, and the Shuttle
becomes sole access into space.


890
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,200
NASA knocks out the Air Force
and gets a funding boost.


891
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,520
Exactly. Yeah.


892
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,480
And the Shuttle
secures its raison d'etre.


893
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,600
Carrying spy satellites?


894
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,000
And NASA convinced Congress


895
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,720
that by 1986 they'd be able to
launch twice a month, every month,


896
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,160
and on each of these flights,


897
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,720
payload will be made available
to the Department of Defense.


898
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,800
Titan was my project.


899
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,120
But NASA reneges on its obligation


900
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,040
and instead of giving DoD priority,
they started taking Senators


901
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,800
up there, in...just
PR stunt after PR stunt.


902
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,080
And then,
launches start getting cancelled.


903
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,800
The press is beginning to notice...


904
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,280
Congress is getting jumpy.


905
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,280
Yeah, yeah, and the administration
is asking questions.


906
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:34,120
And then last December,
the launch is delayed six times,


907
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,040
and remember NASA had promised
Congress launch at any time,


908
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,200
under any conditions,
and then January 28th...


909
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,880
January 28th launch, it's cold...


910
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,600
It's very cold...


911
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,160
..and NASA feels
under extreme pressure.


912
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,800
And took the risk.


913
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,560
They took the risk.


914
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,640
Why did you tell me all this?


915
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,080
Do you wish you didn't know?


916
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,600
Downstairs, you made me sign
the classified information thing.


917
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,800
That's right.


918
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,680
So what's going on, Kutyna?


919
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,480
I mean, you got me trapped,


920
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,200
I can't spill any of this crap.


921
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,920
It would jeopardise national
security, the Soviets would know.


922
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,560
You guys can't launch
a damned thing in cold weather.


923
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,440
You've been playing me
the whole time. From the beginning.


924
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,440
That weird thing in the garage.


925
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,600
With the carburettor,
the carburettor and the cold,


926
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,600
I was supposed to take a hint. What
is this, some kind of game to you?


927
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,880
No, but it was a nudge.


928
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,920
I heard about the O-ring
via an astronaut friend of mine


929
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,880
who was tipped off, in secret,
by a NASA engineer.


930
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,400
This astronaut's career
has to be protected.


931
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,800
I had to let you get there
on your own, Prof.


932
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,360
Prof. Don't Prof me, you don't play
me, you don't screw around with me.


933
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,440
Listen to me and you'll understand
why I'm telling you this.


934
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,480
I can't do anything with it!
That's the point!


935
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,160
Don't ever tell me anything
I can't open my mouth


936
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,760
and blab to the whole world!


937
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,920
I got to... I gotta get out of here.


938
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,480
Listen...


939
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,200
Richard...


940
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,000
No-one plays me.
What is this, check six?


941
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,280
Remember, I told you that only you
are independent on this commission.


942
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,080
Do others on the commission...


943
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,320
Do they know stuff?


944
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,840
Everyone knows some, or all,


945
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,440
but they're all bound.
This is Washington.


946
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,200
What can be acknowledged,
how, by whom....


947
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,560
You go drag me into this?


948
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,880
No, it's absolutely not, you're
coming at it completely differently.


949
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,680
I told you, because I believe


950
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,400
that you, and only you,
can use what you have,


951
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,080
you can use the science
to cut through the bullshit,


952
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,160
to ensure that the real reason
for those deaths gets out.


953
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,720
That it's made completely
clear to the public.


954
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,480
NASA's forced to admit it,
and has to reform.


955
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,920
I wish.


956
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,200
Why can't people just say things
the way they are?


957
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,480
Cos it's politics, it's dirty, but
you can, you can drive through that.


958
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,800
You can... What's the, what's the...


959
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,320
Can I have your arm, please?


960
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,640
What's going on?


961
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,520
HE GROANS


962
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,360
No...


963
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,440
Not now. Not yet.


964
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,760

965

01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,800

01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,280
The commission?


1039
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,440
Through there, sir.


1040
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,360
I'm sorry, sir.
You can't go in there.


1041
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,640
Who says so?


1042
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,800
Not without a tie, sir.


1043
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,320
Give me strength.


1044
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,040
I'm sure this is going to look
a lot more dainty.


1045
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,600
Good evening, gentlemen.


1046
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:08,400
My findings,
developed, processed, distilled,


1047
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,760
I've saved you the trouble
of running them off


1048
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,760
in case the copy machine's broken.


1049
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,920
Hey, Bill. Will you do the honours?
Sure.


1050
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,760
It's all here. Hi, Neil. Would you?


1051
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,800
Design flaws in the boosters.


1052
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,360
Management failure.


1053
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,200
A cold day. You OK?


1054
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,560
I had the flu, but now it's flown.


1055
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,240
Why don't you just take this chair?


1056
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,560
Thank you.


1057
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,680
And thank you.


1058
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,520
For your fine, patient,
methodical work over the last weeks.


1059
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,920
It's been a difficult period.


1060
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,360
Especially for Dr Feynman.


1061
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,560
Welcome back, Doctor.


1062
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,160
And Doctor, I'm sure that we'll want
to include some of your new material


1063
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,240
in our final report.


1064
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,960
Please remember this is
a very important hearing.


1065
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,520
We're expecting a lot of press.


1066
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,880
And it will be televised,
so please do be prompt. Thank you.


1067
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,040
Prof.


1068
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,720
It's happening again,
Rogers is going to bury my work.


1069
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,200
Yeah, and I just got cornered
outside by the press.


1070
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,680
Me too.


1071
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,160
I think they're ready
to go with "unproven".


1072
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,480
Yep,
or a sniper on the grassy knoll.


1073
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,840
I eat a lot of pickled beets.


1074
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,600
General, I haven't a damned clue
what we're going to do.


1075
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,800
Despite what you may think,
I am pleased to see you back.


1076
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,920
General. Chairman.


1077
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,240
We have a major difficulty.


1078
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,560
The people who best
understand the Shuttle are
the people giving evidence


1079
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,840
but they have the most to lose
by explaining it clearly.


1080
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,000
The public is simply mystified.


1081
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,560
Somehow, we need
to penetrate the fog.


1082
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,840
Welcome back.


1083
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,800
We know what Marshall's
strategy's going to be.


1084
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,000
Smokescreen. Manipulate the science.


1085
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,640
Yeah, they'll make it
into a fuzz dazzle.


1086
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,880
That kills me.


1087
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,720
I have to go.


1088
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,320
You OK? I am fine.


1089
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,800
Neil.


1090
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,440
I've been meaning to ask you.


1091
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,760
Yes, Richard.


1092
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,000
This is for a friend. An admirer.


1093
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,160
Right. Of course.


1094
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,400
Thanks so much, Neil.


1095
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,760
Sorry, embarrassing but...


1096
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,120
Anything for you, Richard.
Goodnight.


1097
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,440
Take care of yourself.


1098
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,800
You asked me for something, now
I'm going to ask you for something.


1099
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,440
No, you picked me up
a couple of weeks ago.


1100
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:50,600
Morning. Morning.


1101
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,200
There's my end of the deal.


1102
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,400
All right.


1103
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,480
Here's what I need from you.


1104
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,120
A hardware store.


1105
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,160
A hardware store. Why would
a super important person want...


1106
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,840
Do you know a hardware store
that opens early? I know a place.


1107
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,080
Come on. Get out of bed.


1108
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,960
The astronauts' families
will be seeking clarity


1109
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,600
on what precisely caused
the deaths of their loved ones.


1110
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,880
NASA witnesses
will be answering those questions...


1111
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,320
Graham, make sure you have
a section model of a SRB joint.


1112
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,200
Are we late? We're good for time.


1113
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,080
Hey. Morning, General.
I guess this is it.


1114
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,720
Good luck.


1115
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,080
Would the witnesses please rise?


1116
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:33,720
Do you swear that the testimony
you will give before this commission


1117
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,680
will be the truth, the whole truth


1118
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,040
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?


1119
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,360
I do. I do.


1120
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,760
Mr Mulloy, did you have
any apprehension


1121
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,680
that a delay in launch would reflect
badly on you or NASA Marshall?


1122
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,520
No, not at all.


1123
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,840
My decision to proceed with
the launch as recommended


1124
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,680
by the Thiokol official
was based solely on the data


1125
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,280
presented by Thiokol Engineering.
Here comes the smoke.


1126
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,400
This is shot right about
August 19th,


1127
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,440
and the thing of interest here is
what we have seen in the O-rings.


1128
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,480
See, the fact is,
before Challenger, we had seen


1129
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,200
no anomalous O-ring erosion
for about a year.


1130
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:25,040
Mr McDonald stated that he thought
that what had been said was


1131
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:30,000
very important - that the secondary
O-ring was in a position to sealed


1132
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,080
during the time of blow-by.


1133
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,640
So you interpreted
Mr McDonald's comment


1134
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,160
as a statement in favour
of proceeding to launch?


1135
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,200
Yes, I certainly did because
Mr McDonald was seated close by,


1136
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,120
and it was clearly
a supportive comment.


1137
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,720
I have a question.


1138
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:50,560
Can you remind me what NASA
calculates the probability


1139
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,360
of shuttle failure to be?


1140
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,160
Failure meaning
the loss of the vehicle,


1141
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,600
and the deaths of the entire crew.


1142
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,920
Dr Lovingood.


1143
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,240
Certainly. That would be...


1144
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,160
..one in ten to the power of five.


1145
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,280
Really?


1146
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,440
Would you explain that?


1147
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,000
Yes, that the probability
of mission success is 100%.


1148
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,280
Minus Epsilon.


1149
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,280
Epsilon. That's a pretty fancy word.


1150
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:28,080
Well, let's put all that
you've said there into English.


1151
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:33,600
So that's, that's one failure
in every 100,000 flights.


1152
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,360
So you claim that the Shuttle
would fly every day for 300 years


1153
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,800
before there would be
a single failure.


1154
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,960
That's crazy, I mean,
how would you ever even test that?


1155
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,280
NASA arrived at that figure
because it was a manned flight.


1156
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,960
Because there are people on board


1157
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,600
but that's not a scientific
calculation, that's...that's a wish.


1158
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,920
And interesting.


1159
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,960
But the figure is very different
from that of NASA's own engineers.


1160
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,240
Based on their direct experience,


1161
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,600
and observation of many known
component problems,


1162
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:10,120
some of NASA's engineers
calculate the probability of success


1163
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,440
as only 99.4%.


1164
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:17,400
In other words, that's roughly
one flight in every 200 will fail.


1165
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,120
AUDIENCE MURMURS


1166
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,440
Rogers, time out.


1167
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,920
I think this would be
an appropriate time to take a break.


1168
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,880
One in 200!


1169
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,520
Wow. That's not what
the astronauts were aware of.


1170
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,760
Potential disaster
every three and half years.


1171
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,000
It won't convince anybody,
there's no proof,


1172
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,920
people don't get probability,
it's math.


1173
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,200
But maybe...


1174
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,920
The segment joint test we did,
the development


1175
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,160
and qualification motor test we did,
as a basis for understanding


1176
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,400
what we could expect
to happen on the joints.


1177
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,320
Mr Hardy. Certainly.


1178
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:54,720
As we see, the temperature
at which the O-rings
would lose their integrity


1179
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,840
would be in the
minus 40 to 50 degree range.


1180
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,000
Minus 40 to 50 degrees.


1181
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,560
Fahrenheit? Sir.


1182
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,040
So they'd maintain their integrity


1183
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:09,480
down to 80 degrees below freezing?
That is correct.


1184
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,800
Mr Rogers? Oh, yes. Thank you.


1185
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:27,200
These O-rings are supposed
to expand to make a seal,


1186
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,680
is that correct? Yes, sir.


1187
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,000
So, for the people to understand,


1188
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,760
what if we take the O-rings out?


1189
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,640
Not have them.


1190
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,960
Well, then hot gas would
expand through the joint.


1191
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:48,400
For the seal to work correctly,
the O-ring has to be made of rubber,


1192
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:53,480
not something like lead, which when
you...when you squash it, it stays?


1193
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,240
Yes, sir.


1194
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,880
Now if the O-ring weren't resilient
for a second or two,


1195
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,240
that would be enough for
a very dangerous situation


1196
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,880
and that could likely occur
at low temperatures.


1197
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,600
No, as Mr Hardy has shown,


1198
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,640
they are effective
down to minus 40 to 50 degrees.


1199
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:19,400
Well, then I just have
one comment for the gentlemen,


1200
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:23,520
that I have always believed
that any scientific concept


1201
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,160
can be demonstrated
to ordinary people,


1202
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:31,080
people with no specialist knowledge
or even much scientific education.


1203
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,680
Co-pilot to pilot,
not yet, just wait. What?


1204
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,720
HE WHISPERS: All right. OK, go.


1205
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:44,000
See. I took some of...of this...


1206
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,440
stuff from your seal.


1207
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:54,440
And I put it in
nothing more than ice water.


1208
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,800
And I discover...


1209
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,080
..that if you put it
under pressure...


1210
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:13,880
..for a while, and then undo it...


1211
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,320
..it doesn't stretch back.


1212
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,360
It stops. At the same dimension.


1213
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,200
In other words,
for a second or two, at least,


1214
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,880
and more seconds than that,


1215
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,720
there is no resilience
in this particular material


1216
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:40,240
at the temperature
of 32 degrees Fahrenheit,


1217
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,920
the temperature of a cold soda.


1218
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,320
I think that has some significance
for our problem.


1219
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,720
AUDIENCE CHATTERS


1220
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,800
REPORTERS JOSTLE AND SHOUT


1221
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,840
Whatever the eventual
Commission Report, I will be writing


1222
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,680
up my own independent appendix
with all my findings, all the design,


1223
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,320
the engineering
and the management problems,


1224
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,080
which I will be handing
to the President myself.


1225
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,920
How much did NASA know about
the effect of cold, Dr Feynman?


1226
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,520
Look. Ask him.


1227
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,600
Let us make recommendations


1228
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,440
to ensure that NASA officials


1229
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,520
deal in a world of reality.


1230
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:43,920
Understanding technological
weakness and imperfections


1231
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,560
well enough to be actively
trying to eliminate them.


1232
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:53,440
NASA owes it to the citizens
from whom it asks support


1233
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,200
to be frank, honest and informative.


1234
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,440
For a successful technology,


1235
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:02,520
reality must take precedence
over public relations,


1236
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,720
for nature cannot be fooled.


1237
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,120
APPLAUSE


1238
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,560
Dr Keel, please.


1239
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:16,720
And Mr President, this appendix has
been prepared by Professor Feynman.


1240
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,400
And by the way, I think I've
figured out who was your source.


1241
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,880
You said, "This astronaut,
this astronaut."


1242
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,080
If it was a guy,
you would have said "he."


1243
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,760
It's OK. I can keep shtoom.


1244
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,440
If you ever fancy
a ride in that old Buick...


1245
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,400
Yeah. If the weather's warm.


1246
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,760
It would have to happen pretty soon.


1247
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,440
I'm sorry this is taking your time.


1248
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,240
I'm not sorry.


1249
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,680
I would have been tremendously
sorry if we'd lost


1250
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,920
but as it is, it was...


1251
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,520
Not a good use of science.


1252
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,040
It's a good use of science.


1253
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,080
I'm OK.


1254
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,240
I'm OK with it.


1255
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,000
I guess there is a kind of afterlife.


1256
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,320
The few bits and pieces that we do
might get remembered.


1257
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,800
General...


1258
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,840
..fix your hair.


1259
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,960
How would you react
to the kind of ethical


1260
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,840
and political dilemmas
portrayed in this film?
