before she hurts herself

Salem,
you were supposed
to be watching her!

12
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:48,940
First we have to
move her over the bed.

13

Okay, but careful
Don't wake her up.

at that, Zelda.

Well, we all have
our strengths.

23
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:14,365
Maybe we could give her
a teensy hint

24
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:15,833
- just so she's--
- Perish the thought.

25
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,969
Do you want her to
start off with a strike
against her from the Council?

26
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,502
The rule is clear.

27
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,771
No matter what,
she can't know
until the full moon

28
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:24,242

and then we can tell her.

I said, he's a senior.

So that means he can't
be seen with a sophomore?

No, it means he doesn't
even see sophomores.

Come with me.

First, you take
the javelin,

415
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,820
and you hold it right here.

Go ahead.
Cast a spell.

Hi, Marnie.

Hello, Sabrina.

Not high.
That is going to be

00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:24,031
Is there a problem,
Miss Littlefield?

741
00:43:24,065 --> 00:43:26,333
No, Mr. Dingle.
There's no problem.

742
00:43:26,366 --> 00:43:27,769
No problem at all.

743
00:43:33,174 --> 00:43:37,012
In my mind, in my sight, make
all of Marnie's answers right.

744
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:38,046
Hmm?

745
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,980
Is there a discussion
you two would like to share?

746
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:41,449
No, Mr. Dingle.

747
00:43:41,482 --> 00:43:44,051
Okay, time's up.

Maybe I'll look at
yours now, Marnie.

750
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,694
Sure, why not.

751
00:44:05,973 --> 00:44:07,441
It seems you've
done very well.

00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:08,509
I have?

00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:11,979
Yes, you have.

00:44:13,982 --> 00:44:16,018
I think I'll go lie down.

I send this spell

Hi.

What happened?

I don't know.
It didn't work.

Nothing.

I've got news.

to the Spring Fling.

I got a date.

Oh, you did.
That's great!

775
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:50,812
Yeah, I thought so.

776
00:45:50,846 --> 00:45:53,248
So, all we have to do
is find you somebody,

777
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:55,217
and it's perfect.

00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,119
That's not going

What's wrong,

I don't understand.
It was going so well!

What's that,

The witchcraft.

It was working,
and then, nothing.

00:46:13,067 --> 00:46:14,035
Zilch.

786
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:15,035
What happened?

787
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:16,938
Well, I was trying
some things out

788
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:18,106
and everything
was going fine,

789
00:46:18,138 --> 00:46:19,473
except that...

790
00:46:19,507 --> 00:46:21,042
well, I was concentrating
on this boy.

791
00:46:21,074 --> 00:46:21,977
A boy?

792
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:23,044
Yeah, you know Seth.

793
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:24,478
He was at my party?

794
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:27,015
He's maybe the most popular
boy in the whole school?

795
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:29,250
Well, I cast a spell on him,

796
00:46:29,283 --> 00:46:31,218
you know, to get him
to notice me--

797
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:33,121
You cast a spell for love.

798
00:46:33,154 --> 00:46:35,489
Yeah, I cast
a spell for love.

799
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:38,092
Well, you saw him.
You know.

800
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,094
Yes, we know,
but you can't.

801
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,029
Can't what?

802
00:46:42,062 --> 00:46:43,464
You can't cast
a spell for love.

803
00:46:43,498 --> 00:46:45,667
No such thing
as a love potion?

804
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:47,636
Not anymore.

805
00:46:47,669 --> 00:46:50,906
In the old days,
some witches,
some bad witches,

806
00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:52,107
did cast spells for love.

807
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,574
And it always ended
in heartache.

808
00:46:53,607 --> 00:46:56,143
So the Great Witches'
Council convened

809
00:46:56,176 --> 00:46:58,379
and it was decided
to abdicate that power.

810
00:46:58,413 --> 00:47:00,348
We got in a circle,
we held hands.

811
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:01,616
We promised.

812
00:47:01,649 --> 00:47:04,252
Love is too precious
for anyone to tamper with.

813
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:06,254
I can't believe
you did that.

Hilda:
Well, it's true, dear.

815
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:11,326
Great, the one power
that might really be useful,

816
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,560
and I don't even have it.

817
00:47:12,592 --> 00:47:15,297
Believe me, Sabrina,
it's better this way.

818
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,632
What's the point
of being a witch?

819
00:47:24,705 --> 00:47:26,607
Maybe she'll be one who
doesn't appreciate her powers.

820
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:30,045
Oh, give her time.
It's not easy, growing up.

821
00:47:30,078 --> 00:47:31,646
You never appreciated
your magic

822
00:47:31,678 --> 00:47:33,981
until you were 200,
if I recall.

As the flames engulfed her,
her screams grew louder.

Her struggle ceased,

826
00:47:41,455 --> 00:47:43,524
a smile locked on
her twisted face.

827
00:47:43,558 --> 00:47:46,695
Such was the fate
of Abby Lang, the witch.

828
00:47:46,728 --> 00:47:49,331
Did she really cause
the storm that destroyed

829
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:51,566
the Isle of May
lighthouse in 1636?

830
00:47:51,598 --> 00:47:53,968
We'll never know.

831
00:47:54,002 --> 00:47:55,737
But they thought so.

832
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,206
Any comments, Sabrina?

833
00:47:58,239 --> 00:47:59,407
No.

834
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,275
One more thought:

835
00:48:01,308 --> 00:48:05,412
during the reign of
Queen Elizabeth I, 1558-1603,

836
00:48:05,446 --> 00:48:09,516
any woman who lured a man into
marriage by the aid of makeup

837
00:48:09,549 --> 00:48:12,219
high-heeled shoes or a wig

838
00:48:12,252 --> 00:48:14,421
was subject to punishment
as a witch.

839
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:17,092
How many young ladies
in this room today

840
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,060
are guilty of the same

841
00:48:18,092 --> 00:48:20,060
with the Spring Fling
just around the corner?

Hi.

846
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:31,672
Oh, it's too bad you had
to go home so early.

847
00:48:31,705 --> 00:48:33,474
We had a great
surprise planned.

848
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:37,111
Well, my guess is I wouldn't
have liked it much, anyway

849
00:48:37,145 --> 00:48:39,214
Well, maybe some other time.

850
00:48:41,114 --> 00:48:42,649
So, I hear Carpenter's
renting a limousine

851
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:43,851
for the Spring Fling.

00:48:43,884 --> 00:48:46,989
I guess my telling him how
cheap he is finally paid off.

I just hope he doesn't
get a white one.

He hasn't, yet.

859
00:48:58,598 --> 00:49:01,268
But I know he'll ask me
when I win the All City.

860
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:04,171
And then I'll put him
out of his misery and accept.

throw a fit.

What?

866
00:49:14,815 --> 00:49:17,151
Come here.

873
00:49:33,868 --> 00:49:35,770
Katy, where are you going?
What are you going to do
with that thing?

874
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:37,172
Mm.

875
00:49:40,174 --> 00:49:42,243

Okay.

Okay.

877
00:49:43,444 --> 00:49:46,114
First, you take
a deep breath
and jump.

878
00:49:46,147 --> 00:49:47,415
Then when you're on
your way back to the ground,

879
00:49:47,448 --> 00:49:48,449
you simply miss.

880
00:49:48,482 --> 00:49:50,584
Miss what?

You miss the ground.

882
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:55,323
Uh, I don't know about
this whole flying thing.

883
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:56,690
Oh, oh, Sabrina.

884
00:49:56,723 --> 00:49:58,625
One of the greatest
treats of being a witch

885
00:49:58,658 --> 00:50:00,194
is being able to fly.

886
00:50:00,228 --> 00:50:02,197
What about that little
thing called gravity?

887
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:05,400
Magic, it's just a matter
of technique, practice,

888
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:06,634
and one other thing.

889
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:07,435
What?

890
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:09,203
When you feel good
about who you are,

891
00:50:09,236 --> 00:50:10,737
being true to yourself,

892
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,174
then nothing
can keep you down.

Bad luck.

Okay?

Yeah.

898
00:50:28,489 --> 00:50:30,092
Ready, girl?
Okay.

00:50:36,429 --> 00:50:38,299
[grunting]

902
00:50:38,332 --> 00:50:39,567
Oh.

903
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:43,670
Um...
Okay, um...

904
00:50:43,703 --> 00:50:45,573
Maybe you should
give it a rest.

905
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:48,842
She needs to
try this on her own.

906
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:50,178
I think you're right.

907
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,312
Okay.

908
00:51:06,259 --> 00:51:07,395
[crash]

909
00:51:07,428 --> 00:51:08,763
Salem:
Get off my tail!

910
00:51:11,632 --> 00:51:13,601
Did they burn
real witches at the stake?

911
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:15,803
No, of course not.

912
00:51:15,835 --> 00:51:17,906
Whoever told you that
was a liar and a fraud.

913
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:20,375
Usually, they were
drowned in a river.

914
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:22,410
- Or hung.
- Thanks, I feel
a lot better.

915
00:51:22,442 --> 00:51:24,444
That was only
the bad witches.

916
00:51:24,478 --> 00:51:25,847
You're a good witch.

917
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:27,214
You've got nothing
to worry about.

918
00:51:27,248 --> 00:51:28,116
Trust me.

919
00:51:28,149 --> 00:51:31,886
Well, I now know how to
get Seth to ask me

920
00:51:31,919 --> 00:51:33,353
to the Spring Fling.

921
00:51:33,386 --> 00:51:35,256
And it's not by using
a love spell.

922
00:51:35,288 --> 00:51:36,256
I found a loophole.

923
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,824
Meow.
Do tell.

924
00:51:37,857 --> 00:51:39,326
Don't be such
a nosy cat.

925
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,462
You'll just have to
wait and see.

926
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:45,667
Hey, Ward.

927
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:47,569
- Hey.
- Hey.

928
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:49,971
All right, we got--

929
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:52,640
Come on, Sabrina.
Get the lead out.

930
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:54,441
I want you
on the field now.

931
00:51:57,911 --> 00:52:00,647
Every dog has his day,
every shark has his fin.

932
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:03,385
But I've got the sneakers
that can run like the wind.

933
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:28,877
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Hi, Marnie.

934
00:52:31,011 --> 00:52:33,247
Okay, let's run
the 200.

935
00:52:34,448 --> 00:52:35,783
Sabrina, are you okay?

936
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:37,752
Yeah, fine, great.

937
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:43,457
Runners,
take your marks.

938
00:52:45,926 --> 00:52:46,960
Set.

939
00:52:46,993 --> 00:52:48,829
Hey, Sophomore.

940
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:50,531
Ready to lose?

941
00:52:51,598 --> 00:52:52,734
[starter pistol]

942
00:52:52,766 --> 00:52:54,335
Harvey:
Go, Sabrina!

943
00:52:54,368 --> 00:52:56,904
[cheers]

944
00:53:01,808 --> 00:53:03,844
All right, my sister!

945
00:53:13,788 --> 00:53:15,857
Go!
Woo!

946
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:22,297
Move it, Katy!

947
00:53:23,364 --> 00:53:25,567
[panting]

948
00:53:36,944 --> 00:53:40,882
[cheering]

949
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:43,484
Woo!

950
00:53:43,516 --> 00:53:45,953
Great, race, Sabrina.
You made record time.

951
00:53:45,986 --> 00:53:49,089
All right, all right.
Yeah!

952
00:53:49,123 --> 00:53:51,458
Look at her!
Woo!

953
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:53,627
Woo!

954
00:53:57,964 --> 00:54:00,401
Wow!

955
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:03,971
Holy Moses.

956
00:54:04,004 --> 00:54:05,806
Coach:
Sabrina,
you can stop now.

957
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,442
Sabrina.
Way to go.

958
00:54:08,475 --> 00:54:09,309
Thanks.

959
00:54:09,344 --> 00:54:11,446
Hey, Sabrina.
That was a great run.

960
00:54:11,478 --> 00:54:13,948
- It was, really--
- Thanks.

961
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:17,352
Careful she doesn't
run over you, Harvey.

962
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:19,020
A little competition
never hurt anybody.

963
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:20,987
One race doesn't
make a winner.

964
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,690
Well, everybody has
an off day, huh, Katy?

965
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:26,059
Yeah, well, I'm just
saving myself for All City.

966
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:28,763
That's when we'll separate
the winners from the losers.

967
00:54:28,795 --> 00:54:30,598
Okay.

968
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:51,119
[chattering]

969
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:01,763
Look, there's
Sabrina and Tonto.

970
00:55:01,795 --> 00:55:03,029
You know, she's cool.

971
00:55:03,062 --> 00:55:04,965
Hey, Sabrina.

972
00:55:04,998 --> 00:55:06,767
Over here.

973
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:10,871
You talking to me?

974
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:13,173
Yeah, you.
Come on, join us.
It'll be fun.

975
00:55:13,207 --> 00:55:15,143
Oh, I don't know.

976
00:55:15,176 --> 00:55:18,078
Don't worry.
Katy went home
to lick her wounds.

977
00:55:19,145 --> 00:55:20,180
There's space.

978
00:55:20,214 --> 00:55:22,183
Oh, well.
Sure, why not?

979
00:55:22,216 --> 00:55:23,518
Great.
Come on.

980
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:25,585
Come on, Marnie.
It'll be fun.

981
00:55:25,618 --> 00:55:28,555
Sure, I mean, I don't think
there's much space

982
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:30,424
left at the table,
but, sure.

983
00:55:30,457 --> 00:55:34,161
Actually, I just remembered
that I forgot something

984
00:55:34,194 --> 00:55:36,196
at my locker, so--
I'm gonna go get that.

985
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,199
- But Marnie--
- Suit yourself.

986
00:55:38,232 --> 00:55:40,067
Come on.

987
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,469
Better go, Sabrina.
There's only so much
room at the table.

988
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:49,209
Fran:
Hi, Sabrina.

989
00:55:49,243 --> 00:55:50,812
- Hi.
- Hi.

990
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:53,680
Katy is so mad.
She thinks you
cheated somehow.

991
00:55:53,714 --> 00:55:55,216
She's throwing a fit.

992
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:58,018
So we were just discussing
Freddi's new nose.

993
00:55:58,051 --> 00:55:59,053
What do you think?

994
00:56:00,154 --> 00:56:01,789
Very nice.

995
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:03,089
Nice?
It's a masterpiece.

996
00:56:03,123 --> 00:56:05,893
I mean, it will be
when the swelling goes down.

997
00:56:05,926 --> 00:56:07,761
Dr. Hoftedder is a genius.

998
00:56:07,795 --> 00:56:09,464
He's going to do
my lips next.

999
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:12,132
What do you think?

1000
00:56:12,165 --> 00:56:14,669
Well, I think
they're fine now.

1001
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:16,603
[chuckles]
You're kidding, right?

1002
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:19,707
How can you be
all that you can be

1003
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:21,575
if you're not willing
to look like someone else?

1004
00:56:21,609 --> 00:56:22,610
You know what I mean?

1005
00:56:23,777 --> 00:56:24,979
So, who does your hair?

1006
00:56:25,011 --> 00:56:26,212
I do.

1007
00:56:26,246 --> 00:56:29,984
Oh, that's okay.
We'll get you out of
your cocoon in no time.

1008
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:33,654
So, are you going to beat Katy
at the All City race?

1009
00:56:33,687 --> 00:56:36,156
I'm sure going to try.

1010
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,126
Sabrina, cut
the modesty shtick.

1011
00:56:39,158 --> 00:56:40,727
We're your friends now.

1012
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,098
[chuckles]

1013
00:56:45,665 --> 00:56:46,633
[slurping]

1014
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:49,237
Oh, sister.

1015
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,638
We're made some
chili, sweetheart.

1016
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:52,573
Would you like some?

1017
00:56:52,605 --> 00:56:54,574
No, no thanks.

1018
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:56,210
I think it could
use some eye of newt.

1019
00:56:58,245 --> 00:56:59,647
Just kidding.

1020
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:00,882
I knew that.

1021
00:57:00,915 --> 00:57:03,717
So, anything exciting
happen today?

1022
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,553
Yeah. I finally got
Seth to notice me.

1023
00:57:06,587 --> 00:57:08,155
What do you mean, got him?

1024
00:57:08,187 --> 00:57:11,892
Well, I found a way around
that no love spell rule.

1025
00:57:11,926 --> 00:57:13,828
I put a spell
on my running shoes,

1026
00:57:13,861 --> 00:57:15,696
I beat Katy, and Seth
was so impressed,

1027
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:16,897
I'm sure he's going to ask me--

1028
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:19,133
Sabrina, didn't you
read the magic book?

1029
00:57:19,165 --> 00:57:20,667
Didn't Salem tell you?

1030
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:21,669
Salem:
Uh-oh.

1031
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:22,803
Tell me what?

1032
00:57:22,835 --> 00:57:24,839
You did tell her,
Salem, didn't you?

1033
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:26,107
You are supposed
to be helping.

1034
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,975
Well, not exactly.

1035
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:30,777
Why didn't you tell her?

1036
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,312
Isn't it obvious?
He wants her
all to himself.

1037
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:33,848
What are you
talking about?

1038
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:36,583
Hilda:
Shame on you, Salem.

1039
00:57:36,616 --> 00:57:38,185
Zelda:
Double shame.

1040
00:57:38,217 --> 00:57:40,922
Would somebody please tell me
what's going on here?

1041
00:57:40,955 --> 00:57:42,723
It's right here in the book.
Where's the book?

1042
00:57:42,756 --> 00:57:44,625
Here it is.

1043
00:57:44,658 --> 00:57:47,295
Witches and cows...

1044
00:57:47,328 --> 00:57:49,230
Humans.
Witches and humans.

1045
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:53,234
Witches are forbidden
to use witchcraft to win love,

1046
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:55,703
but if witchcraft is
used on a mortal

1047
00:57:55,736 --> 00:57:57,103
in any form to win his love,

1048
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:59,640
then true love
is not in his heart,

1049
00:57:59,672 --> 00:58:01,775
and his kiss shall...

1050
00:58:01,808 --> 00:58:03,109
His kiss shall what?

1051
00:58:03,143 --> 00:58:05,212
His kiss shall turn you
into a witch's familiar.

1052
00:58:05,245 --> 00:58:06,848
You mean I'll be turned
into a cat?

1053
00:58:08,147 --> 00:58:09,916
For 90 years.

1054
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:13,587
But if he loves you
with a pure heart,

1055
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,955
then you're okay.

1056
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:18,592
Oh, well...I know Seth
would love me that way.

1057
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:20,160
You know,
with a pure heart.

1058
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:22,730
Then there's no problem.

1059
00:58:22,763 --> 00:58:24,665
Love is something that's
given freely by others

1060
00:58:24,698 --> 00:58:27,167
because they want you
to have it.

1061
00:58:27,201 --> 00:58:30,237
And animal passion alone
begets animal passion,

1062
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,640
just like Salem.

1063
00:58:32,672 --> 00:58:33,873
You mean Salem--

1064
00:58:33,906 --> 00:58:34,941
'Fraid so.

1065
00:58:34,975 --> 00:58:37,143
Salem was once
a misguided warlock.

1066
00:58:37,176 --> 00:58:38,612
But it was worth it.

1067
00:58:38,645 --> 00:58:42,216
Well, I know Seth
and he would never...

1068
00:58:42,248 --> 00:58:45,986
Oh, well...
Then you have
nothing to worry about.

1069
00:58:50,991 --> 00:58:52,759
Teenagers.

1070
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,136
Hi.

1071
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:06,107
Excuse me?
Did somebody say something?

1072
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,143
Come on.
Don't take it
personally.

1073
00:59:09,176 --> 00:59:12,346
So how was your power lunch
with Katy's gang the other day?

1074
00:59:12,379 --> 00:59:15,181
It was no biggie.

1075
00:59:15,214 --> 00:59:16,983
Well, it was to me.

1076
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:19,219
I mean, did you see
the way they looked at me?

1077
00:59:19,252 --> 00:59:20,720
No.

1078
00:59:20,754 --> 00:59:22,189
I didn't.

1079
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:24,091
The truth of the matter is,

1080
00:59:24,123 --> 00:59:25,759
I didn't feel that comfortable
there either.

1081
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:28,161
So?

1082
00:59:28,194 --> 00:59:30,363
So...

1083
00:59:30,397 --> 00:59:33,935
I just wanted
to tell you I'm sorry.

1084
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:36,903
Go on.

1085
00:59:36,937 --> 00:59:39,272
You're not going to make
this easy, are you?

1086
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:40,274
No way, sister.

1087
00:59:41,442 --> 00:59:44,210
Look, I know I've been
acting strange lately.

1088
00:59:44,243 --> 00:59:47,180
It's Seth.
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

1089
00:59:47,214 --> 00:59:48,716
Does your heart
start pounding?

1090
00:59:48,748 --> 00:59:50,150
Yeah.

1091
00:59:50,183 --> 00:59:51,252
And you start to feel
a little faint when he's near?

1092
00:59:51,285 --> 00:59:52,353
Like I might
just fall over.

1093
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:53,987
And your palms
get all sweaty?

1094
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,121
Drenched.

1095
00:59:55,154 --> 00:59:56,189
Have you ever
felt like this?

1096
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:58,058
Nope. No, I haven't.

1097
00:59:58,091 --> 00:59:59,225
So that's not how
you feel about Jeff?

1098
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:01,962
No, that's not how
I feel about Jeff.

1099
01:00:01,995 --> 01:00:03,197
I'm going to the Fling
with Jeff

1100
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,099
for one reason
and one reason only.

1101
01:00:05,132 --> 01:00:06,400
What's that?

1102
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:07,301
He asked me.

1103
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:11,105
He gets bonus points
for having a car,

1104
01:00:11,138 --> 01:00:12,206
but that's all I need.

1105
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:13,908
Shouldn't sell
yourself short.

1106
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,176
I'm not selling
myself at all.

1107
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:16,944
I mean, I'm just
being realistic.

1108
01:00:16,977 --> 01:00:18,946
It's a dance.
It's not a marriage.

1109
01:00:18,978 --> 01:00:20,915
Jeff's fine.

1110
01:00:23,917 --> 01:00:26,120
So, you really have it
bad, though, don't you?

1111
01:00:26,152 --> 01:00:27,821
Yeah.

1112
01:00:27,855 --> 01:00:28,823
Poor kid.

1113
01:00:28,855 --> 01:00:31,725
But you know, once I win
All City for the school,

1114
01:00:31,759 --> 01:00:33,094
I know Seth will ask me
to the Spring Fling.

1115
01:00:33,127 --> 01:00:34,929
I just know it.

1116
01:00:34,962 --> 01:00:37,998
Well, then a girl's
gotta do what a girl's
gotta do, don't we?

1117
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:40,134
Will you help me, Marnie?

1118
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,268
Yeah, sure.
How?

1119
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:43,970
I've got a plan.

1120
01:00:44,004 --> 01:00:45,371
Phase two.

1121
01:00:45,404 --> 01:00:46,906
Well, what was phase one?

1122
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,443
Don't ask.

1123
01:00:52,212 --> 01:00:54,215
I'm gonna win him
on my own.

1124
01:00:54,248 --> 01:00:56,150
Well, of course you are.

1125
01:00:56,183 --> 01:00:58,219
With my help.

1126

[chuckles]

1127
01:00:59,353 --> 01:01:01,288
Right.
So let's do this.

1128
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:02,256
- Ready?
- Yes.

1129
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:04,290

- Okay.

1134

Go, go, go, go!

1135
01:01:44,263 --> 01:01:45,365

Hey, Harvard.

1139
01:02:00,513 --> 01:02:03,116
You don't happen to have
an extra set

1140
01:02:03,149 --> 01:02:04,584
of those questions
for econ, do you?

1141
01:02:04,618 --> 01:02:07,087

The ones on the test
I'm supposed to take
next period.

1143
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,225
No, Seth, I don't.

1144
01:02:12,259 --> 01:02:14,195
Sorry.

1145
01:02:16,897 --> 01:02:20,067
Well, I guess I'll have to get
them from somebody else, then.

1146
01:02:22,002 --> 01:02:25,406
So, you and Katy
still history?

1147
01:02:25,439 --> 01:02:29,576
Well, I haven't
actually made up my mind.

1148
01:02:29,609 --> 01:02:34,815
But I'm probably going to
ask whoever wins All City.

1149
01:02:37,016 --> 01:02:41,855
Unless, well...
Unless maybe you
should ask Katy out.

1150
01:02:41,888 --> 01:02:44,390
Don't be ridiculous.

1151
01:02:44,424 --> 01:02:46,160

Don't you like her?

1152
01:02:46,192 --> 01:02:49,129
Sure, I like her.
I mean, what's not to like?

01:20:01,293 --> 01:20:03,996
I thought you said
there were going to be
a lot of other people here.

1429
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,066
Everybody that counts
is in this car right now.

1430
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,304
But I think what
we need here is

1431
01:20:12,338 --> 01:20:14,073
a little less talk

1432
01:20:14,106 --> 01:20:17,310
and a little more action.

1433
01:20:18,377 --> 01:20:20,245
Relax.

1434
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:22,248
I'm relaxed.

1435
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,284
I want us to get
to know each other.

1436
01:20:25,317 --> 01:20:27,387
Sabrina.

1437
01:20:30,222 --> 01:20:31,391
It's getting late.

1438
01:20:31,423 --> 01:20:33,426
No, we have the whole night.

1439
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:36,562
I mean, nobody comes back
from the Fling until dawn.

1440
01:20:36,594 --> 01:20:39,265
It'd be uncool.

1441
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:41,334
It would?

1442
01:20:41,366 --> 01:20:43,168
Yes.

1443
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:44,536
It would.

1444
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,043
Seth, I want you
to take me back now.

1445
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:52,279
You want me
to take you back?

1446
01:20:53,445 --> 01:20:54,513
Yeah. You promised.

1447
01:20:56,716 --> 01:20:58,217
I promised that?

1448
01:20:58,249 --> 01:20:59,584
Yes.

1449
01:20:59,618 --> 01:21:01,085
Oh.

1450
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:04,623
Oh, yeah, that must have
been me trying to get you
to come to Lookout.

1451
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:06,325
I, uh--

1452
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:09,128
Oh, come on.

1453
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,128
Just one kiss.

1454
01:21:10,161 --> 01:21:11,564
No.

1455
01:21:11,597 --> 01:21:13,199
Just come on.

1456
01:21:13,231 --> 01:21:15,234
No.

1457
01:21:16,401 --> 01:21:17,703
You lied to me.

1458
01:21:19,371 --> 01:21:21,207
Then why'd you
come up here?

1459
01:21:23,142 --> 01:21:25,078
I don't know.

1460
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:26,311
Don't know what?

1461
01:21:26,344 --> 01:21:28,181
Look, come on.

1462
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:36,254
Where are you going?

1463
01:21:36,288 --> 01:21:40,325
The dance is almost over.
We won't make it
back now, anyway.

1464
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:42,361
So get back in the car.

1465
01:21:42,395 --> 01:21:45,263
I wouldn't get back in that car
with you for anything.

1466
01:21:45,297 --> 01:21:46,232
You're no boy scout.

1467
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:49,768
Fine. You can walk, then.

01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,698
Come on.

1488
01:22:53,731 --> 01:22:56,735
Well, if you really want to
know, I came to rescue you.

1489

But I can see
you're okay.

I'm not so sure.

I've been a real idiot.

Don't be hard on yourself.

1494
01:23:10,883 --> 01:23:12,285
Can you forgive me?

01:23:12,317 --> 01:23:14,419

You know, I only
have one regret.

1499
01:23:20,825 --> 01:23:24,196
That we won't get to
have our dance.

We can still make it.
