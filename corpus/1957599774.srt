1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,530
The following dramatization, although fictionalized,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,533
was inspired by an actual event.

3
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:11,934
(lightly tense music)

4
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:33,772
(crowd chattering)

5
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:52,128
(guests chattering)
(light upbeat music)

6
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:08,466
It's very sexy, very sexy.

7
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:09,299
Waitress?

8
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,972
Excuse me!
Ah, waitress?

9
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,411
What's it like?

10
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,683
Beautiful, barren, dank.

11
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:16,633
I remember one time

12
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:19,465
I camped under the stars,

13
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:21,990
and I felt something crawl over my chest.

14
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,960
And I froze not breathing till it crawled away.

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,539
And I looked, it was a tiger snake,

16
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,512
one of the deadliest snakes in the world.

17
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:30,345
Oh god.

18
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:33,343
Yeah, I didn't know what to do.

19
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,676
Round for everybody.

20
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:38,620
What are you laughing for?

21
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,467
Well I tell you no.

22
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:44,443
No, it wasn't funny. (chuckling)

23
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,880
Stay right there.

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,643
Stay right there.

25
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:52,637
Dangerous in here, like the Outback.

26
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,622
Oh, I got it.

27
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,413
Looks good.

28
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,663
Thanks, mate.

29
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:08,333
Don't mention it, cowboy.

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,710
Hey, hey, over here, over here.

31
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,073
Hey, hey, you're ignoring my friend right here.

32
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,523
Right here.

33
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,140
What can I get you?

34
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,990
I don't remember anymore.

35
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,823
I do.

36
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,579
Thanks, but I think you were flirting

37
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,630
with a punch in the nose there.

38
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,630
From him or your boyfriend?

39
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,807
Hey.

40
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:32,640
Seeya.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,473
Have a nice time.

42
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,303
You know those clowns?

43
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:37,350
Nope.

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,183
Good.

45
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:42,433
And by the way, Tad isn't my boyfriend,

46
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,180
We just work together.

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,579
We drove in from Sacramento.

48
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,350
In fact, there's a group of us over there.

49
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,320
You're welcome to join us and tell us

50
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,583
all about life and death in the outback.

51
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:57,263
You already heard my best whopper.

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,150
You're not Australian.

53
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,763
The accent was the costume.

54
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:03,596
Oh, hmm.

55
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,680
So why are you giving it up now?

56
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,513
I don't know.

57
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:09,743
I just didn't feel like putting you on.

58
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,603
Well, I have a confession to make.

59
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:18,390
I'm not a real cowboy.

60
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,283
No kidding.

61
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:26,170
You can still join my friends and I if you want.

62
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,303
Does it have to be with your friends?

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,250
Tad, can you handle the drinks?

64
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,970
I think so.

65
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,810
It's a pretty neat, Alyson.

66
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,160
It's very lyrical, Alyson.

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,550
What's yours?

68
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,899
Dave.

69
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,260
It's not quite as lyrical.

70
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,050
Same with the last name, Bay.

71
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,540
Dave Bay.
Dave Bay.

72
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,350
I like that.

73
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,963
It's short, simple.

74
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,523
The name, not you.

75
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:59,200
You're tall and complicated.

76
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,550
What makes you say that?

77
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,383
Well you are tall.

78
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:02,527
I mean the complicated.

79
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,350
Because you had me buying the Australian thing

80
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,110
and then all of a sudden you just dropped it.

81
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,080
I didn't like the fact that you were buying it.

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,940
Although, actually I did live in Australia

83
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,773
for a while as a kid.

84
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:14,700
My dad was ambassador.

85
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,806
Oh, so you want me to buy this one?

86
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:16,639
He really was.

87
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,555
An ambassador.
Really?

88
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,490
So how long were you there for?

89
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,920
Not long.

90
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,763
My parents were killed, small plane.

91
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

92
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,077
I was sent back to the States, the foster parents.

93
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:31,910
And how was that?

94
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,330
It was fine, they were great.

95
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,473
I took their name, Bay.

96
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:38,590
Oh, oh!
Hey.

97
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,979
You know what, are you hungry?

98
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,963
I'm always hungry.
Aha, there you are.

99
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:43,900
Come on, Alyson,

100
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,110
we're gonna head to some other spots.

101
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,043
Yeah, we should go to the-
Sure.

102
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:48,803
I think I'm gonna stay a while.

103
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,885
I got my car.

104
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:55,052
Okay, okay, seeya.
Yeah, all right.

105
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,293
Let me make a quick phone call.

106
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:59,126
Okay.

107
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,740
I got my hands on two F-14 Tomcats.

108
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,240
It's what they've been wanting.

109
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,740
No, don't say a thing, it'd be my little surprise.

110
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,830
Yeah, I'm at the base,

111
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,530
but I'll be unreachable the rest of the night.

112
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,353
We're in the middle of a training exercise.

113
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,603
Okay.

114
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,903
My parents are still married, 41 years.

115
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,533
Three brothers, three sisters,

116
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,150
all of us close enough to make Norman Rockwell gag.

117
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,923
Sounds nice, I miss that, having a family.

118
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:29,002
What about your foster family?

119
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:31,431
No, no, they're gone too, it's just me.

120
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,263
Oh, I'm sorry.

121
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:36,614
Here I am going on about my wonderful family

122
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:37,533
and everything.
No, no.

123
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,080
I like hearing it.

124
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:46,969
There's a downside to all that family stuff too, you know.

125
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:51,053
Like fortuning Christmas presents.

126
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,100
And everyone asking, why aren't you married?

127
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,330
Why aren't you married?

128
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,230
I knew you were going to ask that.

129
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,553
I retract the question.

130
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:01,663
Why aren't you married?

131
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:03,033
Because of my work.

132
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,237
You're a priest.

133
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,270
I work for the government.

134
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,920
Part of the military.

135
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,203
What I do is,

136
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,850
it's dangerous and secret and to be good at it,

137
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,990
you have to be alone with no one to care about

138
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,390
and no one caring about you.

139
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,890
So I guess you can't tell me where you live either, huh?

140
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,290
I don't live any one place

141
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,110
and I'm going to be leaving here tomorrow.

142
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,213
And I can't tell you where I'm going.

143
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,039
(sultry jazz music)

144
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,080
I wish I could be completely open with you

145
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,700
because I think you're great

146
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,093
and tonight's one of the nicest nights I've had ever.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,310
But as weird as this might sound

148
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,010
it's for your own good that you know as little

149
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,223
about my current circumstances as possible.

150
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:11,096
But we have the rest of the night.

151
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,483
Oh, Dave, tonight.

152
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,640
Tonight's been real nice for me too.

153
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,893
You're very attractive,

154
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,913
interesting guy, but I,

155
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,080
but I don't want a one night kind of thing.

156
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,913
You know what I mean?

157
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:29,870
I mean, I've done it.

158
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,653
I don't need to go there again.

159
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,503
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,480
I think you're hot, shoot me.

161
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:44,005
I just don't wanna leave yet.

162
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:46,343
Can we just hang on a while?

163
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,823
Sure.

164
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:07,197
(gentle music)

165
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,910
What happens if you fall into enemy hands?

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,070
After 48 hours,

167
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,150
any information you possess will become obsolete.

168
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,690
The enemy knows that!

169
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,490
They will do anything to break you in those first hours.

170
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,823
Your lungs will fill with water.

171
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,460
Your captors may not know the fine line

172
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,010
between life and death.

173
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,462
Maybe you'll drown!

174
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:50,133
(coughing) I'm drowning!

175
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:01,341
Dammit!

176
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:05,480
You broke!

177
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,610
You showed no control.

178
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,550
All you have is control, you read me?!

179
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,531
Do you read me?!

180
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,668
Yes, sir!

181
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:12,501
Get out!

182
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,880
Johnson!
Sir!

183
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,713
Bag me!

184
00:09:55,723 --> 00:09:56,910
He hasn't moved.

185
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,393
Sir, you okay sir?

186
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,313
Sir, move if you're okay, sir!

187
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,470
I think he drowned.

188
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,803
Control.

189
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,840
So.

190
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,140
How'd it go with the crocodile dundee wannabe?

191
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,100
Fine.

192
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,350
Your sister Patty's on the phone, line one.

193
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,420
Hello?

194
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,253
Hi.

195
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:39,800
Have you gotten a present for Dad yet?

196
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,770
Oh, that's right, it's dad's birthday.

197
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,230
I knew you'd forget.

198
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,130
Wanna shop together?

199
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,310
Yeah, at the places you shop

200
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,710
I can't even afford to browse.

201
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,350
Oh, cut the self-sufficient crap.

202
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,330
I'll pay, okay?

203
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,020
I'll even buy lunch.

204
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,853
I could eat.

205
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,150
I have been thinking about him all weekend.

206
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,380
I can't get him out of my mind.

207
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,770
Why am I doing this to myself?

208
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,910
I don't know.

209
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,150
Kind of got me thinking about him

210
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,320
and I didn't even meet him.

211
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,400
It's like a schoolgirl crush.

212
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,410
I mean, I didn't even have crushes

213
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,430
when I was a school girl.

214
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,860
And over what?

215
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,190
Some guy who's probably just looking

216
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,840
for a little action on Halloween.

217
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,858
The way you describe him,

218
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:20,465
he sounds like James Bond played by Mel Gibson.

219
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:23,783
(laughing) He is definitely attractive.

220
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,610
But you know, I'll bet everything is a load of crap.

221
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,740
A pickup line.

222
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,700
Probably parks cars somewhere.

223
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,780
Well, whoever he is,

224
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,650
maybe he can't get you off his mind either.

225
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,483
Meaning what?

226
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:38,520
Meaning that you might hear from him again,

227
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,780
meaning that you better decide how you feel about him

228
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
before that happens.

229
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,563
Well, how can I do that

230
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,193
if I don't even know who he is?

231
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,081
There's a couple of references to his name.

232
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:50,914
You look in this volume,

233
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:52,380
I'll look in the other one.

234
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,930
Oh, hell.

235
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,763
What?

236
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,063
Rescued two English pilots.

237
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,873
Icelandic glacier, extensive bravery, blah, blah, blah,

238
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,240
decorated by the president

239
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,123
and the prime minister of England.

240
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,383
He's a real hero.

241
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:14,420
There's another reference in this one.

242
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,696
No, I don't want to know.

243
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:16,529
I don't want to know.

244
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:19,403
God, I feel like such an idiot. (sighing)

245
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,493
Yeah, right Patty,

246
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:23,390
he's off somewhere thinking about me

247
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,650
as he's having a wild affair with a beautiful girl

248
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,093
in some exotic place.

249
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:32,975
(birds chirping)

250
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:40,236
(kid whooshing)
Uh oh, look out!

251
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:41,069
Incoming!

252
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,583
All right, careful.

253
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,400
Careful with those, all right?

254
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:49,741
Come over here, come on!

255
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,400
They missed you.

256
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:55,200
I was gone a week.

257
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,570
I brought back the F-14s they wanted.

258
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,070
They'd rather have you here.

259
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,393
So would I.

260
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,880
(helicopter whirring)

261
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,270
You won the commandant's award and I get to read it

262
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,040
in the post notice.

263
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,133
Why didn't you tell me, you bum?

264
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,823
A training, it's an award for training.

265
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,510
I miss the action, Bill.

266
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,380
I feel like some old man

267
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,630
who's teaching something he's too dried up

268
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,730
to do himself.

269
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,330
Come on, Dave.

270
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,790
You're still part of the most elite unit in the Air Force.

271
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,060
I mean, Cindy figured that dead heroes

272
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,430
don't make very good dads.

273
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,710
Is that a hard one to understand?

274
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,630
I did everything she wanted me to do

275
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,640
and it's still not enough.

276
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,000
Now she doesn't even want me conducting training exercises

277
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,180
away from the base.

278
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,610
She wants me in a cage!

279
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,443
And that's where I am.

280
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:42,560
I swear, I feel like I got to bust out or die.

281
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,740
You got a life who lives for you, pal.

282
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,573
You got it great!

283
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:49,088
I mean, people never appreciate it when they got it great.

284
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,755
(phone ringing)

285
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:53,770
Hello?

286
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,550
Hello, cowboy.

287
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,383
Dave?

288
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,290
I've been thinking about you.

289
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,590
Where are you?

290
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,780
Oh, I'm sorry, you probably can't tell me that.

291
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,850
Right, sorry.

292
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,740
Well, I didn't expect to hear from you.

293
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,210
I didn't expect it either to be honest with you, but

294
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
I can't stop thinking about you.

295
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,727
Well what are we going to do about that?

296
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,480
We're going to have me come there.

297
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,830
I just have to work it out.

298
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,900
But I will work it out.

299
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,250
It's a two week course underwater demolitions.

300
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,197
I think you'd be able to teach them a thing or two.

301
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:29,880
Well there'd be instructors there from Russia,

302
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,000
China for the first time.

303
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,058
Could be invaluable.

304
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:32,891
All right, well,

305
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:35,440
I've never had reason to question your judgment before.

306
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,090
If it's useful to you, make your arrangements and go.

307
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:41,575
(gentle music)

308
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,613
This feels right.

309
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:19,953
We've been together forever.

310
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:24,782
So you're here.

311
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:26,387
Yeah.

312
00:15:26,387 --> 00:15:27,669
What does that mean?

313
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:28,919
I'm not sure.

314
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,583
It's something we're going to have to find out.

315
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,390
You know, this is my birthday.

316
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,000
Someone's supposed to be cooking for me.

317
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,940
Oh, don't let him kid you.

318
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,760
He'd stab anybody who touched his precious barbecue.

319
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,820
Dave, how do you like your steak?

320
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,370
I'm a vampire sir, I like mine pretty bloody.

321
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,430
A man after my own heart.

322
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,100
So Alyson tells us that you're into some

323
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,090
hush hush government villains.

324
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,260
Dad, grill the steak, not Dave.

325
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,210
Just making conversation, princess.

326
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,400
That's all right.

327
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,080
It's his job, he's a dad.

328
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,913
Yes, sir.

329
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,210
All I can tell you is

330
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,060
I'm proud of what I do.

331
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,893
And if you knew more,

332
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:13,900
you wouldn't think less of me.

333
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,656
Impressive answer.

334
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:16,656
Well-spoken.

335
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,832
(baby crying)

336
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:24,190
Okay honey, what's up with you?

337
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,916
What's up with my little nephew?

338
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,470
He lost his balloon in the tree.

339
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,303
Here you are, Grandma's got another balloon

340
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:30,136
here for you.

341
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:31,291
Oh look here!
Yeah,

342
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,543
I'm afraid he wants his balloon.

343
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:34,341
I'm afraid you're right.

344
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,841
Where you going?

345
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:57,816
(crowd clapping)
Well done!

346
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:01,026
Look at that.

347
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:06,053
He's a little bit crazy, but I like him.

348
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,430
He's not crazy, he's

349
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,103
kind of perfect.

350
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:19,647
(crowd cheering)

351
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:23,397
(speech drowned by clapping)

352
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:27,749
What are you thinking?

353
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:32,473
I was thinking how the past few days,

354
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,870
I've never been happier.

355
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,830
I'm happy, I want to stay happy.

356
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,467
Well, if there's anything I can do to help.

357
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:45,753
You could marry me.

358
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:50,248
(gentle music)

359
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:55,020
Marry me.

360
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:17,460
I love you.

361
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,320
I know it's not supposed to happen this fast.

362
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,153
But it did.

363
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,473
You too, huh?
Mhmm.

364
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,990
Okay, so let's do it.

365
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,130
Let's get married.

366
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,263
I don't know.

367
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:34,273
I don't know who I would be marrying.

368
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,790
A man who vanishes and then reappears,

369
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,943
no questions allowed.

370
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:43,834
I don't think I can handle that.

371
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,350
You won't have to.

372
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,560
My stint is almost over.

373
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,098
I'm going to be a full fledged four-star civilian.

374
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:52,765
When?
Soon, soon.

375
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:55,413
And then what will you do?

376
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,770
Come back here, sit on the porch,

377
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,620
get old with you.

378
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,950
Our parajumper training these major's shaping up.

379
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,550
I'm putting you in full charge.

380
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,130
I want you to analyze the weaknesses

381
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,320
and implement any necessary changes.

382
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,740
As always, I trust your judgment.

383
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,970
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

384
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,420
My life, my career.

385
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,930
I'm not sure this is what I'm meant to be doing.

386
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,320
For god's sake, Dave, you're the best there is!

387
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,770
That's reason enough to keep doing it.

388
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,310
I don't want to hear this kind of crap from you again.

389
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,143
No, sir.

390
00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:40,251
(cartoon booming and clapping)

391
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:42,663
Oh Popeye, I'm scared.

392
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:45,123
Ain't nothing to be scared about.

393
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:49,490
(gentle music)

394
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,277
Olive, get back from under the table!

395
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:54,788
I'm still scared!

396
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:56,793
Attention, attention everybody,

397
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:58,876
the virus strikes again!

398
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,377
You need something from the fridge?

399
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:09,210
Nah.

400
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,918
The boys are wanting a dog.

401
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:16,868
I said I'd ask you.

402
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,740
Okay, sure.

403
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,573
Good.

404
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,247
Go, tell 'em.

405
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:26,922
They'll love hearing it from you.

406
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:36,244
(gentle music)

407
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:37,713
Going for my ride.

408
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,510
Turn on the sprinklers.

409
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,343
Sure.

410
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,563
(crickets chirping)

411
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:21,324
(suspenseful music)

412
00:22:58,384 --> 00:23:01,051
(bike clanging)

413
00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:18,893
(tense music)

414
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:38,926
(water splashing)

415
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:45,122
(suspenseful music)

416
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:46,256
(phone ringing)

417
00:24:46,256 --> 00:24:47,089
Yes?

418
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:59,140
We're going to go over here.

419
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
Current's moving pretty swift.

420
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,358
Let's get some boats in now.

421
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:02,191
Dispatch to unit three,

422
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:04,785
dispatch to unit three, what's your 20?

423
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:05,789
This is three,

424
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:07,397
we're just pulling up on the scene now.

425
00:25:07,397 --> 00:25:09,275
Dispatch due to fire rescue,

426
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,490
we're gonna need some more units out here.

427
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,090
Okay Paul, let's dig in.

428
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:16,720
Rescue One, this is ground.

429
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Have you got any vision at all up there?

430
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,060
Got nothing at all, Sarge.

431
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,290
I'll hover down to 300 feet,

432
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,480
gonna slide on downstream,

433
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,167
see if I can get any more visual.

434
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,059
It's pretty murky.

435
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,840
Okay if you brake down a little bit lower

436
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,770
and just take a little slower.

437
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,789
Look, we got to find this guy.

438
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:33,849
10-4.

439
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:35,665
Yeah, we're sure it's nothing else.

440
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:38,155
Let's just wait till we hear something.

441
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:39,738
Okay, okay, okay.

442
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:47,016
Come on, come on, dig in, boys, let's go.

443
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,853
(Cindy sobbing)

444
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,549
Okay, okay.

445
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:03,382
Okay.

446
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,755
(thunder rumbling)

447
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:15,672
(pebbles clanking)

448
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:23,781
(gentle music)

449
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:45,738
Mission complete.

450
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,809
(gentle music)

451
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:20,371
Where's your stuff?

452
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,940
I just showed you my stuff.

453
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,900
Stop it, you know what I mean.

454
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,650
Well, I can't get my gear or my pay till I'm debriefed.

455
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,420
They owe me a huge chunk of back pay

456
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,670
and all my severance, but

457
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,070
I want to see you, so I came here first.

458
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,520
So you're going away again?

459
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,690
No, not till I feel like it.

460
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,600
I told you my stint is over, I can do what I want.

461
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,450
They'll debrief me at my convenience.

462
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,990
So you've got no job,

463
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,542
no money, no home,

464
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,610
and no clothes?

465
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,017
Yeah, yeah, that's about the size of it.

466
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:01,663
And you did this for me?

467
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:03,870
I did it for us.

468
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,700
Well, that's what I meant.

469
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,533
Oh boy.

470
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,180
I thought you wanted me if I didn't have to disappear,

471
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,580
if you could know where I am.

472
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,430
I did, I do.

473
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,860
I do.

474
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,693
Okay then.

475
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,253
No regrets?

476
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,563
No regrets.

477
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,500
Alyson, you have got a slew of phone calls to return

478
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,290
and there are clients coming in.

479
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,700
Listen, Tad, anything you can handle,

480
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,860
just handle without me and reschedule everything else.

481
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,760
For this afternoon?

482
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,410
No, I'm not going to come in today.

483
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,420
It's pretty crazy in here, Alyson.

484
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,410
Can't you at least come in?

485
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,110
No, I can't, got it?

486
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,253
Got it.
Okay.

487
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,633
I like that.

488
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,410
That's nice, you'll finally be able

489
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,913
to settle down in one place.

490
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,712
So what are your plans now that you're out of the service?

491
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:00,836
I don't know.

492
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:02,340
It's been a while since I've been out there

493
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,240
in the real world.

494
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,743
Well, as I see it,

495
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,730
real estate's on the upswing.

496
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,020
There's good money to be made, buying old houses,

497
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,033
fixing them up and reselling them.

498
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,440
Mama and I renovated a couple of fixer uppers

499
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,310
during the last boom.

500
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,090
We started out just for fun, but

501
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,800
ended up with a tidy profit.

502
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,130
If the idea appeals to you,

503
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,290
you might be able to ride this market while it's strong.

504
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,860
A thing like that, you need to spend money to make money.

505
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,710
I gotta wait for my funds to come in.

506
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,083
Look, Dave.

507
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,820
I got a pretty strong line of credit at the bank.

508
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,420
I could loan you enough to make a real start.

509
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,230
A hundred thousand, say?

510
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,040
You can repay me with your profits or your back pay,

511
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,383
whichever comes in first.

512
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:58,070
That's incredibly generous, sir.

513
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,740
I love my daughter.

514
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,853
My daughter loves you.

515
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,510
As long as that remains the case,

516
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,210
I want to do right by both of you.

517
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,993
Looks like he went along with daddy's proposal.

518
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,113
He's given up everything for me.

519
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,853
I don't know,

520
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,223
I feel really weird about this.

521
00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:28,278
Honey.

522
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:30,420
That's a kind of romance most girls dream about.

523
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,273
Mom, I'm not most girls.

524
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,038
Alyson, are you marrying Dave

525
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:36,250
because you think you got yourself into something

526
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,330
you can't get out of?

527
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,620
No.

528
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,653
I love Dave.

529
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,200
I love what I know about him.

530
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,230
I mean, it's not like I know that much about him.

531
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,230
Daddy and I have been married for 41 years.

532
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,910
We're still learning about each other.

533
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,020
Imagine how dull it would be

534
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,263
if you knew everything there was to know.

535
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:55,700
When I become a mother, am I going to say stuff like that?

536
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,643
Yes.

537
00:30:56,643 --> 00:30:59,071
(both chuckling)

538
00:30:59,071 --> 00:31:00,400
I've been thinking about something.

539
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,410
It occurred to me that the unit that I was in,

540
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,243
I mean, you know,

541
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:05,370
we were involved with some

542
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,900
anti-terrorist operations.

543
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,470
We had dealings with drug lords,

544
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,390
people who tend to hold a grudge.

545
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,710
Meaning what?

546
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,550
That our lives are in danger?

547
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,383
No, no.
What?

548
00:31:17,383 --> 00:31:18,340
It's not going to be any ninjas

549
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,970
busting in here in the next five minutes

550
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,197
but I do think that

551
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,790
obscurity is not a bad idea right now.

552
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,870
That's why I want to start using my real last name.

553
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,480
My parents' name, Haywood.

554
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,683
Haywood?
Yeah.

555
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,450
Dave Haywood.

556
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,123
Dave and Alyson Haywood.

557
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,220
Can you explain that to your family?

558
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,870
So, you know, we're all on the same page.

559
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,820
Oh, yeah.

560
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,343
We're good at keeping secrets.

561
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,410
My father had the whole family swear

562
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,903
never to reveal I campaigned for Dukakis.

563
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:54,980
(somber music)

564
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:11,100
The union of man and woman and heart, body and mind

565
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,723
is intended for their mutual comfort and help,

566
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,630
that they may know each other with delight

567
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,753
and tenderness in acts of love.

568
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,160
In marriage, husband and wife give themselves to each other

569
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,983
to care for each other in good times and in bad.

570
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,580
They're linked to each other's families

571
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,890
and they begin to do life together in the community.

572
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,420
I David take you Alison to be my wife

573
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,830
to have and to hold from this day forward,

574
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,551
for better, for worse.

575
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:46,692
I David, take you Alyson to be my wife,

576
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:50,024
to have and to hold from this day forward

577
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:51,790
for better or worse.

578
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,720
For richer, for poorer,

579
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,624
in sickness and in health.

580
00:32:55,624 --> 00:32:59,680
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.

581
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,080
This flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation.

582
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,950
I Alyson take you David to be my husband,

583
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,460
to have and to hold from this day forward.

584
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,740
And as a token of our appreciation for the honorable

585
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,440
and faithful services rendered by your loved one.

586
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,070
Alyson, I give you this ring as a symbol of my vow

587
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,260
with all that I am and all that I have.

588
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,487
I honor you in the name of God.

589
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:32,279
Honor guard, atten-hut!

590
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:35,652
Park arms!

591
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:40,457
Ready!

592
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:42,522
Aim!

593
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:46,301
Fire!
(guns firing)

594
00:33:46,301 --> 00:33:47,359
Ready!

595
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,364
Fire!
(guns firing)

596
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,484
Ready!

597
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:53,099
Fire!
(guns firing)

598
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,266
You may kiss your bride.

599
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,260
Dave?

600
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,489
I've got some stuff to photocopy

601
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,840
and then you can show me that house, okay?

602
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,672
Okay.

603
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,003
What do you think?

604
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:40,179
As long as nobody huffs and puffs.

605
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,293
We could rip these up, just put a new floor.

606
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,120
And we're gonna need some new cupboards in here.

607
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,219
Needs a new kitchen.

608
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:50,995
The price is right.

609
00:34:50,995 --> 00:34:52,360
I mean, at least it sounds right,

610
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,659
but this is all new to me.

611
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,820
You're awfully anxious to get cracking

612
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,770
on this renovation thing,

613
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,830
aren't you?
Yeah, yeah.

614
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,083
For you, for us, for your dad.

615
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,400
But you know more about this than I do, so,

616
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,840
I'm going to need your help.

617
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,573
That's for sure. (laughing)

618
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,002
Well, you're right, it is well-priced.

619
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:13,073
All right!

620
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,800
Yo, Al, if you could take one more week off,

621
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,820
we'll be done here.

622
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,010
I can't, Dave.

623
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,560
I feel guilty enough already.

624
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,000
Hi.
Yeah?

625
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,613
Is this house on the market?

626
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,243
Well, eventually.

627
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:28,090
You want to take a look?

628
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

629
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,840
Thanks.

630
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,890
Honey, what do you think?

631
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,311
Well, it's not finished yet.

632
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:35,180
Yeah it's not, it's not finished.

633
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,744
Well we're just looking for a starter.

634
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:39,330
I mean we've really had our heart set on this neighborhood,

635
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,180
but looking around and...

636
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,623
Can we make an offer?

637
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,690
You know, we've gotten a lot of offers lately

638
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,550
and we decided that we wanted to finish and get top dollar.

639
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,823
If you call us tonight,

640
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:54,010
maybe we could make a deal.

641
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,120
Yeah.

642
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,547
Yeah, we'll give you a call.

643
00:35:56,547 --> 00:35:57,380
Great.

644
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,352
Great.
Yeah.

645
00:35:58,352 --> 00:35:59,185
We'll talk.
Good.

646
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:00,440
Okay.
Okay.

647
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,393
Bye-bye.
Bye.

648
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,293
That was easy.

649
00:36:07,293 --> 00:36:08,823
Very, very slick.

650
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,363
You're good.

651
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:13,360
No, no, no, no, we're good.

652
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,193
Heads up.

653
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,760
You realize what we could do if we did this right?

654
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,314
I mean really did it all the way, we can make a killing.

655
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:22,814
You pay your dad back tenfold,

656
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:26,346
we could have it all, cowboy, everything you ever want.

657
00:36:26,346 --> 00:36:29,263
(bottles clinking)

658
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,560
Guys, you'll be fine.

659
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,460
You're making a big mistake, Alyson.

660
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:37,970
She'll really be missed.
Good luck, Alyson.

661
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,803
Bye bye.

662
00:36:38,803 --> 00:36:41,170
Alyson, you put five years in this place.

663
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,270
This place is you.

664
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,473
I'm going to miss you.

665
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,082
Bye, guys.

666
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,530
Bye.
Good luck.

667
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,780
We'll miss you.
Bye.

668
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,120
You look like you know what you're doing.

669
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,400
I've done it before.

670
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,703
Oh yeah, where?

671
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,290
Some covert military lawn care system?

672
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,200
Yeah.

673
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,750
Traded sprinklers for hostages.

674
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,830
So whose car is that?

675
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,663
Ours.

676
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,130
We made a nice chunk of change on that house.

677
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,303
Dave, we're supposed to be paying dad back.

678
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:22,500
I've been paying him.

679
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,320
He's not expecting the whole thing back overnight.

680
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,380
I know, but we should be saving.

681
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,290
That's one thing.
Al, Al,

682
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,240
we're not retired.

683
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,073
We're just starting, okay?

684
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:30,437
Let's enjoy ourselves along the way.

685
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:34,598
We should be saving for our kid.

686
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:35,765
What?

687
00:37:35,765 --> 00:37:36,598
What?

688
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,663
I'm pregnant.

689
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:46,354
(both laughing)
(light music)

690
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:54,920
I love this house, Travis

691
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,753
Yeah.

692
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:57,240
Too bad we're selling instead of buying.

693
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,073
I don't get it.

694
00:37:58,073 --> 00:37:59,640
We're doing beautiful work, busting our butts.

695
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,310
We're listing at a loss, practically.

696
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,760
David, the market is down.

697
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,570
When you spend so much on renovation,

698
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,133
you face the law of diminishing returns.

699
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,570
Yeah, yeah.

700
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,421
I've been hearing about that.

701
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:16,490
Well, the bank's gonna own this in a few days,

702
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,840
I just hope they appreciate good craftsmanship.

703
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,000
Well, open house is over.

704
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,120
I gotta get going.
Okay, all right.

705
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,953
See you.

706
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:25,786
Bye.

707
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:27,040
See you, Alyson.

708
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,883
Bye, Travis.

709
00:38:27,883 --> 00:38:28,833
Bye, Christopher.

710
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,690
We sold five houses in nine months.

711
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,523
It's not like

712
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,913
we tanked here, okay?
I know, I know.

713
00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:42,606
What is it?
Open it.

714
00:38:42,606 --> 00:38:43,523
Open it and see.

715
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,005
I'll trade you.

716
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:47,111
Come here.
Dave.

717
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:49,163
Come here, come here big boy, come on.

718
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:54,120
You like it?

719
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,010
It's beautiful, but why?

720
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,790
It's a Millard Fillmore's birthday today.

721
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,820
We just celebrated Grover Cleveland's birthday.

722
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,653
So what?

723
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:03,547
You got to stop buying me stuff.

724
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:04,750
I can't help it!

725
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,420
We are juggling three mortgages.

726
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,960
We have to be careful with our money.

727
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,793
Relax, okay?

728
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:10,560
I mean once you resolve whatever you have to

729
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,220
with the government, you get your back pay,

730
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,650
then we can relax.
You're gonna put that on?

731
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,483
Huh?

732
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,153
Go ahead.

733
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:17,986
Okay.

734
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,120
See?

735
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,230
It looks great.
It's beautiful.

736
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,730
Don't sweat the small stuff.

737
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,600
He's not worried.

738
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,653
He's so quiet.

739
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,197
Marcus was really cranky at this age.

740
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:36,250
Oh, he's plenty cranky.

741
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,053
He just has good party manners like his dad.

742
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,573
What does that mean?

743
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,430
It means what it means.

744
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,050
All right, Alison, what's wrong?

745
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,883
Nothing.

746
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:47,830
Something's wrong.

747
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,830
Come on.
Nothing is wrong.

748
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,880
What is it, Alyson?

749
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,650
It's not a big deal, it's just, I...

750
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,080
I think we're a little in over our heads financially and

751
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,500
with the baby and all I let Dave take over the books.

752
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,220
You know I don't like doing that kind of stuff anyway.

753
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,480
Look, this is not exactly new, sweetie.

754
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,110
Look, I know you've barely been scraping by.

755
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,360
Dave explained it to Dad.

756
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,410
Dad's been very good about it,

757
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,740
hasn't pressured him about the loan.

758
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,830
The loan?

759
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,030
Look, we know he'll pay it back when he can.

760
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,770
We're just happy that he's so good to you,

761
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,403
and we all like him so much.

762
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,060
Dave shoots a 71.

763
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,490
Dirty bum, we're playing five bucks a hole.

764
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,550
Patty, give me a couple, please.

765
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,110
Mom, do you mind taking care of Christopher tonight?

766
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:33,943
Jerry.

767
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:40,440
I didn't tell you because

768
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,100
I didn't want you to know how badly

769
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,180
I messed up our finances.

770
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,030
You didn't not tell me, you lied.

771
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,840
You said you'd been paying dad back

772
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,713
and you lied to me.
I was afraid

773
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,120
that you would lose respect for me.

774
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,830
Oh, well you were right about that.

775
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,730
Knock it off!

776
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,053
Stop it!

777
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:56,970
(tires screeching)

778
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,870
I'm trying to make you happy.

779
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,703
What more do you want?

780
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:04,073
I gave up everything for you!

781
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:06,643
I didn't ask you to give up anything for me!

782
00:41:10,543 --> 00:41:12,393
You know, if you're having regrets...

783
00:41:14,995 --> 00:41:16,195
I don't know what to do.

784
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,323
No regrets.

785
00:41:23,844 --> 00:41:24,677
Remember.

786
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,510
I'm not sure how you're going to take this, but

787
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,823
I got word I can collect my back pay and severance.

788
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,783
Well, why would I have a problem with that?

789
00:41:37,783 --> 00:41:39,730
Because it means going for that debriefing

790
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,563
I never went for.

791
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:41,396
Where would you go?

792
00:41:41,396 --> 00:41:42,229
I can't tell you that.

793
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,260
The good news is it'll get us out of this bind.

794
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,063
You're not volunteering for something,

795
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,730
something dangerous.
No.

796
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,033
No, that's the old days.

797
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,433
But I would do anything for you, you know that?

798
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,050
Anything to make you happy.

799
00:42:08,353 --> 00:42:12,020
(lightly suspenseful music)

800
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:49,056
(leaves rustling)

801
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:53,362
(water splashing)

802
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:56,379
Oh, Dave.

803
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,429
(woman gasping)

804
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:05,486
Listen up!

805
00:44:05,486 --> 00:44:07,903
Everybody down and stay calm!

806
00:44:10,434 --> 00:44:12,230
Down, on the ground!

807
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,063
Oh, oh my god, okay.

808
00:44:16,703 --> 00:44:18,125
Go!

809
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,958
(dogs whimpering)

810
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:30,992
(dogs barking in distance)

811
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:45,812
Yeah, yeah!

812
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:48,492
Good girl!

813
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:53,385
(suspenseful music)

814
00:44:56,873 --> 00:44:58,470
Oh.

815
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,367
We lost him.

816
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:29,572
(guns firing on TV)

817
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,746
What are you doing here?

818
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:36,960
You call the machine?

819
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,270
No.

820
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,670
You stop by the apartment?

821
00:45:40,913 --> 00:45:41,746
Uh-uh.

822
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,800
Well, if you did, you'd know what I'm doing here.

823
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,450
What are you doing here?

824
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,920
I just kind of blew it in.

825
00:45:52,944 --> 00:45:54,850
Wanted to take a shower, change,

826
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:55,750
look nice for you.

827
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:57,963
Kind of stinky.

828
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:00,743
Hmm, can't argue with that one.

829
00:46:02,223 --> 00:46:03,280
What?

830
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,290
Well, I decided,

831
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,010
well, I thought that we'd move in here,

832
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,133
save on rent while we're renovating.

833
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,500
Just brought the essentials.

834
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,710
Everything else is divided

835
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,580
between Mom and Dad's and Patty's.

836
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,793
So you've been busy.

837
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:16,626
Mhmm.

838
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:19,652
So have I.

839
00:46:24,445 --> 00:46:25,620
Oh my!

840
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,453
That's only part of it.

841
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,153
The bastards only gave me a fraction.

842
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:29,420
Dave!

843
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,743
Come on, give me a hand.

844
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,200
It's wet.

845
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,570
Yeah, tell me about it.

846
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,300
Not only do they short me on the amount,

847
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,930
but when they give me directions where to find it,

848
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,342
I had to take a little swim.

849
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:41,760
What do you mean find it?

850
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,610
How come they didn't give you a check?

851
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,443
A check?

852
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,130
A check?
Yeah.

853
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,310
Checks can be traced,

854
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,530
bank accounts scrutinized.

855
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,210
This is part of a government that doesn't officially exist.

856
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,570
They give me directions and I follow coordinates.

857
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:55,963
And what do you know?

858
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:59,270
It's at the middle of a lake, 20 feet deep.

859
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,850
They send me a little message.

860
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,030
You know, you want to get out the outfit, Dave,

861
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:03,863
you want to get paid?

862
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,340
Well dive for it, screw ball.

863
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,190
Let's see how good you are, you know?

864
00:47:08,653 --> 00:47:10,380
I'm good enough.

865
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,100
These are the guys that work for our government?

866
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,933
I'm not going to miss them.

867
00:47:13,933 --> 00:47:16,037
At all?

868
00:47:16,037 --> 00:47:16,987
Not a bit.

869
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,070
It feels so unreal.

870
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,520
There's over $40,000 here.

871
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,920
Is that real enough for you?

872
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:28,860
We're going to pay back dad first, right?

873
00:47:47,888 --> 00:47:49,691
Wait, wait.

874
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:51,524
Who are you calling?

875
00:47:59,052 --> 00:48:00,635
What are you doing?

876
00:48:05,737 --> 00:48:10,737
You look good in green. (laughing)

877
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,102
Okay folks, straight down there,

878
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:22,935
walk down left.

879
00:48:22,935 --> 00:48:25,270
I should never have agreed to come here.

880
00:48:28,477 --> 00:48:29,530
I was figuring, you know,

881
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,610
some fast food and a few bucks down a slot machine.

882
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,520
Why bother coming?

883
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,610
Look, most of it went towards paying off your dad

884
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:36,850
and our creditors.

885
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:37,720
We got a right to splurge

886
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,820
with the little we got left.

887
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,220
I risked my neck for every dollar of this money.

888
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,780
I'm sorry, you're right.

889
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,613
You're right.

890
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,140
Nice, huh?

891
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:56,560
I'll tell you what, why don't you sit back,

892
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,792
relax and enjoy this

893
00:48:57,792 --> 00:48:59,330
while I'm going to hit up to the room,

894
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,250
make a couple of business calls.

895
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,083
I got a couple of leads,

896
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:01,916
but I don't want to lose them

897
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:03,640
just cause we're on vacation.

898
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,060
Okay, don't be too long now though.

899
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,440
I might get really drunk

900
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,733
and start taking off all my clothes.

901
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,456
Oh, I'll be back in time for that.

902
00:49:13,456 --> 00:49:16,373
(Alyson chuckling)

903
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:45,895
(crowd chattering)

904
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:51,334
(lightly tense music)

905
00:49:58,323 --> 00:50:01,240
(crowd chattering)

906
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:16,002
(dice clattering)

907
00:50:16,002 --> 00:50:17,419
Red, 14 red 14.

908
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:21,444
Place your bets.

909
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:25,586
(wheel clicking)

910
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:49,925
Cash it in.

911
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:10,854
(glass shattering)

912
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:13,205
Ah.

913
00:51:17,063 --> 00:51:20,313
It's okay, I'm going to my room anyway.

914
00:51:26,662 --> 00:51:29,745
(dealers chattering)

915
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,123
A secret gambling habit, huh?

916
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,903
What next?

917
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,730
That money was supposed to go towards

918
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,650
paying back dad.
It will.

919
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,340
I couldn't do it then, I couldn't tell you.

920
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,350
What couldn't you tell me?

921
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,590
What lie could-
Listen to me!

922
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,710
You know the world I came from, it's not a game.

923
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:37,543
What I don't tell you,

924
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:39,820
I don't tell you because it's dangerous.

925
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,620
They paid me with dirty money, okay?

926
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,920
That's how covert operations are financed.

927
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,960
Confiscated drug money pays for a lot of things

928
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,900
our government has to do.

929
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,060
I'm turning around this money

930
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,780
so there is no risk of your father being tainted in any way.

931
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,660
Now we can stand here and argue about it,

932
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,493
or you can help me.

933
00:52:54,493 --> 00:52:55,730
It really doesn't matter.

934
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:59,076
But I gotta keep doing this until I'm done.

935
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:01,909
(trunk slamming)

936
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,490
Let's get a drink first.

937
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,320
I don't want a drink.
Come on.

938
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:19,937
Ah, thank you.

939
00:53:19,937 --> 00:53:21,180
I think you'd want to keep a clear head

940
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,280
for what you're doing.

941
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,390
You know what, you're right.

942
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,585
Soon as I'm done here we're going home.

943
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:28,418
Come on.

944
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,083
Damn.

945
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:51,017
(tense music)

946
00:53:54,141 --> 00:53:55,373
Al?

947
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:56,980
I'm back, I got the face plates.

948
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,813
Great.

949
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,713
What do you think, you'd buy that?

950
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:10,840
Nice.

951
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,773
Yeah, it'll work.

952
00:54:46,899 --> 00:54:48,066
You know what?

953
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:49,918
These are too white.

954
00:54:49,918 --> 00:54:50,751
Should have got off white.

955
00:54:50,751 --> 00:54:52,406
Got to go back to the store.

956
00:54:52,406 --> 00:54:53,356
Do you want me to come along?

957
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:56,356
No, no, I won't screw it up twice.

958
00:54:59,707 --> 00:55:02,707
(suspenseful music)

959
00:55:28,023 --> 00:55:29,586
That's my boy.

960
00:55:29,586 --> 00:55:30,919
Such a good boy.

961
00:56:34,623 --> 00:56:36,183
Yeah, I got word today.

962
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,000
I can get another chunk of my back pay,

963
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
maybe all of it, but

964
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,676
it means taking part in a mission.

965
00:56:43,676 --> 00:56:44,556
What kind of mission?

966
00:56:44,556 --> 00:56:45,980
Well, it's not exactly what I call dangerous,

967
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,560
but it just, it might take a while, that's all.

968
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,990
How long?

969
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:50,823
Two weeks.

970
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,373
Maybe three.

971
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,390
Do you want your dad paid back in full,

972
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:58,950
us out of debt, free and clear,

973
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:59,783
our lives back together?
Yes.

974
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,010
Yes.
Okay then.

975
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:01,913
Dave, look.

976
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,930
Whatever it is you're doing,

977
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,124
I know you're doing for me, but...

978
00:57:06,124 --> 00:57:06,957
What?

979
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:09,957
Well, you got to know that you're what matters to me, you.

980
00:57:12,525 --> 00:57:13,410
I don't want anything to happen to you.

981
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,430
What I'm doing, I'm doing for us.

982
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,263
Remember that.

983
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,933
Trust it.

984
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:25,176
(door knocking)

985
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,290
Hello.

986
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,123
Patty.

987
00:57:33,123 --> 00:57:34,810
I was shopping for myself.

988
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:36,130
What's one extra bag?

989
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,363
It's not like I'm homeless or anything.

990
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,610
Yeah, but I bet you don't have anything

991
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,860
worth eating around here.

992
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,820
so I got you that lemon chicken

993
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,170
that you liked so much that time you were over.

994
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,770
Well, gee, the place is looking real good.

995
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,070
Real good.

996
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,910
All right, Patty, I know you're dying to ask.

997
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,930
No, I haven't heard from Dave yet.

998
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,600
And I'm, oh,

999
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,120
I'm really beginning to freak out about this.

1000
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,953
Why?

1001
00:58:01,953 --> 00:58:03,151
Well, I do.

1002
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:06,100
I think he might be involved in something

1003
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,233
really bad.
Really what?

1004
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:13,300
Rogue CIA, Oliver North kind of thing.

1005
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:14,403
Well, he might be.

1006
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,040
He might be just more than you think.

1007
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,963
What are you saying?

1008
00:58:21,963 --> 00:58:23,120
Nothing, nothing.

1009
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:23,953
Patty.

1010
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,090
Jerry made me promise not to tell you.

1011
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,190
So don't tell him I told you.

1012
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,293
Tell me.

1013
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,980
Dave borrowed $20,000 from Jerry

1014
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,800
several months ago

1015
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,670
and he hasn't paid back at dime.

1016
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,770
Why didn't you tell me this?

1017
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,160
Anyway, you know,

1018
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,163
Jerry's sorta considered it a write off at this point.

1019
00:58:50,124 --> 00:58:51,575
Oh, no.

1020
00:58:51,575 --> 00:58:52,694
Take it.

1021
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:54,495
Go in the back, in the back!

1022
00:58:54,495 --> 00:58:57,669
Clear out, let's go, hurry up.

1023
00:58:57,669 --> 00:58:58,502
Move it!

1024
00:59:00,402 --> 00:59:01,819
I said head down!

1025
00:59:03,024 --> 00:59:04,158
Let's go.

1026
00:59:04,158 --> 00:59:05,494
It's all in there.

1027
00:59:05,494 --> 00:59:06,327
Come on.

1028
00:59:08,914 --> 00:59:11,557
Big bills, nothing under 20.

1029
00:59:11,557 --> 00:59:12,390
Hurry up.

1030
00:59:14,023 --> 00:59:15,453
Hurry up!

1031
00:59:15,453 --> 00:59:16,953
Move it, let's go!

1032
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:19,777
I said heads down!

1033
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,144
Okay, that's it.

1034
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:23,332
That's it, all right, bring it to me, come on.

1035
00:59:23,332 --> 00:59:24,249
Right here.

1036
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,353
No please.

1037
00:59:28,353 --> 00:59:29,186
Please, no, no!
On the ground.

1038
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:30,184
Shut up, don't talk!

1039
00:59:30,184 --> 00:59:31,935
You, you, let's go, come on.

1040
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:32,908
Get up, follow me in the back.

1041
00:59:32,908 --> 00:59:33,908
You see her?

1042
00:59:35,225 --> 00:59:36,142
Open it up.

1043
00:59:37,727 --> 00:59:38,560
Come on!

1044
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,550
I'd like to get a safety deposit box.

1045
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,190
Are you a customer?

1046
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,660
No, do I have to be?

1047
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,550
No, just fill out this form.

1048
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,383
Thank you.

1049
01:00:03,409 --> 01:00:05,326
Taxi over here.

1050
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,349
Thank you.

1051
01:00:58,997 --> 01:01:02,400
(phone beeping)

1052
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,711
(phone ringing)

1053
01:01:04,711 --> 01:01:05,640
Hello?

1054
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,483
Hey, it's me.

1055
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,130
I need your help with something.

1056
01:01:11,326 --> 01:01:14,409
(chill lounge music)

1057
01:01:19,921 --> 01:01:22,671
Would it bother you if I smoke?

1058
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:26,523
Well if it did, I shouldn't be in a bar.

1059
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:34,663
Here, I got it.

1060
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:46,883
Thanks.

1061
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,430
They booked me into a non smoking room

1062
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:50,940
then told me I couldn't smoke in the lobby

1063
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,043
and so here I am.

1064
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,583
What about you?

1065
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,793
What about me what?

1066
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,103
Alone in a hotel bar.

1067
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,270
They booked me into a non drinking room?

1068
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:03,563
I don't know.

1069
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,680
Well, are you here on business?

1070
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,800
No, I'm just passing through.

1071
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,633
What about you?

1072
01:02:08,633 --> 01:02:10,050
I'm a sales rep for clothing line.

1073
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,237
It involves a lot of travel.

1074
01:02:11,237 --> 01:02:12,070
Yeah, you like it?

1075
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,230
Yeah, it's an adventure.

1076
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,610
When you're divorced with no kids,

1077
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:17,831
adventure's a pretty good trade off.

1078
01:02:17,831 --> 01:02:19,040
Yeah.

1079
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,274
Yeah, I feel that way.

1080
01:02:20,274 --> 01:02:22,000
I have to feel that way for what I do.

1081
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,630
Which is?

1082
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:24,993
I work for the government.

1083
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,253
What I do is

1084
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:32,140
secret and dangerous, but I love it.

1085
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,773
I love the action, love the pay.

1086
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:37,250
Sometimes it's lonely, but like you said,

1087
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,083
it's a tradeoff.

1088
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,813
I have a fully stocked minibar in my room.

1089
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,230
I could give up smoking for the rest of the night.

1090
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,060
I was feeding you a line.

1091
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:55,893
I'm a jerk.

1092
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,100
A married jerk who fixes old houses

1093
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,433
and loses money doing it.

1094
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,550
Somehow I have a hard time believing that.

1095
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,035
Me too.

1096
01:03:16,063 --> 01:03:17,498
Good night.

1097
01:03:17,498 --> 01:03:18,831
Night.

1098
01:03:29,575 --> 01:03:31,270
I've got to get into my safety deposit box.

1099
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:33,330
Okay, I'll just need your name and your number.

1100
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:36,623
Haywood, 3334.

1101
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,343
And just sign right there.

1102
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,103
Thank you.

1103
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,563
You can look at this in the cubicle out there.

1104
01:04:38,535 --> 01:04:39,368
Oh.
Hi.

1105
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:41,093
Hello.
Hi.

1106
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:44,940
I'd like to rent a box,

1107
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,529
but I'm not sure what size.

1108
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:48,510
All right, well, these are the different sizes

1109
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,187
of boxes that we have.

1110
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,913
So what's the difference in price there?

1111
01:05:06,966 --> 01:05:07,904
Oh, thanks.

1112
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:08,830
Excuse me.

1113
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,430
I seem to have cut my finger

1114
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:11,650
on the stupid box.

1115
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:13,233
Oh, sorry.
Yeah.

1116
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,279
We should figure something out there.

1117
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:17,735
We should wash that.
It's very sharp.

1118
01:05:17,735 --> 01:05:19,080
But you know, let's put your box back first.

1119
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,130
That's a good idea.

1120
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,586
Thanks.

1121
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:40,470
What is your purpose for entering Mexico?

1122
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:41,303
Tourist.

1123
01:06:03,045 --> 01:06:05,270
And for how long?

1124
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:06,770
Till you run out of tequila.

1125
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:13,174
Vamos.

1126
01:06:22,221 --> 01:06:24,990
(door knocking)

1127
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,140
Okay.

1128
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,610
I went to that old locksmith

1129
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:28,443
that mom and dad used to go to

1130
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,800
because I figured that he wouldn't be suspicious.

1131
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,740
Well he was, a little, I think.

1132
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:33,887
Hi.

1133
01:06:33,887 --> 01:06:34,720
But...

1134
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:37,363
I got it.

1135
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:41,440
Now be careful this time.

1136
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,273
I know the routine.

1137
01:06:42,273 --> 01:06:43,529
I'll just be a few minutes.

1138
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:24,547
(lightly tense music)

1139
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,303
Patty, I don't know what's true, what's not true.

1140
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,210
Dave Bay is a name he was born with

1141
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:18,170
in Illinois to parents that,

1142
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,470
well, he always told me were foster parents,

1143
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:22,870
which means he made up half the stuff about his childhood.

1144
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:23,702
So what?

1145
01:08:23,702 --> 01:08:24,550
People do that all the time.

1146
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:25,520
There's more, there's more.

1147
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,042
The woman in the photograph,

1148
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,622
the foster mother turned mother,

1149
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,729
she was supposed to have died when Dave was in high school.

1150
01:08:33,729 --> 01:08:37,130
But in the photograph, he's already in an Air Force uniform,

1151
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,370
which means that she didn't die when he said.

1152
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:40,819
Meaning she still might be alive.

1153
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:41,653
You're getting ahead

1154
01:08:41,653 --> 01:08:42,486
of me here.
No, god,

1155
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:43,318
you're taking too long.

1156
01:08:43,318 --> 01:08:45,380
Cut to the chase!
I'm trying, okay.

1157
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,559
According to his birth certificate,

1158
01:08:47,559 --> 01:08:49,200
he was born in Rockford, Illinois,

1159
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,170
and the picture was taken

1160
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:51,870
in front of Rockford Public Library.

1161
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:55,979
Now, I had remembered that the mother was a librarian

1162
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:59,290
or something, so I gave it a shot and I called the library.

1163
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:01,040
You didn't.
Mhmm.

1164
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,930
Carolyn Bay, beloved librarian for 25 years

1165
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:09,292
is now retired, not deceased and living in Portland.

1166
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,268
Portland?

1167
01:09:12,265 --> 01:09:14,750
So do you think Dave knows?

1168
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,867
Stupid question, of course Dave knows.

1169
01:09:15,867 --> 01:09:17,550
The question is, now that I know,

1170
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:18,393
what am I going to do about it?

1171
01:09:18,393 --> 01:09:20,962
All right, all right, come on, let's go sit down.

1172
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,940
All right. (clears throat)

1173
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:27,250
How does Dave's childhood,

1174
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,270
his relationship with his parents, all that stuff,

1175
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,520
how does that affect you?

1176
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,002
Well it doesn't directly, but-

1177
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:35,725
Then it's none of your business.

1178
01:09:35,725 --> 01:09:37,723
Patty, how can you say that?

1179
01:09:40,059 --> 01:09:41,940
I have accepted Dave

1180
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:45,930
as a man of mystery who can only tell me certain things.

1181
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,680
But I didn't know he was lying about the things

1182
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,540
he was telling me.

1183
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,053
I mean, what else is a lie?

1184
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,410
I can't trust him.

1185
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:54,830
He lied about his childhood, that's it.

1186
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,650
So what?

1187
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,770
It's who he grew up to be that matters.

1188
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:01,020
And he grew up to be

1189
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,857
honored by the President of the United States

1190
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:05,300
and the prime minister of England.

1191
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,683
Come on, sweetie, you saw the pictures.

1192
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,603
(light somber music)

1193
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,673
Oh my god, the key.

1194
01:10:52,506 --> 01:10:53,339
Hey.

1195
01:10:56,612 --> 01:10:59,210
Uh-oh, you look happy.

1196
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,580
I would have called if I could,

1197
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:02,059
but where I was is...

1198
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:05,680
It's over, I'm finished with those guys for good.

1199
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,630
You get your money?

1200
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,490
Oh yeah.

1201
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:09,823
Yeah, some.

1202
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,770
Enough.

1203
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:11,920
Come on, I'll show you.

1204
01:11:13,633 --> 01:11:14,733
At least it's not wet.

1205
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,160
I didn't want to go back to Vegas

1206
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,543
so I made other arrangements.

1207
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,150
Come here, I wanna show you.

1208
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,320
What?

1209
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,970
Close your eyes and hold out your hands.

1210
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:25,803
What now?

1211
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:27,273
Close your eyes and hold out your hands.

1212
01:11:29,075 --> 01:11:31,575
(bag zipping)

1213
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,273
Okay.

1214
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:41,383
Mexican gold pesos for $150 each.

1215
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:44,860
Where did you get this?

1216
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:46,322
From the unit.

1217
01:11:46,322 --> 01:11:48,871
They insisted they pay me in gold and they did.

1218
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:49,960
And where did they get it?

1219
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,930
They're very enterprising.

1220
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,050
Now we can pay your dad back in full, get out of debt,

1221
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:56,050
maybe take a nice little trip somewhere.

1222
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:58,520
What's your dream vacation?

1223
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,960
I don't believe in dreaming.

1224
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,670
What aren't you saying?

1225
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,500
What aren't you saying?

1226
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,170
What are the things you haven't told me, Dave?

1227
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:11,490
I want to know.

1228
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:12,920
I'll tell you.

1229
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,585
I will, when it's safer.

1230
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:15,590
And when will that be?

1231
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,233
And say from what Dave?

1232
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,780
If you're in some kind of trouble, let me help you.

1233
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,770
You can trust me, you know that, you can.

1234
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:24,900
I've been trained not to trust.

1235
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:25,863
Trust equals death.

1236
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,430
It's not easy battling that kind of conditioning,

1237
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,263
but I'll try.

1238
01:12:37,263 --> 01:12:40,113
I want you to trust me so I can trust you.

1239
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:44,016
Look.

1240
01:12:45,283 --> 01:12:46,116
I'm tired.

1241
01:12:47,023 --> 01:12:48,820
I want to take a shower,

1242
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,653
maybe a nap.

1243
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,300
Why don't you think about dinner?

1244
01:13:15,135 --> 01:13:17,635
(tense music)

1245
01:14:43,398 --> 01:14:44,315
Oh, Alyson.

1246
01:14:52,693 --> 01:14:55,130
It's all right, I'll grab something on the road.

1247
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,059
Where you going?

1248
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:57,050
I gotta deal with this.

1249
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:58,113
It might take awhile.

1250
01:14:59,150 --> 01:14:59,983
How long a while?

1251
01:14:59,983 --> 01:15:00,816
A day or two.

1252
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:02,940
I'll keep you posted.

1253
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,490
I love you, cowboy.

1254
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:08,823
Dave, what's happening?

1255
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:10,840
Tell me what's happening.

1256
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,207
I told you.

1257
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:17,363
You told me nothing, always nothing.

1258
01:15:18,741 --> 01:15:20,691
I want to know what you're doing, Dave.

1259
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:23,393
Tell me what you're doing.

1260
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:28,455
I'm going to do what I have to do.

1261
01:15:48,729 --> 01:15:51,312
(car starting)

1262
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,167
(lightly tense music)

1263
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:36,156
(phone beeping)

1264
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,980
What city please?

1265
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:42,010
Portland?

1266
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:45,743
The number for Carolyn Bay, B-A-Y.

1267
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,960
Hold for a moment, please.

1268
01:17:06,344 --> 01:17:09,011
(phone beeping)

1269
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,500
Hello?

1270
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,383
Is this Mrs. Carolyn Bay?

1271
01:17:18,597 --> 01:17:21,180
(gentle music)

1272
01:17:28,867 --> 01:17:31,534
(door knocking)

1273
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:43,663
Mrs. Bay?

1274
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:44,496
Yes.

1275
01:17:44,496 --> 01:17:47,460
Hi, my name is Alison Haywood.

1276
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,790
I'm a friend of your son, Dave.

1277
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,750
He's told me so much about you.

1278
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,000
And he's always said when I'm in Portland,

1279
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,600
that I should look you up, so...

1280
01:17:58,809 --> 01:18:00,240
I'm sorry.

1281
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,590
You are Dave's mom, aren't you?

1282
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,920
My dear, why do you keep talking about Dave

1283
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,233
as if he's alive?

1284
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:09,883
Excuse me?

1285
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,282
Maybe you better come inside.

1286
01:18:16,987 --> 01:18:19,793
As a friend of Dave's, how is it you didn't know?

1287
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,000
Oh.

1288
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,900
Well, I...

1289
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:27,353
We've been a little out of touch.

1290
01:18:27,353 --> 01:18:28,410
Oh, you poor thing,

1291
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:31,110
this must be a terrible shock.

1292
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:33,023
Shock, yes.

1293
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,933
That's when Dave and Cindy met the prime minister.

1294
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:42,320
You know Cindy, she's doing better now.

1295
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,023
They've been through so much, Cindy and the boys.

1296
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:53,370
A wife and children.

1297
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:54,270
You didn't know?

1298
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:58,282
You can't have known Dave very well.

1299
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:02,593
Dave was married before I moved to Portland.

1300
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,330
How could you know where I am,

1301
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:07,740
but not know about his family?

1302
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,373
I'm sorry.

1303
01:19:09,373 --> 01:19:11,050
I'm having a hard time with this.

1304
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:13,040
I know your voice.

1305
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,610
You called yesterday for my address.

1306
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:17,677
Who are you, what do you want?

1307
01:19:17,677 --> 01:19:18,677
I'm sorry.

1308
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:20,443
It's a mistake.

1309
01:19:20,443 --> 01:19:22,070
Just go!
I'm going!

1310
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:38,873
Sometimes when I'm having a bad dream,

1311
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:41,653
I can wake myself up.

1312
01:19:44,568 --> 01:19:46,919
I'll be there in the dream and I'll tell myself

1313
01:19:47,809 --> 01:19:49,410
I don't want to be here anymore.

1314
01:19:50,884 --> 01:19:52,053
And then I wake up.

1315
01:19:55,548 --> 01:20:00,548
(sighing) I can't seem to wake myself up from this one.

1316
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:06,030
Alyson, I think we all have to face the fact

1317
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:08,780
that this nightmare is not over.

1318
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:11,130
The question now is what are we going to do about it?

1319
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:14,309
Well, that's easy, we nail the bastard.

1320
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,520
I said he was crazy that very first day, remember that?

1321
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,670
I said he was crazy.
Mom, you liked him.

1322
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:18,503
We all liked him.

1323
01:20:18,503 --> 01:20:19,893
The whole world likes Dave.

1324
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,733
That's how he can take you and Jerry.

1325
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:29,170
And me.

1326
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,670
So what are you going to do?

1327
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:33,780
Alyson, the guy could be nuts!

1328
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:34,980
Or dangerous.

1329
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:36,500
Oh, that's great, coming from you,

1330
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,910
the one who told me that it was none of my business,

1331
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:39,743
that I should just leave

1332
01:20:39,743 --> 01:20:40,620
it all alone, right?
I was wrong,

1333
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:41,580
okay?

1334
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:42,960
Call the cops, call the military,

1335
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:43,993
call the other wife.

1336
01:20:44,844 --> 01:20:47,412
This creep's got a lot to answer for.

1337
01:20:47,412 --> 01:20:50,470
I think we may see the return of public executions.

1338
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:53,641
Patty, we're talking about that baby's father.

1339
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:54,910
Dad.

1340
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:59,070
We have to think very carefully before we act.

1341
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:01,640
Because once this genie's let out of the bottle,

1342
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,353
there'll be no putting it back.

1343
01:21:06,008 --> 01:21:09,175
(lightly tense music)

1344
01:22:33,276 --> 01:22:35,528
(boys giggling)

1345
01:22:35,528 --> 01:22:36,458
Hey!

1346
01:22:36,458 --> 01:22:39,327
Okay, boys, it's lunch time, come on!

1347
01:22:39,327 --> 01:22:41,112
Come on, come on, come on.

1348
01:22:41,112 --> 01:22:42,987
I got you, come here.

1349
01:22:42,987 --> 01:22:44,692
I don't wanna go in!

1350
01:22:44,692 --> 01:22:46,118
Dry yourself up, okay?

1351
01:22:46,118 --> 01:22:48,035
Now you too, come here.

1352
01:22:57,059 --> 01:22:58,411
You know what, get in there.

1353
01:22:58,411 --> 01:23:00,265
Wipe your feet up before you go in the door.

1354
01:23:00,265 --> 01:23:01,098
Go on.

1355
01:23:11,049 --> 01:23:12,164
(car starting)

1356
01:23:12,164 --> 01:23:13,691
Get this thing, yes!

1357
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:16,023
Left, left, left right left.

1358
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,833
Left, left, left right left.

1359
01:23:23,558 --> 01:23:26,725
(helicopter whirring)

1360
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:46,500
I should've known.

1361
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,390
He was trying to tell me

1362
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,540
a few days before his accident.

1363
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:52,490
He was feeling trapped,

1364
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:53,540
he wanted to get out.

1365
01:23:54,636 --> 01:23:56,036
I didn't take him seriously.

1366
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,760
Maybe I could have helped him.

1367
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:01,963
Dave's a quitter who destroyed lives in the process.

1368
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,710
Let me tell you about this unit.

1369
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,650
We take the finest.

1370
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:09,970
We put them through the hardest training in the military

1371
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:12,559
and we produced 200 of the world's best.

1372
01:24:12,559 --> 01:24:16,670
They can go anywhere, do anything for one purpose,

1373
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:17,940
to save lives.

1374
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:22,700
All I know is he told me he resigned

1375
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,710
and that he was being debriefed and

1376
01:24:25,809 --> 01:24:28,570
that he was getting his back pay you owed him.

1377
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:29,403
Owed him?

1378
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,523
We don't owe our men money.

1379
01:24:36,898 --> 01:24:39,610
I was grooming him to take over.

1380
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:41,210
He had everything going for him.

1381
01:24:42,407 --> 01:24:44,513
I guess he didn't see it that way.

1382
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,720
I can't believe what he put them through.

1383
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,023
His mother, Cindy, the kids.

1384
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,950
I'm on that list somewhere.

1385
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:56,600
Yeah, sorry, of course.

1386
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,433
So.

1387
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:01,563
He's run away again.

1388
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:05,893
Is that it, he's just disappeared?

1389
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:09,130
Before today, I could have told you

1390
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:11,510
with absolute certainty how any one of my men

1391
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:13,559
would have behaved in a given situation,

1392
01:25:13,559 --> 01:25:15,303
but that's all gone to hell now.

1393
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,820
But you were right to come to us with this

1394
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,370
because we're the ones who can deal with it.

1395
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:22,027
We don't leave our men out there.

1396
01:25:22,027 --> 01:25:24,237
And we always clean up our own garbage.

1397
01:25:24,237 --> 01:25:25,178
Wait a minute, what?

1398
01:25:25,178 --> 01:25:26,011
Wait a minute.

1399
01:25:26,011 --> 01:25:27,707
What are you...

1400
01:25:27,707 --> 01:25:28,540
Are you...

1401
01:25:30,237 --> 01:25:32,373
are you talking about taking him out?

1402
01:25:33,559 --> 01:25:35,830
You've been watching too many movies.

1403
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:40,690
No, I want Dave to face charges in front of a court martial.

1404
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:42,340
That's what he would want.

1405
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:44,850
I'd like to be put in charge of this operation, sir.

1406
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:45,683
Done.

1407
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:48,030
I want you to go back to California with Miss...

1408
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:50,450
Haywood.

1409
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:51,923
We go by the name of Haywood.

1410
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,313
Mrs. Haywood, yes.

1411
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:00,330
If Dave does return to California,

1412
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:01,840
you'd better be ready for him.

1413
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,480
Remember, he taught evading capture.

1414
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,263
So you're going to have to rely on sheer force of numbers.

1415
01:26:12,564 --> 01:26:16,231
(lightly suspenseful music)

1416
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:52,443
Hello, cowboy.

1417
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,000
Didn't mean to wake you.

1418
01:26:58,570 --> 01:26:59,870
What are you doing here?

1419
01:27:01,494 --> 01:27:02,327
I live here.

1420
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,370
Hey, Christopher.

1421
01:27:15,422 --> 01:27:17,172
How you doing, buddy?

1422
01:27:18,056 --> 01:27:20,723
(baby babbling)

1423
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:24,210
You miss me?

1424
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:25,043
Sure.

1425
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,220
You looking for this?

1426
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,150
They must be close by,

1427
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:31,600
the signal has a short reach.

1428
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:34,370
Who did they send?

1429
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:35,452
My old friend, Bill?

1430
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:37,702
Bill prefers this model.

1431
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:46,300
You think I'm going to hurt you?

1432
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,513
Oh, you've hurt me already, Dave.

1433
01:27:47,513 --> 01:27:49,470
I loved you, Alyson, still do.

1434
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:50,980
Always will.

1435
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:51,813
Why?

1436
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:54,410
Why did you betray me?

1437
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:55,423
Betray you?

1438
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,360
You have betrayed everyone who has ever loved you.

1439
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,670
What are you talking about?

1440
01:28:00,670 --> 01:28:02,080
Not you.

1441
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:02,913
I've never betrayed you.

1442
01:28:02,913 --> 01:28:05,200
Oh I can't believe that you actually believe that.

1443
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,032
I do.

1444
01:28:06,032 --> 01:28:07,890
Well then you're crazier than I thought.

1445
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:08,723
You could've had it all.

1446
01:28:08,723 --> 01:28:10,300
I just wanted us to be happy.

1447
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,133
Let go of me.

1448
01:28:11,133 --> 01:28:11,966
Just let go!
No, not till you say

1449
01:28:11,966 --> 01:28:12,799
you believe me, please.
Believe?

1450
01:28:12,799 --> 01:28:14,293
What am I supposed to believe, Dave?!

1451
01:28:14,293 --> 01:28:15,126
I love you.

1452
01:28:15,126 --> 01:28:16,373
All of this was because I loved you.

1453
01:28:16,373 --> 01:28:21,373
Loved me? (laughing)

1454
01:28:22,686 --> 01:28:23,769
You loved me?

1455
01:28:28,477 --> 01:28:30,393
What were you thinking?

1456
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:35,369
What was I thinking?
Yeah.

1457
01:28:35,369 --> 01:28:37,286
What were you thinking?

1458
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:46,713
I had to be with you.

1459
01:28:48,402 --> 01:28:52,350
You know, someday you can understand that.

1460
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:55,017
Oh no, I don't think so, Dave.

1461
01:29:10,271 --> 01:29:11,104
No.

1462
01:29:26,971 --> 01:29:28,888
It is Bill, isn't it?

1463
01:29:34,256 --> 01:29:35,520
Good.

1464
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,687
(helicopter whirring)

1465
01:29:41,134 --> 01:29:43,181
Capture One Leader to Capture Ground,

1466
01:29:43,181 --> 01:29:44,248
we are airborne, over.

1467
01:29:44,248 --> 01:29:45,308
Capture One Leader,

1468
01:29:45,308 --> 01:29:46,311
this is Capture Ground,

1469
01:29:46,311 --> 01:29:48,037
could you give me an ETA, sir, over?

1470
01:29:48,037 --> 01:29:50,682
Roger, Capture Ground, ETA is six minutes.

1471
01:29:50,682 --> 01:29:55,140
(speech drowned by helicopter whirring)

1472
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,832
Capture One Leader, this is Capture Three,

1473
01:29:56,832 --> 01:30:00,332
you have a flight of three on the go, sir.

1474
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,523
Tell me one thing.

1475
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:21,463
The money, the wet cash, the pesos.

1476
01:30:23,721 --> 01:30:24,671
Where'd you get it?

1477
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,473
I robbed banks.

1478
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,423
I robbed banks.

1479
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:51,590
Do me a favor.

1480
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:56,220
Tell Chris his dad was a hero once, okay?

1481
01:31:00,966 --> 01:31:03,549
He really was a hero, you know?

1482
01:31:10,023 --> 01:31:12,607
(somber music)

1483
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:53,490
Master Sergeant David James Bay,

1484
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:56,800
this is the United States Air Force Military Police.

1485
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,370
You are ordered to surrender

1486
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:00,853
according to the articles of the uniform code

1487
01:32:00,853 --> 01:32:02,112
of military justice.

1488
01:32:02,112 --> 01:32:05,218
Failure to comply will initiate hostile force

1489
01:32:05,218 --> 01:32:06,468
on your person.

1490
01:32:07,969 --> 01:32:10,552
(somber music)

1491
01:32:25,604 --> 01:32:28,104
(light music)
