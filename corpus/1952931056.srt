when you realize

that something's changed

Gotta try something new

Now my time has arrived

No endless night
can keep me in the dark

- He'll live

Gonna climb
and make the prize all mine

luminescent state is second rate

35

I'll turn it up a notch past nine

36
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,310
And watch the world go blind

Excuse us. There's our little superstar!

Princess, you had better watch out
for law enforcement.

They are gonna come after you
for stealing the show!

55
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,880
Honey, on a scale of one to 10,
you were an entirely different scale.

And you know my aversion to scales.

are a gift as well.

for a new musical on Broadway.

Broadway? As in "Broadway?"

73
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,548
Yeah. And I think
that there is a perfect part.

I would be more than happy
to arrange an audition

if you happen to find yourself
in the Big Apple any time soon.

Amber Lee Adams.

amazing performer ever!

believing everything you think.

Do you really believe you're ready
for such a monumental step?

94
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,935
Daddy, the main reason
I buy such expensive shoes

95
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,937
is to take monumental steps.

96
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,148
Sweetheart, when you graduated
from high school almost a year ago,

97
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,232
do you remember what you said to me?

98
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,152
"How come no one makes
a cap and gown in hot pink?"

99
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,278
No.

100
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,863
"How come you get a car and driver
and I don't?"

101
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,281
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone

102
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,283
"to fill the talent-less void
of boring and unattractive

103

- "once I graduate"?
- No.

105
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,416
Yes, but you also said
that you needed a year to find yourself,

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,376
to figure out what came next in your life.

107
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,128
That year's almost up,
and you haven't found anything.

108
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:42,090
It's a small town. I mean,
there's only so many places to look.

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,385
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.

110
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,887
This is more than just a show.

111
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,431
You're talking about going it alone
in the big city.

112
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,684
Right! To star on Broadway
with Amber Lee Adams.

113
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,187
Could you really deny the world
that opportunity?

114
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,647
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me

115
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,816
convinces me
you're ready for something like this.

116
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,573
Okay, ladies. Team Sharpay.

Mission: New York.

118

Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?

119
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,162
You pout, throw a tantrum,

120
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,289
and he buys you a new Burberry bag
to make you feel better?

121
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,124
That's good, but no.

122
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,794
It means we show him I'm determined.

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,421
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.

Okay, here's your assignments.

127
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,054
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed
Constance, who tweeted Bethany,

128
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,639
who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara,

129
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,308
who has an ex-friend
who she caught with her boyfriend,

130
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,185
who she then dumped,
so now Kara's her friend again,

131
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:39,398
who knows of a New York apartment
available in a luxury townhouse.

132
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,900
That is, like, the best house you can get
in terms of towns.

133
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,694
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.

134
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,321
- It can't.
- But it does.

135
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,491
It is equal distance
from both Chanel and wicked.

You can wear anything.

150
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,158
You should have your own reality show

Where you wear anything.

00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,538
All right. I'm ready to show Daddy
what we've accomplished.

New York is calling.

155
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,423
And this is one call
that is not going to voice-mail.

156
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,511
So, by way of review,
this is my shoe closet,

157
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,679
that is my bedroom,

158
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,599
these are my new clothes
and where I'll wear them,

159
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,602
and then I'm a star! See?

160
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,022
(SIGHING)
I'm just not totally convinced.

161
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,982
Daddy, you said
I haven't shown you anything

162
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,066
to let you know I'm ready for this.

163
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,195
But, look, I took matters
into my own hands,

164
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,280
and without even
chipping my manicure.

165
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,700
Sweetheart, it's not as easy
as putting pictures on boards.

166
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,994
But I've worked everything out!

167
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,455
And used this pointer.

168
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,541
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.

169
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,544
Alone, in New York?

170
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,634
My dear college friend, Michelle,
has a son that goes to NYU.

171
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,469
I've met him. He's a very nice boy.

172
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,555
I could ask her to make sure
that he keeps his eye on you.

173
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,351
Are you sure
you're ready to take this on?

174

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,521
I know it like I know
purple washes me out

176
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,566
and that my eyes are the exact same
distance apart to be a supermodel.

177
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,818
What I don't know
is whether you believe in me.

178
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,073
Mom seems to.

179
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,747
(SIGHING HEAVILY)

180
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,501
Okay, you have my blessing.

181
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,086
(SQUEALING) Thank you, Daddy!

182
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,548
I'll call my friend Michelle
and have her talk to her son.

183
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,550
Thanks, Mom.

184
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,928
There's just one condition.

185
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
Fine. I love a good conditioner.

186
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,390
You have one month.

187
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,642
I'll fly you to New York,
I'll pay for your penthouse,

188
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,435
but you have to
get yourself in that show

189
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,813
and prove to me
you can take care of yourself.

190
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,939
One month.

191
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,899
- Deal?
- So deal!

192
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,443
But if it doesn't work out,
you come back here and work for me.

193
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,988
At the country club.

194
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,781
(STAMMERING)

195
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,199
- Work?
- A job.

196
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,201
That's the deal.

197
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,787
Prove yourself, or come back
in a month and work for me.

198
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,623
Fine. Prove myself it is!

199
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,178
- Look!
- (BOI BARKS)

200
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,931
Look, Boi, look!

201
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,662
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!

202
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,206
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!

203
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,291
We spoke on the phone.

204
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,418
I'm Marjorie Grande,
the manager for the building.

205
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,586
My pleasure.

206
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,254
Please, follow me to the penthouse.

207
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,380
SHARPAY: Ooh!

208
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,441
(SIGHS HAPPILY)

209
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,537
I hope this is to your liking.

210
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,333
No. It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.

211
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,050
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.

212
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,386
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,930
Sure there are. See?

214
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,933
The members of the co-op board
have a strict no-dog policy.

215
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,560
Well...

216
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,647
My father heads
our country club board,

217
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,191
so I'm sure that gives me
some kind of board immunity.

218
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,152
Miss Sharpay, this building
is pleased to have you.

219
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,987
This dog...

220
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,572
Not so pleased.

221
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:45,578
Miss Grande, Ma'am. If he goes, I go.

222
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,888
What are you doing?

223
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,350
PEYTON: Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

224
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,519
Do you always just film
totally stunning people on the street

225
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,104
that you don't know?

226
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,065
Only when I think the subject
is interesting.

227
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,779
And you look baffled and scared
and really pink.

228
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,907
So, yeah, interesting.

229
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,203
Are you paparazzi?

230
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,457
I'm a film student at NYU,
working on a short film.

231
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,919
The assignment is to capture
one unique New York story.

232
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,254
Maybe you're it.

233
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,965
So, you decided to film me
without my permission,

234
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,425
just for a school assignment?

235
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,178
- Yep.
- How dare you!

236
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,054
And my left side is better for close-ups.

237
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,389
(LAUGHS)

238
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,433
I'm Peyton.

Sharpay Evans. Actress, heiress,
soon to be Broadway legend.

240
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,611
- Wait!
- About 105,

241
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,988
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...

242
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,073
I should know my own weight, okay?

243
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:08,244
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.

244
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,998
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment

245
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,000
to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.

246
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,420
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.

247
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,256
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.

248

(BARKS)

249
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,011
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?

250
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,805
Not really.

251
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,600
When I rented this apartment online,
it never said they don't allow dogs.

252
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,020
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!

253
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:39,150
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!

254
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,903
(SIGHING) Actually, the only place
I have to go is home.

255
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,655
And trust me, that is not an option!

256
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,575
Listen, there's an empty studio
in my building, if you're interested.

257
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,203
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.

258
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,413
And...

259
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,833
Well, I'm sure I can make a call
and arrange something.

260
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,376
Maybe get you to see it.

261
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,169
(SIGHS)

262
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,048
Well, since I don't seem to have
any other options.

263
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,552
Bellman!

264
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,227
Oh, yeah, right. (LAUGHS)

265
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,108
Seriously?

266
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,536
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on

267
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,830
until the truck arrives
with the bulk of my things.

268
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,594
(SCREAMING)

269
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,970
Oh! That's good.

270
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,347
Okay, now, go outside,
and then come back in

271
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,684
and give me even more of that
it's-the-end-of-the-world look. Okay?

272
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,023
GIRL 1: Hey, Peyton.
GIRL 2: Hey, Peyton!

273
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,941
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.

277
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,369
Cool, guys. Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.

278
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,331
Hi, Sharpay. Hi, Boi!

279
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,916
Anyways, gotta go. See ya, Peyton.

280
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,501
GIRL 2: Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
PEYTON: Later, guys.

281
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:25,131
Okay. Really, you're going to love
this place. Okay? Up you go.

282
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,347
Sorry. It's a pre-war building.

283
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,725
And during the war,
they didn't fight for an elevator?

284
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,227
Listen, the building has two things
going for it.

285
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,314
It's got something available,
and I live here.

286
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,650
(SCOFFS)

287
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:52,325
(SIGHING) Fine. But if I break a heel,
or a sweat, you're responsible.

288
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,868
Get my bags.

289
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,708
(PANTING)

290
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,755
See? That wasn't so bad.

291
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,716
Yeah. Down the hall.

292
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,260
The one with the police tape
and chalk outline.

293
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,804
Really?

294
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,180
Kidding.

295
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,117
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.

296
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,037
No way! MGM was a studio! This?

297
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,456
This is a roach motel
with no room service.

298
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,666
Yeah, a studio apartment.

299
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,210
Sure, from certain angles,
it's a bit small.

300
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,379
A two-karat engagement ring
is a bit small!

301
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,756
This is a doll house!

302
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,134
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!

303
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,137
I'd need an entirely separate apartment
just for my lipsticks.

304
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,180
And where am I supposed to sleep?

305
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,400
- What is that?
- It's your bed.

306
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,403
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.

307
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,071
You can't be serious!

308
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,658
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.

309
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,877
See? This is my place!
Looking better, huh?

310
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,172
Am I missing something? Oh, right.

311
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,883
Space! Luxury! Maid service!

312
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,260
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.

313
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,180
I'm not used to it. I just expect it.

314
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,640
You know, half this building
is filled with performers

315
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,351
who came here
with the same ambitions you did.

316
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,978
What makes you
so much better than them?

317
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,483
Money, breeding, talent, great hair,
perfect jaw line, chic taste.

318
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,901
How much time do you have?

319
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,111
All right, fine.

320
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,780
I tried to help you out
like my mom asked,

321
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,531
but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.

322
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,202
The only problem is if I call my father

323
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,579
and tell him how I messed up
on the other apartment

324
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,208
and how I have nowhere to go but here,
and I ask for his help,

325
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,793
he'll make me come home and...

326
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,294
(STAMMERING)

327
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,629
Work!

328
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,507
- So?
- So? Then I'll never get my big break.

329
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,176
Oh, and promise you won't call
your mother and tell her about this,

330
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,345
because then she'll call my mom
who will tell my dad,

331
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,764
and I don't think he really believes
I can make this happen.

332
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,182
He only gave me one month to prove it.

333
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,392
Well, then you've got one month
to prove him wrong.

334
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,852
(GROANS)

335
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,854
Why did I do this?

336
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,316
I want my canopy bed
and my housekeeper.

337
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,652
And a shower that doesn't share a room
with a kitchen.

338
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,406
- Come on.
- Where to?

339
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,201
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.

340
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,285
Yeah. Point taken. Come anyway.
Come on.

341
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,250
SHARPAY: I hope you're taking me
to a better apartment

342
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,376
than what you just showed me.

343

- Why are we here?

my dream and my camera.

and your camera.

And you need some cheering up

518
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:18,153

and watch us do our stuff

520
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:30,374
We're gonna sit and shake your hand
That's how it starts

We're gonna nose our nosy way
into your hearts

00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:43,387
We'll sing and bark
In two-part harmony

That's the best audition I've ever seen!

536
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,364
I'm Gill Samms, the director.

537

Neal Roberts, writer.

538
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,867
That was amazing!

Chills. Feel my hand...

540
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,703
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.

541
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,705
I won't feel your hand either,
but I believe you, too.

542
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,415
That is one special dog.

543

We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!

544
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,839
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.

(BARKS)

546
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,217
So, when do we start?

547
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,135
Well, there's one more waiting.

548
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,012
One more!

00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,096
One more, people!

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,768
Could you take a seat
in the front row, please?

551
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,228
There.

552
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,104

00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,987
And his dog, Countess.

556
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,072
FYI, I'm Roger.

557
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,369

by our extensive resume,

559

a musical opera in German.

564
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,433
I'm impressed.

565
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,976
This is us impressed.

566
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:41,356
Plus, she can bark a high C
with sustained vibrato.

567
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,859
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.

568

(LAUGHING)

569
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,968
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.

with either one of you and your dogs.

And can I just say,

622
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,211
this is the opportunity of a lifetime
for me.

623
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,965
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television,

624
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,716
because with Broadway,

625
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,220
real people are watching.

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,597
- Wow.
- Me, too.

want to work with you.

But only one can be in the show.

- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.

632
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,114
How about we work with both dogs
during rehearsals?

633
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:03,201
Wait! How about we work with
both dogs during rehearsals!

634
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,705
That way I could see
which one I work best with.

00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,666
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!

Can I just say
how totally great I think you are?

637
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,175
You do,
and I'll never wash my ears again.

638
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,843
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't

639
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,220
because I just thought of it,
but I think they loved you!

640
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,471
I like the way you think!

641
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,599
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.

642
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,143
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.

643
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,811
It totally shows.

give you my phone number.

you just let me know, okay?

- Here.
- Wow.

I mean, this is actually your number!

649
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,618
It looks like any ordinary number,
but it's not. It's yours!

PEYTON: You were great!
Boi was great.

655
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,968
This new strategy just might work.

656
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,347
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?

657
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,974
She inspires me. There. I said it.

658
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,061
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.

659
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,813
- How do you know?
- Easy. I don't do rejection.

660
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,567
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.

661
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,236
Oh! That's so nice of you.

662
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,197
And suggest that you give up now,
while you still have your dignity.

663
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,075
Distant though it already might be.

664

Sorry, which Smurf are you again?

665
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,037
True, you have talent.

666
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,539
But you lack both the experience
and the finesse

667
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,125
to ever achieve
the Holy Grail of possibility.

668
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,420
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.

00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,883
I'm sorry. For a minute there
you just bored me to death.

671
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,136
I have a foolproof strategy
of getting what I want.

672
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,265
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.

673
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,810
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.

674
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,229
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.

675
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,064
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.

676
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,167
All right, Boi. This foot. That foot.

677
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,546
Good boy! Yeah!

678

I'm not gonna let some hobbit
get in my way.

684
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,442
And, look.

685
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,695
All Boi can do is think about how
horrible that other little mangy dog was.

then you will get it.

688
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,334
All you need is one shot
to make it happen.

689
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,794
Yeah, and this is my shot.

690
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,006

"God only got one book published,

"and look how well it did for him."

Doing this is
all I've ever dreamed about,

693
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,181
especially since
I already have everything else.

694
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,683
Well, there's still humility.

695
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,560
What's wrong with being confident?

696
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,604
Confidence is
when you know you're good.

697
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,148
Arrogance is when you think
others know you're good.

698
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:23,068
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as
good as I think everyone thinks I am

I know they think it.

- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.

If my professor loves my film,
he talks about it.

702
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,748
Then there's a buzz,
then it gets in a festival,

703
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,334
then it gets distribution,
then I'm signing a studio deal,

704
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,418
then I'm getting an Oscar.

this is the opportunity of a lifetime
for me.

727
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,898
Broadway's not like film or television,

728
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,319
because with Broadway, people can see
if you write your lines on your hands!

It's complicated.

858
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,121
But I know it's gonna work out.

859
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,957
Sharpay, is there something
you're not telling me?

860
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,209
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...

861
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,087
I know, I know. I have one month
to get in the show, and then...

862
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,341
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.

863
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,385
You're sure everything's okay?

864
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,845
It's fine, Daddy.

865
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:57,475
Well, okay. We miss you, angel.

866
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,976
Miss you, too.

867
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,436
I love you!

868
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:09,487
Boi has to get that role. I can't go home.
Not as a failure.

869
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,241
I need some sort of subtle,
visibly crushing advantage over Roger.

870
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,953
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented,
that you've trained him well,

871
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,664
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?

872
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,333
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class
one long eyebrow.

873
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,168
I can't trust fate.

874
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,922
Some matters you just have to
take into your own hands.

875
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,509
What do you mean
you forgot my bottled water?

876
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,096
Well, I was going to get
those magazines

877
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,597
that you said you wanted
from across town,

878
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,766
and I got hit by a bike messenger.

879
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,936
So I went to the hospital for, like,
just one second to get these stitches.

880
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,063
And meanwhile, I had no water!

881
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,439
I will get it for you right now.

882
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,441
Now I've had to drink tap!

883
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,944
- I am so sorry.
- (MOCKING) "I am so sorry."

884
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,946
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?

885
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,197
Aside from catching some shade

886
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,658
from the shadow cast
by your madam's apple,

887
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:59,662
you're of no use to me.
You're... (WHIMPERING) fired!

888
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,874
(CRYING) God!

889
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,095
Amber Lee?

890
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:20,391
Oh, wow! You look so cute, Sharpie!

891
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,309
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.

892
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:26,147
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?

893
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,150
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.

894
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,694
She's not my assistant. She quit.

895
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,655
No wonder she was crying.

896
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,283
Yeah, I don't think
she even really cared.

897
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,578
Next time I should probably
just hire a best friend instead.

898
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,623
Wait!

899
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,834
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

900
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,419
What are you thinking
that I should be thinking?

901
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,504
I could help you out
until you replace her.

902
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,590
That is what I was thinking
about thinking.

903
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,842
Of course this can't, in any way,
affect your decision

904
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,510
of which dog gets the starring role.

905
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,179
Oh, it won't.

906
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,849
I couldn't live with myself
if I thought I did anything unfair.

907
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,145
You have my word. Hey, I know!
How about dinner?

908
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,023
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?

909
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,526
Get me a reservation for two
at someplace fantastic.

910
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,779
Then call my agent, have her meet me.

911
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,698
Right. Sure.

912
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:24,747
Oh. I won't forget this. And I promise,

913
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,540
it won't be because you're helping me

914
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:30,127
if I happen to take a little extra liking
to Girl.

915
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,214
- Boi.
- You changed it.

916
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,216
I like that even better.

917
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,259
Oh, and can you take my mic down
to the sound guy

918
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,554
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.

919
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,473
You're the best.

920
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,187
Amber Lee says
the wire is hurting her scalp.

921
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,939
Personally,
I think she's using the wrong shampoo,

922
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,899
but she's the star, and you know,
I don't wanna say anything.

923
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,067
You're hot.

924
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,486
Excuse me?

925
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,363
You're hot.

926
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,784
Okay. Even though theater lighting
highlights my natural skin tones,

927
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,411
thank you for noticing,
that's a little rude, don't you think?

928
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,372
No. Your mic's hot.

929
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,083
It means it's on.

930
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,710
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that,

931
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,714
it means it's on
and it's going through the entire theater.

932
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,009
Well, you could have led
with that part, thank you.

933
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,928
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!

934
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,602
(LAUGHS) You're hot.

935
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:31,522
Then she asked me to help her out
after her assistant quit.

936
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,649
And after I suggested it.

937
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,151
Are you sure this is wise?

938
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,320
I'm sorry. Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.

939
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:42,199
It's perfect. Amber Lee will see
that she and I are exactly alike,

940
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,869
we'll become BFFs,
she'll make sure Boi gets the role,

941
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,871
then his fame becomes my fame!

942
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,290
I mean, this is the advantage
I've been waiting for!

943
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,708
Isn't it more like taking advantage?

944
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,710
And my father thought
I couldn't do this in a month.

945
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,254
It's turning out better than I imagined.

946
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,965
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

947
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,765

00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,186
Sure. Be right over.

00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,032
Oh, thank goodness. In here, quickly.

952
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,668
I just... I can't reach that.

953
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,255
Can't reach it?

954
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:43,844
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.

955
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,140
Only a true friend would come
all the way down here at this hour

956
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,600
and help me with something like that.

957
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,315
- So, I passed?
- Yes.

958
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,441
(GIGGLING)

959
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,860
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.

960
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,291
Thank you.

961
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,800
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.

962
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,885
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.

963
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,763
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot

964
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,557
to make sure I look as fabulous
as you always do.

965
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,228
- Are you serious?
- Serious? You're now also my stylist.

966
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,730
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.

967
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,201
"Life is so strange.

00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:53,414

"and instead, we find love."

00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:02,673
Hey! How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?

971
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,427
Can't. I have to highlight script changes
for Amber Lee,

972
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,972
then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!

973
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:14,018
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.

974
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,895
And you did promise to shoot
some more stuff for my film.

975
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:20,399
You know,
what I'm doing is important, too.

976
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,525
Oh.

977
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:24,653
For a minute there,
you sounded like Amber Lee.

978
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:35,831
"Good to see you. Good to see
you. Good to see you. Good to see you."

979
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:41,503
Bad news. My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.

980
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,881
Chores?

981
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:50,596
And I want to talk to you about Boi.

982
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,098
But you have to promise
it'll stay between us.

983
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:54,975
Okay.

984
00:55:56,102 --> 00:56:02,441
I think I'm going to ask the director
to give Boi the part.

985
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,653
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!

986
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,113
You won't be sorry.

987
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,783

Oh!

990
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,321
Oh, no.

991
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,880
There are some changes for
the blocking in the dog scene,

992
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,006
top of act two.

993
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,093
Countess can learn these in no time.

994
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,220
She's got a memory
like a digital hard drive.

995
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,639
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.

996
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,058
I need to find Sharpay
and make sure she gets them.

997
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,768
Boi is doing
the first run-through tomorrow.

998
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,603
I'd be more than happy
to deliver them to her.

00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,689
- Great.
- Thank you.

1000
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,650

That's unfortunate.

And I've been here ever since.

side of the stage with the ring box!

00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,903
Yeah, sorry. We changed that blocking.
What happened?

1012
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,863
What is wrong with this dog?

1013
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:26,001
And is he okay? It's not his fault.

1014
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:30,130
He's just a little dog! He's just so sweet.

Let's break for a few.

what happened.

We sent out the script changes,
but Boi didn't do them.

has its drawbacks.

1194
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:54,898
(EXCLAIMS)

1195
01:09:55,274 --> 01:10:00,278
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-I-L-G-T mean?

1196
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:03,072
"Come quick. Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.

1197
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:05,867
I really should have gotten that.

1198
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:08,161
Listen, Amber Lee Adams
isn't what you think.

1199
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:11,206
A self absorbed, two-faced panther
who would eat her young alive

1200
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:14,542
on a reality show rather than allow
anyone to steal her spotlight?

1201
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:16,794
Okay, she's what you think.

1202
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:20,340
Listen, I don't care if her parents
had to tie beefjerky around her neck

1203
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,342
just to get the family dog
to play with her,

1204
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,385
as long as Countess is at her side
on that stage.

1205
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,137
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1206
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,514
She wants the part of the dog
written out completely!

1207
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:31,100
- That's not fair!
- Too far.

1208
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,686
Well, I am 12, remember?

1209
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:37,023
Roger, we've been fighting
the wrong battle, each other.

1210
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:39,776
We need to form an alliance
and work against a common enemy.

1211
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,445
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.

1212
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,239
Trust me,
the zit battle is one you won't win.

1213
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,573
But what can we do?

1214
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,909
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.

1215
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,661
The audience will be filled
with members

1216
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:50,995
of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.

1217
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,455
I know, I saw the tweet.

1218
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,793
Fine. Yes, I follow her, too.

1219
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:01,089
Okay, we need to show people
exactly who Amber Lee really is.

1220
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:03,841
It's time someone taught her
how to behave in the theater.

1221
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,512
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.

1222
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:09,931
Tell me what you need me to do.

1223
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,438
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?

1224
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,232
I have been trying to reach you all day.

1225
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:23,152
Oh. Sorry, my phone
must have been turned off.

1226
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:25,822
Without asking me first?

1227
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:28,741
I just wanted to say good luck.

1228
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:31,327
You know, I know you chose Countess
for this performance tonight,

1229
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:32,996
and I'm fine with that.

1230
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:36,040
Well, it was nothing personal,
but your phone was shut off,

1231
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:41,045
so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?

1232
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,756
We're good.

1233
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,343
Hug? Okay.

1234
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,313
(ALL CHATTERING)

1235
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,947
Hello, everyone. I'm Gill, the director.

1236
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,825
And I'm Neal,
the under-appreciated writer.

1237
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:11,951
(ALL LAUGHING)

1238
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,495
And we are thrilled that you're here
for our first performance

1239
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,955
in front of an audience.

1240
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,458
Does everyone here
know how to applaud?

1241
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,465
Okay, how about the balcony up there?

1242
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,634
SHARPAY: Okay, now.
NEAL: Can you hear us? You're good!

1243
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,262
(VOCALIZING)

1244
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,181
- (BARKING)
- (SCREAMS)

1245
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,309
Will somebody please control
these wannabe werewolves?

1246
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:37,602
Hello? People?

1247
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:41,064
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to
do a show with dogs!

1248
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:45,234
I'm the star, not them! Stage people?

1249
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:49,906
Could somebody please put these rats
with rabies out of my misery? Anyone!

1250
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,866
Finally, you idiot! What took so long?

1251
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,327
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten
fur bags out of here!

1252
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:57,330
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.

1253
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:00,208
You think all those boring freaks
with no lives

1254
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,001
came to worship two no-name mutts?

1255
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:07,465
I don't think so! I'm the one they love!
Me! They came to see...

1256
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,307
(ALL BOOING)

1257
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:25,233
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1258
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,193
I knew I forgot to tell you something.

1259
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,445
Careful, your mic's on.

1260
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:34,200
You did this to me. You ruined me!

1261
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:36,160
News flash! You ruined you!

1262
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,079
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!

1263
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:41,582
The only reason you even wanted to be
my friend is so I'd choose your dog!

1264
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:45,086
No, no. At first, I idolized you,

1265
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,255
even more than myself,
which isn't easy.

1266
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:49,257
But you're not at all
what I thought you were.

1267
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:50,383
(SCOFFS)

1268
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,096
You and I are exactly alike.

1269
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,432
Except I don't enjoy
letting people down.

1270
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,600
I don't use people to feel better
about myself.

1271
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,395
And I definitely don't wear yellow
and orange in the same week,

1272
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,397
let alone the same outfit, okay?

1273
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,818
Maybe I did think you and I were alike,
but not anymore.

1274
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:13,948
In fact, I'd be embarrassed
if someone thought I was like you.

1275
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,037
Well, I quit!

1276
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,250
And without me, there's no show.

1277
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,960
Now neither one
of your furry little friends

1278
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:28,796
will have their shot and neither will you.

1279
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,841
Blame her!

1280
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,310
I'm sorry. Someone had to say it.

1281
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,688
I'll go talk some sense into her.

1282
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:51,486
You, out of this theater right now.

1283
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,954
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.

1284
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:07,251
No. You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.

1285
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:09,504
You win.

1286
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,216
That's not what it feels like.

1287
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:25,186
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

1288
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,691
- Hey. Can I come in?
- Sure.

1289
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:38,282
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.

1290
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,701
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.

1291
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,666
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.

1292
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,548
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do now?

1293
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,842
Move home where there's enough room
for my pores to open,

1294
01:15:56,927 --> 01:16:00,846
spend months in the spa getting
this layer of New York grime off my skin,

1295
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,098
and mostly...

1296
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,850
...miss you.

1297
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:08,854
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.

1298
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,191
I already talked to my dad.

1299
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,528
I guess I'm gonna start...
(STAMMERING)

1300
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:18,739
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.

1301
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,578
What about your dream of being a star?

1302
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,580
It's still there.

1303
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,583
It's just a little bit more of a dream
than a reality.

1304
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,921
- You know what today is?
- What?

1305
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:39,427
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.

1306
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,973
Well, so then you still have eight hours.

1307
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,815
This isn't how
my movie's supposed to end.

1308
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,152
I guess it is.

1309
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,321
(PHONE RINGING)

1310
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,075
This is Sharpay.

1311
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:04,910
Uh-huh.

1312
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,246
Sure. No, no. I'll be there.

1313
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,790
(SIGHS)

1314
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,459
That was the stage manager.

1315
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,545
They want me to come to the theater
and clear out Boi's things.

1316
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,839
I can go with you if you want.

1317
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:19,634
I want.

1318
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:24,764
GILL: And, so, Amber Lee has quit.

1319
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:26,307
- Gone.
- Kaput.

1320
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,686
NEAL: The producers feel,
without a star, we can't open.

1321
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:34,148
The time it would take to find someone
who could learn the role and do it well

1322
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:38,361
might take weeks, and it would cost
too much to keep the production going.

1323
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:43,699
But we want you all to know,
it was great almost working with you.

1324
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,211
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.

1325
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:06,764
GILL: Thank you for your hard work.

1326
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:09,517
We are so, so sorry, people.

1327
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,735
Wait! Wait, it's not over. It's not over.

1328
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:22,446
Look, it doesn't have to be.

1329
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,741
Look, there is someone who knows
the part by heart and who is amazing.

1330
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,120
All right, maybe she's not a star yet,
but she will be.

1331
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,123
This show will make her one.
Just watch.

1332
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:40,172
SHARPAY: Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.

1333
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:43,968
Boi, go mark. Go mark. Good!

1334
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,512
Okay, stay. Stay.

1335
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,683
I love when you use that accent, but...
(SHUSHING)

1336
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,143
We're not supposed to be in here.

1337
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,228
Okay, now let's do the scene
where the character Lenore

1338
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:55,396
thinks she's lost everything

1339
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,357
and you come over to console her.
Come on.

1340
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:03,279
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.

1341
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:06,282
Nothing is working out the way
I planned it.

1342
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:11,036
(SINGING) I got something inside ofme

1343
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:14,665
Something that needs to be heard

1344
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:20,796
Deep down a voice is guiding me

1345
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:25,468
Hidden emotions have stirred

1346
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:33,225
Why have I let others lead the way

1347
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:39,607
When all along I know what it is
I want to say

1348
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,903
Whatever it is
I'll do it

1349
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,031
I'm the answer to your prayers

1350
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,950
Whatever you want
Stop looking

1351
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:53,037
Nobody else compares

1352
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,915
Whatever you've seen before

1353
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:59,418
I'll give you so much more

1354
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,962
You'll be totally impressed

1355
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,716
I'm New York's best kept secret

1356
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:22,399
I thought I had a perfect plan

1357
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:26,278
