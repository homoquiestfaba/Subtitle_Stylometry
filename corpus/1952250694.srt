00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,920
Let's go!

4
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,220
Come, boys. Tackle! Tackle!

5
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,920
All right.

6
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,590
Good work, boys. Keep it up.

7
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:47,960
"Mandela! Mandela! Mandela!"

8
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,560
Who is it, sir?

9
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,520
It's that terrorist, Mandela.
They let him out.

10
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,400
Remember this day, boys.

11
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,250
This is the day our country
went to the dogs.

12
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,220
Come. Let's go. Come.

13
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,900
<i>I'm now in a position to announce</i>

14
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,620
<i>that Mr. Nelson Mandela will be released</i>

15
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,700
<i>out of Victor Verster prison</i>

16
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,250
<i>on Sunday the 11.th February</i>

17
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,420
<i>at about 3:00 pm.</i>

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,200
<i>There's Mr. Nelson Mandela.</i>

19
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,970
<i>Mr. Mandela, a free man, taking his
first steps into a new South Africa.</i>

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,050
<i>This is the moment the world
has been waiting for.</i>

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,220
<i>...and the top news of the day
here in South Africa</i>

22
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,920
<i>and around the world.</i>

23
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,030
<i>The recent release of Nelson Mandela
from prison</i>

24
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,450
<i>has triggered a power struggle
between the ANC and their black rivals</i>

25
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,800
<i>There are reports that the
government has been</i>

26
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,450
<i>secretly providing Arms to these groups,</i>

27
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,540
<i>contributing to the violence that is
erupted through out the country.</i>

28
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,420
<i>South Africa appears to be
on the verge of the civil war.</i>

29
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,430
<i>Mr. Mandela has traveled to Durban
in an effort to persuade</i>

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,210
<i>a hundred thousand angry young
ANC supporters</i>

31
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,620
<i>on the front line to make peace.</i>

32
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,390
<i>Take your knives, and your guns,
and your pangas,</i>

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,880
<i>and throw them into the sea.</i>

34
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,390
<i>After four years of talks,</i>

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,210
<i>the day black South Africans
have been fighting for</i>

36
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,860
<i>has finally arrived.</i>

37
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,020
<i>For the first time they're free to
cast their vote along side whites.</i>

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,340
<i>And estimated twenty three million
people went to the polls today.</i>

39
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,560
<i>I, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela,</i>

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,740
<i>do hear-by swear to be faithful</i>

41
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,490
<i>to the Republic of South Africa.</i>

42
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,010
<i>Never, never and never again</i>

43
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,910
<i>shall it be that this beautiful land</i>

44
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,000
<i>will again experience the oppression</i>

45
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,090
<i>of one by another,</i>

46
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,610
<i>and suffer the indignity</i>

47
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,730
<i>of being the skunk of the world.</i>

48
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,720
Madiba!

49
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,570
Madiba!

50
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,390
Here he is. Like clockwork.

51
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,640
It makes him such an easy target.

52
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,600
Yes. Good morning.

53
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,800
- "Mono Tata"
- How are you?

54
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,760
We're sharp, Madiba.

55
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,660
Good.

56
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,510
- Linga, how's your mother?
- She's much better. Thanks.

57
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,060
Good. Very good.

58
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,370
Linga, watch your left.

59
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,810
Madiba. Madiba.

60
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,160
All right.

61
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,650
What does it say?

62
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,855
It says, “He can win an election,

63
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,410
but can he run a country?”

64
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,030
Not even one day on the job
and they're after you.

65
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,340
It's a legitimate question.

66
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,780
<i>Today marks the beginning of a new
era in South Africa</i>

67
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,680
<i>as President Mandela takes
office in Pretoria,</i>

68
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,570
<i>facing issues that range from
economic stagnation</i>

69
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,970
<i>and unemployment to rising crime.</i>

70
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,400
<i>While at the same time balancing
black aspirations with white fears.</i>

71
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,660
I never thought I'd see the day.

72
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,870
I feel sorry for you, son. You've
got your whole life ahead of you.

73
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,650
- What's it going to be like now?
- Don't be so gloomy.

74
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,230
Now I added vitamins.

75
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,150
There's a horrible flu bug going around.

76
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,350
You tell Nerine, when you get home.

77
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,690
Thanks, ma.

78
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,770
I'm telling you, Francois --

79
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,780
look at Angola, look at Mozambique.
Look at Zimbabwe.

80
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,160
We're next.

81
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,460
They're going to take our jobs
and drive us into the sea.

82
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,040
Just you wait.

83
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,450
- Good morning.
- Morn.

84
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,180
- Good morning.
- "Good morning"

85
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,630
Good morning.

86
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,360
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

87
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,210
Brenda, you've had your hair done.
I like it.

88
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,020
Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk about
your cabinet appointments and ministers.

89
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,930
- Give me one moment, please.
- Yes, Madiba.

90
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,180
- After you, Comrade President.
- Thank you, sir.

91
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,920
<i>Office of the President, good
morning.</i>

92
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,790
Brenda, please assemble all the
staff for me.

93
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,800
All those who haven't already left.

94
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,660
Right now? All of them?

95
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,150
Yes, please.

96
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
Yes. Madiba.

97
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,050
Ladies and gentlemen if you'd like
to follow me, please.

98
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,130
The president would like to speak
with you.

99
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,330
- Here he comes.
- Yeah.

100
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,410
He wants the satisfaction
of firing us himself.

101
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,670
I'd like you to stay out here.

102
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,890
- But, Madiba... - I cannot talk to
them hiding behind men with guns.

103
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,710
Gooie more almal.

104
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,810
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

105
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,070
- Fine.
- It's good to see you.

106
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,680
Thank you for coming on such short
notice.

107
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,850
Some of you may know who I am.

108
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,790
I couldn't help noticing the empty
offices

109
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,730
as I came to work this morning.

110
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,000
And all of the packing boxes.

111
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,080
Now, of course, if you want to leave,
that is your right.

112
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,690
And if you feel in your heart

113
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,850
that you cannot work with
your new government,

114
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,250
then it is better that you do leave,

115
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,450
right away.

116
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,720
But if you are packing up because
you fear that your language,

117
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,490
or the color of your skin,
or who you worked for before,

118
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,180
disqualifies you from working here,

119
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,410
I am here to tell you,

120
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,750
have no such fear.

121
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,600
What is verby is verby.

122
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,040
The past is the past.

123
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,260
We look to the future, now.

124
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,940
We need your help.

125
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,730
We want your help.

126
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,610
If you'd like to stay,

127
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,350
you'd be doing your country
a great service.

128
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,200
All I ask is that you do your work

129
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,070
to the best of your abilities,
and with good hearts.

130
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,790
I promise to do the same.

131
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,000
If we can manage that,

132
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,800
our country will be a shining light
in the world.

133
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
Thank you.

134
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,470
Molo, sis.

135
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,360
It's still morning?

136
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,240
Yeah. So, now, when you get a chance,
can we get the schedule for the month?

137
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,590
- Yeah.
- We need to plan security.

138
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,000
Office of the President, good morning.

139
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,190
Yes sir.

140
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,730
We will do have that ready for you.

141
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,410
We need more men.

142
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,150
Did you talk to Brenda about it?

143
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,320
Yes. Yesterday.

144
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,120
That must be Jessie, with the schedule.

145
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,720
Come in, beautiful.

146
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,010
What is this?

147
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,890
Mr. Jason Tshabalala?

148
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,460
That's me. Am I under arrest?

149
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,850
Captain Van Eck and team
reporting for duty, sir.

150
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,620
What duty?

151
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,820
With the Presidential bodyguard.
We've been assigned to this office.

152
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,740
Here are our orders.

153
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,090
You're Special Branch, right?

154
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,350
You'll see that they've been signed.

155
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,800
I don't care if they're signed---

156
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,640
Just wait here.

157
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,180
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

158
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,340
You look agitated, Jason.

159
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,580
That's because there are four Special
Branch cops in my office.

160
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,630
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

161
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,990
They say they're the Presidential
bodyguards.

162
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,390
And they have orders signed by you.

163
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,770
Oh yes. Oh yes.

164
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,350
These men have special training by
SAS.

165
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,540
They've a lots of experience.
They protected De Klerk.

166
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,130
Yes, sir. But it doesn't mean that they
have to come---

167
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,410
You asked for more men, didn't you?

168
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,480
Yes, sir. I asked---

169
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,030
When people see me in public,
they see my bodyguards.

170
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,080
You represent me, directly.

171
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,060
The rainbow nation starts here.

172
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,100
Reconciliation starts here.

173
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,080
- Reconciliation, sir?
- Yes. Reconciliation, Jason.

174
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,270
Comrade President...

175
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Not long ago these guys tried to kill us.

176
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,480
Maybe even these four guys in my office
tried and, often, succeeded!

177
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,030
Yes, I know.

178
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,140
Forgiveness starts here, too.

179
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,030
Forgiveness liberates the soul.

180
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,120
It removes fear.

181
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,150
That is why it is such a powerful weapon.

182
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,530
Please, Jason,

183
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,610
try it.

184
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,830
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

185
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,270
Just a minute.

186
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,580
Two copies of the schedule.

187
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,180
Thank you, Jessie.

188
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,910
Jason, can we get rid
of these guys, now?

189
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,140
Here's the schedule for the month.

190
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,470
Let's look them over for assignments.

191
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,020
- Right.
- What?

192
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,750
Hey, Jason. Can I talk to you?

193
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,670
How can we trust them?

194
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,060
We can't.
That's what Madiba wants, okay.

195
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,160
Let's go.

196
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,840
Are there any special orders or
conditions?

197
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,920
No. Oh, yes.

198
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,120
Madiba doesn't like it if you don't
smile when you push people away.

199
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,430
Seriously?

200
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,130
Yes, seriously.

201
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,430
It's the new South Africa.

202
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,040
Madiba?

203
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,880
That's the President's clan name.

204
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,920
That's what we call him.

205
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,670
We'll call him Mr. President.

206
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,540
Can we go through the schedule now?

207
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,140
Can you gentlemen come closer?

208
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,500
xxx

209
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,550
xxx

210
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,020
xxx

211
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,280
How's he going to do all this, huh?

212
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,080
When does he take a break?

213
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,480
He says he rested enough in prison.

214
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,040
- Here's a headache.
- What?

215
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,120
The rugby match.

216
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,240
England against Springboks
at Loftus Stadium.

217
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,220
Well. That's gonna be a headache for
England, that's for sure.

218
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,850
We're going to donder them.

219
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,850
I don't care about the game.

220
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,020
All I care about is that
the President'll be exposed.

221
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,250
- Yeah. To thousand drunken...
- Sports fans?

222
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,890
Yes.

223
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
Sports fans.

224
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,860
Who didn't vote for him.

225
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,770
Who probably hate him.

226
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,250
Who came out of the womb
with guns in their hands.

227
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,120
What?

228
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,260
<i>Let's welcome captain, Francois
Pineaar!</i>

229
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,260
<i>and his squad of team Springboks
here in Loftus.</i>

230
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,850
<i>Today's game RAF is from New Zealand.</i>

231
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,200
Hey, Guys.

232
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,680
I want your eyes on the crowd
at all times.

233
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,230
He's taking the middle of the field.

234
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,920
He's going to walk in, shake hands,
and walk back. And that's it.

235
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,460
- You got it?
- Yeah.

236
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,010
Okay. Let's go.

237
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,210
<i>Ladies and gentleman,</i>

238
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,030
<i>it is our pleasure xxx today</i>

239
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,920
<i>at Loftus Versfeld</i>

240
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,450
<i>our newly elected President,</i>

241
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,350
<i>Mr. Nelson Mandela.</i>

242
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,800
Good luck, captain.

243
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,870
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.

244
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,990
- Good luck, son.
- Thank you very much.

245
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,090
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

246
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,440
- Good luck, Chester.
- Yes sir.

247
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,390
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

248
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,070
Sir.

249
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,290
- Stop him.
- No. Stay with him.

250
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,400
Thank you for honoring our new flag!

251
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,100
It's a pleasure, sir.

252
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,640
Thank you.

253
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,550
How are you. How are you.

254
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,230
- Good to see you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

255
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,780
Good to see you.

256
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,680
Madiba. Madiba. Madiba!

257
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,810
You're delaying the rugby, sir.

258
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,530
Oh, yes, of course.

259
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,910
- Why didn't you stop him?
- Well. You try next time.

260
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,750
Does he do that sort of thing
all the time?

261
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,300
Ask my ulcer.

262
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,030
- Good thing it was just a cup.
- And good thing he never saw it.

263
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,380
Oh, he saw it. He sees everything.

264
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,100
I hate rugby.

265
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,660
- Yay!
- "That's right"

266
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,120
With you. With you. Keep on running.
Outside . Outside. Come on.

267
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,290
Come on.

268
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,570
<i>...Team England scored...</i>

269
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,250
<i>England, 11</i>

270
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,010
<i>South Africa, 0</i>

271
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,280
These English mean business.
We need to focus!

272
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,660
Come on. We need to focus. Focus!

273
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,190
Come on.

274
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,190
Why don't we do a little work
while we watch.

275
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,900
We have a lot of promises to keep.

276
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,450
Yes, we do.

277
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,560
It's not too late,

278
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,250
if the boys can just pick up their game.

279
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,040
If they don't, heads will roll.

280
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,200
C'mon you bloody bastards!

281
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,040
Where do you want go first,
for foreign investment?

282
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,640
Where the money is.

283
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,260
America, England, Saudi Arabia.

284
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,340
How long before the World Cup?

285
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,660
About a year.

286
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,560
Now, it's time enough for
improvement.

287
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,730
Mr. President...

288
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,450
...I wouldn't get my hopes up.

289
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,680
We're a damn disgrace.

290
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,070
Do you see all those old
apartheid flags?

291
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,730
It's a disgrace.

292
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,120
It's also a constitutional right.

293
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,370
Along with the apartheid anthem. I know.

294
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,530
But it's time people moved on.

295
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,180
Look at this.

296
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,170
All of the whites are cheering
for the Springboks.

297
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,090
All of the blacks are cheering
for England.

299
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,960
I used to do that on the island.

300
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,830
We would cheer for anyone
but the 'boks.

301
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,900
It made warders very angry.

302
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,810
Of course it did.

303
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,990
Sorry I'm late, how's it going?

304
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,690
Very badly.

305
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,590
Maybe it's just as well.

306
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,420
Why?

307
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,540
I've just been at a meeting of
the National Sports executive.

308
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,930
There's strong support to drop
the Springbok emblem

309
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,890
and colors altogether

310
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,410
If they're playing badly.

311
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,780
Maybe it's a good time to make a change.

312
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,270
This could be the last time we have
to look at the green and gold.

313
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,700
Shit.

314
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,500
<i>Francois Pienaar's team came
to Loftus Versfeld stadium</i>

315
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,750
<i>this afternoon,</i>

316
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,600
<i>unprepared and arrogant.</i>

317
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,870
They left 80 minutes later with
their tails between their legs,

318
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,610
like whipped mongrels.

319
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,730
And I, for one, am glad.

320
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,970
Not because they lost, but because
there's now no way to ignore the fact

321
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,090
that we are completely
and utterly unprepared

322
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,440
<i>to reenter the world of top-notch
international rugby.</i>

323
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,900
<i>The Rugby World Cup is now
less than a year away,</i>

324
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,340
<i>and I, for one, am relieved
that we are the host nation,</i>

325
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,980
<i>and therefore qualified automatically
for the tournament.</i>

326
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,140
Somebody gets the axe.

327
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,760
<i>Because I'm not sure that we would
get in on merit alone.</i>

328
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,490
Who's it gonna be?

329
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,940
<i>Pienaar's team played without discipline,</i>

330
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,180
<i>without strategy and without courage.</i>

331
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,530
<i>And therefore...</i>

332
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,340
He's trying to get them to drop me.

333
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,040
He's just bitter because the Springboks
were boycotted when he played.

334
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,140
Maybe, but people listen to
what he says.

335
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,150
<i>they brought shame upon our nation,</i>

336
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,870
<i>and I, for one, can say without fear
of contradiction,</i>

337
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,070
<i>that today, these fifteen so-called men</i>

338
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,640
<i>did not deserve to wear
the hallowed green and gold.</i>

339
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,740
Here's your muti, Madiba.

340
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,720
I warmed the milk tonight.

341
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,340
You're too good to me, Mary.

342
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,130
Your daughter called, to cancel
her visit this weekend.

343
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,150
All right. Did she say why?

344
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,380
No, she didn't.

345
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,780
She said to tell you she was sorry.

346
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,000
I see.

347
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,280
Do you need anything else tonight?

348
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,350
No, Mary. Thank you. I'll go to bed.

349
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,400
Good evening, Tata.

350
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,280
Good evening, Mary.

351
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,980
Hello. There you go.

352
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,680
Oh, yes.

353
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,970
- Some nice pants for you.
- God bless you.

354
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,990
There you go.

355
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,100
There you go.

356
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,480
God bless you.

357
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,270
You're a very lucky boy.

358
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,250
It's a real Springbok practise jersey!

359
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,360
I mean, I know It's a bit big, but
it's warm and it'll last for ever!

360
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,980
C'mon.

361
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,350
C'mon. Take it. It's yours!

362
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,150
Why won't he take it?

363
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,000
If he wears it, the others will beat
him up.

364
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,340
Because the Springboks
are playing so badly?

365
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,460
No. Because, for them, the Springboks
still represent apartheid.

366
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,350
...and now, for the next item
on our agenda.

367
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,820
The NSC executive proposes a vote
on the following motion

368
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,540
that as a prominent symbol
of the apartheid era,

369
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,080
the colors, emblem and the name
of the Springboks

370
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,450
be eliminated immediately

371
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,880
and that all sports teams
representing South Africa

372
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,740
shall be known forthwith as
the Proteas.

373
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,720
Now, Comrades, we will submit
this motion to a hand vote.

374
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,390
In the event of a close count,

375
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,510
we will go to a written ballot.

376
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,020
All those in favor of eliminating
the Springboks,

377
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,260
raise your hands.

378
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,860
Viva! Viva!

379
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,630
Viva Proteas! Viva!

380
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,470
- "Viva!"
- Viva Proteas! Viva!

381
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,800
- "Viva!"
- Viva Proteas! Viva!

382
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,450
- "Viva!"
- Avanza!

383
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,380
"Ole"

384
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,420
Both units to their cars. Right now.

385
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:13,080
xxx

386
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,060
What do I tell the Japanese
trade delegation?

387
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,820
I delegate that decision to you.

388
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,350
Do you want me to inform the VP?

389
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,180
No.

390
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,700
We should at least include
the Minister of Sport.

391
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,520
No.

392
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,670
I strongly advise against doing this.
Especially on your own.

393
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,000
It gives the impression of autocratic
leadership.

394
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,030
You risk alienating your cabinet
and your party.

395
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,300
Your advice is duly noted.

396
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,770
Madiba, the people want this.

397
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,040
They hate the Springboks. They don't
want to be represented by a team

398
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,580
they cheered against all their lives.

399
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,490
Yes, I know. But in this instance
the people are wrong.

400
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,190
And as their elected leader,
it is my job to show them that.

401
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,630
You're risking your political capital.

402
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,830
You're risking your future as our leader.

403
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,880
The day I am afraid to do that is
the day I am no longer fit to lead.

404
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,960
At least risk it for something
more important than rugby.

405
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:12,860
Tell the boys that I want to go to
Eersterust, very fast.

406
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,650
We in the executive'd like to applaud you

407
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,960
for your diligence and your courage.

408
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,860
Please, join us in our anthem.

409
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,940
¶ Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika ¶

410
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,550
¶ Maluphakanyisw' uphondo lwayo ¶

411
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:07,180
¶ Yizwa imithandazo yethu ¶

412
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,520
¶ Nkosi sikelela... ¶

413
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,060
Comrades, comrades, members
of the choir---

414
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,310
we would only interrupt such beautiful
music for something truly important.

415
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,730
Please, welcome, President Mandela!

416
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,040
Thank you.

417
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,090
Thank you.

418
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,190
Thank you.

419
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,960
Why thank you. Please.

420
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,280
Smile.

421
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:00,380
Brothers, sisters, Comrades,

422
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,670
I am here because I believe
you have made a decision

423
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,740
with insufficient information and
foresight.

424
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,530
I am aware of your earlier vote.

425
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,800
I am aware that it was unanimous.

426
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:31,070
Nonetheless, I believe we should
restore the Springboks.

427
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:42,330
Restore their name, their emblem
and their colors, immediately.

428
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,640
Let me tell you why.

429
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,530
On Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison,

430
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,250
all of my jailers were Afrikaners.

431
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,110
For twenty seven years,

432
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,000
I studied them.

433
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,840
I learned their language,

434
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,260
I read their books,

435
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,370
their poetry.

436
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,260
I had to know my enemy,

437
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,170
before I could prevail against him.

438
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,120
And we did prevail, did we not?

439
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,600
All of us here we prevailed.

440
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,260
Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner.

441
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,380
They are our fellow South Africans,

442
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:41,490
our partners in democracy.

443
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,370
And they treasure Springbok rugby.

444
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,850
If we take that away, we lose them.

445
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,540
We prove that we are what they feared
we would be.

446
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,240
We have to be better than that.

447
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,155
We have to surprise them

448
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,690
with a compassion,

449
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,610
with restraint,

450
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,390
and generosity.

451
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,300
I know.

452
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:24,990
All of the things they denied us.

453
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,580
But this is no time to celebrate
a petty revenge.

454
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,930
This is the time to build our nation

455
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,150
using every single brick available to
us---

456
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,940
even if that brick comes wrapped in
green and gold.

457
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,600
You elected me your leader.

458
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,480
Let me lead you now.

459
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,640
Who is with me on this?

460
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,660
Who is with me?

461
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,430
Twelve votes.

462
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,370
Twelve!

463
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,280
A luxury.

464
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,470
We only needed one more yes than no.

465
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,050
What if you hadn't got it?

466
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,580
Well, as you know,
that is the parties decision.

467
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,240
I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got
problems everywhere we look.

468
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,930
Housing, food, jobs,
crime, our currency.

469
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,690
You can't keep interrupting affairs
of state to placate a minority.

470
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,240
But, I must.

471
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:56,120
That minority still controls the police,
the army, and the economy.

472
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,900
If we lose them we cannot address
the other issues.

473
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,700
So, this rugby,

474
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,840
it's just a political calculation?

475
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,230
It is a human calculation.

476
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,050
If we take away, what they cherish---

477
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,580
the Springboks, their national anthem --

478
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,270
we just reinforce the cycle of fear
between us.

479
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,680
I'll do what I must to break that
cycle.

480
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,660
Or it will destroy us.

481
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,000
This beer tastes like shit, man.

482
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,660
It's not the beer.

483
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,990
Take another.

484
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,040
Everybody take one.

485
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,800
Boys,  I'd like to propose a toast...

486
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,780
To the taste of defeat.

487
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,260
Drink it.

488
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,960
Remember this.

489
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,340
And promise yourself, never to taste
it again.

490
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,280
You're right. It tastes like shit.

491
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,380
Here's the schedule for the
overseas trip.

492
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,570
Let me see.

493
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,080
$ Speaking Afrikaans $

494
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,190
What did he just say?

495
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,600
He asked when we were supposed to sleep.

496
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,210
As well as other basic human functions.

497
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,560
Hey.

498
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,750
If Madiba can do it, we can do it.

499
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,740
In a common struggle

500
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,680
that has brought about our emancipation

501
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:41,370
and pushed back the frontiers of racism.

502
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,980
The millions of our people

503
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,870
say thank you, and thank you again.

504
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,530
I come here with a message.

505
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,810
<i>People of the Unites States of America:</i>

506
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,470
<i>Open your markets to us.</i>

507
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,970
<i>And come invest in our country.</i>

508
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,860
<i>...and in Japan, President Mandela
met with Japanese officials.</i>

509
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,500
<i>As he concluded a gruelling trip
to the Far East...</i>

510
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,710
And in related news, it was
announced that President Mandela

511
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,240
will visit South Africa this week.

512
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,500
Stop it, old man.

513
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,050
Hey. It's cold, man.

514
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,230
- Morning, Madiba.
- How are you?

515
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,230
- Fine. Thanks.
- Morning, sir.

516
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,000
How is your family, Hendrick?

517
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,250
Top shape, sir. How about yours?

518
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,800
I have a large family.

519
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,700
42 million.

520
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,620
I don't think I'll walk today.

521
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,940
We never, never ask him
about his family.

522
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,910
But he asks about ours all the time.

523
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,950
Think about it, man. He's separated
from his wife, his children...

524
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,240
How often do you see them here, huh?

525
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,680
He's not a saint, okay. He's a man,
with a man's problems

526
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,680
he doesn't need us reminding him
about them.

527
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,730
- Good morning, Madiba.
- Good morning.

528
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,090
- Thank you very much.
- Enjoy it.

529
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,270
Oh, yes.

530
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,870
Very good.

531
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,130
Very good.

532
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,590
- Brenda, good morning.
- Good morning, Madiba.

533
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,140
I like that dress.

534
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,890
Thank you.

535
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,400
This is for you.

536
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,480
What is it?

537
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,580
Your pay checks. You haven't been
collecting them.

538
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,410
What's wrong?

539
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,000
This is terrible.

540
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,400
It's what De Klerk got.
Plus an increase for inflation.

541
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,980
<i>Today, President Mandela announced that,
in his opinion---</i>

542
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,640
Thanks.

543
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,520
<i>---his salary is too high.</i>

544
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,710
Dead right. They're all overpaid.

545
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,110
<i>He has therefore decided to donate
a third of his monthly income to charity.</i>

546
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:44,380
Give me the houses and cars they give him
and I'll donate a third of my salary too.

547
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:47,650
- You would not. Not in a million years.
- Pienaar, Hallo.

548
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,710
Hang on a moment, please.

549
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,320
<i>President Mandela said that
he wished to set an example</i>

550
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:54,870
- to other leaders and Cabinet Ministers.
- Yes. Of course.

551
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,570
- Why thank you. Thank you
- Fat chance.

552
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,290
They're lining their pockets as fast as
they can.

553
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,300
Must be his girlfriend, Nerine...

554
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,400
He knows I'd bloody kill him.

555
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,800
What?

556
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,550
Who was that?

557
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,180
- Well. I told you. It was
his girlfriend. - Shush.

558
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,760
I've been invited to tea.

559
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,520
With who?

560
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,270
The President.

561
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,460
The President of SA Rugby?

562
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,890
Count your fingers after he shakes
your hand, boy.

563
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,440
The President.

564
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,640
He wants me over for tea,
week after next.

565
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,400
Mr. Francois---

566
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,250
you must tell Madiba that
the bus service is very bad,

567
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,670
and too expensive.

568
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,810
He must do something about it.

569
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,660
- Good night everybody.
- Good night, Eunice.

570
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,330
Thank you.

571
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,030
What the hell does he want with you?

572
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,310
I don't know.

573
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,460
<i>What?</i>

574
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,510
Francois, relax. You've met him before.

575
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,720
I shook his hand on the rugby field.

576
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,610
And you didn't even vote.

577
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,310
Come on, Nerine.
He's still the President.

578
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,680
I play rugby. What am I going to say
to the guy?

579
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:14,180
Say to him, thank you for inviting
me.

580
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,560
What if I pull something stupid in
front of him?

581
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,410
You won't, okay? I'll pick you up
right here.

582
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,330
- Bye.
- Mr. Francois...

583
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,250
Francois, a picture please!

584
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,390
Yeah. Okay. Over here. Okay?

585
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,350
Mr. Pienaar... Mr. Pienaar...

586
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,030
Come on, guys.

587
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,180
See who's coming for tea?

588
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,490
My nephew wants me to get his
autograph.

589
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,730
Who?

590
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,440
Francois Pienaar.

591
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,810
Who wants to escort him in?

592
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,030
- Hey. No autographs, okay?
- I know how to do my job, okay?

593
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,630
Who's this Francois Pienaar?

594
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,310
You can't be serious? He's the captain
of the Springboks.

595
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,420
I like soccer, myself.

596
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,470
Well, you know what they say about
soccer---

597
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,890
It's gentleman's game played by
hooligans.

598
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,720
One the other hand, rugby's a hooligan's
game played by gentlemen.

599
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,120
Ja, ja, I've heard that one before.

600
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,490
It wasn't funny the first time.

601
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,210
Can I ask you a question, Lieutenant?

602
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,760
Yeah, of course.

603
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,700
What's he like?

604
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,860
When I worked for the previous President,
it was my job to be invisible.

605
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,740
This President--- when he found out
I like English toffee

606
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:41,940
he brought me some back from his
visit in England.

607
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,020
To him, no one's invisible.

608
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,520
That's where you wait. One of his
assistants will come for you.

609
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,160
And the bathroom's over there,
if you need it.

610
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,710
Okay. Thanks.

611
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,400
What are our chances in the World Cup?

612
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,950
I mean, for real.

613
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,490
We'll do our best.
That, I can guarantee.

614
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,180
<i>Office of the President.</i>

615
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,840
So, what is he like?

616
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,620
Well, he's not as big as he looks on TV.

617
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:25,060
And we don't stand a bloody chance in
the World Cup.

618
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,690
Mr. Pienaar?

619
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,540
Right this way please.

620
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,980
Go in.

621
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,190
Francois,

622
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,550
what an honor.

623
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,120
I'm so excited.

624
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,990
Thank you for coming all this way to
see me.

625
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,070
Yes, sir. Thank you for inviting me,
Mr. President.

626
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,860
So, tell me Francois, how's your
ankle?

627
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,920
My ankle?

628
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,720
I was told it was hurt.

629
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,740
Has it healed?

630
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:11,230
The truth is, sir, you never really play
at a hundred percent, no matter what.

631
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,880
Ah. Yes.

632
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,960
In sports, as in life, yes?

633
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:15,760
Yes sir.

634
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,310
Ah. Please, sit.

635
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,870
Take this one.

636
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,610
Looking into the light hurts my
eyes.

637
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,070
Mrs. Brits,

638
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,720
you are a shining light in my day.

639
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,440
Yes sir.

640
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,740
Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar,
captain of the Springboks.

641
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,420
- Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits.
- Aangename kennis.

642
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,270
Shall I pour, sir?

643
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,140
No. No. I'd prefer to do it myself.

644
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,770
Thank you very much, Mrs. Brits.

645
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,840
How do you like your tea, Francois?

646
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,660
Just milk, please.

647
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,090
The English have given us many things,
including rugby,

648
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:06,270
but afternoon tea, that is the greatest.

649
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,300
"Alien."

650
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,710
Thank you, sir.

651
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,230
You have a very difficult job.

652
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,830
I do?

653
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,220
I have a trading business.

654
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,170
Captain of the Springboks.

655
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,770
A very difficult job.

656
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,290
Not compared to yours, Mr. President.

657
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,750
Well, no one's trying to tear my
head off while I'm doing mine.

658
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,380
Yes, sir.

659
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,940
Tell me Francois,

660
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,940
what is your philosophy on leadership.

661
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:46,320
How do you inspire your team to do
their best?

662
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,940
By example. I've always taught to
lead by example, sir.

663
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,480
Well. That is right.

664
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,360
That is exactly right.

665
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,820
But how to get them to be better than
they think they can be?

666
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,200
That is very difficult, I find.

667
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,110
Inspiration, perhaps.

668
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,210
How do we inspire ourselves to
greatness,

669
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,370
when nothing less will do?

670
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,770
How do we inspire everyone around us?

671
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:21,000
I sometimes think, it's just by using
the work of others.

672
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,880
On Robben Island,

673
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,310
when things got very bad,

674
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:32,530
I found inspiration in a poem.

675
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,480
A poem?

676
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,100
A Victorian poem.

677
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,530
Just words.

678
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,730
But they helped me to stand, when
all I wanted to do was to lie down.

679
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,720
But you didn't come all this way
to hear an old man

680
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,460
talk about things that make no sense.

681
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,380
No, no, please, Mr. President.

682
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,530
It makes complete sense to me.

683
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,910
On the day of a big match,
say a test,

684
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,250
in the bus on the way to the stadium,
nobody talks.

685
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,960
Ah. Yes.

686
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,440
They're all preparing.

687
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,940
Right.

688
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,260
But when I think we're ready,
I have the bus driver put on a song

689
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,850
something I've chosen, one we all
know.

690
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,730
And we listen to the words together

691
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:25,850
and it helps.

692
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:33,470
I remember when I was invited to the
1992 Olympics in Barcelona.

693
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,180
Everybody in the stadium greeted me
with a song.

694
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,680
At the time the future--- our future---
seemed very bleak.

695
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,900
But to hear that song, and the voices
of people from all over our planet

696
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:56,810
made me proud to be South African.

697
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,600
It inspired me to come home and do
better.

698
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,940
It allowed me to expect more of myself.

699
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,970
May I ask, what was the song, sir?

700
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,150
Well,

701
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,720
it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika.

702
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,850
A very inspiring song.

703
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,140
We need inspiration, Francois.

704
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,420
Because, in order to build our nation,

705
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:32,190
we must all exceed our own expectations.

706
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,070
So? What's he like?

707
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,250
He's not like anyone I've ever met
before.

708
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,300
Well? What did he want?

709
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,470
What did you talk about?
You talk about rugby?

710
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,320
What did you talk about?

711
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,880
Francois, it's like talking to a
brick wall. What did he say?

712
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,350
I think he wants us to win the World Cup.

713
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,680
Excuse me.

714
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,920
What do you think?

715
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,120
It doesn't matter what I think.

716
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,670
Yes, it does.

717
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,140
Okay.

718
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,020
I think he looks like one of the
policemen

719
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:56,270
who forced us out of our house
when you were in jail.

720
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:59,160
I don't like seeing you shake his hand.

721
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,070
And I'm not the only one.

722
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:08,540
You criticize without understanding.

723
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,050
You seek only to address your own
personal feelings.

724
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,770
That is selfish thinking, Zindzi.

725
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,600
It does not serve the nation.

726
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,340
Zindzi, wait, please.

727
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,580
Zindzi, I...

728
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,230
Here.

729
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,720
Give this to your mother for me, please.

730
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:38,960
What is it?

731
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,320
It's a bracelet I found unpacking.

732
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,080
Why don't you just throw it away?

733
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,530
I don't have the right, doesn't
belong to me

734
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,060
If she left it, she meant to throw it
away.

735
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,270
Mrs. Pienaar said you were finished with
the paper.

736
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,620
Ja. Of course.

737
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,850
- Let's go.
- Go. Go.

738
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,130
Hey!

739
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,810
Here we go.

740
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,370
Hit! Yes.

741
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:24,100
The World Cup is played every four
years.

742
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,170
Sixteen teams qualify from around the
world.

743
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,960
Four pools of four teams,

744
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,320
each playing in nine different
venues around the country.

745
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:37,450
Two teams will advance from each
pool to the quarter finals.

746
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,470
The Ivory Coast qualifies.

747
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,820
That's wonderful.

748
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:47,410
According to the experts, we'll reach
the quarter finals, and no further.

749
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,910
According to the experts, you and I
should still be in jail.

750
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,560
<i>You make a personal appearance in
the finals,</i>

751
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:02,440
<i>and at the opening match between
the Australia and the Springboks.</i>

752
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,890
The finals will be broadcast to over a
billion people around the world, live.

753
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,840
A billion people watching us!

754
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,050
This is a great opportunity.

755
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,470
I reckon you've knocked the stuffing
out of them today.

756
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,220
<i>And now! Come on, boys.</i>

757
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,920
I haven't even begun.

758
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,770
<i>All right. And now...</i>

759
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,970
We may not be the most talented team
in the world...

760
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,670
but sure is we're going to be the
fittest.

761
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,600
- Let's go again, guys.
- Come on, boys.

762
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,680
- Brenda.
- Yes, sir.

763
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,870
Please get the head of South African
rugby for me.

764
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,770
- Right away.
- Thank you.

765
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,840
Yes. Come on.

766
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:02,140
Guys, listen up! Dr. Ledges wants
a few  words, please.

767
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,840
Afternoon men.

768
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,830
Good to see you all working so hard.

769
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,220
I have a short announcement.

770
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:15,070
As part of the PR buildup to the
World Cup,

771
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,270
you will be conducting coaching clinics
in townships all over the country.

772
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,680
I know, I know, you have plenty on
your plates already---

773
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,450
but this is a request from the top.

774
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,800
The very top.

775
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,250
Thank you.

776
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,260
This is complete crap, man.

777
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:44,460
What is this, huh? Are we some sort
of circus act now?

778
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,310
We didn't talk about shit like this.

779
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,340
They expect us to play our best,
to give our bloody all,

780
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,460
then they add to our bloody
workload...

781
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,700
He's right.

782
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,250
What do you think about this, Chester?

783
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,500
I try not to think. 'Cause it interferes
with my rugby.

784
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,750
See! Now there's a rugby player.

785
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:04,720
Talk to them, cappie.

786
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,160
You gotta make them understand
we just don't have the time for this.

787
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,780
Ja.

788
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,470
I'm not going to talk to them.

789
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,020
Why not?

790
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:16,650
We've become more then just a rugby
team.

791
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,100
And we might as well get used to it.

792
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,190
Is this you speaking, or Mandela?

793
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:25,980
<i>Yeah, exactly, huh?</i>

794
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:28,080
You know me better than that.

795
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,350
You know, times change.

796
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,070
And we need to change as well.

797
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,670
<i>Oh, that's great.</i>

798
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:18,000
Shit.

799
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,100
Ja.

800
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,110
I'm glad I don't live here.

801
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:43,910
Don't forget, we've got cameras on
us at all times.

802
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,530
What a bloody joke.

803
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:52,690
"CHESTER CHESTER CHESTER"

804
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,910
Chester--- I reckon you're up.

805
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,450
- What am I supposed to do?
- What you do best.

806
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,000
Let rip.

807
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,600
Who wants to play rugby?

808
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,600
Who here knows the first rule of
rugby?

809
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:32,490
Me.

810
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:36,340
- What is it? - You hit another
players when the Raf isn't looking!

811
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,380
No, no, no. The first rule of rugby

812
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,550
is you can only pass the ball
backwards or sideways.

813
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,180
All right? Do we practise that?

814
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,380
- "Ja"
- All right. Form a line.

815
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,640
Let's go, boys. Here we go.

816
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:50,470
Get ready.

817
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,750
Keep your hands up.

818
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,040
Okay.

819
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,700
Like this, like this.

820
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:06,030
I'm here so I make it like this.

821
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,610
Now, you run.

822
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:15,110
There you go.

823
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,420
...and then catch it. Right.

824
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,440
So, I want you in groups of three,
okay?

825
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,460
All right. One, two, three!

826
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,360
...and in addition to the nationwide
PR campaign,

827
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,880
we propose that all retail outlets
charge

828
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:29,080
a nominal fee for plastic bags.

829
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:32,540
We believe that this will generate---
- Ah. Excuse me.

830
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:36,580
Mr. Minister, if you'll forgive me.
This all sound excellent,

831
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,700
and we will return to it, but...

832
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,700
if you'll indulge me for just one
more minute---

833
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:47,330
<i>Well. Soccer is usually their favorite
sport here. But things changed today.</i>

834
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:52,170
<i>When a group of local kids really took to
the Springboks in a surprise visit...</i>

835
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,240
<i>...Francois Pienaar...</i>

836
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:55,590
You see that,

837
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,050
that picture is worth any number of
speeches.

838
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:26,290
This is Johan De Villiers reporting Live
from Cape Town airport

839
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,020
where the Springboks' flight has
just landed. - Okay. - Thank you.

840
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:32,300
<i>The green and gold have just one week to
put the finishing touches</i>

841
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,570
<i>to their gruelling training program</i>

842
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,140
and I, for one, must admit to being

843
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:39,070
cautiously optimistic.

844
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,580
I say cautiously, because in my
humble opinion

845
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:48,090
this Springbok team has been
over-practised on the field,

846
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,180
and over-committed off it.

847
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,720
<i>Which makes beating a powerhouse
Australian side</i>

848
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:56,460
<i>in next week's Cup opener a tall
order,</i>

849
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:59,400
<i>especially as this is
an inexperienced team</i>

850
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,580
<i>with a history of coming up short in
big matches.</i>

851
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,180
<i>This is Johan de Villiers, Live in
Cape Town,</i>

852
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,980
<i>returning you to the studio in
Johannesburg.</i>

853
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,560
<i>Thanks Johan. The update---</i>

854
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:11,910
Around the world--- objectively---

855
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:16,370
what are they saying about our
chances to beat Australia?

856
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,370
Everyone thinks they'll beat us.

857
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:22,150
And if they do, we'll have to go
through England and the All Blacks

858
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,050
just to get to the Final.

859
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,170
So it is very important that we beat
Australia.

860
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,460
Thank you.

861
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,160
Madiba, the Cabinet Ministers are here
to brief you on the trip to Taiwan.

862
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:50,610
Oh, yes.

863
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,120
- I'll be right out.
- Thank you, sir.

864
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,040
¶ Matters not the circumstance ¶

865
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:11,700
¶ We rise above, take a chance ¶

866
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,475
¶ I thank whatever ¶

867
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,920
¶ Whatever gods may be ¶

868
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:23,070
¶ 9,000 days were set aside¶

869
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,690
¶ 9,000 days of destiny ¶

870
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,650
¶ 9,000 days to thank gods ¶

871
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,600
¶ Wherever they may be ¶

872
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,100
One week, boys.

873
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,460
We want snipers on top of the stadium
and the surrounding buildings here.

874
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:54,750
No problem.

875
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,830
We want those two approaches
completely sanitized.

876
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,920
Two approaches?

877
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:02,740
We're not going to decide which way
he comes in until the very last moment.

878
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:07,210
We want uniforms, plain clothes,
sharp-shooters...

879
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,330
And sniffer dogs.

880
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,580
And if you need more men,
we have an army unit for you

881
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,480
on standby at Silvermine.

882
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:16,390
We're not going to take chances,
gentlemen.

883
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,840
The President's going to be exposed.

884
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,310
Much too exposed.

885
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,930
Brenda...

886
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:37,150
...I have been studying.

887
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:40,310
For the summit in Taiwan? Good.

888
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,130
No. Not exactly.

889
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,530
Test me.

890
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,020
They look like thugs.

891
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,600
Block out their names.

892
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:53,050
See if I can recognize them.

893
01:04:58,210 --> 01:04:59,780
Andre Joubert.

894
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,780
Gavin Johnson.

895
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,300
Did I get them right?

896
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:05,850
Yes, Madiba.

897
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:09,590
That's the way I used to study in
law school.

898
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:11,850
Unfortunately,

899
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,910
Chester is far too easy to identify.

900
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,650
But that will change.

901
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,970
It must.

902
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,300
- Go.
- Go. Go. Go.

903
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,810
Team meeting. After dinner.

904
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,700
C'mon, Springboks!

905
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,750
Round. Gather round.

906
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,740
- Pass it away.
- What's this Francois? Homework?

907
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,290
Ja, ja.

908
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,590
Make sure everyone has got one.

909
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,200
What is this?

910
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,170
We need to learn this song.

911
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,650
We can't just mouth the words
anymore.

912
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,100
Nobody cares, as long as we're
winning the matches.

913
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:10,100
You're wrong. They do care.

914
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:12,560
It's their bloody song, not ours.

915
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,540
Flippin' terrorist song, man.

916
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,460
Yeah, they used to arrest you for
singing it.

917
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,540
Right, and now it's one of our
anthems.

918
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:21,340
I can't even read it or pronounce
the words.

919
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,080
All right, guys. It's optional.

920
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,880
Take it if you want to.

921
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,920
It means "God Bless Africa".

922
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,330
Which you have to admit, we could
use.

923
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:59,730
Tell us, Mr. President, have you
always been a rugby fan?

924
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:06,150
People do not realize that I played
rugby myself,

925
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,800
when I was a student at Fort Hare.

926
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,360
It is a very rough game.

927
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,710
Almost as rough as politics.

928
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:18,290
How do you think the Springboks
will do?

929
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,490
I think they will do very well.

930
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,480
Their level of commitment is tremendous.

931
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,980
Now, it's been said that you used to
support any team

932
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,310
that played against the Springboks.

933
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,160
Yes, well, obviously, that is no
longer true.

934
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,230
I am one hundred percent behind our
boys.

935
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:41,390
After all, if I cannot change
when circumstances demand it,

936
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,400
how can I expect others to?

937
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,310
¶ And it's not just a game ¶

938
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,810
¶ You can't throw me away ¶

939
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,860
¶ I put all I had on the line ¶

940
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,840
¶ And I give and you take ¶

941
01:07:57,970 --> 01:08:00,740
¶ And I played the high stakes ¶

942
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,660
¶ I've won and I've lost ¶

943
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,840
¶ But, I'm fine ¶

944
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:09,420
¶ Hear me say I'll wise up 'til the end ¶

945
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:14,440
¶ Hear me say I'll stand up for my
friends ¶

946
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,880
¶ And I crash to the ground ¶

947
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:19,800
¶ And it's just my own sound ¶

948
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,790
¶ I drop in the blink of an eye ¶

949
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:30,720
¶ I'm colorblind ¶

950
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,090
- Francois.
- Welcome Mr. President.

951
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,640
Gentlemen...

952
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,370
forgive me for interrupting your
work

953
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,160
the day before such an important
match,

954
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:51,450
but I just wanted to come and wish
you good luck, in person.

955
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,810
Sometimes, very seldom, as President,

956
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:58,050
I am allowed to do what I want.

957
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:01,140
Mr. President, this is---

958
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:03,380
Oh, I know, who this is.

959
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,690
- Andre, good luck.
- Pleased to meet you. Thank you, sir.

960
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,640
Brendan, good luck to you.

961
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,790
- Kevin, good luck.
- Thank you.

962
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,290
- James.
- Mr. President.

963
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:14,450
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

964
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,890
- Japie
- Thank you, sir.

965
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,440
Good luck.

966
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,460
Did you ever imagine this?

967
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,550
Good luck.

968
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,100
How could I?

969
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,510
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Mr. President.

970
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,360
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

971
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,700
Good luck to you.

972
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,610
Good luck.

973
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:33,160
Good luck, son.

974
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,080
Good luck. Hennie...

975
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,460
- ...Good luck.
- Thank you.

976
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:40,930
But where is Chester?

977
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:47,420
He's injured, sir. His hamstring.
We're trying to keep it quiet.

978
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:51,670
Well, will he be out for the entire
tournament?

979
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:55,350
With hamstrings, who knows?

980
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,270
We'll miss him.

981
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,920
The whole country will miss him.

982
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:04,020
- Well, gentlemen...
- Mr. President, sir---

983
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:06,720
- Yes, Hennie.
- This is for you. From us.

984
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:16,690
I'm honored, gentlemen. Truly
honored.

985
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:23,700
And you must know that your country
supports you, completely.

986
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,090
- Good luck to you all.
- "Thank you, sir"

987
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,890
Francois, walk with me.

988
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:35,040
I have something for you.

989
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:41,200
It has helped me through the years.

990
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:43,540
I hope, it helps you.

991
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,390
Thank you, Mr. President.

992
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,020
Thank you.

993
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,430
It's time for bed, Tata.

994
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,130
I'm going to stay up awhile.

995
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:07,200
The country is excited tonight.

996
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,600
You need to sleep. The doctor said.

997
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,520
The doctor has no sense of occasion.

998
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,560
<i>...and the good result here today...</i>

999
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:29,390
<i>...black and gold...</i>

1000
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,510
<i>It's over!</i>

1001
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:56,500
- Thank you.
- Hey.

1002
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:00,530
You know what's the best thing about
you being the captain?

1003
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,180
- The honor?
- No.

1004
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,450
You don't have to share a room.

1005
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,870
Nerine... No, I can't... I can't...

1006
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,810
- Come on, Francois. It's been weeks.
-  I can't. I need to be really angry.

1007
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:11,810
I know, it's working. I need to be
angry tomorrow.

1008
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,860
- What is this?
- A poem.

1009
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:18,190
From President. - How does a poem
help you play rugby?

1010
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,890
The same way your visit does.
Inspiration.

1011
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:59,120
All right. Come on. With you.

1012
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:08,810
- What happened?
- We scored.

1013
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,790
Come on.

1014
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,560
Go!

1015
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:11,600
We won.

1016
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,320
We did?

1017
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,340
- Very good.
- That was beautiful, Tata.

1018
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:44,640
- What do you say to this?
- Well. That was fantastic!

1019
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:07,170
You must be very happy!

1020
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:11,890
Any man would be happy to be dancing
with a beautiful lady like you.

1021
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:15,580
Mr. President, you're exaggerating.

1022
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:17,130
Not at all.

1023
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:21,290
My father was a Xhosa,
so he was a polygamist.

1024
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,930
As you know, I am not.

1025
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:29,150
But when I look at you...
I envy my father.

1026
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:15,300
"Say, one, two, three, four! Hey!"

1027
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:24,500
Coach's run, six a.m.

1028
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,410
- What?
- Pass it on.

1029
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,080
Coach's run, six a.m.

1030
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,140
Six.

1031
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,990
Drink up.

1032
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:39,070
Joe. Coach's run, six, six a.m.

1033
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:21,140
Hey, guys. I hope you're not going
to be this slow next week.

1034
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:23,800
- Hi. - I like to see you.
- Cappie? What's going on?

1035
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:25,370
A change of pace. Come.

1036
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,720
- Bloody boy!
- There you go. Good.

1037
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:28,970
Come.

1038
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:31,470
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

1039
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,940
That's what they used to do, smuggle
gravel in from the yard

1040
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:19,680
throw it across the floor so they
could hear the wardens come in

1041
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,030
Oh, wow.

1042
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,050
- Can we see the President's cell?
- Yes, of course.

1043
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,140
Wow. Can you believe this?

1044
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,940
Now, the number on the door...

1045
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:39,310
46664 means, he was the 466th prisoner
to be intend here in 1964.

1046
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:43,300
We've done it up just the way it was.

1047
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:52,530
Come with me.

1048
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:32,450
"Out of the night that covers me,"

1049
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,640
"Black as the pit from pole to pole,"

1050
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:40,280
"I thank whatever gods may be"

1051
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:44,170
" For my unconquerable soul."

1052
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,800
"In the fell clutch of circumstance"

1053
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:52,330
"I have not winced nor cried aloud."

1054
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,020
"Under the bludgeonings of chance"

1055
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:00,900
"My head is bloody, but unbow'd."

1056
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:05,940
"Beyond this place of wrath and tears"

1057
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:09,430
"Looms but the Horror of the shade,"

1058
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:18,010
"And yet the menace of the years"

1059
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:24,250
"Finds and shall find me unafraid."

1060
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,330
"It matters not how strait the gate,"

1061
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,550
"How charged with punishment the scroll,"

1062
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:37,170
"I am the master of my fate:"

1063
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,610
"I am the captain of my soul."

1064
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,980
Look at that.

1065
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,040
Tata? Madiba?

1066
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:21,260
Sir?

1067
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,860
What happened?

1068
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,580
It's simple exhaustion, but it'll lead
to worse if it's not treated.

1069
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,480
He needs a complete rest.

1070
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:38,660
And I don't mean just simply shifting
the affairs of state to his bedroom.

1071
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:41,250
No phone calls, no visitors,
no meetings. No politics.

1072
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,320
You know him. He won't do that.

1073
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:45,460
Then I'm going to put him into
hospital. In isolation.

1074
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:48,740
No. Not yet. I'll threaten him with
hospital if he doesn't behave.

1075
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,040
I'll cancel everything.

1076
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:53,490
And I'll come back tonight to make
sure he's not waking.

1077
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:59,060
Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan.
Not yet.

1078
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,090
What was that mean?

1079
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,360
Chester's back.

1080
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,540
<i>All right. All right. That's enough.
All right.</i>

1081
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,650
Madiba, this is the delegation---

1082
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:14,740
I know who this is.

1083
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:16,700
Welcome.

1084
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:19,910
Thank you for coming so far to see me.
- Thank you. How do you do?

1085
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,960
- I'm fine. Welcome.
- Thank you very much.

1086
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:25,450
<i>Ladies and gentlemen please
apologize. The game is delayed.</i>

1087
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:29,160
<i>...in the semifinals, South Africa
against France...</i>

1088
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:36,140
- This is it. Let's go.
- All right. Go.

1089
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:27,390
<i>...International business alliances.</i>

1090
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,750
<i>Strong industries have developed in
shipping and computers</i>

1091
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:32,340
<i>Our information...</i>

1092
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,890
Please, excuse me.

1093
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:36,190
<i>Yes, Mr. President, of course.</i>

1094
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:42,450
<i>Gentlemen, let us continue  in ten
minutes...</i>

1095
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,380
This is good. Very good!

1096
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:50,200
So, who is our next opponent?

1097
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:53,670
The All Blacks play England tomorrow.
Then, we'll know.

1098
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,860
I see.

1099
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:59,050
You will make sure that my schedule
is free for the entire match.

1100
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,770
Oh, yes, Tata.

1101
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:03,460
This is good. This is very good.

1102
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:25,750
<i>...black team mates come to
congratulate big fella yet again.</i>

1103
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:28,760
<i>Lomu is becoming one of the most
intimidating...</i>

1104
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:31,710
Why don't we do a little work while
we're here.

1105
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:35,470
Just enjoy the rugby.

1106
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:38,460
<i>...World Cup semifinal against
England.</i>

1107
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,200
So, let me understand this.

1108
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:46,110
The All Blacks are killing a team
that thrashed us last year?

1109
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,960
Thanks for reminding me.

1110
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,400
Yet again.

1111
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:57,150
We're gonna really have to tackle
a lot better than the English are.

1112
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,500
- Yeah. That's sure.
- That's sure.

1113
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:59,800
- We do.
- Ja.

1114
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:02,540
<i>That is Lomu's second try this
afternoon.</i>

1115
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,060
<i>This guy really likes scoring tries
against the English...</i>

1116
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:09,410
Are those the judicial appointments
for the Free State?

1117
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:12,500
They'll keep until after the match.

1118
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:16,310
<i>Here's the kick.</i>

1119
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,280
I'm the President, you know.

1120
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,020
<i>And the conversion is good!</i>

1121
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,540
Are you watching this guy?
He's about your size, but...

1122
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,840
How much does this Lomu weigh?

1123
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,880
- 120 kilos.
- Shit.

1124
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:35,380
- Same as me.
- Yeah., but you're slow.

1125
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,430
Lomu looks for contact every time
he gets the ball.

1126
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,190
Ja.

1127
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,250
It's good for us.

1128
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,110
Ja.

1129
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:46,380
I will break my arm,
my leg, my neck,

1130
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,650
but I will not let that frickin' guy
go.

1131
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,900
With you, cappie.

1132
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:53,000
- With you, captain.
- With you, cappie. With you.

1133
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,770
...when you pass it, yeah? Grab this.

1134
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,040
Run!

1135
01:28:08,410 --> 01:28:09,380
Yes.

1136
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,140
Still think I'm wasting my time with
the rugby?

1137
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:26,420
<i>...he's in the clear and he will...</i>

1138
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:30,070
Brenda, please tell the Minister
of Sport

1139
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:33,160
I'd like the full report on
the All Blacks.

1140
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:37,940
This rugby, it's still strictly
political?

1141
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:39,890
Oh yes. Oh yes. Of course.

1142
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,260
Hello, Francois.

1143
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,810
Don't lose them. I won't be able
to get more.

1144
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:58,310
Thanks, Francois.

1145
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:02,190
Me, mom, Nerine--- wait,

1146
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:04,220
and the fourth?

1147
01:29:04,490 --> 01:29:05,740
Who's it for?

1148
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:27,790
The All Blacks beat Ireland 43 to 19.

1149
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:29,240
I see.

1150
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,550
They beat Wales 34 to 9.

1151
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:32,960
I see.

1152
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:36,270
They beat Japan 145 to 17.

1153
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,010
145 points, in one match?

1154
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:42,540
It's a new international record.

1155
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:46,430
They beat Scotland 48 to 30 in the
quarter finals.

1156
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,670
You saw the match with England.

1157
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,590
Yes.

1158
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:54,190
45 to 29. And it was not that close.

1159
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:58,080
They seem unstoppable.

1160
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:02,860
If the opposing teams play them
straight up, Jonah Lomu runs wild.

1161
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:05,960
If they focus on Lomu, that leaves
others free.

1162
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:08,960
And, also, there's the business of
the haka.

1163
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,990
A Maori war dance. Yes.

1164
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:13,240
It's very powerful.

1165
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,550
My sources tell me that half of the
All Black matches

1166
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,550
are won before the first whistle,
because of it.

1167
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,250
How can we beat them?

1168
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,720
I have the coach's number.
Maybe, you could call him and ask.

1169
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:33,710
No. no. I don't want to distract
their focus, even for one minute.

1170
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,120
But, how can we win?

1171
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:41,610
Maybe we won't. They're favored
two-to-one.

1172
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:46,730
Madiba, we've already exceeded all
expectations. On and off the field.

1173
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:51,520
It's not enough. Not now.
Not so close.

1174
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:56,890
This country is hungry for greatness.

1175
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,140
I brought one of your mom's protein
shakes.

1176
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:27,340
Thinking about tomorrow?

1177
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:28,930
No,

1178
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,090
tomorrow's taken care of,

1179
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:34,640
one way or another.

1180
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:41,050
I'm was thinking about how you
spend 30 years in a tiny cell,

1181
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,260
and come out ready to forgive
the people who put you there.

1182
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:58,720
Go home, man. There's nothing more
you can do today.

1183
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:06,170
Have I ever mentioned to you that
I hate rugby?

1184
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:08,450
Once or twice, yes.

1185
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:14,190
I just want to get him through
tomorrow, safely.

1186
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:15,840
That's all.

1187
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:17,450
We all do.

1188
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:47,710
The tickets sold out long before
the team became popular.

1189
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:52,090
it's not exactly going to be the
rainbow nation out there.

1190
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,830
And that's the reality.

1191
01:32:55,460 --> 01:33:00,180
Now, all it takes is one idiot
trying to make a statement,

1192
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:05,350
or one fool who thinks that he hears
god speaking to him through the radio.

1193
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,970
It's happened before!

1194
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,660
But not today.

1195
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,690
Not on our watch.

1196
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:13,450
And not today.

1197
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:56,130
Hey. Flag face. Flag face.

1198
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:58,030
- Flag face?
- Bugger off!

1199
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:07,070
We're at Ellis Park on this historic
day,

1200
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:12,300
where, even this early, crowd
expectation is at fever pitch...

1201
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:16,100
<i>because their beloved green and gold</i>

1202
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:19,920
<i>have somehow managed to defy all
expectations.</i>

1203
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:25,030
<i>But now they come up against a team
unlike any they have played before.</i>

1204
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:30,790
<i>These All Blacks are possibly one of
the greatest international sides ever,</i>

1205
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:35,405
<i>with a player in Jonah Lomu
who is as dominant as any</i>

1206
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,890
<i>this correspondent has ever seen.</i>

1207
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:52,030
Madiba!

1208
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:46,130
Final approach, Captain.

1209
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:51,280
Let it be noted that I'm taking
control of the aircraft.

1210
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:52,830
Duly noted.

1211
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:57,450
I take full responsibility for what
happens from now on.

1212
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,250
Do you see that jet, to the east?

1213
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:23,920
<i>Did they get clearance for this?</i>

1214
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:25,470
Not from us.

1215
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:29,740
Where is he?

1216
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,460
<i>VIP box.</i>

1217
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,700
Get him out of there. Now.

1218
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:35,590
No time.

1219
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:02,960
What the hell was that?

1220
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,380
- Boka!
- Yeah.

1221
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:49,330
Come on!

1222
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:28,960
<i>...World Cup Finals.</i>

1223
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,330
<i>Please welcome the South African
Springboks!</i>

1224
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,860
<i>And New Zealand; All blacks.</i>

1225
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:44,850
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome</i>

1226
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:48,060
<i>The President of the Republic of
South Africa</i>

1227
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:51,260
<i>Mr. Nelson Mandela.</i>

1228
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:03,730
<i>Dr. Nelson Mandela, the President of
South Africa</i>

1229
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:07,030
<i>in the rugby jersey with the number
six on its back...</i>

1230
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:09,860
The All Black's won't like it.

1231
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:15,320
Francois, your country is very
proud of you.

1232
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:17,000
Thank you, sir.

1233
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:18,860
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1234
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:22,000
- ...Mr. President.
- Mr. President. Thank you.

1235
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:23,800
Good luck to you, son.

1236
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:26,580
Good luck to you, son.

1237
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:33,840
<i>Both teams are out there with
Dr. Mandela.</i>

1238
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:39,660
Chester, I want you to know that
your whole country is supporting you.

1239
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:42,030
- Good luck.
- Thank  you, sir.

1240
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:44,230
- Good luck, son.
- Thank you.

1241
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,160
<i>What a dramatic moment here in
Ellis park.</i>

1242
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:49,660
<i>I don't think I've ever seen so many
flags in one stadium.</i>

1243
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,620
- Hi.
- Their captain.

1244
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:02,300
I'm honored, sir.

1245
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:07,360
Mr. President...

1246
01:41:07,410 --> 01:41:09,280
- Yonah?
- Yes. Jonah, sir.

1247
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:10,880
- Nice to see you.
- Yes. Thank you.

1248
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:12,880
I'm a little afraid of you.

1249
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:15,090
<i>...and that's big Jonah Lomu.</i>

1250
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:16,640
<i>A big day for him.</i>

1251
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:20,960
- We're all together now.
- Yes.

1252
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:22,110
Good luck.

1253
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:26,220
"Nelson... Nelson... Nelson..."

1254
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,240
"NELSON... NELSON... NELSON..."

1255
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:39,620
<i>...Dr. Mandela just lifting his cap
to the sixty-two thousand people....</i>

1256
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:42,310
"Nelson... Nelson... Nelson..."

1257
01:41:55,523 --> 01:41:58,071
...wonderful aerial shot of...

1258
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:00,310
<i>...Ellis Park Stadium...</i>

1259
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,340
<i>Very emotional moment for both
teams.</i>

1260
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:30,160
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the national
anthem of South Africa.</i>

1261
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:34,200
<i>South African National Anthems.</i>

1262
01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:08,700
<i>What an unbelievable spectacular
year in Johannesburg.</i>

1263
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:24,630
Perhaps we should make a little
wager.

1264
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,730
All your gold, for all our sheep?

1265
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:35,100
Well I was thinking more along the
lines of a case of wine.

1266
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,750
<i>The celebration's over. We now come
to the big game.</i>

1267
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:44,590
<i>And we'll wait the Haka of
New Zealand.</i>

1268
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:46,750
¶ Kia rite! ¶

1269
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:50,680
¶ Kia rite! ¶

1270
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:53,420
¶ Kia rite! ¶

1271
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,300
¶ Kia mau! ¶

1272
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:56,720
¶ Hi! ¶

1273
01:44:58,570 --> 01:45:00,510
¶ Ringa ringa pakia ¶

1274
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:04,740
¶ Waewae takahia kia kino nei hoki! ¶

1275
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,840
¶ A kia kino nei hoki! ¶

1276
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:11,150
¶ A Ka Mate! Ka Mate! Ka Ora! ¶

1277
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:14,130
¶ A Ka Mate! Ka Mate! Ka Ora! ¶

1278
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,650
¶ A Ka Mate! Ka Mate! Puhuru huru ¶

1279
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:20,670
¶ Nana nei i tiki mai whakawhiti te ra ¶

1280
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:23,030
¶ A upane, ka upane ¶

1281
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:24,770
¶ A upane, ka upane ¶

1282
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:25,860
¶ Whiti te ra, ¶

1283
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:26,800
<i>¶ hi! ¶</i>

1284
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:31,250
<i>...that's the challenge, laid down by
the Maoris before going into battle...</i>

1285
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:57,180
<i>New Zealand as best team gets
in the final of the tournament.</i>

1286
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:24,510
- Hey! Get out of here.
- Hey!

1287
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,750
Put it down!

1288
01:46:36,031 --> 01:46:38,631
...knocked him down and stole the
ball...

1289
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:40,370
<i>...put into play by New Zealand.</i>

1290
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:43,370
<i>Now here's the chance for them on
the outside...</i>

1291
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:48,690
Engate.

1292
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:51,760
Right.

1293
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:02,440
Come, boys.

1294
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,550
What the heck are we doing?
Lomu is killing us.

1295
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:09,710
Forwards, we must start scrumming.

1296
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:12,330
We must disrupt them at the first
phase.

1297
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:14,290
We can't allow Lomu to get the ball
and space.

1298
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,020
He's frickin' killing us.

1299
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:20,680
But listen, if Lomu gets the ball,
whoever is there... James, Joost...

1300
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:24,200
Hit the fucking guy. Hold on to him.
Hold it.

1301
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:26,670
Help will come. Help will be there.

1302
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:35,440
<i>...the big Jonah Lomu and give
him some time and space...</i>

1303
01:47:59,330 --> 01:48:00,280
Oh! No!

1304
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:15,280
<i>...most of the opportunities have
gone New Zealand's way...</i>

1305
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:16,480
Go. Go. Go!

1306
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:34,450
Listen up. Captain...

1307
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:48,750
<i>...first blood to New Zealand...</i>

1308
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,760
Empty. Thirty four.

1309
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:06,760
<i>...such an important kick for
New Zealand...</i>

1310
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:20,110
<i>... score now: New Zealand 6,
South Africa 3.</i>

1311
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,610
<i>...It's a great kick from...</i>

1312
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:27,110
<i>Thirteen minutes gone now. Six points to
three New Zealand beats South Africa.</i>

1313
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,400
Come on!

1314
01:50:50,570 --> 01:50:52,840
<i>...twenty-one minutes gone now...</i>

1315
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:18,750
<i>...South Africa goes into the lead
for the first time in the match...</i>

1316
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:25,280
<i>...advantage for South Africa 9:6...</i>

1317
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:02,600
<i>...attempt for New Zealand...</i>

1318
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:06,250
Boys. It's all right.

1319
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:40,940
<i>Unsuccessful kick. The score remains
9:9.</i>

1320
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:44,270
<i>...that's closing score nine point
all.</i>

1321
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:47,310
<i>And now, there will be a five
minutes' break.</i>

1322
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:51,660
<i>Twenty final minutes in the World Cup.
We're gonna have an extra time.</i>

1323
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:55,510
<i>Extra time.</i>

1324
01:52:57,130 --> 01:52:58,930
So, what does this mean?

1325
01:52:59,590 --> 01:53:01,590
Extra time. Twenty minutes.

1326
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:05,220
I don't think I can take it.

1327
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,800
<i>Oh, this will be a test of great
character,</i>

1328
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:10,550
<i>in these last twenty minutes of this
match.</i>

1329
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:14,520
Who's the fittest team on this field?

1330
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:17,320
Who's the fittest team on this field?

1331
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:40,380
Engate.

1332
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,710
Right.

1333
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:18,360
New Zealand 12, South Africa 9.

1334
01:54:23,330 --> 01:54:27,070
<i>xxx in reserve, because...
High, high above the crossbar.</i>

1335
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:44,240
<i>Penalty against green.</i>

1336
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:51,640
Francois...

1337
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:56,300
Too many guys off their feet.

1338
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:58,500
- Oh, yes.
- Speak to your team.

1339
01:54:58,910 --> 01:54:59,880
Okay.

1340
01:55:06,790 --> 01:55:07,840
Heads up!

1341
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:09,890
Look in my eyes.

1342
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:12,210
Do you hear?

1343
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:14,570
Listen to your country.

1344
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:16,410
Seven minutes.

1345
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:18,090
Seven minutes.

1346
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:20,040
Defense, defense, defense!

1347
01:55:20,210 --> 01:55:21,510
This is it!

1348
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:23,390
This is our destiny.

1349
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:24,920
Come on.

1350
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:26,950
- Come.
- Come on.

1351
01:55:30,730 --> 01:55:32,530
How long before the end?

1352
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:34,370
Seven minutes.

1353
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:42,080
<i>This will be the longest seven
minutes for both two teams.</i>

1354
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:44,270
<i>...can hear the big man coming...</i>

1355
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,540
Now!

1356
01:58:45,850 --> 01:58:47,670
<i>...has he got 'em?...</i>

1357
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:33,260
<i>...great play there...</i>

1358
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:54,530
Chester, will you lead us in
a prayer?

1359
02:01:55,290 --> 02:01:57,900
Thanks Lord, for getting us into
this final.

1360
02:01:57,950 --> 02:02:00,100
Thanks for no serious injuries.

1361
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:02,930
and most of all, thanks for the win,
amen.

1362
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:04,390
"Amen"

1363
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:14,110
Good game.

1364
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:41,510
Francois... a few words...

1365
02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:45,340
Great game, but you could've done it

1366
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:50,310
without the amazing support of 63,000
South Africans here today.

1367
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:54,000
Ja. We didn't have the support of
63,000 South Africans.

1368
02:03:54,270 --> 02:03:57,240
We had the support of 43 million
South Africans.

1369
02:04:12,710 --> 02:04:16,160
I want to thank you for what you
have done to our country.

1370
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:20,260
No, Mr. President, thank you for what
you have done for our country.

1371
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:58,450
- This route's too crowded.
- Change to route C.

1372
02:05:58,730 --> 02:05:59,700
Okay.

1373
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:03,230
It's no hurry.

1374
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:05,650
No hurry at all.

1375
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:10,130
Madiba says it's no need to hurry.

1376
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:24,000
"I thank whatever gods may be"

1377
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:26,950
"For my unconquerable soul."

1378
02:06:28,090 --> 02:06:30,230
"I am the master of my fate:"

1379
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,590
"I am the captain of my soul."
