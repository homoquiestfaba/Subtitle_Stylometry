1
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:19,533
well, now, it takes
more than a robin

2
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,787
to make the winter go

3
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:26,791
and it takes
two lips of fire

4
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:29,960
to melt away the snow

5
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:34,131
well, it takes
two hearts a-cookin'

6
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,301
to make a fire grow

7
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:39,469
and, baby

8
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:42,706
you've got what it takes

9
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:48,478
you know it takes
a lot of kissing

10
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:51,315
to make a romance sweet

11
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:55,652
ooh, it takes
a lot of lovin'

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,156
to make my life complete

13
00:00:59,224 --> 00:01:02,927
and it takes a lot of woman

14
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:06,530
to knock me off my feet

15
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:08,432
and, baby

16
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:12,002
you've got what it takes

17
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:17,774
I said hmm

18
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:24,781
uh-huh hmm

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,952
you know you've got
just what it takes

20
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,122
because it takes more
than an effort

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,959
to stay away from you

22
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:38,963
it'd take more
than a lifetime

23
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,466
to prove that I'll be true

24
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:46,470
but it takes
somebody special

25
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:49,473
to make me say I do

26
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,976
and, baby

27
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:55,212
you've got what it takes

28
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,643
<i>what's down there?</i>

29
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:29,778
Probably just whales, sir.

30
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:35,485
Take it down.
But, sir-

31
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:38,954
Take it down!
Yes, major marshall.

32
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,542
Uh, sir, isn't that your-

33
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:07,550
<i>Yeah. Beautiful,
isn't she?</i>

34
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,443
Daddy.

35
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:18,070
Major marshall.

36
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:24,777
Shit.

37
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,237
B44682, bradford.

38
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:55,908
B11567, hall.

39
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:58,294
Major.

40
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:03,749
Over here.

41
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,855
What the hell are you
gonna do about your wife?

42
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:11,857
Is the colonel concerned
about my wife, sir?

43
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:14,727
She's a disgrace to the army
and she's endangering your job.

44
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:19,231
My job, sir, is to evaluate
radiation hazards to united
states army personnel.

45
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:22,868
My wife's not enlisted.
Why doesn't the colonel concern
himself with the men who are...

46
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:25,004
Rather than the mammaries
of women who are not?

47
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:27,372
That's very close
to insubordination, marshall.

48
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,542
It'll be noted along
with all the other incidents.
Very good, sir.

49
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,331
Don't make any waves, marshall.
I don't like waves.
Very good, sir.

50
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:46,291
The guest officers
from nato are visiting, sir.

51
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:25,030
<i>caro, caro.</i>

52
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,099
Hello, baby.

53
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:32,537
This is yves.
Yves is from France.

54
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,707
This is my husband.

55
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:37,209
Bonjour, major.

56
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:40,713
<i>You have a very lovely home and
a very beautiful mademoiselle.</i>

57
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,783
Thank you. I'm glad you have
a chance to see the average
american housewife in action.

58
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:49,554
<i>Gentlemen, I think
we must go now and
prepare for dinner.</i>

59
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:52,057
<i>No, don't go.
Senorita.</i>

60
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,059
Make them stay.

61
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,461
Please stay.
Really, we must go.

62
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:59,998
<i>Bonsoir, monsieur.
Enchante.
Bonsoir.</i>

63
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:03,102
<i>Hasta la vista.
Hasta la vista.</i>

64
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:05,503
<i>Au revoir.
Ciao.
Auf wiedersehen.</i>

65
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:09,742
<i>Arrivederci.
Ciao. Au revoir.</i>

66
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,745
<i>Ciao.</i>

67
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:27,359
Why you want
to spoil my party?

68
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:30,863
You went too far today.
Half the people on this base
saw you at the beach.

69
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,531
Oh, jesus christ.

70
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,868
Brigitte bardot strips
for millions, she's a goddess.

71
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,203
I sunbathe topless
and I'm a scandal.

72
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,939
You're not brigitte
bardot, remember?

73
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:50,048
What's the matter?
I don't make you happy?

74
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,050
Come on, have a drink.
You'll feel better.

75
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:56,454
I'd feel better
if I didn't have to worry
about you screwing around.

76
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:01,160
I've been good
for two years.

77
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:04,062
That's not
what it seemed like
this afternoon.

78
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:12,171
I've got a severe
radiation leak on site.

79
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:15,340
The colonel is
looking for any excuse
to discredit me.

80
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,676
Ooh.

81
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:20,345
I sure gave him two good ones
today, didn't I?

82
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,414
Well, yes, you did.

83
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,419
<i>Where are the children?
At the cinema, mi amore.</i>

84
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:32,858
Well, pack up your
old kit bag, pal.
You're alabamy bound.

85
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:35,827
<i>Don't worry about it, bob.
I'm tired of paradise.</i>

86
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:38,530
You know, this transfer
didn't come out of nowhere.

87
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:42,367
Anawalt was not happy
you filed that report
with the a.E.C.

88
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:45,537
Neither was I,
but so it goes
in this man's army.

89
00:08:45,604 --> 00:08:49,708
Uh, carly's from somewhere
down south, isn't she?

90
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,710
Yes. Virginia.

91
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:55,214
Well, maybe she'd be
a little happier
closer to home.

92
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:59,117
She ran away from home, bob.
She likes paradise.

93
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,837
Mom will never make it.

94
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,740
Oh, yes,
of course she will.

95
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:26,078
It's her, daddy.

96
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,253
Well?

97
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:45,264
What do you think?

98
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:57,675
of course you'll make new
friends, honey. You always do.

99
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:59,677
As soon as we get there,
we'll go looking...

100
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:04,349
For the most beautiful
southern belle doll.

101
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:07,485
Maybe we'll find
a scarlet o'hara.

102
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:11,122
She's too old for dolls.
I am not.

103
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,392
Not everybody spends
every waking minute
buried in a book.

104
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:17,128
It's good to read.

105
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:21,632
Alex might just
wind up a famous writer
like her aunt gail.

106
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,768
<i>She's not famous.</i>

107
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:28,373
She writes obituaries
for her church bulletin.

108
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:48,993
you know, I got a good feeling
about fort matthews.

109
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:53,497
<i>I think we're going
to be very happy here.</i>

110
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:59,337
'cause I'm goin' to alabama
with a banjo on my knee

111
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:02,106
I don't think
I've got the words right.

112
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:06,610
camptown ladies
sing this song

113
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,280
do dah do dah

114
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:11,449
camptown race track's
five miles long

115
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,551
oh do dah day

116
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:16,654
g'wine to run all night

117
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:19,257
<i>g'wine to run all day</i>

118
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,626
bet my money
on a bobtailed nag

119
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:24,728
<i>Come on, girls.
oh, the do dah day</i>

120
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:29,200
No, not "all the do dah day."
it's "somebody bet on the bay."

121
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:35,273
g'wine to run all night
g'wine to run all day

122
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:39,543
bet my money on a bobtail nag
somebody bet on the bay

123
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:45,316
Come on, girls.
I wished I was
in the land of cotton

124
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:47,318
old times there
are not forgotten

125
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:50,888
look away, look away
look away

126
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:55,659
<i>dixieland</i>

127
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:59,330
I wished I was in dixie

128
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:01,299
away

129
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,103
The ball was
out of bounds.
I'll get it.

130
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,006
I said come in here right now.

131
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:48,212
God, what a dump.

132
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,652
Is this the best
we could do?

133
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:59,657
We have lived in worse,
and your mother has always
made it your home.

134
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:25,015
oh, they had cats.

135
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:31,656
We'll have this place
in "a" number one condition...

136
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,392
In no time at all.

137
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,462
Our own furniture
is not even gonna be here
for six weeks, hank.

138
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:40,364
What are we supposed
to do in the mean time?

139
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:45,636
Mom, why don't you come
and help us make the beds?

140
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:49,039
<i>no, you girls do it, okay?
You make the beds.</i>

141
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:53,877
<i>First dibs on beds.
It's yours.</i>

142
00:13:56,315 --> 00:14:00,751
Look at this, hank.
It's all clawed to bits,
like a-

143
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,754
People live like animals
and then they just leave
their shit behind them...

144
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,990
For everybody else
to take care of.
Honey, you're tired.

145
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,759
You're exhausted.
Why don't you lie down?

146
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:13,498
<i>In what? In a litter box
like some stray cat?
It's starting again.</i>

147
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,053
I'm not gonna live here, hank!
I hate this place!

148
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:22,273
Carly, cut it out.
You're a big girl. This
isn't the end of the world.

149
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:26,277
No, it's just the same goddamn
world we had in washington,

150
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:28,279
Only it's worse.

151
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:32,116
Look, everything that was
on the right is on the left.

152
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:36,454
Right and left
and right and left
and right and left!

153
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:40,791
Only it's worse
and we're all ten years older!

154
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:43,961
These rooms are smaller!

155
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,638
Get me out of here!

156
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:57,975
Carly, it's okay.
We were okay in germany.
We were okay in washington.

157
00:14:58,043 --> 00:15:00,077
We're gonna be okay
in alabama.

158
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:03,247
Don't talk to me so carefully.
I hate it when you
talk to me like this.

159
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:05,249
Stop it right now!
Stop it!
No!

160
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,918
No, I'm not
gonna live here!

161
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:11,322
I won't live
in this fleabag!

162
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:20,698
Carly!
Carly!

163
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,268
Where the hell
are you going?

164
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:29,207
Carly!

165
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:33,211
Get out of the jeep.

166
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:51,028
- God damn you!
I hate you!
- Carly!

167
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,031
I hate you. I hate you.

168
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:04,808
Well.
May I help you?

169
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:11,081
Eighteen years
of shitboxes and...

170
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:13,484
Packing and moving and...

171
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:18,222
New neighbors
and ugly bases and...

172
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,258
Now this cat piss.

173
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,862
Have you seen that place?

174
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:27,097
Are you okay, dear?

175
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:40,077
<i>You get out of here!
Don't worry about it.
I'll handle this.</i>

176
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:43,847
<i>- I hope so.
- Get him out of here.</i>

177
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:51,789
Carly.

178
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,293
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

179
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:03,301
- Don't you touch me.
- I wouldn't let
anybody hurt you.

180
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:07,004
<i>I can see it.</i>

181
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:12,409
I can see that radiation
just coming off of you.

182
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:18,681
No. No, you get your goddamn
contaminated hands off me.

183
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:22,419
Carly, do you trust me?

184
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,024
Do you think I know you?
Do you? Hmm?

185
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:30,027
Well, listen to me then.

186
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:34,431
You have nothing
to be afraid of.

187
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:40,537
Do you want to go home?

188
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,940
Hmm?

189
00:17:46,444 --> 00:17:49,712
So, come on.

190
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,049
Let's go home.

191
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,484
Come on.

192
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,120
Come on.

193
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:02,559
Come on.

194
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:21,244
The car.

195
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:36,193
<i>Is she okay?
What happened?</i>

196
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,530
Mom's fine.
She's... Tired.

197
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:43,266
She needs
a little rest,
that's all.

198
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:03,547
Do you still love me, daddy?

199
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:05,715
Mm-hmm.

200
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:07,784
Do you love me?
Oh, yeah.

201
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,786
Do you love me?
Yes.

202
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:11,788
Do you love me?
Yes, I do.

203
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:13,790
Do you love me?
Yes, yes.

204
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:17,394
Do you love me?
Oh, yeah. Yes.

205
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:20,397
She's got
to see somebody.

206
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:23,233
You can't keep
running after her
and playing baby-sitter.

207
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:25,569
Your mom's fine.
She's spirited,
she's energetic.

208
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:28,738
Sometimes she wears
herself out with all
the traveling and moving.

209
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:30,740
Don't worry about it.
I can handle your mom.

210
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:32,909
We can all handle
each other's problems.

211
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:36,313
Dad, we didn't move here
just because of the project
you're working on.

212
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:40,750
You don't know what project I'm
working on. That's classified.
You don't know a thing about it.

213
00:20:40,818 --> 00:20:44,254
Maybe you and mom want to live
in your own little world
of make-believe and secrets,

214
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:46,256
But we don't.

215
00:20:46,324 --> 00:20:50,594
Her famous aunt gail
we're always hearing about-
alex.

216
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:55,098
Well, you heard mom yesterday.
The most popular girl
in richmond?

217
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:59,436
<i>She grew up on a chicken
farm outside of norfolk.
She needs help.</i>

218
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:03,373
She needs help arranging
the furniture and unpacking
the suitcases, miss freud.

219
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:05,708
Sit down there.

220
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:09,946
The perfect pancake.
Perfect.

221
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:21,824
Girls, I know it's hard
on you, but your mother
loves you very much.

222
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,227
And I know you love her.

223
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:29,866
Through all the ups and downs
I've come to realize...

224
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:33,770
That what we call love
is really the exchange
of energy over time.

225
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,105
It's simple quantum mechanics.

226
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:42,078
You take water, for example.
Sometimes it's water,
sometimes it's ice,

227
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:46,082
Sometimes
it's steam or vapor-

228
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,819
It's always the same old h2o.
It only changes it's properties.

229
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:53,590
Your mother's like that.

230
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:56,193
She's like water.

231
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:03,933
I made a decision
a long time ago just
to love her basic properties.

232
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:09,772
Little did I realize, I'd gone
nuclear fission in that water.

233
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:13,310
Get it?

234
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:15,712
Get it?

235
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:19,882
I made a pun.

236
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,719
I went nuclear fishin'.
It's a pun.

237
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:26,223
You're a riot, dad.

238
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,727
<i>And we both know
a lot more about love now.</i>

239
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:34,897
See you later, ladies.

240
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:38,868
- He's blind and she's crazy.
- They're perfect
for each other.

241
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:45,808
Nobody woke me up.

242
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:54,651
You know how I always like
to make breakfast the first
morning in a new house.

243
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:02,191
<i>How are the beds?</i>

244
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,262
Okay.

245
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,268
I'm sorry.

246
00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:19,776
You're always sorry.

247
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,547
Well, I guess
they add up, don't they?

248
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:29,952
I'm just a sorry, sorry
excuse for a mother.

249
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:34,056
If you say so, mom.

250
00:23:34,124 --> 00:23:37,226
No, you're a good mother.

251
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:48,237
You know, life hands you
a lot of surprises, alex.

252
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:51,474
I guess I must be
one of yours.

253
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:01,017
Good morning, sir.
Colonel johnson?

254
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:03,085
Yes, sir.
End of the corridor.

255
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,706
Major henry t. Marshall
reporting for duty, sir.

256
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:27,043
- Major marshall,
good to have you here.
- Thank you, sir.

257
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,713
This is my executive officer,
lt. Colonel george land.

258
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,115
Major, we've heard
good things about your work.
Thank you, sir.

259
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:35,352
I'll let you two
get down to business.

260
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:39,889
Sit down, sit down, major.

261
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:42,559
Your trip go okay?
Your family settling in?

262
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,363
Yes, sir.
They're professionals.
Good, good.

263
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,283
Hi there,
I'm vera johnson.

264
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:10,453
And on behalf
of the fort matthews
women's welcoming committee,

265
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,790
I would like to welcome you
to our little community.

266
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:17,460
Thank you.
I'm carly marshall.

267
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:20,629
Thank you so much.

268
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,299
<i>Flowers.</i>

269
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:27,203
<i>Oh, come in. I'm sorry.
You just come right on in.</i>

270
00:25:32,877 --> 00:25:36,980
- Oh, what a beautiful
doll collection.
- Thank you.

271
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:39,983
So, you've been
stationed in hawaii?

272
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,986
For two years,
the last two years.

273
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:45,654
Have you ever been
in mexico or south america?

274
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:47,656
Yes.

275
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:50,826
See, my father was
in the diplomatic corps...

276
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:54,330
And of course
we traveled extensively
all over the world.

277
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:57,666
My lord, when I was
growing up I don't think
I was in the same place...

278
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:01,104
For more than six months
at a time.

279
00:26:01,171 --> 00:26:05,808
<i>Well, the officer's wives,
we're doing a show.
Ooh.</i>

280
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:10,413
It's sort of a musical revue.
Do you need any dancers?

281
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:16,619
Thank you.
Cream and sugar?
No, thank you.

282
00:26:16,686 --> 00:26:21,024
You see, we're
on point here.

283
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:28,864
We've got a nuclear test program
that's become something
of a political football.

284
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,635
And I just don't like to see
us getting kicked around.

285
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:35,471
Yes, sir.
I appreciate that.

286
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:37,807
I mean,
if this damn test ban
is ratified, major,

287
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:41,377
You and me are slated
to be among the first
to get our butts kicked.

288
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:43,813
As I understand it,
if the test ban is ratified,

289
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,150
We simply abandon atmospheric
tests and go underground.

290
00:26:47,217 --> 00:26:50,987
Given some of the test results
I've been looking at, I think
that's the way to go.

291
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:54,324
<i>Well, I can
appreciate that.</i>

292
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:58,661
But we're a team here.
We have to present one
consistent point of view.

293
00:26:58,728 --> 00:27:00,596
You understand that.
You're a soldier.

294
00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:03,299
Yes, sir. I am a soldier
and my duty is science.

295
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,301
Well, I'm just reminding you
that we work for the army,

296
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:07,603
<i>Not the a.E.C., congress,
or popular science.</i>

297
00:27:07,671 --> 00:27:09,772
You understand?
Yes, sir.

298
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,475
Good. That will be all, major.

299
00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:26,956
<i>If I hadn't gotten married,
I was going to hollywood
for a screen test.</i>

300
00:27:27,024 --> 00:27:30,293
Well, you sure are pretty enough
to be in the movies.

301
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:33,796
I took ballet too.
Did I tell you?

302
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:36,632
I just love
getting the flowers
after a performance.

303
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,970
Carly, these are just
the greatest bunch of gals
you'd ever want to know.

304
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,209
Now, they're just
all gonna make you feel
real at home. Come on.

305
00:27:50,214 --> 00:27:53,316
Ladies, help has arrived.

306
00:27:58,722 --> 00:28:00,923
Mom's gonna kill you.
No, she won't.

307
00:28:03,494 --> 00:28:05,928
<i>Let's play a joke on her.
What kind of joke?</i>

308
00:28:05,996 --> 00:28:10,933
We'll both go and lay down
on the living room floor
and pretend we're dead or sick.

309
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:13,002
Hello. I'm home.

310
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:18,774
Where's mom?

311
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:22,011
I don't know.
Probably at the movies.
She didn't leave a note?

312
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,649
Actually, school
was pretty good.

313
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:31,521
<i>The principal
and his custodial staff
took turns raping me,</i>

314
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:36,292
While governor wallace himself
stood there and watched
and welcomed us to alabama.

315
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,563
I guess that's what you'd call
southern hospitality.

316
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,473
Oh, daddy's home.

317
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,809
I missed you.
I'm glad to see you.

318
00:28:53,877 --> 00:28:56,579
Sorry I'm late.
Hello, girls.

319
00:28:58,014 --> 00:28:59,798
ta da

320
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:04,220
<i>I've decided
to become a makeup artist.
My face is my easel.</i>

321
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:08,157
Honey, you're much too fair
to wear that dark eye shadow and
much too young to wear makeup.

322
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:10,193
I told you.

323
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:12,161
Wife, I hope you got
food in those bags.

324
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:14,430
Oh, I got that and more.

325
00:29:14,498 --> 00:29:18,568
We are gonna have
a party tonight.

326
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:21,337
<i>Lookee here.</i>

327
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:26,609
That, my dear, is for you.

328
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:28,677
Goody.

329
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:33,182
And for my sweet man.

330
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:42,024
To replace the one
that was lost in that move
to japan or germany or alaska.

331
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:44,026
<i>Thanks, mom.</i>

332
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:46,295
Will you teach me?

333
00:29:46,363 --> 00:29:48,631
As soon as you wash
your pretty little face.

334
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:53,136
A selmer.
Thank you, sweetheart,
I've been missing a clarinet.

335
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:57,306
Did you know that your daddy
worked his way through college
playing in a band?

336
00:29:57,374 --> 00:30:00,643
My daddy? No.
Major squarehead?

337
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,947
<i>Oh, yeah.
I found that in a pawn
shop along with-</i>

338
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:07,716
For alexandra.

339
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:12,988
It's 'cause you're so smart
and you see things
so clearly and-

340
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:16,325
Well, you can be
the family historian.
Thank you, mom.

341
00:30:16,393 --> 00:30:18,994
It's got film
and flashbulbs and-

342
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:21,330
Well, you just pose us
and shoot away.

343
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:26,769
Mom, what did you get?

344
00:30:26,836 --> 00:30:31,006
I get to make us
a indoor picnic.

345
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:39,515
All right, now we'll see
who's hot and who's not.

346
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,517
Play us some old bop, pop.

347
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:54,029
Come on, honey.
Dance with me.

348
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:56,265
I'll teach you how, okay?

349
00:31:03,873 --> 00:31:07,142
Try this.

350
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:10,479
Everybody,
say "shit."

351
00:31:10,714 --> 00:31:12,815
<i>Shit.</i>

352
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:14,783
Enjoy your drinks.

353
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:18,654
Alex, I've told you young ladies
do not chew gum in public.

354
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:21,540
I am not a lady,
I'm a teenager.

355
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:24,893
Teenagers keep
wrigley's in business.
Spit it out.

356
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:29,365
Carly. A double vodka
martini on the rocks,

357
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,235
<i>Two shirley temples
and vermouth.</i>

358
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:36,739
- So, where's our host?
- Right over there.

359
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:41,344
Oh, at ease, major.
This is a party.

360
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:43,679
Colonel johnson,
I'd like you to meet
my wife carly.

361
00:31:43,747 --> 00:31:46,014
Pleased
to meet you.

362
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:48,083
How do you do,
colonel?

363
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:50,353
Carly, hi.
Vera, hi.

364
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,356
Major marshall, it's so good
to meet you at last.

365
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:56,392
Mrs. Johnson, carly's told me
how kind you've been to her.

366
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,861
Oh, we've been having
so much fun at rehearsals,
haven't we?

367
00:31:58,928 --> 00:32:00,963
<i>I'd like you
to meet my son glenn.</i>

368
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,666
This is mrs. Marshall.
Mrs. Marshall,
how do you do?

369
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:06,902
Rebecca and alexandra.

370
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:10,573
You're going to west point
in the fall?
Yes, ma'am, if they'll have me.

371
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:14,310
They haven't turned down
a johnson in five generations.
They'll be lucky to get you.

372
00:32:14,378 --> 00:32:18,547
I've always said that
vince was born to command
and I was born to demand.

373
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:22,785
it's lucky you two
found each other.

374
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:25,655
Would you two like
to play some croquet?
Go on.

375
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,990
Go on, go play.
Okay.

376
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:31,026
<i>You've got a real bevy
of beauties here, major.
I envy you.</i>

377
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:34,797
And you are
a flatterer, colonel.

378
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:37,900
the kids seem
to hit it off real good.

379
00:32:38,302 --> 00:32:41,704
- Alex isn't very shy.
- No, you know she gets
that quality from me.

380
00:32:41,805 --> 00:32:45,341
Lord, you should have seen
when I was pursuing the major.

381
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:49,278
I just ran him ragged
till I finally let him catch me.

382
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:53,516
<i>- Hi, girls.
- Hi.</i>

383
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:56,686
I thought you and mom
were going to another party.
We are.

384
00:32:56,753 --> 00:33:00,289
Mom went over to help
mrs. Johnson with her makeup.

385
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:05,194
What are you doing?
Probably stay home
and watch tv.

386
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:10,299
Why don't you go check out
the teen center?

387
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,135
'cause any place
that calls itself
the teen center...

388
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:15,971
Is probably full of people
who can't make friends.

389
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,974
We've been here two months
and neither one of you
has brought home a friend.

390
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:21,644
Dad, most of your colleagues
around here...

391
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:26,014
Are dedicated to a program
of armed nuclear destruction.

392
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:30,686
<i>I think they're cretins
and that makes their
offspring sub-cretins.</i>

393
00:33:30,754 --> 00:33:33,489
If you have a problem
with sub-cretins, don't sit
at home and complain about it.

394
00:33:33,557 --> 00:33:36,459
Go forth and enlighten them.

395
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:41,831
Yeah, maybe I'll start the first
teens for test ban club.

396
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:44,265
<i>That should make me
real popular around here.</i>

397
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,435
Run away from home
and change your name first.

398
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:50,939
I really
appreciate this, carly.

399
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:53,775
Oh, I like to do it.

400
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:57,278
You always look
so stylish.

401
00:33:57,346 --> 00:34:02,050
Women like you
are the reason that men
like women in the first place.

402
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:04,052
well.

403
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,122
A woman's charm
is mostly illusion
after all.

404
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:16,064
I suppose we all have
to grow old some day.

405
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:20,134
I just don't think
you gotta look bad
in the process.

406
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:28,577
I see these fine
little lines in my face.

407
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:31,580
They're called wrinkles, honey.
You might as well
get used to it now.

408
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:36,084
I look in the mirror sometimes
and I see this old woman
lurking there...

409
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:38,587
Just waiting to grab me.

410
00:34:38,654 --> 00:34:41,790
Oh, I just get so frightened.

411
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:44,258
Carly, you have
such an active imagination.

412
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:46,427
I've seen you
in those rehearsals.

413
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:50,599
Come on, don't you think that
good posture and keeping fit
and keeping active...

414
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:53,301
Is all a part
of keeping young too?

415
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:56,004
Maybe if you're a woodpecker.

416
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:04,513
Welcome to the fort matthews
hail and farewell dance.

417
00:35:16,626 --> 00:35:18,560
Come on and dance with me.
No.

418
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:20,729
Yes. Yes, you can.
I can't dance.

419
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:23,197
<i>Major, I'm glad
you could make it.
Yes, sir.</i>

420
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:25,533
This is ray stevens
from the atomic
energy commission.

421
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:30,238
I have heard that gentlemen
from the a.E.C. Are much better
dancers than military men.

422
00:35:30,305 --> 00:35:33,975
Is that true?
My husband won't
dance with me.

423
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:38,246
The only time I really
enjoyed dancing was when
I was in the service.

424
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:40,248
<i>That was years ago.
Hmm.</i>

425
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:45,754
It's left up to me to uphold
the honor of the military
on the dance floor.

426
00:35:45,821 --> 00:35:47,556
<i>Shall we?</i>

427
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,261
You two just share some
atomic secrets or something.

428
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:55,997
I don't know
if I can take this.

429
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh, yeah, you can.

430
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:01,102
You like it.

431
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:08,543
I didn't risk my ass in guam
so some damn harvard boy...

432
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:10,545
Could run this country
into the toilet.

433
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:14,049
If he can't stand up
to the damn communists,
let us do our jobs.

434
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:18,286
To hell with nevada,
we'll use havana
for a test site.

435
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:29,230
I know you're
a strong supporter
of underground testing.

436
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:33,518
Hell, that's only my stated
position in about 30 extremely
obscure reports.

437
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:38,106
You guys must be burying
those reports deeper
than the moscow subway.

438
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,922
Do you have any children,
mr. Stevens?

439
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,125
Four. I know
what you're thinking.

440
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:12,206
My oldest daughter wants
to form a test ban club
right here on the base.

441
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:14,208
Sometimes I feel
that way myself.

442
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:16,645
Think we ought to join?
No.

443
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,357
You sure?
No.

444
00:37:29,424 --> 00:37:32,827
Let me have another one.

445
00:37:33,162 --> 00:37:37,231
my heart I can't control

446
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:41,870
you're, oh, my very soul

447
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:44,388
my only prayer will be

448
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:47,575
someday you'll care for me

449
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:51,913
but it's only

450
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:54,315
make

451
00:37:54,684 --> 00:37:57,318
believe

452
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:05,093
Uh-oh, here comes
a stop sign.

453
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,364
Time to go, carly.

454
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,366
I want to stay.

455
00:38:12,434 --> 00:38:15,369
This gal's a real dynamo, major.
If we harness her energy,

456
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,939
We won't need reactors.

457
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:20,875
Come on, daddy.
Dance with me.

458
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:23,377
Time to go.
Now. Let's go.

459
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:26,447
Then I'll dance
by myself.

460
00:38:58,197 --> 00:39:00,248
That is an exceptional woman.

461
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:05,419
No!

462
00:39:08,257 --> 00:39:11,025
Something should
be done about this.

463
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:16,264
Yeah, well, I can always
requisition another one.

464
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,768
You're a pig.

465
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:57,738
Well, you know,
when you're just sitting around
and you're not doing anything-

466
00:39:57,807 --> 00:40:00,574
A moment of time
when nothing's happening.

467
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:02,576
Mm-hmm.

468
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:08,249
Well, I call that a "noment."

469
00:40:08,317 --> 00:40:12,586
And then when it's
really hot and you're too
lazy to get up and do anything,

470
00:40:12,654 --> 00:40:15,924
Well, I call that
a "sloment."

471
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:19,327
A "sloment," huh?
What do you call this?

472
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:23,596
A tongue kiss.

473
00:40:30,437 --> 00:40:32,605
People were
laughing at you.

474
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:34,607
Oh, just because you never
have any fun doesn't mean...

475
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:36,709
You have to spend
your entire life ruining mine.

476
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:39,212
Son of a bitch.

477
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,948
Why is mom all wet?
She had an accident.

478
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:22,755
Hi, daddy.

479
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,168
<i>Ten hut.</i>

480
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:10,503
Ten hut.
As you were.

481
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:13,006
How's it going, hank?
Busy, sir.

482
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:15,842
Well, you're going
to be a lot busier.

483
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,678
We just got word that some
seismologists in finland
have detected evidence...

484
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:21,681
That the soviets have detonated
an above-ground device.

485
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:24,351
The brass must be thrilled.
We're off the bench and back
in the ball game.

486
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,519
You bet your ass we are.

487
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:30,023
Everything we do from now on
becomes that much more vital.

488
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:32,025
Those bastards push in
a pile of chips,

489
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:34,861
We better be able to raise
the bet, right?
Right.

490
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:40,700
We can maximize
our opportunities
real quick, especially you.

491
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:44,537
As of 0800 hours Friday,
4, 28, you are t.D.Y.
To operations h.Q...

492
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:46,539
At the nevada test site
in mercury.

493
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:49,042
To what do I owe
this honor, sir?

494
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:53,546
Stevens from the a.E.C.
He was real impressed with you.

495
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:57,117
You get a clean slate
to start with this time.

496
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:03,489
I knew vince johnson
wasn't such a bad guy.

497
00:43:03,557 --> 00:43:05,491
This is a real
vote of confidence in your-

498
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:08,494
Carly, do you
remember your bible?

499
00:43:08,562 --> 00:43:13,166
Of course I remember my bible.
You know grandpa was a preacher.

500
00:43:13,234 --> 00:43:18,071
All right. How did
david steal bathsheba
away from her husband?

501
00:43:20,408 --> 00:43:23,743
He bought her a drink.
No, silly.

502
00:43:25,746 --> 00:43:30,917
He sent her husband away
into battle where he was killed.
Second samuel, verse 15.

503
00:43:30,952 --> 00:43:32,919
Monsieur, your car
is waiting.

504
00:43:32,954 --> 00:43:36,756
Tell him I'll be
right- right there.

505
00:43:39,593 --> 00:43:42,762
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

506
00:43:44,765 --> 00:43:48,701
The only thing that ever
happens to me is that I just-

507
00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:50,937
I miss you too much.

508
00:43:57,778 --> 00:44:00,480
Do you really have to be gone
for two whole weeks?

509
00:44:00,547 --> 00:44:02,482
Yes, I do, baby.

510
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:05,986
Well, that's enough time
for you to convince them
to abandon nuclear weapons.

511
00:44:06,053 --> 00:44:07,988
Yes, it is.
You bet.

512
00:44:08,055 --> 00:44:09,990
Ooh, daddy.
What?

513
00:44:10,057 --> 00:44:13,493
Will you call me every night
just before I go to bed?

514
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,495
No, it's too expensive.

515
00:44:15,562 --> 00:44:17,563
of course, I will.

516
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:20,500
I love you.
I love you too.

517
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:22,568
<i>Bye, daddy, bye.
Be good.</i>

518
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:50,863
Hundred sixty
millimeter mortars...

519
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:52,865
About the strength
of two hand grenades.

520
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:55,035
Don't worry though.
They're all spent.

521
00:44:55,102 --> 00:44:59,272
They used
to train g.I.S back here
in the second world war.

522
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:07,147
You can't tell anybody
about this place.

523
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:09,382
Never.

524
00:45:10,717 --> 00:45:12,985
I like it.

525
00:45:13,054 --> 00:45:15,488
I wouldn't want
to live here, but...

526
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:17,490
It's nice.

527
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:20,060
It's private.

528
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:24,497
Let's get hitched
and live here forever.

529
00:45:24,565 --> 00:45:29,202
To an army man?
They're too weird.

530
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:35,007
Last year, colonel harris
took his family to nevada
to watch the a-bomb go off.

531
00:45:35,076 --> 00:45:37,009
That was their vacation.

532
00:45:37,078 --> 00:45:39,512
<i>Look, I'm not ashamed
of what they're doing.</i>

533
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,515
I mean,
the manhattan project
ended the last war.

534
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:45,185
Maybe project blue sky
will prevent the next one.

535
00:45:45,252 --> 00:45:47,220
Do you know why
they call it blue sky?

536
00:45:47,588 --> 00:45:50,690
They're gonna detonate
a big one underground
to track radiation.

537
00:45:50,757 --> 00:45:53,693
But you can't see radiation,

538
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,197
You can't feel it
or taste it or smell it.

539
00:45:57,264 --> 00:46:00,133
So only a handful of people will
actually know where it is...

540
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:03,603
And the rest of the country
could be swimming in the stuff,

541
00:46:03,604 --> 00:46:06,739
But for all they know
the sky is just
as blue as ever.

542
00:46:07,108 --> 00:46:09,609
Yeah, well, what
they don't know
won't hurt them.

543
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:15,482
No wonder west point
snapped you up.

544
00:46:15,549 --> 00:46:19,152
And if I married you,
I'd end up just like my mom.

545
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,887
Yeah, you talk gibberish
sometimes, alex.

546
00:46:27,394 --> 00:46:30,079
- Catch.
- No!

547
00:46:34,635 --> 00:46:36,302
What the hell was that?

548
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,505
They weren't supposed
to start maneuvers
for another two weeks.

549
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:41,274
Well, maybe them cubans
sprung a sneak attack.

550
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:53,001
Jesus.
Let's get the hell
out of here.

551
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,809
<i>What in the hell are you
doing here, mister?</i>

552
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:50,492
What do you know?
What's happening?

553
00:47:56,499 --> 00:48:00,202
Calm down, calm down.
Everything's under control.
It's all right.

554
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:03,205
Alex, honey, are you okay?

555
00:48:03,272 --> 00:48:06,709
Vince, I think we gotta take
him to the hospital it looks
like he needs stitches.

556
00:48:06,776 --> 00:48:08,877
<i>Let's see.
And he needs a swift kick
in the butt even more.</i>

557
00:48:08,945 --> 00:48:10,879
Are you hurt?
No.

558
00:48:10,947 --> 00:48:12,881
<i>Excuse me, I'd like
to apologize for my son.</i>

559
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:16,218
I'm afraid he was off-limits
with your daughter.

560
00:48:16,285 --> 00:48:18,554
Well, boys will be boys.

561
00:48:18,621 --> 00:48:23,225
Yeah. I'd like
this area secured now.
Nobody goes in or out.

562
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:25,361
<i>Go home, everybody.
The show's over.</i>

563
00:48:27,296 --> 00:48:30,065
<i>I want to know what you
were doing up there.</i>

564
00:48:30,132 --> 00:48:34,069
Just what you told me to do.
Making friends with glenn.

565
00:48:34,136 --> 00:48:37,740
I want to know exactly
what the two of you
were doing up there.

566
00:48:37,807 --> 00:48:39,975
What do you mean by "exactly"?

567
00:48:40,343 --> 00:48:44,646
Well, was an old grenade
the only thing that went off?

568
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:47,249
I can't believe you.
You don't even care about me.

569
00:48:47,316 --> 00:48:49,251
You just want to know
about all the sex stuff!

570
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:52,421
Don't you sass me, sister!
I am not your sister!

571
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:56,825
Well, if I had a sister,
I would tell her everything!

572
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:07,369
Especially... About boys.

573
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:09,438
Ew, boys.

574
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:31,059
What are you-
what are you doing here?

575
00:49:31,127 --> 00:49:34,530
I've come to kidnap you
and take you to the woods.
I left my knife at the bungalow.

576
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:37,733
<i>Will you come with?
Glenn, that place
is dangerous.</i>

577
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:41,236
<i>- Not anymore.
My dad had it cleaned up.
- If my mom finds out-</i>

578
00:49:41,304 --> 00:49:44,239
She's gonna be at rehearsal
for hours. Come on.

579
00:49:44,307 --> 00:49:47,075
I've gotta finish up
my chores.

580
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:49,745
<i>All right,
but I gotta help.
That's what I'm here for.</i>

581
00:49:49,813 --> 00:49:52,147
Okay, come in.
All right.

582
00:49:53,316 --> 00:49:55,951
Wait. Come back here.

583
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:10,933
come in, rad two. Over.

584
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,102
Base station, this is
rad site two. Over.

585
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,972
Rad two,
hold your place.

586
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:21,443
This underground stuff
is not like the old days.

587
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:23,779
Look at all this junk.

588
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:27,950
Hell, at bikini, you could
feel the wind from the blast
through the atmosphere.

589
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:31,787
Flying particles
as big as corn flakes.

590
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:33,789
We're coming up
on 60 seconds, sir.

591
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:37,425
all cameras report.
Ground cameras, report. Over.

592
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:39,862
camera one ready.

593
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:43,899
camera two ready.

594
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,001
camera three ready.

595
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:49,504
<i>- Camera four ready.
- Camera five ready.</i>

596
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:55,176
...Forty-seven, forty-six
forty-five, forty-four-

597
00:50:55,512 --> 00:50:59,147
nuclear underground test
number 001, clear and counting.

598
00:50:59,215 --> 00:51:03,251
All systems green.
All safeties are off and ready.

599
00:51:03,319 --> 00:51:08,089
All personnel
in position and holding.
Standing by.

600
00:51:08,157 --> 00:51:11,159
Final lock position
procedure complete.

601
00:51:12,228 --> 00:51:15,531
What the hell is that?
Let's take a peek.

602
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:21,469
...Twenty, nineteen, eighteen,

603
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,471
Base station,
this is rad site two,

604
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,474
We have two civilians
on horseback heading
right towards site.

605
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:30,211
<i>- Punch up a camera
on those cowboys.
- Base station, base station.</i>

606
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:32,147
We gotta get
them out of there.
Please advise.

607
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:35,651
we cannot detonate.
Abort the test!

608
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:38,103
<i>- It's too late.
- ...Three, two, detonation.</i>

609
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,560
it's venting!

610
00:51:49,198 --> 00:51:51,399
Radiation's
right off the scale.

611
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,468
Base station,
this is rad site two.

612
00:51:53,536 --> 00:51:55,571
We have massive radiation
venting in sector four.

613
00:51:57,574 --> 00:52:01,810
Rad two, return to base.
Rad two, return to base.

614
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:27,769
General, sir,
we gotta find those guys.

615
00:52:27,837 --> 00:52:29,771
The fox has left
the henhouse, major.

616
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,440
I beg the general's pardon,
we are not talking
about chickens, sir.

617
00:52:32,508 --> 00:52:34,442
We're talking
about human lives.

618
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:39,798
These things happen, major.
Every tv station and every
radio station in this state...

619
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,801
Was notified of this test.
They were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

620
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:46,855
I beg the general's pardon,
but that is bullshit.
Those men have been cooked.

621
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:49,124
There's ways
to handle it, major.

622
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:51,459
We'll be notifying the local
medical authorities.

623
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:54,295
These men will
come in for treatment.
They'll be taken care of.

624
00:52:54,363 --> 00:52:57,499
<i>- Very good, if they're alive.
- Goddamn it, marshall.
We've gotta keep a lid on it.</i>

625
00:52:57,634 --> 00:53:01,637
There will be no
talk about this, major.
You can't even tell your dog.

626
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,810
Back away from the door, hank.

627
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,317
Let's go have a drink.

628
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:24,760
It's criminal.
They should be found.
Right.

629
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,929
No, it's a crime.
Right, they should,
but we can't.

630
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:32,267
So forget it.
They're exposed.

631
00:53:32,635 --> 00:53:35,103
It's too late to do
anything for them, pal.
It's too damn late.

632
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:39,107
Jimmy, I have dedicated my life
to counting alpha particles...

633
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:41,643
And beta particles
and gamma rays.

634
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:46,982
I monitor radio iodine levels,
I calculate isotopic
half-lives-

635
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:50,285
Things you can't see
or hear or feel,

636
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,954
Things unknowable
to the common man...

637
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:56,792
Who winds up dead as shit.

638
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,794
It's a crime.

639
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:02,297
<i>Your work's done here.
Forget about it.</i>

640
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:09,705
It's a goddamn crime,
and I am going to forget
precisely nothing...

641
00:54:12,975 --> 00:54:16,411
And no one.

642
00:54:16,478 --> 00:54:18,479
<i>Fayrene, two more.</i>

643
00:54:23,918 --> 00:54:27,021
Bravo.
Good night, ladies.

644
00:54:27,088 --> 00:54:29,523
Good night.
Good night.

645
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,192
Good night, girls.
I am so hot.

646
00:54:35,096 --> 00:54:37,031
Uh-oh, here she goes.

647
00:54:37,098 --> 00:54:39,366
<i>Oh, next year
we should do gypsy.</i>

648
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:41,702
Yeah, wouldn't our husbands
just love that.

649
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,371
God, I could
never do that.
Good night.

650
00:54:57,786 --> 00:54:59,720
Good night.

651
00:54:59,788 --> 00:55:01,722
<i>Good night.</i>

652
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:10,698
You know, I bet you really
could have been in movies.

653
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:16,904
<i>I wanted that.
I really did.</i>

654
00:55:21,242 --> 00:55:24,845
You know, sometimes I think
I could just disappear...

655
00:55:25,213 --> 00:55:27,681
And no one would ever
know I'd been here.

656
00:55:27,749 --> 00:55:31,351
That's why we have children,
and mine need tucking up
about now.

657
00:55:31,419 --> 00:55:34,088
You want a ride?

658
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:48,936
No.
Okay.

659
00:56:16,064 --> 00:56:18,165
If the show is as good
as the rehearsal,

660
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:21,268
You got a hit.

661
00:56:23,238 --> 00:56:25,239
How's glenn?

662
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:28,909
He's okay.

663
00:56:31,412 --> 00:56:35,282
You know, that routine might
be a little risque for the base.

664
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:37,784
<i>It might overexcite
some of the men.</i>

665
00:56:37,786 --> 00:56:43,190
I thought men joined the army
looking for adventure.

666
00:56:43,258 --> 00:56:46,693
You've been watching
too many war movies.

667
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:50,297
I hate war movies.

668
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:56,369
<i>I need your help.</i>

669
00:56:56,437 --> 00:56:59,807
Zip me up.

670
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:14,822
You know,
zipping you up...

671
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,991
Is not exactly
what I had in mind.

672
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,660
No?

673
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,729
No.

674
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,739
No.

675
00:57:34,408 --> 00:57:37,244
Meet me outside.

676
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:33,000
Glenn, maybe this
isn't such a good idea.

677
00:58:33,067 --> 00:58:36,403
It's all right.

678
00:58:58,592 --> 00:59:01,028
Come on, let's go.
Let's just go.

679
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:06,733
Oh, my god.
Oh, don't you-

680
00:59:06,935 --> 00:59:10,938
Come on, let's go.
Get away from me!

681
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:20,179
alex, open the door.
I'm gonna tell him.

682
00:59:20,548 --> 00:59:22,181
Alex, please.

683
00:59:22,249 --> 00:59:26,485
<i>Please what?
Please talk to me or
please don't tell daddy?</i>

684
00:59:26,554 --> 00:59:29,522
<i>You're not even sorry
for what you did, are you?</i>

685
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,991
You're just afraid
of getting caught!

686
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:34,627
That's not true.

687
00:59:34,695 --> 00:59:39,566
<i>how could you
do this to him?</i>

688
00:59:39,633 --> 00:59:41,568
<i>Everybody's
gonna find out.</i>

689
00:59:41,635 --> 00:59:45,638
<i>If I don't tell him,
they're all gonna laugh
at him behind his back.</i>

690
00:59:48,075 --> 00:59:49,943
I hate you!

691
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:58,150
I'm gonna tell him.

692
00:59:59,587 --> 01:00:01,588
When?

693
01:00:08,228 --> 01:00:10,162
Operator.

694
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,332
Long distance, please.
City and state, please.

695
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,770
Mercury, nevada. 7458.

696
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:19,939
One moment, please.

697
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,847
a.E.C., mercury.

698
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,750
Major hank marshall, please.

699
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:36,756
call for major marshall,
line one.

700
01:00:36,824 --> 01:00:39,191
Line one, major marshall.

701
01:00:44,598 --> 01:00:46,733
this is hank marshall!

702
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,868
Hank?

703
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:58,678
Daddy, when are you
coming home?

704
01:00:58,746 --> 01:01:02,615
Sweetheart, you're gonna
have to speak up!
I can barely hear ya!

705
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,555
I have to-

706
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:17,630
I have to tell you something,
and it's hard for me to-

707
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:20,166
What is it, baby?
I can't hear!

708
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:27,073
After rehearsal... Tonight,

709
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:30,677
Vince johnson drove me home.

710
01:01:33,647 --> 01:01:35,481
And-

711
01:01:35,683 --> 01:01:39,185
I can't hear you, baby!
I'm sorry! You're gonna have
to speak up now really loud!

712
01:01:39,252 --> 01:01:41,754
Wait a minute!
I'll try to find
a different line!

713
01:01:45,793 --> 01:01:47,960
I said...

714
01:01:48,195 --> 01:01:53,132
After rehearsal tonight,
vince johnson drove me home!

715
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,402
vince johnson drove me home.

716
01:01:56,469 --> 01:01:58,905
Just a mistake, daddy.

717
01:02:02,943 --> 01:02:04,944
And-

718
01:02:06,213 --> 01:02:09,982
I-I- I can't-

719
01:02:41,248 --> 01:02:43,282
<i>Hi, daddy!
Hello, baby!</i>

720
01:02:46,253 --> 01:02:48,387
She's at the officers' club.

721
01:02:48,756 --> 01:02:50,556
Tonight's the show.

722
01:02:51,759 --> 01:02:54,127
Oh, lord, where is she?

723
01:02:54,194 --> 01:02:56,763
Check the motels.

724
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:59,531
Ah, here she comes.
Lock up your husbands, girls.

725
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,608
<i>Hello.
Boy, am I nervous.</i>

726
01:03:09,676 --> 01:03:12,178
<i>I just hope I don't
trip or something.
Don't' worry.</i>

727
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,380
We've been practicing
for weeks.
You'll be fine.

728
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:17,083
What have you got
to be worried about?
I'm the one with two left feet.

729
01:03:17,151 --> 01:03:21,720
Hey, why don't you girls
come over to my house for
some dinner after the show?

730
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:24,223
Sounds great.
I could use a break
from the kids.

731
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:26,292
Can I talk with you,
vera?

732
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:30,329
Why? Sit down
and have a drink...

733
01:03:30,397 --> 01:03:33,699
And go over
the gory details?

734
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:37,837
The things you like
to share with friends.

735
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:44,677
People like you
come and go, carly.

736
01:03:44,744 --> 01:03:49,348
You mean just one less
christmas card to me.

737
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:51,818
five minutes, ladies.

738
01:03:51,885 --> 01:03:53,820
Can I still do
my number?

739
01:03:53,887 --> 01:03:57,723
Oh, my god.
Is that all you can think of?

740
01:03:57,791 --> 01:04:00,843
musicians, places, please.

741
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:20,346
All my life,
people have told lies about me.

742
01:04:24,084 --> 01:04:27,386
Even when I was little,

743
01:04:27,454 --> 01:04:30,122
Other girls used
to make up stories.

744
01:04:45,372 --> 01:04:47,406
fernando's hideaway

745
01:05:00,988 --> 01:05:03,890
fernando's hideaway

746
01:05:08,395 --> 01:05:10,863
At least one of them's
got nice legs.

747
01:05:16,603 --> 01:05:18,737
fernando's hideaway

748
01:05:26,746 --> 01:05:28,680
I need to talk to you.

749
01:05:28,748 --> 01:05:31,817
Later, marshall.
Now. I need to
talk to you right now.

750
01:05:31,919 --> 01:05:34,920
<i>- It's not the time to-
- I need to talk to you
right fucking now.</i>

751
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:52,271
This is a personal matter.
Don't you think we oughta
discuss this-

752
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:54,440
It's not personal.
It has to do with blue sky.

753
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:58,945
fernando's hideaway
ole

754
01:06:09,957 --> 01:06:12,958
Look, I'm not gonna
talk about this shit...

755
01:06:13,025 --> 01:06:15,160
With you now or any other time,
all right?

756
01:06:15,228 --> 01:06:18,731
Colonel johnson, 48 hours ago,
we irradiated 2 people
in mercury, nevada,

757
01:06:18,865 --> 01:06:21,366
Who are now facing blindness,
leukemia and bone cancer.

758
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:23,836
<i>One more word, mister,
and I'll see you
court-martialed.</i>

759
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:25,838
hank! Hank!
You don't have
the balls for that.

760
01:06:25,905 --> 01:06:29,875
You're just jealous
because you can't
satisfy that nympho.

761
01:06:30,877 --> 01:06:33,379
Hank!

762
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,482
Hank!

763
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:54,733
Oh, god.

764
01:06:56,536 --> 01:06:58,637
I just hurt all over.

765
01:07:02,909 --> 01:07:05,076
Maybe we can
call it even, daddy.

766
01:07:05,144 --> 01:07:07,279
I doubt it.

767
01:07:07,346 --> 01:07:09,848
We've done
too much damage
to each other.

768
01:07:12,051 --> 01:07:14,887
I'm the one all bandaged up.

769
01:07:14,954 --> 01:07:19,758
I can't even imagine
what it's gonna look like.

770
01:07:19,826 --> 01:07:22,093
I always loved
looking at you.

771
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:27,132
I even enjoyed
other men looking at you.

772
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,108
But you always take
everything right over
the edge, don't you?

773
01:07:45,452 --> 01:07:48,787
It didn't mean anything.
You know that.

774
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:53,692
Oh, I know
it didn't mean anything.

775
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,462
Just like
all the other times.

776
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:03,735
But it meant a lot to me.

777
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:16,682
I don't know how much longer
I can go on. I'm tired.

778
01:08:22,856 --> 01:08:24,990
I'm real tired.

779
01:08:33,132 --> 01:08:35,501
I gotta go see
about the girls.

780
01:08:52,752 --> 01:08:56,154
She's gonna be fine.
Doctor says she can
come home in two days.

781
01:08:58,925 --> 01:09:02,594
Lydia, will you take
the girls home, please?

782
01:09:02,662 --> 01:09:04,963
<i>go on.</i>

783
01:09:11,404 --> 01:09:13,471
At ease.

784
01:09:19,495 --> 01:09:22,748
Mrs. Marshall,
this can't come off
for another week,

785
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,783
And it'll heal up
just fine.

786
01:09:24,851 --> 01:09:28,086
In a few weeks, you'll
need a magnifying glass
just to see it.

787
01:09:28,154 --> 01:09:33,191
I'm gonna need dark makeup
and heavy lisle stockings
for the rest of my life.

788
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:35,928
Now, now,
you just relax.

789
01:09:35,995 --> 01:09:38,129
You've got a visitor
coming up.

790
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:42,067
Who?
I don't know.

791
01:09:49,075 --> 01:09:50,976
Brought you some flowers.

792
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:53,528
Thanks.

793
01:10:00,086 --> 01:10:03,188
Hank's in big trouble.

794
01:10:03,539 --> 01:10:05,557
You should know that,
carly.

795
01:10:09,195 --> 01:10:13,031
Well, this whole thing,
it doesn't... Look good
for anyone.

796
01:10:13,099 --> 01:10:17,502
It's real... Messy,
and I like to keep
a clean base.

797
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:21,372
Besides, I-

798
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:26,578
Well, I feel...
Personally responsible.

799
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:31,917
We're both responsible.

800
01:10:42,729 --> 01:10:45,363
You don't know...

801
01:10:45,431 --> 01:10:47,666
How much I need him.

802
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:53,138
Nobody understands that.

803
01:10:57,343 --> 01:10:59,645
Well,

804
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:02,748
<i>There is...</i>

805
01:11:02,815 --> 01:11:05,083
<i>One way we could
get him out.</i>

806
01:11:05,151 --> 01:11:07,218
Maybe.

807
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:37,683
Daddy, I brought
some good news.

808
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:45,157
Vince johnson
has figured out a way
to help us out of all this.

809
01:11:45,224 --> 01:11:47,292
He had me
sign some papers...

810
01:11:47,643 --> 01:11:51,797
To put you in the hospital
for just a couple weeks,

811
01:11:51,864 --> 01:11:56,702
Just for observation,
and then the whole thing
is written off to stress.

812
01:11:58,004 --> 01:12:00,305
You've had me committed?

813
01:12:00,656 --> 01:12:04,309
No! No!
It's not as bad as it sounds.

814
01:12:04,711 --> 01:12:07,179
It's hardly gonna affect
your record at all.

815
01:12:07,246 --> 01:12:11,049
Is that
what he told you?
Yes.
That's what he told me.

816
01:12:11,117 --> 01:12:14,119
He also told me...

817
01:12:14,187 --> 01:12:17,856
That the only other alternative
would be a court-martial.

818
01:12:17,924 --> 01:12:21,226
A court-martial is what
I wanted. It's my only chance
to tell what really happened.

819
01:12:21,227 --> 01:12:25,063
A court-martial would mean
eight years in prison, he said.

820
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:27,966
It would mean
a dishonorable discharge.

821
01:12:28,034 --> 01:12:32,303
No pension, no transfer,
no nothing.

822
01:12:35,742 --> 01:12:40,045
Darling,
this is a setup.

823
01:12:40,246 --> 01:12:42,781
<i>We've been set up.</i>

824
01:12:50,089 --> 01:12:53,925
Major, we have orders
remanding you to base hospital.
Let me see them.

825
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,461
This was a verbal authorization
from colonel johnson, sir.

826
01:12:56,528 --> 01:12:58,563
<i>All right.
Get me somebody from
adjutant general's office.</i>

827
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:02,000
Our orders are to remove you
from base stockade
and remand you to b.G.H.

828
01:13:02,068 --> 01:13:04,903
Get me somebody from
the adjutant general's office,
then I'll consider moving.

829
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:07,155
Consider this, sir.
You either stand up now,

830
01:13:07,306 --> 01:13:11,042
Or we'll drag your ass out of
here so fast your butt won't
say good-bye to your shorts.

831
01:13:11,277 --> 01:13:13,145
Do I make myself clear, sir?

832
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:40,071
Major hank marshall.
Which room is he in?

833
01:13:40,089 --> 01:13:42,656
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
He's not allowed visitors.
- No. I'm his wife.

834
01:13:42,924 --> 01:13:45,926
I'm mrs. Marshall.
Of course I can see him.

835
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:51,264
Mrs. Marshall, there are
procedures to be followed
in the hospital.

836
01:13:51,433 --> 01:13:54,167
Well, how long do
those procedures take?

837
01:13:54,235 --> 01:13:56,670
About two weeks.

838
01:13:56,738 --> 01:13:58,672
Two weeks? For what?

839
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:03,376
We're doing everything
we possibly can
for major marshall.
Right.

840
01:14:03,445 --> 01:14:08,615
And I'm jackie kennedy,
and flying saucers
just stole my dog.

841
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,051
<i>But I don't want
to see him there.</i>

842
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:13,153
Daddy will be home soon.

843
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:17,758
It's taken me two weeks
to get permission
to visit him.

844
01:14:17,826 --> 01:14:21,027
Now, he's gonna need a hug
from his little baby.

845
01:14:21,095 --> 01:14:23,029
Besides, there's nothing
to be scared of.

846
01:14:23,097 --> 01:14:27,801
It's a hospital,
but he's not sick
or anything like that.

847
01:14:27,869 --> 01:14:29,837
Besides,
we're gonna have a-

848
01:14:29,904 --> 01:14:33,607
We're gonna have
a picnic. Now-

849
01:14:33,675 --> 01:14:36,977
You're not even dressed!
Go on! Get dressed!

850
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:38,979
I don't want to be late.

851
01:14:39,046 --> 01:14:43,283
You want me
to fix your hair?
I can do it myself.

852
01:14:45,286 --> 01:14:48,755
Okay.
Daddy likes mayonnaise.

853
01:14:49,891 --> 01:14:51,925
Daddy likes
a little pepper.

854
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:54,495
Now, everyone here
is under temporary sedation,

855
01:14:54,562 --> 01:14:56,563
So don't be alarmed,
mrs. Marshall.

856
01:14:56,631 --> 01:14:59,165
His condition
can change instantly.

857
01:15:05,974 --> 01:15:08,008
Daddy!

858
01:15:22,023 --> 01:15:24,525
I ma- I ma- I ma- I ma-

859
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,862
I made-

860
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:32,032
Made these for us?

861
01:15:35,036 --> 01:15:37,771
They al-almost...

862
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:40,541
Done.

863
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:55,556
Alex, you go after your sister.

864
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,768
Hi, daddy.

865
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:13,473
I brought you a picnic.

866
01:16:15,677 --> 01:16:19,546
I bet you could use
some good coffee, huh?

867
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:28,855
Excuse me, ma'am.

868
01:16:28,923 --> 01:16:31,140
Uh! Damn!

869
01:16:32,594 --> 01:16:35,996
<i>he's a nuclear engineer,
for christ's sake!</i>

870
01:16:36,097 --> 01:16:38,164
They got him making wallets!
How can they do this to him?
They?

871
01:16:38,232 --> 01:16:40,233
You! You did this!

872
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:42,502
Stop it!
It's your fault!

873
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:50,744
What are you doing?

874
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:54,648
Just wiping off
the ice cream.

875
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:07,293
welcome to the fort matthews
memorial day parade.

876
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:10,030
Participating in our
memorial day parade...

877
01:17:10,131 --> 01:17:13,533
Is the maxwell air force base
drill team and color guard.

878
01:17:13,635 --> 01:17:16,637
Fort matthews is
under the command of
colonel vincent p. Johnson.

879
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:24,144
Joining the military band,
we have the selma high
drum and bugle corps.

880
01:17:25,146 --> 01:17:27,347
Today we are
honored to have...

881
01:17:27,414 --> 01:17:30,383
Local veterans of
the first world war on hand.

882
01:17:30,652 --> 01:17:34,621
Let's have a big
round of applause for
our patriotic doughboys.

883
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,794
Coming onto
the parade ground next...

884
01:17:41,162 --> 01:17:43,830
Is our fine pratville high
marching band,

885
01:17:44,165 --> 01:17:46,166
Playing "host of freedom."

886
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:54,675
They can't do this to daddy.

887
01:17:57,211 --> 01:17:59,179
Mom, what are you doing?

888
01:18:05,687 --> 01:18:09,690
You will burn in hell,
you lying son of a bitch!

889
01:18:11,192 --> 01:18:12,859
You lying son of a bitch!

890
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:15,929
You think craziness
is hereditary?

891
01:18:15,997 --> 01:18:18,031
<i>I don't know,</i>

892
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:22,002
But it's not exactly
something we could
ask either one of them.

893
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:24,938
Mommy,
what are we gonna do?

894
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:30,643
Here's yesterday's mail.

895
01:18:30,712 --> 01:18:34,214
There's a letter here
for dad from nevada.

896
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,108
Daddy.

897
01:20:16,282 --> 01:20:19,719
Alex! Alex!
Alex, wake up.

898
01:20:19,786 --> 01:20:22,521
Becky! Becky, get up.

899
01:20:22,589 --> 01:20:24,523
Quickly!
Come on, girls.

900
01:20:24,591 --> 01:20:27,492
Get up.
We're going on a trip.
Hurry up. Pack a bag.

901
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,528
Help your sister.
Get up!

902
01:20:29,596 --> 01:20:32,531
<i>It's the middle of the night.
We'll beat the traffic.</i>

903
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:41,506
Thank you.

904
01:20:41,574 --> 01:20:45,677
Girls, wake up!
I got some breakfast.

905
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:47,679
Eat up.

906
01:20:47,748 --> 01:20:49,749
oh

907
01:20:49,816 --> 01:20:54,186
sometimes I get
a good feeling, yeah

908
01:20:54,254 --> 01:20:57,489
something's got
a hold on me, yeah

909
01:20:57,557 --> 01:20:59,524
oh, it must be love

910
01:20:59,592 --> 01:21:04,130
oh, something's got a hold
on me right now, child

911
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:06,132
oh, it must be love

912
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:08,734
let me tell you now
I've got a feeling

913
01:21:08,802 --> 01:21:10,736
I feel so strange

914
01:21:10,804 --> 01:21:14,006
everything about me
seems to have changed

915
01:21:14,074 --> 01:21:17,910
<i>step by step
mom, let's stop. Please?</i>

916
01:21:17,978 --> 01:21:20,246
no, baby.
We're not gonna stop.

917
01:21:20,313 --> 01:21:22,381
<i>we haven't slept
in two days.</i>

918
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:24,483
I just can't sleep
till I get daddy out.

919
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:28,587
oh, hey, hey, yeah

920
01:21:28,655 --> 01:21:31,891
oh, it must be love
you know it must be love

921
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:36,428
let me tell you now
something's got a hold
on me, yeah

922
01:21:36,496 --> 01:21:38,430
oh, it must be love

923
01:21:38,498 --> 01:21:43,002
oh, something's got a hold
on me right now, child

924
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:45,070
oh, it must be love

925
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,774
What are you gonna
say to 'em?

926
01:21:48,842 --> 01:21:52,377
You can't just
walk up and say, "hello.
My name is carly marshall,

927
01:21:52,445 --> 01:21:54,579
And you've been
contaminated."

928
01:21:54,647 --> 01:21:59,551
How about, "howdy, howdy.
Sure is nice to meet
some real cowboys."

929
01:21:59,619 --> 01:22:02,721
Didn't think there were
any of them left.
Maybe there aren't.

930
01:22:02,789 --> 01:22:06,926
Maybe they're
already dead.

931
01:22:06,993 --> 01:22:08,994
Oh, shut up.

932
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:19,839
hello there?

933
01:22:38,424 --> 01:22:41,861
There's a lady out there.
She wants to talk to you.

934
01:22:44,865 --> 01:22:47,199
My wife tells me
you're concerned
with our health.

935
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:53,072
Well, yes, I am.
Of course I am, but
mostly it's my husband.

936
01:22:53,373 --> 01:22:56,541
You see, he was in
a helicopter that day.
He saw it.

937
01:22:56,609 --> 01:23:01,180
- He tried to stop the test,
but it was too late.
- What's done is done.

938
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:05,084
The army, they're drugging him
and holding him against his will
in some mental hospital.

939
01:23:05,385 --> 01:23:08,153
<i>But you can help me.</i>

940
01:23:08,388 --> 01:23:11,023
How can we do that?

941
01:23:11,391 --> 01:23:14,960
I was just hoping that
you would come with me
to the newspapers.

942
01:23:15,028 --> 01:23:17,329
You see, you could
tell them just how sick
you've been...

943
01:23:17,397 --> 01:23:21,267
And how nobody,
nobody even bothered
to come by here...

944
01:23:21,334 --> 01:23:23,269
And explain to you
what had happened.

945
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:25,837
They would have
to understand that
my husband's not crazy.

946
01:23:25,906 --> 01:23:28,040
<i>He's not crazy at all.
Don't believe
we could do that.</i>

947
01:23:28,408 --> 01:23:32,011
It's true.
She's telling you the truth.

948
01:23:32,412 --> 01:23:36,415
It ain't our way.
We don't like
to make a fuss.

949
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:40,485
That's right. 'sides,
there's gonna be
another one tomorrow.

950
01:23:40,553 --> 01:23:42,721
For tomorrow morning,
about 10:00, 10:30, right?

951
01:23:42,789 --> 01:23:44,990
I'll tell you what.
We're gonna be out here
working, right, nick?

952
01:23:45,058 --> 01:23:47,726
<i>If my government tells me
there's no danger,</i>

953
01:23:47,794 --> 01:23:49,728
Then, by god,
I got to believe them.

954
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:53,732
Why, that-
I don't mean to be rude,
but that is so stupid.

955
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,769
That is just plain stupid.

956
01:23:57,938 --> 01:24:00,139
Mom, why don't we go?

957
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:05,744
Take this lady
back to the house
and tell her good-bye.

958
01:24:05,946 --> 01:24:08,047
Come on, sweetie.

959
01:24:08,448 --> 01:24:10,149
He's the boss.

960
01:24:10,216 --> 01:24:13,385
Good luck.

961
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:17,990
we've got
the pilot's letter and
we've got dad's reports.

962
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:21,493
Why don't we go
to the newspapers
without the cowboys?

963
01:24:21,561 --> 01:24:25,097
That's all we really need,
isn't it?

964
01:24:25,165 --> 01:24:27,232
Mom?

965
01:24:41,547 --> 01:24:43,648
Mom?

966
01:24:48,688 --> 01:24:51,023
Mom?

967
01:24:51,091 --> 01:24:53,392
Alex. Alex, wake up.

968
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:56,628
Alex, mom's gone.

969
01:25:32,532 --> 01:25:35,033
welcome to
our underground bunker.

970
01:25:35,035 --> 01:25:38,570
This is our test site today.

971
01:25:38,638 --> 01:25:41,240
The tower is used
to drill deep enough...

972
01:25:41,307 --> 01:25:43,542
To place the device
securely underground.

973
01:25:43,609 --> 01:25:46,311
The cables you see are linked
to monitor and record...

974
01:25:46,546 --> 01:25:49,548
Every reaction
the material may provoke.

975
01:25:51,051 --> 01:25:53,718
In this way, we can assure...

976
01:25:54,054 --> 01:25:58,057
Our full strength
and your full safety.

977
01:26:21,581 --> 01:26:24,183
Excuse me, general.
Who's that?

978
01:26:24,584 --> 01:26:26,685
<i>not again.</i>

979
01:26:27,087 --> 01:26:29,555
Abort detonation!

980
01:26:29,589 --> 01:26:33,092
Get a squad out there
immediately.

981
01:26:59,985 --> 01:27:02,954
Get off your horse.
You're under arrest.

982
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,662
ma'am!

983
01:27:33,085 --> 01:27:37,822
Aside from almost
blowing yourself sky high,
what the hell were you doing?

984
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:41,826
General, I am simply trying
to get my husband out of
a mental hospital.

985
01:27:41,894 --> 01:27:44,729
You are well on your way
to going there yourself.

986
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:51,302
Did you know that my father
is a very prominent
businessman?

987
01:27:51,604 --> 01:27:54,338
In fact, he owns...

988
01:27:54,406 --> 01:27:57,709
Several television stations
back home in virginia.

989
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:03,280
He has copies of those reports,
those classified reports,

990
01:28:03,616 --> 01:28:05,783
And if he doesn't
hear from me by noon today,
he's gonna release them...

991
01:28:05,851 --> 01:28:09,420
<i>To the, uh,
new york times.
Mrs. Marshall, please.</i>

992
01:28:09,622 --> 01:28:12,356
Threats and fantasies
don't help.

993
01:28:12,424 --> 01:28:14,926
The army knows
exactly who you are.

994
01:28:15,127 --> 01:28:17,629
<i>I know who you are.</i>

995
01:28:17,696 --> 01:28:20,331
And you know my husband.

996
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:25,737
You know that there is not
a crazy bone in his body.

997
01:28:25,804 --> 01:28:29,641
<i>Not as crazy
as his wife.</i>

998
01:28:31,376 --> 01:28:34,545
You know, I've been
called that all my life.

999
01:28:34,613 --> 01:28:39,017
That and a lot worse,
and it doesn't bother me
in the least.

1000
01:28:39,084 --> 01:28:42,353
You can tell people
whatever you want about me.

1001
01:28:42,655 --> 01:28:44,856
Just release my husband.

1002
01:28:44,923 --> 01:28:47,424
Mrs. Marshall,
we're not here
to make deals.

1003
01:28:47,492 --> 01:28:51,829
We can have you arrested
on 20 violations
and throw away the key.

1004
01:28:53,498 --> 01:28:56,000
And what are you gonna
tell those reporters?

1005
01:28:56,168 --> 01:28:59,370
Hmm? What are you
gonna tell those reporters
and their cameras?

1006
01:28:59,672 --> 01:29:01,505
I'm their story.

1007
01:29:01,674 --> 01:29:03,574
Today's newspaper
is tomorrow's trash.

1008
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:06,844
<i>- And I don't give
a goddamn-
- general. General.</i>

1009
01:29:11,249 --> 01:29:13,250
Mr. Stevens.

1010
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:20,792
My husband said
that you were a fair man.

1011
01:29:21,193 --> 01:29:22,894
Won't you help him?

1012
01:29:29,201 --> 01:29:32,737
Authorities at
a nuclear test site
in mercury, nevada,

1013
01:29:32,805 --> 01:29:35,439
Arrested an unidentified woman
this morning...

1014
01:29:35,507 --> 01:29:39,343
Who was attempting to interfere
with a scheduled weapons test.

1015
01:29:39,411 --> 01:29:41,645
hey, look!

1016
01:29:41,714 --> 01:29:44,015
That's mrs. Marshall!
That's mrs. Marshall!

1017
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:46,150
Mom, come here!
Mrs. Marshall's on tv! Mom!

1018
01:29:46,218 --> 01:29:48,552
according to the army,

1019
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:52,223
The woman was carrying
literature linking her
to the communist party.

1020
01:29:52,224 --> 01:29:54,525
The army also claimed...

1021
01:29:54,593 --> 01:29:57,995
The woman is a member
of a fundamentalist
religious sect.

1022
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:01,232
Officials refuse to disclose
the identity of the woman...

1023
01:30:01,299 --> 01:30:03,434
Goddamn bitch.
Pending further investigation.

1024
01:30:03,501 --> 01:30:07,271
The test has been postponed
due to weather conditions.

1025
01:30:07,339 --> 01:30:09,941
Also in the news,
members of the naacp-

1026
01:30:10,008 --> 01:30:13,577
Ben, this is the game plan.
Prepare discharge papers
for hank marshall right away.

1027
01:30:13,746 --> 01:30:18,249
We could be in deep shit.

1028
01:30:21,253 --> 01:30:23,254
What are you doing, dad?

1029
01:30:25,657 --> 01:30:29,160
I've gotta go to the base.

1030
01:30:29,228 --> 01:30:31,362
<i>You're gonna discharge
major marshall?</i>

1031
01:30:33,265 --> 01:30:35,599
You said he was dangerous.

1032
01:30:35,667 --> 01:30:39,270
You said he was crazy,
he was mentally ill.

1033
01:30:39,337 --> 01:30:44,876
He is, but it's
a little more complicated
than that, glenn.

1034
01:30:45,277 --> 01:30:48,913
- It's a military matter, okay?
- I thought this was
a matter of justice.

1035
01:30:48,981 --> 01:30:51,282
That's what I told alex
when she said
her dad was framed.

1036
01:30:51,283 --> 01:30:53,785
I've got to go.

1037
01:30:55,453 --> 01:30:57,521
This doesn't concern you, son.

1038
01:30:59,858 --> 01:31:03,227
I used to be proud when
you called me your son.

1039
01:31:03,295 --> 01:31:07,098
All my life,
you've lectured me
about honor and justice...

1040
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:09,667
And the johnson
tradition.

1041
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:12,303
I believed all that.

1042
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:18,042
Those words lost their meaning
for your father a while ago.

1043
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:22,313
This is a personal war
between a man and a woman
that he wanted to screw.

1044
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:25,582
It's as simple
as that, glenn.

1045
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:28,820
Just get me
out of here.
Glenn!

1046
01:31:29,721 --> 01:31:31,989
Dr. Vankay's
waiting for you, colonel.

1047
01:31:38,763 --> 01:31:41,765
Vince.
Ben, is everything okay?

1048
01:31:43,035 --> 01:31:45,002
What the hell are you
doing here, george?

1049
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:48,840
I was ordered here, vince,
by general nieremberg.

1050
01:31:48,907 --> 01:31:51,008
To do what?
I was ordered...

1051
01:31:51,343 --> 01:31:53,945
To provide for the safe
treatment and the discharge
of hank marshall.

1052
01:31:54,296 --> 01:31:57,765
I was also ordered
to relieve you as
commanding officer,

1053
01:31:57,883 --> 01:32:00,985
Pending further orders,
effective immediately.

1054
01:32:19,804 --> 01:32:22,340
Ohh. You just sleep,
babies.

1055
01:32:28,747 --> 01:32:31,415
Ohh.

1056
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,654
Ow.

1057
01:32:37,722 --> 01:32:39,891
what's wrong?

1058
01:32:46,098 --> 01:32:48,732
My leg fell asleep.

1059
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,770
We've been driving
for two days.

1060
01:32:56,975 --> 01:33:00,211
I wanted to get here
as fast as I could.

1061
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:08,419
I didn't know
if you would be waiting.

1062
01:33:11,555 --> 01:33:14,957
Next base,
I'll be different,
I promise.

1063
01:33:19,863 --> 01:33:22,699
There won't be a next base.
I've quit the army.

1064
01:33:31,374 --> 01:33:33,776
Oh, the girls
are gonna be real...

1065
01:33:36,413 --> 01:33:38,715
Happy to hear that.

1066
01:33:40,317 --> 01:33:42,384
What about you,
mrs. Marshall?

1067
01:33:44,354 --> 01:33:46,388
Are you happy?

1068
01:33:52,495 --> 01:33:54,530
Only if you still want me.

1069
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:05,241
Come here.

1070
01:34:37,074 --> 01:34:39,675
Sir, aren't you
gonna find teaching
to be a little bit tame?

1071
01:34:39,743 --> 01:34:42,444
When I was in nevada, son,
I decided I could no longer
contribute...

1072
01:34:42,512 --> 01:34:44,914
In any manner
to nuclear warfare.

1073
01:34:44,982 --> 01:34:47,416
I think the university is
a perfectly fine place...

1074
01:34:47,484 --> 01:34:50,887
To twist innocent young minds
over to my point of view,
don't you agree?

1075
01:34:50,954 --> 01:34:55,424
<i>- Oh!
- Can you see mom
as a professor's wife?</i>

1076
01:34:55,492 --> 01:34:58,661
It is california.
Maybe things are
a little looser there.

1077
01:34:58,796 --> 01:35:01,463
<i>Daddy, I want a shot
of you and glenn.
What?</i>

1078
01:35:01,531 --> 01:35:03,766
I want a shot
of you and glenn.

1079
01:35:03,801 --> 01:35:06,802
Come on. Get closer.

1080
01:35:06,804 --> 01:35:08,771
Closer.

1081
01:35:10,808 --> 01:35:13,309
wow!

1082
01:35:17,614 --> 01:35:21,117
<i>Great car, mom!
what have you done?</i>

1083
01:35:21,185 --> 01:35:23,119
We're going
to california, daddy.

1084
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:26,956
We can't drive up in front
of the brown derby
in that old jalopy.

1085
01:35:27,024 --> 01:35:30,159
<i>I liked
that old jalopy.</i>

1086
01:35:30,227 --> 01:35:33,162
Now, nobody has said
anything about my hair.

1087
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:36,664
- You look like
elizabeth taylor.
- There.

1088
01:35:36,732 --> 01:35:39,500
You have said
the secret word,

1089
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:42,170
And you qualify for a ride
in my new convertible.

1090
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:45,706
Come on, sweet boy.

1091
01:35:45,775 --> 01:35:49,677
Well, let's go.
Come on, daddy.
You drive.

1092
01:35:53,082 --> 01:35:59,954
<i></i>

1093
01:36:00,022 --> 01:36:04,859
<i>well, now, it takes
more than a robin</i>

1094
01:36:04,927 --> 01:36:07,695
<i>to make the winter go</i>

1095
01:36:07,763 --> 01:36:12,100
<i>and it takes
two lips of fire</i>

1096
01:36:12,167 --> 01:36:15,103
<i>to melt away the snow</i>

1097
01:36:15,171 --> 01:36:19,174
well, it takes
two hearts a-cookin'

1098
01:36:19,241 --> 01:36:22,310
to make a fire grow

1099
01:36:22,377 --> 01:36:24,745
and, baby

1100
01:36:24,814 --> 01:36:26,781
you've got what it takes

1101
01:36:26,849 --> 01:36:29,117
<i>oh, yeah</i>

1102
01:36:29,185 --> 01:36:32,720
you know it takes
a lot of kissin'

1103
01:36:32,788 --> 01:36:35,957
<i>Tell me about it.
to make a romance sweet</i>

1104
01:36:36,025 --> 01:36:40,929
<i>Aha.
ooh, it takes
a lot of lovin'</i>

1105
01:36:40,996 --> 01:36:43,464
to make my life complete

1106
01:36:43,532 --> 01:36:48,402
<i>mmm, and it takes
a lot of woman</i>

1107
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,405
<i>to knock me
off my feet</i>

1108
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:53,741
<i>and, baby</i>

1109
01:36:53,809 --> 01:36:56,544
<i>you've got
what it takes</i>

1110
01:36:58,247 --> 01:37:03,985
I said
mmm hmm hmm mmm

1111
01:37:05,587 --> 01:37:09,824
uh-huh, mmm

1112
01:37:09,892 --> 01:37:13,127
<i>you know you've got
just what it takes</i>

1113
01:37:13,195 --> 01:37:17,732
<i>because it takes
more than an effort</i>

1114
01:37:17,799 --> 01:37:21,135
<i>to stay away from you</i>

1115
01:37:21,203 --> 01:37:24,538
<i>it'd take more
than a lifetime</i>

1116
01:37:24,606 --> 01:37:27,441
<i>to prove
that I'll be true</i>

1117
01:37:27,509 --> 01:37:31,612
but it takes
somebody special

1118
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,815
<i>to make me say, "I do"
oh, yeah?</i>

1119
01:37:34,884 --> 01:37:37,151

1120
01:37:37,219 --> 01:37:39,820

<i>you know you've got

1124
01:37:56,638 --> 01:38:00,574
<i>Because- you're back
in my spot again, honey.
I like your spot.</i>

1125
01:38:00,642 --> 01:38:03,878
<i>to stay away from you
I can't stay away.
Let's do it again.</i>

1126
01:38:03,946 --> 01:38:07,648
<i>it takes more than
a lifetime, daddy
oh, yeah.</i>

1127
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:10,818
to prove that I'll be true
now it's you.

1128
01:38:10,886 --> 01:38:15,456
<i>but it takes
somebody special
like me, baby.</i>

1129
01:38:15,524 --> 01:38:18,126
<i>to make me say I do</i>

1130
01:38:18,193 --> 01:38:20,494

1131
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:22,563

1132
01:38:22,631 --> 01:38:25,333
<i>Say it again.
Come on. Let's do it
one more time, all right?</i>

1133
01:38:25,401 --> 01:38:27,535
and, baby

1134
01:38:27,602 --> 01:38:29,737

<i>One more time, brook.
All right, okay.</i>
