00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,942
<b>ANNOUNCER:</b><b><i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i></b>
<b><i>Martha Kelly.</i></b>

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,478
<b>(crowd cheering)</b>

4
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,455
<b>Um, it's really great</b>
<b>to be in New Orleans.</b>

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,792
<b>I, um, I live in Austin,</b>
<b>but I'm from California,</b>

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,759
<b>and my whole family</b>
<b>is still out there.</b>

7
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,668
<b>And I miss them a lot.</b>

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,500
<b>Um, especially my niece and</b>
<b>nephew, who are really little.</b>

9
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,937
<b>I'm really close to them.</b>

10
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,372
<b>When they were babies,</b>
<b>I saw them almost every day,</b>

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:41,137
<b>and those bonds</b>
<b>really changed my life.</b>

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,248
<b>But they didn't change</b>
<b>my decision</b>

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,110
<b>not to have kids of my own.</b>

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,779
<b>And, uh...</b>

15
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,917
<b>It's not 'cause I don't think</b>
<b>they're great.</b>

16
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,982
<b>I love kids and babies, but, um,</b>

17
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,652
<b>there's just a big difference</b>
<b>between loving babies</b>

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,661
<b>and wanting to be a parent.</b>

19
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,563
<b>Um, to me, those two things</b>
<b>are as different</b>

20
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:03,026
<b>as loving roller coasters and</b>
<b>wanting to (bleep) a carnie.</b>

21
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,766
<b>(laughter)</b>
<b>So...</b>

22
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,337
<b>Just...</b>

23
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,243
<b>breaking the ice</b>
<b>with the F-word.</b>

24
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,376
<b>Uh...</b>

25
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,481
<b>But also just, um, to be clear,</b>

26
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,514
<b>there's nothing wrong</b>
<b>with making love to someone</b>

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,850
<b>who works at a carnival,</b>

28
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,285
<b>so please don't be offended.</b>

29
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,291
<b>(sighs) Um...</b>

30
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,725
<b>One of the four times that</b>
<b>I've moved from L.A. to Austin,</b>

31
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,393
<b>I drove there,</b>

32
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:38,731
<b>uh, with my four cats</b>
<b>and my dog in the car.</b>

33
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,839
<b>And, um, I rented a giant SUV,</b>

34
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,342
<b>and I put these big kennels</b>
<b>in the back for the cats</b>

35
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,204
<b>where I had</b>
<b>food and water dishes</b>

36
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,613
<b>and litter boxes and blankets.</b>

37
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,975
<b>But even with</b>
<b>all those amenities,</b>

38
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,314
<b>there were a lot</b>
<b>of angry accusations</b>

39
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,680
<b>coming from the back of the car.</b>

40
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,619
<b>Um, for a couple hours.</b>

41
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,225
<b>And then it just got</b>
<b>completely silent.</b>

42
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,229
<b>And that made me</b>
<b>kind of nervous,</b>

43
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,231
<b>'cause I didn't know if maybe</b>
<b>they were planning something.</b>

44
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:12,004
<b>So, I just pulled over</b>
<b>and I called a family meeting,</b>

45
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,935
<b>and I just, um...</b>

46
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,872
<b>I explained to the cats, like,</b>

47
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,207
<b>"I know that this drive</b>
<b>across country is difficult,</b>

48
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:23,714
<b>"but living in Austin again</b>
<b>is gonna make life better</b>

49
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:24,877
<b>"for all of us.</b>

50
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:28,315
<b>"And there is no (meows)</b>

51
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,382
<b>"in 'team.'</b>

52
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,690
<b>"So, please, uh...</b>

53
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,425
<b>get with it." Um...</b>

54
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,591
<b>A little bit of trivia.</b>

55
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,561
<b>Um, all five of those pets</b>
<b>are dead now.</b>

56
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:49,701
<b>And, uh, not--</b>
<b>it wasn't from foul play.</b>

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,810
<b>Uh, they got old and then sick,</b>

58
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,412
<b>and then you have to</b>
<b>put them to sleep,</b>

59
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,043
<b>which is the heartbreaking part</b>
<b>of having pets.</b>

60
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,909
<b>They don't live</b>
<b>as long as we do.</b>

61
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,948
<b>But I got another dog</b>
<b>and a kitten.</b>

62
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,554
<b>And, like, you just have to stay</b>
<b>on-on the ride,</b>

63
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,787
<b>you can't get off.</b>

64
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,553
<b>When they die, you have to just</b>
<b>keep getting more pets</b>

65
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,062
<b>until you die.</b>

66
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,393
<b>And, um...</b>

67
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,627
<b>But you have-- you do have to</b>
<b>put them to sleep</b>

68
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,097
<b>so that-- I mean, you ha--</b>
<b>I mean, you have to kill them.</b>

69
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,666
<b>So they won't...</b>

70
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,664
<b>(chuckles)</b>

71
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,975
<b>So they won't suffer.</b>

72
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,376
<b>Like, that's your duty.</b>

73
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,939
<b>And the first one</b>
<b>that I had to do that with,</b>

74
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,008
<b>I was not at all</b>
<b>emotionally prepared for it,</b>

75
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,778
<b>and, um...</b>

76
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,616
<b>I hired a vet to come</b>
<b>to the house and do it,</b>

77
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,422
<b>so that my cat wouldn't</b>
<b>have to go through the stress</b>

78
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,925
<b>of a car ride</b>
<b>and an office visit.</b>

79
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:44,228
<b>So the vet came to the house,</b>
<b>and I held my cat in my arms,</b>

80
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,931
<b>and they gave her the shots.</b>

81
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,563
<b>And she went very peacefully.</b>

82
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:48,928
<b>And then the vet left,</b>

83
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,766
<b>and then I just sat there</b>
<b>with my cat in my arms,</b>

84
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,972
<b>crying and holding her</b>

85
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,634
<b>for, like, a half hour;</b>
<b>I just couldn't put her down.</b>

86
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,373
<b>And mostly I was crying</b>
<b>from grief,</b>

87
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,179
<b>but there were also</b>
<b>a few tears of triumph</b>

88
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,342
<b>because she never let me</b>
<b>hold her like that</b>

89
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,311
<b>when she was alive.</b>

90
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,120
<b>So...</b>

91
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,723
<b>Uh...</b>

92
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,655
<b>Kind of...</b>

93
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,291
<b>I kind of won that round,</b>
<b>uh, with her.</b>

94
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,298
<b>(chuckles)</b>

95
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,859
<b>Um...</b>

96
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,000
<b>It doesn't,</b>
<b>doesn't get any easier.</b>

97
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:29,235
<b>The, um, last of those five</b>
<b>original pets</b>

98
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:32,043
<b>I had to put her to sleep</b>
<b>this past January.</b>

99
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,475
<b>She was 19,</b>

100
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,780
<b>and I got her when she was just</b>
<b>a couple weeks old.</b>

101
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,913
<b>It was a-- one of the cats.</b>

102
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,318
<b>And, um...</b>

103
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,149
<b>and, again, I had a vet</b>
<b>come to the house.</b>

104
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:42,685
<b>It was really hard.</b>

105
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,649
<b>I was-- it really hit me hard.</b>

106
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,258
<b>And it was at least</b>
<b>a couple of weeks</b>

107
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,491
<b>before I could even</b>

108
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,525
<b>bring myself to go through</b>
<b>her belongings.</b>

109
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,292
<b>But...</b>

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,860
<b>I finally did, um,</b>

111
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:58,198
<b>and when I was in her section</b>
<b>of the closet, I found...</b>

112
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:03,305
<b>um, a letter with my name on it.</b>

113
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,940
<b>So I'm just gonna read it...</b>

114
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,846
<b>really quickly.</b>

115
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,178
<b>Um...</b>

116
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,814
<b>If I can unfold it.</b>

117
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,480
<b>Um...</b>

118
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,048
<b>(clears throat) Excuse me.</b>

119
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,086
<b>Okay.</b>

120
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,150
<b>(sighs)</b>

121
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,788
<b>Um, "Dear Martha,</b>

122
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:23,523
<b>"if you've found this,</b>
<b>it means that I've passed away.</b>

123
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,590
<b>"I'm sure</b>
<b>you're very sad about it,</b>

124
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,629
<b>"but I want you to know</b>
<b>that I had a good life with you</b>

125
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,995
<b>"and, if I could have, I</b>
<b>would've lived with you forever.</b>

126
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,505
<b>"Please take comfort in the fact</b>
<b>that I'm no longer suffering</b>

127
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,109
<b>"and know that,</b>
<b>if there is an afterlife,</b>

128
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,342
<b>"I will try to find you there.</b>

129
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:45,647
<b>"In regards to settling</b>
<b>my affairs here on Earth,</b>

130
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,912
<b>"there is one situation</b>
<b>I got into</b>

131
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,281
<b>"that will require</b>
<b>your attention.</b>

132
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,790
<b>"The other day, I overheard you</b>
<b>speaking to a vet on the phone</b>

133
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,925
<b>"about in-home euthanasia,</b>

134
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,130
<b>"and I misunderstood</b>
<b>the nature of that call.</b>

135
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,264
<b>"While I knew</b>
<b>I was on the decline,</b>

136
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,429
<b>"I thought for a moment</b>
<b>that you were making plans</b>

137
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,738
<b>"to kill the dog as sort of</b>
<b>a Make-A-Wish Foundation</b>

138
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,971
<b>"gift to me.</b>

139
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,008
<b>"So I rented a party bus</b>
<b>with your credit card.</b>

140
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,247
<b>"Despite leaving you</b>
<b>in a bit of a pickle,</b>

141
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,714
<b>"I hope you will</b>
<b>remember me fondly.</b>

142
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,383
<b>"I know I wasn't a perfect cat,</b>

143
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,651
<b>"but I loved you</b>
<b>with all my heart.</b>

144
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,090
<b>"In light of that fact,</b>

145
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:31,455
<b>"please do me the favor</b>
<b>of honoring my dying wish.</b>

146
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,825
<b>"I know you plan</b>
<b>to have me cremated,</b>

147
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,494
<b>"so when you get my ashes back,</b>
<b>if it's not too much trouble,</b>

148
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,364
<b>could you please throw them</b>
<b>in the dog's face?"</b>

149
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,734
<b>Uh, well...</b>

150
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,003
<b>I don't know if I'll honor that.</b>

151
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,431
<b>Obviously, I love animals a lot.</b>

152
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,863
<b>And, um, I recently have</b>
<b>become a vegetarian,</b>

153
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,500
<b>and also</b>
<b>kind of an animal activist.</b>

154
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,207
<b>Um, I'm not in PETA,</b>

155
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:01,168
<b>but I have watched</b><b><i>Blackfish</i></b>
<b>a bunch of times.</b>

<b>(laughter)</b>

157
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:04,973
<b>And, uh, I bring it up</b>
<b>at the drop of a hat.</b>

158
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,882
<b>And if you haven't seen it,</b>

159
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:09,044
<b>it's a documentary about</b>
<b>this killer whale</b>

160
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,852
<b>that was captured from the wild</b>
<b>when he was a baby.</b>

161
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:14,185
<b>And he's lived in captivity</b>
<b>his whole life</b>

162
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,591
<b>and he's killed three people.</b>

163
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:18,092
<b>And the last one</b>
<b>was his trainer.</b>

164
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:21,695
<b>And, um, he's not the only</b>
<b>killer whale in captivity</b>

165
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:23,458
<b>that has attacked trainers.</b>

166
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,167
<b>There's another one</b>
<b>that killed a trainer.</b>

167
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,999
<b>And then there's a bunch of 'em</b>
<b>that have attacked</b>

168
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,835
<b>and injured trainers.</b>

169
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,240
<b>And... SeaWorld has been around</b>

170
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:34,803
<b>for over 50 years now.</b>

171
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,972
<b>I just feel like it should be</b>
<b>really obvious at this point</b>

172
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,741
<b>that we need to stop encouraging</b>
<b>these whales to pursue careers</b>

173
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:43,512
<b>in show business,</b>

174
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,220
<b>because they are</b>
<b>super unprofessional</b>

175
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:49,583
<b>and...</b>

176
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,023
<b>they should...</b>

177
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,018
<b>(crowd cheering)</b>

178
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,659
<b>Oh, well...</b>

179
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,469
<b>Thanks, guys.</b>

180
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:02,901
<b>I was kind of nervous about</b>
<b>taking a drink of water.</b>

181
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,266
<b>I was afraid</b>
<b>I was gonna accidentally</b>

182
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,904
<b>throw it in my face, but, um...</b>

183
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,210
<b>Little...</b>
<b>a little high energy. Um...</b>

184
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:13,512
<b>Sorry.</b>

185
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,317
<b>Um, I also--</b>

186
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,250
<b>one of my other radical ideas</b>
<b>about animal rights is:</b>

187
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:23,217
<b>I don't think that we should</b>
<b>ride horses anymore.</b>

188
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,627
<b>I feel like they really hate it.</b>

189
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:28,459
<b>Um, they have to hate it,</b>
<b>because if they didn't,</b>

190
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,425
<b>then how come</b>
<b>we never see horses</b>

191
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:34,164
<b>giving rides to other animals</b>
<b>in the wild?</b>

192
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,971
<b>It seems like...</b>

193
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,804
<b>something they would do.</b>

194
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:41,309
<b>It would be super cute. Um...</b>

195
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:46,474
<b>The, uh--</b>
<b>speaking of the Wild West--</b>

196
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,913
<b>not really,</b>
<b>but just in lieu of a segue,</b>

197
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:51,019
<b>um...</b>

198
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,681
<b>the first time</b>
<b>that I moved to Austin, Texas,</b>

199
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,091
<b>was in, uh, the year 2000.</b>

200
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:00,454
<b>And I moved there</b>
<b>and hit the ground running,</b>

201
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:03,324
<b>and I went out drinking</b>
<b>and smoking every single night</b>

202
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:05,263
<b>for a year straight.</b>

203
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,129
<b>And it was really fun</b>
<b>for awhile,</b>

204
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:08,367
<b>but after a few months,</b>

205
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:10,672
<b>I started to feel</b>
<b>a little bit weird,</b>

206
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,774
<b>because before</b>
<b>I moved to Austin,</b>

207
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:16,076
<b>I had kind of imagined myself</b>
<b>becoming a new person</b>

208
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,609
<b>once I lived there.</b>

209
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,244
<b>It just had never occurred to me</b>

210
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,979
<b>that that person</b>
<b>might be Nick Nolte.</b>

211
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:26,188
<b>Bless his heart.</b>

212
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,190
<b>Um...</b>

213
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:33,422
<b>I quit drinking</b>
<b>in December of 2003 and, um,</b>

214
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,660
<b>I like being so...</b>
<b>(crowd cheering)</b>

215
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,295
<b>Well, let's not</b>
<b>get carried away.</b>

216
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,200
<b>Um... (chuckles)</b>

217
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:40,432
<b>It's fine. Like, I'm glad.</b>

218
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,437
<b>I actually-- I like being sober.</b>

219
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,369
<b>I'm used to it now,</b>

220
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:47,334
<b>but in the beginning,</b>
<b>I did not like it.</b>

221
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:48,574
<b>It was really hard,</b>

222
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,679
<b>and, uh, for awhile,</b>
<b>I just hated it.</b>

223
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:53,811
<b>And then after a few months,</b>
<b>I realized that</b>

224
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:57,817
<b>since I was no longer spending</b>
<b>every night getting drunk</b>

225
00:09:57,881 --> 00:10:00,621
<b>and then every day</b>
<b>recovering from the hangovers,</b>

226
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,584
<b>I had time and energy for stuff</b>
<b>I'd never done before,</b>

227
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:07,055
<b>like crying</b>
<b>and cussing at strangers.</b>

228
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,199
<b>So, it's fun.</b>

229
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,301
<b>I, um...</b>

230
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,303
<b>I have a twin sister</b>
<b>and, um, she's a writer</b>

231
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,206
<b>and she got a book published.</b>

232
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,668
<b>And she's a great writer.</b>

233
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:22,006
<b>I'm really proud of her</b>
<b>for getting her book published.</b>

234
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:24,472
<b>Um, I can't read it</b>

235
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,341
<b>because it's a memoir</b>
<b>about when she worked</b>

236
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:29,311
<b>in the S and M industry,</b>

237
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,049
<b>and I just can't, uh,</b>
<b>can't read it. Uh...</b>

238
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:36,916
<b>I don't mean to be</b>
<b>judgmental about it.</b>

239
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:39,357
<b>Like, um, it's just that</b>
<b>we're really different.</b>

240
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,363
<b>Like, I would never ever</b>
<b>write a book</b>

241
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,025
<b>about my sexcapades.</b>

242
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:46,933
<b>Um, partly because I'm really</b>
<b>private about that stuff,</b>

243
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:49,637
<b>but also because</b>
<b>none of the sex I've had</b>

244
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,570
<b>really qualifies as "scapades."</b>

245
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:56,036
<b>So... can't really...</b>

246
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,276
<b>do it. Um...</b>

247
00:10:57,341 --> 00:11:00,581
<b>I always wanted to know</b>
<b>what it feels like</b>

248
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:03,314
<b>to be one of those</b>
<b>super organized people,</b>

249
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,380
<b>and so, a couple weeks ago,</b>
<b>I cleaned my whole apartment.</b>

250
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,850
<b>And I put all my stuff</b>
<b>in boxes.</b>

251
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,519
<b>And that felt</b>
<b>kind of interesting.</b>

252
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,527
<b>So then I went</b>
<b>and got a label maker.</b>

253
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,789
<b>And I put labels</b>
<b>on each of the boxes</b>

254
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:16,528
<b>according to what was inside.</b>

255
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,533
<b>And so, now I just have</b>
<b>this box of razor blades</b>

256
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,096
<b>that says "Plan B" on it.</b>

257
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,367
<b>So...</b>

258
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,205
<b>that's not... that's kind of...</b>

259
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:31,643
<b>Too much, ma'am.</b>

260
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,708
<b>(chuckles)</b>

261
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,676
<b>Ma'am or sir, um...</b>

262
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,479
<b>I, um...</b>

263
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:41,949
<b>The other night, I was</b>
<b>in the middle of a freestyle</b>

264
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,289
<b>TV watching jam session.</b>

265
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:49,194
<b>And, uh, I came across</b>
<b>my favorite show,</b>

266
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,659
<b>which is an infomercial</b>
<b>for a product</b>

267
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:53,768
<b>called the Total Trolley.</b>

268
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:55,431
<b>And it's a great product.</b>

269
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:58,439
<b>It's a ladder that,</b>
<b>when you put it on its side,</b>

270
00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:01,872
<b>um, wheels pop out and you can</b>
<b>push furniture on it.</b>

271
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,779
<b>I'm not really sure</b>
<b>what it does,</b>

272
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:06,141
<b>but the reason</b>
<b>I love that infomercial</b>

273
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,750
<b>is because</b>
<b>of the customer testimonials.</b>

274
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,212
<b>Because they're all</b>
<b>really heartfelt.</b>

275
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:13,121
<b>And the best one is this guy</b>

276
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,783
<b>who looks straight</b>
<b>into the camera</b>

277
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:18,692
<b>and says, "We use the Total</b>
<b>Trolley so much at our house</b>

278
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,325
<b>"that we've started</b>
<b>to think of it</b>

279
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,160
<b>as a member of our family."</b>

280
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:23,796
<b>And, um...</b>

281
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,862
<b>To be honest,</b>

282
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,430
<b>I kind of fell in love with him</b>
<b>when I saw that,</b>

283
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,040
<b>and want to--</b>
<b>kind of want to marry him,</b>

284
00:12:32,102 --> 00:12:34,872
<b>'cause I feel like</b>
<b>what an open heart</b>

285
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:38,038
<b>that you will accept</b>
<b>literally anything</b>

286
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:40,048
<b>into your family.</b>

287
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,050
<b>Um, but also,</b>
<b>I just would love to</b>

288
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,113
<b>get to go</b>
<b>to their family reunions</b>

289
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,452
<b>so I could meet</b>
<b>Uncle Total Trolley.</b>

290
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:52,888
<b>And, uh, maybe his wife,</b>
<b>Swiffer Mop, would come.</b>

291
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:54,556
<b>That's dumb. Um...</b>

292
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,576
<b>I used to work</b>
<b>in offices a lot.</b>

293
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,414
<b>And the last job I had,</b>
<b>I got through a temp agency.</b>

294
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,651
<b>They called me</b>
<b>on a Friday and said</b>

295
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,617
<b>they had an assignment for me</b>
<b>starting the following Monday.</b>

296
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,126
<b>And it had been a while</b>
<b>since I worked in an office,</b>

297
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,889
<b>so I thought I should probably</b>
<b>do something over the weekend</b>

298
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,258
<b>to prepare to get back into</b>
<b>all the typing and filing</b>

299
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,328
<b>and phone answering</b>
<b>and whatnot.</b>

300
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,237
<b>So what I did is I had</b>
<b>a friend of mine go with me</b>

301
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,170
<b>down to the local swimming pool,</b>

302
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,275
<b>and I had him tie me up</b>
<b>in a burlap sack</b>

303
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,978
<b>and sink me</b>
<b>to the bottom of the pool.</b>

304
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,311
<b>(laughter)</b>

305
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,916
<b>And then right</b>
<b>when I was about to suffocate,</b>

306
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,448
<b>he yanked me up</b>
<b>and gave me a lunch break.</b>

307
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,985
<b>And then...</b>
<b>(crowd cheering)</b>

308
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,190
<b>No.</b>

309
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,652
<b>That was... (laughs)</b>

310
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,991
<b>Well...</b>

311
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,827
<b>that's very, very sweet.</b>

312
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,093
<b>You might be overreacting. Uh...</b>

313
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,803
<b>Um, at that job,</b>
<b>for one project...</b>

314
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,037
<b>Their whole-- the building--</b>

315
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,671
<b>the whole basement</b>
<b>was just file cabinets.</b>

316
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,377
<b>So for one project,</b>
<b>they had me go down there</b>

317
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,340
<b>and I filed every day,</b>
<b>all day, for two weeks straight.</b>

318
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,411
<b>And at the end</b>
<b>of that two weeks,</b>

319
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,219
<b>it finally occurred to me</b>
<b>I'd probably be better off</b>

320
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,052
<b>if I just went ahead</b>
<b>and joined a cult.</b>

321
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,158
<b>Because at least in a cult,</b>

322
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,190
<b>when they suck</b>
<b>the life force out of you,</b>

323
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,456
<b>they throw in some group sex</b>
<b>and a weird haircut.</b>

324
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,034
<b>And that's kind of fun.</b>

325
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:28,837
<b>There was a period of time</b>
<b>between odd jobs</b>

326
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,072
<b>and starting to make a living</b>
<b>with, um, stand-up</b>

327
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,837
<b>where I thought about</b>

328
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:36,746
<b>changing careers and maybe</b>
<b>becoming a motivational speaker.</b>

329
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,150
<b>And I had this idea</b>
<b>for a seminar</b>

330
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,853
<b>that I could give called</b>

331
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,685
<b>"The Encounters with Depression</b>
<b>Power Weekend."</b>

332
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:49,052
<b>And there were gonna be</b>
<b>three, uh, classes.</b>

333
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:53,492
<b>And at-- the first one is called</b>
<b>"Potato Chips: Friend or Foe?"</b>

334
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,430
<b>Um... the second one</b>

335
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,966
<b>was "Going Outside</b>
<b>and Other Tales of Courage."</b>

336
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,305
<b>And then the last one</b>
<b>was called</b>

337
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,671
<b>"Sleeping It Off:</b>

338
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,479
<b>It's Never Too Early</b>
<b>to Go Back to Bed."</b>

339
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,141
<b>So...</b>

340
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,580
<b>(applause)</b>
<b>Well...</b>

341
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,958
<b>Thanks, guys. Um...</b>

342
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,660
<b>You might not be able</b>
<b>to tell because I'm up</b>

343
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,662
<b>on an elevated stage,</b>
<b>but I'm actually quite short.</b>

344
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,996
<b>And, um, I don't mind</b>
<b>being short.</b>

345
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,232
<b>It's not a problem</b>
<b>most of the time.</b>

346
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,598
<b>There's one thing</b>
<b>that is a problem, which is</b>

347
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,707
<b>there's a segment</b>
<b>of the population</b>

348
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,410
<b>that believes</b>
<b>that short adults</b>

349
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,072
<b>remain childlike, in that</b>

350
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:46,382
<b>we enjoy the sensation</b>
<b>of being lifted off our feet.</b>

351
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,846
<b>And, um,</b>
<b>I feel totally comfortable</b>

352
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,086
<b>speaking for every</b>
<b>short person in the world</b>

353
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,252
<b>in saying we don't</b>
<b>like that at all.</b>

354
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,061
<b>We don't like being picked up.</b>

355
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,663
<b>Don't... do not pick up</b>
<b>a fellow adult,</b>

356
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,196
<b>no matter how short they are.</b>

357
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,902
<b>It's really uncomfortable.</b>

358
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,464
<b>Um, it's never like the movies</b>
<b>where you're like, "Whee!"</b>

359
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:11,004
<b>It's always like you're--</b>
<b>they almost drop you.</b>

360
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,511
<b>Um... and then, like,</b>

361
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,313
<b>your shirt pulls up</b>
<b>in the back.</b>

362
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,745
<b>Um...</b>

363
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,550
<b>It's really...</b>

364
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:23,112
<b>It's actually traumatic, um,</b>
<b>when I remember it.</b>

365
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,083
<b>There's one exception</b>
<b>to that rule.</b>

366
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,591
<b>There's one time where I think</b>

367
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,693
<b>it's okay with short people</b>
<b>if you pick them up.</b>

368
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:33,396
<b>And that's-- this is</b>
<b>how that scenario goes.</b>

369
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,060
<b>You see someone</b>
<b>coming towards you</b>

370
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,128
<b>with the intention</b>
<b>to pick you up.</b>

371
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,197
<b>And it's usually a guy.</b>

372
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,665
<b>And it's almost always someone</b>
<b>who's had a few drinks.</b>

373
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,806
<b>And you put your hand out.</b>
<b>You're like, "Stop.</b>

374
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,811
<b>"Don't do it.</b>
<b>I don't want you to pick me up.</b>

375
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,513
<b>Do not do that."</b>

376
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,475
<b>And he ignores you and comes in</b>
<b>and picks you up anyway</b>

377
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,384
<b>and then grunts in pain</b>

378
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,346
<b>because you're heavier</b>
<b>than he expected you to be.</b>

379
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:00,016
<b>If it ends with a trip</b>
<b>to urgent care,</b>

380
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,986
<b>then it's totally fine</b>
<b>to pick up a short person.</b>

381
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:06,256
<b>Otherwise, don't do it.</b>

382
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,466
<b>I, um, grew up</b>
<b>outside of Los Angeles</b>

383
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,099
<b>and lived in the city for a</b>
<b>while when I was a young adult.</b>

384
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,665
<b>And I found it to be</b>
<b>kind of a scary place.</b>

385
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,674
<b>There's just so many people.</b>

386
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,336
<b>One scary thing</b>
<b>that happened to me is, uh,</b>

387
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,277
<b>I was at a stoplight,</b>
<b>and I used to have</b>

388
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,242
<b>an old, uh,</b>
<b>'71 Volkswagen Bug.</b>

389
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,782
<b>And they don't have</b>
<b>air conditioning,</b>

390
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,646
<b>so I always had</b>
<b>my windows rolled down.</b>

391
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,115
<b>And I was at this stoplight,</b>

392
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,853
<b>and a guy in a car next to me</b>
<b>started talking to me.</b>

393
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,190
<b>And at first, he was</b>
<b>talking to me about the car,</b>

394
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,756
<b>which I didn't think</b>
<b>was a big deal</b>

395
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,964
<b>because some people</b>
<b>are into old Bugs.</b>

396
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,596
<b>But, um, when the light changed,</b>

397
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,602
<b>I was really relieved</b>
<b>and I tried to speed away,</b>

398
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,606
<b>but in a Volkswagen Bug,</b>

399
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,608
<b>it's a little difficult</b>
<b>to speed away,</b>

400
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,870
<b>so he caught up to me</b>
<b>at the next light.</b>

401
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,709
<b>And he started talking again.</b>

402
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,144
<b>And finally he goes,</b>
<b>"Hey, why don't you give me</b>

403
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,550
<b>your phone number and we could</b>
<b>go out for coffee sometime?"</b>

404
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,884
<b>And then I thought about it</b>
<b>and was like,</b>

405
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,790
<b>"Um, how about</b>
<b>I'll just meet you naked</b>

406
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,722
<b>at a shallow grave</b>
<b>and you can push me in?"</b>

407
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,059
<b>'Cause...</b>
<b>(laughter)</b>

408
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,324
<b>that's clearly</b>
<b>where we're headed.</b>

409
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,863
<b>And...</b>

410
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,329
<b>we don't need</b>
<b>to bring coffee into it.</b>

411
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,438
<b>Um... if that's</b>
<b>what's happening.</b>

412
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,441
<b>Um...</b>

413
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,143
<b>I haven't seen</b>
<b>the new</b><b><i>Star Wars</i></b><b>movie yet.</b>

414
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,276
<b>I heard it's great</b>
<b>and I plan to see it.</b>

415
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,611
<b>I like the</b><b><i>Star Wars</i></b><b>franchise,</b>

416
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,677
<b>but I'm a little bummed</b>
<b>that there aren't female Jedi.</b>

417
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,417
<b>I don't really understand that.</b>

418
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,082
<b>Like, um, if being a Jedi</b>
<b>were about physical strength,</b>

419
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,552
<b>then I would understand</b>
<b>why it's mostly men,</b>

420
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,891
<b>because most men are physically</b>
<b>stronger than most women.</b>

421
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,058
<b>But, um, Yoda is a Jedi,</b>

422
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,668
<b>and he's a crippled puppet,</b>
<b>so...</b>

423
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:56,071
<b>clearly it's not about strength.</b>

424
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,535
<b>Um...</b>

425
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,343
<b>I, um...</b>

426
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:03,075
<b>I was in a minor car accident</b>
<b>not too long ago.</b>

427
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,012
<b>It was during rush hour,</b>
<b>so luckily</b>

428
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,317
<b>we weren't going very fast.</b>

429
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,818
<b>And this lady rear-ended me.</b>

430
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,281
<b>And, um, we both pulled over</b>
<b>and I got out of my car,</b>

431
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,791
<b>and she didn't get out of hers.</b>

432
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,022
<b>She just leaned</b>
<b>out of her SUV and said,</b>

433
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,528
<b>"You're okay, right?"</b>

434
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,120
<b>And I said, "Yeah, I'm okay."</b>

435
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,361
<b>And then she started</b>
<b>to get back,</b>

436
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,127
<b>just close the door</b>
<b>like she was gonna drive away,</b>

437
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,566
<b>which kind of made me mad,</b>

438
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,771
<b>so I yelled at her and was like,</b>
<b>"What are you doing?"</b>

439
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,474
<b>And she leaned back out and</b>
<b>said, "What's your problem?"</b>

440
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,807
<b>And I said,</b>
<b>"Well, you ran into me.</b>

441
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,273
<b>Aren't you at least</b>
<b>gonna apologize?"</b>

442
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,111
<b>And she said, "Well,</b>
<b>I didn't do it on purpose.</b>

443
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,047
<b>That's why they call it</b>
<b>an accident."</b>

444
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,583
<b>And then... I was</b>
<b>kind of flabbergasted.</b>

445
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,890
<b>I was like, "I know,</b>

446
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,691
<b>"I know what</b>
<b>'accident' means, A,</b>

447
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,753
<b>"and, B, still</b>
<b>when people accidentally</b>

448
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,363
<b>"run into each other,</b>
<b>a lot of times, they go,</b>

449
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,925
<b>'Hey, I'm sorry I hit you.'"</b>

450
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,394
<b>And then she goes,</b>

451
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:59,102
<b>"Well, if you'll recall,</b>
<b>the first words out of my mouth</b>

452
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,504
<b>were, 'Are you okay?'"</b>

453
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,467
<b>And then I said, "I do recall</b>
<b>your first words, ma'am.</b>

454
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,678
<b>"And I also have a prediction</b>

455
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,910
<b>"for what your last words</b>
<b>might be,</b>

456
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,475
<b>"which is,</b>
<b>'Help, I'm being choked</b>

457
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,814
<b>and I kind of asked for it.'"</b>

458
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,219
<b>Um...</b>

459
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,481
<b>Hey, that's all for me, guys.</b>

460
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,590
<b>Thank you so much.</b>
<b>(crowd cheering)</b>

461
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,592
<b>I really appreciate it.</b>
