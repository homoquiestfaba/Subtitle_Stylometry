00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,766
REMEMBER CINDY AMES?

199
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,468
SHE WON THREE SILVER MEDALS

200
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,002
IN '88.

201
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,670
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING NOW?

202
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,204
 WHAT?

203
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,539
 SHE'S WEARING A BIG

204
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,040
PURPLE DINOSAUR COSTUME.

205
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,475
SHE'S A PURPLE DINOSAUR

206
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,744

207
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,245
 WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,

208
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,015
BREAK NANCY'S LEGS?

209
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,950
 THAT'S IT!

210
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,152
YEAH, IF NANCY HAD SOME KIND

211
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,086
OF...

212
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,756
OH, I DON'T KNOW, ACCIDENT,

213
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,491
SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMPETE,

214
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,159
WOULD SHE?

215
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,161
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

216
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,130
 IF SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW,

217
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,898
DID SOMETHING TO HER,

218
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,668
SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SKATE.

219
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,137
ARE YOU WITH ME?

220
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,774
 WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

221
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,776
YOU WANT ME TO...

222
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:57,810
WHACK HER?

223
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,079
 OH, JEFF, HONEY!

224
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,048
YOU'RE A GENIUS!

225
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,115
I COULD'VE NEVER THOUGHT

226
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,917
OF ANYTHING THAT SMART!

227
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,952
AND THEN WITH NANCY

228
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:06,719
OUT OF THE WAY,

229
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,588
I'D HAVE ALL THE ENDORSEMENTS!

230
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,656
REEBOK, NIKE...

231
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,657
 BIRD'S EYE.

232
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,792
 HUH?

233
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,827
 FROZEN FOOD, ICE...

234
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,695
GET IT?

235
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,163
 ( both laugh )

236
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,933
 WE'D HAVE SO MUCH MONEY!

237
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,837
 WAIT, WHAT IF I GET CAUGHT?

238
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,539
 BUT YOU WOULDN'T DO IT.

239
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,541
YOU'D HIRE A HIT MAN.

240
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,577
 WHERE WE GONNA GET THE MONEY?

241
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:32,812
 I KNOW.

242
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,780
I'LL SAY I GOT A DEATH THREAT.

243
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,649
THEN I'LL ASK MY FAN CLUB

244
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,251
FOR MONEY TO HIRE A BODYGUARD.

245
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,152
BUT REALLY WE'LL USE THE MONEY

246
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,221
TO HIRE A HIT MAN.

247
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,823
THE ONLY TROUBLE IS,

248
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,258
WE HAVE TO FIND A BODYGUARD

249
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,828
WHO'LL WORK FOR FREE.

250
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,062
 I THINK I MIGHT

251
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,664
KNOW SOMEBODY.

252
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,665
 Man: YEAH, YOU THINK YOU'RE

253
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,833
GONNA USE THAT GUN ON ME, HUH?

254
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,568
GO AHEAD, TAKE A SHOT!

255
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,836
TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT!

256
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,703
 ( gunshot )

257
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,971
 SEE? YOU MISSED!

258
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,944
 Woman's voice: CAN I HELP YOU?

259
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,183
 IS SEAN HERE?

260
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,991
 HELLO.

261
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,260
I'M SEAN'S MOTHER.

262
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,962
 OH...

263
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,231
YEAH, I SEE THE RESEMBLANCE.

264
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,033
 OH, NO, SEAN LOOKS

265
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,267
JUST LIKE HIS DAD.

266
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,002
OH, COME IN.

267
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,237
COME IN, PRETTY LADY.

268
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,371
COME IN.

269
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,276

270
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,978
REFRESHING PRUNE JUICE

271
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,713
TO QUENCH YOUR THIRST?

272
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,848
SEAN WILL BE BACK VERY SHORTLY.

273
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,750
HE WENT TO GET SOME CONDIMENTS

274
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,118
FOR HIS SANDWICH.

275
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,020
YOU MUST BE THE PRETTY YOUNG

276
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,222
LADY LOOKING FOR A HIT MAN.

277
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,190
 NO, I'M NOT!

278
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,892
COME ON, JEFF, LET'S GO.

279
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,859
 Regular voice: WAIT! WAIT!

280
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:54,393
IT'S ME SEAN.

281
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,394
 HUH?

282
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,097
 SEE?

283
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,732
I'M A MASTER OF DISGUISE.

284
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,266
 OH!

285
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,868
 WOW!

286
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,142
 SORRY, I HAD TO MAKE SURE

287
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,043
YOU WERE REALLY YOU BEFORE

288
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,378
I REVEALED MY TRUE IDENTITY.

289
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,646
 ( chuckles )

290
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,147
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

291
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,816
 IT'S ROUTINE.

292
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,818
WHAT DO YOU GOT BACK HERE?!

293
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,820
 THAT'S MY BUTT!

294
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,088
 SORRY, THE WAY IT STUCK OUT,

295
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,956
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A WEAPON.

296
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,859
 ( humming )

297
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,061
 YOU'RE CLEAN.

298
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,096
SIT DOWN.

299
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:35,868
 DON'T SIT THERE!

300
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,169
 WHAT?!

301
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,437
 IT'S WIRED WITH EXPLOSIVES.

302
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,338
 WELL, WHERE CAN I SIT

303
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,140
WHERE I WON'T BLOW UP?

304
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,808
 ANYWHERE ON THE FLOOR.

305
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,776
 OKAY.

306
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,444
 OH, EXCEPT THE RUG!

307
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,746
IT'S RIGGED FOR INTRUDERS.

308
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,185
 SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

309
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,420
WHO WE TAKING OUT?

310
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,888
 FIRST OF ALL, WE NEED YOU TO

311
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,891
WRITE A DEATH THREAT AGAINST ME.

312
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,292
 WE'RE TAKING YOU OUT?

313
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,895
 NO, TONYA'S COMPETITION--

314
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,463
NANCY CARDIGAN.

315
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,865
 SEE, THE DEATH THREAT

316
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,333
MAKES ME LOOK INNOCENT.

317
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,834
YOU KNOW, LIKE THERE'S A PLOT

318
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,336
AGAINST FIGURE SKATERS.

319
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,337
 GOOD THINKING.

320
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,471
EXCELLENT.

321
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,472
 THEN WE'LL NEED YOU TO

322
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,241
ARRANGE THE HIT ON NANCY.

323
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,342
 YEAH.

324
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,343
 CAN DO.

325
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,345
MY OPERATIVES CAN BE DEPLOYED

326
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,882
AT A SNAP OF MY FIN...

327
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,250
I GOT JELLY ON MY FINGERS

328
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,851
FROM LUNCH.

329
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,485
( chuckles )

330
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,887
( clears throat )

331
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,822
WHAT'S THIS NANCY LOOK LIKE?

332
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,323

333
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,859
SHE GOT LIKE A PERFECT BUTT--

334
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,393
 GOD!

335
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,761
 WE GOT A PICTURE OF HER HERE.

336
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,198
IT'S A GOOD ONE, TOO.

337
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,233
 GOT IT.

338
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,501
 SEAN, YOU CAN HAVE

339
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,836
THIS PICTURE.

340
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,337
 OKAY, COOL.

341
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,943
 ( both scream )

342
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,213
( both cough )

343
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,382
 SORRY.

344
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,418
 YEAH, THIS LOOKS GOOD.

345
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,986
ALL RIGHT, GRAB THAT END,

346
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,021

347
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:02,755
 WHERE IS SEAN

348
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,756
WITH THE DEATH THREAT?

349
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,356
 I DON'T KNOW.

350
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,524
I TOLD HIM THE PRESS CONFERENCE

351
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,759
WAS AT 1:00.

352
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,793
 YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING

353
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,061
TO WONDER ABOUT HIM.

354
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,062
 DON'T WORRY.

355
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,331
HE WAS TRAINED BY THE C.I.A.

356
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,466
 ARE YOU SURE?

357
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,134
HAVE YOU SEEN A DIPLOMA

358
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,269
OR ANYTHING?

359
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,271
 LOOK, HERE HE IS.

360
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:26,011
 ( groaning )

361
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,279
( groans )

362
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,881
DARN BIKE!

363
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,916
FUCK!

364
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,451
( panting )

365
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,186
 WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!

366
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,788
 SORRY, SORRY!

367
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,922
MY ATTACK DOG ATE MY

368
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,390
BRAND-NEW BUGGING DEVICE.

369
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,358
STATE-OF-THE-ART.

370
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,059
I NEVER EVEN HAD

371
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,327
A CHANCE TO USE IT.

372
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,328
I HAD TO FORCE FEED HIM

373
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,462
LAXATIVES.

374
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,831
ANYWAYS...

375
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,399
HERE'S THE DEATH THREAT.

376
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,168
SORRY ABOUT THE STAINS.

377
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,169
 EW.

378
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,171
WELL, LET'S JUST DO THIS, OKAY?

379
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,439
 WAIT, GIVE ME YOUR FINGER.

380
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,206
 WHAT?

381
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,207
 SO I CAN PUT SOME

382
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,575
VAP-O-RUB ON IT.

383
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,943
 WHY?

384
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,311
 AFTER YOU READ THE THREAT,

385
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,579
RUB YOUR EYE, AND IT'LL

386
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,015
MAKE YOU CRY.

387
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,251
 COOL.

388
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,852
OKAY, OKAY, EVERYBODY.

389
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,120
SHUT UP, OKAY?

390
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,122
SHUT UP.

391
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,090
OKAY, THIS IS A DEATH THREAT,

392
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,424
AND IT'S AGAINST ME.

393
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,526
AND I'M REALLY, REALLY

394
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,894
SCARED FOR MY LIFE.

395
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,162
 EXCUSE ME, TONYA.

396
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,096
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T STAND

397
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:17,930
IN FRONT OF YOUR ADDRESS.

398
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,598
 WHY NOT?

399
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,933
 BECAUSE IF SOMEONE'S TRYING

400
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,234
TO KILL YOU, YOU'RE JUST KINDA

401
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,571
TELLING THEM WHERE YOU LIVE.

402
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:32,178
 OH. OKAY.

403
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,446
"DEAR DEAD MEAT,

404
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,483

408
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,325

00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,893

00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,176

466
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,177
YUCK.

00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,056
WHAT IS THE HOLD UP?

476
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,191
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING THE NEWS

477
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,192
ALL WEEK AND NOTHING.

478
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,360
 FEED THE SQUIRRELS.

479
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,761
 WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

480
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,029
 IT MEANS FEED THE SQUIRRELS.

TAKING SO LONG?

484
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,501
 THESE THINGS REQUIRE

485
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,402
PRECISION PLANNING.

486
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,236
HE'S PROBABLY WAITING

487
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,104

491
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,342
 FIND OUT. ASK HIM.

492
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,610

IT'S NOT ME, I SWEAR.

549
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,302
 I THINK I LOOK PRETTY COOL.

550
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,204
 WELL, YOU DON'T.

552
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,309
 IT'S THE FIRST APPLICANT.

REMEMBER, DON'T USE

554
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,178

 WHAT'S THE PASSWORD?

556
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,185
 Man: KILL CARDIGAN.

 DON'T WORRY.

562
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,295
NO ONE WOULD EVER RECOGNIZE YOU.

563
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,297
YOU LOOK GOOD.

564
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,900
OH, BABY, YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD.

565
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,735
I--

566
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,203
 HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,

00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,371
WHAT KIND OF HARM WOULD YOU

569
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,377
 FIRST THING I'D DO IS GET HER

 I DIDN'T KICK HER.

792

793
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,267
 I WANTED TO KICK HER,

NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO TO ME...

886
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,022
 OR HOW MUCH THEY HURT YOU...

887
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,090

899
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,407
SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.

900
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,308
COULDN'T EVEN PULL OFF

901
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,276
A SIMPLE HIT.

902
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,610
PATHETIC, EH, RALPH?

903

FORMER HUSBAND.

918
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,004
HE ACTED COMPLETELY WITHOUT

919
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,072
MY KNOW-LEDGE.

920
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,941
ONE TIME HE TRIED TO HIT ON

921
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,909
MY BEST FRIEND CHERYL, OKAY?

922
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,110
AND THEN ANOTHER TIME,

923
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,178
HE TRIED TO MICROWAVE

924
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,313

I JUST WANNA SKATE FOR MY

00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,388
THANK YOU ALL FOR BELIEVING ME.

931
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,090
 BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE HER,

933
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,595
SHE WAS A BAD, BAD GIRL.

934
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,498
SHE HURTED MY KNEE A LOT.

935
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,134
Man's voice: WELL, LET ME

936
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:14,505
KISS IT AND MAKE IT BETTER.

937
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,609
 OKAY.

938
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:21,145

00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,642
 Tonya: THE MOMENT I'VE WORKED

949
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,076
AND WAITED FOR ALL MY LIFE

950
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,378
IS FINALLY HERE.

951
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,412
I'M READY.

952
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,380
MY DOUBLE LUTZES

953
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,547
ARE WORLD CLASS.

954
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:57,949
MY LATERAL SOW-COW

955
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,050
WITH A DIPSY-DOODLE TWIST

956
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,984
IS PERFECTION.

957
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,452
AND I'VE LANDED MY TRIPLE-AXLES

958
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,520
EVERY TIME IN THE LAST

959
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,355
FOUR PRACTICES.

960
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,357
I'M THE BEST GOD DAMN SKATER

961
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,625
ON THE PLANET, AND I'M GONNA

962
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,160
KICK NANCY CARDIGAN'S

963
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,295
BONY ASS.

964
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,396
 Man: AND FROM THE UNITED

965
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,998
STATES, MISS TONYA HARDLY!

966
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:18,670
 ( cheering and applause )

967
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,142
 ( coughs )

968
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:40,625
 ( cheering and applause )

969
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,298
 ( cheering and applause )

970
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,267
 Man: SHE'S JUST COMPLETED

971
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,269
HER COMPULSORY TOPS AND TWIRL

972
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,437
WITH A MONKEY WING.

973
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,173
AND QUITE WELL, I MIGHT ADD.

974
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,208
 ( cheering and applause )

975
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,276
 ( rip )

976
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,411
 OW! OH!

977
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,713
 Man: WELL, THIS IS AMAZING.

978
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,613
SOMETHING HAS GONE

979
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,715
TERRIBLY WRONG.

980
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,149
TONYA HARDLY HAS STOPPED

981
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:05,783
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

982
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,086
OF HER PROGRAM.

983
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,221
 ( crying )

984
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,689
YOU GUYS, I CAN'T SKATE.

985
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:15,059
MY PANTIES ARE TOO TIGHT.

986
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:15,793
SOMEBODY MUST'VE WASHED THEM

987
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,061
IN HOT WATER OR SOMETHING,

988
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,463
BECAUSE WHEN I DID MY JUMP,

989
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,764
THEY WENT RIGHT UP MY BUTT,

990
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,599
AND IT REALLY HURTS!

991
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,036
SEE?

992
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,739
 ( all gasp )

993
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,512
 WE'LL HAVE TO CONFER

994
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,780
TO CHECK THE RULES.

995
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,782
 YES.

996
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:38,783
 CAN YOU BELIEVE

997
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,485
THE SIZE OF HER ASS?

998
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,819
 IT'S ABSOLUTELY

999
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,221
BLOODY MASSIVE!

1000
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,758
IT SORT OF FILLS THE ARENA.

1001
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,326
 ALL RIGHT.

1002
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,727
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO FIND

1003
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,662
BIGGER PANTIES AND GET BACK OUT

1004
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,497
THERE ON THE ICE.

1005
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,199
 OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

1006
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,201
YOU WON'T BE SORRY, REALLY!

1007
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,236
THANK YOU!

1008
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,575
 COME ON, I NEED YOUR PANTIES!

1009
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,511

1010
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,512
PLEASE! LET ME BORROW

1011
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,479

I NEED YOUR PANTIES!

1013
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,750
OH! HAS ANYBODY GOT ANY

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,486

00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,757
LET ME HAVE YOUR PANTIES!

1017
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:20,491
 WHAT?

1018
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,225
 YEAH!

1019
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,226
 GO AWAY, YOU'RE CRAZY!

1020
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,095
 COME ON, I'LL GIVE THEM BACK!

1021
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:28,099
 HELP! SECURITY! SECURITY!

1022
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,100
 I GOT THEM!

1023
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,636
TONYA, TONYA, TONYA! HERE!

1024
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,237
THESE ARE CONNIE TONG'S PANTIES.

1025
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:33,871
NOW YOU OWE HER

1026
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:34,639
ANOTHER INTERVIEW.

1027
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,506
HURRY! YOU HAVE LESS

1028
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,774
THAN A MINUTE!

1029
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,543
 BITCHIN'!

1030
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,378
 WHERE ARE MY PANTIES?

1031
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,813
 OUT OF MY WAY!

1032
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,880
 Man: AND NOW,

1033
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,115
BACK ON THE ICE,

1034
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,383
WITH BIGGER PANTIES,

1035
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,151
TONYA HARDLY!

1036
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,120
 ( cheering and applause )

1037
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,403
 OH, HOW IS SHE DOING?

1038
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,637
 OH, JUST OKAY.

1039
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:10,374
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

1040
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,810
 ( cheering and applause )

1041
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,679
 WOW! A DOUBLE-HUMPTY

1042
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,680
WITH A HAMILL SPLIT!

1043
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,747
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

1044
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,483
 NO! I CAN'T LOOK!

1045
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,417
I CAN'T LOOK!

1046
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,885
 OH, NO, NOW CALM DOWN.

1047
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,788
HERE, HAVE A JUJU FRUIT.

1048
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,657
 Man: OH, THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

1049
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,292
IN ALL MY YEARS, I'VE NEVER

1050
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,394
SEEN A PROGRAM LIKE THIS.

1051
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,329
 ( gasps )

1052
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,432
 ( choking )

1053
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,807
 ( coughing )

1054
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,277
 Tonya: I DID IT!

1055
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:46,844
I LANDED MY

1056
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,379
TRIPLE-FLYING TWINKLE!

1057
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,714
I'M GETTING THE GOLD!

1058
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:53,551
 ( cheering and applause )

1059
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,286
 OH! OH, MY GOSH!

1060
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:55,920
SHE'S CHOKING!

1061
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,555
SOMEBODY HEIMLICH HER!

1062
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,557
 ( choking )

1063
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,460
( gasping )

1064
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,899
 Tonya: FUCK YOU, MOM!

1065
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:08,766
FUCK YOU, NANCY!

1066
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,735
FUCK EVERY--

1067
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,971
( screams )

1068
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:19,744
 ( crash )

1069
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:24,515
 ( all groan )

1070
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,750
 Man: THE SILVER MEDAL

1071
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,351
GOES TO NANCY CARDIGAN

1072
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,520
OF THE UNITED STATES...

1073
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,955
AND THE GOLD MEDAL

1074
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,490
TO OKSANA BAYUIL

1075
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,624
OF THE UKRAINE.

1076
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,525
 Nancy: I SHOULD HAVE

1077
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,261
WORN A DUCK COSTUME.

1078
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,230
YOU MAY HAVE THE GOLD MEDAL,

1079
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,631
BUT I HAVE PARENTS.

1080
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,466
 ( crying )

1081
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,235
 WELL, IT'S FINALLY OVER.

1082
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,536
BEAUTY HAS TRIUMPHED

1083
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,904
OVER BRUTALITY.

1084
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,639
NANCY CARDIGAN WILL GO ON

1085
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,941
TO APPEAR IN A SHOW BASED ON

1086
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,976
HER ORDEAL, SNOW WHITE VS.

1087
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,744
THE UGLY BLOND DWARF.

1088
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,480
AS FAR AS HER FORMER RIVAL GOES,

1089
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,382
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT

1090
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,784
THE WORLD HAS SEEN THE LAST OF

1091
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:03,020
BIG LOSER TONYA HARDLY.

1092
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,855
 Man: CUT. WE'RE DONE, CONNIE.

1093
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:05,823
 ( sighs ) DOES ANYONE

1094
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:06,857
HAVE ANY EXTRA PANTIES?

1095
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,659
I'M FREEZING MY ASS OFF!

1096
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,394
 YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE MOST

1097
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,796
CHALLENGING PLASTIC SURGERY

1098
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,664
I HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED.

1099
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,399
I HOPE YOU'RE PLEASED

1100
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,434
WITH THE RESULTS.

1101
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,835
THE MIRROR, PLEASE.

1102
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,786
 Tonya's voice: BITCHIN'!

1103
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,621

1105
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,290

1107
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,294

DEBBY KAWASAKI, TOOK FIRST PLACE

1109
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,897
AT THE WEST COAST REGIONALS.

1110
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,532
IT WAS AN AMAZING DISPLAY

1111
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,767
OF POWER AND SKILL

1112
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,435
FROM A COMPLETE UNKNOWN.

1113
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,670
 Man 2: RIGHT, ALTHOUGH

1114
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,638
I COULD SWEAR I'VE SEEN

1115
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:54,639
THAT ASS BEFORE.

1116
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,439
 Man 1: DEBBY CAME

1117
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,774
OUT OF NOWHERE, BUT IT'S

1118
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,075
CLEAR WHERE SHE'S GOING--

1119
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,445
THE 1998 WINTER OLYMPICS.

1120
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,680
 Tonya: AND THIS TIME,

1121
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,815
I'M GONNA KICK EVERYBODY'S ASS!

1122
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,951
WHY? WHY?

1123
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,986
'CAUSE IT'S MY DREAM!

1124
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,823
( laughs )

1125
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:21,432
 ( grunting )

1126
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,443
 ( animal noises )

1127
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,617
 ( car alarm beeps )

1128
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,618
 Man: PICTURE YOURSELF

1129
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,353
IN A BEVERLY HILLS RESTAURANT,

1130
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,121
WAITING FOR LENORA BABBITT.

1131
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,556
WHEN LENORA BABBITT CUT OFF

1132
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:46,891
HER HUSBAND'S JOYSTICK

1133
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:47,992
WITH A CARVING KNIFE,

1134
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,427
SHE BECAME THE SCARIEST

1135
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,761
WOMAN IN AMERICA.

1136
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,830
WELL, AFTER MADONNA ANYWAY.

1137
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,066
LENORA WAS 5'2" OF TERROR.

1138
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,600
SO I FIGURED IT'D BE SAFE

1139
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,469
TO MEET HER IN A PUBLIC PLACE.

1140
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,737
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS,

1141
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,005
BUT I THINK I HIT IT

1142
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,739
PRETTY WELL.

1143
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,873
 SIR, UH...

1144
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,508
CAN I BRING YOU SOMETHING

1145
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,676
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING?

1146
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,078
 YEAH, I'LL HAVE

1147
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,813
ANOTHER DOUBLE JACK DANIEL'S.

1148
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:09,880
AND LISTEN, GET THESE

1149
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,782
KNIVES OFF THE TABLE.

1150
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,951
I'M DICK LANGLEY, MEDIA GURU.

1151
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,086
I HELP PEOPLE WHO MAKE

1152
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,021
BIG NEWS, MAKE BIG BUCKS.

1153
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,522
LENORA NEEDED AN AGENT,

1154
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,757
AND SHE'D HEARD ABOUT THE DEAL

1155
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,726
I NEGOTIATED FOR BOB BARKER.

1156
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,478
 OH...

1157
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,746
 PARK IT IN A GOOD SPOT.

1158
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:42,680
 IT'S HER, THE ONE

1159
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,515
WHO CUT THE THING OFF.

1160
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,053
 Dick: WHEN SHE WALKED IN,

1161
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,488
THERE WASN'T AN UNCROSSED LEG

1162
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:51,789
IN THE ROOM.

1163
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,638
 EXCUSE ME, I AM

1164
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,775
LOOKING FOR DICK.

1165
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,109
OH, DICK!

1166
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,677
 ( gulps )

1167
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:18,783
 WHOOPS.

1168
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,584
BUTTERFINGERS.

1169
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,485
( chuckles )

1170
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,689
 HELLO, LENORA, I'M DICK--

1171
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,192
RICHARD LANGLEY.

1172
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,093
 HELLO, NICE TO MEET YOU,

1173
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,094
DICK RICHARD.

1174
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,695
 ( speaks Spanish )

1175
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,697
 GRACIAS.

1176
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,533
 UM, CONGRATULATIONS

1177
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,667
ON THE VERDICT.

1178
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,002
 YES, WHEN THE COURT

1179
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,136
DECLARED ME INSANE,

1180
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,237
IT WAS THE MOST HAPPIEST

1181
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:41,972
DAY OF MY LIFE.

1182
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:42,973
 WELL, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

1183
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:43,974
THAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT

1184
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:44,842
YOU WERE INNOCENT.

1185
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:45,943
 BUT I'M NOT.

1186
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,111
I DID IT.

1187
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,847
I WACKED HIS WANG GOOD.

1188
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,548
I WOULD SHOW YOU,

1189
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,716
BUT I DON'T HAVE A KNIFE.

1190
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,118
BUT THEY LET ME GO BECAUSE

1191
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:54,985
THEY SAY I'M CRAZY.

1192
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,121
I LOVE AMERICA!

1193
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:57,855
( laughs )

1194
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,890
 SO, LENORA, UM...

1195
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,525
SO MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN

1196
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,260
ABOUT YOU, AND EVERYBODY SEEMS

1197
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,162
TO HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT WHAT--

1198
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,530
 OPINIONS ARE LIKE ASSHOLES--

1199
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,531
EVERYONE'S HIDING ONE

1200
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:11,035
IN THEIR UNDERWEARS.

1201
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,903
 OKAY, UH...

1202
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,072
BUT IF I'M GONNA GET YOU

1203
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,974
THE REALLY BIG BUCKS,

1204
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,843
I'VE GOTTA KNOW THE REAL STORY.

1205
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,644
HMM? IN YOUR OWN WORDS.

1206
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,112
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST

1207
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,114
START AT THE BEGINNING.

1208
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,149
 WELL, I CAME TO AMERICA

1209
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,984
FOR TWO WEEKS VACATION.

1210
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,619
AND IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL,

1211
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,821
IT JUST BLOWED ME AWAY.

1212
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,023
THAT'S WHEN I MET JUAN WAYNE.

1213
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:33,958
 WHO?

1214
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:34,959
 JUAN WAYNE, MY HUSBAND.

1215
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,193
 OH, JUAN WAYNE.

1216
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,862
 YES.

1217
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,097
I REMEMBER THE NIGHT WE MET.

1218
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,198
YOU COULD ALMOST

1219
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,601
SMELL THE MAGIC.

1220
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,551
 MUCHACHA, WHAT HAPPENED

1221
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,819
TO YOUR MUSTACHE?

1222
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,020
DID YOU SHAVE IT OFF?

1223
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,655
 NO, I USED BLEACH CREAM.

1224
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,156
I BLEACHED MY CLEAVAGE, TOO.

1225
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:06,857
LOOK.

1226
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,592
 YOU CAN DO THAT?

1227
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:09,994
 IT MAKES THEM STAND OUT.

1228
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,762
THEY'RE MORE 3-D NOW. SEE?

1229
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:12,763
 OH, YEAH!

1230
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:13,998
NOW YOU'RE REALLY GONNA FIND

1231
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,232
A HUSBAND BEFORE YOUR VISA

1232
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,300
RUNS OUT.

1233
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,268
 I HOPE SO.

1234
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,640
 ( gasps )

1235
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,246
 WHOA!

1236
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,648
( groaning )

1237
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,983
 Man: JOHNNY!

1238
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,785
 OH, MARIA, CHECK OUT

1239
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:35,719
THAT GORGEOUS HUNK

1240
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,755
OF AMERICAN MAN MEAT.

1241
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:40,324
TESTOSTERONE EXTRA.

1242
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,659
 WHICH ONE?

1243
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:42,793
 THE ONE IN THE HAT

1244
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,896
WITH THE BEER ANTLERS.

1245
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:50,234
 All: ( chanting) GO, GO, GO!

1246
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:50,968
 OH, LENORA,

1247
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,770
THAT'S A MARINE PRIVATE,

1248
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,904
A GRUNT.

1249
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,673
WITH YOUR CLEAVAGE,

1250
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,207
YOU COULD GET AN OFFICER.

1251
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,242
 BUT HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE

1252
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,711
TOM CRUISE, MY DREAM LOVER.

1253
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,048
JUST WATCHING HIM MAKES ME DAMP.

1254
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,684
 All: WHOA!

1255
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,019
 LENORA, REMEMBER WHEN YOU

1256
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,754
TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR SEXUAL...

1257
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,989
DEFORMITY?

1258
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,325
 IT'S NO DEFORMITY.

1259
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,860
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD ORGASM...

1260
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,962
YET.

1261
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,396
BUT I THINK MAYBE THAT'S

1262
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,031
ALL GOING TO CHANGE.

1263
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:24,935
 ( groans )

1264
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,936
 WHAT'S YOUR POISON?

1265
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,937
 CAN I HAVE TWO BEERS?

1266
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,239
 YEP. THERE YOU GO.

1267
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,709
 HI THERE, HOT STUFF.

1268
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,410
I LIKE YOUR BEER HAT.

1269
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,680
 OH, THANKS.

1270
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,881
 MY NAME'S LENORA.

1271
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,249
WHAT'S YOURS?

1272
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,920
 ( gulps ) UH...

1273
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,725
 AH, FORGET IT.

1274
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:48,859
HE'S NOT INTERESTED.

1275
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,160
 BUT HE HASN'T

1276
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,963
SEEN ME LAMBADA.

1277
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,298
 ( gasps ) BUT YOU CAN'T!

1278
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,433
THAT'S THE FORBIDDEN DANCE!

1279
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,903
 WATCH ME.

1280
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,739

00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,031
 LIKE IT?

1320
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,168
 Lenora: OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER

1321
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,036
WAS SO, SO ROMANTIC.

1322
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,005
I WAS SHY, BUT HE WAS GENTLE.

1323
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,406
SO TENDER, REALLY.

1324
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:20,144
NOT LIKE THIS PORK CHOP.

1325
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,516
 MM. SO ARE YOU, UH...

1326
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,151
YOU MET THE MAN OF YOUR DREAMS

1327
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,418
AND YOU GOT MARRIED.

1328
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,087
TELL US ABOUT THE WEDDING.

1329
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,155
 YOU MEAN THE ONE DAY

1330
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,856
OF A WOMAN'S LIFE THAT IS

1331
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:33,557
SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST

1332
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,058
BEAUTIFUL, MAGICAL DAY,

1333
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,527
WHEN SHE FEELS LIKE CINDERELLA

1334
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,561
ON A CLOUD SURROUNDED

1335
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,896
BY BABY ANGELS?

1336
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,430
IS THAT THE DAY YOU MEAN, DICK?

1337
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,901
 SURE. OKAY.

1338
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,369
 WELL, THE RECEPTION WAS OKAY,

1339
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,137
YOU KNOW, FOR DENNY'S,

1340
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,406
BUT THE HONEYMOON...

1341
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:52,910
( speaking Spanish )

1342
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,578
 WHICH MEANS?

1343
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,413
 IT SUCKED SO BAD.

1344
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,115
EVERY TIME WE MAKE THE WHOOPIE,

1345
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,049
HE HAVE ORGASM,

1346
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,984
AND HE DON'T CARE IF I DO.

1347
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,986
I WANTED SO BADLY TO CLIMAX,

1348
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,521
BUT JUAN WAYNE WOULDN'T EVEN TRY

1349
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,357
TO FIND MY MAGIC FUN BUTTON.

1350
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,392
 NOT MANY OF US

1351
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,860
REALLY KNOW WHERE IT IS.

1352
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,861
 WELL, YOU SHOULD LEARN.

1353
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,863
 OH, YES, I'M GOING TO.

1354
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,598
 ALL OF YOU.

1355
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,567
TOO ELECTRIC!

1356
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,203
OH! OUCH! MY HAIRS!

1357
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,139
AH! AH! OH, YES! YES!

1358
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,073
NO! NO!

1359
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,008
IT REMINDS ME OF MY MOTHER!

1360
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:25,976
OH, YES, YES!

1361
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,477
OH, IT'S GOOD! IT'S GOOD!

1362
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,079
BUT TOO ITALIAN!

1363
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,516
AH! AH! OH! OH, YES!

1364
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:37,354
AH! AH! YES! YES! YES!

1365
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,488
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE!

1366
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:39,423
 OKAY...

1367
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,325
 WHAT?

1368
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,427
 OKAY, THAT'S IT.

1369
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,394
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS

1370
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,329
FOR HOURS NOW.

1371
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,330
I GOTTA TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.

1372
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,931
 NO, DON'T STOP! NO!

1373
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:48,966
TALK NASTY TO ME

1374
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,133
WITH THE HAND PUPPET AGAIN!

1375
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,902
YES! PLEASE! COME ON!

1376
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,537
IT'S GOOD! YES! YES!

1377
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,440
UH-HUH! UH-HUH! OH, YES! YES!

1378
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,641
 YOU'RE SO HOT, BABY!

1379
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,342
OH, YEAH!

1380
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,977
YOU'RE GONNA JIFFY POP!

1381
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:00,978
YOU'RE GONNA BLOW

1382
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,145
LIKE MOUNT ST. HELEN!

1383
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,413
 WHO IS HELEN?!

1384
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,982
WHO IS HELEN?!

1385
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,083
TELL ME!

1386
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,551
WHO IS THIS WHORE HELEN?!

1387
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,952
YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS!

1388
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,120
SPEAK! SPEAK!

1389
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,990
OH, NO! ( crying )

1390
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,058
EVEN IN OUR HONEYMOON BED,

1391
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,260
HE WOULD TORTURE ME WITH TALK

1392
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,427
OF OTHER WOMENS AND HOW THEY

1393
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:18,528
WOULD BLOW UP WITH

1394
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:19,563
THEIR ORGASMS.

1395
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,265
EVERYWHERE WE WENT,

1396
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,033
HE WOULD SQUEEZE THEIR BREASTS

1397
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,601
AND BOTTOMS WITH HIS EYES.

1398
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,036
AND THEY WOULD FONDLE HIS

1399
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,304
MANHOOD WITH THEIR EYEBROWS,

1400
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,305
LIKE THIS.

1401
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,144
 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK

1402
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,145
THE JURY A WHOLE WEEK

1403
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,113
TO FIND YOU INSANE.

1404
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,981
 IS THAT A JOKE?

1405
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,251
 YEAH. YEAH, IT'S A JOKE.

1406
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,085
 OH.

1407
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:42,686
 Man: CAN I TAKE THAT?

1408
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,121
 I WAS DIAGNOSED FOR MY TRIAL.

1409
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,589
I'LL TAKE THAT.

1410
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,124
AND THE PSYCHIATRIST SAID

1411
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,592
I HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR.

1412
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,260
IN VENEZUELA AS A CHILD,

1413
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,561
I WAS KIDNAPPED VERY BRIEFLY

1414
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,130
BY A CIRCUS CLOWN.

1415
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,066
IT'S NOT FUN LIKE IT SOUNDS.

1416
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,301
 WELL, IT MUST BE

1417
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,602
A VERY PAINFUL MEMORY.

1418
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,569
NOW GETTING BACK

1419
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:00,737
TO YOUR HUSBAND...

1420
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,205
I SUPPOSE IT'S ONLY NATURAL

1421
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:03,640
THAT WOMEN NOTICED HIM.

1422
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,242
I MEAN, HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING MAN.

1423
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:07,644
 YES, WHEN HE'S NOT DRUNK

1424
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,013
AND DROOLING, SO HANDSOME.

1425
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,449
A CHARMING DEVIL SENT BY...

1426
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,684
THE DEVIL...

1427
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,118
TO ROAST MY HEART

1428
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,687
IN A MICROWAVE.

1429
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:17,988
MY PASSION FOR HIM

1430
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,990
COST ME EVERYTHING!

1431
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,259
EVEN MY JOB!

1432
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,294
( crying )

1433
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,164
 YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS?

1434
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:30,000
YOU'VE NEVER HAD AN ORGASM?

1435
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,569
 NO, NEVER, NOTHING, NADA.

1436
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,604
IT'S LIKE I'M DEAD DOWN THERE.

1437
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:35,605
THE DOCTORS DON'T KNOW

1438
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:36,707
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

1439
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,575
 WHEN WE CAN'T HAVE AN ORGASM,

1440
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:41,445
IT'S ALWAYS THE MAN'S FAULT.

1441
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,046
DOESN'T YOUR HUSBAND

1442
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,047
KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING?

1443
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,649
 WELL, HE TRIES.

1444
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,284
BUT MAYBE NOT HARD ENOUGH.

1445
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:48,585
 I GUESS I'M LUCKY.

1446
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,087
I CAN JUST HOP ON MY WASHING

1447
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,388
MACHINE DURING THE SPIN CYCLE,

1448
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,590
HAVE TWO OR THREE ORGASMS.

1449
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,192
OW!

1450
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,293
 SORRY.

1451
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,400
 OH, HI, JUAN WAYNE.

1452
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,601
I'M ALMOST DONE, HONEY.

1453
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,536
 Woman: I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

1454
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,272
DON'T FORGET TO CALL HIM, OKAY?

1455
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:12,676
 THAT'S MY HUSBAND.

1456
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,545
 OH. HE'S A DOLL.

1457
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:19,449
 I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY

1458
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:22,319
TROUBLE CLIMAXING WITH HIM.

1459
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,288
 UGH.

1460
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,090
 OKAY, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

1461
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,592
NEXT TIME YOU'RE VACUUMING,

1462
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:31,361
USE THE DEEP-CREVICE ATTACHMENT.

1463
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:37,067
( makes sucking noises )

1464
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:37,667
OH, AND YOU GOTTA LEAN

1465
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,703
AGAINST A WALL OR SOMETHING.

1466
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,373
( makes sucking noises )

1467
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,841
OH, AND ACTUALLY IT HELPS

1468
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,143
IF YOU'RE WEARING PANTYHOSE.

1469
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,779
DON'T ASK ME WHY.

1470
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:49,646
ASK YOUR HUSBAND ABOUT

1471
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,814
THE COUNTING TECHNIQUE.

1472
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,616
IT GOES LIKE THIS, WATCH.

1473
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,786
ONE AND TWO AND THREE...

1474
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,421
 Lenora: COOKIE WAS COMING ON

1475
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,289
TO HIM LIKE A TEN-CENT SLUT.

1476
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,158
AND HE WAS FLIRTING BACK,

1477
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,392
WASTING HIS SEXUAL ENERGIES

1478
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,194
ON HER AND SAVING NOTHING

1479
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,263
FOR OUR MARRIAGE BED.

1480
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,597
 ( laughs )

1481
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,667
( screams )

1482
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,803
YOU CUT ME!

1483
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:13,637
 I SEE YOU MAKING PLANS

1484
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,871
FOR SEX, GOD DAMN IT!

1485
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:15,605
 WHOA, WHOA.

1486
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:16,573
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. WHAT?

1487
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,808
 OH, RIGHT! RIGHT!

1488
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,242
 OW! YOU CRAZY BITCH!

1489
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,710
 YOU WHORE-MONGERING BASTARD!

1490
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,812
 OW! OOH!

1491
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,680
 COME BACK HERE, COOKIE,

1492
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,682
YOU BLONDE PIECE OF SHIT!

1493
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:26,616
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU...

1494
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:27,851
 ( screams )

1495
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:28,718
 THERE YOU GO!

1496
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:29,786
RUN AWAY NOW WITH

1497
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:30,787
YOUR FAKE TITS!

1498
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,522
GOD DAMN YOU, BASTARD!

1499
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:33,757
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?!

1500
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,792
YOU JUST MAKE ME SICK!

1501
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:37,194
JUST FOR TRYING TO SAVE

1502
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,695
MY MARRIAGE, I WAS FIRED!

1503
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,797
WITHOUT A JOB, I HAD TO STEAL

1504
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,432
JUST TO KEEP STYLISH CLOTHES

1505
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,567
IN THE CLOSET.

1506
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,801
MY DAYS WERE FILLED

1507
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:45,569
WITH SHOPLIFTING,

1508
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,570
AND MY NIGHTS WITH

1509
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:52,576
FRUSTRATING NON-ORGASMIC SEX.

1510
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:53,510
THE NIGHT THAT

1511
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,711
CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER

1512
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,713
STARTED OFF LIKE MANY OTHERS...

1513
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:57,714
ON MY MAYTAG.

1514
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:00,817
YES! YES! YES!

1515
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,552
NO.

1516
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:03,653
MAYBE IT HAS TO BE

1517
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,790
ON SPIN CYCLE.

1518
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,525
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

1519
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,493
OH, I LIKE THAT.

1520
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,293
OH, WAIT, WAIT.

1521
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:10,927
UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

1522
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,696
OH, YES, GOOD.

1523
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,265
UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

1524
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,634
JUAN WAYNE, YOU'RE HOME.

1525
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,238
 HI, HONEY.

1526
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,239

1527
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,273
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

1528
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,708
I FEEL HOT AND READY.

1529
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,711
I FOREPLAYED MYSELF.

1530
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:28,845
 UGH.

1531
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,847
I DON'T THINK SO.

1532
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,583
I'M KINDA TIRED.

1533
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,586
I'M GONNA GO HIT THE SACK.

1534
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,889
 BUT TONIGHT I'M GOING

1535
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,323

1536
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,324
ON DRUGS.

1537
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,726
THIS TIME I'M GOING TO MAKE IT

1538
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,561

1539
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,296

00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,511
OH, LOOK OUT.

1572
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:43,820
 JUAN WAYNE, WAKE UP!

1574
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,525

CONNIE!

1586
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,283
555-0069.

1587
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,985
HE HAS USED ALL HIS TESTOSTERONE

1588
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,553
ON CONNIE AND HAS NOTHING LEFT

1589
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,988

1594
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,070
 YES, YOU CAN!

1595
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,004
THINK OF CONNIE

1596
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,005

1597
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:10,507
SHE HAS STOLEN FROM YOU!

1598
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,476
 BUT MAYBE CONNIE

1599
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,477
IS JUST AN OLD FRIEND

1600
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:14,978
OF THE FAMILY

1601
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,379

1608
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,660
 NO!

1609
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,494

00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,676
YOU KNOW HOW IT FEELS

1688
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,612
TO BE A WOMAN...

1689
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:38,014
'CAUSE YOU ALMOST ARE A WOMAN.

1690
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,916
 ( tires screech )

1691
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:44,020
 ( singing along with radio )

1692
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,791
 ANCHORS AWAY,

1693
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,660
YOU PINK TORPEDO.

1694
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:58,034
 LET THEM FIND THAT.

1695
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,269
( laughs )

1696
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:04,274
 ( screaming )

1697
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,346
DOC! DOC, I CAN'T FACE

1698
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,048
LIFE WITHOUT MY WILLIE!

1699
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,083
YOU GOTTA HELP ME, PLEASE!

1700
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:14,984
 MR. BABBITT, WE'RE DOING

1701
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:15,785
EVERYTHING WE CAN.

1702
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:16,719
THE POLICE ARE CONDUCTING

1703
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,587
AN EXHAUSTIVE MANHUNT

1704
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:18,121
FOR THE PHALLUS.

1705
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:18,888
 I DON'T KNOW

1706
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,056
NO FANCY DOCTOR TALK.

1707
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,291
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

1708
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,292
 THE COPS ARE GOING BALLS OUT

1709
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,794
TO FIND YOUR DICK.

1710
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,062
 WHAT IF THEY DON'T?

1711
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,664
 THE BEST I CAN DO IS I CAN

1712
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:28,631
GRAFT YOUR BIG TOE ONTO

1713
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:29,232
YOUR STUMP.

1714
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,633
IT WON'T FUNCTION AS A PENIS,

1715
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:31,935
BUT YOU'LL LOOK NORMAL

1716
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,937
IN TIGHT SWIMWEAR.

1717
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,038
 ( screams )

1718
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,040
 SHIPMENT!

1719
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,608
 Lenora: OOH!

1720
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:39,375
THEY'RE SO CUTE,

1721
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,144
THE LITTLE CLOWN CANISTERS!

1722
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,712
I HAVE TO HAVE THEM!

1723
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:43,346
 AND WHAT WILL YOU

1724
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,180
KEEP IN THEM?

1725
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,949
 OH, SO MANY THINGS--

1726
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,884
COOKIES, COTTON BALLS...

1727
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,085
MAYBE A PENIS.

1728
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,219
 PEANUTS?

1729
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,622
I'M A NUT FOR PEANUTS!

1730
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:55,291
WELL, THESE AIR TIGHT CLOWNS

1731
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,359
WILL CERTAINLY KEEP

1732
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,694
YOUR NUTS FRESH.

1733
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:58,294
 OOH!

1734
00:59:58,294 --> 00:59:59,095
 ( knock at door )

1735
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,863
 Man: OPEN UP! POLICE!

1736
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,666
 GO AWAY! I'M ON TV!

1737
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:04,734
 OPEN UP! WE GOT A WARRANT!

1738
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:05,768
 I HAVE TO GO.

1739
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,103
I'M BEING ARRESTED.

1740
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,705
 WAIT!

1741
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:09,706
 GOD DAMN IT.

1742
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:10,273
 WE NEED TO GET

1743
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,041
YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER.

1744
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:12,976
 SHIT ON A BISCUIT.

1745
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,110
 HELLO? HONEY,

1746
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,411
IF YOU DON'T CALL BACK,

1747
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,246
THIS LITTLE CUTIE IS GOING TO BE

1748
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,682
HOLDING SOMEONE ELSE'S PEANUTS.

1749
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:22,085
 LENORA BABBITT?

1750
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,387
 MAYBE. WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

1751
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,254
 WE'RE NOT HERE

1752
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:26,990
TO PLAY GAMES, MA'AM.

1753
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,025
 OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

1754
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,259
I GOT A MONOPOLY BOARD

1755
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,728
ALL SET UP.

1756
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:32,295
 WE GOT A WARRANT

1757
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,896
FOR YOUR HUSBAND'S PENIS.

1758
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:35,064
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

1759
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,166
 BETWEEN HIS LEGS,

1760
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,968
LAST TIME I LOOKED.

1761
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,837
 WELL, IT'S NOT THERE NOW.

1762
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:41,437
 HE NEVER COULD

1763
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,439
KEEP IT IN HIS PANTS.

1764
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,041
( chuckles )

1765
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:45,742
 YOU BETTER COME

1766
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:46,309
WITH US, MA'AM.

1767
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,945
 AND PRONTO.

1768
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,113
 FINE.

1769
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,749
PULL THE FUN PLUG.

1770
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:53,683
 OKAY, YOU SAID

1771
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:54,250
YOU TURNED ON ELM.

1772
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,451
NOW WHICH WAY DID YOU GO?

1773
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:57,253
 I WENT THAT WAY.

1774
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,389
OR MAYBE IT WAS THAT WAY.

1775
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,924
IT'S SO HARD TO REMEMBER.

1776
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,793
YOU KNOW, I THINK I STOPPED

1777
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,461
AT THAT JACK IN THE BOX.

1778
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:06,896
A JUMBO JACK MIGHT

1779
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:07,797
JOG MY MEMORY.

1780
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:08,931
 STOP THE CAR.

1781
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,768
 ( tires screech )

1782
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,036
 LOOK, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID

1783
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,370
AT McDONALD'S AND DEL TACO'S.

1784
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,972
NOW CUT THE CRAP, MRS. BABBITT.

1785
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,273
THE DOCTOR SAID WE ONLY GOT

1786
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:18,241
ONE HOUR TO GET THAT PRICK

1787
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:18,975
TO THE HOSPITAL.

1788
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,443
 OH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID

1789
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,378
HE WAS ALREADY AT THE HOSPITAL.

1790
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:23,413
 ( sighs )

1791
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,449
 HE MEANS THE PENIS.

1792
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,484
LOOK, EITHER YOU COOPERATE,

1793
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:31,020
OR YOU ARE GOING TO THE SLAMMER.

1794
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,922
 ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

1795
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,724
YOU WIN.

1796
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:35,925
JUAN WAYNE'S WILLIE

1797
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:37,160
IS IN THE VACANT LOT

1798
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,261
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO

1799
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:41,264
DER WEINER WORLD.

1800
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,231
AND I WOULDN'T MIND STOPPING

1801
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,500
THERE FOR A HOT DOG, EITHER.

1802
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,945
 OKAY. YOU PUT THE PENIS

1803
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,313
IN THE PUPPET, IS THAT RIGHT?

1804
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,115
 THAT'S RIGHT, COLUMBO.

1805
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,951
 AND YOU STOPPED OVER THERE.

1806
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,519
NOW, IF THE CAR WAS AT THE CURB,

1807
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,957
THE PATH OF THE TRAJECTORY...

1808
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:11,527
WOULD END UP ABOUT HERE.

1809
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,002
 I DON'T SEE IT.

1810
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:20,970
 DID YOU THROW IT

1811
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,973
UNDERHAND OR OVERHAND?

1812
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,942
 DID YOU PITCH IT,

1813
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:29,512
OR DID YOU SORT OF LOB IT?

1814
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:30,513
 HOW DO I KNOW?

1815
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,782
WHO AM I, JOE MONTANA?

1816
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:33,883
I'M A WOMAN.

1817
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,852
I JUST THROWED IT.

1818
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,420
 ( sighs )

1819
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,856
WE COULD RE-ENACT IT.

1820
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,524
 YEAH.

1821
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:42,825
ALL RIGHT.

1822
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:43,993
TAKE MY TWINKIE,

1823
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,995
GET BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE CAR,

1824
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,130
AND THROW IT THE SAME WAY

1825
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:47,930
YOU THREW THE ORGAN.

1826
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:48,798
 THIS TWINKIE WON'T

1827
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:49,799
GO IN THE SAME PLACE.

1828
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,200
IT'S A LOT BIGGER.

1829
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,869
 JUST DO IT.

1830
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,810
 DO EXACTLY AS YOU DID BEFORE.

1831
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,511
 EXACTLY?

1832
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,279
 EXACTLY!

1833
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,214
 ( car starts )

1834
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:10,987
 OKAY, I STOPPED

1835
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:13,422
THE CAR LIKE THIS.

1836
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,258
I CRY A LITTLE TO MIGUEL BOLTON.

1837
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,860
( crying )

1838
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,464
THEN I THROW THE PENIS AWAY...

1839
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,866
LIKE THIS.

1840
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,338
 ( chuckles )

1841
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,207
ALL RIGHT, IT WORKED.

1842
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:32,575
THERE IT IS.

1843
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,949
 THAT'S A HOT DOG.

1844
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,517
 THEN I DRIVE AWAY REAL QUICK!

1845
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:42,552
LIKE THIS!

1846
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:43,853
 ( siren wails )

1847
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,189
 GET HER!

1848
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,126
 HEY!

1849
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:51,260
STOP THAT CAR!

1850
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,328
STOP! STOP IT!

1851
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,863
OH, YOU ARE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE!

1852
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,631
YOU ARE IN TROUBLE!

1853
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,001
 STOP THIS CAR, OR YOU CAN

1854
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,537
KISS YOUR LICENSE GOOD-BYE!

1855
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,639
 GET OFF THE CAR, KOJAK!

1856
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:08,077
 WHAT KIND OF CRAZY CASE

1857
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:11,447
IS THIS?

1858
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,015
THERE IT IS!

1859
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,952
THERE IT IS!

1860
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,119
NO, PUPPY!

1861
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,554
NO! LEAVE IT ALONE!

1862
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:20,289
LEAVE IT ALONE! GO AWAY!

1863
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,592
DROP IT! DROP IT!

1864
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,327
COME BACK! COME BACK!

1865
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,262
COME BACK HERE, YOU LITTLE MUTT!

1866
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,597
BRING BACK THAT PENIS!

1867
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,065
 RUN, LASSIE, RUN!

1868
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,299
RUN LIKE THE WIND!

1869
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:31,601
 COME HERE, YOU!

1870
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,535
COME HERE!

1871
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,470
STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!

1872
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,271
 ( gunshot )

1873
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:38,307
 DOCTOR?

1874
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:39,242
DR. KELLOC?

1875
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:42,044
 IN THERE.

1876
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,080
 WE GOT IT, DOC!

1877
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,615
 THAT'S NOT A PENIS!

1878
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:46,949
IT'S A POODLE!

1879
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,117
 IT'S IN HIS STOMACH.

1880
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:50,086
HE ATE IT.

1881
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,954
 ( dog whimpers )

1882
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:54,624
 NURSE, GET THIS POODLE

1883
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:55,958
TO X-RAY.

1884
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,693
STAT.

1885
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,434
 MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

1886
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,170
( gasps )

1887
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,672
IT'S TOO LATE.

1888
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:13,142
IT'S TOO CHEWED.

1889
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:16,279
DAMN THAT POODLE!

1890
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,181
 HEY, MURPH.

1891
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,217
AM I PUTTING ON WEIGHT?

1892
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:22,018
 I DON'T KNOW.

1893
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:24,954
TURN AROUND.

1894
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,255
YEAH, YOU LOOK A LITTLE CHUNKY

1895
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,390
THROUGH THE THIGHS.

1896
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,491
 YEAH?

1897
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,993
WELL, IT'S THESE PANTS.

1898
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:32,361
THEY'RE SYNTHETIC.

1899
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,030
 EXCUSE ME, GIRLS.

1900
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,498
COULD YOU UNCUFF ME?

1901
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,699
I HAVE TO TINKLE.

1902
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,434
 NOT A CHANCE.

1903
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,435
 FINE.

1904
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,270
I'LL JUST WET YOUR SQUAD CAR.

1905
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,405
 OH, GOD.

1906
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,674
 ( flatline )

1907
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,542
 I'M SORRY.

1908
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,412
HE'S GONE.

1909
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,480
 ( screams )

1910
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,448
( crying )

1911
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,183
 COME WITH ME.

1912
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:58,421
 I CAN'T DO IT.

1913
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,222
I JUST HAVE TO SEW IT UP.

1914
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:01,490
 I'M SORRY, DOC.

1915
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,591
WE DID OUR BEST.

1916
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:03,659
 THIS IS GOING TO BREAK

1917
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:04,427
CONNIE'S HEART.

1918
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,328
 AND ADD A FEW YEARS

1919
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,395
TO YOUR PRISON SENTENCE.

1920
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,697
 YEAH.

1921
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,565
 HMM...

1922
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:10,299
OOH.

1923
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,233
 HEY!

1924
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:15,338
 YOU KNOW,

1925
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,339
HERE'S A CRAZY IDEA.

1926
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:17,239
THERE'S A PENIS ON

1927
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,207
THAT DEAD BIKER THERE.

1928
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:19,442
WHY NOT JUST SNIP-SNIP,

1929
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,178
AND SEW IT ON JUAN WAYNE?

1930
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:24,413
 YOU KNOW, IT JUST MIGHT WORK.

1931
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:25,381
 AND I WILL HELP!

1932
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,382
AND IF IT WORKS, YOU SHOULD TELL

1933
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,416
THE JUDGE IT WAS MY IDEA,

1934
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:28,551
BECAUSE THEY GIVE TIME OFF

1935
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,318
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR,

1936
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,653
WHY NOT TIME OFF FOR GOOD IDEA?

1937
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,488
 GET HER OUT OF HERE.

1938
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,156
 BECAUSE IT WAS MY IDEA,

1939
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,524
AND IT WAS A GOOD IDEA, TOO!

1940
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:36,559
AND I HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS

1941
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,393
ABOUT THAT HAIR PIECE

1942
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:40,629
YOU GOT THERE!

1943
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:43,099
 THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

1944
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,767
THE WORLD'S FIRST PENIS

1945
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,202
TRANSPLANT, AND THE DOC

1946
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,137
KEEPS A LID ON IT.

1947
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,505
I WONDER WHY.

1948
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,673
 WHO KNOWS?

1949
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,408
THESE DOCTORS ARE SO SNEAKY

1950
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,709
WITH THEIR SECRETS.

1951
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:55,044
IT'S PENIS GATE.

1952
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,680
MADRE DE CHARO, THE TIME!

1953
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,647
I MUST GO.

1954
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,516
I HAVE TO GO TO THE TV STUDIO.

1955
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,184
THEY ARE PAYING JUAN WAYNE

1956
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,719
AND ME TO RE-ENACT THAT

1957
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:04,820
TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE NIGHT

1958
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,622
WHEN THINGS GOT, YOU KNOW,

1959
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:07,590
OUT OF HAND.

1960
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,592
 HE AGREED TO DO THIS?

1961
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:10,459
 WELL, HE NEEDS THE MONEY

1962
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:11,460
FOR THE DOCTORS.

1963
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,329
AND FOR ME, IT'S MY FIRST TIME

1964
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,331
SINCE MY TRIAL TO SEE HIM...

1965
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,166
AND TO ASK HIM TO COME HOME.

1966
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,735
 ( chokes )

1967
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:22,338
NO OFFENSE, BUT DON'T YOU THINK

1968
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,739
HE'D BE A LITTLE AFRAID TO

1969
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,608
GET BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU.

1970
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:26,776
 JUST BECAUSE HE GAVE ME

1971
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,144
CONCUSSION AND I AMPUTATE

1972
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,645
HIS PENIS DOESN'T MEAN

1973
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,580
WE AREN'T IN LOVE.

1974
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,582
PEOPLE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

1975
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:36,685
OUR SPECIAL KIND OF LOVE.

1976
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:39,288
WELL, I MUST GO.

1977
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,626
 JESUS CHRIST!

1978
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:44,693
 ( laughs ) MADE YOU JUMP!

1979
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:48,197
( laughs )

1980
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,666
OKAY. BYE-BYE, DICK RICHARD.

1981
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:54,303
SEE YOU IN THE FUNNY PAPERS.

1982
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:57,339
BOO! ( laughs )

1983
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,342
 ( all chattering )

1984
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:05,347
 BRITNEY, DADDY IS WORKING.

1985
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,415
THAT'S RIGHT, DADDY CAN'T

1986
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,249
BE WITH YOU ALL THE TIME.

1987
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:07,883
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE

1988
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:09,552
DOESN'T LOVE YOU, OKAY?

1989
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:10,453
SO YOU PLAY NICE

1990
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:11,187
WITH YOUR SISTERS.

1991
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:12,254
 IS THIS GOOD?

1992
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,389
 IS IT A REAL KNIFE?

1993
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,391
 NO, IT'S RUBBER.

1994
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,660
 I SAID I WANTED A REAL KNIFE!

1995
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,695
THERE'S NO POINT IN SHOOTING

1996
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:22,131
THIS IF IT'S NOT A REAL KNIFE!

1997
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:24,834
 I WASN'T WEARING THESE

1998
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,569
CHA-CHA EARRINGS WHEN I WACKED

1999
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,537
JUAN WAYNE, BUT THEY LOOK

2000
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,706
SO GOOD!

2001
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,608
WACK! ( chuckles )

2002
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:40,850
 ( burps )

2003
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,551
TWO POINTS.

2004
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,257
 WELL, IF IT ISN'T

2005
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,459
THE GINSU PRINCESS.

2006
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,661
 OH, YOU'RE THAT BIKER SLUT,

2007
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:54,864
THE WIFE OF THE PENIS DONOR.

2008
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,866
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

2009
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,501
 NO BIG LOSS.

2010
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,302
THE ONE THING I LIKED ABOUT DEKE

2011
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,704
WAS HIS PECKER.

2012
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,673
BUT NOW THAT'S ON YOUR HUSBAND.

2013
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,442
 YES, I'M SURE JUAN WAYNE

2014
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,711
IS VERY GRATEFUL, EVEN THOUGH...

2015
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,313
HOW YOU SAY, THE PECKER MAY

2016
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,415
NEVER FUNCTION AS A SEX TOOL.

2017
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:15,417
 OH, IT FUNCTIONS, ALL RIGHT.

2018
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,721
LAST NIGHT, WE DID THE NASTY

2019
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,590
FOR HOURS.

2020
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:24,426
 YOU HAD SEX WITH MY HUSBAND?

2021
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,861
 YEAH.

2022
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:26,862
WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO DONATE

2023
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:28,664
THE DICK, I SAID ON

2024
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,232
ONE CONDITION--

2025
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:33,335
I GET VISITATION RIGHTS.

2026
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,604
 I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

2027
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,673
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

2028
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,275
 OH, HE MUST'VE GIVEN ME,

2029
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:41,610
WHAT, NINE, TEN ORGASMS.

2030
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,913
HELL, I LOST TRACK.

2031
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,718
 JOHN BOY WAS LIKE A KID

2032
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:53,689
WITH A NEW TOY.

2033
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,391
BREAK A LEG.

2034
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:03,832
 ( grunts )

2035
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,335
 ( all chattering )

2036
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,237
 JOHN? JOHN?

2037
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:08,737
 I'M HERE.

2038
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:09,438
 YOU OKAY?

2039
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:09,939
 I'M HERE.

2040
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:10,739
 HEY, MORE COFFEE?

2041
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:11,440
 NO.

2042
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,274
 YOU GONNA VOMIT AGAIN?

2043
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:12,908
YOU OKAY?

2044
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,376
 DID I VOMIT BEFORE?

2045
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,978
 YEAH. YEAH.

2046
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:16,845
HOW YOU FEEL?

2047
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:18,247
 I FEEL GOOD.

2048
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,014
 YOU'RE DOING GREAT,

2049
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:20,616
BUT TRY TO GET MORE OUT OF IT.

2050
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:21,383
 MORE?

2051
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:22,618
 YEAH. OH.

2052
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,323
 HI, LENORA.

2053
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:29,959
BOY, YOU LOOK REAL GOOD.

2054
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:31,293
 THANKS.

2055
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:34,897
HOW'S YOUR PENIS?

2056
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,298
