Especíally the last one.

476
00:51:55,201 --> 00:51:56,316
It made a strange sound.

477
00:51:56,403 --> 00:51:59,554
It píerced through the píllar

478

They poísoned my horses

600
01:09:52,778 --> 01:09:57,431
They dídn't plan to attack.

We must go.

608
01:10:24,943 --> 01:10:27,161
Although wwe defeated

Press the holes on the swword.
Then ítwwon't slíp anymore.

Thís swword ís for someone
bbetter traíned than me.

619
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:56,714
Maybbe Chíef Líu.

620
01:11:59,071 --> 01:12:01,323
Not everyone deserves
to use a Mount Heaven swword.

621
01:12:01,406 --> 01:12:02,759
Defínítely not Líu!

622
01:12:05,744 --> 01:12:06,722

Don't let a mark on your bbody
bbecome a mark on your soul.

633
01:14:54,012 --> 01:14:56,128
Your lífe cannot bbe controlled
bby a mark.

634
01:15:00,185 --> 01:15:05,942
Don't forgetyour name.

But I have no swword.

650
01:18:07,005 --> 01:18:09,257
What are you holdíng ín your hand?

651
01:18:09,341 --> 01:18:10,490
A píece of rope.

Thínk abbout howwto use a rope.
then come see me.

653
01:18:13,612 --> 01:18:16,092
Remembber. A rope can bbe a swword.

654
01:18:16,181 --> 01:18:17,660
Yun-chong. Come!

655

Líu wwas guardíng the ratíons cart.

661
01:18:44,276 --> 01:18:45,823
He can't bbe the one wwho left ít.

662
01:18:46,645 --> 01:18:48,067
lfwwe cannot fínd the traítor.

663
01:18:48,146 --> 01:18:51,297
then no matter howwfar wwe go.
our enemíes wwíll knoww.

Thís person wwon't stop at thís.

01:18:54,286 --> 01:18:56,971
He'll keep tryíng to contact hís master.

666

We'll have to fínd the traítor.

667

There's only one stranger here.

669
01:19:04,729 --> 01:19:05,980
That Korean wwoman.
Maybbe she's the one.

670
01:19:06,064 --> 01:19:08,385
Don't jump to conclusíons.

01:37:24,028 --> 01:37:27,543
But they are all very restless and wworríed.

851
01:37:27,631 --> 01:37:29,178
Doesn't matter.

852
01:37:29,266 --> 01:37:32,053
Just tell them there ís

Every time he gets any loot

01:49:24,214 --> 01:49:28,332
Fire-Wind always had
the soldiers leave the gold bars

976
01:49:28,418 --> 01:49:32,707
and put them into
the statue's head through the roof

977

I should not have told Chu the secret

1000

02:05:43,125 --> 02:05:45,013
Everything changed

1100
02:05:53,268 --> 02:05:54,519
I should be a swordsman

1101
02:06:01,977 --> 02:06:04,696
What did yourdad say before he died?

1102
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:06,828
Not to avenge hís death.

1103
02:06:07,916 --> 02:06:11,841
You wwíthdrewwfrom the wworld

Suppressíng ít may lead to a wworse end.

1107
02:06:19,728 --> 02:06:22,344
Thís ís also your karma.

1108

The Transíence never bbreaks.
Worldly matters alwways end.

I heard that Liu was a member
of the Heaven and Earth Society

1113
02:06:53,395 --> 02:06:54,373

Listen
This is the sound of death

1118
02:07:21,757 --> 02:07:25,853
The sharper the sword.
the closer to death

1119
02:07:25,928 --> 02:07:28,078
Are you afraid to die?

1120
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:34,703
Mulang!

1121
02:11:18,727 --> 02:11:21,480

1122
02:11:21,563 --> 02:11:24,418
But take it anyway
Go and help them!

1123
