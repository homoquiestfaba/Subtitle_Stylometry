Tago Clearing Film Studio presents

00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:12,392
in association with Omnes Films

3
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,972
Ham on Rye

4
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:33,408
Good morning!

5
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,481
What's up!

6
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:58,650
Bye Mom! Bye Dad!

7
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,053
Bye Uncle Joe!

8
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,183
Are we gonna be late?

9
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:56,351
Yeah

10
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:58,211
Well, that's the idea.

11
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:02,173
We don't want to rush a day we're gonna
remember "for the rest of our lives"

12
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:06,319
Is anyone else really stuffy in here?
Can we open a window or something?

13
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:08,237
I'm not stuffy at all.

14
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:09,989
Carl, get out.

15
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:13,034
Well, we should get going, right?

16
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:15,967
Hello, we want to be late

17
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:17,455
Right

18
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:21,709
Do we like this with my dress?

19
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,924
I think the guys will like it

20
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,176
Yeah, me too.

21
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,813
...how do you hit something four hundred and fifty feet
with a round bat against a round ball?

22
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,360
The field is a diamond, though.

23
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,730
Yeah...

24
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,490
But anyways, those guys are athletes.

25
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,070
They train year round, you know they're in great shape,

26
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,250
they run, they lift weights, I mean you have to be--

27
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,420
Trisha Marie!

28
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh you're beautiful!

29
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,750
Picture!

30
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,460
Picture, Trisha Marie!

31
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,260
Beautiful! Beautiful, honey, beautiful!

32
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,970
Pictures pictures pictures!

33
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,100
-So pretty!
-Smile! Smile!

34
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,390
Oh if your uncle could see you now! Oh, I'm gonna cry!

35
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,100
Picture! Photo!

36
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,770
Show the teeth!

37
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Oh, you're so beautiful.

38
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,480
Smile, girls! For Grandma!

39
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,690
For Grandma!

40
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,990
Here we go!

41
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,740
The dresses, the dresses, oh they're just beautiful

42
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,740
So pretty

43
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,740
Oh, they look just beautiful.

44
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,080
I'm gonna cry again, just beautiful.

45
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,450
I wish I was that young again!

46
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Oh, honey!

47
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,440
Say "Monty's!"

48
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,620
Here we go!

49
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,330
-What up, dude?
-Yeah!

50
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,840
Yeah!

51
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,800
Let's go!

52
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,010
Hey, whoa whoa whoa, no milk in the car!

53
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,380
No milk in the car!

54
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,470
Yeah dude!

55
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,020
Here we go!

56
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,620
Hey, how are you, how are you?

57
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,740
Thank you so much.

58
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,620
You know, I was telling my boy

59
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,790
they don't really appreciate the opportunities
that they have today.

60
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,630
You know, when I was his age I was working three jobs.

61
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,090
You know what I mean?

62
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,340
But -- thank you so much! Really--

63
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Okay... Alright...

64
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,630
Don't mess it up!

65
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,430
Don't mess it up!

66
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,430
Don't mess it up!

67
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,210
So... I was thinking

68
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,130
You know how you said porking is the ultimate purpose?

69
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,720
Well, what about the doctors
and nurses in the emergency room?

70
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,010
I mean... they give you a full recovery

71
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,640
Isn't that more important than hot action?

72
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,390
No

73
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,000
I really have to shit.

74
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,580
Then do it.

75
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,090
Uh, duh, where?

76
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,500
Like in one of these houses.

77
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,550
That's weird as fuck.

78
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,880
Isn't there a restroom at Monty's?

79
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,890
Oh yeah, you want her to go into Monty's
and have everyone smell her enormous crap?

80
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,190
You know what? Fuck it.

81
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,990
I cannot believe she just did that.

82
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,700
I hope they're not like freak murderers or something.

83
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,200
I mean, it looks like a nice house,
they're probably good people.

84
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,290
True

85
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,210
Wait wait wait, so hold on

86
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,300
you say that porking is the ultimate purpose
because it creates more human beings, right?

87
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,050
Yes, it's the purpose.

88
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,940
That's the whole point.

89
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,300
Right, so...

90
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,140
if that's the case, where does that leave, like

91
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,390
you know, gay people and bisexual people?

92
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,160
Do they have half a purpose or no purpose at all?

93
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,280
So Trish, I got to talk to you about something

94
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,790
What's up?

95
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,540
Uh, I've just been thinking about Monty's.

96
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,170
Okay...

97
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,710
Don't you think the whole thing is, like, a little bit weird?

98
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,960
Weird like what?

99
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,510
Uh, I don't know the whole thing
is just kind of strange, like...

100
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,930
if you think about it, it's just...

101
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,850
It just makes me kind of uncomfortable.

102
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,370
But don't you love the food there?

103
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,080
Yeah, I love the food at Monty's.

104
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,580
Me too.

105
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,350
One time I got third place, I'm going:

106
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,310
"You're giving first place to a Ford Galaxy?

107
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,560
That puts the 'b' in 'boring' when it comes to a car.

108
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,230
I've got an aqua blue Barracuda convertible,
I'm not even placing?"

109
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,450
It's just stupid.

110
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,450
But, you know, it's a lot of fun,
although I always come back with indigestion

111
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,780
you know, and the wife hates me for it

112
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,000
so I take an Alka Seltzer for it or something
just to get my stomach to stop

113
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,620
making all these noises...

114
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,810
Gwen,

115
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,190
I'm so good.

116
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,520
Life is so good.

117
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,020
Honestly, everything is so good.

118
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,980
Love, your sister Amy

119
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,360
She sent you that?

120
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,830
She has the handwriting of your mom,
it's like old person handwriting.

121
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,730
Well she is older.

122
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,410
Wow, being older is, like...

123
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,500
really good.

124
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,130
Well... soon enough we'll be too.

125
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,010
Some of us are close to seventeen.

126
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,930
Uh, when did you get it? The card?

127
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,390
Um, apparently it came like a week ago,
but my mom gave it to me like yesterday.

128
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,390
What?

129
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,230
Can I see the back?

130
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,320
Can you read it again?

131
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,530
Gwen,

132
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,030
I'm so good.

133
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,450
Life is so good.

134
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Honestly, everything is so good.

135
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,660
Love, your sister Amy

136
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,130
Haley, can I see your corsage for a second?

137
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,290
Uh, sure.

138
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,470
Oh, it looks so good on you.

139
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,550
Thank you, I feel like you're too pale for it.

140
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,050
Hey, shut up!

141
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,270
Hey, uh...

142
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,360
Do you guys think we're gonna be like Amy?

143
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,940
Like... happy?

144
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,740
No, like...

145
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,200
where do you think we'll go?

146
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,830
You think too much.

147
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,120
I'm being serious.

148
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,790
Yeah, me too.

149
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,750
I have an idea.

150
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,460
Instead of thinking too much you can listen
to like a song in your head or something.

151
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,670
Right

152
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,420
I'll help.

153
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,280
My aunt moved out to the country.

154
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,960
She had her kids there and stopped working.

155
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,790
I would too, though. Who wants to live here?

156
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,840
She just, like, cooks all day.

157
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,920
That must be nice.

158
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,720
Yeah

159
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,140
Kind of boring, though.

160
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,390
Yeah, I'd want to go traveling somewhere every once in a while.

161
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,100
I don't know where I want to go.

162
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,270
Maybe...

163
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,020
the midwest?

164
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,770
Really?

165
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,530
How boring.

166
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,780
Well... open land is nice.

167
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,780
Oh, did you guys hear? They painted
the hands on Monty's sign green.

168
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,290
I heard that.

169
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,620
Oh my gosh, do you guys think David's going to show up?

170
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,290
I hope not!

171
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,840
I think he actually likes you though.

172
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,090
-Oh my gosh, yes!
-Deject him!

173
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,310
Son...

174
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,440
when I was your age...

175
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,860
around forty years ago today...

176
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,400
I thought a person couldn't be too eager.

177
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,410
I wanted it all, I tried...

178
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,870
No one tried harder than I did.

179
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,540
Well, we talked about it enough...

180
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,960
Talking's over. Now it's time to act.

181
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,920
Go get 'em, kiddo.

182
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,930
This is not good.

183
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,760
It's not good.

184
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,720
It's fine.

185
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,850
We're across the street.

186
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,220
We're so close.

187
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,060
-This is not good.
-It's not good.

188
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,060
It looks like a panic attack.

189
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,190
-It's not a panic attack.
-I think it's a panic attack.

190
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,070
It's a panic attack.
Artie, get him water or something.

191
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,360
Look, I don't know, just do something.

192
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,450
We've been walking for three miles.
It's fatigue, trust me.

193
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,080
That doesn't change the fact that it
still looks like he's having a panic attack.

194
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,870
Maybe we should carry him.
How much does he weigh?

195
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,380
Hey, buddy!

196
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,840
Hey, Jim!

197
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,930
Buddy...

198
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,090
Brother...

199
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,800
You look good.

200
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,220
Yeah, how's your fatigue?

201
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,910
I didn't have any, I was like "Is this even reality?"

202
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,170
It's not like mustard and ke--

203
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,090
it's like two separate lines on the hot dog--
it's like how do you do that?

204
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,760
I didn't know if it was gonna be cold out

205
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,010
because I've never been here before, so just to be prepared...

206
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,110
Dude!

207
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,900
Dude!

208
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,950
I cannot believe you said that about Janitza!

209
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Is it true?

210
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,530
She's gonna go crazy.

211
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,160
She's gonna lose it.

212
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm stoked

213
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,790
This is gonna be intense,
this is gonna be super intense.

214
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,910
Are we videotaping this?

215
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,080
Yeah, dude, we'll videotape the
whole thing, we'll frame it nicely

216
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,170
and then as soon as those fists
start flying, boom boom boom

217
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,000
It's gonna be awesome.

218
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,380
I want to get right in there on the action.

219
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,760
I'm so happy I'm gonna
get away from her this summer.

220
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,890
Yeah, she finally stopped giving
so much homework, though.

221
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,140
That's good.

222
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,970
I mean... I wouldn't say that

223
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,970
In my class we got so much homework.

224
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,680
Are you kidding?

225
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,640
Yeah, it was ridiculous.

226
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,650
Like the past two months, I've just--

227
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,060
Wait...

228
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:02,860
Where'd you get that?

229
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,190
Oh, I'm sorry do you want some?

230
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,740
Uh, hi

231
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,160
Hi

232
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Uh, I'm not--

233
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,540
I don't know how to really word this, but um...

234
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,960
Do you know Jamie?

235
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,210
Sure

236
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,170
Yeah, okay. Uh...

237
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,670
He's been saying some...

238
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,760
pretty messed up shit about you.

239
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,590
I don't know if you care or not.

240
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,760
When they invented mathematics...

241
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,140
they took a picture of the sky...

242
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,980
and they flipped it around

243
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,520
and they had sponges back then

244
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,570
so they put a sponge right on the middle of the picture

245
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,360
and it expanded.

246
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,030
And that's--

247
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,830
That's the beginning of everything.

248
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,410
I think I heard somebody tell me that.

249
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,160
It just got bigger and bigger?

250
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,750
And that's actually how they invented the vacuum, too.

251
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,230
Okay

252
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,280
Okay

253
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,890
-Okay okay
-Okay

254
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,940
Hey

255
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,320
What's up?

256
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,610
I'm Nick, this is Nicholas.

257
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,370
We live just off Maple Avenue.

258
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,280
Hey, I'm Gwen

259
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,200
It's a pleasure

260
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,500
You eating anything good?

261
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,500
-Ham on rye
-Just a reuben

262
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,880
Cool, cool

263
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,550
I noticed your dress

264
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,960
You did?

265
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,760
It's a good dress

266
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,380
Thanks

267
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,430
What about my dress?

268
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,720
It's also a good dress

269
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,910
I feel bad.

270
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,870
Yup

271
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Well... it's only a mile walk back.

272
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,340
Yeah and he seemed fine when we left him.

273
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,670
Relatively.

274
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,430
Yeah, and it's only like walking to his house.

275
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,600
He's not in any danger or anything.

276
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,770
It's only a mile and a half

277
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,400
More like a mile and a quarter?

278
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,860
Yeah

279
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,140
...gluten, it's very bad for you.

280
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,020
Some people can't tolerate it. It also has many negative health effects.

281
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,770
I also do not do dairy

282
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,900
the barbaric way they treat their cows, I can't be a part of that

283
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,070
although if you do do cheese, please keep it at a minimum

284
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,990
But eggs, please do not prepare my food anywhere near eggs

285
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,540
Eggs come from chickens, and chickens
are kept in overcrowded henhouses

286
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,870
Yeah, okay...

287
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,790
Let me see if I can get that for you, alright?

288
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Can you just get a--

289
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,840
Yeah, I'm on it, don't worry about it

290
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,110
Mr. Monty?

291
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,660
The grinder's still busted.

292
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,540
How do you want the ham?

293
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,460
You know I hate working today, right?

294
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,010
Funny

295
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,800
I don't see you working.

296
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,720
Right now you're just standing there.

297
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,990
You know

298
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,700
I think I'm starting to get it.

299
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,040
What everyone was talking about?

300
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,830
Everything just feels...

301
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,920
nice. I feel like I'm where I belong.

302
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,550
It just feels like...

303
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,140
everything's exactly where it needs to be.

304
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,520
What's your name?

305
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,370
Hey Gwen, um...

306
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,540
sorry for...

307
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,040
leaving Monty's

308
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,500
I know that was kind of sudden

309
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,080
I should have said something.

310
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,670
But, yeah...

311
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,260
Call me back

312
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,050
Thanks

313
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,530
Katie, hey

314
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,210
it's Haley

315
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,580
Just wondering where you are

316
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,170
Call me back if you can

317
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,710
Bye

318
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,780
Hey honey

319
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:44,860
Yeah

320
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:46,650
What?

321
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,320
I don't know, I mean what can I say, I mean...

322
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,450
He fell.

323
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,870
He fell in a pothole.

324
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,290
Yeah

325
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,880
Yep

326
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,050
Yes

327
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,830
It's broken.

328
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,470
The fibular

329
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,140
The fibular!

330
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,390
What?

331
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,770
No... no

332
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,230
Nope, he uh...

333
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,410
No, he did not even get there.

334
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,740
He didn't make it.

335
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,400
I see you

336
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,120
Where's the top of his hat?

337
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,850
Hey cheer up, man.

338
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:07,220
Cheer up?

339
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,650
He shouldn't think about it.

340
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,690
That's what I do.

341
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,700
I was just like "I'm not gonna think about this."

342
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,410
And I'm still not.

343
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,870
That's nice, Garth.

344
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,040
Yeah

345
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,550
That's what you should do, Sloan.

346
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:46,180
Yeah

347
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,930
Look man...

348
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,310
It sucks and like...

349
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,560
you can let it suck or...

350
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,730
you can not let it suck.

351
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,030
Or something.

352
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,620
Yeah, man.

353
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,440
I got half price on radiated last month.

354
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,980
You should come down.

355
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,610
I'm happy, you know that?

356
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,600
Why did you do that?

357
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,010
There were flies on it.

358
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,350
Earlier.

359
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:19,410
So how's everybody been sleeping?

360
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,130
Two, please.

361
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,560
Do I get a second chance?

362
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:55,380
What's up with this guy?

363
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,090
You still working at Monty's?

364
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,970
That's a little masochistic, isn't it?

365
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,730
Chill out, Snake.

366
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,020
What the hell's wrong with you?

367
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,380
We can't see it

368
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,630
but

369
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,880
if you get a really good microscope

370
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,680
and you look really hard

371
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,310
you still can't see it.

372
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:03,000
I was twenty years old when I saw my first...

373
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,050
oyster.

374
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,470
Oysters make pearls.

375
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:15,270
Pearls go on necklaces.

376
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:23,020
Ritzy boys and girls wear necklaces.

377
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,820
They sell necklaces at jewelers.

378
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:36,750
Jewelers occupy shopping districts.

379
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,170
Shopping districts are occasionally...

380
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,930
converted into malls.

381
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:54,470
My uncle owns a mall.

382
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:58,850
I don't like my uncle.

383
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,550
I have an idea

384
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:23,050
Let's call your brother at BAU.

385
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,100
Wouldn't you like to hear from your brother?

386
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,580
Hello?

387
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,910
Daniel!

388
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:56,380
Daniel, it's me, Dad.

389
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:01,210
I went by the campus, and I didn't see you.

390
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,010
Hi Dad

391
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,930
We're all here having dinner.

392
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,350
What?

393
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,770
We're all here having dinner.

394
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,650
Haley's here.

395
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:21,900
She's gonna be

396
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,490
sticking around.

397
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:27,450
Haley's there?

398
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:30,620
How's college, Daniel?

399
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,910
It's good, I'm just sitting.

400
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,250
You're just--

401
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,790
You're just what?

402
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:41,670
Hello?

403
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:43,760
Is he wearing his coat?

404
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:48,090
Daniel, are you wearing your coat?

405
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:55,230
Yes

406
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:00,310
We got Haley a fishtank for her birthday.

407
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,980
Why don't you tell her about your experience with college?

408
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:09,200
What was that?

409
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,030
Are you there, Daniel?

410
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:19,290
I really can't hear you.

411
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,340
Alright, well it was good to hear from you Daniel.

412
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,920
Buh-bye.

413
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,930
Hey, it's me Trish, but you probably knew that.

414
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:22,350
Leave me a voicemail and I'll get back to you whenever.

415
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,520
Bye!

416
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,020
Hey, Trish

417
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:32,480
it's Haley

418
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,780
Could you call me back or something? I just...

419
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:40,080
I don't know why you're not getting any of these, so...

420
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,990
Yeah, thanks.

421
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:10,730
Gwen?

422
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:12,810
Are you here?

423
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:20,070
Hello?

424
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:34,540
Gary!

425
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,920
Gary!

426
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:39,920
Gary!
