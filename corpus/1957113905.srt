favorite painting.

16

staring at it.

- Hmm.

18
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,261
- So, what are you
going to do, Abygail?

19
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:13,296
- I don't know.

20
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,264
I never expected judge Travers

21
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:18,025
to leave me a thing,
let alone be so generous.

You've been with us since...

I can't remember
when you weren't here.

25
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:25,550
- Just a minute.

26
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,250
You can never quite tell
what's inside

27
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:39,046
a person's private heart
and soul.

28
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,395
Your father didn't talk
much about himself,

29
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,535
but you can tell a lot
about a person

30
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,297
by what they hold onto
over the years.

31
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:52,991
- Well, what is it?

32
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,787
- It's something your daddy
should have told you about.

33
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:59,515
But you know men.
They put things off.

34
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,310
- No, not daddy.

35
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:04,451
He was Mr. Discipline,
Mr. Schedule, Mr. Perfect.

36
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:07,316
- That was his judge's persona.

37
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,593
That was how most people
saw him,

38
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:10,698
but he was still a man.

39
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,286
- You know what's in here,
don't you?

40
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:15,496
- Yes. He showed it to me once

41

debating how to tell you.

42
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:20,881
But he just never
got around to it.

43
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:28,337

if you want to talk.

Hey, Nat.

48
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:35,680
You shouldn't have had
to call me.

49
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:37,371
I should have come
on my own.

50
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:40,132
What's up?

51
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,686

to show you.

Can you believe it?

54
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:52,697
- I'm sorry.
I don't get it.

55
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:57,909
- My father, the ever honest judge Charles Everett Travers,

56
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,531
he was married before.

57
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:01,568
- Before?
- Before my mother.

58
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:02,879
Yeah, it's a little secret

59
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:04,571
that he carried to his grave
with him.

60
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:09,023
Why didn't he ever tell me?

61
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,818
- I'm sure he had his reasons
for not telling you.

62
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:13,027
- Oh, don't defend him.
- There's nothing to defend.

63
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:14,512
I'm just saying that he probably had his reasons

64
00:06:14,546 --> 00:06:16,928
for not telling you this.

65
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,517
I never know what to do
in these situations.

00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:21,139
- What situations?

67
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,899
When was the last time
a friend of yours came to you

68
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,177
and said that her father
was married before her mother

69
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:27,594
and to a trick rider no less.

70
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:28,940
- A trick rider?

71
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,873
- Yes, a cowgirl.

72
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:34,946
She rode horses in a rodeo
like a sideshow clown.

73
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,811
- Well, she rode horses.
You ride horses.

74
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:41,470
- I am not a cowgirl.
- Well, they were very young.

75
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:43,126
- I wonder if my mother knew.

76
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:45,577
- Well, I'm sure she knew that he had a life before they met.

77
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:47,545
I mean, people do remarry.

78
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:50,237
And I'm sure that if
she lived longer

79
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,687
she would have told you.

80
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,585
- But how come
he didn't tell me?

81
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,760
- Well...

82
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:59,488
Check her out.
She's pretty cool.

83
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,490
I mean, look at those clothes.

84
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:03,112
I dig that hat.

85
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:08,600
I bet she stood on the back
on galloping horses.

86

Don't you kind of wonder
what they had together?

87

I'm impressed.

- Well, have to be here
at the crack of dawn

115
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,934
as if anyone but a moron
needs gas at this hour.

116
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:42,763
- Jess, if she's still
holding on up there,

117
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:45,594
should be service
for something in this world

118

even if it's for us morons.

119
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:55,742
What's this?
Some new policy?

120
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:58,123
I give you a ten.
You give me a fifty?

121
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,608
- It's the fifty you gave me
for Jess.

122
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:01,092
- I told you to put this
in her fruit jar.

123
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:02,921
- I did, but she took
one look at it

124
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,923
and knew exactly
where it came from.

125
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,684
Says you know she's not

- Well, no, I’m...
I'm looking for someone.

Actually, I'm writing an article on old rodeo performers,

161
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:41,770
and I understand one of them
used to live around here.

162

- Lots of 'em.
It's kind of a mecca.

00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:46,188
Or it was. Well, those days
are gone for good.

Um, chili's good today.

166
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:51,745
- One chili, Billy!

167
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,887

- Oh, no. Thank you.

west of town at shady grove.

181

You take the first dirt road to your right, look for the names.

Her place is the newest.

He'll slither off as soon as

you're not going to hurt him.

194
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,098
Must be a nest
around here somewhere.

195

I see one almost every time
I come out.

just wiggling and writhing
all over the place.

It's really interesting.

- You don't look like
you're from around here.

209
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,267
You got family buried here
or something?

- Uh-uh.

244
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,233

245
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:08,820
who's not a coffee drinker.

246

- Oh...

247
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:13,825
This looks like
an old pinup photo.

248
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,105
- Mm. Maggie Mae was painted
on the nose of a b17

249
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:18,830
during the second world war.

came all the way from Chicago

just to meet her.

252
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,526
Do they do this sort of thing
a lot?

253
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,184
- Beg your pardon?

254
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,806
- Do they assign something
to somebody

255
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,842
who doesn't really know
what they're writing about?

256

to do the research.

I'm going to be

all you want, ok.

thing to say.

I came, and I did my job.

She's trying to fulfill
a promise.

they get in my herd.

as her mother was.

It's not my problem.

drill on this land.

a little while.

Maggie Mae to Charlie.

hire an attorney

00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,242
and sue him for drilling rights?

530

00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:26,605
from those poor old horses being ground up into pet food.

699
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,058
- It's not just about the lease,
Jess.

700
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:32,680
- Tom, you weren't a good liar in high school,

701
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:34,579
and you're not a good liar
now.

702
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:36,512
- What's that supposed to mean?

703
00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:38,583
- Inviting me
to the senior prom,

704
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,170
telling me I was
your only choice

705
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:42,172
when three other girls
had already turned you down.

706
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:45,486
[Laughter]

707
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:47,177
- [Laughs]

708
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:48,593
[Laughing and chattering]

709
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:57,533
- I need two burgers
to go, please.

710
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:59,638
- Wait, wait. I just want
to know... did you go?

711
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:01,744
- Where?
- To the prom with Tom?

712
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:04,712
- Well, heck yeah I went.
I was crazy about him then.

713
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:06,645
- [Laughs]
- I don't know why.

714
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,030
- Billy! Billy!
Two burgers to go!

715
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:19,624
- I haven't seen you
in those for some time.

716
00:40:19,658 --> 00:40:21,936
- Yeah, I'm glad they still fit.

717
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:24,007
I am going riding.

718
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:25,492
My horse has become
more of an investment

719
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:26,769
than a pleasure,

720
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:27,804
and I just hope
I remember how.

721
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,254
- Oh, you'll be just fine.

722
00:40:29,288 --> 00:40:31,739
It's just like riding a bicycle.You never forget.

723
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,603
- I remember you teaching me
how to ride a bike.

724
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:35,985
- You got so many scrapes
on your knees

725
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:39,022
I went through two boxes
of band-aids.

726
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:41,818
[Laughs] Your father almost had
a conniption fit.

727
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,475
[Laughs and sighs]

728
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:46,513
Have fun!

729
00:41:10,847 --> 00:41:12,953
- Hey, Natalie.
Good to see you back.

730
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,575
- Hey, J.J.
It's good to be back.

731
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,921
Ah. Hi, Bobby.

732
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:16,991
- Good to see you.
Been a long time.

733
00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:18,579
- Yeah.

734
00:41:18,614 --> 00:41:19,994
- Tristan will be real happy
you're back.

735
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:21,893
Not that I haven't taken
good care of him myself.

736
00:41:21,927 --> 00:41:23,653
- Oh no, I'm sure you take
excellent care of him.

737
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:25,621
- Do you want me to tack him
and warm him up for you?

738
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:26,829
- Yeah, please.
- All right.

739
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:48,989
- Ho.

740
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:50,922
[Sighs]
Hey.

741
00:41:50,956 --> 00:41:55,547
You ever want to just run,
just take off like the wind?

742
00:41:55,582 --> 00:41:57,169
Huh?

743
00:41:57,204 --> 00:42:00,656
I'm sorry it's been
such a long time, old man.

744
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,899
I haven't had
my priorities straight.

745
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:05,039
All right, let's go.
[Clicks tongue]

746
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:06,316
[Clucking]

747
00:42:06,351 --> 00:42:07,766
- Here you go.

748
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:18,674
- Hey.

749
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,607
- I thought you left
about an hour ago.

750
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:23,713
- Whoa. Old buster here
was hard to catch.

751
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:26,716
Maybe he feels the same way
I do about riding the fence.

752
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:29,788
You know, this was
your mama's promise.

753
00:42:29,823 --> 00:42:31,859
- Well, if it bothers you
that much...

754
00:42:31,894 --> 00:42:35,345
Here.

755
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,590
Feel that strong about it,
then I'll do it.

756
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,765
I'll do it myself.

757
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:42,663
- Don't you ever get upset?

758
00:42:42,698 --> 00:42:44,872
Always nice and calm.

759
00:42:44,907 --> 00:42:46,322
- Lulu, there's
a few things in life

760
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,876
you can only do properly
if your heart's in it.

761
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:50,740
- I should have kept
my mouth shut.

762
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:53,605
- No. No, you shouldn't have.

763
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,882
Lulu, look at me.

764
00:42:57,091 --> 00:42:58,921
I do care about
what's in your heart.

765
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:00,612
I always want you to tell me,
ok?

766
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,968
And you're right.
It was my mama's promise.

767
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,972
- Darn it!

768
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:17,353
[Thud]
[Horse whinnies]

769
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,631
[Sighs]

770
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,391
- Ah!
[Gasps]

771
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:22,220
- Jess!

772
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:25,913
Jess, are you...

773
00:43:25,948 --> 00:43:27,639
- I'm alive, I'm alive.

774
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:30,746
- This is all my fault.

775
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,748
Let's get you up.

776
00:43:32,782 --> 00:43:35,820
- Oh, no. I can't.
Something's broke.

777
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:37,891
- I'll be back quick.

778
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:39,962
- Yeah, I'll be right here.

779
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:48,660
[Rooster crowing]

780
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:51,698
- Now this is going to be
real cold at first,

781
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:56,806
but you have to leave it on
for ten minutes, all right.

782
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:59,775
- Do you really think
she's your sister?

783
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:02,778
- When I was little
mom and Maggie Mae

784
00:44:02,812 --> 00:44:04,814
talked about a guy
named Charlie.

785
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:07,127
- Well, at least now we know
he really existed.

786
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:09,474
- Yeah, well, you're
living proof

787
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:11,096
that he existed.
[Laughs]

788
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:12,442
- He never knew about me.

789
00:44:12,477 --> 00:44:14,721
- Why not?

790
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:16,792
- They lived on a little ranch outside of Santa Fe,

791
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:19,173
and, you know, they're all
happy and in love and stuff.

792
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:21,831
And one day I guess
they just woke up,

793
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:23,419
realized they were
from two different worlds.

794
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,732
And so he...

795
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,803
He went on out to Los Angeles.

796
00:44:27,837 --> 00:44:30,978
He was expecting Maggie Mae
to follow him.

797
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:34,810
- Yeah. Knowing Maggie Mae,
she'd have none of that.

798
00:44:34,844 --> 00:44:37,053
- She told him she was
going to follow him.

799
00:44:38,848 --> 00:44:41,368
[Sighs] You know, I grew up
my whole life

800
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:43,715
thinking Maggie Mae
wasn't afraid of anything.

801
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,823
But she was. She was...

802
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:50,722
She was afraid that one of them was always going to have to be

803
00:44:50,757 --> 00:44:52,828
giving up too much.

804
00:44:52,862 --> 00:44:54,243
You know, she didn't want it
to be him.

805
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:57,833
So, after he left,
she filed for divorce,

806
00:44:57,867 --> 00:45:00,111
and then she found out
she was pregnant.

807
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:02,113
And then she couldn't
rodeo anymore.

808
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:05,910
So she came out, she got
as close as she dared get,

809
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:08,050
and just watched him from afar.

810
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:09,983
She was always
proud of him.

811
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:11,916
- She never told him
about you?

812
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,918
- No.

813
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:17,784
Guess she started to once,
you know, after I was born,

814
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,889
but, uh, by that time
she found out

815
00:45:19,924 --> 00:45:22,374
that he was engaged to be married to Natalie's mama.

816
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:26,965
[Sniffs] And she didn't
want to cause him anymore pain.

817
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,313
- Ah, that's a tough one
for a young girl.

818
00:45:30,348 --> 00:45:32,419
- You had to live with her decision all your life.

819
00:45:34,076 --> 00:45:36,872
What does miss prissy pants
have to say about all this?

820
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:38,874
- Yeah, what does she say
about this?

821
00:45:38,908 --> 00:45:39,806
- Hey, can we just drop it?

822
00:45:41,946 --> 00:45:43,223
- Better get going.

823
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:44,534
Don't want to be late
for school.

824
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:49,091
Hope you feel better, Jess.

825
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,092
- Thanks, hon.

826
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:59,791
- Since when does she care
about being late for school?

827
00:45:59,826 --> 00:46:01,241
- [Laughs]

828
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:02,829
- Look, I've got to
get out here.

829
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:05,210
But I'm going to be back soon,all right.

830
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:07,109
You stay put.

831
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:15,600
[Traffic sounds]

832
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:18,499
[Phones ringing]
[Muted conversations]

833
00:46:24,851 --> 00:46:27,025
- Hey.
- Hello.

834
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,027
- I'm here to see
Natalie Travers. Is she in?

835
00:46:29,062 --> 00:46:31,581
- Do you have an appointment?
- This is a family emergency.

836
00:46:31,616 --> 00:46:33,376
- Family emergency?

837
00:46:33,411 --> 00:46:35,862
- Natalie's sister
is sort of my mother.

838
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:37,311
- That would make you Lulu.

839
00:46:37,346 --> 00:46:39,866
- You know her, Larry?

840
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,832
- I'll take it from here, Nance.

841
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:47,632
Well, you're exactly
as Nat described.

842
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,358
- Am I supposed to know you?

843
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:50,359
- Oh, no.

844
00:46:50,393 --> 00:46:51,947
I'm Larry Griskin,

845
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:54,363
Nat's best and sometimes
only friend.

846
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:57,055
- You sound like Sam.
- The vet?

847
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,954
- She told you about Sam, too?

848
00:46:58,988 --> 00:47:01,232
- I believe I detected a little
something-something there.

849
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:04,925
- I detected the same
something-something from Sam.

850
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,964
- So...why are you here?

851
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:10,897
- I really need to see her.

852
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:11,656
- Well, she's been coming
into work a little later

853
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,382
every other day,

854
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,660
and she's calling it getting her priorities straight.

855
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:17,627
- Well, I need to talk to her
about those priorities.

856
00:47:17,662 --> 00:47:20,216
- Ok.

857
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:23,185
Well, you'll find her here.

858
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:26,188
There you go.

859
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:28,086
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

860
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:33,851
Oh, Lulu, it's that way.

861
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:37,199
- Nice talking to you.

862
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:50,419
Do you know where I can find
Natalie Travers?

863
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:52,214
- Over there.

864
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:57,046
- Hey.

865
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:58,910
- Hey, can I help you?

866
00:47:58,945 --> 00:48:01,948
- Yeah, do you know where
I can find Natalie Travers?

867
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:04,019
- Yeah, sure.
She's right out there.

868
00:48:08,126 --> 00:48:09,231
She's really something, huh?

869
00:48:11,302 --> 00:48:13,235
- Yeah, she is.

870
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:23,245

01:06:40,513 --> 01:06:42,550
- He was a big deal
in her life.

1214
01:06:42,584 --> 01:06:46,071
- What if they'd just
taken the chance?

1215
01:06:46,105 --> 01:06:48,521
What if Maggie Mae and Charlie

1216
01:06:48,556 --> 01:06:49,453
had just said
"to heck with everybody else"

1217
01:06:49,488 --> 01:06:51,179
and stuck together?

1218
01:06:51,214 --> 01:06:53,147
- Well, you wouldn't be here
talking to me right now.

1219
01:06:53,181 --> 01:06:56,081
- [Laughs]
That's true.

1220
01:06:56,115 --> 01:07:00,809
- So...what about you?

1221
01:07:00,844 --> 01:07:02,363
Would you have taken
that chance?

1222
01:07:08,093 --> 01:07:10,267
[Knocking]
- Hey.

1223
01:07:10,302 --> 01:07:12,097
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

1224
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:15,065
- Oh no, I'm all out of shoes.- Now I'm all out of boots.

1225
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,412
- [Laughs]
What's up?

1226
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:19,621
- [Sighs]

1227
01:07:19,656 --> 01:07:21,692
There's something
I thought you should know.

1228
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,282
I watch you struggle with this night after night.

1229
01:07:25,317 --> 01:07:28,492
Jess used to write
for the newspaper years ago.

1230
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:31,875
She even started a book
about Maggie Mae,

1231
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:35,258
but she didn't have the courage
to send it to anyone.

1232
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:37,536
I think that's why she's
kind of funny about all this

1233
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:40,194
because you're doing
the very thing

1234
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:41,850
that she always wanted to.

1235
01:07:41,885 --> 01:07:45,095
- [Laughs] Yeah, except
I'm not doing the very thing.

1236
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,270
I mean, you know,
I can write legal briefs

1237
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:49,237
and stuff like that, but when
it comes to creative writing

1238
01:07:49,272 --> 01:07:51,757
I... I... I... suck.

1239
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:53,172
- [Snickers]

1240
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:55,140
- Wow.

1241
01:07:57,176 --> 01:07:58,591
- And then there's Sam.

1242
01:07:58,626 --> 01:07:59,834
- What about Sam?

1243
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:03,872
- Well, I think he's...
You know.

1244
01:08:03,907 --> 01:08:06,289
- No, I don't know.

1245
01:08:06,323 --> 01:08:08,463
- I think he's falling for you.

1246
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:10,603
History repeats itself.

1247
01:08:10,638 --> 01:08:11,708
- What?

1248
01:08:11,742 --> 01:08:13,434
- Your father and Maggie Mae?

1249
01:08:14,814 --> 01:08:15,815
- [Sighs]

1250
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,098
Oh...

1251
01:08:39,632 --> 01:08:41,427
- I want you to see this
for yourself.

1252
01:08:41,462 --> 01:08:45,293
- Yeah.
- [Laughs]

1253
01:08:47,226 --> 01:08:50,471
[Laughs]
She's digging her behind off.

1254
01:08:52,231 --> 01:08:53,922
[Horse approaching]

1255
01:08:55,545 --> 01:08:57,685
- Tom.

1256
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:01,206
- Oh no.

1257
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,518
- You there.
Stop what you're doing.

1258
01:09:03,553 --> 01:09:07,177
Ho! There's to be no drilling
as part of the agreement.

1259
01:09:07,212 --> 01:09:08,661
- Relax, Tom.

1260
01:09:08,696 --> 01:09:10,939
We're not drilling.
You can see that.

1261
01:09:10,974 --> 01:09:14,184
- We've been over this
time and time again.

1262
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:17,394
You and your darn horses
are out of here.

1263
01:09:17,429 --> 01:09:19,500
You best be getting yourself
a lawyer.

1264
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:21,743
- Allow me to introduce
myself.

1265
01:09:21,778 --> 01:09:24,988
I'm Natalie Travers.
I am Jess's attorney

1266
01:09:25,022 --> 01:09:27,680
Bennett, Martin and Jordan
in Los Angeles.

1267
01:09:27,715 --> 01:09:29,234
Perhaps, you've heard of us.

1268
01:09:29,268 --> 01:09:30,580
We're the second largest
firm in the state.

1269
01:09:30,614 --> 01:09:32,478
Now, we have more than enough
proof

1270
01:09:32,513 --> 01:09:34,308
that there was once
a spring here.

1271
01:09:34,342 --> 01:09:35,999
So based on the grandfather
clause of the lease...

1272
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:37,587
page 12, section 8...

1273
01:09:37,621 --> 01:09:40,245
what was there then
is part of the deal now.

1274
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:41,729
- You know where I stand.

1275
01:09:41,763 --> 01:09:44,456
- Yeah, you're standing
on leased land.

1276
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,251
You're trespassing.

1277
01:09:46,285 --> 01:09:47,493
And if you do it again,
I'll see to it

1278
01:09:47,528 --> 01:09:49,012
you spend 30 days
in county jail.

1279
01:09:49,046 --> 01:09:50,876
- [Snickers]
- Jess!

1280
01:09:54,328 --> 01:09:57,538
Ya! Ya!

1281
01:10:07,927 --> 01:10:10,585
- Can't you find anything better than peanut butter and jelly?

1282
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,380
- Oh, I haven't had
one of these in years.

1283
01:10:12,415 --> 01:10:13,588
This is delicious.

1284
01:10:13,623 --> 01:10:14,589
- Can I make you
a cup of tea?

1285
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:16,384
- Oh, I'll have coffee.

1286
01:10:16,419 --> 01:10:18,628
- Coffee.
- Uh-huh.

1287
01:10:18,662 --> 01:10:21,044
- We have corrupted you
all the way to coffee, have we?

1288
01:10:21,078 --> 01:10:23,495
- Well, does this mean that
you trust me now?

1289
01:10:23,529 --> 01:10:26,567
- I didn't say that.
- [Laughs]

1290
01:10:28,085 --> 01:10:31,365
Listen, Jess,
I have a confession.

1291
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:33,056
- I'm listening.

1292
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:36,715
- Well, I really did talk to
a very successful publisher.

1293
01:10:36,749 --> 01:10:38,268
He's a former client of mine,

1294
01:10:38,303 --> 01:10:39,614
and he's very excited
about the book.

1295
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:43,308
And I think we can get
a deal, but...

1296
01:10:43,342 --> 01:10:45,448
- But? That's the hardest part.

1297
01:10:45,482 --> 01:10:46,449
I mean, that's usually
when people give up.

1298
01:10:46,483 --> 01:10:48,278
What do you mean "but"?

1299
01:10:48,313 --> 01:10:50,729
- Well, I tried,
but I'm not a writer.

1300
01:10:50,763 --> 01:10:53,076
And I don't want to
abandon the project

1301
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,388
and just go home.

1302
01:10:54,422 --> 01:10:57,322
And I... I'm just a lawyer.

1303
01:10:57,356 --> 01:10:58,875
- You're a darn good one.

1304
01:10:58,909 --> 01:11:01,084
I can still see Tom's face,
thank you very much.

1305
01:11:01,118 --> 01:11:03,914
- I've got to tell you
the truth about something.

1306
01:11:05,122 --> 01:11:06,641
I used the book

1307
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:08,816
as an excuse
to come back here.

1308
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:12,820
I have a lot of things
to work out in here

1309
01:11:12,854 --> 01:11:15,685
and in here.

1310
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:18,515
Anyway, I think we can
get this book published.

1311
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:22,347
I really do,
but I can't write it.

1312
01:11:22,381 --> 01:11:24,901
A little birdie tells me
that you can.

1313
01:11:26,627 --> 01:11:29,630
So...do we have a deal?

1314
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:34,359
I'll make you one of these.

1315
01:11:34,393 --> 01:11:35,670
- Oh, yeah, now we've got
a deal.

1316
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:37,638
- [Laughs]

1317
01:11:40,123 --> 01:11:40,986
[Groans]

1318
01:11:43,126 --> 01:11:45,680
Oh.

1319
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:47,648
Both: [Sighing]

1320
01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:52,446
- Oh, and to think I broke all ten fingernails for nothing.

1321
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,586
- You know, I'm starting
to think you might not

1322
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,863
be so bad after all.

1323
01:11:55,897 --> 01:11:57,520
- Yeah, the jury is still
out on you

1324
01:11:57,554 --> 01:11:59,522
and this water project.

1325
01:11:59,556 --> 01:12:01,386
- Sam thinks it's
going to work.

1326
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,870
It'd better work.

1327
01:12:02,904 --> 01:12:04,527
We can't keep on hauling
this water forever.

1328
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:06,908
- Well, Sam's an optimist.

1329
01:12:06,943 --> 01:12:09,704
- He tries to see
the positive side of things.

1330
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:11,706
He hasn't had
an easy life, you know.

1331
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:13,708
His dad was killed
when he was young,

1332
01:12:13,743 --> 01:12:16,401
and he and his mom moved in
with Maggie Mae and Jess.

1333
01:12:16,435 --> 01:12:19,921
- Yeah, he's quite the guy.

1334
01:12:19,956 --> 01:12:22,165
- Know what I said
the other night about Sam?

1335
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,892
Jess said it, too.

1336
01:12:24,926 --> 01:12:27,895
She said, "well,
here we go all over again

1337
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:28,999
with the two of them."

1338
01:12:32,209 --> 01:12:35,143
- They seem to be settling in,not drifting away.

1339
01:12:35,178 --> 01:12:36,869
- Settling in is good.

1340
01:12:36,904 --> 01:12:40,563
- We all need it.

1341
01:12:40,597 --> 01:12:42,772
- I'm getting to like this.

1342
01:12:42,806 --> 01:12:44,567
I know where to find you
in the morning.

1343
01:12:44,601 --> 01:12:45,913
[Laughs]

1344
01:12:45,947 --> 01:12:48,398
- Don't get used to it.

1345
01:12:48,433 --> 01:12:52,437
- [Laughs]Oh, you're not a morning person?

1346
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:53,645
- This can't last forever.

1347
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,716
This isn't my world, remember?

1348
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,718
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1349
01:12:57,752 --> 01:12:59,029
What was that?
Where did that come from?

1350
01:12:59,064 --> 01:13:01,411
- [Sighs]
Reality. Reality is where...

1351
01:13:01,446 --> 01:13:03,206
- hey, hey, hey. You know,
hey, turn around. Look at me.

1352
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,416
- [Sighs]

1353
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:08,453
- You told me when you
were young your mom died

1354
01:13:08,487 --> 01:13:10,455
and you never got to know her.

1355
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:11,939
Now your dad is gone.

1356
01:13:11,973 --> 01:13:14,424
You're searching for something.

1357
01:13:14,459 --> 01:13:16,495
You think just maybe
you're going to find it here.

1358
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,773
Don't you see that?

1359
01:13:18,808 --> 01:13:20,741
You could have Jess
as a sister.

1360
01:13:20,775 --> 01:13:22,950
- But it would never work
for us.

1361
01:13:22,984 --> 01:13:25,193
- Know what? Just have
a little bit of faith.

1362
01:13:25,228 --> 01:13:27,851
That's what Maggie Mae
and Charlie didn't have.

1363
01:13:27,886 --> 01:13:30,544
We could have something
different.

1364
01:13:37,516 --> 01:13:38,793
Something like this.

1365
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,421
[Kissing sounds]

1366
01:13:55,948 --> 01:13:57,640
You're not going to
believe this,

1367
01:13:57,674 --> 01:14:00,781
but everything's going
to be just fine.

1368
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:08,823
And it's not going to be because you made it happen, Natalie.

1369
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:12,137
Don't try to control it.
Just let it happen.

1370
01:14:28,533 --> 01:14:30,604
[Engine starts]

1371
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,616
[Fluttering]

1372
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,065
[Tapping]

1373
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,964
- Yeah, I feel like
such a worthless lute.

1374
01:14:45,998 --> 01:14:48,725
You guys going off
to do all the work,

1375
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,968
and I'm staying home.

1376
01:14:50,002 --> 01:14:50,934
- Well, you have a book
to write.

1377
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:52,522
- Well, that's not work.

1378
01:14:52,557 --> 01:14:55,042
- [Laughs]
It is if you don't know how.

1379
01:14:55,076 --> 01:14:56,768
Right, Natalie?

1380
01:14:56,802 --> 01:14:57,838
- Got that right.

1381
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,808
- I was just checking
on the horses.

1382
01:15:02,843 --> 01:15:03,844
