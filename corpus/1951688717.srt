1
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,754
Have we decided
what we're gonna do yet?

2
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,356
Not yet. Who knows?
Maybe the fresh air will help.

3
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,756
- It's a vacation right?
- More or less.

4
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,873
Actually, it's more of
a moral-support weekend.

5
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,918
- So you think it's gonna be heavy?
- I don't know, Franklin.

6
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:14,992
Your dad dies in a hunting accident.
Think that might weigh on you a bit?

7
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,677
- It's only been a year since he passed.
- Sam doesn't seem too affected by it.

8
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:23,478
Yeah, not to you, she wouldn't.

9
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,673
Thanks for inviting me.

10
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:39,275
I'm glad you came.
I didn't think you would.

11
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,151
I think I need to be out of my element.

12
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,031
Besides, this is a big weekend
for all of us.

13
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,191
That's what I'm counting on.

14
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,671
Hey, guys. What's happening?

15
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,270
- Hey.
- How's everybody doing?

16
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,437
Hey, how you doing?

17
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:33,353
Great. I've never been
out of the city like this before.

18
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,113
Pretty cool, huh?

19
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,030
- What, you got no trees in the hood?
- What's wrong with you?

20
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,110
Dom.

21
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:49,432
- This is cute. What is it?
- Like a dream catcher, but different.

22
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,237
How?

23
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,550
My father taught me how to make them.
He made that one.

24
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:58,189
It's our way of staying connected
to those that have passed on,

25
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,748
like my mother and father.

26
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:20,711
Welcome to Canmore.

27
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:32,517
- Looks homey.
- Yeah, for a ghost town.

28
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:00,358
Cute, huh?

29
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,070
Load up. This is the closest thing
to civilisation we'll see for a while.

30
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,993
- How far are we from the lake?
- About an hour's drive.

31
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,547
- Babe, you're not gonna get anything?
- I'm just gonna stretch my legs.

32
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,278
Hey, there.
Can I get three packs of those?

33
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:38,672
Three packs of those, please.

34
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,875
- Gonna have a feast, are we?
- Just some restocking.

35
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,758
- Don't worry. We'll all help out.
- Thanks.

36
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,147
These parts ain't safe
this time of year.

37
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,715
- OK.
- Fabulous.

38
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,393
I didn't see you there.

39
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,472
I should get back to my friends.

40
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,270
Yeah.

41
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,951
- What's up, Kate? You all right?
- There's this guy over...there.

42
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,751
- What guy?
- You're losin' it, girl.

43
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:11,591
- Hey, guys, check it out.
- What, are we there?

44
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,875
Yeah. Look to your right.

45
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,714
Yeah, look.
Sam got a lake named after her.

46
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,236
My dad discovered it 30 years ago. He
loved it so much, he named me after it.

47
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,550
Here we are.

48
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,268
- Wow, this is beautiful.
- Yeah.

49
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,719
It's good to be home.

50
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,713
- It's the spirit of the forest.
- I'm sorry. Say that again.

51
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:47,795
The spirit of the forest.
It's like a greeting.

52
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,029
It's a good omen.

53
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:54,192
The spirit of the forest. I like that.

54
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:59,479
Yeah, but let's not talk about spirits
and shit like that, OK?

55
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,119
Come on. Let's go.

56
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,070
Come on.

57
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,750
Dominik, you're in there with me. You
guys can throw your stuff in that room.

58
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,910
Quaint.

59
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,272
Put your swimsuits on.
The water looks beautiful.

60
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,838
- You ready?
- Yeah.

61
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,633
<i>Sam, where are you?</i>

62
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,071
I'm over here.

63
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:43,112
- Am I intruding?
- No, not at all. Come have a seat.

64
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:54,677
- What are these rock circles?
- They're grave markings.

65
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,393
I believe they help connect the spirits
of those who have passed on

66
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,153
with our world.

67
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:12,316
- Are your parents buried here?
- No, it's just symbolic.

68
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,392
Keeps me close to them.
Like those dream catchers.

69
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,679
I'm seeing a whole new side of you
since we got here.

70
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,149
This is where I belong.

71
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,318
How you been feeling?

72
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,510
I'm good.

73
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,188
Having you guys here really helps.

74
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:44,750
Not too many people
understand me like you do.

75
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,876
I feel the same way.

76
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,348
Come on.

77
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,556
- This looks dangerous. What's this?
- It's just an old logging pole.

78
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:13,314
Comes in handy
if anybody steps out of line.

79
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,709
I'll bet.

80
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,031
You've got quite the place here, Sam.
It's so quiet.

81
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:24,396
Where are all the other cottage people?

82
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,268
Most of them are old and like the quiet,
so you'll never see them.

83
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,907
Others come up
for only a few weeks a year.

84
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,948
If it wasn't a six-hour drive,
I'd consider getting a place here.

85
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:40,237
I'm serious. The lake is so calming.

86
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,029
Actually, you know what? I'd probably
get a place closer to the city.

87
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,270
What is that?

88
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,229
- It's about time.
- How exciting.

89
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,189
- We get to meet other cottage folk.
- Behave, Dominik.

90
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:13,149
Hey.

91
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:18,188
This is Jesse. That's Dominik,
and that's Kate and Melanie.

92
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,111
- Hi.
- And that's...

93
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,396
- Hey, what's up man? Franklin.
- Cool.

94
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,471
- Fire on Wolf Island tonight?
- You gonna set it up?

95
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,917
- It'll be ready when Orion peaks.
- OK. I'll bring the kids.

96
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,991
- Later.
- Bye.

97
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,349
- OK. Who was that?
- Yeah!

98
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,593
Jesse? We grew up together around here,
spent summers at the lake.

99
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,547
I see. This is why she stays single.
It all makes sense now.

100
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:57,110
No, it's not like that.
His cottage is just around the point.

101
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,192
Anyway, what's this he said about
the wolf catching fire on the island?

102
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:03,554
Sweetie.

103
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:09,430
No, he's setting up a bonfire
on Wolf Island tonight. It's tradition.

104
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,157
Tradition.

105
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,389
- You like what I did?
- Very cute.

106
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,153
What do you think?

107
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:38,269
- I've never seen so many stars.
- I know. I had no idea.

108
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,352
OK. What was that?

109
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,113
- I don't know.
- Oh, God.

110
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,708
Wait.

111
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,708
Come on.

112
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:10,593
All right, story time.
Anybody got any spooky stories?

113
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:13,592
No? All right, I got one.
It's a true story, too.

114
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,637
It happened
to a friend of mine's cousin.

115
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,189
She was baby-sitting
these two little kids, three and five.

116
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:25,752
She's sitting in the dark by herself
watching TV and the phone rings.

117
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,628
She goes over and she picks it up
and she says, "Hello?"

118
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,838
The guy on the other end's
breathin' real heavy and he says to her,

119
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:37,036
"Have you checked on the children?"

120
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,828
- She freaks out, gets up...
- Franklin, come on.

121
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:44,389
- What?
- Everybody's heard this one.

122
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,310
Have you checked on the children?
That's older than your boxers. Hello!

123
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:59,836
- No, it's a true story, for real.
- You can be so cute sometimes.

124
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:04,311
- I'm telling you, it's true.
- I liked it. It was good.

125
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:09,394
Does anyone else have a story,
one that actually works?

126
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,437
- Tell 'em about the house, Sam.
- No.

127
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,148
Come on.
They seem brave enough.

128
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,832
No way.

129
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,432
What house?

130
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,875
Nothing. It's just Jesse
trying to cause trouble.

131
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,678
Sam, if you have something, share it.

132
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,148
It's not an urban legend
or a ghost story.

133
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,356
- Even better. Come on.
- Yeah, come on. Spill it.

134
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,434
Fine, but if you wanna hear the story,
then it comes with an adventure.

135
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:45,627
- Then I really wanna hear it.
- Are you sure you guys are up for this?

136
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:48,791
Enough already. Get on with it.

137
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,595
10 minutes away from here,
there's an old broken-down house.

138
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,798
We passed it on the way up here.
It's in the middle of nowhere.

139
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:02,872
- Tucked away off the side of the road?
- That's the one.

140
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:07,428
Well, a long time ago
this man lived there.

141
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,229
His family owned hundreds of acres
of land around here, really wealthy.

142
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:16,915
This man met this simple country girl
from a small town and they fell in love.

143
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:20,674
His family wasn't too happy,
but, being the independent type,

144
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,955
he went off and built this little house

145
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,589
on a chunk of their land
in the middle of nowhere.

146
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,513
He married this girl
and everything was wonderful.

147
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,910
They had a daughter
and eventually a son.

148
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:42,794
This is where the story
starts to go off.

149
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:46,110
Their son was sick.

150
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,349
Not physically but mentally.

151
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:53,195
He wasn't retarded or anything.
He was just a little off.

152
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,272
By the time he was nine, he became
too much for his parents to handle,

153
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:00,590
throwing temper tantrums,
erratic sleeping patterns,

154
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,115
disappearing into the woods
and hiding, that kind of thing.

155
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,397
Not knowing what to do about his son,
the man turned to his family for help.

156
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,349
His parents had the boy taken away,
sent to a place deep in the woods.

157
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,156
It wasn't an insane asylum, but
it catered to people with special needs,

158
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,787
if you know what I mean.

159
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:32,314
His parents thought it was for the best.

160
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:36,438
And over time the family functioned
as if there'd never been a son

161
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,672
and everything went back
to being wonderful again.

162
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,275
Eight years later, the boy,
who was about 16 or 17,

163
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:47,397
manages to escape from the hospital.

164
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,517
They do a search,
but he's nowhere to be found.

165
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,077
His family's notified
and they are devastated.

166
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:59,915
He's been alone in the wilderness
for weeks and he's probably dead.

167
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:07,707
And then, in the dead of night,
the boy finds his way back home.

168
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:16,509
<i>And he creeps into his house</i>
<i>and slaughters his entire family.</i>

169
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,436
Father, mother and sister.

170
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:35,193
Blood still dripping from the stick,
he disappears into the woods.

171
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,318
The surrounding townsfolk were horrified
and they tried to find the boy,

172
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:42,152
but to this day he has not been found.

173
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:48,713
Now, around harvest time
every year since then,

174
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,757
people have started to go missing.

175
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,958
And in their place
a corn-husk doll would be left behind.

176
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,032
Legend has it, he still roams the woods
around these parts.

177
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:05,714
And you brought us here?

178
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:09,872
It seems like there's a doll hanging
from every house in that small town.

179
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:14,829
The surrounding towns have bought into
the legend and hang them for protection.

180
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:17,718
No one's gone missing in years,
have they?

181
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:22,395
I don't know. I don't think so.
I haven't heard of anything.

182
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,474
When I was young, we tried to find him,
but I don't think he's around any more.

183
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,676
- I'm not telling you this to scare you.
- Whatever.

184
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:35,469
No, really. I've been up here my whole
life and I've never seen the guy.

185
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:36,867
Me neither.

186
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:43,512
Apparently, that house is still haunted
by the ghosts of his murdered family,

187
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,988
and if you go up there late at night,

188
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,947
you can hear the whole thing
take place all over again.

189
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:13,312
Seriously, those two,
I don't know about them, man.

190
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:18,997
Well, I might as well,
considering I've soiled my underpants.

191
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,629
- That's sick.
- What? Like you didn't?

192
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:32,074
Sorry if I spooked you
at the gas station.

193
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,831
It's OK.

194
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:38,151
It's just that we don't get many girls
as pretty as you passing through.

195
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,311
- If I'd have known you were with Sam...
- It's fine.

196
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:47,468
Man, this is living.

197
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:52,076
It sure is.
Tell you what, it beats the city.

198
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,628
Please.
For a little while, not for ever.

199
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,393
Yeah, that's true.

200
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,475
Come on, let's pack it in.

201
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:11,233
I'm tired.

202
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,911
City girl can't handle the country air.

203
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:48,957
Dark sleep.

204
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,359
You all right?

205
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,113
Yeah, I'm fine.

206
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:25,871
- Water?
- Thanks.

207
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,790
You OK?

208
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,553
Yeah. I'm fine.

209
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,311
It's not the dream again, is it?

210
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,834
No.

211
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,389
No, it's just...

212
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:50,312
It's this place.

213
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,037
So many memories.

214
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,079
How do you do it?

215
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:02,434
Do what?

216
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,591
All alone, no family.

217
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:10,553
It's difficult sometimes.

218
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:21,553
I miss my father so much.

219
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,913
He was my life.

220
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:31,714
It just takes time, Sam.

221
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:35,588
You know what? You know what?

222
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,476
We're your family now.

223
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:43,312
Whatever happens,
we'll all go through it together.

224
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:47,673
It'll all work out.

225
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:54,231
Come on. Let's go back to bed.

226
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:58,951
- Thanks, Dom.
- Come on.

227
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:54,433
Now, calm down now, Thelma.

228
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,193
Someone there?

229
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:14,548
This ain't funny no more.

230
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,716
- Don't do that.
- You're getting rusty, city girl.

231
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:38,269
- In your dreams.
- I thought you'd still be sleeping.

232
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,237
Please.

233
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,072
God, it's good to be home.

234
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:48,755
- Yeah, well, we missed you round here.
- Thanks.

235
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:51,911
I forget how much I miss it
until I come back.

236
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,673
No shit.

237
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,195
So, tell me about your friends.

238
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,671
- They're kind of like a little family.
- What do you mean?

239
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,956
Dominik's parents disowned him
when they found out he was gay.

240
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,394
He took Melanie under his wing
years ago.

241
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:29,791
Her parents died. She bounced around for
years before ending up on the streets.

242
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:33,634
That's where she met Franklin.
They went through a drug thing together.

243
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,790
That's interesting.

244
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,109
Kate's parents split up a long time ago

245
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,749
and are too preoccupied with themselves
to bother with her.

246
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,197
She's also just come through a long,
nasty relationship, so she's still raw.

247
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,553
Nasty?

248
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:50,677
She took a baseball bat
to him one night.

249
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:55,594
- She hospitalised him for a week.
- That's impressive.

250
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,708
So they all sort of clicked together
and formed this family unit.

251
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:05,350
- Wounded geese tend to gather.
- That they do.

252
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,828
It works out well. You fit right in.

253
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:12,711
- Watch it.
- Let's go wake these guys up.

254
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:15,473
I'm starved.

255
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:38,835
Hey.

256
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,519
- Did you see that one?
- Not bad.

257
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:49,228
So, Sam, last night you said that with
that story came an adventure, right?

258
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:52,630
- Well?
- In time.

259
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,872
- Just tell us what it is.
- Patience.

260
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,395
Yeah, baby, have a little patience.

261
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:05,198
- Who's helping me with dinner?
- I will.

262
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,953
Thank you.

263
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,987
That was great.

264
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,150
Yeah.

265
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,471
- Where are you off to?
- To the dock to check out some stars.

266
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,233
I'll come with you.

267
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:42,158
Watch your step.

268
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,030
Wow.

269
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:15,110
Do you know any constellations?

270
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:20,592
It's Orion the hunter.
It's one of my favourites.

271
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:22,909
Cool.

272
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,991
- You've heard of the Big Dipper, right?
- Yeah.

273
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,187
It's always just over
the top of the mountain.

274
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,953
Oh, yeah.

275
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:44,588
You really love it here.

276
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:49,150
Yeah, I guess I do.
I mean, what's not to love?

277
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:00,707
Don't you feel isolated, like you're
missing out on the rest of the world?

278
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:04,872
After you spend enough time up here,
it kind of seeps into you

279
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,031
and you stop needing
or wondering about other places.

280
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,316
What do you mean?

281
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:15,313
Take a look up at the sky, at the water,

282
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:18,312
feel the trees swaying in the breeze,

283
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:21,516
and there's a calmness to it, a peace.

284
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,549
And over time
it kind of finds its way to your core

285
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:33,553
and you kind of become one with it.

286
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,069
It's powerful. It's pure.

287
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,673
I'd give you a week up here and I'll bet
you never wanna leave again.

288
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,590
That was hell. Have these people
never heard of a dishwasher?

289
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,952
- Where's Kate and Jesse?
- Down on the dock.

290
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,633
That's kinky.

291
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:10,632
- Come on, let's go.
- Where?

292
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:13,836
- I told you there was an adventure.
- Oh, God.

293
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:17,548
- Hey, you wanted to hear it.
- Come on, let's go. It'll be fun.

294
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:20,916
- Come on.
- Up.

295
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,912
Hey, Jesse, let's go!

296
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,549
- Where are we going?
- To have a little fun.

297
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,710
You'll see.

298
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:04,516
- That better not be what I think it is.
- You're kidding me.

299
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:08,877
- Man, this is cool.
- Why settle for just a story?

300
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,149
- Everybody out.
- Let's go.

301
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:23,834
What? Are you whacked? There's no way
I'm getting out of this truck.

302
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:27,674
Fine. Dominik, come on, let's go.

303
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,310
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit.

304
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:36,188
- This is insane.
- Yeah.

305
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:43,028
That's pretty.

306
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,588
Just lovely.

307
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,315
Man, it's freaky in here.

308
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:23,068
Come on.

309
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,873
No, this is as far as I go.

310
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:49,794
- Jesus!
- Kate?

311
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:53,310
I'm fine.

312
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:59,711
I think there's another door back there.

313
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,390
What is it?

314
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,830
Hey, guys?

315
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,717
- Jesse spook you?
- Yeah.

316
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,510
Dork.

317
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:37,194
This is stupid.

318
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:57,154
- Find anything?
- No.

319
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:02,757
I know there's a back door and another
room somewhere, but it's just too dark.

320
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:15,032
Can you see anything?

321
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,633
I think something fell from the chimney.

322
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:21,508
- Yeah, wait. I think I see something.
- What is it?

323
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,989
- I don't know. I can't make it out.
- Well, grab it.

324
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:29,789
- I'm not reaching in there.
- Come on. What are you, a wuss?

325
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:33,668
Fine.

326
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:46,150
- What?
- Was that necessary?

327
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,830
I got it.

328
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,670
Check it out.

329
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,111
That's cool.

330
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:19,389
Jesse, enough all ready.

331
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,996
What the fuck was that?

332
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,678
- Get the fuck out of here now!
- We're going!

333
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:37,795
- Hurry up!
- Open the door! Open the door!

334
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,517
- Hurry up.
- Shit.

335
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,388
- Come on, Sam.
- Sam, please, hurry up!

336
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,428
- Drive!
- Come on!

337
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,954
That wasn't funny, you guys.

338
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,553
Oh, my God. What the hell just happened?

339
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:10,395
- Holy shit.
- What a rush.

340
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,394
I'm glad you thought that was so funny.
I almost died back there. Dead, OK?

341
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,392
Hey, guys, look. Check it out.

342
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,392
- What is it?
- Get rid of it.

343
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:47,399
- I don't want it.
- Sure, right. You and that damn doll.

344
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,756
- I didn't put it there.
- Yeah, whatever.

345
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,591
Honestly, I think I'm still in shock.

346
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:14,787
That is the last adventure I ever go on.

347
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:21,152
- You didn't even get out of the truck.
- Exactly.

348
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:24,629
- What happened in there, anyway?
- Nothing, really.

349
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:27,552
- I'll tell you when we get to the city.
- Good idea.

350
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:31,234
- I need a drink. Anyone want something?
- Definitely.

351
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:34,197
So, has this ever happened
to you guys before?

352
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:38,318
No. I mean, I've heard noises from
the house before and felt a presence,

353
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:40,470
but never the screaming.

354
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,995
Yeah, that was pretty intense.

355
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,150
Understatement.

356
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,110
Even the book is creepy.

357
00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:00,954
Be careful with that, man.
That's a souvenir.

358
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,838
Not if I can help it.

359
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:07,878
Baby, I had no idea
you were such a chicken.

360
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,991
Dominik?

361
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:25,833
- What's wrong?
- Yeah, what's it say?

362
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,829
It's like a journal or something.

363
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:34,230
A journal?

364
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,349
- It's his journal.
- Whose journal?

365
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,236
The guy...

366
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:47,435
The guy that killed his family.

367
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,954
You're kidding me, right?

368
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:54,873
Are you serious?

369
00:45:56,999 --> 00:46:00,708
There's like a dedication
on the inside cover.

370
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,759
What does it say?

371
00:46:05,919 --> 00:46:11,516
"To my family who I love and cherish
and who will always be with me."

372
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:22,193
"September 5th, 1959.
It has been hard alone.

373
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:27,397
All they had to do was talk.
They could not talk.

374
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:32,758
I hear her voice late at night
sometimes, screams.

375
00:46:32,919 --> 00:46:35,353
It is cold and dark.

376
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,592
I needed things. She did not love me.

377
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:45,356
The medicines are gone.
I am free, free from all of them.

378
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:52,118
If they could not love me, they had
to go. Dark sleep for everyone.

379
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,713
I'm safe here.
The animals are good. They talk.

380
00:46:58,879 --> 00:47:01,598
I hear her voice still, screaming."

381
00:47:01,759 --> 00:47:04,432
Jesus Christ.

382
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:10,792
"December 4th, 1959.
They have stopped looking for me.

383
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:16,108
It is OK for me now. I visit my house.

384
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:21,273
I keep warm in the forest.
It provides like the others could not.

385
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:24,237
At least they talk to me now
when I visit."

386
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:29,357
Wow, the next entry is like years later.

387
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,068
"October 3rd, 1965.

388
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:36,868
I left the forest years ago
and moved to a small town nearby.

389
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:39,030
Nobody recognises me.

390
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,954
I still go to the forest sometimes.
I even spend a couple of nights there.

391
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:48,431
I hear people telling my story
sometimes. It makes me laugh inside.

392
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,272
Mom and Dad are very proud of me."

393
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,516
That's creepy.

394
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:03,111
"November 2nd, 1973.
Life has been good.

395
00:48:03,279 --> 00:48:05,474
I have learned how to be a mechanic,

396
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:08,915
bought a cottage on a nearby lake
and met a girl.

397
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:12,594
She's very quiet and pretty. Jessica.

398
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:15,956
I brought her to the house
and she likes it.

399
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:20,317
Dad said it's just like
how he met Mom, small town and all."

400
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:31,032
OK. "July 1st, 1976.
Today is a great day."

401
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:34,109
What was that?

402
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:40,197
- I don't know.
- OK, guys, can we just stop now?

403
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:43,749
I'm getting really freaked out.

404
00:48:46,999 --> 00:48:50,833
Yeah, maybe we should.
Dominik, put the book away.

405
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:55,789
Come on. It's probably just the wind
blowing a dead branch off a tree.

406
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:58,314
We're safe in here, though, aren't we?

407
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:01,516
Can't we just talk about happier things?

408
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,398
I'll go check it out. You keep reading.

409
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:08,352
Yeah, keep going. This is kind of fun.

410
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:11,033
Fine, just hurry up.

411
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:14,827
OK, where was I?

412
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:19,834
OK, right. "July 1st, 1976.

413
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:24,072
Today is a great day. I have babies.

414
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,073
She gave birth to twins today.
I'm so happy.

415
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,231
Mom and Dad are grandparents now.

416
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:37,352
Jessica isn't doing so well, though.

417
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,716
It was hard for her,
'cause I wanted it to be natural,

418
00:49:40,879 --> 00:49:43,473
like the way the animals do it.

419
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,630
She might not make it.

420
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:51,908
I can teach them things about animals
and show them the woods. I'm happy."

421
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,468
Yeah, happy
for a sick and twisted murderer.

422
00:49:54,639 --> 00:50:00,111
He made her give birth
to twins naturally. Sounds like hell.

423
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:04,231
OK, this is the last entry.

424
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,635
"August, 1995. I'm so proud of my kids.

425
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,597
They are just like me.
That's what Mom says.

426
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,148
Well, except they are much smarter.

427
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:18,231
They go to school in town
and have lots of friends.

428
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:20,469
They spend time in the woods with me.

429
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,518
We listen for the animals
and everything. I love them so much.

430
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:29,036
I taught them this game where
their friends run loose in the forest.

431
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:32,748
We have to chase them down
and put them into dark sleep,

432
00:50:32,919 --> 00:50:38,277
so they always stay with us,
like Dad, Mom, sis and Jessica.

433
00:50:38,439 --> 00:50:41,829
It's fun. They're really good at it.
I'm very proud of them.

434
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:45,594
I named my daughter after the lake
and my son after my dead wife.

435
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:47,556
She is happy with that.

436
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:53,908
Jesse took over at the garage and Sam
moved off into the city. She is..."

437
00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:00,550
What the fuck?

438
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:06,877
- Sam?
- This isn't funny.

439
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:09,030
What do we do?

440
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,792
- OK, stop playing, Sam!
- What the fuck do we do?

441
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:20,631
- No, no, no, no! This is a joke, right?
- Franklin, do something.

442
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:23,188
- We have to get out of here!
- Don't! Don't!

443
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:27,873
- Sam!
- We're fucked!

444
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:29,836
Yes, you are.

445
00:51:31,959 --> 00:51:34,632
No. You're not doing this.

446
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,313
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Run, run, run!

447
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:53,835
Go, go!

448
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:04,988
Please, please, please, Sam.
It's me. Don't.

449
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:07,832
Sam, no, please!
Please, Sam, no! It's me.

450
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:11,753
It's me, Sam. No! No!

451
00:52:11,919 --> 00:52:17,039
I'll watch over you now. Dark sleep.

452
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:41,233
Don't stop, Kate. Run!

453
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,438
What?

454
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,069
We aren't alone.

455
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:10,754
- What do you mean?
- I mean, he's out there.

456
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,154
Have you lost it? I saw him die.

457
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,117
Now could you focus?

458
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:24,717
No one is out there but these
little rats running through our forest.

459
00:53:24,879 --> 00:53:27,871
Now just enjoy this.

460
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:33,067
Let's do this.

461
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,517
All right. That's what I like to hear.

462
00:53:50,399 --> 00:53:52,788
Come on, baby.

463
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:02,751
Come on, baby, get up. Come on.

464
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:12,595
We're gonna make it out of here.
We just gotta keep running.

465
00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:16,069
See? We already lost 'em.
We gotta find the road.

466
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:19,117
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Dominik's dead.

467
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:24,433
I know Dominik's dead, baby, OK? But
you can't think about that right now.

468
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,353
Franklin!

469
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:55,632
It's over there.
It came from over there.

470
00:54:55,799 --> 00:54:59,587
- No, it's this way. Come on.
- Franklin, where are you?

471
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:09,833
Come on, baby.

472
00:55:11,439 --> 00:55:14,158
- Check it out.
- We can't just knock on their door.

473
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,514
- Why not?
- We don't know who's in there.

474
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:21,309
It's gotta be better than what's
out there. Maybe a phone or car keys.

475
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:26,273
There's no keys. Come on.

476
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:42,110
Hello?

477
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,833
It seems empty.

478
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:59,438
We need some help.
There's nobody here.

479
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,268
Come on, do something.
Look for something useful.

480
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:59,634
- Phone's dead.
- Surprise, surprise.

481
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:17,398
Oh, shit.

482
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,714
- What are you doing? Look what I found.
- We gotta get outta here.

483
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:36,551
Why?

484
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,153
- Oh, shit.
- Let's go.

485
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:40,957
OK.

486
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:51,911
We're going for the van, OK?

487
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,068
Now!

488
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:03,474
Franklin!

489
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:10,670
Fuck!

490
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:16,030
You're kidding me.

491
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:20,670
- Which way?
- I don't know.

492
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,273
Fuck! I think it's this way. Come on.

493
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:25,555
- Are you sure?
- I think so. Come on.

494
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:53,518
What are you doing?
We gotta keep moving, OK?

495
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:57,718
I need you to walk it off.
Walk it off. Walk it off.

496
00:58:57,879 --> 00:59:01,030
Fuck, how did we get involved
in this shit?

497
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,238
Can we jog a little bit? OK, come on.

498
00:59:05,399 --> 00:59:08,994
Kate? Shit. Go, go.

499
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:11,434
I can handle her.
I'll catch up with you.

500
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,193
- No.
- Run!

501
00:59:16,439 --> 00:59:19,078
All right, bitch.

502
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,351
What were you gonna do with this,
city boy?

503
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,715
Franklin!

504
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:04,313
- Dad's out there.
- Jesse, for Christ's sake.

505
01:01:04,479 --> 01:01:07,277
I picked up his scent.

506
01:01:07,439 --> 01:01:11,193
- We put him down there together.
- Have you checked the grave?

507
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:15,034
- No one could survive a blow like that.
- He's pissed. I can feel it.

508
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:18,555
So what? Even if he's still alive,
how strong could he be?

509
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,394
He's old and wounded.
It's nature's way, Jesse.

510
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,677
<i>He was becoming a burden.</i>
<i>You could see it as clear as I could.</i>

511
01:01:26,839 --> 01:01:28,511
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- He even knew.</i>

512
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:32,387
- But what if...?
- Don't tell me you're afraid.

513
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,436
He's gonna kill us.

514
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:50,990
If he were alive, what else would he
be doing? It's the natural order.

515
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:53,912
I don't like this.

516
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:59,394
Who's taking care of you now?

517
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,513
- You.
- Right.

518
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,955
I brought these people up
for the hunt, didn't I?

519
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:10,553
So don't be such a chicken shit.

520
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:13,438
Fine.

521
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:18,036
I'll get her. She's mine and I want her.

522
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:08,838
Kate!

523
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:16,716
Kate, I'm not gonna hurt you.

524
01:06:12,879 --> 01:06:15,268
Fuck! That hurt.

525
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:21,278
That shit ain't gonna work on me.

526
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:26,756
I told you. I told you. I told you, OK?

527
01:06:26,919 --> 01:06:29,797
I'm not gonna hurt you, OK?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

528
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:34,316
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just hear me out, all right, Kate?

529
01:06:34,479 --> 01:06:39,428
I'm gonna let you go now, OK?
But just hear me out. OK?

530
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,590
OK.

531
01:07:16,919 --> 01:07:19,149
When the cat's away...

532
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,233
I thought that we had something,
you know?

533
01:07:28,359 --> 01:07:31,635
I felt it and I know you did, too.

534
01:07:33,439 --> 01:07:35,828
Look, I'm really not a bad guy.

535
01:07:35,999 --> 01:07:39,878
And once you see how things work
around here, I know that you'll fit in.

536
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:45,909
Kate, I can provide for you,
and you already know Sam very well.

537
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:51,357
I know this is all happening so fast,
with the story, the lies and everything.

538
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:55,990
But I promise you, Kate,
it won't happen again, OK?

539
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:02,273
Yeah, I promise you.

540
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:07,957
What do you say?

541
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:11,475
- You're so twisted.
- I said I'd handle this, Sam.

542
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,468
You're doing a great job.

543
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,831
Shit.

544
01:08:41,879 --> 01:08:44,268
What's this?

545
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:47,112
You were right. He's alive.

546
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:50,907
Now finish her off. We're being hunted.

547
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:05,670
Kate, honey, she's right.

548
01:09:07,559 --> 01:09:10,027
There's only one way
for us to be together.

549
01:09:20,879 --> 01:09:24,713
Dark sleep for ever.
We all stay together.

550
01:09:24,879 --> 01:09:26,915
Sam!

551
01:09:34,919 --> 01:09:35,954
Jesse?

552
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,271
No, no.

553
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:59,431
Let's take him down in the forest.

554
01:10:04,639 --> 01:10:07,995
I'll be back for you.

555
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:53,868
We'll split up.

556
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:57,588
I'll lead him back.
You keep an eye on me.

557
01:13:08,879 --> 01:13:11,871
You know how this has to be.

558
01:13:13,839 --> 01:13:15,636
You can't do this any more.

559
01:13:33,919 --> 01:13:35,796
Jesse?

560
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,471
Jesse.

561
01:15:13,839 --> 01:15:15,830
Good one.

562
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:21,230
You taught me well.

563
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:26,348
But this is my family now.
Your time has passed.

564
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,156
This is what you wanted.

565
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,468
You didn't think I forgot about you?

566
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:21,631
Are you looking for something?
