-It's so cool, you look amazing.
-ROBIN: Oh.

00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,927
-Talking to the ladies out there.
-Beautiful.

00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,387
-Oh. Oh. Oh.
-KYLA: I know, we were talking

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,472
so much outside, I was like,
"Wait, we might need

00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,017
-"to save something." (LAUGHS)
-Yeah... Oh, my God. I know, I know.

when women connect,

(THEME SONG CONCLUDES)

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,715
On the surface of the show,
people, if they were looking in,

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,427
they would go like,
"What do these four women have in common?"

20
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,848
And what I love about it is
that we all have more in common than not.

21
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,058
-Right.
-KYLA: Yes.

22
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,143
ROBIN: And it's just about
taking that time

23
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,937
to just go below the surface a little bit.

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,523
Just sitting outside
when we were getting to know each other,

25
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,152
Chloe and I found out that we're both
first-generation Americans.

-Oh.

00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,155
My parents from Greece and Bulgaria,

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,740
-hers from Korea.
-ROBIN: Yeah?

29
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,992
And that experience of growing up

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,495
-as a child of immigrants...
-Right.

31
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,289
...because as a kid,
I think what I learned from it,

32
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:25,210
I gained enormous empathy
for people that came from other places

33
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,421
because my parents
spoke with accents and they didn't...

34
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,966
They weren't educated
but they were very intelligent people...

35
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,176
-Right.
-...and I could tell

36
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,303
if sometimes someone
treated them differently

37
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,305
because they had an accent
or they didn't

39
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,559
-You mentioned Greece.
-Yes.

00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,019
Weren't you just in Greece?

00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,063
-I went to Santorini and Mykonos.

-Well, they're the highlights.

00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,899
-I know.
-It's so beautiful.

-I had the best time.
-So jealous.

-RITA: Oh!
-It was great,

46
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,446
and I'm... I feel like
I'm such a workaholic that, like,

47
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,949
my friends were begging me
to go on this vacation.

48
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,826
-Hmm.
-So, like, "You haven't been on one

49
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,119
"in six years, you need to go."

50
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,870
You hadn't been on a vacation
in six years?

51
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,580
-Six years. Yeah.
-KYLA: Wow.

52
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,209
I don't know why,
it just... (CHUCKLES) Years just fly by.

53
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,378
-I feel like I have that same issue...
-CHLOE: Yeah.

54
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,257
...because I started working so early,
I feel like I've been

55
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,551
-unknowingly programmed to work.
-RITA: Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,219
-Ooh.
-KYLA: And as soon as

57
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,471
work comes up, it's like,
"Drop everything else."

58
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,890
-Especially in the business that I'm in.
-ROBIN: Right.

59
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,851
It's like, you never know
when a job is coming.

60
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,644
So, I would plan things

61
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,063
and work would come, and I'd be like,
"Oh, never mind."

62
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,274
And as I've gotten older,

63
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,193
I've come to realize,
like, I have to learn that balance,

64
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,113
um, especially having kids,
and understanding,

65
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,824
like, I don't want my kids to...
(CHUCKLES) ...grow up and being like,

66
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,242
"You were working all the time."

67
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,660
-Right.
-KYLA: I want them to see

68
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,912
the balance of "Mommy worked really hard,"

69
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,789
but then also
"Mommy played really hard too."

70
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,457
-ROBIN: That's it.
-KYLA: "Mommy enjoyed herself

71
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,709
and took the time to relax."

72
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,044
And I was able to do that this summer.

73
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,881
Um, last year, I wasn't able to do it
before I had to go back to work,

74
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,801
and I was really upset with myself
that I wasn't able to plan something

75
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,012
because I was still coming out of it.

76
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,723
And then this year,
I was like, "No, I'm scheduling this."

77
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,058
And even things came up,
and I was like, "Nope, sorry,

78
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,019
"trip with my kids."
I'm, like, "I'm not available."

79
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,520
-CHLOE: Yeah.
-And it was like... (SHRIEKS)

-(LAUGHS)
-Wow.

81
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,231
But I did it and I'm so happy

82
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,858
-that I did.
-But don't you think we're actors?

83
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,111
I've always said to my actor friends
if they're not working...

84
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,698
I say, "If you want a job,
plan a non-refundable vacation."

85
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,991
KYLA: Yeah. Absolutely.

86
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,618

you're gonna get a job.

00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,119
-KYLA: Absolutely.
-Oh, uh...

88
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,412
It's a release, like I really...

89
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,955
-(LAUGHS)
-...don't wanna do this right now.

that you did something only for you?

91
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,090
In the summertime, when it's warm, I swim.

00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,720

so you're floating through water.

93
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,016
-KYLA: Mm.
-I allow my mind to just wander.

94
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,810
-Hmm.
-RITA: I listen to music in my head,

95
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,147
I have conversations. I talk to God.

00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,398
-I...
-Mm.

97
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,027
And I swim for a long time,
I can go for like 40 minutes,

98
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,195
-and...
-What?

99
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,782
...when I do something for me,
it usually means that I'm taking time off

100
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,159
to just be alone and be still.

101
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,827
-KYLA: Mm.
-And that is so key.

102
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,789
And I'm seeing more and more
in the entertainment world

103
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,708
and in the sports world,
taking care of self.

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...

110
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,682
You've said to yourself too,

111
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,684
that you want to take
a bit of a break, right, Chloe?

112
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,435
Yeah. I think, for me,

113
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,231
the most important lesson I've learned
is just to be kind to myself.

114
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,777
Just respect myself more
than I ever could.

115
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,612
And what does that look like for you?

116
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,824
I think it was just...
I... I mean, I've been competing

117
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,911
at pro-level snowboarding competitions
since the age of 13.

118
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,373
And I started winning them
when I was 14...

119
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,001
-Wow.
-...and that kind of didn't stop until,

120
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,627
-you know?
-ROBIN: It hasn't stopped.

121
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,962
-It hasn't stopped.
-KYLA: No.

122
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,507
And I think that
I was in this very toxic place

123
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,593
where I thought that's what I had to do...

124
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,554
-ROBIN: Mm.
-...and also felt like I allowed people

125
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,390
to tell me what to do and who I had to be.

126
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,474
-Mm.
-ROBIN: Mm.

127
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,852
And not...
It was never malicious at all

128
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,730
but it was just,
I... I didn't really, like,

129
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,441
stand up for myself
or speak for myself or anything

130
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:20,445
because I had this mindset of
respecting your elders,

131
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,155
-or like, respecting...
-ROBIN: Right.

132
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,073
-And I think...
-Did you also have a fear

133
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,366
you didn't wanna disappoint?

134
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,452
I just thought
if I did everything I was told

135
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,037
and listen to everybody around me,

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,497
then I would be doing the right thing
and I would be happy.

137
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,460
But that wasn't true
because I was disregarding the way I felt

138
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,047
and the way that those actions
affected me and my mental health.

139
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,508
And that was a really hard journey
to be on.

140
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,761
RITA: What were the steps
that you had to take

141
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,014
once you recognized
that you had to be kind to yourself?

142
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,766
-CHLOE: Right.
-What... was it immediate?

143
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,393
-Or was it a gradual thing?
-It... it took time.

144
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,895
-Yeah.
-You know? It was a little,

145
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,564
little steps at a time.
Little moments where I could...

146
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,732
I felt empowered.

147
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,068
I can relate
in so many ways to... (CHUCKLES)

148
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,944
...both of the things you guys just said.

149
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,905
-Yeah.
-And having the same feelings of

150
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,699
"No, respect to your elders,
and just do what you're told."

151
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,327
And... and I also feel like
as the oldest child,

152
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,829
I'm realizing, like,
a little... a little pleaser,

153
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,581
-like I wanna please everybody.
-Yeah. Same here.

154
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,166
KYLA: I wanna to make sure
everybody's happy.

155
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,919
And I think that it's... it's gradual,

156
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,172
and it's still something
that I'm practicing, I think, every day...

157
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,174
-You go inner, you go inside.
-KYLA: ...is...

158
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,676
-You really...
-Yeah. I try to make sure

159
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,054
I'm understanding
how I'm going to communicate it

160
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,556
-before I do. Because I... I know...
-Oh.

161
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,767
...it's not always what you say,
it's how it's delivered.

162
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,560
-Make sure...
-Have you heard this expression?

163
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,438

-I love that. I've never heard that.

166

But it's true.
You can say anything you wanna say.

167
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,030
-And I try to do everything with a smile.
-Yeah.

168
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,533

that come out of my mouth is like, "Oh."

But... but it's a part of me
standing up for myself.

171
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,540
I honestly feel like,

172
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,793
in order to be the best mother
I want to be,

173
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,711
I have to be happy,

174
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,089
and what makes Kyla happy.

175
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,757
And it's so difficult.

176
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,385
I have a note in my phone,
it was like, with...

177
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,346
When I was going through some things,
and I was like, "What makes Kyla happy?"

178
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,850
And the answer cannot be,
"Whatever makes blank happy."

179
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:19,313
I think that the best thing
that I've seen myself after I learned to,

180
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,149
you know, create boundaries,
protect myself

181
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:25,069
and put myself first is that
it makes me look forward to the future.

182
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,904
-Yeah.
-I'm excited about things

183
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,240
because I know
those are truly what I want,

184
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,909
and no one's telling me
that that's what I want. Right?

185
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,162
-Ooh.
-So, I can really look forward to things.

186
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,497
-I'm excited again, I'm excited to...
-Right.

187
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,626
...to gain more experiences and wisdom,
and all of these incredible things

188
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,170
that I think I was always afraid of...

189
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,921
-RITA: Hm.
-...because I never knew what to expect,

190
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,591

No. I wanted to be a professional athlete.

-But... What was that thing? Ability.

-Uh-huh.
-ROBIN: Ability you must have,

197

-that Chloe has.
-"What's that thing?"

198

-RITA: Oh, I love it.
-I was a state bowling champion

But tennis, basketball and that...
But I...

211
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,344
was... I remember I was in, uh,
junior high, and we would have career day.

212
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,180
And I wanted a career in sports.

213
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,727
And at that time, I thought the only way
I could be a woman and be athletic,

214
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,021
I'm going to be
a physical education teacher.

215
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,856

-That's what I thought.

216
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,025
-Yeah.
-So I went home, and my mother is big.

217
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,486
She was on the State Board of Education
in Mississippi.

218

-RITA: Wow.
-Education, very important.

219
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,948
And I thought
she'd be very happy that I said,

220
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,867
"I'm gonna be
a physical education instructor...

221
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,160
-RITA: Yeah.
-"...and a coach."

222

-KYLA: Yes, Mommy!
-Isn't it?

228
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,547
And so, I was like, "Oh, you're right."

-I'm letting it define...

230

231
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,135
-KYLA: Mm.
-I don't see anybody

00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,512
-who looks like me...
-RITA: Wow. Yeah.

233
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,598
...but... but I'm gonna do it.
And Rita, when I look...

234
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,559
Have you heard her music?

235
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,269
-Have you heard this woman's music?
-No, I haven't.

236
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,104
That's what when you... when you...
when she walked up,

237
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,523
and you said you've been listening
to their music, I'm like, "Hold on.

238
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,857
-"Wait a minute."

239

-To... to step out...

240
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,654
-How have you done that?
-RITA: Well...

241
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,489
And were you fearful of doing that?

242
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,033
Terrified.
I was really terrified to do it.

243
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:41,872
But, uh, I had read an article, uh,
that Oprah had given an interview,

244
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,333
and one of the things
that she said in the interview

245
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,254
was asking herself
what it was that she wanted.

246
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,675
And she said most people don't know
what it is they want,

247
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,094
but they never ask themselves
that question.

248
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,179
And once you get the answer,

249
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,766
you know what the steps are to take
to make that happen.

250
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,561
And so, it was like, "What do I want?"

251
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:07,231
I was already married,
I had a pretty good career,

252
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,858
-I had healthy children...
-Pretty good career.

253
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,485
I used that actor’s game, "What if?"

254
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,155
"What if I could ask myself
what I wanted?"

255
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,741
And, um, when the answer came to me,

256
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,869
it was literally like
fireworks going off in my head.

257
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,871
-And that was music.
-Mm.

258
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,416
I ended up doing
the musical Chicago on Broadway.

259
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,710
-KYLA: Mm.
-Now that sounds like I made a big jump,

260
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,795
-but it was terrifying.
-(KYLA CHUCKLES)

261
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,714
Terrifying, 'cause, you know, you had

262
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,383
to put it out there,
"I'd like to do music." And then,

263
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,802
one day, an offer comes in,
and you're like,

264
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,097
-"Uh, yo... okay." And...
-CHLOE: Right. You put it out there.

265
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,977
and sometimes your family
can be the... the... the people

266
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,939
that know that you should do something
even before you think you can.

267
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,733
It was one thing to have the dream,

268
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,320
and then it was another thing to say,
"Now I'm putting myself out there."

269
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,696
-KYLA: Yeah.
-But I did do it

270
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,741
and what it led me to was, um,

271
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,619
realizing how much I needed music
in my life.

272
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,665
People usually know
what it is that they want,

273
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,124
but somewhere along the line,

274
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,834
-it gets squashed.
-Yes.

275
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,045
If you wanted to be a singer or a dancer,

276
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,757
and, uh, you... you heard
from a... an adult that said,

277
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,467

-ROBIN: Hmm.

278
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,593
"...you can't dance."

279
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,761
-Yeah.
-RITA: Or, "Singing?

280
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,096
"You can't make a living at that!"

281
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,848
-Whatever. People...
-People put their own insecurities on you.

282
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,977
...they put their own insecurities
and their own fears on you.

-KYLA: Mm-hmm.
-And I...

284
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,609
I always tell people, "Look,
if there's something that you want to do,

285
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,654
"you don't need to necessarily do it

And just took a moment
to take in all my accomplishments,

324
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,541
-everything that I've...
-Good for you.

325
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,627
-RITA: Yes.
-...been able to overcome. And the minute

326
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,254
I did that, I felt a sense of closure.

327
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,631
-KYLA: Mm.
-Like...

328
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,760
I'm amazing. I'm incredible.
I'm talented. I'm smart.

329
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,720
-That validation...
-That's great!

330
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,347
-KYLA: Yes.
-CHLOE: ...from myself...

331
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,890
-Yes.
-...to myself

332
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,267
was the most important thing
I think I have ever done.

333
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,019
KYLA: 'Cause that's the main thing
that matters.

334
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,103
-Yeah.
-ROBIN: (CHUCKLES) Yeah!

335
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,230
That's what matters the most.

336
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,356
-CHLOE: Yeah.
-RITA: More so...

337
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,025
-KYLA: It's how you feel about yourself.
-Isn't it true, your first gold medal

338
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,610
for a while, you just threw it
in the trash?

339
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,946
I did.
That was a dark story though. (LAUGHS)

340
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,489
-ROBIN: No, but I mean...
-(LAUGHS)

341
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,367
-But, uh...
-Yeah, no. So, I...

342
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,246
So, my first Olympics was when I was 17,
in 2018 in Korea.

343
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,164
-And everybody...
-RITA: Oh, my God.

344
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,083
Everybody leading up to it was like...

345
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,209
The pressure.

346
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,794
-But it was also just like...
-KYLA: Mm.

347
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,547
...strike when the iron's hot,
'cause nobody's gonna care afterwards.

348
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,549
-'Cause women's halfpipe snowboarding...
-ROBIN: Ooh.

349
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,218
-...wasn't that big, really.
-ROBIN: Yeah.

350
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,680
That year, uh, my life
just changed completely.

351
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,559
You know? Um, people were recognizing me
at Corner Bakery,

352
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,936
where I would go
and get my breakfast panini.

353
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,729
-ROBIN: Mm-hmm.
-Um, like,

354
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,733
everyone's always taking photos of me.
I just felt so out of place cause that...

355
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,986
-ROBIN: Wow.
-...really only happened in the mountains.

356
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,946
I never thought
it would happen to me at home.

357
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,072
-ROBIN: Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

358
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,784
And I had to completely adapt
to that lifestyle,

359
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,578
had so much anxiety, so much fear.

360
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,664
Hated when people would
recognize me and come up to me or...

361
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,708
want a photo with me
and know that that photo...

362
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,543
-ROBIN: Mm-hmm.
-...is gonna end up on social media.

363
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,253
-There's this pressure too.
-Right. Right.

364
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,754
-KYLA: Yeah.
-'Cause I'm 17, right?

365
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,090
Was it worth me winning this medal?

366
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,174
KYLA: Mm.

367
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,596
Because I had to essentially
give a part of myself away

368
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,930
that I valued so much...

369
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,473
-KYLA: Hmm.
-...and that was just privacy.

370
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,351
-How did you reconcile that?
-By throwing my medal in the trash.

371
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,686
-You know?
-(KYLA CHUCKLES)

372
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,938
-For how long? (CHUCKLES)
-Um, I...

373
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,690
I didn't even feel
the need to go get it.

374
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,567
My mom was about to take the trash out,

375
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,485
-and she's like, "This feels heavy."
-KYLA: Hmm.

376
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,739
Looked in it, and my gold medal was there
and she lectured me for a bit, she's like,

377
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,198
-"You can't do that."
-Wow.

378
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,827
But I think that was tough, right?

379
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,371
Like, at 17,
your life to completely change,

380
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,291
people treating you differently,
people looking at you differently.

381
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,336
It's not normal, and as a teenager,
you're insecure, you're still learning

382
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,629
-a lot about yourself.
-ROBIN: Right.

383
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,923
I had no idea who I was,
I just knew snowboarding.

384
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,591
Thank you for sharing that.

385
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,009
-That's not a dark story.
-KYLA: Yeah.

386
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,678
-(CHUCKLES)
-That's not a dark story at all

387
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,264
-because of the light you are right now.
-CHLOE: Right.

388
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:38,020
Totally. I think the most important thing
too has just been positivity.

389
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,941
Staying as positive as possible.
Whenever I would get negative thoughts,

390
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,528
I would try to twist it in a way
that made it feel positive, right?

391
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,282
Like, if I was... went through something,
had a really bad day,

392
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,910
I'd be like, instead of just feeling
really bad about it,

393
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,828
I would ask myself,

394
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,539
-"What can I learn from this moment?"
-ROBIN: Hmm.

395
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,916
"What's the takeaway here?"

396
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,626
"What is the universe trying to teach me?"

397
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,835
-ROBIN: Hmm.
-Mm.

398
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,672
CHLOE: Because I don't think
you go through hardships for no reason.

399
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,839
-I genuinely believe...
-Mm.

400
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,883
...everything in life is a lesson,

401
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,636
and sometimes good things happen
but also, bad things happen.

402
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,762
-KYLA: Yeah.
-And so,

403
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:16,433
I think the only way to keep myself sane
was to try to ask myself,

404
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,018
"What can I learn here?"

405
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,687
-Mm-Hmm. Always.
-'Cause...

406
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,105
Did you go to therapy?

407
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,273
-Oh, yeah. (EXHALES, CHUCKLES)
-RITA: Good.

408
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,442
-I needed therapy.
-Yeah, who hasn't in this room?

409
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,277
-Exactly. No, but I think it's important
-It's great.

410
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,988
-to talk about that too.
-A hundred percent.

411
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,614
Therapy is so important.

412
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,449
-And I'll add... I'll add to that
-(ROBIN CHUCKLES)

413
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,244
because I have never
officially went to therapy.

414
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,831
I grew up always being in the spotlight.

415
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,084
So, I didn't trust
talking to anyone

416
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,420
-about anything that I was going through.
-ROBIN: Oh, wow.

417
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,798
Um, I either thought
that they were going to judge me,

418
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,301
or they were gonna say something,
or they...

419
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,638
there's no way they can
possibly understand. No one's in my shoes.

420
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,890
-No one's dealt with this before.
-ROBIN: Mm-hmm.

421
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,143
And I think just...

422
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:05,733
Also, I'm a very positive person, and...
My youngest daughter, uh, was a preemie.

423
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,693
And I had her three months early.
So, I went through

424
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,653
-a lot of things after having her.
-RITA: Wow.

425
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,864
And I was never diagnosed
with postpartum.

426
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,699
-But I, essentially, was like...
-Oh, wow.

427
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,287
"...Wait, I'm so positive
and all of these negative...

428
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,706
"I'm thinking all these
negative things about myself,

429
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,207
"what is going on?"

430
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,919
And I didn't realize it until later on.
But I started doing...

431
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,173
things, like I said,
finding things that make me happy,

432
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,009
whether it was going to work out
an hour out of the day,

433
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,512
or, um, speaking affirmations
and making sure

434
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,514
that the positive things
that I'm thinking,

435
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,391
I'm writing down,
I'm saying them out loud.

436
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,560
So, the universe will hear me
and understand me,

437
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,895
-and also communicating...
-ROBIN: Mm.

438
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,730
...a little better
with the people around me.

439
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,317
And learning how to talk
to people about,

440
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,736
whether it's parents
or uncles or siblings,

441
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,446
about certain things
where it's like,

442
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,657
"All right. We did X, Y, and Z
when I was younger, not anymore."

443
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,577
Like... I... let me start, let me...

444
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,746
When it... it comes to my kids,

445
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,957
I'm not afraid to be like,
"Let's talk about..."

446
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,709
You know, "What do you wanna talk about?

447
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,544
What do you want to do?"
'Cause I am their protector.

448
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,838
I'm gonna make sure they're good.
When it comes to my man...

449
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,006
-Somebody... Oh, no.
-(CHUCKLES)

450
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,342
I am his protector. I am this, I am that.

451
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,426
-ROBIN: Yes.
-And him for me.

452
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,053
But I realized
I wasn't doing that for myself.

453
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,556
-RITA: Yeah.
-And it's amazing that you are able

454
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,058
to have that at this age,

455
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,851
um, 'cause not a lot of people...

456
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,187
They get it later,
or they don't get it at all.

457
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,772
I was gonna say they don't get it at all.

458
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,109
Or they don't get it at all. The fact that
you went through that. It's crazy,

459
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,028
because it's like,
we've had similar experiences,

460
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,863
-but not exactly the same...
-(CHUCKLES)

461
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,282
...but it's this...
This is why I love this.

462
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,409
-That's what's beautiful about it.
-KYLA: (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

463
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,661
What works for you.

464
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,247
Friend of mine said to me...
You know how everybody says,

465
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,791
"Life is short," or, "Life is long"?

466
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,502
I have a friend that says,
"Life is finite."

467
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,628
Yeah.

468
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,089
-RITA: We are all going... one day.
-At some point. (CHUCKLES)

469
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,423
-Right.
-(KYLA CHUCKLES)

470
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:59,888
So, however you use that time
during, uh, this time we have here

471
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,641
-is important.
-Mm.

472
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,018
It was getting diagnosed
with breast cancer

473
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:09,356
and having bilateral mastectomy
was really a defining moment...

474
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,607
-ROBIN: Hmm.
-...because it's like

475
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,609
the clock is really ticking.

476
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,653
-Mm.
-Um, knowing that,

477
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,698
uh, I was confronted with mortality,

478
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:24,288
everything gets definitely crystallized,
and, um, focused in a very different way

479
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,956
-when that happens.
-Oh, yeah.

480
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,794
And I get up every morning,
say my prayers of gratitude.

481
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,921
-Thank God that I even woke up.
-Hmm.

482
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,299
-Same thing at night. I go through that.
-Mm.

483
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,428
And that is something
I think I... I do for myself.

484
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,846
But I wanted to ask you,

485
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,974
how did...
how did your breast cancer journey

486
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,812
affect you and how your, like,
how your life changed from it?

487
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,273
-Mm.
-RITA: And then also, what it's like

488
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,609
with Amber right now
and going through this...

489
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,194
-Ah!
-...with someone you love

490
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,778
and you're on the other side of it.

491
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,697
-Where... where's the tissue?
-I can see you!

492
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,907
-I can see you...
-(LAUGHS)

493
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,950
-ROBIN: I could talk about mine...
-RITA: Yeah.

494
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,703
-...and just look at you just... (GRUNTS)
-KYLA: Yeah.

495
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,706
I talk about her,
what she's going through,

496
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,918
and not because her case
is more severe than mine,

497
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,878
it's when you are a caregiver,

498
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,465
it's totally different than when you're,
um, the person, the patient.

499
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,133
I was an athlete going through it.

500
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,469
-RITA: Yeah.
-The doctors were my coaches.

501
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,388
The chemo was the game plan.
and I approached it like that.

502
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,848
It's been very difficult.

503
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,143
Amber, Virgo, Northern California,

504
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,978
-earthy, crunchy, so sensitive.
-(CHUCKLES)

505
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,146
(CHUCKLES)

506
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:36,777
But, what I learned from myself...
Oh, boy, um...

507
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,071
Stronger than I thought.

508
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,489
I'd never thought I'd...
-Wow.

509
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,449
I'd never thought
I'd hear the words, "You have cancer."

510
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,784
-And I never thought...
-RITA: Mm-hmm.

511
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:44,868
...if I heard that,

512
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:49,122
that I would be as strong.
And I'm not embarrassed. I'm... proud...

513
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,207
-RITA: Yeah.
-KYLA: Yes.

514
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,167
-...that I was strong.
-RITA: Yeah.

515
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,087
Um, and it's unnerving when...

516
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,299
Because the... the, uh, medicine
that saved my life,

517
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,344
put it in peril,
and I had an even more...

518
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,554
-RITA: Right. Right.
-...serious condition after breast cancer.

519
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,931
-KYLA: Mm.
-And I was told

520
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,599
I had a year or two to live.

521
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,851
-RITA: Oh!
-But here I am. And that's ten years ago.

522
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,228
-Wow.
-Almost ten years to the day...

523
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,272
-Yay!
-...that I had the bone marrow transplant

524
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,274
-that saved my life, ten years later.
-KYLA: Oh, my gosh.

525
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,817
But, like you, I don't...

526
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,319
If people ask me about it,
I talk about it.

527
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,113
-RITA: Yeah.
-It doesn't define who I am.

528
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,572
-Everybody's got something.
-KYLA: Yeah.

529
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,783
We all have what we've gone through.

530
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,952
It's made me stronger.
It's made me better.

531
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:32,457
And it hasn't changed me, I think I...
Uh, and Oprah said this and I...

532
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,001
-That's twice we quoted Oprah.
-RITA: Yeah!

533
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,335
-KYLA: (CHUCKLES) Yeah.
-Right? Oprah.

534
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,545
Thank you, Oprah!

535
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,130
It's a good person to quote.

536
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,381
-(CHUCKLES)
-ROBIN: It just...

537
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,841
Something goes like that,

538
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,844
it just accentuates the person
you are to begin with.

539
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,721
-Right.
-ROBIN: It just heightens what's there.

540
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,055
Brings out more of who you are.

541
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,265
-ROBIN: Yes! Yes.
-Yes.

542
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,809
And I feel that it... it has done that.
I'm not gonna say,

543
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,477
"It's the best thing
that ever happened to me."

544
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,646
-Yeah.
-(FORCEFUL CHUCKLE) No, it wasn't!

545
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,565
-(RITA CHUCKLES)
-But I'm glad

546
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,734
it's kind of like
what you were saying, Chloe,

547
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,153
everything happens for a purpose
and you're supposed to learn from it.

548
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,821
-RITA: Right.
-ROBIN: And I learned from that experience

549
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,073
-and I am better for it.
-Same here. Yes.

550
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,158
I'm just better for it.

551
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,659
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

552
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,582
(MUSIC CONCLUDES)

553
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,127
When you talk about longevity,
I was thinking,

554
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,089
"'Okay, I love my day job, I love...
I love saying, 'Good Morning, America.' "

555
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,467
-Yeah. Yes.
-I love trying to bring joy in life.

556
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,552
And I love when we talk about sports
on the show. I just...

557
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,721
Everybody knows my eyes get this big,
and I'm like... (EXCLAIMS)

558
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,097
And so, I... I asked you all,

559
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,932
I know, Chloe,
it's difficult for you at your age

560
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,017
when... when someone says

561
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,312
-"longevity." What is it that you...
-Mm. Mm-hmm.

562
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,980
How does that word...

563
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,815
How do you feel about that?

564
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,276
Does it kinda make you go,
"I just want to stay in the moment,

565
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,153
-"I don't wanna... "
-Yeah.

566
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,573
I think I'm...
I'm such a "in the moment" person

567
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:50,744
and, um, I like to be present.
I never think super far ahead

568
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,705
-because it gives me anxiety. (CHUCKLES)
-(CHUCKLES)

569
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,416
Um, I... I think
I'm kind of a control freak in a way

570
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,126
where I need to...

571
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,545
-Yeah.
-...know everything and what's going on

572
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,838
and that drives me crazy sometimes.

573
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:06,176
But, um, I think
I like to appreciate every moment

574
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,595
I get the opportunity to be in,

575
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,432
just like, whether it be
with friends or family or work

576
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,936
or anything, just like,
taking a step back and being grateful

577
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,897
that I, one, get to be surrounded
by incredible people who love

578
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,273
and support me unconditionally.

579
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,485
-And then be given the opportunity...
-Mm. That's huge.

580
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,530
to have a platform
and spread positivity

581
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,408
and... and hopefully inspire
our next generation.

582
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:34,496
And, um... That's just given me
so much confidence also.

583
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,706
-It's such a good feeling!
-It's such a good feeling,

584
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,708
and I feel so fulfilled,

585
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,460
and just so eager for the future,

586
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,422
that, um, I'm in a really good place.

587
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,341
And so, hell yeah,
I'm gonna walk with my head held high.

588
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,136
I know that I'm... I worked my butt off.

589
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,432
I know that I've sacrificed so much
to gain so much.

590
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,350
And I know that wasn't just me,

591
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,602
-my family did the same for me...
-ALL: Mm-hmm.

592
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,938
...and for my future. And so...

593
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,732
I've... I made it.

594
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,401
I'm good, I'm happy...
-(KYLA CHUCKLES)

595
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,653
and I'm doing everything
that I want to be doing.

596
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,906
Lastly,
to ask you two about longevity,

597
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,533
how you look at it.

598
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:18,373
Longevity for me is just to be able
to continue doing what I love to do,

599
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,460
and allowing myself to try new things

600
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,921
and being the best that I can
at anything that I touch.

601
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,590
Anything that I'm a part of.

602
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,010
I like to always say,
"I don't half-ass do nothing...

603
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,470
-(ROBIN CHUCKLES)
-"...I refuse,"

604
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:36,183
and just... just living
and allowing myself to be happy.

605
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,851
-I'm learning...
-(CHLOE CHUCKLES)

606
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,313
...to chill 'cause I... I...
I don't know how to fully,

607
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,900
but I also love to work. I love to write.

608
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,444
I love to... Well, I guess
writing could be like a chill thing...

609
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,279
-Yeah.
-...as well, so...

610
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,823
I think "chill" is different
for everybody.

611
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,533
-ALL: Yeah.
-You know?

612
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,745
So, I think it's about
what allows you to just relax

613
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,706
-Yes.
-and not think about that chaotic universe

614
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,208
-that we live in.
-KYLA: Yes.

615
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,543
-And also, learning meditation. (CHUCKLES)
-Yeah.

616
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,711
-Oh.
-KYLA: Uh, practicing...

617
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,837
-I learned that.
-Yep!

618
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,382
To me, there's no way
that longevity will not happen

619
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,260
-as long as I have great energy around me.
-ROBIN: Yeah.

620
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,430
And I will continue to stay here.

621
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,225
When people say they're retiring,
I'm always like, "Wait, what do you mean?"

622
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,601
-RITA: I know.
-"How can you retire

623
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,561
"from something that you love to do?"

624
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,189
So, I don't ever see it happening for me.
But we'll see. Maybe like...

625
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,482
-Well, it's like Serena said...
-(KYLA CHUCKLES)

626
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,775
It's like Serena said "Evolving."

627
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,109
-Yes, it's evolving.
-That's what Serena said. Evolving.

628
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,402
-RITA: Evolving.
-Yeah.

629
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,862
-I don't think anybody retires anymore.
-She said that

630
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,989
-Tom Brady started a great trend.
-(ROBIN LAUGHS)

631
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,867
I was like, "Okay, girl, tease us then."

632
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,410
-(CHUCKLES)
-ROBIN: That's it.

633
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,998
Longevity, to me, it's a 24-hour period.
It's literally...

634
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,503
I... I... I... I feel like,
if I'm living each day in the way

635
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,088
that I should be living,

636
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,383
then that just feels like
if it ended tomorrow,

637
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,343
then I had a good long life.

638
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,136
-ROBIN: Mm-hmm.
-I... I can't... I...

639
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,181
My mom lived till 93 and my dad till 89,

640
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,393
so I'm praying
that God will bless me with a long life.

641
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,895
And I want to be that person

642
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:08,525
that gets to spend that time
with my granddaughters and my kids

643
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,944
-and see them evolve, and...
-ROBIN: Mm.

644
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,739
...we're so many different people
over the course of our lives,

645
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,743
like who I am at 14
when I was doing The Brady Bunch is,

646
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,079
yes, part of me is still that girl,

647
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,082
-but I'm a very different person too.
-Yes.

648
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:29,713
So, I think it's an embracing
of all the different parts of who we are,

649
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,299
plus, uh, who we're evolving to be.

650
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,468
But I really feel like, uh,
longevity is just...

651
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,887
It's in a 24-hour period.
(CHUCKLES) You know?

652
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,181
-KYLA: I love that.
-And adding them up.

653
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,018
Uh, 'cause you're not really
in control of that.

654
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,186
But I guess if you're saying,

655
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,440
"How do I approach that?"

656
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,611
It would just be... It's hoping to be

657
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,613
living a centered and balanced life...

658
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,780
-...every day...
-KYLA: Mm.

659
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,532
-...the most that I can get to that.
-ROBIN: Yeah.

660
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,992
You're striving for that fulfillment.

661
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,078
-You're right.
-Well, can I just thank you all?

662
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,914
I just... I just love this conversation.

663
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,418
And this is conversations
that we should have more often,

664
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,420
and my mama... (SMOOCHES) Oh!

665
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,589
-RITA: Oh.
-She was 88. She was 88.

666
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,342
She would say, "We all have gifts,
discover yours

667
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,760
"and share it with the world."

668
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:17,719
-KYLA: Mm.
-Oh, my goodness!

669
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,512
-ROBIN: And it's true. It is true.
-That's so beautiful.

670
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,306
And thank you,
you gave me the gift of time.

671
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,141
-Wow. Thank you.
-KYLA: And thank you for having

672
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:27,896
a platform like this to where we can come
and sit down and speak about things

673
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,149
and... and learn from the women
that we're... we're speaking with,

674
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,984
-so I appreciate that as well.
-RITA: Yeah.

675
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,986
-CHLOE: Thank you.
-I love that you're doing this.

676
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,279
-I do too.
-We need more of this.

677
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,489
-KYLA: Yes.
-(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

678
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,698
It is okay if you're afraid.

679
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,950
The best things that you do,
you're afraid first.

680
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,495
When was the last time
you were ever really scared?

681
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,831
When I was asked
to be the guest host for Jeopardy.

682
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,291
-(GASPS)
-Oh.

683
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,210
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

684
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,170
-KYLA: Yeah.
-I was petrified.

685
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,090
And I did not want to do it at first.

686
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,719
And it was friends and others around me,
they'd say, "Oh, okay, you always like,

687
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,762
"telling us to go for it..."

688
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,846
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

689
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,849
-(CHUCKLES)
-And so, I had the best time.
