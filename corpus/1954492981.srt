1
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,280
Are you alive?

2
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,600
Yes.

3
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,280
Prove it.

4
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,000
It has begun.

5
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,200
- Make a hole!

6
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,800
As I was saying,
form follows function.

7
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
Nowhere is this axiom of design
more readily apparent...

8
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,400
than on board the world-famous
Battlestar Galactica.

9
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,680
This ship, the last of her kind
still in service...

10
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
was constructed over 50 years ago
during the early days of the Cylon War.

11
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,280
Originally there were 1 2 Battlestars, each
representing one of Kobol's 1 2 colonies.

12
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Galactica represented Caprica and was
first commanded by Commander Nash--

13
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,000
"The Cylon war is long over, yet we
must not forget the reasons why--"

14
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,400
- Commander Adama, if I may?
- Captain.

15
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,200
I just wanted to say what a pleasure it's
been serving with you in your command.

16
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,680
Captain Kelly, it's been my honour.
Good luck in your next assignment.

17
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Thank you, sir.

18
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,880
- "The Cylon war is long over, yet--"
- Good morning, sir.

19
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,600
Good morning, Starbuck.
What do you hear?

20
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,480
Nothing but the rain.

21
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,080
- Grab your gun and bring in the cat.
- Boom, boom, boom.

22
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,080
Attention. Honour guard detail...

23
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,280
report to star board hangar bay
for ceremonial brief in grand rehearsal.

24
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,080
Let's go, guys.
Chief's gonna have our ass.

25
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,600
Yeah, well, you're the one that
was supposed to wrap that yesterday.

26
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,800
Shh. It's the old man.

27
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
Too late. What's up?

28
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,800
Nothing, sir.Just another leak
in that "frakkin"' window.

29
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,400
Pardon me, sir.

30
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,200
It's supposed to be a Battlestar,
not a museum.

31
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,400
Sorry for saying so, sir.

32
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Couldn't agree with you more.
Be careful out there, all right?

33
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,400
"The Cylon War is long over,
yet we cannot forget the reasons why--"

34
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

35
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,280
- Com traffic from the Midwatch.
- Hmm. Anything interesting?

36
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Mostly housekeeping. Uh, there was
one odd message we were copied on.

37
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,400
The one from
Fleet Headquarters there, sir.

38
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,200
Courier officers overdue
coming back from Armistice Station.

39
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,000
They've asked for a full status report
on all F.T.L.-capable ships...

40
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,600
just in case they need somebody
to jump out there today--

41
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,400
see if his ship
has any mechanical problems.

42
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,000
I think we're a little bit busy today.
Wouldn't you say so, Lieutenant?

43
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,800
- Yes, sir.
- I'm glad we agree.

44
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,200
And may I take this opportunity
to say that it's been both a pleasure...

45
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,080
and an honour to serve under you
these past three years.

46
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,400
It's my honour, Lieutenant Gaeta.

47
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,680
"The Cylon War is long over--"

48
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,600
Colonel?

49
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,000
You'll see things here that look odd
or even antiquated--

50
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,600
Hello.
Antiquated to modern eyes.

51
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,480
Phones with cords,
awkward manual valves...

52
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,200
computers that barely
deserve the name.

53
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,800
It was all designed to operate
against an enemy...

54
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,800
who could infiltrate and disrupt
even the most basic computer systems.

55
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,880
Galactica is a reminder of a time when
we were so frightened by our enemies...

56
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,400
that we literally looked backward
for protection.

57
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Attention all hands--

58
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,400
Morning.

59
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,400
Attention on deck!

60
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
- Chief. At ease.
- Sir.

61
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,600
This way.

62
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,680
A Mark Two.

63
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,280
Haven't seen one of these
in about 20 years.

64
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,400
If the commander will take
a closer look... at the tail numbering.

65
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
Nebula 7242 Constellation.

66
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,880
Oh, my God.
Where did you find her?

67
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,080
Rusting out in a salvage yard
on Sagittarian.

68
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,000
We had hoped the commander
would allow her to participate
in the decommissioning ceremony.

69
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,200
- She'll fly?
- Oh, yes, sir.

70
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,400
- Ah.
- We've restored the engines...

71
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,080
patched the guidance system,
replaced much of the flight control--

72
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
- You guys are amazing.
- She's fuelled, armed...

73
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,600
- ready for launch, sir.
- Commander.

74
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,600
- What? More?
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,800
Somebody's bucking
for a promotion around here.

76
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,880
I believe that would be
Prosna, sir.

77
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,200
He found this in the fleet archives.

78
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,200
He was doing some research
for the museum.

79
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,600
Thank you. Thank you all.
It's an honour.

80
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,280
You're welcome, sir.
Fall out.

81
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,080
All right. You heard the man.
Let's get number three up.

82
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,600
Attention.

83
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,080
Prior to 2300 hours.

84
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
Uh-oh.

85
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
- Here we go.
- If you're gonna play with the big dogs--

86
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,280
- No fear.
- l'm in. Bet's to you, X. O.

87
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,680
- l'm in.
- I'm not scared of you.

88
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,600
Oh, Helo. When are you gonna learn?
First you're flying with rooks, and then--

89
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,200
- Hey!
- Ow!

90
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,400
And then you're betting
against Starbuck.

91
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,880
"Starbuck. "
Now there's a callsign.

92
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Starbuck. Starbuck, buck, buck, buck,
buck, buck, buck, buck.

93
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,280
Where'd you get
that nickname, anyway?

94
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,080
Was that before you were thrown
in the brink as a cadet for drunk
and disorderly or after?

95
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,680
- After.
- After. That's right. It was after.

96
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm in.
Bet's to you, X.O.

97
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,680
- l'm in.
- Stay.

98
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,480
How's the wife?

99
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,880
Too early for that kind of money.

100
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,400
Hey, did you hear about
that Pyramid game on Geminon?

101
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,000
What were you doing on Geminon?

102
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,680
- This girl there I know.
- What girl don't you know?

103
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
The wife is just fine.

104
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,000
- Talk to her lately?
- Bet's to you, Lieutenant.

105
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,480
All right.

106
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,880
- Thirty to me.

107
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And it looks like I'm gonna bring
this lovely little game to a close...

108
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,480
because... full colours!

109
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Ha-ha!Ah-whoo!

110
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,080
- Ow! Ow!

111
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,000
- Stop!

112
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,280
- Okay, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Hey, hey, hey.

113
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,880
- Okay.
- Hey.

114
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,080
You have finally gone too far...

115
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
and now you're done.

116
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,800
Lieutenant, consider yourself
under arrest, pending charges.

117
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,200
Report to the brig.

118
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,480
- Gentlemen.

119
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,800
Are you really gonna press
charges against Kara?

120
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,000
For striking a superior officer?
You're damned right I am.

121
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,600
Heard you started the day off
pretty early.

122
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,480
I wasn't on duty.

123
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,480
Now, where did you get this?

124
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,800
Tyrol's deck gang scrounged it up.

125
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,200
- I couldn't talk you out of it, could I?
- Not a chance.

126
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
She is insubordinate, undisciplined.

127
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,000
Probably one of the finest fighter
pilots I've ever seen in my life.

128
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,480
- Yeah.
- She's better than I am.

129
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,800
- Twice as good as you.
- Like hell.

130
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,400
Jesus.

131
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,000
Listen, I'm not gonna defend
what she did.

132
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,080
That's because of the cracks
about your marital problems.

133
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,480
But you did kick over the table first.

134
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,400
I did not.

135
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,400
Unless I did.

136
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,400
You did.

137
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,480
So what do you say
we just drop the formal charges...

138
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,480
throw her in the brig,
cool her heels off until we get home?

139
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,080
You always did have
a soft spot for her.

140
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,680
Yeah, I guess I'm just
a crazy old man.

141
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,600
I'm afraid the tests are positive.
The mass is malignant.

142
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,600
- It's advanced well beyond the--

143
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,600
So I also sent
the president a copy of your speech
for Galactica's retirement.

144
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,880
Hopefully, he'll have
a chance to review it...

145
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,600
but there is a 30-minute time delay
between the Galactica and--

146
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,080
- Excuse me.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain. Welcome aboard.

147
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,800
We are en route to Galactica...

148
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,880
and our estimated flight time
is approximately five and a half hours.

149
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,400
Please sit back and relax
and enjoy your flight.

150
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,600
I'll take two!

151
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,600
All right.

152
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,680
- How small they are.
- I know.

153
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,880
- But they grow up so fast.
- May I?

154
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Sure.

155
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,880
There.

156
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,680
- So light.

157
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
- So fragile.

158
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,880
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
There, there. It's okay.

159
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,200
You're not gonna have to cry
much longer.

160
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,080
We really should be going.

161
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,600
- Of course.

162
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,400
It's amazing how the neck
can support that much weight.

163
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,480
Chantara. Honey. Let's go.

164
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,080
I gotta show you something.

165
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,680
- Okay.
- Yeah. Come on.

166
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,000
Give me a moment.

167
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,480
Just a second.

168
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
I'll go with you.

169
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,280
My God! He's not breathing!

170
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
He's not breathing!

171
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,000
My baby!

172
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,280
For those of you just joining us
from the Pyramid game on Geminon...

173
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
welcome to The Spotlight...

174
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,080
our weekly interview programme devoted
to people making news on Caprica.

175
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,000
Today we're talking
with Dr Gaius Baltar...

176
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,080
winner of three Magnate Awards
over the course of his career.

177
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,000
A media cult figure and
a personal friend of President Adar's...

178
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,800
he is currently working as a top
consultant for the Ministry of Defence...

179
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,080
on computer issues.

180
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,400
But he's perhaps best known
for his controversial views...

181
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,680
on advancing computer technology.

182
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,680
Dr Baltar, again, welcome.

183
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,200
Thank you, Kellan. Firstly, may I say
how lovely you're looking...

184
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,880
and secondly, what an absolute
pleasure it is to be on the show.

185
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Well, we're delighted
to have you with us.

186
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,200
Could you summarise your views
for our audience?

187
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
Yes, I'd be happy to.

188
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,680
My position is very simple.

189
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,600
The ban on research and development
into artificial intelligence...

190
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,400
is, as we all know,
a holdover from the Cylon Wars.

191
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,280
Quite frankly, I find this
to be an outmoded concept.

192
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,000
It serves no useful purpose
except to impede our efforts--

193
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
Miss me?

194
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,680
Can't you tell?

195
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,080
Your body misses me,
but what about your heart, your soul?

196
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,080
Yeah, those too.

197
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,880
- Do you love me, Gaius?
- What?

198
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,080
- Do you love me?
- Are you serious?

199
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,280
You had me worried there
for a minute.

200
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,600
- I'm hot, Gaius.

201
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,080
I'm so hot!

202
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,000
Viper 450, this is
Galactica. Approach port landing bay.

203
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,680
Hands-on, speed 105.
Checkers red. Call the ball.

204
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,680
Galactica, this is Viper 450.
Check that.

205
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,000
Did you say hands-on approach?

206
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,080
Viper 450, that's affirmative.
Hands-on approach.

207
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,400
Copy that, Galactica.
Port landing bay, hands-on approach.

208
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,400
Speed 105.
I have the ball.

209
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,400
Skids down. Mag-lock secure.

210
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,000
On behalf of Galactica,
I'd like to welcome you aboard, Apollo.
It's an honour to have you with us.

211
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
Morning, sir. Chief Tyrol.

212
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,280
I'll be your crew chief
while you're aboard.

213
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Morning, Chief.
Captain Lee Adama.

214
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,600
It's a real pleasure to...
meet you, sir.

215
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,600
I'm sure you've heard this before.
I'm a great admirer of your father's.

216
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,400
The service is gonna miss him
when he retires.

217
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Well, I'm sure someone will.
Is your auto-landing system down?

218
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,800
I was hands-on for the whole approach.

219
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
It's all hands-on here, Captain.

220
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,200
There are no auto-landings
on the Galactica.

221
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,680
Commander Adama's orders.

222
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,800
Is that right?

223
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Attention in the port hangarbay.

224
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,600
Raptor touching down.
Clear. Projector is ready.

225
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,280
Nice flying, Lieutenant. I think
they heard that clear up to the bridge.

226
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,680
Yeah. I'm gonna catch hell from the
L.S.O., but it wasn't entirely my fault.

227
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,200
- Primary gimbal's acting up again.
- Oh, it's the gimbal's fault again?

228
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,000
- Helo, am I lying?
- Gimbal looked bad to me.

229
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,400
I've pulled that gimbal three times
and stripped it twice.

230
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,600
- The gimbal's not the problem, sir.
- You're not listening to me, Chief.

231
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,800
I listen very closely to what each
and every one of my pilots has to say.

232
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,680
You're not the one out there
trying to bring in 50 tons of Raptor...

233
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,680
onto a moving hangar deck
with a bad gimbal.

234
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,600
- I've got 1 0 years experience...
- Here we go.

235
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,800
breaking down and stripping
every component and every system--

236
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,480
That's ever been installed
in every spacecraft on my hangar deck.

237
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,280
- The gimbal is broken.
- Shut up, sir.

238
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,200
- Morning.
- Morning, sir!

239
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,200
All right.
Today is the main event.

240
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,480
We have a formation demonstration,
fly-by manoeuvres...

241
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,000
in conjunction with
the decommissioning ceremony.

242
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,680
I've got a few changes
to the flight plan.

243
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,400
Lieutenant Thrace is being replaced
in the slot by Lieutenant Anders.

244
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Also, we have Captain Lee Adama
joining us...

245
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,080
and he's gonna be flying lead during
the fly-by, so please welcome Captain.

246
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,880
- Good to have you.
- Welcome, Apollo.
- Welcome aboard, Captain.

247
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,480
- Great.
- Welcome.

248
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,000
Thanks to Chief Tyrol
and his deck gang, Captain...

249
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,600
you're gonna have the honour
of flying the actual Viper...

250
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,080
that your father flew
almost 40 years ago.

251
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
Great. That's, um--
That's quite an honour.

252
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,200
Yes, it is, Captain.

253
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,800
And personally I can't think of a better
way to send this ship into retirement.

254
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,000
It may interest you to know that
the final results for the C.N.P. project are:

255
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,000
Working close to 95% efficiency
throughout the fleet.

256
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,200
- Hold your applause, please.
- No applause for me?

257
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
I doubt you would've ever
completed the project without me.

258
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,200
- Yes, well, you helped a bit.
- I rewrote half your algorithms.

259
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
All right, you were extremely helpful.

260
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,600
But let's not forget
you got something out of it.

261
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,880
All that poking around
inside the Defence main frame.

262
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Should give you a huge advantage
bidding for the contract next year.

263
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,680
- You know that's not really why I did it.
- No, you did it 'cause you love me.

264
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,880
That, and God wanted me
to help you.

265
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,600
Right. He spoke to you, did he?
You had a chat?

266
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,280
He didn't speak to me
in a literal voice.

267
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,200
And you don't
have to mock my faith.

268
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
Sorry. I'm just not very religious.

269
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,680
Does it bother you that I am?

270
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,400
It puzzles me that an intelligent,
attractive woman such as yourself...

271
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,400
should be taken in by all that
mysticism and superstition.

272
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,080
But I'm willing to overlook it
on account of your other attributes.

273
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,080
I have to go.
I'm meeting someone.

274
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,080
Really? Who is he?
I'm insanely jealous.

275
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I doubt that.

276
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,000
So touchy today.

277
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,480
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm meeting someone too. Business.

278
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,000
A new project at Defence I might do.

279
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,200
So, uh...

280
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,680
you'll call me later, right?

281
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,600
It's about time.
I wondered when you'd get here.

282
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,080
- Secretary Roslin.
- Yes.

283
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,880
- Mr "Kickay. "
- Keikeya.

284
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,200
- Oh, sorry. Hi.
- Hi.

285
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,200
My name's Aaron Doral.
I'm from Public Relations.

286
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,400
- I'd like to welcome you
aboard Galactica.
- Thank you.

287
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,600
If you'll follow me,
I'll show you to your quarters.

288
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Attention all hands.

289
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,000
At this time, Galactica
would like to welcome aboard...

290
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,400
the secretary of education,
Laura Roslin.

291
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,000
The secretary is a member
of the president's cabinet.

292
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,200
We're honoured by her presence
aboard our ship...

293
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,600
and her participation this afternoon in
Galactica's decommissioning ceremony.

294
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,200
Madam Secretary?

295
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,280
Madam Secretary?

296
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,480
Yes, that's exactly what I would think.

297
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,680
Attention all hands.
E.V.A. activity on hull.

298
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,080
Do not radiate any electrical equipment
while E.V.A. is in progress.

299
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,080
Thank you.

300
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,680
In or out.

301
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,400
- Excuse me?
- Get in or get out.

302
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,200
- Shut the hatch.
- Sorry.

303
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,680
Where are you trying to be?

304
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,680
Uh, visitor's quarters.
I'm a visitor.

305
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,280
Yeah. Never would've guessed.

306
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,600
It tells people things
like where the restroom is.

307
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,280
It's an integrated computer network,
and I will not have it aboard this ship.

308
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,080
I heard you're one of those people.
You're actually afraid of computers.

309
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,480
No. There are many computers
on this ship, but they're not networked.

310
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,600
A computerised network would
simply make it faster and easier
for the teachers to be able to teach--

311
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,080
Let me explain something to you.

312
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Many good men and women
lost their lives aboard this ship...

313
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,280
because someone wanted a faster
computer to make life easier.

314
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,480
I'm sorry that I'm inconveniencing
you or the teachers...

315
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,080
but I will not allow
a network computerised system...

316
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,000
to be placed on this ship
while I'm in command.

317
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,480
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

318
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,400
Thank you. Excuse me.

319
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,000
This seems familiar.

320
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,200
Captain Adama, sir.

321
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,680
Sorry I wasn't there to greet you
with the rest of the squadron.

322
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,880
Did they kiss your ass
to your satisfaction?

323
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,600
So, what's the charge this time?

324
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,400
Striking a superior asshole.

325
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,400
Ah. I bet you've been waiting
all day to say that one.

326
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,800
- Most of the afternoon, yeah.
- Right.

327
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,200
So, how long's it been?

328
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,080
- Two years.
- Two years. We must be getting old.

329
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,800
Seems like the funeral
was just a couple months ago.

330
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,800
Yeah.

331
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,400
Your old man's doin' fine.
We don't talk about it much.

332
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,880
Maybe two or three times a year.
He still struggles with it, though.

333
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,280
- I haven't seen him.
- Why not?

334
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,880
- Kara, don't even start.
- How long are you gonna do this?

335
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,200
- I'm not doing anything.
- He lost his son, Lee.

336
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,480
And who's responsible for that?

337
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,000
Same old Lee.
You haven't changed either.

338
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,480
Zak was my brother.

339
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,080
What was he to me? Nothin'?

340
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,280
That's not what I meant.
And you know what--

341
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,800
You know what?
You should go.

342
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,800
I'm gettin' the urge to hit
another superior asshole.

343
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,080
Gaius.

344
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,680
Gaius!

345
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,000
- What are you doing here?
- Who the hell are you?

346
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,080
Get out.

347
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,800
Gaius, who is this woman?

348
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,600
Uh, she's a friend. Well, more
than a friend. When I say friend--

349
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,800
Get out.

350
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,400
This is just great.

351
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,680
Bye.

352
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,600
Look, it's, uh--
It's me, all right?

353
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,400
lt-lt-lt's totally me.

354
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
I screwed up.

355
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,600
I am screwed up.
I always have been.

356
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,880
It's a, uh-- It's a flaw
in my character that I have.

357
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,800
- I've always hated it and I've tried--
- Spare me your feigned...

358
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,080
self-awareness and remorse.

359
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,600
I came here because
I have something to tell you.

360
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,080
Oh, here he is.
If you'd just like to--

361
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,000
A little space.
Captain, thank you for joining us.

362
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,880
Hi. Aaron Doral.

363
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,800
If you'd just like to stand up there,
we'll get a few shots of you...

364
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,880
and the commander.

365
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,880
Thanks.

366
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,480
Hello, Captain.

367
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,400
Great. Okay, gentlemen,
could you maybe stand a bit closer?

368
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,680
Fantastic. Um, Commander...

369
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,280
could you put your arm
around your son?

370
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,400
Great. Perfect.

371
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,600
Okay. Thank you very much.
Um, see you at the ceremony.

372
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,800
We'll just be leaving this--
through this door way and to our right.

373
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Attention, honour guard detail,
report to starboard hangarbay.

374
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,600
You want some, uh, coffee?

375
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,800
No, sir. Thank you, sir.

376
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,080
Why don't you sit down?

377
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,800
Congratulations on making captain.
Sorry I wasn't there.

378
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,400
Thank you, sir.

379
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,480
- How's your mother?
- Getting married.

380
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,800
Good for her.

381
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,600
We spoke about a year ago.
Had a real heart-to-heart. It was good.

382
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,400
I'm glad to hear that, sir.
Will that be all?

383
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,400
- Why don't you talk to me, Lee?
- What do you want to talk about?

384
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,400
- Anything. You've been here for an hour.
- Well, I don't have anything to say.

385
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,600
My orders said report here
and participate in the ceremony.

386
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,280
So I'm-I'm here, and I'm gonna
participate in the ceremony.

387
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,600
There wasn't anything in my orders
about having any heart-to-heart
chats with the old man.

388
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,680
Accidents happen in the service.

389
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,280
Dad, listen, I--

390
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,080
- You know all the things that you
talked to me about at the funeral--
- I really don't want to do this!

391
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,400
- They still ring in my ears after two years.
- Good!

392
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:39,000
Good. 'Cause-- 'Cause you know what?
They were meant to.

393
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,600
Zak had a choice. You both did.

394
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,400
"A man isn't a man until he wears
the wings of a Viper pilot."

395
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,400
Doesn't that sound
at all familiar to you?

396
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,200
That's not fair, son.

397
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,680
No, it's not fair.

398
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,880
Because one of us wasn't cut out
to wear the uniform.

399
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,080
- He earned his wings,
just like we all did.
- One of us wasn't cut out to be a pilot.

400
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,480
One of us wouldn't
have made it into flight school...

401
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,200
if his old man, his daddy,
hadn't pulled the strings!

402
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,200
That's an exaggeration.

403
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,400
I did nothing for him that
I wouldn't have done for anyone else.

404
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,080
You're not even listening to me.

405
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Wh-Why can't you get this
through your head?

406
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,800
Zak did not belong in that plane!

407
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,480
He shouldn't have been there.

408
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,600
He-He was only doing it for you.

409
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,000
Face it. You killed him.

410
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,480
That'll be all, Captain.

411
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,480
So now you're telling me, um--

412
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,400
Now you're telling me you're a machine.

413
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,080
- I'm a woman.
- You're a machine.

414
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,680
You're a synthetic woman.

415
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,600
A robot.

416
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,400
- I've said it three times now.
- Well, forgive me.

417
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,680
I'm having the tiniest little
bit of trouble believing that.

418
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,200
The last time anybody saw the Cylons,
they looked like walking chrome toasters.

419
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,680
Those models are still around.
They have their uses.

420
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,400
Prove it.

421
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,200
If you're a Cylon,
prove it to me right now.

422
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,400
I don't have to.
You know I'm telling the truth.

423
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,200
See, stating something as the truth
doesn't necessarily make it so...

424
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,000
'cause the truth of the matter is
I don't believe a word of this.

425
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,280
You believe me because deep down
you've always known there was
something different about me--

426
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,680
something that didn't quite add up
in the usual way.

427
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,880
And you believe me
because it flatters your ego...

428
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,200
to believe that alone,
among all the billions of people...

429
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,080
of the Twelve Colonies,
you were chosen for my mission.

430
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,680
Your mission? What mission?

431
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,680
You knew I wanted access
to the Defence mainframe.

432
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,400
The-- Wait a minute.

433
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,480
The Defence mainframe?
What exactly are you saying?

434
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,200
Come on, Gaius.
The communications frequencies?

435
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,480
Deployment schedules?
Unlimited access to every database?

436
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,800
Oh, my God.

437
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,800
I had nothing to do with this.

438
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,400
You know I had nothing
to do with this.

439
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,000
You have an amazing capacity
for self-deception.

440
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,880
How do you do that?

441
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,600
How many people know about me,
specifically? That I'm involved?

442
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,400
And even now, as the fate of your
entire world hangs in the balance...

443
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,880
all you can think about
is how this affects you.

444
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,680
Do you have any idea what
they will do to me if they find out?

445
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,000
They'd probably
charge you with treason.

446
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,880
Treason is punishable
by the death penalty.

447
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,280
- This is unbelievable.
- What are you doing?

448
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,200
- Phoning my attorney.
- That won't be necessary.

449
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,080
He'll know what to do. He'll sort this out.
He's the best in the business.

450
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,200
It won't be necessary,
because in a few hours...

451
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,880
no one will be left
to charge you with anything.

452
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,000
What exactly are you saying?

453
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:37,680
Humanity's children
are returning home... today.

454
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,880
I'd like to thank
you all again for being here.

455
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,400
And, Elosha, thank you very much
for those wonderful words.

456
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,080
Next is a ceremonial fly-by
by the last Galactica squadron...

457
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,080
led by Captain Lee Adama.

458
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,080
And now it is my great pleasure
to introduce the last commander...

459
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,400
of the Battlestar Galactica,
Commander Adama.

460
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,600
Thank you very much.

461
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,200
The Cylon War is long over...

462
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,400
yet we must not forget the reasons
why so many sacrificed so much...

463
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,000
in the cause of freedom.

464
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,080
The cost of wearing the uniform
can be high...

465
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
but--

466
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,680
Sometimes it's too high.

467
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,280
You know, when we fought
the Cylons...

468
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,200
we did it to save ourselves
from extinction.

469
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,000
But we never answered
the question, why?

470
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Why are we as a people
worth saving?

471
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,200
We still commit murder because
of greed, spite, jealousy.

472
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,200
And we still visit all of our sins
upon our children.

473
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,800
We refuse to accept the responsibility
for anything that we've done.

474
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Like we did with the Cylons.

475
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,480
We decided to play God...

476
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,480
create life.

477
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,400
When that life turned against us...

478
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,600
we comforted ourselves
in the knowledge...

479
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,280
that it really wasn't our fault,
not really.

480
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,400
You cannot play God then wash your
hands of the things that you've created.

481
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,200
Sooner or later, the day comes...

482
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,800
when you can't hide from
the things that you've done any more.

483
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,080
You are one surprising son of a bitch.

484
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,680
Colonial Heavy 798, this is Viper 7242.

485
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,400
My callsign is Apollo, and
I'll be your escort back to Caprica.

486
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,200
Copy that, Viper 4272.
Glad to have you with us, Apollo.

487
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,480
Viper 7242, Raptor 31 2.

488
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,480
This is Boomer.Just wanted to say
it was an honour to fly with you, Apollo.

489
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now en route back to Caprica.

490
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,880
lf you look out the, uh,
starboard window...

491
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,400
you might be able to see one
of Galactica's old Mark Two Vipers...

492
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
which will be escorting us back home.

493
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,680
We don't have
any further information yet.

494
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,280
There are no
remaining ships able to leave Caprica.

495
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,200
But no actual enemy
has been sighted yet.

496
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,000
Officials are saying
there doesn't seem any doubt--

497
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,280
What have I done?

498
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,600
What am I gonna do?

499
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,080
There's no way out.

500
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,000
- I know.
- I'm sure you know.

501
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,400
That's your doing, isn't it?

502
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,600
Wait. Wait. There has to be
another way out of here.

503
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,080
I mean-- I mean,
you must have an escape plan.

504
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,080
You're not about to be destroyed
by your own bombs, are you?

505
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,600
How are you leaving?

506
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,480
Gaius, I can't die.

507
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,280
When this body is destroyed,
my memory, my consciousness...

508
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,200
will be transmitted to a new one.

509
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,880
I'll just wake up somewhere else
in an identical body.

510
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You mean there's
more out there like you?

511
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,200
There are 1 2 models.
I'm Number Six.

512
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,200
- I don't want to die. I don't--
- Get down.

513
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,400
C.I.C. to commanding officer.

514
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,880
- Go ahead.
- I'm sorry to disturb you, sir...

515
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,800
but we have a priority one alert
message from Fleet Headquarters.

516
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,600
It was transmitted in the clear.

517
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,080
In the clear?
What does it say?

518
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,600
"Attention all colonial units.

519
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,680
"Cylon attack underway.

520
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,280
This is no drill."

521
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,280
I'll be right there.

522
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,680
Action stations, action stations.

523
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,000
Set condition one throughout the ship.
This is not a drill.

524
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,680
Repeat.
Action stations, action stations.

525
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,480
Set condition one throughout the ship.
This is not a drill.

526
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,200
Repeat.
Action stations, action stations.

527
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,600
Set condition one throughout the ship.
This is not a drill.

528
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,200
- Not a drill? They can't be serious.
- Sounds like it to me.

529
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,400
What are we gonna shoot with?
The ship's got no ammunition.

530
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,480
All right, people, let's go.
Let's get this hangar bay ready
for possible incoming.

531
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,400
What have we got?
Shipping accident?

532
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,280
Combat?
Understood.

533
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,600
Condition one is set.
All decks report ready for action, sir.

534
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,200
Very well.

535
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,880
This is a joke.
The fleet's playing a joke on you.

536
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
- It's a retirement prank. Come on.
- I don't think so.

537
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,280
This is the commander.

538
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,480
Moments ago this ship received word of
a Cylon attack against our home worlds...

539
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,880
is under way.

540
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,200
We do not know the size
or the disposition or the strength
of the enemy forces.

541
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,400
But all indications point...

542
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:59,080
to a massive assault
against Colonial defences.

543
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,800
Admiral Nagala has taken
personal command of the fleet...

544
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,600
aboard the Battlestar Atlantia...

545
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,680
following complete destruction
of Picon Fleet Headquarters...

546
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,000
in the first wave of the attacks.

547
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,280
How, why...

548
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
doesn't really matter now.

549
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,400
What does matter is that,
as of this moment, we are at war.

550
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,680
You've trained for this.

551
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,800
You're ready for this.

552
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,880
Stand to your duties,
trust your fellow ship mates...

553
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,880
and we'll all get through this.

554
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,080
Further updates as we get them.
Thank you.

555
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,880
War with the Cylons.

556
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,600
All right, people,
this is what we do.

557
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,680
We're the best, so let's get the old girl
ready to roll and kick some Cylon ass!

558
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,800
Come on! Let's go! Move!

559
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,800
This better be for real.

560
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,280
- Tactical.
- Sir?

561
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,200
Begin a plot of all military units in
the solar system, friendly or otherwise.

562
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,200
- X.O.
- Sir?

563
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,280
We're in a shooting war.
We need something to shoot.

564
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,600
I'll start checking munitions depots.

565
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:18,200
D., send a signal
to our fighter squadron.

566
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,800
I want positions and tactical status
immediately.

567
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,680
- Yes, sir.
- And get Kara Thrace out of the brig.

568
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,200
Boomer, acknowledge Galactica's
signals and send 'em our position.

569
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,880
Tell them we've detected a formation
of Cylon fighters directly ahead,
and I intend to attack.

570
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Boomer, do you copy?

571
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,880
- Copy that.
- Ease up there, Boomer.

572
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Take a deep breath.

573
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,080
Stand by. Helo?

574
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,600
I show 1 0.

575
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,480
No, no, make that five Cylon raiders
on course 324-mark-1 1 0.

576
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,200
Speed, 7.1 .

577
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,880
Time to intercept,
seven minutes.

578
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
- You don't sound too sure.
- A lot of jamming going on.

579
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,600
Cylons are using a lot of sensor decoys.
Sorting through them, but--

580
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,680
Understood.Just take your time,
guide us in. We'll do the rest.

581
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,680
Yes, sir.

582
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,200
So that would put our squadron
about here.

583
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,800
Now, looks like the main fight is
shaping up over here near Virgon's orbit.

584
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,680
But even at top speed,
they're still over an hour away.

585
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,200
Plot a course along this axis.

586
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,200
If we can keep Virgon
between us and the battle...

587
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,880
- we might be able to get pretty close
before the Cylons are even aware.
- At least, sir.

588
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,480
- Commander, ready for duty, sir.
- Good.

589
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,800
Where the hell
did the Cylons come from?

590
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,080
All we know for sure is
they achieved complete surprise
and we're taking heavy losses.

591
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,600
We lost 30 Battlestars
in the opening attack.

592
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,880
- That's a quarter of the fleet.
- I need pilots, and I need fighters.

593
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,280
Pilots you got.
There's 20 of us climbing the walls
down in the ready room.

594
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,600
But fighters--

595
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,800
I think I seem to remember
an entire squadron of fighters...

596
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,880
down on the starboard
hangar deck yesterday.

597
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,080
Yes, sir.

598
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You sure they'll fly?

599
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,480
The reactor's still hot, so all we have to do
is pull the rad buffers from the engine...

600
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,480
refuel it, load the ordnance,
and you're ready to go.

601
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,880
The biggest problem is getting 'em
over to the port launch bay.

602
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,280
- Why can't we use the starboard launch?
- It's a gift shop now.

603
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,280
- Frak me.
- All right, let's go!

604
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,200
Everybody pick a bird!
We're going to the port launch bay!

605
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,400
- What's the latest, D.?
- A lot of confusion.

606
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,480
I keep getting these weird reports
about equipment malfunctions.

607
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,480
- Why is that weird?
- It's the number of malfunctions.

608
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,480
One report said an entire battlestar
lost power...

609
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,400
just before it came in contact
with the enemy.

610
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,200
They said it was like someone
just turned off a switch.

611
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,800
Cylon formation ahead. We're down
to two confirmed Cylons now.

612
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,480
Approaching visual range.

613
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,000
Okay, Boomer, we'll take it from here.
You back way off.

614
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,800
Roger that.

615
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,080
All right, boys and girls,
you break into attack formation.

616
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,080
There might only be two of them, but
I want you to stick with your wingman
and do not get overconfident.

617
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,680
Anybody know
what these things look like?

618
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,280
Pictures I've seen
of the old Cylon fighters were
sort of like a big flying wing.

619
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,200
Those pictures are 40 years old.

620
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,080
- Okay, keep the chatter down.
- CAG, Boomer.

621
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,080
We've got a lot more contacts showin' up.
Looks like a couple of squadrons, at least.

622
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,400
All Vipers, weapons free.

623
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,680
Let's go get 'em.

624
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,280
- What the--

625
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,080
I've lost power.

626
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,600
Jolly. Jolly, take over.

627
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,680
Jolly, can you read me?

628
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,080
What are they doing?

629
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,080
I don't know.
They're going straight in.

630
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,880
Com chatter's gone.
They're not talking any more.

631
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,280
CAG, Boomer.

632
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,280
CAG, Boomer.
Do you read?

633
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,480
Boomer, this is CAG.

634
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,080
If you can hear me they must've done
something to our computer system.

635
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,800
Some sort of electronic jamming.
I've never seen anything like this.

636
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,280
There's no cockpits.

637
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,800
Nobody's flying these things.

638
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,400
Oh, my God.

639
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,880
No!

640
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,080
- Boomer, get us out of here!
- Right.

641
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,680
Once again,
we are processing the information
that we have been given...

642
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:25,200
and I urge you all to try to stay calm.

643
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,080
As we get more information,
I will pass it along to you.

644
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,000
We appreciate your patience.
Thank you.

645
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,000
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

646
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:44,000
- Any luck over there, Captain?
- No. Just picking up
a lot of confusing chatter.

647
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,480
Well, to be honest with you,
I'm kind of glad you're stickin' around.

648
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,480
Makes us all feel better
just seeing you out there.

649
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,480
Well, don't get too comfortable.

650
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,880
This old junker I'm in
was meant for show, not combat.

651
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
If we run into a problem
I'll do what I can to protect you.

652
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,280
But the first sign of trouble,
you pour on the speed and you run.

653
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,280
Don't you worry about that.
I got my hand on the throttle.

654
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,000
It hasn't left since I got
that first message.

655
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,880
Colonial Heavy 798 out.

656
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,480
Two missiles now.

657
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,280
-Jam the warheads!
- I'm trying.

658
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,800
Can't find their frequency.
Drop a swallow.

659
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,880
Got two left.

660
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,680
Damn it. Come on!

661
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,280
- Ah, frak!
- What?

662
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,400
- Check the screen ahead.
- Oh. Guess we found the main fight.

663
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,800
- Missile lock!
- We got one left.

664
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,000
- We're hit!
- Oh, really?

665
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,880
Helo-- Hey!

666
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,680
- Are you okay?
- Present!

667
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,680
Stay with me.

668
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,280
Okay, we have a fuel leak.
We have to put down and repair it.

669
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,480
- Nearest world is Caprica.
- Lot of company between us and there.

670
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,400
Yeah.

671
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,400
So we're cruisin'?

672
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,600
Best way to avoid attracting attention.

673
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,600
No power signature,
go in a straight line.

674
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,880
Unless somebody actually
gets close enough to see us...

675
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,080
we just look like a chunk of debris
on the sensors.

676
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,000
I think we have enough inertia
to make it to Caprica 's ionosphere...

677
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,880
then we power up
and find a place to land.

678
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,480
Nice. Nice thinkin' there.

679
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,400
Preliminary reports indicate...

680
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,480
a thermonuclear device
in the 50-megaton range...

681
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,680
was detonated over Caprica City
30 minutes ago.

682
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,280
Nuclear detonations
have been reported...

683
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,400
on the planets Arilon, Icon...

684
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,000
Sagittarian and Geminon.

685
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,280
No reports of casualties,
but they will be high.

686
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,800
How many people
in Caprica City alone?

687
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,400
- Seven million.
- Mourn the dead later.

688
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,080
Right now the best thing we can do
is get this ship into the fight.

689
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,200
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

690
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,600
Um, one of the passengers
has a short wave wireless.

691
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,200
They've heard a report
that Caprica has been nuked.

692
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,200
It has, hasn't it?

693
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,280
Caprica and three other colonies.

694
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,200
I guess I, uh...

695
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,400
I should go make an announcement
or something.

696
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,000
I'll do it.
I'm a member of the political cabinet.

697
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,480
It's my responsibility.

698
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,200
While I'm doing that,
I would ask that you...

699
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,880
contact the Ministry of Civil Defence
and see what we can do to help.

700
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,800
- Including the colonies of Caprica...

701
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,200
- Picon...
- Oh, my God.

702
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,480
Arilon and Tauron.

703
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,600
- What about Trevor?
- What about Geminon?

704
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,080
- Anything on Geminon?
- My kids are on Geminon!

705
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,200
Okay, stop, stop! Please, stop!

706
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,000
Please, I'm trying
to reach the government right now
to get more information.

707
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:33,400
In the meantime,
we should all be prepared for
an extended stay aboard this ship.

708
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,800
So, uh, you, please,
and you, uh...

709
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,480
take an inventory of
the emergency supplies and rations.

710
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,880
Hey, wait a minute.
Who put you in charge?

711
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,600
Well, that's a good question.

712
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,680
The answer is no one.

713
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:54,880
But this is a government ship,
and I am the senior government official,
so that puts me in charge.

714
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,480
So why don't you help me out
and go down into the cargo area...

715
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,680
and see about setting it up
as a living space.

716
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:08,600
Everyone else, please, uh,
please try and stay calm. Thank you.

717
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,400
All right,
this is the passenger manifest.

718
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,000
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

719
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,680
My parents moved to Picon
two months ago...

720
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,880
to be closer to my sisters
and their families...

721
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,280
and their grandkids and--

722
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,600
Um--

723
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,200
Madam Secretary,
we've got your comlink.

724
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,600
Yeah.

725
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,880
Thank God you’re not here, Laura.
Thank God.

726
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,880
-Jack.
- l've never seen anything like it.

727
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
- Where is the president?
- Dust in the air, thousands of people
wandering the streets.

728
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,800
Where is the president, Jack?

729
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,880
- Is he alive?
- I don't know. I think so.

730
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,280
We hear all kinds of things.

731
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,400
Have the Cylons made any demands?
Do we know what they want?

732
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,800
No. No contact.
I'm pretty sure about that.

733
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,880
Has anyone discussed--

734
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,880
Has anyone discussed
the possibility of surrender?

735
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,400
- Has it been considered?
- After Picon was nuked...

736
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,680
the president offered a complete
unconditional surrender.

737
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,800
- The Cylons didn't even respond.
- Colonial Heavy 789.

738
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,280
- Where?

739
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,800
What should we do?

740
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,280
Uh, copy that.
The Cylons have found us.

741
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,600
- There's an inbound missile.
- Where the hell did our escort go?

742
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,080
Krypter, krypter, krypter.

743
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,080
This is Apollo to Colonial Heavy 798.

744
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,280
l'm declaring an emergency.
Flight systems are off-line.

745
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,400
Need assistance.

746
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,080
That's six.

747
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,880
- How you comin' on that fuel line?
- Almost there.

748
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,680
We'll be airborne pretty soon.

749
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,200
- Okay, that should do it.
- Sharon.

750
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Grab your sidearm.

751
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,680
- Helo--
-Just stand your ground.

752
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,480
Captain, are you all right?

753
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,800
I'm fine.

754
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,800
Uh, my name's Aaron Doral.
I met you before.

755
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,800
Took some publicity photos
with you and your father.

756
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,880
- What are these things?
- Electric pulse generators
from the Galactica.

757
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,600
Really? That's interesting.
Captain, I can't tell you
how glad I am to see you.

758
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,600
Oh? Why is that?

759
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,480
Personally, I'd feel a lot better if someone
qualified were in charge around here.

760
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,280
- Is something wrong with your pilot?
- No.

761
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,000
It's just that he's not the one
giving orders.

762
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,280
This is, uh--
It's a bad situation, isn't it, sir?

763
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,000
- Yes, it is.
- Right.

764
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,280
What if we transfer the "L" containers
from bay three to bay four?

765
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,800
- Then we would have
one, two and three for passengers.
- Yeah, that's doable.

766
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,800
That's a lot of heavy lifting
without dock loaders.

767
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,400
A little hard work is just what
the people need right now.

768
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,880
Captain, good to see you again.

769
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
- Likewise. Thanks for the lift.
- You should thank her.

770
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,080
- Start the cargo transfer
and prep bay three for survivors.
- Yes, ma'am.

771
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,880
I'm sorry. Survivors?

772
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,680
As soon as the attack began,
the government ordered
a full stop on all civilian vessels...

773
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,480
so now we've got hundreds
of stranded ships in the solar system.

774
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,680
Some are lost, some are damaged,
some are losing power.

775
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,400
We have enough space on this ship
to accommodate up to 500 people...

776
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,400
and we're going
to need every bit of it.

777
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,400
But we don't even know
what the tactical situation is out there.

778
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,600
The tactical situation
is that we are losing, right, Captain?

779
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,280
- Right.
- So we pick up
as many people as we can...

780
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,480
we try to find a safe haven
to put down.

781
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,800
Captain, I'd like you to look over
the navigational charts...

782
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,400
for a likely place
to hide from the Cylons.

783
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,480
That's all.

784
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,480
Lady's in charge.

785
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,400
That's as close as you get, okay?
Let's just settle down here.

786
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,000
Settle down and no one gets hurt.

787
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,600
I've gotta get on board.
I'll give you 50,000 cubits.

788
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,800
- We're not taking money!
- Sixty thousand!

789
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,200
This isn't a rescue ship.
This is a military vessel,
and we're not taking money.

790
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,880
- Please! You've gotta take my nephew!
- We are not taking money.

791
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,400
- Please!
- Take the children!

792
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,600
What about the children?

793
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,200
- What about my wife?
- Yeah, what about the children?

794
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,480
All right, all right, all right!
Children first. Children.

795
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:42,200
- Go ahead, baby, go ahead.
- How many are there?

796
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:46,200
- There's still room, right?
- What about us?

797
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,200
- All right, we can take
three more people.
- Three?

798
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,480
That's the maximum load
if we're gonna break orbit.

799
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,600
- Who chooses the three, you?
- No one chooses. No one.

800
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,880
- Lottery.

801
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,880
Everyone gets a number.
We put the numbers in a box,
take out three.

802
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
- That's it. No arguing, no appeal.
- How can we trust you?

803
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,880
And I will shoot the first person
who tries to board before then.

804
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Helo, get your flight manual
and tear out the pages.

805
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:22,000
Attention. lnbound Dradis contact,
rated highly probable enemy fighter.

806
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,680
All hands standby
for battle manoeuvers.

807
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,800
- Launch Vipers.
- Vipers clear to launch.

808
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,680
Joker, this is Shooter.
I have control. Stand by.

809
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,200
Viper 1 1 04, clear forward.

810
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,400
Nav-con green.

811
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,800
Interval check.

812
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,480
Mag-cap ready.

813
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,800
Cap door open.

814
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,880
Thrust positive and good luck.

815
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,400
Interval... check.

816
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,880
Thrusters positive.

817
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,800
Stand by.

818
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,400
Thrusters fluctuating.
Abort takeoff.

819
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,480
Viper8547, copy that.
Throttle down, tube safe.

820
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,880
- Roger, Viper.
- Frak! Get me outta here!

821
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,400
Go, go, go!

822
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,400
Get the bird out.
Cally, Prosna, on the nose.

823
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,400
Next two wing push.
Last two guide.

824
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,480
Okay, move, move!

825
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,880
Ladder's on. Get her outta there!
Cally, Prosna, figure out what's goin' on.

826
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,480
- Three frakkin' aborts, Chief?
- We're on it, sir.

827
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,480
- It's the pressure reg valve again.
- We should pull it.

828
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,800
We can't.
We don't have a spare.

829
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,280
Bow up half.

830
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,600
Forward left one quarter.
Stern right full.

831
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,480
lnbound enemy contact bearing 247...

832
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,400
range 1 15, closing.

833
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,880
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

834
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,080
- We should pull the valve
and bypass the whole system.
- We can't do that. The relay will blow.

835
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,600
- It'll hold, I'm telling you.
- Just pull the valve!

836
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,480
Firing. Miss!

837
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,680
- Watch it, watch it.
- Engines all ahead full.

838
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,880
Ahead full, sir.
Engines report ahead full.

839
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,200
I got him. Terra 's got him.
Terra 's got him! No!

840
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:32,000
- I can't get a shot.
I can't get a shot!

841
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,080
- Vipers, stay in formation.
- I can't get a lock.

842
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,200
Oh, wait. I got him, I got him.

843
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,200
- Come on!
- Ready!

844
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:42,080
Clear the tube! Let's go!
Get her in. Move, move!

845
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,800
- Oh, frak me!

846
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,680
He's irradiating some weapon at me,
but it doesn't seem to have any effect.

847
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,200
All Vipers, systems are go.

848
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,080
- Hold it together, guys.
- Come on.

849
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,880
- I'm all right!

850
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,680
- Radiological alarm.

851
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,800
He's got nukes.

852
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,600
Come on!

853
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,000
Galactica, you've got an inbound nuke.
All Vipers, break.

854
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:18,000
- Break, break!
- Brace for contact, my friend.

855
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,080
I haven't heard that in a while.

856
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,200
Galactica, Starbuck.

857
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,480
The forward section
of the port flight pod
has sustained heavy damage.

858
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,600
Galactica, you've got
violent decompressions
all along the port flightpod.

859
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,600
Do you read me, Galactica?

860
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,000
Radiation levels within norms.

861
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,600
The hull plating kept out
most of the hard stuff.

862
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,680
Sir, portstern thrusters are locked
open. All bow thrusters non responsive.

863
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,000
We're in an uncontrolled
lateral counter clockwise spin.

864
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,000
Send a D.C. party up to aux control
and have 'em cut all the fuel lines
to the stern thruster.

865
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,280
Okay, we have got buckled supports
all along the port flight pod...

866
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:19,280
and chain reaction decompressions
occurring everywhere forward
of frame two-- 250.

867
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,280
That's a problem.

868
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:26,280
- Saul, take personal command
of the D.C. units.
- Me?

869
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,000
Sir, the stern thruster's still locked open.
We need you.

870
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:34,280
- You're either the X.O. or you're not.
- Casualty list to sickbay.

871
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,000
- Sir.Sickbay is cut off.

872
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,800
Attention. All decks switch
emergency power relays...

873
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,680
to positive and low.

874
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,400
Go, guys, go! Move it! Go!

875
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,680
Chief, we're losing pressure.

876
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,600
The port pod, it's buckling.
We need help!

877
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,800
- Report.
- We've got structural buckling
all along this line.

878
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,400
- We've gotta get those fires out!
- I know. Fire suppressors are down.

879
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,680
Water main is down.
I'm tryin' to fight this fire
with handheld gear.

880
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,680
We've got another decompression
heading toward the port pod.

881
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,680
What are your orders, sir? Sir?

882
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,600
All right, listen. I need you
to get the rest of your D.C. teams
down from the landing bay.

883
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,480
- Give 'em hand--
- No time.

884
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,880
Seal off everything forward of frame 30
and start an emergency vent
of all compartments.

885
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,400
Wait. I've got over a hundred people
trapped up behind frame 34.
I just need a minute to get 'em out.

886
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:33,480
If we don't seal it off now,
we're gonna lose a lot more
than a hundred men. Seal it off. Now.

887
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,080
- They just need a minute!
- We don't have a minute!

888
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:40,480
If the fire reaches the hangar pods,
it'll ignite the fuel lines and
we'll lose this ship. Do it!

889
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:49,480
All hands, seal off all bulkheads
25 through 40.

890
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,480
It's an order.

891
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,000
- Get out of here now! Go!

892
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,200
Get in the compartment!

893
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,800
Venting complete.

894
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,080
Fires are out.

895
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,400
If they remembered their training,
then they had their suits on...

896
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,480
and they were braced
for possible vent action.

897
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,280
There's a lot of rooks in there.

898
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,280
No one's a rookie any more.

899
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,680
One, twenty-seven.
One, two, seven.

900
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,400
Here.

901
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,480
Thank the Lords of Kobol.
Thank you.

902
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,680
Thank you, thank you.

903
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,000
Last one.

904
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,800
- Forty-seven.

905
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,680
- Forty-seven.
- Is that yours?

906
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,480
Excuse me. I forgot my glasses.
I must've left them somewhere.

907
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,680
Could you please read this for me?

908
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,600
Hey. Aren't you Gaius Baltar?

909
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,880
I haven't done anything.

910
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,200
This lady has ticket number 47.
This lady here.

911
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:33,000
- Could you come up here, please?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

912
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,600
What are you doing?

913
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,200
I'm giving up my seat.

914
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,280
Like hell.

915
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,400
A civilian should take my place.

916
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,400
You're going.

917
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,000
Look at those clouds.
Sharon, look at those clouds...

918
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,200
and tell me this isn't
the end of everything.

919
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:03,200
- Helo.
- Whatever future is left is going
to depend on whoever survives.

920
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,880
Give me one reason why
l'm a better choice than one of
the greatest minds of our time.

921
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,200
- Helo--
- You can do this without me.

922
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:13,080
I know you can.
You've proven it.

923
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,400
Get on board.

924
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:29,000
- What?

925
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,600
I think you better go.

926
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,200
Stay back, stay back.
It's over. It's over!

927
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,480
Stay back. Stay back. Stay back.

928
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,480
lt's over! lt's over!

929
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,200
It's over!

930
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,680
Get down! Get down!

931
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,880
This is an official
Colonial government broadcast.

932
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,600
All ministers and officials
should now go to case orange.

933
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:14,880
Repeat. This is an official
Colonial government broadcast.

934
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,880
All ministers and officials
should now go to case orange.

935
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,400
It's an automated message. It's designed
to be sent out in case the president...

936
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,880
the vice-president and most of
the cabinet are dead or incapacitated.

937
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,680
I need you to send my I.D. code
back on the exact same frequency.

938
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,800
Yes, ma'am.

939
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,280
"D"as in dog...

940
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,200
dash 4, 5, 6...

941
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,480
dash 3, 4, 5...

942
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,800
dash "A" as in apple.

943
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,400
Thank you.

944
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,080
How far down?

945
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,600
Forty-third in line of succession.

946
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:34,280
I know all 42 ahead of me,
from the president down.

947
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,280
Most of us served with him
in the first administration.

948
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:42,800
Some of them came with him
from the mayor's office.

949
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,280
I was there with him
on his first campaign.

950
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,280
I never really liked politics.
I kept telling myself I was getting out...

951
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:54,480
but he had this way about him.

952
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,480
Just couldn't say no.

953
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,400
Thank you.

954
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,200
We'll need a priest.

955
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,480
Please raise you right hand
and repeat after me.

956
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,280
"I, Laura Roslin...

957
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,280
I, Laura Roslin...

958
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,400
"do now avow and affirm...

959
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,000
do now avow and affirm...

960
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,080
"that I take the office of the president
of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol...

961
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,280
that I accept the office of the--

962
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:52,880
that I accept the office of the president
of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol...

963
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,400
"and that I will protect and defend
the sovereignty of the Colonies...

964
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,400
and that I will protect and defend
the sovereignty of the Colonies...

965
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,600
with every fibre of my being."

966
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,200
with every fibre of my being.

967
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,880
- Attention.

968
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,080
Loose, one E.M. C. electricalconduit
on decks 15 and 16.

969
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,080
Use extreme caution.

970
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:28,280
Loose, one E.M. C. electrical conduit
on decks 15 and 16.

971
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,800
Use extreme caution.

972
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,800
What was the final count?

973
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,400
Twenty-six walked out.
Eighty-five didn't.

974
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,000
There's a munitions depot
at Ragnar anchorage.

975
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,600
Boy, it's a super bitch
to anchor a ship there.

976
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:52,280
The book says that there are 50 pallets
of class "D" warheads in storage there.

977
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,400
- They should also have all the missiles
and small arms munitions we need--
- Go verify that.

978
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,880
Sir.

979
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,880
- Do you know
how many we lost?
- Yes.

980
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Set up a temporary morgue
in hangar bay "B."

981
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,800
Forty seconds, sir.

982
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:43,080
All I needed was 40 seconds.

983
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:47,400
Eighty-five of my people.

984
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,400
I told--

985
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,600
I told that son of a bitch.

986
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
He's the X.O. of this ship.

987
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,880
Don't you dare forget that.

988
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,200
Now, he made a tough decision.

989
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:08,680
If it had been me,
I would've made the same one.

990
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:15,400
Forty seconds, sir.

991
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,480
Resume your post, Chief.

992
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,400
Munitions depot confirmed,
but we have two problems.

993
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,080
One, the Ragnar station is at least
three days away at best speed.

994
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,200
Two, the entire Cylon fleet
is between here and there.

995
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,080
- Specialist.
- Sir?

996
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,600
- Bring me our position.
- Yes, sir.

997
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,000
- You don't want to do this.
- I know I don't.

998
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:53,280
Because any sane man wouldn't.
It's been, what, 20, 22 years?

999
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,000
- We trained for this.
- Training is one thing, but...

1000
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,080
if we're off on our calculations
by even a few degrees...

1001
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,200
we could end up
in the middle of the sun.

1002
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,400
No choice.

1003
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:08,080
Colonel Tigh, please plot
a hyperlight jump from our position
to the orbit of Ragnar.

1004
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,080
Yes, sir.

1005
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Priority message, sir.

1006
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,800
Engineering, spin up
F. T.L. drives one and two.

1007
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:31,000
- Spinning up F. T.L. drives one and two.
- Lieutenant Gaeta, break out the F.T.L.
tables and warm up the computers.

1008
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,680
- We are making a jump.
- Admiral Nagala is dead.

1009
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,600
Battlestar Atlantia has been destroyed.

1010
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:45,480
So has the Triton, Solaria, Columbia.

1011
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,880
The list goes on.

1012
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,800
Who's the senior officer?
Who's in command?

1013
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,400
Send a message
to all the Colonial military units.

1014
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,000
Use priority channel one.

1015
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,000
Message begins...

1016
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:08,200
"Am taking command of fleet."

1017
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,400
Geminon Liner 1 701 ,
this is Colonial Heavy 798.

1018
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,400
No, strike that.
This is Colonial One.

1019
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,880
- Go ahead, Colonial One.
- We have you in sight.

1020
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,280
Will approach
your starboard docking hatch.

1021
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,000
Copy that, Colonial One.
Thank the Lords of Kobol you're here.

1022
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,480
We've been without main power
for over two hours now.

1023
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,800
What is it?

1024
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,400
"To all Colonial units.
Am taking command of fleet.

1025
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:44,200
"All units ordered to rendezvous
at Ragnar anchorage for regroup
and counter attack.

1026
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,000
"Acknowledge by
same encryption protocol.

1027
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,680
Adama."

1028
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,280
Captain Apollo, please inform
Commander Adama...

1029
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,480
that we are currently involved
in rescue operations...

1030
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,880
and we require his assistance.

1031
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,680
Ask him how many hospital beds
he has available and how long
it will take him to get here.

1032
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,600
- I, uh--
- Yes?

1033
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,080
I'm not sure he's going to respond
very well to that request.

1034
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,280
Then tell him...

1035
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:28,000
this comes directly from the president
of the Twelve Colonies...

1036
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:32,000
- and it's not a request.
- Yes, sir.

1037
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,280
And, sir...

1038
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,400
Apollo's just my call sign.

1039
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,600
My name is Lee Adama.

1040
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,280
I know who you are.

1041
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,680
But "Captain Apollo" has
a nice ring to it, don't you think?

1042
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,000
Is this a joke?

1043
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,200
- Are they within voice range?
- Yes, sir.

1044
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,800
Colonial One, Galactica.

1045
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,480
Galactica Actual
wishes to speak with Apollo.

1046
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,880
This is Apollo.
Go ahead, Actual.

1047
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,800
Sir.

1048
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,880
Hey, are you--
Is your ship all right?

1049
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:32,080
We're both fine.
Thanks for asking.

1050
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:35,600
Is your ship's F.T.L. functioning?

1051
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,680
That's affirmative.

1052
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,080
Then you're ordered to bring yourself
and all of your passengers...

1053
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,600
to the rendezvous point.
Acknowledge.

1054
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:52,600
Acknowledge... receipt of message.

1055
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:56,080
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means I heard you.

1056
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,280
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that, Captain.

1057
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,200
We're engaged in rescue operations.

1058
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,680
You are to abort your mission
immediately...

1059
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,600
and proceed to Ragnar.

1060
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,600
The president has given me
a direct order.

1061
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,400
You're talking about
the secretary of education.

1062
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,200
We're in the middle of a war...

1063
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,400
and you're taking orders
from a school teacher?

1064
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,400
- We got trouble.

1065
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,000
Stand by, Galactica.
What?

1066
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,080
Uh--

1067
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,800
Inbound Cylon fighters.

1068
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,680
How long till they get here?

1069
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,680
E.T.A., two minutes.

1070
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,280
- He's right. We have to go now--
- No.

1071
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,080
- We can't defend this ship agai--
- We're not going to abandon
all those people.

1072
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:50,680
- But, sir, if we stay in--
- I've made my decision, Captain.

1073
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,880
You're the president.

1074
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,400
- All right, then.
- Permission to go below?

1075
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,080
Sir, we have a remote sensor telemetry
at Captain Apollo's location...

1076
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,280
and two enemy fighters
closing in on their coordinates.

1077
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,800
Colonial One, this is Galactica.

1078
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,480
Apollo, you have inbound
enemy fighters coming toward you.

1079
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,000
Get out of there!
Apollo! Apollo!

1080
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,680
Lee, get-- Lee!

1081
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,400
Fifty-kiloton thermonuclear detonation.

1082
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,200
Cylons moving off, sir.

1083
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,000
Resume... jump prep.

1084
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,880
Resume jump prep.

1085
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:14,000
Attention, all hands.
Jump prep under way.

1086
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,880
Set condition two throughout the ship.

1087
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,880
Set condition two throughout the ship.

1088
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:23,400
- Lieutenant, what did you do
to my Viper?

1089
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,200
I wondered why the engine gave out.

1090
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,080
We're gonna have to pull
the whole mounting. Get the high lift.

1091
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:39,600
I don't know how you managed
to fly this thing, much less land it.

1092
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,160
It's not something I wanna
think about now. Where's Prosna?

1093
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,360
He's gotta get that fraking gimbal locked
or I'll have his ass.

1094
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:49,200
He's dead, sir.
He died in the fire.

1095
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:54,000
- How many did we lose?
- Eighty-five.

1096
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,000
Right.

1097
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,400
Oh, Lieutenant--

1098
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,480
I don't know if you
heard about Apollo, but--

1099
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,480
Heard what?

1100
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Right.

1101
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,400
Any word on Sharon?

1102
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:19,480
No, sir.

1103
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,200
You okay, Chief?

1104
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,880
Chief?

1105
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,880
Get back to work.

1106
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,000
- Three, two, one, launch.

1107
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,480
Drone deployed and transmitting.

1108
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,800
Now they'll come find us?

1109
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,480
There's a lot of interference
around here. A lot of noise.

1110
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,880
Keeps my wireless from working.

1111
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,800
But hopefully, once
that communications pod I launched
gets far enough away from here...

1112
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,680
a Colonial ship will pick up the signal
and start lookin' for us.

1113
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,400
Is everyone on Caprica dead?

1114
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,400
I don't know.

1115
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,600
My dad is in the Colonial fleet.

1116
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,400
They told me he's missing...

1117
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,400
but I think he's dead too.

1118
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,200
What's your name?

1119
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,480
Boxey.

1120
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,800
You know something? Both my parents
died when I was little too.

1121
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,000
Who do you live with?

1122
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,880
A bunch of other people
on a ship called the Galactica.

1123
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,480
You know what
I love about you, Gaius?

1124
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,800
You're a survivor.

1125
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,600
The board is green.
The ship reports ready to jump, sir.

1126
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,680
Then take us to Ragnar, Colonel.

1127
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,160
- Lieutenant Gaeta.
- Yes, sir?

1128
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,200
Execute the jump.

1129
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:19,000
All decks prepare
for immediate F.T.L. jump.

1130
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,480
The clock is running.

1131
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,880
Ten...

1132
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,200
nine...

1133
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,880
eight...

1134
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,800
seven...

1135
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,600
six...

1136
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:44,280
five...

1137
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,000
four...

1138
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,600
three...

1139
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,560
- two...
- I hate this part.

1140
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,240
one.

1141
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,680
Jumping.

1142
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,280
Report.

1143
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,800
Taking a bearing now.

1144
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:33,280
We appear to be in geosynchronous orbit
directly above the Ragnar anchorage.

1145
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,080
- Colonel Tigh.
- Sir?

1146
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:46,000
Let's update your chart for a course...

1147
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,480
right down into the eye of the storm.

1148
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,480
Yes, sir.

1149
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,400
Attention, magazine
safety officers. Report to C.I. C.

1150
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,200
Captain Apollo?

1151
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,480
- That was fun.

1152
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,800
I think it worked.

1153
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,600
What exactly did you do?

1154
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:47,800
I basically just used the-- the hyperdrive
to manipulate the energy coils.

1155
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:50,480
I put out-- put out a big pulse
of electro--

1156
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:54,880
magnetic energy that must've
disabled the warheads.

1157
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,600
Oh--

1158
01:35:56,680 --> 01:36:01,280
I'm-- I'm hoping that it
looked like a nuclear explosion.

1159
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,360
Oh, so that's what that was.

1160
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,000
- So, uh--
- Did it fool the Cylons?

1161
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:08,880
I don't know.

1162
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,880
But if-if they weren't fooled,
then they'd be on top of us by now.

1163
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,680
Does the rest of the fleet
know about this trick?

1164
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,280
I doubt it. It was just a theory
we toyed with in war college. But--

1165
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,080
It never used to work
during war games.

1166
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,200
The Cylons would see right through it
and destroy the targets anyway.

1167
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:27,080
The lesson here is not to ask
follow-up questions but simply to say...

1168
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:30,680
"Thank you, Captain Apollo,
for saving our collective asses."

1169
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,080
You're welcome.

1170
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,400
- Now, if I could suggest--
- Evacuate the passenger liner...

1171
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:38,400
and get the hell out of here
before the Cylons realize their mistake.

1172
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,600
I'm right with you, Captain.

1173
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:52,400
- Five seconds to turn three.
- Five seconds. Aye, sir.

1174
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:57,080
- And turn.
- Bow pitch positive one half.

1175
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,080
Stern pitch negative one quarter.

1176
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,680
Bow yaw negative three-quarters.

1177
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,800
Crossing into the ionosphere.

1178
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,880
All hands, be ready for some chop.

1179
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,680
Lords of Kobol, hear my prayer.

1180
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,280
Take the souls of your
sons and daughters lost this day...

1181
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,280
especially that of Lee Adama,
into your hands.

1182
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,680
- And hard seal.

1183
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:11,200
- Hard seal secured, sir.
- Copy that, sir. We show hard seal as well.

1184
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,400
Go find me some bullets, Chief.

1185
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:15,880
Copy that, sir.

1186
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,800
All right, get your gear.
Let's move out.

1187
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,280
All right, people,
let's be quick about this.

1188
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,600
- Cally, find the genny,
get some lights on in here.
- Yes, Chief.

1189
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:42,200
Let's find out where the lift is,
get it fired up.

1190
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:03,200
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

1191
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:06,600
My husband, he's in
the Colonial fleet in Geminon.

1192
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:09,400
The Colonial fleet in Geminon.
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

1193
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:12,200
- If you'll head right this way.
- Have you heard anything of Geminon?

1194
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,200
Come on.

1195
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:18,160
Captain, I've got two
communication pods left, sir, but that's it.

1196
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:21,480
No jiggers, no drones,
no markers, nothing.

1197
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,360
Well, at least you've still
got your electronic suite.

1198
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,600
That old crate of mine
can barely navigate from "A" to "B."

1199
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:30,960
That old crate may have
saved your life, sir.

1200
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
- How's that?
- The Viper Mark Sevens--

1201
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:36,200
the Cylons shut them down like
they threw a switch or something.

1202
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,800
And I've been hearing
reports like that from all over.

1203
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,680
The only fighters that are having
any success at all are either old
or in need of some major overhaul.

1204
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,200
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

1205
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,080
Hope he's worth it!

1206
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,880
- Sorry, sir.
- Don't be. I hope he's worth it too.

1207
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,080
Dr Baltar,
Captain Lee Adama.

1208
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,400
The president's asked to see you, sir.

1209
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:03,360
- President Adar is alive?
- No, I'm afraid Adar is dead.

1210
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,000
President Laura Roslin
was sworn in a couple of hours ago.

1211
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,960
Oh. Who?

1212
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,480
If you’ll come with me,
uh, she's this way.

1213
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,800
- If there's anything we can do.
- We'll be here.

1214
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:18,480
I really appreciate it.
Thank you so very much.

1215
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:23,480
Oh, Dr Baltar,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

1216
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:27,200
We met at last year's
Caprica City Symposium.

1217
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,200
Oh, yeah, of course.
Uh, you'll have to forgive me.

1218
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:34,000
- I'm-l'm bad with faces.
- Oh, no, that's perfectly all right.

1219
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,760
I'm sure I wouldn't
remember me either.

1220
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,760
Doctor, I need you to serve as my chief
scientific consultant and analyst...

1221
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,360
regarding the Cylons
and their technology.

1222
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:46,800
I'd be honoured, Madam President.

1223
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,000
- Lieutenant Valerii-- Is it Valerii?
- Yes.

1224
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:55,280
I understand that your ship has
a limited faster-than-light capability?

1225
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,760
Uh, yes, sir. The Raptor was designed
to make short jumps ahead of the fleet...

1226
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,080
scout for enemy ships,
then jump back and report.

1227
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:06,800
I want you to go out there
and find as many survivors as you can
and bring them back to this position.

1228
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,880
We will then form a convoy.

1229
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,880
We will guide them
out of the combat zone and into safety.

1230
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,880
Yes, sir.

1231
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,800
Everybody hold fast.

1232
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:20,080
- I don't want any trouble.
- Okay, let's talk.

1233
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,240
- But I'm not goin' to jail.
- What?

1234
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:24,880
You understand me?
I am not goin' to jail.

1235
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Nobody's takin' you to jail.
Just calm down.

1236
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,000
Frakin' right, you're not.

1237
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:32,160
We're not the police. We're not here
to arrest you. Now put your gun down.

1238
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,960
Yeah, maybe.
So who the hell are you?

1239
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,880
We're from Colonial Fleet.

1240
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,080
We just came to get some equipment
from the station to get back in the fight.

1241
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:44,000
- What fight?
- You don't know?

1242
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,760
- Know what?
- There's a war on.

1243
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,680
Give me your weapon.

1244
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,800
You think I'm stupid or somethin',
is that it? You think I'm stupid?

1245
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,800
You expect me to believe that?
I want passage outta here!

1246
01:42:54,880 --> 01:43:00,160
I want a safe transport ship with
an untraceable jump system, okay?

1247
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,680
Now!

1248
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,200
Look, I don't have time
to argue with you, so here's the deal.

1249
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:09,480
We've got over 2,000
people on that ship.

1250
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,000
Now, if you think you can shoot
every single one of us, fine.

1251
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,000
But if not,
get the hell outta my way!

1252
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,280
- Okay--
- Now!

1253
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,400
Okay.

1254
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,880
Get his weapon.

1255
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,280
If he moves, shoot him.

1256
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,000
I see they've put you to work.

1257
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:52,800
Ignoring me won't help.

1258
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,160
No, I've decided you're
an expression of my, uh...

1259
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,880
subconscious mind playing itself out
during my waking states.

1260
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,800
So I'm only in your head?

1261
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,080
Exactly.

1262
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,080
Hm.

1263
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,200
Have you considered
the possibility that I can...

1264
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,680
very well exist only in your head...

1265
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,280
without being a hallucination?

1266
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,280
Maybe you see and hear me
because while you were sleeping...

1267
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,400
I implanted a chip in your brain
that transmits my image...

1268
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,680
right into your conscious mind.

1269
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,480
No, see, that's me again.

1270
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:34,560
My subconscious self
is expressing irrational fears...

1271
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:37,280
which I also choose to ignore.

1272
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:43,680
What are you working on?

1273
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:47,280
If you were really a chip in my head,
I wouldn't have to tell you,
now, would I?

1274
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:49,280
Indulge me.

1275
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:57,560
I'm trying to figure out how you managed
to pull this kind of an attack.

1276
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,280
You virtually shut down the entire
defence network without firing a shot.

1277
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:04,600
Entire squadrons lost power
just as they engaged the enemy.

1278
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,480
The C.N.P. is a navigation program
but you, uh--

1279
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,600
You made changes to the program.
You said you were building in...

1280
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,680
back doors for your company
to exploit later.

1281
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:19,280
- All true, in a sense.
- That was your job.

1282
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,600
Officially.

1283
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:25,400
Unofficially, I had other motives.

1284
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:27,680
We had something, Gaius.

1285
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:31,200
Something... special.

1286
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,880
This is insane.

1287
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
And what I want
most of all is for you to love me.

1288
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,280
Love you?

1289
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,280
Of course, Gaius.

1290
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,960
Don't you understand?

1291
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,200
God is love.

1292
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,880
No!

1293
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,680
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, guys.

1294
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,760
Just slow down.

1295
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:14,080
We don't know much more than that.

1296
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:18,000
It's just imperative that we get
our equipment and get out of here.

1297
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:23,400
What's in there?

1298
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:25,680
Stuff.

1299
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,800
Get a light.

1300
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,880
Where's your spaceship?

1301
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,080
Docked on the other side of the station.

1302
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:39,200
Be careful!
Don't stack 'em so high.

1303
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,200
Okay, those warheads over there--
Here's the deal.

1304
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,000
They would've brought a nice price
on the open market.

1305
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,680
So you're an arms dealer, huh?

1306
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,680
People have a right
to protect themselves.

1307
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:57,000
I just supply the means.

1308
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,480
You don't look too good.

1309
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:03,200
Be careful with that, all right?
Hey, be careful with that!

1310
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,400
Look out!

1311
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,200
Commander?
Commander Adama?

1312
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:28,400
Stay back, stay back! It's hot.
It's hot. It's hot. It's unstable.

1313
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,200
You guys, go back to the ship.
We need hand lifts...

1314
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,200
fire equipment
and a plasma torch.

1315
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,200
- Go!
- Wait! Wait, Chief. Listen.

1316
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,280
- Commander Adama?
- Yeah.

1317
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,280
Anybody hurt out there?

1318
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:02,400
No, sir. We've got some equipment
comin', sir. We're gonna get you
out of there right away.

1319
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,400
No!

1320
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:08,560
No, get all the bullets
and equipment into the ship.

1321
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:11,800
Don't waste anybody
on anything else.

1322
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,880
- Is there another way out of here?
- Yeah.

1323
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,880
Listen, uh-- Listen,
we're gonna go out another way.

1324
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,480
- Sir, I don't think that's a wise idea.
- You got your orders.

1325
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,960
Tell Colonel Tigh
he's in command until I return.

1326
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,880
Yes, sir.

1327
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,280
Let's go.

1328
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:57,680
Most of the passengers
are from Geminon or Picon...

1329
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,480
but we've got people from every colony.

1330
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:06,080
Give Billy a copy of
your passenger manifest and a list
of all your emergency supplies.

1331
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,760
All right.
What about the power situation?

1332
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,680
Our batteries are running pretty low.

1333
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:15,400
Captain Apollo will be
making an engineering survey
of all the ships this afternoon.

1334
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,880
Uh, actually the Captain said
it'll be more like...

1335
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,080
this evening before
he can coordinate the survey.

1336
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,080
All right, this evening then.

1337
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,400
But you will get your needs
tended to, Captain.

1338
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:26,480
You have my word on it.

1339
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:28,480
- Thank you, Madam President.
- You're welcome.

1340
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,200
Hi.

1341
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:45,760
- What's your name?
- Cami.

1342
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,880
Hi, Cami. I'm Laura.

1343
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,880
Are you alone?

1344
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
She was travelling
with her grandparents...

1345
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:56,200
but grandmother's having some health
problems since the announcement.

1346
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,400
Not to worry, though.
We're taking care of her.

1347
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:02,800
My parents are going to meet me
at the spaceport in Caprica City.

1348
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:06,000
The spaceport. I see.

1349
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,600
We're going out for dinner,
and I'm having chicken pie...

1350
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:11,880
and then we're going home,
and then Daddy's going to read to me...

1351
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,880
and then I'm going to bed.

1352
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,800
Uh, message from Lieutenant Valerii.

1353
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:39,280
She's found a fuel refinery ship
filled with Tylium.

1354
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:41,280
Oh, good.

1355
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:44,800
About time we caught a break. That
brings us up to about 60 ships so far?

1356
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,080
- Not bad for a few hours work.
- No, sir.

1357
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:52,280
But only about forty of those ships
have faster-than-light capabilities.

1358
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:56,080
We should start transferring people
off the sub-lights onto the F.T.L. 's
as soon as possible.

1359
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:58,080
All right.

1360
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:06,400
Colonial One, Raptor 312.
I'm back, and I brought a friend.

1361
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,200
Welcome back, Boomer.

1362
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:11,280
We got a lot of thirsty ships here eager
to make your friend's acquaintance.

1363
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,680
- Did you pick up any
other contacts out there?
- Negative. There's no one left.

1364
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:21,560
- Got a visitor!
- We see him. Can you jam his signal?

1365
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,800
Trying.

1366
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,680
It definitely scanned us
before it jumped.

1367
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,000
We have to go. Now.
Cylons'll be here any minute.

1368
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:36,200
- Will they track us through a jump?
- No, sir. It's impossible.

1369
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,280
- Theoretically impossible.
- Theoretically.

1370
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,880
There are still thousands
of people on the sub-light ships.

1371
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,880
- We can't just leave them.
- I agree.

1372
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,880
We should use every second to get as
many people off the sub-lights as we can.

1373
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,560
We can wait to jump until we pick up
a Cylon strike force moving--

1374
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:51,160
We're easy targets. They're gonna
jump in the middle of our ships...

1375
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:53,480
with nukes and wipe us out
before we have the chance to react.

1376
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,400
We can't leave them behind.
You'll be sacrificing thousands of people.

1377
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,400
But we'll be saving tens of thousands.

1378
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:02,000
Sorry to make it a numbers game, but we're
talking about the survival of our race.

1379
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,800
We don't have the luxury of
taking risks and hoping for the best...

1380
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,280
because if we lose,
we lose everything.

1381
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:11,400
And Madam President, this is a decision
that needs to be made right now.

1382
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:17,600
Order the fleet
to jump to Ragnar immediately.

1383
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,280
Madam President, something else
you should be aware of.

1384
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,600
I have cancer.

1385
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,800
I know.

1386
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:40,000
Little things.
Couple of comments you made.

1387
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:45,680
My prognosis is doubtful.

1388
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,360
I wish I could say it was
the least of my worries.

1389
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,480
But the world is coming to and end...

1390
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:55,360
and all I can think about is that I have
cancer and I'm probably going to die.

1391
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,880
How selfish is that?

1392
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,600
It's not selfish.
It's human.

1393
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:08,200
Is there something
you wanted to say to me?

1394
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:16,800
Well, I-I just thought you should know.

1395
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,680
That little girl you met earlier, Cami.

1396
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,200
Her ship can't make the jump.

1397
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,080
Thank you.

1398
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:36,280
This is your pilot speaking.
Passengers please take your seats
and stand by to jump.

1399
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,400
Thank you.

1400
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:41,480
Set E.S.B. trajectory.

1401
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:45,080
- Colonial One, for
God's sake, you can't just leave us here.
- Set.

1402
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:59,280
- Cycle cryo-fans.
- Colonial One, this is Picon 26.

1403
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:02,280
- I can't believe you want us
to leave these people behind.
- Cycled.

1404
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:16,400
At least tell us where you're going.
We'll follow at sub-light.

1405
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:19,200
- Please!
- No.

1406
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,680
If they're captured,
then the Cylons know too.

1407
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:24,600
I've got 50 people on board.
Colonial One, do you copy this?

1408
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:26,800
- Spinning up F.T.L. drive now.
- Don't leave us here.

1409
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,880
Show a little humanity.
We don't have any weapons.

1410
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,200
All ships prepare to jump
on our mark. Five...

1411
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:37,680
- Colonial One, please respond.
- four...

1412
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,280
- May the Lords of Kobol
protect those souls we leave behind.
- three...

1413
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,680
- I’ve got Dradis contacts.
We've got targets heading this way.
- two...

1414
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,200
- I see them too. Are they Colonials?
- one...

1415
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:03,280
- Oh, my God, they're Cylons!
-mark.

1416
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,880
I hope you people rot in hell for this!

1417
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:51,000
- You all right?

1418
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:54,680
I'm fine. It’s just
somethin' about this place.

1419
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:56,680
What about this place?

1420
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,280
Yeah, ever since I got here,
somethin' in the air affects my allergies.

1421
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:03,080
You always keep me in front of you.
Military training, right?

1422
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,080
Never turn your back on a stranger?
That kind of thing?

1423
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:10,200
Suspicion and distrust.
That's-- That's military life, right?

1424
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:13,160
So you're a gun-dealer-philosopher,
I take it, right?

1425
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:18,480
I'm an observer of human nature.

1426
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,360
When you get right down to it...

1427
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,400
humanity is not a pretty race.

1428
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:25,480
I mean, we're only one step away from...

1429
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:29,880
beating each other with clubs like
savages fighting over scraps of meat.

1430
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,680
Maybe the Cylons are
God's retribution for our many sins.

1431
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:40,400
What if God decided he made a mistake...

1432
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:46,280
and he decided to give souls
to another creature, like the Cylons?

1433
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:53,200
God didn't create the Cylons.
Man did.

1434
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:57,760
And I'm pretty sure we didn't
include a soul in the programming.

1435
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:00,200
Let's go.

1436
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:02,480
How about you go first for a while?

1437
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,480
Copy that. Chief says we're
lookin' at three hours minimum...

1438
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,880
before we have all the warheads
in our magazines.

1439
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,080
The book says there's also 50 tons
of quandal--

1440
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,480
Action stations! Action stations!

1441
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:25,480
We have multiple contacts through
the storm towards the anchorage.

1442
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:28,480
- Looks like more than 50 ships.
- Cut us loose from the station.

1443
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:32,200
Launch the alert fighters.
Set condition one
throughout the ship.

1444
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:34,400
- Prepare to launch--
- Wait!

1445
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,600
Wait. I'm getting
Colonial signals now.

1446
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:38,880
Confirm that.

1447
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,080
Don’t just accept friendly l.D.

1448
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:47,400
Confirmed, sir.
Incoming ships are friendly.

1449
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:56,680
Action stations stand down.

1450
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:00,080
The leadship is requesting permission
to come along side, sir.

1451
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:02,400
They say--

1452
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:05,800
They say they have the president
of the colonies aboard.

1453
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,600
Grant their request.

1454
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:13,280
We are in the middle of repairing
and rearming this ship.

1455
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:17,080
We can't afford to lose a single man
off the line to start caring for refugees.

1456
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,200
We have 50,000 people out there.
Some of them are hurt.

1457
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:24,280
Our priority has to be
caring for refugees--

1458
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:26,680
My priority is
preparing this ship for combat.

1459
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,880
In case you haven't heard,
there's a war on.

1460
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Colonel...

1461
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:37,280
the war is over, and we lost.

1462
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:41,200
- We'll see about that.
- Oh, yes, we will.

1463
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:43,480
In the meantime, however,
as president of the colonies...

1464
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:46,560
- I'm giving you a direct order...
- You don't give orders on this ship!

1465
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:49,400
- to provide men and equipment!
- Hold on, Colonel.

1466
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:53,080
At least give us a couple
of disaster pods, huh?

1467
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:54,600
Us?

1468
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:59,280
Sir, we have 50,000 people
out there. Fifty thousand.

1469
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:02,680
Some of them are sick,
some are wounded.

1470
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,800
Two disaster pods, Colonel.
You can do that.

1471
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:11,080
Because you're the old man's son
and because he's gonna be...

1472
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:13,880
so damned happy you're alive.

1473
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,280
Okay. Two pods.
But no personnel.

1474
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:20,880
You get them yourselves and
you distribute them yourselves.

1475
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,280
And you are all off this ship
before we jump back.

1476
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:29,400
You report to the flight deck.
You're senior pilot now, Captain.

1477
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,200
Yes, sir.

1478
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,680
Knowing this place is gonna be a
museum, they might have given us a map.

1479
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:55,680
- Oh, I think it's this way.
- Yeah?

1480
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:57,680
Yep.

1481
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:09,560
As soon as the other magazine's loaded,
I want a status report on
Commander Adama's whereabouts.

1482
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:11,480
Okay.

1483
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,800
Dualla. Hi.

1484
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:03,360
Um, we're kind of lost... again.

1485
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,680
We need to get to the C.I.C.
Could you--

1486
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:17,000
It's this way.

1487
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,600
It's this way.

1488
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:28,200
There's someone
I want you to meet.

1489
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:30,200
A new crew member.

1490
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:33,760
And he's gonna need some quarters.

1491
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,480
I think I can manage that.

1492
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,480
Hey.

1493
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,680
I thought you were dead.

1494
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:22,480
Well, I thought
you were in hack.

1495
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:28,400
It's-- It's good to be wrong.

1496
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,200
Well, you-you should be
used to it by now.

1497
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:35,200
Everyone has a skill.

1498
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:45,600
So, how-- How go the repairs?

1499
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,680
On track. Another hour
and she'll be ready to launch.

1500
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:53,800
So I guess you're the new CAG now.

1501
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:56,080
- Yeah, that's what they tell me.
- That's good.

1502
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,200
That's the last thing I want.

1503
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:00,280
Not a big enough dipstick
for the job.

1504
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:04,280
Attention,
D. C. T. 14, report to port hanger bay.

1505
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:07,280
Attention, D. C. T. 14,
report to port hanger bay.

1506
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:09,280
I'll be in the squadron...

1507
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,480
ready room.

1508
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:13,400
Hey.

1509
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:16,600
Does your father know
you're still breathing?

1510
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,880
I'll let him know.

1511
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,880
What is it about this place?
What's it doin' to me?

1512
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Must be your allergies.

1513
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:12,600
- I don't have allergies.
- I didn't think so.

1514
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:15,880
What you got is silica pathways
to the brain...

1515
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,880
or whatever it is you call
that thing you pretend to think with.

1516
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,880
It's decomposing as we speak.

1517
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,960
It's the storm, isn't it?

1518
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,880
It puts out something.

1519
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,200
Something you discovered
has an effect on Cylon technology.

1520
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:32,280
That's it, isn't it?
And this is a refuge.

1521
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,360
That's why you put a fleet out here.

1522
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:38,400
Last ditch effort to hide
from the Cylon attack, right?

1523
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,400
Well, it's not enough, Adama.

1524
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:42,400
I mean,
I've been here for... hours.

1525
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,000
Once they find you...

1526
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:49,080
it won't take them
that long to destroy you.

1527
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:53,000
They'll be in and out
before they even get a headache.

1528
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:56,600
Maybe.

1529
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:58,200
But you--

1530
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:03,200
but you won't find out because
you'll be dead in a few minutes.

1531
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:07,000
How does that make you feel,
if you can feel?

1532
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:10,280
I can feel more than you could
ever conceive, Adama.

1533
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:13,400
But I won't die.

1534
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:16,680
When this body dies, my consciousness
will be transferred to another one.

1535
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:19,600
And when that happens--

1536
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:28,000
I think I'll tell the others
exactly where you are...

1537
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:30,480
and then I think
that they'll come here...

1538
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:32,880
and they'll kill all of you...

1539
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,280
and I'll be here watching it happen.

1540
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:38,200
You know what I think?

1541
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:42,360
I think if you could've
transferred outta here...

1542
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:46,200
you would've done it
long before now.

1543
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:49,400
I think the storm's radiation
really clogged up your connection.

1544
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,680
You're not goin' anywhere.

1545
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,680
You're stuck in that body.

1546
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,400
It doesn't matter.
Sooner or later...

1547
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,480
the day comes when you can't hide
from the things you've done.

1548
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,400
So let me get this straight.
You're saying that the Cylons...

1549
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:34,680
found a way to use your navigation
program to disable our ships?

1550
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,880
Essentially, uh, yes.

1551
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I think they're using the C.N.P.
to infect your ships with some kind
of computer virus...

1552
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:45,200
which makes them susceptible
to Cylon commands.

1553
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,680
Uh, well you can see
we-we do have...

1554
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:50,480
your C.N.P. navigation program
here on Galactica.

1555
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:52,880
But our computers
aren't networked...

1556
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,680
so it's never been loaded into
primary memory or even test run.

1557
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:01,160
Good. Well, that's good.
You shouldn't have any problems then.

1558
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:03,080
Still, I should, uh...

1559
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:06,480
purge all remaining references to it
that appear on your memory tapes.

1560
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:10,000
Right. I should probably
retrofit the newer Vipers as well.

1561
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:13,000
Uh, here's the checklist
for the C.I.C. computer.

1562
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:15,280
Ah. Thank you.

1563
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:24,080
- Must be hard for you.
- Mm.

1564
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:29,400
What do you mean?

1565
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:32,880
Just having something you created...

1566
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,200
twisted and used like this
must be...

1567
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,280
horrible.

1568
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:42,080
The guilt?

1569
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:44,600
I remember you telling me once...

1570
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:46,600
that guilt was something
small people feel...

1571
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:49,080
when they run out of excuses
for their behaviour.

1572
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:51,800
It is... hard. Uh--

1573
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:56,280
I feel... responsible, in a way...

1574
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:59,280
uh, for what happened.

1575
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:02,800
But you don't. That's part
of the reason I fell in love with you.

1576
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:05,760
You have a clarity of spirit.
You're not burdened by...

1577
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:08,000
conscience or guilt or regret.

1578
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:10,400
I bet. Uh--

1579
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:13,600
Just try to remember
it's not really your fault.

1580
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:15,600
I mean--

1581
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:18,000
You didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

1582
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:20,080
It's not like you knew
what they were gonna do.

1583
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:22,480
It's not like you knew you were lying.

1584
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:24,480
Not like you were breaking the law.

1585
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:26,480
Not like you cheat on women.

1586
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:30,480
Not like the world's coming apart
and all you can think about...

1587
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:32,480
is Gaius Baltar.

1588
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:35,680
No. No, I know...

1589
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:39,680
exactly what you're saying.

1590
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:42,080
I know.

1591
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:44,280
Right. Well--

1592
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:48,200
Just let me know
if you need anything.

1593
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,200
You know, I really do hope
you make it out of here alive.

1594
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:59,400
I think we can have
a real future together.

1595
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,400
Yeah, that'll be special.

1596
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:06,200
You don't have to be sarcastic.

1597
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:08,400
Especially when I'm trying to help you.

1598
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:12,600
How are you trying to help me?
How-How are you trying to do that?

1599
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,280
See anything there that looks familiar?

1600
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
No. Should l?

1601
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:34,200
Now you mention it, l--

1602
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:36,400
I have seen something like it...

1603
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:38,400
somewhere before.

1604
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:40,480
Yes.

1605
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:45,400
ln your briefcase.

1606
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:55,800
You used to carry it around with you.

1607
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:59,680
You said it was
your electronic organizer.

1608
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:01,680
That would be a lie.

1609
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:07,480
Then it's--

1610
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:10,000
It's a Cylon device.

1611
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:12,200
That would follow.

1612
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:16,800
- Did you--
- No.

1613
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:20,200
Not my job.

1614
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,200
- Then that means--
- Say it.

1615
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:29,480
There's another Cylon aboard this ship.

1616
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:53,680
- Everything okay there, Doc?
- Uh, yeah, fine.

1617
02:11:53,800 --> 02:11:56,680
I've just finished erasing the program
from the defence mainframe.

1618
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:59,280
I'm just going to check it again.

1619
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:03,880
Attention. Recovering spacecraft aft.

1620
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Repeat, recovering spacecraft aft.

1621
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:24,880
You're not helping.

1622
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,960
I'm sorry. How can I help?

1623
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,600
Well, for a start,
you can tell me what that is.

1624
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:32,280
- Honestly, I don't know.
- Well, it hasn't exploded.

1625
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,280
Yet.

1626
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:37,480
I'm just guessing.

1627
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:41,480
- I have to warn them.

1628
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:44,600
- I do.
- How do you propose to do that?

1629
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:48,080
"Oh, look, a Cylon device."

1630
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:52,880
"Really? Well, how do you know what
a Cylon device looks like, Doctor?"

1631
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,600
"Oh, I forgot to mention
I'm familiar with their technology...

1632
02:12:56,680 --> 02:13:00,280
because I've been having sex
with a Cylon for the last two years now."

1633
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,480
I'll come up with something.

1634
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:04,800
I love surprises.

1635
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:09,600
Speaking of sex.

1636
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:12,480
I--

1637
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:15,400
I don't think that's such
a good idea right now, really.

1638
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:18,560
- Really.
- Why not?

1639
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:21,880
No one will know.
It'll be our little secret.

1640
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:32,000
- Doctor.
- Yes?

1641
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:35,400
You asked for a report on how many
civilian ships had your C.N.P. program.

1642
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:41,800
Right. Thank you.

1643
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:43,800
Are you all right?
You look a little flushed.

1644
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:48,080
I'm fine.
Thank you very much.

1645
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:52,000
Okay.

1646
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,880
What are you thinking?

1647
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,200
I'm thinking someone else might need
to be implicated as a Cylon agent.

1648
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:12,560
He doesn't seem the type.

1649
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:15,800
And I don't remember
seeing him at any of the Cylon parties.

1650
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:19,200
Funny.

1651
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:24,080
He's a civilian.

1652
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:26,560
He's an outsider.

1653
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,560
And he's been aboard
this ship for weeks...

1654
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:30,800
with virtually unlimited access
to this very room.

1655
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:33,600
There is one problem though.

1656
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:35,680
Morally?

1657
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:37,680
Practically.

1658
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:41,480
So far, aboard this ship,
no one even suspects...

1659
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:43,800
the Cylons look like us now.

1660
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:54,480
This just gets worse and worse.
Now the Cylons look like us.

1661
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:57,000
Down to our blood.

1662
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:59,200
You realize what this means.

1663
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:01,400
They could be anywhere.

1664
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:03,800
Could be anyone.

1665
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:06,200
I've had time to think about it.

1666
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:09,800
So what do we do?

1667
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:12,080
I don't know.

1668
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:15,080
How we doing on the warheads?

1669
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:18,680
Magazine two is secure.
Three and four within the hour.

1670
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:22,080
Something else--
Lee is alive.

1671
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,280
Commander?

1672
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,680
I'm sorry.

1673
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:27,200
I, uh, gotta go.

1674
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:16,400
Ship's doctor says at first glance...

1675
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:19,280
everything in Leoben's body
appears human.

1676
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:23,880
Internal organs,
lymphatic system, the works.

1677
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:31,280
Well, the, uh, tissue sample yielded
unique chemical compounds...

1678
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:35,200
during the cremation that revealed
the nature of the samples to be synthetic.

1679
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:42,200
- So, he was a Cylon.
- Yes, he was.

1680
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,280
And now we have a problem.

1681
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:49,280
A big one.

1682
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:52,400
If the Cylons look like us...

1683
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:54,680
then any one of us
could be a Cylon.

1684
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,880
That's-- That's a very
frightening possibility.

1685
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,560
We need a way to screen
human from Cylon.

1686
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:05,080
And that's where you come in.

1687
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:08,080
Me? Um--

1688
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:10,800
Rumour has it you're a genius.

1689
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:15,200
Well, uh...

1690
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:17,280
I'll certainly give it my all...

1691
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:19,280
Commander.

1692
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:22,280
Keep this to yourself for now.

1693
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:25,360
We don't want start panic or people
to begin accusing their neighbours...

1694
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:29,400
of being Cylons because they don't
brush their teeth in the morning.

1695
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:32,280
I'll be very discreet.

1696
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:36,080
You understand the mission.

1697
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:38,160
Put my head outside the storm,
look around...

1698
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:41,000
Listen for wireless traffic,
come home.

1699
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:43,600
No heroics.
This is strictly recon.

1700
02:18:43,680 --> 02:18:47,000
- Look, listen, return.
- You don't have to worry about me.

1701
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:51,400
My taste for heroics vanished about the
time I engaged that first Cylon fighter.

1702
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,800
Lee...

1703
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,080
Zak failed basic flight.

1704
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:05,400
- What?
- Or at least he should have.

1705
02:19:05,480 --> 02:19:07,400
But he didn't...

1706
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:09,880
because I passed him.

1707
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,480
His technique was sloppy,
and he had no feel for flying.

1708
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:15,000
But I passed him...

1709
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:17,600
because he and I--

1710
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:22,480
Because I felt something, and I let it
get in the way of doing my job.

1711
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:24,800
And I couldn't fail him.

1712
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:31,800
Why are you telling me this?
Why-Why now?

1713
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:37,080
It's the end of the world, Lee.

1714
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,480
I thought I should confess my sins.

1715
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:50,600
Set!

1716
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:03,480
- Halt! No sudden moves.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, guys.

1717
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:06,600
Down on your knees
and cross your ankles now!

1718
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:08,680
All right.
J-J-Just wait a minute.

1719
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:11,000
- W-What? What do you want?
- Hands behind your head.

1720
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:18,680
If he's really a Cylon, why hasn't the
storm radiation made him sick by now?

1721
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:23,280
Well, I can only theorize that
it takes a while for the storm's effects...

1722
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:26,200
to become readily apparent
on Cylon physiology.

1723
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:30,040
By the time he'd encountered Leoben,
he'd been here for several hours.

1724
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:32,800
I don't suppose it matters to you
that I am not a Cylon!

1725
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:35,800
Smartest thing you could do right now
would be to shut your mouth.

1726
02:20:38,480 --> 02:20:40,480
Are you sure?

1727
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:44,080
One can never be
a hundred per cent sure.

1728
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:49,280
B-But the evidence, uh--
The evidence seems conclusive.

1729
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:53,400
Basically-- Basically all I did
was I expanded on--

1730
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:55,880
on your doctor's analysis
of Leoben's corpse.

1731
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,080
I then went around
the C.I.C. discreetly...

1732
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:00,880
taking random hair samples of people
who'd been working there.

1733
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,600
I subjected that to a special form
of spectral-analysis...

1734
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:06,200
that I've been experimenting on
for quite some time now.

1735
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:08,960
I then wrote a
clinical computer subroutine...

1736
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,400
to screen that for
synthetic chemical combinations.

1737
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:15,560
Uh-- His ones-- His samples
were the only samples...

1738
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:17,800
to register as synthetic,
as you can see.

1739
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:20,080
- I'll take your word for it.
- Right.

1740
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:23,680
And just like that...

1741
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:27,760
Dr Baltar invents
the "Amazing Cylon Detector."

1742
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:30,800
Gentlemen, I understand your concerns.
This is a difficult situation.

1743
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:33,480
But I think you need to take a step back,
take a deep breath...

1744
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:35,480
and really look at
what you're doing here!

1745
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:37,480
I want everyone aboard
this ship screened.

1746
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:39,880
- No exceptions.
- No problem.

1747
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,480
Whoa! Whoa! Look,
I-I-I don't know about anybody else...

1748
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:44,880
but I can tell you
that I-I-I'm human.

1749
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,680
I'm from Oasis.
It's a couple stops out of Caprica City.

1750
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:51,080
I-I grew up on the south side. I went
to the Kobol Colleges o-on Geminon!

1751
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:53,400
I-I studied public relations!

1752
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:56,760
Oh, by the way, I-I don't know
if this is important--

1753
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:58,160
might be important,
might not be important--

1754
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:01,480
but earlier when I was on the C.I.C.,
I noticed that Mr Doral...

1755
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:05,080
seemed to be doing, um--

1756
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:07,760
Well, I'm not exactly sure
what it was that he was doing...

1757
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:11,480
but he seemed very interested
in this odd looking device...

1758
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:14,600
on the bottom of
the, uh, Dradis console.

1759
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:16,800
- What are you-- What?
- Yep.

1760
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:20,760
We should really make a copy
of your brain pattern at some point.

1761
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:23,360
What device? What are you
talking about? He's lying.

1762
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:25,400
- He is frakkin' lying!
- Combat, this is Tigh.

1763
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:28,400
- Isolate the Dradis console immediately.
- Don't listen to him!

1764
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:30,080
Nobody comes near it
until I get up there.

1765
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:33,680
Lords of Kobol.
This isn't happening to me.

1766
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:36,400
- Colonel, your orders, sir?
- If he moves, kill him.

1767
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:39,400
You mixed the samples up!

1768
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:41,400
I'm human!

1769
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,200
- It's not hot, sir.
- Very well. Remove it.

1770
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:49,880
Uh, I don't see anything
in the maintenance records, sir.

1771
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,280
But I'm pretty sure I first noticed it
about a week ago.

1772
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:55,280
You didn't say anything, didn't investigate
a new piece of equipment...

1773
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:57,280
that just appeared in C.I.C.?

1774
02:22:57,400 --> 02:23:00,200
No, sir. I just assumed that
it was part of the museum.

1775
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:03,280
- Sorry, sir. There's no excuse.
- You're not alone, Lieutenant.

1776
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:06,680
Any one of us should have seen the
perfectly obvious staring us in the face.

1777
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:09,280
Especially the ship's X.O.

1778
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:11,800
- What should I do with it, sir?
- Take it to Dr Baltar.

1779
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:15,080
I've given him clearance.
He's become our resident Cylon expert.

1780
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:17,880
Have him take it to the lab,
figure out whether it's a bug...

1781
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,280
or whatever the hell it is.

1782
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:22,800
In the meantime, I want
every inch of this ship...

1783
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:27,280
searched for any other equipment
that just appeared in the last week.

1784
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:33,960
Starbuck, Galactica.
You should be approaching turn eight.

1785
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,400
Copy that.

1786
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:40,000
Starting to lose wireless contact.

1787
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:43,000
Making the final turn now.

1788
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:46,480
Galactica, Starbuck.

1789
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:48,800
I've reached the threshold.

1790
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,400
- Galactica, do you read me?

1791
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:58,800
- Galactica, do you read me?

1792
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:08,600
That can't be right.

1793
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:36,200
As you were.

1794
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:38,680
And medical supplies
are running low again...

1795
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:41,600
Madam President.

1796
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:44,680
Uh, three ships have reported
engine trouble and want to know...

1797
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:47,680
when they'll be receiving
engineering assistance from Galactica.

1798
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:49,680
It's a good question. Hello.

1799
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:52,360
Commander, have a seat.
I'll be with you in a minute.

1800
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:54,280
Keep going, Billy.

1801
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:02,600
Uh, the captain
of the Astral Queen...

1802
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:05,480
wants you to know that he's got
nearly 500 convicted criminals...

1803
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:07,880
under heavy guard in his cargo hold.

1804
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,880
They were being transported
to a penal station...

1805
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,880
- when the attack happened.
- Oh, great.

1806
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,480
He wants to know
what to do with them.

1807
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:17,480
- What to do with them?
- Well, with food and medical supplies...

1808
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:20,360
being what they are,
I think he's considering just--

1809
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:24,200
No, no. No, we're not gonna start that.
They're still human beings.

1810
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:28,000
Tell the captain I expect daily reports
on the well-being of his prisoners.

1811
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:30,000
And if there's any mysterious deaths...

1812
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,960
the Astral Queen may find herself
on her own...

1813
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
without the Galactica's protection.

1814
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:37,600
- Yes, Madam President.
- Thank you, Billy.

1815
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,880
You planning to stage
a military coup?

1816
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:57,680
- What?
- Do you plan to declare martial law...

1817
02:25:57,800 --> 02:25:59,800
take over the government?

1818
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:02,880
- Of course not.
- Then you do acknowledge...

1819
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:07,600
my position as president as constituted
under the Articles of Colonization.

1820
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:09,800
Ms Roslin...

1821
02:26:09,880 --> 02:26:13,360
my primary objective
at the present time...

1822
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:16,600
is to repair the Galactica...

1823
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:18,600
and continue to fight.

1824
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:23,360
What we know at this moment is there
are 50,000 civilian refugees out there...

1825
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:27,360
who don't stand a chance
without your ship to protect them.

1826
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:29,280
We're aware of the tactical situation.

1827
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:32,680
And I'm sure that you'll all be safe here
on Ragnar after we leave.

1828
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:35,360
After you leave?

1829
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:38,000
- Where're you going?
- To find the enemy.

1830
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:40,880
We're at war.
That's my mission.

1831
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:48,160
I honestly don't know why...

1832
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:50,480
I have to keep telling you this.

1833
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:52,480
But the war is over.

1834
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:56,800
It hasn't begun yet.

1835
02:26:56,880 --> 02:26:59,680
That's insane.

1836
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:01,680
You would rather that we run?

1837
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:05,080
Yes, absolutely.
That is the only sane thing to do here.

1838
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:07,200
Exactly that-- run.

1839
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:10,080
We leave this solar system,
and we don't look back.

1840
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:12,080
- And we go where?
- I don't know.

1841
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:15,200
Another star system. Another planet.

1842
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:17,680
Somewhere where
the Cylons won't find us.

1843
02:27:17,800 --> 02:27:20,880
You can run if you’d like.

1844
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,280
This ship will stand and it will fight.

1845
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:25,400
I'm gonna be straight with you here.

1846
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:30,680
The human race is
about to be wiped out.

1847
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:34,000
We have 50,000 people left,
and that's it.

1848
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:40,000
Now, if we are even
going to survive as a species...

1849
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:45,480
then we need to get the hell out of here,
and we need to start having babies.

1850
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Excuse me.

1851
02:27:57,200 --> 02:27:59,200
I didn't get an accurate count.

1852
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,760
It looks like two base stars
with 10 fighter squadrons...

1853
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:05,480
and two recon drone
detachments patrolling the area.

1854
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:09,760
- Starbuck, were you followed?
- Negative. No sign of pursuit.

1855
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:11,680
By the way they were deployed...

1856
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:14,080
I'd say they're waiting for us
to come to them.

1857
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:16,080
Bring her home.

1858
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:18,400
Thank you, Starbuck.
Continue present course.

1859
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:21,480
Return to visual contact
and stand by for instructions.

1860
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:24,360
- Captain--
- Copy that, Galactica. Starbuck out.

1861
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:27,960
Lieutenant Gaeta, stay, please.

1862
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,160
How the hell did they find us?

1863
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:33,400
Doesn't really matter.
They've got us.

1864
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:36,160
- Why aren't they coming in after us, sir?
- Why should they?

1865
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:39,080
They can just sit out there and wait us out.
What difference does it make to them?

1866
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,000
They're machines. We're the ones
that need food, medicine, fuel.

1867
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:45,480
I'm not gonna play their game.

1868
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:49,480
I'm not gonna go out there
and try to fight 'em.

1869
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:51,880
Can we plot a jump
from inside the storm?

1870
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,600
With all this E.M. interference
muckin' up the F.T.L. fix?

1871
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:58,160
I agree, sir. I don't think
we should attempt a jump...

1872
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:00,200
until we've cleared
the storm threshold.

1873
02:29:00,280 --> 02:29:02,200
Have to be quick about it though.

1874
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:04,600
They'll launch everything they have
first glimpse they get.

1875
02:29:04,680 --> 02:29:10,280
Stick our nose out just far enough
to get a good F.T.L. fix, then jump?

1876
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:14,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

1877
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:17,400
I-I'm getting ready to head back
to the transport.

1878
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:20,480
Oh.

1879
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:24,480
- What about the civilians?
- They're probably safe for the time being.

1880
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:26,600
You mean leave them here?

1881
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:29,800
The Cylons may not even know
they're here in the first place.

1882
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:33,600
- They're probably only after us.
- That's one hell of an assumption.

1883
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:36,680
Well, we can't very well
cram 50,000 men...

1884
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:38,960
women and children
aboard this ship.

1885
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,280
I know this is awkward and all...

1886
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:43,480
but what happened
in the passage way was--

1887
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:45,080
Yeah.

1888
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,880
I don't know why
I did that. Sorry.

1889
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,880
I'm not suggesting that. I'm just
saying we can't leave them behind.

1890
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,680
- They should jump with us.
- I don't see how we can manage that...

1891
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:56,200
- without jeopardizing our ship.
- We pick a jump spot...

1892
02:29:56,280 --> 02:29:58,000
far enough outside
the combat zone--

1893
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:01,480
What the hell is outside
the combat zone at this point?

1894
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:04,080
They better start having babies.

1895
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:13,400
- Is that an order?
- Maybe, before too long.

1896
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:16,000
Okay, we're gonna take
the civilians with us.

1897
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:19,400
We're gonna leave this solar system,
and we're not gonna come back.

1898
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:23,480
- We're running?
- This war is over.

1899
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:25,600
We lost.

1900
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:29,280
My father's right.
It's time for us to get out of here.

1901
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:34,760
So where are we going, Commander?

1902
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:36,680
The Prolmar Sector.

1903
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,880
That's way past the Red Line.

1904
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,360
Can you plot that jump?

1905
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:45,080
- I've never plotted a jump that far, sir.
- No one has. Can you plot that jump?

1906
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:48,480
- Yes, sir.
- Do it...

1907
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:51,600
by yourself.

1908
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:57,560
This is a bad tactical position.

1909
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:01,800
We'll pull the Galactica out five clicks.

1910
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:04,880
The civilians will come out behind us,
cross the threshold...

1911
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,800
and make the jump
while we hold off the Cylons.

1912
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:11,800
Once the civilians
have made the jump...

1913
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:14,880
every fighter is to make
an immediate combat landing.

1914
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,960
- We don't have much time.
- I'll tell them.

1915
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,880
I want all my pilots to return.

1916
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Do you understand?

1917
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:26,280
Yes, sir, I do.

1918
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:35,080
So, can I ask
what changed your mind?

1919
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,400
You can ask.

1920
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:43,000
So, what do we do
about our prisoner?

1921
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:46,680
What? You ca-- You can't--
You can't do this!

1922
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:49,000
You can't just--
You can't just leave me here to die!

1923
02:31:49,080 --> 02:31:51,400
You've got food, water,
all the luxuries of home.

1924
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:53,800
No, I-I'm begging you.
Don't do this!

1925
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:56,680
- I'm not a Cylon!
- Maybe, but we can't take that chance.

1926
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:59,160
I'm not a Cylon!

1927
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:02,360
What kind of people are you?

1928
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:04,880
Don't leave me!

1929
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:07,960
- Action stations.

1930
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:13,200
Set condition one throughout the ship.
Repeat.Action stations. Action stations.

1931
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:15,560
Set condition one throughout the ship.

1932
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:18,600
Repeat.Action stations.
Action stations.

1933
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:21,880
- The fleet is ready to jump, sir.
- Set condition one throughout the ship.

1934
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,680
- Lieutenant Gaeta.
-Yes, sir?

1935
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:28,880
Disperse to all fleet--
final coordinates.

1936
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,880
Yes, sir.

1937
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,400
- Stand by to execute battle plan.
- Sir.

1938
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:07,000
Weapons grid to full power.
Stand by enemy suppression barrage.

1939
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:34,800
Incoming, 72 Cylon fighters,
closing at 1 -2-0, mark, 4-8.

1940
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:37,280
Enemy suppression fire.
All batteries execute.

1941
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:39,280
All batteries commence firing.

1942
02:34:07,800 --> 02:34:10,800
All decks,
switch emergency power relays.

1943
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:20,680
Perimeter established.

1944
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:23,400
- Launch Vipers.
- Vipers clear to launch.

1945
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:30,880
Broken formation. Razzle-dazzle. Don't
let 'em use their targeting computers.

1946
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,800
And for frak's sake, stay out
of Galactica 's firing solution!

1947
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:36,480
Vipers in position.

1948
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:40,200
Signal Vipers, engage fighters only.
Leave base stars to us. Execute.

1949
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:08,880
Galactica to all civilian ships.
Commence jumping in sequence.

1950
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:19,600
Incoming ordnance!

1951
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:53,880
Apollo, do you read me?

1952
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:18,400
Aaah!
Come on, boys!

1953
02:36:21,800 --> 02:36:24,400
Looks like you broke your ship, Apollo.

1954
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:27,200
I've had worse.
But thanks!

1955
02:36:34,680 --> 02:36:37,280
Function check on
the damage control panel.

1956
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:42,800
They're targeting the landing bays.

1957
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:44,800
We've gotta get those fighters
back on board...

1958
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:46,800
and retract the pods,
or we won't be able to jump.

1959
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:48,880
Fleet status.

1960
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:53,080
- Last civilian ship is away.
- Recall all fighters.

1961
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:55,000
Stand by to secure landing bays.

1962
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:59,000
Galactica to all Vipers. Break off.
Come on home. Repeat. come on home.

1963
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,480
Viper 1 0-26, aboard.

1964
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:10,160
- Eleven-ten, aboard.
- F.T.L., go!

1965
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:12,280
Sub-light, go!

1966
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:20,480
The board is green. Ship reports ready for
jump as soon as landing bay's secure.

1967
02:37:29,800 --> 02:37:32,680
Two Vipers still out there, sir--
Starbuck and Apollo.

1968
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:37,200
We can't stand toe to toe with
those baseships. Retract the pods.

1969
02:37:47,400 --> 02:37:49,600
I can't leave 'em here.

1970
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:51,880
- Patch me through to Starbuck.
- Sir.

1971
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,080
What do you hear?

1972
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,280
Starbuck, Galactica.
What do you hear?

1973
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:01,600
- What?
- Morning, Starbuck. What do you hear?

1974
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:06,480
Nothin' but the rain.

1975
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:09,400
Grab your gun
and bring the cat in.

1976
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:12,000
Aye aye, sir!
Comin' home.

1977
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:21,280
I'm losing power. I'm not gonna
make it, Starbuck. It's over. Just leave!

1978
02:38:21,400 --> 02:38:25,080
- Damn it! That's an order!
- Lee, shut up and hold still!

1979
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,880
Yaaah!

1980
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:36,400
Oh, no.

1981
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:45,600
You are beyond insane!

1982
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,080
Kickin' in the burn!

1983
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:59,080
Come on.

1984
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:03,280
We're coming in a little hot,
don't you think?

1985
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:06,880
No. Not really.

1986
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:22,200
Come on.

1987
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:27,680
- They're comin' in.
- Hang on!

1988
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:34,480
- They're aboard.
- Stand by for jump.

1989
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:45,880
Landing decks secure!

1990
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:51,080
Jump!

1991
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:23,200
With heavy hearts, we lift up
their bodies to you, O Lords of Kobol...

1992
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:26,400
in the knowledge that you will take
from them their burdens...

1993
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:28,880
and give them life eternal.

1994
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:32,280
We also pray that you
look down upon us now...

1995
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:34,280
with mercy and with love...

1996
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:38,800
just as you did upon our forefathers
many years ago.

1997
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:43,200
Just as you led us from Kobol
and found the Twelve Worlds...

1998
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:45,600
so now we hope and pray...

1999
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:48,080
that you will lead us
to a new home...

2000
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:52,080
where we may begin life anew.

2001
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:54,680
So say we all.

2002
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:56,680
So say we all.

2003
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:11,400
- So say we all.
- So say we all.

2004
02:41:14,480 --> 02:41:17,800
- So say we all!
- So say we all.

2005
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:21,600
- So say we all!
- So say we all!

2006
02:41:24,680 --> 02:41:26,600
Are they the lucky ones?

2007
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:30,880
That's what you're thinking, isn't it?

2008
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:38,280
We're a long way from home.

2009
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:40,880
We've jumped way beyond
the Red Line...

2010
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,880
into uncharted space.

2011
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,480
Limited supplies. Limited fuel.
No allies.

2012
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:53,080
And now no hope!

2013
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:57,000
Maybe it would've been better for us
to have died quickly...

2014
02:41:57,080 --> 02:41:59,680
back on the colonies
with our families...

2015
02:41:59,800 --> 02:42:01,680
instead of dying out here slowly...

2016
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:04,600
in the emptiness of dark space.

2017
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:07,880
Where shall we go?

2018
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,480
What shall we do?

2019
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:13,960
"Life here began out there."

2020
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,280
Those are the first words
of the sacred scrolls.

2021
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:21,280
And they were told to us
by the Lords of Kobol...

2022
02:42:21,400 --> 02:42:24,880
many countless centuries ago.

2023
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:28,680
And they made it perfectly clear
that we are not alone in this universe.

2024
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:33,480
Elosha, there's a 13th colony
of human kind, is there not?

2025
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:39,080
Yes. The scrolls tell us a 13th tribe
left Kobol in the Early Days.

2026
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:42,280
They travelled far and made their home
upon a planet called Earth...

2027
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:44,560
which circled a distant
and unknown star.

2028
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:46,480
It's not unknown.

2029
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:51,080
I know where it is!

2030
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:53,080
Earth--

2031
02:42:56,600 --> 02:42:58,880
the most guarded secret we have.

2032
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:05,480
The location was only known
by the senior commanders of the fleet...

2033
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:09,400
and we dared
not share it with the public.

2034
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:13,000
Not while there was
a Cylon threat upon us.

2035
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:17,600
For now we have a refuge to go to...

2036
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:21,000
a refuge that the Cylons
know nothing about!

2037
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:25,360
It won't be an easy journey.

2038
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:28,480
It will be long and arduous.

2039
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:31,480
But I promise you one thing.

2040
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:35,880
On the memory of those
lying here before you...

2041
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,280
we shall find it.

2042
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:44,800
And Earth will become
our new home.

2043
02:43:48,280 --> 02:43:51,960
- So say we all!
- So say we all!

2044
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,760
- So say we all!
- So say we all!

2045
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:58,200
- So say we all!
- So say we all!

2046
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:08,280
- So say we all.
- So say we all.

2047
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:16,600
- Dismissed.

2048
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:41,280
As you were.

2049
02:44:41,400 --> 02:44:44,200
Just trying to avoid another trip
to the brig, sir.

2050
02:44:45,480 --> 02:44:48,200
Lieutenant Thrace--

2051
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:51,200
Kara--

2052
02:44:51,280 --> 02:44:54,200
What you did out there today
with Lee Adama...

2053
02:44:56,200 --> 02:45:00,800
it was, uh, a hell of a piece of flying.

2054
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:05,880
The commander has always said that
you were the best pilot he has ever seen.

2055
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:09,600
Well, today you proved it.

2056
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:14,600
Now...

2057
02:45:14,680 --> 02:45:16,800
about yesterday...

2058
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:19,680
during the game--

2059
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:22,680
Well, maybe I was out of line too.

2060
02:45:22,800 --> 02:45:24,680
And I just--

2061
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:29,800
I wanted to say, um...

2062
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:31,800
I'm sorry.

2063
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:38,480
Well, don't you have anything to say?

2064
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:40,480
Permission to speak
off the record, sir.

2065
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:42,760
Granted.

2066
02:45:42,800 --> 02:45:44,680
You're a bastard.

2067
02:45:46,400 --> 02:45:50,680
You just don't know when
to keep your mouth shut, do you?

2068
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:53,200
I am offering you a clean slate here.

2069
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:55,680
I'm not interested in
a clean slate with you.

2070
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:57,680
You're dangerous.

2071
02:45:57,800 --> 02:46:00,080
- You know why?
- This'll be good.

2072
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:03,480
Because you're weak.

2073
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,400
- Because you're a drunk.
- Are you done?

2074
02:46:09,080 --> 02:46:12,200
- Yes, sir.
- You're returned to flight status.

2075
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:16,800
Let's see how long that lasts.

2076
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:24,280
- Come in.

2077
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:41,400
Firstly, I suppose that I should
thank you for deciding to bring us--

2078
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:44,280
Listen, you were right,
I was wrong.

2079
02:46:44,400 --> 02:46:46,280
Let's just leave it at that.

2080
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:50,800
All right.

2081
02:46:56,680 --> 02:46:59,080
There's no Earth.

2082
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:01,280
You made it all up.

2083
02:47:03,080 --> 02:47:07,280
President Adar and I once talked
about the legends surrounding Earth.

2084
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:10,680
He knew nothing about
a secret location regarding Earth.

2085
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:12,680
And if the president
knew nothing about it...

2086
02:47:12,800 --> 02:47:15,400
what are the chances
that you do?

2087
02:47:17,880 --> 02:47:21,480
You're right.
There's no Earth.

2088
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,760
It's all a legend.

2089
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:29,680
Then why?

2090
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:36,080
Because it's not enough to just live.

2091
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:38,480
You have to have something to live for.

2092
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:40,480
Let it be Earth.

2093
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:56,800
They'll never forgive you.

2094
02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:59,280
Maybe.

2095
02:47:59,400 --> 02:48:02,000
But in the meantime...

2096
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:06,080
I've given all of us
a fighting chance to survive.

2097
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:09,280
And isn't that what you said
was the most important thing...

2098
02:48:09,400 --> 02:48:11,400
survival of the human race?

2099
02:48:11,480 --> 02:48:15,200
- Who else knows?
- Not a soul.

2100
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:19,680
All right.

2101
02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:21,680
I'll keep your secret.

2102
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:23,680
But I want something in return.

2103
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:25,880
I'm listening.

2104
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,800
If this civilization is going to function...

2105
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:31,480
it's going to need a government...

2106
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:35,000
a civilian government
run by the president of the colonies.

2107
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:44,880
So you'll be in charge of the fleet...

2108
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:48,200
but military decisions stay with me.

2109
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:50,280
Yes.

2110
02:48:50,400 --> 02:48:53,800
Then I'll think about it,
Madam President.

2111
02:48:59,080 --> 02:49:01,400
I guess I'm gonna start reprogramming.

2112
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:11,480
Your escape is a temporary one at best.

2113
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:13,800
We will find you.

2114
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:17,280
Yeah, you can try.
It's a big universe.

2115
02:49:17,400 --> 02:49:19,480
You haven't addressed
the real problem, of course.

2116
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:22,880
Yes, yes. There may be Cylon agents...

2117
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:26,280
living among us,
waiting to strike at any moment.

2118
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:29,200
Some may not even know
they're Cylons at all.

2119
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:32,680
They could be sleeper agents programmed
to perfectly impersonate human beings...

2120
02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:34,680
until activation.

2121
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:38,200
If there are Cylons aboard this ship,
we'll find them.

2122
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:42,600
We? You're not on their side, Gaius.

2123
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:50,480
I am not on anybody's side.

2124
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:34,360
And tomorrow I'll begin a formal
combat patrol around the fleet.

2125
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:36,600
Good. Have a good night.

2126
02:50:42,680 --> 02:50:46,080
- I just--
- Why don't we...

2127
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:48,480
save this for another time, son?

2128
02:51:09,280 --> 02:51:11,480
Dualla--

2129
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:16,000
Ta-da!

2130
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:18,080
- Nice to be small.
- There you go, Chief.

2131
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:20,080
Nice to be small.

2132
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:49,680
Goodnight, Commander.

2133
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:52,080
Goodnight, Captain.

2134
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:33,680
We have to get out of this storm.

2135
02:53:33,800 --> 02:53:36,600
The radiation affects our silica relays.

2136
02:53:36,680 --> 02:53:38,600
- Where did they go?
- I don't know.

2137
02:53:38,680 --> 02:53:41,800
- They were prepared for a big jump.
- We can't let them go.

2138
02:53:41,880 --> 02:53:44,800
Hmm. Unfortunately I agree.

2139
02:53:44,880 --> 02:53:48,080
If we do, they'll return one day
and seek revenge.

2140
02:53:48,200 --> 02:53:50,400
- It's in their nature.
- We have no choice.

2141
02:53:50,480 --> 02:53:53,200
It may take several decades
to track them down.

2142
02:53:57,400 --> 02:53:59,800
Don't worry.
We'll find them.

2143
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,880
By your command.
