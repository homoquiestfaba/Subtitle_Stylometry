00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,851
WELL, I'D LIKE YOU
TO GIVE HIM

178
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,554
A COMPLETE TOUR
OF THE STUDIOS.

179
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,357
OKAY, TIME TO ANSWER
SOME OF OUR PHONE LINES.

180
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,426
THAT IS THE LAST THING
I EXPECTED.

181
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,962
THEY FIRED EVERYBODY.
JUST LIKE THAT.

182
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:21,066
I'LL NEVER GET A DJ SLOT NOW,
NOT EVEN AS A SUBSTITUTE.

183
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,435
YOU REALLY SOUND SEXY,
YOU KNOW THAT?

184
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,805
Woman: Well, I've been told
my voice --

185
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,140
YOU'RE GETTING ME HORNY HERE
JUST LISTENING TO YOU.

186
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,943
SO THIS IS GOING TO BE
OUR NEW FORMAT.

187
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,244
YEAH.

188
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,281
ARE YOU WEARING
ANY CLOTHES RIGHT NOW?

189
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,916
No. Just some panties.

190
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,918
OOH. LITTLE ONES, RIGHT?

191
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,553
Black bikini.

192
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,720
MM-HMM.

193
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,256
YOU WANT TO HAVE
SOME FUN WITH ME?

194
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,357
Yeah.

195
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,560
GOOD. TAKE THEM OFF.

196
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,663
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

197
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,932
Okay, it's off.

198
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,366
ARE YOU NAKED?

199
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,035
Yes, totally.

200
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,136
REALLY, REALLY?

201
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,972
Yeah. Let me close
the shades here.

202
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,907
GREAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

203
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,176
WE'VE GOT A NAKED WOMAN
ON THE LINE.

204
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,912
A TOTALLY NAKED WOMAN!
ON OUR RADIO STATION!

205
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,481
OKAY, NOW THAT
I'VE GOT YOU HERE,

206
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,817
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE?

207
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,987
FOR YOU TO TELL ME

208
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:19,792
YOUR PET NAME
FOR A GUY'S...MMM...PENIS.

209
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,026
HA HA HA HA.

210
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,895
HE DID NOT
JUST SAY THAT.

211
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:23,863
HE DID.

212
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,864
NO, HE DIDN'T.

213
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,532
What do you mean?

214
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,201
I MEAN LIKE, DICK.

215
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,071
SCHLONG, SALAMI, PECKER.

216
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,973
Tell you what I call it?

217
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,008
SURE.
ARE YOU INTO IT?

218
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,209
NO...NO.

219
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,179
YOU CANNOT BE THAT STUPID.

220
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,014
Karlin: HELLO?

221
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,583
How about six tickets?

222
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,318
SURE, HONEY.
TELL YOU WHAT.

223
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,387
USE THE WORD
IN A SENTENCE.

224
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,622
SOMETHING LIKE,

225
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:54,226
"I'D LIKE TO SEE
YOUR BIG, LONG SCHLONG."

226
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,595
What? I don't know.

227
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,897
AHH, COME ON, KAREN.

228
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,898
IT'S JUST FOR FUN.

229
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,999
SHE'S GOING TO DO IT.

230
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,301
THINK OF ALL THE GUYS
YOU'LL BE TURNING ON.

231
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,470
BETTER YET,
THINK OF THOSE SIX TICKETS.

232
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,738
SHE'S GOING TO DO IT.

233
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,773
SEXY NOW.

234
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,810
I really want to see
your big, fat, juicy love toy.

235
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,913
OH, MY GOD!

236
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,016
THIS IS WAY BETTER
THAN WALDO. WHOO!

237
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,385
[ Giggling ]

238
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:24,423
KAREN, YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
THE MOST ENORMOUS WOODY.

239
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,062
HEY, JON PRICE.

240
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,865
I JUST HEARD
YOUR AUDITION TAPE.

241
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,400
MAN, IT'S GREAT.

242
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,136
THE AUDITION TAPE I GAVE LES
BEFORE HE GOT CANNED?

243
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,637
I TOLD HARRIS
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING

244
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,072
ABOUT EVERYBODY
HERE AT THE STATION,

245
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,207
SO HE GOES THROUGH HIS SHIT,
HE COMES UP WITH YOUR TAPE.

246
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,542
I REALLY LIKED IT.

247
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,144
THANKS A LOT.

248
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,012
HOW COME NOBODY
TOLD ME ABOUT YOU?

249
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,548
YOU GOT A FANTASTIC VOICE,
YOU'RE FUNNY AS HELL.

250
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,917
THIS OUGHT TO BE GETTING
YOU YOUR OWN SHOW.

251
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,218
I'M TRYING.

252
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,688
LET'S GO TALK ABOUT IT.
I GOT SOME IDEAS.

253
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,690
LET'S GO HAVE A DRINK.

254
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,858
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY SHOW?

255
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,628
IS THIS THE STUFF YOU PLAN
ON DOING ALL THE TIME?

256
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,629
YEP.

257
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,797
YOU WANT MY HONEST OPINION?

258
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,931
SURE.

259
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,933
YOU'RE LIKE A HORNY
HIGH SCHOOL KID.

260
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,768
BUT YOU LAUGHED.
I SAW YOU.

261
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:10,769
VODKA TONIC.

262
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,838
GIVE ME
A CLUB SODA, PLEASE.

263
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,040
HE'LL HAVE
A VODKA TONIC, TOO.

264
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,309
COME ON, JON.
LIVE A LITTLE.

265
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,911
VODKA TONIC.

266
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,045
SEE, JON,

267
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,614
YOU GOT TO SHOCK
RADIO LISTENERS

268
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,616
OUT OF THEIR MUNDANE,
ORDINARY LIVES.

269
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,418
GIVE THEM SOMETHING
TO TALK ABOUT

270
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,821
AROUND THAT COFFEE MACHINE
IN THE MORNING.

271
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,990
YEAH, BUT TALKING
ABOUT GETTING A WOODY...

272
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,859
SURE, IT'S STUPID,
BUT IT'S A MEANS TO AN END.

273
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,627
WE'LL GET
MORE SOPHISTICATED.

274
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:36,662
YOU'LL SEE.

275
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,796
SALUD.

276
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,270
SO, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

277
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,073
MY PLANS.
YEAH, RIGHT.

278
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,142
I WANT MY OWN SHOW.

279
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,845
BUT FAT CHANCE
OF THAT HAPPENING NOW.

280
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,013
HOW BAD DO YOU WANT IT?

281
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,015
BAD. I'D GIVE
ALMOST ANYTHING FOR IT.

282
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,783
A MAN WHO KNOWS
WHAT HE WANTS.

283
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,986
I'VE TRIED ALMOST EVERYTHING
AT THAT STATION.

284
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,554
I GUESS I SHOULD
FACE REALITY.

285
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,857
THERE'S 1,000 OTHER GUYS
OUT THERE READY TO KILL

286
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,259
FOR A SPOT ON THE RADIO.
WHAT CHANCE DO I HAVE?

287
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,195
YOU JUST WANT A CHANCE
TO PROVE YOURSELF, RIGHT?

288
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,298
YEAH.

289
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,200
ALL RIGHT.

290
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,635
I GOT AN IDEA.

291
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,371
HOW ABOUT YOU CO-DJ
A SHOW OR TWO WITH ME?

292
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,708
WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT,
SEE HOW IT GOES.

293
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,709
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

294
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,677
NO. HARRIS OWES ME
SOME FAVORS.

295
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,980
YOU'RE NOT JOKING?

296
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,681
JESUS, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

297
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,950
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

298
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,952
I'M A MAN
WHO BELIEVES IN IMPULSE.

299
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,721
AND I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT YOU.

300
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,791
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE,
KARLIN, I'M CONFUSED.

301
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,559
WHY DO YOU NEED MY HELP?

302
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,995
JON, THE SHOW
COULD BE EVEN FUNNIER

303
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,464
IF I HAVE SOMEONE
TO PLAY OFF OF,

304
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,634
AND YOU'VE GOT
A GREAT AUDITION TAPE HERE.

305
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,702
WELL, THANKS.

306
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,504
I GOT BIG THINGS PLANNED, JON,

307
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,441
AND I NEED ONE MORE INGREDIENT
TO MAKE THIS SHOW COOK.

308
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,708
AND MAYBE YOU'RE IT.

309
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,078
THIS SOUNDS TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.

310
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,512
IT IS TRUE.

311
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,216
YOU COULD BE EXACTLY
WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

312
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,484
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

313
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,153
WE GIVE IT A SHOT TOMORROW,
SEE HOW IT GOES.

314
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,390
WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN?
WE'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME.

315
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,458
ABSOLUTELY.

316
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,760
I'M NOT TURNING DOWN
A CHANCE LIKE THIS.

317
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,894
YOU CRAZY?

318
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,065
YOU GOT ME.

319
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:24,303
YOU'RE LISTENING
TO JON PRICE.

320
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,739
HI. YOU'RE ON THE AIR
WITH JON PRICE

321
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,310
AND KARLIN PICKETT.

322
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,214
JON PRICE.
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.

323
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,282
HONEY, TURN OFF THE TV.

324
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,532
I'M TELLING YOU, LADY,
I'VE GOT THREE TESTICLES.

325
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,568
A UROLOGIST DISCOVERED IT
LAST YEAR DURING AN EXAM,

326
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,936
RIGHT, JON?

327
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,805
YEAH, SURE.

328
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,807
SEE? HE BELIEVES ME, LADY.

329
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,709
YOU REALLY GOT
THREE OF THEM?

330
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,944
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T...
I DON'T KNOW...

331
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,247
COUNT ONE OF THEM TWICE
OR ANYTHING?

332
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,782
JON, YOU WANT TO COUNT
FOR YOURSELF?

333
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,918
NO, NO, NO. I'LL TAKE
YOUR WORD FOR IT.

334
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,654
YOU'VE GOT THREE TESTICLES.

335
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,123
Woman: Young man,
don't say that word again.

336
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,026
Certain words should not
be said on public airwaves.

337
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,661
LADY, CHILL OUT.

338
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,898
ALL THESE WORDS
ARE MEDICAL TERMS.

339
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,201
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH TALKING ABOUT TESTICLES.

340
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,436
IS THAT
SUCH A BAD THING, JON?

341
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,272
OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S FINE.

342
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,141
IT'S MEDICALLY
AND POLITICALLY CORRECT.

343
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:39,912
AT LEAST I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT DICKWEED OR TITTIES.

344
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,013
Oh, dear God.

345
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,315
AT LEAST I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT MASTURBATION

346
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,616
ON THE AIR, EITHER.

347
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,586
ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE APROPOS
FOR THE SUBJECT AT HAND.

348
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,455
You two better not
talk about that on the air.

349
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,291
AND WHY NOT?

350
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,760

00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,127
THE BLONDE IN THE BLACK.

530
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,030
COME ON, KARLIN.

531
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,201
LET'S SAY THAT SHARON
WOULD NEVER FIND OUT.

532
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,802
WHAT'S THE POINT?

533
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,538
I KNOW YOU GET
THE URGE, JON.

534
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,975
EVERY GUY DOES.
AT LEAST I ADMIT IT.

535
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,945
WE'D ALL LOVE TO HAVE
EVERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WE SEE.

536
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,913
AM I RIGHT?

537
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,415
AND YOU CAN, JON.

538
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,885
BECAUSE OF ME, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE FAMOUS.

539
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,455
BECAUSE OF ME, YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE MONEY.

540
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:43,294
NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH HER

541
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:47,399
IF SHE WAS LYING NAKED
ON YOUR BED?

542
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,034
MMM.

543
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,536
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH HER, JON?

544
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,506
OKAY, OKAY.
I'M NOT A SAINT.

545
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,374
HONESTY, JON.
THANK YOU.

546
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,678
WE'D ALL LOVE TO HAVE
A WOMAN GUYS GO CRAZY OVER,

547
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,413
A CAR THAT TURNS HEADS.

548
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,782
EVERYBODY HAS FANTASIZED
ABOUT BEING FAMOUS.

549
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:07,786
PEOPLE RECOGNIZING YOU,
BEGGING YOU FOR YOUR AUTOGRAPH.

550
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:12,057
BUT MOST OF ALL, JON,
YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE POWER.

551
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,793
REAL POWER.

552
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,163
POWER TO DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

553
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,431
YEAH.

554
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,499
SEE? I SPEAK THE TRUTH.

555
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,635
I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT.

556
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,970
THAT'S WHY THE SHOW WORKS.

557
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,040
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.
THAT'S WHY WE WORK.

558
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,044
IF YOU STICK WITH ME,
YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE ROOF.

559
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,714
WE'LL GO THROUGH
THE STRATOSPHERE.

560
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,250
BUT YOU GOT TO STICK WITH ME
THROUGH THICK AND THIN.

561
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,653
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

562
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,726
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME
WILD TIMES UP AHEAD, JON.

563
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,261
AND I NEED TO KNOW
I CAN COUNT ON YOU.

564
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,532
CAN I COUNT ON YOU, JON?

565
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,371
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

566
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,808
GOOD.

567
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,377
ONE MORE.

568
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,847
HEY, WHEN ARE WE
GOING TO GET

569
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,116
TO GO ON THE AIR
WITH YOU?

570
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,552
DENISE. CYNTHIA.
SO NICE TO SEE YOU LADIES.

571
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,588
IF I DIDN'T KNOW
ANY BETTER,

572
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,991
I'D THINK THAT YOU WERE
PUTTING US ON THE OTHER NIGHT

573
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,760
ABOUT BEING ON YOUR SHOW.

574
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,161
PUTTING YOU ON?

575
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,030
MR. PRICE, WILL YOU TELL
THESE LOVELY LADIES

576
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,700
THAT I WAS JUST
TALKING ABOUT THEM?

577
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,035
YEAH. HE SURE WAS.

578
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,105
HEY.

579
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,875
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

580
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,877
ARE YOU JON PRICE?

581
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,044
YEAH.

582
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,247
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE THE SAME PERSON

583
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,516
I LISTEN TO ON THE RADIO
EVERY NIGHT.

584
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,885
WHY? WHAT DID YOU
EXPECT ME TO BE LIKE?

585
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,988
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE --
I DON'T KNOW.

586
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,723
OLDER.

587
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,392
NOT SO ATTRACTIVE.

588
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,727
IT'S WEIRD.

589
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:59,931
I LISTEN TO YOUR SHOW
EVERY NIGHT, AND YOUR VOICE --

590
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:03,802
I KNOW THAT THIS
IS GOING TO SOUND STRANGE,

591
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,005
BUT...IT'S BECOMING
SO FAMILIAR TO ME.

592
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,140
SO COMFORTABLE.

593
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,508
REALLY?

594
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,211
I FEEL LIKE YOUR A FRIEND
WHO'S HOME WITH ME EVERY NIGHT,

595
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,413
KEEPING ME COMPANY.

596
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:20,351
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK
WITH ME TO MY PLACE TONIGHT

597
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,353
AND HAVE SOME WINE?

598
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,823
YOU CAN TELL ME
HOW YOU COME UP WITH

599
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,625
ALL THOSE CRAZY THINGS
YOU DO ON THE AIR.

600
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,229
MAYBE YOU CAN EVEN
TUCK ME INTO BED.

601
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:41,639
AHH, MAN.

602
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,842
I'M KIND OF SEEING
SOMEONE RIGHT NOW.

603
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,045
COME ON. IT'S JUST
A GLASS OF WINE.

604
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,980
ALL WE'LL DO IS TALK.

605
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,451
LOOK, CYNTHIA, I CAN'T.

606
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,588
I'M SORRY,
BUT-BUT I CAN'T.

607
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,292
HERE'S MY NUMBER.

608
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:05,697
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME
WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

609
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,011
OH...GOD.

HELLO?

614
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,860
Jon. Jon,
did I wake you?

615
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,996
KARLIN,
ARE YOU OKAY?

616
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,031
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

617
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,200
CAN YOU COME OVER?

618
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,702
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

619
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,571
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

620
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,840
JUST COME OVER,
ALL RIGHT?

621
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,451
HELLO?

622
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,254

623
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,023
Karlin:
JON, COME ON IN.

624
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,462
THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL.

625
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,399
HEY, JON,
THANKS FOR COMING.

626
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,934
YOU WANT A DRINK?

627
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,136
SURE YOU DO.
COME ON.

628
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:24,075
I GOT SOME GREAT
RED WINE HERE.

629
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,244
SO, YOU EVER
MAKE IT WITH CYNTHIA?

630
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:30,548
HEY, I'M LIVING
WITH SHARON.

631
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,517
SHE WAS SO INTO YOU.

632
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:36,387
AND YOU CAN HAVE ANY
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOU WANT, JON.

633
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,790
YOU'RE BECOMING A CELEBRITY.

634
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,427
YEAH.

635
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,430
SO, WHAT DID YOU
CALL ME HERE FOR?

636
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:49,300
WELL, YOU KNOW I SAID
ABOUT SOME WILD TIMES UP AHEAD?

637
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,602
WELL, IT CAME TO ME
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO

638
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,770
WHAT WE GOT TO DO.

639
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,238
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

640
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,707
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SHOW.

641
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,809
WE GOT TO BECOME
MORE OUTRAGEOUS, JON,

642
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,311
OTHERWISE, WE'RE GOING
TO LOSE OUR NUMBERS.

643
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,747
MORE OUTRAGEOUS.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE?

644
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:05,883
DRINK UP.

645
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,819
WE'RE GOING TO GO
FOR A RIDE.

646
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,023
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

647
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,058
WHAT ARE THOSE?

648
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,361
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE YELLOW.

649
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,795
COME ON.

00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,603
GRAB THAT DOOR FOR ME,

SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE BLUE ONE?

00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,191

00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,235
WE ARE RIGHT ON THE VERGE
OF GETTING WHAT WE WANTED.

662
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,370
I LEARNED A LOT
IN PHOENIX, JON,

663
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,973
AND I'M GOING TO APPLY IT
ALL RIGHT HERE.

664
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,976
WHY DID YOU LEAVE PHOENIX?
YOU WERE DOING WELL THERE.

665
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,412
I HAD OUTGROWN PHOENIX, JON.

666
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,381
JUST LIKE WE'RE GOING
TO OUTGROW LOS ANGELES.

667
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,316
OUTGROW LOS ANGELES?

668
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:15,586
I'M STARTING TO GET OFFERS
TO SYNDICATE NATIONWIDE.

669
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,388
IF OUR NUMBERS KEEP GROWING,

670
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,826
I'LL BE TAKING OUR SHOW INTO
50 CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

671
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,128
WE ARE ENTERING A NEW AGE.

672
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,531
OLD TABOOS ARE FALLING AWAY.

673
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,667
PEOPLE ARE NOT AS AFRAID
TO TAP INTO

674
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,769
THE DARK SIDE
OF THEMSELVES.

675
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:32,804
IN FACT,

676
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:36,808
THEY ARE FASCINATED
BY DEPRAVITY.

677
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,410
I WANT TO DO
A NEW SEGMENT,

678
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,146
AND CALL IT
"MY BEST CRIME."

679
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,149
PEOPLE CALL US UP
ANONYMOUSLY,

680
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,686
AND THEY TALK ABOUT
A CRIME THEY'VE COMMITTED --

681
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,756
AND WE'RE NOT TALKING
SHOPLIFTING HERE.

682
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,225
I MEAN RAPE, INCEST, MURDER.

683
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,060
ISN'T THAT
A LITTLE HARDCORE?

684
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,096
THE ABSOLUTE CUTTING EDGE.

685
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,165
SURE, WE'LL GET
A LOT OF CRANK CALLS,

686
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,502
BUT WE'LL ALSO GET
A LOT OF REAL CALLS.

687
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:08,106
JON, THERE'S A WHOLE
CITY OF PERVERSION DOWN THERE,

688
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,841
AND WE CAN PLUG INTO IT,

689
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,110
USE OUR 55,000 WATTS
OF POWER

690
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,946
TO SPREAD IT
TO EVERY SINGLE CORNER.

691
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,482
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

692
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,383
IT SOUNDS
WAY OVER THE EDGE.

693
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,786
YOU GOT TO ADMIT
IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

694
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,154
IT'LL BE FASCINATING.

695
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,690
WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE
GLUED TO THEIR RADIOS.

696
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,926
WE'LL HAVE THEM ASKING,
WHO'S GOING TO CALL TONIGHT?

697
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,996

WILL I HEAR THIS EVENING?

00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,541
YOU'RE AMAZING.

703
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,177
SOMETIMES.

704
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,079
WHAT DO YOU SAY, JON?

705
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,916
YEAH. HELL, YEAH.
LET'S DO IT.

706
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,452
Man: So, I stole this car
when I was in 11th grade.

707
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,955
And me and a couple of friends
went for a ride to Vegas.

708
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,625
FOLKS, IS THIS
THE BEST WE CAN DO?

709
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,161
Well, hey, the car
was a brand-new Cadillac.

710
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,495
We drove all night --

711
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,564
WHAT A LOSER.
STEALS A CAR.

712
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,633
THAT'S HIS CRIME?
BIG DEAL.

713
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,769
IT HAPPENS 1,000 TIMES A WEEK
IN THIS CITY.

714
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,105
FOLKS, THIS IS
AN OPPORTUNITY

715
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,408
TO GET SOMETHING
REALLY BIG OFF YOUR CHEST.

716
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:20,645
OKAY, I WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT

717
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,680
THE NASTIEST CRIMES
YOU'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH.

718
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,148
GET DOWN AND DIRTY, PEOPLE.

719
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,751
WE'VE ALL DONE SOMETHING
WE'VE REGRETTED,

720
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,020
EVEN YOURS TRULY,
KARLIN PICKETT.

721
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,656
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CONFESSION
ACTUALLY DOES FOR THE SOUL,

722
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,125
BUT IT MAKES
FOR GOOD ENTERTAINMENT,

723
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,593
SO CALL ME.

724
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,796
I AM WAITING ANXIOUSLY
TO HEAR YOUR DARKEST SECRET.

725
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,165
OUR NEXT CALLER
ON DIRECT LINE TWO.

726
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,501
HELLO, CAN YOU PLEASE
TELL US YOUR NAME?

727
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,003
Uh...I'd really
rather not say.

728
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,738
GUY WON'T TELL US
HIS NAME.

729
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:50,174
OKAY, THIS MUST BE GOOD.

730
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,543
OKAY,
WHAT'S YOUR BEST CRIME?

731
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,613
HELLO?

732
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:56,747
Yeah, hi.

733
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,749
SPEAK UP.
HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD CRIME?

734
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,718
Well, this is a little hard.

735
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,354
I heard you guys tonight,
and um...

736
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:07,725
well, I really feel like I need
to tell someone about this.

737
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,494
I kind of met this girl
one night.

738
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,129
She was really cute.

739
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,332
This is a little hard
for me.

740
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,100
She got me really pissed.

741
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,402
I mean, for her,
it was just a one-nighter.

742
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,338
Like she just wanted
to screw me.

743
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,707
So, I think I got
a little bit angry,

744
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,443
and I lost control.

745
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,745
SO YOU BEAT HER UP?

746
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,081
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

747
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,183
BUT YOU SOUND
LIKE A NICE GUY.

748
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,051
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, RIGHT?

749
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,519
No, I didn't beat her.

750
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,389
It actually went
a little further than that.

751
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,991
I kind of hurt her bad.

752
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,126
HOW BAD?

753
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,762
I'm not sure
she made it through, actually.

754
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,633
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU KILLED HER?

755
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,603
HELLO?

756
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,210
SIR, NO JOKES NOW.

757
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,747
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU KILLED HER?

758
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,882
Yeah. I know I did.

759
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,888
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU KILLED THIS WOMAN?

760
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,556
Yes.

761
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,092
We were making love
in an abandoned warehouse,

762
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,460
and she...

763
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,029
she fell.

764
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,197
Actually, I kind of
picked her up

765
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,199
and threw her
over the side.

766
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,770
The cops still don't know
that I'm the one who killed her.

767
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,972
I just needed
to talk about this.

768
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,373
Get it off my chest.

769
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,542
Because I don't know.

770
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,477
I might do it again.

771
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,812
And if I do,

772
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,914
I'll call in
and tell you about it.

773
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,316
I really love your show.

774
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,117
It's all
that keeps me going.

775
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,053
I think I better
get off now.

776
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,322
UH, SIR,
PLEASE STAY ON THE LINE.

777
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,323
I'll call back again.

778
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,324
DON'T HANG UP.

779
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,125
HELLO?

780
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,827
WE LOSE HIM?

781
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,396
[ BEEP ]

782
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,599
WHOA.

783
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,670
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE A FEW
DEEP BREATHS, TAKE A BREAK.

784
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,572
LISTENING TO
"THE KARLIN PICKETT SHOW,"

785
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,474
POWER 98.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

786
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,178
OH...

787
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,315
Man: IT'S THE CRAZIEST
CAR RADIO SALE...

788
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,951
A MURDERER
ACTUALLY CALLED IN.

789
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,153
I NEVER REALLY BELIEVED
IT WOULD HAPPEN.

790
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,955
TO THINK HE MIGHT
CALL IN AGAIN.

791
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,623
WE'RE INTO
SOME WEIRDNESS NOW.

792
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,192
I GOT TO PEE.

793
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,568
HEY, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE CALLER WAS FOR REAL?

794
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,970
THE GUY THAT CALLED?

795
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,773
HE DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

796
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,376
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?

797
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,979
HEY...

798
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:45,082
WAIT A MINUTE, KARLIN.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

799
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:49,353
HE WAS A FRIEND OF MINE.
I HAD HIM CALL.

800
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,322
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

801
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,757
NO, I'M NOT.

802
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,392
IT WAS A FAKE CALLER?

803
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,394
YEP.

804
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,562
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

805
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,231
I CAN'T GO ALONG
WITH THIS.

806
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,767
SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU
BECOME MR. ETHICS?

807
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:06,170
HEY, MAN, WE GOT TO TELL
OUR AUDIENCE ABOUT THE CALLER.

808
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,338
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?

809
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,273
IF THE FCC FINDS OUT --

810
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,641
THE FCC, MY ASS.

811
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,077
LOOK, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH WHAT WE DID.

812
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,545
NOBODY WAS HURT BY IT.

813
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,415
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS,
JON. THE SHOW IS TOO HOT.

814
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,251
YOU FOUL IT UP
AND PEOPLE COULD BE LEAD

815
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,954
TO BELIEVE THIS FAKE CALLER
WAS ALL YOUR IDEA.

816
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:27,291
TRY GETTING BACK
ON THE AIR AFTER THAT.

817
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,628
YEAH, I GET THE PICTURE.

818
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,062
GOOD.

819
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,097
HEY.

820
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,732
WHAT?

821
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,767
I'LL GO ALONG WITH IT
FOR NOW,

822
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,136
BUT AFTER THIS,
I WANT MY OWN SHOW.

823
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,072
GETTING PRETTY COCKY,
AREN'T YOU, JON?

824
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,208
WHO WERE YOU
BEFORE I PUT YOU ON THE AIR?

825
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:48,479
YOU WANT ME TO GO ALONG
WITH THE PRANK CALLER,

826
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,015
YOU GET ME MY OWN SHOW.
THAT'S THE BARGAIN.

827
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,887
THAT'S THE BARGAIN?

828
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,255
YEAH.

829
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,827
ALL RIGHT.

830
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,895
I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR OWN SHOW.

831
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,565
I'LL MAKE IT A CONDITION
OF MY RENEWAL.

832
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,934
BUT YOU BETTER
WORK WITH ME ON THIS.

833
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,101
DON'T FUCK IT UP.

834
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,536
ALL RIGHT?

835
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,676
ALL RIGHT.

836
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,583
OH, YOU'RE STILL UP?

837
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,151
HI.

838
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,155
I GOT SOME GREAT NEWS.

839
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,156
WHAT?

840
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,625
I'M GETTING MY OWN SHOW.

841
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,027
THE JON PRICE SHOW
WILL BE ON IN A MONTH.

842
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,396
OH, MY GOD. THAT'S GREAT.

843
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,632
IT'S HAPPENING SO FAST.

844
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,167
I CAN DO MY STUFF,

845
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,169
NOT THIS TRASH
KARLIN HAS ME DOING.

846
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,872
WHAT WAS GOING ON
WITH THE SHOW TONIGHT?

847
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,473
THAT WAS JUST A STUNT.

848
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:52,343
THE GUY WHO CALLED,
HE NEVER KILLED ANYBODY.

849
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,712
HE'S JUST SOME FRIEND
OF KARLIN'S.

850
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,347
WAIT A MINUTE.

851
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,382
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU GUYS PLANNED THIS?

852
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,050
NO, NOT ME. KARLIN.

853
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,553
THIS WAS KARLIN'S IDEA?

854
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,555
WHY DID YOU LET HIM
MANIPULATE YOU

855
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,056
INTO GOING ALONG WITH IT?

856
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,358
I WASN'T MANIPULATED.

857
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,527
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT
UNTIL LATER.

858
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,762
IS THERE ANY ASPIRIN
IN THIS HOUSE?

859
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,764
SO KARLIN IS
LYING TO THE AUDIENCE,

860
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,666
AND YOU'RE GOING
ALONG WITH IT.

861
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,269
YOU THINK I LIKE
WHAT HE'S DOING? I DON'T.

862
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,705
BUT WHAT I LIKE EVEN LESS IS
BEING SOME ANONYMOUS ENGINEER,

863
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,175
BEING BEHIND IN CAR PAYMENTS,
THE RENT, MY STUDENT LOANS.

864
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,877
YOU KNOW WHAT, JON?
WE GOT BY.

865
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,146
WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO GET BY ANYMORE,

866
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,015
YOU KNOW?

867
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,516
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

868
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,919
A FAKE MURDERER
IS CALLING THE SHOW.

869
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,821
IT'S NOT HURTING ANYBODY.
I CAN LIVE WITH IT,

870
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,658
ESPECIALLY IF KARLIN
GETS ME MY OWN SHOW.

871
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,459
JESUS. LISTEN TO YOU.

872
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,627
YEAH.

873
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:46,931
LISTEN TO ME, SHARON.

874
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,167
I'M LEARNING I GOT TO DO
WHAT I GOT TO DO

875
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,468
TO GET WHAT I WANT.

876
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,070
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE HAPPY

877
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,972
WITH WHAT YOU SEE
IN FRONT OF YOU.

878
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,374
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I SEE?

879
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:00,210
I SEE A GUY
WITH A HIT RADIO SHOW.

880
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,813
I SEE SUCCESS.

881
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,248
Harris:
HELLO, EVERYBODY.

882
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,616
COULD I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION?

883
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,151
Man: SHH!

884
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:11,021
YEAH, EVERYBODY.
PLEASE, EVERYBODY.

885
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:14,692
THIS HAS BEEN
AN AMAZING COUPLE WEEKS

886
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,527
SINCE WE STARTED.

887
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,763
I THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW
EXTREMELY UNUSUAL IT IS

888
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,066
FOR A LATE AFTERNOON
DRIVE-TIME SHOW

889
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,535
TO TURN ANY STATION AROUND,
BUT, UH...

890
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,570
I JUST RECEIVED
THE OVERNIGHTS,

891
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,138
AND, UH...

892
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:32,610
I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE
THAT THE "KARLIN PICKETT SHOW"

893
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,579
HERE ON KRZY POWER 98...

894
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,083
HAS JUST RECEIVED
A 37 LAST NIGHT!

895
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,384
[ APPLAUSE ]

896
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,354
HIS HIGHEST RATING EVER
FOR A SINGLE SHOW!

897
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,360
WHAT DID I TELL YOU,
LITTLE BROTHER?

898
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,427
WE ARE HOT.

899
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,795
YEAH. THANKS TO YOU.

900
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,707
HARRIS.

901
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,844
THERE ARE MY TWO
SPECIAL BOYS.

902
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,178
I KNEW WHEN I SIGNED YOU

903
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,948
GREAT THINGS WERE GOING
TO HAPPEN AT THIS STATION.

904
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,883
WHAT'S WITH THE COPS?

905
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,386
IT'S STANDARD PROCEDURE.
ABOUT THE GUY WHO CALLED.

906
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,454
THE GUY WHO SAID
HE KILLED SOMEONE?

907
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,657
YEAH.

908
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,259
YOU KNOW, WE'RE MAKING A COPY
FOR THEM OF LAST NIGHT'S SHOW.

909
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,194
IT WAS A GREAT THING
THIS GUY CALLED.

910
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,130
IT GAVE THE SHOW A BOOST.

911
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,632
IF HE CALLS BACK,
WE COULD DOUBLE OUR RATINGS.

912
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,200
YEAH.

913
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,069
TO CONSOLIDATE OUR GAINS.

914
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,872
YOU KNOW HOW THESE THINGS
TEND TO ERODE.

915
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,640
OH, IT'S AMAZING.

916
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,876
IN THE 20 YEARS
I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS,

917
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:41,645
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
BETTER DEMOS DELIVERED FASTER.

918
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,982
EVERYBODY IN THIS TOWN
WITH A RADIO

919
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,717
WAS LISTENING LAST NIGHT.

920
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,919
CONGRATULATIONS, BOYS.

921
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,921
I'M GOING TO CALL UP
BUSINESS AFFAIRS

922
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,724
AND HAVE THEM STRIKE UP
YOUR NEW CONTRACTS RIGHT NOW.

923
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,460
HARRIS, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO WAIT ON THAT.

924
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,028
WHAT?

925
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,664
WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE BUMP
IN THE OLD ROAD.

926
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:01,732
TELL HIM, JON.

927
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,570
HARRIS, I WANT
MY OWN SHOW.

928
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,172
WHAT?

929
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,574
AND WE'RE NOT TALKING
GRAVEYARD SHIFT, EITHER.

930
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,110
I WANT HIM AS LEAD-IN
TO MY SHOW,

931
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,979
PLUS I WANT HIM
WITH ME FOR AN HOUR.

932
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,757
YOU MEAN BUMPING DeSANTOS?

933
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,359
NO BIG LOSS.

934
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:35,099
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I'M PAYING DeSANTOS?

935
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,601
$245,000.

936
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:40,037
DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO FLUSH
THAT MONEY DOWN THE TOILET?

937
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:43,774
WE'RE GETTING OFFERS,
HARRIS -- BIG OFFERS.

938
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,411
KROV, KHOK,
UNITED SYNDICATION.

939
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,680
THIS IS NOT
AN OPTION, HARRIS.

940
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,448
THIS A DEAL-BREAKER.

941
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,087
YOU TWO ARE LITTLE SHITS.

942
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:02,326
YEAH. BUT AT LEAST WE'RE
STILL YOUR LITTLE SHITS.

943
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,397
LOOK AT THAT.

944
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,399
THAT'S US.

945
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,136
AND TOMORROW THERE
WILL BE 15 MORE OF THOSE

946
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,303
AROUND THE CITY.

947
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,739
YEAH,
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

948
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:16,974
PRETTY GOOD?

949
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,810
TOMORROW YOU'RE GOING TO
BE SIGNING A CONTRACT

950
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,145
FOR YOUR OWN SHOW,

951
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,148
MAKING 10 TIMES THE AMOUNT
OF MONEY YOU HAVE EVER MADE,

952
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,316
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD?

953
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:27,651
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S GREAT.

954
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,052
IT'S...

955
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,220
IT'S FANTASTIC.

956
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,222
DID I KEEP MY PROMISE
TO YOU?

957
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,590
DID I GET YOU THERE?

958
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,592
YOU DID,
BUT WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT

959
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,928
MY STAYING ON YOUR SHOW
FOR AN HOUR?

960
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:40,430
I TOLD YOU I WANTED
TO BE ON MY OWN.

961
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,134
JON, I NEED YOU ON MY SHOW
JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

962
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,003
THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT.

963
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:49,006
I THINK I'M MISSING SOMETHING
HERE, LIKE A LITTLE GRATITUDE.

964
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:52,509
LOOK, I WANT TO RIDE THIS BABY
JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER

965
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,179
AND MAKE SURE THE SHOW'S
IN A SOLID POSITION.

966
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,181
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

967
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,783
ALL RIGHT.
THEN I'M ON MY OWN?

968
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,318
YES, JON.

969
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,790
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

970
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,792
YOU'RE RIGHT.

971
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,527
THAT'S US.

972
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,856
SHARON, ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

973
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,158
HAVE YOU COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND?

974
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,194
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

975
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,196
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN
YOUR FIRST PAYCHECK.

976
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,531
COULD YOU SPEND
WHAT LITTLE MONEY WE HAVE

977
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:22,833
IN A STUPIDER WAY?

978
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,104
I DON'T NEED THIS.

979
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,775
JON, WAIT.

980
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,189
CYNTHIA...

981
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,692
JON PRICE.

982
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,696
YEAH, I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT YOU, TOO.

983
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,731
I WAS JUST DRIVING AROUND

984
00:48:54,731 --> 00:49:00,737
AND THINKING ABOUT THAT OFFER
TO HAVE SOME WINE AND TALK.

985
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,307
WERE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THAT?

986
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,910
RIGHT NOW?

987
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,813
UH, YEAH...YEAH, SURE.

988
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,385
OKAY. WHERE AM I GOING?

989
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:35,505
HI.

990
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,443
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

991
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:42,512
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I'M HERE.

992
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,573
OH, HI, SHARON.

993
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,241
I'M SORRY I'M SO LATE.

994
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,578
YOU GOT A CALL-IN
FROM CYNTHIA.

995
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,046
CYNTHIA?

996
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,383
SHE SAYS PICK UP THE JACKET
YOU LEFT AT HER PLACE ANYTIME,

997
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,885
PREFERABLY AT NIGHT,
WHEN YOU CAN TUCK HER IN.

998
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,054
SHARON, SHE'S JUST
PLAYING WITH YOU.

999
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,623
IS SHE THE FIRST,
OR HAVE THERE BEEN OTHERS?

1000
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:36,726
SHE'S PROBABLY A FAN.
I DON'T KNOW.

1001
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,095
YOU KNOW WHAT, JON?

1002
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,964
DON'T LIE TO ME,
BECAUSE I AM NOT AN IDIOT.

1003
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:44,034
I CAN SMELL HER
ALL OVER YOU.

1004
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,738
OKAY, UH...

1005
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,208
OKAY, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS?

1006
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:54,911
NO. I'M TOO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW
TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.

1007
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,413
I'LL HAVE SOMEBODY COME OVER

1008
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,082
AND GET THE REST
OF MY THINGS TOMORROW.

1009
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,584
OH, OKAY, THAT'S IT?

1010
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:04,321
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PACK UP
AND LEAVE ME JUST LIKE THAT?

1011
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,823
THAT'S RIGHT, I'M PACKING UP,
AND I'M LEAVING.

1012
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:09,826
LOOK AT YOU. YOU DON'T EVEN
DRESS THE SAME ANYMORE.

1013
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,895
YOU LOOK LIKE HIM.
YOU LOOK LIKE KARLIN.

1014
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,230
IT'S THAT YOU'VE CHANGED.

1015
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,133
YOU SOLD YOURSELF OUT
TO GET WHAT YOU WANTED.

1016
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,402
MAYBE IT TOOK THIS OTHER WOMAN
TO MAKE ME SEE IT.

1017
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,904
I DON'T KNOW.

1018
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,672
I'M OUT OF HERE.

1019
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,008
OKAY, FINE.
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP YOU.

1020
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:28,512
YOU WANT TO END IT THIS WAY,
THEN GO, LEAVE.

1021
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:31,081
I DON'T NEED YOU, SHARON!

1022
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,044
I AM SUCH AN IDIOT.

1023
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:08,151
Karlin: Hey, Jon,
how's it going?

1024
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,654
YOU GAVE CYNTHIA MY NUMBER,
DIDN'T YOU?

1025
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,155
You don't sound too happy.

1026
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,491
THAT'S RIGHT, KARLIN.
I DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT.

1027
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,792
NEITHER DID SHARON.

1028
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,361
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE STILL
SEEING EACH OTHER.

1029
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,663
YEAH, RIGHT. NOT ANYMORE.

1030
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,831
You can have any woman
you want now.

1031
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:25,402
AND BELIEVE ME,
THERE'S A MILLION OF THEM.

1032
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,317
JON PRICE,

1033
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:43,520
I'M DETECTIVE WILKINSON.
THIS IS DETECTIVE DURRANO.

1034
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,090
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

1035
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,092
MIND IF WE ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS

1036
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,494
REGARDING THE MAN WHO CALLED
YOUR SHOW LAST WEEK?

1037
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,898
THE ONE WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE
COMMITTED A HOMICIDE?

1038
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,767
YOU MIND COMING WITH US?

1039
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,836
SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.

1040
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:26,896
COFFEE?

1041
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,231
NO, THANKS.

1042
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,733
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

1043
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,901
EVERYBODY THINKS
THAT COPS DRINK COFFEE.

1044
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,236
ME, I LIKE TEA.

1045
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,572
DOESN'T GO THROUGH
THE PIPES AS FAST.

1046
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,741
YOU WANT SOME TEA?

1047
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,909
THAT'S FINE.

1048
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,245
YEAH, I WANT TO TELL YOU,

1049
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,414
I REALLY LIKE
YOUR SHOW, MAN.

1050
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,917
ME AND MY PARTNER,
WE LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME.

1051
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,919
YOU GUYS DO SOME SICK STUFF.

1052
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:53,423
THAT "RATE THE BUTT" SEQUENCE
KILLED ME.

1053
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,492
THANKS.

1054
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,194
HERE YOU GO.

1055
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,937
JON...

1056
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,773
CAN I CALL YOU JON?

1057
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,641
YEAH, SURE.

1058
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,645
JON, WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION
OF THE GUY WHO CALLED UP,

1059
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:19,149
THE ONE WHO CLAIMED TO KILL
THE WOMAN HE PICKED UP?

1060
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,151
YOU THINK
HE'LL CALL BACK?

1061
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,819
HE SAID HE WOULD.

1062
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,156
MAYBE IT WAS JUST
A CRANK CALL.

1063
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,158
THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED.

1064
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,328
WE KNOW IT WASN'T
A CRANK CALL.

1065
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:36,666
I ASKED YOU IF YOU THOUGHT
HE MIGHT CALL BACK AGAIN.

1066
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,670
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT
THERE REALLY WAS A MURDER?

1067
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,838
YEAH, JON.

1068
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,306
THE GUY WAS FOR REAL.

1069
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,941
YOU SEEM SURPRISED.

1070
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:48,311
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE LEGIT.

1071
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:50,814
YEAH, IT'S JUST
KIND OF A SHOCK

1072
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,817
TO THINK HE WAS DESCRIBING
A REAL MURDER.

1073
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:57,320
WE KNOW HE KILLED THIS WOMAN
THREE MONTHS AGO.

1074
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,522
VIVIAN PORTER'S HER NAME.

1075
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,326
SHE WAS PUSHED OFF
A WAREHOUSE FIRE ESCAPE,

1076
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:06,329
JUST LIKE
THE CALLER DESCRIBED.

1077
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,332
SEVEN STORIES,
STRAIGHT DOWN.

1078
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,334
OH...

1079
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,403
GOD.

1080
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,474
OH, JESUS.

1081
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,976
WE DON'T HAVE A MOTIVE YET.

1082
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,344
NOT A STRONG ONE, ANYWAY.

1083
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,280
WE FIGURE IT'S PRETTY MUCH
WHAT HE SAID IT WAS --

1084
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,815
A ONE-NIGHT STAND GONE BAD.

1085
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:29,652
AND NOW HE'S GETTING HIS ROCKS
OFF CALLING YOUR SHOW

1086
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,488
TELLING THE WORLD
WHAT HE DID.

1087
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:34,491
JON, I'M GOING TO BE
DIRECT WITH YOU.

1088
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:38,995
WE BROUGHT YOU DOWN HERE
TO ASK YOU ONE SIMPLE QUESTION.

1089
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,431
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE CALLER?

1090
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:44,934
LIKE WHO HE IS,
FOR EXAMPLE?

1091
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,537
NO.

1092
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,738
ARE YOU SURE?

1093
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,942
YEAH, I'M POSITIVE.

1094
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,716
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE FIGURED.

1095
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:04,053
WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO
YOUR PARTNER, KARLIN PICKETT.

1096
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,189
SEE WHAT HE KNOWS.

1097
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:09,225
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO MONITOR
THE RADIO STATION,

1098
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:10,794
YOUR SHOW ESPECIALLY.

1099
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,129
IF THE CREEP CALLS,
WE'D LIKE TO BE THERE.

1100
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,632
IT ONLY TAKES 10 SECONDS
TO TRACE A CALL.

1101
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,901
FIVE MINUTES TO GET
THE BLACK-AND-WHITES

1102
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,402
THE LOCATION OF THE CALL.

1103
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,472
SO IF HE CALLS AGAIN,
YOU KEEP HIM TALKING, OKAY?

1104
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,709
OKAY.

1105
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,212
WE HAVE NOTHING MORE.

1106
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,749
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME, JON.

1107
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,250
OKAY, THANKS.

1108
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,419
HEY, THIS IS
OUR PHONE NUMBER

1109
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:39,422
IN CASE YOU WANT TO
CALL US ABOUT ANYTHING --

1110
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,925
A HUNCH, A LEAD, WHATEVER.

1111
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,660
OKAY, THANKS.

1112
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,499
BOY'S IN A HURRY.

1113
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:50,667
JON.

1114
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,669
WHO'S THE GUY
THAT'S CALLED THE SHOW?

1115
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:53,870
WHO IS HE, KARLIN?

1116
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,272
HOW COME YOU'RE SO CONCERNED
ABOUT WHO HE IS?

1117
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,675
A COUPLE COPS WE'RE
AT MY HOME THIS MORNING.

1118
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,177
THEY TOLD ME YOUR FRIEND
REALLY KILLED A WOMAN.

1119
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,111
ARE YOU KIDDING?

1120
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,313
NO, I'M NOT.

1121
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,149
IT ALL HAPPENED EXACTLY
THE WAY HE DESCRIBED IT.

1122
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,153
YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM
ANYTHING, DID YOU?

1123
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,489
NO, I WANTED TO
TALK TO YOU FIRST.

1124
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,158
WE GOT TO TELL THEM
WHO THIS GUY IS.

1125
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,659
NO, WE CAN'T DO THAT.

1126
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,660
WE HAVE TO.

1127
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,928
NO, WE DON'T.

1128
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,530
EDDIE --
EDDIE DIDN'T DO THIS.

1129
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,098
EDDIE? EDDIE WHAT?

1130
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:26,102
HE'S PROBABLY TAKING CREDIT FOR
SOMETHING HE SAW ON THE NEWS.

1131
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,605
I'M GOING TO TELL THE COPS
WHAT'S GOING ON,

1132
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:30,773
THAT YOU KNOW THE CALLER'S
THIS EDDIE GUY.

1133
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,009
YOU CAN'T.
WE GOT THE TOP-RATED SHOW.

1134
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,511
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

1135
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,114
YOU TELL THEM ABOUT EDDIE,
THEY'LL TAKE US OFF THE AIR.

1136
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,149
SCREW THE SHOW.
THIS GUY KILLED A WOMAN.

1137
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,551
HE DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

1138
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:44,921
LET'S SAY BY SOME COINCIDENCE,
THEY TIE HIM TO A MURDER.

1139
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,924
THE COPS WILL MAKE YOU AND ME
ACCOMPLICES TO IT.

1140
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,026
THAT MEANS JAIL TIME
FOR BOTH OF US.

1141
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,028
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH EDDIE.

1142
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,830
JON...

1143
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,165
YES, YOU DID.

1144
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,335
IF YOU WERE
TO PHONE THE COPS,

1145
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,905
I WOULD FUCK YOU OVER
ROYALLY.

1146
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,340
I AM NOT
SUFFERING THIS ALONE.

1147
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,144
I'LL SAY YOU KNEW AS MUCH
ABOUT EDDIE AS I DID.

1148
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:12,148
YOU WANTED WOMEN,
YOU WANTED SUCCESS, WELL...

1149
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:15,151
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR,
LITTLE BROTHER.

1150
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:16,819
IT ISN'T FREE.

1151
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:52,055
GOODBYE, HONEY.

1152
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,123
PLEASANT DREAMS.

1153
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:08,538
I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN
RIGHT NOW.

1154
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,480
I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN
RIGHT NOW.

1155
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:25,321
I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN
RIGHT NOW.

1156
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:36,666
I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN
RIGHT NOW.

1157
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,637
PAIR OF 2's. I'M OUT.

1158
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,938
AH, TOO BAD, JON.

1159
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,941
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT
THE CARD PLAYER I AM.

1160
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,442
YEAH, I GUESS NOT.

1161
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:48,277
CLAIRE, WHAT YOU GOT?

1162
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,113
STRAIGHT, 10 HIGH.

1163
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:53,583
STRAIGHT, 10 HIGH!
SUSAN, CAN YOU BEAT IT?

1164
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,751
MNH-MNH.

1165
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,420
SUSAN'S GOT A...PAIR,

1166
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,989
BUT WHAT A PAIR, OKAY.

1167
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:05,962
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT
BIG BROTHER KARLIN HAS.

1168
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:09,265
FOUR OF A KIND -- JACKS.

1169
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,474
LOOKS LIKE MY HAND.

1170
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:23,513
OKAY, SOMETHING HAS GOT TO
COME OFF, LADIES.

1171
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:28,151
ALL RIGHT. WHILE WE'RE WAITING
FOR OUR NEXT CRIMINAL TO CALL,

1172
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,153
LET'S GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS HERE.

1173
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,522
CALLER NUMBER 1,
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

1174
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,991
Man's voice:    WELL,
ARE THEY WEARING BRAS?

1175
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,993
YEP, AND NOT MUCH ELSE.

1176
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,995
WELL, TAKE THEM OFF!

1177
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:40,396
Karlin: MM...

1178
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,033
CALLER NUMBER 2,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1179
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,002
Man's voice: JON? KARLIN?

1180
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,004
YEAH,
WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION?

1181
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:51,574
UH, I'M SORRY,
BUT I HAD TO CALL AGAIN.

1182
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:54,877
OKAY, WE'RE LISTENING.

1183
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,879
I GUESS YOU KNOW BY NOW

1184
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,382
THAT I WASN'T JOKING
ABOUT VIVIAN, WAS I?

1185
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,051
I REALLY PUSHED HER OFF
THAT BUILDING.

1186
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:06,055
I'VE GOT TO GET THIS STUFF
OFF MY CHEST, YOU KNOW?

1187
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,057
I MET ANOTHER WOMAN
LAST NIGHT.

1188
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:11,360
I MEAN, I ACTUALLY LIKED HER,
YOU KNOW?

1189
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,863
I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO HER,

1190
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,866
BUT SHE STARTED TO LAUGH AT ME
WHEN WE DID IT.

1191
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,368
I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN
RIGHT NOW.

1192
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,604
THIS WOMAN,
SHE WENT HOME WITH YOU?

1193
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:24,107
YEAH -- NO, NO,
I WENT TO HER HOUSE.

1194
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:26,109
IS SHE OKAY?

1195
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,243
NO.

1196
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,612
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

1197
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,347
I KILLED HER...

1198
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,282
WITH CYANIDE.

1199
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:38,788
GET ME THE LOCATION
OF 555-7620.

1200
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,892
OKAY, KEEP TALKING.
TELL US MORE ABOUT IT.

1201
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:44,260
YOU KNOW HER NAME?

1202
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,695
YEAH.

1203
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:46,863
YEAH, WE'RE HERE.

1204
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,532
WE GOT AN E.S.U.
AND SIX BLACK-AND-WHITES

1205
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:51,534
HEADED FOR THE SOURCE
OF THE CALL.

1206
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,536
UM, I'VE SAID TOO MUCH
ALREADY.

1207
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,905
I...I REALLY...
I GOT TO GO.

1208
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,907
Jon: NO, NO, NO,
TALK TO US.

1209
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,242
COME ON,
WE'RE LISTENING.

1210
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,744
I'LL CALL AGAIN.

1211
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,746
[ DIAL TONE ]

1212
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,717
DAMN IT.

1213
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,287
WHAT IS GOING ON?

1214
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,290
I DON'T KNOW. EDDIE CALLED
ON HIS OWN THIS TIME.

1215
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,792
GET HIM TO STOP,
UNDERSTAND?

1216
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,794
YOU CAN'T BUY P.R.
LIKE THIS.

1217
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,296
I BET WE MAKE IT

01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:27,489
I PRERECORDED EDDIE'S VOICE
ON THIS TAPE MACHINE,

1393
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:33,128
AND I SENT IT TO OUR SHOW
BY WAY OF THIS AUTOMATIC TIMER.

1394
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,564
ALL I HAD TO DO

1395
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:36,965
WAS STICK TO A SCRIPT.

1396
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:39,034
I MADE IT SOUND
REAL AUTHENTIC,

1397
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,236
EVEN FOOLED YOU,
LITTLE BROTHER.

1398
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,476
OH. AH.

1399
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,177
WHAT'S THE MATTER, JON?

1400
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:53,181
I FEEL A LITTLE DIZZY.

1401
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:57,486
VIVIAN AND CYNTHIA --
GOD, THEY WERE HOT,

1402
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,454
ESPECIALLY VIVIAN.

1403
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:02,824
I KILLED THEM BOTH,
YOU KNOW.

1404
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:06,562
[ RETCHING NOISES ]

1405
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,597
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO KILL VIVIAN.

1406
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:11,433
WE WERE GETTING IT ON
ONE NIGHT ON THE RAILING

1407
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:16,371
OF THIS FIRE ESCAPE.
OH, GOD. SHE WAS SWEET.

1408
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:18,540
ANYWAY,
WE JUST GOTTEN THROUGH

1409
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,176
AND SHE STARTS
TO MEALY-MOUTH ALL THIS,

1410
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,078
"I WANT TO SEE
YOU AGAIN,"

1411
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,713
YOU KNOW,
RELATIONSHIP JARGON.

1412
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:27,249
I SUPPOSE SHE DIDN'T LIKE
MY RESPONSE

1413
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,018
BECAUSE SHE GOES
TO SLAP ME, I STEP BACK,

1414
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:32,955
THE BITCH GOES OVER
THE SIDE OF THE FIRE ESCAPE

1415
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:37,893
AND FALLS SEVEN STORIES
TO THE CONCRETE. SMACK.

1416
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:42,397
IT FREAKED ME OUT,

1417
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:45,334
BUT THAT'S
WHEN I DECIDED

1418
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:49,004
I WOULD USE HER DEATH
TO HELP ME.

1419
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:54,409
I WOULD INVENT A KILLER
WHO WOULD CALL INTO OUR SHOW

1420
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:57,579
AND CONFESS TO THE MURDER.

1421
01:16:57,579 --> 01:17:00,215
IT WAS
A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.

1422
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,184
WHY CYNTHIA?

1423
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:05,253
WHY DID YOU KILL HER?

1424
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:08,557
OUR AUDIENCE DEMANDED IT,
THAT'S WHY.

1425
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:11,193
THEY WANTED
A SERIAL KILLER.

1426
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:12,928
SO I GAVE THEM ONE.

1427
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:15,931
I EVEN GAVE THEM A DEAD
WOMAN HE COULD CALL IN

1428
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:18,667
AND CLAIM TO HAVE KILLED,

1429
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:21,269
BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH.

1430
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,105
[ RETCHING NOISES ]

1431
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:26,642
DO YOU KNOW THAT OUR RATINGS
WERE AT THEIR HIGHEST

1432
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,478
AFTER THAT FIRST CALL
FROM EDDIE?

1433
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:32,114
A 42 SHARE.

1434
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:36,618
BUT ONE WEEK LATER
THEY WERE FALLING OFF.

1435
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:39,788
ALL OUR NUMBERS WERE BAD.

1436
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:44,092
SO THE PEOPLE WANTED MORE,
MORE DEATH.

1437
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:47,162
SO I GAVE IT TO THEM.

1438
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:50,699
I GAVE IT TO THEM,

1439
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,635
AND FRANKLY, JON,
KILLING SOMEONE

1440
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:57,005
ISN'T AS HARD AS
IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE,

1441
01:17:57,005 --> 01:18:00,509
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S
A GOOD CAREER MOVE.

1442
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,545
YOU BASTARD. YOU POISONED ME,
TOO, DIDN'T YOU?

1443
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:06,715
YEAH. JON, THEY'RE GOING
TO FIND YOU HERE DEAD,

1444
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:10,686
AND BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE
I PLANTED AT YOUR HOUSE --

1445
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,088
CYNTHIA'S DRESS
AND HER WALLET --

1446
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:15,657
AND BECAUSE OF
ALL THIS EQUIPMENT,

1447
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:18,493
THEY'RE GOING TO THINK
YOU WERE EDDIE.

1448
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,830
THEY'RE GOING TO THINK
YOU KILLED CYNTHIA.

1449
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,666
NICE AND NEAT, HUH?

1450
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,501
AND YOU COMMITTED SUICIDE

1451
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:30,672
BECAUSE YOU JUST COULDN'T
LIVE WITH YOURSELF ANY LONGER.

1452
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:36,378
SO CYANIDE POISONING --
VERY SAD, BUT VERY POETIC.

1453
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,947
VICTIMIZER DIES
THE SAME WAY

1454
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:41,149
AS ONE
OF HIS VICTIMS.

1455
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,617
THE REAL BEAUTY OF IT IS,

1456
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:44,486
COUPLE DAYS
AFTER YOU'RE DEAD,

1457
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:45,787
I CAN GO BACK AND HAVE

1458
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:47,889
THE MOST TALKED ABOUT

1459
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:50,726
IN THE COUNTRY
ALL TO MYSELF.

1460
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:54,396
I'LL BECOME
A MEDIA KING.

1461
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,965
EVEN OPRAH WILL WANT
TO DO A SPECIAL ON ME.

1462
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:59,234
HIS CO-WORKER
WAS A HOMICIDAL MANIAC.

1463
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:02,003
SO YOU JUST HAVE BEEN
USING ME ALL THE TIME.

1464
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:05,173
OH, YEAH. I HAD
IT FIGURED OUT MONTHS AGO

1465
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:07,976
AND YOU WERE JUST
THE RIGHT SUCKER

1466
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:10,846
AT THE RIGHT PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

1467
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,114
I'M SORRY, JON,

1468
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,649
BUT I TOLD YOU
I HAD BIG PLANS,

1469
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:17,185
AND NONE OF THEM
INCLUDED YOU.

1470
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:22,090
YOU ARE SUCH
A BASTARD, KARLIN.

1471
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,125
YOU MANIPULATED ME

1472
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,293
INTO DOING ONE SICK THING
AFTER ANOTHER

1473
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:26,795
UNTIL MY LIFE WAS A WRECK.

1474
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,297
YOU DIDN'T DRINK
YOUR BOURBON.

1475
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:31,733
I DIDN'T DRINK
THE BOURBON, KARLIN.

1476
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:34,136
I SMELLED CYANIDE
IN THE BOURBON.

1477
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:38,240
COPS TOLD ME CYANIDE
SMELLS LIKE BURNT ALMONDS.

1478
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,741
SO I SWITCHED THE BOURBON

1479
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:42,244
FOR SOME COLA AND WATER
IN THE KITCHEN.

1480
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:45,213
EVEN YOU WERE FOOLED,
LITTLE BROTHER.

1481
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:47,983
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

1482
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:50,318
YOU GOING
TO SHOOT ME?

1483
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:53,722
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SHOT ME, JON.

1484
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,591
YOU'RE IN SOME
VERY DEEP SHIT NOW.

1485
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:57,793
NO, I'M NOT.

1486
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:01,296
NO ONE CAN TIE ME
INTO ANY OF THIS.

1487
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:04,766
OH, YEAH?

1488
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:07,602
I'M WIRED, KARLIN.

1489
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:10,505
I'M WIRED,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

1490
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:12,974
THIS PHONE IS BEING
PIPED INTO THE STATION,

1491
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:16,111
AND THEY'RE USING
THEIR 55,000 WATTS OF POWER

1492
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:19,748
TO SPREAD IT TO
EVERY SINGLE CORNER OF TOWN.

1493
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,917
THE WHOLE CITY'S
BEEN LISTENING TO YOU.

1494
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,286
EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN
TELLING ME IS GOING OUT

1495
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:25,320
ON POWER 98.

1496
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,955
THAT'S RIGHT, KARLIN.

1497
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,957
AREN'T YOU
THE ONE THAT SAID

1498
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:31,793
THERE'S A WHOLE CITY
OF PERVERSION OUT THERE

1499
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,295
FULL OF PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T AFRAID

1500
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,297
TO TAP INTO
THE DARK SIDE OF THEMSELVES?

1501
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,799
OR MAYBE YOU WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

1502
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,668
HEY, CAN YOU
BELIEVE THIS STUFF?

1503
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,837
TELL ME SOMETHING, KARLIN.

1504
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,139
HOW DOES IT FEEL KNOWING
YOU JUST EXPOSED YOURSELF

1505
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:45,807
TO A MILLION PEOPLE?

1506
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:46,808
JESUS.

1507
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:48,310
THEY HAVE GUNS?

1508
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,544
QUIET.

1509
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:52,714
CONFESSING IS GOOD
FOR THE SOUL, ISN'T IT, KARLIN?

1510
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:55,750
AND JUST THINK WHAT OUR
NUMBERS WILL BE LIKE TOMORROW.

1511
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:05,861
Detective:
OPEN UP. POLICE!

1512
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,629
Detective #2:
THE POLICE! OPEN UP.

1513
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,364
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

1514
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:10,799
LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE

1515
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,968

1520
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:23,411
IT'S MY PLEASURE
TO FUCK YOU OVER.

1521
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,695
DON'T MOVE!

1522
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:43,531

PUT IT DOWN.

1523
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:46,034
FREEZE!

1524
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,636
PUT THE GUN DOWN,

1525
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,852
Jon: OW.

1526
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:05,253
AH.

1527
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,222
OH, JESUS.

1528
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:08,556
GUN.

1529
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:10,558
WHOA. WHOA.

1530
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:16,231
Paramedic: WATCH YOUR BACKS.
WE'RE COMING THROUGH HERE.

1531
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:20,902
Man #2: WE RAN IN THE SECOND
WE HEARD YOU GUYS ON THE AIR.

1532
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:23,305
YOU DID GOOD, KID,

1533
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,141
BUT THANK GOD
WE WERE FOLLOWING KARLIN.

1534
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:27,842
IT KEPT US NEARBY.

1535
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:31,646
SO I THINK HARRISON FORD
OUGHT TO PLAY YOU

1536
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:34,649
IN THE MOVIE
VERSION OF ALL THIS.

1537
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:36,184
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1538
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:38,119
YEAH.

1539
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,754
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

1540
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:55,270
Woman: MORE COFFEE?

1541
01:22:56,938 --> 01:23:00,408
SO YOU HAVEN'T TALKED
TO SHARON YET?

1542
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:04,112
NOPE.

1543
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:07,582
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT GOING OVER TO HER PLACE,

1544
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:10,118
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE'D REACT.

1545
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:13,455
MAYBE IF YOU APOLOGIZE...

1546
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:14,823
GROVEL.

1547
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,225
IF YOU GET
ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES

1548
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:20,795
AND BEG FOR HER FORGIVENESS
LIKE A DOG,

1549
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:21,963
MAYBE SHE'LL COME AROUND.

1550
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:25,467
I MEAN,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?

1551
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:28,603
YEAH.

1552
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,472
NO, NO. IT'S ON ME.

1553
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:31,906
YOU EARNED IT.

1554
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:33,308
HEY, THANKS.

1555
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:35,610
YOU KNOW, IT'S
JUST NOT THE SAME ANYMORE

1556
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,379
WITHOUT YOU
AT THE STATION.

1557
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:39,147
YEAH. WELL, THANKS, ROGER,

1558
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:42,550
BUT I THINK I NEED A BREAK
FROM RADIO FOR A WHILE.

1559
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:43,551
YEAH.

1560
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:45,420
DON'T BLAME YOU.

1561
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,155
HEY, GOOD LUCK.

1562

TAKE IT EASY.

1563
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:04,506
HI.

1564
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:07,175
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1565
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,181
HOW'S YOUR HAND?

GOOD.
I HAVE CALLS TO MAKE.

1569
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:23,558
SHARON, LOOK.
I'M SORRY.

1570
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,027
I KNOW WHAT I DID
WAS WRONG,

1571
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:28,563
YOU KNOW, AND...

1572
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,832
IT WAS LIKE
I WAS POSSESSED.

1573
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:33,701
NO ONE FORCED YOU
TO DO ANYTHING.

1574
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,037
YEAH, I KNOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT, SHARON.

1575
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,973
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU KNOW, NO ONE FORCED ME.

1576
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:41,276
I WANTED
ALL THE WRONG THINGS --

1577
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:42,877
THINGS THAT IN THE END

1578
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:45,380
DIDN'T WIND UP
MEANING ANYTHING.

1579
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,148
YOU DO.

1580
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:06,968
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE
EASY FOR ME.

1581
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:10,205
YEAH, I KNOW.

1582
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:13,208
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU
ANYTHING.

1583
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:17,045
WE'LL TAKE IT
ONE DAY AT A TIME, OKAY?

1584
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:21,583
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

1585
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:24,119
WANT TO GRAB A BITE?

1586
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:27,155
