1
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:47,381
Oh, my God!

2
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,751
I don't I've ever had anyone
stuck that long in jail.

3
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:51,619
I'm sorry, Bubba.

4
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:53,621
Crazy. 10.

5
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:56,524
She just got doubles.

6
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:58,392
- Okay.
- 175.

7
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,460
- Mr. Money Bags over here.
- I land on it every time.

8
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,162
- How much?
- I landed on it twice.

9
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,665
Don't you remember
when you were little

10
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,165
when we used to play,
you'd never want your ones?

11
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,534
You'd be like,
"just keep the change."

12
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:08,168
Like you were some big spender.

13
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,238
That's why he
always used to play banker.

14
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,174
- Yeah, I know.
- We need to gang up on Sean.

15
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,476
Brody, Brody come here.

16
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,211
Brody, come.

17
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,346
Brody, come here.

18
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,715
Oh, no.

19
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,316
Don't buy it,
no, I wanna buy it!

20
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,619
No.

21
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:27,220
Which one's it go with?

22
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,356
You know what?
Fine, fine.

23
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,725
I'm gonna, if you ever
wanna buy this one...

24
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:39,299
Alright, what are you thinking?

25
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,484
Yay!

26
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,186
Eight.

27
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,722
Walk up to a butterfly

28
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:03,457
with a stick.

29
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,892
I know I said something
interesting happened,

30
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:05,893
but I never really knew that...

31
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:07,494
Hey, Chatty Cathy.

32
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,263
- Oh yeah.
- It's your turn.

33
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,379
Okay.

34
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,716
Can't tell Mom, this is
just between me and you.

35
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,785
You're getting the good treats.

36
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,560
Good girl.

37
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,457
Hmm.

38
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,681
Morning.

39
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,516
Oh, hey.

40
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,618
You were looking so cozy,
I just let you sleep.

41
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,886
Oh, thank you.

42
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,020
You're welcome.

43
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,923
I had a really
weird dream, though.

44
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:17,390
Yeah?

45
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,495
Yeah.

46
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:30,671
We were in the middle of
the woods and you were

47
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:33,975
walking ahead of me and
I couldn't see your face,

48
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:38,278
and I kept trying to catch
up to you, and I couldn't.

49
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:41,516
And I was calling out your name,

50
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,416
and you wouldn't turn around.

51
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:49,422
Then I had this overwhelming
sense of letting go.

52
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,291
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,493
Yeah, you should be, asshole.

54
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,464
Well, I promise I'll be
nicer to you in your dreams.

55
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,534
Oh, thank you.

56
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,935
You're welcome.

57
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,706
What?

58
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,408
There was something else.

59
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,377
You stopped at one
point and I was finally

60
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,514
able to catch up to you,
and when I did,

61
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:14,816
I was really afraid.

62
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,685
And I called your
name one more time

63
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:22,389
and then you turned around
and you turned around and...

64
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,493
I turned around and what?

65
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:34,902
I woke up.

66
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,038
That's when I woke up.

67
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,372
I'm making breakfast.

68
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,374
- Box came.
- Yeah, want anything?

69
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,475
No, I'm good.

70
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:45,046
But you know what?

71
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,349
You guys eat, let me know,
I'll come up and sit with you.

72
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,352
Donovans are still
getting a box.

73
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:53,955
That's good.

74
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,467
Come on, time to get up.

75
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,870
Hey, come on, sleepy ahead.

76
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:12,405
It's after 10,
daylight's a-wasting.

77
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,574
Sean, time to get up, breakfast.

78
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:16,077
- What, what?
- It's time to get up.

79
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,613
I been up for a while.

80
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,413
Yeah, sure you have.

81
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,150
I got up at four.

82
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,620
- Okay.
- I went back to...

83
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,487
Sure you did.
Okay, come on, breakfast.

84
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:41,903
Any bagels?

85
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:45,539
There's just two, so
you can each have one.

86
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:48,709
I don't need a whole one.

87
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,511
No, I'm good, and your
father doesn't want one, so.

88
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,679
Thanks, mom.

89
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:56,984
Cut this now.

90
00:06:58,586 --> 00:06:59,954
Any cereal?

91
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,188
Oh, no, sorry, bub.

92
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:02,590
Okay.

93
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:03,991
Not like we have
any milk anyway.

94
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,126
I don't care.

95
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,041
Here, put that under there.

96
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:21,441
Be careful.

97
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,518
Stephen!

98
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,156
Stephen!

99
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,161
He cut himself.

100
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:41,996
How bad is it?

101
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:42,897
Get me a rag.

102
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,767
You're bleeding, oh, my God.

103
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:47,835
No.

104
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,505
Let me see, let me
see it, let me see it.

105
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,606
You're okay.

106
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:54,875
Front.

107
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,178
That's a little deep.

108
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,779
How many times have I
told you to be careful?

109
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,281
Especially when using a knife.

110
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,582
- I'm fine, Mom.
- But what if it wasn't?

111
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,217
What if it was worse?

112
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,286
There are no hospitals to go to.

113
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,555
There is nobody to call.

114
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,191
We're on our own.
Do you know what that means?

115
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,927
- Mom.
- Hey, it's okay.

116
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,928
Yes, Mom.

117
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,730
They get it.

118
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,872
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,741
You don't need to be sorry,
you just need to be careful.

120
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:29,276
And keep it elevated.

121
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,145
I'll check on it in a minute.

122
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:38,819
- He's gonna be fine.
- How many times

123
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,821
have we told them
they have to be careful?

124
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,657
Oh, I don't know, a million.

125
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,326
They have to understand,
Stephen.

126
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,294
They do, they understand.

127
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:48,295
We never should've come here.

128
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,131
You'd rather be back in Boston?

129
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:52,733
- In that tiny apartment?
- It wasn't that tiny.

130
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,802
We would've been tripping
all over ourselves.

131
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,070
Thank God we've
got the summer house.

132
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,304
At least there are people there.

133
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:58,339
It's safer with less people.

134
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,974
Is it?

135
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,742
Really?
What if something happened?

136
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:02,810
What if something really
happened, Stephen?

137
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:03,911
We would be on our own!

138
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,279
We are on our own.

139
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,348
We would've been
on our own there too.

140
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,583
Mass General was still
operating before we left.

141
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,319
Yeah, but for how long?

142
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:14,789
Everything was being
shut down, quarantined.

143
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,657
It's safer here.

144
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,793
The less people, the safer.

145
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:23,631
- Okay, how's it feel?
- It feels better.

146
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,332
Doesn't hurt that bad.

147
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:28,736
We got the bleeding to stop, so.

148
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,004
Yeah.

149
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,939
Just tape that right there.

150
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,143
- I love you.
- I love you too.

151
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:52,079
Brody.

152
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,181
What you looking at, girl?

153
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:57,051
What do you see out there?

154
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,920
What are you all
worried about, huh?

155
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,323
Who's a good girl?

156
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:03,891
Kisses, thank you.

157
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:05,793
Okay.

158
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,333
<i>You, you're a mental case.</i>

159
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,068
<i>Yes, maybe I am.</i>

160
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,470
<i>Ingratiating bastard.</i>

161
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:19,039
<i>Do you always play
kiss-ass with the loonies?</i>

162
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,774
<i>No.</i>

163
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,876
<i>I like you,
Kane, you're regular.</i>

164
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,347
<i>Take the medal.</i>

165
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,083
<i>- I'll take this book.
- What book?</i>

166
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,188
<i>"I Remember Mamma"
by Oedipus Rex.</i>

167
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,431
<i>May I go?</i>

168
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:45,399
<i>You're gone, you're gone.</i>

169
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,401
So far, so good.

170
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,436
So far, very good.

171
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,479
This okay?

172
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:01,448
As long as I can turn my pages.

173
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:03,417
Ah, I don't wanna disturb you.

174
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,319
Oh no, it's fine.

175
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,554
Oh, come on, I'm sorry.

176
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:08,155
I like when you're close.

177
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,024
You're such a liar.

178
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,193
Mm.

179
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,962
What you reading?

180
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,196
Jack Reacher.

181
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,165
Mm, it's any good?

182
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,833
I've read it before.

183
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,509
Do you want to talk?

184
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,910
No, I'm tired.
You go ahead and read.

185
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,914
We can talk.

186
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,452
I am so sorry
about this morning.

187
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,954
Don't be.
That was scary.

188
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,292
Thank God it wasn't
something more serious.

189
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:48,195
I really worry
about those two boys.

190
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,063
I know, I do too.

191
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,267
No, not just this morning,
I mean...

192
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:58,305
Stephen,
they're growing up in isolation.

193
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,341
It's not like they were...

194
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,876
My God, don't you remember
the fights we used to get into

195
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,413
trying to get 'em
off their computers?

196
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,650
Used to yell so much.

197
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:11,251
But they're not
outdoor creatures.

198
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:14,021
Sean used to love football.

199
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,260
Maybe he will again someday.

200
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,029
Don't say that.

201
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,064
- Say what?
- Someday.

202
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,401
We've been waiting for
that day for so long,

203
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,572
that word has no
meaning for me anymore.

204
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:33,474
Hey, we're gonna
get through this.

205
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,209
Can't go on forever.

206
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,547
Donovans are still
getting a box.

207
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:42,983
Yeah.

208
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:47,121
And people do recover from it.

209
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,956
Before they shut
the internet down,

210
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,625
how many stories
did we read about people

211
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:53,360
that were just
raving mad one second

212
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:58,031
and then totally fine the next,
like nothing had happened?

213
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,569
But how do you know it's real?

214
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,673
Don't you ever think about that?

215
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,308
I could have been
sick this whole time.

216
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,644
You could have been
sick this whole time.

217
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,582
What if it's just a fever dream?
How would you know?

218
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,084
You wouldn't.

219
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:22,256
What if you're just
strapped to a bed somewhere

220
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,125
in some induced
coma so you don't

221
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,531
hurt yourself or
rip your face off.

222
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,535
And this whole time,
you could think

223
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,603
you're just lying next to me.
How would you know?

224
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:38,540
Because this feels real to me.

225
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:41,108
Doesn't this feel real to you?

226
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,380
Look, I know when the days
all bleed one into the other,

227
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:50,217
you can feel adrift,
but we're here together.

228
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,619
Hey.

229
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,054
Come here, gimme your hand.

230
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,122
Come here.

231
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,492
You feel that?

232
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:00,628
Do you feel my heart?

233
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:01,729
Yeah.

234
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:04,532
That's real.

235
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,401
That's real.

236
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:15,543
I love you.

237
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:16,977
I love you too.

238
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,087
To get to the

239
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,623
What are you doing?

240
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:36,691
Let's go!

241
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:44,131
Hi.

242
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:47,334
Go, team, let's
go, team, let's go, team!

243
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,349
Come on,
bub, it's time to get up.

244
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,252
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

245
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:39,807
Wow.

246
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:41,843
I know, I didn't think the seeds

247
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,878
from last year
were gonna sprout.

248
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,445
It's crazy.

249
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,614
You wanna help?

250
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,950
Not if we want 'em to live.

251
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:50,484
Aw, come on, it's easy.

252
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,486
I killed a cactus once.

253
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,755
I can't be trusted.

254
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,793
Well, at least you can
keep me company, right?

255
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:00,595
I can do that.

256
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:04,832
They're early.

257
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:06,500
Go get the boys, I'll get her.

258
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,803
Brody, Brody, Brody.

259
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,671
Brody, come. Brody, come on.

260
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:11,939
Brody, come on!

261
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:16,577
Hello?

262
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:19,046
Hello, hello, yeah, we're here.

263
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:22,784
Wyatt, Wyatt, it's the call.

264
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:26,419
Whitton family, M-A-6-3-9-6-4.

265
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,790
Sean?
Sean, it's the call.

266
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:33,861
Wyatt Whitton,
identification W-W-3-9-4-7-2.

267
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:39,332
This Anna Whitton,
identification A-W-3-9-4-7-1.

268
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:44,772
Sean Witten, S-W-3-9-4-7-3.

269
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,910
I didn't get the beep.
I didn't get a beep.

270
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:51,679
Identification, you didn't say...

271
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:55,616
Sean Whitton,
identification S-W-3-9-4-7-3.

272
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:58,485
We've been asking for
shoes for both boys,

273
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,787
size nine and 10.

274
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:09,831
- Didn't stay on the line.
- It's okay, Dad.

275
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:11,799
Yeah, it's okay.
We'll get by.

276
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,366
It's been five weeks.

277
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,504
We ask for movies,
they send movies.

278
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,039
Just needs shoes.

279
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:20,007
It's okay, we'll get 'em.

280
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,044
It's not like we're
going anywhere.

281
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:24,477
Such bullshit.

282
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:34,956
Okay, so we are still
on the battle of Gettysburg.

283
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:38,860
Wyatt, can you read the end of
the Gettysburg Address there?

284
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:41,128
"We here highly
resolve that these dead

285
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:44,932
shall not have died in vain,
that this nation under God

286
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:47,400
shall have a new
birth of freedom,

287
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,871
and that government of
the people, by the people,

288
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:53,040
for the people shall not
perish from this Earth."

289
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,192
<i>Which makes you
a murderer, don't it?</i>

290
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:19,961
<i>Palmer now.</i>

291
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:27,835
<i>This is pure nonsense.</i>

292
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,004
<i>It doesn't prove a thing.</i>

293
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:32,606
<i>I thought you'd
feel that way, Garry.</i>

294
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,842
<i>You were the only one that
could have got to that blood.</i>

295
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,476
<i>We'll do you last.</i>

296
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:44,051
That was not funny.

297
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:46,220
It's a little funny.

298
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:47,521
<i>Blast him!</i>

299
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:13,781
There's so much emptiness.

300
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:16,317
Kill him now.

301
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,952
I don't like...

302
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,620
Kill him.

303
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:32,660
- Shh, the kids.
- I know.

304
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,715
- Oh, my God. Is that bacon?
- Yes.

305
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:57,251
- Do you want some?
- Yes.

306
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,385
I'd eat that raw.

307
00:26:58,419 --> 00:26:59,887
It was a really good box.

308
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,422
Yeah?

309
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,390
What else is in there?

310
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:05,092
Do you wanna know or do
you want me to surprise you?

311
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:08,028
You know, I actually
have to think about that.

312
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:09,763
I'll tell you one thing.

313
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:11,398
One of your favorite
things is in there.

314
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:13,667
Okay, that's not fair.

315
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:17,171
I like driving you crazy.

316
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:18,339
Drove me crazy last night.

317
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,842
You know,
you might as well tell me.

318
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:23,344
You are anyway, you're
terrible at keeping secrets.

319
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:24,778
I am not.

320
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:28,883
- Yes I am.
- Okay.

321
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,818
- Tell me this.
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:33,787
Is there sushi in that box?

323
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:35,723
No, there is not
sushi in the box.

324
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:38,225
'Cause that would
be fucking awesome.

325
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:39,260
Sushi in a box?

326
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:40,694
Ben to box.

327
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:44,465
Okay, you're gonna
be like, what?

328
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,835
But you know what I
would kill for right now?

329
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,436
A fucking Whopper.

330
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,305
- What?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

331
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,975
An original chicken
sandwich from Burger King.

332
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:56,243
Yeah.

333
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:58,913
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, no.

334
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,749
It's like this
laboratory-created perfect disc

335
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:04,718
of like crunchy,
greasy yumminess

336
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:06,220
that you just have
to eat right there

337
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:08,856
in your car in the parking lot.

338
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,958
Drive-throughs.

339
00:28:11,926 --> 00:28:15,229
Hey, why don't you
go get the kids up?

340
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:16,830
Yeah.

341
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:24,171
She's getting so old.

342
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:27,007
She's a good girl.

343
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:31,278
She's gonna die in this
house before this ends.

344
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:33,214
Just like Hooper.

345
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:35,349
And we're already
here to bury her.

346
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:38,919
There's no work to miss,
no school to skip,

347
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,821
no life to go back to.

348
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,993
It'll just be something
to mark the time.

349
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:48,462
Some stray detail while we wait.

350
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:55,169
Hey.

351
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:58,339
That's my good girl.

352
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:00,774
Yeah, that's my good girl.

353
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:06,847
What's the matter?

354
00:29:58,332 --> 00:30:00,834
Wyatt?
Wyatt?

355
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,371
- Wyatt?
- Yeah?

356
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:06,073
How long have you been in there?

357
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:07,542
About a couple minutes.

358
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:09,009
Did you set your timer?

359
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,444
'Course I did.

360
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:13,047
- Five minutes.
- I know.

361
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,516
No, five minutes,
not a minute longer.

362
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:17,251
Four and a half to be safe.

363
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,386
- Okay?
- Yeah.

364
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,988
Fine.

365
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:35,035
Okay, wait, what is this guy?

366
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,538
Get the milk.

367
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:39,373
I've never heard you
guys do this one before.

368
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:43,110
It's not like we can access
it anymore, we're trying.

369
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,346
Hey Wyatt, do you remember the?

370
00:30:47,515 --> 00:30:48,949
Has anyone seen the dog?

371
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,418
- What is he gonna do?
- Stop it.

372
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:53,621
No.

373
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:54,988
You guys are being too silly

374
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:56,558
things that they do.

375
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:59,026
Has anybody seen the dog?!

376
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:02,630
- Sorry, I can't find Brody.
- She's not on the deck?

377
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:05,667
- I don't see her.
- Is the gate closed?

378
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,434
Yeah, gates' closed.

379
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:09,169
And she's not out there?

380
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:19,313
Brody!

381
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:22,483
Brody!

382
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:26,954
Come on, girl.

383
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:29,557
Brody, come!

384
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:45,573
Brody!

385
00:31:58,285 --> 00:31:59,186
Brody!

386
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:05,092
Brody!

387
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:45,733
Brody!

388
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:48,736
- Ah ha.
- Wow!

389
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:51,673
How did you beat that?

390
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,373
With that crappy roll.

391
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:58,646
Dad, Northwest
territory attacks Alberta.

392
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:01,583
Dad.

393
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,418
It's your turn.

394
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:05,319
I'm sorry.

395
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,088
We don't have to play
if you don't want to.

396
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,691
No, no, no.
It's fine.

397
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:12,493
She'll come back.

398
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:11,151
You're never
gonna love me again?

399
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:13,120
I don't even wanna look at you.

400
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:14,288
Why?

401
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:19,594
I don't like my bread!

402
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:40,882
- I'm just spinning.
- Oh yeah!

403
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:20,888
She's gone.

404
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,790
She could come back.

405
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:23,891
She's had us worried before.

406
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:26,326
Not like this.

407
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,295
This is different.

408
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,329
It's okay.

409
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:32,332
Why would she run off?

410
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,836
Because she could.

411
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:47,548
Holy shit.

412
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,953
And turned the bed around

413
00:35:51,986 --> 00:35:54,388
so the next time
when the alarm went off,

414
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,923
it flew into the wall.

415
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:57,491
He was so fucking mad.

416
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,292
He was so fucking mad.

417
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,528
He was like, "I'll kill
everybody in this room!"

418
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:04,498
Hey, what are you guys watching?

419
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:05,800
Oh, oh, oh no, busted.

420
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,637
Definitely,
definitely can't go that way.

421
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:10,772
Oh my.

422
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,373
What are you guys doing?

423
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:16,276
- It's called laughing.
- They're drunk.

424
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,879
Wait, how?

425
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:20,848
Well, sometimes the gods,
they favour the brave,

426
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:22,550
and they send down
from the heavens...

427
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:26,754
Actually, we got this.
We got this in the box.

428
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:28,488
Is that whiskey?

429
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:29,724
How do you know that?

430
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:31,726
It's Irish whiskey.

431
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:34,461
This is your birthright.
Do you want some?

432
00:36:34,494 --> 00:36:36,296
- Yeah.
- No, Stephen.

433
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,799
What?
He's 100% Irish.

434
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:40,434
He should have
some Irish whiskey.

435
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:44,304
Okay, he's 92% Irish,
and then he's 8% Viking.

436
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:45,740
We're part Viking?

437
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:47,407
Yeah, the parts that
raped and pillaged

438
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:48,810
their way through Ireland.

439
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:50,243
- Stephen!
- Jeez, Dad.

440
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:51,445
What?

441
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:53,781
- It's history.
- Okay, fine.

442
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:57,018
Just get two glasses
and I'll pour you...

443
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:59,453
Wait, so what is it?

444
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:02,924
It's actually pretty
decent bottle of hooch.

445
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,324
It's booze.

446
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:06,359
How does it taste?

447
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:07,695
Well, it tastes a
little bit like heaven

448
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:09,329
and a little bit like hell.

449
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:10,865
Okay.

450
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,801
- Mom!
- Mom.

451
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:14,769
That's plenty.

452
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:18,338
All right, here goes.

453
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:23,544
Oh bubba, I'm so sorry.

454
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:24,946
Can I have some more?

455
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:28,616
No, thank you.

456
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:31,318
- You okay?
- I hate whiskey.

457
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,789
It likes you.

458
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,389
It does.
Yep.

459
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,859
I can't pour.

460
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:39,894
My pour spell is broken.

461
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,330
My God, have I ever
told you guys the story

462
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:45,633
- about how I met your mom?
- Yes.

463
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,969
Okay, fine.

464
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:50,303
It's only the story of
how you got to be here.

465
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:52,405
So, you know, never mind.

466
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:55,676
Oh, my God, I did not like
you when I first met you.

467
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,079
I didn't even notice you.

468
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:59,446
You were so full of yourself!

469
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:02,750
Oh, and he tried
so hard to be noticed.

470
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:04,451
Oh, my God.

471
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:06,587
And then you did that thing.

472
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:09,590
- I did, I did that thing.
- Yes, you did that thing.

473
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:11,793
Imagine if you hadn't
done that thing.

474
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:14,796
I would be who knows
where with who knows who.

475
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:16,531
My God, and I'd be
right there with you,

476
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,533
except totally without you.

477
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,105
Aww.

478
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:27,407
- Cheers to family, guys.
- Oh, cheers.

479
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,777
Love you guys.

480
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:31,546
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

481
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,881
Yeah.

482
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:50,330
- It's raining.
- Terrific.

483
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:56,737
Please tell me there's a
fucking aspirin in there.

484
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:59,406
Can you go get the kids up?

485
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,340
Yeah.

486
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:07,582
Come on, Wyatt, time to get up.

487
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,651
- What was that?
- What?

488
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:12,419
What'd you just
shove under there?

489
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:13,788
Nothing.

490
00:39:13,821 --> 00:39:15,590
Nothing.

491
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:16,791
- I'm gonna take a look.
- Dad, it's nothing.

492
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:18,659
- Wyatt.
- Wait, no, Dad.

493
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:29,737
- What the fuck was that?
- I can explain.

494
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,172
What the fuck was that?

495
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,874
What is it?

496
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:34,508
It's okay,
really, I can explain.

497
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,177
- Stop talking!
- Stephen!

498
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,411
- It's okay!
- He was online!

499
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:41,048
He's fucking chatting
with somebody, right?

500
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:42,950
- You're online?
- Oh, my God.

501
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:44,819
- Mom.
- What did he do?

502
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:46,921
- He's got his phone.
- He has his what?

503
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:49,056
Mom, come on!

504
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,525
Did you go into the safe?
Did you break into the safe?

505
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:55,162
- Yes.
- Are you insane?

506
00:39:55,196 --> 00:39:57,064
Mom, it's not that big a deal.
Just let me explain.

507
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:59,634
My God, will you stop talking?

508
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,135
Who was that?

509
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:03,170
Who were you just chatting with?

510
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:06,040
- Well?
- You told me to stop talking.

511
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,474
Don't be a fucking smart ass.

512
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:09,043
Who was that?

513
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,544
- It was just a friend.
- From where?

514
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:12,046
She's from Chicago.

515
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,214
- Wyatt.
- Shut up, Sean.

516
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,448
I'm sure
you know all about this.

517
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:16,617
- I didn't know.
- Oh, tell me the truth.

518
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:17,885
Do you have your phone too?

519
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,486
- No.
- Don't lie to us.

520
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:21,589
Yes.

521
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:23,958
- We're both online.
- Sean!

522
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:25,993
- They need to know.
- God dammit, shit!

523
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:27,128
We're talking to people
all over the world.

524
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:28,461
There's thousands of us.

525
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:29,830
What, how?

526
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:31,498
Like network set
up all over the place.

527
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:33,100
You guys wouldn't
know about that.

528
00:40:33,134 --> 00:40:34,168
That's how it gets in here!

529
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,536
- Dad!
- Shut up.

530
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:37,838
Do you know what you've done?

531
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:39,540
Do know what kind of
danger you've put us in?

532
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:41,075
- It's fine.
- Oh, it's fine.

533
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,543
Yeah, 'cause no one
even thinks it's real.

534
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,612
Oh, it's not real, huh?

535
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:46,514
Why don't tell that
to your grandfather.

536
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:48,049
You know what?

537
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:49,550
Tell it to my friend
Charlie Bishop, okay?

538
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,152
Go tell him.

539
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:53,621
- 'Cause I watched him die.
- It's different now.

540
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,690
These are like
3G networks at best.

541
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:57,925
Just so we can
talk to each other.

542
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,660
I can't listen to this anymore.

543
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:00,594
There's thousands of
people communicating.

544
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:01,929
They have been for months.

545
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:03,264
And how long have
you been doing it?

546
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,765
Just a little while.

547
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,233
- How long?
- A week.

548
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:07,969
- 10 days.
- Why didn't you tell us?

549
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:10,504
Because of this.
We knew you'd freak out.

550
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:12,006
There's whole parts
of the country

551
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,708
- back up and running again.
- Don't listen to this.

552
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:17,111
Jennifer goes to a
school, an actual school.

553
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:18,245
You can't listen to this.

554
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,847
He could be infected already.

555
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,116
We could all be infected by now!

556
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:23,584
Have you seen it?

557
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:24,919
Have you seen the schools

558
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:26,620
and these cities
back up and running?

559
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:28,055
My friend Noah video
chatted me the other day

560
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:29,757
from a coffee shop.

561
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,759
There were people in
the background ordering.

562
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:34,295
But if you were infected,
how would you know that's real?

563
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:36,063
That's what this does!

564
00:41:36,097 --> 00:41:37,999
Don't you understand?

565
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:40,735
It steals reality
right out from under you

566
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:42,870
and traps you in
this virtual version

567
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:46,307
that looks and feels
and sounds and smells

568
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,676
just like the real thing,
but it's not!

569
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:50,878
In reality,
you're some ravaged skeleton

570
00:41:50,911 --> 00:41:52,613
strapped to a
fucking hospital bed.

571
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:53,748
Dad, we're fine.

572
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,182
You can see I'm fine, right?

573
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:57,818
But I could already be infected.

574
00:41:57,852 --> 00:41:58,953
You've opened the door.

575
00:41:58,986 --> 00:42:00,721
You've let this in.

576
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:02,289
Stephen, what if it's true?

577
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:05,226
- I want your phone.
- Dad, please!

578
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,660
Give it to me!

579
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:09,830
- And yours too.
- I don't have a phone.

580
00:42:09,864 --> 00:42:11,198
Whatever it is that
you're going online with,

581
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:12,800
I want it and I want it now.

582
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,703
- Dad, please just listen-
- Go get it!

583
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:18,739
What about your computers?

584
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:20,241
- Can you get online with these?
- No.

585
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:21,675
If you're fucking lying to me.

586
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:22,877
I'm not lying.

587
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:23,978
That's it.

588
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,015
My iPad?

589
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:29,717
Sorry.

590
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,986
What about your computer?

591
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:32,920
That's it.

592
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:46,901
- Please listen, Stephen...
- Don't say it.

593
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:48,335
Don't say it, 'cause I
know what you're gonna say.

594
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:50,638
Stephen, please. Please.

595
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:51,839
Stephen.

596
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,710
What if it's true?

597
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:02,049
Standard monitoring protocol.

598
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:03,951
It's gonna start with
a rash behind the ears

599
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:06,087
- and the back of the neck.
- Stephen, please listen to me.

600
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,022
You didn't see how they died!

601
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:10,291
You didn't see how they
fucking looked at me

602
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:11,358
before they tried
to rip their eyes

603
00:43:11,392 --> 00:43:12,827
out of their fucking skulls.

604
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,261
Stephen, calm down.

605
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:16,030
Just take a couple deep breaths.

606
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:17,398
We both saw that text.

607
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:19,333
That person was real.

608
00:43:19,366 --> 00:43:21,969
Yeah, but I could be infected.

609
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,737
How long has this been going on?

610
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:25,873
They say a week, but it
had to be longer, right?

611
00:43:25,906 --> 00:43:27,374
I mean, they've been doing
this behind our back.

612
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,847
- You know what, fuck this.
- No, don't!

613
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,882
Come on, Stephen, we
have talked about this.

614
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,283
We always said that
if the powers that be

615
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:37,685
wanted to take full control,

616
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:39,120
that this is how
they would do it.

617
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:42,389
Maybe, just maybe, this
has been over for months,

618
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,658
and we're stranded out
here, we have no idea

619
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:46,293
what's going on,
how would we know?

620
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:48,329
Control of what?

621
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:50,231
We're just sitting here.

622
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:51,799
Everything's delivered.

623
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:54,001
Nothing's asked of us.

624
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:55,803
I mean, we're not enslaved,
we're just waiting.

625
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:58,305
We're not enslaved?

626
00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:00,207
Stephen, I have a chip
in the back of my neck.

627
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,143
So do you,
we can't leave this place.

628
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:03,711
So we stay safe
until they figure out

629
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:05,346
how to fight this thing.

630
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:08,182
Nobody's figuring out anything!

631
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:09,884
Or they already have, and
just like the kids said,

632
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:11,986
we are just stupid for
going along with this.

633
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,821
Okay, all right, if this
is some big master plan,

634
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,289
what's the point?

635
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,424
I mean,
what are they taking from us?

636
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:19,860
Everything.

637
00:44:21,362 --> 00:44:23,097
Maybe it's just control.

638
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,232
Maybe that's all they want,
because they can do it.

639
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:28,836
Or what if they're just
building an infrastructure

640
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:30,171
that they need and
we're just holding on

641
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:31,906
until they do it for
some new world order.

642
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,774
God knows,
I don't know what it is,

643
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:36,043
but please,
Stephen, listen to me.

644
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:38,245
I have an idea, please.

645
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:39,880
Please.

646
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:41,715
Anna.

647
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:42,850
Please listen to me, listen.

648
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:44,151
Okay.

649
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:45,352
We take the devices
and we hide them

650
00:44:45,386 --> 00:44:47,388
where they won't find them.

651
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:48,789
Okay, and then we'll do
the monitoring protocol

652
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:50,391
just like you said.

653
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:52,059
It's a week, six days.

654
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,864
And if none of us show signs,
then you and I go online,

655
00:44:58,265 --> 00:45:00,367
or just one of us so that the
other one can stay safe, okay?

656
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:04,238
See what's really there.

657
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:06,974
Find out what the
hell is really going on.

658
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:07,908
Just one time.

659
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:11,979
And then we'll do
the monitoring protocol

660
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:14,281
for the person who went
online, and if we're all okay,

661
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:16,250
and if we stay safe,
then we'll know, right?

662
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:17,284
We'll know.

663
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:22,089
Things are starting
to get back to normal.

664
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:25,826
We need to know.

665
00:45:29,363 --> 00:45:30,764
Please, Stephen.

666
00:45:47,815 --> 00:45:49,250
Promise.

667
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:52,853
I won't.

668
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:56,056
This is so dangerous,
what we're about to do.

669
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,125
You know that, right?

670
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,481
- Oh, my God, that was the...?
- Surprise.

671
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:23,117
Holy shit.

672
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,486
Now I know it's not an
original chicken sandwich, but.

673
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,923
I do not care.

674
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:32,359
- Love you guys.
- Love you too.

675
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:34,061
I love this burger.

676
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,035
Hey, not too late.

677
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:42,303
Okay.

678
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:43,871
- Good night.
- Good night.

679
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:45,906
I love you.

680
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:47,575
I love you too.

681
00:46:47,609 --> 00:46:49,209
Do you wanna see
what I'm building?

682
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:51,245
I'm tired, Bub.

683
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:52,379
You wanna show me tomorrow?

684
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:53,914
- Sure.
- Okay.

685
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:55,382
I'm excited to see it.

686
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,351
- Night.
- Night, Mom.

687
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:12,399
Not too late, okay?

688
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:13,967
I'm pretty tired.

689
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:16,036
- Seriously.
- I know.

690
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,404
Dinner was awesome.

691
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:19,973
I'm glad you liked it.

692
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:21,141
It was true.

693
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,976
What we said before.

694
00:47:24,612 --> 00:47:26,180
Well, we'll figure it out, okay?

695
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,549
I just don't wanna talk
about it right now.

696
00:47:27,582 --> 00:47:29,016
Yeah.

697
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,287
You sound really good.

698
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,988
Thank you.

699
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:37,958
- Night.
- Good night.

700
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:19,446
What day is it today?

701
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,683
- Thursday.
- Do you know the date?

702
00:51:21,716 --> 00:51:23,551
I don't know the date.

703
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:29,423
I don't know the date either.

704
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:30,658
Me either.

705
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:33,260
What did you have
for dinner last night?

706
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:34,796
Burger and fries.

707
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:38,265
Can you recall one
detail about the dinner?

708
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,101
You and Dad were smiling.

709
00:51:42,604 --> 00:51:44,371
Who gave the Gettysburg Address?

710
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:45,640
Lincoln.

711
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:47,875
Count backwards from 10 to one.

712
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:49,677
Ten.
Nine.

713
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,613
Eight.
Seven.

714
00:51:51,646 --> 00:51:53,548
Six.
Five.

715
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:55,482
Four.
Three.

716
00:51:55,516 --> 00:51:57,652
Two.
One.

717
00:51:57,685 --> 00:51:59,654
- What day is it?
- Thursday.

718
00:52:00,855 --> 00:52:03,423
Who gave the Gettysburg Address?

719
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:04,592
Lincoln.

720
00:52:04,626 --> 00:52:06,159
Count backwards from 10 to one.

721
00:52:06,193 --> 00:52:07,662
Ten.
Nine.

722
00:52:07,695 --> 00:52:09,597
Eight.
Seven.

723
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:11,599
- Six.
- Five.

724
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,233
Four.
Three.

725
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:16,403
Sorry, two.
One.

726
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:17,404
Zero.

727
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:35,550
You scared me.

728
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,618
I'm sorry.

729
00:53:37,652 --> 00:53:40,888
I got this weird ingrown
hair on the back of my neck.

730
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:43,457
Well, jeez, I hope you live.

731
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:45,660
Oh, I think I can soldier on.

732
00:53:48,696 --> 00:53:50,363
I'm going up.
You coming?

733
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:53,835
No, I think I'm
gonna have a drink.

734
00:53:53,868 --> 00:53:55,402
Feel like having a drink.
Do you want one?

735
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:57,572
No, I'm tired.

736
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:59,707
We could get drunk, fool around.

737
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:03,511
I will definitely
take a rain check.

738
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:05,580
Okay.

739
00:54:05,613 --> 00:54:06,748
I'll be up in a minute.

740
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:07,982
Come tuck me in.

741
00:54:08,015 --> 00:54:10,350
You know, you won't be asleep
by the time I get up there.

742
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:12,620
Just a night cap.

743
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:15,056
All right.

744
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:16,591
Well, don't be long.

745
00:54:16,624 --> 00:54:17,992
I won't.

746
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:07,775
Steve?

747
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:10,578
Shh.

748
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:11,712
I hear the dog.

749
00:55:12,713 --> 00:55:14,749
I think she's out in the woods.

750
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:16,617
What, what?

751
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:18,085
What's happening?

752
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,787
Gotta go check.

753
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:21,923
Go back to sleep.

754
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:24,058
You know, I could come
with you, if you like.

755
00:55:24,091 --> 00:55:26,326
No, not yet.

756
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:29,797
Okay.

757
00:55:33,568 --> 00:55:34,569
Hmm.

758
00:56:52,914 --> 00:56:54,081
Mom?

759
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:57,018
Hey Bubba.

760
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:58,451
You okay?

761
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:04,625
I can't find your father.

762
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,829
Well, it's been a while now.

763
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,830
What?

764
00:57:11,532 --> 00:57:12,900
Don't you remember?

765
00:57:12,934 --> 00:57:14,568
Remember what?

766
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:17,571
Dad's gone.

767
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:20,608
He's dead.

768
00:57:21,242 --> 00:57:23,077
It's been six months.

769
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,146
Why would you say that?

770
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,950
Because it's true.

771
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:29,984
Remember?

772
00:57:31,252 --> 00:57:33,087
That's why we're here.

773
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:36,157
He started acting
really strange.

774
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,559
He started forgetting things,
he started

775
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:41,529
wandering around
the apartment at night.

776
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:44,231
He took apart the
kitchen shelves.

777
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:50,071
You called the hospital and
they came and took him away.

778
00:57:53,207 --> 00:57:55,609
We haven't seen him since.

779
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:00,247
You brought us here
because you thought

780
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:02,216
it was safer than Boston.

781
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:06,954
- To see if we'd show signs.
- Monitoring protocol.

782
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:10,925
You remember, right?

783
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,159
Yeah.

784
00:58:13,894 --> 00:58:16,931
Do you know what day it is?

785
00:58:16,964 --> 00:58:17,965
Tuesday.

786
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:21,268
I'm worried about you.

787
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:23,504
Do you need anything, Mom?

788
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:26,674
I need your dad.

789
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:28,576
What?

790
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:29,944
I just feel bad.

791
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:33,114
No, I'm okay, I'm good.

792
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:40,755
Okay.

793
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:55,202
Mom?

794
00:58:58,372 --> 00:59:00,241
- Mom?
- Yeah.

795
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:02,910
47 is the answer, right?

796
00:59:02,943 --> 00:59:05,646
47, that's really good, Wyatt.

797
00:59:08,749 --> 00:59:10,251
You okay?

798
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:12,653
Yeah, I'm just feeling a
little tired, that's all.

799
00:59:12,686 --> 00:59:16,257
We can do
this later if you want.

800
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,826
Yeah, I think I'll...

801
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:21,762
Yeah, I think I'm
gonna go take a nap.

802
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:24,298
You hungry?
Can I make you some lunch?

803
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:27,034
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

804
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:28,169
Okay.

805
01:00:33,234 --> 01:00:35,136
- Don't come any closer.
- I'm not, I'm not.

806
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:38,172
I'm standing right here.

807
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:40,808
- Do you have any antibiotics?
- What?

808
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:42,376
Antibiotics.

809
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:44,211
No, we don't have
any antibiotics.

810
01:00:44,245 --> 01:00:45,312
I need...

811
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:46,981
My boy.

812
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:50,017
I left to get
antibiotics, right?

813
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,385
That's why I left.

814
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:53,654
No, we don't have anything.

815
01:00:55,022 --> 01:00:57,024
You're the one with the dog?

816
01:00:57,057 --> 01:00:59,193
What?

817
01:00:59,226 --> 01:01:01,695
Yeah, I hear him sometimes,
far off.

818
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,666
I haven't heard him in a while.

819
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:09,069
I'm sorry.

820
01:01:10,905 --> 01:01:13,841
I can't remember the last time
I've spoken to someone else.

821
01:01:13,874 --> 01:01:16,810
We don't have anything
that we can spare.

822
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:21,916
How did you get out?

823
01:01:29,757 --> 01:01:31,258
I can set you free too.

824
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:33,961
Quick, you won't feel anything,
I promise.

825
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:35,296
Stephen!

826
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:37,031
- Stephen!
- Hey!

827
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:38,399
It's okay.

828
01:01:38,432 --> 01:01:41,235
I'm sorry.
God bless.

829
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:44,138
Stay safe.

830
01:01:44,171 --> 01:01:45,372
Stay safe.

831
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:08,729
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

832
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:39,159
Hey, Bub.

833
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:43,130
- Hey.
- Hey.

834
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,369
Do you wanna see
what I'm building?

835
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:50,572
Sure.

836
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:54,908
Okay. Well it's
mostly finished by now,

837
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:58,812
but this was just some
random thing I came up with.

838
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:04,118
One thing I'm most proud
of is that the cockpit

839
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:08,289
comes out, like here,
like you can open this,

840
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:11,425
and you can slide
the cockpit like this,

841
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:15,095
and you can get the pilot
out, but you can also...

842
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:31,626
Stephen!

843
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:52,112
Stephen?

844
01:06:58,753 --> 01:07:00,287
Stephen.

845
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:23,477
Stephen!

846
01:07:33,655 --> 01:07:35,389
Stephen!

847
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:37,457
Stephen!

848
01:08:02,517 --> 01:08:04,418
Stephen!

849
01:09:20,862 --> 01:09:22,229
Stephen.

850
01:10:11,946 --> 01:10:13,681
Hello!
Yes, we are here.

851
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:15,750
This is the Witten family.

852
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:17,919
M-A-6-3-9-6-4.

853
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:24,759
This is Anna Witten,
identification A-W-3-9-4-7-1.

854
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:25,727
The others are here.

855
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,528
Please, please wait.

856
01:10:27,562 --> 01:10:29,797
Sean.
Sean, it's the call.

857
01:10:29,831 --> 01:10:31,498
Sean?
Wyatt.

858
01:10:33,034 --> 01:10:34,501
Wyatt?

859
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:49,550
Sean Witten,
identification S-W-3-9-4-7-3.

860
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:51,318
Where's Wyatt?

861
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,488
Why are you hanging up?

862
01:10:54,522 --> 01:10:56,289
We need to get your
brother and your father.

863
01:10:56,323 --> 01:10:57,792
We're not gonna have
enough food. Hello?

864
01:10:57,825 --> 01:10:58,793
- It's just us.
- Hello?

865
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:01,729
It's just us, Mom.

866
01:11:04,532 --> 01:11:06,466
Why did you hang up the phone?

867
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,735
They're here in
this house somewhere.

868
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:09,670
They are somewhere here.

869
01:11:09,704 --> 01:11:11,506
Mom, you're scaring me.

870
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:12,940
Did you do this?

871
01:11:12,974 --> 01:11:14,374
What?

872
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:18,646
Just tell me what's going on.

873
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:21,348
There's nothing going on.
It's just been us for months.

874
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:23,316
You're lying.

875
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,086
- Why are you lying?
- Mom.

876
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:27,088
What day is it?

877
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:28,455
No, I remember.

878
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:31,324
I remember...

879
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,429
With your father, I was
playing a game, and Wyatt.

880
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:38,398
Wyatt.

881
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:41,836
He was showing me his building,
he was building Legos.

882
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:43,704
If you try to remember,
if you try and fight it,

883
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:45,438
that helps.

884
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:46,808
They say that if you try
to hold onto something

885
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:50,077
that feels real to you,
you can beat it.

886
01:11:51,746 --> 01:11:52,814
Are you real?

887
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:55,348
Yes, Mom.

888
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,518
And Wyatt and Dad...

889
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:00,521
You weren't feeling well.

890
01:12:00,555 --> 01:12:01,923
You couldn't tell
if you were stressed

891
01:12:01,956 --> 01:12:03,958
or if you were getting
sick, so we came down

892
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:06,359
to the summer home.

893
01:12:06,393 --> 01:12:08,395
You made me drive, remember?

894
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:11,699
I was afraid to, but you
guided me the whole way.

895
01:12:11,732 --> 01:12:13,634
You remember that?

896
01:12:13,668 --> 01:12:14,735
Yeah.

897
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:16,637
Yeah, I remember.

898
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:18,706
It's just been us.

899
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:23,978
I'm so sorry.

900
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:26,013
Why are you sorry?

901
01:12:26,047 --> 01:12:27,648
Because I...

902
01:12:30,785 --> 01:12:32,419
Have I paid enough
attention to you?

903
01:12:32,452 --> 01:12:34,889
Yeah.
Mom, God, yes.

904
01:12:34,922 --> 01:12:36,591
I'm fine.

905
01:12:36,624 --> 01:12:37,792
I love you.

906
01:12:37,825 --> 01:12:38,893
I love you too.

907
01:12:47,568 --> 01:12:48,603
You okay?

908
01:12:50,171 --> 01:12:52,139
Could watch a movie or
play a game or something.

909
01:12:52,173 --> 01:12:53,440
No...

910
01:12:55,076 --> 01:12:57,178
I'm okay, it's okay.

911
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,013
Okay.

912
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:02,850
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
go lay down for a minute.

913
01:13:02,884 --> 01:13:04,151
Okay.

914
01:13:04,952 --> 01:13:06,721
I'll cook you dinner soon.

915
01:13:06,754 --> 01:13:08,656
We have a lot of
nice things for dinner.

916
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:09,924
Okay.

917
01:13:09,957 --> 01:13:11,592
Call you in a bit.

918
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:15,162
<i>Just leaves us three.</i>

919
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,064
<i>Mr. Clayton, I think
we should take a break</i>

920
01:13:17,098 --> 01:13:18,933
<i>for five minutes.</i>

921
01:13:18,966 --> 01:13:20,968
<i>Tempers seem to be
running a little high.</i>

922
01:13:21,002 --> 01:13:23,638
<i>Aw, come on a minute, I was
just starting to do good.</i>

923
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:16,417
<i>Hello?</i>

924
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:19,521
<i>Hello?</i>

925
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:22,122
<i>Anybody there?</i>

926
01:20:24,325 --> 01:20:26,460
<i>Hello?</i>

927
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:28,896
<i>All right, I'm gonna sign off.</i>

928
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:33,167
<i>Anna?</i>

929
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,169
Stephen.

930
01:20:35,202 --> 01:20:37,237
<i>Anna, where are you?</i>

931
01:20:37,271 --> 01:20:39,006
<i>- Are you at the hospital?</i>
- No, I'm here.

932
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:40,874
I'm at the summer house.
Where are you?

933
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:45,479
<i>The summer house.</i>

934
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:47,281
<i>We're at the summer house.</i>

935
01:20:47,314 --> 01:20:48,516
<i>Where are you?</i>

936
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:50,317
I'm here.
I'm at the summer house.

937
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:54,254
<i>I don't understand. We're here.</i>

938
01:20:54,288 --> 01:20:56,123
<i>Me and the boys, we're here
at the summer house.</i>

939
01:20:56,156 --> 01:20:57,257
<i>Where are you?</i>

940
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:58,959
Are you okay?

941
01:20:58,992 --> 01:21:00,361
<i>Is this some kind of joke?
Wyatt!</i>

942
01:21:01,629 --> 01:21:03,263
<i>- Wyatt!</i>
- Stephen.

943
01:21:03,297 --> 01:21:04,465
<i>Wyatt, did you do
something to the computer?</i>

944
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:05,933
Stephen.

945
01:21:05,966 --> 01:21:07,501
<i>- Well, come look at this!</i>
- Stephen!

946
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:09,136
<i>He's coming,
just hang on one second.</i>

947
01:21:09,169 --> 01:21:10,070
I love you.

948
01:21:11,506 --> 01:21:13,140
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

949
01:21:13,173 --> 01:21:15,008
<i>You're supposed to be...</i>

950
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:18,580
<i>Where are you calling from?</i>

951
01:21:18,613 --> 01:21:21,482
- I love you.
<i>- No, no, no, wait, wait.</i>

952
01:21:21,516 --> 01:21:23,217
<i>Everything's okay here.</i>

953
01:21:24,351 --> 01:21:25,419
No, no, no, no, no, no!

954
01:21:25,452 --> 01:21:27,254
Stephen!

955
01:21:27,287 --> 01:21:29,323
Stephen!

956
01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:34,061
Oh, my God.

957
01:21:34,696 --> 01:21:37,264
What's happening...

958
01:22:02,456 --> 01:22:04,291
Fuck you.

959
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:48,368
Wyatt.

960
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:55,142
Wyatt?

961
01:22:56,477 --> 01:23:00,648
Wyatt?

962
01:23:03,116 --> 01:23:04,485
Honey, honey.

963
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:09,156
Wyatt.

964
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:11,593
Honey?

965
01:25:52,754 --> 01:25:53,955
You're not real.

966
01:25:53,988 --> 01:25:55,455
I remember.

967
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:58,626
We're right here.

968
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,761
I remember!

969
01:26:00,962 --> 01:26:02,362
I remember!

970
01:26:03,631 --> 01:26:05,265
I remember!

971
01:27:33,821 --> 01:27:35,590
Hold on,
gimme a second, I gotta get on.

972
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,494
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, there she is.

973
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:41,495
How you feel, baby?

974
01:27:45,099 --> 01:27:46,634
Hey Mom.

975
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:48,368
But yeah, no, so he's gonna say,

976
01:27:48,401 --> 01:27:50,071
I don't know what you're saying.

977
01:27:50,104 --> 01:27:51,506
I can't, Wyatt can
probably explain it better.

978
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:52,774
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Wyatt!

979
01:27:55,643 --> 01:27:56,778
You look like you're
feeling better.

980
01:27:59,614 --> 01:28:01,082
The doctor said was
gonna be tough to talk

981
01:28:01,115 --> 01:28:02,449
for a couple of days.

982
01:28:05,086 --> 01:28:07,354
Was thinking about
steaks tonight.

983
01:28:07,387 --> 01:28:09,056
What do you think about steaks?
