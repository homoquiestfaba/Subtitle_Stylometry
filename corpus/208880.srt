1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,956
Wheesht! <i>Wheesht!</i>

2
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,755
Give me your musket.

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,037
Boys, wake up! Wake up!
Quickly! Quickly!

4
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,479
Get out of bed!

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,353
Go, go! Bring the Gregorach!

6
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,153
I've come for the outlaw
Robert McGregor.

7
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,590
If you think he'd be lying
in his bed waiting for you,

8
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,995
you're more of a fool than you look.

9
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,872
Ohh!

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,319
Search the outsheds.

11
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,351
Burn them. Kill the stock.

12
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,552
You best stand aside,
Mistress McGregor.

13
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,350
You don't ask a whore. You make her.

14
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,235
Aah! No!

15
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,393
Aagh! No!

16
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,834
No! No!

17
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,111
Do you want yours now, Killearn?

18
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,238
Think of yourself as the scabbard

19
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,079
and me the sword, Mistress McGregor.

20
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,471
And a fine fit you were, too.

21
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,876
I will think of you dead

22
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,956
until my husband makes you so.

23
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,276
And then I will think on you no more.

24
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,352
Indeed.

25
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,994
Such a man as he
will need to see blood on his blade

26
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,475
before honour is satisfied.

27
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,712
Tell him Archibald Cunningham
is at his service.

28
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,676
What are you gawking at?

29
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,950
Have you never been to war before?

30
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,312
Oh, you're a warrior, Archie,
and no mistake.

31
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,951
If she doesn't come out, Archie,

32
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,752
there will be a reckoning.

33
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,792
Shagging her's one thing,
burning her's another.

34
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,434
She'll be out. She's a hater, that one.

35
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,515
Hmm.

36
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,596
<i>There she is.</i>

37
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,876
Back to the boat!

38
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,599
They say it's not a sin

39
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,790
if you don't take pleasure in it.

40
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,439
Come on! Come on!

41
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,071
Come on! Come on!

42
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,318
I am Alasdair Roy McGregor!

43
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,836
Come on! Come on!

44
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,196
Is that the best you can do?

45
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,838
Come on!

46
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,515
Come on! Come on! Come...

47
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,790
Mary, are you hurt?

48
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,478
Did they wound you?

49
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,276
Oh, Mary.

50
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,551
Oh... Mary.

51
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,676
What have they done?

52
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,195
We will avenge you.

53
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,437
Rob will kill every last one of them.

54
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,878
He will not know. Rob will not know.

55
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,275
Mary, Rob must know.

56
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,709
He will not! He will not!

57
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,274
No! He will not!

58
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,517
I will not tell him, and you will not.

59
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,870
Do you hear me, Alasdair McGregor?

60
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,956
It is what they want!

61
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,674
It is what the Englishman wants!

62
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,756
It is his plan!

63
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,030
You swear it to me.

64
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,593
Swear it!

65
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,676
I cannot! I cannot!

66
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,190
You can! If I can bear it to be done,

67
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,276
you can bear to be silent!

68
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,675
Now, you swear it! Swear it.

69
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,030
Swear it. Swear it.

70
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,195
Swear it!

71
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,435
I swear. I swear.

72
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,073
I swear.

73
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,029
And I will hold you to it.

74
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,756
Mark me.

75
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,228
But of McGregor himself, still no word?

76
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,191
We will have him soon enough.

77
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,834
I have set such an affront
to his highland honour

78
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,598
that he will come to redeem it.

79
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,950
Very well.

80
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,355
See to it that I am not mocked,

81
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,156
and in the meanwhile, make my claim
against these acres in Lomondside

82
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,236
for the debt he owes.

83
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,876
Still no word of this man of McGregor's?

84
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,433
He who took the coin?

85
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,839
No, My Lord, not a word.

86
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,188
Nor will there be.

87
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,869
This was McGregor's ploy,
to take the money and blame another.

88
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,992
His man is hid,...
and Your Lordship's money spent.

89
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,519
I wager it.

90
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,672
You have a rare grasp
of the conspirator's mind, Archibald.

91
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,916
You are to be commended on it.

92
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,471
He sees through it, Archie.
I know him and his gibes.

93
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,239
You think it would count against us
if he knew?

94
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,033
He has another 300 acres
to plant and prune

95
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,596
and all for the price
of a paltry 1 ,000 Scotch pounds,

96
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,597
a fair price by any reckoning.

97
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,755
Archie, sir!

98
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,711
I must speak with you.

99
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,198
I am dismissed from service
on account of my state.

100
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,470
And what is your state, pretty Betty?

101
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,716
You know well. I'm with your child.

102
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,593
And he... this one...
has made report of it.

103
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,793
My report did nothing
your belly wouldn't announce on its own.

104
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,873
Archie, what am I to do?

105
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,752
Root it out.

106
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,348
If Killearn
does not know a crone with a twig,

107
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,515
I miss my guess.

108
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,198
It's gone too far for that.

109
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,596
Then it will not be
the first bastard born in Scotland.

110
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,995
Archie, I love you.

111
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,797
Love is a dunghill, Betty,

112
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,480
and I am but a cock
that climbs upon it to crow.

113
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,233
No!

114
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,277
It's a sore thing
they have done to us... Mary and me.

115
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,675
Far past any wrong I had expected,

116
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,756
even from such as Montrose.

117
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,791
He must pay for it, Rob!

118
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,717
Else what are we?

119
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,432
Oh, pay he will

120
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,790
till his teeth squeal.

121
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,876
Think on it, now.

122
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,672
Think on it.

123
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,075
Even if we raised all the McGregors,

124
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,909
we could not, must not,
fight Montrose in open battle.

125
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,999
He has 10, 20 times our numbers

126
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,714
and the strength of the Crown
to back him.

127
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,398
There is honour here.

128
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,398
You were wronged. Mary is wronged.

129
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,354
Honour will be satisfied.
You know me well enough.

130
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,276
But consider this.

131
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,754
One house burned,

132
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,836
cattle killed,

133
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,349
but none are dead, none injured.

134
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,799
Rob is right.

135
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,796
Rob is right!

136
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,390
It is not within our reach
to harm such as Montrose.

137
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,556
Wheesht! Wheesht! Wheesht!

138
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,709
Wheesht! Wheesht!

139
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,353
I will harm him. Never fear.

140
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,198
Aye! Aye!

141
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,110
The tenderest part of the Marquis
is his purse.

142
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,476
We'll hurt him there.

143
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,475
Thieve his cattle. Steal his rent.

144
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,637
Rent and cattle,
until his coffers are bled.

145
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,398
Aye! Aye!

146
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,592
Wait! Wait!

147
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,949
Wheesht! Wheesht! Morag.

148
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,275
We have not heard Mary on it,

149
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,870
and in truth,
she was the one most affronted.

150
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,878
Rob is right.

151
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,309
What cannot be helped must be endured.

152
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,717
It will look more like itself
when the sun shines.

153
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,070
Eh, lads?

154
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,759
When we have our bed in it
and us in our bed,

155
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,836
it will seem home enough.

156
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,797
All right,

157
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,150
play can wait, we have work to do.

158
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,478
Duncan.

159
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,356
I should have been with you, Mary.

160
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,994
It wasn't right that I was in the hills.

161
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,876
Then you would be dead now.

162
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,719
No. They would have taken me
to the tolbooth.

163
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,035
No. I think you would be dead.

164
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,036
I could not hear all of it,

165
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,596
but Killearn talked of money
that Archie might take.

166
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,870
This is Cunningham, this Archie?

167
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,516
He is wild... but it's not him.

168
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,392
It's that Killearn.

169
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,192
He has the devil in him.

170
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,751
Tell me about this money.

171
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,757
Did you hear a sum spoken?

172
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,589
Archie said it would be
the easiest £1 ,000 he'd ever earned.

173
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,508
The only pity that it would be
in Scots and not English pounds.

174
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,949
How did he mean to earn this £1 ,000?

175
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,798
I know not,

176
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,912
save that Killearn said
no trace must be left.

177
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,990
My husband will appreciate
that you came with this word.

178
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,028
Will you take some supper
and rest, Betty?

179
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,071
For you look ill-used.

180
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,272
Oh, I'm no worse used than I deserve,
Mistress McGregor.

181
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,118
For I have a bastard's bastard in me,

182
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,992
and no home for him when he comes out.

183
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,838
Then we better feed you,

184
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,428
or he won't have the strength to try it.

185
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,632
Oh, lass, lass, lass.

186
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,716
Bear up now.

187
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,471
Your bairn will have you,
and you will have it.

188
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,276
But I will not have Archie.

189
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,436
Mistress McGregor, I love him

190
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,436
even after all.

191
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,914
Oh, is that not a worse sin than any other?

192
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,672
No, Betty.

193
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,672
Love is never a sin,

194
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,756
only the lack of it.

195
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,319
I knew it.

196
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,317
I knew they plotted against us.

197
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,715
Damn them that they carried it through.

198
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,354
I will have them before the Assize,
Killearn and Cunningham.

199
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,993
Montrose, too, if he were part of it.

200
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,792
Such men will admit this

201
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,879
because Betty Sturrock,
with her belly under her chin, says so?

202
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,276
- What's her belly to do with it?
- She's carrying the Englishman's child.

203
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,789
They'll call her a whore come for revenge.

204
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,797
She'll speak the truth.

205
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,629
To these men,
the truth is but a lie undiscovered.

206
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,671
I will have justice!

207
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,597
Alan McDonald is dead, woman.

208
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,995
Then take your case to the Duke of Argyll.

209
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,872
He bears Montrose no favour.

210
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,560
You hold great store
by wolves of different shades.

211
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,992
- They're all alike at lambing.
- You will have nothing but your own way!

212
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,599
I tell you,
Killearn and Cunningham

213
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,154
will not be condemned
before any Assize on Betty's word.

214
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,235
Aye.

215
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,749
But I know one that will condemn them,

216
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,916
and I'll have them before it,

217
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,678
or I'm not Robert McGregor.

218
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,470
The Englishman will never find him.

219
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,875
McGregor knows
every rock and track

220
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,434
and can walk faster
than the troopers can ride.

221
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,993
Look, put me onto His Lordship

222
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,759
as a man who knows
the highways and byways.

223
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,790
I'll find him. I swear it.

224
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,876
On your feet, Killearn.

225
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,479
You and I have business.

226
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,716
Now is your moment, Guthrie.

227
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,070
It would stand well with His Lordship.

228
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,316
This is not your fight, Guthrie.

229
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,799
And if I make it my fight?

230
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,356
Then give Tam Sibbald my regards
when you see him.

231
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,029
Fight him well
and you'll win His Lordship's favour.

232
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,479
I warrant it.

233
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,555
Aaagh!

234
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,236
Please, please, please don't kill me.

235
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,032
Don't kill me. It wasn't me.

236
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,229
Outside.

237
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,478
It's him the lass wants revenge on...
Cunningham.

238
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,640
And I grant it, he treated her sore.

239
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,274
If you harm me,

240
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,799
His Lordship will hunt you down,

241
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,955
and you know it.

242
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,559
I'm past caring, Killearn.

243
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,876
The lantern.

244
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,991
Go back, get Betty,
and we'll try him before morning.

245
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,075
Now.

246
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,312
Inside.

247
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,388
- Mary! Mary!
- Who is it?

248
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,078
It's Alasdair.

249
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,918
Rob's holding Killearn,

250
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,600
and he wants to see Betty
straight away.

251
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,676
I'll wake her.

252
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,678
Treat her gentle.
She's near the end of her tether.

253
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,748
Where's my father?

254
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,833
Wheesht.

255
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,796
Are the soldiers coming?

256
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,797
You two should be sleeping.

257
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,869
Stay there!

258
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,515
Get my knife!

259
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,793
Mary.

260
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,114
Where's the girl?

261
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,678
Betty Sturrock
hanged herself in our shed.

262
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,358
She made me bring her.

263
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,072
I made him bring me

264
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,589
for I have dealings with this Killearn.

265
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,518
Me and Betty Sturrock
and Betty Sturrock's child,

266
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,551
the three of us will bring it out of him.

267
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,791
No. This is no matter for him.

268
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,876
This is between us.

269
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,995
As I am your wife, Robert,
I will have my way in this, I will.

270
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,594
Betty!

271
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,199
Is that you?

272
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,276
Betty is dead.

273
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,276
She killed herself this night

274
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,231
and her unborn with her.

275
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,356
Mistress McGregor.

276
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,469
So the poor girl is dead.

277
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,433
Spare me your hypocrisy, Killearn.

278
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,790
You are as much her murderer as she,

279
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,956
you and that Englishman.

280
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,991
I had no part in her child

281
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,039
any more than that matter
at Craigrostan.

282
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,676
You stood and gloated.

283
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,076
You did all with your eyes.

284
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,756
You have not told him.

285
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,871
You think me such a puppet

286
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,798
that I would put my husband's head
in a noose

287
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,480
fashioned from my own dishonour?

288
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,192
You have a proposal for me.

289
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,878
I can tell.

290
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,355
You will sign your name to a statement

291
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,789
telling how you slew Alan McDonald,

292
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,832
stole my husband's money,
burned our property.

293
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,837
Before a judge you will sign it.

294
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,032
And let them hang me
in the tolbooth for my trouble?

295
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,993
No great inducement,
Mistress McGregor.

296
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,348
When it is signed,

297
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,597
you may go where you will...
where you can.

298
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,676
I shall not soon forget,

299
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,153
Mary,

300
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,156
the last time I saw you.

301
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,037
How nobly you walked
from that burning,

302
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,673
like a queen.

303
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,597
You will sign it or else.

304
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,676
Or else what?

305
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,680
You'll tell Rob
how Cunningham used ya?

306
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,912
I have another picture

307
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,792
not so noble

308
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,957
of you stood in Lomond Water,

309
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,878
washing between your legs.

310
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,353
Hmm?

311
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,593
I wondered many a time
since that morning,

312
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,790
did you wash Archie out of you,

313
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,196
or is he still in there,
growing into his father?

314
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,915
He is.

315
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,036
He is!

316
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,436
Well, I have a proposal
for you, Mistress McGregor.

317
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,757
Persuade your man that
Cunningham alone killed his man

318
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,757
and kept the money entirely,

319
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,509
and I will not speak
of what you have

320
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,391
inside ya.

321
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,871
Rob would be hard pressed
to love such a bastard,

322
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,989
would he not?

323
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,036
But you know the saying, Mary.

324
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,515
'Tis a wise father
knows his own child.

325
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,078
And if you'll not say anything,
neither will I.

326
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,236
You have my word on it.

327
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,275
Aagh!

328
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,715
St...

329
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,393
Stop!

330
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,194
Stop!

331
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,436
Oh! Cut... me!

332
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,148
Ah! Stop!

333
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,478
She cut me.

334
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,828
The bitch cut me!

335
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,038
Mary, are you hurt? Hmm?

336
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,718
Are you hurt?

337
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,111
What have you done, woman?

338
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,195
Ow!

339
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,152
Am I cut bad?

340
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,555
Am I cut bad?!

341
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,756
Not bad enough for me.

342
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,279
I mean, my God,
what made you do such a thing?

343
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,597
I have as much cause
as you in this. More.

344
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,914
He must confess.

345
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,598
He will never confess.

346
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,154
Betty was right.
He has the devil in him.

347
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,953
He's my prisoner.
Don't you understand?

348
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,799
Oh, Robert,
there are things you must know,

349
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,150
things I have to tell you.

350
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,594
So?

351
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,835
Tell me.

352
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,557
There was...

353
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,595
Well?

354
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,156
He's dead, Rob.
I could do nothing.

355
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,476
Oh, Robert, listen to me now.

356
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,670
There's no time for talk now.

357
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,030
Alasdair, can you sink a man?

358
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,115
Aye.

359
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,037
Cut the wind out of him,
put a rock in his belly,

360
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,957
take him out where it's deep.

361
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,672
Montrose will scour us out.

362
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,360
We must make sure
you and the lads are safe.

363
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,789
Deep, mind you!

364
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,354
I am mocked by this rogue

365
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,596
who you took to deliver me broken.

366
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,792
'Tis myself who will be broken
if these raids go on.

367
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,508
Now my factor is abducted
in plain view.

368
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,596
Am I gone mad?

369
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,948
Your Lordship,...

370
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,274
Do not,

371
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,278
do not, I say, speak in my stead.

372
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,157
There's something here
that I do not see.

373
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,798
Killearn and you have
some hand in matters

374
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,433
that is hid from sight.

375
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,551
This tells me that you are in cash,

376
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,716
yet I know you are without means.

377
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,038
Gaming, Your Lordship.

378
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,832
The cards favoured.

379
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,557
Do you take me entirely
for a Whig, sir?!

380
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,030
I care not what you
and that greasy capon have cooked up

381
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,799
but put an end to this impudence
against me.

382
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,593
I am James Graham,
Marquis of Montrose,

383
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,995
and I will not be mocked.

384
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,798
You hear me?

385
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,798
We can't let them burn,
loot, and ride away.

386
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,238
We should hit them, Rob.

387
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,999
Cunningham is there.
He's the one that...

388
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,076
I know who he is.

389
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,350
Have you no thought
to avenge Mary for that?

390
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,153
There's 30 or more men.
They'd ride us down like sheep.

391
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,316
Alasdair McGregor is no sheep.

392
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,318
ColI's right. We can do nothing.

393
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,833
Damn the wee fool!

394
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,030
Scatter! Find your own way home!

395
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,518
Heh heh heh!

396
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,709
There they are!

397
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,398
After him!

398
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,953
I want McGregor!

399
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,031
Fire, you fools! Fire!

400
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,515
I hit one of them.

401
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,596
And it will cost us, I'm thinking.

402
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,755
Yah!

403
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,199
Move!

404
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,197
I want McGregor!

405
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,959
God's curse on you
for a brother, Alasdair.

406
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,908
I want McGregor!

407
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,471
You're getting too old
for the wars, Rob, eh?

408
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,995
Agh!

409
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,954
Come on!

410
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,590
Fire! Fire, you fools! Fire!

411
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,954
Put me down.

412
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,069
Shut your mouth.

413
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,590
Run, Rob, run!

414
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,917
Go on, Rob! Run for yourself!

415
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,150
I want McGregor!

416
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,236
I want McGregor! After him!

417
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,953
Be quiet!

418
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,232
Hold still. Hold still.

419
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,471
Knocked the breath out of me.

420
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,828
Rob,

421
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,552
I can't feel my legs.

422
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,636
Are they there?

423
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,514
Aye, aye. Your legs are fine.

424
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,436
Forgive me, Rob,

425
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,516
for I can't forgive myself.

426
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,596
Save your breath, lad.

427
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,757
I couldn't have saved her, Rob.

428
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,472
They were done with Mary
before I reached her.

429
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,750
She made me swear not to tell you.

430
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,313
I'm sorry.

431
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,032
Done what with Mary?

432
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,115
Done what?

433
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,639
She said...

434
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,758
She said if she could bear it...

435
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,232
What of Mary, Alasdair?

436
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,191
Rob, I can't see.

437
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,469
I'm here, Alasdair.

438
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,952
What of Mary? What of it?

439
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,116
They...

440
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,719
They violated her.

441
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,516
Alasdair,

442
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,392
who did this?

443
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,112
The mist is clearing.

444
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,514
Be ready.

445
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,752
Be ready!

446
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,394
You men, search upwards!

447
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,675
Uh!

448
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,438
Follow!

449
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,029
Heeyah!

450
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,915
Where is he? Over there!

451
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,275
Get the horse!

452
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,950
Well, well...

453
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,356
The great McGregor
come to hand at last.

454
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,358
Well, how does it seem to you tonight,
McGregor?

455
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,599
Is God's great plan
for us all to your liking?

456
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,152
''Broken but not dead''
was His Lordship's request.

457
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,748
I will do my part
if you will do yours

458
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,678
and not die before
the bridge at Glen Orchy.

459
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,436
Tell me,

460
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,312
what did you do
with that bag of guts, Killearn?

461
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,357
Vex me not, McGregor,

462
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,675
or I shall have you dragged awhile.

463
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,438
I'm a man of my word.

464
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,759
You're a thief, a murderer

465
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,231
and a violator of women.

466
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,593
Ah, I had hoped you'd come to me
long since on that score.

467
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,392
If I had known earlier,

468
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,636
you would have been dead sooner.

469
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,309
I will tell you something
to take with you.

470
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,037
Your wife was far sweeter forced

471
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,593
than many are willing.

472
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,636
In truth, put to it,
I think not all of her objected.

473
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,431
I appreciate the honour you do me,
Mistress McGregor,

474
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,073
in bringing your case.

475
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,668
But from all
I'm acquainted with your husband,

476
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,598
he has earned the enmity
of the Marquis of Montrose

477
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,836
by borrowing money
that he cannot repay

478
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,951
and ever harrying
his stock as blackmail.

479
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,389
There is more to
the matter, your Grace.

480
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,794
I'm sure there is,

481
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,593
but it is not part of mine
to intrude myself,

482
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,995
sensible as I am to your condition.

483
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,316
It's a hard thought,

484
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,396
but men make the quarrels,

485
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,397
and women and weans bear them.

486
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,751
Your Grace, Robert finds himself
in this condition

487
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,075
for taking <i>your</i> part.<i></i>

488
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,033
My part?

489
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,957
What cause had he to do that

490
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,433
and in what manner?

491
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,712
He refused to condemn you
by false witness

492
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,549
when the Marquis asked him
to say you were a Jacobite

493
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,910
to injure your name at Court.

494
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,996
Montrose asked this of him?

495
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,076
In remission of this debt.

496
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,031
But Robert refused.

497
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,632
I did not know
your husband bore me such good will.

498
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,796
Indeed, I think he favours you

499
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,354
no more than any great man.

500
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,838
''As wolves at lambing''

501
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,473
is his word for you all.

502
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,037
It was not done for Your Grace

503
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,156
but for his own honour,

504
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,431
which he holds dearer
than myself or his sons,

505
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,834
his clan or kin,

506
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,755
and for which I have oft chided him.

507
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,917
But it is him and his way,

508
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,629
and were he other,
he would not be Robert Roy McGregor.

509
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,995
He would not come here before you,

510
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,998
nor would he favour me
to do so in his stead,

511
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,636
but I have no choice

512
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,433
unless I give him up
entire to his enemies.

513
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,276
And though I love his honour,

514
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,995
it is but a moon-cast shadow
to the love I bear him.

515
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,113
For the grace of God,

516
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,117
I have his child inside me

517
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,838
and I would have a father for it.

518
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,638
You do your man no dishonour, Mary.

519
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,435
Faith, he is a man
much blessed by fortune.

520
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,230
They have McGregor, My Lord.

521
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,360
Cavalry, halt!

522
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,357
Broken but not dead, Your Lordship,

523
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,913
as you requested.

524
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,156
Ungag him.

525
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,638
So, McGregor,

526
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,910
what have you to say for yourself?

527
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,555
I have been wronged by Your Lordship

528
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,069
and by those who serve him.

529
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,031
<i>You</i> are wronged?<i></i>

530
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,116
You?

531
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,912
If I am not much mistaken,

532
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,396
it is myself that is short £1 ,000,
whose cattle is reived,

533
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,829
and whose factor, Killearn, is abducted.

534
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,838
Then ask this thing here
where your money is

535
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,397
and where he sunk
Alan McDonald after he killed him.

536
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,671
Same accusations
he spat at me, Your Lordship.

537
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,109
Desperate words from a desperate man.

538
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,555
Do you have proofs of these matters?

539
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,512
You have my word on it.

540
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,348
Oh, I think it will take more than that.

541
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,238
Then you have the nature
of this man here.

542
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,511
If Your Lordship cannot
tell what is true

543
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,392
from what is not,

544
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,432
then I fear his judgement
is beyond repair.

545
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,076
Hang him from the bridge.

546
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,750
- McGregor!
- Cut him free!

547
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,633
Bring him back here!

548
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,715
I want him back!

549
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,353
Bring him back here!

550
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,638
I see him!

551
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,036
Right through that gap!

552
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,359
Just through there!

553
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,871
Oh, what a stench!

554
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,040
What a stink! Do you smell this?

555
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,277
Let's get downwind of this.

556
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,996
Is this where we may stay?

557
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,076
Aye, by His Grace's goodness,

558
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,156
under his protection.

559
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,999
- Will Father come here?
- If he can.

560
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,596
No!

561
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,236
Robert?

562
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,076
<i>Robert!</i>

563
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,236
Oh, my Robert!

564
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,796
What have they done with you?

565
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,277
You should have told me, Mary.

566
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,358
Robert, I should have,
but I could not.

567
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,833
Forgive me, my love.

568
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,359
I was wrong.

569
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,232
It was wrong.

570
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,432
No. It was me who was wrong.

571
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,472
You were right when you told me
I must have it my own way.

572
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,636
It's that which brought all this on us.

573
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,355
I should have packed my pride
and given Montrose his way.

574
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,549
No, Robert.

575
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,831
And all this has come on us,
all this you have endured.

576
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,916
Craigrostan would still be ours.

577
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,996
Alasdair and Coll would be alive.

578
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,156
And wrong would have been done you!

579
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,236
And what of the wrong done you,

580
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,679
wrong past bearing?

581
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,358
No, not past bearing.

582
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,232
Not past bearing.

583
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,832
Not if I have my Robert,

584
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,359
and he has himself.

585
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,550
And you would not,

586
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,355
not if you had done
a lesser man's bidding.

587
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,429
Honour is the gift a man gives himself.

588
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,312
You told our boys that.

589
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,709
Would you have stolen from yourself

590
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,229
that what makes you Robert McGregor?

591
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,516
Oh, my Mary.

592
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,389
How fine you are to me.

593
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,636
And you to me.

594
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,830
Oh, Robert, there is more.

595
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,436
What more?

596
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,436
I am carrying a child

597
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,678
and I do not know who is the father.

598
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,836
Ach, Mary.

599
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,837
Mary.

600
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,838
I could not kill it, husband.

601
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,355
It is not the child who needs killing.

602
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,638
This point of honour
might likely kill you, sir.

603
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,716
I have seen the man at work,

604
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,796
and he is no dunce with a blade.

605
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,751
If Your Grace could arrange this,

606
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,872
I would be more beholding to him
than I already am.

607
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,233
Very well.

608
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,157
I will see what I can make of it.

609
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,038
McGregor.

610
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,388
Sir?

611
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,272
He will kill you, McGregor.

612
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,914
I would lose money if I wagered other.

613
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,789
Your Lordship has my permission

614
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,592
to profit what way he may.

615
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,037
I have had a correspondence

616
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,435
from His Grace, the Duke of Argyll.

617
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,632
It would seem that our McGregor
is holed with him.

618
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,035
He offers us a match,

619
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,832
you and the Highlander.

620
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,832
Argyll would recoup his loss
from his last wager.

621
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,596
Bring him on.

622
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,630
You speak, Archibald?

623
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,356
One must never underestimate

624
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,959
the healing power of hatred.

625
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,271
How long must you go, Father?

626
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,992
Just for a while.

627
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,429
Is it business you have with the Duke?

628
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,516
Aye, business.

629
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,755
Boys, have you heard there's going
to be another addition to the family?

630
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,074
Show them where it's hid, Mary.

631
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,436
Is it... inside you?

632
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,837
How does it get out?

633
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,436
The same road it got in.

634
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,436
Robert...

635
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,074
- Robert, what if you don't...
- Wheesht.

636
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,235
No, I cannot.

637
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,429
What if...

638
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,913
Shh.

639
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,436
I cannot.

640
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,396
What if you do not return to us?

641
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,436
If it's a boy, call him Robert.

642
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,436
If a lass,

643
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,432
name her for my love... Mary McGregor.

644
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,197
My man Guthrie was like an ox
at the knacker's yard

645
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,276
under Cunningham's blade.

646
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,198
You will need to be twice as quick
as poor Will.

647
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,639
Tell me, McGregor,

648
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,593
is this matter of honour
concerning your wife?

649
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,438
It's concerning me, Your Grace.

650
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,279
Mr Cunningham and l
have matters outstanding.

651
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,198
She will not thank you
for making her a widow,

652
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,719
honour or no.

653
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,912
Perhaps you'd like
to wager a sum for her maintenance.

654
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,076
If it will help you die any easier,

655
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,838
I'll lay 20 guineas for her.

656
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,712
50 would go further.

657
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,718
By God, but you have a style to you,
McGregor.

658
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,432
I like that.

659
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,913
Aye.

660
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,709
So, what are we to wager
on this outcome, Your Grace?

661
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,592
Guineas again?

662
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,316
I want no part of this.

663
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,829
There are more than champions here.

664
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,030
I think these men hate the other.

665
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,116
Aye.

666
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,276
They are none too fond.

667
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,675
You offered McGregor
amnesty from his debts

668
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,950
if he would lay charges against me.

669
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,233
So, that is how he cozened you

670
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,112
to give him shelter.

671
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,470
Oh, I know the truth when I hear it.

672
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,398
Oh, and here was me thinking that

673
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,750
that was God's gift alone.

674
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,839
Do not think that all sins
go unpunished in this life, Montrose.

675
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,313
Well,

676
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,793
I see one set soon to be paid for.

677
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,156
Will you not take my odds, Argyll?

678
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,840
I give you five on the fop.

679
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,436
I wager you but this:

680
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,311
If McGregor lives,

681
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,829
you will acquit him of all he owes you.

682
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,116
And if he loses?

683
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,917
I will pay his bill.

684
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,919
My factor
will call upon Your Grace's factor.

685
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,830
You are here on a matter of honour.

686
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,758
I am here
to assure you settle it honourably.

687
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,677
There will be no backstabbing.

688
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,836
You will not throw your blades,

689
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,520
nor will you use weapons
other than agreed.

690
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,551
If quarter is asked...

691
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,113
No quarter will be asked.

692
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,276
Or given.

693
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,871
Attend upon your weapons

694
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,116
and commence upon my mark.

695
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,711
Neither asked nor given.

696
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,196
I will hold you to our bargain.

697
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,276
Those wounds will need care.

698
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,992
By Your Grace's leave,

699
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,236
I'll go where it can best be found.

700
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,315
As you will.

701
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,799
I will know who to wager on the next time.

702
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,715
I hope Your Grace will live so long.

703
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,912
Mother! Look!

704
