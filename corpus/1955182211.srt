00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:34,000

1
00:00:01,527 --> 00:00:03,518
''It's true...''

2
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:17,085
Do you want to buy a pickup truck
or van?

3
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:26,321
We drove one
the car in the morning.

4
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:30,567
Honey, this is us
it is too expensive.

5
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:32,842
Do not worry, we have the money.

6
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:40,565
We're not talking about money.
Show me the invoice.

7
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:44,647
What for? Does it really matter,
how much we paid for the car?

8
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:48,879
It is important how much you paid.
Tell me, how much money you want?

9
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:55,678
Lance, you're killing me!
I do not earn a penny on it.

10
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:58,278
Show me the invoice!

11
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:00,687
Are you mad
on the overhead?

12
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:01,287
I know she's out in the
box.

13
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:03,278
In the box is not.

14
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:06,287
I'd figured out what was going on,
if he saw the invoice.

15
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:08,596
I do not know how much
She is standing.

16
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:17,247
This kid - he's white
or color?

17
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:20,927
Do not divorce his canoe,
help better. He asks
Show Invoices.

18
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:25,284
Say, invoice
in seyae in regional
headquarters.

19
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:31,199
There will be more,
than the first time.

20
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:47,527
Please.

21
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:49,927
It is ...
Did you see that?

22
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:53,283
Yes, it is expensive.
You have enough money?

23
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,727
I want to talk
with the owner.

24
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:07,163
With him not to talk about
- He is a moron.

25
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:14,927
To be honest, Lance, I wrung
too much and give little vi.
What about the golden mean?

26
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,999
I taught math,
the middle is not here.

27
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:21,121
Well, maybe not quite
middle.

28
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:25,847
With whom do you ask advice
every now and then?

29
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:27,647
With the boss.

30
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,407
Can I see him?

31
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,398
No.

32
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:36,045
Monthly installments
- Too much ...

33
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,087
Write the amount that
you want.

34
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:42,558
I want to make you feel, want,
so that in three years you have come
us for the new machine.

35
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:45,927
That's how much I
to pay - if you want
I have good news.

36
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:47,918
You fell trees?

37
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,323
Maybe we discuss here
that amount.

38
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:59,727
You endlessly ask
the same thing, and I nazivayu
new price higher than before.

39
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:01,718
But you do not want to give up.

40
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,687
Exactly.

41
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:07,485
I thought we could
reach an agreement.

42
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,837
I want to agree,
vi - no.

43
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:20,598
I think I'll go home.

44
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,447
You know, Lance, I'm more
You do not think the buyer.

45
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:25,438
You have become my friend.

46
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:29,078
And you - mine.

47
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:35,527
Not bad.

48
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:37,518
Yeah, probably.

49
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:38,807
Say now that the mats
on the floor there are another hundred.

50
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:40,047
There's the usual mats.

51
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:41,207
He does not know it.

52
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:44,687
You want to deal
I did not take place due to these
lousy rugs?

53
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:48,447
This guy is biting me
two solid hours. I hardly his

Say, come on.

Jerk!
You gave mats for nothing!

56
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:12,767
I did not mess it
for these carpets.
He would have refused.

57
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:17,079
Garbage! He sat with us
on hook. Go to hell!

58
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:31,121
Fok you! Bald hell!

59

Exactly! Much money!

107
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:13,198
If you are satisfied
minimum wage,
you have nothing to do here!

108
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,598
Eddie, you lose a bet dinner.

109
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:23,927
Well, when it comes Ion,

Okay.

Marco when the dealer
It starts to work?

At eight in the morning on Saturday,
boss.

What ate?

117
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:43,565
Work dealer starts
when the customer says '' no ''.

118
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:48,487
You do not want to capture
this toy home, sir?

119
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,687
I do not know.
I thought somehow.

120
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:51,607
Why?

121
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:54,127
I need advice
with his wife first.

122
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:58,405
What for? I have not consulted
with his wife and decided to sell it.

123
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:05,407
Why, why, why?
Whatever you say,
ask 'why?' '...

124
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:06,607
Who is more likely to go
on this machine?

125
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,598
I.

126
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:12,807
You? His wife wants

127
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:14,567
She can not I
order.

128

I understand. You do not need
trouble.

129
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:20,527
Come again when
get permission.
We will ride on it.

130
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,487
I do not need permission.

131
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:23,607
Let's go then.

132
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:28,847
Let them reverberate
by car, touch it,
sniff, let them zavedutsya.

133
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:31,077
In this case, they
pay more.

134
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:35,887
What are you doing here
so late?

135
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:37,647
We need money.

136
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:38,887
Your husband is still
does not work?

137
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:41,287
No. The work is now not so
easy to find.

138
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,447
He did seem to work.

139
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:47,447
My genius husband
could not even oaormit
machine. He was fired.

140
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,287
When a customer accesses
to you with an offer,
vi say

141
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:52,807
'' Sir, if I sell
this car is worth
32 thousand dollars,

00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:56,447
1 0 million, would you take
her? When? '' Right ...

143
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:57,687
Now!

144
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:00,407
If he says '' yes ''
You say, 'Come with me' '.

145
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,287
Turn around and go
straight to oais.

146
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,447
Do not look back,
otherwise it will stop.
They are dogs.

147
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:07,887
If the dog goes after him,
and vi stop
and turn around,

148
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:11,004
it will rise too.
Do not stop
never.

149
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:15,007
Mr. De Luca is Thomas
Rowling of 'Preaaerd Bank' '.

150
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,998
I left you
March 1 communications.

151
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:22,567
I am reminded of the old
good times, when I
not afraid to shoot up.

152
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:25,807
And I remember how
talking with his wife, and she
She is dripping on my brain.

153
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:27,567
You know what, I can not
remember?

154
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,447
When my husband
the last time brought
home salary.

155
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:32,881
You know what your trouble is?

156
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,567
You want me to go
the first popavshuyusyu work.

157
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:39,567
I do not need a job,
and career! This makes all the difference!

158
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:42,320
If you work for his uncle,
not get rich!

159
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:44,527
I understand we are now
not to be envied.

160
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,607
But when turned up
good chance,

161
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,607
I will work hard, as an ox,
to get out of this
hole. You know yourself.

162
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:52,767
Family for me more
everything.

163
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:56,316
Well, because it
soon there will be more.

164
00:09:58,207 --> 00:09:59,647
Do not joke so please!

165
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:01,607
Who can tell?

166
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:04,807
You. You just said,
I have to go
any job,

167
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:06,798
because you're pregnant!

168
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:13,158
You seem to have quite
disabling brain! You what,
crazy or what?

169
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,407
Forgive me.

170
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:23,080
No, it is not necessary, Babbitt!
Do not!

171

The client already imposed
pants, shakes it all. ''

00:54:25,927 --> 00:54:30,127

765
00:54:30,127 --> 00:54:35,963

766
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:40,603

767
00:54:42,007 --> 00:54:43,998

768
00:54:44,847 --> 00:54:49,159

769
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:53,441

770
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:57,207

771
00:54:57,207 --> 00:55:00,207

772
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:02,047

773
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:05,007

774
00:55:05,007 --> 00:55:07,967

775
00:55:07,967 --> 00:55:11,198

776
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:17,005
We will not pay
for this car so much money.
No no no! I oaormlyu

777
00:55:17,807 --> 00:55:20,807
it's much cheaper.
Do not worry...

778
00:55:20,807 --> 00:55:23,847
But what are you going to
write?

779
00:55:23,847 --> 00:55:28,007
What should we write?
A lot of. I'll be right back.
This guy does not know

780
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:32,447
what is he doing.
Maybe we buy
cheaper. I like him,

781
00:55:32,447 --> 00:55:36,007
He does not look like a merchant.
Are you stole the wheelbarrow?

782
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:38,407
No.
Or maybe he stole all the same?

783
00:55:38,407 --> 00:55:40,087
What?
What is your weight?

784
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,527
I do not know.
1 60 pounds, I guess.

785
00:55:42,527 --> 00:55:45,883
Okay. Crush bull.
Well done.

786
00:55:59,247 --> 00:56:02,557
This is the price in the ad.

mi can do.

788
00:56:09,487 --> 00:56:12,559
Do you still
do not understand?

789
00:56:13,047 --> 00:56:17,047
I buy a car, but nowhere
will not go. I'll wait. Here.
We'll have to call

790
00:56:17,047 --> 00:56:20,323
in the bank, I'll take the money.
Good.

791
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,758
What?

792
00:56:26,127 --> 00:56:27,567
Hey! Where are you driving?!

793
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,558
I liked you,

794
00:56:30,247 --> 00:56:31,087
malish.

795
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:35,047
That creature!
I will add another fifty,
if ti sell wheelbarrow.

796
00:56:35,047 --> 00:56:39,247
This kind of crush on her,
is not going anywhere, I know.
I do not care.

797
00:56:39,247 --> 00:56:41,636
I do not become

798
00:56:42,247 --> 00:56:45,762
to talk to him.
Do you know why he does not want

799
00:56:46,407 --> 00:56:48,398
go? He is afraid, Mo ...

800
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:59,564
He's afraid you ... afraid of me ...
He is afraid of everybody here ...

801
00:57:00,247 --> 00:57:01,007
Even lousy hard workers,

802
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:03,805
kotorie wash mashini.
I'm not going to say this

803
00:57:05,727 --> 00:57:09,407
goat. He does not respect me.
Why do you respect him ?!

804
00:57:09,407 --> 00:57:11,398
Since it is necessary to Sloop grandmother!

805
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:15,603
For the respect of personal
You can not buy!

806
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:18,407
What idiots

808
00:57:24,247 --> 00:57:27,444
I do not buy anything,
I only want to see.

809
00:57:37,047 --> 00:57:39,925
Do you think they're saying
with you? No - with yourself!

810
00:57:41,807 --> 00:57:44,167
They are a little deceiving

811
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:46,203
from birth, they

812
00:57:54,127 --> 00:57:56,118
used to it!

813
00:58:00,607 --> 00:58:02,247
Go on, make this monster!

814
00:58:02,247 --> 00:58:03,487
No. Let the rolls!

815
00:58:03,487 --> 00:58:07,400
I'll find another, give
it to someone else.

00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:16,127
I pay in addition you a hundred,
If oaormish deal.
1 50.

817
00:58:16,127 --> 00:58:17,927
Do not tempt fate.

818
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,047
Check out

819
00:58:19,047 --> 00:58:21,720
in the showroom.
Show them this.

820
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:26,127
They have eyes on the forehead
climb.
Anyway, it shows.

821
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,437
Or I'll give JJ,
you chatted about his mother.

822
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:32,804
I said nothing.
You go to them,

823
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:33,887
will show the price.
I thought we liked

824
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:36,887
you, Bob.
Let's sit here

825
00:58:36,887 --> 00:58:40,436
a little bit,
and then I'll run again

826
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:44,604
in oais and to agree on
discounts. Okay?

827
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:49,127
You like
Vietnamese cuisine?
I do not want to sit down,

828
00:58:49,127 --> 00:58:50,927
buddy? We're almost

829
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,127
We finished all rascheti.
What the hell?

830
00:58:53,127 --> 00:58:58,520
Contributions.
In my opinion, too
a lot of...

831
00:58:58,887 --> 00:59:01,606
If the machine you
it is too expensive, thank you,

832
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:05,516
for coming to us.
Wait, wait!

833
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:12,878
I did not say that. I.e...

834
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:16,401
You can not

835
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,123
reduce the price?

836
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:26,760
No. In this case, you
I have to go somewhere else.

837
00:59:27,727 --> 00:59:33,040
Are you kidding? Where am I
look for another car, the

838
00:59:34,887 --> 00:59:40,564
more of this color?
I know it's bad.
Still, there is one place

839
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:11,401
where you can talk to
about PRICES.

840
01:00:12,607 --> 01:00:14,967
Where?
In oaise.

841
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:19,007
The engine 1, 6 liters
9700 dollars.
But it is the wholesale price,

842
01:00:19,007 --> 01:00:23,807
Retail - 1 2 1 00.
Reggie, this guy
He says

843
01:00:23,807 --> 01:00:28,887
he would take the car
only polnim
set of spare parts.

844
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:32,047
Then cast off three hundred.
Good.

845
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:34,197
What happened?

846
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:36,927
Nothing. This small

847
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:39,887
- Complete shit.
He refused.

848
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,878
Go back

849
01:00:42,687 --> 01:00:43,887
the yard!

850
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:47,960
He said a lot.
Eddie, talk to these

851
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:50,283
the riders!

852
01:00:54,887 --> 01:00:58,323
No, I will speak himself.
It's really

853
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,727
too much.
What are they talking about?

854
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:06,436
Eddie quickly!
Imagine me, just

855
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:21,687
without many words.
Here, this is my manager
Eddie. Eddie, Mr.

856
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:24,759
Mrs. Lennox.
Hello. Very nice.

859
01:01:38,447 --> 01:01:41,447
No. We told Bobby,
that came to see.

860
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:45,360
Can I ask you a couple
questions? You like

861
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:50,079
car?
Well...

862
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:54,727
Yes, I like it.
Then what prevents you

Price.
No. We have not watched

864
01:02:01,607 --> 01:02:05,395
others.
If the price you

01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:13,607

866
01:02:13,607 --> 01:02:18,237

867
01:02:21,407 --> 01:02:25,764

What are you doing?
I like the car,
I'll take it.

872
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:10,917
Yeah, but you tell me nothing

873
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:27,598
I did not.

874
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:29,758
It looks like they're angry

875
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:33,561
on me.
You have done well, cute.

876
01:03:40,727 --> 01:03:45,482
It remains to agree on a price.
Eddie's a good guy,
He will meet us.

877
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,875
After 5 minutes, you'll be

879
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:22,807
do?
This will not believe.
She slipped me

880
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:27,967
hypnotic.
I drove a gang
bikers.

881
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:30,481
We called the police.
They kidnapped the girl.

882
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:36,763
Here you are.
Installment for 4 years.
Yes ... How many us

01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:48,926
leaf?
Here he is.

885
01:04:49,727 --> 01:04:55,643
That is the price in the ad
the sale. As you can see,
the new price is much lower.

886
01:04:57,287 --> 01:05:03,078
Money could be taken
only in one place.
I do not know ... Anyway, it

01:05:04,807 --> 01:05:07,082
a few more than we
We are going to spend.

888
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:09,927
The machine can take
rent.
Well...

01:05:09,927 --> 01:05:12,725
The four-year lease
It costs here in the same amount.

890
01:05:13,687 --> 01:05:18,807
It will suit us more.
No, it's all the same
expensive.

891
01:05:18,807 --> 01:05:23,835
I do not do anything
do. You know, I'll try
talk to the boss.

892
01:05:24,647 --> 01:05:27,767
Good?
Wait here a minute.
Bobby, come with me.

I liked and must pay
husband. He refuses.

897
01:05:46,407 --> 01:05:48,807
You owe me 1 0 bucks,
idiot!

898
01:05:48,807 --> 01:05:52,766
I? I am a fool?
The car he was selling.
And you taught him!

899
01:05:57,807 --> 01:06:01,482
Yeah, well,
by the way.

900
01:06:03,447 --> 01:06:06,962
So why deal
foiled? I put more

901
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,839

If you close the deal

902
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:15,718
- Mi counting.
Bet 25.

903
01:06:15,807 --> 01:06:21,882
Let it closes itself.
I do not want to miss
customer!

904
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:26,687
50 bucks? How many?
Okay, I put a hundred.
But only if the transaction

905
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,687
he concluded.
Well, a hundred, a hundred so.

906
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:33,847
And the ten, which was
before.
Progress.

907
01:06:33,847 --> 01:06:38,287
Show him this, Shake
hand, and the car will go.
You did not show it

908
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:43,727
calendar.
You old rascal!
What are you laughing at,

909
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:48,687
friend?
It's from JJ.
We pay cash.

910
01:06:48,687 --> 01:06:51,687
Maybe I'll hide
for a week, and then I say,
that I was kidnapped ...

911
01:06:51,687 --> 01:06:56,447
Hello, Mrs.
De Luca.
Do you happen to know,

912
01:06:56,447 --> 01:07:02,477
that your husband is very
a talented dealer?
You sold the car?

913
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,278
I sold the car.
Honey, that's wonderful!

914
01:07:09,247 --> 01:07:13,638
The money that I received,
enough to pay the rent.

915
01:07:19,087 --> 01:07:20,447
Baby, I'll be real

01:07:31,687 --> 01:07:33,678
time to prepare.

919
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:37,647
Now go and sell
another car.

920
01:07:37,647 --> 01:07:40,807
Okay. I go.
Go.
I'm going.

921
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,798
I'll see you at home.

922
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:50,687
Guys, what you would call
Flintstones, whether they
black? Niggers.

923
01:07:50,687 --> 01:07:54,919
Fuck you, filthy racist!
I'm not a racist, I hate

924
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,927
all.

925
01:07:56,927 --> 01:07:58,447
Nationalist, Aryan,

01:07:58,447 --> 01:08:02,725
fucking skinhead white
Member! No offense.

01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:06,758
Nothing.
Someday racism

on the ground will not.

929
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:23,767
Does not matter.

930
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,127
Yes, after the invasion of aliens.
We're all going to hate people

931
01:08:26,127 --> 01:08:27,687
Green colour.

932
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:31,767
I do not know how I work
this jerk.

933
01:08:31,767 --> 01:08:33,527
Why do not you go?
I went twice.

934
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:37,520
Why come back?
Money, baby. Money...

935
01:08:39,567 --> 01:08:43,196
It is not a simple shop.
Nowhere else buyers

936
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,278
do not peel, as we have.

937
01:08:46,447 --> 01:08:48,438
I once earned

938
01:08:50,607 --> 01:08:54,520
$ 2,700 on a single
lousy wheelbarrow.

939
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,407
This is a legitimate robbery
otherwise you will not tell.

940
01:09:06,407 --> 01:09:10,605
Heck!
Infection! He's naked!

941
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:16,927
Where have you been?
Where's the car?
You understand that it can be

942
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,607
It could sell a hundred times?
Maybe pass

943
01:09:19,607 --> 01:09:23,919
in oais?
Answer me, you moron!

944
01:09:24,167 --> 01:09:26,158
Where did the car ?!

945
01:09:26,527 --> 01:09:31,157
She stole the woman.
What kind of woman?

946
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:51,567
You let some
rat steal a wheelbarrow?
We had ...

947
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:56,766
What - you're with her?
Have sex
and she...

948
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:00,927
You vdul this bitch?
Yes.

949
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:04,203
So, Marco finally
He found himself a woman. It

950
01:10:05,527 --> 01:10:09,725
I took a swallow?
He had to give in the mouth!

951
01:10:14,287 --> 01:10:19,767
Marco, the first channel.
Now you're in deep shit,
lousy half-wit!

952
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:25,399
Hi colleague.
Hi.
You are now well

953
01:10:27,527 --> 01:10:32,806
I worked.
Thank you, brother, thank you.
I probably need to know

954
01:10:33,527 --> 01:10:35,807
more about this business.
About this business to learn
there is nothing. You've got to have

955
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:38,207
nervi strong and doing business.
Can it be so simple?

956
01:10:38,207 --> 01:10:41,916
Do not you believe me?
Half of the dealers even
not speak English...

957
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:54,315
That's the point, then
handle any.
Mohammed, he barely escaped

958
01:10:55,527 --> 01:10:57,518
from Russian, he nearly hit

959
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:00,478
ambushed a few times,

960
01:11:00,687 --> 01:11:05,287
I knocked 'Stinger'
helicopters. And now he
here it sells cars.

961
01:11:05,287 --> 01:11:08,647
As he gets?
As he earns

962
01:11:08,647 --> 01:11:13,447
so much money?
Work hard as an ox, that's all.
He wants to save more

963
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:19,397
and return to the sister.
He left her there.
He is a good boy.

964
01:11:24,527 --> 01:11:28,520
I like him.
I do not regret it! No one

965
01:11:29,047 --> 01:11:33,438
do not be sorry! Deceives himself,
is not deceived you!
And they will do it,

966
01:11:35,567 --> 01:11:38,007
Believe.
Throw. Is it all

967
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:41,567
so bad?
Mark my words
mate, in this rotten

968
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,445
really no place feeling.
You're making money,

969
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:46,558
and the rest do not care!

970
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:52,163
This machine, which
Eddie sold, we fooled

971
01:11:53,007 --> 01:11:56,007
this sucker.
And he did not even guess

972
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:58,601
about anything until after the
three or four years. And you...

973
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,518
You could earn

974
01:12:07,007 --> 01:12:08,998
more on interest.

975
01:12:15,607 --> 01:12:18,075
He already got

976
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:39,560
enough.
What? What means

977
01:12:41,327 --> 01:12:44,046
enough?
When the woman is sleeping with you,

978
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,518
ti also say that after

979
01:12:49,087 --> 01:12:51,078
how to end?

980
01:12:51,527 --> 01:12:53,327
Never!

981
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,087
It does not happen!

982
01:12:55,087 --> 01:12:57,527
For me, let it fuck
once good and then

983
01:12:57,527 --> 01:13:03,602
It starts again!
Wow! You may ask,
Eddie? Have you ever regretted

984
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:09,238
any buyer?

985
01:13:10,247 --> 01:13:12,647
Fuck them all!
We're going home.

986
01:13:12,647 --> 01:13:14,638
Hi.

987
01:13:41,727 --> 01:13:43,718
Are you still awake?

988
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:50,357
You know, I thought a lot
about this work.
Perhaps I was too

989
01:13:53,127 --> 01:13:55,118
nice to people ...

990
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,198
You can not afford to

991
01:14:08,207 --> 01:14:10,198
You look down on you ...

992
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:24,364
Then I will be much
easier. I admit it, because

993
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:29,527
I'm too good.
And then every time

994
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:31,087
I had to bite myself

995
01:14:31,087 --> 01:14:36,878
ass.
You do not want to bite
Now that ass?

996
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:39,598
Lord, I love you!
'' Second Saturday '

997
01:14:47,727 --> 01:14:49,718
Marco, the good news.
The cops found the car and grab

998
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:56,320
your girlfriend.
Now the rat

999
01:14:56,487 --> 01:14:58,487
in prison.
You go to visit her,

1000
01:14:58,487 --> 01:15:03,641
Marco?
Maybe she would give him back.
In the women's prison.

1001
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,127
In the men's prison, too

1002
01:15:17,127 --> 01:15:19,243
who has to give.

1003
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:26,958
Where Ion? I'll finish this

1004
01:15:27,967 --> 01:15:31,167
Irish nerd!
As the cops found the car?

1005
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:35,207
They were lucky. This woman
sigrat wanted.
She went to Vegas ...

1006
01:15:35,207 --> 01:15:39,564
In the hour I have
I collect, moron ?!

1007
01:15:41,607 --> 01:15:44,767
I have a doctor's note.
'' Deleted mole from the ear. ''

1008
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,167
You wound up in the brain
insects?

1009
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,847
She climbed back.
What could I do?

1010
01:15:49,847 --> 01:15:51,807
Sit down next to Marco.

1011
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:53,407
This is my new school of genius.

1012
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:55,207
Okay, we need to pick up the pace.

1013
01:15:55,207 --> 01:15:57,087
You need to work better.

1014
01:15:57,087 --> 01:15:59,476
We have spent too

1015
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:43,158
many buyers.

1016
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:48,159
I want to hear what they
They say in justification.

1017
01:16:51,167 --> 01:16:54,047
- Try to put me
a deadlock. Start.

1018
01:16:54,047 --> 01:16:57,835
- I only came to see.
I only sell. That
see the car on it

1019
01:17:11,247 --> 01:17:12,647
you need to train. Farther.

1020
01:17:12,647 --> 01:17:17,675
I think in another place
I will sell cheaper.
Sir, we all pay the same,

1021
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,198
you will not find cheaper anywhere else.

1022
01:17:24,247 --> 01:17:26,442
Come, I'll show you.

1023
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:30,117
I have not watched
elsewhere.

1024
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:39,561
Then you're in luck,
vi guessed right.
I want to know what

1025
01:18:48,047 --> 01:18:50,641
discount can give my
credit union.

1026
01:18:50,687 --> 01:18:54,887
We have a list of all
kreditnih unions, I can

1027
01:18:54,887 --> 01:18:57,481
name the exact tsiaru.
Let's!

1028
01:18:59,047 --> 01:19:01,356
Ask a question abruptly!
I need advice

1029
01:19:02,887 --> 01:19:07,087
with his wife.
What she teleaon.
We'll call her now.

1030
01:19:07,087 --> 01:19:09,687
I first want to see
a couple of other cars.
What for? 'Kosyumer Report' '

1031
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:13,527
'' Car Driver End ''
'' Hey Triple '' - they were
You have opted for.

1032
01:19:13,527 --> 01:19:15,836
This one is the best.
show me

1033
01:19:18,007 --> 01:19:23,207
some '' Ford ''.
Well, sir, let's go.
Bring this guy along.

1034
01:19:23,207 --> 01:19:25,047
Where are we going?
By the dealer '' Ford '' moron.

1035
01:19:25,047 --> 01:19:28,047
Come on! We compare,
that there and here.
I does not matter

1036
01:19:28,047 --> 01:19:31,483
with money.
We can arrange

1037
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:35,158
loan for you.

1038
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:39,167
I declared bankruptcy

1039
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:41,158
two weeks ago.

1040
01:19:42,487 --> 01:19:44,207
Then what the hell
then you need?

1041
01:19:44,207 --> 01:19:46,007
Well, you understand what's what.

1042
01:19:46,007 --> 01:19:48,687
Let's push the wheelbarrow!
I want results!

1043
01:19:48,687 --> 01:19:50,167
I work for the result!
Show class! I'll give

1044
01:19:50,167 --> 01:19:52,158
dinner one who oaormit

1045
01:19:57,447 --> 01:19:59,438
deal first. Let's!

1046
01:19:59,687 --> 01:20:01,678
We'll have to string up,

1047
01:20:03,487 --> 01:20:06,001
brother.
What would you like to see?

1048
01:20:07,087 --> 01:20:09,078
That's where he got

1049
01:20:10,687 --> 01:20:13,087
a new car.
He wets us horns.

1050
01:20:13,087 --> 01:20:16,087
This is my sister. Her name Paro.
I call it the June Paro.

1051
01:20:16,087 --> 01:20:18,078
We decided to say so,

1052
01:20:21,687 --> 01:20:24,167
If you like someone.

1053
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:30,117
For example, in June, Bobby.
Soon I will have enough money,
to bring it here.

1054
01:20:35,127 --> 01:20:36,927
I have nothing left her there.

1055
01:20:36,927 --> 01:20:39,157
You bring her, of course,

1056
01:20:39,287 --> 01:20:41,278
Mo. You overtook everyone in this

1057
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,647
month. Till.
Just look, pal,

1058
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:50,047
I'm going after him. You understand,
what I mean?

1059
01:20:50,047 --> 01:20:51,207
It goes' 'Thunderbird'.

1060
01:20:51,207 --> 01:20:54,207
Welcome to the South
sector. My name is Mohammed.

1061
01:20:54,207 --> 01:20:56,047
Welcome.
We already have a dealer.

1062
01:20:56,047 --> 01:20:58,407
You lied to us, Nixon.
I yes.

1063
01:20:58,407 --> 01:21:01,407
It's like you.
We need a lie detector.

1064
01:21:01,407 --> 01:21:06,242
I did not say anything.
Amazing machine,
She warned
