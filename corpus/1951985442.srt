01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:03,276
It's what I used to start it.
It was an accident, and I thought I put it out.

989
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,592
But I guess not. Obviously not.

990
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,238
Oh, Poppy.

991
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,353
You realise what this means, don't you?

992
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,748
- Will I be expelled?
- The Honour Court will decide,

993
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,516
but I suspect you'll understand
that it's just a formality at this point.

994
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,720
The weird thing is
I really did try to turn it around.

995
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,715
I didn't want to disappoint you.
I'm so sorry.

996
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,432
I'm so sorry, too, Poppy.

997

you could give this to Freddie for me?

998

I'm going to the Honour Court,
and then I'll be leaving.

1000

So, this is for you.

1001
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:13,078
Well done. You finally got what you wanted.
You must be overjoyed.

1002
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:17,756

- Please. Give it a rest.

- Hi.

1005
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:30,877
- So you backed out of our deal.
- What deal?

1006
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,714
- That you won't fry my head.
- Yeah.

1007
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,234

Hey. Come on.

What if it doesn't have a moral?
Or says Alice.

1010
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:50,593
I think I just fell down the rabbit hole
and found it.

1011
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,829
Look.

1012
01:14:55,640 --> 01:15:00,589
- She looks exactly like you.
- Yeah. She was my mom.

1013
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,434
She went to this school. I didn't even know.

1014
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,631
Well, guess it's time to face the music now.

Josie, I'm never wrong.
When am I ever wrong?

1017
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,988
You're wrong when we did
the math challenge.

1018
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:35,551
Hey! She's confessed.
She's going to Honour Court this afternoon.

1019
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,074
- That's brave.
- And really stupid.

1020
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,116
Because guess what I've discovered.

1021
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:45,870
It is with great regret and sadness
that we call the Honour Court to session.

1022
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,675
The e-mails were sent 11:40 in the morning.
But according to Drippy,

1023
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,036
Poppy left the computer room
a few minutes after 11:00.

1024
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,317
I got my 11:00 Wagon Wheel,
then I went to tell her Freddie was waiting.

1025
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,913
She left immediately.

1026
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,992
I was able to access the keystroke order
of the root file

1027
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,719
to find out
who else was logged on there then.

1028
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,396
- And guess who the only other person was?
- Who?

1029
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,553
It will henceforth be our job to objectively

1030
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,474
and dispassionately ascertain
what happened that fateful night

1031
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:23,680
that will hence to forth long blight
the memory of this proud institution.

1032
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,912
And when you think about it,
Poppy would never say "term."

1033
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,752
She calls it a bloody samosa or something.

1034
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,879
- "Semester."
- Whatever. Anyway, to check the reality,

1035
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,396
I had a sneaky look
in her diary for Friday's entry.

1036
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,040
KATE: Don't do that.
DRIPPY: Shut up and listen.

01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:46,635

like proper friends I've known forever.

1038
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,678

like "horridious" and "herbal."

1039

it's all a bit more kosher, don't you think?

1043
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,077
And now she's going to get thrown out.

It is your duty

1045
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,919
to understand the dark forces
that drove a seemingly...

1046
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,231
Harriet? May I remind you
that the Honour Court

1047
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,515
is no place
for your personal grandstanding,

1048
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,670
and that Poppy has a right to speak
in her own defence

1049
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,274
before the Court as a whole
passes judgement?

1050
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,396
Thank you, Mrs Kingsley.

1051
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,198
I won't insult everybody
by trying to defend myself or my actions.

1052
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:44,838
So, I think it's safe to say that
I've really messed up.

1053
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:50,472
And I apologise profusely.
But I'm also so grateful to you all.

1054
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,600
I tried really hard to get out of this school,

1055
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,559
and only now do I realise
just how much I want to stay.

1056
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,997
I've learnt so much being here.
Being with all of you.

1057
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:09,073
And in some ways being with my mom,

1058
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:13,631
who I found out was actually a student here.

1059
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,029
I've had a hole in my heart for five years,

1060
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:21,752
and somehow being here,
it slowly started to heal.

1061
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,913
I know I may have looked
like a California girl,

1062
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,278

that I really am an Abbey Mount girl.

Objection! Sustained.

1064

the previous statement

1065
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,115
and perhaps heretofore
we can begin the real business.

1066
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,760
Can you tell us, in your own words,

1067
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,149
where were you
on the aforementioned evening of...

1068
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,277
Honestly, Harriet.
Who else's words do you expect her to use?

1069
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,832
- Just leave this to me.
- Right. Sustained.

1070
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:00,595
Poppy, were you in the cook's sitting room
on the night of the fire?

1071
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,796
Yes, I was.

1072
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,111
- Were you there with permission?
- No. I was not.

1073
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:13,038
- Quiet, please. Silence in court.
- Did you intend on starting a fire?

1074
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,315
- Not really.
- Objection!

1075
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,154
- Does the defendant mean yes or no?
- Harriet.

1076
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,391
It means no,
I had no intention of actually doing it.

1077
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:26,359

- Not as far as I know.

- Harriet, you're going down, biatch.

This is a conspiracy.
You can't expel the whole year,

1091
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:05,792
- and they know that.
- Be quiet, Harriet! Sit down, everyone.

1092
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,556
It's a black-and-white case.
She has to be expelled.

1093
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:15,475
The girl set fire to the school,
endangering all our precious lives.

1094
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:20,236
She walked in there, lighter at the ready,
and tried to burn the place down.

- Lighter?
- Not now, Jane.

1096

- Have respect for court protocol.
- What lighter, Harriet?

1097

Jesus, Charlotte,
how daft can you possibly be?

1098
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:35,157
That ridiculous "I heart LA" lighter of hers.
She left it behind, for God's sakes.

1099
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:41,634
Except, how do you know that, Harriet?
No one's mentioned a lighter before.

1100
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,393
What? Yes, they have.

1101
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:50,394
- Objection.
- Actually, Harriet, they haven't.

1102
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:56,191
I have to second Jane's question, Harriet.
How did you know about that lighter?

1103
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,110
HARRIET: Well, I...

1104
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,078
Freddie found the lighter
before anyone saw it.

1105
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,756
How could you possibly know unless...
Unless you were there?

1106
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,037
This is absurd.
I refuse to sit here and listen to these wild...

1107
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:17,069
I had put it out. And I heard footsteps.
It must have been you.

You restarted the fire, didn't you?

- Harriet, is this true?
- Of course not.

1110

I think I'm innocent.

- You're not!
