What else, brother?

182
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:03,407
Hard to tell if
there was a rape.

183
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,576
<i>She was a hooker by trade.
She's got a Cesarean scar.</i>

184
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:08,781
<i>She must've had
at least one child.</i>

185
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:11,951
<i>She was headed down a way path,

<i>(Jacob)
Yeah.</i>

187
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,167
Hand me some cotton swab,
brother. With some alcohol.

188

Let me ask you something.

Do you know a girl
called Jessica Trimble?

200
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:42,556
I've seen her. She worked
this place for John's.

201
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,295
I never talked to her
except to take drink orders.

202
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,238
If you never talked to her,
how do you know her name?

203
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,211
I watch the news. I've
seen you a bunch of times.

Okay.

00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,143
Listen, this Leon,

211
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,511

sex with him?

212
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:20,077
<i>And I'm not asking for
the reasons you might think.</i>

213
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:26,027
Yeah. He ain't that smart but
he's all right in that department.

<i>Now, I got some questions
about Jessica Trimble.</i>

222
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:55,230
Either I'm gonna arrest
you and take you downtown,

223
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:56,735
or you're gonna talk to me now.

224

King's got a hell of a track record. We're
just interested in seeing how he does it.

You keep this transition

Definitely not.

348
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:50,395
Can you just back up just a
little bit? Gimme a second.

349

It's your world.

350
00:27:57,477 --> 00:27:59,843
The lacerations

<i>Take a look
at that mirror.</i>

356
00:28:16,672 --> 00:28:20,540
You know, there was a mirror at
the Jessica Trimble crime scene.

357
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:23,656
<i>Exactly. Now
check this out.</i>

358
00:28:23,724 --> 00:28:26,192
As you can see,

359
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:31,245
<i>the body drag marks of his heels are on
top of the drag marks from the mirror.</i>

360
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:34,004
It's like a play for him.

361
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,094
Nice.

362
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,930
<i>Yeah.</i>

363
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:39,727
<i>(Storm) There was a mirror at the

I handled a homicide once.

366
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:48,968

One time!

367

<i>See if you can get that photographer
to come back here to bag his shoes.</i>

368
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:56,222
I wanna take photographs of these
drag marks and the carving on his body.

369
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:57,847
<i>(Frankie)
Will do.</i>

370
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,354
Stick around.
This girl can entertain you.

371
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:03,577
Wouldn't you say, Storm?
She's very entertaining.

372
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:09,967
Are you staying?

373
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:13,590
I hate the smell when
they popped it a little.

374
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:17,989
<i>(Storm) You girls have a blast.
If it gets too strong in here, crack a window.</i>

375
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,666
Agent Miller. Do you want a copy
of this report sent to your office?

376
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:30,057
Thanks. That will
be appreciated.

The lower floor

To make sure
everything's fine.

390
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:14,028
Agent Miller, we shouldn't
get involved in domestic shit.

00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:16,657
Half the time the women
don't even press charges.

392

You did or you didn't? If you don't
tell me, I'm gonna cut you open.

The bartender said the victim
was a venue promoter, Lance Myers.

I was hoping we could talk
in a place a little more...

437
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:48,243
A little more
romantic, perhaps?

438
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:51,181
A little less sterile.

439
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:53,903
That little incident

440
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:55,994
you're not used to
field work, are you?

441
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:59,432
I've done my share of field
work, mostly profile stuff.

442
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:01,550
And you're asking
us the questions?

443
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,681
We're talking about the psychology
of murder, not just the investigation,

444
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:08,373
it's not for you to decide
whether I'm qualified.

Oh. Please.

446
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:17,697
What was your involvement
in the Billy Joe Hill arrest?

447
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:22,690
Were you there when
King made the arrest?

This guy's a real
piece of work.

449
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:28,436
He was dishonorably
discharged after Desert Storm.

450
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:32,662
He's trained as a medic but also as
a small arms and explosives expert.

You can't be thinking
this guy's gonna walk.

to be suspect.

Sorry about the late notice, I know it's...

702
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:53,117
Pretty damn rude.

703
00:54:53,187 --> 00:54:57,123
This investigation is being
supervised by my Agency,

704
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,110
<i>and we have ultimate authority over
everything related to the Grifter case.</i>

00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:03,121
Hm.

707
00:55:03,194 --> 00:55:04,855
I'll take
that as a "yes."

708
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:08,421
You can do whatever you want.
Now let's get on with it.

709
00:55:08,498 --> 00:55:11,831

Yes.

713
00:55:23,242 --> 00:55:24,937
And the count
to date is five?

714
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:28,777
<i>Six. Three females
and three males.</i>

715
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:32,578
And each death was a result of
blunt force trauma, a beating?

716
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,947
Yeah.

717
00:55:34,018 --> 00:55:36,452
No inconsistencies
with the victim's wounds?

718
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:38,111
<i>The only inconsistency</i>

719
00:55:38,187 --> 00:55:41,418
is amount of trauma between
the female victims and the male.

720
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:42,787
The women
were beat less?

721
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:44,951
<i>No. He toys with
the females more.</i>

722
00:55:45,026 --> 00:55:48,553
<i>They received
much more trauma.</i>

723
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:52,223
Are you aware of why we're
interested in this case?

724
00:55:52,298 --> 00:55:54,357

<i>[whistling and wheels squeak]</i>

He's a little ripe.

The flesh found
underneath the fingernails,

00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:32,960
<i>It matches the DNA from the
second female victim, right?</i>

732
00:56:33,028 --> 00:56:34,325
Makes sense, don't it?

733
00:56:34,396 --> 00:56:36,261
Well, it does
and it doesn't.

734
00:56:36,332 --> 00:56:40,098
Fingernails are used by females in
a defensive manner but not by a man.

735
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:43,467
That's textbook. A man will
do anything to defend himself.

<i>Scratch, kick, bite I've seen it all.
Don't seem strange to me.</i>

737
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:51,004
Well, the sample we
got made it seem strange.

<i>Under which fingernail
was it recovered?</i>

739
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:56,179
<i>Right index finger.</i>

740
00:56:56,246 --> 00:57:00,205
I'm gonna need a close
up photo of that finger.

741
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,875
Why?

742
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,885
Just get it done. Someone
will pick it up tonight.

743
00:57:18,262 --> 00:57:19,889
<i>Hey.</i>

744
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:25,663

to your arm?

745
00:57:25,736 --> 00:57:27,169
Nothing.

746
00:57:29,705 --> 00:57:31,195

747
00:57:31,272 --> 00:57:32,500
Okay.

748
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,974
Nights has an opening.

749
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:37,203
Nights always
has openings.

750
00:57:40,446 --> 00:57:44,746
I think they can get me changing shifts.
Something different.

751
00:57:48,252 --> 00:57:51,847
Just wanted to check it with
you first, see what you thought.

752
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,159

me become a detective.

<i>Like you.</i>

00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:05,863

What would make
you think that?

757
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:25,209
Since you're out of work. Jacob
nearly got this thing solved.

758
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,908
Jacob has a possible
suspect. Nothing more.

759
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:30,246
It can be a little bit
more than that, you see?

760
00:58:30,317 --> 00:58:34,686
<i>I made out with his wallet.
Inslde I found a necklace.</i>

00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:42,283
<i>the DNA from this matches the

763
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,887

Why didn't
I get the lab reports?

769
00:58:57,438 --> 00:59:00,498
Well, I just like to keep shit
kinda close to my vest, you know.

770
00:59:00,573 --> 00:59:02,006
That's not protocol.

771
00:59:02,075 --> 00:59:03,599
I'm not too good at protocol.

772
00:59:03,676 --> 00:59:06,804
<i>Great. Thanks. Okay.</i>

773
00:59:06,878 --> 00:59:11,508

You can come if you all wanna see.

<i>Storm, put out an APB.</i>

777
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:25,421
So, what you
got, little lady?

00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:35,722

legit, but no doubt he's long gone.

781

Did you tell
the uniforms?

782
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:46,403

need that crime scene preserved.
