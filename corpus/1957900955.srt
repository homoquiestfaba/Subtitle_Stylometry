00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:40,083
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

1
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,433
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,305
Hot chocolate for sale.

3
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:46,872
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

4
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,874
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

5
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,747
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

6
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:52,877
Wow.

7
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:54,967
Hot chocolate for sale.

8
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:57,535
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

9
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,581
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

10
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:00,973
I wish you Merry Christmas.

11
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:02,366
OK, stop singing.

12
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:03,541
What is this?

13
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:05,195
What's going on here?

14
00:01:05,326 --> 00:01:07,241
Hot chocolate for sale.

15
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:08,851
Hi, Ms. Karen,
would you like yours

16
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,722
with or without marshmallows?

17
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:13,160
Oh, this is a
residential street.

18
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,074
I know.

19
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:15,205
I live here.

20
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:16,946
And I live right there.

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,556
OK?

22
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:20,602
I'm trying to
watch Judy Justice.

23
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:23,779
You can't sell
lemonade on the street.

24
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,868
It's hot chocolate.

25
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:26,999
Where's your permit?

26
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,957
Huh?

27
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,612
Your Florida sales permit?

28
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:31,961
Just as I thought.

29
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,504
It's a good thing I
called the police.

30
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:34,311
What?

31
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,879
What is going on here?

32
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,881
We got a call about an
illegal business being

33
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,536
operated out of this home.

34
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,277
What?

35
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:46,497
Ma'am, I'd like to speak
to you inside about that,

36
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,804
if you don't mind.

37
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:51,894
Of course, sir.

38
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:53,722
Robin better watch what she says

39
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:57,552
or she'll get her ass
slapped right into jail.

40
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,051
I hope your mother
doesn't have to go

41
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,859
downtown to the police station.

42
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,296
I'm willing to
forgive and forget

43
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,428
if you shut down this
illegal operation

44
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,214
and go hide in your room.

45
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:08,344
Scat!

46
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:19,661
And your little dog too.

47
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,273
Da, da, da, da,
da, da, da, da, da.

48
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:27,364
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
da, da, hot chocolate for free.

49
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:44,946
No.

50
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,035
No.

51
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,558
Excuse me.

52
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:48,951
Excuse me.

53
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,996
Something's wrong with this.

54
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:54,739
Yeah, you ordered a dry eggnog
cappuccino brave heavy cream,

55
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,221
six shot venti, five pumps sugar
free white mocha, low milk,

56
00:02:58,352 --> 00:02:59,918
not no milk.

57
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,114
Four pumps hazelnut, six honey,
a double caramel drizzle.

58
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:02,921
Yeah.

59
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:05,010
This was made with 2%.

60
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,926
I'm on Keto and I'm not going
to get my full fat balance

61
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,363
for the day.

62
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:11,626
I haven't had a slice
of bread in six weeks.

63
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,410
Are you trying to kill me?

64
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,284
I specifically asked for this
to be poured and it was stirred.

65
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:19,764
Poured.

66
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:20,895
Take it back.

67
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,207
And I want a biscotti.

68
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:31,950
These are an extra $4,
but they are really good.

69
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,735
No biscotti.

70
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,887
You've upped your prices again.
And you need to discount that.

71
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,271
Because I'm a
churchgoing woman who

72
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:40,002
will not pay $6.66 for a drink.

73
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:42,613
Don't make me go to
another coffee shop.

74
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:43,744
Hand sanitizer?

75
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:44,485
I'll take some.

76
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:45,660
Me too.

77
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,401
So ladies, tell me.

78
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,794
What is the latest
dish the dirt?

79
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,364
I know what this is.

80
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,932
Oh, that was the wrong tube.

81
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,238
It was my happy gel.

82
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:02,024
And some napkins.

83
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:04,069
Looks like Brad's got Karen.

84
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,506
And make it to go.

85
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:08,944
Don't worry.

86
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:11,381
She does this all the time.

87
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:17,648
And I do this all the time.

88
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,649
Voila.

89
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
Nice.

90
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,787
That's better.

91
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,964
Make it right the first
time and maybe I'll tip you.

92
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:30,094
Nah.

93
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:41,758
Oh, great.

94
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:45,110
Gift to a lost soul.

95
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,069
I'll give you this.

96
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,550
Do your part and
throw it away for me.

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,595
Oh, thanks, Karen.

98
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,381
What?

99
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,165
I need a little Valium
and a lot of wine.

100
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,520
Oh, my God.

101
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:04,434
Oh, my God.

102
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:05,783
Oh, my God.

103
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:08,917
Oh, my God.

104
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,572
You scratched my car.

105
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:12,529
Who are your parents?

106
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,748
What's your phone number?

107
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,837
Lawsuit pending.

108
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:19,231
Next time you leap out in front
of my car, I just won't break.

109
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,362
And you will be toast.

110
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,450
Toast!

111
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,268
Would you like to
donate $1 to help save

112
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,792
the homeless mother shelter?

113
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,924
That house for street walkers?

114
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,100
Let it die and be done with it.

115
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,320
Abstinence.

116
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:07,279
Decrease the excess copulation.

117
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,716
Here.

118
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:09,846
OK.

119
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:17,115
Um, this expired four years ago.

120
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:19,335
Are you new here?

121
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:22,207
Every store in this
town honors my coupons.

122
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:25,559
The only reason I came in here
is because they're all closed.

123
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:26,821
Christmas Eve.

124
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:27,996
Well, ma'am.

125
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,171
Ma'am?

126
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,433
Oh, don't you ma'am me.

127
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,870
Don't you, ma'am me.

128
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,220
Did she just say mammy?

129
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:38,789
Well, Caroline, I would
like to speak to your manager.

130
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:44,926
Assistant manager
to register four.

131
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,232
Did I say assistant manager?

132
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,452
I want to speak to your manager.

133
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,584
La señora?
Hi.

134
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:51,759
Can I help you?

135
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,500
You can help me
find the manager.

136
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,589
I wish to speak to the manager.

137
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:58,548
I want to speak to the manager.

138
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,594
I'm the manager on duty.

139
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:03,466
How dare you talk back to me.

140
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:04,815
I'm here to help you, ma'am.

141
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:05,816
Ma'am?

142
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:06,774
Oh, that's it.

143
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:08,036
This conversation is over.

144
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,864
I'm calling corporate.

145
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,518
We are privately owned.

146
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:14,390
Oh, my God, I will pay for
one of her bottles of wine

147
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:16,081
if she'll just get
the hell out of here.

148
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:20,464
Yes, I would like the corporate

149
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,530
office number for.

150
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,836
I don't want to be put on hold.

151
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,534
I don't care.

152
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,971
Yes, Karen Whitehead.

153
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,339
And put me on the
phone with someone

154
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,801
who speaks better English.

155
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:44,812
Drinking juice.

156
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:46,204
Drinking juice.

157
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,772
It's going to be delicious.

158
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,121
Dee, do, do.

159
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:51,252
Dee. do, do.

160
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:52,559
Dee.

161
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,519
Two minutes, pot pie time.

162
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,260
Pot pie.

163
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,542
The chicken and the veggies
and the chicken and the veggies

164
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:00,566
and the pot pie time.

165
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,702
I'll do that tomorrow.

166
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,801
That better be Amazon with the
right size jeggings this time.

167
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:18,062
Deck the
halls with boughs of holly.

168
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:21,979
Fa, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la.

169
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,110
Leave me alone!

170
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:28,333
No solicitors.

171
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,292
I hate school break.

172
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:31,815
You know what?

173
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,556
No Christmas.

174
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:34,687
No carolers.

175
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,432
Christmas bugs me.

176
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:41,651
It's Florida.

177
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:42,870
It's hot as hell.

178
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,832
Oh, why you little sh...

179
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,181
Hey, Karen.

180
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,318
Get off my porch, trespasser.

181
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,282
I'm coming in, Karen.

182
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:05,413
Oh.

183
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:09,331
Oh.

184
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:11,725
Oh, this wine has an extra kick.

185
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,030
Oh.

186
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:16,337
Pot pie.

187
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:45,497
What up, biatch?

188
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:46,847
Yum.

189
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:47,977
Right, care bear?

190
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:55,116
It is really dark in here.

191
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:57,074
Better.

192
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:00,382
Listen, I don't know what the
hell or who the hell you are,

193
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:01,818
lady.

194
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:05,213
But nobody calls me care
bear except my old boss.

195
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,910
Jackie?

196
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,999
Jackie Morley, is that you?

197
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:14,614
Yeah, it's me.

198
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:23,012
Spoon.

199
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:30,064
But you died 20 years ago.

200
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:33,589
This very night, during your
neighborhood Christmas party.

201
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,218
Are you going to save
some for the rest of us?

202
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:44,731
Did you just take the last
bacon wrapped tater tot?

203
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:08,798
It was like right here.

204
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,322
That was a bad ass heart attack.

205
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,020
I don't even know
what caused it.

206
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,413
I don't think we'll ever know.

207
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:17,851
Hey, Jackie, how about you
not eat all my ice cream?

208
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:18,981
Silence!

209
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,294
Seriously?

210
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,688
Ugh.

211
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,385
You're not real.

212
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:31,821
You're not real.

213
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:35,042
All right, look,
I came here to warn

214
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:40,395
you that you are on a super fast
track to end up just like me.

215
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,792
Are you even listening to me?

216
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:49,143
Mm-mm.

217
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,144
Sorry.

218
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:51,274
Sorry.

219
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:56,759
Is it... is it like just you?

220
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,760
Mm-hmm.

221
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,197
Aw, you never found a man.

222
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:03,157
I don't need a man, like you.

223
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,462
That's right.

224
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,247
I was never married.

225
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,292
But I always had a married man.

226
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:15,125
Now, are you... are you still
doing that house to house

227
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,561
progressive Christmas party?

228
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:17,692
No.
No.

229
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,390
No?

230
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,219
There's too many people of
color in the neighborhood now.

231
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,960
Wow.

232
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:28,486
Honey, you are so screwed.

233
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:29,836
Screwed.

234
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,359
Well, how am I... wait.
Wait.

235
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:32,752
- Wait for what now?
- What?

236
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:33,882
I'm like you.

237
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,319
You were great.

238
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,193
Arrogant and entitled
and ignorant.

239
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:43,763
OK, turns out those
aren't good things.

240
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,068
Blew your mind.

241
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:50,291
And you do not want
to end up like us.

242
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,075
See?

243
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,948
There are so many
lost souls out there.

244
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:00,388
And we wander the
Earth among the living.

245
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:06,394
Doomed to witness the simple
acts of human kindness.

246
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:07,874
Jeez.

247
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,701
Kindness that
we were too stingy with

248
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,094
and our lifetimes.

249
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:17,753
And in this endless
purgatory, we

250
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:22,279
are bound by the
indiscretions of our past.

251
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,890
Behold.

252
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,543
OK.

253
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:29,547
I where the chains
I forged in life.

254
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,202
You are a hallucination
just brought

255
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,683
on by cheap wine and
Canadian painkillers

256
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,033
and a burnt pot pie, bad gravy.

257
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:38,164
Ooh.

258
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,909
Enough with the chains.

259
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,649
What the hell happened to you?

260
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,261
You were a bad babe that was
always in everybody's business.

261
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,959
OK, but what was my business?

262
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,702
Overcharging customers,
bullying suppliers,

263
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,139
banging my friends' husbands.

264
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,401
That's the...

265
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,795
Kindness should
have been my business.

266
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,363
Human welfare should
have been my business.

267
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:05,018
You said, the people that are
on food stamps are just taken...

268
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:06,933
Oh, my God.

269
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:11,938
Charity, mercy, chastity
should have been my business.

270
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:13,504
Enough with the chastity.

271
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,811
Anyway, the reason
that I am here

272
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:19,293
is to let you know
that there is a way

273
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,861
that you can escape my fate.

274
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:24,559
Well, you did always
have dirt to dish.

275
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,300
So hit me.

276
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:31,653
All right, you are going to
be visited by three spirits.

277
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:32,872
No way.

278
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,221
No.

279
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:35,831
Ghosts, Karen.

280
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:38,268
G-g-g-ghosts.

281
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,488
The first one's going to
be here in about an hour.

282
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:41,402
Tonight?

283
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:42,577
Yup.

284
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:45,928
And then another
and then another.

285
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,452
Can I just take them all at
one time and be done with it?

286
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,758
Super kinky.

287
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,412
And nope.

288
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:54,415
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to join the others

289
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,373
and be frickin' miserable.

290
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,646
Don't step on the bush.

291
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,577
Don't step on the... you
stepped on the bushes.

292
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,390
Jackie?

293
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,571
Oh, never mind.

294
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:22,616
Never mind.

295
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:56,693
Intruder alert.

296
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:57,738
Police...

297
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,057
What do you...

298
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,275
What do you want?

299
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,189
It's all good.

300
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,061
It's all good.

301
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:16,584
Bring it down a notch.

302
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,064
Tap the brakes a bad.

303
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:20,022
Chill Bill, yo.

304
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,458
Just attack me.

305
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,852
Get it over with.

306
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,983
Oh, no.

307
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,289
No, no, no, no, no.
No, girl.

308
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,140
Ain't nothing got me
climbing up into that...

309
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:30,293
None of this glory is going
anywhere near that hole.

310
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:31,816
Wait.

311
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:34,036
Are you the spirit Jackie
said would visit me?

312
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,951
Oh, Coochie Chain.

313
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,998
We call her Coochie Chain.

314
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,173
Yeah.

315
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:43,089
I'm the ghost of
past Christmases.

316
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,219
Way in the past?

317
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,570
No, just... just your past.

318
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,920
I'm like a guardian
angel just assigned

319
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,793
to you and a couple other hoes.

320
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,186
Who?

321
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,014
Just you, as far
as you're concerned.

322
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,363
So let's go.

323
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:58,321
You can kiss my ass.

324
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,672
I will burn your ass and
serve it up as a hot meal

325
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:02,934
to some shrieking banshees.

326
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,065
Karen.

327
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:18,863
Did I say that out loud?

328
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:19,777
Oops.

329
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,344
Sorry about that.

330
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,475
My bad.

331
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,608
So let's go.

332
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:25,479
Where?

333
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,610
You'll see.

334
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:29,265
Just touch my hand.

335
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,745
But, um...

336
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,181
What.

337
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:33,506
Never touched the hand
of someone like me?

338
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,141
No, no.
It's not that.

339
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,075
It's just you've been out there
with all those other spirits

340
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,019
and when was the last time
you washed your hands.

341
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,058
Just touch my hand.

342
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:53,376
See?

343
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,682
Now we're in the past.

344
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,379
Way back in the day
before your house

345
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,686
was built, before your
neighborhood existed.

346
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:00,079
How far back?

347
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,778
43 years, when you
were a little girl.

348
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:06,128
That's impossible
because I'm only 39.

349
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,434
Right.

350
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,131
Remember, I know everything.

351
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:10,524
OK, girlfriend?

352
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,395
I'm kind of nostalgic that way.

353
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:15,268
Now we need to find
your younger self.

354
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:18,053
I lived about a mile that way.

355
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:19,184
Then here we go.

356
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:20,838
Walk with me.

357
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:23,363
On the first day of Christmas,

358
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:29,064
my true love gave to me a
partridge in a pear tree.

359
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,979
Nine maidens dancing.

360
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,676
Eight maids a
milking, seven swans

361
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,026
a swimming, six geese a laying.

362
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,157
Five...

363
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:37,986
Hasn't it been a mile already?

364
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,509
Just about.

365
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,183
Well, can't we fly or
step into a dimensional...

366
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:42,556
Let's keep it real, Karen.

367
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:43,557
Give me a break.

368
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,341
Well, let go of my hand.

369
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:51,521
They built this highway
after you were a kid.

370
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:52,435
Truck.

371
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,871
Truck.

372
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:56,787
Maybe you should go
back to holding my head.

373
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,441
OK, don't let go.

374
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:05,013
Five golden rings.

375
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,710
Oh, God, no.

376
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:09,041
Four calling birds, three
French hens, two turtle doves.

377
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:12,063
And a partridge in a pear tree.

378
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,064
Here we are.

379
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,195
Oh.

380
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:17,460
Doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

381
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,896
I'm counting down the days.

382
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,768
Christmas time is here again.

383
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:24,163
Everybody's coming to town.

384
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,948
Santa I got someone
special I was thinking of.

385
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:30,125
I'm hoping you can help me out.

386
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:30,995
Look.

387
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,126
Holy Frieda.

388
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,389
Wax that unibrow.

389
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,088
It's our old nativity set.

390
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:44,226
It's the evil twins,
Max and Marty.

391
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:46,881
Remember, these are shadows
of things that have been.

392
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,361
They won't know who we are.

393
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:51,015
So it's like we're invisible?

394
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:51,929
Oh, shit.

395
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,930
No.

396
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,454
I said they don't know you.

397
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,171
I didn't say you were
wearing a cloaking device.

398
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,458
Sorry, Max.

399
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:59,807
How did you know my name?

400
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:01,069
Stranger danger, Max.

401
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,114
Stranger danger.

402
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,073
Mommy!

403
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,509
So be careful what you touch.

404
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,902
Now, come on.

405
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,184
Come on.
What's wrong with you?

406
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:09,991
Let's go.

407
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,036
I don't want to.

408
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,821
It's too much for me.

409
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,388
I don't want to see my mom.

410
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:16,345
What's wrong with you?

411
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,912
Don't you remember anything?

412
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:21,132
Your parents were never
home, especially this night.

413
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,830
You were a latchkey kid.

414
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,268
So the only one that's going
to open that damn door is...

415
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,617
Me.

416
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:30,272
Hi, I'm Karen.

417
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,709
Um, hi.

418
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,756
Would you like to come
in and join us for tea?

419
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:39,716
Um, well, I don't
think you should do that.

420
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,805
Just invite strangers
into your house.

421
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,157
Kitchen cleans and disinfects.

422
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,725
Filled with the
stockings and lots of toys,

423
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:51,337
soldiers deployed.

424
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:54,122
And the miniatures too.

425
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,690
Tell Mom and Dad we
take credit cards too.

426
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,561
Ho, ho, ho.

427
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,650
Here we go, Brother's Toys.

428
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:01,564
Ho, ho, ho.

429
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,262
Man, our old TV.

430
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,525
And now,
back to our movie marathon.

431
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:10,051
Well, kind sir, what
shall I put you down for?

432
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:13,359
They still play this movie for
24 hours every Christmas Eve.

433
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:19,364
Just go with it.

434
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:23,543
Maddy and me...

435
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,022
Maddy and I.

436
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:28,069
Maddy and me are having tea.

437
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,811
Maddy, this is...

438
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:36,512
Ka... uh, Carrie Underwood.

439
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:38,862
And I'm Kanye.

440
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,647
Yay.

441
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:44,085
Carrie Underwood just loves
how you set the table, Maddy.

442
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,391
Oh, honey.

443
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:49,003
You don't want to
do that to the box.

444
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:53,050
These dolls are worth
much more mint in box.

445
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:56,184
If you just hadn't ruined it.

446
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,968
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,666
Karen, it... it's just...

448
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,453
Was I always the
stupid as a child?

449
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:05,411
No.

450
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,151
But you were that lonely.

451
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:11,068
You didn't know it at the
time, but your path to Karen

452
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,853
began this very night.

453
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:15,246
I don't know if it was how
Max and Marty teased you,

454
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,378
Karen's got cooties.

455
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,206
Nobody likes you.

456
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,643
And your parents left you
alone too go to a cocktail

457
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:23,429
party on Christmas Eve.

458
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,216
You were lonely,
but not forever.

459
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,522
Let's see another Christmas.

460
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:30,784
Just touch my chest.

461
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:31,741
You got to be kidding?

462
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:32,655
Come on.

463
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:33,786
Touch it.

464
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:40,097
God, Todd you are such a homo.

465
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:41,838
Todd.

466
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:44,319
Don't talk to your
mother that way or I'll

467
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,626
take back your training bra.

468
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,845
You can't take it back
because you're wearing it.

469
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:50,194
Give it here.

470
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:51,848
- Skittle tits.
- Twinkie.

471
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,154
- Chewbacca.
- Ah!

472
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,024
Skittle tits.

473
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:55,504
Skittle tits.

474
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:58,464
You haven't spoken to
your brother in what?

475
00:22:58,594 --> 00:22:59,813
Years.

476
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:03,382
You know Todd got
married to a man.

477
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,079
Yeah.

478
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:06,602
Well, to each their own.

479
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:09,213
Yeah, well, that's not
what you say when you

480
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,172
pass gay couples on the street.

481
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:14,697
And Todd's your brother, Karen.

482
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:15,611
I miss him.

483
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:16,612
Todd.

484
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:17,874
Stop pulling my hair.

485
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,183
Oh, hello.

486
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,620
Are you the new babysitters?

487
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,056
What?

488
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,668
Oh, so now Mom wants to
start using babysitters.

489
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,670
This is all your fault, Todd.

490
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,846
You've been acting
so weird lately.

491
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,195
This isn't fair.

492
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:35,065
No.

493
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:36,284
You're the babysitter.

494
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,415
I'm just...

495
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,336
You let go.

496
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,164
We're back to the
future, as it were.

497
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,375
Their future, your present.

498
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,470
Who was he?

499
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:50,690
I thought you'd know.
Tenant?

500
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,952
Squatter?

501
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,693
My parents sold
this house years ago.

502
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,308
What am I doing?

503
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,657
I'm a ghost.

504
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:06,314
You can't... you already
shot Rudolph once.

505
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,445
What a dick.

506
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:12,189
Karen, wait up.

507
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
I'll get us a ride.

508
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,434
- You call ride share?
- That was us.

509
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,241
Thank you, brother.

510
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:21,111
Get in.

511
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,678
Get in.

512
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,898
Let's go.

513
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:30,425
Good evening, lady and gentleman
and everything in between.

514
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:34,473
So you're going to the
warehouse district?

515
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,083
You got it.

516
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:37,213
That's right over here.

517
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:40,348
Such a short ride.

518
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,045
Oh, my Gaia.

519
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:43,699
What the hell?

520
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,572
You're the lady
give me zero stars.

521
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:48,356
Then you'll call my
manager to complain

522
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,793
so you can get a free ride.

523
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:51,924
That's the one.

524
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:53,753
Free ride, baby.

525
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:56,253
And she told your manager you
should go back to your country.

526
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:59,759
Oh, hell no.

527
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:01,282
Get out.

528
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,937
Crazy lady and artist
formerly known as Prince.

529
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,242
But we got like a mile to go.

530
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,853
Have fun walking, jackass.

531
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,942
Don't call me again.

532
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,510
That was a perfectly
good free ride share

533
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,512
I had to lie my ass off to get.

534
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,601
Girl, you going there again.

535
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,733
Aren't you getting what
this is all about here?

536
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:18,952
Sorry.
Jeez.

537
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:20,301
Look, I get it.

538
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:21,800
You were picked on
and you were lonely.

539
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:24,174
Then you ended up with a
gloriously gay brother.

540
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:25,872
But you need to
get into the spirit

541
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,874
like "Miracle on 34th Street."

542
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,808
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

543
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,617
Because you're never in
the Christmas spirit.

544
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:37,884
Where are you going?

545
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,644
And this ain't no
"It's A Wonderful Life."

546
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,322
I ain't waiting on no wings.

547
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:43,082
And I've got better things to
do than to listen to your sorry

548
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:44,455
ass whine about this and at.

549
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,674
OK.

550
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:46,632
I need a drink.

551
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:47,502
Where are we?

552
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:48,416
At a bar.

553
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,722
Hallelujah.

554
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,114
Karen, get with the program.

555
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:52,962
This is the present,
the bar is in the past.

556
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,441
You know the cocktail
bar you worked at?

557
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:55,728
The Fizzy Pig?

558
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:56,642
Let's go.

559
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:57,991
Let's go.

560
00:25:58,121 --> 00:25:59,316
Well, to get to that
part of your past,

561
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,820
you've got to touch my...

562
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,777
Hand?

563
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:02,908
No.

564
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:03,649
That'll take us too far back.

565
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,389
Chest?

566
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,697
OK, so if I don't touch your
chest, what do I have to touch?

567
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,090
And you have to hold on tight.

568
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,526
You hear me?

569
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:12,701
Well...

570
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:16,400
Then grab that onion, girl.

571
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:17,793
You're actually going to do it?

572
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:20,187
Just hold my belt. And
you dare not let go

573
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:23,277
or I'll leave you in this
rotten old warehouse all night.

574
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:24,234
Ready?

575
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:27,324
Let's do it.

576
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:28,195
Hang on.

577
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:29,325
Here we go.

578
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:37,987
I got the feeling
that this night getting better.

579
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:39,206
Yeah, I'm a virgin.

580
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:40,696
Why do you guys
always ask me that?

581
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,210
And we going to get together.

582
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
She got some friends.

583
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:47,127
I got my posse and.

584
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,607
No holding back.

585
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,785
Everybody having a good time?

586
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:55,701
All right.

587
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,156
Well, as you know,
here at the Fizzy Pig,

588
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,182
it's a Christmas Eve
tradition that after 7

589
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:02,142
PM, management tends
the bar while our staff

590
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,491
get a chance to...

591
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,536
What comes before part B?

592
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,886
Party.

593
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:08,104
Yeah.

594
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:10,019
Champagne and beer
for everybody.

595
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,283
Best boss ever.

596
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:16,809
Chaz really knows... knew
how to treat people.

597
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:17,939
Good role model.

598
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:19,594
Maybe you should...
Woo!

599
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:20,551
We love you.

600
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,162
She's not listening to me.

601
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:24,381
She's not listening to me.

602
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:25,731
You're not listening to me.

603
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,123
Oh, wait.

604
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:28,934
The staff can't get to
this side of the bar

605
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:31,998
until they first get up
here for one more dance.

606
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:34,869
Oh, my God.

607
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:35,957
That's me.

608
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:37,046
That's me.

609
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:38,417
And show them your appreciation.

610
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:40,049
This is their Christmas bonus.

611
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,443
The bartender with the
most dollars at their feet

612
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:47,013
wins the Fizzy Pig
wreath made of $20 bills.

613
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:48,143
Booyah!

614
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:52,322
94, by the door.

615
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:54,281
DJ one time.

616
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:58,502
Cotton candy, sweet as gold,
let me see your Tootsie Roll.

617
00:27:58,633 --> 00:27:59,939
Tootsie Roll.

618
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,810
Just make that Tootsie Roll.

619
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,246
Tootsie Roll.

620
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:05,596
Just make that Tootsie Roll.

621
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,033
Tootsie Roll.

622
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,296
Let me see that Tootsie Roll.

623
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:10,427
Tootsie Roll.

624
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,081
Just make that Tootsie Roll.

625
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:12,952
To the left.

626
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:13,866
To the left.

627
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:14,996
To the right.

628
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:16,129
To the right.

629
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,391
To the front.

630
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:18,348
To the back.

631
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,349
To the back.

632
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,655
Now slide.
No, no, no.

633
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:21,656
Not like that.

634
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:22,613
You need to twerk.

635
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,093
Like this.

636
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,504
Shake it like a
Polaroid picture.

637
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,140
To the right.

638
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,270
To the right.

639
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,446
To the right.
To the right.

640
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:30,404
To the front.

641
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:31,405
To the front.

642
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:32,275
To the back.

643
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:33,406
To the back.

644
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,801
Now dip, baby, dip.

645
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,717
Oh.

646
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,504
Well, well, well.

647
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,201
It's obvious who our winner is.

648
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:47,029
Let's hear it for Tonya.

649
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:51,947
To Tonya.

650
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:54,341
To Tonya.

651
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:55,255
Tonya.

652
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:57,039
That's all right, girl.

653
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,610
You may have had a better chance
if they played Barry Manilow.

654
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:02,915
I have to pee.

655
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:03,872
What?

656
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:04,830
Seriously, I need to pee.

657
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
What?

658
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,881
We were having
fun out there, no?

659
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:14,927
Such a small matter to
make these silly folks

660
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:16,972
so full of gratitude.

661
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,103
It isn't that.

662
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:19,670
No?

663
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,499
Our boss had the
power to make us happy.

664
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,414
Paper.

665
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:27,113
Working here could have been
a bitch, but he made it fun.

666
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:28,027
Until...

667
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:29,419
Until?

668
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,031
Until Tonya, the
black beauty ruined it.

669
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,361
You know that's a horse, right?

670
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:37,427
Oh.

671
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:39,579
So she was Black and was better
than you, so now brothers

672
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:40,822
and sisters, watch out.

673
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,912
It's a lifetime of
payback from Karen.

674
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:44,826
Crap.

675
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:47,176
What?

676
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,307
Well, there's this little
girl that lives next door

677
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:53,139
and I may have gotten
her mom arrested.

678
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:54,096
What the butt?

679
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,402
I can explain.

680
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:56,772
I know what you did, but I can't

681
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:57,970
wait to hear your version.

682
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,884
Never mind.

683
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:01,016
Just let me finish.

684
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:02,148
Can you just get off.

685
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,105
Easy.

686
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,276
You're like riding a bull.

687
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:05,804
Let me finish.

688
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:08,154
OK, hold on tight or
you know what will happen.

689
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:09,808
I will but it's
kind of hard to do that

690
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,461
and reach around for myself.

691
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:12,767
Try this.

692
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,769
Take your free
hand and grab here.

693
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,206
I'm trying, but
I'm not a contortionist.

694
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:18,599
OK, this isn't working.

695
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:19,861
I'll tell you what.

696
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:21,230
Just go ahead and
take all of this.

697
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:22,254
But it's so damn little.

698
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:23,125
You got it?

699
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,039
OK, now pull.

700
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:24,910
Gently.

701
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,824
Gently.

702
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:28,957
What the fu...

703
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:30,263
About yanked my ear off.

704
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:31,873
It's a clip on.

705
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,851
As long as that earrings
on somewhere, we're good.

706
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,746
You don't have to
touch anything.

707
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,477
Why didn't we do that
from the beginning?

708
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:39,315
And wash your hands.

709
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,013
- We still at the Fizzy Pig?
- No.

710
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:42,143
Look closer.

711
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,190
Same place, different time.

712
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,148
Chaz sold out, but
you stayed on to work

713
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,411
for the new owner who
turned the frickin' awesome

714
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,109
Fizzy Pig into the...

715
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,588
I can't even say it.

716
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,416
Pigtails Beauty Salon.

717
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,421
This is going to be interesting.

718
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,343
Karen, you took all
the paper towels.

719
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,846
Karen, that's not fair.
I've been here all day.

720
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,653
I'm tired.

721
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:13,567
OK?

722
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:15,395
It's Christmas Eve.

723
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:17,939
Jackie's closing early today and
I'm not staying a minute later.

724
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:19,921
I've got a party to
go to and so do you.

725
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,401
Oh, so you're
just going to leave

726
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:24,143
Mrs. Benowitz here like that?

727
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:25,579
You... no.

728
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:27,537
You let her in here 10
minutes before closing

729
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:28,712
without an appointment.

730
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:30,801
She's a three hour job.

731
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:34,196
And your boss would like you
to finish that lucrative job.

732
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:35,719
And as your supervisor...

733
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,720
Supervisor?

734
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:38,374
OK.

735
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,811
Listen, sis, I joined this
freak show to help make you

736
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,204
look good in front of Jackie.

737
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:44,859
Because you know
how I can do the do.

738
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,252
Oh, right.

739
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:48,384
You're Sherwin-Williams
because you can do...

740
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:49,515
Any color.

741
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,257
Yes.

742
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:53,539
But Karen, this poor woman came
in here looking for directions

743
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:54,608
to the kosher deli.

744
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:56,131
And you talked
her into a dye job

745
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:57,785
so that you could
show off for Jackie.

746
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,483
Todd, I swear to God...

747
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:01,441
Jackie.

748
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,704
Oh, what up biatch?

749
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,706
You got another
mare in the chair.

750
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,360
You make that coin, care bear.

751
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:10,580
That's right.

752
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,060
She was a rough one.

753
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:14,193
Had a whole lot going on here.

754
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:16,673
She was everything
I wanted to be.

755
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:18,042
Always looked out
for number one.

756
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:19,459
Knew how to work the system.

757
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:20,808
Screw everybody else.

758
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,157
I learned everything from her.

759
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:26,596
Hey, Todd.

760
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,511
Hi, Michael.

761
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:29,642
What about Chaz?

762
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,253
The greatest boss ever.

763
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:34,517
He was fun and all,
but Jackie was fierce.

764
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:37,825
There's a difference
between fierce and ferocious.

765
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,611
Mr. Deliveryman, I am not
going to accept this package.

766
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:45,224
There is a scrape on the back.

767
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:46,790
That's just a
scratch on the box.

768
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,401
Inside, it should be just fine.

769
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:49,837
Return it.

770
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,752
And tomorrow, I am going
to call the company

771
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:53,884
and I am going to
get a full refund.

772
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,756
And I am going to
get a free order

773
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:58,454
because of my inconvenience.

774
00:32:58,585 --> 00:32:59,954
There's standing
up for your rights,

775
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,718
and then there's just not right.

776
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,591
And then I'm going
to call your manager

777
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:07,681
and I'm going to report you
for manhandling my packages

778
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,596
like yesterday's garbage.

779
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,685
And here, I thought
that you people were

780
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:16,124
supposed to be gentle and tidy.

781
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:17,908
That was cold.

782
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,954
Yeah.

783
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,105
What are you talking about?

784
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:21,956
It's just...

785
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,219
Don't embarrass me, Todd.

786
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,482
I have been tolerating
you being queer since you

787
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,093
were eight years old.

788
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,245
And now you're only defending
this fairy because you...

789
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:34,490
Well, I am offended
for everyone.

790
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:37,798
Karen, can you not see
what you're turning into?

791
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:39,539
It's better than who you are.

792
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:45,414
I'm done.

793
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:46,545
I am done.

794
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,374
I quit.

795
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:49,810
You can't quit.

796
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
You're fired.

797
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:54,989
Look at you.

798
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,123
You are going places.

799
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:02,040
Now, you are going to have to
take care of Mrs. Benowitz.

800
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,042
And try to get her to pay cash.

801
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:06,740
Boy, those people
always carry cash.

802
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,743
And I've got about a million
Christmas parties to get to.

803
00:34:09,873 --> 00:34:12,615
But don't worry, I'm going to
get to your little progressive.

804
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:13,834
So I'll see you later.

805
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:17,490
Ta ta and ho ho, ho.

806
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:20,884
Merry Christmas to me.

807
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,973
She's going to
my party and she...

808
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,105
Yeah, whatever.

809
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:31,721
Entitled white woman.

810
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:33,636
Your parents messed you
up, but that Jackie...

811
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,073
I want to go home.

812
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:36,639
I have more stuff.

813
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,640
Like, don't you want to
see when your mom and dad...

814
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,207
What?
Died?

815
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:41,905
And ultimately, abandoned
me like everybody else.

816
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:44,082
No, I don't.

817
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:46,301
I was going to say got
you a car for Christmas.

818
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,260
I didn't need a car.

819
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,652
I needed them.

820
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:53,047
OK, take off the earring.

821
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:54,178
Give it here.

822
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,793
So you can jump
from place to place.

823
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:01,142
Yeah.

824
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,057
I was just messing
with you back there.

825
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:04,885
It was fun walking
around and driving

826
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:07,931
and stuff until things got heavy
with your brother and Jackie.

827
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:10,020
Well, got to go.

828
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:11,196
Wait, no.

829
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:12,110
What?

830
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Oh.

831
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:15,765
This is just a dream, right?

832
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:19,726
Karen, considering that I am
the embodiment of all things

833
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:24,034
you've grown to diminish,
disdain and detest,

834
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,819
I guess it's more
of a nightmare.

835
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:30,389
OK, good.

836
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,565
It's just a nightmare.

837
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:33,566
Totally fake.

838
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:36,351
All in the past.

839
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:37,482
Where's my Xanax?

840
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:52,541
Joy to the
world, the Lord is come.

841
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:58,199
Let Earth receive her King.

842
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:03,378
Let every heart
prepare Him room.

843
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:04,771
Come in.

844
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,468
And heaven and nature sing.

845
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,904
And heaven and nature sing.

846
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,819
And heaven and nature sing.

847
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,125
And heaven...

848
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:14,172
And heaven and nature sing.

849
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,307
I love this stuff.

850
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:21,483
It cleans and disinfect.

851
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:22,789
Hey, that's my robe.

852
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,094
I know, right?

853
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:27,315
Thank you for the present.

854
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:28,316
Do you get it?

855
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:29,274
Do you see what I did there?

856
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:30,927
Thank you for the present.

857
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:32,233
Right.

858
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:33,689
Because you're the
ghost of Christmas...

859
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:34,757
Present.

860
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,716
Yes, that's right.

861
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:37,934
You're not dumb, Karen.

862
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:39,458
That's not why
everyone hates you.

863
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:40,588
What?

864
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:41,851
Who hates me?

865
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:42,765
I'll kill him.

866
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:43,679
Right.

867
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,637
Now this is the problem.

868
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:45,767
It's all that attitude.

869
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:47,379
It's giving people stank face.

870
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:48,771
Oh.

871
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:52,384
And you can stop it
right now with that RBF.

872
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:53,514
Come on.

873
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,605
You... the Resting Bitch Face.

874
00:36:56,736 --> 00:36:59,434
I don't...

875
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:00,957
That's is where I
carry my tension.

876
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,350
Oh, OK.

877
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:04,023
You can tell yourself
all you want, dear.

878
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:06,180
But you've got loads of
ways to fix that these days.

879
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:07,660
Creams, injections.

880
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,661
I didn't have that.

881
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:09,618
I died young.

882
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:10,576
It was a blessing really.

883
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:11,751
All right, whatever.

884
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,241
I can't think of
anyone who doesn't

885
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,058
think I am a terrific person.

886
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:21,239
Karen, you do make me laugh.

887
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:22,501
Fine.

888
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:24,329
Show me all the people
I've pissed off.

889
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:25,852
Ooh, all right.

890
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,506
Let's get down to it.

891
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:30,117
Grab hold of my robe.

892
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,466
- My robe.
- My robe.

893
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:34,034
- Mine.
- It's mine.

894
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:35,620
I found it in your
bedroom and I put it on.

895
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:36,882
And now it's mine.
It looks good on me.

896
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:38,306
I got it complimentary
after arguing

897
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:39,586
with the manager of the hotel.

898
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,476
He gave it to you
to get rid of you.

899
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:43,261
Don't kid yourself, Karen.

900
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:44,131
Whatever.

901
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,654
Hold on.

902
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:46,892
Oh, do you see what I did there?

903
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:47,700
I said hold on.

904
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,918
But I meant like, wait.

905
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:52,095
Not like hold on
hold on to my robe.

906
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:52,966
Wow.

907
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,141
Intense.

908
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,577
English language.

909
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,187
This way.

910
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:58,841
Please, don't cut
through the bushes.

911
00:37:58,972 --> 00:37:59,972
Shortcut.

912
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:00,887
Look at this.

913
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,323
This is fantastic, Karen.

914
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:03,846
Thank you.

915
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:07,589
We're going to need some
room for takeoff, so...

916
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,938
Yep, this looks all right.

917
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:09,852
Here.

918
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:10,983
Hold on.

919
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:12,464
Fine.

920
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:13,594
Let's go!

921
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:21,734
Oh.

922
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:23,518
What the hell happened?

923
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:26,608
I saw the Earth from up there
and now we're back at my house.

924
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:27,914
Oh.

925
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:30,133
No, we're at your
neighbor's house.

926
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:31,657
See, that's the property line.

927
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:34,224
We were over there
and now we're here.

928
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:35,355
Why?

929
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,749
What do you mean, Karen?

930
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,185
Why space flight?

931
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,622
Well, because when
you have all of this,

932
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:43,408
you might as well
use it, you know?

933
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:45,061
Now let's walk through a wall.

934
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,417
Ow.

935
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:53,907
You have to hold
on to this, Karen.

936
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:54,983
You ain't Slimer.

937
00:38:57,683 --> 00:38:58,683
Oh, God.

938
00:38:58,727 --> 00:38:59,835
I didn't know anybody was home.

939
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:01,034
Calm down, Karen.

940
00:39:01,164 --> 00:39:02,862
They can't see or hear you.

941
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:05,212
But in the past,
they could see us.

942
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,996
The past is Gary's
thing, all right?

943
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:07,910
Gary?

944
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:08,824
Yes, Gary.

945
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:10,348
We have names, you know?

946
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:12,915
What's your name?

947
00:39:13,046 --> 00:39:13,916
It doesn't matter.

948
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:15,265
Listen, I need you to focus.

949
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:16,876
Focus, all right?

950
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:18,660
As long as you hold
on to my robe...

951
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:19,922
My robe.

952
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:23,361
My robe... they
can't see or hear you.

953
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:25,275
And we can walk through
walls and stuff.

954
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,277
It's like we're voyeurs.

955
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,280
Now look, what you've
done to that little girl.

956
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,804
Mommy, I'm scared.

957
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,588
What are you scared of, baby?

958
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,589
Ms. Karen.

959
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,156
Our neighbor?

960
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:37,810
Dickens is scared of her too.

961
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,680
See?

962
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,161
Why.

963
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,691
Ms. Karen said
they're going to slap

964
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:43,931
her ass while you're in jail.

965
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:46,122
What?

966
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:47,602
Because of me.

967
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:50,649
Honey, that is
not going to happen.

968
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:52,520
I don't think that's
what Ms. Karen meant.

969
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:55,567
Come here.

970
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:56,697
Did she just say bitch?

971
00:39:56,742 --> 00:39:57,873
Dog.

972
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:00,789
I'm sure she was
talking about the dog.

973
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,704
Now, Dad's getting
cleaned up, so

974
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:06,926
let's get you ready for tonight,
the light show on Jeater Bend.

975
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:08,773
We need to check it out
tonight because tomorrow

976
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:10,688
night, guess who's going to
be their Christmas angel?

977
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:12,235
- Me.
- Mm-hmm.

978
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:16,588
Oh, and be sure to grab your
money for Candy Cane Lane.

979
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:18,720
Will Ms. Karen be there?

980
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:21,593
Honey, I know Ms. Karen can
be a bit cranky sometimes,

981
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:24,813
you know, because she's old.

982
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:26,336
Yeah, old and um...

983
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:27,467
Rude?

984
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:28,904
Yeah, and a bit rude and...

985
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:30,471
And smelly.

986
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,038
What?

987
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:34,867
Scotty says she smells
like a elephant's vajayjay.

988
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,695
Your friend Scotty Smith?

989
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,436
What's a vajayjay?

990
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:39,566
OK, why are we here?

991
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:40,438
Shh.

992
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:41,700
It's just getting good.

993
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,049
Why are we here, please?

994
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,267
You're getting distracted.

995
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:45,181
Here.

996
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,312
Take this side.

997
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:51,013
Oh, great.

998
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:52,493
Another bathroom.

999
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:57,150
We're here because you
need to open your eyes.

1000
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,717
Oh, they're open.

1001
00:40:58,847 --> 00:40:59,979
What?

1002
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:01,415
Oh.

1003
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:03,069
Will you focus?

1004
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,291
OK, baby, let's open
up these curls, OK?

1005
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:20,869
Honey, the doctors told
us this would happen.

1006
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,786
Your hair is beautiful,
but it's just hair.

1007
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:27,180
It will grow back, I promise.

1008
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,834
Tonight, let's give it a bow.

1009
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:30,531
Yeah?

1010
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:32,359
It's Christmas Day tomorrow.

1011
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,230
I'll wear a hat
to church, Mommy.

1012
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:37,930
I want the people to think about
baby Jesus, not worry about me.

1013
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,280
That's your job.

1014
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,934
You are so right about that.

1015
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,414
And I don't want
nobody taking my job.

1016
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,027
Let's take your
special medicine, baby.

1017
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,601
Nice robe.

1018
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,215
What?

1019
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:04,217
You know, what's...

1020
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:06,306
What's wrong with, um...

1021
00:42:06,436 --> 00:42:08,656
You don't know her name, do you?

1022
00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:10,745
How long have you
been neighbors?

1023
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:12,181
I don't know.
About...

1024
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:13,313
Five years.

1025
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:14,706
That's right.

1026
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:15,663
Nia.

1027
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:16,969
Nia.

1028
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:20,886
OK, so what's wrong with Nia?

1029
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:22,540
Leukemia.

1030
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,779
She's on a cocktail of pills
that are definitely going

1031
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:25,843
to make her hair fall out.

1032
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:27,501
But if she stays
on the treatment,

1033
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,982
she's got a fairly good chance.

1034
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:31,113
I didn't know that.

1035
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:32,898
Well, did you know that this

1036
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:36,336
is just about the last of the
pills because money's dried up.

1037
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,643
They've got three
mortgages on this house

1038
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:41,602
and she can forget about any
presents tomorrow morning,

1039
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:45,301
because now they have to
choose between meds and food.

1040
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:53,048
So I've got some work
to do at the office.

1041
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:56,878
And I will try to see two
at the late show after.

1042
00:42:57,009 --> 00:43:00,055
Oh, Daddy, I almost forgot.

1043
00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:01,467
On your way to
work, could you take

1044
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:03,102
this letter to the big mailbox?

1045
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:04,930
Sure.

1046
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,324
I put two stamps on it so it
should get there really fast.

1047
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:11,458
I didn't send anything earlier
because Santa is really busy.

1048
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,374
But now, I'm kind
of freaking out.

1049
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:16,028
OK, Nini.

1050
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:17,682
It should make it
there tonight easy.

1051
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,161
Don't open it.

1052
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,686
It's for Santa.

1053
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:23,731
Oh, right.

1054
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:25,037
Sorry.

1055
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:25,951
All right, baby.

1056
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:27,081
Get your boots on.

1057
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:27,996
I'm going to be right back, OK?

1058
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,302
OK, Mommy.
Bye, Daddy.

1059
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:30,432
Bye, baby.

1060
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:37,199
They're going to
read the letter.

1061
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:38,243
They're going to
read the letter.

1062
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:39,267
This way.

1063
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,270
Ow.

1064
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:47,973
You let go of my robe.

1065
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:49,714
My robe.

1066
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:51,019
- Nia.
- He's coming.

1067
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:51,933
He's coming.

1068
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:53,064
Grab it.

1069
00:43:58,766 --> 00:43:59,549
Oh.

1070
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,073
Sorry about that.

1071
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:02,465
Oh, come on.

1072
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,905
That was weird.

1073
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:10,865
Sounded like Karen
from next door was...

1074
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:12,780
What's the matter, honey?

1075
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:17,916
I know that Mommy and
Daddy help you get presents.

1076
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:21,571
And I know they don't
have money because of me.

1077
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:26,838
So if you have
any leftovers kids don't want,

1078
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:28,274
I'll give them a home.

1079
00:44:28,404 --> 00:44:31,886
Oh, my god, my baby.

1080
00:44:36,978 --> 00:44:42,592
And if one of the leftovers
happens to be a skateboard,

1081
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:43,723
that would be fun.

1082
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,947
Most of all, please
talk to God so my family

1083
00:44:49,077 --> 00:44:52,994
can be happy again.

1084
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:56,824
We have to get her
to something, anything.

1085
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:59,566
I have to go.

1086
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,697
I'll come home.

1087
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:09,837
OK, Christmas angel, let's go.

1088
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:14,973
Can't they just get her a
skateboard or whatever by...

1089
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,670
By what?

1090
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:18,977
By selling some things?

1091
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:21,893
Robin here has become
an expert at eBay,

1092
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:23,982
selling anything they can spare.

1093
00:45:24,112 --> 00:45:26,419
And Nia was trying
to help her mom

1094
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:28,290
and dad by selling
some hot chocolate

1095
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:30,466
and spreading Christmas cheer.

1096
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:31,424
But, no.

1097
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:32,294
Some old...

1098
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:34,383
OK, I didn't know.

1099
00:45:34,514 --> 00:45:37,604
Well, you need to know
that you don't know.

1100
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,564
And you're random
acts of unkindness

1101
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:45,525
ain't working, as wonderfully
narcissistic as they are.

1102
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:47,440
Yeah, well, I don't
even know that word.

1103
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,570
You should.

1104
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:54,142
So what's going
to happen to her?

1105
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:55,970
To Nia?

1106
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:59,757
Well, if she stops taking the
medication, she's going to be...

1107
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:01,846
What was it you always say?

1108
00:46:01,976 --> 00:46:03,282
Toast.

1109
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:04,457
Toast.

1110
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:05,806
Toast.

1111
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:07,242
Bugger.

1112
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:08,243
We're going to be late
for the annual toast.

1113
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:09,549
Let's go.

1114
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:10,724
Son of bitch!

1115
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:23,868
Don't do that again.

1116
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:25,260
To...

1117
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,218
Todd.

1118
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:27,915
My sister Karen.

1119
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:31,527
May she have a very
Merry Christmas.

1120
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:33,616
Cheers.

1121
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:34,747
To Karen.

1122
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:36,794
It's a nice place.

1123
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:39,318
It looks like Todd's still
with what's his name.

1124
00:46:39,448 --> 00:46:40,928
Michael.

1125
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:43,888
Arrogant kale.

1126
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:45,803
This mojito needs more vodka.

1127
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:46,978
Really.

1128
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:49,807
A mojito is made with rum, Todd.

1129
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:51,852
He hasn't changed at all.

1130
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:55,377
Toddy, you know
I love you so much.

1131
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:56,901
And every Christmas
Eve, we toast

1132
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:58,816
to our friends and family.

1133
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:00,513
Yes.

1134
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:04,952
And you always raise a glass
to your sister Karen, but...

1135
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,301
But what?

1136
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:08,564
But when was the
last time you seen her?

1137
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:09,695
Texted her?

1138
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:10,958
Talk to her?

1139
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:15,354
I mean, well, you
know, she's kind of a...

1140
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:17,965
Kind of a what?

1141
00:47:18,096 --> 00:47:19,096
You know.

1142
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:21,447
Well, stick up for me, brother.

1143
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:25,277
Kind of... excuse me.

1144
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:28,367
She's kind of a evil queen.

1145
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,326
So does that make
you "Snow White?"

1146
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:33,154
Oh, right.

1147
00:47:33,285 --> 00:47:36,549
Or maybe, , a demon
that eats children's eyeballs.

1148
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,443
Yeah, Karen would eat
a children's eyeball.

1149
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,121
I would... yes.

1150
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,601
You know, she walks in a room,
it's very Darth Vader tone.

1151
00:47:45,732 --> 00:47:46,559
Yeah.

1152
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:47,952
It's the mouth breathing.

1153
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:48,822
Mm-hmm.

1154
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:49,997
Yeah, very much.

1155
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:51,322
You know what she reminds me of?

1156
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:53,348
You in "Lord of
the Rings" there's

1157
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:55,176
that... that giant
tower that's just an

1158
00:47:55,307 --> 00:47:57,178
eyeball that's like
staring, looking

1159
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:59,398
for issues to complain about.

1160
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:01,182
She reminds... she
reminds me of someone

1161
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,663
that needs surgery to fix
everything about her face.

1162
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:07,362
Kind of like an Ursula.

1163
00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:08,494
Yes.

1164
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:09,974
Ursula could go for surgery.

1165
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:12,106
Or Cruella de Vil.

1166
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:13,412
- Whoa.
- Sure.

1167
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:14,892
Sure.

1168
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:16,739
Well, Disney villains
notwithstanding, I was

1169
00:48:16,763 --> 00:48:17,938
thinking more of the Grinch.

1170
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:18,808
Oh, yes.

1171
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:19,940
Yeah.

1172
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:21,071
Am I right?

1173
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:23,291
There you go.

1174
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:26,599
To my sister Karen, not quite
a nun if you're comparing,

1175
00:48:26,729 --> 00:48:27,861
more like the Grinch.

1176
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:29,907
You can't stop staring.

1177
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:32,344
A real hot mess.

1178
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:33,823
Um...

1179
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:35,956
And let's hope
that she's barren.

1180
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:40,047
Baby.

1181
00:48:40,178 --> 00:48:41,285
I'm going to go turn this
mojito into a margarita.

1182
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:42,049
Excuse me.

1183
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,180
Excuse me.

1184
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:49,491
I know you laugh right
now to keep from crying.

1185
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:52,103
I don't blame her
for resenting me.

1186
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:53,495
What?

1187
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:56,498
Growing up, she took
the brunt of the abuse.

1188
00:48:56,629 --> 00:49:00,807
She got into so many
fights defending me.

1189
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:07,031
Sadness, anger, resentment.

1190
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:10,643
It takes a toll on a person.

1191
00:49:10,773 --> 00:49:11,773
She hides behind...

1192
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:17,171
I miss her.

1193
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:20,000
I miss the old Karen.

1194
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:21,915
I'm so sorry.

1195
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:27,703
Hey, look, someday
you're entitled,

1196
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:29,444
arrogant sister
will come around.

1197
00:49:29,575 --> 00:49:31,011
Entitled?

1198
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:32,534
Arrogant?

1199
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:35,146
What have I ever said that
is entitled or arrogant?

1200
00:49:35,276 --> 00:49:37,496
Can I see your manager?

1201
00:49:37,626 --> 00:49:40,151
Do you know how much money I
spend at this place every week?

1202
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:42,370
You're in America,
speak English.

1203
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,633
Go back to where you came from.

1204
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:46,896
That doesn't apply to me.

1205
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:49,464
I'm being discriminated against.

1206
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:51,336
Do you know who I am?

1207
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:53,338
All Lives Matter.

1208
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:55,818
You lost my business forever.

1209
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:58,691
I mean, really.

1210
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:01,476
Have you listened
to yourself, Karen?

1211
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:04,914
Like really listened
to yourself?

1212
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:06,394
My brother hates me.

1213
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,486
He doesn't hate you.

1214
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:13,836
He feels sorry for you.

1215
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:14,967
Come on.

1216
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,492
I want to show you something.

1217
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:19,059
Calm down, Karen.

1218
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,149
I'm not going to launch
you into the sky this time.

1219
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,151
Look.

1220
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:26,284
Come on.

1221
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:29,939
You're not holding my robe
and everyone can see you.

1222
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:30,810
My robe.

1223
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,160
My robe.

1224
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,814
My robe.

1225
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:37,469
All right, let's see what
your neighborhood is up to.

1226
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:40,863
Are you ready for Christmas?

1227
00:50:40,994 --> 00:50:43,866
Are you decking the halls?

1228
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:46,869
Are you ready for Christmas?

1229
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,829
We'll be having a ball.

1230
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:52,832
Are you ready for Christmas?

1231
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:55,835
Are you having some fun.

1232
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:58,359
Are you ready for Christmas?

1233
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,318
It's only just begun.

1234
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:01,319
Oh.

1235
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:02,449
Oh.

1236
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:04,104
Look at this beauty.

1237
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:07,412
Bring pride and joy.

1238
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:08,587
These people are nuts.

1239
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:09,955
These people are your neighbors.

1240
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:10,763
Really?

1241
00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:12,156
Yeah.

1242
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:13,785
I never drive-through
this part of town.

1243
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:14,809
What's that up ahead?

1244
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:16,508
Oh, no.

1245
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:19,467
You don't want to see any
more of this flash and trash.

1246
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:21,208
I never called it that.

1247
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:24,429
You do make me laugh, Karen.

1248
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:28,172
Are you ready for Christmas?

1249
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:31,175
Are you decking the halls?

1250
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:33,699
Are you ready for Christmas?

1251
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:36,658
You'll be having a ball.

1252
00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:39,661
Are you ready for Christmas?

1253
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:42,142
Are you having some fun?

1254
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:45,145
Are you ready for Christmas?

1255
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:47,234
It's only just begun.

1256
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:48,148
Oh.

1257
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:49,018
Oh.

1258
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:50,629
It's only just begun.

1259
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:53,066
The lights on Jeater Bend.

1260
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:57,201
Behold, the wonderment of a
multicolored tinkling display

1261
00:51:57,331 --> 00:51:59,681
of mechanized electronic joy.

1262
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:01,640
It's indescribably beautiful.

1263
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,729
It reminds me of
the 4th of July.

1264
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:06,601
Too bad it's going to be shut
down permanently after tonight.

1265
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:08,081
What?

1266
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:10,518
Unfortunately, someone
said this abomination

1267
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:13,086
was breaking the noise
ordinance and causing

1268
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:14,783
traffic to slow down.

1269
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:16,742
Oh, and then they
threatened to sue.

1270
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:18,570
Oh.

1271
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,269
Yeah, apparently, some people
have to rush home to get to...

1272
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,000
Now remind me, Karen,
what is it you have

1273
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:26,969
to rush home to get to again?

1274
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,188
Exactly.

1275
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,644
You didn't even
know what this was.

1276
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:32,149
And because it minorly
inconvenienced you,

1277
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:34,499
you shut it down.

1278
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:37,023
So they support a different
charity every night?

1279
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,154
Yeah.

1280
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:39,808
Isn't that nice?

1281
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:42,420
Oh, and guess he was supposed
to be tomorrow night.

1282
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:43,550
Mm-hmm.

1283
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:46,032
Well, that ain't happening.

1284
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,816
Oh, look.

1285
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:50,307
We're just in time to see them
break the news to little Nia.

1286
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:59,176
So shines a good deed
in a weary world.

1287
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:00,786
Booyah.

1288
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:02,416
Bet you feel like poop on
a platter now, don't you?

1289
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,267
Hmm?

1290
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:07,314
Next up, a bawdy bordello.

1291
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:08,489
Giddy up, little red.

1292
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,491
Yeehaw!

1293
00:53:28,857 --> 00:53:30,903
That's not a bordello.

1294
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:33,384
It's the homeless
mother's shelter.

1295
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:34,298
Yep.

1296
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:36,300
You got it.

1297
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,953
And guess who works...

1298
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:40,434
Correction, worked
at the shelter.

1299
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:45,787
Oh, for god's sakes.

1300
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:47,615
Seriously?

1301
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:49,946
What do I have to do with the
homeless mother's shelter?

1302
00:53:53,578 --> 00:53:58,147
That house for street walkers,
let it die and be done with it.

1303
00:53:58,278 --> 00:54:01,281
Abstinence.

1304
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:03,457
OK, I know what I said.

1305
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:05,981
Don't make me dredge
up the past again, Karen.

1306
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:07,244
That's Gary's job.

1307
00:54:10,377 --> 00:54:13,337
Am I too late to
drop off packages?

1308
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:14,816
Well, it's Christmas Eve.

1309
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:15,687
Um...

1310
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:17,428
I know.

1311
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:21,127
I know I'm very late, but I
hope somebody can use these.

1312
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,738
I'm sure they could.

1313
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:24,869
Thank you so much.

1314
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:27,438
And Merry Christmas.

1315
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,570
Yes, uh, Merry Christmas.

1316
00:54:35,054 --> 00:54:37,361
So what happens to, um...

1317
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:38,884
To...
Chris.

1318
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:40,014
His name is Chris.

1319
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,849
So what happens?

1320
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,807
Ugh.

1321
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:50,591
I do the present, Karen.

1322
00:54:50,722 --> 00:54:51,505
I don't do the t.

1323
00:54:51,636 --> 00:54:52,898
That's Gary's gig.

1324
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:55,466
And I definitely don't
do what Damon does.

1325
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:56,597
Damon?

1326
00:54:56,728 --> 00:54:57,728
Who's Damon?

1327
00:55:07,956 --> 00:55:08,956
What am I doing?

1328
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:33,765
He just broke into
that donation box.

1329
00:55:33,895 --> 00:55:35,244
He did?

1330
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:37,029
He's stealing those gifts.

1331
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:38,204
Karen.

1332
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,684
Who does he think he is?

1333
00:55:39,814 --> 00:55:40,946
Karen.

1334
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:42,861
You're going there again.

1335
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:44,297
Read the room.

1336
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:46,081
Haven't you learned anything?

1337
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:48,408
I've learned that my next door
neighbor is a common criminal.

1338
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:49,258
I should have known better.

1339
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:50,389
Thief.

1340
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:56,309
Everyone can see
and hear you, Karen.

1341
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,659
If you're so eager to judge,
why don't you run after him

1342
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,618
and make that citizen's arrest.

1343
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:01,532
What?

1344
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:02,662
No.

1345
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:06,928
I didn't mean it.

1346
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:08,060
OK.

1347
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,628
So instead, go home.

1348
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:12,107
Do what your neighbors do.

1349
00:56:12,238 --> 00:56:15,241
Try to treat every day
as though it's a gift.

1350
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,025
You know that's
why they call it...

1351
00:56:17,156 --> 00:56:18,505
The present.

1352
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:20,072
Exactly.

1353
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:21,202
Ta ta, Karen.

1354
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:27,861
My robe.

1355
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:48,639
9:00.

1356
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:50,031
I'm up.

1357
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:52,556
Hi, um, Karen, right?

1358
00:57:52,686 --> 00:57:53,686
I'm Damon.

1359
00:57:56,908 --> 00:57:58,475
I'm the ghost of future Chris...

1360
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:02,042
Right.

1361
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,571
Oh, my God.

1362
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:08,833
Oh, my God.

1363
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:10,617
It was just a dream.

1364
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:22,890
- What do you want from me?
- I'm sorry.

1365
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:24,196
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1366
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:25,806
Joy told me she
was done with you.

1367
00:58:25,937 --> 00:58:27,895
And Gary was way done with you.

1368
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:31,072
And Coochie Chain... we
call her Coochie Chain...

1369
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:33,248
She told me to be
here right at 9:00.

1370
00:58:33,379 --> 00:58:34,379
So I thought that...

1371
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:35,512
Wait.

1372
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:37,470
That last ghost,
her name was Joy?

1373
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:38,384
Is Joy.

1374
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,733
Yeah, ghost of present.

1375
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:42,301
Like jump for joy,
which I would never...

1376
00:58:42,431 --> 00:58:44,042
I would never jump for joy.

1377
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:46,914
Or like feeling merry,
which I would also never do,

1378
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:47,872
by the way.

1379
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:50,004
Um, yeah, no.

1380
00:58:50,135 --> 00:58:52,703
OK, the first ghost,
his name was Gary?

1381
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:56,141
And you're Damon,
god the future?

1382
00:58:56,271 --> 00:58:57,316
Hell no.

1383
00:58:57,446 --> 00:58:59,318
Ghost, not god.

1384
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:01,538
That would be radical.

1385
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:02,713
But yeah, no.

1386
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:05,019
Ghost of Christmases
yet to come.

1387
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,412
Yeah.

1388
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,633
And you're the last
of the ghostly trio?

1389
00:59:09,763 --> 00:59:13,201
Those guys are more
associated with Casper.

1390
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:14,812
Yeah, sure.

1391
00:59:14,942 --> 00:59:20,339
Well, Damon, I'm
getting really tired

1392
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:21,949
of you and your
friends haunting me

1393
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,734
or whatever it is
that you're doing.

1394
00:59:23,864 --> 00:59:25,170
You've dredged up my past.

1395
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,954
You show me things
in the present that

1396
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:29,000
made me feel really depressed.

1397
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:33,004
Let's just get this over with
so I can get my beauty sleep.

1398
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:34,135
Sorry, yeah.

1399
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:36,137
OK, sorry.

1400
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:37,661
I'll show you how this works.

1401
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:38,966
What do I have to touch?

1402
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:39,880
Huh?
Oh.

1403
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:40,751
Oh, yeah.

1404
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:41,752
Touch this.

1405
00:59:41,882 --> 00:59:42,927
I'm kidding.

1406
00:59:43,057 --> 00:59:44,493
You don't have to
touch anything.

1407
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:48,280
You just have to walk
through via the void.

1408
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:49,760
The what?

1409
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:50,890
The void.

1410
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:04,688
Oh, by the way, you, uh,
might want to wear these.

1411
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:05,950
No.

1412
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,343
I would not be
caught dead in those.

1413
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:09,474
I just...

1414
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:17,614
OK, sure.

1415
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:23,402
Uh, follow me to experience
the shadows of what will be.

1416
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:38,504
The future is looking bright.

1417
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,246
Whoa.

1418
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:42,900
That was me.

1419
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,815
Sorry.

1420
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:46,468
Bad hip.

1421
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:47,599
Damon?

1422
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,700
Damon?

1423
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:03,311
This didn't work at all.

1424
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:04,748
It's not working.

1425
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:06,401
Damon?

1426
01:01:06,532 --> 01:01:07,881
Where are you?

1427
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:15,759
I fear you were not the
little specter I have seen,

1428
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:18,544
yet I will bear your company.

1429
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,546
Will you not speak to me?

1430
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,982
Oh.

1431
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:23,897
They can't hear or see us.

1432
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:25,464
That's, like, my thing.

1433
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:27,422
They can't?

1434
01:01:27,553 --> 01:01:29,468
There are Mexicans
in my living room.

1435
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:31,252
Actually, they're Puerto Ricans.

1436
01:01:31,383 --> 01:01:33,167
Like, not the same thing
at all, by the way.

1437
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:36,344
Your void isn't working,
it just allowed enough time

1438
01:01:36,475 --> 01:01:37,868
for a home invasion.

1439
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:40,044
No see, the void did work.

1440
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:42,263
Shadows of the future.

1441
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:43,874
This is just one
year in the future

1442
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,484
and these are the
new homeowners.

1443
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:46,877
Oh.

1444
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:48,748
Just so happened to
move in a few days ago.

1445
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:50,010
Impossible.

1446
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:51,795
They're sitting on
my favorite couch.

1447
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:56,147
I would never sell that couch to
anyone, let alone those people.

1448
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:57,539
You know, them.

1449
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,237
Right.

1450
01:01:59,367 --> 01:02:02,414
Well, in this future, with
the path you're currently on,

1451
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:05,460
they get your couch.

1452
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:07,462
I hope I hosed them for it.

1453
01:02:07,593 --> 01:02:09,551
What else happens?

1454
01:02:09,682 --> 01:02:11,466
Follow me and I'll show you.

1455
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:14,382
Can't we just walked
through a wall or something?

1456
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:15,296
No, no, no, no, no.

1457
01:02:15,427 --> 01:02:16,776
That's only Joy's thing.

1458
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:18,822
I also can't do Gary's
clap thing either.

1459
01:02:18,952 --> 01:02:20,345
All I have is the void.

1460
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:23,565
And remember, they came
hear or see you, so yeah.

1461
01:02:23,696 --> 01:02:25,132
That's pretty much it.

1462
01:02:25,263 --> 01:02:26,046
OK.

1463
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:27,439
Got it.

1464
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:29,658
You guys need to
standardize or something.

1465
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:39,407
Spirit, why do you
take me to this forsaken place?

1466
01:02:44,412 --> 01:02:45,412
What are they saying?

1467
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:46,284
I don't know.

1468
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:47,459
I don't speak Spanish.

1469
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:48,982
Oh, no.

1470
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:51,550
Spirit, no!

1471
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,464
No!

1472
01:02:52,594 --> 01:02:54,292
No!

1473
01:02:57,425 --> 01:03:01,038
You know we speak
English in America.

1474
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:01,995
Sorry.

1475
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:02,953
No, I'm sorry.

1476
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,084
Force of habit.

1477
01:03:04,215 --> 01:03:07,566
Don't walk through the bushes.

1478
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:09,481
The Christmas lighted bushes.

1479
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:15,530
What?

1480
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:18,446
They're gone too?

1481
01:03:18,577 --> 01:03:19,839
Wonder what happened to them.

1482
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,690
Well, for that, we're
probably going to have

1483
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,277
to back it up a few weeks.

1484
01:03:23,408 --> 01:03:29,022
It's still the future, just,
uh, earlier in the future.

1485
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:31,590
I'm authorized.

1486
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,547
OK.
Sure.

1487
01:03:32,678 --> 01:03:33,678
Whatever.

1488
01:03:44,385 --> 01:03:45,385
Oh.

1489
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:47,649
I could go for some chocolate.

1490
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:51,175
Hey Damon, you got
any cash on you?

1491
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:00,532
What happened?

1492
01:04:00,662 --> 01:04:02,099
Karen, you know.

1493
01:04:02,229 --> 01:04:03,840
Joy told you.

1494
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:06,581
They couldn't continue
Nia's medication.

1495
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:08,627
They tried everything.

1496
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:12,936
No one they knew had the
means to afford that stuff.

1497
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:14,676
No.

1498
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:17,114
No.

1499
01:04:17,244 --> 01:04:20,682
You're just trying to
scare me, freak me out.

1500
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:22,075
Then go check for yourself.

1501
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:23,381
They won't see you.

1502
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:24,295
Why?

1503
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:25,949
Why?

1504
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:26,863
No.

1505
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:27,733
No.

1506
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,952
No.

1507
01:04:29,082 --> 01:04:30,127
I can't do it.

1508
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:34,914
Get me out of here.

1509
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:36,045
OK.

1510
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:42,226
Don't help me up.

1511
01:04:42,356 --> 01:04:43,444
Oh, right.

1512
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:45,794
I am invisible and
can't be heard.

1513
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:47,405
But I can listen in.

1514
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:49,450
We're now about two
weeks into the future,

1515
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:51,385
so I don't want you to think
that they're talking about...

1516
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:52,236
Shh.

1517
01:04:52,366 --> 01:04:53,411
Dish the dirt, ladies.

1518
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:54,412
I don't know much
about it either.

1519
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:55,848
I only know she died.

1520
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:56,718
When did she die?

1521
01:04:56,849 --> 01:04:58,546
Yesterday, I think.

1522
01:04:58,677 --> 01:04:59,797
What was the official cause?

1523
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:00,852
Cancer.

1524
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:01,940
You know.

1525
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:03,725
No, I know leukemia.

1526
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:05,466
It's going to be a cheap funeral

1527
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:07,837
because I don't know anybody
that would want to go to it.

1528
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,470
I'm sure she's
got little friends.

1529
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,908
I'd go if I knew
they were feeding us.

1530
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,040
No, I'm kidding.

1531
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:15,731
I wouldn't want anybody
to see me there.

1532
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:17,261
I wouldn't be caught dead there.

1533
01:05:18,653 --> 01:05:20,568
That's not very nice.

1534
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:21,961
That's not very nice.

1535
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:23,223
No.

1536
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:24,354
Not nice at all.

1537
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:29,795
I mean, they're talking that way

1538
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,753
about that poor little girl.

1539
01:05:31,884 --> 01:05:32,624
Well...

1540
01:05:32,754 --> 01:05:34,365
Well, what?

1541
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:37,716
Same time, different place.

1542
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:41,894
La placenta whatever.

1543
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,766
Why are we at the
Spanish grocery store?

1544
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:46,420
Excuse me.

1545
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,161
Excuse me.

1546
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:50,772
Just to listen in on
another conversation.

1547
01:05:50,903 --> 01:05:53,601
To listen in on
another conversation?

1548
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:55,125
I'm down with that.

1549
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:58,563
OK, this is John and Val
Wilde with Bud Burns.

1550
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:00,565
I didn't know they
shopped Mexican.

1551
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:02,132
I'm sure Betty's here too.

1552
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:04,786
The Wilds are retired,
Betty's a real estate agent,

1553
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:07,311
and Bud is in sales,
whatever that means.

1554
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:10,662
This eavesdropping thing
is definitely a perk.

1555
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:13,230
No, Val, I think you
should get the good stuff.

1556
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,666
Go, John.

1557
01:06:14,796 --> 01:06:16,233
Not to worry.

1558
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:18,203
It's not like she's going
to be drinking it up.

1559
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,759
And it is a special occasion.

1560
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:22,891
True.

1561
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:24,067
What's the occasion?

1562
01:06:24,197 --> 01:06:25,285
Wait, seriously.

1563
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:25,982
This hasn't clicked
with you yet?

1564
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:26,895
Shh.

1565
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:29,115
Val, guys.

1566
01:06:29,246 --> 01:06:30,987
So I picked these.

1567
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:32,117
What do you think?

1568
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:33,424
They're beautiful.

1569
01:06:33,554 --> 01:06:34,836
Are you taking them all
to the funeral home?

1570
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,166
No.

1571
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:38,559
I thought I would save
this one for the grave.

1572
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:42,650
And the rest would look really
good on my kitchen table.

1573
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:45,349
They're going to the funeral.

1574
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:46,828
I didn't know they knew her.

1575
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:48,221
Oh, they knew her.

1576
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:50,267
But I doubt they're
going to the funeral.

1577
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:52,878
So we could just
swing by, pay our respects

1578
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,009
and celebrate at home.

1579
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:55,315
Should we go there?

1580
01:06:55,446 --> 01:06:57,187
Isn't that going to
be kind of awkward?

1581
01:06:57,317 --> 01:06:58,144
John's right.

1582
01:06:58,275 --> 01:07:01,365
We didn't really know her.

1583
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:03,410
It's the least you could do.

1584
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:05,456
And it's not like
she'll miss us?

1585
01:07:07,893 --> 01:07:10,069
She died and
they're making jokes?

1586
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,550
They're not making
jokes about her.

1587
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,855
Did you not see that?

1588
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:15,422
Did you not hear that?

1589
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:18,077
Bud and Betty and John
and Val and Mary and Kimber,

1590
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:20,601
for that matter, they
aren't talking about Nia.

1591
01:07:20,732 --> 01:07:22,995
Karen, somebody else's died.

1592
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:23,909
Really?

1593
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,172
Who?

1594
01:07:26,303 --> 01:07:27,347
You.

1595
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:43,407
OK, who put me in a tracksuit?

1596
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:44,712
Seriously?

1597
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:52,372
Yeah, well, the
tracksuit, the staff

1598
01:07:52,503 --> 01:07:57,073
here wanted to make it look like
you passed away working out.

1599
01:07:57,203 --> 01:08:03,079
When in fact, you electrocuted
yourself drinking margaritas.

1600
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:06,908
Which made the headline news
and a few late night shows.

1601
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,868
And in Florida, of
course it was Florida,

1602
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:12,871
a woman met her untimely
demise when she was, quote,

1603
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:14,916
wasted away by margaritas spill.

1604
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:21,314
Actually, you made it
out of the pool and all the way

1605
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:24,056
to the front of the house.

1606
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:26,363
Surely, somebody
saw me laying there?

1607
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:28,582
Well, they did but they thought

1608
01:08:28,713 --> 01:08:29,753
you were just cooling off.

1609
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:31,194
How refreshing.

1610
01:08:31,324 --> 01:08:32,736
Most of them had
encountered you before,

1611
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,719
so they weren't
going to question

1612
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:36,329
what the heck you were doing.

1613
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,853
Hey, what about my
little neighbor Nia?

1614
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:40,396
I mean, she's always
in her front yard

1615
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,119
selling hot chocolate
or playing hopscotch.

1616
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:44,772
I never complained
about the colored

1617
01:08:44,903 --> 01:08:48,472
chalk ruining the sidewalk
and chasing butterflies.

1618
01:08:48,602 --> 01:08:49,951
Do you not understand?

1619
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:51,823
There is no Nia.

1620
01:08:51,953 --> 01:08:53,868
She couldn't save
you because there was

1621
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:55,957
no one there to help save her.

1622
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:03,661
Break time.

1623
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:09,275
And no one's coming
to my funeral, are they?

1624
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:11,190
Why should they?

1625
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:14,454
Well, you're not going
to see the Burnses.

1626
01:09:14,585 --> 01:09:16,413
And Betty's at
your house getting

1627
01:09:16,543 --> 01:09:19,764
it ready to be sold to that
nice Puerto Rican family.

1628
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:21,331
Fully furnished.

1629
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:22,699
And then they're going to go out

1630
01:09:22,723 --> 01:09:24,899
and celebrate with the Wilds.

1631
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,946
You're not going to see
Mary or Kimber either.

1632
01:09:28,076 --> 01:09:31,776
They really didn't like you.

1633
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:33,647
So that's it?

1634
01:09:33,778 --> 01:09:37,129
I die and they're
just done with me.

1635
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,696
My life is meaningless.

1636
01:09:41,742 --> 01:09:42,917
It was meaningless.

1637
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:47,487
And now nothing, nobody.

1638
01:09:47,618 --> 01:09:48,488
Nobody.

1639
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:52,536
Well, not exactly nobody.

1640
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:55,321
These flowers came
from somebody.

1641
01:09:55,452 --> 01:09:57,497
Hello?

1642
01:09:57,628 --> 01:10:00,326
Oh, now I feel like shit.

1643
01:10:00,457 --> 01:10:02,589
I can't let them see
me in a tracksuit.

1644
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,383
Why is she doing
this to herself?

1645
01:10:13,513 --> 01:10:15,056
Why are you doing
this to yourself, honey?

1646
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:15,820
Right.

1647
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,604
What he said.

1648
01:10:17,735 --> 01:10:23,871
Nobody deserves to die young,
whether you're seven or 57.

1649
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:25,351
She meant 47.

1650
01:10:25,482 --> 01:10:28,746
She's just upset.

1651
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:31,183
You're such a sweet woman
for caring about a person who

1652
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:33,794
was very, very hard to like.

1653
01:10:33,925 --> 01:10:37,581
Believe me, I know.

1654
01:10:37,711 --> 01:10:38,711
Yeah, she was a hot mess.

1655
01:10:43,064 --> 01:10:46,938
I would know, she was my sister.

1656
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:49,767
I'm so sorry that
you heard that.

1657
01:10:49,897 --> 01:10:52,248
No, you're right.

1658
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:55,468
She was really hard to like.

1659
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:57,079
She was so mean,
Taylor Swift probably

1660
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:58,906
wrote a song about her.

1661
01:10:59,037 --> 01:11:02,170
Well, we're sorry for your loss.

1662
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:04,477
How did you know Karen?

1663
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:05,826
She was our neighbor.

1664
01:11:05,957 --> 01:11:09,134
Um, we just had our own...

1665
01:11:14,922 --> 01:11:15,922
I'm sorry.

1666
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,319
Karen's accident
happened shortly

1667
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:22,669
after our daughter passed.

1668
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,455
Oh, my God.

1669
01:11:25,585 --> 01:11:27,674
And we felt paying our respects

1670
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:32,462
to your sister on the holidays
was the best thing to do.

1671
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:36,335
Because it's what
Nia would have wanted.

1672
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:38,381
Excuse us.

1673
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:39,511
Thanks.

1674
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:47,520
It's OK.

1675
01:11:47,651 --> 01:11:50,088
I'm with Nia now.

1676
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:51,742
Well...

1677
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:53,787
Well, hell no.

1678
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:56,050
Damon, tell me is
this the future

1679
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:57,835
or just a possible future?

1680
01:12:01,882 --> 01:12:03,144
No, no, no.

1681
01:12:03,275 --> 01:12:05,321
No, Damon.

1682
01:12:05,451 --> 01:12:06,451
Listen said to me.

1683
01:12:06,496 --> 01:12:08,280
I am not the woman that I was.

1684
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:12,850
I can't be that person that
I must have been, I think.

1685
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:15,635
Why would you show me all
this if I'm a lost cause?

1686
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:16,854
Tell me.

1687
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:18,769
I can change what
you've shown me.

1688
01:12:18,899 --> 01:12:21,467
That I can alter my life.

1689
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:25,166
It's Christmas
for Christ's sake!

1690
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:26,297
Look I get it.

1691
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,431
I'll try not to be so...

1692
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:30,171
So Karenish.

1693
01:12:30,302 --> 01:12:34,001
I promise to never ask
for a manager ever again.

1694
01:12:34,132 --> 01:12:36,308
No more threatening
to sue children.

1695
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:39,442
And I won't tell people to
go back to their country.

1696
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:44,360
Please, don't
leave me like this.

1697
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,362
Don't leave me like this.

1698
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:48,102
Don't leave me like this.

1699
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:49,887
Don't leave me like this.

1700
01:12:50,017 --> 01:12:51,236
Don't leave me like this.

1701
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:58,939
Sweet White Jesus.

1702
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:00,070
Just kidding.

1703
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:04,336
Oh, Jackie.

1704
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:05,946
Thank you.

1705
01:13:06,077 --> 01:13:08,197
I'm going to live in the
past, present and the future.

1706
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:14,172
I don't know what
to do with myself.

1707
01:13:14,302 --> 01:13:16,957
I just don't know what to do.

1708
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:19,220
I feel light as a feather.

1709
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,355
I still feel great.

1710
01:13:27,446 --> 01:13:28,534
There's my wine glass.

1711
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:34,366
The ice cream is gone.

1712
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:38,109
The counters, they're so clean.

1713
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:38,979
It really happened.

1714
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:40,372
It's true.

1715
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:41,286
Oh.

1716
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,898
Joy, Gary, Damon.

1717
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:47,248
Oh, I don't know what day it is.

1718
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:49,076
How long have I been out?

1719
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:50,687
I don't know anything.

1720
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:03,787
Excuse me.

1721
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:05,005
Excuse me, young man.

1722
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,228
Could you tell me
what day is it?

1723
01:14:10,358 --> 01:14:12,448
Uh, Christmas.

1724
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:13,753
It's Christmas Day.

1725
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:16,234
The spirits did it
all in one night.

1726
01:14:16,364 --> 01:14:17,627
Yes, they have.

1727
01:14:17,757 --> 01:14:19,498
Thank you.

1728
01:14:19,629 --> 01:14:21,108
Sure thing, lady.

1729
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:23,023
Wait.

1730
01:14:23,154 --> 01:14:26,940
Did you get that
skateboard for Christmas?

1731
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:29,813
This cheap... no.

1732
01:14:29,943 --> 01:14:31,728
Would you consider selling it?

1733
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:33,033
Well...

1734
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:34,731
I have $300 in my sock drawer.

1735
01:14:34,861 --> 01:14:35,645
Deal.

1736
01:14:35,775 --> 01:14:36,602
OK.

1737
01:14:36,733 --> 01:14:37,473
Don't... don't go anywhere.

1738
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:38,386
Just wait.

1739
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:40,214
Stay.

1740
01:14:40,345 --> 01:14:41,346
Don't leave.

1741
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,477
I'll be right back.

1742
01:14:46,307 --> 01:14:49,006
I'll wrap it up and put
it on Nia's front porch.

1743
01:14:49,136 --> 01:14:50,136
Better yet.

1744
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:51,424
I'll present it to her myself.

1745
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:54,837
$100?

1746
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:55,621
There's supposed to be three.

1747
01:14:55,752 --> 01:14:56,752
Damn!

1748
01:15:09,287 --> 01:15:11,245
$300.

1749
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:13,552
One, two, three.

1750
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:14,901
$300.

1751
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:17,251
Well, thanks, lady.

1752
01:15:17,382 --> 01:15:18,382
Thank you.

1753
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:24,171
I love the Orientals.

1754
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:25,390
Asians.

1755
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,521
I mean Asians.

1756
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:43,016
I can give this to Nia tonight.

1757
01:15:43,147 --> 01:15:44,017
Tonight. tonight.

1758
01:15:44,148 --> 01:15:44,931
Hot damn, tonight.

1759
01:15:45,062 --> 01:15:46,062
No, this afternoon.

1760
01:15:46,106 --> 01:15:47,238
Yes.
Wait.

1761
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:48,368
No.

1762
01:15:48,413 --> 01:15:49,849
I have to get out of these.

1763
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,982
I have to get to the
Christmas breakfast tradition.

1764
01:15:57,509 --> 01:16:00,381
Oh, come let us find wine here.

1765
01:16:00,512 --> 01:16:03,297
Oh, come let us find wine here.

1766
01:16:03,428 --> 01:16:07,780
I'll settle for some cheap beer.

1767
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:10,740
I'm sure in this gloriously
diverse neighborhood,

1768
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:13,046
a grocery store will be open.

1769
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:17,224
I feel like a tourist.

1770
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:19,923
I feel like in alien.

1771
01:16:20,053 --> 01:16:22,403
It's making me nervous.

1772
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:25,102
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one.

1773
01:16:25,232 --> 01:16:31,412
It's like I'm a little crazy and
I don't know what else to do.

1774
01:16:31,543 --> 01:16:37,288
Well, I just got to
right back to you.

1775
01:16:41,509 --> 01:16:43,729
I feel like a tourist.

1776
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:47,037
I feel like... feel like...
Feel like a tourist.

1777
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:47,951
Tourist.

1778
01:16:48,081 --> 01:16:48,865
Tourist.

1779
01:16:48,995 --> 01:16:50,257
Tourist.

1780
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:52,172
I feel like a tourist.

1781
01:16:56,133 --> 01:16:58,396
I feel like a tourist.

1782
01:16:58,526 --> 01:17:01,225
I feel like a alien.

1783
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:03,314
It's making me nervous.

1784
01:17:03,444 --> 01:17:06,099
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one.

1785
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:12,715
It's like I'm a little crazy and
I don't know what else to do.

1786
01:17:12,845 --> 01:17:19,809
Well, I've just got to
get right back to you.

1787
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:20,723
Whoops.

1788
01:17:20,853 --> 01:17:21,680
Sorry.

1789
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:24,291
My fault. I'll buy these.

1790
01:17:24,422 --> 01:17:26,816
You can never have enough.

1791
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:29,688
Spicy Mexican
braised pork brains.

1792
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:31,821
Clean up at register four.

1793
01:17:31,951 --> 01:17:34,040
It'll go perfect with
my Christmas goulash.

1794
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:36,652
My Christmasy pot of...

1795
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:38,479
Any who.

1796
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:39,655
Do you have any coupons?

1797
01:17:39,785 --> 01:17:40,830
Nope.

1798
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,744
I'm paying full
boat for the lot.

1799
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:42,614
Yep.

1800
01:17:42,745 --> 01:17:44,529
Would you like to...

1801
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,618
I'm sorry what?

1802
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,402
No, go ahead, uh, Caroline.

1803
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:50,056
Go ahead and ask me.

1804
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:51,928
Would you like to
donate $1 to help save

1805
01:17:52,058 --> 01:17:53,625
the homeless mother's shelter?

1806
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:56,106
No, I would not like
to donate $1 to help

1807
01:17:56,236 --> 01:17:57,455
the homeless mother shelter.

1808
01:17:57,585 --> 01:18:00,458
I would like to donate $1,000.

1809
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:01,328
No.

1810
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:02,721
$5,000.

1811
01:18:02,852 --> 01:18:05,724
Just whatever you
can get out of this.

1812
01:18:05,855 --> 01:18:06,899
I'll have to call...

1813
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:07,770
Call her.

1814
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:08,684
Call her.

1815
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,033
I'll call her.

1816
01:18:10,163 --> 01:18:12,949
Assistant manager to
register, uh, four.

1817
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:16,213
And Merry Christmas
everyone, even the Muslims.

1818
01:18:16,343 --> 01:18:17,997
I see you.

1819
01:18:18,128 --> 01:18:18,868
I'm Hindu.

1820
01:18:18,998 --> 01:18:19,998
Happy day of Christ.

1821
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:25,613
Can I, uh, help
you again, ma'am?

1822
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:27,354
Yes, uh, Christina.

1823
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:28,921
Oh, like Christmas.

1824
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:30,270
Nice.

1825
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:32,229
I would like to pay
for these and donate

1826
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:35,580
$5,000 to the homeless
mother's shelter.

1827
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:39,192
And give $100 each to you and
Caroline for your trouble.

1828
01:18:39,323 --> 01:18:40,323
Can you do that?

1829
01:18:40,411 --> 01:18:41,629
Of course she could do that.

1830
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,283
She's the manager on duty.

1831
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:07,133
Well, Merry Christmas.

1832
01:19:07,264 --> 01:19:09,440
Just the two of us.

1833
01:19:13,052 --> 01:19:14,052
Or not.

1834
01:19:17,143 --> 01:19:18,143
Who is it?

1835
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:23,062
Oh, my God.
It's my sister.

1836
01:19:23,193 --> 01:19:23,976
Open up, Todd.

1837
01:19:24,107 --> 01:19:25,151
I know you're in there.

1838
01:19:25,282 --> 01:19:26,282
Brother.

1839
01:19:29,068 --> 01:19:31,854
Oh, my.

1840
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:33,812
Christmas breakfast?

1841
01:19:33,943 --> 01:19:36,902
You kept up the
family tradition.

1842
01:19:37,033 --> 01:19:38,121
Hello, Michael.

1843
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:39,731
Mimosas anyone?

1844
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:41,428
Karen, what a surprise.

1845
01:19:41,559 --> 01:19:42,995
Oh, my goodness.

1846
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:46,216
You really cleaned up the
table since last night.

1847
01:19:46,346 --> 01:19:48,174
And vodka mojitos?

1848
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:51,090
Todd, seriously?

1849
01:19:51,221 --> 01:19:53,049
Listen, Sis.

1850
01:19:53,179 --> 01:19:55,529
Why are you here?

1851
01:19:55,660 --> 01:20:01,622
Yeah, with all due
respect, you disowned Todd.

1852
01:20:01,753 --> 01:20:03,363
You didn't even show
up for our wedding.

1853
01:20:03,494 --> 01:20:04,494
Yeah.

1854
01:20:04,582 --> 01:20:05,582
That.

1855
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:16,594
Todd, when Mom and Dad
died, I really lost my way.

1856
01:20:16,724 --> 01:20:19,902
And it should have
been more like you.

1857
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:25,342
And Michael, I'm so, so sorry.

1858
01:20:25,472 --> 01:20:27,910
I've been a real a-hole.

1859
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,781
A horrible sister.

1860
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:33,785
A heinous sister-in-law.

1861
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:39,617
And you're right, an entitled,
arrogant heterosexual.

1862
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:54,066
And they're right.

1863
01:20:54,197 --> 01:20:57,940
I'm a swamp donkey.

1864
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:00,029
A nasty toad ass.

1865
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,159
Snatch canyon.

1866
01:21:01,247 --> 01:21:03,162
Bitchasaurus.

1867
01:21:03,293 --> 01:21:06,252
Vampy skuzz bucket.

1868
01:21:06,383 --> 01:21:08,951
A raging water demon.

1869
01:21:09,081 --> 01:21:12,693
The eye from "Lord
of the Rings."

1870
01:21:12,824 --> 01:21:13,956
And a elephants vajayjay.

1871
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:18,786
The Grinch.

1872
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:22,355
Harry Chewbacca.

1873
01:21:22,486 --> 01:21:23,922
You forgot sagging Skittle tits.

1874
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:29,362
OK, Twinkie.

1875
01:21:29,493 --> 01:21:30,493
Twinkie?

1876
01:21:38,241 --> 01:21:42,027
Please don't ever
disown me again.

1877
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:44,595
I promise.

1878
01:21:44,725 --> 01:21:45,725
Promise.

1879
01:21:57,608 --> 01:21:59,827
I understand now.

1880
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,264
I do.

1881
01:22:01,394 --> 01:22:02,961
I do.

1882
01:22:03,092 --> 01:22:09,707
I understand what ignorance
and want can do to me.

1883
01:22:09,837 --> 01:22:12,928
I'm so, so sorry.

1884
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:14,277
Mimosas, everyone.

1885
01:22:14,407 --> 01:22:15,191
Cheers.

1886
01:22:15,321 --> 01:22:16,192
Cheers.

1887
01:22:16,322 --> 01:22:17,584
Cheers.

1888
01:22:17,715 --> 01:22:19,717
New Year's dinner at my house.

1889
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:21,458
- Great.
- Let's do it.

1890
01:22:21,588 --> 01:22:23,044
I can't wait for you
to meet the neighbors.

1891
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,591
They have an adorable
daughter, Nia.

1892
01:22:24,722 --> 01:22:29,248
She's very ill, but she's
just such a cute little doll.

1893
01:22:32,295 --> 01:22:33,470
I know just what to do.

1894
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,170
Mr. Scrooge.

1895
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:40,477
Yes, that is my name.

1896
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:42,783
I fear it may not
be pleasant to you.

1897
01:22:42,914 --> 01:22:46,874
If you will, do me
the goodness of...

1898
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:48,441
Hold the line, men.

1899
01:22:48,572 --> 01:22:50,356
We should you fall back, Sarge.

1900
01:22:50,487 --> 01:22:51,879
Doggonit, soldier.

1901
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:54,534
We must protect the castle
painting at all cost.

1902
01:22:54,665 --> 01:22:56,536
Look out for the giant robot.

1903
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:58,756
Ah.

1904
01:22:58,886 --> 01:23:00,192
Sorry about that, humans.

1905
01:23:00,323 --> 01:23:01,541
We come in peace.

1906
01:23:01,672 --> 01:23:03,630
We didn't mean to
squish you to pieces.

1907
01:23:03,761 --> 01:23:05,545
No, we're OK, robot thing.

1908
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:07,591
Join us for brunch.

1909
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:08,853
There's something wrong.

1910
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,309
There's something
definitely wrong.

1911
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:11,333
What's the matter, Chris?

1912
01:23:17,644 --> 01:23:18,515
Look at this.

1913
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:20,256
This doesn't make any sense.

1914
01:23:20,386 --> 01:23:21,170
What?

1915
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,693
Oh, my God.

1916
01:23:22,823 --> 01:23:24,453
The shelter got a $5,000
donation this morning.

1917
01:23:24,477 --> 01:23:25,609
Anonymously.

1918
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,915
Honey, we've got
a guardian angel.

1919
01:23:28,046 --> 01:23:30,005
I was just about to sign
the foreclosure papers.

1920
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:31,789
If it wasn't Christmas
Day, I would...

1921
01:23:31,919 --> 01:23:33,225
Baby, listen to me.

1922
01:23:33,356 --> 01:23:35,184
These things happen
for a reason.

1923
01:23:35,314 --> 01:23:37,510
You get to reopen tomorrow and
help those homeless mothers

1924
01:23:37,534 --> 01:23:38,361
when they need you most.

1925
01:23:38,491 --> 01:23:39,840
More donations will follow.

1926
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:41,277
I know they will.

1927
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:43,540
Then you'll be
helping those families

1928
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:46,630
while providing for yours.

1929
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,680
Even if I could pocket
every penny of that money,

1930
01:23:48,806 --> 01:23:51,132
I still wouldn't be a tenth of
what we need for our baby girl.

1931
01:23:51,156 --> 01:23:54,768
Chris, please,
don't talk like that.

1932
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:56,248
You would never do such a thing.

1933
01:23:58,903 --> 01:24:00,774
I stole those presents, Robin.

1934
01:24:00,905 --> 01:24:01,949
No, love.

1935
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,908
You borrowed them.

1936
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,431
We will replace them.

1937
01:24:05,562 --> 01:24:06,650
Don't do this to yourself.

1938
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:07,868
God blessed us.

1939
01:24:11,263 --> 01:24:13,143
God also blessed us with
a baby girl that needs.

1940
01:24:15,746 --> 01:24:18,227
Have faith, my love.

1941
01:24:18,357 --> 01:24:21,534
The Lord works in
mysterious ways.

1942
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:22,448
Hey.

1943
01:24:22,579 --> 01:24:23,754
It's me, your neighbor.

1944
01:24:23,884 --> 01:24:25,582
Can we get a little
help out here?

1945
01:24:25,712 --> 01:24:26,712
Come see.

1946
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,800
What is she...

1947
01:24:30,935 --> 01:24:31,718
Hey.

1948
01:24:31,849 --> 01:24:33,024
Hey.

1949
01:24:33,155 --> 01:24:34,393
Just a couple of
boxes on the lawn.

1950
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:35,548
OK?

1951
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,422
Ooh, Small Hey, little Dick.

1952
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,597
Dickens.

1953
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:42,033
Oh, right.

1954
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:44,079
Little Dickens.

1955
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,471
Got something for you.

1956
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,914
Here you go.

1957
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:56,308
Fresh from the market.

1958
01:24:56,439 --> 01:24:58,005
Oh, you can put
that right there.

1959
01:24:58,136 --> 01:24:59,181
Right there.

1960
01:24:59,311 --> 01:25:00,791
And go ahead and
get the next box.

1961
01:25:00,921 --> 01:25:02,706
Chop, chop.

1962
01:25:02,836 --> 01:25:04,142
Merry Christmas, Nia.

1963
01:25:04,273 --> 01:25:05,709
I brought you these boxes of...

1964
01:25:05,839 --> 01:25:07,624
I guess you could
call them toys.

1965
01:25:07,754 --> 01:25:10,496
But they're not fun toys,
like your green army man

1966
01:25:10,627 --> 01:25:12,977
or whatever that is.

1967
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,848
These are collectibles.

1968
01:25:14,979 --> 01:25:16,241
Yeah.

1969
01:25:16,372 --> 01:25:17,416
Right there.

1970
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:18,867
Right there next
to the other box.

1971
01:25:18,896 --> 01:25:20,724
And get the box with
the blue tape on it.

1972
01:25:20,854 --> 01:25:22,682
It shouldn't be in the sun long.

1973
01:25:22,813 --> 01:25:25,511
This box is filled
with Teddy bears.

1974
01:25:25,642 --> 01:25:27,513
But not just any Teddy bears.

1975
01:25:40,047 --> 01:25:42,963
These are Steiff bears.

1976
01:25:43,094 --> 01:25:45,531
My mom used to collect
them like a mad woman.

1977
01:25:45,662 --> 01:25:47,466
And then when she passed
away and Todd, my brother,

1978
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:49,163
he didn't want have
anything to do with them.

1979
01:25:49,187 --> 01:25:52,147
But I think they're cute, so
I just kept collecting them.

1980
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:53,365
Hi, Nia.

1981
01:25:53,496 --> 01:25:54,584
My name is Harry.

1982
01:25:54,714 --> 01:25:55,889
He's Mo hair.

1983
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,108
Hello, Harry.

1984
01:25:57,239 --> 01:25:58,762
I have a button in my ear.

1985
01:25:58,892 --> 01:26:03,549
Now this guy is about
worth $300 or so.

1986
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,900
But this guy...
This 1909 classic,

1987
01:26:07,031 --> 01:26:11,862
you're going to get about
$1,700, make you holler!

1988
01:26:11,992 --> 01:26:12,776
I'm sorry.

1989
01:26:12,906 --> 01:26:14,473
Sorry.

1990
01:26:14,604 --> 01:26:17,346
Keep them coming, Chris.

1991
01:26:17,476 --> 01:26:18,260
Oh...

1992
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:19,783
I don't understand.

1993
01:26:19,913 --> 01:26:21,611
Oh, well, a friend
of a friend of mine

1994
01:26:21,741 --> 01:26:23,458
told me that you're really
good at selling stuff

1995
01:26:23,482 --> 01:26:25,963
on Etsy and eBay or whatever.

1996
01:26:26,093 --> 01:26:27,356
Mom's great at it.

1997
01:26:27,486 --> 01:26:29,706
She sold all of our stuff.

1998
01:26:29,836 --> 01:26:31,011
Perfect.

1999
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:32,622
That's what I want
your mom to do.

2000
01:26:32,752 --> 01:26:35,102
Sell my stuff.

2001
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:36,930
These are all Teddy Bears?

2002
01:26:37,061 --> 01:26:37,801
No.

2003
01:26:37,931 --> 01:26:38,932
There's Hummels.

2004
01:26:39,063 --> 01:26:40,238
There's Cabbage Patch Kids.

2005
01:26:40,369 --> 01:26:41,631
And there's Beanie Babies.

2006
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:45,591
And all together, you're
going to get a lot.

2007
01:26:45,722 --> 01:26:47,593
Always keep the
box they come in.

2008
01:26:47,724 --> 01:26:51,554
MIB, Mint in Box, I learned
that lesson late in life.

2009
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:56,211
So you want me to sell your
things and charge you a fee?

2010
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:57,081
Yeah?

2011
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,474
No.

2012
01:26:58,604 --> 01:27:00,476
I don't want you to
charge anything that...

2013
01:27:00,606 --> 01:27:02,608
God, I suck at this.

2014
01:27:02,739 --> 01:27:08,005
OK, what I mean is, I
want you to sell the stuff

2015
01:27:08,135 --> 01:27:09,135
and keep the money.

2016
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:10,747
Get Nia well.

2017
01:27:10,877 --> 01:27:15,882
I don't need the money and I
can just write it off as a loss.

2018
01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:17,512
Ma'am, this... all
this is so nice of you,

2019
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:20,147
but we will get through this.

2020
01:27:20,278 --> 01:27:21,801
In fact, we were
so blessed today

2021
01:27:21,932 --> 01:27:25,718
we got an anonymous donation
for the shelter I manage.

2022
01:27:25,849 --> 01:27:28,852
You know, it should
be enough to cover...

2023
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:33,030
No.

2024
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,727
No.

2025
01:27:34,858 --> 01:27:36,033
Oh, my God. No.

2026
01:27:36,163 --> 01:27:37,403
We cam... we cannot accept this.

2027
01:27:37,513 --> 01:27:38,296
It's... it's too much.

2028
01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:39,166
I'm sorry.

2029
01:27:39,297 --> 01:27:40,429
It's... it's too much.

2030
01:27:40,559 --> 01:27:41,959
Nia, love, we will
get through this.

2031
01:27:41,995 --> 01:27:42,866
OK, babe?

2032
01:27:42,996 --> 01:27:44,433
We will get through this.

2033
01:27:44,563 --> 01:27:46,043
I promise.

2034
01:27:46,173 --> 01:27:51,135
But Mommy, you said this
was from a guardian angel.

2035
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:54,878
Baby girl, Mommy and I
will think of something.

2036
01:27:55,008 --> 01:27:56,227
We will think of something.

2037
01:27:56,358 --> 01:27:57,663
Excuse me.

2038
01:27:57,794 --> 01:27:59,491
Excuse me.

2039
01:27:59,622 --> 01:28:04,714
Did you just blow off a lifelong
arrogant, self-absorbed Karen?

2040
01:28:04,844 --> 01:28:07,369
Do you want me to go
full Karen on you?

2041
01:28:07,499 --> 01:28:10,067
I didn't think so.

2042
01:28:10,197 --> 01:28:13,331
Look, it's not about the money.

2043
01:28:13,462 --> 01:28:16,682
Last night, a few
new friends of mine

2044
01:28:16,813 --> 01:28:18,815
had an attitude
intervention with me.

2045
01:28:18,945 --> 01:28:21,992
And I saw myself.

2046
01:28:22,122 --> 01:28:23,646
Elephants for vajayjay.

2047
01:28:23,776 --> 01:28:25,865
That was not pretty.

2048
01:28:25,996 --> 01:28:30,087
I need your help
to be a better me.

2049
01:28:30,217 --> 01:28:33,438
Karen, we really
appreciate your kindness.

2050
01:28:33,569 --> 01:28:37,137
And you seem to be one of
those women who go all in when

2051
01:28:37,268 --> 01:28:38,791
she's got her mind made up.

2052
01:28:38,922 --> 01:28:39,705
Yeah.

2053
01:28:39,836 --> 01:28:41,228
Maybe.

2054
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:43,492
You got me.

2055
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:45,015
So I'll tell you what.

2056
01:28:45,145 --> 01:28:47,974
I'll help you sell your
things and charge you 10%.

2057
01:28:48,105 --> 01:28:48,888
- 90.
- 20.

2058
01:28:49,019 --> 01:28:50,368
- 80.
- 40.

2059
01:28:50,499 --> 01:28:51,369
60.

2060
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,805
50.

2061
01:28:52,936 --> 01:28:55,242
And you have to join
us for dinner tonight.

2062
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:57,680
Deal.

2063
01:28:57,810 --> 01:28:59,290
Oh, I forgot.

2064
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:01,466
I got Nia a Christmas present.

2065
01:29:01,597 --> 01:29:03,555
I think I left it
right out here.

2066
01:29:03,686 --> 01:29:04,513
Don't worry.

2067
01:29:04,643 --> 01:29:05,775
It wasn't very expensive.

2068
01:29:05,905 --> 01:29:07,603
Only $300 bucks.

2069
01:29:07,733 --> 01:29:09,256
I think it's right here.

2070
01:29:17,613 --> 01:29:18,962
Are you OK?

2071
01:29:19,092 --> 01:29:20,659
Yeah.

2072
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:23,488
At least I didn't
get electrocuted.

2073
01:29:23,619 --> 01:29:24,619
What?

2074
01:29:24,707 --> 01:29:25,707
Any who.

2075
01:29:25,751 --> 01:29:27,405
I heard Nia wanted a skateboard.

2076
01:29:27,536 --> 01:29:29,340
I think I heard it from
Santa Claus or something.

2077
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:34,630
So I searched high and low,
and I found her this bad boy.

2078
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:35,760
Wow.

2079
01:29:39,722 --> 01:29:41,114
Merry Christmas, Karen.

2080
01:29:41,245 --> 01:29:44,291
Merry Christmas, Ms. Karen.

2081
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:47,164
Thanks guys.

2082
01:29:47,294 --> 01:29:49,558
Merry Christmas.

2083
01:29:49,688 --> 01:29:50,776
God bless you, Karen.

2084
01:30:02,788 --> 01:30:04,834
God bless us, everyone.

2085
01:30:20,676 --> 01:30:23,069
Are you ready for Christmas?

2086
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,072
Are you decking the halls?

2087
01:30:26,203 --> 01:30:28,510
Are you ready for Christmas?

2088
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,513
You'll be having a ball.

2089
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:34,516
Are you ready for Christmas.

2090
01:30:34,646 --> 01:30:37,475
Are you having some fun?

2091
01:30:37,606 --> 01:30:39,999
Are you ready for Christmas?

2092
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:41,958
It's only just begun.

2093
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:42,959
Oh.

2094
01:30:43,089 --> 01:30:44,482
Oh.

2095
01:30:44,613 --> 01:30:49,966
Are counting down the
days till the holidays?

2096
01:30:50,096 --> 01:30:52,925
Sleigh bells sing
ring-a-ding ding ding.

2097
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:55,928
Are you ready to celebrate?

2098
01:30:56,059 --> 01:31:01,673
Everyone is coming home
to the merry cheer.

2099
01:31:01,804 --> 01:31:03,109
Lights are on.

2100
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,068
Can you see them shine?

2101
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:06,983
It's a party now everywhere.

2102
01:31:07,113 --> 01:31:09,289
Are you ready for Christmas?

2103
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:12,292
Are you decking the halls?

2104
01:31:12,423 --> 01:31:15,295
Are you ready for Christmas?

2105
01:31:15,426 --> 01:31:18,255
You'll be having a ball.

2106
01:31:18,385 --> 01:31:21,258
Are you ready for Christmas?

2107
01:31:21,388 --> 01:31:24,261
Are you having some fun?

2108
01:31:24,391 --> 01:31:27,264
Are you ready for Christmas?

2109
01:31:27,394 --> 01:31:28,394
It's only just begun.

2110
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:29,266
Oh.

2111
01:31:29,396 --> 01:31:30,136
Oh.

2112
01:31:30,267 --> 01:31:31,790
It's only just begun.

2113
01:31:31,921 --> 01:31:34,140
What up, care bear?

2114
01:31:34,271 --> 01:31:35,838
That's the wrong line.

2115
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:48,372
Ah!

2116
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,547
Sorry.

2117
01:31:49,678 --> 01:31:51,331
A bug flew in my ear.

2118
01:31:55,727 --> 01:32:00,384
I go dancing around
the clock to that jolly bop.

2119
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,299
Voices sing Merry Christmas.

2120
01:32:02,429 --> 01:32:04,344
Bring me another one.

2121
01:32:04,475 --> 01:32:05,345
I don't want to stop.

2122
01:32:05,476 --> 01:32:08,218
Are you ready for Christmas?

2123
01:32:08,348 --> 01:32:11,134
Are you decking the halls?

2124
01:32:11,264 --> 01:32:14,050
Are you ready for Christmas?

2125
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:17,227
You'll be having a ball.

2126
01:32:17,357 --> 01:32:19,708
Are you ready for Christmas?

2127
01:32:19,838 --> 01:32:22,624
Are you having some fun?

2128
01:32:22,754 --> 01:32:25,583
Are you ready for Christmas?

2129
01:32:25,714 --> 01:32:27,106
It's only just begun.

2130
01:32:27,237 --> 01:32:27,977
Oh.

2131
01:32:28,107 --> 01:32:28,934
Oh.

2132
01:32:29,065 --> 01:32:30,066
It's only just begun.

2133
01:32:34,505 --> 01:32:35,505
Yeah.

2134
01:32:37,073 --> 01:32:39,249
Doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

2135
01:32:52,784 --> 01:32:54,830
Snow's falling down.

2136
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,051
The fires blazing bright.

2137
01:32:59,182 --> 01:33:00,923
I might be dreaming.

2138
01:33:01,053 --> 01:33:04,535
There's an angel in my sight.

2139
01:33:04,666 --> 01:33:07,451
Thanks for the present
underneath the tree,

2140
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,759
but there's something
that you missed?

2141
01:33:10,889 --> 01:33:17,069
Santa, this girl's the only
thing that's on my list.

2142
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,463
That's my Christmas wish.

2143
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:22,945
Doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,

2144
01:33:23,075 --> 01:33:25,425
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

2145
01:33:25,556 --> 01:33:27,036
I've been good on year.

2146
01:33:27,166 --> 01:33:29,516
I promise I'll believe again,
Santa, it if you make it

2147
01:33:29,647 --> 01:33:31,954
come true.

2148
01:33:32,084 --> 01:33:33,216
Give a guy gift.

2149
01:33:33,346 --> 01:33:35,087
If you can make some
magic then I got

2150
01:33:35,218 --> 01:33:37,002
some milk and cookies for you.

2151
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:40,527
If you want to grant me
this wish, that I promise

2152
01:33:40,658 --> 01:33:42,486
I won't forget.

2153
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:46,882
Watch and see, I'll be at the
top of your list every year

2154
01:33:47,012 --> 01:33:49,145
after this request...

2155
01:33:49,275 --> 01:33:50,015
Whoa.

2156
01:33:50,146 --> 01:33:51,146
Whoa.

2157
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:55,151
Whoa... if you make her mine.

2158
01:33:55,281 --> 01:33:56,761
Snow's falling down.

2159
01:33:56,892 --> 01:34:01,287
The fire's blazing bright.

2160
01:34:01,418 --> 01:34:03,246
I might be dreaming.

2161
01:34:03,376 --> 01:34:06,597
There's an angel in my sight.

2162
01:34:06,728 --> 01:34:09,948
Thanks for the presents
underneath the tree,

2163
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:13,430
but there's something
that you missed.

2164
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:19,218
Santa, this girl's the only
thing that's on my list.

2165
01:34:19,349 --> 01:34:20,959
That's my Christmas...

2166
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:25,877
A woman met her untimely
demise when she was, quote...

2167
01:34:26,008 --> 01:34:26,791
I lost it.

2168
01:34:26,922 --> 01:34:28,358
I'm sorry.

2169
01:34:28,488 --> 01:34:29,944
Look, when I found out this
woman was from Florida,

2170
01:34:29,968 --> 01:34:30,708
I was shocked.

2171
01:34:30,839 --> 01:34:31,970
I was just shocked.

2172
01:34:32,101 --> 01:34:33,755
I mean, not a
shocked that she was.

2173
01:34:33,885 --> 01:34:36,125
The only way that this death
could have been more Florida

2174
01:34:36,192 --> 01:34:38,237
is if she had then
been eaten by a Gator

2175
01:34:38,368 --> 01:34:40,326
who voted for Ron DeSantis.

2176
01:34:40,457 --> 01:34:44,243
She's like a Florida version
of a James Bond cocktail,

2177
01:34:44,374 --> 01:34:46,637
shaken not stirred.

2178
01:34:47,812 --> 01:34:49,945
Snow is falling down.

2179
01:34:50,075 --> 01:34:52,861
The fire's blazing bright.

2180
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:56,299
Thanks for the presents
underneath the tree,

2181
01:34:56,429 --> 01:34:59,258
but there's something
that you missed.

2182
01:34:59,389 --> 01:35:04,611
Santa, this girl's the only
thing that's on my list.

2183
01:35:04,742 --> 01:35:07,658
That's my Christmas wish.

2184
01:35:10,661 --> 01:35:14,273
Now I'm going to show you
what your neighborhood's up to.

2185
01:35:14,404 --> 01:35:15,144
Oh, damn it.

2186
01:35:15,274 --> 01:35:16,274
Sorry.

2187
01:35:18,538 --> 01:35:19,538
Hi, can I help you?

2188
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:21,063
I wish to speak the manager.

2189
01:35:21,193 --> 01:35:22,455
Oh, my God.

2190
01:35:22,586 --> 01:35:23,868
Why can't I get the
line out of my mouth?

2191
01:35:23,892 --> 01:35:25,763
OK.

2192
01:35:25,894 --> 01:35:26,894
I wish to speak manager.

2193
01:35:28,244 --> 01:35:30,681
I feel a tourist.

2194
01:35:30,812 --> 01:35:33,510
I feel like an alien.

2195
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,904
It's making me nervous.

2196
01:35:36,034 --> 01:35:38,689
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one.

2197
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:41,518
I'm like I'm going
a little crazy

2198
01:35:41,648 --> 01:35:44,913
and I don't know
what else to do.

2199
01:35:45,043 --> 01:35:50,962
Well, I just got to
get right back to you.

2200
01:36:00,885 --> 01:36:02,887
Sometimes when awake, it's
like the same old shit,

2201
01:36:03,018 --> 01:36:04,018
a different day.

2202
01:36:04,062 --> 01:36:04,933
I try to turn my self around.

2203
01:36:05,063 --> 01:36:06,499
Sometimes the feelings go away.

2204
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:09,067
I feel I'm underwater,
can't my feet on the ground.

2205
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:12,070
World is spinning so fast
like it's got me upside down.

2206
01:36:16,509 --> 01:36:18,729
I feel like a tourist.

2207
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:21,166
I feel like... feel like...

2208
01:36:21,297 --> 01:36:22,646
I feel like a tourist. Tourist.

2209
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:23,516
Tourist.

2210
01:36:23,647 --> 01:36:24,691
Tourist.

2211
01:36:24,822 --> 01:36:26,650
I... I... I... I feel
like a tourist.

2212
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:27,520
Tourist.

2213
01:36:27,651 --> 01:36:29,566
Tourist.

2214
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:34,919
I feel like a tourist.

2215
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:37,661
Whoa.

2216
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:40,142
I feel like a tourist.

2217
01:36:40,272 --> 01:36:42,535
I feel like an alien.

2218
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:45,277
It's making me nervous.

2219
01:36:45,408 --> 01:36:48,019
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one.

2220
01:36:48,150 --> 01:36:50,848
It's like I'm going
a little crazy

2221
01:36:50,979 --> 01:36:53,895
and I don't know
what else to do.

2222
01:36:54,025 --> 01:36:59,901
Well, I just got to
get right back to you.

2223
01:37:00,031 --> 01:37:01,095
I always try to find the good.

2224
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:02,512
Sometimes it's just hard to do.

2225
01:37:02,642 --> 01:37:04,272
Hate is hanging in the
air, makes you feel

2226
01:37:04,296 --> 01:37:05,645
like it could hate too.

2227
01:37:05,776 --> 01:37:07,734
Getting angry isn't
someone who I want to be.

2228
01:37:07,865 --> 01:37:10,172
Got to keep my head up
or I'll never ever see.

2229
01:37:10,302 --> 01:37:11,302
Whoa.

2230
01:37:14,916 --> 01:37:16,439
I feel like a tourist.

2231
01:37:16,569 --> 01:37:17,569
Tourist.

2232
01:37:17,614 --> 01:37:20,008
I feel like and alien.

2233
01:37:20,138 --> 01:37:22,619
It's making me nervous.

2234
01:37:22,749 --> 01:37:25,404
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one.

2235
01:37:25,535 --> 01:37:31,628
It's like I'm a little crazy and
I don't know what else to do.

2236
01:37:31,758 --> 01:37:38,722
Well, I've just got to
get right back to you.
