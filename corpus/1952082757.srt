1
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,236
CREwMAN:
Captain.

2
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,864
-Captain.
-Ridley.

3
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,033
Ridley, have you seen
any other survivors?

4
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,243
No, sir.

5
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,873
Captain, my foot is caught
in some of the wreckage.

6
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,459
-It's pulling me under.
-Hold on.

7
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,630
Ridley!

8
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,186
Ridley. Ridley.

9
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,104
No.

10
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,772
No.

11
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,400
PIRATES:
More blood, more blood, more blood.

12
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,069
CAPTAIN:
Delirious from nearly drowning, I saw it.

13
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,656
The Black Freighter.

14
00:01:54,948 --> 00:02:00,245
The hell-bound ship's black
sails against the yellow Indies sky.

15
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:06,752
I knew again the stench of powder
and men's brains and war.

16
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,632
PIRATES:
More blood, more blood, more blood.

17
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:21,808
PIRATES:
More blood, more blood, more blood.

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,733
CAPTAIN:
The waves about me were scarlet...

19
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,861
...foaming, horribly warm
in the Freighter's wake.

20
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,240
In despair, I offered my weathered soul
to almighty God...

21
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,077
...his mercy and his judgment.

22
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:29,126
When I awoke,
I found myself upon a dismal beachhead...

23
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,627
...with my men.

24
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,173
Pieces of my men.

25
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,390
It was all I could do for her...

26
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,935
...though she had borne me
through seas of blood.

27
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:51,440
Her damp embrace had prevented me
from drifting beyond reach.

28
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:56,486
Yet this small comfort
was all I could offer.

29
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,457
One of my crew lay ahead.

30
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,585
Birds were eating
his thoughts and memories.

31
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,045
Away. Hya!

32
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,796
Hya! Get away.

33
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,427
In hell, at least the gulls are contented.

34
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:26,099
For my part,
I begged that they should take my eyes.

35
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,394
Thus sparing me future horrors.

36
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:33,607
I thought of my family...

37
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,818
...my wife, my daughters.

38
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,946
Vulnerable, unsuspecting.

39
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,075
Awaiting my return,
only to be met by damnation...

40
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,702
...bearing down upon them.

41
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,293
Hey!

42
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,920
Over here!

43
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,047
Here!

44
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,263
Ridley.

45
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:21,905
A sail.

46
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,867
Ridley had brought me a sail.

47
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,328
Perhaps this could be my route
back to Davidstown.

48
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,917
Everything I loved, everything I lived for,
depended on my reaching home...

49
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,421
...in advance of that terrible Freighter.

50
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,474
The morning sun found me
no less troubled.

51
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,311
Further down the shore...

52
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,981
...some of my crew
had become inflated with gas.

53
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:07,034
I shuddered at my own idea,
attempting to banish this repulsive notion.

54
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:18,754
Even in death,
they sought to fulfill their duty...

55
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,507
...making our vessel more buoyant.

56
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,052
And I would do my duty to them
in returning them home.

57
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,017
Rudely jarring my men from eternal rest,
and laying them in the bed I prepared...

58
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:36,647
...I hoped my wife and daughters
might be tucked in by gentler hands...

59
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,524
...when their turn came.

60
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,252
We shall get home together, my friend.

61
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,631
I waited for the tide.

62
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,469
Then, embarking, headed east.

63
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,639
East, across the night seas.

64
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:15,269
East, borne on the bodies
of murdered men.

65
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,730
Hope can be a horrible thing.

66
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:27,799
With the dawn came the gulls
looking for breakfast.

67
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,092
Ridley.

68
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,305
Get out.

69
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,814
I was reminded
that I, myself, had not eaten.

70
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,862
I know it is unappetizing,
but it is all we have.

71
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:08,757
Whoever we are, wherever we reside,
we exist on the whim of murderers.

72
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,390
I hardly recognized my old friend Ridley.

73
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,685
I could not bring myself to tell him
he was a horrible reflection...

74
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,770
...of his former self.

75
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,608
I really must get him home before....
Before he gets any worse.

76
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,902
Before he succumbs.

77
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:34,867
I've heard that on less than a pint daily,
a man might survive drinking saltwater.

78
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,410
RIDLEY:
Captain?

79
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,036
What are you doing, captain?

80
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,417
l'm headed for Davidstown. That's what.

81
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,420
I need to warn everyone.

82
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,551
You think you'll reach Davidstown
in advance of the Black Freighter?

83
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:57,139
lsolation has made you mad, captain.
Mad, indeed.

84
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,433
But we must try.

85
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,809
You are a fool.

86
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,520
You alone survived the Freighter's attack.

87
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,900
Fortune has smiled upon you,
and you spit in its face.

88
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:13,447
Turn your wretched craft around
and go far away, as far away as you can.

89
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,494
No. No, my family. I must protect them.

90
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,539
The Black Freighter is already there.

91
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,917
Your wife, dead.

92
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,711
-Your children, dead.
-Shut your mouth.

93
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,257
You have failed your family,
like you have failed your crew.

94
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:57,032
You'll end up dead like them.
You give your life in vain.

95
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,825
I give my life in nobility.

96
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,749
Even if I fail in my attempt,
I take solace in the fact that I will see...

97
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,251
...my family again in heaven.

98
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,585
RlDLEY:
Heaven?

99
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,838
Oh, there is no heaven, captain.

100
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,465
Believe me, sir.

101
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,801
I would know by now.

102
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,871
Huh?

103
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,001
Know this, my friends.

104
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,211
Hades is wet.

105
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,131
Hades is lonely.

106
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,775
And in that instant, we knew each other.

107
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,397
l'm sorry, my friend.

108
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,546
My raft had grown
increasingly grotesque...

109
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,174
...reflecting my own transformation.

110
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,859
Adrift, my darkest imaginings
welled up unchecked...

111
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,112
...spilling from brain to heart
like black ink...

112
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,739
...impossible to remove.

113
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:54,543
The vessel had surely reached
Davidstown already.

114
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:59,840
I pictured quiet streets overrun
by the fiends from the Black Freighter.

115
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,218
My wife, my children,
most certainly dead.

116
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,387
My crew, dead.

117
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:09,224
The beast I ride on, dead.

118
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,111
PlRATES:
More blood, more blood, more blood.

119
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,752
GIRL:
Father?

120
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,379
lt can't be. Oh, Lord, it can't be.

121
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,799
Father, help us. Please.

122
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,009
CAPTAIN:
Wait.

123
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,720
l'm coming.

124
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,847
Hurry, my dear.

125
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,518
Wait. Anyone but them.

126
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,311
Anyone.

127
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,104
Anyone.

128
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,653
I'd swallowed too much seawater.

129
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,656
I'd swallowed too much horror.

130
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,410
God has damned me.

131
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:14,164
God has damned us all.

132
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:20,295
Truly, life is hell and death's rough hand
our only deliverance.

133
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,131
I can endure no more.

134
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,219
I want to join my family desperately.

135
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,618
Why does death pass me by?

136
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,373
Davidstown?

137
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,334
Davidstown.

138
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,045
I was only miles away.

139
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,964
By now the town was overrun.

140
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,509
The fiends imagined themselves safe
from me.

141
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,094
But now I was home.

142
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,014
And revenge would be mine.

143
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,024
No, not the brigands
from the Black Freighter.

144
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:25,319
The man I recognized,
a moneylender from Davidstown.

145
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,821
With Davidstown certainly captured...

146
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,116
...why would this scoundrel
and his wench be allowed free passage...

147
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,576
...for this midnight tryst?

148
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,952
Had he collaborated?

149
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,579
Had he betrayed my people?

150
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,749
-My family?
WOMAN: Come and get it, babe.

151
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,417
Here.

152
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,678
CAPTAIN:
My heart grew cold.

153
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,015
Was my wife comforted
before her execution...

154
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,228
...while this collaborator
and his pirate masters sneered?

155
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,022
My decision was hurried,
but not difficult.

156
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,398
MONEYLENDER:
Who are you? what?

157
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,738
CAPTAIN: His head burst,
as if pressurized by the guilt within.

158
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:21,792
A buccaneer's whore deserves no pity.

159
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,131
Two figures had ridden here.

160
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,134
Two must ride back.

161
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,683
A pirate sentry.

162
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,937
I trotted unhurriedly to avoid suspicion.

163
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,983
Their violation did not stop
with the good people of Davidstown...

164
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:50,362
...but had cut deeply,
infecting my beloved homeland.

165
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:53,782
My Davidstown was not as I last saw it.

166
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:57,911
Already it was afflicted
with the curse of the Black Freighter.

167
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:04,418
Soon, I would venture amongst evil men,
butchers who now reside in my home...

168
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,295
...and make them fear me.

169
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,760
Upon my return home,
I found the streets conspicuously silent.

170
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,557
I entered my former residence
noiselessly.

171
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:25,063
Careful not to rouse the pirate butchers
occupying it from their debauched slumber.

172
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,905
Unaware that death was amongst them...

173
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,201
...they would know its dark embrace
without ever understanding why.

174
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,580
One, however, was awake. Frantic.

175
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,123
Lest he should raise alarms...

176
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:47,085
...I set upon him as he entered
the night-wrapped chamber.

177
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,796
No pirates come, but something worse.

178
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:52,508
Father?

179
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:57,346
CAPTAIN: I look up into faces familiar,
save for their terror.

180
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:00,974
Through puffed and bloodied lips,
she mouthed my name.

181
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,436
My love, why?

182
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,860
CAPTAIN:
There came an understanding so large...

183
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,446
...it left no room for sanity.

184
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,907
So I ran.

185
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,326
MAN:
What's happened to her?

186
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,620
You.

187
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,415
CAPTAIN: The knowledge
of my damnation paced me...

188
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,752
...shouting, celebrating its awful victory.

189
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,629
My deduction was flawless.

190
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,923
The Black Freighter
was heading to Davidstown.

191
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,968
-It should have arrived.
MAN: He went that way!

192
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,348
CAPTAIN: Eventually,
I came to a dismal black ocean...

193
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,475
...stretching endlessly before me.

194
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,604
How had I reached
this appalling position with love...

195
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,816
...only love, as my guide?

196
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,529
The moneylender floated at my feet.

197
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:58,490
Noble intentions had led me to atrocity.

198
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:04,830
The righteous anger fueling my ingenious,
awful scheme was but delusion.

199
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,999
Where was my error?

200
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:12,462
Planning to resume my flight,
I raised my head and saw her.

201
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:19,219
The vessel seemed to be waiting,
not hovering to strike.

202
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,515
And gradually, I understood
what innocent intent brought me to...

203
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,144
...and waded out beyond my depth.

204
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,315
The unspeakable truth
loomed unavoidably before me...

205
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,401
...as I swam
towards the anchored Freighter.

206
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:38,864
Its dark and lurching mast
filled all my vision.

207
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:42,034
All my well-meaning plans
had come to this.

208
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:45,954
The world I tried to save
was lost beyond recall.

209
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,665
A rope snaked down.

210
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,001
Sputtering, I grabbed it.

211
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,046
And from the decks above,
a cheer went up...

212
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:58,383
...both gross and black,
its stench affronting heaven.

213
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,555
There had been no plan
to capture Davidstown.

214
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:08,435
They'd come to wait until they could collect
the only prize they valued.

215
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:12,773
Claim the only soul they truly wanted.

216
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,864
I was a horror.

217
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,077
Amongst horrors must I dwell.
