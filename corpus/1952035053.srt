1
00:02:02,486 --> 00:02:04,681
[ Skipped item nr. 1 ]

2
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:10,226
-Detective.
-WiIkenson, right?

3
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:11,454
-Yeah.
-Okay, what have we got?

4
00:02:11,528 --> 00:02:13,860
WeII, the techies are done,
so they covered her up.

5
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,193
This way.

6
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:34,079
-What?
-It's a hooker, sir.

7
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,815
It's pretty nasty.

8
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:39,351
-Any witnesses?
-No.

9
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,390
What's wrong with you?

10
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:27,853
BiII and I had a coupIe of drinks
after work Iast night.

11
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:29,398
UntiI 400 a.m.?

12
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,567
The victim was a young woman
in her thirties.

13
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:35,298
L.A. County Police are expected to
issue a statement here,

14
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:37,670
at the West Hollywood Sheriff's station,
in a few minutes.

15
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:41,233
But speculation is they believe the murders
may have been designed to imitate

16
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:44,644
those committed seven years ago
by Alonzo Rodriguez.

17
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:46,273
The murder weapon in use was a knife.

18
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:56,081
...knife...

19
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,050
...knife...

20
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:14,236
ln July, after an extraordinarily short
appeals process,

21
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:17,747
Alonzo Rodriguez was executed
for brutally murdering two women

22
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:20,147
-in West Hollywood, both prostitutes.
-Oh, my God.

23
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:21,445
Detective!

24
00:05:21,518 --> 00:05:23,782
Detective, do you have any indication
why the murderer wouId imitate

25
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:25,048
the Rodriguez case?

26
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,056
I'm not going to taIk
about the Rodriguez case.

27
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:29,251
As far as I'm concerned,
this is an isoIated incident.

28
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:32,523
Can you confirm that
the victim was a prostitute?

29
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:36,130
It does appear that the woman
was a prostitute,

30
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,724
but I'm afraid that's aII I can say right now.

31
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:38,893
Detective Manning, one more question!

32
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,971
So, how much is Ieft?

33
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:54,078
We have enough for this month.
Maybe two more payments.

34
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:57,450
OnIy three peopIe have come
to Iook at it since May.

35
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:00,552
Drop the rent to 800.

36
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:14,032
Any more of
those effeminate fucking IittIe knocks,

37
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:17,267
you're gonna get
some unwanted attention, Detective.

38
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:18,968
Who says it'II be unwanted?

39
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:21,909
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-Hey, I asked for PaImdaIe,

40
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,379
but I guess LASD thought
I'd fit in better in West HoIIywood.

41
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:26,780
Yeah, maybe outside the buiIding.

42
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,341
-No wonder your Iast partner quit.
-Let's get something straight.

43
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:30,613
Can I use that word?

44
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:34,555
Somebody must have been fucking
brain dead to assign a rookie to this case.

45
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,788
-Look, I spent 1 4 months...
-I reaIIy don't give a fuck.

46
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:40,853
Just don't throw any of that shit in my face.

47
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,591
Man, you're worse than my dad.

48
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,363
This just came in.

49
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,808
Isn't that supposed to stay seaIed?

50
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,849
Who eIse has seen this?

51
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:07,755
It's better to start up and dust down,
so the dust doesn't fIy up into your face.

52
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:11,654
-Good.
-Watch this.

53
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:14,797
I can hear you, EIIen.

54
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,561
I'm going out.

55
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:19,932
Take your damn piIIs.

56
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:24,269
No one's gonna rent this pIace
if they think the IandIady's a Iunatic.

57
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,675
WeII, what if the IandIord is?

58
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:44,851
-HeIIo?
-Hi, hon. lt's Dad.

59
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:47,194
-Hi, Daddy.
-Listen, darling,

60
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,562
l was thinking about visiting your mother.

61
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,498
No, you can't. PIease.

62
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,798
Why not? She's allowed visitors, isn't she?

63
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,634
Because she's isn't ready to see you yet,
that's why.

64
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:58,732
-Did she tell you that?
-No, the doctor did.

65
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,142
What about you? Did the doctor say
anything about you staying away from me?

66
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:05,306
No, Dad. Look,
l'm just really focused on Mom right now.

67
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:07,976
-What about dinner?
-Dad, l've got midterms.

68
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:10,884
l've got a lab due on Thursday,
there's a paper due in a couple of weeks

69
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:12,216
-and it's just...
-No, no, no, I understand.

70
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,120
-l'm just really busy right now.
-Yeah. I know.

71
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:16,159
No, it's okay. I've got...

72
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,191
-Got a Iot of work to do here, myseIf.
-l really gotta go.

73
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:21,059
-Sure.
-Maybe tomorrow.

74
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,326
Tomorrow. Okay.

75
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,298
Just a minute.

76
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:30,556
-HeIIo?
-I'm sorry,

77
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:33,501
I shouId have caIIed first.
I was waIking past,

78
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,835
-and I noticed your sign.
-Yes.

79
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:41,037
I've been Iooking for a quiet room,
and a guest house sounded IoveIy.

80
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,041
Come in.

81
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:52,153
SmeIIs good.

82
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,391
So, have you just moved to L.A.?

83
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:01,488
Not reaIIy.
I'm just Iooking for something new.

84
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,760
You know, something to inspire me.

85
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,971
Oh, I'm sorry. It's this way.

86
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:14,169
Great.

87
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:19,109
You wouId be weIcome to
use the kitchen on your own,

88
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:21,810
but the rent does incIude breakfast,

89
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,853
usuaIIy untiI about 900.

90
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,852
Or are you a Iate riser?

91
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:28,686
Yes, I'm afraid I am.

92
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:32,457
What is this, some kind of gang attack?

93
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,191
Not unIess the others
just stood around and watched.

94
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:39,099
This was one guy,
and he was cIearIy copying Rodriguez.

95
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:41,433
It's identicaI. Look at this.

96
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:43,632
There are aImost 40 separate incisions,

97
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:46,369
each with the same angIe of entry,

98
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:49,435
-same tearing motion.
-Lefty?

99
00:10:49,513 --> 00:10:51,606
He definiteIy used his Ieft hand,

100
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:55,242
but each wound was created
with varying force.

101
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:58,185
My guess is
he was just trying to Iook Iike a Iefty.

102
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:02,021
-Bastard did his homework.
-Yeah. WeII, not compIeteIy.

103
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:04,754
The Rodriguez kiIIings
were acts of sadistic vioIence,

104
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:08,264
where both victims died
after muItipIe wounds.

105
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:12,290
PresumabIy so that
he couId watch them die sIowIy.

106
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:15,566
This one died immediateIy,

107
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,573
after the first incision to her throat.

108
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,801
He had a conscience?

109
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,275
WeII, it depends on
what you caII a conscience.

110
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:23,505
A case Iike this, actuaIIy,

111
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,674
you're casing
an entireIy different psychoIogicaI profiIe.

112
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,777
-Took pity on her, for Christ's sake.
-Wow. ReaI fucking sweetheart.

113
00:11:31,588 --> 00:11:34,148
-Thank you, Sam.
-Hey...

114
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:36,351
I was sorry to hear about
aII that with your wife.

115
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:39,293
-Is she doing any better?
-No.

116
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:08,318
What do you do? I mean, for work.

117
00:12:08,391 --> 00:12:10,086
Oh, I write.

118
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,527
So, I must have compIete quiet, and privacy.

119
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:32,381
I'd Iike to take it. Right away.

120
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:37,582
-But you haven't even asked the rent.
-WeII, I'm sure it's fair.

121
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:39,781
I have a great sense of those I can trust.

122
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:41,721
I'm MaIcoIm SIaight.

123
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,816
I'm EIIen Bunting.

124
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,453
My husband, Joe, weII, he works Iate...

125
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:49,327
It's important to me that
I wouId have the onIy key.

126
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,959
Oh, yes. Of course. Except for me.

127
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:55,329
But I can't be disturbed.

128
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:59,671
-You wiII taIk to your husband. Not at aII.
-Oh, he won't bother you.

129
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,542
WouId $1,000 a month be acceptabIe?
With breakfast.

130
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:17,586
I aImost forgot. About references...

131
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:20,494
I won't be needing those. Just privacy.

132
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:24,831
Thank you.

133
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:33,536
This is Miss SaIIy Harrison.

134
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,303
Or what's Ieft of her.

135
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:39,473
Her body was found
at approximateIy 315 a.m. Iast night

136
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:42,814
on the 8400 bIock of Sunset and OIive.

137
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:48,756
She was 23 years oId, 5'3'' taII,
Caucasian and a prostitute.

138
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,864
Thirty-nine separate knife wounds.

139
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,900
No witnesses,

140
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:00,431
no obvious suspects,

141
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:02,770
no motive.

142
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:07,369
Other than this bastard
is cIearIy copying Rodriguez's MO.

143
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,407
Okay. That's it.

144
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:14,750
Who are they?

145
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:17,652
Smith, LAPD.

146
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:20,053
And he brought the Feds.

147
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:24,389
They'II be aII over us on this
after ChandIer smoked them on Rodriguez.

148
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:10,834
-What are you doing?
-I toId you not to disturb me.

149
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:14,970
I just thought you might Iike some tea.

150
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:18,508
I'm sorry. Just Ieave it there, pIease.

151
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:27,149
-What's wrong with them?
-They were aII staring at me.

152
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:28,690
FoIIowing me.

153
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,587
Everywhere. It's a IittIe unnerving.

154
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:35,631
-Oh, weII, I'II have Joe come and take...
-No!

155
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:40,730
PIease, we've aIready taIked about this.
I don't want anyone eIse coming in here.

156
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:42,362
Ever.

157
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:45,340
-I'II bring them out.
-WeII,

158
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:48,002
-do you need anything eIse?
-Just a IittIe rest, I'm afraid.

159
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:52,241
Oh, and if you couId pick up some things
for me at the market?

160
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:56,411
-That's way too much.
-Keep it, pIease.

161
00:15:56,486 --> 00:16:00,081
Whatever you think, bread, cereaI,
I'm not too particuIar.

162
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:01,487
Thank you.

163
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,191
About food.

164
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:16,472
I couIdn't see his face.
It was raining, and he was running away.

165
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:20,134
He was wearing one of those Iong coats,
Iike Neo.

166
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,805
-What was the coIor of the coat?
-PurpIe, dickhead!

167
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,541
Have Jim come in here for a sketch.

168
00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:29,176
We need height and buiId,
maIe with a Iong, dark coat.

169
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:33,255
-When Jim's done, Iet him go.
-Let him go?

170
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:36,153
Get anything eIse out of him, keep him.

171
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:40,796
Right.

172
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:45,326
-What...
-Fuck off! Can I go now, man?

173
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,611
This is reaIIy wonderfuI, honey.

174
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:02,981
I got it at the deIi after cIass
about an hour ago.

175
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:06,119
StiII good.

176
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,488
You put her there.

177
00:17:13,496 --> 00:17:15,726
-Amanda, pIease don't say that.
-Ask her doctors.

178
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,859
You were obsessive
and reIentIessIy controIIing.

179
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,835
Nothing she did was
ever good enough for you.

180
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:26,000
-You know, she toId me even in bed...
-Stop it!

181
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:37,948
Honey, I know I couId have
done things differentIy, but this is...

182
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:41,513
-There's more to this...
-You're to bIame for this.

183
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:44,226
Amanda, that's not true.

184
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,299
I have a reaIIy earIy cIass tomorrow, so...

185
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:14,554
-Okay, I'II caII you Iater.
-Bye.

186
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,208
What happened to the sign?

187
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,414
-I rented it.
-You rented it?

188
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:48,082
-He's aIready moved in.
-What?

189
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:50,591
A man. MaIcoIm something.

190
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:54,260
He's aIready given us
three months in advance.

191
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,858
And I didn't even have to Iower the rate
because I couId teII he reaIIy wanted it.

192
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:01,460
-I did incIude breakfast.
-That's from your famiIy.

193
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:03,837
No, it isn't.

194
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:10,009
He's been busy back there
taking down aII your mother's prints.

195
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,139
But don't... Don't go in there.

196
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:16,777
He onIy wants me to go back there.

197
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:20,289
Are you kidding?
Sure he's not some kind of wacko?

198
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:23,587
He's a bit eccentric.
Seems perfectIy harmIess.

199
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,959
Anyway, what choice do we have?

200
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,064
-Anything back from the techies?
-Not a Iot.

201
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:41,599
Let's see, there was nothing
under the fingernaiIs, no foreign fibers,

202
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:43,805
no signs of sexuaI activity.

203
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,408
He either surprised her or he knew her
because there are no signs of a struggIe.

204
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,713
So, other than the pimp,
nobody saw anything.

205
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:52,983
Right in the middIe of
fucking Sunset BouIevard.

206
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:55,991
-What about the Ietter?
-WeII, there are a bunch of prints,

207
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,085
but they onIy match the peopIe
who handIed it before it got here.

208
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:01,995
The maiI room, the post office,
and you, of course.

209
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:03,999
Nothing back yet on the paper
or the ink type.

210
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,329
That's it?

211
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:08,336
WeII, we stiII have someone on the pimp,
but he's cIean so far.

212
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:10,998
A cIean pimp? Now there's an oxymoron.

213
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:14,638
WeII, I doubt he's the kiIIer.

214
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:25,745
Of course he's not the kiIIer, you moron.

215
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:28,552
Now I know this is your first case
and you're trying reaI hard to impress

216
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:30,114
aII your fucking friends,

217
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:33,253
but I reaIIy need you
to start finding me some suspects

218
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:36,526
and stop wasting my time
confirming the innocent ones.

219
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,760
Now whisper something to me, quick.

220
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:40,564
-I don't know what you...
-Yeah, that's a good idea.

221
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:43,036
I'II check up on that. Thank you.

222
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:58,645
Joe!

223
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,852
Joe!

224
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:09,923
Joe!

225
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:13,099
I picked the big bear

226
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:14,664
and you picked the IittIe bear.

227
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:18,537
I'm sorry, mister,
but that is exactIy the bear that you picked.

228
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,534
These are for you, are they not?

229
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:24,273
-I Iike those.
-I know you do.

230
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:26,573
Joe!

231
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:29,810
Joe!

232
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:37,792
You're stiII here? Didn't you hear me?

233
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,987
-What's that smeII?
-GranoIa.

234
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,358
It's not for you.

235
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:49,938
-We got the Iate shift.
-WeII, just don't wake the Iodger.

236
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:53,271
And take your boots off
before you trudge drunkenIy up the stairs.

237
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:56,004
I wouId Iike to get some sIeep, too.

238
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:58,046
I'II do whatever I want.

239
00:22:00,283 --> 00:22:02,808
Just take the medicine, EIIen, okay?

240
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:45,686
You foIIowing me, sweetheart?

241
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:40,231
What do you have, Sam?

242
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:46,142
AII of her reproductive organs
were removed,

243
00:24:46,215 --> 00:24:50,015
as if he were giving her a cesarean section.

244
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:51,713
HoIy shit.

245
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:53,118
Better cover her up.

246
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:55,521
No. No, I'm okay.

247
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:57,320
There's more.

248
00:24:57,393 --> 00:25:02,421
I was wrong. He's not imitating Rodriguez.
He is Rodriguez.

249
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:05,625
-Was she aIive?
-Through the whoIe thing.

250
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:08,602
Everything's identicaI. Strong right hand,

251
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:11,731
successive three-quarter-inch incisions,
curved bIade,

252
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:15,766
aIternating Ieft to right, then right to Ieft.

253
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:18,712
Sorry, Chan.
I know this makes you Iook bad.

254
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:21,409
He's back.

255
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:23,042
Wait a minute.

256
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,679
You're teIIing me that this guy,
who kiIIed these two hookers,

257
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:27,245
is the same guy that kiIIed the two women

258
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:29,291
Rodriguez was executed for
seven years ago?

259
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:31,223
-I'm sure of it.
-That is impossibIe.

260
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:33,420
There was bIood from both victims
in Rodriguez's apartment

261
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:34,520
and the murder weapon.

262
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:36,588
WeII, somebody must have
framed Rodriguez

263
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:38,758
because it's the same handiwork.

264
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:42,531
I mean, exactIy the same.
He's teIIing us it's him,

265
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:45,472
Iike a surgeon signing his name.

266
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,532
And another thing.

267
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,544
You know who he's imitating, don't you?

268
00:25:49,612 --> 00:25:52,581
-Who?
-Thirty-nine incisions on the Iast one.

269
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:55,276
The whoIe body mutiIation, prostitutes...

270
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:56,784
I shouId have seen it.

271
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:57,876
Fuck.

272
00:25:57,953 --> 00:26:00,786
Who? Who is he imitating?

273
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:03,819
Jack the Ripper.

274
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:11,959
Another prostitute was brutally murdered
in West Hollywood last night.

275
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:14,798
Last night's violent murder here
on Sunset Boulevard is the second...

276
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,668
...second exact recreation
of the Jack the Ripper murders,

277
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,002
which occurred over 100 years ago.

278
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:21,441
News 15 sources believe
the LASD Coroner's Office

279
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,538
will shortly issue a report with evidence
that both women were cut exactly 39 times.

280
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:29,641
...killed at least 6 women in 1888,
was never caught.

281
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:09,351
You stay here, Timmy.

282
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,795
The violent murder of two women
in West Hollywood this week

283
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:21,030
seems to precisely mimic

284
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:24,300
the extraordinarily brutal crimes
committed by

285
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:27,865
Jack the Ripper, in London,
over 100 years ago.

286
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:30,036
Further, we are exploring the possibility

287
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:33,081
that these recent murders
may have been committed by

288
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:35,481
the same man who killed two women

289
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:37,746
in a similar fashion

290
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,789
on Sunset Boulevard seven years ago.

291
00:27:40,856 --> 00:27:43,381
-Detective!
-Detective, over here!

292
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:45,324
-Just one question!
-Over here! Does this mean...

293
00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:47,794
ls it possible Alonzo Rodriguez
was innocent of the two murders

294
00:27:47,863 --> 00:27:50,195
for which you and the DA
had him executed?

295
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:04,508
ln light of new evidence,
LASD has informed the mayor's office

296
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,878
that it intends to reopen the Rodriguez file.

297
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:07,938
Sir! Detective!

298
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:09,348
Detective! Question, one more question!

299
00:28:09,418 --> 00:28:12,910
Detective Manning, please, over here!
Sir! Please, please, sir!

300
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:18,960
TeII Gregor to puII up anything he can
on Jack the Ripper.

301
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:22,156
TimeIine, number of victims,
odd facts, anything.

302
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,892
This Iunatic's not done yet.

303
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:25,957
-Where you going?
-Be back around 400.

304
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,656
Mr. Manning.

305
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:03,269
Hi, I'm Dr. Stevens.

306
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:06,638
I'd Iike to speak with you for a moment
before you see your wife.

307
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:11,775
She's making some progress, but stiII
experiences intense bouts of depression.

308
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:15,374
It's necessary for us to
have someone with her at aII times.

309
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:18,215
Your daughter was adamant that
you not be aIIowed to visit.

310
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:22,348
Yeah, you peopIe didn't seem
so excited about me being here either.

311
00:29:22,424 --> 00:29:25,791
WeII, that's more your daughter's
feeIing right now than your wife's.

312
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:27,419
Or mine.

313
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:30,329
But just to be safe,
if she begins to get upset, even sIightIy,

314
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,492
I'm going to have the attending nurse
stop the visit immediateIy.

315
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,433
What do you peopIe think I'm gonna do?

316
00:29:34,503 --> 00:29:35,868
She's my wife, for Christ's sake.

317
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:37,667
Just don't expect too much,
she's extremeIy...

318
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,176
Are you gonna Iet me see her, or not?

319
00:29:58,127 --> 00:29:59,685
HeIIo, ChandIer.

320
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:01,992
Hi, Mags.

321
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,361
It's good to see you.

322
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:06,901
Yeah, I'm sure I Iook wonderfuI.

323
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:12,737
No, you Iook good.

324
00:30:19,248 --> 00:30:22,979
I hope it's aII right I came.

325
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:26,246
I suppose I'II aIways have this.

326
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,090
Why'd you do it, Mags?

327
00:30:46,942 --> 00:30:48,910
You have to go.

328
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:51,377
-Mags, pIease.
-No, I can't. PIease.

329
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:53,739
Nurse.

330
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:55,215
You have to Ieave now, Mr. Manning.

331
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:56,683
PIease.

332
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:58,208
Now!

333
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,219
Oh, God!

334
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:07,819
No! Leave me aIone!

335
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:17,001
Don't touch me!

336
00:31:17,873 --> 00:31:19,568
PIease!

337
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:22,769
Go! Go!

338
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Leave me aIone! No! PIease, no!

339
00:31:40,362 --> 00:31:41,989
I'd have come for that.

340
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:43,861
It was deIicious.

341
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:45,695
Thank you.

342
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:47,668
WouId you Iike some coffee?

343
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:50,637
That wouId be nice.

344
00:32:00,115 --> 00:32:02,481
Where's your husband?

345
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:05,543
-He's at work.
-I thought he worked nights.

346
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:07,782
He Ieaves earIy.

347
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:11,257
He goes to the gym,
and then does who-knows-what beforehand.

348
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:13,658
And gets in at 300 a.m.?

349
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:14,855
You heard him.

350
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,763
That doesn't Ieave you
a Iot of time together.

351
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:19,959
No.

352
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:29,510
WeII, what time did you get in Iast night?
You must have been very quiet.

353
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:34,312
I'm sorry.
I know that's none of my business.

354
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:38,342
I'm afraid I have some work I need to do.

355
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:42,890
Thank you for the breakfast.

356
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:48,655
I'm gIad you came over.

357
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:02,207
There's no damn way I'm handing this
over to the Feds. Or LAPD.

358
00:33:02,277 --> 00:33:06,373
Look, it's too Iate, okay?
The Fed profiIer is meeting with Sam now

359
00:33:06,448 --> 00:33:09,144
-and they wanna see us at 300.
-Shit.

360
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:11,186
AII right. We'II meet the profiIer.

361
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:12,811
But when Smith comes,
you don't show him a fucking thing.

362
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:15,288
You got me? Not a fucking thing.

363
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:53,189
What are you doing?

364
00:33:54,196 --> 00:33:59,224
I was trying to dry my trousers
and they caught fire.

365
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:02,361
You're weIcome to use the dryer
in the house.

366
00:34:02,437 --> 00:34:05,736
WeII, these are Iost now.

367
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:09,368
Think I might borrow one or two
of the things I saw in the cIoset?

368
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:10,502
Sure.

369
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:12,911
It seems your husband and I are a cIose fit.

370
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:18,451
So, he wants everything.

371
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,920
Who was kiIIed, how many, when, how,

372
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:23,423
-poIice reports...
-From 1888?

373
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:25,153
Come on, you don't need me for this.

374
00:34:25,227 --> 00:34:27,991
Everything on Jack the Ripper
is in the pubIic record.

375
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:29,553
Why don't you just GoogIe it?

376
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:32,498
Or go get the book
down at the Barnes & NobIe?

377
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:35,128
Look, he wants it by 300, okay?

378
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,134
I mean, it beats me why you didn't
think it was the same guy aII aIong.

379
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:44,667
-Going after whores, cutting them up...
-Find me the fiIe number, wouId you?

380
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:45,940
AII right, here it is.

381
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:48,539
RoIston, with an ''O.''

382
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:52,678
WeII, two ''O's.'' 1 422, aisIe 1 4, second sheIf.

383
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:56,486
So you fried the wrong guy?

384
00:34:56,558 --> 00:34:59,220
That's a bummer, huh, Detective?

385
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:00,318
Fuck off.

386
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:50,608
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Why are you foIIowing me?

387
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,044
Fuck you, man!

388
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:53,912
Just making sure you had the fiIes.

389
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:56,212
Get the fuck out of here.

390
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:56,867
You know your man Manning
was here today.

391
00:36:56,945 --> 00:36:59,175
-You know, the cop on TV.
-Manning's here?

392
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:01,647
Just went out the back door.

393
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,519
Shit.

394
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:07,919
-Did he take anything?
-Said he couIdn't find

395
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:09,251
what he wanted. AsshoIe.

396
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:12,894
I go back there to make sure he found
the fiIes, bastard puIIs a gun on me.

397
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:15,191
A gun? What fiIe name did he want?

398
00:37:15,263 --> 00:37:16,662
RoIston, with an ''O.''

399
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:18,859
WeII, two ''O's.''

400
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:51,799
What am I doing?

401
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,312
I forgot my bag.

402
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,588
Who were you expecting?

403
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,558
Sorry. Sorry I'm Iate.

404
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:29,536
Doctor's appointment.
So, Doc, what have we got?

405
00:38:29,604 --> 00:38:33,096
How big, how oId, Hispanic, White,
Asian, what?

406
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:35,473
WeII, I can't give you specifics, Detective.
You know that.

407
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:37,171
Just a generaI profiIe.

408
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:39,907
And even there, we have to be carefuI
about making too many assumptions,

409
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:43,610
as your kiIIer IikeIy knows he's being
evaIuated and wiII modify his behavior

410
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:45,118
to keep from giving away too much.

411
00:38:45,187 --> 00:38:48,315
So what you're basicaIIy saying is
that he couId be messing with us?

412
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,858
Yes, that's right.

413
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:53,554
Jesus Christ, couId somebody
pIease teII me something we don't know?

414
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:56,358
Come on, ChandIer.
Let's at Ieast hear what she's got.

415
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,998
The precise repIication
of the murders of Jack the Ripper

416
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:03,537
is cIearIy psychotic obsessive.

417
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:07,200
And we have to consider that
the comments made by Detective Manning

418
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:09,800
severaI years ago,
comparing Rodriguez to the Ripper,

419
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:12,574
-may weII have triggered this obsession.
-BuIIshit!

420
00:39:12,647 --> 00:39:14,638
That was after
he'd cut two women to pieces.

421
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:17,241
What is this,
some kind of retroactive obsession?

422
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:18,843
She may be right, Chan.

423
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,582
Those first two murders
were aII over the pIace.

424
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:24,921
They were cut up, but no reaI MO,
not Iike these ones.

425
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:26,187
Gee, thanks, Sam.

426
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:28,195
He's obviousIy extremeIy inteIIigent,

427
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:30,322
and from the way
the Iast victim was dissected,

428
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:32,923
it Iooks Iike he's had
some formaI medicaI training.

429
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:34,263
What about motive?

430
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:38,773
DifficuIt. It couId be a consequence
of any number of psychoIogicaI factors,

431
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,709
psychosis, schizophrenia, bi-poIar,
chiIdhood trauma, sexuaI abuse.

432
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,782
A seriaI kiIIer's motives, anger,
desire for revenge, whatever,

433
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,717
are aImost aIways profoundIy abstracted.

434
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:55,119
In this case, it's odd because,
whiIe there's enormous sexuaI rage,

435
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,249
there isn't any actuaI sexuaI assauIt.

436
00:39:57,325 --> 00:40:00,260
-Is that typicaI?
-Nothing's typicaI. It is unusuaI,

437
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:03,855
however, to find such a vioIent
manifestation of hyper-vigiIant psychosis

438
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:08,335
directed at the opposing gender
without an autoerotic trigger.

439
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,329
It means he gets off on the kiIIing.

440
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:16,242
And the chase, of course.
Not unIike the originaI Jack the Ripper.

441
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:19,303
What about the gap?
Why wouId he kiII two women,

442
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:21,679
then disappear for seven years,
then start aII over again?

443
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,811
Two, ten, twenty years,
sometimes they're abIe to stop aItogether.

444
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:28,720
I imagine that, most of the time,
this guy appears normaI,

445
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:32,624
Iike you and I. Has a job, goes to work,
maybe even has a famiIy.

446
00:40:32,694 --> 00:40:35,561
So, he just couIdn't hoId off anymore?

447
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,188
PossibIy.

448
00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:38,527
Or?

449
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,367
Or he wants to get back in the IimeIight
again, misses the cat and mouse.

450
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:46,965
But my guess is
he's fixated on you, Detective.

451
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:50,978
I think he wants to get cIoser, and is
Ieaving these Ripper cIues on purpose.

452
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:53,475
That's where I wouId start.

453
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:36,044
Thought you might have
some scissors Iying around.

454
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:53,215
Two-for-one tonight, hon.

455
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:57,987
-Piss off!
-You piss off, Iimp dick!

456
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:10,696
What about this guy?

457
00:45:10,772 --> 00:45:12,763
He Iooks kind of cute.

458
00:46:01,189 --> 00:46:02,451
WeII?

459
00:46:02,523 --> 00:46:07,517
WeII, I think this is an exact re-creation
of the doubIe Ripper murders

460
00:46:07,595 --> 00:46:11,759
of EIizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes
on September 30, 1888.

461
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:12,857
You've been doing your homework.

462
00:46:12,934 --> 00:46:15,164
The Ietter with the red ink
that we received three days ago?

463
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:17,397
That is word for word the same
as the ''Dear Boss'' Ietter

464
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:20,999
that the Ripper sent three days before
Stride and Eddowes were murdered.

465
00:46:21,075 --> 00:46:23,669
-Got something here, Detective.
-I know.

466
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:32,542
-Looks Iike about a 10.
-Yeah.

467
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,316
WiII you get these peopIe the heII back?

468
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,524
I want a photograph of that.

469
00:46:42,563 --> 00:46:44,497
Excuse me.

470
00:46:48,903 --> 00:46:50,268
''Batty''? What does that mean?

471
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:53,535
I don't know,
but it sure as heII means something.

472
00:46:54,175 --> 00:46:56,143
Hey, shouIdn't we have forensics do that?

473
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,839
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

474
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:03,976
It's been cut with scissors.

475
00:47:04,052 --> 00:47:06,520
How did you know that was in there?

476
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:09,613
A piece of Catherine Eddowes' apron
was found on GouIston Street

477
00:47:09,691 --> 00:47:11,352
the night of the doubIe Ripper murders.

478
00:47:11,426 --> 00:47:14,327
It had been used to scrawI
a message in bIood, just Iike over there.

479
00:47:14,395 --> 00:47:16,625
-And there was a witness.
-What?

480
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:19,827
The Eddowes murder.

481
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:22,468
There was a witness.

482
00:47:24,472 --> 00:47:26,235
How taII was he?

483
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,910
WeII, he was maybe about your height.

484
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:40,117
Was he White, BIack, Hispanic?

485
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,455
I onIy saw him from behind.

486
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:52,189
It was just too dark.

487
00:47:52,400 --> 00:48:01,707
But he was wearing a Iong, dark coat.

488
00:48:02,944 --> 00:48:06,937
Oh, and he was carrying a smaII,

489
00:48:08,683 --> 00:48:10,913
bIack

490
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:12,748
bag.

491
00:48:14,222 --> 00:48:16,053
...over 100 years ago.

492
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:19,389
And speculation is growing
that this may in fact be

493
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,759
the same killer who murdered
two prostitutes on Sunset Boulevard

494
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:23,990
seven years ago.

495
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:27,865
Which would mean the L.A. County
Sheriff's Office and District Attorney

496
00:48:27,935 --> 00:48:31,735
may have wrongly convicted
and executed Alonzo Rodriguez.

497
00:48:31,806 --> 00:48:35,207
How many more innocent peopIe
Iike AIonzo Rodriguez must die

498
00:48:35,276 --> 00:48:39,804
before we reaIize that it's the death penaIty
itseIf that's the mistake?

499
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:41,405
Right now, there are 600...

500
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:43,712
No, stay. Stay. It's a zoo out there.

501
00:48:43,785 --> 00:48:45,980
...awaiting execution in California prisons,

502
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:49,750
140 of whom no longer even have
lawyers to represent them.

503
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:51,314
Now, do the math.

504
00:48:51,392 --> 00:48:55,089
More innocent people will die
because of this archaic...

505
00:48:55,163 --> 00:48:58,963
This guy is intentionaIIy stoking up
the Latino community.

506
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,065
Things couId get nasty for a whiIe.

507
00:49:01,135 --> 00:49:04,104
Yeah, but he's right. I missed something.

508
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:06,003
What?

509
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:07,836
CIose the door.

510
00:49:17,218 --> 00:49:19,413
What's this?

511
00:49:20,488 --> 00:49:22,149
The Lusk Ietter?

512
00:49:22,824 --> 00:49:24,451
The one that the Ripper sent to George Lusk

513
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:26,220
after the doubIe murders
of Stride and Eddowes?

514
00:49:26,294 --> 00:49:27,921
Did this just come in?

515
00:49:27,995 --> 00:49:29,394
It was in the Rodriguez fiIe.

516
00:49:29,464 --> 00:49:31,091
Rodriguez?

517
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:34,225
-That was seven years ago.
-You remember what the Fed profiIer said?

518
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:36,327
-Yeah.
-WeII, she was right.

519
00:49:36,404 --> 00:49:41,341
After we arrested Rodriguez,
I made some offhand comment to the press

520
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:46,403
about how we'd gotten rid
of a modern day Jack the Ripper.

521
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:50,417
A few days Iater, the Ietter arrived.

522
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:55,479
You know, strange shit comes in here
aII the time. I just tossed it in the fiIe.

523
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:59,491
I compIeteIy forgot about it, untiI
we received the ''Dear Boss'' Ietter Iast week.

524
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,027
WeII, we don't know it's from the same guy.

525
00:50:01,095 --> 00:50:05,589
No, I had it tested, outside.
Ink, paper, handwriting,

526
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:07,930
-it's aII the same.
-You took something

527
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:10,698
out of Rodriguez's fiIe, tested it,
and didn't teII anyone about it?

528
00:50:10,771 --> 00:50:12,932
Jesus Christ, you are such a fucking rookie.

529
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:16,340
How Iong do you think it wouId take
for Smith and the Feds to move in here

530
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,742
once they found out
we'd missed key evidence

531
00:50:18,813 --> 00:50:20,872
on the Rodriguez case? Take a Iook at this.

532
00:50:20,948 --> 00:50:23,644
He's been matching the originaI Ripper
victim for victim.

533
00:50:23,718 --> 00:50:26,687
Just Annie Chapman
and Mary Jane KeIIy Ieft.

534
00:50:26,754 --> 00:50:29,655
If we don't catch this guy,
he's gonna kiII two more women

535
00:50:29,724 --> 00:50:32,090
and then what?
Disappear for another seven fucking years?

536
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,322
We got a week. Maybe two, and that's it!

537
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:39,093
You think Smith's gonna come in here
and heIp us catch this guy?

538
00:50:41,903 --> 00:50:43,768
Hey, what's this?

539
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:45,966
It's the footprint from
the doubIe murder scene.

540
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,507
It's a boot, actuaIIy.

541
00:50:47,575 --> 00:50:50,976
Size 10. Made by Raptor Footwear
out of Washington State.

542
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:53,707
Rubber soIe. You couId find these
aII over the pIace 10 years ago.

543
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:55,408
Tread's worn thin.

544
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,876
-HeIIo?
-Detective Manning,

545
00:50:56,951 --> 00:50:59,010
-l have the Mayor for you.
-Hi, BiII.

546
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:00,144
l need you to come down to City Hall.

547
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:02,485
Yeah...

548
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:04,653
No, I'II be there.

549
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,657
...and that Detective Manning
drew his service revoIver

550
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:13,063
and pointed it at the attendant

551
00:51:13,134 --> 00:51:16,570
in a threatening manner
without provocation.

552
00:51:16,637 --> 00:51:19,037
Further, Detective Manning has
systematicaIIy excIuded

553
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:22,132
aII outside agencies
from the information chain

554
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:23,938
in order to impede an independent review

555
00:51:24,011 --> 00:51:27,242
of the case by the LAPD
and the FBI in particuIar.

556
00:51:27,315 --> 00:51:29,180
TeII us what you took from Rodriguez's fiIe.

557
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,946
AII this is buIIshit! Come on, BiII.

558
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:34,510
Can't you see Smith's just trying
to weaseI his way into this?

559
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:36,022
What, you're gonna Iet him?

560
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,389
Threatening a co-worker
is hardIy buIIshit, Manning.

561
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,487
IA shouId have shut down
your antiquated cowboy crap years ago.

562
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:45,225
You're gonna have to
take some time off, ChandIer.

563
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:49,258
Oh, so I guess you found
your scapegoat for this one, huh, BiII?

564
00:51:50,972 --> 00:51:55,033
It is our decision, therefore,
that Detective Manning is hereby suspended

565
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:56,872
-pending psychoIogicaI evaIuation...
-Fuck this shit.

566
00:51:56,944 --> 00:51:59,037
...and a more formaI
and comprehensive review

567
00:51:59,113 --> 00:52:03,550
of these charges by InternaI Affairs.
Without pay.

568
00:52:09,023 --> 00:52:11,218
Just a minute.

569
00:52:14,895 --> 00:52:16,863
Room service.

570
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:18,728
Look at you.

571
00:52:32,413 --> 00:52:37,248
I got mud on them Iast night,
waIking across the garden.

572
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:40,151
I cIeaned them in the sink, I'm sorry.

573
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:44,282
Those oId things, who cares?

574
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,923
I recognize that shirt.

575
00:52:49,363 --> 00:52:52,264
Yeah, it fits perfectIy.

576
00:52:56,737 --> 00:52:59,570
WeII, if you don't need anything eIse...

577
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,089
There you are.

578
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:25,989
What are you doing back here?

579
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,221
I'm washing your boots.

580
00:54:49,183 --> 00:54:51,151
Smith orchestrated this.

581
00:54:51,652 --> 00:54:53,210
So what are you gonna do?

582
00:54:54,555 --> 00:54:55,544
I don't know.

583
00:54:56,657 --> 00:54:58,591
My daughter won't speak to me,

584
00:54:58,659 --> 00:55:00,786
my wife can't speak to me.

585
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,088
Who knows,
maybe you and I shouId hang out

586
00:55:04,165 --> 00:55:05,996
with some of your interior decorator friends.

587
00:55:06,066 --> 00:55:07,693
You do need a break.

588
00:55:07,768 --> 00:55:10,259
Not untiI I see this Iunatic hang.

589
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:12,464
I thought you didn't beIieve
in the death penaIty.

590
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,770
You've been watching too much TV.

591
00:55:15,643 --> 00:55:18,441
StiII meeting this Ripper author
with me tomorrow?

592
00:55:18,512 --> 00:55:20,412
What, that guy? What's the point?

593
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:23,746
We know everything about
what Jack the Ripper did.

594
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:28,482
Names of victims, where, when, and how.
We don't know him,

595
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:29,716
who he was.

596
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,088
There is no him, ChandIer.
The Ripper was never caught.

597
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,060
Yeah, but we know the names
of aII the main suspects.

598
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:38,326
It's my guess this Iunatic
is emuIating one of them.

599
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:40,594
-What do I teII Smith?
-Nothing.

600
00:56:04,725 --> 00:56:05,714
Shit.

601
00:56:21,842 --> 00:56:23,241
You Ieaked it.

602
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:24,709
-Watch yourseIf, Detective.
-That footprint

603
00:56:24,778 --> 00:56:27,679
was probabIy the onIy piece of information
the kiIIer didn't know we had.

604
00:56:27,748 --> 00:56:28,976
I mean, how eIse are we...

605
00:56:29,049 --> 00:56:30,983
There are other factors
invoIved here, WiIkenson,

606
00:56:31,051 --> 00:56:32,518
that you don't know about.

607
00:56:32,586 --> 00:56:36,022
The city is in hysterics. The pubIic wants to
know that we're making progress.

608
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,684
Are we trying to catch this guy,
or run a PR campaign?

609
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:42,525
Because the onIy progress I see is
towards more peopIe getting kiIIed.

610
00:56:42,596 --> 00:56:43,927
lt turns out l've made a great many mistakes.

611
00:56:44,932 --> 00:56:47,662
Alonzo Rodriguez's execution
should never have happened.

612
00:56:47,735 --> 00:56:51,398
Because the burden of proof in CaIifornia
death penaIty cases is too reIaxed?

613
00:56:51,472 --> 00:56:53,872
Not just CaIifornia. Look.

614
00:56:53,941 --> 00:56:57,934
How many convictions have been
overturned based on new DNA evidence?

615
00:56:58,012 --> 00:57:00,242
Check it out. Manning's Iost it.

616
00:57:00,314 --> 00:57:02,680
lt's not that l think serial killers
don't deserve to die...

617
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:07,346
The death penalty, it presupposes
the infallibility of a judicial system

618
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:09,412
where mistakes are made aII the time,

619
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,391
and that means that
innocent peopIe wiII continue to die.

620
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:16,156
AIonzo Rodriguez was one of them.

621
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,422
My part in that is something
l'm gonna have to live with for a long time.

622
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,229
Detective! Detective.

623
00:57:21,302 --> 00:57:24,931
Rumor has it that you've been fired,
and that LAPD has taken over the case.

624
00:57:25,005 --> 00:57:26,768
Is that true?

625
00:57:27,675 --> 00:57:30,769
Things aren't aIways
as simpIe as they seem.

626
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:56,331
Joe, there's something odd
going on with MaIcoIm. I think he...

627
00:57:56,403 --> 00:57:59,133
Wait, hoId on. Who's MaIcoIm?

628
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,901
Our Iodger.

629
00:58:01,976 --> 00:58:05,412
AII right, God damn it, pIease,
just cut the crap.

630
00:58:05,479 --> 00:58:09,006
-No, Joe, Iisten.
-No, stop it! You Iisten.

631
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:12,177
There is no one back there.

632
00:58:12,753 --> 00:58:13,777
Don't say that. You...

633
00:58:13,854 --> 00:58:16,288
-Okay. AII right. Get up.
-Listen, Iisten.

634
00:58:16,357 --> 00:58:19,417
-Get up! I'm so sick of this!
-He's gone out!

635
00:58:19,493 --> 00:58:21,757
-Come on, come on!
-No! Wait!

636
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:26,061
Promise me! Promise me you'II stop
this nonsense if there's no one there!

637
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:28,567
-He's out!
-Promise me!

638
00:58:28,635 --> 00:58:30,466
-Yes.
-Say it! Say, ''I promise.''

639
00:58:30,537 --> 00:58:32,164
I promise.

640
00:58:37,244 --> 00:58:39,144
Is anybody in there?

641
00:58:39,613 --> 00:58:42,275
Is anyone in there?

642
00:58:49,223 --> 00:58:50,815
No.

643
00:58:56,063 --> 00:58:58,258
There's no one in there.

644
00:59:04,405 --> 00:59:05,394
Joe!

645
00:59:22,122 --> 00:59:25,421
lt's Amanda. l'm not in.
Please leave a message.

646
00:59:25,492 --> 00:59:29,258
Amanda, honey, hi, it's Dad.
Sorry I'm caIIing so Iate.

647
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:35,097
I hope you can caII me back,
because I'd reaIIy Iove to see you.

648
00:59:38,372 --> 00:59:42,706
I know I haven't been there much
for you or for your mother,

649
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:46,075
but l'm sure you know l went to the clinic
yesterday and saw Mom.

650
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:49,547
She wasn't too happy to see me,
but she looked good.

651
00:59:49,616 --> 00:59:53,177
Well, l mean, it was good to see her.

652
00:59:53,253 --> 00:59:56,245
Maybe we could
go over there together and...

653
01:00:21,548 --> 01:00:25,109
Yeah, why the heII is Manning's name
on the suspect Iist?

654
01:00:26,587 --> 01:00:27,645
When?

655
01:00:27,721 --> 01:00:31,851
He steaIs evidence, and then
he asks you not to teII anyone? Why?

656
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,391
TeII him, Gregor.

657
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:39,893
After you Ieft my desk,
Captain Smith and the IA guys came back,

658
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:43,266
and they made me show them
what I was doing.

659
01:00:44,104 --> 01:00:46,197
Some of these sites you wouIdn't beIieve.

660
01:00:46,273 --> 01:00:48,833
This site, IuskfromheII.com,

661
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:53,243
it's named after the ''From HeII'' Ietter
that the Ripper sent to George Lusk in 1888,

662
01:00:53,313 --> 01:00:56,441
aIong with haIf
of Catherine Eddowes' kidney.

663
01:00:56,517 --> 01:00:59,247
He showed you the Lusk Ietter,
didn't he, Detective?

664
01:00:59,319 --> 01:01:01,879
The one he took from the Rodriguez fiIe?

665
01:01:01,955 --> 01:01:05,356
Yeah, weII, anyway,
Detective Manning was in the registry.

666
01:01:05,425 --> 01:01:08,690
So what?
Look, Manning's theory is to try to find out

667
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:11,925
which of the originaI Ripper suspects
the kiIIer is emuIating.

668
01:01:11,999 --> 01:01:14,160
And then, we'II be abIe
to predict his behavior.

669
01:01:14,234 --> 01:01:17,567
So, digging through some obscure
Ripper sites is just good research.

670
01:01:17,638 --> 01:01:19,105
That's exactIy what I thought,

671
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:22,734
but then I aIso found Manning's footprint
in registries of some of the smaIIer,

672
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:26,939
more intensively violent sites,
where he had logged in using an alias.

673
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:29,304
Anyway, the weird thing is,

674
01:01:29,383 --> 01:01:32,784
it turns out that Manning has been
a reguIar on a coupIe of these sites

675
01:01:32,853 --> 01:01:35,185
since earIy '97.

676
01:01:35,255 --> 01:01:38,884
That is about 18 months
before the first two murders.

677
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:41,757
The ones Rodriguez was framed for.

678
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:44,922
And that means that Manning has been
into this Ripper shit for years!

679
01:01:44,998 --> 01:01:48,058
Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense.
Why wouIdn't he have said anything?

680
01:01:48,135 --> 01:01:50,729
Because he's a fucking Iunatic, that's why!

681
01:01:50,804 --> 01:01:54,900
We beIieve Manning constructed
the case against Rodriguez,

682
01:01:54,975 --> 01:01:58,308
framing him for the first two murders
seven years ago.

683
01:01:58,378 --> 01:02:02,747
We beIieve now that he's setting up
someone eIse to take the faII aII over again.

684
01:02:02,816 --> 01:02:06,877
We've done some digging into
Manning's past. He fits the profiIe exactIy.

685
01:02:06,954 --> 01:02:10,253
What profiIe? The IoneIy burned-out cop
with maritaI probIems?

686
01:02:10,324 --> 01:02:11,951
No, this is textbook.

687
01:02:12,025 --> 01:02:16,018
In and out of foster homes as a kid,
troubIed famiIy Iife, suicidaI wife,

688
01:02:16,096 --> 01:02:17,620
depression, it's aII there.

689
01:02:17,698 --> 01:02:19,859
You just described haIf of L.A.,
for Christ's sake!

690
01:02:19,933 --> 01:02:22,367
Look, there's not a chance in heII
Manning kiIIed anyone.

691
01:02:22,436 --> 01:02:26,395
If you are too cIose, Detective,
you need to teII me now.

692
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:43,183
What are we doing here?

693
01:02:43,257 --> 01:02:46,715
I don't want Smith
seeing us meet with Lester.

694
01:02:46,793 --> 01:02:48,317
Interesting.

695
01:02:48,395 --> 01:02:51,421
ReIax. He said 400. Give him a few minutes.

696
01:02:51,498 --> 01:02:55,025
Look. TeII me, why did you want us
to assembIe a fiIe on Jack the Ripper

697
01:02:55,102 --> 01:02:59,266
-if you know so much about him yourseIf?
-No, the fiIe was for you.

698
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:05,102
The TumbIety case is interesting.
No one reaIIy knew he was a suspect

699
01:03:05,178 --> 01:03:06,611
untiI about 10 years ago,

700
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,843
when a Ietter written
by a ScotIand Yard Chief Inspector,

701
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:13,014
John LittIechiId,
was discovered by a journaIist,

702
01:03:13,086 --> 01:03:14,383
when seaIed documents were reIeased

703
01:03:14,454 --> 01:03:16,547
under the British Freedom
of Information Act.

704
01:03:16,623 --> 01:03:21,060
He was an American
who Iived in EngIand for a short time,

705
01:03:21,128 --> 01:03:25,963
his arrivaI in London neatIy coinciding
with when the murders started

706
01:03:26,033 --> 01:03:29,127
and his departure with
when they suddenIy stopped.

707
01:03:29,202 --> 01:03:32,797
The TumbIety theory hoIds
that no one knew he was a suspect

708
01:03:32,873 --> 01:03:36,172
because certain members
of the poIice kept it quiet

709
01:03:36,243 --> 01:03:38,837
and avoided reIeasing
any information on him

710
01:03:38,912 --> 01:03:42,404
for fear he might fIee,
which, of course, he did in the end anyway.

711
01:03:42,482 --> 01:03:44,416
And how do the facts here point to him?

712
01:03:44,484 --> 01:03:50,514
WeII, they don't, reaIIy, except for
what your witness said about a bIack bag.

713
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:55,618
l remember reading somewhere
that Tumblety left behind a black bag.

714
01:03:55,696 --> 01:03:57,994
At Ieast, I think it was TumbIety.
I'II have to check my notes.

715
01:03:58,065 --> 01:03:59,760
Yeah, so what have we got here?

716
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:02,802
KIosowski, the medicaI student,
Isenschmidt, the butcher,

717
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:05,804
TumbIety, the American. Which one is it?

718
01:04:06,606 --> 01:04:10,542
WeII, if you want one,
my guess is Isenschmidt, the butcher.

719
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,339
But I'd be carefuI about the obvious.

720
01:04:12,412 --> 01:04:15,006
There's a reason
the Ripper was never caught.

721
01:04:15,082 --> 01:04:19,451
And I doubt your kiIIer is Ieaving behind
any cIues he doesn't want to.

722
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,468
How Iong you been a Ripper expert?

723
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:41,131
A Iong time.

724
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:45,036
Why do you ask?

725
01:04:48,148 --> 01:04:50,946
Jack the Ripper was
the personification of eviI.

726
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:55,750
No motive, fIauntingIy vioIent, never caught.

727
01:04:55,822 --> 01:04:57,915
Iago with a knife.

728
01:04:57,991 --> 01:05:02,121
A fucking shadow Iurking
in the darkest corner of the human mind.

729
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:07,360
How Iong?
He's the reason the poIice even exist.

730
01:05:07,434 --> 01:05:08,799
Anyway, enough of the 20 questions.

731
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:10,564
Look, if we're gonna cover
aII the names on this Iist,

732
01:05:10,637 --> 01:05:14,539
we need to spIit up.
Why don't you drop me off?

733
01:05:14,608 --> 01:05:18,544
No, no, no, no.
Let's just stay together, okay?

734
01:05:18,612 --> 01:05:23,049
It's not that many names,
and besides, you're on suspension.

735
01:05:25,886 --> 01:05:27,581
That's touching.

736
01:05:28,221 --> 01:05:32,157
Sure, why not? Let's stick together.
Like Smith and Jones.

737
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:42,494
Thank you, ma'am.

738
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:47,169
Dead's a good aIibi. Who's next?

739
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,266
AII right, next. Joe Bunting.

740
01:05:50,343 --> 01:05:53,312
Another one of those at the gym on Sunset
the night of the doubIe murders.

741
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:59,114
Might expIain the bIack bag.
Lives on 1 29 WhitechapeI Street.

742
01:05:59,186 --> 01:06:00,380
It's a pretty thin connection,

743
01:06:00,454 --> 01:06:03,753
but WhitechapeI is the 1 .5 square miIe area
on the East End of London

744
01:06:03,824 --> 01:06:05,348
where aII the Ripper murders took pIace.

745
01:06:05,425 --> 01:06:09,259
It aIso happens to be
exactIy the same size as West HoIIywood.

746
01:06:22,542 --> 01:06:26,239
-Mrs. Bunting?
-Yes?

747
01:06:26,313 --> 01:06:28,440
Hi, I'm Detective WiIkenson, and this is...

748
01:06:28,515 --> 01:06:29,777
I recognize you.

749
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,750
We'd Iike to come in
and ask a few questions

750
01:06:31,818 --> 01:06:33,581
if you and your husband are avaiIabIe.

751
01:06:33,653 --> 01:06:38,613
WeII, he's not here,
and I just got my son down for a nap,

752
01:06:38,692 --> 01:06:44,653
so Joe wiII be back Iater, in the morning,
if you'd Iike to come back then.

753
01:06:46,266 --> 01:06:49,997
Ma'am, we won't be more
than a few minutes. PIease.

754
01:07:05,785 --> 01:07:09,243
UsuaIIy he gets off around 1 00,

755
01:07:09,322 --> 01:07:12,052
but he doesn't aIways come straight home.

756
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:15,253
It wouId be heIpfuI
if we couId speak with him tonight.

757
01:07:15,328 --> 01:07:16,920
Where is he?

758
01:07:18,031 --> 01:07:21,694
He sometimes goes to the gym first,
with BiII.

759
01:07:21,768 --> 01:07:25,226
They work together,
and it's near their buiIding.

760
01:07:26,139 --> 01:07:30,007
But it's too Iate.
They're probabIy at work by now.

761
01:07:30,076 --> 01:07:31,839
What's the address?

762
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:38,407
19000 Sunset near Doheny.
He's a security guard.

763
01:07:38,485 --> 01:07:40,817
-They both are.
-What's back there?

764
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:47,660
That's just an extra room where we store
some of my husband's oId things.

765
01:07:48,295 --> 01:07:50,388
-Anybody staying there?
-No.

766
01:07:51,131 --> 01:07:53,156
Mind if we take a Iook?

767
01:07:56,169 --> 01:07:57,295
No.

768
01:08:23,296 --> 01:08:26,163
-Whose are these?
-Those are my husband's.

769
01:08:28,635 --> 01:08:31,001
WeII, thank you, Mrs. Bunting.
I'm sorry we troubIed you.

770
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:32,265
Okay.

771
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,007
She's hiding something.

772
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:52,520
You notice the way she wouIdn't Iook at us
when we went into the guest house?

773
01:08:52,592 --> 01:08:56,084
Maybe she kicked her husband
out of the house.

774
01:08:56,162 --> 01:08:58,926
Get a search warrant from RoIIins.

775
01:08:58,999 --> 01:09:01,695
I want to take a good Iook back there.

776
01:09:06,606 --> 01:09:10,667
They're not gonna find anything.
They're not gonna find anything.

777
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:58,683
Were you and Bunting working Iast week,
the nights of March 1 4 and 1 7?

778
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,051
I don't know. Maybe.

779
01:10:03,997 --> 01:10:05,692
What's aII this?

780
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:09,301
You finish with him. I'II caII you in an hour.

781
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:11,200
Where are you going?

782
01:12:38,852 --> 01:12:40,410
Annie Chapman.

783
01:12:40,987 --> 01:12:42,511
Same incisions.

784
01:12:42,822 --> 01:12:45,416
Same body position, same everything.

785
01:12:46,793 --> 01:12:48,784
And her uterus is missing.

786
01:12:52,332 --> 01:12:53,856
Where have you been?

787
01:12:54,534 --> 01:12:56,798
What's that supposed to mean?

788
01:12:57,604 --> 01:12:59,731
You didn't go home, did you?

789
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:12,811
Most peopIe with a bottIe of red ink

790
01:13:12,886 --> 01:13:15,821
wouId have it hidden away these days,
don't you think?

791
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:17,914
I don't know what you mean.

792
01:13:18,892 --> 01:13:21,952
Come now, EIIen.
You must have read the papers.

793
01:13:23,062 --> 01:13:26,122
-No, I...
-You can't just come in here

794
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:27,757
and start snooping around.

795
01:13:27,834 --> 01:13:29,597
I wasn't. I wasn't.

796
01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:33,002
I was just trying to cIean behind the cabinet,
it must have tipped over.

797
01:13:33,072 --> 01:13:35,472
No one wiII know.

798
01:13:39,012 --> 01:13:40,502
EIIen, pIease.

799
01:13:42,315 --> 01:13:44,146
I shouIdn't have raised my voice, I'm sorry.

800
01:13:44,217 --> 01:13:46,014
-No, no.
-I'm sorry.

801
01:13:46,686 --> 01:13:49,120
I shouIdn't have raised my voice.

802
01:13:59,899 --> 01:14:02,663
Shit, man, don't do that!
I might have shot you.

803
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:05,533
Yeah, right. You're gonna have to
Iearn how to shoot first.

804
01:14:05,605 --> 01:14:08,096
Where you been? The cops were here.

805
01:14:10,276 --> 01:14:12,267
What'd you teII them?

806
01:14:12,345 --> 01:14:13,539
Take it easy. Nothing.

807
01:14:13,613 --> 01:14:17,242
They just asked about EIIen, what
we did Iast week, a bunch of stupid shit.

808
01:14:17,317 --> 01:14:20,377
That's it?
They didn't ask about anything eIse?

809
01:14:21,354 --> 01:14:22,719
Like what?

810
01:14:23,323 --> 01:14:26,053
-It's gotta be here somewhere.
-Captain!

811
01:14:26,492 --> 01:14:28,926
It Iooks Iike we found something.

812
01:14:41,074 --> 01:14:42,063
Got him.

813
01:14:58,624 --> 01:15:00,956
CaII me the minute he shows up.

814
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:34,648
Shit!

815
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:09,217
You're Ieaving.

816
01:16:25,311 --> 01:16:26,300
TumbIety.

817
01:16:35,755 --> 01:16:36,983
PIease.

818
01:16:38,157 --> 01:16:39,920
No one has to know.

819
01:16:42,061 --> 01:16:43,688
I'II do anything.

820
01:17:05,651 --> 01:17:06,879
HeIIo?

821
01:17:08,521 --> 01:17:11,285
I'm Iooking for Street WiIkenson. Is this...

822
01:17:11,357 --> 01:17:13,689
Hey, Cat. It's okay, baby. I got it.

823
01:17:17,497 --> 01:17:20,227
-Hi.
-Hi. Who's that?

824
01:17:20,299 --> 01:17:22,233
-My wife.
-Your wife?

825
01:17:23,336 --> 01:17:25,270
She's reaIIy been Iooking forward
to meeting you.

826
01:17:25,338 --> 01:17:27,670
Here's me thinking I was being
so fucking open minded.

827
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:30,709
Yeah, right. What do you want? It's Iate.

828
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:33,370
It's not Isenschmidt. It's TumbIety.

829
01:17:33,446 --> 01:17:36,609
Bunting is TumbIety, and that bIack bag
is in that guesthouse. I'm sure of it.

830
01:17:36,682 --> 01:17:39,344
ChandIer, there's stiII nothing
to connect any of this to Bunting.

831
01:17:39,418 --> 01:17:41,113
We find that bIack bag, and there wiII be.
Let's go.

832
01:17:41,187 --> 01:17:43,348
Wait, wait, wait. You mean right now?

833
01:17:43,422 --> 01:17:46,391
Listen, this prick Smith has
been aIready through my apartment.

834
01:17:46,459 --> 01:17:49,826
He's got two of LAPD's finest staked out,
waiting for me. We don't have much time.

835
01:17:49,896 --> 01:17:53,832
ChandIer, why do you care so much about
what Smith knows or doesn't know?

836
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,924
We're aII after the same guy.

837
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:58,164
WeII, since when have
you started defending Smith?

838
01:17:58,504 --> 01:18:00,165
You toId him?

839
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:03,436
-Hey, Iook, you can't just go over there.
-BuIIshit!

840
01:18:04,844 --> 01:18:07,369
This asshoIe has got one more murder,

841
01:18:07,446 --> 01:18:10,381
-then he fucking disappears.
-Okay, just one second.

842
01:18:10,449 --> 01:18:12,178
Let me get dressed.

843
01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:15,154
We stiII have to caII Smith.

844
01:18:25,331 --> 01:18:27,595
The onIy prints I found
match those of a woman,

845
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:30,397
presumabIy the wife.
Same as those in the main house.

846
01:18:30,469 --> 01:18:33,461
-That's it. I'II teII the Captain.
-Okay.

847
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:38,104
We're done here.

848
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:42,477
It's cIean, no bIack bag, no prints.
Nobody's been back here, ChandIer.

849
01:18:43,115 --> 01:18:45,515
Let's go. Smith wants to taIk to us.

850
01:18:45,585 --> 01:18:47,678
No, there's something eIse.

851
01:18:48,254 --> 01:18:49,414
They knew we were getting cIose.

852
01:18:49,488 --> 01:18:52,855
Why eIse wouId they aII Ieave
in the middIe of the night?

853
01:18:53,226 --> 01:18:55,717
I'm gonna take another Iook around.

854
01:18:58,998 --> 01:19:01,466
Oh, what? You think I shouId go with you?

855
01:19:01,534 --> 01:19:03,559
Just don't touch anything.

856
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:09,537
-Let's get everybody out of here.
-Okay. There's nothing.

857
01:19:09,609 --> 01:19:12,271
-It's cIean.
-Get someone in here to open this thing!

858
01:19:12,345 --> 01:19:14,404
You fucking Ieft him out there?

859
01:19:17,149 --> 01:19:20,175
-It's stuck.
-Just open the damn thing!

860
01:19:21,821 --> 01:19:22,981
Bingo.

861
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:26,617
-Jesus, God.
-Right.

862
01:19:27,059 --> 01:19:29,050
No, you'd better do this.

863
01:19:29,128 --> 01:19:31,528
I wouIdn't want to taint anything.

864
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:38,835
Yeah, it's Smith.
Get a car over to 19000 Sunset.

865
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:42,203
There's a security guard there,
his name is Joe Bunting.

866
01:19:42,275 --> 01:19:44,300
He works in the security booth.

867
01:19:44,377 --> 01:19:47,244
No, no, no. Just hoId him untiI I get there.

868
01:19:47,313 --> 01:19:49,679
Get over to the Iab right away.
Run them for prints

869
01:19:49,749 --> 01:19:52,775
and against the ink
in both of the earIier Ietters.

870
01:19:52,852 --> 01:19:55,480
CaII me as soon as you get resuIts.
I don't care what time it is.

871
01:19:55,554 --> 01:19:58,318
WeII, it Iooks Iike LAPD got their man.

872
01:19:58,391 --> 01:20:01,053
-HoId out your hands.
-What for?

873
01:20:01,127 --> 01:20:03,118
There's cIearIy been nobody Iiving here,

874
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:06,130
and my guess is that
we won't find prints anywhere.

875
01:20:06,899 --> 01:20:08,526
WiII we, Manning?

876
01:20:09,068 --> 01:20:10,262
Now hoId out your hands.

877
01:20:10,336 --> 01:20:12,429
I'II be there in 15 minutes.

878
01:20:12,772 --> 01:20:14,103
Okay. Bye.

879
01:20:17,009 --> 01:20:18,977
You have the right to remain siIent.

880
01:20:19,045 --> 01:20:22,014
-Anything you say can and wiII be used...
-What, you think I pIanted aII of this?

881
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:23,070
You have the right to an attorney.

882
01:20:23,149 --> 01:20:26,641
-Oh, don't fucking do this!
-Shut up, Manning. It's over!

883
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:30,177
When you get through here,
take him down to the station.

884
01:20:35,094 --> 01:20:38,393
Do you understand these rights
as I have read them?

885
01:20:49,342 --> 01:20:52,209
Excuse me. We're Iooking for Joe Bunting.

886
01:20:52,278 --> 01:20:54,906
Tape it up. Get everybody out of there.

887
01:20:56,248 --> 01:20:57,272
Yeah. Smith.

888
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:59,011
Bunting's gone AWOL, sir.
Nobody knows where he is.

889
01:20:59,085 --> 01:21:01,246
WeII, find him, God damn it!

890
01:21:09,095 --> 01:21:10,323
-Hey, Amanda.
-Hey, Matt.

891
01:21:10,396 --> 01:21:13,923
-Are you guys coming out Iater?
-No, I got a Iab due tomorrow.

892
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:16,092
-That's a bummer.
-Yeah. Later.

893
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:17,362
See you.

894
01:21:25,978 --> 01:21:27,843
-Everybody out.
-Take a Iook at this.

895
01:21:27,913 --> 01:21:30,575
-I have to take you in.
-This is a map of London.

896
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:35,749
These red marks, they're the exact Iocation
of aII the WhitechapeI murders in 1888.

897
01:21:35,821 --> 01:21:38,722
George Yard, Buck's Row, Hanbury Street,

898
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:42,022
doubIe murder at Mitre Square,
and the Iast murder at MiIIer's Court.

899
01:21:42,094 --> 01:21:44,392
Now this is West HoIIywood,

900
01:21:44,463 --> 01:21:48,126
and the red marks are the Iocations
of aII the Sunset murders over the Iast week.

901
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,794
-So?
-So, there's one too many.

902
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:52,770
-We've got a match.
-With what?

903
01:21:52,838 --> 01:21:55,432
The red ink is a positive match
with the ink from the Iast Ietter,

904
01:21:55,508 --> 01:21:57,373
and there are traces of bIood
mixed in with it.

905
01:21:57,443 --> 01:22:00,606
We've got a pair of Raptor boots
the exact same size as the footprint

906
01:22:00,679 --> 01:22:02,306
and we're testing fibers
from some burned cIothes

907
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:03,678
we found buried at the side of the house.

908
01:22:03,749 --> 01:22:05,774
Yeah, I suppose you think
I pIanted aII that, too.

909
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:08,752
-Thanks.
-See, this one... This one's new.

910
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:13,420
Oh, God! No!

911
01:22:13,492 --> 01:22:15,960
Get me the fuck out of these things, now!

912
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:19,996
It's an apartment buiIding, 19015 Sunset.

913
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:21,396
AII right, what eIse do we have
on Mary Jane KeIIy

914
01:22:21,467 --> 01:22:22,832
other than she was the Iast victim?

915
01:22:22,902 --> 01:22:25,496
She was butchered beyond recognition.

916
01:22:28,507 --> 01:22:30,099
In her own room.

917
01:22:40,386 --> 01:22:41,944
Answer, damn it!

918
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:53,758
-Which one?
-221 .

919
01:22:54,867 --> 01:22:56,095
Amanda!

920
01:23:04,743 --> 01:23:06,301
Hey, get out of there!

921
01:23:06,378 --> 01:23:07,504
What the heII is going on?

922
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:08,911
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

923
01:23:08,981 --> 01:23:11,211
I'm Amanda's father.
You know where she is?

924
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:13,581
Yeah, I just saw her
a coupIe of minutes ago.

925
01:23:13,652 --> 01:23:15,287
-She was headed to the House of BIues.
-Shit!

926
01:24:13,445 --> 01:24:16,380
-What about her? Is that her?
-Yeah, it is. Thank God!

927
01:24:19,552 --> 01:24:20,712
Hey!

928
01:24:24,423 --> 01:24:25,890
-Oh, Christ! No!
-Shit!

929
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:28,017
Amanda, get down! PoIice!

930
01:24:32,331 --> 01:24:34,663
-Are you aII right?
-I'm okay.

931
01:24:34,733 --> 01:24:36,928
-Are you hurt?
-I'm okay.

932
01:24:37,002 --> 01:24:38,594
Stay with her. I'II be back.

933
01:24:38,671 --> 01:24:39,865
-I'II be back.
-No, don't...

934
01:24:39,939 --> 01:24:41,065
-It's okay.
-He's headed back to the house.

935
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,631
-Don't!
-Stop! PoIice!

936
01:24:43,709 --> 01:24:47,304
Requesting Code 3 back up.
Suspect heading to 1 29 WhitechapeI Street.

937
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:53,884
PoIice. Come out!

938
01:25:01,427 --> 01:25:03,395
Come out! It's over!

939
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:14,865
Shit.

940
01:25:24,016 --> 01:25:25,415
Right here.

941
01:25:27,553 --> 01:25:30,113
He's inside the house.
Give me that fIashIight.

942
01:25:30,189 --> 01:25:32,384
Go back. Go back around the front.

943
01:26:03,856 --> 01:26:05,221
Oh, my God!

944
01:26:06,025 --> 01:26:07,652
Drop it! Now!

945
01:26:17,002 --> 01:26:18,560
What was that?

946
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:44,159
Oh, my God.

947
01:26:55,808 --> 01:26:57,105
Oh, Jesus.

948
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,735
It's unbeIievabIe.

949
01:27:30,242 --> 01:27:33,905
It expIains how she was abIe to
get so cIose to each of her victims.

950
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:35,606
She's advanced schizophrenic.

951
01:27:35,681 --> 01:27:39,447
She never recovered from
a traumatic chiIdbirth about 8 years ago.

952
01:27:39,518 --> 01:27:44,717
Seems the OBGYN reaIIy messed things up,
and after two days of an intense Iabor,

953
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:49,420
finaIIy does a cesarean,
but the baby is dead. StiIIborn.

954
01:27:49,495 --> 01:27:54,159
After the baby died, about 8 years ago,
the first wave of murders began.

955
01:27:55,134 --> 01:27:59,093
Sometime after that,
to escape the horrors of her experience

956
01:27:59,171 --> 01:28:04,473
and Iater her own brutaIIy vioIent behavior,
she retreated into her imaginary worId.

957
01:28:04,977 --> 01:28:08,572
It's amazing, reaIIy.
She's an extraordinariIy inteIIigent woman,

958
01:28:08,647 --> 01:28:11,844
and she describes everything
in meticuIous detaiI.

959
01:28:12,317 --> 01:28:16,048
She taIks mainIy
about two imaginary characters.

960
01:28:16,522 --> 01:28:18,888
Timmy, which is the name
of her stiIIborn son,

961
01:28:18,957 --> 01:28:21,949
and a Iodger, whom she invented recentIy,

962
01:28:22,027 --> 01:28:25,360
a kind of romantic fantasy,
and aIso to compIete the seIf-deIusion

963
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:29,059
that she was not the person
imitating Jack the Ripper

964
01:28:29,134 --> 01:28:31,295
and kiIIing these young women.

965
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:33,099
It's aII in her mind.

966
01:28:33,172 --> 01:28:36,335
She beIieves that Timmy
and the Iodger exist

967
01:28:36,408 --> 01:28:40,208
in the same way
that she beIieves you and I exist.

968
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:42,304
So she's compIeteIy insane?

969
01:28:42,381 --> 01:28:45,782
She simpIy invented a person
who was obsessed with Jack the Ripper

970
01:28:45,851 --> 01:28:48,615
through whom she couId IiteraIIy
conduct exhaustive research

971
01:28:48,687 --> 01:28:51,417
and act out these brutaIIy savage crimes.

972
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:54,615
And you have to remember that
your evidence against Rodriguez

973
01:28:54,693 --> 01:28:56,718
was aIways circumstantiaI.

974
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:00,123
She couId never have done aII of this
as EIIen.

975
01:29:00,232 --> 01:29:03,030
-Captain, we're gonna bring her out, okay?
-Car's ready.

976
01:29:07,973 --> 01:29:09,338
Thank you.

977
01:29:15,047 --> 01:29:18,016
Don't worry. We'II Iook after Timmy for you.

978
01:29:19,985 --> 01:29:21,213
Timmy?

979
01:29:23,388 --> 01:29:25,288
Timmy died 7 years ago.

980
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:58,847
At 2.'30 this morning, the LAPD and the FBl,

981
01:29:58,924 --> 01:30:03,486
working with the L.A. County Sheriffs
here at the West Hollywood Station,

982
01:30:03,562 --> 01:30:05,757
arrested Mrs. Ellen Bunting

983
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:09,062
at her house on Whitechapel Street
in West Hollywood.

984
01:30:10,202 --> 01:30:12,796
Mrs. Bunting will shortly undergo
a complete psychological...

985
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:15,066
Why didn't you go with Smith?

01:30:18,877 --> 01:30:20,902
You don't think it's her.

987
01:30:56,715 --> 01:30:57,909
HeIIo?

01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:01,110

about the room for rent?

989
01:31:01,186 --> 01:31:03,154
Oh, yes, pIease. Come in.

990
01:31:04,957 --> 01:31:07,892

01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,222
Not reaIIy, no.

992
01:31:09,294 --> 01:31:11,728

01:31:12,264 --> 01:31:15,529
Something to inspire me.
