1
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:05,507
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,777
(whooshing)
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:23,758
(eerie music)

4
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:49,383
(dramatic music)

5
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:33,561
(fingers cracking)

6
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:36,430
(dramatic music)

7
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,740
(people chattering)
(gentle music)

8
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,815
(traffic humming)
(gentle music)

9
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:23,938
(people chattering)
(gentle music)

10
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,642
Sorry.

11
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:32,680
(traffic humming)
(gentle music)

12
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,349
Excuse me.

13
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:45,853
Sorry to bother you.

14
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,454
Yes?
- I'm lost.

15
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,524
It's my first time in New York,
actually.

16
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,693
I never rode a subway before.

17
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:53,828
I got a little too excited

18
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,105
when they announced Times
Square.

19
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,799
So, I jumped off,
but left my bag behind.

20
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:01,368
Had my phone, wallet,
everything in it.

21
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,370
Wasn't even my stop.

22
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,006
I don't have any money, sorry.

23
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,041
Oh, God, no, I don't need money.

24
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,378
Actually, my ATM card, it's at
the hotel, with my computer,

25
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,816
so I can do the whole "Find
my Phone" when I get back.

26
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,717
You know, the Cloud?

27
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,352
What do you need?

28
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,387
Right.

29
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,388
Can you help me?

30
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,961
First time in New York, huh?

31
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:27,994
Yeah.

32
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,832
More like, first time out of
the house.

33
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,033
You need the East Side.

34
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,701
Can I get there walking?

35
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,669
Or light jogging.

36
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,403
I don't know your rhythm.

37
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,981
(chuckles) That's called
mall walking, where I'm from.

38
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,508
(chuckles) It's, like, huge in
my town.

39
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,543
Where you from, 1985?

40
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:43,511
(he chuckles)

41
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,544
You're funny.

42
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,716
You do that dry wit thing.

43
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:49,750
Very New York.

44
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,721
Go four blocks east
and you'll hit it, okay?

45
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,691
And which way is east?

46
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:58,759
Kidding.

47
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:01,762
I do dry wit, too. (chuckles)

48
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,007
I'm not a complete idiot.

49
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,843
I needed your help.

50
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,554
You gave that to me, and
for that I thank you,

51
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,649
but I never would've asked
if you weren't so beautiful.

52
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,551
I mean, is that okay to say?

53
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,862
I don't mean it, like,
offensively.

54
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,088
I'm not objectifying you, I'm
just saying

55
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,959
it was a pleasure to
receive your directions.

56
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,428
Thought you should know.

57
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:38,732
Heading east now.

58
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,969
(gentle music)

59
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:43,771
Hey, mall walker?

60
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:44,804
Uh.

61
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Joshua.

62
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:49,810
You'll get lost.

63
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,145
I'll show you.

64
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,713
Really?

65
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:53,747
Oh, thanks.

66
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,018
What's your name?

67
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,754
(gentle music)

68
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,629
Haven't decided yet.

69
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,033
Dry wit. (chuckles)

70
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,869
(dramatic music)

71
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,720
I, I, I, I, I think that's east.

72
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:41,128
(people chattering)
(traffic humming)

73
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,997
I'm Veronica.

74
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,198
I live upstairs.

75
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:46,934
Wanna come up?

76
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:47,968
[Joshua] Yes.

77
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,204
Don't make me regret it.

78
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:59,880
(soft dramatic music)
(people chattering)

79
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:26,073
(ominous music)

80
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,927
(dramatic music)

81
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,961
Want a drink?

82
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:23,096
Sure.

83
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,001
You have any pop?

84
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,037
Soda.

85
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,841
Where I'm from we call it pop.

86
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:38,879
Or is that illegal here?

87
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,250
Didn't New York pass a ban?

88
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,688
Or was that just Biggie size?
(chuckles)

89
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:48,823
I have alcohol.

90
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,227
Would you like alcohol or
should I get you a juice box?

91
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,962
Alcohol is fine.

92
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,063
I drink.

93
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:58,799
(gentle music)

94
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:05,339
So you live in a hotel?

95
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:08,843
My family owned the unit
when it was residential.

96
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,846
They can never kick me out.

97
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:15,816
Perks of being a true New
Yorker.

98
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,852
It's a really cool place.

99
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,855
Like, vintage, huh?

100
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,323
(dramatic music)

101
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,356
I mean, it's not dirty or
anything, just looks old.

102
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,961
Lived in. (chuckles)

103
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,395
(dramatic music)

104
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,030
Your place has character.

105
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Sit down.

106
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,709
You like whiskey?

107
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,277
I like everything,

108
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,312
except watermelon and cucumber.

109
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,982
But that's not what's happening
right now.

110
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,151
What's happening right now is
whiskey.

111
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:52,886
With you.

112
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,021
Veronica.

113
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,293
Cheers.

114
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,161
(glasses clink)

115
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,194
Cheers.

116
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,434
(she gulps)

117
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,414
(she sighs)

118
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:22,716
Get up.

119
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,285
We're gonna do it on the table?

120
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:26,220
(slapping)

121
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,253
I said,

122
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,124
"Get up."

123
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,092
Walk.

124
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,931
(dramatic music)

125
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:37,964
Move!

126
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:40,867
Up!

127
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,905
(dramatic music)

128
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,459
We can't have sex if you don't
want to.

129
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,861
I do, it's just so much right
now.

130
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,497
(slapping)

131
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:13,334
(dramatic music)

132
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,543
(she chuckles)

133
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:24,878
It helps if you really get in
there.

134
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,481
(dramatic music)

135
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:29,984
(she laughs)

136
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,318
Are you a virgin?

137
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,090
You're pathetic.

138
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,260
Ah, the shirt stays on.

139
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,130
Get on the bed.

140
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,966
(dramatic music)

141
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,877
(ominous music)

142
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,824
(he groans)

143
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,993
(ominous music)

144
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:14,361
(he gasps)

145
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:17,498
(ominous music)

146
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:18,465
(he coughs)

147
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:21,235
(ominous music)

148
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,878
(he screams)

149
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,451
(he gasps)

150
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,220
(ominous music)

151
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,898
(eerie music)

152
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:55,069
(buzzing)

153
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,416
Hello?

154
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:13,486
Hey.

155
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:17,658
Hello?

156
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:31,305
Junk mail?

157
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:34,241
I swear, I get about 20
pounds of this shit a year.

158
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:38,979
And I get a ticket if I don't
recycle, but this is okay.

159
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,448
I need to get going.

160
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:47,087
A flyer for an antique
mall in Rhinebeck. (chuckles)

161
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:48,455
Where the fuck is Rhinebeck?

162
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:52,359
Like I said, I need to get
going.

163
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:58,132
- Remind me?
- 800.

164
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,502
[Joshua] She's all business.

165
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,305
No wallet?

166
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:11,245
[Joshua] I left it on the
train with my cell and my bag.

167
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,516
But your ATM card is at the
hotel

168
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,117
and your computer can "Find
Your Phone."

169
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,620
You remembered.

170
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,120
It's part of the job.

171
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,357
Well, that's nice.

172
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,390
Thanks.

173
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,999
Well, it was a pleasure to meet
you

174
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,436
and do that.

175
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,706
Okay.

176
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,141
You know, it only
happens, like, once a year,

177
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:44,478
for my birthday, which
is today. (chuckles)

178
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:46,280
It's good to treat yourself.

179
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,315
So, I guess that makes you my
present.

180
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:51,351
I'm not a present.

181
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,287
I'm a person.

182
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,190
Oh, yeah, of course, I
didn't mean it like that.

183
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,693
(dramatic music)

184
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:00,294
Now, I'm very sorry.

185
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,397
(dramatic music)

186
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,498
I thought it was you.

187
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,267
Oh, my God.

188
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,337
I don't feel so good.

189
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,173
(dramatic music)

190
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,745
(ghostly voice mumbles)

191
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,482
(he retches)

192
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:27,087
(ghostly voice mumbles)

193
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,556
(woman groans)

194
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,592
(woman screams)

195
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,125
(he coughs)

196
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,060
I'll call 911.

197
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,161
It'll pass.

198
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,563
- You need a doctor.
- I don't.

199
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:36,698
Go!

200
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:38,566
Your eyes are fucking bleeding!

201
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,601
All right.

202
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:44,037
(ghostly voice mumbles)

203
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:44,739
Finally.

204
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:47,107
(ghostly voice mumbles)

205
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,543
[Veronica] Joshua.

206
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:51,345
(ominous music)

207
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:33,387
(ominous music)

208
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,257
You stayed.

209
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,863
How are you feeling?

210
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,463
Like I'm levitating.

211
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,300
Are these tarps?

212
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,435
It's all I could find.

213
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,737
You an outdoorsy dude?

214
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:53,575
No, I had the walls done.

215
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,208
The painter left them behind.

216
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,244
Lucky me.

217
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,750
Oh, I hope you don't
mind, I made some tea.

218
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,820
I think this it's mint.

219
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,855
It's the only scent I
recognized.

220
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:10,657
Want a cup?

221
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:13,828
Not now.

222
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,429
I take some of that water,
though.

223
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,333
(ice cubes clinking)

224
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,538
[Veronica] Be careful.

225
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:26,340
(ominous music)

226
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,209
For my homies.

227
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,746
(ominous music)

228
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:40,888
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
didn't you just choke me out,

229
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:42,790
punch me...

230
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:43,925
[Veronica] I did.

231
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,292
Judge my boner...

232
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,460
Or lack thereof.

233
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:47,862
This the same girl?

234
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:50,565
(she chuckles)

235
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:54,869
You know, I appreciate it, I
really do.

236
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,273
You shouldn't have stayed.
(sniffles)

237
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,577
It's not every day you see
blood gushing

238
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,579
from a man's eyes.

239
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:06,581
I wanna see how this ends.

240
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:07,481
You will.

241
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:09,483
(ominous music)

242
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:10,652
(he groans)

243
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:12,520
I have some aspirin in my purse.

244
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:14,789
Uh...

245
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,456
Another whiskey'd be better.

246
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,793
When you can get up on
your own, I'll pour you some.

247
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:21,428
(laughs) So, what do we do now?

248
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:23,765
[Veronica] I could read to you?

249
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:27,200
Uh, it's mostly historical
books, biographies.

250
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,806
(he sighs)

251
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,341
And "Anne of Green Gables"?

252
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:38,546
What can I say?

253
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,280
I love a red-headed orphan.

254
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,983
(she chuckles)

255
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:44,484
There's an Annie poster
around here, somewhere.

256
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,485
Or not.

257
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,257
The mind's a little fuzzy right
now.

258
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,225
Eyes of blood and such.

259
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,393
(ominous music)

260
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:54,562
Yeah.

261
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,597
What was that about?
(ominous music)

262
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:59,433
An allergic reaction, to the
saffron.

263
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:01,769
Huh?

264
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:03,871
The stuff you put in my drink.

265
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:06,306
I didn't tell you what it was?

266
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,709
No.

267
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:11,579
Your message said find the
vial behind the whiskey

268
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,213
and pour it in your drink.

269
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,651
What did you think it was?

270
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:18,452
Not saffron.

271
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,822
It's an organic aphrodisiac.

272
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:24,391
Oh, well, if it's organic.

273
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,727
I won't take Viagra.

274
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,328
It's like admitting you're
officially old.

275
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,361
How old are you?

276
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,364
400.

277
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,033
(dramatic music)

278
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,500
What?

279
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:34,702
40.

280
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:38,371
Feels like 400. (chuckles)

281
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,406
Oh, that's right.

282
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,475
Erm, happy birthday.
- Oh.

283
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:43,243
Please, don't, it's too
depressing.

284
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:48,381
Can I have that whiskey now?

285
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,349
Can you get up?

286
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,492
No. (chuckles)

287
00:20:58,526 --> 00:20:59,861
Next question.

288
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:00,995
(gentle music)

289
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:02,028
Oh.

290
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:04,532
(she sighs)

291
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:05,933
I don't know.

292
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,770
Well, here's your chance
to ask a John anything.

293
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:09,803
Client.

294
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:12,774
"John" feels too anonymous.

295
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:16,476
We wanna be anonymous.

296
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:17,712
You can trust me.

297
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,882
I'm the keeper of many secrets.

298
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:22,049
(ominous music)

299
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,052
Wow, you sound like a sexy
wizard.

300
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,990
Comic book culture has opened
up an entirely new market

301
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:30,525
to me.

302
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:32,035
(chuckles) They save
up all their IT bucks

303
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,962
to fuck a lady warrior?

304
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:36,463
Or damsel.

305
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,565
Depends on the guy.

306
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,502
Mainly, they wanna show
me their collections

307
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:43,571
and play with my tits.

308
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:45,673
They're sweet.

309
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:47,775
They ask if I'm okay.

310
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,677
Do we need a safe word?

311
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,778
Do I want a drink?

312
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,014
Oh, like this?

313
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:54,782
Did we have a safe word?

314
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,950
It's whiskey.

315
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,486
Please, geeks and dragons?

316
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,621
I have earned it.

317
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,456
Okay.

318
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,492
But I'm cutting it with water.

319
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:08,796
All right.

320
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,064
You're the boss.

321
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:12,399
[Veronica] Ah.

322
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:15,002
(dramatic music)

323
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,876
(speaking foreign language)

324
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:24,745
(dramatic music)

325
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:29,116
(speaking foreign language)

326
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,953
(dramatic music)

327
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:34,601
(speaking foreign language)

328
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:38,059
(speaking foreign language)

329
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:40,895
(dramatic music)

330
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:46,027
(ominous music)

331
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:59,006
[Veronica] Don't chug
it like an asshole.

332
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:08,015
- Cheers.
- Never cheer twice

333
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,517
in the same day.

334
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,818
It disrespects the gods.

335
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,020
You're fucking with me.

336
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:14,689
Numerology?

337
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,489
Oh, God.

338
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:18,893
Numbers play a huge part in
our lives.

339
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:21,729
Who are you, a mere
mortal, to praise yourself?

340
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:22,964
You're not a creator.

341
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:24,265
You're a creation.

342
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:25,298
Know your place.

343
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:30,972
(she laughs)

344
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,807
I'm totally fucking with you,
man.

345
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:37,712
(glass clink)

346
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:42,116
Are you an "aliens are real" and

347
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:45,653
"we have twins in an alternate
universe" kind of gal?

348
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:46,787
Aliens are real.

349
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:47,755
I've seen the footage.

350
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:48,856
[Joshua] Okay.

351
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,191
But, no, to twinsies.

352
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:54,295
I do think we have multiple
souls in our bodies, though.

353
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,162
Cool.

354
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:55,997
Thanks for the sip.

355
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,964
Bye.

356
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:57,965
(chuckles) No.

357
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:01,535
Not me per se, it's just...

358
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:02,569
I don't know.

359
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:06,640
You believe in reincarnation?

360
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:08,042
Yes.

361
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,744
It's like that.

362
00:25:09,777 --> 00:25:11,188
We're born with different parts
of souls

363
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:13,547
that make up our personalities.

364
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:17,018
That's where instinct, deja vù,

365
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:18,853
things like that come from.

366
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:21,789
So, if I have a mood swing,

367
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:25,860
it's a dormant soul wanting
his "me" time? (chuckles)

368
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:30,898
Or if I think I've met you
before, I actually have,

369
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:35,703
400 years ago, at a
primitive family reunion?

370
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:36,904
Never mind.

371
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:37,937
You don't get it.

372
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:40,174
(dramatic music)
- Oh, I get it.

373
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:44,645
But I believe, no matter how
many souls we might have,

374
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:46,680
we are born with a singular
vision.

375
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,717
And when we find out what that
is,

376
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,187
nothing and no one can stop us.

377
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
Wanna hear mine?

378
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:57,892
Sure.

379
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:59,894
To finish this drink!

380
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:02,229
(he laughs)

381
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:03,931
You're fuckin' weird, dude.

382
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:06,700
Coming from the chick with
extra souls in her, great.

383
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:10,638
(dramatic music)

384
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,740
What's with the red tubs in
your fridge?

385
00:26:13,808 --> 00:26:14,875
Blood.

386
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:15,909
Duh.

387
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:19,346
It's beet juice.

388
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,049
Well, beet juice and kale
and some other bullshit.

389
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,317
Vitamin crap.

390
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,952
You on a juice cleanse?

391
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:25,820
Nah.

392
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:27,354
I hate food.

393
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:31,725
Like, the actual selecting
and chewing and cooking of it.

394
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,869
If I could take a pill, I would,

395
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:36,297
but I can't, so I drink my
meals.

396
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:41,202
So, you're saying you don't eat?

397
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:42,803
Not if I can help it.

398
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:45,272
The only solid food I like is
popcorn.

399
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:46,349
Yeah, that was in there, too.

400
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:47,708
Yeah.

401
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:49,110
When it's cold it lasts longer.

402
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,679
Plus, I don't even have
the dishes to make a meal.

403
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:53,881
(he chuckles)

404
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:56,183
Maybe that's why your eyes bled.

405
00:26:56,217 --> 00:26:57,918
You need to fucking eat.

406
00:26:57,952 --> 00:27:01,722
I know what my body
needs, thank you very much.

407
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,190
Solid food is not one of them.

408
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:12,433
What?

409
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,168
I need to ask you something.

410
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,402
(she sighs)

411
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:17,838
We're having a good time, right?

412
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:19,140
Sure.

413
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:21,742
Let that be enough.

414
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:22,775
Okay.

415
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:26,981
Nah, I'm still asking.
(chuckles)

416
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:28,782
And, here, I thought you were
different.

417
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:29,993
You don't know what I'm gonna
say.

418
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:31,385
Sure, I do.

419
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:34,121
The same thing they all
ask: "Why do you do this?

420
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:35,689
"Why are you a sex worker?

421
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:36,991
"Let me help you."

422
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:39,026
I hear this bullshit all the
time.

423
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,729
- Dudes are concerned.
- No, they're not.

424
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:43,006
They had the best sex in their
lives

425
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,241
and they don't wanna keep
paying for it.

426
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:45,966
Mm, good point.

427
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,145
So they think they're
thoughtful with their kind words

428
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:49,946
and somehow they're gonna
make me their girlfriend.

429
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,405
Or maybe not their girlfriend

430
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:54,942
but certainly a woman that
waits by the phone longing

431
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:56,410
for their compassionate cock.

432
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:57,811
(he chuckles)

433
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,055
Because that's what every woman
wants,

434
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,714
to be valued by a man.

435
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,851
I do it for the money.

436
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:06,854
I like nice things. (sighs)

437
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,422
Why you like getting choked?

438
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:11,926
(dramatic music)

439
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,861
I like to disconnect.

440
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:15,162
It feels better when I cum.

441
00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:18,866
You think love is overrated?

442
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:19,899
Love?

443
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:21,935
No.

444
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:23,337
Sex?

445
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,205
Yes.

446
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:25,239
- Really?
- Sure.

447
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:27,408
It's an activity, nothing more.

448
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:29,343
Uh, like, mall walking?

449
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:34,114
No, (chuckles) like crocheting.

450
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:35,716
- Huh?
- Think about it.

451
00:28:36,551 --> 00:28:39,820
You do all this work with
the knots and the hooks,

452
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:42,289
building up your stitches,
and the closer you get,

453
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:43,991
the more excited you become.

454
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:46,293
And you work harder and faster,

455
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:49,063
and when you finish,
you have this priceless,

456
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:51,198
one of a kind experience you
created.

457
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:55,069
And then you move on to your
next bag.

458
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:56,237
That's all sex is.

459
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,371
It's not love.

460
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,906
It's a hobby.

461
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:00,975
So, making love, you
don't like that, either?

462
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:02,309
Mm.

463
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,245
Ugh, I hate that phrase.

464
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:05,279
It creeps me out.

465
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:07,114
"Celestial" does it for me.

466
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:09,149
Ugh, what a wet word.

467
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:10,351
"Celestial."

468
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:12,019
Ugh, gross!

469
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,087
(she laughs)

470
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,255
You're an idiot.

471
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,056
Making love is a beautiful
thing.

472
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,792
It turns an orgasm into an
obligation.

473
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,095
Save the love for the important
stuff.

474
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:23,797
Hey, now, sex is important.

475
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:25,399
So is exercise.

476
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,167
And voting.

477
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,370
And eating solid foods.

478
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:31,071
But to truly love someone?

479
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:34,842
That's not sex.

480
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,244
(dramatic music)

481
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:43,484
The only person I ever
loved was my grandma.

482
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:47,454
And you?

483
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:49,990
It's obvious the true love
of your life is your mother.

484
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:53,227
Most men, it's the same thing.

485
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,830
I take away their power,
make them feel inadequate

486
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,000
and punish them for being bad
boys.

487
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:02,279
Because their first crush was
mommy

488
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,004
and they hate themselves for it.

489
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:07,017
We fall in love with
the people who raise us.

490
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,208
And we should.

491
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:09,910
But don't let that cloud your
desires

492
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:12,413
because you were taught sex
equals love.

493
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:14,014
It doesn't.

494
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:16,250
Maybe that's the case
with your dragon dudes,

495
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:18,185
but I don't wanna fuck my
mother.

496
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:20,020
(dramatic music)
I want to save her.

497
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:21,322
(knocking on door)

498
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:23,525
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
offend you.

499
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:26,226
Yeah, well, it's been an
unexpected day.

500
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,161
(knocking on door)

501
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:28,329
Wait!

502
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:29,597
(dramatic music)

503
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:31,398
I should go.

504
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:32,466
(dramatic music)

505
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,901
[Joshua] I'll be right back.

506
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:36,504
(dramatic music)

507
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:40,908
You're too early!

508
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:42,544
I wrote it down in the book.

509
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:44,011
Two o'clock.

510
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:48,982
(ominous music)
(ghostly voices mumbling)

511
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:10,471
(Veronica screams)

512
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:12,906
I told you I'd be right back!

513
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,209
(thudding)

514
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:18,045
(dramatic music)

515
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,483
(creature growling)

516
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,604
(woman screaming in the
distance)

517
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:48,075
(she snorts)

518
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:48,942
(he chuckles)

519
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:49,976
I'm that boring?

520
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:52,614
What's going on?

521
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:53,480
You tell me.

522
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:55,082
You fell asleep.

523
00:31:55,115 --> 00:31:58,385
(dramatic music)

524
00:31:58,419 --> 00:31:59,621
I mean, I get it.

525
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:03,023
Dudes talk about mom, chicks
check out.

526
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:05,159
But full on dream time?

527
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:06,192
Ouch!

528
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:10,164
(ghostly voice mumbling)

529
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:11,331
Someone else was here.

530
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,602
Yeah, my aunt.

531
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:15,676
She thought I was at work.

532
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:16,703
She let herself in.

533
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:21,275
She went on vacation and
borrowed my suitcase.

534
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,145
But I heard yelling.

535
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:27,014
I'm sure you did.

536
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,282
I used this suitcase once.

537
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:31,051
It's got fucking bag lady wear
and tear.

538
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:33,555
There was yelling, for sure.

539
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:35,489
(dramatic music)

540
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:36,691
No.

541
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:39,393
Someone else was here in this
room.

542
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,161
Just us.

543
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:42,530
I don't even have a roommate.

544
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,332
Was it the numerology gods?

545
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:46,500
Ooh.

546
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:49,336
(dramatic music)

547
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:54,007
(ghostly voice mumbles)

548
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,442
You hear that?

549
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:58,245
(woman screams)

550
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,618
(ghostly voice mumbles)

551
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:08,656
It's me.

552
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,758
Well, not me, my favorite show.

553
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,461
Favorite's pushing it,
but I love true crime.

554
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:18,800
I'm watching "Second Marriage
Murders."

555
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,434
What?

556
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,169
I didn't wanna wake you.

557
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:24,304
Guess I gave you nightmares
instead.

558
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:25,439
(ghostly voices mumbling)

559
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,472
Sorry.

560
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:32,379
I also like "Housewife
Horrors," "Killer Nurses,"

561
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:34,114
most reenactment shows.

562
00:33:34,782 --> 00:33:36,450
Usually, the man is up to no
good

563
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,452
and the woman's out for revenge.

564
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:42,524
I'm stuck in a black
widow spiral right now.

565
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:45,192
I'm watching one where
this guy gets slaughtered

566
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:49,296
by three sisters over his
lottery ticket. (chuckles)

567
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:50,329
Yikes!

568
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,399
Wanna see?

569
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:54,802
No.

570
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:55,836
It's best I probably go.

571
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,472
One more drink?

572
00:33:58,506 --> 00:33:59,506
For scaring you?

573
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:02,576
Please?

574
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:08,650
A quick one.

575
00:34:09,784 --> 00:34:10,818
Only kind I like.

576
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:18,358
(ghostly voices mumbling)

577
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,462
These sisters are crazy.

578
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:25,533
(rumbling)

579
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,106
(ominous music)

580
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:57,832
I'll take five bucks for it.

581
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:58,700
Oh, fuck!

582
00:34:58,733 --> 00:34:59,834
You scared me.

583
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,513
[Joshua] I need to stop doing
that.

584
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:05,873
(glasses clink)

585
00:35:05,907 --> 00:35:07,742
I'll stick with the tea.

586
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:09,209
Hmm, more for me.

587
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:22,456
Uh, you want the chair?

588
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:23,357
Oh, no.

589
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,225
I prefer this.

590
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,766
What's so hot about down there?

591
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,635
It's more authentic.

592
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:35,703
Makes me feel like I'm part of
the space.

593
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,305
Join me.

594
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,709
On the floor?

595
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:46,480
Yeah, may sound hippydippy,
but connecting with the base

596
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:48,683
of your home is a refreshing
perspective.

597
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:51,385
When we became land animals,

598
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:53,621
we used the ground for
everything we needed.

599
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:57,525
We didn't start out on chairs
and beds.

600
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,528
And then shoes were invented.

601
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:04,364
I blame shoes for the
downfall of humanity.

602
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:07,401
You know, if our feet can't
sense danger,

603
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:09,369
how do we know when it's coming?

604
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:10,772
You lost me at hippydippy.

605
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,641
Oh, there's that New
York wit. (chuckles)

606
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:16,511
(dramatic music)

607
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:20,480
Lots of exciting things
coming off this floor.

608
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:21,515
I know.

609
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:25,819
Thoughts,

610
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:28,355
vibrations,

611
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:31,291
popcorn.

612
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:33,528
(crunching)
Oh.

613
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:35,530
(she chuckles)

614
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:39,534
So, I understood about

615
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:42,369
none of what you just said.

616
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:44,672
It happens.

617
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,874
But the bare feet thing, I
get it.

618
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:48,843
Aaow!

619
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,878
(she chuckles)

620
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:52,589
When I was a kid, my
grandma had a birthday

621
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:54,414
at a roller rink.

622
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:55,817
We lived for an all-skate.

623
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,452
Your grandma skated with you?

624
00:36:58,485 --> 00:36:59,821
Of course.

625
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:01,923
She was legendary.

626
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:04,659
Well, I was pretty good, too,
with the tricks and turns.

627
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,293
I mean, we were at the rink all
the time.

628
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:07,762
She taught me everything.

629
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:10,263
But I wanted to do something
special:

630
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:13,300
an original skate, just for her.

631
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,333
Aw.

632
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:19,607
But I didn't own any skates.

633
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,810
I rented from the rink, so
the practice I had to do

634
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:24,478
with them bare feet.

635
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:29,050
This is where I support your
theory.

636
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,786
Am I ready for this?
(chuckles)

637
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:40,895
This motion will work easy on
a wheel.

638
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:46,601
Throw in some arms and a
shoulder.

639
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:50,370
(gentle music)

640
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:53,674
How about a sleeping prayer?

641
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:54,575
(she chuckles)

642
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:55,743
(gentle music)

643
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:57,545
I was looking tight.

644
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,481
And when the party came, skates
went on.

645
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,985
It looked more like this.

646
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:06,419
Mm, ah, ah, huh.
(he laughs)

647
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,488
The skates fucked up my show!

648
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:09,824
Grandma didn't care.

649
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:12,492
She said it was the best
rolling she'd ever seen.

650
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:15,428
(he laughs)

651
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:16,463
I miss her.

652
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:17,708
[Joshua] Teach me the routine.

653
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:19,967
(gentle music)

654
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:23,436
Do you have the strength to
fake-skate?

655
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,906
[Joshua] I do, I do.

656
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:25,907
How's your balance?

657
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,642
Oh, I can do tree pose.

658
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:30,011
Sort of.
(both chuckle)

659
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,879
I'll only teach you the chorus.

660
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,681
The verses are too experimental.

661
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:35,683
Ready?

662
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,552
Yes.

663
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,320
Ah, it was to Grandma's
favorite song, "It Had To Be You."

664
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:45,693
♪ It had to be you ♪

665
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:50,430

(she coughs)

687
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,944
(she gasps)

688
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:19,452
That wasn't tea.

689
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:21,756
(she gasps)

690
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:37,104
(dramatic music)

691
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:09,704
(ghostly voice growls)

692
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:20,047
Stay calm.

693
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:22,183
I'm not gonna hurt you.

694
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:26,821
What's happening?

695
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:29,090
I don't wanna say.

696
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:30,558
Help me.

697
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:32,626
This isn't your house!

698
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,630
Who makes tea without asking?
(sniffles)

699
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:39,900
I knew when you said mint,
you used my Carolina jasmine,

700
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:42,970
which is an herb, not
a tea, that causes...

701
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:44,772
Well, you know, this!

702
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:45,906
I can't let you go now.

703
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:48,909
You're a liar.

704
00:41:48,943 --> 00:41:50,745
And a tattletale.

705
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:52,980
People can't know about me.

706
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:54,749
[Veronica] I won't tell.

707
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:56,650
You ratted out the dorks who
pay you

708
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:58,786
to treat them like dragon
slayers.

709
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,955
You tell some John about me...

710
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:03,024
Sorry, client, eh, eh, eh...

711
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:05,860
Before you know it, I'm
all over social media.

712
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:07,728
Doesn't work like that.

713
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:10,598
Well, you'd know, you fucking
gossip!

714
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:13,200
(dramatic music)

715
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:17,271
When you can move on
your own, he'll start.

716
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:22,610
I won't let him hurt you like
this.

717
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:26,280
(dramatic music)

718
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,053
I'm giving you to my dad.

719
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:34,889
(dramatic music)

720
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:41,729
(ominous music)

721
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:02,249
(Joshua snores)

722
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:21,735
(dramatic music)

723
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:27,408
(gasps) Let's use the tarps!

724
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,276
That was a great idea.

725
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:39,186
I get to help you now.

726
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:48,129
I hate owing people.

727
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:50,364
That's been my whole life.

728
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:53,200
(dramatic music)

729
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:40,814
(ominous music)

730
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:52,927
(Veronica pants)
(dramatic music)

731
00:45:03,037 --> 00:45:04,872
Take a little.

732
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:05,940
For the nerves.

733
00:45:07,408 --> 00:45:08,408
Helps mine.

734
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:12,779
Oh, oh.

735
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:14,448
Waste not want not.

736
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:20,888
For when you feel better.

737
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:23,490
(dramatic music)

738
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:44,478
You were gonna drug me again.

739
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:47,314
(dramatic music)

740
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:56,090
Saw where I kept my money and
rob me.

741
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:00,227
After this great conversations?

742
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:02,296
The things I shared with you?

743
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,900
I have feelings, too, you know.

744
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,135
So do I.

745
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:09,403
We're not talking about you!

746
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:11,171
We're talking about me!

747
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,843
I paid you for a wish.

748
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:18,445
You drug me.

749
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:20,247
You choke me.

750
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:21,315
You leave.

751
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,286
(weeps) The saffron was gonna
kill me.

752
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:28,255
You don't stay.

753
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:29,290
You leave.

754
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:31,891
Why did you stay?

755
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:33,994
Sorry.

756
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:35,829
This is your fault!

757
00:46:35,863 --> 00:46:37,464
(he grunts)

758
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:38,498
Let me go.

759
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:42,036
(sniffles) I can't.

760
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:44,506
Oh, I want to, but I can't.

761
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:46,240
Yes, you can.

762
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:48,576
It's him, Veronica.

763
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,910
It isn't me.

764
00:46:49,943 --> 00:46:52,446
(ominous music)

765
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:00,220
I don't want to tell her.

766
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:03,123
I don't want her to know.

767
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:05,426
Don't make me say it!

768
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:08,228
(ominous music)

769
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:13,967
I'm an abomination.

770
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:18,238
My mother lived a long time ago.

771
00:47:21,442 --> 00:47:24,211
To the people in her
village, she was a mystic,

772
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:28,948
a seer,

773
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:31,485
a healer.

774
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,556
(dramatic music)

775
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:36,190
(sobs) She was so lonely.

776
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:39,527
No man would have her.

777
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:42,530
(dramatic music)

778
00:47:42,564 --> 00:47:44,998
The kind of power she held,

779
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:50,104
it welcomed darkness into her
life.

780
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:52,940
(dramatic music)

781
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,645
What's more dangerous than
thinking you're a god?

782
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,382
Shoes.

783
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:02,584
Yes!

784
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:04,118
Fuck shoes!

785
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,687
Get right with the earth!

786
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,489
(dramatic music)

787
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:12,627
(sobs) I wish we met under
different circumstances.

788
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,629
We could've been great friends.

789
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:17,164
We still can.

790
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,100
Are you even listening?

791
00:48:21,669 --> 00:48:25,005
Your lies don't work on me.

792
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:28,142
When I tell you I have seen it
all,

793
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:31,945
I have fucking seen it all.

794
00:48:31,979 --> 00:48:34,549
(dramatic music)

795
00:48:39,186 --> 00:48:40,220
I can't die.

796
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:43,056
(dramatic music)

797
00:48:47,629 --> 00:48:49,564
May I continue, please?

798
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:53,033
All my mother wanted was a
child.

799
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:56,538
So she called him Madua
Muz, an evil water spirit.

800
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,509
But tomato, tomatoe.

801
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:02,976
(dramatic music)

802
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,612
Okay, okay!

803
00:49:04,646 --> 00:49:06,180
No more jokes!

804
00:49:07,582 --> 00:49:09,049
I'll finish the story.

805
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:13,187
He gave my mother me.

806
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:19,426
And, in exchange, she promised
to give him a sacrifice

807
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,063
for every year he allowed me to
live.

808
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:31,338
I was born from the water where
she led men to their deaths.

809
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:37,110
My blood is their fury,
my bones their fear.

810
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,279
I am their eternal damnation.

811
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:44,686
But to Mom I was just a baby,

812
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,754
(dramatic music)

813
00:49:46,788 --> 00:49:47,788
Her baby,

814
00:49:48,656 --> 00:49:51,458
to love (sniffles)

815
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:52,560
Forever.

816
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:55,697
(dramatic music)

817
00:49:55,730 --> 00:50:00,735
Saffron cleanses the soul from
impurities.

818
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:06,173
All newborns were bathed
in it, like a christening.

819
00:50:08,643 --> 00:50:09,711
But not what I am.

820
00:50:12,412 --> 00:50:15,650
Saffron can't fix that. (sobs)

821
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:19,086
My skin turned yellow.

822
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,354
My eyes bled.

823
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:22,289
I was dying.

824
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:27,094
Until Daddy appeared. (sobs)

825
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:29,531
He touched my face and
I came back to life.

826
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:35,670
My existence was her weakness.

827
00:50:36,638 --> 00:50:38,673
No one could know about me.

828
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:43,143
So she hid me away.

829
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:45,747
(dramatic music)

830
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:49,049
I had nothing!

831
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:53,153
(dramatic music)

832
00:50:55,122 --> 00:50:56,122
No friends!

833
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:58,593
No skills!

834
00:50:58,626 --> 00:51:01,261
No chance at a real life!

835
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:03,865
(dramatic music)

836
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:08,836
I was her secret for 40
years, and I hated her for it.

837
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:12,272
(dramatic music)

838
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:15,710
Daddy appeared to me again.

839
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:18,813
He gave me a choice,

840
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,584
the first choice of my life:

841
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:28,388
kill myself and break Mom's
heart,

842
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:31,693
or take her life

843
00:51:31,726 --> 00:51:33,360
(dramatic music)
(banging on door)

844
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:34,762
And become immortal.

845
00:51:34,796 --> 00:51:36,163
(banging on door)

846
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:37,732
I wanna go outside!

847
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:41,368
I wanna feel the sun!

848
00:51:41,401 --> 00:51:42,401
I wanna live!

849
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:44,872
So I killed her!

850
00:51:44,906 --> 00:51:48,141
I put my hands around her
throat and I choked her!

851
00:51:48,175 --> 00:51:49,175
I did it!

852
00:51:50,477 --> 00:51:51,345
You're insane.

853
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:53,380
I'm not, he is!

854
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:59,419
Every year, on my birthday,
he says he'll bring her back.

855
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,522
Well, not her, like, a
reincarnated doesn't know

856
00:52:01,556 --> 00:52:05,560
she's my Mom version, her
soul in somebody else.

857
00:52:05,593 --> 00:52:09,129
If I find her, I get to do the
deal again.

858
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,866
My life for hers.

859
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:17,404
If I'm wrong, he gets
his yearly sacrifice.

860
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:21,576
Mom should live, not me.

861
00:52:22,577 --> 00:52:24,612
I can't hurt anyone anymore.

862
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,414
I thought you were her!

863
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:30,784
Why?

864
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,319
Your message.

865
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:38,258
It said you make miracles
out of worthless men.

866
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,664
That's the last thing she said
to me before I killed her.

867
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:46,634
(dramatic music)

868
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:48,870
When we do this again, you run.

869
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:50,538
The saffron will work.

870
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:52,339
Let me die.

871
00:52:52,372 --> 00:52:54,776
You're her, I know it.

872
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:56,376
(she grunts)

873
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,713
(he screams)

874
00:53:04,686 --> 00:53:05,820
(she groans)

875
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:08,856
(dramatic music)

876
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:13,895
(she pants)
(dramatic music)

877
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:27,508
(he screams)
(dramatic music)

878
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:30,712
(dramatic music)

879
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:47,895
Shit.

880
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:50,732
(dramatic music)

881
00:53:56,604 --> 00:53:57,471
Help.

882
00:53:57,505 --> 00:54:00,508
(dramatic music)

883
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:03,443
It's a lot to take in, I know.

884
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:04,645
(thudding)

885
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,515
(dramatic music)

886
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:13,921
(dramatic music)

887
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,377
Help.

888
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,012
Help.
- Whoa!

889
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:39,013
What's going on?

890
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:40,615
Get the fuck away from me!

891
00:54:41,682 --> 00:54:42,784
Where are my clothes?

892
00:54:42,817 --> 00:54:45,485
In here, in the living room.

893
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,654
Cover with this.

894
00:54:46,687 --> 00:54:47,922
[Veronica] Stay back.

895
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:49,099
I don't know what you think
happened,

896
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:50,091
but you tripped and hit your
head.

897
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:51,692
Then I carried you in here.

898
00:54:51,726 --> 00:54:53,426
You've been out for a few hours.

899
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:56,664
You'll sure get the money,
that's not a problem.

900
00:55:09,577 --> 00:55:11,746
You know what, take, take, take
a grand.

901
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:15,382
I don't want you leaving here
thinking I'm some sick fuck.

902
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:17,051
I was trying to help you.

903
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:18,451
I'm sorry I scared you.

904
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:20,453
I fell?

905
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:21,589
Tripped.

906
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:22,924
Over me.

907
00:55:22,957 --> 00:55:25,760
I didn't expect you to
shove me up the stairs,

908
00:55:25,793 --> 00:55:28,129
which was the type of abuse I
wanted,

909
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:30,531
but my core is total shit
and I landed on my face.

910
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:32,733
Then you landed on my
back and hit your head.

911
00:55:35,703 --> 00:55:38,639
I used to be into
ambulance chaser fantasies,

912
00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:41,709
you know, I'd hire a girl to
fake-choke,

913
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:44,812
give her CPR, she'd reward me
with sex.

914
00:55:44,846 --> 00:55:47,849
So I thought maybe I
requested the wrong thing,

915
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:50,383
but you wouldn't wake up.

916
00:55:51,853 --> 00:55:53,955
I didn't call 911
because I don't want them

917
00:55:53,988 --> 00:55:55,355
to know why you're here.

918
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:57,592
I've never been arrested.

919
00:55:58,593 --> 00:56:00,695
I don't know your history with
the cops.

920
00:56:00,728 --> 00:56:02,697
I say no to jail time.

921
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:03,931
No!

922
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:08,970
(dramatic music)
(she pants)

923
00:56:24,852 --> 00:56:26,087
I can't take your money.

924
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,755
Oh, no, that's yours.

925
00:56:27,788 --> 00:56:28,656
You're taking it.

926
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:29,624
- No.
- Yes.

927
00:56:29,657 --> 00:56:30,625
I insist.

928
00:56:30,658 --> 00:56:32,960
(dramatic music)

929
00:56:32,994 --> 00:56:33,994
All right then.

930
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:39,634
She's taking the money.

931
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:41,969
(both laugh)

932
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:48,475
On one condition.

933
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:49,810
Whatever you want.

934
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:52,680
(dramatic music)

935
00:56:54,982 --> 00:56:55,983
Give me a do-over.

936
00:56:57,885 --> 00:56:59,186
A do-over?

937
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,656
Like, sex for real?

938
00:57:03,124 --> 00:57:04,457
Or is this dry wit?

939
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,960
Yes,

940
00:57:07,962 --> 00:57:08,962
sex for real.

941
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:10,830
When?

942
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:16,971
I'm out of town the rest of the
week, but maybe next Monday?

943
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,542
How about now?

944
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:23,476
Well, sure, but...

945
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:26,180
Can we, like, start from the
beginning?

946
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:29,617
You know, like, I'll meet
you at the restaurant,

947
00:57:30,885 --> 00:57:33,486
and I'm lost and stuff?

948
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:34,521
Sure.

949
00:57:35,523 --> 00:57:38,092
(dramatic music)

950
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:43,898
Meet you in 15 minutes.

951
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:44,899
Okay?

952
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:48,169
(dramatic music)

953
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:49,202
Oh, wait.

954
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:54,976
Your key.

955
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:57,845
(dramatic music)

956
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:06,988
(ominous music)

957
00:58:19,867 --> 00:58:22,603
(ominous music)

958
00:58:33,014 --> 00:58:35,850
(dramatic music)

959
00:58:53,267 --> 00:58:54,267
A drink?

960
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,772
What do you like?

961
00:58:57,805 --> 00:58:59,673
Well, I'd take another latte.

962
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:01,675
That really hit the spot.

963
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:03,010
[Veronica] I have alcohol.

964
00:59:03,044 --> 00:59:04,111
You want alcohol?

965
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:06,947
(dramatic music)

966
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:09,250
Oh, when in Rome.

967
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:12,086
(dramatic music)

968
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:46,720
[Veronica] Sit down.

969
00:59:46,754 --> 00:59:47,354
Oh, yeah.

970
00:59:47,388 --> 00:59:48,388
Sure.

971
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:51,826
You like whiskey?

972
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:55,162
I like everything, except
liars and tattletales.

973
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:58,065
(dramatic music)

974
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:00,835
Oh, but that's not what's
happening right now.

975
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:03,270
What's happening right now is
whiskey.

976
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:04,304
With you.

977
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:06,172
Veronica.

978
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:11,712
Cheers.

979
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:12,346
(glasses clink)

980
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:13,379
Cheers.

981
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:28,795
Get up.

982
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:32,099
Getting my do-over.

983
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:33,934
(slapping)

984
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:34,968
[Veronica] Now.

985
01:00:37,705 --> 01:00:38,705
I'm up.

986
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:42,710
(slapping)

987
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:43,743
Walk.

988
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,020
Move!

989
01:00:57,124 --> 01:00:59,994
(dramatic music)

990
01:01:00,027 --> 01:01:01,395
Get up, you pussy.

991
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:07,868
(dramatic music)

992
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,066
What the fuck even is that?

993
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:40,935
Are you even a man?

994
01:01:40,968 --> 01:01:41,968
I am.

995
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:45,773
(dramatic music)

996
01:01:50,244 --> 01:01:51,946
The shirt stays on.

997
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:53,914
(slapping)

998
01:01:53,948 --> 01:01:56,183
(dramatic music)

999
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:57,952
Get on the bed.

1000
01:01:57,985 --> 01:02:00,788
(dramatic music)

1001
01:02:24,845 --> 01:02:27,414
(dramatic music)

1002
01:03:40,254 --> 01:03:41,589
(gentle music)

1003
01:03:41,623 --> 01:03:42,623
Good God.

1004
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:44,558
Wow.

1005
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:47,562
[Veronica] Okay, I'll get going.

1006
01:03:47,595 --> 01:03:49,229
Want another drink?

1007
01:03:49,263 --> 01:03:51,533
I have another
appointment in a few hours.

1008
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:52,600
Sure, I understand.

1009
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,037
Maybe a quick drink?

1010
01:03:58,439 --> 01:03:59,907
Only kind I like.

1011
01:04:02,409 --> 01:04:03,409
Allow me.

1012
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:06,413
Moving in, I see.

1013
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:08,082
[Veronica] What?

1014
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:10,951
Acts like she owns me.

1015
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:12,152
Nice.

1016
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:13,420
That's what you paid for.

1017
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:17,257
(gentle music)

1018
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:30,437
Should we cheers?

1019
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,576
And disrespect the numerology
gods?

1020
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:36,611
Are you crazy?

1021
01:04:36,644 --> 01:04:38,245
What?

1022
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:39,278
That

1023
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,583
shit you talked about earlier,

1024
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:46,621
something about you can't
cheers twice in one day

1025
01:04:47,287 --> 01:04:51,125
'cause you'll look like an
asshole in front of the gods.

1026
01:04:51,158 --> 01:04:53,260
I thought I dreamed that.

1027
01:04:53,293 --> 01:04:54,495
(dramatic music)

1028
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:56,564
Well, you did, you told me
about it,

1029
01:04:56,598 --> 01:05:00,267
the dream that you had when you
fell.

1030
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,603
No.

1031
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:03,437
(dramatic music)

1032
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,406
You remember where I
keep the good whiskey

1033
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:09,276
but you can't remember
your dream? (chuckles)

1034
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:10,512
I remember my dream.

1035
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:12,514
I don't remember telling you
about it.

1036
01:05:12,547 --> 01:05:13,981
Well, you did.

1037
01:05:14,014 --> 01:05:16,651
(dramatic music)

1038
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:19,554
So, should we cheer?

1039
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:23,290
Or give the gods their respect?

1040
01:05:23,323 --> 01:05:26,160
(dramatic music)

1041
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:30,164
Cheers.

1042
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:31,398
(glasses clink)

1043
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:34,268
(dramatic music)

1044
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,039
Thanks.

1045
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:42,109
Hold on, Veronica.

1046
01:05:43,545 --> 01:05:46,246
I mean, you don't have to tell
me.

1047
01:05:48,148 --> 01:05:52,986
I, I, I, I respect your privacy,
and everything about you,

1048
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:57,024
really, but is Veronica your
real name?

1049
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:00,360
No.

1050
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:01,529
(he chuckles)

1051
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:03,363
Well, can you tell me what it
is?

1052
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,402
You know, for (chuckles) my
memory bank.

1053
01:06:09,403 --> 01:06:12,239
(dramatic music)

1054
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:16,075
Genevieve.

1055
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:18,344
Wow!

1056
01:06:20,682 --> 01:06:23,417
That is way better than
Veronica.

1057
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:26,654
Not when everybody
calls you Jenny or Gene.

1058
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:28,288
[Joshua] I'd never do that.

1059
01:06:29,256 --> 01:06:30,256
You okay?

1060
01:06:32,694 --> 01:06:33,695
Genevieve.

1061
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,197
Run!

1062
01:06:37,231 --> 01:06:40,000
(dramatic music)

1063
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:44,404
(he retches)

1064
01:06:46,273 --> 01:06:49,109
[Veronica] Grab, grab on me.

1065
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:50,645
(dramatic music)

1066
01:06:50,678 --> 01:06:52,814
You should've believed me.

1067
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:54,414
(dramatic music)

1068
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:59,453
(she whimpers)
(dramatic music)

1069
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,770
(dramatic music)

1070
01:08:17,497 --> 01:08:18,533
A little bit longer?

1071
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:22,570
This one was different.

1072
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:25,439
(dramatic music)

1073
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,919
(he sighs)

1074
01:09:11,953 --> 01:09:14,756
(dramatic music)

1075
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:29,236
(he gasps)
(ominous music)

1076
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:31,806
(bones cracking)

1077
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:35,543
(she gasps)

1078
01:09:35,576 --> 01:09:39,580
(speaking foreign language)

1079
01:09:48,656 --> 01:09:51,491
(dramatic music)

1080
01:09:59,466 --> 01:10:01,703
(he groans)

1081
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:03,670
Mummy.

1082
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,743
(dramatic music)

1083
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:41,008
(dramatic music)

1084
01:11:58,019 --> 01:12:00,721
(eerie music)

1085
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:24,745
(upbeat music)
