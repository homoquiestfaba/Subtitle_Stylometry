1
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:49,693
On the northeast tip of North America,
on an island called Newfoundland,

2
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,111
there's a airport.

3
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:54,489
It used to be
one of the biggest airports in the world.

4
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,743
And next to it is a town called Gander.

5
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,246
- There's a two-person police department.
- An elementary school.

6
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,665
- An SPCA.
- A local TV station.

7
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:04,750
And a hockey rink.

8
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,961
It's a small place
on a giant rock in the ocean.

9
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,047
Everybody knows everybody else.

10
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,176
And everybody in this room has a story
about how they started that day.

11
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,261
Welcome to the rock

12
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,888
- If you come from away
- Hep!

13
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,474
You'll probably understand
About a half of what we say

14
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,017
- Hep!
- They say no man's an island

15
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,393
But an island makes a man

16
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,314
'Specially when one comes
From one like Newfoundland

17
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,482
Welcome to the rock

18
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,651
That morning, I'm in the classroom.

19
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,779
It's our first day back,
and the school buses are on strike,

20
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,240
so I'm covering for Annette,
who's running late.

21
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,158
Sorry, Beulah. How's the kids?

22
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:41,620
Not exactly thrilled to be inside
on such a gorgeous day.

23
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,039
So I told 'em
we'd only have a half-day this morning.

24
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,501
They were quite pleased till I told 'em
we'd have the other half in the afternoon.

25
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,339
Welcome to the wildest weather
That you've ever heard of

26
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,259
Where everyone is nicer
But it's never nice above

27
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,053
Welcome to the farthest place
You'll get from Disneyland

28
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,473
- Fish and chips and shipwrecks
- This is Newfoundland

29
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,600
- Welcome to the rock
- I'm an islander

30
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,977
I am an islander

31
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,896
I'm an islander I am an islander

32
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,858
I'm an islander I am an islander

33
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,777
I'm an islander I am an islander

34
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,697
That morning, I'm in my car.

35
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,949
The kids cross Airport Boulevard
to get to school.

36
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,494
And that time of day, people are in
a bit of a rush to get to work and stuff,

37
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,038
so normally I sit there and run my radar.

38
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:29,626
And if they're speeding, I'll stop 'em
and write out a warning ticket.

39
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,631
I'll write "STFD"... "Slow The ♫♫♫♫ Down."

40
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,676
Welcome to the land
Where the winters tried to kill us

41
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,888
- And we said
- We will not be killed

42
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,557
Welcome to the land
Where the waters tried to drown us

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,602
- And we said
- We will not be drowned

44
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,271
Welcome to the land
Where we lost our loved ones

45
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,357
- And we said
- We will still go on

46
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,818
Welcome to the land
Where the winds tried to blow

47
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,862
And we said no

48
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,115
That morning, I drop my kids off at school
and head to the SPCA,

49
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,534
where I'm greeted by my other kids,

50
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:06,163
all barking and meowing
for breakfast and a belly rub.

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,373
Not that I'm complaining. I loves 'em.

52
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,710
But by the time feeding is done,
I gotta get back to pick up my human kids.

53
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,922
So I take just one second for myself.
And I'm sitting in my car.

54
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,173
- I'm in the staff room.
- I'm in the library.

55
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,635
And I turn on the radio.

56
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:25,849
You are here
At the start of a moment

57
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,061
On the edge of the world

58
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,981
Where the river meets the sea

59
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,691
Here

60
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,486
On the edge of the Atlantic

61
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,949
On an island in between

62
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,328
There and here

63
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,265
- I'm an islander, I am an islander
- I'm running my radar. Bonnie comes by.

64
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,935
- I'm an islander, I am an islander…
- She pulls up, wavin' at me like mad.

65
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,711
- So I roll down my window, and she says…
- Oz, turn on the radio.

66
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,548
- Slow it down, Bonnie.
- Jesus H., Oz, turn on your radio.

67
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,884
- Where our stories start
- It's my first day at the station.

68
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,720
- Where we'll end the night
- I'm getting coffee for the picket line.

69
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,640
- Where we know by heart
- Five minutes till my smoke break.

70
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,434
- Every single flight
- I'm off to work at the airport.

71
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,020
Welcome to the fog
Welcome to the trees

72
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,107
To the ocean and the sky
And whatever's in between

73
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,860
To the ones who've left
You're never truly gone

74
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,487
A candle's in the window
And the kettle's always on

75
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,448
When the sun is coming up
And the world has come ashore

76
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,243
If you're hoping for a harbor
Then you'll find an open door

77
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,121
In the winter, from the water
Through whatever's in the way

78
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,833
To the ones who have come from away
Welcome to the rock

79
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,721
I starts my day at Tim Hortons.

80
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,266
Don't drink coffee, don't drink tea,
and I've no use for donuts.

81
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,311
But I'll grab a Pepsi
and get a lay of the land.

82
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,772
As the mayor, it's how I keep in touch
with the people and such.

83
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,400
Everything starts and ends at Tim Hortons.

84
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,634
- Morning, Garth.
- Morning, Claude.

85
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,446
- Morning, Crystal.
- Morning, Mr. Mayor.

86
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,249
- Dwight.
- Morning, Claude, Garth, Crystal.

87
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,158
Claude, Crystal, Dwight, Garth. Morning.

88
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,911
- Morning, boys. Pepsi?
- That's right, Crystal.

89
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,579
- Yeah.
- What's the news?

90
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,891
- School bus strike still on?
- Yeah. We're working it out.

91
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,541
Well, we're coming to the table.

92
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,210
Well, we're coming to the table too.

93
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,420
- They tearing down the airport?
- Not today.

94
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,298
I heard Don Burton and his wife
won the Super 7.

95
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,799
- You don't say.
- Lucky shit.

96
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,510
4.6 million.

97
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,387
Excuse me, I'm looking for the mayor.

98
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:31,475
Mr. Mayor,
I'm Janice Mosher with Rogers TV.

99
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,019
I'm new to town and new to reporting.

100
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,230
- It's my first day.
- Where you 'longs to, Janice?

101
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,314
Port aux Basques.

102
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,566
So if you see me running red lights
or anything,

103
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,569
just forgive me because
we don't have stoplights over there.

104
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,780
- Well, welcome to Gander, Janice.
- Janice.

105
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:45,864
- Janice.
- Janice.

106
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:46,949
Janice.

107
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,993
If you're looking for news, you should
talk to that man running in here.

108
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,496
That's our constable, Oz Fudge.
He's full of stories.

109
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,915
Mr. Mayor, I saw your car in the lot.

110
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,084
Crystal, turn up the radio
so's we all can hear.

111
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,879
Doug, you probably wanna get down
to air traffic control right away.

112
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,507
There's only supposed to be
two air traffic controllers on,

113
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,425
but instead there's 14.

114
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,220
Everyone's heard, and they all shows up
without even being asked.

115
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:12,850
We're told there'll be over 200 planes
getting diverted across the country.

116
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,938
Lufthansa 414, this is Gander Center,
squawk code 7235.

117
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,150
Due to a recent development, you are
ordered to land at Gander YQX immediately.

118
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,987
Copy that. This is an order.

119
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,783
No, sir, you do not have a choice.

120
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,368
No, sir. This is not a drill.

121
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,538
Yes, sir.
I understand you have VIPs on board.

122
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,333
I'll see your VIPs
and raise you an international emergency.

123
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,626
Land your plane now.

124
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,628
- Copy that, Gander Tower.
- This is Air France.

125
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,713
- Aer Lingus.
- Lufthansa.

126
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,256
- British Airways.
- Emirates.

127
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,342
This is American four niner.
What am I supposed to tell my passengers?

128
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,386
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain.

129
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
There's been an incident
in the United States.

130
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,641
We're having trouble with the…
cabin lighting system.

131
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,935
We're just going to touch down
while we fix the system.

132
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,067
Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts.

133
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,905
Looks like we'll be making an unexpected
landing in Gander, "New-found-land."

134
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:12,201
Anybody in the business knows when you
set down in Gander, it's for an emergency.

135
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,827
Now, we don't know what's going on,

136
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,246
but the captain tells us
to keep everyone from panicking.

137
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,457
Tray tables up, please.

138
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,959
We will be dimming the lights
in the cabin.

139
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,754
Pushing the light bulb button
will turn your reading light on.

140
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,589
However,
pushing the flight attendant button

141
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,841
will not turn your flight attendant on.

142
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,844
I look out the window
to see if there's something mechanical,

143
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,764
like if we've lost an engine
or something's on fire.

144
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,140
But I don't see anything.

145
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,768
I told head office I need to travel less.

146
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,602
I told them it was doctor's orders.

147
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,523
But they say, "You're going
to the conference," so you go.

148
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:46,026
My dad's always saying,
"Bob, you got to calm down."

149
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,362
But the flight attendant is
shaking like a leaf,

150
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,322
so I figure I've got permission.

151
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,116
My son sends me on this vacation.

152
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,327
He says,
"Mom, you've never gone anywhere."

153
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,330
And when I get back, I'm telling him,
"This is exactly why."

154
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,165
Suddenly, there's a drop.

155
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,459
A sudden change in direction.

156
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,795
I fly a lot, so I know that's not normal.

157
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:12,261
Outside the window, all I can see below
are trees and rocks and… nothing.

158
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,639
On final approach,
we're coming into runway 22,

159
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,725
and I think,
"Where am I gonna park this thing?"

160
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,104
There are planes lined up like sardines.

161
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,440
And as far as I can see,
there's cars lined up too.

162
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,235
It looks like
everybody in Newfoundland is here.

163
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,529
One plane, then another

164
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,781
And then another

165
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,032
And then another

166
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:38,120
- Is this on? Sorry. I'm new.
- And then 13 planes, then another

167
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,123
- And then another, and then another
- This is Rogers TV Channel 9.

168
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,458
- My name is Janice Mosher.
- And then 19 planes…

169
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,127
I'm reporting live from Gander airport,

170
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,796
where the 19th plane
has just touched down.

171
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,881
I'm here with…

172
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,799
- Bonnie Harris.
- …and then 26 planes…

173
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,051
On a normal day,
we get a half dozen flights,

174
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:57,014
and now we already got three times
that many landing in two hours.

175
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,099
- It's a lot of noise.
- …and then 29 planes…

176
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,894
And you can smell the fuel.
You can smell the exhaust.

177
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,657
- Jesus, that's a jumbo!
- …and then another

178
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,481
- There's gotta be 250 or 300 on her.
- And then 32 planes…

179
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,193
That's a fairly large one.
There's gotta be 200 on her.

180
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,445
- Now I'm adding this up.
- And then another, and then

181
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,339
- We got 38 planes.
- Thirty-eight, thirty-eight…

182
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,866
We got two, three hundred people
on the average!

183
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,494
Thirty-eight, thirty-eight planes

184
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,996
Holy shit!

185
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,211
Air Traffic Control says five of the
planes on the ground aren't responding.

186
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,414
Reg says they're probably
just on the wrong frequency.

187
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,297
Thank you, Dwight.

188
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,841
FAA won't give us a timeline
for reopening the airspace.

189
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,820
The airplane crews need to be rested,
or we'll never get them out of here.

190
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,056
American Trans Air flight number 25
is requesting, when they deplane…

191
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,390
If they deplane.

192
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,975
- …that they be a priority.
- Why?

193
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,853
They were headed to Disney World
with 90 Make-A-Wish kids.

194
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:45,977
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my gosh.

195
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,232
Even with all the hotels in town,
we've got no room.

196
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,983
We gotta start looking at other towns.

197
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,070
Appleton and Gambo have already offered,
but we can't get them there.

198
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,864
Garth's bus drivers are
still on the picket line.

199
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,699
Without them, no one's going anywhere.

200
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,118
For Jesus's sake,
I'll tell them where to go!

201
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,162
Don't quote me on that.

202
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,290
I've got the SPCA lady on the line again
asking about animals.

203
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,417
Tell Bonnie we've got people to deal with.

204
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,628
Apparently those five planes
that aren't responding,

205
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,255
they're treating 'em as bomb threats!

206
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,090
All right!

207
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,425
The RCMP is gonna handle it.

208
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:20,389
But we've got almost 7,000 people
that might be spending the night.

209
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,517
Jesus, that's near as many
as we got living here in town.

210
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,062
We need to house them somewhere,
and we need to get them there.

211
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,146
Don't look at me.

212
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,608
Not to mention food and supplies
and anything else that snarls up.

213
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,903
Why are they sending them here?
Why not Toronto or Ottawa?

214
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,867
Because if anything goes wrong,
we have a lot less people to lose.

215
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,580
All right, Janice Mosher,
here's your news.

216
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,958
"Gander Town Council declares
a state of emergency."

217
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,335
- 11:53 a.m.
- Tuesday.

218
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,754
September 11, 2001.

219
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:56,425
Any available community buildings will be
converted into shelters.

220
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,844
With thousands of passengers arriving
at any minute,

221
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,637
the town is asking for help with...

222
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,723
Well, anything you can do.

223
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,350
Crystal, I saw on the news
That they're looking

224
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,186
For blankets and bedding
And maybe some food

225
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,829
Do you know what they need
And how much?

226
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,334
- I need something to do
- 'Cause I can't watch the news anymore

227
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,376
Can I help? Is there something?
I need to do something

228
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,545
To keep me from thinking
Of all of those scenes on the tube

229
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,589
I need something to do
'Cause I can't watch the news

230
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,573
No, I can't watch the news anymore

231
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,659
In the winter, from the water
Through the wind

232
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:26,246
If a stranger ends up at your door

233
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,623
You get on the horn

234
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,167
Hello, this is Beulah Davis
down at the academy.

235
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,253
I heard we might be getting some… guests.

236
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:37,007
And I thought I'd see if I could help
whosever in charge of getting the school...

237
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,219
How many passengers can we take?

238
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,471
We fit about 400 students...

239
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,224
Yes, we could probably do 600.

240
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:49,144
Or, sure, 700 if we really pack 'em in.

241
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,772
When are they coming?
Could be anytime now?

242
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,357
I'm glad I phoned.

243
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,816
I get a call from Beulah,

244
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,862
looking for "anything 700 people
from around the world might need."

245
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,031
So I go down to Shoppers,

246
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,201
and the manager says
to just take what I want off the shelves.

247
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,204
Toothbrushes, floss, mouthwash, deodorant.

248
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,164
And I'm back at the school
when Beulah says…

249
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,584
You know, those planes probably got
some babies on 'em.

250
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,255
So I'm back to Shoppers for diapers.

251
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,549
And we're unpacking them
when Annette says…

252
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,260
You know,
those babies are probably gonna be hungry.

253
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,722
So I'm back to Shoppers
for formula and baby food.

254
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,349
And when I get back, Beulah says…

255
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:32,521
Hey, you know, those planes are probably
filled with women of childbearing age.

256
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,691
So…

257
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:40,696
So I'm back to Shoppers to pick up
as many pads and tampons as they have.

258
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,241
The Baptist church needs a hand
moving their pews.

259
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,078
Dr. O'Brien down at the pharmacy is ready
to fill any prescriptions.

260
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,999
And the Lions Club is looking for
some toilet paper, if you have any extra.

261
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,250
- Medicine
- Toothpaste

262
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,334
- Underwear
- Aspirin

263
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,170
Jackets
Our kids grew out of last summer

264
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,172
Down at the station
We're taking donations

265
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,132
- Out by the door
- Holy Jesus, there's more

266
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,758
It's better than being at home alone

267
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,052
- Wondering what's really happening
- Everyone's phoning

268
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,679
We're setting up rooms in the schools

269
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,848
Been crying all afternoon
Wondering what can be done

270
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:08,974
What do we need?

271
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,977
- I made a tray of sandwiches.
- We need 50 more.

272
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,060
- Sandwiches?
- Trays!

273
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,145
What do we need?

274
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,521
200 gym mats. Is that enough?

275
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,023
You tell me and we'll both know.

276
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,107
What do we need?

277
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,235
For the love of God, stop bringing
toilet paper to the Lions Club!

278
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,155
How do you know what you need

279
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,324
When you don't know
How many you're needing to feed?

280
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,718
When you don't know
How many are staying

281
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:27,743
How long they are staying

282
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,626
We better start praying
The weather stays nice

283
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,872
In the winter, from the water
Through the wind

284
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,248
In the winter, from the water

285
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,501
In the winter, from the water
Through the wind

286
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,127
In the winter, from the water

287
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:41,298
If a stranger ends up sent by fate

288
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,424
Are we gonna be ready?

289
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,093
Well, we have to be, don't we?

290
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,555
When you include the original flight,

291
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,308
we were on the plane
for probably 12, 13 hours.

292
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,935
We were on there 15 hours.

293
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,061
Twenty hours.

294
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,604
Twenty-eight hours.

295
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,524
We were on the plane
for over an entire day.

296
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:04,571
Twenty-eight hours

297
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:08,158
Over an entire day

298
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,537
There was one aisle in the middle

299
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,082
Everyone knew every inch of that plane

300
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,751
- We were allowed out of our seats…
- Twenty-eight hours…

301
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,086
…but not off the plane.

302
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,548
You never think about it,
but airplane doors are 20 feet in the air.

303
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,509
And even if you survived the jump,
they probably would've shot you.

304
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,511
Everyone knew every inch of that plane.

305
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,222
You could go up to first class.
You could stretch in the aisles.

306
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,433
Our flight was full.
There were children sleeping on the floor.

307
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,394
It had three seats on each side.

308
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,855
There was only one aisle in the middle.

309
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,523
We had no way to get information.

310
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,859
This was before most people had
mobile phones,

311
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,903
- and only a couple people got through.
- …every inch of that plane

312
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,114
- Hello?
- Mom?

313
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,866
- Bonjour.
- Operator?

314
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,325
Tom?

315
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,287
Thank God I finally got through

316
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,748
I borrowed a passenger's phone
How are you?

317
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,459
Are the kids okay?

318
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,503
No, I'm fine, Tom

319
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,881
I'm fine

320
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,718
Safe and sound on the ground
Here in Newfoundland

321
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,888
We don't know much
Except for the BBC...

322
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,891
Listen, I can't talk long

323
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,768
Can you do something for me?

324
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,562
- I'm okay.
- I'm fine.

325
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,272
- Oui. Bien.
- Pick up.

326
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,983
Tell the kids I'm all right

327
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:27,154
Take them into the kitchen

328
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:34,369
And show them the map
That we used to put pins in

329
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:41,710
For each destination
That we flew together

330
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,880
Tell them I'm fine

331
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:49,760
Put a pin here in Gander

332
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,721
- On our plane, someone has a mobile phone.
- But then the battery dies.

333
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,284
- There are phones in back of the seats.
- But they don't work.

334
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,476
Half the passengers on our plane
don't speak English.

335
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,437
Even if we knew what was happening,
we don't speak their language.

336
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,356
On our plane,
we ask the flight attendants.

337
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:05,901
But the captain says not to say too much,
and that's when rumors start flying.

338
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,420
- There was an accident.
- An accident?

339
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,280
- The US airspace is closed.
- For the first time in history.

340
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,115
Why won't she tell us what's happening?

341
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,052
- A helicopter crashed in Pennsylvania.
- Into a building.

342
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,161
- Into the White House!
- The White House was bombed!

343
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,247
- We need to do something!
- Everyone, calm down!

344
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,873
Oh, my God! It's World War III!

345
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:24,002
Meanwhile on our plane
We didn't have a clue

346
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,256
- We were all going insane because
- There wasn't squat to do

347
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,675
Then the captain starts apologizing

348
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:33,387
Says, "On behalf of the airline
I'm giving each and everyone some"…

349
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,805
Complimentary booze

350
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,600
Open the airplane doors
Wave at all the cars

351
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,812
Hello to whoever you are

352
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,021
Wherever we are

353
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,148
The ground crews supplied
whatever we needed.

354
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,942
- Nicotine patches.
- Medication.

355
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,278
- Pampers.
- Something to drink!

356
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:53,031
So the flight attendants brought out
All the mini bottles of liquor

357
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,075
And delivered them to everyone

358
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,827
Soon everyone got friendlier

359
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,581
I took a couple of pictures
Of the view there with my camera

360
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,792
- We didn't know where we were
- But we knew that we were hammered

361
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:07,880
Open the airplane doors
Wave at all the locals

362
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:10,924
Surely there's something
Better to do than park

363
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,009
Wherever we are

364
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,932
We'd been sitting there for 14 hours
when we pull out the Grey Goose.

365
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,976
Kevin and I were kind of hiding it,
because...

366
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,686
'Cause we didn't wanna share it.

367
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:27,941
Anyway, this woman, this hot mess
behind us, kept completely freaking out.

368
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,944
Yeah, I don't understand
why they can't let us off.

369
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,031
I mean, just to stretch our legs.
I mean, really?

370
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,741
I need to get some air.

371
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,702
Oh, my God. I need to get off this plane!

372
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,120
And my boyfriend, Kevin…

373
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,665
We're both named Kevin.
It was cute for a while.

374
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,626
Anyway,
Kevin was not dealing with it well.

375
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,710
I'm going to kill her.

376
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:50,672
Excuse me!
I would like to get off the plane.

377
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,382
I am claustrophobic!

378
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,093
Excuse me. Would you like some Xanax?

379
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,596
Because you're freaking out,
and it is freaking me out,

380
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,890
and we are all freaking the freak out!

381
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,852
Open the airplane doors
Let a little air in here

382
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:07,231
- 'Cause I could use a shower or a bar
- Or a bar

383
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:11,193
Open the airplane doors
Look at all the planes out there

384
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,446
There must be a convention
It's bizarre

385
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,198
- Wherever we are
- Twenty-eight hours

386
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,575
- Twenty-eight hours
- Out of the windows

387
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,452
- Twenty-eight hours
- Twenty-eight hours

388
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,287
Nothing but darkness

389
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,932
- Twenty-eight hours
- Twenty-eight hours

390
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,749
Darkness and headlights

391
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,432
- Twenty-eight hours
- Twenty-eight hours

392
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,628
Nothing to see

393
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,506
Hello? It's Bonnie Harris
down at the Gander SPCA.

394
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,301
I went down with the rest of the town
to look at all those planes.

395
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,386
Yeah. We are.

396
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,347
Well, I got to wondering
if there weren't any animals on them.

397
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,140
No?

398
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,351
There's no animals on those planes?

399
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,936
Not a one?

400
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,730
Yeah. Okay, then. Thank you for your time.

401
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:49,815
Doug.

402
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,900
Doug, are there animals on those planes?

403
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:53,485
Probably?

404
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,238
"Probably"?
Are they "probably" feeding them then?

405
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,490
- I'm heading over.
- Bonnie, there's armed guards.

406
00:19:58,574 --> 00:19:59,825
The army. Police everywhere.

407
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,702
Well, then they'll have to shoot me.

408
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,037
Bonnie? Bonnie!

409
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,456
- Garth. Look.
- Claude. Look.

410
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,585
- Look at it from my perspective.
- Will you look at it from my perspective?

411
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,671
- We've been coming to the table!
- We've been coming to the table too.

412
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:16,383
We got the college, the churches,
and we got the hotels for the crews.

413
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,719
But we need your school buses!

414
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,346
We got no effing way to get them there.

415
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,850
Well, why don't you take 'em in your car?

416
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,852
Yeah, I can fit four in my Corolla.

417
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,621
- That's a great start.
- That's a great start.

418
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,397
- Great. Think about it.
- Great. No, you.

419
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,233
- You think about it.
- You think about it!

420
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,443
Jesus!

421
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,280
2:10 p.m. School bus drivers thinking
about leaving the picket lines.

422
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,701
What's the point of an emergency if
no one treats it like an effing emergency?

423
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,537
And you can quote me on that.

424
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,499
The flight attendants keep telling us
nothing's wrong.

425
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,754
But I got kids, and I got grandkids.
I know when someone's hiding something.

426
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:57,132
And when parents need their kids
to stop asking questions,

427
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,592
they start playing movies.

428
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,053
We ran through every movie we had.

429
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,805
Legally Blonde, Dr. Dolittle 2…

430
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,350
and Titanic.

431
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:13,899
Near, far, wherever you...

432
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,527
Nothing to do Nothing to see

433
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:21,448
Thank God we stopped
At the duty-free

434
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:22,533
Wherever we are

435
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:23,867
Do you mind if I sit here?

436
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:27,412
I need to get some work done, and there's
some drunk people at the back of the plane

437
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,540
singing at the top of their lungs.

438
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,916
No, of course.

439
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,631
- I'm Diane.
- Nick.

440
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,132
How are you doing?

441
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,219
I'm worried about someone.

442
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,929
He was flying today.

443
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,015
I just wish there was some way
to tell him where I am.

444
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,225
Newfoundland.

445
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,186
No, you know that.
You just can't tell him. Right.

446
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,771
I'm hoping you're one of those people

447
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,315
who laughs when English people
say awkward things.

448
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,360
- I just wish we knew what was happening.
- What's happening?

449
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,570
What's happening?

450
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,113
Somewhere in between

451
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,031
- Your life
- And your work

452
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:06,118
When the world may be falling apart

453
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,202
And you think

454
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,580
- I'm alone
- I'm alone

455
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,540
And I'm so damn helpless

456
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:15,169
There's nothing left to do but drink

457
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:18,922
We open the airplane doors
Flash all the cars

458
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,551
I've never done that before

459
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,928
Twenty-eight hours gone

460
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,722
Over an entire day

461
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,390
Running out of things to say

462
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:32,019
And wondering
If there's someone going to clue us in

463
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,896
Tell us all what's happening

464
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:37,232
Because the sun is setting
And we're sitting in the dark

465
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:38,317
Wherever we are

466
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,196
Later that night, I'm up in the cockpit
with some of the other passengers

467
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,490
when the pilot puts the radio on
over the intercom,

468
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:49,703
and the whole plane goes silent
when the president gives his speech.

469
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:54,875
I ask the American people to join me
in saying a thanks

470
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,378
for all the folks who have been fighting
hard to rescue our fellow citizens,

471
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,674
and to join me in saying a prayer
for the victims and their families.

472
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,844
The resolve
of our great nation is being tested.

473
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,054
But make no mistake:

474
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,973
We will show the world
that we will pass this test.

475
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:11,600
God bless.

476
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,603
You got through to the airline

477
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,396
Tom, I'm okay

478
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,941
Tell me what's happening out there

479
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:22,236
How bad is it? Tell me everything

480
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,697
Tom, who was in the air?

481
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,076
No, no, I wouldn't have known them

482
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,121
No, no one on that airline

483
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,043
Charles? Are you sure?

484
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:48,554
No, I'm fine, Tom I'm fine

485
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,515
We can see 'em from the plane,

486
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,434
this long line of headlights
coming through the darkness.

487
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:55,811
Claude, can I have a word?

488
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,146
I don't have time to go in circles
with you anymore.

489
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,110
I got the army delivering
a thousand less cots...

490
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:03,110
Look, the union just voted.
You got your buses.

491
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,695
Our complaint's with our employer.

492
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,822
- Not with the people on those planes.
- Thank you.

493
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,199
But we're back on the line
the minute this is over.

494
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,284
Right.

495
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,619
Off of the airplane

496
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,913
Ladies and gentlemen,
take only your carry-on items.

497
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:17,332
Checked luggage will remain in the hold.

498
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,500
Into the airport

499
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,627
The captain and flight attendants
tell everyone

500
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:23,046
to take their blankets and pillows
off the plane.

501
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,715
Out of the windows

502
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,091
We grab bottles of water too.

503
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,051
No one has any idea
where they're taking us.

504
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,805
Darkness and trees

505
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:35,559
As we enter the airport, all those
car lights are still aimed at us.

506
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,437
We're scared. They're probably scared too.

507
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,106
The people here don't know what to expect
off of these planes.

508
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,942
The airport looks like something left over
from the Cold War.

509
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:46,403
- And Kevin's like…
- Oh, my God. We've gone back in time.

510
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:50,324
The whole procedure,
the soldiers and all the formality,

511
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,492
just makes me really nervous.

512
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,954
- Citizenship?
- American.

513
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:57,039
British.

514
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,540
Purpose of your trip?

515
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,000
- Vacation.
- A conference.

516
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,084
Destination?

517
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,419
- Dallas.
- Texas.

518
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:03,754
Thank you.

519
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:04,838
Citizenship?

520
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,590
- American.
- Egyptian.

521
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,968
Purpose of your trip?

522
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:11,053
Family.

523
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:12,262
Business, just business.

524
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,722
Destination?

525
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,849
- LA.
- Dallas, then Washington, DC.

526
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:18,352
- Thank you.
- Could you come with me, sir?

527
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:24,274
There's a giant map
on the wall of the airport,

528
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:27,194
and someone has written in red marker,
"You are here."

529
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:30,030
- Excuse me. I need to find a phone.
- I need to call my son.

530
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,741
Well, the phones are over there.
But it's gonna be a while.

531
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:35,244
They're all lined up
at the airport pay phones,

532
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:38,747
so eventually we put
an "out of order" sign on 'em

533
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,500
just so we can get people on the buses.

534
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,044
11:48 p.m.

535
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:47,798
Buses and drivers are now taking
passengers to shelters.

536
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:52,553
Not just in Gander, but also to Gambo,
Appleton and farther communities

537
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,222
of Lewisporte, Norris Arm, and Glenwood.

538
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,100
- Our bus sits there forever.
- While all the others leave.

539
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,435
Finally, this other… passenger gets on.

540
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,895
This guy from the Middle East.

541
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,730
Someone says he got questioned.

542
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,190
Someone says he got searched.

543
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:07,734
And now he's on our bus.

544
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:11,196
I try to interview the Red Cross,
the Salvation Army,

545
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,866
but they've got more important things
to do than talk to me.

546
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,786
That's when I see them, the plane people,
through the bus windows.

547
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,664
The terror on their faces…

548
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,749
They have no idea where they're going.

549
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,668
They take me and my crew
in a separate van.

550
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,171
I'm looking out the window,
trying to see where we are,

551
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,214
but it is pitch-dark.

552
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:33,135
Now, I have flown over this area
hundreds and hundreds of times,

553
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:36,889
and it is just darkness,
hardly any lights anywhere.

554
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,932
And now here I am.

555
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:42,936
Oh, my God. This is just so remote!

556
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,772
- Into the darkness
- Stars and the moonlight

557
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,734
- But all around us
- Nothing but darkness

558
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,570
- Out of the windows
- Into the darkness

559
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:58,535
Darkness and trees

560
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:03,916
Every school bus we got
is goin' back and forth all night.

561
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,668
Out to the Salvation Army camp,

562
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:10,214
we've delivered passengers
from Germany, England and France.

563
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,634
On around 3:00 in the morning,
my bus is designated

564
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:17,221
to take all these African people
out there.

565
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,514
Into the darkness

566
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:21,600
My family and I try to see
out the bus windows.

567
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,602
No one tells us where we are going.

568
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,686
Onto a gravel road

569
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,063
Silence comes on the bus.

570
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,941
We get outside of Gander,
and you could hear a pin drop.

571
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:31,193
- And all around us
- My wife and daughter are scared.

572
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,946
They ask me what is happening,
and I do not know.

573
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,740
- Behind me, this big man comes up to me…
- Darkness and trees

574
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,575
…and he says in this low voice…

575
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:43,372
What?

576
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:47,292
Ladies and gentlemen,
we need some help translating.

577
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:51,380
If anyone speaks Mandarin,
can you come to the library?

578
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:55,676
And if anyone speaks Hindi,
could you please come to the cafeteria?

579
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,928
And if anyone speaks Newfoundlander,

580
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,556
well, Lard tunderin' Jaysus,
God bless ya, b'y.

581
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:04,268
We've got passengers from
all over the world coming off these buses,

582
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,770
all speaking different languages.
We can't even say hello.

583
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,981
- And if anyone knows... We think it's...
- Moldovan.

584
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,066
Moldovan, that would also be helpful.

585
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,985
Other passengers help us translate.

586
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:16,363
Mrs. Noonan, our French teacher,
turns out to know a little Russian.

587
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:19,283
And Mr. Michaels, our gym teacher...

588
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,159
Apparently he speaks Spanish.

589
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,221
I'm sorry, what was I saying?

590
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,140
I said you got five minutes, Bonnie.

591
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,309
There are hundreds of suitcases.

592
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:48,729
I can hear barking, but I can't find 'em.

593
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,398
They fast them before flying,
so they are starving,

594
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,482
and they need water.

595
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:56,153
Sir? Sir! Doug.

596
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:59,573
You gotta get out of there. We're keeping
all personnel out of the holds until...

597
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,366
Sorry, Dwight. It's the wife.

598
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,910
You know, Bonnie, from the SPCA?

599
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,193
She's feeding some animals inside.
Nothing's coming off.

600
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:08,832
I found a cat. His name is Lyle.

601
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,418
There's a pill taped to his carrier.

602
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,670
Well, I'm glad I got in here
to give it to him.

603
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:14,922
It's okay, Lyle.

604
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,798
Bonnie, I need you to get out of there.

605
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,425
Bonnie, you gotta move your arse!

606
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:22,387
Doug, I have found one cat.
Do you think it's Lyle who's barking?

607
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:24,348
No.

608
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:27,267
Here's some crunchy, Lyle.
I'll be back to give you your pill.

609
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:30,854
Listen to me. FAA sent over new orders.

610
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:33,774
We're treating all US planes
as bomb threats.

611
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,901
- Oh, God. Bonnie!
- Doug! Doug!

612
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:40,822
- What? Bonnie? Bonnie, talk to me.
- Doug! There are monkeys on this plane.

613
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,494
- Climb aboard.
- Hop right in.

614
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,913
- You look some tired.
- Nothing to worry about now.

615
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,456
We'll get you where you're going.

616
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,750
I'm guessing
you never heard of Gander before.

617
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,086
Well, that's it in the rearview mirror.

618
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,296
You'll need to reset your watches.

619
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,382
We've got our own time zone here.

620
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:01,093
Everything happens half an hour later
in Newfoundland.

621
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:05,055
You've all seen the airport. Used to be
the biggest airport in North America.

622
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,432
Planes used to stop here
to gas up from everywhere.

623
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,144
- Frank Sinatra. Albert Einstein.
- Muhammad Ali.

624
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:12,229
The Queen.

625
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,023
This is where the Beatles first set foot
in North America.

626
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:18,026
My father once went sledding
with Fidel Castro.

627
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:21,738
Then they invented jet planes that can
get across the ocean on one tank.

628
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,782
So there's no need to refuel anymore.

629
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,742
Leaving us with this giant airport.

630
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:27,870
There's talk lately about tearing it down.

631
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,372
Lucky for you,
we haven't got around to it yet.

632
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,626
Now, there's the reason I drive slow.

633
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,337
That there in the middle of the road…

634
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,507
Yeah, that's a moose.

635
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,935
She'll move when she's good and ready.

636
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,483
Mind if I sit here?

637
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:01,028
The drunk people from our plane
are snoring back there.

638
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,988
Hello, Nick. Please do.

639
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,324
I thought we'd lost you.

640
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:08,243
No. I just needed to get
an emergency prescription filled.

641
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:10,204
My medication's in my suitcase.

642
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,039
Nothing serious.

643
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:15,375
Not like, "Oh, my God,
he's off his medication!"

644
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,463
- I'll stop talking now.
- It's fine.

645
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,717
It's heart medication. I've got
a slight arrhythmia. Nothing serious.

646
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,679
There you go,
everything you need to know about me.

647
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:28,764
Okay.

648
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:34,603
Well, I'm allergic to bananas.
And I've never had the chicken pox.

649
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,273
Any news yet about your husband
who was flying today?

650
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,317
My... No.

651
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,486
Do you mind
if we just don't talk about that?

652
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,863
I haven't been able to get to a phone.

653
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:46,031
I'm sorry.

654
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:50,911
I'll help you find a phone
as soon as we get… wherever we're going.

655
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:56,333
Finally, out of the darkness,
my bus arrives at the Salvation Army camp.

656
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,839
We pass through a large gate,
and the bus pulls to a stop.

657
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,968
And through the windows,
out there in the darkness,

658
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,512
we see all these people
coming out of the buildings.

659
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:12,057
Now, we rarely use 'em,

660
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,019
but everyone's dusted off
their Salvation Army uniforms

661
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:17,271
to welcome these people.

662
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:19,398
There are soldiers everywhere.

663
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,236
The man at the front opens the door.

664
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,864
I say, "Here you are. Out you go."

665
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,032
But he's not moving. None of 'em are.

666
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:36,123
But then I notice his wife,
well, she's clutching a Bible.

667
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:37,624
Now, obviously, I can't read it.

668
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:41,503
But their Bible, it'll have
the same number system ours does.

669
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:45,174
So I ask… to see it.

670
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,889
And I'm searching for something here.

671
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:56,101
And then, in Philippians 4:6.

672
00:32:56,185 --> 00:33:00,856
I give them their Bible, and I'm pointing,
saying, "Look, Philippians 4:6."

673
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,734
"Be anxious for nothing."

674
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:09,031
"Be anxious for nothing."

675
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:15,412
And that's how
we started speaking the same language.

676
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,958
Out of the darkness

677
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,920
Suddenly brightness

678
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:25,714
Everything changes

679
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,592
Darkness and trees

680
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,470
Out of the darkness

681
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,891
Suddenly light

682
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:40,854
Welcome to Gander Academy,
nicest hotel on the east coast.

683
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,065
Except for those with actual beds.

684
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:46,401
My name's Beulah.
Washrooms are just down the hall,

685
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:49,363
and there's food over there
if you're hungry

686
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:52,115
and clothes if you'd like to change.

687
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,076
I'll show you now
where you're gonna sleep.

688
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,287
Let us know
if there's anything else you need.

689
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:59,164
So, what really happened?

690
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:00,749
What's the last thing you heard?

691
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,626
There was an accident in New York.

692
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:07,256
Okay. I'm gonna show you now
to your rooms.

693
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,466
And then, if you want, you can come back.

694
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,053
We got two TVs set up in the cafeteria
with the news on,

695
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:16,889
so you can see what's actually happened
for yourselves.

696
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:20,018
I didn't even think.

697
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,646
They haven't seen any of it yet.

698
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,190
Lead us out of the darkness

699
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,525
We were all staring at those images.

700
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,902
And we just stand, helpless, watching 'em.

701
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:33,031
Lead us somewhere to safety

702
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:37,286
We barely know where we are,
but we know it's not there.

703
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:42,165
Lead us far from disaster

704
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,377
Charles Burlingame was the captain
of Flight 77

705
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,045
that crashed into the Pentagon.

706
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,757
I just saw him at a pub in London.

707
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:52,842
You can't imagine.

708
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:57,054
A pilot will fight to the ends
of the earth to save his airplane.

709
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,516
He just will.

710
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:07,608
Lead us out of the night

711
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,612
We watch those images for hours.

712
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:17,826
Until someone finally turns it off.

713
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,039
1:15 a.m.

714
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:24,124
- Wednesday.
- September 12th.

715
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:27,377
Crisis counselors are called
to Gander Academy.

716
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:31,965
The plane people, they're exhausted,
but they don't wanna sleep.

717
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:35,177
And we're standing there,
ready with all that food.

718
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,638
But that's not what they wanted.

719
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,056
They wanted phones.

720
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:40,933
1:45 a.m.

721
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,434
Six phones are put on tables

722
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:44,686
for the plane people to use
free of charge,

723
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,980
lined up alongside the road
by the NewTel building.

724
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:49,525
An hour later, they set up 20 more phones.

725
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:53,737
An hour after that, there's 75 phones
and computers with Internet,

726
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,948
all being used round the clock.

727
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,367
Hello? Yes, it's me.

728
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,911
Dad, I'm okay It's okay

729
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:02,704
I'm calling from Canada

730
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:06,124
Safe and sound on the ground
Here in Iceland

731
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,626
- No, Newfoundland.
- Yeah.

732
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,837
We just saw the news

733
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,631
- Have you heard yet from Kev?
- Or Celena?

734
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,508
- Call Micah
- And Lauren

735
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:15,676
- My parents
- My aunt

736
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,511
It's Di

737
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:20,097
No, I'm fine Where's David?

738
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:23,100
Thank God.

739
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:24,852
Hello. It's Nick Marson.

740
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,937
My plane's been diverted.

741
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,648
Can you pass on to someone at head office
that I'm fine?

742
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,819
No, no.
I just thought someone should know.

743
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:36,238
3:45 a.m.

744
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:41,910
Overnight, the community's population has
gone from approximately 9,000 to 16,000.

745
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:44,121
I'm sure
barely any of us have slept tonight.

746
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:47,207
We're hopeful that our visitors will be
back in the air come morning.

747
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,253
I woke up from a dream,
which I can't quite remember,

748
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:54,423
but there was this music in it
that I had heard somewhere before.

749
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:59,428
I woke up from a dream that we were stuck
in some backwater Canadian town

750
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,221
and that my air mattress deflated.

751
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:04,516
I woke up
to the smell of freshly baked bread.

752
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,186
4:00 a.m. in Newfoundland is
breakfast time in Germany,

753
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:09,980
and we got a lot of passengers here
from Frankfurt,

754
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,941
so breakfast starts at 4:00 a.m.,
and we start scrambling eggs.

755
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:16,612
- Poached eggs, scrambled eggs, omelets.
- Fried bologna.

756
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,071
Something called "toutons."

757
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:20,324
I saw a casserole dish
I don't think I could lift.

758
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,577
They made enough food
to feed 7,000 people.

759
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:26,663
It's like they never slept.

760
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:29,249
There's this one man
from the Middle East...

761
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,669
Well, we don't really know.
Hasn't said a word to a soul.

762
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:35,589
And some of the other passengers are
a little bit wary of him.

763
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:38,634
So it's a little odd to find him
poking around the kitchen...

764
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:41,094
- Hello.
- Hello. Can I help you with something?

765
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,430
Yes. I would like to be of assistance
with the food.

766
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:44,848
- That's not necessary.
- But I...

767
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,683
You go out there and sit down.

768
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:49,770
We've been going all night,
but we can't stop.

769
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:53,273
I splash some cold water on my face
and just keep going.

770
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:57,945
We've got 7,000 scared and angry people
who don't wanna be here.

771
00:37:58,028 --> 00:37:59,613
And they're about to wake up.

772
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:04,326
In a crowded room
Filled with strangers sleeping

773
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:08,247
An airplane blanket
And pillow on the floor

774
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:12,584
The sun comes streaming
Through the window

775
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:17,089
And I can't sleep anymore

776
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:21,385
Staring at these strangers
Waking up around me

777
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:25,389
Sitting in a crowd of people
Waiting for the phone

778
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:29,434
And in a town
That's suddenly doubled population

779
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:33,897
I feel so alone

780
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:38,610
It's like any of us
Could have died on Tuesday

781
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:41,780
And like we're dared
To see things differently today

782
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:43,365
- I'm feeling different
- Distant

783
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:45,075
- Strange
- Who are these people here?

784
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,452
- Where am I?
- No one knows me here

785
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:52,124
Who am I if I don't feel
Like the me from yesterday?

786
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:55,544
I wake up in a crowded room
full of people sleeping on the floor,

787
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,588
and I see Diane and ask, "Are we leaving?"

788
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,089
Anytime now, yeah.

789
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,257
Is your hair different?

790
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,177
I mean, you look nice. I like it.

791
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:07,681
Well, thank you.
It's no shampoo for three days.

792
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:10,142
They start handing out clothes
to anyone who needs 'em.

793
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,477
I haven't changed my clothes in 39 hours.

794
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:14,354
I wanted to burn my socks.

795
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,399
Kevin puts on this plaid thing.

796
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:21,403
He says he's incognito and that
he's going to blend in with the locals,

797
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,572
but he just looks like a gay lumberjack.

798
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:30,204
Changing into
Another woman's donated set of clothes

799
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:33,999
Looking different
Feeling kinda different too

800
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:36,418
- I can't quite explain
- But when I woke

801
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:38,462
When David wasn't on that plane

802
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:42,883
It's like I changed into somebody else
But who?

803
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:46,595
And it's somehow like
We're at a costume party

804
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:49,640
And for a second you are not yourself

805
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:51,391
You are not yourself

806
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:53,769
And you look around
And blink your eyes

807
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,854
And barely even recognize

808
00:39:55,938 --> 00:40:00,776
The person in the mirror
Who's turned into someone else

809
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,486
Hey, little sister.

810
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,822
Yeah, still here
where they eat rainbows for breakfast.

811
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:07,282
Are you taking care of Mom?

812
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,953
I'm just freaking out. I wish I was home.

813
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:13,413
No, not LA. Brooklyn.

814
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,457
Shut up. You're such a brat.

815
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,251
I just needed to hear your voice.

816
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,170
- Excuse me. Are you Hannah?
- Yeah, that's me.

817
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:23,674
My name's Beulah.
Someone told me your son's a firefighter.

818
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:25,843
Yeah, mine is too, here in town.

819
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:29,346
And I know Gander's not New York,
but is there anything I can do?

820
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:33,183
No. I just need to hear from my son.

821
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:34,476
I understand.

822
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,436
Praying for a phone call

823
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,272
Praying for a way home

824
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,857
Asking questions

825
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,193
Asking, "Can I get back
On that godforsaken plane?"

826
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:45,320
And all around me, people chat

827
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,865
And people act like nothing's happened

828
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:53,120
And I need to hear we're going back
Before I go insane

829
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:55,497
Good morning. I'm Captain Beverley Bass.

830
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:57,124
I know this is gonna be hard to hear.

831
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:59,418
The American airspace remains closed.

832
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,712
I can't tell y'all
how long we'll be on the ground,

833
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,505
but we are gonna be here for some time.

834
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,133
- Here for some time
- Here for some time

835
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:08,260
- Here for too long
- Here for how long?

836
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,345
- When will we know?
- When will we know?

837
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,681
How much longer?

838
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:15,976
Beulah, wait.
Can you help me find a Catholic church?

839
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,395
I can't sit here. I need to get some air.

840
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:20,480
Let's go see where we are.
It'll do you good.

841
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:24,318
No, what'll do me good is to lie down,
pretend this isn't happening.

842
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,361
Suit yourself.

843
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:30,866
And it's somehow like we're stuck here
At a messed-up costume party

844
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:32,951
And there's nothing here familiar

845
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,370
Far away from those you care for

846
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:40,751
On an isolated island in between

847
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:46,965
- There and here
- There and here

848
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:52,304
By the middle of the day on Wednesday,
I'm coordinating menus for 7,000 people.

849
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:56,850
Ladies and gentlemen, the Rotary Club
is looking for some fish dishes.

850
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,853
And we have a bunch of German passengers
down at the Moose Club

851
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:01,522
who would like to try elk.

852
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:06,068
No, sorry. That's the Elks Club
that's looking for moose.

853
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:09,696
Sorry. I'm new.

854
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:15,202
Well, if you won't try cod tongue,
we got cheeseburgers.

855
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:16,870
Or we got hot dogs too.

856
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:19,331
There's tuna casserole over there.

857
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:21,750
Or I could make you up a bologna sandwich.

858
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:24,253
Are there vegetables in Canada?

859
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:26,713
- We're vegetarians.
- I converted him.

860
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:29,800
Anyway, I notice this other passenger
who hasn't eaten anything at all.

861
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,885
Kevin is suddenly
in everyone else's business.

862
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:33,637
So I notify our hosts.

863
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,431
No. No, thank you. Please. I'm fine.

864
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:41,895
Turns out he's an Orthodox Jewish rabbi,
and he only eats kosher food.

865
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,773
Now, we have all kinds of people
living in Newfoundland:

866
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:50,737
Protestants, Baptists, Catholics,
Salvation Army-ists.

867
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:52,573
Not a lot of Jewish people.

868
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:55,075
The next thing I know,
I'm set up in the faculty lounge,

869
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:57,536
making a kosher kitchen
for any other Jewish passengers,

870
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:00,414
but also for two Hindu women,
some Muslims.

871
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:02,457
And a couple of vegetarians.

872
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:06,545
One of the pilots from Virgin Atlantic,
Captain Bristol,

873
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:08,380
he's a very strong leader.

874
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:11,925
He's good to his passengers,
and he's handsome too.

875
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,678
Anyway, he takes me aside and he says…

876
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:17,097
I've been watching you.

877
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:19,266
You're doing beautiful work.

878
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:24,062
I'd like you to be my personal liaison
and work closely with me,

879
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:27,566
helping to handle anything I might need.

880
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:30,527
Annette!

881
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:33,113
What are you on about?
He did not say that.

882
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:36,033
Well, he said something like that.

883
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,368
Miss Beulah. Hello.

884
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:39,494
Hello, Ali.

885
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:41,705
May I ask, this food, what is it?

886
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:44,249
- That's called cod au gratin.
- "Cod oh grat"...

887
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,417
Fish with cheese.

888
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,546
It's fish… with cheese.

889
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,925
Are you sure I cannot help you
with the food?

890
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:58,222
People start taking passengers
back to their houses to get cleaned up

891
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:01,475
and then inviting 'em to dinner,
then putting 'em up in their guest room.

892
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:04,186
Look, missus, I'm just 20 weeks along.

893
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:06,772
My Terry has already set up the nursery.

894
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:09,316
You and your little one'd be
much more comfortable there.

895
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:11,276
Thank you for shopping at Walmart.

896
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,737
Would you like to come back to my house
for a shower?

897
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,367
People are saying,
"We want you to come to our house."

898
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,869
And I think, what's up with this?

899
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:24,206
I mean, are they charging
for these "free" showers?

900
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:26,416
Or are they gonna go all Norman Bates?

901
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,836
Anyway, I wasn't falling for it.

902
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:32,339
But, finally, I'm invited back
to the mayor of Appleton's house.

903
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:35,801
That sounds fancy. But it's not.

904
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:39,179
There is a mayor for every town
of a thousand people in Newfoundland.

905
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:42,641
There's the mayor of Gander.
There's the mayor of Lewisporte.

906
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:44,393
There's the mayor of Gambo.

907
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:47,437
Anyway, I'm staying
with the mayor of Appleton.

908
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:51,316
Come on in, son.
The Irish whiskey's in the bar downstairs.

909
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:55,779
His wife shows me where my bedroom is
and where the shower is,

910
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:59,491
and through it all, I keep thinking,
"Where am I gonna leave my wallet?

911
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:02,369
Somebody's gonna steal my wallet."

912
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:06,623
Someone says there's a way out of here.
They say there might be a boat.

913
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:09,418
Kevin, we're on the other side
of the continent.

914
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:11,837
We're not taking a boat.

915
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,381
So I stop an officer and ask him.

916
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:17,092
- How do I get back home?
- Yeah, how do we get out of here?

917
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:21,305
Well… you take a taxi to the Goose.

918
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:25,642
There's a bus there to Port aux Basques,
leaves once a day. That's about six hours.

919
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:28,437
Once you're there,
you take the ferry across the gulf, right?

920
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,730
That's eight hours or so.

921
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,107
Then you catch another bus.

922
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:36,486
Not sure how often they leave,
but it's another eight hours to Yarmouth,

923
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,281
where you can get another ferry
to the US border.

924
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:42,034
That's another four hours or so.

925
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:44,620
And from Bar Harbor
you should be able to grab a Greyhound

926
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:45,913
to wherever you need to go.

927
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:49,458
It's about two or three days' travel,
but it's sure a nice view.

928
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:53,086
I don't leave the hotel.
I wait by the phone,

929
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,506
wait for someone to tell me
we can fly again.

930
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:58,050
Planes aren't made
to just sit on the tarmac.

931
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:00,636
Planes are made to be in constant motion.

932
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,347
They arrive, you switch crew,
you switch passengers,

933
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,433
you empty the Honey Buckets,
and the plane keeps going.

934
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:09,937
When they sit still for too long,
well, it's not good for 'em.

935
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,147
They start to break down.

936
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:15,817
Our pilot says we're not leaving
anytime soon. And Nick says…

937
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:17,581
I might take a picture or two
before we go.

938
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,863
I finally convince Kevin to go for a walk.

939
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,865
There's four of us to begin with,

940
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,034
this Texan woman and this English guy

941
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:27,079
with a disposable camera
and a huge stick up his ass.

942
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:31,041
They're nice enough. Kevin and I are wary
of telling people we're together.

943
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:33,794
I mean, you just don't know
how redneck people can be.

944
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:36,296
This nice gay couple come along with us.

945
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,799
And we kind of make small talk.
They ask me what I do.

946
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:42,719
He works for this oil company in England,
and she was there visiting with her son.

947
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:44,346
Wait. You've got a son?

948
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:47,724
Yes. David,
the one who was flying on Tuesday.

949
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:49,560
She's going on and on about England

950
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:52,479
and how she didn't get to travel much
when she was married.

951
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:55,440
- Wait. You're divorced?
- Yes.

952
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:56,775
For a long time now.

953
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:59,736
- What about you?
- No, not divorced.

954
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,281
I mean, not that I'm married. I'm neither.

955
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,991
I travel a lot for work.

956
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:07,536
Kevin and I work
for an environmental energy company.

957
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,830
Well, it's my company.
Kevin's my secretary.

958
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,623
I'm his sexy-tary.

959
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:13,458
Anyway, we do a lot of green work,

960
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,544
so we generally hate people
who work in oil.

961
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:17,754
I just got the feeling that they hated me.

962
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:22,217
Then they wanna go into some old building
that looked like a shed.

963
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:25,470
Now, they'd heard it was a bar,

964
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:28,599
but I wasn't going into a bar
in the middle of the afternoon

965
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,767
with three men I just met.

966
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:32,853
And I think I'll stay with Diane.

967
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:35,439
You know,
instead of the gay men who hate me.

968
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,650
Doug is helping me feed the animals.

969
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:43,113
And after Security checks each plane,
slow as cold molasses,

970
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:48,535
we finally find eight dogs, nine cats,
one of whom is epileptic,

971
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:52,998
not to mention
two rare bonobo chimpanzees.

972
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:56,001
And the female bonobo is pregnant.

973
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:58,295
We have got to get them off these planes.

974
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,838
Yeah, hello? Is the mayor there?

975
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:02,090
It's Bonnie Harris again. Yes, I'll hold.

976
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:03,884
Airport Authority was pretty clear

977
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:06,512
about "no rare bonobo chimpanzees
on Canadian soil."

978
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:07,971
- Doug, take that.
- What is that?

979
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:09,973
It's rare chimpanzee shit.

980
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:11,475
- What do you think it is?
- Jeez.

981
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:14,978
- Yes, the mayor... Yes, I'll hold.
- I gotta get back to air traffic control!

982
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:17,689
Doug, look up.

983
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:19,733
Do you see anything flying?

984
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:24,112
- I can't see across the friggin' Atlantic!
- Just get more litter from the truck.

985
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:26,031
- Get your own litter.
- Fine, then goodbye.

986
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:28,408
No! No, no, no, not you. Hello? Hello!

987
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,746
Health Canada says
all this food needs refrigeration,

988
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:35,683
but we got nowhere to store it. None of
the shelters are equipped for this.

989
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:37,751
We're getting three more truckloads
of food tonight.

990
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:40,671
- Stop 'em. We got nowhere to put it.
- Then what do we feed people?

991
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:42,673
We also need that girl
at Rogers to announce

992
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,591
that Rotary, hockey, Boys and Girls Club...

993
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:46,593
Canceled until further notice.

994
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:49,930
Hold on!
Did you just say that hockey's canceled?

995
00:48:50,514 --> 00:48:54,226
3:47 p.m. The town is asking
all bulk food deliveries be taken

996
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:56,562
to the Gander Community Center
hockey rink.

997
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:59,314
Since hockey's canceled,
the mayor is now calling it…

998
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:02,317
The world's largest walk-in refrigerator.

999
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:04,987
It's hot outside.

1000
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,657
So we stay in the bar
and make small talk with Matty, the owner,

1001
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,741
and his wife, Brenda.

1002
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:11,994
But we're not sure how much to say.

1003
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:14,037
You just don't know
where the red states are

1004
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:15,581
in a foreign country, right?

1005
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:19,585
But we had been drinking all afternoon,
and I accidentally say something like…

1006
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,795
Kevin and I have been together
for almost five years.

1007
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:24,047
In business.
We've been together in business.

1008
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:25,966
I'm his sexy-tary. Secretary.

1009
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:31,972
- It feels like the entire bar goes silent.
- I'm like, "Oh, God."

1010
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:34,433
- And then Matty says…
- You're… gay.

1011
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:38,437
- I'm about to pass out.
- But then Matty says…

1012
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,731
Well, praise be to God. My daughter's gay.

1013
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:42,482
And then Brenda says…

1014
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:44,401
Sure, my sister's gay.

1015
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:47,654
And the woman across the road just ran off
with her best friend.

1016
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:49,323
And then Brenda's brother says…

1017
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:52,075
Our uncle is 68 years old,

1018
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,288
and he just told us he's a bisexual.

1019
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:04,421
We somehow ended up
in the gayest town in Newfoundland.

1020
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,548
Kevin and I look at each other.

1021
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,967
I think I say,
"There must be something in the water."

1022
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:12,387
- And then Brenda's brother says…
- That's why I only drink the beer.

1023
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:17,726
Watching the news all day,
some of us are starting to lose it.

1024
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:22,731
So these people here, they decide to have
a big cookout for the whole community,

1025
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:25,776
just trying
to get our minds off of everything.

1026
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:28,237
And Derm, the mayor of Appleton,
says to me…

1027
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,074
Right, my son, do me a favor
and start to round up some grills.

1028
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:33,408
- Round up some grills?
- Yeah.

1029
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:36,078
Just go to people's yards
and take their grill.

1030
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:40,332
Take their grill?
Someone's gonna shoot me.

1031
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:42,251
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1032
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:44,920
Just go to people's yards
and grab their grill.

1033
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:49,299
So I'm going from yard to yard…

1034
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,762
and the whole time I keep thinking,
"Someone's gonna shoot me in the back."

1035
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,305
Hello there.

1036
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:56,807
Are you taking my barbecue?

1037
00:50:58,141 --> 00:50:59,810
- This is your barbecue?
- Yeah, buddy.

1038
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:01,645
Listen, I'm so sorry...

1039
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:04,064
The wife's got the kettle on,
if you want a cuppa.

1040
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:09,486
I get offered a cup of tea
in every single backyard.

1041
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,906
And most of 'em offer to help me
steal their own barbecues.

1042
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,785
We bring 'em all over
to the community center, no names on 'em.

1043
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,829
I don't know how they ever get 'em back.

1044
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:22,082
But that's how we have a big cookout,
completely free.

1045
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:24,918
After that, I stop worrying so much
about my wallet.

1046
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:26,545
8:45 a.m.

1047
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:28,422
- Thursday.
- September 13th.

1048
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:32,009
We've got a… situation
down at Gander Academy.

1049
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:36,388
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have an indelicate request.

1050
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,099
We need volunteers
to help clean the bathrooms.

1051
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:43,145
As you can imagine,
with 700 adults in a primary school...

1052
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:46,940
Health Canada needs us
to clean them every… hour and a half.

1053
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:50,277
We just don't have the people.
So we're asking for your help.

1054
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:53,447
But no one volunteers.

1055
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:56,742
No one comes. And we're run off our feet
with everything else.

1056
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:59,703
- And then…
- Sweet Jesus in the garden!

1057
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:03,624
This line of men comes walking
down the hall.

1058
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,253
The top six cardiologists
from all over the world,

1059
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:10,005
on their way to a conference.

1060
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:14,134
Highly qualified cardiologists.

1061
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:17,221
And they know about
the importance of cleanliness.

1062
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:22,142
If we don't get these bathrooms clean,
we're going to have…

1063
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,811
bigger problems.

1064
00:52:32,277 --> 00:52:34,446
Anyway, I get lunch set up,

1065
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,991
labeling anything that'll go bad
with the date and time.

1066
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:41,995
I let the pants out for one of the pilots
who's been enjoying our cooking,

1067
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,998
make a balloon animal
for a crying toddler,

1068
00:52:45,082 --> 00:52:48,544
and then I check on Hannah,
talking to anyone she can reach.

1069
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:53,423
I am here

1070
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:57,761
I am here on an island

1071
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:00,639
Hello? Hello. It's me again.

1072
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:03,892
Yeah, my son. He's with Rescue 2.

1073
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:05,018
Any news?

1074
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:08,146
I am his mother
I'm far away, stuck here

1075
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,440
I'm trying to find out if...

1076
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:12,109
Fine, I'll hold again.

1077
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:15,821
I should be down there
And checking the hospitals

1078
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:18,156
Putting up signs, doing something

1079
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,870
Instead, I am here

1080
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:26,456
I am here in Canada

1081
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,626
I am telling you, listen
My son, he takes risks

1082
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,296
He's not missing
He's helping or hurt

1083
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:33,755
He'll get out of this

1084
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,967
Yes, I'll keep trying
And, yes, here's the number

1085
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,511
And, yes
At the grade school in Gander

1086
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:40,637
I'll be here

1087
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:43,765
I should be there
When it's over and done

1088
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:48,228
When he comes through the door
And says, "I'm home, Mom"

1089
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,397
I should be there for my son

1090
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,776
But instead I am here

1091
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,447
I am here

1092
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,450
She leaves message after message
for her son

1093
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:04,286
until there's no more room
on his answering machine.

1094
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:10,125
All I know

1095
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:13,879
Is you are there

1096
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:17,591
You are there

1097
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:20,177
And I am here

1098
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,012
She finally got some news.

1099
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:24,806
They said it was Kev's day off.

1100
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:29,394
But someone else said there were more men
down there than were scheduled.

1101
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,898
I should be looking for him.

1102
00:54:34,066 --> 00:54:37,694
He's always there for me,
trying to make me laugh.

1103
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:40,989
Tells me stupid jokes. He loves jokes.

1104
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:45,077
Tells 'em to the kids at the firehouse
as he fixes their bikes.

1105
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:47,913
I should be there.

1106
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,959
I know there's nothing I can do to help.

1107
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,213
But I do know a few jokes.

1108
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,969
There was this sailor
who was stationed in the South Pacific,

1109
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:04,847
far away from his wife,
who he'd just married.

1110
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,849
And when he was away,
he wrote her a letter.

1111
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:10,894
He said,
"We're gonna be apart for a long time,

1112
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:15,774
and this island is full of young,
attractive local girls.

1113
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:17,860
I need something to take me mind off 'em."

1114
00:55:17,943 --> 00:55:20,487
So his wife sends him an accordion

1115
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:23,031
and says,
"Why don't you learn to play this then?"

1116
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:25,158
So finally he comes home
from his tour of duty

1117
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:28,620
and he says to his wife,
"I can't wait to get you into bed."

1118
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:31,623
And she says, "First, let's see
how well you play that accordion."

1119
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,630
That was a really stupid joke.

1120
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,008
Tell me another one.

1121
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,596
Everywhere you look
there are people from around the globe,

1122
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,224
going back and forth
for phones and showers,

1123
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:51,101
grabbing something from Shoppers.

1124
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:54,396
I'm getting a coffee
at a gas station on the main drag,

1125
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:56,607
when suddenly the entire place goes quiet.

1126
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:58,358
And nobody moves.

1127
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:02,070
Even the people outside are still.

1128
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:04,364
And I look up at the TVs…

1129
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,743
and I realize.

1130
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:12,456
It's a national moment of silence
in America.

1131
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,709
And all these Newfoundlanders,

1132
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:19,755
these people from another country,
they maintain that moment of silence.

1133
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,883
I don't know
if that would happen back home

1134
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:25,636
at a busy gas station on the main drag.

1135
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:29,389
But it happened here.

1136
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:33,143
Beulah walks me to church.

1137
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:36,730
And when we get there,
I light a candle for my son.

1138
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:38,065
And I do too.

1139
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:42,694
I suddenly realize what that music was
from my dream.

1140
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:45,572
It was an old hymn from when I was a kid.

1141
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:48,992
Well, I haven't been to church in years,

1142
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:52,454
but for some reason,
that song was in my head.

1143
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:58,293
Make me a channel of your peace

1144
00:56:58,877 --> 00:57:03,632
Where there is hatred
Let me bring your love

1145
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:08,679
Where there is injury
Your pardon, Lord

1146
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:12,850
And where there's doubt
True faith in you

1147
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:17,521
- Make me a channel of your peace
- Make me a channel of your peace

1148
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:19,606
Where there's despair in life
Let me bring hope

1149
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,984
Where there's despair in life
Let me bring hope

1150
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:26,905
- Where there is darkness, only light
- Where there is darkness, only light

1151
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:32,244
- And where there's sadness
- Ever joy

1152
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,514
There's a man here in town.

1153
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:54,725
He's lived here nearly his entire life.

1154
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:57,144
He heard that
there was a rabbi diverted here,

1155
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:59,354
and he came to find me
and tell me his story.

1156
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:01,899
I was born in Poland, I think.

1157
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:04,401
And my parents, they were Jews.

1158
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:06,904
They sent me here before the war started.

1159
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:09,656
I still remember
some of the prayers they taught me.

1160
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:16,538
As a boy, I was told I should never tell
anyone I was Jewish. Even my wife.

1161
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:22,211
But after what happened on Tuesday,
so many stories gone, just like that,

1162
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:24,087
I needed to tell someone.

1163
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:28,217
During al-fajr,
when most people are asleep,

1164
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,927
it is easier to pray.

1165
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:32,888
But at zuhr, I can feel them watching me.

1166
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:37,059
Sometimes I catch them
when they think I'm not looking,

1167
00:58:37,142 --> 00:58:39,394
and I can see the fear in their eyes.

1168
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:42,439
Excuse me.
Beulah wanted me to check on you.

1169
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:46,735
The library's open for anyone looking for
some peace and a quiet place to pray.

1170
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:12,803
O Master, grant that I may never seek

1171
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:17,558
So much to be consoled as to console

1172
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:22,479
To be understood as to understand

1173
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:28,986
To be loved
As to love with all my soul

1174
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:35,534
Make me a channel of your peace

1175
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:40,497
Where there's despair in life
Let me bring hope

1176
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:44,459
Where there is darkness, only light

1177
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:51,758
And where there's sadness, ever joy

1178
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:56,430
Health Canada finally lets the animals off
and quarantines them to hangar 1.

1179
00:59:56,513 --> 01:00:00,726
It's a big room
of cats and dogs and chimpanzees.

1180
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:02,603
There's barking and meowing,

1181
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:04,646
and then the chimps start
imitating the dogs,

1182
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:05,981
and they're barking too.

1183
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:08,668
The phones are ringing off the hook
with people who wanna see their pet.

1184
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,612
But they're not allowed
anywhere near the planes.

1185
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:14,198
And I am worried about Unga,
the pregnant bonobo.

1186
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:18,827
All animals are affected badly by stress,
not just humans.

1187
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:24,166
Some people spend their days
crammed inside, shoulder to shoulder,

1188
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:27,628
with nothing to do but watch the news
and wait for something to happen.

1189
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:28,712
On the edge

1190
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,673
We got the TVs going 24-7
in the cafeteria,

1191
01:00:31,757 --> 01:00:34,885
and the more they watch,
the more scared and angry they get.

1192
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:36,053
On the edge of the

1193
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:38,347
Some of the plane people haven't slept
in three days.

1194
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:42,017
None of us have either,
and we're jumping at our own shadows.

1195
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:44,228
On the edge of the world

1196
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:48,357
Around suppertime on Thursday,
people are waiting to use the phones,

1197
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,609
and there's a fight in the hallway.

1198
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:52,444
Hey. Hey, what the hell are you saying?

1199
01:00:52,528 --> 01:00:54,248
- I beg your pardon?
- You celebrating this?

1200
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:56,240
You praying for your friends?

1201
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:58,450
- Why doesn't he speak English?
- Excuse me?

1202
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:00,619
Telling your Muslim friends
where to bomb next?

1203
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:03,455
- This was not all Muslims. I wasn't...
- Go back where you came from!

1204
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:05,457
I'm Muslim, and I was born in Connecticut.

1205
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,543
- She's an American citizen!
- Don't look American!

1206
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:14,716
On the edge of the world
Or wherever we are

1207
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,510
We are, we are
We are on the edge

1208
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:18,196
Is there something?
I need to do something

1209
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,490
To keep me from thinking
Of all of those scenes on the tube

1210
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:22,450
I need something to do
'Cause I can't watch the news

1211
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:24,852
No, I can't watch the news anymore
On the edge

1212
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:27,688
The FAA keeps delaying
opening the airspace.

1213
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,816
And here on the ground we're dealing with
a whole mess of other problems.

1214
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:31,984
On the edge of the

1215
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:35,320
Some of the planes are parked on a runway
where the surface is all torn up.

1216
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:38,574
That debris gets into an engine,
and they'll never leave.

1217
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:39,992
On the edge of the world

1218
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:42,995
One of the big planes, a Triple Seven,
is sinking into the asphalt.

1219
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:45,238
If we don't do something,
she'll be stuck here forever.

1220
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:47,666
On the edge of the world
Or wherever we are

1221
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:50,586
We are, we are, we are on
We are, we are, we are

1222
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:51,753
We are on the edge!

1223
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:55,757
I interview a woman from Queens. A mother.

1224
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:59,011
Her son is a firefighter,
and they still can't account for him.

1225
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:01,597
She starts crying, and I start crying too.

1226
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,973
And I can't stop shaking.

1227
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:06,602
I don't know if I can do this anymore.

1228
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:09,938
I check in with Air Traffic Control again,
and it's more bad news.

1229
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:11,899
Not only is the airspace still closed,

1230
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:14,651
but there's a storm
headed for Newfoundland.

1231
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:18,363
Hurricane Erin is making landfall
tomorrow or the day after.

1232
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:21,491
If we don't get these planes
in the air soon, no one's going anywhere.

1233
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:25,120
- Claude, people are starting to crack.
- Let's get everyone down to the Legion.

1234
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:27,122
Everyone's going to the Legion
for a drink.

1235
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:29,875
Hi, have you seen my boyfriend?
His name's Kevin.

1236
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:32,127
He's about that tall,
and he's lost his mind.

1237
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:34,129
- I just wanna go out.
- Well, I don't.

1238
01:02:34,213 --> 01:02:37,007
- Well, I'm not going without you.
- Well, I'm not…

1239
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,884
staying for a long time.

1240
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,719
- One drink.
- One drink.

1241
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:42,763
Hannah, everyone's going out tonight.

1242
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:44,681
You go on without me, Beulah.

1243
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:46,266
I need to wait by the phone.

1244
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,643
I'll wait with you.

1245
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:51,188
I keep waiting to hear from the airline,
so I'll just be here by the phone, Tom,

1246
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:52,981
if the kids wanna speak with me.

1247
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:55,984
Bonnie?
I know you're not leaving the animals,

1248
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:57,819
so I brought you some chili.

1249
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:00,531
But I really think you should come home
and get some sleep...

1250
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:02,533
Doug! Get in here.

1251
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:07,454
We are about to have the first rare
bonobo chimpanzee born in Newfoundland!

1252
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:10,749
Beulah! They need some food
down at the Legion, if you can spare any.

1253
01:03:10,832 --> 01:03:13,001
Miss Beulah,
please let me help with the food.

1254
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:14,378
No, my love. You're a guest.

1255
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:18,590
Please. I am a master chef
for an international hotel chain.

1256
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:20,634
I oversee restaurants around the world.

1257
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,302
I would like to help with the food!

1258
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:23,512
Get in there!

1259
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:27,182
Everyone's going out to the bar.
And Nick is going.

1260
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:28,809
I'm going if Diane is going.

1261
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:32,938
And I think, "Nobody here knows me.
I can be whoever I wanna be."

1262
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:36,692
I'm not worried about my wallet.
I'm not worried about getting shot.

1263
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:39,945
I am a little worried
about how much Irish whiskey I'm drinking.

1264
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:45,742
By eight o'clock, the bar is completely
packed with people from around the world.

1265
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:48,996
Everybody's talking about where they're
staying and what they've seen,

1266
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:52,666
and the bar staff keep making runs
for more beer and liquor.

1267
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:56,795
After an hour,
people are swimming in the river out back.

1268
01:03:56,879 --> 01:03:59,590
And no, no one brought their swim trunks.

1269
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:03,051
Couple of the local boys get up
with their accordions and fiddles.

1270
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:05,262
And someone brings out an ugly stick.

1271
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:06,346
Yeah!

1272
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:26,783
Farewell to all you pretty ladies
Waving from the dock

1273
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,995
Heave away, me jollies
Heave away

1274
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:33,916
And if we do return to you
We'll make your cradles rock

1275
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:37,211
Heave away, me jolly boys
We're all bound away

1276
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:40,380
Farewell, you Newfoundlander boys
You're leaving us alone

1277
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:43,550
Heave away, me jollies
Heave away

1278
01:04:44,343 --> 01:04:47,679
And if you find another
We've got lovers of our own

1279
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:51,892
Heave away, me jolly boys
We're all bound away

1280
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:53,852
Then we get the karaoke going.

1281
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:57,356
Near, far

1282
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:02,569
Wherever we are

1283
01:05:03,946 --> 01:05:05,989
Then we decide to have
a bit of a ceremony.

1284
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:09,368
Let's make these people
honorary Newfoundlanders!

1285
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:13,247
Now, there's a solemn old tradition
For admission or audition

1286
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:15,249
To transition
From a come from away

1287
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:16,708
To be a Newfoundlander

1288
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:18,961
The only other way, at any rate

1289
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:20,838
Is pass away and pray to fate

1290
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:22,422
And wait to reincarnate

1291
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:23,757
As a Newfoundlander

1292
01:05:23,841 --> 01:05:27,386
Hey, hey, come on inside
Nothing ventured, nothing tried

1293
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:29,012
Only a couple of people cried

1294
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:30,764
You'll be a Newfoundlander

1295
01:05:30,848 --> 01:05:34,184
Hey, hey, sit down right there
You'll feel better in a year

1296
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,061
Try to ignore your doubts and fears

1297
01:05:36,144 --> 01:05:38,021
And you'll be a Newfoundlander

1298
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:40,691
Now we needs a couple of volunteers.

1299
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,860
Who wants to become a Newfoundlander?

1300
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:44,069
Right here!

1301
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:45,571
Good man! Who else?

1302
01:05:45,654 --> 01:05:48,323
I have no idea why I put up my hand.
And Kevin's like…

1303
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,951
Oh, my God. Are you serious?
Oh, my God. You are serious.

1304
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:52,202
Yes, I'm serious.

1305
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:54,086
- Don't do it if you don't want to.
- I won't.

1306
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:56,206
- Where you from, buddy?
- Los Angeles.

1307
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,958
LA! Who else?

1308
01:05:58,041 --> 01:06:00,502
Us! We wanna be Newfoundlanders.

1309
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:02,004
All right. Where you folks from?

1310
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:03,672
- Texas...
- Texas!

1311
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:05,883
- What part of Texas you from, buddy?
- No, no. I'm...

1312
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:09,178
- I'm from Texas. He's from England.
- Well, wait.

1313
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:10,971
- Now, how does that work?
- What?

1314
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,098
- How does what work?
- How does your marriage work?

1315
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,392
With you being in England, her in Texas.

1316
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,852
We're not married.

1317
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:18,979
I'm sorry. I assumed you were married.

1318
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:20,063
- No, no.
- No.

1319
01:06:20,147 --> 01:06:21,440
Well, would you like to be?

1320
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:23,692
Well, why not?

1321
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:29,364
Diane had had two beers by then,
so it was probably the alcohol talking.

1322
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:32,242
I've never had more than one beer
at a time before,

1323
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:34,411
so it's probably the alcohol talking.

1324
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:36,872
I went and got us two more beers.

1325
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:41,084
Now, the first part is the easiest
We'll soon get to the queasiest

1326
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:42,711
I'll need you to repeat this mess

1327
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,505
When you become a Newfoundlander

1328
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,340
'Cause we speaks
A different language, son

1329
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:48,008
We adds some esses and some rum

1330
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:50,010
You'll have to try a good cod tongue

1331
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:51,720
When you become a Newfoundlander

1332
01:06:51,803 --> 01:06:55,098
Hey, hey, just do your best
Nothing scary, nothing yet

1333
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:56,902
You'll have to change
The way you're dressed

1334
01:06:56,975 --> 01:06:58,644
And you'll be a Newfoundlander

1335
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:02,105
Hey, hey, just sing along
Nothing ventured, just prolonged

1336
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:05,901
- There's 30 verses in this song
- And you'll be a Newfoundlander

1337
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:09,530
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Screech.

1338
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:12,449
Back in World War II,
an officer was stationed here

1339
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:15,035
and was offered some of this stuff.

1340
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:18,455
All the locals were tossing it back
with nar' a quiver,

1341
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,583
so he does too
and lets out an ear-piercing…

1342
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,295
Everybody comes to see what's happened
and says…

1343
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,548
"What was that ungodly screech?"

1344
01:07:27,631 --> 01:07:29,550
And now it's your turn. Are you ready?

1345
01:07:29,633 --> 01:07:31,260
No, I'm not ready.

1346
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:32,344
No thank you.

1347
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,137
- All together now! One!
- One!

1348
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:35,055
- Two!
- Two!

1349
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:35,973
- Three!
- Three!

1350
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:37,266
Down the hatch!

1351
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:41,019
Screech is basically bad Jamaican rum.

1352
01:07:41,103 --> 01:07:42,563
Screech is horrific.

1353
01:07:42,646 --> 01:07:44,690
Screech is delicious!

1354
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:46,441
And then they brought the cod.

1355
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,360
The cod!

1356
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:50,696
- The cod?
- The cod!

1357
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:55,826
Now, with every transformation
Comes a tiny bit of risk

1358
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:57,160
You gotta walk the plank

1359
01:07:57,244 --> 01:07:59,204
And there'll be blood
Or there'll be bliss

1360
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:02,499
And it's the same to be a Newfoundlander
Every person's wish

1361
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:04,668
So don't be dumb
Just take the plunge

1362
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:06,461
Go on, kiss the fish

1363
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:08,088
I'm an islander, I am an islander…

1364
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:11,383
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a genuine
freshly caught Newfoundland cod.

1365
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:14,720
And if you want to become
an honorary Newfoundlander,

1366
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:16,513
you'll have to give her a smooch!

1367
01:08:16,596 --> 01:08:20,517
…I'm an islander, I am an islander…

1368
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,603
If you kiss that,
I will never kiss you again.

1369
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:25,522
- I'll risk it!
- Two!

1370
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:28,942
I am not kissing a fish!

1371
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:31,194
Come on! I will if you will.

1372
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:32,988
Oh, my God. Fine.

1373
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:34,072
…I am an islander…

1374
01:08:34,156 --> 01:08:35,741
Three!

1375
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:37,492
I can't do it.

1376
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:39,161
- Come on!
- What? I just did!

1377
01:08:39,243 --> 01:08:42,206
Now, you gotta kiss the cod.
It's a vital part of the ceremony.

1378
01:08:42,288 --> 01:08:43,290
I can't do it.

1379
01:08:43,372 --> 01:08:44,601
All right, look, I'll make you a deal.

1380
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,417
Either you kiss this fish

1381
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:49,254
or else you kiss this Englishman
that you're not married to.

1382
01:08:49,337 --> 01:08:50,756
- Wait, what?
- Okay.

1383
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:56,845
Hey, hey, come on tonight
Take a risk and take a ride

1384
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:58,555
Jump right in with both feet tied

1385
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:00,515
And you'll be a Newfoundlander

1386
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:03,727
Hey, hey, come on once more
Nothing ventured, nothing sore

1387
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,520
After it's over, out the door

1388
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:07,856
And you'll be a Newfoundlander

1389
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:10,399
After it's over

1390
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:12,778
You'll remember

1391
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:19,535
That you're a Newfoundlander

1392
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:28,001
Hey! Good job, LA.

1393
01:09:28,669 --> 01:09:29,752
Good night, now!

1394
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:32,130
Kevin?

1395
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:34,299
Where did you go?

1396
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:36,551
Kevin?

1397
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:47,813
My parents must have thought
They had a crazy kid

1398
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:55,946
'Cause I was one of those kids
Who always knew what I wanted

1399
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:01,451
They took me down to the airport
To see all the planes departing

1400
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:05,163
Watching them fly
Something inside of me was starting

1401
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:09,877
I was eight when I told 'em
That I'd be a pilot

1402
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:14,840
But I was too young and too short
And there were no female captains

1403
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:18,802
And my dad said, "Be patient"
He said, "Just see what happens"

1404
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:21,847
But I took my first lesson
Came down from the sky

1405
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,726
And told my father I'd fly
For the rest of my life

1406
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:29,229
And I got my first job
Flying for a mortician

1407
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:32,608
In a tiny Bonanza
Just a corpse and me

1408
01:10:32,691 --> 01:10:36,069
Five dollars an hour
For flying dead bodies

1409
01:10:36,153 --> 01:10:39,573
I had to climb over their faces
Just to get to my seat

1410
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:44,494
And suddenly the wheels lift off

1411
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:48,290
The ground is falling backwards

1412
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:54,129
I am suddenly alive

1413
01:10:54,213 --> 01:10:57,674
Suddenly I'm in the cockpit

1414
01:10:57,758 --> 01:11:01,220
Suddenly everything's changed

1415
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:04,306
Suddenly I'm not
Too young or too short

1416
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:08,227
And the passengers
In the back don't complain

1417
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:11,897
Suddenly I'm flying company charters

1418
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,442
Suddenly everything's high

1419
01:11:15,526 --> 01:11:18,278
Suddenly there's nothing in between

1420
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:22,574
Me and the sky

1421
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:31,542
American Airlines
Had the prettiest planes

1422
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:35,170
So I applied as a flight engineer

1423
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:39,007
But the World War II pilots
They all complained

1424
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:41,885
They said
"Girls shouldn't be in the cockpit"

1425
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:46,056
"Hey, lady. Hey, baby. Hey!
Why don't you grab us a drink?"

1426
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:49,226
And the flight attendants
Weren't my friends back then

1427
01:11:49,309 --> 01:11:52,771
And they said
"Are you better than us, do you think?"

1428
01:11:54,273 --> 01:11:57,526
But I kept getting hired

1429
01:11:57,609 --> 01:12:00,696
And the World War II crew
They retired

1430
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:05,409
And the girls all thought
Much higher of me

1431
01:12:05,492 --> 01:12:11,582
1986, the first female
American captain in history!

1432
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:15,377
Suddenly I'm in the cockpit

1433
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:18,755
Suddenly I've got my wings

1434
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:22,843
Suddenly all of those pilots
Protesting me

1435
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:25,137
Well, they can get their own drinks

1436
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:29,641
Suddenly there's no one saying
"Stay grounded"

1437
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:33,187
Looking down, passing them by

1438
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:38,859
Suddenly there's nothing in between
Me and the sky

1439
01:12:38,942 --> 01:12:42,404
Suddenly I've got an all-female crew

1440
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:46,074
The news caught
And made headlines across the world

1441
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:47,701
Suddenly it stopped

1442
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:49,369
- No one's saying
- "You can't"

1443
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:50,454
- Or
- "You won't"

1444
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:54,208
Or "You know you're not anything
'Cause you're a girl"

1445
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:56,793
Suddenly I'm getting married

1446
01:12:56,877 --> 01:13:01,256
And we're putting pins on a map
Where we've flown

1447
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:04,301
Suddenly I am a mother

1448
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:08,096
And suddenly shocked
At how much they've grown

1449
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:12,142
Suddenly I'm wondering
How my parents would feel

1450
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:15,312
Seeing me teaching men to be pilots

1451
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:18,774
'Cause suddenly I am
A senior instructor

1452
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:21,944
And somehow I'm 51

1453
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:25,864
Suddenly I'm flying Paris to Dallas

1454
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:29,159
Across the Atlantic and feeling calm

1455
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:32,871
When suddenly
Someone on air-to-air traffic says

1456
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:36,291
"At 8:46
There's been a terrorist action"

1457
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:39,169
And the one thing
I loved more than anything

1458
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:40,629
Was used as the bomb

1459
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:48,136
Suddenly I'm in a hotel

1460
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:55,143
Suddenly something has died

1461
01:13:56,103 --> 01:14:01,775
Suddenly there's something in between

1462
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:05,946
Me and the...

1463
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:11,076
Hello? I'm on my way.

1464
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:13,370
- 1:34 a.m.
- Friday.

1465
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:17,499
September 14th. Shelters will be alerted
as each plane is cleared to go.

1466
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:20,127
Our pilot says to pack up.

1467
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:24,464
It's sudden notice. Middle of the night,
and we're leaving in an hour.

1468
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:29,052
But these people,
they make these bag lunches

1469
01:14:29,136 --> 01:14:32,931
and form a gauntlet handing 'em out.

1470
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:35,976
And we all walk through it,
get our lunches

1471
01:14:36,059 --> 01:14:38,395
and say goodbye to all of 'em.

1472
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:40,689
We try to give 'em money,
but they won't take it.

1473
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:42,566
No, m'son. You would've done the same.

1474
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:45,360
- I drank all your whiskey.
- I would've done the same.

1475
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:47,946
Good morning.

1476
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:52,618
- You were snoring.
- My head hurts.

1477
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:54,036
You had a couple.

1478
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:56,288
Did I kiss the fish?

1479
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:57,831
What, don't you...

1480
01:14:57,915 --> 01:14:58,916
Yes, you did.

1481
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:01,126
Good. Wait...

1482
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,921
We're running out of time.
Our plane could be the next one to go.

1483
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,465
Our plane could be the next one to go.

1484
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:11,637
- Are you still upset that I kissed a fish?
- No.

1485
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,348
I'm upset because I left the bar
and you didn't even notice.

1486
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:16,826
- You left without telling me.
- After everything that's happened,

1487
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:19,353
you're out there acting like it's okay,
and it's not okay.

1488
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:20,521
I know!

1489
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:23,524
But I'm not just gonna shut myself inside.

1490
01:15:24,983 --> 01:15:27,152
Let's just get back to LA.

1491
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:30,197
While you're in Dallas,
I'd love to have you over.

1492
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,450
I tried to change my flight to New York.
They wouldn't do it.

1493
01:15:33,534 --> 01:15:36,578
My conference was canceled,
so I head back to London immediately.

1494
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:39,665
- I don't understand. Why would...
- I just need to be back home.

1495
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:42,209
- Back home.
- Back home?

1496
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,293
Back home?

1497
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:46,672
Well, all good things, right?

1498
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:51,885
As the plane people leave,
they keep stopping us, thanking us,

1499
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:54,388
trying to give us money. But we say...

1500
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,598
No, buddy. You would've done the same.

1501
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:59,601
But one guy keeps insisting
until Beulah finally tells him…

1502
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:04,356
Look, you can slip it
in the suggestion box down at town hall.

1503
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:07,109
But, honestly, we're happy
with a thank-you on your way out.

1504
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:10,696
Captain Bristol,
that pilot from Virgin Atlantic,

1505
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:13,699
he comes to find me
to help him round up his passengers.

1506
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:17,411
Annette, my darling.

1507
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:21,957
Before I leave, I need to thank you
for everything we've shared.

1508
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:26,128
Though I travel home today,
I leave my heart behind.

1509
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:28,922
- Annette!
- Don't.

1510
01:16:29,006 --> 01:16:30,007
Get...

1511
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,508
- Goodbye! Take care!
- Bye now!

1512
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:33,594
- Take care now!
- Tell us when the baby's born!

1513
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:35,429
Don't be a stranger!

1514
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,266
We get down to the airport,
and it's chaos.

1515
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:41,935
Passengers dropped off
from multiple flights.

1516
01:16:42,019 --> 01:16:43,478
Every bag has to be emptied.

1517
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,272
No scissors, no nail clippers.

1518
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:47,983
If any bags are unidentified,
they'll be blown up.

1519
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,485
Then someone says
there's issues with security.

1520
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:53,155
One of my flight attendants comes
to find me, and she says…

1521
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:54,990
There's a Muslim man on our flight.

1522
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:58,660
I saw him praying,
and he's been acting suspicious.

1523
01:16:59,536 --> 01:17:01,663
He doesn't have a carry-on, and...

1524
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:05,292
I'm not getting back on that plane
with him.

1525
01:17:07,878 --> 01:17:10,380
I arrive at the airport
and am pulled out of line.

1526
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:14,301
I am responsible for the safety
of my passengers and my crew.

1527
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:19,723
And Security tells me that any perceived
threats must be taken extremely seriously.

1528
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:23,310
They bring me into a private room,
and he's brought in for questioning.

1529
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:27,856
At first, I do not understand
what the police are asking.

1530
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:30,150
And then I do.

1531
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:34,321
In my culture, there is a word, awrah.

1532
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:37,574
The area between your stomach
and your knees.

1533
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:42,871
It is forbidden in my religion
for anyone to see this but my wife.

1534
01:17:42,955 --> 01:17:47,042
To have a woman in the room watching this,
watching me…

1535
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:50,087
You can't understand.

1536
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,923
It is the most thorough body search
I've ever witnessed.

1537
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:54,758
When it's over, I find him and tell him…

1538
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:57,344
I am so very sorry that happened.

1539
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:01,765
Am I free to go now?

1540
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:04,560
When are we leaving?

1541
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:07,604
Good morning!
We are one of the first flights to leave,

1542
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:10,232
which makes us one of the lucky ones,

1543
01:18:10,315 --> 01:18:13,235
as some planes may still be here
for quite some time.

1544
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:15,988
Now, I have no control over this.

1545
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:18,657
You have paid for a flight
from Paris to Dallas,

1546
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,076
and if I get clearance,
I'll take you to Dallas.

1547
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:25,163
But if I am not cleared for Dallas,
I have to take you back to France.

1548
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:28,125
But we will make arrangements
as quickly as we can

1549
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,877
to get y'all back to the United States

1550
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,212
- and where you need to be.
- No, no. I can't go back.

1551
01:18:32,296 --> 01:18:34,464
I just adopted my daughter,
and if I don't...

1552
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:39,011
Hey! Hey! We can vote on this!

1553
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:41,305
We can make 'em go where we wanna go.

1554
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:42,681
Well, who is for Dallas?

1555
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:44,975
Screw that! Who's for Switzerland?

1556
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:47,227
This is not a democracy!

1557
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:51,732
I am the captain, and this is coming
from American Airlines and the FAA.

1558
01:18:51,815 --> 01:18:54,484
You are not voting on our destination.

1559
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:58,280
Now, if we have any situation
that needs to be dealt with,

1560
01:18:58,363 --> 01:19:00,032
we will be pulled out of line,

1561
01:19:00,115 --> 01:19:02,910
and then we will be
the last flight to leave.

1562
01:19:04,745 --> 01:19:06,330
Thank you for your cooperation.

1563
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:11,335
After hours of waiting, they tell us
we're not leaving yet after all.

1564
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:15,756
4:18 p.m. There's a 747 with a flat tire
blocking the runway.

1565
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:17,841
All planes are stopped.

1566
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:18,926
No one's taking off.

1567
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:20,260
Welcome back!

1568
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:24,848
We're told by our pilot
to stay close to our shelter

1569
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:26,183
so we're ready to go again.

1570
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:28,602
But Diane wants to take
one last look round.

1571
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:31,522
And I can't let her go by herself.

1572
01:19:31,605 --> 01:19:35,359
And we find a gorgeous lookout.

1573
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:37,152
The Dover Fault.

1574
01:19:37,236 --> 01:19:39,446
There's about a million stairs.

1575
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,532
It's beautiful.

1576
01:19:41,615 --> 01:19:44,368
Nick! You gotta see this.

1577
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:45,953
Wow!

1578
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:48,080
I can't believe we're here.

1579
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:49,164
I know.

1580
01:19:49,248 --> 01:19:51,166
I can't believe we're leaving.

1581
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:52,835
I don't want to go.

1582
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:54,586
What did you say?

1583
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:57,548
I don't know. I...

1584
01:19:57,631 --> 01:19:59,299
I'm going to take a picture or two.

1585
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,468
Okay.

1586
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:07,558
Stop the world Take a picture

1587
01:20:07,641 --> 01:20:12,521
Try to capture
To ensure this moment lasts

1588
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:16,692
We're still in it
But in a minute

1589
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:21,530
That's the limit
And this present will be past

1590
01:20:21,613 --> 01:20:27,703
So here we are
Where the world has come together

1591
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:35,252
So here she'll be
In this picture forever

1592
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,130
Look at this.

1593
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:43,802
540 million years ago, the continents
of the world crashed together right here.

1594
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:47,055
And 200 million years ago,
they separated again,

1595
01:20:47,139 --> 01:20:48,849
moving apart from each other...

1596
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:52,769
But a little part of them was left behind.

1597
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:56,565
I should move.
You're missing all the scenery.

1598
01:20:56,648 --> 01:20:58,317
No, no, no. Stay where you are.

1599
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,278
- Really?
- Really. It's perfect.

1600
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:07,117
Stop the world Seize the moment

1601
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:11,371
But the minute he goes
You're alone and it's through

1602
01:21:11,455 --> 01:21:12,915
Pinch yourself

1603
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:16,168
Tell yourself
You're just dreaming

1604
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:19,004
That means he'll forget about you

1605
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:22,007
But here we are

1606
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:27,346
Where the continents
Once crashed together

1607
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:34,019
Before they went
Their separate ways forever

1608
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:36,563
- So stop the world
- Stop the world

1609
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:38,774
- Stop the world
- Stop the world

1610
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:42,903
- Stop the world
- From spinning round

1611
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:45,614
I'm on a lookout

1612
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:47,282
Overlooking something

1613
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:51,703
Worth taking the time
To stop flying by

1614
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:53,247
- And look down
- Stop the world

1615
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,749
- Stop being scared
- And look round

1616
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:57,501
- And look round
- Stop the world

1617
01:21:57,584 --> 01:21:59,878
- Just tell him now
- Just tell her now

1618
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:02,172
And look now

1619
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:04,591
Take a picture of the scenery

1620
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:08,512
Of a lookout
Of a moment which is over

1621
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:11,139
Of the ocean, of the river

1622
01:22:11,223 --> 01:22:14,935
Of the trees

1623
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:24,361
Stop the world please

1624
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,363
9:35 a.m.

1625
01:22:26,446 --> 01:22:28,448
- Saturday.
- September 15th.

1626
01:22:28,532 --> 01:22:31,368
Finally, they get the planes going again,

1627
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:34,162
and I go down to tell the Make-A-Wish kids

1628
01:22:34,246 --> 01:22:38,417
that they're being sent home
without getting to Disney World after all.

1629
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:42,087
But they're not sad about it.
They're going on hayrides, canoe rides,

1630
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:46,216
and someone dresses up as the town mascot,
Commander Gander.

1631
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,511
And it turns out
if they'd made it to Orlando,

1632
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:51,430
they would've had four days of rain.

1633
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:56,810
I am just doing one more litter scoop,
then I'll get them on their planes!

1634
01:22:58,061 --> 01:22:59,062
Lyle.

1635
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:01,523
You're a beautiful cat.

1636
01:23:01,607 --> 01:23:05,736
I taped your pill bottle to your carrier
and made sure someone will see it.

1637
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:07,738
You did good. You're gonna be fine.

1638
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:10,490
Yeah, Ralph, you're a good cocker spaniel.

1639
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:13,327
I know the night security crew
ran you a bit ragged,

1640
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:15,746
so I want you to get some sleep
on the plane, okay?

1641
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:18,540
Okay.

1642
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:21,919
Unga.

1643
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:27,007
I never met
a rare bonobo chimpanzee before.

1644
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:29,968
We don't get many of 'em
here in Newfoundland.

1645
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:33,180
And since your partner there likes
to throw his own feces,

1646
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:37,142
I'm gonna say you're the nicest
rare bonobo chimpanzee I ever met.

1647
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:40,229
And I want you to know I'm sorry.

1648
01:23:41,355 --> 01:23:43,398
I'm sorry you lost your baby.

1649
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:50,656
I got three. Some days
they are more trouble than they are worth.

1650
01:23:53,075 --> 01:23:55,786
Anyway, you're gonna be okay.

1651
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,291
The winds start to pick up.
50-mile-an-hour winds.

1652
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,709
We have been here too long.

1653
01:24:02,793 --> 01:24:05,170
We're still on the ground,
there's a hurricane coming,

1654
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:07,548
and I'm thinking,
"We're running out of time."

1655
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:10,050
We have to leave. We have to leave now.

1656
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:13,428
One plane, then another

1657
01:24:13,512 --> 01:24:16,932
And then nine planes, then another

1658
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:21,103
- And then 13 planes, then another
- Nineteen planes, then another

1659
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:24,606
- Twenty-two, twenty-four
- Twenty-nine, thirty-two

1660
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:27,693
- Thirty-eight, thirty-eight
- Thirty-eight, thirty-eight

1661
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,838
- Thirty-eight, thirty-eight
- Thirty-eight, thirty-eight

1662
01:24:29,862 --> 01:24:31,655
Thirty, thirty, thirty-eight planes

1663
01:24:31,738 --> 01:24:34,867
Ladies and gentlemen
If you look out your windows

1664
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:38,537
Underneath all that rain is Maine

1665
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,082
We've just crossed the Canadian border

1666
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:48,672
Welcome back to the US of A!

1667
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:51,508
Looking out the window
At the world underneath

1668
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:55,304
And though he's here next to me
In a second, he'll go

1669
01:24:55,387 --> 01:24:58,098
- Looking out the window
- Kevin, talk to me, please

1670
01:24:58,182 --> 01:25:02,603
- And out the window we see
- A place we all know below

1671
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:04,563
Is this on? It's on.

1672
01:25:04,646 --> 01:25:06,190
Sorry, everyone... Hi!

1673
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:09,610
Like most everyone
I am sorry saying goodbye

1674
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:12,779
So I wanted to thank them
For all that they did

1675
01:25:12,863 --> 01:25:16,200
So I'm doing just that
And I'm passing a hat

1676
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:18,869
For the people who gave up their time

1677
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:20,579
And they gave up their town

1678
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:24,625
So let's give 'em a scholarship
Pass the hat down, 'cause

1679
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:30,088
Somewhere
In the middle of nowhere

1680
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:34,092
- In the middle of who-knows-where
- Who knows

1681
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:38,222
There you'll find

1682
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:43,769
Something
In the middle of nowhere

1683
01:25:43,852 --> 01:25:47,397
In the middle of clear, blue air

1684
01:25:47,481 --> 01:25:53,237
You found your heart
But left a part of you behind

1685
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:57,324
Nick and I sit together,
and I just... I wanna say something,

1686
01:25:57,407 --> 01:25:58,951
but we're leaving, and it's over.

1687
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:01,161
Then she starts crying.
I don't know what to say.

1688
01:26:01,245 --> 01:26:04,790
So I just put my arm round her and go to
kiss her on the forehead to comfort her.

1689
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:06,625
Well, and there was some turbulence,

1690
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:09,336
and, honestly,
I just thought he missed. So I…

1691
01:26:12,297 --> 01:26:15,467
Ladies and gentlemen
If you look out your windows

1692
01:26:15,551 --> 01:26:19,054
You won't wanna miss this
We just entered Texas!

1693
01:26:19,137 --> 01:26:21,181
- Somewhere
- Somewhere

1694
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:24,476
- In the middle of nowhere
- Nowhere

1695
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,605
- In the middle of who-knows-where
- Who knows

1696
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:32,568
- There you'll find
- Find something in the middle of

1697
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:34,736
- Something
- Something

1698
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:38,198
- In the middle of nowhere
- Nowhere

1699
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:41,743
In the middle of clear, blue air

1700
01:26:41,827 --> 01:26:47,916
You found your heart
But left a part of you behind

1701
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,544
Everyone's drinking and comparing stories.

1702
01:26:50,627 --> 01:26:52,337
Where did you stay? What did you do?

1703
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:56,216
But mostly Nick and I spend the
plane ride home canoodling in the back.

1704
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,844
At one point,
a flight attendant comes round saying…

1705
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:00,137
Hot towel?

1706
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,221
Hot towel?

1707
01:27:02,014 --> 01:27:03,182
Cold towel?

1708
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:05,767
Somewhere in between

1709
01:27:05,851 --> 01:27:07,895
The pace of life and work
And where you're going

1710
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:10,981
Something makes you stop and notice
And you're finally in the moment

1711
01:27:11,064 --> 01:27:16,695
Somewhere
In the middle of nowhere

1712
01:27:16,778 --> 01:27:20,782
- In the middle of who-knows-where
- Who knows

1713
01:27:20,866 --> 01:27:24,995
There you'll find

1714
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:27,164
- Something
- Something

1715
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:30,501
- In the middle of nowhere
- Nowhere

1716
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:34,046
In the middle of clear, blue air

1717
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:38,675
You found your heart
But left a part of you behind

1718
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:42,429
Ladies and gentlemen
Put your seats back and tray tables up

1719
01:27:42,513 --> 01:27:45,807
Right below us is
The city where I grew up

1720
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:48,852
Coming round, past the field
Then the wheels touch the ground

1721
01:27:48,936 --> 01:27:50,312
- Taxiing
- Home, America

1722
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:52,356
- We're all cheering, we're down
- Home in America

1723
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:53,941
- Thanking everyone
- Home, America

1724
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:55,960
- "Thank you for flying American"
- Home in America

1725
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:57,795
- Hugging them, hugging my crew
- Home, America

1726
01:27:57,819 --> 01:27:59,422
- 'Cause we're home again
- Home in America

1727
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:01,246
- Past the gate, up the stairs
- Home, America

1728
01:28:01,323 --> 01:28:03,158
- And we're there
- Home in America

1729
01:28:03,242 --> 01:28:08,372
- And he's waiting in line
- Home

1730
01:28:12,835 --> 01:28:14,962
No, I'm fine, Tom

1731
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:19,675
I'm fine

1732
01:28:19,758 --> 01:28:21,885
- So…
- So…

1733
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:23,178
So you'll call?

1734
01:28:23,262 --> 01:28:24,429
As soon as I get back.

1735
01:28:25,848 --> 01:28:27,891
- And then she left.
- And then he left.

1736
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:29,476
And then I was alone.

1737
01:28:30,811 --> 01:28:34,314
Back to the way that things were

1738
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:38,443
Back to the simple and plain

1739
01:28:39,695 --> 01:28:43,657
For five days
The weather had been so nice

1740
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:50,581
But as they boarded
It started to rain

1741
01:28:58,422 --> 01:29:02,467
At the end of the day
After everyone left

1742
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:07,514
We all tried to go back to normal
Except

1743
01:29:07,598 --> 01:29:12,144
The town was more quiet
And somehow far emptier

1744
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:16,565
We all looked the same
But we're different than we were

1745
01:29:16,648 --> 01:29:20,068
The gym was a sight
As I stacked the last cot

1746
01:29:21,278 --> 01:29:24,823
Thank-yous written everywhere
And things they forgot

1747
01:29:25,449 --> 01:29:29,453
The board of health says
"Clean it up, every part"

1748
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:30,829
So we start

1749
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:32,748
7:42 a.m.

1750
01:29:32,831 --> 01:29:34,875
- Sunday.
- September 16th.

1751
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:40,797
After five days, they just ran the Zamboni
over the ice and played hockey.

1752
01:29:41,965 --> 01:29:43,467
With the plane people gone,

1753
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:46,678
I tell my staff,
"Go home. Get some sleep."

1754
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:49,473
We were all exhausted, just spent.

1755
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:52,518
Most of us had been up
for five days straight, working.

1756
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:54,269
But somehow I can't sleep.

1757
01:29:54,353 --> 01:29:58,190
So I sit down, turn on the television,
and I just start crying.

1758
01:29:58,774 --> 01:30:01,026
I hadn't let myself cry the whole time.

1759
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:07,407
Something's gone

1760
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:09,660
Out the airplane window,
I can see Manhattan,

1761
01:30:09,743 --> 01:30:10,869
and there's still smoke.

1762
01:30:10,953 --> 01:30:13,205
And suddenly I'm afraid all over again.

1763
01:30:13,288 --> 01:30:15,082
And there are others afraid too.

1764
01:30:15,165 --> 01:30:18,836
Something's over

1765
01:30:18,919 --> 01:30:20,879
I know Newark Airport.

1766
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:23,340
You could pull a truck over
on the side of the turnpike

1767
01:30:23,423 --> 01:30:26,593
and shoot a grenade launcher
at a plane coming in.

1768
01:30:26,677 --> 01:30:31,098
Something's done

1769
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:33,100
But nothing happens.

1770
01:30:34,184 --> 01:30:38,438
I drive Kevin back to his place.
We don't say much.

1771
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:42,943
Something's missing

1772
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:45,487
I go straight to his firehouse.

1773
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:48,365
Part of me wondered
if they just weren't telling me.

1774
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:50,158
But they still don't know.

1775
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:54,496
Something's changed

1776
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:57,416
My flat is the same as I left it,
but emptier.

1777
01:30:57,499 --> 01:30:58,542
Quieter.

1778
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:01,670
I start to unpack, and I find the camera.

1779
01:31:01,753 --> 01:31:06,216
Something's rearranged

1780
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,802
On the way to my restaurant,
I drop my daughter at school.

1781
01:31:08,886 --> 01:31:11,471
But she won't go in.
She says she's scared.

1782
01:31:12,389 --> 01:31:13,640
What do I tell her?

1783
01:31:13,724 --> 01:31:17,561
Something's strained

1784
01:31:17,644 --> 01:31:20,272
Back at my dad's house,
I look out the window

1785
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:22,316
at this view I've looked at my whole life.

1786
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:25,444
And now a part of it… Something's missing.

1787
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:29,990
Something's missing

1788
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:31,200
Kevin breaks up with me.

1789
01:31:31,283 --> 01:31:33,869
And then he quits
and moves back home to New York.

1790
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:35,120
And I miss him.

1791
01:31:35,954 --> 01:31:37,372
I miss his jokes.

1792
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:41,585
Something's lost

1793
01:31:41,668 --> 01:31:45,047
Nick and I call each other when we can,
but it's awful.

1794
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:48,425
The only reason we met was
because this terrible thing happened.

1795
01:31:48,509 --> 01:31:52,721
Some things cost

1796
01:31:52,804 --> 01:31:55,432
I go down to ground zero, which...

1797
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,354
It's like the end of the world.
It's literally still burning!

1798
01:32:00,437 --> 01:32:04,233
Something's not

1799
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:07,361
My dad asks, "Were you okay
out where you were stranded?"

1800
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:12,157
How do I tell him I wasn't just okay,
I was so much better?

1801
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:18,789
Something's missing

1802
01:32:19,498 --> 01:32:22,709
I phone American and say, "I'm ready to go
wherever you want to send me."

1803
01:32:22,793 --> 01:32:24,837
But they say, "Take a few days off."

1804
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,216
I phone every day,
and I am back in the airport by Thursday…

1805
01:32:30,384 --> 01:32:31,760
and it's empty.

1806
01:32:31,844 --> 01:32:35,013
Silent. It's just a different place.

1807
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:37,599
And I stop what few passengers there are,
and I say,

1808
01:32:37,683 --> 01:32:39,935
"Thank you for still flying."

1809
01:32:41,812 --> 01:32:45,232
Hello. You've reached Gander Academy.
This is Beulah Davis.

1810
01:32:46,692 --> 01:32:47,860
How can I help you?

1811
01:32:50,279 --> 01:32:51,697
He's gone.

1812
01:32:54,116 --> 01:32:55,409
It's over.

1813
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:56,869
Oh, no.

1814
01:32:58,412 --> 01:32:59,788
I'm so sorry, Hannah.

1815
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:02,791
I'm so sorry.

1816
01:33:05,794 --> 01:33:10,299
You are here

1817
01:33:10,382 --> 01:33:13,218
At the end of a moment

1818
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:17,472
At the end of the world

1819
01:33:18,015 --> 01:33:21,894
You are here

1820
01:33:21,977 --> 01:33:24,897
On the edge of the ocean

1821
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:27,649
Where the story ends

1822
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:30,986
Where the river meets the sea

1823
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:33,739
- Here
- Something's gone

1824
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:36,658
- Across the Atlantic
- Something's over

1825
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:39,411
- At the office
- In an airport

1826
01:33:39,494 --> 01:33:40,495
In my house

1827
01:33:40,579 --> 01:33:42,372
- On an island
- Something's rearranged

1828
01:33:42,456 --> 01:33:45,042
- In a classroom
- At the station

1829
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:46,460
In my car

1830
01:33:46,543 --> 01:33:52,341
- And wherever you are
- Something's gone

1831
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:59,264
You are here

1832
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:10,943
When Gander Town Council declares
the state of emergency over,

1833
01:34:11,026 --> 01:34:12,778
it means everything goes back to normal.

1834
01:34:12,861 --> 01:34:13,695
- Garth.
- Claude!

1835
01:34:13,779 --> 01:34:14,613
- Look.
- Look.

1836
01:34:14,696 --> 01:34:17,824
- Look at it from my perspective.
- Will you look at it from my perspective?

1837
01:34:17,908 --> 01:34:21,161
- We've been coming to the table.
- We've been coming to the table too!

1838
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:22,246
Jesus!

1839
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:25,207
- Morning, Crystal.
- Morning, Mr. Mayor.

1840
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:26,458
- Pepsi? Yeah.
- That's right.

1841
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:28,669
- Morning, Dwight.
- Morning, Claude. Garth, Crystal.

1842
01:34:28,752 --> 01:34:30,504
Claude, Crystal, Dwight. Garth. Morning.

1843
01:34:30,587 --> 01:34:31,898
- Morning, boys.
- Morning, Janice.

1844
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:32,756
- Janice.
- Janice.

1845
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:33,841
- Janice.
- Janice.

1846
01:34:33,924 --> 01:34:35,801
- What's the news?
- Strike still on?

1847
01:34:35,884 --> 01:34:38,929
- Well, we're coming to the table.
- Well, we're coming to the table too.

1848
01:34:39,012 --> 01:34:41,139
- They tearing down the airport?
- Not today.

1849
01:34:41,223 --> 01:34:43,475
Mr. Mayor, I saw your car in the lot.

1850
01:34:43,559 --> 01:34:45,394
You might want to get down to town hall.

1851
01:34:45,477 --> 01:34:47,563
We just opened the suggestion box.

1852
01:34:47,646 --> 01:34:51,525
When the bank finally converted
all the currency from around the world,

1853
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:55,320
people had donated over $60,000.

1854
01:34:55,404 --> 01:34:58,991
Every day for months,
passengers sent back chocolates, flowers…

1855
01:34:59,074 --> 01:35:00,909
Donations of all kinds.

1856
01:35:00,993 --> 01:35:03,328
Postcards and letters came in
from everywhere.

1857
01:35:03,412 --> 01:35:04,830
"Dear Miss Beulah,

1858
01:35:04,913 --> 01:35:08,125
When my daughter asks about
what happened to me over those five days,

1859
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:10,169
I tell her about your kindness.

1860
01:35:10,252 --> 01:35:13,172
Thank you again. Sincerely, Ali.

1861
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:16,550
Please send me the recipe
for the fish and the cheese."

1862
01:35:17,718 --> 01:35:21,013
Ralph the cocker spaniel went on to become
a champion show dog!

1863
01:35:21,096 --> 01:35:25,517
And Unga the rare bonobo chimpanzee
arrived safely at the Columbus Zoo.

1864
01:35:25,601 --> 01:35:29,438
And soon after, she had a baby,
which they named Gander.

1865
01:35:30,272 --> 01:35:33,108
Tom Brokaw phones me. Tom Brokaw.

1866
01:35:33,192 --> 01:35:36,361
He's doing a documentary,
and since I was the only reporter in town,

1867
01:35:36,445 --> 01:35:38,155
I'm the only one with any footage.

1868
01:35:38,906 --> 01:35:40,407
Tom Brokaw.

1869
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,868
It was a big break,

1870
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:45,537
but I didn't really like
shoving microphones into people's faces

1871
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:48,248
when they were going through so much,
so I stayed here in Gander.

1872
01:35:48,332 --> 01:35:51,210
And I'm still here today
on the tenth anniversary.

1873
01:35:52,085 --> 01:35:55,255
I'm reporting live from Newfoundland
for BBC.

1874
01:35:55,339 --> 01:35:56,548
- CBC.
- CTV.

1875
01:35:56,632 --> 01:35:57,633
Al Jazeera.

1876
01:35:57,716 --> 01:36:00,761
For Rogers TV,
I'm Janice Mosher on September 11th.

1877
01:36:00,844 --> 01:36:01,970
2011.

1878
01:36:02,054 --> 01:36:04,723
The town is again filled
with come from aways.

1879
01:36:04,806 --> 01:36:07,309
On the tenth anniversary,
from all around the world,

1880
01:36:07,392 --> 01:36:09,520
we welcome back the plane people.

1881
01:36:09,603 --> 01:36:12,439
- One, two…
- One, two, three, four!

1882
01:36:12,523 --> 01:36:14,942
Welcome to the friends
Who have come from away

1883
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:16,401
- Hep!
- Welcome to the locals

1884
01:36:16,485 --> 01:36:18,153
- Who have always said they'd stay
- Hep!

1885
01:36:18,237 --> 01:36:21,031
If you're coming from Toledo
Or you're coming from Taipei

1886
01:36:21,114 --> 01:36:24,660
- Because we come from everywhere
- We all come from away

1887
01:36:24,743 --> 01:36:26,745
- Welcome to the rock
- I'm an islander

1888
01:36:26,828 --> 01:36:28,288
I am an islander

1889
01:36:28,372 --> 01:36:31,083
I'm an islander I am an islander

1890
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:34,211
I'm an islander I am an islander

1891
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:36,839
I'm an islander I am an islander

1892
01:36:36,922 --> 01:36:39,508
Welcome to our island
With its inlets and its bays

1893
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:42,427
You could keep on heading east
But there's an ocean in the way

1894
01:36:42,511 --> 01:36:45,347
Where everything is meant to be
But nothing goes as planned

1895
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:48,767
And the drunkest fellas in the room
Are playing in the band

1896
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:51,979
Welcome to the rock

1897
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:55,899
With all the new security,

1898
01:36:55,983 --> 01:36:58,277
kids aren't even allowed
up to the cockpit anymore.

1899
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,987
Of course, on my retirement flight,

1900
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:03,782
I brought my whole family up
to the cockpit on our way back to Gander.

1901
01:37:03,866 --> 01:37:06,159
I came back
with the scholarship money we raised,

1902
01:37:06,243 --> 01:37:07,744
now worth over a million dollars.

1903
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:11,665
I bring out the Irish whiskey,
and we have ourselves a toast.

1904
01:37:11,748 --> 01:37:15,335
Nick and I just couldn't make
the long-distance relationship work.

1905
01:37:15,419 --> 01:37:17,921
So I moved to Texas, and then I proposed.

1906
01:37:18,005 --> 01:37:20,591
And we honeymooned in Newfoundland.

1907
01:37:21,341 --> 01:37:24,344
- My new secretary's name is Robin.
- What's up?

1908
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:27,639
Every year on September 11th,
I close my office

1909
01:37:27,723 --> 01:37:32,603
and give each employee $100 to go and do
random good deeds for strangers.

1910
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:35,689
It's my way of remembering what happened.

1911
01:37:35,772 --> 01:37:38,775
Beulah and I still keep in touch.

1912
01:37:38,859 --> 01:37:41,069
She even came to visit me in New York.

1913
01:37:41,153 --> 01:37:43,947
And I'll still phone her
if I hear a really stupid joke.

1914
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:48,076
Beulah, why are Newfoundlanders terrible
at knock-knock jokes?

1915
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,536
I don't know, Hannah.

1916
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,914
Well, try it. I'll be a Newfoundlander.

1917
01:37:51,997 --> 01:37:52,998
Knock, knock.

1918
01:37:53,081 --> 01:37:54,958
Come on in. The door's open.

1919
01:37:56,418 --> 01:37:59,129
The donation we are most honored by
just arrived today.

1920
01:37:59,213 --> 01:38:02,508
It's about four meters long
and 1,200 kilograms.

1921
01:38:02,591 --> 01:38:05,636
Newfoundland is one of the only places
outside of the United States

1922
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:08,013
where we share the steel
from the World Trade Center.

1923
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:12,684
On the northeast tip of North America,
on an island called Newfoundland,

1924
01:38:12,768 --> 01:38:14,102
there's a airport.

1925
01:38:14,186 --> 01:38:17,940
And next to it is a town called Gander.

1926
01:38:18,023 --> 01:38:20,526
Tonight we honor what was lost.

1927
01:38:20,609 --> 01:38:23,737
But we also commemorate what we found.

1928
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:27,199
You are here

1929
01:38:27,282 --> 01:38:30,118
At the start of a moment

1930
01:38:30,202 --> 01:38:32,955
On the edge of the world

1931
01:38:33,038 --> 01:38:36,542
Where the river meets the sea

1932
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:38,794
Here

1933
01:38:38,877 --> 01:38:41,213
On the edge of the Atlantic

1934
01:38:41,797 --> 01:38:45,759
On an island in between

1935
01:38:45,843 --> 01:38:50,722
- There and here
- I'm an islander, I am an islander

1936
01:38:50,806 --> 01:38:53,642
- I'm an islander, I am an islander
- There and here

1937
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:56,478
I'm an islander I am an islander

1938
01:38:56,562 --> 01:38:59,398
- I'm an islander, I am an islander
- There and here

1939
01:38:59,481 --> 01:39:02,192
I'm an islander I am an islander

1940
01:39:02,276 --> 01:39:05,195
I'm an islander I am an islander

1941
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:06,530
Welcome to the fog

1942
01:39:06,613 --> 01:39:07,614
Welcome to the trees

1943
01:39:07,698 --> 01:39:10,617
A kiss and a cod
And whatever's in between

1944
01:39:10,701 --> 01:39:13,704
To the ones who've left
You're never truly gone

1945
01:39:13,787 --> 01:39:16,373
A candle's in the window
And the kettle's always on

1946
01:39:16,456 --> 01:39:19,168
To the coves and the caves
And the people from the planes

1947
01:39:19,251 --> 01:39:20,711
- Five days.
- Nineteen animals.

1948
01:39:20,794 --> 01:39:22,504
And 7,000 strays.

1949
01:39:22,588 --> 01:39:25,132
When the sun is setting
And it's darker than before

1950
01:39:25,215 --> 01:39:28,010
If you're hoping for a harbor
Then you'll find an open door

1951
01:39:28,093 --> 01:39:30,679
In the winter, from the water
Through whatever's in the way

1952
01:39:30,762 --> 01:39:32,848
To the ones who have come from away

1953
01:39:32,931 --> 01:39:34,099
We say welcome to the

1954
01:39:34,183 --> 01:39:36,768
Welcome to the, welcome to the
Welcome to the, welcome to the

1955
01:39:36,852 --> 01:39:38,896
Welcome to the, welcome to the rock!

1956
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:18,013
Welcome to the townies
And the come from aways

1957
01:42:18,096 --> 01:42:20,349
Welcome to the locals
Who have always said they'd stay

1958
01:42:20,432 --> 01:42:23,268
My father's father's father
Crashed his ship into this rock

1959
01:42:23,352 --> 01:42:25,812
Heaven and hell don't matter much
'Cause it's here I'm stuck

1960
01:42:25,896 --> 01:42:28,315
Welcome to the rock
Welcome to Newfoundland

1961
01:42:28,398 --> 01:42:30,859
It's farther to Manhattan
Than it is to Ireland

1962
01:42:30,943 --> 01:42:33,570
They say no man's an island
But an island makes a man

1963
01:42:33,654 --> 01:42:36,114
Especially when one comes
From one like Newfoundland

1964
01:42:36,198 --> 01:42:38,742
I'm an islander I am an islander

1965
01:42:38,825 --> 01:42:41,328
I'm an islander I am an islander

1966
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:43,914
I'm an islander I am an islander

1967
01:42:43,997 --> 01:42:46,458
I'm an islander I am an islander

1968
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:49,002
Welcome to the wildest weather
That you've ever heard of

1969
01:42:49,086 --> 01:42:51,505
Where everyone is nicer
But it's never nice above

1970
01:42:51,588 --> 01:42:54,132
'Cause it's mauzy or it's misky
Or it's muddy or it's scad

1971
01:42:54,216 --> 01:42:56,677
And when it's finally sunny
It's a sign it's getting bad

1972
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,221
Welcome to the rock
Welcome to Newfoundland

1973
01:42:59,304 --> 01:43:01,932
The drunkest fellas in the room
Are playing in the band

1974
01:43:02,015 --> 01:43:04,518
Welcome to the farthest place
You'll get from Disneyland

1975
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:09,398
Fish and chips and shipwrecks
This is Newfoundland

1976
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:30,043
Welcome to the land
Where the winters tried to kill us

1977
01:43:30,127 --> 01:43:32,963
- And we said
- We will not be killed

1978
01:43:33,046 --> 01:43:35,257
Welcome to the land
Where the waters tried to drown us

1979
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:38,051
- And we said
- We will not be drowned

1980
01:43:38,135 --> 01:43:40,345
Welcome to the land
Where we lost our loved ones

1981
01:43:40,429 --> 01:43:43,265
- And we said
- We will still go on

1982
01:43:43,348 --> 01:43:45,601
Welcome to the land
Where the winds tried to blow

1983
01:43:45,684 --> 01:43:47,853
And we said no

1984
01:43:47,936 --> 01:43:52,816
In the winter, from the water
Through the wind

1985
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:57,112
If a stranger ends up at our door

1986
01:43:57,196 --> 01:44:02,242
We welcome them in

1987
01:44:02,326 --> 01:44:07,664
We welcome them in

1988
01:44:07,748 --> 01:44:09,041
I am an islander

1989
01:44:09,124 --> 01:44:11,210
Welcome to the cod
And to the trees and to the fog

1990
01:44:11,293 --> 01:44:13,712
And to the ferries and the berries
And the failing fisheries

1991
01:44:13,795 --> 01:44:15,475
And to kitchen parties
To the ones departed

1992
01:44:15,506 --> 01:44:16,816
In our hearts
We know you'll never

1993
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:19,009
Leave this little bit of heaven
Where we started

1994
01:44:19,092 --> 01:44:21,512
To the down
And the out of town on quads

1995
01:44:21,595 --> 01:44:24,275
And thanks to God we are the poorest
But the richest where it counts

1996
01:44:24,306 --> 01:44:26,642
And to the St. John's girls
With their sails unfurled

1997
01:44:26,725 --> 01:44:28,894
To our friends at the end of the world
We say

1998
01:44:28,977 --> 01:44:30,395
Welcome to the rock!
