Her son was in kindergarten

The report is based on the statements
more than 60 children. And some

24
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,553
Currently only 2 years old.
You should a dreadful secret

keep  itself.
This was now revealed.

26
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,033

Look at this.

33
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,997
You shall not see this.
- To me there is nothing more

34
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,039
As the smiles and love
a small child.

35
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,113
Sorry, I could
talk and talk, because there is for me

36
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,113
Just one topic: the children.
- But last August

37
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,113
Fell Judy Johnson in that her son,
one of the kindergarten children,

38
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,796
Redness on his buttocks had
and suffered from nightmares.

39
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,715
She accused the grandson
Virginia McMartin, Raymond Buckey,

40
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,918
Which can be seen here at the Halloween Festival
kindergarten.

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,595
Raymond Buckey.
On... all concerned parents

42
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,070
to consult  their children,
whether they sexually abused

43
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,073
Forced to oral sex or...
- This is absolutely disgusting,

44
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,674
Not you think?
- Well, guess

45
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,073
Who have taken them as a defender.
- Danny, no! But not these people!

46
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,073
... That is nothing more happened.
But then let the District Attorney

47
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,073
Interview the children again,
namely by the recognized therapist

48
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,630
For child abuse Kee McFarlane.
It comes from CII,

49
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,633
The Children's Institute International.
Using play therapy sessions,

50
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,633
The receive video, they already brought
hundreds of children to

51
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,191
Gruesome examples
to talk about sexual abuse.

52
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,432
I think we should not underestimate,
how scared you can frighten children

53
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,433
Who are helpless. I am now
for 13 years in this business sector

54
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,274
And have never experienced anything like it.
It's just horrible!

55
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,750
Educators have mutilated
animals before their eyes.

56
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,992
Oh God! The poor baby.
... Their parents inflict the same.

57
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,993
No wonder they tell you anything!
- Danny, no later than tomorrow morning

58
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,915
Is everywhere topic no. 1!
- I hope so. What an event!

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,959
You are not afraid that their parents are killed
. There are indeed the Dolls

60
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,953
Everything betrayed and not them.
- We examine the case for weeks,

61
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,953
But I always get goose bumps.
- Did you think at times of the parents?

62
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,953
How guilty and how deceived
that must feel. Oh God,

63
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,669
They have entrusted their children
these people.

64
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,833
Because you want to be like prosecutor.
- To the dismay of many parents

65
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,515
Located but Ray Buckey
still at large.

66
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,229
The Grand Jury today...
- Ok, Kelly. I'll take the case.

67
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,756
You're crazy to do that!
And sweaty.

68
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,753
Lhrem current lawyer they smash
the discs. He pulls a tail.

69
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,753
Channel 7 shoveling him already the grave.
Chances are 50: 1 against him.

70
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,753
Want that he is lynched?
- What are they? Child molester!

71
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,070
Client's client.

72
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,316

Anyone watching you. following:

You talk to anyone. They do not say,
that you have not done it,

103
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,790
Not the opposite.
They say nothing.

Or it will be a very short process.

Children to think of anything.

130
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,313
Proves the research.

But Los Angeles believes that

You know, what are people afraid of?
- Child abuse is against violence.

147
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,593
Surprise you perhaps?
- I've been looking for everywhere.

148
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,912
Could we reduce the deposit for the
McMartins? You know...

149
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,913
My clients are not dangerous
to the public, so...

150
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,198
Only that justifies a high bail,
you know that. Come on, Stevens,

151
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,479
Have not even parked illegally.
- These people are monsters, Mr. Davis.

152
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,314
Think,
that children would invent something really?

153
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,313
I knew that someone like you
accepts this case. What's happening?

154
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,313
Are you considered the drug dealer?
Remember one thing: I hang more

155
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,313
In this case, than you can imagine.
Fish somewhere else in troubled waters.

156
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,313
We both have taken this case
for a reason. It's a big case.

157
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,313
The media will pounce on it!
- Shall I tell you the truth?

158
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,518
You are an opportunist of the worst kind.
Use Kids in order to bring out.

159
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,116
The deserve better.
And they will get well.

160
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,718
Does the defendant not innocent
until proven otherwise?

161
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,872
Yuppie bitch.

162
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,511
Base. Position.
- Car is in position.

163
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,713
This is the unlikely...
- horror and disbelief,

164
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,749
These are today in Manhattan Beach
the reactions, as the shocked...

165
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,710
Raymond Buckey should have pulled a gun
to the children afraid...

166
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,356
It is the nightmare of every parent.
Ironically the person

167
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,353
Of entrusting it to her child...
... the possibility that the children

168
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,353
For pornographic films used...
- you will recall,

169
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,353
How impotent they were,
as they were abused.

170
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,592
Exclusive Reports finish us
my editorial goes crazy.

171
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,070
How was I?
- Fantastic. Better than before.

172
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,073
... The new advertising budgets are set according to the
ratings.

173
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,039
And here comes Virginia McMartin,
2 weeks together

174
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,033
Was released with her granddaughter Peggy Ann Buckey
on bail.

175
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,033
... Against child abuse for voters
the most important decisions...

176
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,752
It's about rape, sodomy, oral copulation
and perversion.

177
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,753
Hi, Denise, how are the kids?
- Shame on you, Mr. Davis.

178
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,308
However, you must wait here!
- Yes, what next? Where should we go?

179
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,914
Sorry. Hey, here I am.

180
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,991
Sorry,
in just over an hour, we are out of here.

181
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,993
Get out and my brother?
- A deposit of one million?

182
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,039
Always one by one.
Please sit down.

183
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,716
Are you okay?

184
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,636
Waiting, we go.

185
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,956
ran  driving, up close.

186
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,758
Yes, it can be real.
- I need 5 - 10 minutes.

187
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,391
I have to submit few things. Routine.
Then you can go home, ok?

188
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,752
The match but exactly into the picture.
As one can imagine 'a lot.

189
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,035
Because that old, look, will you?

190
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,673
You collection itself. The department of 100
Supreme Court in California

191
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,551
Shall meet. The Honorable Judge Ronald M. George
chaired.

192
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,436
Miss Ruby!

193
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,793
Your honor, the prosecutor
making the request, the accused

194
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,556
The Feilassung to fail on bail.
- What did she say?

195
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,315
The deposit is already set.
- There are new facts.

196
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,313
New facts? What are these facts?
- The children and their parents

197
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,313
Were threatened by the defendants,
that you would kill her,

198
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,313
If they testify as witnesses in the trial.
Thereby the accused to a

199
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,598
Serious danger to the community.
- Where are...

200
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,633
The relevant evidence, Your Honour?
- Statements of parents and children,

201
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,110
Present me.
- I want to ask these children

202
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,158
To clarify the whole.
- You come off.

203
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,789
Continue Miss Ruby.
- In kindergarten the McMartins

204
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,512
Been abused clearly and irrefutably
numerous children. Thank you.

205
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,475
Yes, Your Honor. I'd like to start at
Peggy Ann Buckey,

206
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,199
The sister of Ray,
the daughter of Peggy Buckey

207
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,392
And the granddaughter of Virginia McMartin.

208
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,269
This young woman was the
Higgins Scholarship

209
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,191
As the best teacher of the year.
Even just to consider that...

210
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,193
The good old Dave, who did not say,
that she is still a virgin.

211
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,716
... And even murderers.
- You will find that the accusation

212
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,713
abusing  Hundreds of children
somehow weighs less than...

213
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,395
The murder of a human?
- These are mere allegations!

214
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,553
I read the minutes of the hearing before
the grand jury. And I am of the opinion

215
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,555
That they reflect the enormity
these crimes.

216
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,793
No deposit for Miss Buckey
would be a concession to the media.

217
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,793
I know of no precedent...
- I think you're exaggerating a little,

218
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,793
Mr. Davis. If in any case,
in the not facing the death penalty

219
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,839
The bail should be denied,
then in this here.

220
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,356
Yes, Your Honor...
- In the interest of safety

221
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,833
I refuse Mr. Buckey bail.
I decide just in case

222
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,753
Babette Spitler, Betty Raidor,

223
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,753
Peggy Ann Buckey and Peggy Buckey.

224
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,199
Your Honor!
Your honor, I plead...

225
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,790
Mom.
... You earnestly to reconsider!

226
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,515
What's happening?
- I do not know what happened.

227
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,433
What will happen to my children?
- Peggy!

228
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,198
I promise you,
I will fight it.

229
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,636
Mr. Davis.

230
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,036
Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis!

231
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,830
Mr. Davis?
Mr. Davis, what are you running away?

232
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,710
What do you want?
- Tell my fans now

233
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,713
That Their clients are innocent.
- I refer to the statements

234
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,314
And denominated "not guilty".

235
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,631
Section.
- Congratulation. They pinched straight

236
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,952
A tail before 5 million people.
- You're an asshole! Thank you! Thank you.

237
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,797
Here with me in the studio is a man
of the main defendants in this...

238
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,237
What do you see? Hot tattoos!
Is the 'n Hells Angel?

239
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,233
George Freeman what Buckey told?
- Buckey said he children

240
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,598
Before it has penetrated into it,
has purely lubricated with gel, so...

241
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,993
Unbelievable! Where gets set forth the types?
- Da, where he herkriegt everything.

242
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,709
From the prosecution.
... Taught in kindergarten

243
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,635
How to please a man orally.
- From the gutter! Scum!

244
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,275
This case is disgusting.
Can you not give it?

245
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,796
I myself have 5 children and...
- He said it!

246
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,793
I have never said that! And they taught sexual practices
young children!

247
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,793
You must tell me everything!
- You've seen my sister yet!

248
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,793
Who can say something about her?
- I need to know everything, because I'll

249
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,078
Not stand before the judgment and wait
that the prosecution will rip you!

250
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,596
Now you're talking!
- I said, and I'm serious,

251
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,593
You will not be surprised.
- This is not a Brotherhood Up!

252
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,593
Here sit small children on the witness stand
and say they were injured.

253
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,593
That's something you need to be prepared.
- Then prepare! Who can so what?

254
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,593
What is this? I can not but put simply
any crap in the world?

255
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,312
Okay. Why a young guy
as working in a kindergarten?

256
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,356
Well, I like children.
- Never an answer to this question!

257
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,228
So you say please the court,
why a grown man

258
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,756
Preschoolers teaches?
- Because my grandmother.

259
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,753
I thought this would be a good professional.
- No. Something better. by Think.

260
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,753
Study went wrong. I needed 's job.
- Better. It is very naive,

261
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,072
But it is better. You know,
some of the parents have said

262
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,789
You have not worn underwear.
Is that correct?

263
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,793
I wore shorts under no underwear.
- Then let lhren Otto hang out?

264
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,829
That's surf shorts that are very long.
For the beach! Is that a crime?

265
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,833
But that's enough to convict you.
You could sit the 500 years in prison.

266
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,833
Tell me about Their women.
How much women you were in bed?

267
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,230
Round numbers only. 20, 30, 50, never mind.
- A.

268
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,636
How mean? A...

269
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,476
What?
- A woman.

270
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,399
How old are you? 25 years, right?
And you were with a woman in bed?

271
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,393
A single. Is that a crime?
- One is tuned for child abuse

272
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,436
's All a crime.

273
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,716
You are gay, have it like from the back?
- No!

274
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,396
In camps we all thought it...
- I'm not.

275
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,238
Okay. Here's a little
gift for you, Ray.

276
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,031
My name is Ray Buckey.
I say nothing.

277
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,316
I hear nothing.

278
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,550
So you get the teeth apart,
otherwise see old in court.

279
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,553
Why do we get out of the material
the evidence is not fast together?

280
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,553
We have to hurry more.
- I'm with Virginia's diaries

281
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,030
As good as through.
- Good, diaries should give what.

282
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,033
What about the videotapes?
- Since we are not yet at the point.

283
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,035
Do little hope there are more.
Kee works continuously.

284
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,830
When did we last time ate something?
So, Greek or Chinese?

285
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,992
Yes, good idea. What's with porn photos?

286
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,233
It must nevertheless be that find.
Retrieve a list of all photo labs.

287
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,598
And let the FBI
also check Scandinavian distributors.

288
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,593
Incidentally, the letter from Judy Johnson...
- Oh, Judy Johnson! Look, Glenn,

289
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,593
We have hundreds statements of children,
they must all be checked

290
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,878
Namely quickly.
Checks times all pet stores.

291
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,589
You killed all these animals.
Where they have the concern?

292
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,593
We should take care of the letter.
Just to see what kind of a.

293
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,958
After what she writes, she seems...
if puzzled to put it politely.

294
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,589
Surprise you, in all of this,
what she's been through?

295
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,994
Whether the defense has a copy of it?
- Why not? Checks the animal laboratories.

296
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,875
Hello! You must be Malcolm.

297
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,435
Mrs. Johnson, I'm Glenn Stevens
by the prosecution.

298
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,629
I you prepare to Their statement.
And want to talk with Malcolm.

299
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,756
He's been through enough already.
Malcolm, you go into the house!

300
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,556
Well, I'm going but...

301
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,633
Need to speak with him. Eventually.
Finally that was lts display

302
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,794
With the started this sad case.
Lhr son is our most important witness.

303
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,836
Mrs. Johnson?

304
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,713
More and more nurseries are
for possible connections...

305
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,916
... That all concerned...

306
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,553
... The police were...

307
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,953
... 1,200 children abused and were replaced with
other children.

308
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,953
Sheriff Block speaks of...
- I would now ask you for the thousandth time

309
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,476
To the grand jury protocol
and the police report.

310
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,315
Otherwise we make on our own research!
- Not as long as I'm chief of police!

311
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,359
For every minute presents anybody
a new perverse perpetrators.

312
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,353
Good reason. What happend today?
Yes, you hear what happened?

313
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,194
How many proofs exist for this?
- Watch any news?

314
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,431
Innocent people could be harmed.

315
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,916
Here she comes!

316
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,394
Misery monster, you!
- Bitch!

317
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,713
Croak thou shalt!
- You bitch!

318
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,238
The want to kill me.
- Try to calm down.

319
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,075
In here you will not do something.
- You do not know how it's like here.

320
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,473
One can not imagine that a
ever such a thing happens.

321
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,395
I always have the infirmary because of my medications
.

322
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,076
I'm handcuffed,
hands behind his back.

323
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,557
The other cry then.
Insults and worse.

324
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,556
They threaten that they do what me.
- I do not know

325
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,590
Why you moved to the other.
We let embarrassed, I promise!

326
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,990
It seems to me
that you are a nice man.

327
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,559
Who are you?
- Dean Gits my name. I'm a lawyer.

328
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,633
Judge George called me and asked,
if I would represent you.

329
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,235
How old are you?
They look like a child.

330
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,551
39.
- Young man, you would have to eat more.

331
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,833
Last night called to the fire department
again for now closed

332
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,833
McMartin preschool. It is believed
that it is arson.

333
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,833
The building was today
plugged morning fire 3-4 PM.

334
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,833
The fire was brought under control
and there were no casualties.

335
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,074
The authorities suspect that has
arson to do with the child molester case.

336
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,190
Be careful! The second time in two months
. Would be better spent.

337
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,396
So a mess.

338
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,709
Caution puddle.
The window. Are huge.

339
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,715
From a busy street can be viewed
directly into the window.

340
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,751
Anyone can
-. Had they blind?

341
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,396
You can not see.

342
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,829
Do you think she was?
- What do you think?

343
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,190
Well, when I read Peggy their indictment,
they asked me what is a dildo.

344
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,992
The others are the same.
Mother, grandmother, happy Christians.

345
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,834
Maximum time a ticket
for parking tickets. Not more.

346
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,993
And yet are there children who claim they were raped
,

347
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,358
Pornography been forced.
I do not know either.

348
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,513
This should all be here in it happened?
- I've already experienced so much,

349
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,991
That me nothing more shocked.
I see no closets!

350
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,153
Not you say the children that Ray would have hidden their parents in the closet before
?

351
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,153
What about the video?
- The looks at the opposite side of

352
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,199
And we fly blind. They have yet to give us
. I see no closet.

353
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,236
Damned molester!

354
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,269
I'll show you our studio. Hi, kids!
- Hi!

355
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,150
Still so many?
- Unbelievable, is not it? Parents and children

356
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,439
Have gone public,
now come each day. Come.

357
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,069
How much bands are so far?
- About 300

358
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,996
How long is each band?
- Approximately 11/2 to 2 hours.

359
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,993
What? Next month's preliminary hearing.
How can I view the meantime?

360
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,473
We have of course
listed separately all charges. Sandy?

361
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,516
Fantastic.

362
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,794
Sit down.
- Show it.

363
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,156
So, Chuck Ross, 25-12.

364
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,397
The boy said: "Ray and Peggy
bordered on my penis".

365
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,830
Mary Ann, 32-71.
- Peggy Ann pressed my head

366
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,833
Her breasts. 35-12 Chuck had
sex with Betty.

367
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,912
Have what about Virginia?
- Heather?

368
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,193
Heather Ross, here it is 26-65.
- Virginia sat in her old wheelchair

369
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,272
And clapped to the Nackedei games.

370
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,396
This is very helpful.
- Sometimes it takes a while,

371
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,109
But then the truth comes out.

372
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,112
Come on, eyes on! Time to get up!
Let's go! Get up!

373
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,636
Pack your things, we move you.
- Where to?

374
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,633
Pace! Come on, over there. The bag.
Take the bag, pack pure things.

375
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,429
Yes, very good.
Come and help her at last!

376
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,838
Where are we going?
- We embarrassed you! Let's go.

377
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,397
Los, move!
- Tell me where you take me.

378
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,757
Subheading to the 4203.
time of the transfer: 3:17.

379
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,189
I want to anyone in the cell!
- Go in there!

380
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,156
Completed.

381
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,035
Mom, Mom!
- Is it true, Peggy?

382
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,795
Oh, thank God! Thank god!
It's incredible!

383
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,993
It's so horrible here!
Here next door in the cell, this woman

384
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,517
And she... She screams.
All night long she cries!

385
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,952
Mom!
- I'm so glad to see you.

386
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,511
Finally someone with whom I can talk.
Have you seen Ray?

387
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,116
Is he well? My poor boy.
- The wanted tell me anything.

388
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,352
Could he go home? I'm afraid.
I'm so worried about him

389
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,830
And around you. And to all of us.
- Take care,

390
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,515
She shuts up.
- What do you mean?

391
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,513
Because you will definitely bugged.
Do you think that you would out of kindness

392
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,388
Placed in a cell, out of concern
to LHR both well-being? God!

393
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,350
Then they forced us to undress.
We had to lay on his stomach us.

394
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,110
We were handcuffed.
- I had very great anxiety.

395
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,513
We should keep our mouths.
- You poked me with her fingers.

396
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,831
And that was very painful.
- Where it hurt you?

397
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,359
In my butt.
- Other men were still in the process.

398
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,348
What did they do?
- You've been watching us.

399
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,315
And pictures.
- Then we drove Ray to Carwash

400
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,473
And we had all our stuff
off in the car.

401
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,554
Ray has stayed with us in the car
and then he touched us.

402
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,589
These children are so brave,
because they tell the truth.

403
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,593
The poor little things feel
even guilty for shame

404
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,593
That was done to them by others.
Yours all our love and warmth

405
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,390
So that they can get over this terrible trauma
. Caused by...

406
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,393
Kee McFarlane said that reports agree
agree remarkably.

407
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,917
And that over a period of nearly
10 months, since the very first indication.

408
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,152
What's up? What's so important?
In 2 weeks, the preliminary hearing.

409
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,314
Hey, Malcolm. Where's Judy?
- Speak better with Malcolm alone.

410
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,909
Tell him, Malcolm.
- He hurt me.

411
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,158
Who hurt you, Malcolm? He poked me -
.

412
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,359
Who pricked?
- Daddy poked with a stick...

413
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,796
Rum in my butt.

414
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,116
What is a Stock, Malcolm?

415
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,876
The there's a floor.

416
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,670
Where is this happening?
- In the bathtub.

417
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,996
Daddy always bathes me.

418
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,309
Does Mom told you that you shall tell bad things about
Daddy?

419
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,356
No.

420
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,435
Why do not you purely to Mommy, huh?
- Take care, kid.

421
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,473
You think that's so wrong?
- What should I believe?

422
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,509
Can there be an explanation for this?
I ask you, Jane, you know what.

423
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,513
He wants to divorce her.
- That may be. Judy does not work

424
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,513
Has absolutely nothing. They tried to take revenge
to extort some money.

425
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,469
We must still press charges.
- Jane, if we do that,

426
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,473
Rips us the defense to pieces.
It was here the first display

427
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,473
Against Ray Buckey. Malcolm was the night before
Judy ads does refunded

428
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,030
With his father.
The will say it had begun.

429
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,192
Well, what you want to do instead?

430
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,674
The father further release to Malcolm?
- No, of course not.

431
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,355
So, tell Judy,
that they should prevent

432
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,833
That the father Malcolm sees
until we have investigated the matter. OK?

433
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,353
It was hard to get these tapes.
We need to look at here,

434
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,353
I can not take my office.
So, I urgently need your help.

435
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,353
Make to each child notes.
You write the least to,

436
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,310
What you notice for each child.
The first child is Jonathan Lawson.

437
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,431
Den we can skip. When I started in
kindergarten, he was already gone.

438
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,433
Well, but this band is showing
that he knows you anyway. So

439
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,833
Fresh we LHR memory on,
as they say. In court.

440
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,719
I will now show you dolls,
the look totally laughable from.

441
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,110
Really crazy,
I find, see the out.

442
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,516
Wow, who are really great!
- The breasts look like tarts

443
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,513
With a cherry on it, right?
She has a belly button

444
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,831
And pubic hair around the vagina.
- Impossible!

445
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,791
And the doll here who has a penis!

446
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,479
And now I want you
Get a photo interests.

447
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,395
The man you know, do not you?
Do you remember him?

448
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,910
Um... yes. I do not know exactly.
- He does not know...

449
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,118
He was with you teacher
, when you were in kindergarten.

450
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,678
No. I do not think
I saw him once.

451
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,156
Look at him closely.

452
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,272
No.
- He was not at some point there?

453
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,351
No, I was not.
- Why do they do that?

454
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,716
Pst, listens.

455
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,435
Perhaps I got him yet seen
once or twice.

456
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,559
The elders must help the younger.
The are not as smart as you.

457
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,553
The young children so
strange things have happened. Do you think

458
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,030
You can tell us something about us?
- Nothing happened to me.

459
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,112
What, you is really nothing happened?

460
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,672
Somehow I can not remember
me. I'm not sure.

461
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,833
Well, sometimes it's just hard
talk about such things.

462
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,956
But the dolls can.

463
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,113
Hi, snake! The children have
tells us of horrible games

464
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,554
Where the teachers have touched on comic sites
.

465
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,111
Passierte so whatever our Jonathan?
- No, I'm not!

466
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,832
What, Jonathan it's not happening?
- No, this is not happening to me.

467
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,039
This is not happening to me.
- "This is not happening to me."

468
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,829
Remember then
to the tickle game?

469
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,156
"Tickle game?"

470
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,953
Come on, as bad can
your memory not be.

471
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,749
All your friends say,
that you played it.

472
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,709
What is snake? Is your memory
not as good as your friends?

473
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,238
I remember the tickling game.
- Look, you have a good memory.

474
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:49,235
I thought it's pretty bad.
- It is certainly better than you think.

475
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,233
Will not you show us
like tickling game is played?

476
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,871
We crawled around on the floor.
And the teacher had to catch us.

477
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,155
They came very slowly to...

478
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,155
And have tickled us.
- Were you here sometimes naked?

479
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,233
You have my shirt pulled
and tickled me on the belly.

480
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,791
That's all what happened.
- That's all, what happened?

481
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,872
Yes.
- It could save your life.

482
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,312
Okay. Now we must remember
to the Naked Movie Star Game.

483
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,356
"Naked Movie Star Game"?

484
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,795
It was just like a fashion show,
I think. Go By some rooms

485
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,111
And constantly rotate
and turn again?

486
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,191
What do the adults made this?

487
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,430
The adults? Do not know really.
Maybe freetime?

488
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,196
Boy, you're really great!
Who took the photos?

489
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,353
Well, how good is your memory, huh?
- Ray, I know exactly.

490
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,915
Ray, I know exactly.

491
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,516
Ray, I know exactly.
- Outstanding! Outstanding!

492
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,676
Excellent! Outstanding!

493
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,473
It was creepy. He hid in a
old tunnel in the basement.

494
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,348
Our parents could not see us...
- And...

495
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,599
We were all naked and danced
. This dance.

496
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,958
And Ray, who killed the horse.
He hit it.

497
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,919
And then there was dead
-. What he hit it?

498
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,755
With a baseball bat.
He hit it and it just lay there.

499
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,150
Who else here yet?
- The Geisen man.

500
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,115
And then Ray drove us all to the airport and we are
losgeflogen.

501
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,354
Airfield? But you did not say,
it was a car wash?

502
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,396
It was an airfield,
but the plane had no windows.

503
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,118
You are free. free on bail.
Lhr father is already waiting in the parking lot.

504
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,636
What, now?
- Right now. Let's go.

505
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,633
And the others that are also free?
- Ray does not, but it was clear to us.

506
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,679
Your mother has to stay here.
- Oh my God!

507
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,473
As I will therefore be alone again.
- It'll be fine, Mom.

508
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,030
You come also free.
I'll let the comb there.

509
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,031
Perhaps you need him still.

510
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,990
It'll be fine. Be strong.
I love you.

511
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,796
I do not think that I
inside by standing the here alone.

512
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,235
What?
- I just do not know

513
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,675
If I do not lose courage.

514
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,350
Okay. Good.
Ok, I'll stay here with you.

515
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,750
I'm not going. I let the security
not store for me and then...

516
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,708
There will arise.
I can try, ok?

517
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,356
No. We are talking nonsense.

518
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,633
Come on, hurry up, before they
think differently. Go on!

519
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,676
Mom!
- Go! Go on.

520
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,236
Please!

521
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,436
Parole on bail.

522
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,633
Forgive. I thought you said:
"Thank you for letting me

523
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,633
have brought out here "
but since I am probably interrogated.

524
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,030
I can not.
I feel too guilty.

525
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,156
Guilty why?
- That I the others leave behind here.

526
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,833
Today, only a few weeks after the
District Attorney Ira Reiner...

527
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,833
Meanwhile passed 11 months...
- Today the first child is a witness

528
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,835
Testify in court. A 7-year-old, the
to his true identity...

529
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,833
It is expected that the statement
this boys Defense

530
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,833
will inflict substantial damage .
The mood here at the courthouse

531
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,118
There is great tension.
This unusual case...

532
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,272
Hey, there they are!
- That was expectable.

533
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,753
Please, the light does your eyes hurt!
You have cataracts.

534
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,515
Hey, what is this? Stop!
Have not you heard?

535
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,592
Hey, get rid of it!
- You stupid bastard!

536
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,310
No one wants
that you defend the devil!

537
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,796
Her silk satisfied?

538
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,956
Be brave, my little one.

539
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,830
The press sitting in another room,
while the kids make their statements.

540
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,994
The media will have to pursue the negotiation
via monitors.

541
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,836
Hi, Sean.

542
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,156
How old are you?
- 7

543
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,913
You know the difference between
the truth and a lie?

544
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,912
Yes.
- What's happening when you're lying?

545
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,676
I get in trouble.
- I agree. When you were in kindergarten

546
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,477
You have there ever played any
Nackedei games?

547
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,593
Cowboys and Indians.
Our teachers were the Cowboys

548
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,593
And we Indians the. They caught us
and have locked us in jail.

549
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,309
Then they touched us.
- Where did they touch you?

550
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,790
On my penis.
- Who touched you there?

551
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,836
Ray and Miss Piggy.

552
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,468
Do you remember other
Nackedei games?

553
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,599
The Crocodile game.
- You call us the names of the people

554
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,710
Who played this game with you?
- I can not remember anymore.

555
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,278
Now then, what other games did you play
, Sean?

556
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,034
Naked Movie Star?
- Correct. Does anyone photographed

557
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,590
During this game?
- I do not know anymore.

558
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,313
Did not you say that Miss Virginia
during Naked Movie Star Game

559
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,836
Photographed?
- Your honor. Leading question.

560
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,434
Opposition.
- Opposition rejected.

561
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,192
Sean, Miss Virginia taken photos

562
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,949
While her "Naked Movie Star" spieltet?
- Yes.

563
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,953
Does Ray you, except with his hand,
with what touches others?

564
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,713
With his penis.
- Where did you Ray

565
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,950
With his penis touched?
- In my penis.

566
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,274
He said: "In my penis"?
- Yes.

567
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,636
Thank you.

568
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,513
Good morning, Sean.
- Good Morning.

569
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,996
Morning, Snoopy.

570
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,397
I heard your daddy calls you
Wuschelkopf why is that?

571
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,029
I do not know yet.
- Maybe because your hair

572
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,634
Forward a bit protruding?
- Yes.

573
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,353
Your mom took you to the institute.
Because you have a wife to know,

574
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,389
The Kee's. And did you
shown a couple of peculiar dolls.

575
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,436
Yes.
- And this woman, Kee,

576
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,795
Wanted to talk to you about penises.
Was that so?

577
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,474
Yes.
- Did you find it not funny,

578
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,793
That she has talked about the same as what?
- Already somehow.

579
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,998
Is also funny. She said she believes
Ray would you touched on your penis

580
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,036
Is not it?
- Yes.

581
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,712
And you said no, right?
- Yes.

582
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,833
And they gave you repeatedly
asked the same question, right?

583
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,673
Yes.
- And at some point you said:

584
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,913
"Well, Ray has touched my penis".
- Objection! Leading question.

585
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,956
Sustained.

586
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,471
In your first week you
no longer knew if anyone has photos.

587
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,516
True?
- Yes.

588
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,598
But then helped Mr. Stevens you, remind you to
that she photographed.

589
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,194
Yes!
- And that's why you said:

590
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,592
"Yes, Virginia took pictures."
- Yes.

591
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,592
You knew he wanted to hear?
- Yes.

592
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,433
Otherwise he would have been sad?
- Yes!

593
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,195
And what you tell,
is also what Kee wants.

594
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,192
Yes.
- The also want anyone else to hear

595
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,511
Speaking with you about this case?
- Yes.

596
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,472
Thank you Sean, thank you. And thank you, Snoopy.

597
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,230
The court
retracts for 15 minutes.

598
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,595
Helps us continue in any case.
A second round, ok?

599
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,196
Only when Snoopy also wants.
- You'll see Snoopy wants.

600
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,675
Did you anyone advised
what to say in court?

601
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,992
No.
- Has as Mr. Davis wondered

602
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,430
If you tell what everyone wants to hear from you
because you said yes.

603
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,116
Why did you say yes?
- Because I should tell the truth,

604
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,113
And also because I wanted to please him
it.

605
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,636
Thank you.
- The witness may be removed.

606
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,995
The hearing was postponed.

607
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,913
Have we done it?
- Great! In order to really be glad:

608
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,913
In the break a father told the press,
he had found porn photos of children.

609
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,436
Oh no!
- Only he can not submit them because...

610
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,672
Because 4 Cops from Manhattan Beach area
members of Sexrings would.

611
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,194
What? What?
- I do not know more.

612
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,432
You said before an audience of millions,
Jim was a member of an Sexring.

613
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,715
Repeat before him!

614
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,637
Okay. They have argued
you had pornographic photos.

615
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,759
Either you give me or I take
you so long in custody until you do so.

616
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:48,197
But there are no Pornofotos.
What the heck, I ask you!

617
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,114
Jims blood pressure is so high enough
without lts fabrications!

618
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,113
Why did you do that?
- We need the attention

619
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,432
The whole country.
After all, our children are at risk!

620
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,674
Do not know the phrase:
"The end justifies the means"?

621
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,791
Pull the bed from, examine the pillow.
Pull everything off and accurate to size!

622
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,476
Ok.

623
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,789
Do not take anything.
- The Teddy my mother made for me.

624
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,996
You crocheting something for me.

625
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,309
Pull off. Everything!
Hurry, Hurry!

626
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,156
Well, it will soon.

627
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,156
Enter here!

628
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,230
I have to control all the
body orifices.

629
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,956
Ok.

630
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,234
Fold the ears forward.

631
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,631
Shake the hair.
Abdominal pull up!

632
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,476
Ok. And now prevent.

633
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,799
Pull Their apart labia.
You cough.

634
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,753
You must cough because they like to smuggle things
in her vagina.

635
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,276
Seriously?
- Yes. Drugs, guns, do not you think

636
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:40,469
What reinpasst since. I once had a,
the smuggled 6 packs of cigarettes.

637
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,308
Can I get dressed again now?
- What are you doing this evening?

638
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,313
Perhaps I look at the new
Clint Eastwood movie. And you?

639
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,952
Perhaps' ne billiards, as always.
- I want to go home, please.

640
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:03,150
Even before Dad she would show
naked. And you do something to.

641
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,910
Do we have to pick up all this stuff from
kindergarten still?

642
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,833
The sixth time we draw it.

643
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,876
Grandmother?

644
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,036
Grandmother.

645
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:37,916
How can you still smile?
Are not you bitter?

646
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,509
Of course I am
But despite the bitterness.

647
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,514
Can I gaiety of
young children still enjoy.

648
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,713
Where does Peggy Ann touches you?
- On my dick.

649
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,952
Did you Peggy Ann also touch?
- Yes. On her bosom.

650
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,715
Did you have to also touch other parts of her body
?

651
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,588
Their cunt.
- Does Ray done something to Peggy Ann?

652
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:13,350
He stuck his cock in her pussy.
- Does Ray animals done anything?

653
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,433
He has the rabbit ears cut off!
- What did he say when he hare

654
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,433
has cut  ears?
- That our parents the same thing happens,

655
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,548
If we betray our secrets.
- Took her you still go elsewhere?

656
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,997
At Harry's market.
- What happened when you were there?

657
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,993
There they brought us to the camp,
played on tails, photographed.

658
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,959
Her silk yet been somewhere?
- In a church.

659
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,357
The Saint Cross Church.
- What happened in this church?

660
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,433
You have led us into the aisle and have
animals placed on the altar.

661
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,196
Birds and rabbits and such.
And they have hacked into pieces.

662
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,398
Who is "they", Jonathan?
- I saw men in black robes.

663
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,598
With Knitting around the abdomen.
That was really creepy.

664
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,078
They also had time to devil masks.
- Devil masks?

665
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,398
Yes, and they have forced us to drink
rabbit blood.

666
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,353
He reports of gruesome animal sacrifices
on the altar of a church.

667
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,353
Did you hear that?
This is a godsend for Davis.

668
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,115
Pagan cult in a church.
- Do not get excited, Christine.

669
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,113
White Owen finally our problem?
Glenn, she has promised me.

670
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,113
If she does not, I'm doing it.
- The boy reported in the courtroom,

671
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,113
That he drank the blood of a rabbit.
- What do you think of Jonathan's statement?

672
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,909
Do you think that in
McMartin kindergarten actually...

673
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,470
Just incredible.
Who else thinks that shit?

674
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,473
I mean something like sacrificed animals
Group, men are running in robes rum.

675
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:55,473
Soon the children will tell,
they had nailed a guy on the cross

676
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,473
Or 'a virgin on the altar sacrificed.
This is totally out of control.

677
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:04,953
Do not you also? I have,
which are still completely nuts!

678
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,313
I think we have here nationwide
to do with a conspiracy of people

679
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,313
In their kindergartens already
long time drift terrible things.

680
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,916
Satanism, devil worship!
Widespread all over the country.

681
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,596
All varieties of perversion.
- Heard cannibalism for this ritual?

682
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,593
The children have talked about.
- And the children were also forced

683
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,878
Eating bloody hearts of children.
Pieces of their flesh.

684
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,954
If the parents is clear
that something really happened

685
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,953
And that the like has not only
happened in the Dark Ages

686
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,953
It more difficult for these criminals,
to practice such rites.

687
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,953
Let us hear of ritual sacrifice,
then we do not want to admit it.

688
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,953
It is beyond the imagination of ordinary people every
.

689
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,194
But that does not mean that the children
not tell the truth.

690
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,799
Where's your storage space?
- I show you, come.

691
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,316
That's it?
- Yes.

692
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,550
But you can see directly purely!
- My cashier sitting over there.

693
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,553
It all looks from his office.
- And that has always been so?

694
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,030
Has always!
- Could this really be happening?

695
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,795
No, the doors are always locked.
It is some time ago

696
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,793
Night been burgled in the office and the police
guarantees monitoring

697
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,509
Only closed doors.
- Could but someone break?

698
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,913
No, accountant, secretary and cleaner
daytime here.

699
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,753
You have to answer questions!
- Let us through, please!

700
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,753
Can you really still see parents
in the eye?

701
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,960
How much money you have earned it?
- Do not do so hypocritical!

702
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,999
Please, see here!
- How long are you doing that?

703
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,995
Keep it out to ride in an elevator
with us, Mr. sentence?

704
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,993
We could suddenly drinking rabbit blood!
- Miss Buckey,

705
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,993
I do not make the news,
I give it only further.

706
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,993
No one can describe Their version of the case
, as long as you do not say

707
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,993
What you feel, because you are innocent.
- You are not interested yet!

708
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,993
But that Ray is just like an animal.
- Sorry, no comment.

709
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,993
Virginia McMartin groped from the children
from her wheelchair. Peggy Ann Buckey

710
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,993
Forced children to have sexual intercourse.
You but the truth is no matter!

711
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,993
What was that? Do that again!
- Why not? In kindergarten is purely

712
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,993
Nothing happens, you know
and he knows exactly!

713
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:50,074
One needs which tell the truth!
- Their witnesses like very much.

714
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,073
One assumes the statement back, says
he invented, so you can look forward.

715
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,755
The other says he was in the
Saint-Cross Church,

716
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,753
As a rabbit was slaughtered
and he had to drink the blood.

717
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,753
Question: Do you want lhren case win
or in the Saturday Night Live Show?

718
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,515
How to make the call as witnesses?
- I answer for Glenn:

719
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,388
These are our best witnesses.
- What about the video tapes?

720
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,994
Forget it.
- What does that mean?

721
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,393
The testimony of children has no value.
Kee and Sandy pray to you all.

722
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,393
Tell the children, it was not so,
they say: "But tell everyone else,

723
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,393
that it was so, so you're wrong."
When then say it was so,

724
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,393
Then they are really great!
- If the children say of itself:

725
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,235
"Hey, I was abused"?
After their families were threatened?

726
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,233
I have a stupid question.
Why I hear this for the first time?

727
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:45,871
Did not you already seen by
long ago the tapes?

728
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,873
Yes, of course we have the
But when we brought charges.

729
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,954
We barely had time for that quantity.
We drew upon Kees records.

730
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,318
Are Unreliable?
- No, they are not.

731
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,394
What exactly do we have in hand?
- We have a confession.

732
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,233
Freeman, the guy who sat with Buckey
in a cell. Believe him?

733
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:14,711
No one will witness, which I do not think so!
- The jury trust a spy.

734
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,429
You may not trust him,
but be convinced,

735
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,229
If only subliminally.
- Is there medical reports

736
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:26,233
That children have been abused?
- We could outside CII

737
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,871
Find no one who has confirmed that,
anyone of reputation. All say

738
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,873
The evidence was inconclusive.
- I want to hear recommendations.

739
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,872
Stevens?
- Well, there are many problems

740
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,673
With this case, but other things
we must also take into account yet.

741
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,435
I think of the media.
- I Got doubts among women.

742
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,910
I suggest
that we drop the charges.

743
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,436
Seriously? The desecrated children!
- And Buckey,

744
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,910
We reach a conviction with him?
- Maybe.

745
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,753
Perhaps?
- Four children say

746
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,913
He had abused them at a time,
when he was not in kindergarten.

747
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,913
The children are constantly changing their statements.
- The teachers they had taken

748
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,913
The car wash, in mortuaries, cemeteries
to them

749
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,913
Would flew to Palm Springs.
There is no single piece of evidence.

750
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,956
No one has seen them.

751
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,758
Lhr both can think what you want, yes.
As for me, I do not intend,

752
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,594
Also to drop only an accusation.
Not even against the women.

753
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,593
It is our duty to do so.
- We are not even sure when Buckey.

754
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,593
That's us. The guy took drugs!
And he flew from almost every school,

755
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,593
Where he was. He sat every day
in this kindergarten with...

756
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,912
Bared genitals before the children.
And there's something else.

757
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,470
What?
- The photo. This is a photo of Buckey.

758
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,753
On a pyramid fan meeting.
This woman told our investigators

759
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:59,119
That she was with him in a motel.
And Buckey has no high got.

760
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,113
What does this have to do with child abuse?
- Bring it but in context

761
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,113
With the other events, Christine.
Apparently this is here man,

762
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,113
For no regular sex is possible.
Somehow he had to yes

763
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,113
Satisfaction procure. That fits!
- Maybe, but that does not explain anything

764
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,113
In the case of his grandmother, his...
- The old woman with the dark glasses?

765
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,113
Do not you know that sexual desires and perversions in women

766
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,272
Just exist like in men?

767
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,632
My predecessor had 208 charges.

768
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,994
Is not that a bit much?

769
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,513
If he wanted to eventually win the election?
- OK. So just because we with some

770
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,513
are pieces of evidence have a few problems
people not suddenly

771
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,513
To innocence angels! Children never lie
and never with such a thing.

772
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:51,513
Somewhere there is a proof,
and is hand-tight! I know that.

773
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,513
We just need to find just him.
One gets drunk, divulges everything.

774
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,513
Someone commits suicide
and leaves a letter of confession.

775
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:05,357
Someone finally finds Pornofotos!
That's all that's necessary. A photo!

776
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,559
I ask that you listen to me!
- What is that, Mrs. McMartin,

777
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,189
Please sit down!
- You could know my lawyer,

778
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,193
That his fee is
no longer paid by the public sector.

779
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,671
I have no money. Nothing more.
The kindergarten is destroyed.

780
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,673
Mr. Fountain had with something expected
and received a considerable amount.

781
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,673
He represents you to the hearing at the end!
- I never took the life of charity.

782
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,673
I worry for another lawyer.
- By I speak not a word!

783
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,673
Mrs. McMartin, do you have any legal knowledge
?

784
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,673
Something much more significant. These children.
They all sat on my lap.

785
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,673
I think you all should first
on child learn as much as I do.

786
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,673
... This hearing comes to an end.
- I wont. I stand now on

787
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,673
And will leave this courtroom!
- You stay here in the courtroom!

788
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,673
Do you want to use force?
- Please set up again.

789
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,673
I'm not going to sit back down.
If you want to use violence, please!

790
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,514
I'll let you equal for contempt of the court
arrest!

791
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,990
Please, Your Honor!
- Oh, back to jail!

792
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:14,074
I know how terrible it is there!
- Mom! Are you really going to jail?

793
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,073
You would in there not stand!
You know that! Want to...

794
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,358
Mrs. McMartin!
- You're welcome! I know how you feel.

795
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,077
But that's not the right way.
Make the cause for Their Family

796
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,355
Not worse. You're welcome!

797
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,556
Grandmother!

798
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,873
Please sit down again.

799
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,674
Yes.
- Malcolm Po is red again.

800
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,156
Who is this? Judy?

801
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,953
What happened? Go's Malcolm well?
- He's fine,

802
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:15,910
But the butt of the dog is also red.
And it lacks there also hair.

803
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,710
Judy, does that mean you're talking seriously
from abuse lhres dog?

804
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,713
Yes, I think it was my brother.
He's been following me all the time.

805
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,759
He's going to kill us, I know it!
- What on earth are you talking about?

806
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:33,792
Have you read the letter,
where they wrote down what happened?

807
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,998
Malcolm was injured by a lion.
There lay a baby, his head had been hacked

808
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,915
And his brain burned.
Malcolm had to drink his blood.

809
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,355
Whether the defense has to?
- Rubin will have executed sends him.

810
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:55,231
We are fine out, because I have
not want me to mess with her.

811
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,755
And in the cemetery were forced you to dig
corpses?

812
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,150
Yes.
- Gifts you the adult blades?

813
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,910
Yes.
- Please, may I come forward, Your Honor?

814
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:16,114
So. These are pictures of men here
numbered among them, all right?

815
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,552
Clear.
- See you you exactly to Aaron.

816
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,553
If you on one of the men realize
were with you at the cemetery

817
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,714
Then you draw with the red pen
a great circle around him.

818
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,151
Ready?
Your honor, I admit protocol

819
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,993
Aaron the city known lawyer
James Hahn and the actor

820
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,152
Chuck Norris circled.
- Chuck Norris?

821
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,716
Thank you.

822
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,675
You see ABC Nightline.
From Washington reported Ted Couple.

823
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,353
Live from our editorial in Los Angeles
now reports Daniel Davis,

824
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,558
The defense by Raymond Buckey,
one of the defendants in the McMartin case.

825
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,553
Mr. Davis, I know it's your first duty
, lhrem clients

826
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,553
The best defense to allow.
But it did not just seem

827
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,713
As you would treat the 6- and 7-year
witnesses very gently.

828
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,759
Was a result of the statements of these children my client

829
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,753
Not released on bail.
- That's good, is not it?

830
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,789
... So hard to go to court?
- Mr. Buckey, who is innocent...

831
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,394
Never mind that no fear?
- What?

832
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:51,793
If you'll just despise
as McMartins, or even more!

833
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,509
Sure makes me afraid.
The case is the sheer lunacy!

834
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,513
The brought the train to full speed.
Now he rushes there, brings them votes

835
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,513
And no one wants to apply the brake.
- A train traveling at full speed, what is this?

836
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,309
You can find it probably still exciting?
Do you have reaped little but trouble!

837
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,188
What do you want?
- Let ditch the case.

838
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,790
Because so what people want to be a lawyer.
For Justice.

839
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,793
Oh, please! Now stop it.
This case is as greasy

840
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,078
Like all the others, even worse.
And you know what?

841
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,513
If you actually win this case, all child molesters are
think

842
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,513
They come just unpunished!
- You're just like everyone else.

843
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,513
One speaks only the word children from
and everyone already his judgment has precipitated.

844
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,513
Depends on it! On the chair with him!
Where wants to know the whole of America,

845
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,513
That these people are guilty?
What about the goddamn facts?

846
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,513
If you're right, why are you yelling?
- Because I do not in the same

847
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,513
grew  ratios like you.
I grew in the slums.

848
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,275
I'm not posh lawyer,
I'm an ass! Yes, true,

849
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,353
I belong to this system, but the
sucks! And everyone should know!

850
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,274
Do you know what is really going on here?
It's called the law.

851
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,352
And that happens to important to me!

852
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,156
Judy!

853
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,310
Get out! You enter consecrated ground.
- Judy.

854
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,149
It's me, Steve.
What are you doing with this thing?

855
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,949
Stay away from my children.
Turn from my baby.

856
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,191
Or I'll shoot. I am Jesus Johnson.

857
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,353
You threatened her brother with a gun
because they thought

858
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,353
That he wants to kill their children.
It speaks that the neighbors

859
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,830
Try to abuse their children sexually.
- What is wrong with her?

860
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,833
Acute paranoid schizophrenia.
And the drinking makes it worse.

861
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,833
What do you mean by drinking?
- It is for years an alcoholic,

862
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,718
Do not know?

863
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,513
We insert a lunch break.
The court reenters together

864
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,556
At 14:30.

865
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,873
See you after the break.
- Well, we will every detail

866
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,999
Point by point go.
- Come, let's go!

867
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,273
Caution, man!
- Goodbye, Mom.

868
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:21,074
See you tomorrow, dear.
I will be here. I'm here!

869
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,276
Come.
- Not to take Forget your medicine.

870
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,635
Come forward!
- Peggy!

871
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,916
Mom!
- He hurt her.

872
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,313
No, everything ok. She's just stumbled.
I could see it. She is fine!

873
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:41,279
I do not trust you!
I do not trust any of you.

874
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,473
What I have heard here,
are lies! Lies, from the first day

875
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:50,156
In this courtroom.
You finally tell me the truth!

876
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:05,113
I am also not willing to
to take responsibility for it.

877
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:09,113
Hey, Faye! Let's go eat together?
- We go straight to the Greeks

878
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,431
There's fresh fish today.
- Yes, well.

879
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,719
Can informally talk to you I times,
does it work?

880
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,553
Member of the prosecutor
blasts McMartin case. It was Stevens.

881
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:36,111
The only person who so what dares.
It is almost unbelievable.

882
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,794
Wow.
- Are you so naive to believe

883
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,393
That a reporter keeps it secret,
that the prosecution

884
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:47,393
In their own case, doubt?
- You've made it even more anonymous.

885
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:52,873
Many will think that I was.
My career has done so.

886
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:57,750
How could you do that, Glenn. How so?
- Because I think they are innocent.

887
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,675
Do not you? Tell me, Christine.
You can not be indifferent.

888
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,673
Where is the justice?
- Wait a minute, where did you suddenly

889
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,673
This oh so sanctimonious tone, friend?
You do not know whether they are innocent.

890
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:14,673
You are prosecutor. About guilt or innocence
decide the jury.

891
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:19,914
How to detonate a bomb,
unethical and is cowardly. Begreif that!

892
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,473
If you procured the satisfaction:
I think you've got this case

893
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,473
Irreparable harm inflicted.
- And if you procured the satisfaction:

894
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:34,076
I have destroyed my career,
just to achieve that.

895
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,396
You get my denunciation
on your table. Tomorrow morning.

896
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,076
Mr. Reiner! Mr. Reiner!

897
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,554
How long do you know that?

898
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:05,589
I consulted in depth
with my staff.

899
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,355
We are all reached the same decision
. The evidence

900
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,353
Present against 5 of the defendants,
are so incredibly weak

901
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,797
To nothing
pose as mere accusations.

902
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:23,432
We drop the charges against the accused
5 in McMartin case.

903
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,112
Finally.
- But we have unique

904
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,274
And convincing evidence, that
Ray Buckey had abused children.

905
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,553
Equally clear and convincing evidence exists
for

906
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,519
That his mother Peggy Buckey
was also involved.

907
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,913
Well, 5 he runs. That's what.
- How so? He stands up as the winner.

908
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,709
He knows that he does not get a conviction for all
seven.

909
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,713
That Ray and Peggy all the time
in prison. Without deposit.

910
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,756
He needs an alibi.

911
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,994
Violently reactions sparked today
decision of the prosecutor...

912
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,993
Ira Reiner should go to the 300 victims
and explain to them why the are free

913
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,993
Have done them!
- I myself would never me a

914
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,993
Connect  vigilantes, but I would like
not be in the shoes of these people!

915
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,959
Where Wayne is it set?
- This really is' a good question.

916
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,156
Browsing.

917
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,709
Thank you. Hello!
- A long distance call for Wayne set.

918
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,118
One moment please. Treasure!
A long distance call for you.

919
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,396
Who is this? That you, Kee?
- Whose turn is it?

920
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:59,837
Who is speaking, please?
- It's Chris Woodyard from Examiner.

921
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,271
Did you necessarily drangehen?
- Hello!

922
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,396
Chris!
- Wayne.

923
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,513
He knows. Da's Wayne set.

924
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,159
Hi. What's up?
- A little help firsthand?

925
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,434
What do you mean?
- The Doll Lady.

926
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,913
How long you live because together already?
- If you fuck his informant,

927
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,120
Creates a conflict of interest.
- Why the many exclusive interviews.

928
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:39,113
I am proud of my reports
to this case. For this I am publicly

929
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,113
been awarded. Could it be that something
envy in play here?

930
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:47,273
You're a piece of shit! Reporters like you
are the reason why you hate us.

931
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,273
We are you ass off...
- Try it! But be careful with

932
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,273
What you rauslรคsst. I am not only
reporter, I am also a lawyer.

933
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:01,151
There are certain laws. In TV you can
not just say what you want!

934
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,313
The will make a fair interview.
Tell simple as it is.

935
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:14,349
Then nothing can go wrong.
- Why do we organize this?

936
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,830
You look good.
She looks good, huh?

937
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,398
You look really good.
Oh, you look great!

938
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:29,354
Look at "60 minutes".
- In the time when I was in prison,

939
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,918
Since they deprived me arbitrarily
custody of my children.

940
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,869
They were also taken out of school,
they have visited so far.

941
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,235
You were sent to the home.

942
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:50,074
I also do not know why.
When that happened, he was 8 years old.

943
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:54,673
Just like any other I have
lost all material possessions,

944
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:58,435
I have ever had. It has deprived me
my degree as a teacher.

945
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,433
But I studied 6 years.
- If you are charged in this country

946
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:06,433
You are guilty. God help the,
who must prove his innocence.

947
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:11,116
We were treated just as guilty.
- You know who would see it?

948
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:15,671
Ira Reiner takes a look at the.
Bring the front of the camera.

949
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,639
Virginia McMartin, Betty Raidor,
Mary Ann Jackson,

950
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,314
Peggy Ann Buckey. Their houses,
their wealth, their reputation,

951
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,837
Everything they've lost. Are they right?
- No, of course not.

952
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,833
Who is this man to call,
recover to their assets?

953
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,596
And their lives. To the state?
At lhren predecessor? At the CII?

954
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,119
This is not the kind question,
that should be discussed here.

955
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:46,113
You hope Peggy comes out on bail?
- She's 62, was 11/2 years in prison

956
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,113
Before it was brought to justice.
The trial is at least

957
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,273
take  11/2 years. The need to do something, otherwise it would
a scandal.

958
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,555
Is that all?
- That's all.

959
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,870
All right, I'll see what I can do
.

960
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:15,633
Previously you were always so happy here.
- Earlier. Peggy Ann, no,

961
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,633
I want to go home again.
- No, Mom! Not again

962
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:23,633
Back in this tiny apartment.
Not yet. You're welcome.

963
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:29,113
You were not one more time outdoors,
wast dismissed since you. You're welcome.

964
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:33,512
Here you nothing happens, you know
but as well as I, ok?

965
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:38,435
Come now! We only make a
very short walk, yes?

966
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,676
You need have no fear.
We are all alone here.

967
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,636
I know that. I know.

968
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:56,750
I know that I need to have
not afraid, but I'm afraid.

969
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,796
I'm so scared.

970
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:05,878
Afraid that they come out at night
and drag me back to prison.

971
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,398
I know I've done wrong nothing.
Why happens to me all this?

972
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:15,393
It seems as if God punish me
for anything.

973
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:20,713
I could but only teach children.
And I probably should never again.

974
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,394
I really lost everything!

975
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,876
What about you? Your youth!

976
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,112
You do not laugh more
and you have so much laughed. And Ray!

977
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,513
Ray. He's still in there.
How is the boy the only endure?

978
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,435
Oh yes, he will endure.
Do you have it but also managed.

979
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,996
We hold all through.

980
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,276
Come on.

981
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:19,430
Danny, wait! I've got what.
You have to watch!

982
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,432
See here.
- 1962, a decision

983
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:28,152
The Court of Appeal, I think.
- Here, I've been tonight.

984
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,556
Who is that? Stevens?

985
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,309
Oh, shit!
- Mr. Davis, I can help you?

986
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,113
The Truth About Judy Johnson.
The process never happened,

987
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:50,113
If that would have been presented to the court.
Cursed, he would never have occurred!

988
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:54,113
They knew that Judy is mistaken!
Their main applicant, you knew exactly

989
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,875
Woman is paranoid!
- Listen to cry on, man!

990
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,635
What do you think who you are?
- Why you have withheld from me this?

991
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:05,633
Who do you think is here in front of you?
Do you expect I'll make

992
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:09,633
That you get every piece of evidence?
It's not my job to make sure.

993
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,633
They received a summary.
You should have to ask!

994
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,633
You stand with your back to the wall,
you know. You have against the man

995
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:21,633
Judy Johnson no charges levied!
It shows him for child abuse!

996
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,110
Is it for you no problem,
that I only now know that?

997
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,431
It's not my problem!
- Yes it is!

998
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,633
I do not know why you did not get the letter
, but Judy Johnson

999
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:36,633
Has her husband only accused
when she was mentally unstable!

1000
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:40,395
After her son happened to terrible.
By lhren clients!

1001
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:44,871
Who are you? How do you just come?
Have you read that here?

1002
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,873
This? You have not accused
against Judy Johnson's man

1003
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:54,239
Because you wanted to endanger not lts witchhunt
to my clients!

1004
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,916
How do you want, all right.
Do you know what I'm going to do now?

1005
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,834
I'm going to judge.
And ask him, you and the entire

1006
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:08,313
District prosecutor accusing her
ethical misconduct.

1007
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:15,353
I rarely saw anything so Explosives
as this handwritten letter

1008
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:20,036
Judy Johnson, who was allegedly not fed
Defense.

1009
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:24,033
The prosecution contends
that they only a typewritten

1010
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:29,956
could pass  Summary to you
because of the large amount of evidence.

1011
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,749
I accept that as an excuse
and shall therefore the action

1012
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:39,710
Reject because ethical misconduct.
On the other hand, the Court approved

1013
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,595
The request of the defense
on interviewing Mrs. Johnson.

1014
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:49,357
It is a very important witness.
- I urge you to withdraw.

1015
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:54,195
The physician is notified.
- Roger. We are on site. Over.

1016
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:01,233
Every day she heard Mr. Davis made her
ridiculous in the News

1017
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,233
And discriminated. I hope
defending regrets the comments.

1018
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:09,233
Where is the dignity of the prosecutor?
The body is not even cold yet!

1019
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:14,474
Read every day that this case
was applied by a madman.

1020
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,471
Judy Johnson...

1021
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,030
It is truly praiseworthy,
that the prosecution

1022
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:23,795
Such compassion has for Mrs. Johnson,
now that she is dead.

1023
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:27,953
She knew she was mentally ill,
but they did not recommend medical help,

1024
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,953
Because they feared that the defense...
- The hunting of defense

1025
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:35,953
Has suffered this woman in a few weeks
more than many of us

1026
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,953
In their entire lives. I tell you,
that it us only because of the grace of God

1027
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,589
Not feel the same.
- Police believe that the death

1028
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:47,593
Judy Johnson is the result of a
extraordinary amount of alcohol.

1029
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:51,593
Mrs. Johnson has held an important role in the McMartin case
.

1030
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:55,070
It was their display,
which led to the first indictment,

1031
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:58,789
Levied against Raymond Buckey.
- Tada!

1032
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:03,713
A gift for an athlete!
Give them as many kilometers

1033
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,315
You can tear down it.
- Judy Johnson is dead

1034
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:11,313
I know Ray, and that is terrible.
We do not need them. Thank you guys!

1035
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:15,234
She was everything we had!
I can not stand this anymore!

1036
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,949
But, keep your from!
- Every night I lie in my bed

1037
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,953
And have only one thought:
Why not 'ne plastic rรผberziehen

1038
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,953
Or cut my wrists?
Or 'n dipper ram in my ear!

1039
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,953
Why do I have to endure anything further?
To experience how these children my

1040
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,953
Pull  skin? As we are humiliated
and lose everything we ever had?

1041
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:39,113
The hate me! I am a figment
hell, worse than a murderer!

1042
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:44,354
The hunt small children before bedtime
with me fear a!

1043
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:50,035
That's right. I'd never lie.
The you really hate.

1044
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:55,478
But we ensure that they hate someone
other, the jury.

1045
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,472
Who?
- Lael Rubin. What do you think

1046
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,473
How they will be lhren case?
You will claim as a photo

1047
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,189
Had a porn magazine,
You are a child molester.

1048
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:10,193
You're a sex fiend, because you sometimes wear
no underpants.

1049
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:14,193
Because you are not behind every woman here,
it serves as proof that you on

1050
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,193
5-year-old stand. What will happen
when presented this case?

1051
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:22,193
Everyone sees the emperor's new clothes.
All are their insinuations

1052
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:26,193
And all that shit look through.
Do you understand? And they will say:

1053
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:30,193
"Here, when a heard in court,
because he put someone up cross

1054
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:33,590
then this should not be Ray Buckey".
OK?

1055
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,873
So, I want you lhren swinging ass
daily on this wheel.

1056
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,396
Or you can Lael Rubin
and Kee McFarlane equal

1057
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,153
Let dance on lhrem grave.
Tata!

1058
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,116
Lot, my son!

1059
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,473
Almost four years have passed since the first arrest in
infamous

1060
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,473
McMartin case passed. Raymond Buckey
and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey-,

1061
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:08,271
The process is finally made.
8 men and 4 women make up the jury.

1062
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:14,915
Mr. Freeman, Raymond Buckey told you,
that he has had sex with children?

1063
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,913
He said he has had sex with children.
- Repeat the words

1064
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,278
That he used it.
- You really want to?

1065
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,673
Well, he said he has a 2-year-old boy
fucked in the ass.

1066
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,752
So what I would never say.
- I know.

1067
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,988
Did he tell you what he used,
as he gave the 2-year-old boy

1068
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:39,995
"Fucked in the ass"?
- He used baby oil or gel.

1069
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:45,993
Did he say, if anything had happened,
when the baby oil or gel

1070
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:49,595
Has not been used?
- Yes. He said that if he uses none,

1071
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:53,593
Then the boy was bleeding.
- Ah! We have a little problem.

1072
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,593
What one, Your Honor?
- I think Mr. Freeman should

1073
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:01,593
take  a lawyer. He told me
that he has done several times perjury

1074
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,559
In other cases.
- When he told you that?

1075
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,830
3 weeks ago.
- You knew before Freemans testimony

1076
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,833
That he has done several times perjury
and share it not with the court?

1077
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,833
I have the circumstance considered until now.
- We must give him immunity

1078
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,833
Or drop the case.
- You can not let that happen.

1079
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,595
Do you know what already tasted the case?
- I do not care,

1080
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:29,593
Which is a procedural violation! Scandalous!
- You might not, but me.

1081
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:33,070
And the citizens of Los Angeles as well.
- Your Honor...

1082
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:37,119
I decide, Mr. Freeman says.
So I grant him immunity.

1083
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:43,548
Miss Rubin planned to the way from the beginning.
- I've made my decision.

1084
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,993
What did you say when Freeman thus
came to you? Do not worry, George.

1085
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,993
Kipp from the garbage, you nothing happens.
- I said nothing of the sort.

1086
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,868
And do not go so
to the public. You're welcome!

1087
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:59,873
The court order says to Mr. Freeman:
bar perjury, you nothing happens.

1088
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:03,873
But for one thing you can give him no
immunity, namely murder.

1089
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:07,873
George Freeman has committed murder?
- Why he has not been charged?

1090
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,748
It has promised him impunity,
for his testimony against Buckey?

1091
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:15,594
No. I will say nothing.
Pull Their own conclusions.

1092
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:19,593
For the prosecution Freeman
is the Whopper de Luxe with extra sauce.

1093
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:26,119
Either you eat the or you have a sensitive stomach
and leaves him lying.

1094
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:31,118
No matter still during this negotiation
I debunk George Freeman as murderers.

1095
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,556
You have nothing in your hand, right?
- Nothing.

1096
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,030
The main witness in child molesters process
George Freeman,

1097
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:42,033
Morning was arrested,
when he failed to appear in court.

1098
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:46,033
Deputies have sought him out in his sister's house
.

1099
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:50,033
There he wanted to go into hiding. They found him hiding behind some crates
,

1100
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:54,033
In the garage. He surrendered to the police to make
no resistance

1101
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:58,716
And will appear in court tomorrow.
- You are mad at me, right?

1102
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,236
You know that.
- Were you worried that I said,

1103
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,756
I would unmask a murderer?
- Try it.

1104
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:12,359
Have you ever been convicted of anything,
what could be called child abuse?

1105
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,994
Yes.
- Is it true,

1106
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:19,393
You time your mother and sister Their
tied, looted their house

1107
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:24,838
And which left both without scruples?
- Knows that God alone.

1108
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,357
Right. Mr. Freeman,
You are lhrer own opinion

1109
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,915
A credible man?
- No.

1110
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,836
Well, that's all. Thank you.

1111
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:46,113
Have reported in an interview with Mr. sentence
that 60 children Raymond Buckey

1112
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:50,113
have accused  abuse,
before the case came before the grand jury?

1113
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,795
I think that's right.
- You have not feared

1114
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:58,351
You could hinder the investigation?
- Yes, I was very worried so

1115
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:02,877
I would Mr. sentence said the same.
- So worried that you attracted to him!

1116
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,509
Objection, Your Honor.
Miss McFarlane intimate relationships

1117
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,990
Have nothing to do with the case.
- Sustained.

1118
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,675
Keep up to judge
qualified for whether a child

1119
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:17,673
Was abused or not?
- Opposition. Miss McFarlane is here

1120
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,196
Not in court.
Even if Mr. Davis wanted to.

1121
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,193
Has Miss Ruby fear? Miss McFarlane
of public prosecution

1122
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,193
Praised as their experts.
Are you afraid that they meet the requirements

1123
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:33,068
No longer could meet?
- Opposition rejected.

1124
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:39,753
Thank you, Your Honor. Please answer.
Keep qualified for?

1125
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:44,391
I've been working in this field,
I consider myself quite qualified for.

1126
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:48,393
What training you have the psychotherapeutic treatment for
?

1127
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:52,393
A diploma as a social worker.
- Contained LHR study also lectures

1128
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,914
About child abuse?
- Yes.

1129
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,189
How were the fundraising?
- Well, it was a free trial program.

1130
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:03,717
With psychology, sociology. And this
basic courses were aimed at children.

1131
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:08,396
Have you ever children
treated in the psychiatric sense?

1132
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:12,833
I do not understand what you mean.
- You know what is psychiatry?

1133
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:16,833
Psychiatry...
- Objection! He should not mock.

1134
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:21,914
If you do not know what is psychiatry,
and she pretended to be an expert,

1135
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,436
Then the court should know that.
- Opposition rejected.

1136
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,433
Thank you, Your Honor. Please answer my question
. Have you ever children

1137
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,432
Treated in the psychiatric sense?
- No.

1138
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:36,433
How have they treated?
- As a social worker, clearly.

1139
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,910
You have worked in Maryland, New Jersey and California
?

1140
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,912
Yes.
- You were allowed in New Jersey?

1141
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,833
No.
- In California or Maryland?

1142
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,310
No.
- You are not authorized in any state

1143
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,718
As a therapist or social worker?
- That is correct.

1144
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:58,237
Where did you learn these techniques,
you have applied to the children?

1145
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:02,233
Working with families and attending many meetings
on child abuse.

1146
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:06,757
I do not know any library that contains at this topic
so many books like mine.

1147
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:11,038
I ask to step forward to be allowed to.
We would like to present some evidence.

1148
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,076
CCFL.
- CCFL?

1149
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,356
Your Honor? Thank you.

1150
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,792
You have used those dolls?
- Yes.

1151
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:32,636
Why?
- To the kids in their body parts

1152
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:36,599
to make  familiar.
So they can talk about it.

1153
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:40,593
It's hard for them to name them.
Some of them can not express

1154
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:44,070
What happened to them.
- How did you know

1155
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,596
That them what happened?
- I found that out.

1156
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:51,593
They saw the children only a few minutes
and you pulled the doll out.

1157
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:55,070
How could you know that?
- Because of their behavior and...

1158
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:59,392
Because they did not want to talk about it.
- Perhaps because nothing happened to them?

1159
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:03,393
It was them something done, Mr. Davis!
- Presented Show with puppets teacher?

1160
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:06,313
Yes.
- To Raymond Buckey represent

1161
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:11,119
Do not chose a true black doll,
, Miss McFarlane.

1162
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:15,113
The children they have chosen.
- Your Honor, I would like cutouts

1163
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:19,113
A videotape that Miss McFarlane
has recorded from Children

1164
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,634
submit  as evidence.
- Good.

1165
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,796
Thank you.

1166
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:32,314
In their dress they pussies.
And what have the little guys down there?

1167
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,472
Guess.
A real small penis!

1168
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:42,629
What do you think,
what would be a good doll for Ray?

1169
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:46,909
I do not know.
- Well, how about...

1170
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:50,316
Of here? Yes?

1171
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:01,353
What I like are the pubic hair,
although they do not look like real.

1172
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,193
You are curled.
- Do you see?

1173
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:09,355
He has a hair on his long, powerful
, ugly penis!

1174
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:13,393
You wanted to teach them racism?
- I associate dark skin

1175
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:17,393
Not necessarily racism.
- You wanted it so do not suggest

1176
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:21,393
Ray Buckey would be a bad person?
- With a black doll I connect

1177
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:25,393
No negative character.
- To which aimed lts Note:

1178
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:29,917
"You see, he has a hair
on its long, powerful,

1179
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,716
ugly penis"?

1180
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:37,793
I have said in all dolls so what.
I show them thus: I am someone

1181
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:41,509
Which they can tell everything.
And who is this?

1182
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,796
Miss Peggy.
- Miss Peggy!

1183
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:50,518
What do you mean, she does not
funny looking breasts?

1184
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,193
You see those here that protrude so?
Have you ever breasts

1185
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,475
Seen with such buttons?

1186
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,433
A few children from kindergarten
told me that her real name

1187
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,308
Miss Piggy is because it is so thick.
Is that correct?

1188
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,829
Why do you say Miss Piggy
instead Miss Peggy? What do you mean,

1189
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:15,595
If you talk about breasts with buttons?
- You do not understand

1190
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:19,593
How scared these children were!
I fought her inhibitions.

1191
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:23,468
Distinguish Teachers,
was extremely important!

1192
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:28,633
Well, little monkey. Will you behave now
stupid or smart?

1193
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:32,395
So you can help us.
Some people believe namely,

1194
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:37,076
That you're stupid, little monkey!
- No, I'm clever!

1195
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,156
Certainly?
- Hm

1196
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,711
Okay.
The little monkey is a coward!

1197
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:50,113
He does not remember any of the
Nackedei games. But we,

1198
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:53,909
We know a game, which is followed
the little monkey will remember.

1199
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,595
It is the Naked Movie Star Game.
Is it hard for you again

1200
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:03,710
Or is your memory that bad?
- You said to Sam, he was stupid.

1201
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:08,431
The fact that he was a coward and that he had
a lousy memory, right?

1202
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,433
I told the doll.
- You do not think that Sam believed

1203
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:16,115
You would call him stupid?
- If I had feared that,

1204
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,156
I never talked so!

1205
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,513
So, the other children, who
the Ray doll taken

1206
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,556
And did. The!

1207
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:31,308
Want him so beat,
like the other kids?

1208
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,356
Come on!

1209
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:38,112
Well done! That's good for you! OK then!

1210
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:42,192
Want to punch him? Only about!
Yes, good!

1211
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:48,394
Why did you instigated it,
the doll that personifies Ray,

1212
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:52,792
Beating? Tempted to believe not
a child, he was a bad person?

1213
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,793
Not at all! This is part of the therapy.
It is better to let out anger,

1214
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,793
Than to bury them in the subconscious.
Displacement is very dangerous

1215
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,429
Comparable to a time bomb,
the incessant ticking.

1216
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:08,229
Their assistant has learned from you?
- Yes she has.

1217
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,472
but it was originally Posted
to use the video camera.

1218
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,473
You acknowledge the correct training
a very high priority!

1219
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,473
Miss McFarlane, that is, and I quote,
"One of the worst cases

1220
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,189
child abuse
in the history of the world".

1221
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:28,193
Why you did not bring a specialist?
- Most lacked the courage to do

1222
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:31,670
What was needed.
- Courage, what to do?

1223
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:35,471
Quite simply,
out the truth.

1224
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:40,553
Do you remember how many times you your mom
asked if something happened?

1225
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,596
159 times.

1226
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:48,990
Ah! I know what we do now.
I've already

1227
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:53,676
Played with another girl.
Here is the big bird

1228
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:58,231
From Sesame Street. The other little girl
let him squeak.

1229
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,073
Once for no and twice for yes.

1230
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:07,077
Can you do that too?
Once for no and twice for yes.

1231
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,876
Good.

1232
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:16,829
As you Jenny in kindergarten touched, she was da
begrabscht of one hand?

1233
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,876
No.
- No.

1234
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:24,351
Does Ray sometimes disgusting things driven
with the kids?

1235
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,396
No.
- No!

1236
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,833
Occasionally take people we
like to have, children sensitive

1237
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:36,870
And particularly ticklish spots on.
Does Ray done in other children?

1238
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,350
No. But we want to hear no more no's
!

1239
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,396
No, no, no, no!

1240
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,753
They told the parents of this girl,
that she had been abused. Correctly?

1241
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,231
Yes. And that the child is displaced.
- Did the parents all videotapes?

1242
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,632
What do you mean, please?
- Whether the parents saw all the tapes?

1243
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:00,679
No. We have 400 children interviewed
and every day have reported more.

1244
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:04,673
I konstatiere: So you needed
only to press the button and then

1245
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:09,834
Earnings were very lhrer hand.
Whether it was abused or not?

1246
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,833
You overestimate my abilities.
The very idea that a child

1247
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,595
After 1 or 2 hours with me says,
it was misused

1248
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:21,229
Makes me almost a genius!
- Children...

1249
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:27,478
3-6
can be very easily influenced.

1250
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:31,593
In this age they still believe in fairy tales and miracles
.

1251
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,831
It is very easy to intimidate them.

1252
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:42,313
You have said,
not Miss McFarlane?

1253
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:46,313
I knew what would happen if I give this
videos to the public.

1254
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:50,313
That people like you hold me everything.
But someone had to do it, Mr. Davis,

1255
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:54,678
So that children can tell the truth.
- The truth?

1256
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,238
And only you could find out?
- What for amounts that?

1257
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:03,233
That I tried to instil false memories
harmless children?

1258
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:06,790
Do you think I do that out of vanity?
- No. I think,

1259
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,793
They had for a very noble reason.
They believed namely actually,

1260
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:14,793
That these children were traumatized.
And moreover you wanted them

1261
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:18,793
Further trauma through this process
spare. But I also think

1262
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,793
You knew how dangerous this
manner of approach,

1263
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:26,316
Because it is suggestive.
This technique can only be applied,

1264
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:30,313
If the abuse is clearly demonstrated.
Here are such evidence does not exist.

1265
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:34,598
But they turned it on anyway.
And Their results should be evidence.

1266
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:38,593
Ridiculous! There was this abuse.
The children do not lie to me!

1267
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:42,593
I can prove it! Only you and the
whole legal system they want to keep,

1268
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:46,593
Telling the truth.
- But you do not see her face.

1269
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:51,356
Because the truth is:
You're not listening to the children.

1270
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:55,553
You closed from the truth,
you you so desperately

1271
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:59,030
Tried to explain.
Instead planted

1272
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:02,829
In the lively imagination of children
at the end of notions of something

1273
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:06,549
That has never taken place.
- Why should I do that?

1274
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:11,634
I do not know. I just know you're
Mr. sentence met, right?

1275
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:15,429
And that you were to
Jeanne d'Arc children move suddenly.

1276
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:19,308
For ardent campaigner for the rights of children
to their Savior!

1277
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:23,313
Certainly the temptation was too tempting.
- What temptation?

1278
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:27,313
In talk shows to be hosted.
Things were wonderful for you!

1279
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:30,790
Your Honor, objection!
- It was fantastic!

1280
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:36,034
It is enough. Objection sustained.
- Thank you. No further questions.

1281
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:43,393
Raymond Buckey has now spent five years
in prison without bail

1282
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:47,393
to freely come . This is unique
in California history and has

1283
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:51,393
Performed in jurisdictions to criticism.
But today has Judge Pounders Buckey

1284
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:55,393
The bail granted
and him into the custody of his lawyer

1285
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:00,235
Daniel Davis transferred.
- Stay there! Reply!

1286
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:06,430
Let us through.
- How's lhrer family?

1287
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:10,953
Come on, Buckey, you know that you are predisposed
pedophile.

1288
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,953
You can only children to have sex,
because you can not force anything.

1289
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,953
Quit, I can not stand it anymore!
- Ok, all right. Chill out.

1290
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:23,477
With such crap you tomorrow bomb
all day long.

1291
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:27,473
Above all, you need to see the jury
eyes. Always look the other way!

1292
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:31,155
You must keep up with any eye contact.
- I can not do it.

1293
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:35,153
Why not? What are you afraid of?
- I sat 5 years in prison!

1294
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:39,153
I react just not normal.
When I think of this woman,

1295
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:43,153
The lies about me spread
and gets me, as often as they want!

1296
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:47,153
Maybe I start to howl!
- And that's exactly

1297
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:52,075
What they want to achieve.
Ok, that's what you're afraid.

1298
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,471
Do you want to know what I fear?

1299
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:00,879
I have to be a sleazy shyster afraid
.

1300
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,396
In order to live,
I represent drug dealer and scum.

1301
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:08,393
I'm afraid that Rubin, Ira Reiner
and all the public prosecutor

1302
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:13,793
Eat me alive. But I
something that did not, Ray.

1303
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:18,715
And you are. And the only
what you have, that's me.

1304
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:26,752
I go tomorrow in this courtroom,
swallow my fear down and fight.

1305
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:30,753
And tell them something,
what in this process until now

1306
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:34,753
Would not listen, Ray. The truth.
And the jury will believe us

1307
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:38,799
Or not, my friend.
If they believe us, Ray,

1308
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:44,079
You'll be a free man.
And if not...

1309
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,956
Yes.
- You understand.

1310
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,913
Yes, I understand.
- You hear all these kids

1311
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,913
You accuse, they abused to have
to killing animals

1312
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,913
And have threatened them, their parents
kill if they reveal anything.

1313
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,436
Have lied all these children?
- No not all.

1314
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:08,433
What do you mean by "not all"?
- I think some were enticed

1315
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:14,629
To believe this had happened everything.
- To be able to please step forward, Your Honor.

1316
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,595
Do you know of these photographs?

1317
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:25,314
What have you got? Are you afraid?
Take them into the hand.

1318
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:29,633
Will you please describe to the jury,
which can be seen on the First.

1319
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:35,033
A man who met a woman orally.
- Why you have the picture?

1320
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,989
To masturbation.
- You have previously masturbated, right?

1321
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:42,516
Tell how you have done that.
- What do you mean?

1322
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:46,513
Is it so that you glued the photo to the window
lhres room and on the bed

1323
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:51,116
Masturbated in a position so that you
everyone saw from the road?

1324
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:54,988
No, that's not true.
- Two neighbors say the but.

1325
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:58,993
One can not see in my room.
- Do you think a person who does,

1326
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:02,993
Should work in a kindergarten?
- I think it has nothing to do

1327
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:06,516
With the kindergarten.
- Why They tore the picture then,

1328
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:09,990
When the police arrived?
- I was afraid of,

1329
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,834
What would they make of it.
- What do you mean by "make it"?

1330
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:17,833
What you are now trying to make something of it.
- Is it so that you in kindergarten

1331
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:21,833
Often rumgelungert the pool?
In wide shorts without underwear,

1332
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:25,674
So Their genitals were exposed?
- No, that is not true.

1333
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,673
Although I was not wearing underwear,
but the shorts went down to his knees.

1334
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,673
So you're just a normal
heterosexual, typical young man.

1335
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:37,673
Is that so, Mr. Buckey?
- Who can say of himself?

1336
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,673
Is it so that the only satisfaction
you've ever had or will have,

1337
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,673
Has occurred with these children?
They are incapable of satisfying sex

1338
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,593
To have with an adult woman?

1339
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,514
I have never committed a lot of mistakes
, no doubt.

1340
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:59,832
I'm not perfect, but I had
never sexual intercourse with children!

1341
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:03,833
And I've never hurt a child.
And I was very comfortable

1342
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:08,710
Quite outstanding sex
with an adult woman, Miss Ruby!

1343
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:13,191
Are you interested in pyramids?
- Objection! Irrelevant.

1344
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,714
Rejected.
- What are pyramids?

1345
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:21,313
Many believe in their positive effects
on all living things. You sleep better

1346
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:25,313
If รผberm bed depends, superstition.
- Flew to a fan meeting,

1347
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:29,313
Where pyramids were sold?
- Opposition. I suggest

1348
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:33,109
That we will discuss with you.
- All right.

1349
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,833
Your honor, I must protest.
Miss Ruby tries just here

1350
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:42,833
Pyramids to transform into pentagrams.
- They called Peggy Buckey a

1351
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:46,833
Caring teacher. What man
allows one who takes drugs

1352
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:51,630
To work in a kindergarten?
Objection overruled. Go on.

1353
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:55,508
to be able to step forward  Please, Your Honor.
- Granted.

1354
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:01,197
Displays this photo you at a meeting
and hold a pyramid in hand?

1355
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,953
Yes.
- Seeing that woman right?

1356
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:11,875
Yes.
- Who is Diana Sullivan?

1357
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:16,275
What can I say about them?
We had a relationship.

1358
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:20,319
but  Two investigators she
something tells another.

1359
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:25,313
It's of no consequence, right?
- Prosecutors drags them.

1360
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:29,313
And she will tell you that you can not have sex with women
.

1361
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:33,473
That will hurt us, Ray.
- This is Diana do.

1362
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:37,473
Ah yes, why not?
Because you suddenly and unexpectedly

1363
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:43,749
Were to a great seducer, Ray?
- I know that they will not do that.

1364
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:48,273
Mrs. Sullivan, you have 1984 tells
that you never intercourse

1365
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:50,316
With Buckey had?
- Yes.

1366
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:54,750
And to whom?
- Several people. my fiance

1367
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:58,476
And investigators
who interviewed me back then.

1368
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:02,473
So why did those words mean?
- Because I protect my reputation and...

1369
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,473
My wedding did not want to jeopardize.
- And were in the final weeks

1370
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:10,473
Again investigators from Miss Rubins office
with you in Montana

1371
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,915
And you have visited?
- Yes.

1372
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:18,993
What concern they?
- Talk to me about my statement.

1373
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:23,915
They interrogated me in front of my children.
The thought I have to go to prison.

1374
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,118
What exactly did they want?
- Be sure that I assert here

1375
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:32,671
I never slept with Mr. Buckey.
- And did you and Mr. Buckey

1376
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,035
A sexual relationship?
- Yes.

1377
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,912
Thank you, that was all.
- Mrs. Sullivan,

1378
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,437
Change frequently Their Partners?
- No, not at all.

1379
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:49,752
And you like the attention,
which brings the process?

1380
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:55,073
No. I know that my children
will also be affected.

1381
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:59,837
You Had
intercourse difficulties with Mr. Buckey?

1382
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:05,916
What do you mean, trouble?
- Was it necessary to stimulate him orally,

1383
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,709
Because Mr. Buckey was no other way to satisfy
?

1384
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,596
No!

1385
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:17,229
Did not you say the investigators?
- Nothing like that.

1386
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:21,438
Are you sure?
- I never would have so expressed.

1387
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:25,752
What term would you have chosen
Mrs. Sullivan?

1388
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:28,513
I would have said "a blow".

1389
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:36,033
Today Mr. Buckey is the 6th day
on the witness stand. Miss Ruby has the

1390
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:40,033
Probably worst abuser
history caused to admit

1391
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:44,033
That he was not wearing underwear,
that he smoked marijuana,

1392
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:48,750
That he in the power of the pyramids...
- today The last sandwich.

1393
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:52,719
Yes? Would you like to have that?
- No. Actually yet.

1394
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:58,034
... 400 times child abuse goes
and a nationwide hysteria unleashed.

1395
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:01,556
Have found these items in
lhrem room?

1396
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:03,995
Yes.
- You have early

1397
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:08,553
Pornography interested. How old
were you when you recorded the image?

1398
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:13,031
I was approximately 11 years old.
- It is very perfect for this age!

1399
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:16,874
I always got myself Playboy Magazine
and have it signed.

1400
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:20,509
You have since drawn pubic hair,
see?

1401
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:23,832
And nipples. Here you can see?

1402
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:34,996
Coming back to the pyramids. Are
the Their books?

1403
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:37,236
Yes.
- Find it normal,

1404
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:42,113
In lhrem age to believe in pyramids?
- Well. Furthermore I laugh long.

1405
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:46,398
Today, yes. But then surely not?
- No, I... Not before.

1406
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:50,473
See where this so-called Ray-Dom?
- Yes, but he's only.

1407
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:54,473
That has nothing to do with me.
- I did not ask. Is the action

1408
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,473
A beam cathedral or Ray-Doms 40 times
as large as that of a normal pyramid?

1409
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:02,473
Objection, your honor! That
pure speculation about the...

1410
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:05,074
Wattage of a beam cathedral.

1411
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,992
It is the lovely piece of you?
- No.

1412
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:18,991
Who then?
- My sister.

1413
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:23,915
Who bought her?
- The father of her boyfriend. A joke.

1414
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:32,312
Are these naked beings you?
- No.

1415
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:35,312
Who then?
- You are my mother.

1416
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:39,590
It lifts them on for ages.
For their grandchildren.

1417
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:51,070
What does it mean?
- This is a pyramid hat.

1418
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:55,196
A pyramid hat.

1419
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:07,309
Is it really?
- You... need to turn it.

1420
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:16,113
Mr. Buckey, it is possible
that the power of the pyramids

1421
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:19,636
She seduced the child abuse?
- No.

1422
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:23,633
This force has blocked LHR brain
so you forgot horrible things?

1423
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:26,632
How the abuse of children?
- No.

1424
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:30,633
That you never ever children
abused, that might be?

1425
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:34,110
Yes.
- Watch the jury in the eye

1426
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,714
And answer the question:

1427
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:45,032
Have you ever abused a child?

1428
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,790
No.

1429
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:09,358
Do you want to train?
- The jury has decided.

1430
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:15,474
Have you experienced this now?
- I've already experienced at night.

1431
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:20,793
With the reading of the judgment
today begins the negotiation morning.

1432
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:25,876
Rift over 13 points.
- Is that good or bad?

1433
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:32,430
Your mother is accused in 13 points.
When there are not agreed to,

1434
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:39,432
Then that is not good for us.
This can also be just a coincidence,

1435
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,910
And thus is even
not the end of everything.

1436
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:48,752
I can keep on deposit there.
We will appeal.

1437
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:51,434
We find sufficient reasons.

1438
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:57,950
It sorry, Ray.
I never thought

1439
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:02,030
That 12 people all this crap
would believe.

1440
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:07,599
I just was not good enough, Ray.
- No, Danny.

1441
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:15,075
You were the best. You have done what was in
lhrer power.

1442
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:20,477
I have always known,
that this can not end well.

1443
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:23,076
I that my own bag.

1444
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:38,673
You have come to the decision?
- We are, Your Honor.

1445
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:42,196
Hand over the officer
the forms

1446
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:44,953
So that the Court may examine them.

1447
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:16,073
The chairman will read the verdict.

1448
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:36,592
In the present case, the state
California against Raymond Buckey

1449
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:40,355
And Peggy McMartin Buckey-we are,
the jury,

1450
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:44,399
The defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey-
and Ray Charles Buckey...

1451
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:48,473
Not guilty of abuse of children under 14 years

1452
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:53,395
And breach of paragraph 288 A
of the Criminal Code.

1453
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:57,393
Oh my God!
- Is so LHR judgment?

1454
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:02,996
Yes, Your Honor.
- You got to the unanimous verdict?

1455
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:06,470
Yes, Your Honor.
- Prefer the prosecution

1456
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:10,473
Question the jury still single?
I want the jury for its employees

1457
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:14,473
Thank in this most important case.
- Are you happy, Ray?

1458
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,473
Have the verdict expected?
- We are very happy.

1459
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:22,473
Ray, what are you doing now?
Do you want to write a book?

1460
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:26,997
Ray, what did you do now?
What will you do as a free man?

1461
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:30,152
What are you doing now?
- Thank you. Thank you.

1462
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:33,474
We are very happy.

1463
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:43,873
It is over! Finally it has a...
- I've been watching you all the time

1464
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,873
And wondered what you might think.
How difficult it all for you

1465
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:51,873
must have been . I could see how
strives They were not to cry,

1466
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:55,873
But sometimes failed you.
- The Diary your mother is touching.

1467
01:59:55,960 --> 02:00:01,114
The kindergarten was your purpose in life.
- I'm not bitter.

1468
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:05,029
I was brought up,
to forgive the people.

1469
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:09,110
We have lost everything.
We have nothing

1470
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:14,994
Nothing saved!
Mama, we have nothing at all!

1471
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:19,039
If Ray because the 13 question
points back to court?

1472
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:23,033
If you do that to the children, the
is the biggest abuse of all time.

1473
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:26,510
The justice has been done.
- Today I examine

1474
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:30,513
The McMartin scandal. What went wrong? Will he
a grim era of

1475
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:34,513
trigger  molester movies?
- The legal system is perhaps

1476
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:38,036
been done  satisfied,
but justice not.

1477
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:42,113
On, America wax!
- And here are some angry,

1478
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:46,113
Utmost applied parents.
- We are concerned parents

1479
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:51,194
Across America. The case is
again negotiated, certainly.

1480
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:54,956
The waves beat high,
dissatisfaction is very large.

1481
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,953
The diminish in any way the,
which had to go through these children.

1482
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:02,919
What they will remember all their lives
.

1483
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:11,511
The prosecution decided
again to complain against Ray Buckey.

1484
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:18,668
We want to discuss something with you,
what will please you.

1485
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:22,196
Where's Ruby?
- You no longer processed in this case.

1486
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:26,193
You wanted to Santa Monica.
- Because the New York Times their behavior

1487
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:30,193
As vile and some...
- Let us please come to the point.

1488
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:34,193
We want the state to spare costs.
It has already spent enough money.

1489
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:38,831
I bet that there are the bands.
Finally has a spotted the tapes

1490
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:42,469
Right?
- We do not yet talked to Reiner,

1491
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,075
We are safe with him...
- That's bullshit! Clear?

1492
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:50,073
We would otherwise not be sitting here.
He wants to be attorney general.

1493
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:55,075
If you lose again, you are
Their jobs going. What do you offer me?

1494
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:59,073
I'll tell you what I think the case over
. The best solution

1495
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:02,550
For Reiner,
would be a "nolo contendere".

1496
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:13,117
The my client has to decide.
There is no admission of guilt.

1497
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:18,069
And you can say, sit
not decrease, because the offer is too good.

1498
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:22,119
You are slightly
sentenced for each child. No prison sentence.

1499
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:26,113
That does not mean that I'm guilty?
- No. This means that you say

1500
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:29,795
"I take the offer, it's too good,
to it refuse".

1501
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:35,352
Is that all? Then nothing?
- You have to report to the police.

1502
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:39,919
Report? How come?
- Because you are a sex offender.

1503
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:46,473
Are you trying to take that again?
- I will not without due process

1504
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:49,996
can win  why?
- We are not yet through a ride.

1505
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:56,189
Forget the dream. I'm done,
I'm done! I'm burned out.

1506
02:02:56,280 --> 02:03:00,193
You no longer hold it by also.
They wanted to then hang

1507
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:04,796
Do not talk about a second process.
- Ok, I thought about killing myself.

1508
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:08,793
Ok! But never, at no time,
times when it was not really bad...

1509
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:12,793
Listen to me! Not even I
thought for giving that

1510
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,793
What they now ask me.
I do not write on a sheet of paper

1511
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:19,075
"I am a pedophile". No way!

1512
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:27,075
It says, "The play is over,
if the diva singing the final aria".

1513
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:30,072
I'm afraid she has already sung.

1514
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:34,352
Thank you. Hey! How's it going, Danny?

1515
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:42,270
What do you expect from the second process?
- You have made me an offer.

1516
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:46,273
But I said no.
- Hey! Wait it out!

1517
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:50,273
Throw to the camera, quickly!
- You know, I promised Martinez,

1518
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:53,432
That nobody learns.
- And what now?

1519
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:00,236
Mr. Martinez! Can Ray Buckey
proposed a deal?

1520
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:04,873
No. Not even in a dream! We would
Ray Buckey never make an offer,

1521
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:08,999
Even if he dreams of. Good day.
- Do's.

1522
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,074
He lies off the ass!
- What?

1523
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:19,234
I said, "He's lying his ass off!"
- Come on, guys! Admission.

1524
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:23,553
Martinez is a liar. I met with him and cut
with the conversation.

1525
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:27,553
If you want, you can hear it.
- I'll tell you how I

1526
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:31,679
The case think: The best solution,
for Reiner is a nolo contendere.

1527
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:33,716
Thank you.
- Thanks, Danny.

1528
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:43,594
You were right. The Diva has still far sung
final aria.

1529
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:55,675
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury!
Are you reached a verdict?

1530
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:59,673
We arrived in any of the charges
to a unanimous decision.

1531
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:03,673
Because disagree, we are also not unanimous

1532
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,955
Decision achieve more.

1533
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:10,515
The McMartin case is closed.
He took 7 years

1534
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:14,559
Cost 15 million dollars
and there was not a single conviction.

1535
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:27,268
Is funny.
7 years and in a minute...

1536
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:32,351
Is final. That's so crazy.
- No.

1537
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:37,350
It's not the end,
not for me.

1538
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:41,353
If one happens to something,
then begins not simply

1539
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:45,353
On with his life from the beginning.
Not at my age.

1540
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:50,195
The time gives back no.
- We do not want to offend, Danny.

1541
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:53,033
We are very grateful.
But...

1542
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:58,153
This thing will attach us forever.
- People have a short memory.

1543
02:05:58,240 --> 02:06:02,358
A scandal in the newspaper, 'ne Sensation
on television, people forget quickly.

1544
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:05,876
There are the abusers.
- Child molester!

1545
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:10,238
What do you want, huh?
Tell me that even in the face?

1546
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,476
Molester. Can you see it?

1547
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:18,878
The People will not forget that.
And they do not care,

1548
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,073
That they have ruined our lives.
And not only ours.

1549
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:25,993
Also the parents. And the children!

1550
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:32,437
Why did God not prevent this?
- Oh, no, give God not blame.

1551
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:36,274
What happened to us,
was only the work of men.

1552
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:40,558
God could not intervene.
Who developed already the time

1553
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:45,634
listening  on what he says?
They were all busy

1554
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:48,196
Watch television.

1555
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:10,638
The McMartin family
still lives in Southern California.

1556
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:18,353
Peggy suffered a nervous breakdown
and still suffers from claustrophobia.

1557
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:22,797
She lives with her mother Virginia
and her son Ray.

1558
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,793
Peggy Ann was confirmed as a teacher in a
trial again.

1559
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:30,031
She is now married, has 2 children.

1560
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:35,671
1990 Lael Rubin's nomination for
judge rejected the Court of Appeal.

1561
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:39,673
You still works at the
prosecutor of Los Angeles.

1562
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:43,196
Died in 1992 Wayne sentence with 47 years
