[dramatic music]

2
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:31,367
- Goddamn car,
goddamn fucking car!

3
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:32,333
I'll be lucky if I
can get out of here

4
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,093
with a full wallet
and a cheery ass.

5
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:37,097
[cat meows]

6
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:41,894
Where the hell's the bus stop?

7
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:50,075
Oh.

8
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,402
Great!

9
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:09,198
Oh my god.

10
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:11,717
Have I got money?

11
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:23,073
[dramatic music]

12
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:26,870
What?

13
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:29,770
What?

14
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,118
Come back, you son of a bitch!

15
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,913
I hope you get hemorrhoids
the size of golf balls!

16
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:35,603
Asshole!

17
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:49,893
[children shouting]

18
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,211
[cat meows]

00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,075
[dog barking]

20
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,189
Oh god.

21
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,294
I'd give my soul for
a way outta here!

22
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:30,071
[groans] Shit!

23
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,694
Great, what else
can happen to me?

24
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,116
Hey, who are you,
what are you doing?

25
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:41,255
- Quiet!

26
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,429
- Shut up, man.

27
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:42,843
- Get his wallet.

28
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:44,741
- Fine then.

29
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,572
- Give us your money, man,
or we'll fuck you up good.

30
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:50,437
[groaning]

31
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:50,816
- It's in my wallet.

32
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,475
I must have dropped
it when I fell.

33
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:55,649
- [Man] That's bullshit.

34
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,237
Give it up or you're hamburger.

35
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,480
- Come on, man,
let's cut him up.

36
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,689
Make him all pretty
for the funeral.

37
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:03,795
- What do you think,
man, closed coffin?

38
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:04,830
- [Man] If you prefer.

39
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:09,663
After all, it's your funeral.

40
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:13,667
- You're dead.

41
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,160
[weapons clattering]

42
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:33,825
- Children.

43
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:39,831
- Thank you.

44
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,146
My name is--

45
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:47,148
- I know who you are.

46
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:49,461
Assistant Professor Orlan Sands.

47
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:50,324
- I owe you my life.

48
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,156
- [Man] It's a debt I
intend to collect.

49
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,333
[calm music]

50
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,705
- [sighs] There's just
something about rushing water.

51
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,120
- Do you have to go
to the bathroom?

52
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,466
- No, dummy.

53
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:06,573
It's peaceful and safe.

54
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:09,817
Like an angel protecting
you with wings of crystal.

55
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:12,026
Kinda like being back
in the womb, I guess.

56
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:14,926
- You get all that from
being on a rowboat?

57
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:17,515
- Bozo, it's kinda
romantic, don't you think?

58
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:19,551
Or dontcha?

59
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:20,690
- Uh huh, just for that,
you don't get this.

60
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:24,245
- Jack, what is it?

61
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:25,799
- Well, as long as I'm a
bozo, you'll never find out.

62
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:31,149
[laughs] Say you're sorry
and I'll give it to you.

63
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,461
- Okay, I'm...

64
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:34,221
Not sorry!

65
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:37,776
[laughs] Take that!

66
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:39,364
- Oh, have mercy.

67
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:39,847
Uncle, uncle!

68
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:44,162
- Ha!

69
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:45,853
New title holder, undefeated.

70
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,443
[Jack claps]

71
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:54,759
Oh, Jack.

72
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:57,071
They're beautiful.

73
00:06:59,177 --> 00:06:59,833
Why two?

74
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:13,294
[laughs]

75
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,486
[crying]

76
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,049
For how long?

77
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:52,368
- Always.

78
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:55,682
[kissing]

79
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:01,032
[laughs]

80
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,246
- First, we'll call your mother.

81
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:10,628
No, wait, we better call mine
or she'll never forgive us.

82
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:11,698
Oh, and we've got to
get our pictures taken

83
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,113
for the newspapers.
- Yes.

84
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:15,253
- And we'll have to make
announcements made up.

85
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,773
Oh, we'll have to
get a good caterer.

86
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:19,188
Oh, and of course we're gonna
have to have it videotaped.

87
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,879
Colors!

88
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,742
What colors do you
see for us, Jack?

89
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:23,157
- Colors, colors.

90
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:24,711
Blue and white.

91
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,229
- Oh, blue and white,
get outta here.

92
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,300
I was thinking more along the
lines of indigo and cream.

93
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:32,063
- [laughs] What's
indigo and cream?

94
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,824
- Blue and white.

95
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:35,687
- Blue and white.

96
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,413
[laughs]

97
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:42,349
I don't care if I have to
marry you in polka dots,

98
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:42,832
leopard skin.

99
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:45,870
You know why?

100
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,491
- No.

101
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:49,667
- Well, if you don't, maybe
I better not marry you.

102
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,359
[laughs]

103
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,706
[ominous music]

104
00:08:57,951 --> 00:08:58,641
Orlan, your timing.

105
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:01,644
- I have to talk to you.

106
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:03,646
[Jack sighs]

107
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:13,311
The guy scares me, Jack.

108
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:13,863
Big time.

109
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:17,936
- Has he made contact since?

110
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,667
- [Orlan] This came three
days ago after that night.

111
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:30,570
[sighs]

112
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,018
- It's the Red Spider cult.

113
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:34,056
I've heard of it.

114
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:34,850
Very nasty characters.

115
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:39,855
A nightmare
anthology, my friend.

116
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,513
Did you call the cops?

117
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,792
- I was too scared.

118
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,380
Besides, I drove by the next day

119
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,763
after I picked up my car
and the bodies were gone.

120
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:53,316
- What do you think
it's all about?

121
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:53,834
- I don't know.

122
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,389
If he wanted to eliminate me

123
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,738
as a witness to the two
killings, he could've done it
then.

124
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:03,257
- And this note's been the
only contact he's made since?

125
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:03,982
- Yeah, except that...

126
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,505
I know this sounds paranoid,

127
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:10,368
but I'd swear that someone
went through my desk

128
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:11,990
at the museum.

129
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,578
The drawer wasn't broken

130
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,787
but there were scratches
all around the lock.

131
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:17,478
- What could they
be looking for?

132
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:17,996
- I don't know.

133
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,068
I don't answer the
telephone anymore.

134
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,449
I'm afraid to go home!

135
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:23,070
Look.

136
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:27,834
- Is that thing loaded?

137
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:32,390
[laughs]

138
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,667
Give me that.

139
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,255
- You know I gotta be desperate

140
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:35,911
if I'm hauling
around one of these.

141
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:38,845
- You're gonna need it.

142
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,679
Someday you're gonna wake
up with a crowd around you

143
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:48,855
and I'm not gonna be
there to save you.

144
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:51,581
- What am I gonna do?

145
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,762
- [sighs] What's the guy's name?

146
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:00,660
[dramatic music]

147
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,109
- Shit!

148
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:04,042
- Spithrachne summons you.

149
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,250
- Get your paw off my friend.

150
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,323
You can tell Spittoon he's busy.

151
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:13,569
[smacks]

152
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:37,006
[water splashes]

153
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:47,016
[grunts]

154
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,882
[smacking]

155
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:23,501
[nunchucks whooshing]

156
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,699
[smacking]

157
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,362
[water splashing]

158
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:08,442
- Master?

159
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,067
- I like your style.

160
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,554
[Jack screaming]

161
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:17,037
Too bad it's outdated.

162
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:25,183
[water splashing]

163
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:35,918
- Master?

164
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,484
Master, please
accept my apology.

165
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:52,521
I fought hard in your name

166
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:53,246
but I did not know he was ninja.

167
00:13:58,147 --> 00:14:00,667
- Of course, my First Leg.

168
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:01,841
You've always been my favorite.

169
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:20,100
[First Leg screaming]

170
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:28,868
I forgive you.

171
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,354
[gun firing]

172
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:39,879
[sighs] Your manners
are atrocious.

173
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:48,025
Soon we must talk.

174
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,140
[dramatic music]

175
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:06,284
- Maggie.

176
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:06,871
Maggie, wait.

177
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:11,565
I didn't get a chance
to talk to you inside.

178
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:12,532
How are you holding up?

179
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:13,015
Are you okay?

180
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:16,950
- I just saw the man I love
more than anything in the world

181
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,195
lying in a hard wooden box.

182
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:22,852
His skin was cold and they
had his hair parted wrong.

183
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,613
Jack's dead, Orlan!

184
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:26,511
Jack's dead and I'm alone!

185
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,927
- It'll pass, Maggie, trust me.

186
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,721
- How?

187
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,481
How can it, when he's
in every thought I have,

188
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:32,034
every place I see?

189
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,656
- You should savor the memories.

190
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,348
- Memories are all I have left!

191
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,591
And this.

192
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:40,456
This and his stupid motorcycle
parked in my garage!

193
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:41,595
- [Orlan] Maggie.

194
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:42,562
- It's your fault, Orlan.

195
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:43,701
You got him killed.

196
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:44,633
It should've been you in there!

197
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:50,190
- I could be next, Maggie.

198
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:12,799
[ball bouncing]

199
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:16,009
- Yeah!

200
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,059
- Excuse me.

201
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,888
I'm trying to find a
guy named Brother Banjo.

202
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,476
- We're in the middle of a game.

203
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:35,028
- It's really important.

204
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:41,310
- Deciding point.

205
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:47,489
- Look, can you help me or not?

206
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,353
- Will you shut up?

207
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:50,319
- Come on, man, miss it!

208
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,114
Loser buys beer!

209
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:52,839
- This is an emergency.

210
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:02,055
- Where is it?

211
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:03,953
Where is it?

212
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,861
I don't see it anywhere.

213
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,523
It's disappeared.

214
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:26,010
- I win.

215
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:34,260
See you at the bar.

216
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,159
How much money you got?

217
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,333
- What?

218
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:38,850
- How much?

219
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:44,856
- 60, $70.

220
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:45,478
- Come on, give it to me.

221
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:50,172
Come on, you gotta make
it worth my while.

222
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:53,417
This guy's really creepy
with his ravens' feathers

223
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:54,452
and voodoo grease paint.

224
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,740
[dramatic music]

225
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:16,716
- [Orlan] What are you doing?

226
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:17,406
- Shh.

227
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:24,172
He's coming.

228
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:26,243
Close your eyes.

229
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:28,866
Do it.

230
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:34,251
Count to five and then open 'em.

231
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:41,258
- One, two, three, four, five.

232
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:57,101
What's going on here?

233
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:57,584
Where's Brother Banjo?

234
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:00,242
- At your service.

235
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:00,863
- You?

236
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:04,522
- [laughs] What
were you expecting,

237
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:05,765
ravens' feathers and
voodoo grease paint?

238
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,978
[upbeat music]

239
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:15,982
- That's it.

240
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:16,396
That's everything.

241
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,192
Can you help me?

242
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,642
- Sure.

243
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:21,332
All problems solved, remember?

244
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:25,854
Damn.

245
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,753
[snaps]

246
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,796
What you need's a bodyguard.

247
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:38,660
You need someone
who can chew glass

248
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,937
and then smile at you.

249
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:41,456
- Jack was like that.

250
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:42,871
- Perfect.

251
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:44,113
- But I told you he's dead.

252
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:45,943
- Look, look.

253
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:49,360
Nothing gives a guy an edge
like a little death, okay?

254
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,156
So this dude's gonna
be one major badass.

255
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:53,571
- I don't understand
how you can--

256
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:54,986
- Look, are you in it or not?

257
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,022
- Okay.

258
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:56,678
- Great.

259
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,890
Then let's go raise some hell.

260
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,995
[ominous music]

261
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:30,401
Knock knock, hello
there, anybody home?

262
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:33,059
[laughs] Okay, crack it.

263
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:55,633
[laughs] Let's get him out.

264
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:18,829
Watch your, get off.

265
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,209
Move over.

266
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:20,865
Watch your step right there.

267
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:23,178
Here.

268
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:25,870
Right here.

269
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:28,597
Well, he's a good guy, right?

270
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:32,325
So he's gotta be
next to a cross.

271
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:43,440
And he's gotta be facing east.

272
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,854
Don't ask me why.

273
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:47,789
Bad duds.

274
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:50,447
- Well, what now?

275
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:52,241
- You got the ring?

276
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:01,354
Put it on.

277
00:22:02,597 --> 00:22:03,977
Put it on.

278
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:06,221
As long as he wears the ring,

279
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:07,843
whoever possesses that
one controls him.

280
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:10,432
You've got it, so
you're in charge.

281
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,849
Now say the words I taught you

282
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:16,887
and let's get this
show on the road.

283
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,203
No!

284
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:23,859
Come on.

285
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:36,838
[speaking in foreign language]

286
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:47,849
- What'd I do wrong?

287
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:55,788
Damn it, I can't believe
I fell for that!

288
00:22:55,788 --> 00:23:00,240
[speaking in foreign language]

289
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,725
What a crock of horseshit.

290
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:02,691
If Professor Couver--

291
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:04,452
[screams]

292
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,146
I control you.

293
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:10,630
You can't hurt me.

294
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,286
You've gotta do what I say.

295
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,187
Good.

296
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:16,843
Good, good boy, Jack, stay.

297
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:19,328
Stay.

298
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:27,060
Gotta say, you don't look
very threatening in that suit.

299
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:45,838
Now let's get you dressed.

300
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:01,888
Badass.

301
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:06,859
Let's see that again.

302
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,034
Up there.

303
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,488
[dramatic music]

304
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:06,574
Something fancier.

305
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:16,376
[thuds]

306
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:17,032
Oh god.

307
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:20,864
And you're gonna protect
me from Spithrachne's men?

308
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:24,902
[ominous music]

309
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:31,357
Get 'em!

310
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:43,852
[smacking]

311
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,698
- Go get him.

312
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:37,803
- Oh, no.

313
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:39,356
- Go get him.

314
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:41,151
- I'm not gonna get
him, you get him.

315
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:42,842
[screaming]

316
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:46,950
[groans]

317
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:57,305
[grunting]

318
00:26:57,305 --> 00:26:59,203
[smacking]

319
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:33,582
- The Red Spider cult has
asserted your name, master.

320
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:36,378
- Greetings, Mr. Sands.

321
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:41,107
I'm sorry we couldn't
speak sooner

322
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:43,316
but you're a very difficult
man to get ahold of.

323
00:27:43,316 --> 00:27:44,490
- Bastard!

324
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,560
What do you want?

325
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,250
- Stop!

326
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,116
You must remember, Mr.
Sands is our guest.

327
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:54,327
[smacks]

328
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:54,845
Much better.

329
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:01,196
What I want, Mr. Sands, is
something only you can give me.

330
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:05,545
No doubt you've heard of
the Urn of Prometheus?

331
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:06,132
- The urn?

332
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:08,514
But that's what the...

333
00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:10,447
- Yes.

334
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:12,035
That's what your friend
Professor Couver is looking for,

335
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:14,244
isn't it?

336
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:17,488
I know he's on an archeological
expedition seeking the urn.

337
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,629
I also know that once he
finds it and brings it back,

338
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:22,528
it will be under heavy security

339
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:24,047
and virtually
impossible to acquire.

340
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:29,604
So what I'd like to know is

341
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:31,917
where is the excavation
taking place?

342
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:37,301
[ominous music]

343
00:29:06,848 --> 00:29:10,887
Now, Mr. Sands, I hope you
will be more productive

344
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:11,439
than you have been.

345
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:16,271
I really dislike
having to use this.

346
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,895
Well, that's not
altogether true.

347
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:23,831
But it would save you a
great deal of bodily fluids

348
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:26,592
to just cooperate.

349
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:27,731
- Why do you want the urn?

350
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:30,147
It has no real monetary value.

351
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:30,907
What possible use
do you have for it?

352
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,187
- That, Mr. Sands, must
remain my secret for now.

353
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:38,811
I weary of this.

354
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:41,814
You are loyal, Mr. Sands.

355
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:44,058
May I call you Orlan?

356
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:51,065
Well, I suppose Mr.
Sands is more appropriate

357
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:51,928
under the circumstances.

358
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,898
Where's my Second Leg?

359
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:58,624
- He was killed in the
cemetery, master.

360
00:29:58,624 --> 00:29:59,728
By one of the undead.

361
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:01,972
- Really?

362
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:03,698
I applaud your
resourcefulness, Mr. Sands.

363
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:08,358
I sometimes dabble in
the gray arts myself.

364
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:10,153
Tell me, what do you use
to control the zombibi?

365
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,329
Very well, Mr. Sands.

366
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:16,642
I must admit I didn't
really expect you to answer.

367
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,750
This quality of loyalty is
very strong in you, Mr. Sands.

368
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:25,824
I believe, however, I may
have a remedy for that.

00:47:09,378 --> 00:47:10,448
And speaking of which.

552
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:12,105
- [Spithrachne] Oh!

553
00:47:12,105 --> 00:47:12,519
How foolish of me.

554
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,835
I trust that's sufficient?

555
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:23,910
- Sufficient?

556
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,119
Honey, I'm yours,
bought and paid for.

557
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,086
- [Spithrachne] How nice.

558
00:47:28,086 --> 00:47:28,707
- Is this what you want?

559
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:33,851
You're really getting
me hot, baby.

560
00:47:36,577 --> 00:47:37,958
That tattoo is really
turning me on.

561
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:42,860
Take me, Spiderman.

562
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:47,830
[flesh squelching]

563
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,627
[screaming]

564
00:47:59,117 --> 00:48:00,878
[calm music]

565
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,266
- How are you feeling?

566
00:48:10,266 --> 00:48:12,544
- Better.

567
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:15,478
Although I'd give anything
to know what happened.

568
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:17,480
I mean, why was his grave
filled in the next day?

569
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,481
Who could have done it?

570
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:19,241
Why would anybody--

571
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:20,621
- Shh.

572
00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:21,553
Let's not get started again.

573
00:48:22,865 --> 00:48:23,383
- You're right.

574
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:26,869
Would you pass me the jam?

575
00:48:32,357 --> 00:48:32,910
Thank you.

576
00:48:40,469 --> 00:48:40,883
I still love him.

577
00:48:42,747 --> 00:48:43,541
- You've gotta go on, Maggie.

578
00:48:45,577 --> 00:48:45,992
- Do you miss him?

579
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:48,132
- Well, Maggie,

580
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:51,376
sometimes I feel like
he's never left.

581
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:53,861
- [Maggie] I know what you mean.

582
00:48:56,174 --> 00:48:57,382
Sometimes I feel like he's
standing right behind me.

583
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:01,352
- Men's room!

584
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:02,940
- [Maggie] What?

585
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,871
- Uh, I've gotta go
to the men's room.

586
00:49:29,345 --> 00:49:31,554
[water running]

587
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:38,665
[dramatic music]

588
00:49:38,665 --> 00:49:40,874
[Orlan groaning]

589
00:49:48,261 --> 00:49:49,917
Jack!

590
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:50,573
Help me!

591
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,860
[smacking]

592
00:50:23,296 --> 00:50:26,023
And you can tell Spiderpuss

593
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,541
that the next time one
of you goons attacks me,

594
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,233
I'll destroy the urn.

595
00:50:29,233 --> 00:50:30,475
I'm not kidding.

596
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:31,062
Now beat it!

597
00:50:42,246 --> 00:50:43,833
- You're sure you saw him
control the zombibi with this?

598
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,768
And the woman was unaware
of its presence and yours?

599
00:50:51,979 --> 00:50:54,810
Mr. Sands has been
full of surprises

600
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,295
throughout this
little undertaking.

601
00:50:57,295 --> 00:50:58,538
I would be remiss if I
did not return the favor.

602
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:03,025
Can't have him thinking me
to be unimaginative, can we?

603
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,724
Cracker Jack prize.

604
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,658
Doesn't do a thing for me.

605
00:51:20,525 --> 00:51:21,595
Now, this is what we must do.

606
00:51:34,746 --> 00:51:36,058
- [Orlan] Like my new car?

607
00:51:36,058 --> 00:51:39,199
- A lot better
than your old one.

608
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,649
I had a nice time, Orlan, we
should do this more often.

609
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:42,858
- [Orlan] Yeah, it was fun.

610
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:44,687
- I want to apologize
about that day.

611
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,448
I shouldn't have
said those things.

612
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:47,828
- It's okay, I know,
you'll get over it.

613
00:51:47,828 --> 00:51:50,452
- I don't wanna get over it!

614
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:51,315
Look, I know I have
to, it's just...

615
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,905
It's just that sometimes I
feel like he's right behind me,

616
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:56,872
like I could just reach
out and touch him.

617
00:52:00,979 --> 00:52:02,153
- I miss him too, Maggie,
but now, look, he's gone

618
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:02,567
and there's only us.

619
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:06,571
[ominous music]

620
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,368
We've gotta keep going.

621
00:52:10,368 --> 00:52:12,681
He'd want us to.

622
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:14,234
He'd want us to keep
going together.

623
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:16,098
- Orlan, don't!

624
00:52:16,098 --> 00:52:16,650
I still love him.

625
00:52:47,302 --> 00:52:49,511
[engine revving]

626
00:53:26,064 --> 00:53:28,274
[Jack screaming]

627
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:02,273
- [sighs] Oh, it's you.

628
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:03,792
Get over there and
help me, will you?

629
00:54:06,104 --> 00:54:08,831
I can't imagine where
that damn ring's gone to.

630
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:09,867
It's gotta be around
here somewhere.

631
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:15,873
Hey, watch out what
you're doing, will ya?

632
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,360
Hey, spread out, get busy.

633
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,154
You know what you're
supposed to do.

634
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:27,540
It's not in there.

635
00:54:28,955 --> 00:54:30,750
[groans]

636
00:54:36,997 --> 00:54:37,757
The hell do you think you're--

637
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:39,586
[fist smacks]

638
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:15,864
I get the message.

639
00:55:23,872 --> 00:55:27,600
- Fine, my undead
friend, wonderful!

640
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,842
You have performed well.

641
00:55:30,913 --> 00:55:34,089
However, I have no
further need of you,

642
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:36,298
so you may go on to your
just reward now by [sighs],

643
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:43,132
let's see, take a long
walk off a short pier.

644
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:52,763
[water splashing]

645
00:56:03,118 --> 00:56:03,808
Mr. Sands!

646
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:08,710
It's so nice to see you again.

647
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,090
I'm extremely pleased
you could be here

648
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,472
on this very special occasion.

649
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:12,852
- What special occasion?

650
00:56:15,026 --> 00:56:15,682
- It's my birthday!

651
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:18,685
- Birthday?

652
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:20,204
- Yeah, and I'm so
happy you could be here.

653
00:56:20,204 --> 00:56:21,136
After all, you're like
one of the family.

654
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:24,242
- You should've said something.

655
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:26,348
I didn't get you a gift.

656
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:27,832
I'll just run down to K-Mart,
I'll only be gone a second.

657
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:33,493
- The thought is appreciated

658
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:35,840
but you already have my gift.

659
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:39,257
Where is the Urn of Prometheus?

660
00:56:41,225 --> 00:56:43,400
[dramatic music]

661
00:57:11,186 --> 00:57:13,533
You know, you're
the first person

662
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:16,225
I've ever let sit in this chair.

663
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:20,402
An extremely rare
privilege but I don't know,

664
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:20,816
you're kinda special.

665
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:26,581
Oh, don't fret, plenty
more where that came from.

666
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:29,100
In fact, maybe I'll put
one on for every year.

667
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:32,552
It is my birthday.

668
00:57:32,552 --> 00:57:34,209
- [Orlan] How old are you?

669
00:57:34,209 --> 00:57:36,556
[Spithrachne mimics mumbling]

670
00:57:36,556 --> 00:57:38,144
- [laughs] 317.

671
00:57:38,144 --> 00:57:40,284
[Orlan screams]

672
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:46,601
Will you tell me
where the urn is?

673
00:57:53,366 --> 00:57:55,264
[Orlan sighs]

674
00:57:58,198 --> 00:57:59,890
- Untie my hands.

675
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,857
- Where is the urn?

676
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:03,652
- Untie my hands
and I'll tell you.

677
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:05,309
- Tell me and I'll
untie your hands.

678
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:05,827
- No, you won't.

679
00:58:08,623 --> 00:58:11,073
- You're probably right.

680
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:12,627
All right, I'll untie them.

681
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:15,112
But fuck with me,

682
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:28,263
it's lights out.

683
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:36,582
See, you've made me so
upset I said the F word.

684
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:39,826
Untie this.

685
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:46,833
- Hurry up!

686
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:48,939
Please.

687
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:56,498
[groaning]

688
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:08,303
- Now, for the last
time, where is the urn?

689
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:13,480
- I don't have it anymore.

690
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,481
I gave it to someone.

691
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:15,310
- [Spithrachne] Who?

692
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,208
- Jack.

693
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:17,968
- [Spithrachne] The zombibi?

694
00:59:17,968 --> 00:59:18,693
- Zombie, yeah.

695
00:59:22,006 --> 00:59:22,973
- I don't believe you.

696
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:24,906
- [Orlan] It's true.

697
00:59:24,906 --> 00:59:26,597
- You know, it's
really irritating

698
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:27,218
to be thought of as a fool.

699
00:59:29,082 --> 00:59:31,395
You knew I control the zombibi.

700
00:59:31,395 --> 00:59:32,534
Why would you have
given it the urn

701
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:33,777
when it would have
been child's play

702
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:35,641
for me to retrieve it from him?

703
00:59:35,641 --> 00:59:36,642
- Gave it to him before
you got the ring.

704
00:59:39,506 --> 00:59:40,162
- I see.

705
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:43,407
What did he do with it?

706
00:59:45,858 --> 00:59:48,446
- I don't know, I told him
to hide it someplace secret,

707
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:49,137
someplace where I
couldn't see it.

708
00:59:56,938 --> 00:59:58,836
- So only the undead man
knows where it is, huh?

709
01:00:14,093 --> 01:00:16,578
Victory is finally close.

710
01:00:18,511 --> 01:00:19,546
I shall lure the zombibi here,

711
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,653
and it will bring me
the Urn of Prometheus,

712
01:00:24,517 --> 01:00:25,932
and I shall be whole once more!

713
01:00:31,248 --> 01:00:32,283
The knowledge and
powers I possess,

714
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:37,841
humans will fall one
by one under my control

715
01:00:40,498 --> 01:00:42,846
until the entire
race acknowledges me

716
01:00:45,503 --> 01:00:46,815
as its supreme being!

717
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,856
[grunting]

718
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:07,456
[ring clatters]

719
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:13,842
You have just sealed your fate.

720
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:23,162
[ominous music]

721
01:01:41,007 --> 01:01:43,216
[Maggie screams]

722
01:01:45,218 --> 01:01:45,840
- Boo.

723
01:01:48,946 --> 01:01:49,809
- [Orlan] You bastard!

724
01:01:52,053 --> 01:01:54,538
- [Spithrachne] Sticks
and stones, Mr. Sands.

725
01:01:54,538 --> 01:01:55,712
- If I had a stick, I'd
shove it up your ass.

726
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,342
- I'll let you loose
if you'd like to try.

727
01:02:07,482 --> 01:02:08,172
No?

728
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:10,140
Pity.

729
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,354
[nunchucks whooshing]

730
01:02:24,602 --> 01:02:25,811
Sure you won't change your mind?

731
01:02:29,055 --> 01:02:32,576
Now, I will find the ring

732
01:02:32,576 --> 01:02:33,888
and order your dead friend
to bring me the urn.

733
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:41,102
- It won't work.

734
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:41,688
- Why not?

735
01:02:43,518 --> 01:02:45,554
- I commanded him to
bring it only to me.

736
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:46,003
He won't obey your order.

737
01:02:48,316 --> 01:02:49,835
- Then you order him
to bring it here.

738
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:52,147
- No.

739
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:55,081
Forget it.

740
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:58,464
- Shall I have to force you, Mr.
Sands?

741
01:02:58,464 --> 01:03:01,950
- Go ahead, just try.

742
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,711
I can take anything
you could dish out.

743
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:08,508
- [laughs] You're a
walking cliche, Mr. Sands.

744
01:03:09,544 --> 01:03:12,823
And consequently boring as hell.

745
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:13,617
I wasn't referring
to you at all.

746
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:17,863
[bell ringing]

747
01:03:24,317 --> 01:03:24,904
- Maggie!

748
01:03:28,149 --> 01:03:28,839
- Orlan?

749
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,222
- I see you two know each other.

750
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:33,775
Splendid.

751
01:03:33,775 --> 01:03:35,950
Allow me to introduce myself.

752
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:39,194
I'm Spithrachne, leader
of the Red Spider cult.

753
01:03:39,194 --> 01:03:41,196
This fellow who
escorted you here,

754
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:41,783
rather roughly I admit,

755
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:45,994
is the last surviving member
of my team of assassins.

756
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:50,343
And this is a red hot poker.

757
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:53,830
I'm sure we'll all
have a wonderful time.

758
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:12,296
- We're gonna have an absolutely
wonderful time here, Helen.

759
01:04:12,296 --> 01:04:13,780
- Oh, yes.

760
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,853
Lots of sunshine,
lots of nature.

761
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,233
And just smell that
wonderful air.

762
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:24,308
[sighs]

763
01:04:24,308 --> 01:04:26,517
- But I don't know why you had
to bring that thing with you.

764
01:04:26,517 --> 01:04:28,312
- I told you I wanted
to watch the movie.

765
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:30,073
Oh, that reminds me.

766
01:04:30,073 --> 01:04:32,178
[ominous music]

767
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:48,263
- I think they should
make October 21st

768
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:50,162
the day the time changes.

769
01:04:50,162 --> 01:04:51,888
- What are you talking about?

770
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,337
- Well, look, it's eight
o'clock and it's dark already.

771
01:04:55,684 --> 01:04:57,997
- October 21st is the
day the time changes.

772
01:04:57,997 --> 01:04:58,895
Why don't you try taking
your sunglasses off?

773
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:00,966
- Oh.

774
01:05:05,798 --> 01:05:07,869
- You know, we
drive three hours,

775
01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:11,355
three hours to get out here
to stand on someone's grave.

776
01:05:11,355 --> 01:05:13,461
To stand there and
say we remember.

777
01:05:13,461 --> 01:05:15,808
I mean, I don't even remember
what Father looks like.

778
01:05:15,808 --> 01:05:17,741
- We're out here to see Mother.

779
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:18,915
- Mother's alive.

780
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,192
- So is Father.

781
01:05:20,192 --> 01:05:22,090
- Oh.

782
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,091
- Look, why don't we
just get out and do this?

783
01:05:25,438 --> 01:05:27,026
- Do you have any
of that candy left?

784
01:05:27,026 --> 01:05:28,683
- We didn't bring any candy.

785
01:05:28,683 --> 01:05:29,201
- Be that way.

786
01:05:31,237 --> 01:05:32,998
- I'm getting too old
for these kind of shows.

787
01:05:32,998 --> 01:05:34,551
They make me nervous.

788
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:36,242
- Oh, shut up and
hand me a cold one.

789
01:05:46,597 --> 01:05:49,704
[Orlan screaming]

790
01:05:49,704 --> 01:05:50,877
- Stop it!

791
01:05:50,877 --> 01:05:52,120
Stop it, stop it!

792
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,779
- I'd love to, my dear,

793
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:57,229
but he refuses to help
me with my problem.

794
01:06:00,266 --> 01:06:01,888
You don't think I actually enjoy
this sort of thing, do you?

795
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:07,377
[Orlan screams]

796
01:06:07,377 --> 01:06:09,620
[Maggie screams]

797
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,624
Could put an end to
his suffering, my dear,

798
01:06:13,624 --> 01:06:14,971
if only you could
convince him to help me.

799
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,180
- Orlan.

800
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,906
Orlan, whatever it is he
wants you to do, please do it.

801
01:06:19,906 --> 01:06:20,597
- Well?

802
01:06:27,535 --> 01:06:29,571
[laughs] I really
appreciate your stamina.

803
01:06:29,571 --> 01:06:31,366
One rarely finds such a quality.

804
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,475
[Orlan screams]

805
01:06:36,475 --> 01:06:37,683
Where is the urn?

806
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:39,202
I want the urn.

807
01:06:39,202 --> 01:06:40,272
Give me the goddamn urn!

808
01:06:51,352 --> 01:06:53,078
[slow music]

809
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:06,505
- Please.

810
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:08,334
Jack!

811
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:09,715
Somebody please help us!

[water splashing]

813
01:07:17,516 --> 01:07:19,000
- Give it to me.

814
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,794
Now give it to me, you bitch!

815
01:07:19,794 --> 01:07:21,140
- No!

816
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:25,765
Jack!

817
01:07:36,673 --> 01:07:38,433
- Your lover's dead.

818
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:38,951
I killed him.

819
01:07:41,747 --> 01:07:43,197
I'm sorry, but nothing
can save you now.

820
01:07:49,582 --> 01:07:50,204
Put it on.

821
01:07:51,964 --> 01:07:54,000
- No.

822
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,418
- Put it on and order your dead
friend to bring me the urn.

823
01:07:57,418 --> 01:07:59,213
- I don't care if you
hurt me anymore.

824
01:07:59,213 --> 01:07:59,696
I won't do it.

825
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:04,114
- I think it's time to
take a new approach.

826
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:10,258
- [Woman] How you can
watch these things.

827
01:08:10,258 --> 01:08:12,674
- [Woman] I can't
with you talking.

828
01:08:12,674 --> 01:08:14,918
- [Woman] But the whole
concept is ridiculous.

829
01:08:14,918 --> 01:08:16,713
Dead people coming back alive?

830
01:08:16,713 --> 01:08:17,127
- [Woman] Oh, shh.

831
01:08:20,268 --> 01:08:22,512
- [Johnny] This place
is the really scary bit.

832
01:08:22,512 --> 01:08:22,926
- [Bobby] Stop it, Johnny.

833
01:08:25,308 --> 01:08:26,654
- [Johnny] You're still
scared, aren't you?

834
01:08:26,654 --> 01:08:27,137
- [Bobby] You're so ignorant.

835
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:31,176
- [Johnny] They're
coming to get you, Bobby.

836
01:08:31,176 --> 01:08:33,247
They're coming to get you.

837
01:08:33,247 --> 01:08:36,595
Look, there's one of
'em this very minute.

838
01:08:36,595 --> 01:08:39,115
- [Bobby] You're being childish.

839
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,083
- [Johnny] He's dark, grizzly,
just like a Republican.

840
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:43,049
I'm getting out of here.

841
01:08:43,049 --> 01:08:44,913
- [Bobby] Johnny!

842
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:48,124
- [Narrator] We'll return
to Night of the Raging Dead

843
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,333
after these messages.

- [Spithrachne] Last chance.

847

- Do your worst.

848
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:26,852
- I intend to.

[motorcycle rumbling]

850
01:09:55,639 --> 01:09:56,295
- Wait.

851
01:09:57,434 --> 01:09:57,917
Wait a minute.

852
01:10:00,886 --> 01:10:01,507
Okay.

853
01:10:02,922 --> 01:10:04,855
You win.

854
01:10:04,855 --> 01:10:05,477
I'll do whatever you want.

855
01:10:06,754 --> 01:10:07,272
- Too late!

856
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:11,690
It's playtime.

857
01:10:19,249 --> 01:10:20,595
- Stop.

858
01:10:20,595 --> 01:10:22,459
You son of a bitch.

859
01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:22,839
Don't you touch her!

860
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:29,570
- I hope you fry in hell.

861
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:30,847

[dramatic music]

865
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:02,844

[squelching]

872
01:11:49,374 --> 01:11:51,548
Worthless pottery.

873
01:11:51,548 --> 01:11:53,516
But fill it with water
and drink from it

874
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:56,104
and dead flesh renews.

875
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:56,657
Pick up that gun.

876
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:02,214
This is a wonderful
moment for me.

877
01:12:02,214 --> 01:12:05,597
The urn, its power, and a slave

878

who will obey my every command.

Time to sever the
ties that bind.

880

Don't you recognize me?

Shoot her.

Do as I say, shoot her!

I control you.
