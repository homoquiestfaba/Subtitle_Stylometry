00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,812
The time is 1636
right after the Manchu war

5
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,011
China's Army was stationed
in Korea and started to interfere

6
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,419
In Korea's affairs, which made
the people's lives miserable

7
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,616
At this time of disorder, there were
fools living by their own rules

8
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,021
Blood would be all over
everywhere they went

9
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,924
Shame less fools doing anything
for money...

10
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,826
There is no way to find out the truth
about these people

11
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,727
But, people call them
the 'Romantic Warriors'

12
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,235
I took a pity on the poor little thing
<i>Kim Min-jong</i>

13
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,275
and made her my concubine
<i>Choi Sung-guk / Jin Jae-yeong</i>

14
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,278
That ungrateful whore ran away

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,746
with another man

16
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,712
I want them captured a live
at all costs

I don't

178
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:31,468
That's not what I mean you moron

179
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,244
What are you doing

180
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,945

186
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,855
Beware of ghosts SOBs

187
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,457
They're so full of
grievances

188
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,560
If you aren't careful
they'll eat you alive

189
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,161
I don't think
this is the way?

190
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,673
You morons get lost on the paths
you trave I every day?

191
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,175
That's why
ninjas eat you for lunch

192
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,473
Even the cook looks down
on me now

193
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,138
What the hell
are you looking at?

194
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,841
This is not the way

195
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,546
Let's go

196
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,950
Are you two going out?

197
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:54,549
Why don't you guys
try to make out here then

198
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,649
What are you looking at?

199
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,753
Lose the attitude
you SOB's

200
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,756
Damn those wolves

201
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,062
Yo-yee

202
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,765
do you know
why I rarely draw my sword?

203
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,569
I don't want to know
you moron

204
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,072
It was exactly
10 years ago

205
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,841
Soldiers revolted in the royal court

206
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,144
Princess Jeong-rin and I
who were to get married

207
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,151
We're now on the run

208
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:27,157
I was a top warrior
and her bodyguard

209
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,751
We ran away as far as
Ji-ri San

210
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:35,162
But I had to face
the 17 best assassins of the nation

211
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,861
in one last stand-off

212
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,957
Damn it...

213
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,272
Princess Rin

214
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,972
I decided then...

215
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,348
I understood
what her last words were

216
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,549
I 'll never draw
my sword in vain again

217
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,957
Rin!

218
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,256
Big Brother!

219
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,860
Yo-yee, Yo-yee!

220
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,763
Don't cry on me

221
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,460
Yo-yee!

222
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,765
Brother!

223
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,568
Dumb and dumber
putting on a show

224
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,871
Can't believe
I'm their hostage

225
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,548
Let it go
you bastards

226
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,244
One more to go
and not even

227
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,548
a cock roach
is in sight

228
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,254
Who peed here?

229
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,155
Not me

230
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,454
Look at the color

231
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,754
Oh, finally, Our meal is here
Looks juicy

232
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,356
Oh my!

233
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,964
Look at my enchanting body

234
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,568
I didn't know

235
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,869
- Look at my body
- Who's gonna rub my back?

236
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,272
Someone might want me as
their concubine

237
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,346
Look at my enchanting body~

238
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,368
What is that funny thing
on your head?

239
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,270
What's underneath?

240
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,868
Take it out

241
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,543
Darn it!

242
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,948
Told you to take it out
you wimp

243
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,452
It' s really nothing...

244
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:22,152
This guy is retarded

245
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,354
That panty hasn't been washed
for long time

246
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,455
Enjoy the aroma?

247
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,966
Give it back

248
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,339
Get it now?

249
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,445
That was great

250
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,944
A job well done, girls

251
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,650
No
we gotta thank you

252
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,055
Well said

253
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,752
Glad that you know

254
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,558
So we're going to
Heaven tomorrow?

255
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,462
Heaven, baby!

256
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,061
Where's the tear gourd?

257
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,764
Gave it to you yesterday

258
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,363
It's on top of the altar

259
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,470
Are you out of your mind?
You wenches

260
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,651
Something always goes wrong
at the end

261
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,149
What's that?

262
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,848
Looks like liquor

263
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,256
Liquor?

264
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,455
Watch out what you touch

265
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,256
you idiots

266
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,169
Can't help it
These retards don't grow on me

267
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,667
Give me a sip

268
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,372
You pilfering thieves with no morals

269
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,540
This liquor tastes drab

270
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,250
You sons of bitches!

271
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,356
Stop right there

272
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,154
you dirty bastards!

273
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,560
Oh my rotten luck

274
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,065
You scoundre Is!

275
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,245
Done with running
you wimps?

276
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,843
What's going on?

277
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,145
You lowly ghost!

278
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,158
Do you know
who I am?

279
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,060
Do you have any idea

280
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,655
what you just drank?

281
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,868
No
we couldn't possibly...

282
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,371
Who told you to talk
back to me?

283
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,499
What shall
I do with you?

284
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,978
What did I tell you
You idiots?

285
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,945
Told you
not to touch it

286
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,539
What are you
looking at?

287
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,141
I didn't touch
a single drop

288
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,249
Get rid of him first

289
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:08,350
Hold it

290
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,955
Could you...

291
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,261
hold it for few days?

292
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,963
I have the rest to collect...

293
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,370
Playing games with me?

294
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,466
On second thought, go on

295
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,562
Stop this nonsense!

296
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:57,173
Talk about your loud
and filthy mouth

297
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,267
Who are you calling
bitch

298
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:03,074
Do I look like a chopped
liver to you?

299
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:07,242
Tell me about it
Are you going to hit me now?

300
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,150
I'm a ghost
not a human

301
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,951
Oh well...
you're right

302
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,856
Knew you would
you retard

303
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,360
Stupid bitch

304
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:23,967
You've been around the block
haven't you?

305
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,264
I had some fun

306
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,568
because I could, you barf face

307
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:33,166
Yeah, I could've been
a surrogate mother

308
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:33,676
Let it go, you hag

309
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,871
- Would you if you were me?
- This bitch is insane

310
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,140
How dare she

311
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,046
Hit her before she gets to you

312
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:44,053
Swipe her legs

313
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,952
Pull out her hair

314
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,765
Let go, you wench

315
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,842
Who's laughing now?

316
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:18,452
Told you to watch it

317
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,150
Today is your lucky day
shorty

318
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,353
She must' ve been
a school bully

319
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,759
girls!

320
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,159
Those worthless scums

321
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,260
Drank what we gathered
for the last 3 years

322
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,771
in one fell swoop

323
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,970
No freaking way for us

324
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,773
to ascend to heaven now

325
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,941
What's gotten into everyone?

326
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,252
Listen to me, kiddo

327
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:54,257
You take care of this guy
and we ascend to the Paradise

328
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,951
If you don't

329
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,562
that gorilla over there

330
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,964
He's gonna get it

331
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,969
Got it?

332
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,668
To-ryong!

333
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:15,374
Sa-ryong!
Can't you read?

334
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,347
To-ryong means worm
you fools

335
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:22,044
Might as well move
and start over

336
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,246
Found a clean house nearby
with a good price

337
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,153
You don't know between
earthworm and snake

338
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,152
Did you even
go to kindergarten?

339
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,956
And you call yourself
an assassin?

340
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:40,065
Everyone is driving me nuts

341
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,765

Will do!

353
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,037

00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,344
Sa-ryong?

355
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:33,940
He's a regular
and in a VIP room

356
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,747
What shall I tell him?

357
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:36,842
Never mind

358
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,365
Cheers!

359
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,561
Irregular payments

00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,368

positions either

365
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,056
Big Brother

00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,757
Handsome hunks waiting to

00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,467
Get lost, you scums!

372
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,942
Ouch, ouch!

373
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,352
Watch it, you scum!

374
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,271
Abracadabra

375
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,244
Abracadabra

376
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,918
Oh, yes

377
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,748
Oh, my God. Oh...
Oh... Oh...

378
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:09,815
Ouch, it hurts

379
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:14,928
Yo-yee

380
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,431
Yo-yee!

381
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:33,811
Hey!

382
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,612
Yo-yee!

383
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,513
Yo-yee!

384
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,427
Big Brother, run!

385
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,415
Ado Ado

386
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:16,925
Hori Hori!

387
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,942
Ommami Bemi Ommami Bemi...

388
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,411
Ommami Bemi Ommami Bemi...

389
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,524
It doesn't work

390
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,823
Run for you life
moron!

391
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,815
You call this swordsmanship?

392
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:03,120
Got some zits in your balls?

393
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,526
Want me to scratch them for you?

394
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,530
Stupid fools...

395
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,123
We sent a bunch of posers
and pretenders to avenge us

396
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,534
- They can't do anything right
- You call yourself a man?

397
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,936
We've sent them to
avenge us...

398
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,238
- But they can't do nothing
- I should've known

399
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,642
- But where's the ball?
- They were imbeciles

400
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,008
- Should have known...
- If they got that SOB

401
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,308
we would have ascended
to the heavens

402
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,111
- Idiots
- Tell me about it...

403
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,310
- What the hell were they doing?
- You guys are

404
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,114
- Animals! Animals
- They probably did this all day

405
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,620
Look at us now...

406
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,322
- What are we going to do?
- I'm going to move

407
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,622
Those idiots were
our last hope

408
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:43,832
This is all you do
after running away?

409
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,034
I'm disappointed

410
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,534
How about Dal-rae?

411
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:55,839
No parents now
and she has only you

412
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,615
Why don't we teach...

413
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,312
the Supernatural Swordsmanship
to them?

414
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,616
Not much time you know
Those Chinese bastards are

415
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:10,158
about to return to
their country too

416
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,525
These fools don't

417
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,927
even know the basics

418
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,224
Instructors to the front!

419
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,845
Fall in!

420
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,719
Go get her!

421
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,243
Get down!

422
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,077
What are you doing?
Go get her!

423
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,563
Oh my head

424
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,066
Lunge!

425
00:45:58,956 --> 00:45:59,752
Okay...

426
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,154
Can't hear you
Hey, guys!

427
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,453
Are you gonna do it
right or not?

428
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,069
Slice in the air!

429
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,245
Okay!

430
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,647
Not bad!

431
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,049
Ya!

432
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:35,251
Do you know why
I rarely draw my sword?

433
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,452
Aga in?
I know! Don't tell me

434
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,955
It was exactly
10 years ago
