1
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:44,408
Come on! I'm not a 3-year-old!

2
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,454
No, I got it.

3
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:34,284
What do you think, Tate?

4
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,330
"Amityville Horror."

5
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:39,333
Okay. All right.

6
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:40,899
Look, I know it's an old shit
box,

7
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:43,641
but your mama really likes it,

8
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,644
and we're doing what makes
her happy right now. Okay?

9
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:50,387
- Where am I sleeping anyway?
- Upstairs.

10
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,956
Want to go check it out?
You get first pick.

11
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,958
You can choose any room you
want.

12
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,489
This pizza's so good.

13
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:10,494
You going to be okay back
there all by yourself?

14
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:13,802
Okay. I'm sorry.

15
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,456
I thought you just might be
a little scared

16
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,892
not being across the hall from
us anymore.

17
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:21,549
- I'm 10.
- I know.

18
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:45,877
Mom. Dad.

19
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,488
Yeah, buddy?

20
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:50,491
Can you tuck me
in just for tonight?

21
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,713
I got ya.

22
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,022
All right. Giddyap.

23
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:04,592
- Thanks, Dad.
- Any time.

24
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,029
Da-dump, da-dump, da-dump,
da-dump.

25
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,900
You're hitting yourself.
Why are you hitting yourself?

26
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:09,945
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why you hitting yourself?

27
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:10,641
Time to go to sleep. Handshake.

28
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:11,686
Aw...

29
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,687
- Come on.
- Okay.

30
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,645
You got a rocket ship.

31
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,039
- Yeah!
- There you go. Oh, you beat me.

32
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:19,302
All right. Love you, bud.

33
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,870
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night. Sleep tight.

34
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,960
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

35
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,056
Oh, yes!

36
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,104
Oh! Come on. Come on. Come on.

37
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:42,107
I'm so close. Just get it.

38
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:46,677
I've been trying to finish
this game for 5 years.

39
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:51,203
Make yourself useful, Tate. Dump
by the back steps please.

40
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:49,218
Late night, huh?

41
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,052
Tate!

42
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:01,012
A government spokesman
has stated that there is not...

43
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,493
Isn't there some sort
of day camp or--

44
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,495
- No.
- YMCA?

45
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:06,844
We missed the sign- up
deadlines.

46
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,280
You have to take him with you.

47
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,760
Frannie, you're not
listening to me.

48
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,066
I cannot take him to work with
me, okay?

49
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,676
He has to go to work with you.

50
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,374
Why didn't you figure out this
before now?

51
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:15,897
Why didn't you?

52
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,465
Hey, I can just go to
Brandon's.

53
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,945
Oh. No, baby. They're on
vacation in the Ozarks.

54
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,556
Why can't he go to the office?

55
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,122
For Christ's sake, Frannie,
he'll be less

56
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,821
visible and intrusive
at your job than mine.

57
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,605
She just gave me a week off
for the move.

58
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,520
I can't just show up with him.

59
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:32,043
Hey, I'll just stay here by
myself.

60
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,958
- No!
- No!

61
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,526
I'm responsible.

62
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,052
Fine. Tate, you'll come
to Bliss with me.

63
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,881
Can't let your father
give the illusion at the office

64
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,754
he's a family man.

65
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:50,279
- Get your backpack.
- Okay.

66
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,922
- Perfect. Oh--
- Wait.

67
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,402
There's something missing.

68
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:32,669
Ohh!

69
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,367
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.

70
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:39,241
Oh, Mommy.

71
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:42,200
I'll give you ladies a minute.

72
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:48,946
Thank you so much, ladies,

73
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,948
and please let me know
if there's anything you need,

74
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:54,082
even up to the minute
you're walking down the aisle.

75
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:55,300
This is my home number.

76
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,694
- Oh, good.
- Aw, Frannie.

77
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,262
- This is great.
- I am simply elated.

78
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,569
- I can't thank you enough.
- We're just so happy.

79
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,135
Thank you so much. I just--

80
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:07,095
- I'm elated for you.
- Thanks.

81
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:10,751
- You're so welcome.
- "Elated, verb.

82
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,928
To elevate the spirits up,

83
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:19,107
excited, exhilarated, inspired.

84
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:23,154
Antonym, depressed."

85
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:25,896
Mom, can we go now?

86
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:28,769
You're not wearing your grubby
sneakers in there, are you?

87
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:31,554
No. Now, for the
hundredth time, can we go?

88
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,296
Oh, you little turd. You had
your shoes on in there again!

89
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,299
Oh! My socks are dirtier!

90
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,650
- All finished?
- Oh, yes, Phyllis.

91
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:44,088
It went very well.
- Sales?

92
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:46,177
Just over 2,800.

93
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:50,312
Oh, that's good.
They were happy then.

94
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,576
Oh, they were just elated.

95
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,623
Very satisfied.

96
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:59,060
So how's the new house?

97
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:01,105
It's depressing.

98
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,846
We love it.

99
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,544
And thank you again
for giving me last week off

100
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,763
so I could get us settled.

101
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,591
Well, see you in the morning,
Phyllis.

102
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,854
- Both of you?
- Don't worry.

103
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,769
He'll be with his dad tomorrow.

104
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,816
- Good.
- Good night.

105
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,391
Shit!

106
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,712
Why are people waving at us?

107
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,366
We live in a small town
now, Tater.

108
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,803
That's what people do
in small towns. They wave.

109
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,849
It's called hospitality. It
means--

110
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:52,940
Don't! I want to look it up.

111
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:56,639
Give it time, baby.
It's only been a week.

112
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,989
These small town kids are super
friendly.

113
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,730
You're going to be grateful
for that hospitality

114
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:03,037
when you start
your new school in the fall.

115
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:07,215
Yeah, it's right
above hospitalized.

00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,960

Frances, did you know about
this?

128
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:12,019
The real estate agent
said the house was owned

129
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,411
by a retired English professor.

130
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:18,808
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

131
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:22,594
- Tate, kitchen now, baby.
- But why?

132
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,426
- Watch TV.
- Oh.

133
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,825
That's wonderful, Frances.

134
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,133
You found us a house next
to another John Wayne Gacy.

135
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:40,830
Gacy was a clown,
not a tranny.

136
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:42,310
Well, I bet this one
has got little kids' bodies

137
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:43,877
buried in the crawlspace over
there!

138
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,792
You stop it!
You're going to scare Tate.

139
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,489
Well, Jesus, I'm scared.

140
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:50,100
Don't unpack anymore.
We're not living here.

141
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:55,105
Because of a neighbor?
We're not moving again.

142
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,107
Hey, we can move back
to the city.

143
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,413
That's always an option.

144
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,502
- No.
- Oh.

145
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:11,034
Look. You know, I packed up.

146
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:16,170
I left the city no questions
asked, for you, Fran.

147
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:21,044
Now, if we are going to
give this another shot,

148
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:22,959
then I cannot be worried
about Tate's safety

149
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,135
or what he's being exposed to.

150
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:28,573
Billy, I'm exhausted,

151
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,533
and I can't take off
any more time from work.

152
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:38,061
I know. You don't have to lift
a finger, okay?

153
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,150
No, no. No, no. I will rehire
the movers.

154
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:43,110
I will repack what has been
unpacked,

155
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:48,158
and I'll find us another house.
Okay?

156
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:53,250
I'm serious. A great house
with great neighbors.

157
00:12:55,557 --> 00:13:00,605
- Out of the city?
- Yeah, out of the city.

158
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:04,914
And while I'm doing that,
all you have to do is

159
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:08,091
just keep Tate away
from that deviant across the
driveway.

160
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:10,050
All right?

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,255
You should come.

176
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:30,347
No, um...maybe next time.
Is she awake yet?

177
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,524
She's in and out of
consciousness.

178
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:36,484
But she's never going to be
the same after what those guys
did to her.

179
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,486
It was more than one of them?

180
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,142
Cops said a witness
saw three or four guys jump her.

181
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,189
That's crazy, but you know
what?

182
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,583
It ain't like cops
are going to do shit about it

183
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:51,151
or her parents for that matter.

184
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:55,329
That is why we have to get out
of the heartland, Gossamer.

185
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:57,374
It's got no heart for us.

186
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:00,638
The heartland?
Girl, you are crazy.

187
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,031
That was very clever.

188
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:06,383
- Hello, Edward.
- Hi, Diana.

189
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,430
- Can I help you, Daddy?

190
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:12,389
- George, Aunt Rita called
and left another message

191
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:15,566
regarding your cousin Brenda's
prom dress.

192
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,221
- Okay, Daddy.
I'm working right now.

193
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,702
- It's her fourth call.
- I'll call her as soon

194
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:23,009
as I finish with this,
Daddy. Okay? Thank you.

195
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:27,013
But what time?

196
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,710
Really, Daddy?

197
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:30,407
Must you come and do this?
Come and interrupt me

198
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,019
and disrespect me
in front of one of my clients.

199
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:35,412
Look, when the beads are down,
I'm unavailable. You know this.

200
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:39,982
I might not be writing some
book or teaching some lecture,
but I'm working.

201
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,810
I'm aware of that.

202
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,421
Well, just have Aunt Riri
bring Brenda by tomorrow, okay?

203
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:48,599
- But what time?
- Two, Daddy. Okay? Two o'clock.

204
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:50,210
All right then.

205
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,519
Whew.

206
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,521
Intense.

207
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:01,221
- George.
- It's not funny.

208
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:03,005
You could be my leading man.

209
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,746
- It's really not funny.
- Come on, George. Let's dance.

210
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,141
- It's not funny. Move.
- I think it suits you.

211
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:11,144
Yeah? You can step out now.

212
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:18,689
"Tranquilize, tranquil,
tranquility."

213
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:45,194
- Hello there, young fellow.
- Hi.

214
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:48,589
- Is your mommy or daddy home?
- My mom's in there.

215
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:52,984
- Do you like tuna casserole?
- No, it's heinous.

216
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:56,988
All right then.

217
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:51,217
There's no one to play
with here.

218
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,393
I hate this place. It's so
boring.

219
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,699
You know what's boring?

220
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:58,441
Working all day for naggy
Phyllis and then listening to
you whine at me,

221
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:01,444
and now I have to let out all
the seams on this bridesmaid
dress

222
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,794
because she forgot to mention
two months ago that she's
pregnant.

223
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:05,709
Well, I'm starving.

224
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,582
Microwave some of that
lady's casserole.

225
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:10,584
I'd rather die of starvation.

226
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,605
Why did we move here? Ugh!

227
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:35,261
God. So ignorant.

228
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,536
Good afternoon.

229
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:54,454
Hey.

230
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:57,500
Hey. I said what's up, little
man?

231
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:57,038
Hey, that's mine!

232
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,649
Get off, lady! That's mine!

233
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:01,825
You're too big. You'll break it.

234
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,350
Relax, baby.
I'm just borrowing it.

235
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,308
That's theft, not borrowing!

236
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,310
Um, you weren't riding it.

237
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,878
I was about to, and besides,
it doesn't matter.

238
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:13,576
- It's my property.
- I'm sorry.

239
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,493
By all means, ride your little
stupid skateboard.

240
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,713
And I will.

241
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:26,720
What? I didn't bust it.
Go on. Hop on.

242
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:29,723
I'll ride it when I
feel like it!

243
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:32,726
And stop staring at me.

244
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,424
Ain't that the little teapot
calling the kettle black.

245
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,383
You've been staring at me
for the past few days like

246
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,776
I was something stuck
on the bottom of your shoe.

247
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,866
Ha! That's ludicrous.
Why would I stare at you?

248
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,826
- Because I'm divine.
- No, you're a deviant.

249
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,697
Oh, really?
And what's a deviant?

250
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:51,745
One that deviates from
accepted norm, noun.

251
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,443
- How old are you?
- How old are you?

252
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:56,750
I'm 25 years old.
Now how old are you?

253
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:58,404
10.

254
00:21:58,578 --> 00:21:59,796
Kind of puny for 10,
ain't you?

255
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,755
Well, you're enormous.

256
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,670
I'm tremendous.
What's your name?

257
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:07,021
- What's your name?
- Little boy, what's your name?

258
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:09,806
- Tate.
- Tate?

259
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,548
Like Darrin's boss on
"Bewitched"?

260
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:15,464
- What?
- Never mind.

261
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:18,989
- Now, what's your name?
- Gossamer.

262
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:21,427
You know what that means?

263
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:24,778
- Yeah.
- What's it mean?

264
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:29,652
- Hold on.
- Gossamer is the--

265
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,132
- Don't tell me!
- Why not?

266
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,612
You clearly don't know what it
means.

267
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,657
- I want to look it up.
- What?

268
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:37,878
In my dictionary. I don't like
people to tell me stuff

269
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:40,837
'cause I like to find out for
myself.

270
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:43,144
Ha. Okay.

271
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,410
"The heaven was spangled
with tremulous stars,

272
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:52,806
and at the horizon, the clouds
hung down in gossamer folds."

273
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,808
You know, I'm trying
to concentrate here.

274
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:57,506
Okay. What's it say?

275
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,728
G, G, G, Gossamer. Okay.
Gossamer, noun.

276
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:04,644
Hmm. I'm a noun.

277
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:07,995
"An extremely light variety of
gowz--"

278
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,563
Gauze.

279
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:13,740
"Gauze used especially for
veils,

280
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:18,005
any thin light fabric, something
extremely light or delicate."

281
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,704
- Hmm. Yeah. That's me.
- Hardly.

282
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:25,752
- Look up Tate.
- I've tried. There's no entry.

283
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,538
Then how do you know you
exist?

284
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:36,415
Tate! Come inside!

285
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,634
I'm avoiding you!

286
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,984
Now, please.
Your dad's on the phone.

287
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:46,686
- Your mama is real pretty.
- She's exasperating.

288
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:51,604
- So how long was he over there?
- I don't know.

289
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,519
However long we were
on the phone, maybe 10 minutes.

290
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:55,042
Jesus Christ.

291
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,739
Frannie, he cannot be over
there, period,

292
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,567
and unsupervised?

293
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:00,221
I mean, who knows
what could have happened.

294
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,832
He's 10. I can't watch him
every second.

295
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:04,355
He could have been taken
inside.

296
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,054
He could have been molested,
for God's sake.

297
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:09,578
Jesus, then be here.

298
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:11,711
You're already sneaking off
every chance you get.

299
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,975
Hey, buddy.

300
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:19,153
- Am I in trouble?
- No, baby. Not at all.

301
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:23,984
Why don't you like
the girl next door?

302
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:25,899
What girl?

303
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:28,728
- Billy.
- Her name is Gossamer.

304
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:31,644
- She lives there with her dad,
Edward.
- You know what?

305
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,559
We just don't want you talking
to people we don't know.

306
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:36,562
Just give your dad and I a
chance to meet them before you--

307
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:38,346
Do not go over there again.

308
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,266
Baby, it's going to be okay.
Here.

309
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,008
Come help me set the table. Come
on.

310
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:10,770
How come you got two of those?

311
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:13,773
Because I'm sending copies
of the best design

312
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:17,124
in my portfolio to the Pyramid
Club.

313
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:19,561
Pyramid drag shows are the gold
standard

314
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:22,869
of all the balls
and ballrooms in New York City.

315
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:25,611
I don't know why anyone
would ever want to live

316
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,569
in such a big city.

317
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,049
You'd never know your neighbors.

318
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:30,920
There's no trees to speak of,

319
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:34,054
and people are always getting
run over by them subways.

320
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:38,145
Name me one person you heard

321
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,843
of that's got run over by a
subway, Jimbo.

322
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:44,107
I'm with Jimbo.
It's safer here, George.

323
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,980
Dammit, Daddy! Ain't nothing
happening to queers in New York

324
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:49,896
that ain't happening
in Kansas City, so please.

325
00:25:57,904 --> 00:26:00,950
You met them new neighbors yet?

326
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:02,691
Yeah.

327
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:03,866
Thought I'd have to chase them
down and tackle them

328
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,999
just to get them to say hello.

329
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:10,612
He's a feisty little shit. I
like that.

330
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:13,310
Your mother would have
appreciated his spunk.

331
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:19,969
Yeah. Mama always had
a soft spot for misfits.

332
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:23,756
Like me. I still have
that blazer she sewed me

333
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,889
for my daddy's funeral.
I wear it to church.

334
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:29,892
It might be time for me
to update your wardrobe, Jimbo.

335
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:33,679
I mean, seriously, wide lapels
went out with feathered bangs.

336
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,912
- Where's Mom?
- Oh, I don't know.

337
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:52,001
Crazy Phyllis has her running
all over the city today,

338
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,308
so today, it's just us men.

339
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:55,701
Just us men.

340
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,355
That's right, buddy.
All right.

341
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,227
You really need to get
a new car.

342
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:02,142
- Ha. Thanks.

343
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:07,147
Hey. Do you want
to practice pop-ups?

344
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:10,629
Yeah, we can.
I'll just go grab my glove.

345
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:12,326
Here's your glove.

346
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,242
Hey, you know, I got to make
a phone call real quick,

347
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,897
so I will be back in a second.
All right, buddy?

348
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,202
Wait. So then you'll throw
for me?

349
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,987
Yes, sir.

350
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:25,295
I'll just be 5 minutes,
so stay out here in the yard.

351
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:28,603
Tate, in our yard!

352
00:27:29,952 --> 00:27:32,215
- Okay.
- Good man.

353
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:46,926
Hey! I hear the Royals
are looking for a new pitcher.

354
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,276
What was that?

355
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,844
You been recruited by the
Royals?

356
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:54,977
- No, the Cubs.
- Eh.

357
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:58,285
The Cubs suck this year.
You might have a shot.

358
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,987
- So...
- You need a haircut, boy.

359
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:06,815
My dad's going to give me
a summer cut.

360
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:08,251
What's that?

361
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,384
He buzzes it with the clippers
every summer.

362
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,735
His dad used to do it to him
when he was a kid.

363
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:16,999
- Mm. That's the Welfare Cut.
- What's that?

364
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:20,002
It's the cut all the kids
on welfare get.

365
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,484
Okay.

366
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:28,402
- What? You looking up welfare?
- Yep.

367
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,578
Mm-kay. So what's it say?

368
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:36,845
"Noun, well-being, happiness,
wealth and prosperity."

369
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,109
Nah, that's the wrong
definition, baby.

370
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:42,242
Okay.

371
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:46,463
"Financial support given by
a government to the unemployed,

372
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:49,205
- disadvantaged."
- Bingo.

373
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:52,513
- Poor people.
- Wait, so you're telling me

374
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:55,124
that poor people have summer
cuts?

375
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:58,345
Food stamps don't work
in salons, Tate.

376
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:01,174
Believe it or not,
I went to beauty school.

377
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:03,176
- I believe you.
- Yeah?

378
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,135
And I bet I could
finesse you the most chic

379
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,921
and stylish haircut
third grade has ever seen.

380
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:11,184
I'm actually going into
fourth.

381
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:14,056
Think David Bowie, baby. Mm!

382
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,058
Okay.

Tate. What are you doing?

392
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,920
Where's your dad?

393
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,184
- On the phone.
- Tate, this your mama?

394
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:57,926
Oh, hello.
I'm sorry for the bother.

395
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,582
Oh, not a bother.
I'm Gossamer, Gossamer Bryant.

396
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:05,934
- Hi, I'm Frannie, Tate's mom.
- Nice to meet you.

397
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:10,460
I love that skirt.
I'm a sucker for patch pockets.

398
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:14,551
- Thank you. I made it.
- Perfectly symmetrical.

399
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,423
I'm a seamstress myself.

400
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:18,425
You should come in
and see some of my stuff.

401
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:22,342
- Boring.
- We really have to go.

402
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:26,955
Hey, neighbor.
We meet at last.

403
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:29,044
Edward Bryant.

404
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:30,959
Pleasure to meet you, Mrs...

405
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:34,876
- Frannie. Frannie Milliken.
- Glad to have you next door.

406
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,617
I understand you've come to us
from the city.

407
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,446
Yes. We really have to go.

408
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,188
Oh. Would you care to take
some sweet corn?

409
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:43,363
We have plenty.

410
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,017
No, thank you.

411
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:48,063
Later, Tater.

412
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:49,543
Bye!

413
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:53,634
I think she was intimidated
by you, old man.

414
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:56,593
Don't worry. I've won
over tougher folks than them.

415
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:10,520
You and I need to have
a conversation.

416
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:13,262
Ain't got time now,
eavesdropper.

417
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,656
Hey, get your Goddamn hands off
of me!

418
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:18,833
I'm your father, boy.

419
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:25,144
You will start treating me
with a greater level of respect!

420
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:53,215
Mhm. I know.

421
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:56,523
You are in hot water,
young man, boiling, scalding!

422
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:59,308
Do you know where he was?

423
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:02,268
- What? Where?
- Next door on the porch.

424
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:06,446
Tate, go upstairs! Go!

425
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,144
When I came inside, that faggot
was nowhere in sight.

426
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:10,493
All right?

427
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:18,675
- Who were you talking to?
- Work.

428
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:22,984
We can't watch the kids every
second of the day, now, can we?

429
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:26,640
- And I can't trust you 24/7.
- Jesus Christ. You're paranoid.

430
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,207
And you're deceitful!

431
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:29,904
Are we going to keep exchanging
insults,

432
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:31,558
or are you actually going to
cut off contact with her

433
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,081
like you said you would?

434
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,086
I did cut contact! We can't
keep talking about this, okay?

435
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,045
- This is exactly why...
- Don't blame me!

436
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:01,283
Well, look who's back.

437
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:05,244
I was wondering if your offer
was still available.

438
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:07,420
- What offer was that?
- I'm hungry,

439
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:10,597
and I'd like to have
some of your corn, please.

440
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:15,428
Lucky for you,
I have half a dozen heads

441
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:17,734
already in a pot on the stove.

442
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:22,783
You could just continue
shucking these remaining ears.

443
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:26,526
- I don't know how to shuck.
- Well, sit down, and I'll show
you.

444
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:32,184
Grab it here at the top of
the ear.

445
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:35,274
And pull down on the husk.

446
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,625
There you go.

447
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,716
Yes. That's what shucking is.
There you go.

448
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,632
You got it.

449
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:48,156
Yeah. Wring it a little bit at
the bottom.

450
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,245
You got it. Now put it right
there.

451
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:55,598
So good.

452
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:04,172
- What style?
- Salty style.

453
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:10,004
And then you do it over and
over again.

454
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:20,623
I'm getting full already.

455
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,364
- Are you?
- Yeah.

456
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:24,845
- This was so good.
- Oh, my God. It was the best.

457
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:27,326
It's a pleasure, a pleasure.

458
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,892
This is ridiculous!

459
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:47,607
Did your wife leave you?

460
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,784
No, Tate.
I'm a widower.

461
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,656
Do you know what that is?

462
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,488
How did she die?

463
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:04,058
Cancer, nearly 7 years ago.

464
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,717
- Everyone dies of cancer.
- Well, it seems that way
sometimes,

465
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:14,199
doesn't it?

466
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:01,610
He'll stay out of the way.
I had no other option.

467
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:03,656
Frannie, we have a full schedule
today!

468
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,398
We are booked solid until 6:00.

469
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:08,313
Okay, go this way. Shh.

470
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:11,838
He has everything he needs.
You won't even know he's here.

471
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:15,972
Please, Phyllis. This is the
last time.

472
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:19,889
Yes, it is. I do not want
to hear a peep out of him.

473
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:22,849
Take it!

474
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:42,564
- You need anything?
- A new mom.

475
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:45,480
- I know.
- A new dad.

476
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:52,444
- You need your summer cut.
- Why? Are we on welfare?

477
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:55,577
- What?
- Mom!

478
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,495
Hello. Oh, of course. The
Rivieras.

479
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:02,976
Absolutely. I am all set
for the appointment.

480
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,962
Do you ever wish
you had brothers or sisters?

481
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,400
Oh, I have siblings.

482
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:38,707
- You do?
- Mm-hmm. Brother and a sister.

483
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,622
I'm the baby. Can't you tell?

484
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:43,886
- No.
- They moved away,

485
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,977
have their own lives,
their own families, their own
opinions.

486
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,940
- Don't they come and visit you?
- Me? No.

487
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:56,116
They'll occasionally come to see
Daddy.

488
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:02,078
- Don't they like you?
- Mm.

489
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:05,038
Tater, some people...

490
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:10,173
I'm not for all palates.
I'm more of an acquired taste.

491
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,132
You get me?

492
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:17,050
Not really.

493
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,539
Do you miss your mom?

494
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:30,716
The love of a mother
is the veil of a softer light

495
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,022
between the heart and the
Heavenly Father.

496
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,984
My mother accepted and loved me
for who I was

497
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:40,726
before I even had the words to
ask her to.

498
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,921
Hey, Mom!

499
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:05,185
I caught 16 lightning bugs,
but I let them all go

500
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,666
because if they lose
their light, they die.

501
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,845
Good. I need you to go to
bed now.

502
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:14,499
Are we moving again?

503
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:17,153
I don't know what we're doing.
Please go to bed.

504
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:20,243
Where's Dad?

505
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:24,204
Mom, is he coming back?

506
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:26,119
Why do you constantly make me
repeat myself?

507
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,864
Just for once, do what I ask.
Go. Go!

508
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:05,941
- Afternoon, Mr. Edward.
- Afternoon, Mrs. Maybelle.

509
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:10,119
- Is Gossamer home?
- No, he isn't, Mrs. Maybelle.

510
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,948
George is over at Jimbo's
trailer.

511
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:14,994
Apparently,
he wrecked his bike last night,

512
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:16,822
and he's pretty banged up.

513
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,345
Oh, gracious.

514
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,740
He may be coming to stay
with us for a while.

515
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,611
Well, I hope Jimbo
will be all right.

516
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:26,005
- Mm-hmm.
- Gossamer has always been

517
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:27,920
such a caring young woman.

518
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,401
Anything else I can help you
with?

519
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:35,275
Would you mind giving this
elastic to Gossamer for me?

520
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,190
I want her to use it
on the seersucker skirt

521
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:38,974
she's working on.

522
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:43,239
Yeah. I'll put it on his
workstation with a note on it.

523
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:48,288
- All right, then. Goodbye.
- Mrs. Maybelle,

524
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:51,117
- I'll be glad to carry that bag
the rest of the way for you.
- No!

525
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,814
Thank you, Mr. Edward.

526
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:58,124
You don't seem to know a strong
woman when you see one.

527
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:13,705
"A bundle of sticks or twigs
or branches,

528
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:16,925
especially used for as fuel."

529
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:55,834
Sticks and twigs.

530
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:15,027
Morning.
Eggs and bacon for my boy.

531
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:28,214
Where's Dad?

532
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:31,391
He'll be back soon, Tate.

533
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:33,915
He's mad at me, not you. Okay?

534
00:43:35,221 --> 00:43:38,920
Wait. Do I still have to go
to work with you?

535
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:41,749
- Tate!
- No! No!

536
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:44,926
I don't like that place. I
refuse, Mom.

537
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,843
That place is tortuous,
and Phyllis is evil.

538
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:50,584
I know. I know.

539
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:52,368
But I called Brandon's mother
and arranged for you

540
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:53,979
to spend all day tomorrow
with Brandon while I'm at work.

541
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:55,937
- What about today?
- I'm sorry, Tate.

542
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:58,026
I need you to do this today.

543
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,202
Oh, Mom!

544
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,773
Wish you'd get
fired.

545
00:44:05,947 --> 00:44:07,383
Hello?
Oh, good morning, Phyllis.

546
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:10,691
We were just on our way out the
door.

547
00:44:10,865 --> 00:44:14,521
No. Billy is actually not around
today after all.

548
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:20,527
No. I understand.

549
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:23,095
I'll figure something out,
and I'll see you at 9.

550
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:25,140
No, I promise. I won't be late.

551
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:42,288
My favorite neighbors.

552
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,118
Hi. Gossamer, right?

553
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:48,947
- That's right.
- Is Edward home?

554
00:44:51,036 --> 00:44:54,779
Yeah. Yeah. Come in.

555
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:05,224
Mrs. Milliken, everything all
right?

556
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:10,359
Mr. Bryant, I know
you don't know us...me.

557
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:15,321
I haven't made the effort
to be as neighborly as I...

558
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:18,193
The thing is, I work in the
city,

559
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:20,935
and Tate's dad is unavailable,
and I know it's a great deal to
ask.

560
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:22,850
Excuse me. Miss Frannie,

561
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:24,852
how would Tate like to
hang out with us for the day?

562
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:28,160
We have no other plans
other than looking after Jimbo.

563
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:32,294
I'll be back by 6.

564
00:45:32,468 --> 00:45:35,210
He's in capable hands.
I raised three children myself.

565
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:38,387
That's right, and we've all
become upstanding individuals,

566
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:40,520
particularly myself.

567
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:44,916
Tomorrow, you get to
go to Brandon's.

568
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:49,311
Come on, Tate.
Let's go make Jimbo breakfast.

569
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:52,967
Thank you, Edward.
And I'm so sorry.

570
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:54,795
I know I haven't--I mean we
haven't--

571
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:57,972
It's all right, Mrs. Milliken.
I understand.

572
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:02,194
Frannie. Thank you.

573
00:46:02,368 --> 00:46:05,545
Here is my work number
in case there's a problem.

574
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:09,027
Oh, we'll be fine, and don't
worry.

575
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:12,378
I won't let them paint his
fingernails.

576
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:56,683
- I love it!
- Of course you do.

577
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,171
Welcome to my hideout.
Come in.

578
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:09,870
I don't want to ruin anything.

579
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:15,006
Son, I wouldn't be able to tell
if you ruined everything.
Come in.

580
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,269
Take a look around if you'd
like.

581
00:47:32,762 --> 00:47:34,721
Whoa.

582
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:40,683
So what do you do in this place?

583
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:43,599
I'm writing a book of sorts.

584
00:47:43,773 --> 00:47:45,906
Actually, I'm assembling a
compilation

585
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,475
of several of my short stories
for publication.

586
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:52,086
Hmm.

587
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:03,489
Is that Gossamer's mom?

588
00:48:03,663 --> 00:48:07,101
The love of my
life,

589
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:11,149
and that's our wedding day.

590
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:15,675
- Is that Gossamer?
- No, son.

591
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:18,373
That's my daughter, Celia.

592
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:21,333
Then where's Gossamer?

593
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:28,688
- She looks like a boy.
- Well, I suppose you're right.

594
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:32,561
It's that welfare haircut,
Tate.

595
00:48:32,735 --> 00:48:34,563
Did Daddy show you his
dictionary?

596
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:37,001
What?

597
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:40,178
It's a bit decrepit, I'm
afraid.

598
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:43,442
Tate, look up decrepit.

599
00:48:43,616 --> 00:48:46,401
I already know what that
means.

600
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,540
Is this a first edition?

601
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:59,327
No. Publication 1864.

602
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:03,157
The first edition was published
in 1806.

603
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:05,855
This was actually its third
publication.

604
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:15,996
Dorks.

605
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:21,654
Mm-hmm.

606
00:49:31,446 --> 00:49:34,623
And I suppose
she's going to have it.

607
00:49:34,797 --> 00:49:38,497
Okay. And what are you going to
do?

608
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:42,457
I know that I know the answer,
but I want to hear you say it.

609
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:45,417
Stop being a Goddamn coward
and tell me that you're leaving!

610
00:49:49,682 --> 00:49:53,425
There. Now find the guts to tell
your son.

611
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:58,604
Frannie, I need to talk to
you.

612
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,653
Listen, I've tried to be
really understanding

613
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:08,005
about your situation,

614
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:10,746
but today I found this.

615
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,489
It's actually the second one
that I've found

616
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:19,407
where you rang her up for
$149.63

617
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:21,279
instead of

618
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:26,327
$1,496.30.

619
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:29,026
Shit. I am sorry.
Take it out of my pay.

620
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,073
No! This shop is all I have.

621
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:36,294
It was my mother's dream,
and she handed it down to me.

622
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:38,296
I didn't lose it to my second
husband.

623
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,647
I'm certainly not going to lose
it to you.

624
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:49,829
I am asking you to get your
things,

625
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:52,571
and I will cut you your last
check.

626
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:28,911
So what did your little eyes
spy?

627
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:32,437
Hmm.

628
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:34,526
That's a French
lucky button.

629
00:51:36,354 --> 00:51:39,705
- Is it really lucky?
- Has been for me.

630
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:41,446
Hmm.

631
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,796
You may have it if you like.

632
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:48,540
- It's okay.
- Look, I only have one,

633
00:51:48,714 --> 00:51:51,586
so I'll never be able to use it
again.

634
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,676
It's my gift to you,
so you'll always remember me.

635
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:58,202
Hey, Georgie gives me stuff
all the time.

636
00:51:58,376 --> 00:51:59,855
She's even making me this
jacket.

637
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:02,597
She's not going to
charge me nothing for it.

638
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:05,470
Hmm. Wait.

639
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:06,862
Who's Georgie?

640
00:52:07,036 --> 00:52:08,821
It's just an old nickname I
have.

641
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:11,302
Here, take it. I'll even teach
you

642
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:13,913
how to sew it
on the garment of your choice.

643
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:17,134
Help me pick out something
for Jimbo's jacket.

644
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:35,413
Are you leaving?

645
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:37,937
♪ I'm going to Kansas City ♪

646
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:41,027
♪ Kansas City here I come ♪

647
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:44,639
You really should stay in
tonight.

648
00:52:44,813 --> 00:52:46,685
Daddy, you know I got to work.

649
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:49,601
- You work at night?
- Yep.

650
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:51,994
I'm a costume designer
for the most prestigious

651
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,347
musical review show in Kansas
City, perhaps the entire
Midwest.

652
00:52:56,521 --> 00:52:59,437
- What's it called?
- "Doppelganger."

653
00:52:59,611 --> 00:53:01,613
- Well, that sounds dumb.
- Excuse me.

654
00:53:01,787 --> 00:53:03,615
Do you know what a doppelganger
is?

655
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:05,312
- No.
- Yeah.

656
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:08,359
Well, you better consult
that dictionary, boy.

657
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:10,622
I could use your help with
Jimbo.

658
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:13,451
You don't need to go
gallivanting.

659
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:16,628
Jimbo is sleeping,
and I have a job, Daddy.

660
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:18,020
Can we please not?

661
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,632
For one night, can we not do
this?

662
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:24,897
Just let me go.
Let me go, and let me be me.

663
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:34,950
My mom's home.

664
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:46,135
I am trying.

665
00:53:47,528 --> 00:53:52,316
It may not seem like it, but I
am trying.

666
00:54:23,477 --> 00:54:24,783
Mom?

667
00:54:26,698 --> 00:54:28,090
Mom?

668
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:39,450
Mom?

669
00:54:44,716 --> 00:54:47,632
Mom? Mom!

670
00:54:49,024 --> 00:54:50,765
What's wrong?

671
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:55,117
It's 8:30.

672
00:54:57,946 --> 00:55:00,079
Oh, um...

673
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:06,085
I'm off today, baby.

674
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:11,003
Can you make yourself some
cereal?

675
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:13,092
But what about Brandon?

676
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:16,704
- I'm not going into the city
today.
- Mom!

677
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:18,402
It has to be another day.

678
00:55:18,576 --> 00:55:22,928
Come on, Mom! You promised!
Fine! Dad will take me!

679
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:32,067
He can't, baby. He's not here.

680
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:34,461
He's never here.

681
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:38,726
Where is he, anyway? Where is
he?

682
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:43,470
I'm calling his work.

683
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:48,040
When are you coming home?

684
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:52,131
What? I don't want to be a big
brother!

685
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:09,496
Stop calling, you lying asshole!

686
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,933
Stop calling!

687
00:56:12,107 --> 00:56:14,066
Yuuhh!

688
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:32,301
Hey, Tate. You okay?

689
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:36,697
Baby, why don't you
just come over here with us?

690
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:26,051
You know what? I bet he's got
another woman over there.

691
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:28,488
Now, that's exceedingly
speculative.

692
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:31,622
They've just moved out here.

693
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:33,667
Why would they rent a house out
here?

694
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:35,713
Because he's got someone in
the city

695
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:38,193
and Frannie's trying to keep
him away from her
geographically.

696
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:41,153
You've been watching too many
afternoon drama programs

697
00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:43,068
on the television.

698
00:57:43,242 --> 00:57:45,636
Okay, but mark my words,
Daddy.

699
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,507
He's been double dipping.

700
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:49,988
Maybe he has a drinking
problem.

701
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:52,686
Maybe that's your problem.

702
00:57:56,908 --> 00:57:58,126
Hello?

703
00:58:00,215 --> 00:58:03,088
Yeah. He's here, Junior.

704
00:58:05,177 --> 00:58:08,006
It's your good son. He forgot to
ask,

705
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:12,576
so you can tell him my ass
is doing just fine.

706
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,665
George.

707
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:31,812
I wasn't aware of
your presence out here.

708
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:49,090
- What is this?
- This is compost.

709
00:58:49,264 --> 00:58:52,093
- Huh?
- Look it up.

710
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:55,140
I don't have my dictionary
with me.

711
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:57,316
Giving up on academia?

712
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:02,451
No. It just doesn't tell me
what the word really means.

713
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:07,761
This compost is rotting
vegetation.

714
00:59:08,327 --> 00:59:10,111
Like stinky old vegetables?

715
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:15,203
Primarily, but they act as
a nutrient for new vegetation.

716
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:22,863
- My dad is having another baby.
- What, your mom and dad?

717
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:28,129
No. My dad and some lady
that works at his office.

718
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:37,356
He's leaving me and my mom
to make a new family with her.

719
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:44,406
He's such a cliche.
Do you know what that means?

720
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:49,324
I do. Oh, Tate.

721
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,042
How do you stay in the lines
so good, Georgie?

722
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:14,741
Channeling Max Factor, baby.

723
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:24,925
What are you doing with that?

724
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:29,147
George.

725
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,889
Preparing to protect myself
if need be.

726
01:00:32,063 --> 01:00:35,109
From who?
Is someone messing with you?

727
01:00:35,283 --> 01:00:36,981
You don't have a clue.

728
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:39,374
None of y'all have any Goddamn
idea

729
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:42,073
what I gotta go through on a
daily basis

730
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:45,903
just to live my life, just to be
myself.

731
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:47,905
I swear, I can't wait
to get the fuck out of here.

732
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,907
- Georgie!
- Gossamer!

733
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:54,215
Gossamer. My name is Gossamer.

734
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:56,130
Dammit, Jimbo, for the past 7
years,

735
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:58,785
all I've asked you to do
is to call me by my name.

736
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,831
Why can't you remember that?

737
01:01:02,093 --> 01:01:05,313
I'm sorry, Gossamer.
I promise I won't forget again.

738
01:01:10,144 --> 01:01:12,451
I mean, why is it so
difficult?

739
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:15,323
Why is all of this so hard?

740
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:18,892
I'm living in a cage, Jimbo.

741
01:01:19,066 --> 01:01:20,981
All I see is bars, closed doors,

742
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:23,897
and me being stuck here
for the rest of my life.

743
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:27,335
Hell, even if I save up enough
money, things may not even be
better in New York.

744
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:29,250
They may not be better nowhere,

745
01:01:29,424 --> 01:01:31,905
so tell me that there's
something out there better
for me.

746
01:01:33,211 --> 01:01:36,910
It is. I know it is.
It's going to be better.

747
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:49,896
- Hey.
- Hey.

748
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:55,510
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

749
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:57,686
It's time to get up.

750
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:19,578
Fedora.

751
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:22,624
Easy, a hat,
usually a felt hat, I think.

752
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:30,371
Fetlock.

753
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:33,853
Is that something to do with
a horse or part of a horse?

754
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:36,987
Wow, you're actually smart.

755
01:03:46,213 --> 01:03:47,954
Faggot.

756
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:55,266
What's the word?

757
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,445
Faggot. F-A-G-G-O-T.

758
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:05,058
You found one I don't know.
What's the dictionary say?

759
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:18,115
Never mind. How about gambit?

760
01:04:19,116 --> 01:04:21,292
- Tate.
- What is gambit?

761
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:24,512
Tate, it's okay to ask.

762
01:04:28,038 --> 01:04:29,648
What does it mean?

763
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:33,826
A faggot is a cruel name

764
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,177
for a person who likes someone
who's the same sex they are,

765
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:41,312
like if a boy likes or loves
another boy

766
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:44,315
as more than just a friend.

767
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:48,014
Like if a boy wanted
to kiss another boy?

768
01:04:48,188 --> 01:04:50,103
Yes.

769
01:04:51,757 --> 01:04:55,369
Well, why isn't it in the
dictionary?

770
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:58,851
Bad words aren't in
the dictionary, and we should
never use it.

771
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,248
Any other questions?

772
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:09,601
Can we have Gossamer
and Edward over for dinner?

773
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:12,517
Yes, and Jimbo?

774
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:15,215
Yes, definitely Jimbo.

775
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:19,132
Well, that's going to be fun.

776
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:23,180
Gooseberry.

777
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:27,706
Gooseberry? It's a berry.

778
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,276
It's a little berry.
It's a poisonous berry.

779
01:06:04,873 --> 01:06:07,398
- Hey.
- Hello.

780
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:18,104
Did she bring you her
tuna noodle casserole?

781
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:21,238
- What is in that?
- She won't tell.

782
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:25,503
It's her secret recipe.
Daddy thinks it's shoe polish.

783
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:29,681
I said it tastes like shoe
polish.

784
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:32,510
Well, either way, it was so
chewy we couldn't eat it,

785
01:06:32,684 --> 01:06:34,773
and it clogged up the disposal.

786
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:37,254
Man, she's been bringing
those things to us for years

787
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:39,560
ever since Mama died.

788
01:06:39,734 --> 01:06:42,172
And we don't have the heart
to ask her to stop,

789
01:06:42,346 --> 01:06:44,391
though God knows we've hinted.

790
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,611
And hinted and hinted.

791
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:53,705
I like the tuna noodle
casserole.

792
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:55,794
- No!
- Ew.

793
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:59,841
- It cleans out my bowels.
- Shoe polish.

794
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:10,156
Oh, Tater, it's 10:30,
way past bedtime.

795
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:12,724
Oh, no.

796
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:15,640
School starts next week.
We've got to get you on
schedule.

797
01:07:15,814 --> 01:07:17,685
But I'm not tired.

798
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:22,212
Well, this old man certainly
is. We should get going.

799
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:25,215
Say good night, go brush
your teeth, and I'll be
upstairs in a sec.

800
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:28,305
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

801
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:31,177
Wait, can Gossamer tuck me in?

802
01:07:32,265 --> 01:07:34,702
If she wants to.

803
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:37,401
- Race you upstairs.
- Oh, you're on.

804
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:41,231
Bet I'll beat you!
Last one up is a rotten egg.

805
01:07:41,405 --> 01:07:44,495
- I ain't no rotten egg.
- We needed this.

806
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:47,106
So did we. Thank you.

807
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,065
So did I.

808
01:08:24,535 --> 01:08:28,495
Oh!

809
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:49,125
Whoo!

810
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:23,637
Fran, Tate, hello.

811
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:53,798
Tater?

812
01:09:53,972 --> 01:09:55,974
Where's Tate?

813
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:58,194
- Get out.
- Where the hell is he?

814
01:09:58,368 --> 01:09:59,804
How dare you break in here.

815
01:09:59,978 --> 01:10:02,807
"Break in." My name is on the
lease, Frannie.

816
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:05,984
I've been calling here umpteen
times a day for weeks now.

817
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:09,466
Oh, yes, we have been
so impressed with your
dialing skills.

818
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,685
Your concern is so Goddamn
apparent.

819
01:10:11,859 --> 01:10:15,341
- Yeah, well, I am concerned.
- Oh, bullshit. You left us.

820
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:17,778
We're splitting up, Frannie.
That's what happens.

821
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:20,390
Somebody leaves. Jesus, you
don't just stick around

822
01:10:20,564 --> 01:10:22,000
treading in the waters of
misery.

823
01:10:22,174 --> 01:10:23,871
Oh, well, that's so easy
for you to say.

824
01:10:24,045 --> 01:10:25,786
You're already swimming
in another fucking pool.

825
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,484
Oh, you seem to forget,
Miss Holier Than Thou,

826
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:29,268
that I'm not the only bad guy
here, okay?

827
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:32,358
You cheated on me first, you,
Frances.

828
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:34,882
That was a long time ago
before Tate, and you know it.

829
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:37,494
It was just your misfortune
that he didn't love you back.

830
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:39,147
You asshole.

831
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:41,280
You'd be doing the exact
same thing that I'm doing.

832
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:43,369
If he had snapped his fingers,
you would have left me in a
second.

833
01:10:43,543 --> 01:10:45,719
You would have been long gone,
and you know it.

834
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:03,520
Where's Tate, Frances?

835
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:11,876
He's fine.
He's at a new friend's house.

836
01:11:15,096 --> 01:11:16,924
Now get out.

837
01:11:21,712 --> 01:11:22,887
Slow down, Tate.

838
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:28,893
Got to watch yourself. Oh.

839
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:30,677
Hey, you got your bag?

840
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:32,505
Tate.

841
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:35,291
Hey, buddy.

842
01:11:35,465 --> 01:11:38,642
What are you doing, Tate?

843
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:44,735
Are you listening to me?
Come here. Get over here.

844
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:47,868
Come on. I'll go with you.

845
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,087
Get over here.

846
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:54,484
Come over here.

847
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:05,756
God, Tate, don't act so happy to
see me.

848
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:07,932
I missed you, buddy.

849
01:12:12,197 --> 01:12:14,547
What in the hell is that?

850
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:18,725
We haven't met, Mr. Milliken.
I'm Edward Bryant.

851
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,078
We haven't? I thought maybe
when we moved in--

852
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:26,603
No, we did not.

853
01:12:26,777 --> 01:12:30,128
Well, now we have.

854
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:35,046
- Are you going to leave again?
- No. Hey.

855
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:40,007
Come here.
I came here to spend some time
with you.

856
01:12:40,181 --> 01:12:42,140
Okay, buddy? Do you want
to go to the ballpark?

857
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:43,837
We can practice a few grounders.

858
01:12:44,011 --> 01:12:46,362
We can get a couple
of root beer floats at A&amp;W.

859
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:48,146
How does that sound?

860
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:56,067
Come on, Tater.
I haven't seen you in weeks.

861
01:12:56,241 --> 01:13:00,027
Let's just get out of here just
for a little bit, just us guys.

862
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:04,728
We should probably consult Mrs.
Milliken before you take
Tate anywhere.

863
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:08,471
- Mister, uh...
- Bryant.

864
01:13:08,645 --> 01:13:10,951
Yeah, that's right, Mr.
Bryant.

865
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:13,998
Thank you for taking an interest
in my son.

866
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:16,653
These past few weeks
have found him in your care

867
01:13:16,827 --> 01:13:18,959
for more than what is
acceptable.

868
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:21,440
I found it perfectly
acceptable

869
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:25,052
to assist Mrs. Milliken
in Tate's care, Mr. Milliken.

870
01:13:25,226 --> 01:13:30,144
That's nice of you, but...
your help is no longer needed.

871
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:33,060
I'm back now,

872
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:37,630
so if you wouldn't mind
leaving me and my son alone.

873
01:13:37,804 --> 01:13:41,504
Mr. Milliken, let me be clear.

874
01:13:41,678 --> 01:13:44,768
I will not allow you to
remove Tate from the premises

875
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:49,860
until I hear directly from Mrs.
Milliken that you have her
permission.

876
01:13:52,384 --> 01:13:56,083
Listen, neighbor,
contrary to what you've

877
01:13:56,257 --> 01:13:58,738
probably heard about me,
I'm not a bad guy.

878
01:13:58,912 --> 01:14:00,697
Frances, she isn't innocent in
all this.

879
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,221
I'm neither judge nor jury,
Mr. Milliken.

880
01:14:03,395 --> 01:14:06,485
My sole concern is Tate's
wellbeing.

881
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:10,054
Red rover, red rover,
we thought we'd come over.

882
01:14:10,228 --> 01:14:13,710
Well, perhaps if you had
that kind of concern

883
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:15,712
for your own son,

884
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:18,541
you wouldn't have this freak
on your hands.

885
01:14:18,715 --> 01:14:20,673
- Sticks and stones, little man.
- I know what you are.

886
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:23,023
And I know what you are.

887
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:25,243
Faggot, don't think I won't lay
you out just 'cause you're
wearing a dress.

888
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,680
Yeah, well, this is my
ass-kicking dress.

889
01:14:27,854 --> 01:14:29,508
Stop!

890
01:14:29,682 --> 01:14:33,077
Just stop.

891
01:14:34,252 --> 01:14:36,080
What's going on?

892
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:39,562
Billy?

893
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:42,042
Just trying to take my son
to the ballpark,

894
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:44,088
trying to give him
some father-and-son time.

895
01:14:48,135 --> 01:14:53,097
- I don't want to go.
- Then you don't have to.

896
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,360
Go inside.

897
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:06,066
I suppose we should depart now.

898
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,764
Thank you, Edward.

899
01:15:07,938 --> 01:15:11,637
- I apologize if we intruded.
- I don't.

900
01:15:15,946 --> 01:15:17,774
You can't just keep him from me.

901
01:15:17,948 --> 01:15:21,560
I won't. Let's just see how
interested

902
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:23,954
you are in Tate when your new
baby comes.

903
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:31,091
This is a nice family
you put together, Frances. Ha.

904
01:15:31,265 --> 01:15:33,093
Court should be interesting.

905
01:15:50,807 --> 01:15:54,941
Hey, babe. Oh, honey.

906
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:34,824
Aah!

907
01:20:32,436 --> 01:20:34,438
What you fucking looking at,
Grandpa?

908
01:20:34,612 --> 01:20:38,442
- Hey, Grandpa!
- Whoo hoo hoo!

909
01:20:53,544 --> 01:20:58,244
Hello. I need to report
a missing person--

910
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:03,119
My son.

911
01:21:20,571 --> 01:21:24,575
- Mom!
♪ Found your way
upstream ♪

912
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:29,536
- Your son.
- Yes, he's a transsexual,

913
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:34,411
a cross-dresser, if you will,
but he's still a male
anatomically.

914
01:21:40,504 --> 01:21:43,681
- History of mental illness?
- No.

915
01:21:43,855 --> 01:21:46,336
- Drug use?
- No.

916
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:49,034
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

917
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:07,661
- Why are the police here?
- Tate. I'm sorry, Edward.

918
01:22:07,835 --> 01:22:09,707
Where's Gossamer?

919
01:22:09,881 --> 01:22:13,929
I don't know, Tate, missing.

920
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:16,235
That's why the police are here.

921
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:21,371
Well, did you look?
We can all go help look for her.

922
01:22:23,242 --> 01:22:25,505
I must get back to the
officers now.

923
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,725
Of course.

924
01:22:30,467 --> 01:22:33,731
Mom, we just have to look
in all of her favorite places.

925
01:22:33,905 --> 01:22:37,953
Tate, police will find her.
We just have to wait.

926
01:22:38,127 --> 01:22:42,044
They'll find her, baby. Come on.

927
01:22:42,218 --> 01:22:43,219
Come on.

928
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:23,727
Thank you.

929
01:25:24,945 --> 01:25:26,904
How are you doing?

930
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:35,652
Coping, I suppose.

931
01:25:35,826 --> 01:25:38,045
How's Tate?

932
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:44,922
Confused, heartbroken.

933
01:25:48,055 --> 01:25:49,927
Well, we both are.

934
01:25:52,843 --> 01:25:55,498
Edward, can I do anything?

935
01:25:55,672 --> 01:25:57,848
Is there anything that we can do
to--

936
01:25:58,022 --> 01:26:02,766
No, no, but I thank you for
wanting to.

937
01:26:05,943 --> 01:26:10,861
First couple of days, I hoped
he'd run off to New York City.

938
01:26:13,603 --> 01:26:16,562
George has dreamed of working
there

939
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:18,564
since he was 10 years old.

940
01:26:22,612 --> 01:26:26,703
But to just, you know...

941
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:31,795
jump up and go and not say
goodbye--

942
01:26:32,665 --> 01:26:35,059
he wouldn't do that.

943
01:26:36,495 --> 01:26:41,413
He wouldn't just leave me.
He'd say something.

944
01:26:42,675 --> 01:26:45,069
George always had something to
say.

945
01:26:46,549 --> 01:26:50,640
- Her real name is George.
- Yes.

946
01:26:50,814 --> 01:26:52,598
George.

947
01:26:56,385 --> 01:26:58,952
George.

948
01:27:00,867 --> 01:27:03,174
He's my child.

949
01:27:06,003 --> 01:27:08,962
I haven't always accepted him.

950
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:16,492
I was always too hard on him,
too hard,

951
01:27:19,843 --> 01:27:22,976
and now he's gone.

952
01:27:27,546 --> 01:27:32,421
She is gone.

953
01:27:32,595 --> 01:27:35,685
Gossamer is gone.

954
01:27:37,077 --> 01:27:40,864
Oh, Gossamer, I'm sorry.

955
01:27:41,038 --> 01:27:43,519
I'm so sorry.

956
01:28:14,724 --> 01:28:16,203
Eight.

957
01:28:19,163 --> 01:28:20,904
Well done.

958
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:23,036
Go on, get out of here.

959
01:28:26,866 --> 01:28:29,913
Can you help me?

960
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,310
Thanks, Mom.

961
01:28:35,484 --> 01:28:36,528
- Mm-hmm.
- Bye.

962
01:28:36,702 --> 01:28:38,095
Bye, baby.

963
01:28:48,888 --> 01:28:51,630
I miss her.

964
01:28:51,804 --> 01:28:56,679
I miss her too, more than
I have words to tell you.

965
01:28:58,811 --> 01:29:00,509
Edward...

966
01:29:05,644 --> 01:29:07,298
Can I ask you something?

967
01:29:10,954 --> 01:29:14,697
Gossamer was born a boy, wasn't
she?

968
01:29:16,786 --> 01:29:18,744
Yes, Tate, she was.

969
01:29:26,099 --> 01:29:28,928
How come she wanted to be a
girl?

970
01:29:31,235 --> 01:29:35,544
I think she thought she made a
better girl than she did a boy.

971
01:29:35,718 --> 01:29:37,981
It was more natural for her.

972
01:29:39,765 --> 01:29:43,943
Oh. Well, that's okay.

973
01:29:44,117 --> 01:29:47,643
Yeah, that's okay.

974
01:29:54,998 --> 01:29:58,654
Do you think Gossamer
will ever come back?

975
01:29:58,828 --> 01:30:00,264
I'm not sure, Tate.

976
01:30:07,924 --> 01:30:09,926
But this came in the mail for
you today.
