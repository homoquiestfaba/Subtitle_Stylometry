1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,043
- Thank you Jesus!
Thank you Lord!

2
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:05,482
Oh, we received justice
for these children.

3
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:07,575
Thank you Jesus,
that they convicted!

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,599
Yes, yes! Glory glory glory
glory glory glory glory glory

5
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:12,140
glory glory glory glory glory
glory glory glory glory glory!

6
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:13,998
Hallelujah! Yes, Jesus!

7
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:15,859
- There were still many
signs of grief today

8
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:18,498
and then signs of relief
and also tears of joy

9
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:20,724
as New Yorkers received
word that the Monster Mom

10
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:24,392
had been found guilty on four
counts of first degree murder.

11
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:27,024
The jurors deliberated for
only an hour today and they--

12
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:27,939
(loud vocalizing)

13
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:30,509
- No singing in the
holding room, ladies.

14
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,501
- Will you honor the unofficial list?

15
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,119
- No, non-union go home.

16
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,281
- [Voiceover] On everything
I love, I hate people

17
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:37,699
because they're
the fucking worst.

18
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,449
- [Nique] I'm so sorry.
- [Caleb] Move.

19
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,650
- I had to--

20
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:43,611
- [Voiceover] I mean,
I just can't take it

21
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:46,867
just how dumb and
lazy most people are.

22
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:49,217
(indistinct talking)

23
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:51,699
- I took some petty
cash to make copies.

24
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,725
I didn't have enough for more.

25
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,509
- Do you have a debit card, sweetie?
- What?

26
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:57,674
- (mocking) Do you have
a debit card, sweetie?

27
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:59,159
- I have my debit card.

28
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,747
- So.

29
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,526
- [Voicemail] It's so
awful, it's entertaining.

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,975
It's so ugly, it's beautiful.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,851
- Morning. Do you know how
many dancers per group?

32
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:10,927
- Twenty.

33
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,625
- [Alan] Do you know if
they're seeing non-union today?

34
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,316
- [Caleb] No.
- [Alan] No they're not, or no

35
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,659
- NO.

36
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:18,032
[Voiceover] And it's my
belief that when we aren't

37
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:21,376
in tune with reality,
when we aren't accepting

38
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:25,474
of what's real, of the truth
of the ugly of our whole selves

39
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,821
that life loses all
light, loses all purpose,

40
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,359
loses all meaning,
loses all beauty.

41
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:33,275
For without acknowledging truth,

42
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,909
recognizing that ugly
exists, is inherent in all,

43
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:41,351
without establishing
that, there's no way

44
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,324
to determine beauty.

45
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,224
To prove beauty exists,

46
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:49,050
beauty is in comparison to ugly.

47
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,451
For there to be beauty,
there must be ugly.

48
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:55,325
It's a fact. It's ugly.

49
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,725
It's beautiful.

50
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,050
- She's an apprentice.

51
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,116
- What?

52
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,649
- There are a lot
of girls out there.

53
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,750
- So we have to type.
They're all union?

54
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:04,804
- Yes.

55
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,192
- Bring them in in groups of 20.

56
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:07,817
- Brilliant.

57
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:09,417
- What?
- Nothing.

58
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:12,501
- [Voiceover] And so therefore,
we must not make believe.

59
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:18,350
I cannot make believe that all
is equal, that all is good,

60
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,976
that there is no ugly,
no worse, no difference.

61
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:25,319
Things must be relative
to something else.

62
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,616
- Alan!

63
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,809
- [Voiceover] In order for good
to exist, there must be bad.

64
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:34,458
To recognize happiness,
you must experience sad.

65
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:36,217
- Go set up studio D.

66
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:40,265
- But that session is not until 4.
- Clearly, you need the extra time.

67
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:43,300
- Are you ready?

68
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:45,917
- Yes. Ladies,
follow me quickly.

69
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:49,724
- [Voiceover] It's
duality. It's beautiful.

70
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:53,792
(upbeat music)

71
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,804
- Before Johnson
begins I just wanted

72
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:59,484
to thank you divas
for coming out today.

73
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,734
- [Girl] Thank you!

74
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,953
- OK. Johnson.

75
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:10,033
- [Johnson] Breathe,
ladies. Breathe.

76
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:13,124
This has a very
jazzy, sexy feel.

77
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:17,024
We need length,
stretch and technique.

78
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:21,613
It's very sensual,
think sassy, OK?

79
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:27,495
Let's begin. We have one,
two, back three, four

80
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,650
split left, right,
left and right.

81
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:38,179
Again, we have out,
back, step to the left...

82
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:43,531
- [Voiceover] We are
blessed with certain gifts

83
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:47,824
and we are cursed with certain
misgivings that we cannot

84
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,534
aspire to be more
than we inherently are

85
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:55,575
and we don't all know
that, but we should.

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,099
(Johnson instructing)

87
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:09,547
- Can you get some coffee?

88
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:17,992
- [Voiceover] It's a
tragedy. It's an epiphany.

89
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:23,869
It's transcendent, its
ugly, it's...beautiful.

90
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:28,728
(hip hop music)

91
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,603
- [Alan] Hi guys, thank
you so much for coming.

92
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:14,306
So in five minutes
we're going to start.

93
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,782
I'm going to call all your names
and you're going to line up over here-

94
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:17,596
- [Caleb] Take this to the table, thank
you.

95
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,127
- [Alan] But--
- [Caleb] Thank you.

96
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:28,446
OK, can I have Kyley
Taylor, Kimmie....

97
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:33,470
You, Kimmie, and Cat
Davis. All right.

98
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:36,579
You three, 16 bars, strict
16, they will cut you off.

99
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,923
By the door please, thank you.

100
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:41,525
Everybody else, thank you.

101
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,517
- Thank you Kimmie D-
Kimmie...

102
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:53,868
Kimmie.

103
00:06:12,492 --> 00:06:14,696
- Hi, everybody.

104
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:20,463
- Hi, Kyley. What will you
be singing for us today, hon?

105
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,999
- Uh, "Mean to Me".

106
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:32,534
OK, sorry, I'm a little nervous.

107
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,765
I'm kind of new to singing.

108
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,218
- Oh, you're new. How new?

109
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:38,757
Uh..

110
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:41,299
Like, I don't know
how to answer that.

111
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:42,898
Like, new new?

112
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:45,492
- [Ricardo] You'll be fine, sweetie.
- [Johnson] You'll be fine.

113
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:50,624
(piano playing)

114
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:55,710

- So pretty. So pretty.

138
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,113
- Thank you.
- [Kim] No, thank you Kyley.

139
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:27,160
- [Ricardo]
(whispering) So pretty.

140
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,731
(sighing)
So pretty.

141
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:31,863
- [Caleb] Shut up.
- [Ricardo] Fuck you.

142
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:34,701
- Thank you, Kyley.

143
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,442
- Thank you!
- [Kyley] Thank you!

144
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,467
(affirmative murmuring)

145
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,106
- Caleb, you can tell them
that we're done for the day.

146
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,121
Thank you.

147
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,777
- All right, ladies, ladies.

148
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:59,809
You, wonderful. Everybody
else, thank you.

149
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,793
- Do you know when
they'll be making calls?

150
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,871
- No. You shouldn't
worry about it.

151
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,176
- [Elliott] Yoohoo,
Caleb. Caleb!

152
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,902
Hey, stop acting like that.

153
00:10:16,927 --> 00:10:18,496
- (mocking) "Stop
acting like that."

154
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:20,520
You're such a fucking faggot, I swear.
- You're a faggot, stop.

155
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:21,712
- You should go home,
we're not going to see

156
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:24,090
any non-union today, plus
they don't want any negros.

157
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:25,863
They cut us all.

158
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,527
- I'm only half negro.

159
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:29,809
- They don't want you either, Paki.
- Shut up.

160
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,684
- Did you make the
copies of those scripts

161
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,809
I asked you about yesterday?

162
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,180
- No, the machine is down.

163
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:38,747
- People are waiting on
these scripts, Caleb.

164
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,176
They have to be delivered.

165
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:42,610
- OK, I can have an
intern go and do it-

166
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:47,223
- Or you can go. Thoughts?

167
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:55,293
- Ow, bitch.

168
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:56,926
- "Ow, bitch." You
should go home.

169
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:59,552
We're having appointments pretty
soon, I'll get you one, OK?

170
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,458
- But can you get me in today?

171
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,590
- (mocking) No, I will
get you an appointment

172
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,402
when we set them up.

173
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:07,207
And stop flirting with these
boys, you look desperate.

174
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,613
Doesn't he look desperate?

175
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:10,638
You look desperate, pitiful.

176
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:16,140
- Hey.

177
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,652
Uh, that's my brother.

178
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,899
Yeah, yeah. He-

179
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:23,598
he's my brother.

180
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:26,668
I'm a-going.

181
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:30,918
- What are you doing?

182
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,027
- [Nique] Finish setting up--
- [Caleb] Come.

183
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:38,214
I'm sorry that today
was a bit messy but I--

184
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,262
- A bit messy?

185
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:40,327
- But I literally
got there and--

186
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:41,520
- I don't care!

187
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:45,134
OK, nobody cares. You
are the apprentice.

188
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:48,768
I made you the apprentice
from an intern for a reason.

189
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:51,799
Apprentices have answers.
Interns have excuses.

190
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:53,231
- But I need to--

191
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:54,809
- It's not just about today, OK?

192
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,168
You were gone for
those two weeks.

193
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:58,259
You're all messy and
moody and shit now.

194
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,810
I mean, buck up bitch! Ain't
nobody got time for that!

195
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:03,576
- My mother died

196
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,887
and when she died I went
home as late as I could

197
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:07,832
and came back the next
day from California

198
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,607
because I wanted
to be committed.

199
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:12,284
I am so committed! I'm not
even getting paid, really.

200
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:14,324
- Oh! You're not getting paid?

201
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:15,238
- That's not what I meant--

202
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:18,395
- I guess $50 a day is just
too much for some bitches I guess, huh?

203
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,877
I guess some bitches are
real grandiose, right?

204
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:23,512
- Please don't call me a bitch.
- See, I feel differently.

205
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:27,620
I feel like $50 a day is much
too much for a bitch who can't

206
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:31,167
remember to bring water for
our fucking casting session.

207
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:33,027
I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life.
- I'm sorry.

208
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,098
- I swear, you know what?

209
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:37,777
I don't think we'll need
your $50 services ever again.

210
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:39,496
You're dismissed.

211
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:41,613
- Caleb, don't.
- Good day.

212
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,394
(hip hop music)

213
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:50,387
(indistinct talking)

214
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,877
- [Voiceover] When I was a
boy, I peed the bed at night.

215
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,893
Either two things would happen:
sometimes I knew immediately

216
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:46,885
I would suddenly feel a
warm, wet sensation on my leg

217
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,934
and then I knew I
wasn't dreaming.

218
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,838
I would open my eyes and try
to quietly and quickly hide

219
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:55,878
my sheets before my mother found out.

220
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,895
My step-mother found out.

221
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,065
If she found out, she would
no doubt berate my existence,

222
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,201
my inability to function
as a human being,

223
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:09,972
to measure up to a civilized
standard, that I was too smart

224
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:13,386
to be so dumb and
worse, that I was nasty.

225
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:17,112
Dirty, like swine
wallowing in its own filth.

226
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:23,268
I was filthy and she would
say those things, upset,

227
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:25,886
as she stripped my bed
of the gold-tinted sheets

228
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:28,692
having me scrub the
mattress with a concoction

229
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:31,698
of vinegar, soap and hot water,

230
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:36,401
trying to dilute the
stain, clear my piss,

231
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:39,426
my brother Elliott quietly
laughing from his bed

232
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:44,106
and though hurt and
embarrassed, I wouldn't cry.

233
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:48,761
I was just enraged, mad,
angry, not at my mom

234
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:52,051
but at myself for
being 'less than'.

235
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:54,801
Still other times, in
the other scenario,

236
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:57,379
when I pissed myself,
I wouldn't know.

237
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:02,102
I would wake up the
next day, cold liquid,

238
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:05,606
causing my pajamas to stick to my body

239
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,776
and only then would I realize

240
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:12,934
what had happened and
then my mom still yelled,

241
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:17,645
I'd still clean,
Elliott still laughed.

242
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,424
The only difference is
that I still dreamed,

243
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:24,215
I finished my dream.

244
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:30,568
It was not cut off abruptly
be an unpleasant reality

245
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:34,340
and who knows if the
dream was happy or sad

246
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:35,919
or scary but,

247
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:38,697
it at least happened

248
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:40,879
and that happening

249
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:43,634
would forever be
a moment of peace.

250
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,384
Even wallowing in piss,

251
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:52,650
laying, sleeping in filth.

252
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,115
- Oh really, Tracy?

253
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,473
You really think I'm the
fucking problem here?

254
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:03,513
Really?

255
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,333
I am NOT the fucking problem!

256
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:13,294
It's your problem.

257
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:18,746
I am, done. With you.

258
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:22,591
- In myself, I know you
just to be an eater of dust.

259
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:25,787
Leave me here

260
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:29,387
and lower it year by year

261
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:32,787
as you promised till
the last be an oubliette

262
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:36,833
and my name inscribed
on the four winds.

263
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:39,857
Still, still I win!

264
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:46,599
I have been a woman and
loved as a woman loves

265
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,115
and lost as a woman loses.

266
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,667
I have born a son.

267
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:58,259
He will rule
Scotland and England.

268
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:02,159
(inaudible)

269
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:09,810
- [Kim] It's one
thing after another.

270
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:11,700
I mean, when I hired
you, you were great.

271
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:13,487
You were right here, you
were paying attention,

272
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:14,724
you were doing what
I needed you to do

273
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,700
and I don't know where
the hell you are now.

274
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,708
I talk to you, I ask you to
do stuff and you're just not

275
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:23,169
you're not present any more
and it's driving me nuts, OK?

276
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,607
So I'm boring you?

277
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:27,919
- Of course not. I'm sorry.

278
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:30,192
- The bottom line
is, when I or Ricardo

279
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,365
or another casting director
asks you to do something,

280
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,474
we expect you to
do it specifically.

281
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:37,599
If we wanted an intern or
an apprentice to do it,

282
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,622
we would have asked them.
You're an associate for a reason.

283
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:42,482
We give you associate level
work to do, appreciate that.

284
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:45,013
We could certainly give
it to somebody else.

285
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:47,964
- I'm sorry. Today was not my best--
- [Kim] It's not just today.

286
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:49,700
Anthony and Pierre told me
you were having the intern

287
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,521
set up the appointments?

288
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:52,910
- It was once, and I watched--

289
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:56,357
- [Kim] Come on, confirm
yes, set no. You know that.

290
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:59,138
- Of course. I'm sorry.

291
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,263
- I like you but
I'm not going to--

292
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:04,005
- [Caleb] I know.

293
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:07,379
- Good, now since Nique
didn't work out, I recommend

294
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:10,707
that we move Alan up to the
apprentice position, yes?

295
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:11,669
- Sure, he's great.

296
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:13,646
- [Kim] Excellent. Can you--
(cell phone buzzes)

297
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:18,752
Kim Kelly.
(chuckling)

298
00:18:18,777 --> 00:18:22,115
Yes, hey, how are you?

299
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:25,642
So.... mm-hm.

300
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,600
(indistinct talking)

301
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,591
- OK, how would you like to
be the next casting apprentice

302
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:46,864
at Kim Kelly Casting?

303
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:48,818
- What about Nique?

304
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:50,803
- Again, how would you
like to be the next

305
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:53,208
casting apprentice here
at Kim Kelly Casting?

306
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,622
(nervous laughing)
- Yes.

307
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:59,472
- Good. Confirm these two
appointments for tomorrow.

308
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:01,763
- Confirm these appointments?
You mean set them?

309
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:04,039
- [Caleb] Tomato, tom-ah-to.

310
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:12,376
- Hi, can I get some iceberg lettuce and

311
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:15,285
cheese and bacon.

312
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,957
- Apples, mandarin
oranges, grapes.

313
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:23,142
- Chicken, beans, turkey, bacon.

314
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:26,083
- No, never mind, don't
put the cheese and bacon.

315
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:32,090
- Sunflower seeds, feta,
not blue cheese, feta. Feta.

316
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:35,972
- Cheddar and ranch dressing
please. Extra ranch.

317
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:38,122
- Chicken and
croutons. Thank you.

318
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:43,072
- Croutons and balsamic vinaigrette.

319
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:44,191
Thanks.

320
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,302
- Hi could I just get some
romaine with salmon and vinegar?

321
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,396
Thanks.

322
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,693
- I love her. LOVE her.

323
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:51,583
- Easy, hater.

324
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,563
- [Pierre] I don't care if
Halle Berry has a fucking Oscar.

325
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:56,885
If you're not right you're not
right and she is not right.

326
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,325
- Just shut up.

327
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,333
Don't nobody care about
your casting thoughts

328
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:01,935
on an imaginary movie, loser.

329
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,645
- "Don't nobody care"? You
shut up, or speak English.

330
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,716
- I was speaking English.
- Well speak it properly.

331
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:08,743
- I can properly tell
you to suck my dick

332
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:10,268
or wait, is that what
Anthony told you?

333
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:13,365
- No!
- Are you guys...? Oh, that was a little secret, right?

334
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,750
- You're such a fucking bitch.

335
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:21,169
I can't believe you told him that.
- Oh yeah, everything.

336
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:23,918
Cum shots, how big,
how small, the works.

337
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:25,005
- Fucks you!

338
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,208
- About how you cried because
you didn't get into film

339
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:30,871
school, about how you needed
someone to make you feel good.

340
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,068
- This is not savory
lunch conversation, OK?

341
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:35,879
- I agree, so can we not
pretend-cast the movie

342
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,825
as some crazy bitch who
killed her kids this morning?

343
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,716
That shit's insensitive.

344
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,283
- We were just
having fun, Caleb.

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:36,101
so sad, so silent.

515
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:42,186
The man says, "I'm
blind", embarrassed.

516
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:47,132
Bartender pauses, pours
him another drink, says,

517
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,274
"Then how did you get here?"

518
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,843
The man swigs his drink,
he walks out the bar.

519
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:59,725
The bartender laughs.

520
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:06,599
- [Boyfriend] What's up, bitch?

521
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,670
- [Nique] Baby, hold up, please.
- [Boyfriend] Yeah, you heard me you little fucking bitch.

522
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,921
You fire her? Huh? Huh?

523
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:13,514
(Yelling)
You fire her, huh?

524
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:16,171
You think my girl's like a little bitch, huh?
- [Nique] Baby, please!

525
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:17,887
- Pick on me, you fucking bitch!

526
00:32:17,912 --> 00:32:19,460
Pick on me, bitch!

527
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:20,780
(Nique gasping)

528
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:29,733

- [TV Reporter] As
jury selection begins
in the Monster Mom

530
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:48,356
trial that has rocked the city
like no other crime in recent

531
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:51,474
history, new details emerge
from the accused social

532
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:54,007
networking pages
that have many asking

533
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:56,491
could this tragedy
have been avoided?

534
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,241
Were there signs that
could have prevented

535
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:00,304
this mother's massacre?

536

(door opening and closing)

537
00:33:17,384 --> 00:33:20,937
(footsteps approaching)

538
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:31,474
- Caleb, Nate's here.

539
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:34,101
- How you feeling, baby?

540
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:35,562
- Nate?

541
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:37,251
- Yeah, I'm here.

542
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:39,271
- Get out.

543
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:42,109
- Caleb--
- Get. Out.

544
00:33:42,134 --> 00:33:44,272
- [Nate] Caleb, come on, I'm trying.
- Get out. Get out!

545
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:45,590
- All right, all right.

546
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,702
- [Nettie] So she was singing
this song and she had to stop

547
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:54,373
and she was like, "Is
somebody singing with me?"

548
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:57,474
and we looked and it
was so embarrassing

549
00:33:57,898 --> 00:34:01,459
because the accompanist
was humming along.

550
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:04,491
(laughing)
It was so ridiculous!

551
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:07,007
And Kim had to ask him
to leave after lunch.

552
00:34:07,032 --> 00:34:11,406
I mean, look. Nice?

553
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:14,741
So anyway, Kim had to ask
him to leave after lunch

554
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:17,124
and I mean, who
does he think he is?

555
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:20,234
Does he think he's a singer in
a fucking duplex or something

556
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,288
like, it's not your time
to shine, Piano Man.

557
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:24,593
So anyway, unfortunately,
I had to be the one

558
00:34:24,618 --> 00:34:27,619
to find a frickin' piano
player after that...

559
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:44,510
- You look good.

560
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:46,143
- Elliott, get her out of here.
- Caleb.

561
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,690
- I didn't come for
this today, you know I'm

562
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:51,887
still recovering from--
- Then leave, Stephanie. You should go!

563
00:34:51,912 --> 00:34:53,815
- Why does he say
stuff life that?

564
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,932
- All right, all right.
- Why do you want to hurt me?

565
00:34:55,957 --> 00:35:00,190
- All right, everyone just calm down. Relax.
- Shut up you Paki fuck!

566
00:35:01,194 --> 00:35:04,018
- You see this, mom? You see how he gets?
- Get the fuck out Elliott, leave!

567
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:06,346
I don't want you here!
Get the fuck out!

568
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,546
- Don't talk to your
baby brother like that.

569
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:13,862
- Baby brother?

570
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:18,266
- He's taken all this time to
take care of you every day.

571
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,815
He's given up a lot for you!

572
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,793
- What, his flourishing
career? Oh fucking please.

573
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:24,705
- He has!

574
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,642
- What about me? What
about all I've given up?

575
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,979
Should we discuss that?
Do we go through that?

576
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:32,400
- Here we go. We don't discuss--

577
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:36,518
- Oh, my super mother bitch!

578
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:41,860
- I am your mother,
don't you dare.

579
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,565
Don't you dare speak
to me like that!

580
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,619
- You killed my mother, you
bitch. You fucking bitch!

581
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:49,288
- I took care of you like
you were my own child!

582
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,361
You were my child,

583
00:35:50,385 --> 00:35:53,943
You are my child!
- I'm no part of you, you terrorist devil!

584
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:57,411
- I did everything.

585
00:35:58,508 --> 00:36:00,793
Be mad at your real mother.

586
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:04,683
She left you. She
killed herself.

587
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:05,560
Be mad at her!

588
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:09,599
- You're a home wrecking
slut and you always will be.

589
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:13,459
Nothing can clean you
up. You disgust me.

590
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:24,388
- Yup, the slut that
your father wanted.

591
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:28,059
Be mad at him, not me.

592
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:35,029
- Nothing could clean you up!
(Stephanie crying out)

593
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:42,489
You're a slut. You're
a fucking slut!

594
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:44,973
You're a slut!

595
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:11,533
("Wade in the Water" by Nhojj)

596
00:40:32,488 --> 00:40:34,637
- Hey.

597
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,184
You good? You OK?

598
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:22,963
Um, listen. I gotta run off.

599
00:41:22,988 --> 00:41:25,699
I have to go to an audition, OK?

600
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:28,474
I'll talk to you later?

601
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:42,098
(delighted squealing)

602
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:46,197
- Hey!
(indistinct chattering)

603
00:41:46,994 --> 00:41:50,119
- [Ricardo] Caleb, Nettie,
please. Close the door.

604
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:52,893
- Sorry, Ricardo.

605
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,267
- [Ricardo] Check this
out, she's adorable.

606
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:58,876
(overlapping conversation)

607
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:01,901
- [Pierre] Hey. I gotta
run out for some copies.

608
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:04,387
You know the machine.
- Yeah, I need a coffee.

609
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:06,782
- Where are you going?
- I'm running a session.

610
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:08,113
- You're running sessions?

611
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:09,699
- (softly) Yeah.

612
00:42:13,108 --> 00:42:15,609
(phone ringing)

613
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:17,434
- Kim Kelly Casting.

614
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,960
I don't think she's
here right now.

615
00:42:19,985 --> 00:42:21,487
- [Kim] Caleb!

616
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:24,769
- Caleb! Can you
schedule these, 15 minutes each

617
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,254
for tomorrow, start at 2.

618
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:27,497
- Hi, Kim.

619
00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:28,565
(chuckling)
- Hi, Caleb.

620
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,204
I'm sorry, just running.
You get it, right?

621
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:31,419
- Why's Nique here?

622
00:42:31,444 --> 00:42:32,636
- We were busy and
needed extra help.

623
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:34,565
I'm sorry, do you have a problem
with my staffing practices?

624
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,178
- Well, she's responsible
for my attack.

625
00:42:36,203 --> 00:42:38,051
- You know she wasn't. I don't
have time for this, Caleb.

626
00:42:38,076 --> 00:42:39,606
- And Alan's running
sessions now?

627
00:42:39,631 --> 00:42:42,486
- Your tone is not
satisfactory, Caleb.

628
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:46,691
- I'm sorry. You're right.
- Listen, I don't care. Kick him out of the room.

629
00:42:46,716 --> 00:42:48,817
Tell him to make calls,
I don't care what you do.

630
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:50,489
You have the authority,
just do it right.

631
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:52,629
- [Nique] Tracy's
on the line for you.

632
00:42:53,432 --> 00:42:55,970
- Kim Kelly. Yeah?

633
00:42:55,995 --> 00:42:59,661
Sure, OK. OK.

634
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,825
All right. Uh-huh.

635
00:43:05,926 --> 00:43:09,434
(gasping)
- Oh, Caleb fucking Dwayne!

636
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:11,403
I heard you were in casting now!

637
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:13,246
- [Caleb] I am.
- Dude, how's Elliott?

638
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:14,309
- He's fine.

639
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:17,692
- Aw, man. The fucking
Dwayne brothers, fuck me!

640
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:19,208
- Fuck.

641
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,877
- Dude, I haven't seen you
guys since graduation, wow.

642
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:24,012
- Yeah, so do you want
to go ahead and do your--

643
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:25,825
- [Mark] Oh, was
it your accident?

644
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,563
- Huh?

645
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:29,653
- Your face. Is that
why you stopped acting?

646
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:32,536
- Yeah, you got it.

647
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:37,081
- Oh, man. I mean, you look
great but what happened?

648
00:43:37,106 --> 00:43:38,512
- Shit.

649
00:43:38,537 --> 00:43:39,465
- Oh.

650
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,809
Shit, yeah man.

651
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:43,001
That's why I moved
back from L.A.

652
00:43:43,026 --> 00:43:44,340
Shit sucks.

653
00:43:44,365 --> 00:43:46,240
- Yeah. So how about--

654
00:43:46,265 --> 00:43:49,053
- When I'm finished why don't
you call up Elliott and then--

655
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:51,622
- You're going to have
to go audition now!

656
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:54,989
OK? Now leave, I'm working here.

657

catch up, old friend.

- No.

660
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,942
- I'll just go?
- Go.

00:47:15,023 --> 00:47:16,170
- How'd I do?

686
00:47:16,195 --> 00:47:18,388
- Huh?
- At the audition, How'd I do?

687
00:47:18,413 --> 00:47:19,497
- I don't know.

688
00:47:19,522 --> 00:47:20,905
- But I was auditioning for you.

689
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,084
- I wasn't paying attention.

690
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,123
- Why wouldn't you?

691
00:47:23,148 --> 00:47:25,514
- I don't know,
you fucking retard.

692
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:27,707
I don't know.

693
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:31,499
(treadmill slowing)

694
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:36,418
- Well, that was inappropriate.

695
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,311
- [Caleb] You're not talking?

696
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:01,139
You mad at me, hm?

697
00:48:02,702 --> 00:48:05,022
You mad at me?

698
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:07,339
Mad at your big bro-bro, huh?

699
00:48:09,092 --> 00:48:12,075
- Stop, I'm going to punch you.

700
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,639
- So we still going
to the club later

701
00:48:13,664 --> 00:48:16,262
or you going to be
a bitch about it?

702
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:19,076
- Fuck. I'm sorry, I can't.

703
00:48:20,006 --> 00:48:21,553
I have an audition tomorrow, so.

704
00:48:21,578 --> 00:48:23,615
- On a Saturday?
- Well you know, I gotta do what I can

705
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,748
until you can work your magic.

706
00:48:27,418 --> 00:48:29,209
Talk to you later?

707
00:48:29,234 --> 00:48:31,068
- Yeah.

708
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:45,717
("I've Been Waiting
for You" by Nhojj)

709
00:48:53,614 --> 00:48:55,755
- [TV Reporter] New Yorkers
react tonight, the first day

710
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,591
of cross examination in
the Monster Mom case.

711
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:00,755
Shelly Lee has
the story. Shelly?

712
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,638
- Sharon, it was a day
of heartache and tears

713
00:49:02,663 --> 00:49:04,950
that led to many more questions
than there were answers

714
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,625
as the defense tried
desperately to present excuses

715
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:11,066
for what many New Yorkers
say they find inexcusable.

716
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:13,892
Today was a full day in
court as the Monster Mom

717
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,792
looked on, despondent
and very exhausted.

718
00:49:16,817 --> 00:49:19,875
The prosecution went hard today.

719
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,943
(TV fading out)

720
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,240
- [Caleb] You have an audition?

721
00:50:09,265 --> 00:50:11,966
You have an audition to go to, baby brother?
- Caleb, don't all right?

722
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:15,584
- Relax. Relax, Caleb.
- Really, you had an audition on a Saturday?

723
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:17,668
- You had an audition all right to go to?

724
00:50:17,693 --> 00:50:19,825
- You look good, Caleb.
- [both] shut up!

725
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,864
- You lie for a piece of baby
dick right here, for real?

726
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:25,177
- All right, OK. Hey--
- Suck my cunt, Nate.

727
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:27,091
You told me he had a baby dick.

728
00:50:27,116 --> 00:50:28,693
(overlapping arguing)

729
00:50:28,718 --> 00:50:32,894
I did not tell you because
I am a good person!

730
00:50:32,919 --> 00:50:37,488
Unlike you, you liar.
You fucking liar.

731
00:50:37,513 --> 00:50:39,351
- [Elliott] You are
not a good person.

732
00:50:40,396 --> 00:50:43,988
(arguing)

733
00:50:44,013 --> 00:50:47,267
- You're ugly! Look at you.

734
00:50:48,372 --> 00:50:50,708
You're so ugly.

735
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:52,099
I mean, look what you've become.

736
00:50:52,124 --> 00:50:55,064
I can't even be around
you, you're so ugly.

737
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:57,115
- Yup, you got it
Elliot. I'm ugly.

738
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,685
- Yes.
- I'm everything you said and more, you know what

739
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,990
but at least, baby brother, at
least I'm something, Elliott.

740
00:51:03,015 --> 00:51:04,185
At least I'm something.

741
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,794
You, you are no one. I
feel sorry for you.

742
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:09,738
- Oh, don't. Don't feel sorry for me.
- I feel so sorry for you, boo.

743
00:51:09,763 --> 00:51:11,716
- I feel sorry for you,
don't feel sorry for me.

744
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:14,599
- You actually think that you
are working with something.

745
00:51:14,624 --> 00:51:16,998
You actually think that
you have some talent.

746
00:51:17,023 --> 00:51:19,440
Really, you've been in the
game for almost a decade now

747
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:22,193
and you have no receipts, OK?

748
00:51:22,218 --> 00:51:23,810
No credits whatsoever.

749
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:25,310
You know what Nate? No no no.

750
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:30,480
His mom made me give up
going to writing school

751
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:32,990
so that I could go to
the conservatory with him

752
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:34,958
because they would
not take his sorry ass

753
00:51:34,983 --> 00:51:37,404
unless I came too, cause
they knew he was nothing.

754
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:42,082
I gave up everything, all my
dreams, for nothing, for no one

755
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:43,724
hell, they knew he was nothing.

756
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:46,231
Hell, I knew he was nothing,
your momma know you was nothing

757
00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:48,716
OK and I feel so bad.

758
00:51:48,741 --> 00:51:51,005
Day in and day out you come
into my office asking me for an

759
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:54,474
appointment as if I would
actually give you an appointment

760
00:51:54,499 --> 00:51:58,472
as if you aren't nothing, as
if you aren't an embarrassment.

761
00:51:58,497 --> 00:52:00,708
You're nothing, you are no one.

762
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:03,736
- You know what, you've
always been a great writer

763
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:06,286
and look what you've done with that.
- I've been writing something.

764
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:08,368
- At least I'm doing me, all right?
- Yes, do you boo.

765
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:10,318
- And I'm something, I know that I'm something.
- Do nothing boo.

766
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:13,607
- Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
- What are you doing? You're not even writing.

767
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:16,943
(overlapping arguing)

768
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,872
- [Nate] Fuck.

769
00:52:27,091 --> 00:52:30,684
(soft electronic music)

770
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:34,661
(No audio)

771
00:53:12,216 --> 00:53:15,208
- [Janice] What
are you looking at?

772
00:53:17,311 --> 00:53:19,700
- You shouldn't sneak up
on people, little girl.

773
00:53:19,725 --> 00:53:21,779
- First of all, I ain't
sneaking up on nobody

774
00:53:21,804 --> 00:53:24,107
and you shouldn't be in
the middle of the street.

775
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,513
What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

776
00:53:26,538 --> 00:53:27,911
- [Janice] Can I see?
- [Caleb] No.

777
00:53:27,936 --> 00:53:29,200
- Uh, why not?

778
00:53:29,225 --> 00:53:31,794
- Shut up.
- You're so mean.

779
00:53:31,819 --> 00:53:34,411
- Why do you keep talking
to me, little dirty girl?

780
00:53:34,436 --> 00:53:36,927
Don't you have little homeless
friends to go play with or something?

781
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:38,739
- I don't got no
friends no more.

782
00:53:38,764 --> 00:53:39,771
- Because you stink.

783
00:53:39,796 --> 00:53:42,271
- No, it's because my
momma said I have to leave

784
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:44,833
this school for a little while
but I got my friends Shika

785
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:47,165
and Renee, my momma said
they can come over

786
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,005
my house too, so there.

787
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,441
- You should find a police
to take you someplace nice.

788
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:53,708
- [Janice] I'm OK.

789
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:55,372
You're the one that
needs to go some place

790
00:53:55,397 --> 00:53:57,396
before you get hit
by a car, dummy.

791
00:53:57,421 --> 00:53:59,466
- Why do you keep talking
to me, little girl?

792
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:01,310
- My name is not
no "little girl".

793
00:54:01,335 --> 00:54:03,211
My name is Janice. What's yours?

794
00:54:03,236 --> 00:54:05,833
- Satan.
- [Janice] You wanna be my friend?

795
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:07,708
- No. I don't like you.

796
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:08,997
- You so silly.

797
00:54:09,022 --> 00:54:10,147
- You stupid.

798
00:54:10,172 --> 00:54:11,614
- You stupid, stupid-head.

799
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,595
- You a stupid head.
- [Janice] You stupid head.

800
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,878
- Stupid stupid-head.

801
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:16,505
- [Janice]
Stupid-stupid-stupid-head.

802
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,181
- Stupid-stupid-stupid...
(chuckling)

803
00:54:18,206 --> 00:54:20,163
- See? You so silly.

804
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:22,904
- You're right, I'm
silly and stupid.

805
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:24,396
- [Janice] You need to
get out of the street

806
00:54:24,421 --> 00:54:26,997
or you'll get hit by
a car and I'll be sad.

807
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:28,114
- So?

808
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,583
- I'll make you laugh again
if you get out of the street.

809
00:54:30,608 --> 00:54:32,776
I'll make you laugh again.

810
00:54:32,801 --> 00:54:35,114
There's a car coming, you
gotta get out of the street.

811
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:37,411
Please, please get up! You
gotta get out of the street.

812
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:39,644
Please, please. Please, please.

813
00:54:39,669 --> 00:54:42,208
(fading)
(ethereal music)

814
00:54:46,474 --> 00:54:47,716
- [Mom] Get off of my child!

815
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:49,857
What the hell are you doing?

816
00:54:50,515 --> 00:54:53,083
(inaudible)

817
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:57,614
(car honking)
- Janice!

818
00:55:04,007 --> 00:55:07,009
(siren wailing)

819
00:55:10,689 --> 00:55:13,517
- [TV Lawyer] That's when
you discovered the bodies?

820
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:16,767
- [TV Witness] I had walked
past the door several times

821
00:55:16,792 --> 00:55:20,281
going to fix stuff at the
other apartments on the floor

822
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:25,570
and even before that, the
other tenants kept complaining

823
00:55:25,595 --> 00:55:29,765
of the smell and I didn't
think anything of it.

824
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,079
I mean, I had asked her
when I saw her coming out

825
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:35,382
of the building that there
was maybe a dead mouse

826
00:55:35,407 --> 00:55:37,509
or something in the wall.

827
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:40,575
I would have never thought...

828
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,501
And she seemed just fine.

829
00:55:42,526 --> 00:55:45,087
I never thought about it.

830
00:55:45,112 --> 00:55:47,796
And then she didn't pay
her electric, I guess

831
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:52,679
and I had to get into the
apartment and shut it off.

832
00:55:52,704 --> 00:55:53,915
- [Lawyer] Describe
to us the scene

833
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,474
as you entered the
apartment that day.

834
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:59,736
- [Witness] The smell. I'll
never forget the smell.

835
00:56:01,321 --> 00:56:04,976
And I immediately knew
something was wrong.

836
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:07,540
I mean, I almost vomited.

837
00:56:09,923 --> 00:56:14,290
I walked to the bedroom,
it was a one bedroom, so...

838
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:20,565
When I saw those, those bodies

839
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:25,787
of those kids just laying there

840
00:56:25,812 --> 00:56:28,332
together,

841
00:56:29,305 --> 00:56:33,245
tucked in like they
were going to sleep

842
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:38,072
and I couldn't even
scream, I just cried

843
00:56:38,097 --> 00:56:41,209
because they looked like...

844
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:46,558
I cried because they
looked like angels

845
00:56:48,597 --> 00:56:52,877
and I just couldn't
understand how someone could

846
00:56:52,902 --> 00:56:56,393
I mean, to not even bury them they,

847
00:56:56,418 --> 00:56:59,402
They look like angels.

848
00:56:59,427 --> 00:57:05,182
And all I could think was
that she was there every night

849
00:57:05,207 --> 00:57:07,572
for weeks,

850
00:57:07,597 --> 00:57:09,283
sleeping in that one
bedroom apartment

851
00:57:09,308 --> 00:57:11,584
next to,

852
00:57:11,609 --> 00:57:14,215
decomposing angels

853
00:57:15,105 --> 00:57:18,644
just living in that
smell, that stink.

854
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,238
Every day, living
with that stink.

855
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:27,600
And then I called the police.

856
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,375
- [Lawyer] No further
questions, your honor.

857
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:42,230
- You got a condom?
- No.

858
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:45,441
- Do you want me to go get it?
- No.

859
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,003
(soft crying)

860
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,972

go now to Shelly Lee

who's bringing us the
latest developments

868
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,602
from outside the
courthouse. Shelly?

869
01:00:24,627 --> 01:00:26,453
- There were still many
signs of grief today

870
01:00:26,478 --> 01:00:29,196
and then signs of relief
and also tears of joy

871
01:00:29,221 --> 01:00:31,352
as New Yorkers received
word that the Monster Mom

872
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:34,967
had been found guilty on four
counts of first degree murder.

873
01:00:34,992 --> 01:00:37,196
The jurors deliberated
for only an hour today--

874
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:39,735
- This mimosa is good.

875
01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:42,276
- A specialty.

876
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,583
- Yeah.

877
01:00:47,515 --> 01:00:50,524
- I see they let you keep
that suit from court.

878
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,211
- Yeah, I guess it was
the least they could do

879
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:56,141
since you're still
walking the streets

880
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,235
and I'm still living on them.

881
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,453
- Yeah, I guess.

882
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,900
- I never hated you
because of everything.

883
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,696
I thought I should,

884
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:19,203
but I didn't.

885
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:22,735
Not one bit.

886
01:01:27,195 --> 01:01:29,196
It was like I was,

887
01:01:31,415 --> 01:01:33,649
Like I was relieved, you know?

888
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:41,474
Like I was actually relieved.

889
01:01:41,993 --> 01:01:45,167
I couldn't take
care of her, right?

890
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:48,709
I mean, I loved her but I...

891
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:53,485
I hated her

892
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:57,016
because when I saw
her I saw everything

893
01:01:57,041 --> 01:02:01,360
that was good and bad
about me, who I was.

894
01:02:05,384 --> 01:02:08,850
I saw it all there
at the same time.

895
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:16,013
Everything that was wrong,
everything that I did wrong.

896
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:20,451
It was all there in her.

897
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:23,667
So when she...

898
01:02:27,506 --> 01:02:30,132
When she left me,

899
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:34,678
I feel so much better.

900
01:02:36,616 --> 01:02:39,934
So much better.

901
01:02:42,005 --> 01:02:44,593
So I hate myself.

902
01:02:46,123 --> 01:02:48,171
(bitter chuckling)

903
01:02:49,608 --> 01:02:55,163
I already hated myself, shit.

(soft crying)

905
01:03:13,475 --> 01:03:16,892
I hate myself even more.

906
01:03:22,194 --> 01:03:26,710
So I guess I'm like that
Monster Mom on TV, right?

907
01:03:28,983 --> 01:03:31,218
You think,

908
01:03:31,905 --> 01:03:34,178
you think I'm a
monster, don't you?

909
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:40,351
- Yeah

910
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,014
but I'm a monster too.

911
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,294
- No.

You're headed somewhere,

You don't even always
know that you're in motion

moving, you're growing.

Some places you get to on

where we're at somehow,

951
01:09:19,636 --> 01:09:23,071
anyhow, and we stay in
motion and we don't stop

952
01:09:23,096 --> 01:09:26,351

ourselves to more places,

clear, the journey may suck

to where we need to be,

where we should
be, it's our life.

961
01:10:07,994 --> 01:10:12,977
Our lives. It's everything we
are, everything we want to be,

It's stupid, it's
maddening, it's awful.

966

It's wonderful, it's a
tragedy, it's an epiphany.

967
01:10:25,226 --> 01:10:26,807
It's transcendent. It's ugly.
