you doing up there?

neat to install a fire pole.

Turns out I forgot the pole.

356

something to laugh about?

If you won the crown,

read her articles.

00:58:09,637 --> 00:58:12,137
but there are a
few telltale signs.

1221
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:15,574
If she raises an
eyebrow, she likes it.

- [applause]

1223
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,446

It's awful.

- KRESTON: Yuck!

1228
00:58:30,824 --> 00:58:34,826
- And if she scratches her head,
it's because she has eczema.

1229
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:39,331
- Careful, honey, it's heavy.

feast without a little toast?

00:59:10,898 --> 00:59:13,332
To the Downtown Broads.

an undercover journalist.

- What?

1249
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:38,890
- A journalist?

1250
00:59:38,892 --> 00:59:40,659
She makes journals.

trying to tell you earlier.

to scenes from my past and...

hopefully change my
perspective about Christmas?

where I found you.

1333
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,978
- Yes, Hannah.

for my third lunch, baby.

Those articles better be
proofread and on my desk

you take a break?

You know, go outside,
make some friends?

01:05:27,474 --> 01:05:28,974
Come on.

1353
01:05:28,976 --> 01:05:31,009
- But how was I supposed
to know any better?

1354
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:34,045
My parents abandoned me
on a goddamn stoop.

1355
01:05:34,047 --> 01:05:35,914
- It's because you didn't have
parents who accepted you that

1356
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:41,286
you grew up thinking that
you weren't worthy of love?

- Damn, you're good at this.

1358
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:45,223

pay me the big bucks.

So, traveling to
the past, uh-huh.

Speaking to your
younger self, ah-ha.

1363
01:05:56,069 --> 01:06:00,772
And resolving some
childhood trauma, okay.

01:06:00,774 --> 01:06:04,876
Comes out to...hm.

1365
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,778

- Oh.

1374
01:06:29,136 --> 01:06:31,369
- Oh, I seen this look before.

1375
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:33,338
Don't tell me you got
some unfinished business to...

1376
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,974
- I've got some unfinished
business to take care of.

1377
01:06:39,546 --> 01:06:41,012
- Excuse me?

1378
01:06:42,682 --> 01:06:45,417
Is this the Spirit of Christmas?

1379
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:48,286
- The ... no. Who are you?

1380
01:06:48,288 --> 01:06:51,823
- I'm...Madelyn?

1381
01:06:54,494 --> 01:06:55,427
Take me to the church.

Wait, wait! Don't!

01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:16,948
- Don't what?
- I don't know.

1388
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,783
I haven't thought
past that part.

1389

- What are you doing here?

1390
01:07:20,687 --> 01:07:23,655
Come to stab us
in the back again?

1391
01:07:23,657 --> 01:07:27,125
- Look, I came back because I
think we can still save the inn.

1392
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:31,863
What if I told you
there is a loophole?

1393
01:07:31,865 --> 01:07:34,299
Look, it says here on
page 46, article A7...

1394
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,901
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1395
01:07:36,903 --> 01:07:40,138
You mean to tell us that you
found this book right before

1396
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,941
the last challenge?
- Yeah.

1397
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,079
- Okay.
- Checks out, it makes sense.

1398
01:07:48,081 --> 01:07:52,250
- It says, "Any team competing
in the Winter Ball can only be

1399
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:55,053
disqualified on the
name of its leader."

1400
01:07:55,055 --> 01:07:56,554
Which means, yes, the Broads

1401
01:07:56,556 --> 01:07:59,057
were disqualified
under Maggie Zeen.

1402
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:02,861
But we can still compete
under Olivia St. LaPelle.

1403
01:08:02,863 --> 01:08:05,964
- Oh, right! Your real name.

1404
01:08:05,966 --> 01:08:07,966
- [grumbling]

1405
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:09,300
- You know what?

1406
01:08:11,705 --> 01:08:13,071
- She's climbing it.

1407
01:08:13,073 --> 01:08:15,406
- Why is she always
climbing up on everything?

1408
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:17,842
- I'm sorry I lied to you.

1409
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,711
But I didn't have
any friends growing up.

1410
01:08:19,713 --> 01:08:22,747
I didn't even have any family.

1411
01:08:22,749 --> 01:08:27,552
But what I realized over this
last week is that I found both.

1412
01:08:27,554 --> 01:08:31,689
And I am not gonna let a
Pulitzer Prize-worthy exposé

1413
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:34,192
get in the way of that.

1414
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:39,197
Because families, honey,
we stick together.

Hmph!

1420
01:08:56,816 --> 01:08:59,450

1421
01:08:59,452 --> 01:09:02,153
that I choose you, ladies.

1422
01:09:02,155 --> 01:09:04,322
And all I'm asking is
that you choose me too.

1423
01:09:09,429 --> 01:09:13,331
I understand.

1424
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:14,966
- Hey, Olivia?

1425
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:21,472
We can't compete with just four.
Come on.

1426
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:23,007
- Really?
- OTHERS: Yessss!

head and my belly bursted out of

I was nine months pregnant?

You better back up.

1561
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:22,410
I said, you better back up!

1562
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:25,079
'Cause I got me an appointment.

1563
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:26,213
I got an appointment with

1564
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:28,449
a sheikh who has
a penchant for what?

1565
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:32,653
Headwear! Headwear.

1566
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:35,656
He has a penchant for headwear.

1567
01:16:35,658 --> 01:16:37,992
And I'm not gonna
miss this meeting.

1568
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:39,660
Uh-uh. So Russ,

1569
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:42,530
you better back up,
because that right there?

1570
01:16:42,532 --> 01:16:44,231
- [helicopter blades whirring]

1571
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:46,600
- [gasping]

1572
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:50,604
- Honey, that's my ride.
Yoo-hoo!

1573
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:56,110
- Christ on a cracker, she's
going up the Christmas tree,

1574
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,778
Olivia. Do something!

1575
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,980
- Is she going to
jump from there?

1576
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,450
- [suspenseful music]

1577
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:08,122
- [grunting]

1578
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:09,857
- Come with me, Olivia!

1579
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:15,296
I'll give you that promotion
you've always dreamed of!

1580
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:16,397
- You mean...

1581
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:18,899
Executive Fashion
Ladyboss in Chief?

1582
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:20,067
- Better!

1583
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:24,972
Chief Executive Fashion
Ladyboss in Chief!

1584
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:25,906
- [gasps]

1585
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:28,642
- We have to save
"Gorge" Olivia!

1586
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,078
You and me, we're the same.

1587
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:35,149
We're...we're nobodies
without our careers.

1588
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,351
- I am nothing like you!

1589
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:39,453
- Are you so sure about that?

1590
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:43,624
Aren't you curious about my
pregnancy all those years ago?

1591
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:47,094
Who I was pregnant with?

1592
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:51,065
Your parents never abandoned
you on that stoop, Olivia.

1593
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:53,367
It was a lie!

1594
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:56,771
- What? No!
No, that can't be!

1595
01:17:56,773 --> 01:18:01,709
- I gave birth to you
on the steps of "Gorge"!

1596
01:18:01,711 --> 01:18:04,478
I knew if the magazine
found out I was a mother,

1597
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,515
I'd never get as far.

1598
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:12,920
So I did what I
had to do our family.

1599
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:14,488
- Our family?

1600
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,323
- [helicopter blades whirring]

1601
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:20,594
- You were never my mother!

- [ornament breaks]
- Ow! Bitch!

1603
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:27,234
I've always been your mother!

1604
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:28,669
- Aah!

1605
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:34,375
Well, a mother would not make
her daughter her assistant!

1606
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:35,843
Aah!
- [exclaiming]

1607
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:38,112
- You cheated on me with her?

1608
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:39,547
- Oh, don't you hit him!

1609
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:42,316
- You got my sister pregnant!

1610
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:44,585
- Your grandpa's
your father's dad?

1611
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:46,687
- And I'm taking the kids.

1612
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:49,457
- You ... my wife, didn't you?

1613
01:18:49,459 --> 01:18:51,559
- Only 'cause you ... mine!

1614
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:54,495
- I hate myself.
I hate myself.

1615
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:55,896
- Snap out of it!

1616
01:18:55,898 --> 01:19:00,100
- [slapping]

1617
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,403
- Give me that crown!
- OLIVIA: No! No!

1618
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,771
- Give it to me!

1619
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:05,940
- It doesn't matter
if you're my mother...

1620
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,942
'cause I found my real family.

1621
01:19:07,944 --> 01:19:11,879
And they are right down there!

1622

The crown is saved!

01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:27,528
- [cheers and applause]

1626
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:30,297
- You dumb bitch!

1627
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:32,800
We could've had it all,

1628
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:35,202
but you had to throw it away!

1629
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:37,171
You had to throw it away!

1630
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:42,276
Well, looks like that promotion
is going to Tristan after all!

1631
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:48,415
Goodbye, Olivia!

1635
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,659
Stop it.

1636
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:02,763
- What?
Did you Broads really think

1637
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:04,732
your little loophole would work?

1638
01:20:04,734 --> 01:20:08,168
Did you forget you missed,
like, 98% of this pageant?

1639
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,170
- We weren't here.
I didn't understand.

1640
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:11,505
Was there a schedule?

1641
01:20:11,507 --> 01:20:13,841
- That is true.

1642

wins the Winter Ball!

Now we'll never have enough
money to...to pay the loan!

1650
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:43,003
- Oh, it's okay.
We'll figure it out.

1651
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:47,374
- After saving the crown,
it's the least we can do.

Oh, oh, it's real!

1658

to keep throwing money.

01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:40,160
I got a little joke for you.

1670
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:45,366
We voted, and you are no longer
the leader of Kittenheel Court.

this Christmas thing before,

so I hope you like it.
- Thank you.

1682
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,682
- Should we open them together?

1683
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,584

1694
01:22:44,477 --> 01:22:47,277
I decided to embrace
who I truly am

1695
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:50,481
after confronting
so much of my past yesterday.

Thank you, Olivia,
for saving my town.

And one more thing.

1698
01:23:01,794 --> 01:23:04,628
- I came back last night
after getting into a horrific

1699
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:06,630
helicopter crash.

1700
01:23:06,632 --> 01:23:10,901
Turns out the Tuckahoe
curse is very real.

1701

- Me and my sister got to
talking

1702
01:23:13,706 --> 01:23:15,205
and spent the whole night

1703
01:23:15,207 --> 01:23:20,577
remembering what it was
like to be a family again.

1704
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:24,181
- And I thought about what you
said to me in that tree and I...

1705
01:23:24,183 --> 01:23:27,851
I realized that you
always admired me.

1706
01:23:27,853 --> 01:23:32,056
Turns out the appreciation I was
searching for all those years

1707
01:23:32,058 --> 01:23:35,626
was right outside
my office door.

1708
01:23:35,628 --> 01:23:38,095
And look, I...I may
not be good at it,

1709
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:41,131
and I...I have a lot of
time to make up for,

1710
01:23:41,133 --> 01:23:46,904
but I kind of sort of maybe,

1711
01:23:46,906 --> 01:23:50,407
maybe just ready to be a mom.

1712
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:53,110
If you'll have me, of course.

1713
01:23:54,513 --> 01:23:58,015
Call me...Mother?

1714
01:23:58,017 --> 01:23:59,416
- I don't know.

1715
01:23:59,418 --> 01:24:01,652
I think that's gonna
take a long time.

1716
01:24:01,654 --> 01:24:07,157
- Hm. I understand.

1717
01:24:07,159 --> 01:24:10,861
- But today...we're all family.

1718
01:24:10,863 --> 01:24:14,231

1719
01:24:14,233 --> 01:24:17,568
Oh, come on, sis!
Come on, sissy!

1720
01:24:22,675 --> 01:24:25,075
- Olivia, you were right.

1721
01:24:25,077 --> 01:24:27,077
What we have is real,

1722
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:30,647
even if you are Maggie...
or Olivia, or Olaggie,

1723
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:34,718
or Magivia,
or Tina, or Stephanie.

1724
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,220
- Oh, Russ!

1725
01:24:36,222 --> 01:24:41,191
- What I'm trying to say is...

1726
01:24:41,193 --> 01:24:43,927
Will you marry me?

1727
01:24:43,929 --> 01:24:46,330
- Russ...

1728
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:48,832
haven't we only known each
other for, like, four days?

1729
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:52,269
- [ding]
- Yeah, you're right.

1730
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:54,872
What am I doing?
- I don't know!

1731
01:24:54,874 --> 01:24:56,406
- Can you imagine
if you said yes?

1732
