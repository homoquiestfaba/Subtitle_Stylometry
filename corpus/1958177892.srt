[racing cars]

00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,013
ANNOUNCER: So it's the last
day of the Bonzer Rally

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,473
here in the Land Down Under.

5
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:03,269
And Archie Vainglorious is
still the driver to beat.

6
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,440
[energetic music]

7
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,614
Oh, come on.

8
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,907
ANNOUNCER: It looks like
Team Hot Spots race has just

9
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,034
been cut short.

10
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,581
[energetic music]

11
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,670
What did I tell you, folks?

12
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,422
Nobody's been able to
get close to Vainglorious

13
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,553
since the amazing Gnash
mysteriously stopped racing.

14
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,596
Thank you.

15
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,139
ANNOUNCER: So that's
one more rally cap

16
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:43,268
for Archie Vainglorious.

17
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,396
ZHI: Legend, champ.

18
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:50,567
One day, I'm going
to be the champ.

19
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,819
Rebel.

20
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,782

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,960
[bike bell]

22
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:10,338
Yeah!

23
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:13,717
Woo-hoo!

24
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,095
Yeah!

25
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:26,770
Once again, it's time for the
annual Slow Loris Day Festival

26
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,813
here in the--

27
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:28,440
ZHI: Yeah!

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,989
Coming through!

29
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,921
We have a new champion!

30
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,506
The crowd is going wild!

31
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,717
The crown is on its--

32
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,344
oh.

33
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,013
Weirdo.

34
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,686
How shameful for your granny.

35
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,191
That was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

36
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:13,984
Really?

37
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,612
Totally.

38
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,238
I really like your helmet.

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,114
Thanks.

40
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,991
I painted it myself.

41
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,492
It's a soup pot.

42
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,035
(WHISPERING) I know.

43
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,787
By the way, I'm Zhi.

44
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,080
Hi, I'm--

45
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:27,998
GRANNY BAI: Zhi-zhi.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,583
Uh-oh, hide me, please.

47
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,252
How many times do
I have to tell you?

48
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,922
You need to stop with your
foolish racing fantasies.

49
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,718
[speaking chinese]

50
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,636
Granny Bai, Granny Bai.

51
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,556
Uhm, nice meeting you.

52
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,602
GRANNY BAI: I swear he's
just a stubborn as you were.

53
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,647
Look at it, my best soup pot.

54
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:57,694
[speaking chinese]

55
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,154
I don't get it, mama.

56
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,992
Everyone thinks I'm a weirdo
when I'm just being me.

57
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,704
And Granny, she
doesn't get me at all.

58
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,373
She just makes me
practice Tai Chi.

59
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,168
Tai Chi is how we
learn to slow down

60
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,633
the world by allowing the breath
of life to flow through us.

61
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,804
[deep breathing]

62
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,185
Whoa.

63
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,729
And she makes me trim plants.

64
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,355
GRANNY BAI: The
tree just knows how

65
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,150
to grow, the leaves to bloom.

66
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,944
This is their [chinese].

67
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:44,201
The question you must answer
is, what is your [chinese]??

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,580
ZHI (VOICEOVER):
But I don't care

69
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:51,623
about that kind of stuff, mama.

70
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,918
I just want to race.

71
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,932
Mama, mama!

72
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,017
I got a slot in tonight's race.

73
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,938
And I know I can win this one.

74
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,816
Oh, hey, don't tell Granny, OK?

75
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,692
Who's racing?

76
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,610
I'm racing.

77
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:20,694
Who's racing?

78
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:21,653
I'm racing.

79
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,696
Who's racing?

80
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,697
This guy.

81
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,657
I am racing.

82
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,243
Whoa!

83
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:29,911
[sigh]

84
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,496
ANNOUNCER: And it
looks like it's

85
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,333
going to be a drag race into the
final stretch with Local Loris

86
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,670
VE on the move.

87
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,340
He finds his pocket.

88
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,636
And he takes the lead.

89
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:46,553
This is it.

90
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,554
I got this.

91
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,807
I totally got this.

92
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,186
Oh!

93
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,920
ANNOUNCER: Ooh, and with no
one to blame but himself,

94
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,090
that has got to sting.

95
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,806
GNASH: Hey, kid.

96
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,766
Why the cloudy face?

97
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,977
Oh, hey, Gnash.

98
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,437
I saw you out there tonight.

99
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,314
You looked pretty good.

100
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,983
I think you might need
to get your glasses fixed.

101
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,321
I learned long ago to
trust my gut, not my eyes.

102
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:46,949
Ooh.

103
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,540
Pretty good, right?

104
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,836
OK, how about this one?

105
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,134
Winners are always winning
even when they're losing.

106
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,013
Hmm, I-- I got to go.

107
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,184
[sad music]

108
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,547
Do we have to do this?

109
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:50,093
Yes, your [chinese]
is blocked again.

110
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,264
[deep breathing]

111
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,815
Hey, check it out.

112
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,652
Tai Chi with a beetle--

113
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:07,487
Tai Chitle.

114
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,586
[gasp]

115
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,837
Wow.

116
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,008
Tai Chitle is not a thing.

117
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,177
Off you go.

118
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,638
I'm begging your
pardon, Granny Bai.

119
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,306
I'm worried about you.

120
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,809
When will you find
your [chinese]??

121
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,268
How do you know I haven't?

122
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,064
Because [chinese] is
the path to harmony.

123
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,734
And this, this is
not harmonious.

124
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,986
What if that's because
I have a different path?

125
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,071
And this is it.

126
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,447
It's just a loop--

127
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,201
a never-ending loop of
humiliation and rejection.

128
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,579
What if this is my harmony?

129
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,372
It's not.

130
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,874
[explosion]

131
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,167
Whoa!

132
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,212
What is going on?

133
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,547
What the--

134
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,047
That's it.

135
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:09,923
That's it.

136
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,134
Down it goes.

137
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,316
Vainglorious Industries?

138
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,613
Like Archie Vainglorious?

139
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,030
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS (ON
PHONE): Congratulations.

140
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,449
Your lovely home has
been hand-selected

141
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,829
by me, Archie Vainglorious,
for temporary repossession

142
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,789
and extreme demolition.

143
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,915
Demolition?

144
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,001
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS (ON
PHONE): Yes, demolition.

145
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,712
Echo, diabolical laugh.

146
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,633
[evil laugh]

147
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,300
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS (ON
PHONE): Have a nice day.

148
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,011
How can they do this?

149
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,722
[crying]

150
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,347
No.

151
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,682
Don't cry, Granny.

152
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,268
This has to be some kind
of misunderstanding.

153
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,274
I'm going to go and try
to sort this out somehow.

154
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,930
Whoa!

155
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,057
ANNOUNCER: And Archie
Vainglorious has just

156
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,686
taken the Bonzer Rally Cup.

157
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:46,271
What the?

158
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:54,861
Whoa, that's a big toad.

159
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,740
[intense music]

160
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:03,747
Huh?

161
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,509
Right, who are you?

162
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,135
And who let you in?

163
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,012
Oh, hi.

164
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,138
My name's Zhi.

165
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,474
But usually, people call me Zhi.

166
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,852
I'm a-- I'm a huge fan.

167
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,687
Of course, you are.

168
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,940
[scream]

169
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:35,487
Congratulations, you met
me, Archie Vainglorious.

170
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:40,949
OK.

171
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:45,495
Thanks, but I actually
came for something else.

172
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,372
I'm from the Slow Loris Village.

173
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,916
And I want to talk
about my Granny's house.

174
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,168
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

175
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,088
I mean, what would a cane
toad and a legendary racer

176
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,966
like you even want with
the Slow Loris Village?

177
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,092
Nothing.

178
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,927
That's why I'm going
to plant and flood it.

179
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,055
Let me show you.

180
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:10,979
Muddy Meadows-- luxury, high-end
swamplands for the posh toad

181
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:11,563
set.

182
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,106
Muddy Meadows?

183
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,859
To test it better
than Funky Fields.

184
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,486
But it's the last Slow
Loris Village in China.

185
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,155
How can you even be
allowed to do this?

186
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,658
Quite easily, actually,
because who really

187
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,492
knows what a Slow Loris is?

188
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,538
Hey, now, if you were
pandas, forget about it.

189
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,414
But slow lorises?

190
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,833
Please, who even cares?

191
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:32,959
I do!

192
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,587
OK, OK, no need to get
your nickels in a twist.

193
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,550
You and your Granny still
have 10 days to pay.

194
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:40,926
10 days?

195
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,554
We can't raise this
much money in 10 days.

196
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,013
Well, in that case--

197
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,017
[yelp]

198
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:49,976
Huh?

199
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:50,351
Hold on.

200
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,144
Hold on.

201
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,228
Hey, hey, wait.

202
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,567
Oh, coming soon.

203
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:01,655
Ah The Silk Road Rally,
Kashgar to Shanghai.

204
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,990
Oh, it's going to be epic.

205
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,159
It's a little
presumptuous, isn't it?

206
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,578
Building a trophy case?

207
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,621
I mean, you haven't
even won yet.

208
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,789
But I will.

209
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,084
Let me break it down
for you, fellow.

210
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,086
Daddy, grandaddy,
my imbecile brothers

211
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,588
helped me join in
on the business.

212
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,130
Help us bump the numbers.

213
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:19,965
Real estate is boring.

214
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,382
It's really quite a blunder.

215
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,635
So they bring the coins
while I bring the thunder.

216
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,803
The fastest car, I got it.

217
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,304
Your village, I bought it.

218
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,348
It makes my daddy proud to
have our name and all on it.

219
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,809
Rally after rally, knocking
trophies down like pins.

220
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,063
Plain and simple, loris,
Vainglorious wins.

221
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,695
The album drops next year.

222
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,490
You seem pretty confident
you're going to win.

223
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,033
Willing to stake a bet on it?

224
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,493
What do you have in mind?

225
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,620
If I win the cup--

226
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:50,495
Wait!

227
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,830
You?

228
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,540
You are the one who
is personally going

229
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,834
to be doing the beating of me?

230
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,418
I laugh at the idea.

231
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,170
[laugh]

232
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,091
[laughter]

233
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,762
I know it's crazy.

234
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:07,679
Sorry, little champ.

235
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,055
You were saying?

236
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,100
If I win, you give me
the deed to Granny's house

237
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,560
free and clear.

238
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,396
Such hutzpah, I love it!

239
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,064
I accept your bet.

240
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:23,987
But if I win, you become
the face of Muddy Meadows.

241
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:24,738
Me?

242
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,031
But I'm not a toad.

243
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:30,869
No, but you are
toad-ally adorable.

244
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:35,415
See you at the starting
line, slow loris.

245
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,293
Slow loris.

246
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,337
Super nice guy.

247
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,509
I look forward to
annihilating him.

248
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:55,561
Why the long face, kid?

249
00:14:55,563 --> 00:15:04,360
I kind of have to sort of race
the Silk Road Rally and win it.

250
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,780
The Silk Road Rally?

251
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:10,325
Oh, that the race
is no holds barred.

252
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:14,079
200 miles per hour
for four days straight

253
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:18,834
across unforgiving terrain
against the craziest drivers

254
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:19,837
in the world.

255
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,967
Yeah, so why would you
want to get mixed up

256
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,052
in the kamikaze
mission like that?

257
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,512
Because it's
the only shot I've

258
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:34,850
got as saving our house
from becoming Muddy Meadows.

259
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,226
I don't follow.

260
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,520
If I don't win that
cup, Vainglorious Industry

261
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,480
is going to tear down our house.

262
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,065
Vainglorious?

263
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,568
As in Archie Vainglorious?

264
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,944
I know!

265
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,363
How am I going to beat the
best racer in the world?

266
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,115
[scoff]

267
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,161
[sigh] I'm in way
over my head, Gnash.

268
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,414
Our home is all we have.

269
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,460
It's my mom's final
resting place.

270
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,631
Hmm.

271
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,676
All right, kid, come with me.

272
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,470
Whoa!

273
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,266
This place is awesome.

274
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,779
You were a race car driver?

275
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:31,322
I've been lots of things.

276
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,324
So this is how I see it, kid.

277
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,285
You are like this part.

278
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:39,289
You got everything you need,
but it's just a tangled up mess.

279
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,166
It can't do you any good.

280
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:50,884
But you and me
together, looking good.

281
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,512
Nice, looking real good.

282
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,140
Together, there ain't
nothing we can't do.

283
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,227
[engine starts]

284
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,728
Together like me and you?

285
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,815
Yeah, I've probably seen
every one of your crisis--

286
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:05,857
I mean, races.

287
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,192
You have?

288
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,569
You've got raw talent.

289
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:12,155
And you've got guts, but
you're missing something.

290
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,615
I can help you find it.

291
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,910
But only if you're
willing to listen.

292
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,244
No questions asked.

293
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,705
You would do that?

294
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:20,956
But why?

295
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,749
OK, that was two questions
right off the line there.

296
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:27,588
What part of no questions
asked did you not understand?

297
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,758
Hey, the heart of a champion
beats in all of us, kid.

298
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,511
See you tomorrow.

299
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,352
That apple really didn't fall
far from the tree, did it?

300
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:54,948
I know.

301
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,449
I know.

302
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:01,496
I said I was walking away
for good, but he's your son.

303
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,166
What am I supposed to do?

304
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,212
Birds got to fly.

305
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,756
Fishes got to swim.

306
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:15,220
And the goat-- well, a
goat has got to race.

307
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:27,939
So Zhi-zhi, how did
it go with Vainglorious?

308
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,066
Yeah, good.

309
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,109
Very good.

310
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,360
Yeah, I have it under control.

311
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,405
Just leave it-- leave it at me.

312
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:38,742
I just have to go
away for a while.

313
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,035
Go away?

314
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,912
Where?

315
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:51,963
To How to Defeat an
Evil Cane Toad TedTalk?

316
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,214
I got to go.

317
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,342
See you later, Granny.

318
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:01,515
You do know that when he lies
to me, his left eye twitches.

319
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,392
Exactly the same way yours did.

320
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:08,063
[chuckle]

321
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,105
OK, kid.

322
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,482
Let's talk about your last race.

323
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:16,112
It was yours to win, but then--

324
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,072
Ugh.

325
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,489
So what happened?

326
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,700
Do you see that guy's car?

327
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:21,367
If I had a car like that--

328
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,077
[horn sound]

329
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:22,994
What the?

330
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,329
Cars don't win races.

331
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,583
Drivers do.

332
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:31,294
Although, yeah, we actually
are going to need a car.

333
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,172
What?

334
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,758
Appearance is an illusion.

335
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,386
It's what's inside that counts.

336
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,015
[cake, "the distance"]

337
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,518
Reluctantly crouched
at the starting line.

338
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,270
Engines pumping and
thumping in time.

339
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,564
The green light flashes.

340
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,898
The flames go up.

341
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,442
Churning and burning,
they yearn for the cup.

342
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,487
They deftly maneuver
and muscle for rank.

343
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:00,031
Fuel burning fast
on an empty tank.

344
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,576
Reckless and wild, they
pour through the turns.

345
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,911
Their prowess is potent
and secretly stern.

346
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,956
As they speed through the
finish, the flags go down.

347
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:08,790
The fans get up.

348
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,542
And they get out of town.

349
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,585
The sun has gone down.

350
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,419
And the moon has gone up.

351
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,547
A long ago, somebody
left with the cup.

352
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,133
But he's driving and striving
and hugging the turns

353
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,175
and thinking of someone--

354
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,220
OK, let's see what you got.

355
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,179
[cake, "the distance]

356
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,181
He's going the distance.

357
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:28,184
He's going for speed.

358
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,561
She's all alone.

359
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,773
All alone.

360
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,067
It's just like
in his last race.

361
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:40,155
The moment he takes
the lead, he chokes.

362
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:44,537
The key to winning is focusing
on the road ahead of you.

363
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,957
[screaming]

364
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,627
GNASH: Also, not crashing
into walls is good.

365
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:01,261
He always gets nervous
when he's ahead.

366
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,181
ZHI: Oh, oh, oh.

367
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:06,809
Whoa!

368
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:13,522
Maybe if I hold him back--

369
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:14,191
that's it!

370
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:18,987
Not yet.

371
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:23,784
Not yet.

372
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:27,621
Now.

373
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:35,671
That was awesome!

374
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,467
Go, Gnash.

375
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,135
Yeah.

376
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,097
Yeah, I like it.

377
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,225
Pathetic.

378
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:51,604
Moronic.

379
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,397
Beyond ridiculous.

380
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,984
Oh, this is too easy.

381
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,193
Seahorses?

382
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,654
Seriously?

383
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,155
Hold the line.

384
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,241
Who's this?

385
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,451
The Amazing Gnash?

386
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,953
Right.

387
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:13,083
Well, you're not nearly as
dead as I thought you were.

388
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:20,171
Hmm, this is quite the wrinkle.

389
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:25,971
If you're in the
race, I could lose.

390
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:29,681
It's V.

391
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:30,974
What do you want?

392
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:34,310
I'm ready for you to
repay me that favor.

393
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:39,691
Neil will be in touch
with further instructions.

394
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,737
[laugh]

395
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,825
[chatter]

396
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,163
[evil laughter]

397
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,423
[upbeat music]

398
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,940
ABBY JACKS: Welcome race
fans to the Silk Road Rally.

399
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,357
I am Abby Jacks.

400
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,319
And with me, at the repeated
request of my husband,

401
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:28,615
is my sister-in-law,
Juni Hakansdotter.

402
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,953
Hey, that's me.

403
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:44,339
ABBY JACKS: And hailing from
India, India's team, Tandem.

404
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,008
I wonder how they
put their pants on.

405
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,054
And there they are,
the British Invasion.

406
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:54,766
And straight out of South
Central, China, Bling

407
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:55,559
and Bling.

408
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,521
[crowd cheering]

409
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,313
ANNOUNCER: Good
morning race fans

410
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:04,568
and welcome to the main event.

411
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,861
Ha-ha!

412
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:06,737
[music playing]

413
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:09,906
Who let the frog out?

414
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,909
I got him.

415
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,495
Who let the frog out?

416
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,454
Who let the frog out?

417
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,039
ABBY JACKS: And,
of course, no race

418
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,583
would be complete
without an entry

419
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:23,128
from Britain's notorious,
Team Vainglorious.

420
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,922
Oh, he looks slimy.

421
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:26,882
Come on, kid.

422
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:30,260
Let's get out of here.

423
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,011
Hey.

424
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,929
[speaking italian]

425
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,431
I'm just so excited.

426
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,433
By Vainglorious?

427
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,019
No, by this.

428
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:42,272
I'm due in less than two weeks.

429
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:42,939
Wait.

430
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:43,815
What?

431
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,567
I'm pregnant.

432
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,987
Oh, man, we are
such a miracles, eh?

433
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,782
Oh, I'm Berpe,
Team Wet Lightning.

434
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:53,992
Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

435
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,493
I'm Zhi.

436
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,996
Berpe, would you get your
sweet little tail over here?

437
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,040
Race is about to start.

438
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,000
That's my Adalina.

439
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,171
[italian], good luck out there.

440
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:12,553
ABBY JACKS: Long before the
internet connected the world,

441
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:15,096
there was the
legendary Silk Road.

442
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,140
A road that's made of silk?

443
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,017
I can't believe this.

444
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,561
No, it's not made of--

445
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:21,853
forget it.

446
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,815
The course is a 4,000 clickhorse
straight across China.

447
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:28,443
The race will take place in
four legs over four days.

448
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:32,155
And the race with the shortest
overall time takes the cup.

449
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,577
Other than that,
there are no rules.

450
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,730
And as the race is
wide at the line,

451
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,940
they're all thinking
the same thing.

452
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,233
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER:
Did I remember

453
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,151
to put on my
fireproof underpants?

454
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,988
ABBY JACKS: No, just
for one brief moment,

455
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,242
it's still anyone's cup.

456
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,003
Remember Vainglorious
drives dirty.

457
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,171
And he doesn't waste any time.

458
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:31,297
Trust me.

459
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,216
Are you ready, Zhi?

460
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:33,844
Ready?

461
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,681
All right, fellas.

462
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:40,267
Let's go.

463
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:47,564
ABBY JACKS: Vainglorious
wastes no time

464
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:48,857
trying to clear the field.

465
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:49,232
Look out!

466
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:49,818
Ah!

467
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,869
[explosion]

468
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,245
You weren't kidding.

469
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,705
That toad is crazy.

470
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,917
You said you wanted to
race the Silk Road Rally.

471
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,920
Welcome to it.

472
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:12,088
ABBY JACKS: And the races
begin to make their way

473
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,716
across the Taklamakan Desert.

474
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,718
You're supposed to
be out of the race.

475
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,763
Supposed to be.

476
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:21,890
Ah!

477
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:22,432
Get it off!

478
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,183
Get it off!

479
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:24,935
Ah, new idea.

480
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:25,896
Echoes, attack.

481
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:50,502
ABBY JACKS: And here comes
Argentina's Team Kale

482
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:53,632
driving a car with no
steering wheel at all.

483
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:57,010
Ah!

484
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,231
ABBY JACKS: Holy
molly, newbie team

485
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:14,651
Muddy Meadows just took
the lead from Vainglorious.

486
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,987
Enjoy the moment, loris.

487
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,615
It will not last.

488
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:20,866
Diabolical laugh.

489
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,578
[evil laugh]

490
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,160
[music playing]

491
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:24,747
Oh, yeah!

492
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,460
I can't get him off my tail.

493
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:36,339
All right, kid.

494
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,091
It's all about focus now.

495
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,593
Enter the zone.

496
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:40,844
No distraction.

497
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:41,970
OK, I get it.

498
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,471
Hey, is that a loris?

499
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,390
I'm pretty sure it's
a loris right there.

500
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:46,266
Gee, focus.

501
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:46,852
Whoa!

502
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,312
Whoa!

503
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:52,105
You're right.

504
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:52,981
That is a loris.

505
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:53,815
We should stop.

506
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:54,650
What?

507
00:28:54,652 --> 00:28:56,026
I was to say we just-- stop!

508
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:58,194
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS:
Total loser!

509
00:28:58,196 --> 00:28:59,320
ABBY JACKS: Unbelievable!

510
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:02,783
The lead car just
chucked to U-ey.

511
00:29:02,785 --> 00:29:04,409
What are you doing?

512
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,661
No questions asked.

513
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:07,078
You agreed.

514
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,580
Gnash!

515
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:10,081
Oh, come on, Gnash.

516
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,043
Get back here.

517
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:16,004
Hmm?

518
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:17,005
What--

519
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,214
Hey, Neil.

520
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:19,716
It's been a long time.

521
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:23,637
Well, if it isn't
the Average Gnash.

522
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,013
Seriously?

523
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,850
15 years, that's the best
you could come up with?

524
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,357
Hey, you OK over here?

525
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,569
Yeah, I'm fine.

526
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:39,736
Whoa!

527
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:44,575
Wow, this is heavier
than it looks.

528
00:29:44,577 --> 00:29:47,202
Whoa, you're a loris.

529
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:47,788
Uh.

530
00:29:55,128 --> 00:30:00,048
So you got a name or--

531
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,800
Uh.

532
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,720
What if I just
call you Speedy?

533
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:07,556
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

534
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:08,765
Uh, uh-huh.

535
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,267
A racer and a great
conversationalist--

536
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,187
my lucky day.

537
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,607
Gnash, you all right?

538
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:17,816
Never better.

539
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,067
Hey, you dropped this.

540
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,944
Huh?

541
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,821
Well, that was fun.

542
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,322
I don't think that
tiger is going

543
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,907
to give you any more grief.

544
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,784
You'd be surprised.

545
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:29,160
Thanks for stopping guys.

546
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:32,455
And maybe I'll see you
around sometimes, Speedy.

547
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:33,582
Uh.

548
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:34,708
Aw.

549
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,667
Sorry to break
up the fun, kids.

550
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:36,877
Gnash, don't--

551
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,629
But we have to get
back to our race.

552
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:39,713
Bye.

553
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:43,091
Nice meeting you.

554
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:47,012
Penny for your
thoughts, Speedy?

555
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:47,804
Huh?

556
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,515
Oh, it's nothing.

557
00:30:49,517 --> 00:30:50,100
All good.

558
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:03,904
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS (ON PHONE):
Oh, there you are, Shelby.

559
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,614
I'm dying to hear.

560
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:07,073
Give me the deets.

561
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:09,785
Why didn't you tell me
that your mark was a loris?

562
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:11,745
What a scintillating question.

563
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:13,622
Let me have a think on that.

564
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:14,998
I don't know.

565
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,376
Maybe because you work me.

566
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:19,628
So what happened?

567
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,046
Let's just say
your pet kitty is

568
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,423
going to have quite the
headache when he wakes up.

569
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,675
Sorry, I don't follow.

570
00:31:24,677 --> 00:31:27,095
Your tiger couldn't
handle the goat.

571
00:31:29,682 --> 00:31:31,850
[scream]

572
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:37,270
ABBY JACKS: Vainglorious will be
the first to throw his name up

573
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,438
on the leaderboard.

574
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,481
But with three more
days of racing ahead,

575
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,483
this race is far from over.

576
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:45,737
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER: Wait, so
this race is actually four days.

577
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:47,488
You cost us the race.

578
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,452
Races aren't won or lost
until the final second.

579
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:55,831
We were ahead.

580
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,292
Why would you make a stop?

581
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:10,554
Feel with your gut,
not with your eyes.

582
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,639
That's not what I sound like.

583
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:14,683
Let's do a whole
training montage.

584
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:18,144
But then, let's make it
totally irrelevant by stopping

585
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,646
and blowing our time.

586
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:22,065
ABBY JACKS: I don't know
where this kid has come from,

587
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:24,025
but he's clearly come to win.

588
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,736
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER:
Oh, I know this one.

589
00:32:25,738 --> 00:32:27,613
He came from China.

590
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:28,240
Oh my.

591
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:36,913
Sixth place--
super impressive--

592
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,915
on opposite.

593
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,125
Sixth place?

594
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:41,627
You did great, kid.

595
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:43,169
I was in the lead.

596
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,255
Which is when
you always lose it.

597
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:49,344
But when you're behind, kid,
you're a force of nature.

598
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:56,307
Zhi, how could
you not have told me

599
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,934
that you are such a driver?

600
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,435
Fantastico!

601
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,021
Fantastico?

602
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,023
Anyone else would
have come in last

603
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:05,150
after stopping
like you did today.

604
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:09,696
But then, oh,
watching you drive,

605
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:12,450
it's like a poetry in motion.

606
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,663
I need a snack.

607
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:20,456
I don't know, maybe a pint of
ice cream and some seaweed pad

608
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,043
thai.

609
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:44,230
I know why he's
doing it, but I'm still

610
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:47,736
terrified every time he
walks out of that gate.

611
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,784
Watch over him up there, OK?

612
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,080
For both of us.

613
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:02,125
[knocking]

614
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,670
Who could that be at this hour?

615
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:15,637
Oh my dears, come in, come in.

616
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,473
Oh, thank you.

617
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,863
[party music]

618
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:36,282
What the?

619
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,159
That was seriously me?

620
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,410
How did I--

621
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:40,829
SHELBY: Not a big
fan of parties, huh?

622
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:42,623
Who said that?

623
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:43,206
Hey!

624
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,791
You, wait up.

625
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:47,168
Hey, where did you go?

626
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,671
Oh, hey.

627
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:50,881
Hey, hi.

628
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:53,884
It's-- it's you.

629
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:57,137
Oh, I see you've been working
on your conversation skills.

630
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,847
Ha!

631
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:03,894
my conversation skills, because
that's what you said last time.

632
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,229
So sixth place, huh, Speedy?

633
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:07,773
It could be worse.

634
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:09,065
Hmm.

635
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,651
Oh, I get it.

636
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:12,443
You're one of those
all-or-nothing racers.

637
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,487
And it's just all
about the trophy.

638
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,406
I wouldn't say that exactly.

639
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:19,159
OK, so you're more of
the fame and glory type.

640
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:22,203
I don't think
that's it either.

641
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,664
Then what are you?

642
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,916
Well, I'm really only
here for my Granny.

643
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:30,170
I'm trying to save our home
from this psychotic toad.

644
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,713
Save your home?

645
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:32,422
Yeah.

646
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:33,924
And not just my home.

647
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,259
He's actually planning on
destroying the entire loris

648
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,260
village.

649
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:38,804
The entire loris village?

650
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:39,846
Yeah.

651
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,056
And it's going to
kill my Granny Bai.

652
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,432
I just know it.

653
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,017
Granny Bai?

654
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:44,976
Granny Bai!

655
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:45,769
Wait!

656
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,103
You're that Zhi?

657
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,438
I don't know.

658
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,982
I guess it depends which
Zhi you think I am.

659
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,484
From the park at the
Loris Day Festival.

660
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:57,488
When we were kids, you were
wearing a painted soup pot

661
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,489
on your head.

662
00:35:58,491 --> 00:35:59,825
That was you?

663
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:04,079
I looked for you a lot,
but I couldn't find you.

664
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:05,706
I never even knew your name.

665
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,499
I still don't know your name.

666
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,000
It's Shelby.

667
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,002
Shelby.

668
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:12,671
Why didn't I ever see you again?

669
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:16,758
We moved to the
city for my dad's job.

670
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,014
My last happy memories are
actually in that village.

671
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,518
What?

672
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,897
I just can't believe it's
really you after all this time.

673
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:32,107
I know.

674
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:35,068
This is-- this is crazy.

675
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,029
What are the chances?

676
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:43,036
No, go back.

677
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:49,249
What do you say we
take a walk, Speedy?

678
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:50,333
What's going on?

679
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:51,376
Nothing.

680
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,378
I just need to stretch my quads.

681
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,921
Stretch your quads?

682
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,800
[party music]

683
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,887
I bet he's over you.

684
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,682
I don't think he knows others.

685
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:22,323
Time for round 2.

686
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,994
[cracking knuckles]

687
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:25,996
Here, kitty, kitty.

688
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:35,923
Not smart.

689
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:46,139
And welcome, folks.

690
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,433
It's fight night at
the Happy Pagoda.

691
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,020
Oh, I'm loving the party.

692
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,278
SHELBY: So tell me something.

693
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,697
What happened to old Bing?

694
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:03,699
Did she ever actually
start bottling and selling

695
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:04,575
her own tea?

696
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:05,867
No.

697
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:07,243
But she's still claiming
that when she does,

698
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:08,286
she's going to be--

699
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:09,955
Deep in tea money.

700
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,456
[laugh]

701
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,874
Oh, what about
the Chu triplets?

702
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:14,000
Are they still there?

703
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,460
Yeah, they're
all still there--

704
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:16,753
I think.

705
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,338
I'm not really sure, actually.

706
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,923
It's kind of hard to tell.

707
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:27,764

00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,726
Hey, you think
you want to maybe--

709
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:32,561
I don't know.

710
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:36,189
Are you asking me
to dance, Speedy?

711
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,273
I mean I--

00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:39,027
[screaming]

Aw.

00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,868
The number you have dialed
is no longer in service.

Please check the
number and try again.

716

00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,291
Oh, OK.

00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:55,878
Bye.

00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,257
Whoa, that the--

720
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:03,509
Gnash, hold on!

Oh, boy.

00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:25,073
What is going on?

725
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:29,202
This is weird.

726
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,079
Wait a minute.

727
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,917
Is this what Granny was
always talking about?

728
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:43,757
Holy golly.

729
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:45,258
Did you see that?

730
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,303
I did not.

731
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,057
Oh, this is interesting.

732
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:03,445
Excuse me.

[crowd cheering]

734
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,840
Not bad, Speedy.

735
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:26,176
Not bad at all.

736
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:34,766
Well, good day, race fans.

737
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,184
It's Abby Jacks.

738
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,856
And welcome back to day
2 of the Silk Road Rally.

739
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:48,947
Oh, not necessary at all.

740
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,242
Well, obviously,
absolutely necessary.

741
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:55,203
They're not the
cheering for you.

742
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:57,205
Of course, they
are, horse of the sea

743
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:59,625
who is hardly a horse at all.

744
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:01,251
I don't think so.

745
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:04,295
They are cheering
for my best friend.

746
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:09,425
Videos of Zhi saving me and
by bambinos have gone viral.

747
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:10,594
Viral?

748
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:13,764
He doesn't even have a
social media coordinator.

750
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:21,312

751
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:21,688
Zhi!

752
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,648
Zhi!

753
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,443
I think you got some fans.

754
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:28,779
Zhi!

755
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:29,362
Zhi!

756
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:29,780
Zhi!

757

Zhi!

758
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:33,158
Zhi!

759
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Hey, slow loris.

760
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:37,370
Emphasis on the slow.

761
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:41,124
Care to engage in a classic
raising of the stakes?

762
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:42,417
What do you have in mind?

763
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:44,961
If you win, not
only will I give you

764
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,505
the deed to your
house, I'll give you

765
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:50,008
the deed to the
whole loris village.

766
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,217
What's the catch?

767
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:56,472
If you lose, you
become my echo.

768
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:57,059
Hmm?

769
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:03,481
Deal.

770
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:08,026
Aw!

771
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:10,113
Hand buzzer-- classic.

Zhi!

00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:30,757
Zhi!

[upbeat music]

779
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,694
What?

[a-ha, "take on me"]

781
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:21,474
We're talking away.

782
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:24,144
I don't know what I'm to say.

783
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:26,563
I'll say it anyway.

784
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:33,194
Today is another day to
find you shying away.

785
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:36,156
Oh, I'll be coming
for your love, OK?

786
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:39,743
Take on me.

787
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:41,161
Take on me.

788
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:45,749
Take me on.

789
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,543
Take on me.

790
00:43:47,545 --> 00:43:54,301
I'll be gone in a day or two.

791
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:00,096
Take on me.

792
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:02,683
Take me on.

793
00:44:02,685 --> 00:44:04,685
Take on me.

794
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:07,272
I'll be gone.

795
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:15,821
See that tree?

796
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:16,822
Into that.

797
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:17,825
Into that!

798
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:25,080
Nice work.

799
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:26,164
Nice work.

800
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,999
I was talking to the tree.

801
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:31,837
Congrats, you're no
longer on my list.

802
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,296
You, you're fine.

803
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:34,590
You're fine.

804
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:38,051
(SINGING) Take on me.

805
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:39,344

Take me on.

807
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:43,807
Take me on.

808
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:45,517
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER:
Well, that was weird.

809
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,018
ABBY JACKS: Well,
you're not wrong.

810
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,354
Unless Zhi has a rope and
a trunkfull of tiny toads,

811
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:52,858
he might be in some
serious trouble.

812
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,443
Aha!

813
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:00,117
Hmm?

814
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:17,257
All right.

815
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:18,008
We did it, Gnash.

816
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,634
Way to go, kid.

817
00:45:18,636 --> 00:45:19,928
That was awesome.

818
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:24,931
There you go, little fella.

819
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:28,018
Little fella?

820
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,769
Come on, Gnash.

821
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,021
We can still take the leg.

822
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:31,980
Hey!

823
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:32,608
Mama mia.

824
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:39,197
Back up gently, gently.

825
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:47,453
[scream]

826
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:48,916
Oh, wait.

827
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:02,761
My bambini!

828
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:03,180
Zhi.

829
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:15,067
[screaming]

830
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:20,656
I got a job.

831
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:29,204
Oh, no.

832
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,997
My bambinos!

833
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:31,957
Berpe!

834
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,084
Gnash, don't
disconnect that hitch.

835
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,920
We're going to lose
a ton of time, kid.

836
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:38,129
I know.

837
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:40,924
But I entered a Silk Road
Rally to save a family.

838
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:43,596
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

839
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,265
Let's just make it quick, OK?

840
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:56,565
Do you think this will work?

841
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:59,150
Not a chance.

842
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:00,443
I've got you.

843
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:01,402
Punch it, kid.

844
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:02,405
Punch it, kid.

845
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:10,453
ABBY JACKS: Oh, this is
not looking good, folks.

846
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:14,374
The weight and pressure are
going to rip Zhi's car in two.

847
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:17,252
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER: Oh,
he'd love two cars.

848
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:17,961
Come on.

00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:19,131
Don't give out on me.

850
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,427
Come on.

851
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:27,470
Come on!

852
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:28,056
Oh, no!

853
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:32,601
Zhi did it!

854
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:33,395

856
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:47,743
It was super scary, guys.

857
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:55,832
Ooh, yes!

858
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,125
Berpe, Adalina!

859
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,169
I'm so glad you guys are safe.

00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:03,339
[speaking italian] Thank you
so much for saving my babies

861
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:04,758
and my Berpe.

862
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,802
I don't know what
I'd do without him.

864
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:12,933
ABBY JACKS: Well, this is truly
a remarkable moment, folks.

865
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:15,018
And one that I don't think
we'll forget in a hurry.

866
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,562
The moment went on unlikely.

867
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:20,732
Little loris named Zhi became
the face of this Silk Road

868

869
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:25,445
Look, Granny Bai, look!

870
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:26,487
It's Zhi!

871
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:28,615
He saved all the other racers.

872
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:32,160
ABBY JACKS (ON PHONE): New
face on the Silk Road Rally.

873
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:35,872
My goodness, look at
what your boy has done.

874
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:38,208
You must be so proud.

875
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,086
Oh, I am.

876
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:46,382
But I'm also so
ashamed of myself.

877
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:52,931
I wasn't ever really helping
him find his [chinese],, was I?

878
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:56,895
I was just trying to
force him to accept mine.

879
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:02,273
ABBY JACKS: So, folks, we
are at the end of day 2.

880
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:05,902
And what a spectacular
day of racing it has been.

881
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:08,488
Team Vainglorious nabbed
first place again.

882
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:09,698
No big surprise there.

883
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,200
But the big story of the
day is Team Muddy Meadows

884
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:15,286
who has shocked the world
by climbing into third place

885
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:17,080
after a harrowing rescue.

886
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:22,586
We are here with fan favorite
and hero of the day, Zhi.

887
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:25,171
So she we would be
remiss if we didn't

888
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:28,091
ask you the question that
is on everyone's mind.

889
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,468
If you hit yourself
and it hurts,

890
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:33,263
does that mean you're
strong or weak?

891
00:49:33,265 --> 00:49:34,264
No.

892
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:35,807
What were you thinking
when you stopped

893
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:37,726
in the middle of the race to
rescue all your competitors?

894
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:39,019
What was going
through your mind?

895
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:39,895
Talk us through it.

896
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:40,771
Honestly?

897
00:49:40,773 --> 00:49:41,938
I wasn't thinking.

898
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,815
My friends were in danger.

899
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:46,026
Besides, I still
have two more days.

900
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:47,485
Like seriously?

901
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:48,862
Two more?

902
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:51,615
Well, Zhi, you definitely came
off looking like a real winner

903
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:52,490
today.

904
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:53,867
Thanks.

905
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:57,746
It's like an old friend told me,
winners are always winning even

906
00:49:57,748 --> 00:49:58,624
when they're losing.

907
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:13,053

908
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:15,889
s When I say vain, you say--

909
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:18,975
When I say vain, you say--

910
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:19,893
Idiots!

911
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:20,852
Glorious!

912
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:22,521
Reply is glorious!

913
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:23,396
Idiots!

914
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:24,189
Glorious!

915
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,482
The reply is glorious!

916
00:50:26,484 --> 00:50:29,152
It's ironically hard to
get a good call or response

00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:31,738
game with echoes.

918
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,698
Ah!

919
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,364
Daddy!

920
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:35,241
Daddy!

921
00:50:35,243 --> 00:50:37,035
Good to see you, brothers.

922
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:38,537
Good to see you, brothers.

923
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:42,082
I'm so happy you can join
the festivities in honor of

924
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:44,793
and sponsored by me.

925
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:46,419
A brochure?

926
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:52,676
Archiebold you have risked our
family's business over a bet.

927
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:53,176
Bet?

928
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:54,928
What bet?

929
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,763
Oh, that guy.

930
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:58,348
Don't even, daddy.

931
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,602
He's in third place which is so
many places behind first place.

932
00:51:01,604 --> 00:51:04,145
You couldn't even count
him if you wanted to.

933
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:11,653
If you lose Muddy Meadows,
you lose everything.

934
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:12,821
Everything?

935
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:15,741
Please, daddy, I'm not
as moronic as my brothers.

936
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:16,407
No offense.

937
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:17,576
Well, some offense.

938
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:21,204
I've taken out an
insurance policy.

939
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:22,038
[phone rings]

940
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,456
It's V.

941
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:24,165
SHELBY (ON PHONE): You
don't have to say, It's V,

942
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:25,501
every time.

943
00:51:25,503 --> 00:51:26,793
Your name shows up on
my phone when you call.

944
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,211
It's how phones work.

945
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:29,045
Never mind.

946
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:30,506
What do you want?

947
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:32,674
Nearly striking out with
the goat so it's up to you.

948
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:34,718
You want me to
beat up the goat?

949
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,179
No, I want you to
find Zhi's weakness.

950
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:39,515
ABBY JACKS:
Greetings, dance fans.

951
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:42,225
And welcome to the
Nuorilang Falls Ball.

952
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:45,145
And what a beautiful
place to be.

953
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:47,274
[party music]

954
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:00,911
Hey.

955
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:01,703
[non-english speech]

956
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:02,412
You realize.

957
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:03,246
If you're tagged.

958
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:04,039
Tomorrow.

959
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:05,206
By 20 minutes.

960
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:06,082
You'll only be.

961
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:06,792
10 minutes.

962
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:07,918
From the go.

963
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,378
If you can pull that
off, mate, the next day,

964
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,758
you'd have a real
chance at the cap.

965
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,425
Too right.

966
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:16,426
Touch a nitro.

967
00:52:16,428 --> 00:52:17,427
I hope you seal the deal.

968
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:18,929
Yeah, that'd be great.

969
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:22,223
But nitro is a bit outside
our budget which is nothing.

970
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:26,436
[speaking chinese]

971
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,271
Whoa, seriously?

972
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:29,815
Thanks.

973
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:34,611
This could really help us
close that 29-minute gap, kid.

974
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:34,988
Kid?

975
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:53,171
So this is what a burgeoning
superstar does in his off time.

976
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:55,340
I'm no superstar.

977
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:57,886
Oh, then what are
you doing on my cup?

978
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,059
So last time I
saw you, I believe

979
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:10,230
you were asking me to dance.

980
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:11,231
Was I?

981
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:11,817
Whoa!

982
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:18,196
Looking good, kid.

983
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:18,947
OK.

984
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:20,743
[music playing]

985
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,002
OK, whoa, slow
down there, Speedy.

986
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,090
See?

987
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:38,383
Isn't that better?

988
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:38,969
Yeah.

989
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:48,476
I like the way you dance.

990
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:50,646
Then you should
probably thank my Granny.

991
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:53,356
She's the only person
I've ever danced with.

992
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,109
She taught me all my moves.

993
00:53:56,111 --> 00:54:00,071
Well, how do you like it
then dancing with someone else?

994
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:00,822
I like it.

995
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,157
A lot less elbow skin.

996
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:03,952
[laugh]

997
00:54:25,558 --> 00:54:26,890
I'm sorry.

998
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:28,099
I can't.

999
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,518
Not like this.

1000
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,520
But wait!

1001
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:33,229
Shelby!

1002
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:33,816
Hey.

1003
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,448
Something get
under your warts, V?

1004
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,075
Oh, there she is.

1005
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:48,119
Tell me what's the dirt
on my little friend?

1006
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:50,496
You told me you were
getting even with someone

1007
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:52,040
who double crossed you.

1008
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:53,917
You didn't say anything about
hurting an innocent loris

1009
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:56,086
and destroying my
childhood home.

1010
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:57,420
I'm out.

1011
00:54:57,422 --> 00:55:00,924
You came to me appealing to
my love of taking advantage

1012
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:02,759
of the helpless in
their times of need

1013
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:05,011
and, in detriment,
my evil whims,

1014
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:08,098
and asked me to have your
father's name cleared

1015
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,183
for a crime that I
clearly framed him

1016
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:14,813
for which I did for you and
which, of course, I can undo.

1017
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:19,651
Therefore, when I
say jump, you say--

1018
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:21,653
You say--

1019
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:23,404
How high?

1020
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:24,656
Right.

1021
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:27,826
And when I say side
vegetable, you say--

1022
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:29,410
Stewed carrots?

1023
00:55:29,412 --> 00:55:30,829
Ooh, nice one.

1024
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:31,830
And when I say--

1025
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:33,333
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

1026
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:38,421
Bop, bop, bop.

1027
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:49,681
What the-- Shelby
and the Vainglorious?

1028
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:52,976
Oh, no, this is going
to kill the kid.

1029
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:56,772
Well, don't let him find
out until the race is over.

1030
00:55:56,774 --> 00:56:01,109
And when I say dream
first date, you say--

1031
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:03,069
Moonlit dance
beside a waterfall

1032
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,989
with a sweet guy
who makes me laugh.

1033
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:09,036
I would have also
accepted putting on a show.

1034
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:14,873
Slimy!

1035
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,374
How did I don't see it before?

1036
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:19,210
It's so obvious.

1037
00:56:19,212 --> 00:56:20,378
See what?

1038
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,213
Perhaps if you're
standing where I'm standing

1039
00:56:22,215 --> 00:56:24,257
and I'm standing
where you're standing,

1040
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:26,593
you could see what
I clearly see.

1041
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:30,221
Go, stand where I was standing.

1042
00:56:30,223 --> 00:56:30,639
Hmm.

1043
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:31,932
Huh?

1044
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:34,685
What exactly am I
supposed to be seeing?

1045
00:56:34,687 --> 00:56:35,602
You're right.

1046
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:37,688
It is worse this way.

1047
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,231
Go back, go back, go back.

1048
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:41,107
Hmm?

1049
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:42,067
What?

1050
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:43,652
What you are
supposed to be saying

1051
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:47,823
is that you two silly lorises
are falling for each other.

1052
00:56:47,825 --> 00:56:50,826
You are the secret
weapon I've been

1053
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:52,327
looking for the whole time.

1054
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:54,663
So wouldn't it just
break his simple heart

1055
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:59,835
to learn that you've been
working for me all along?

1056
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:00,544
Pow!

1057
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:03,171
No.

ABBY JACKS: Welcome race fans to
day 3 of this Silk Road Rally.

1059
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:09,511
Today's course takes us right
through the Stone Forest.

1060
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,638
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER: A
forest made of stone?

1061
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,183
I can't believe this.

1062
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,272
Huh?

1063
00:57:21,274 --> 00:57:22,733
Oh, Zhi, great, there you are.

1064
00:57:22,735 --> 00:57:24,234
In the car, let's go.

1065
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:26,069
I got to hand
it to you, Gnash.

1066
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:28,488
You were totally right
making a stop for Shelby.

1067
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,114
She is--

1068
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:30,240
Dead weight, yeah.

1069
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:31,407
I don't know what
I was thinking.

1070
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:34,578
That's not what
I was going to say.

1071
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,495
[gasp]

1072
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:36,872
You seem a little jumpy.

1073
00:57:36,874 --> 00:57:37,539
Yes?

1074
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:38,164
What?

1075
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,207
What do you want?

1076
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:39,958
Here, let me get that for you.

1077
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,001
Gnash, what the?

1078
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:43,005
Oh, no, the window is broken.

1079
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,550
Shelby doesn't love you.

1080
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:50,511
She works for me.

1081
00:57:50,513 --> 00:57:51,512
What's he saying?

1082
00:57:51,514 --> 00:57:55,181
She does it long
view rehearse the flea?

1083
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:56,268
Cuckoo, am I right?

1085
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,106
Uh-oh.

00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:05,025
Hey, Gnash!

1087
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:06,484
What the heck?

1088
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:08,987
These screens are a
serious distraction.

1089
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:09,946
They destroy focus.

1090
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:11,990
You can't have that.

1091
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:13,241
You're welcome.

00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:49,402
Last night,
dancing with Shelby,

1097
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:51,530
it was like a dream come true.

1098
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,699
But one I never
even knew I wanted.

1099
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:54,741
Ah-ha.

1100
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:55,909
Well, look out.

1101
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:57,744
What if she never comes back?

1102
00:58:57,746 --> 00:58:59,705
How could I ever be
happy again knowing

1103
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:01,081
what life could have been?

1104
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:01,998
I couldn't, Gnash.

1105
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,543
I just couldn't.

1106
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:08,129
Then again, a winter
wedding would be so Shelby.

1107
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,297
But a summer wedding--

1108
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:10,757
Oh, enough already.

1109
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:13,594
You've been talking about
this girl for 1,000 miles.

1110
00:59:13,596 --> 00:59:16,137
You need to get your
head back in this race.

1111
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:18,223
How's this for
head in the race?

1112
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:20,892
Whoa, kid, that's
100% pure nitro.

1113
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:23,645
You will just--

1114
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:24,857
Holy moly.

1115
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,613
Zhi just took off like a roo
with a rocket in its rump.

1116
00:59:32,615 --> 00:59:34,533
[intense music]

1117
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:43,081
After I save
Granny's house, I think

1118
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,166
maybe I'll get a
place of my own,

1119
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:47,836
something worthy of
Shelby, you know.

1120
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:50,005
I'm thinking karaoke room.

1121
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,339
Oh, for the love of--

1122
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:53,133
Hey, seriously, what
is up with you today?

1123
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:53,717
Who?

1124
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:55,093
Me?

1125
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:57,262
You're the one that wants to
quit yammering on about Shelby

1126
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:58,847
when you should be racing.

1127
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:00,431
You're jealous.

1128
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:02,809
Oh, what in the world
would I be jealous of?

1129
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:07,397
Me because it's not the
amazing Gnash show this time.

1130
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:09,693
Oh, give me a
break, wouldn't you?

1131
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:15,238
ABBY JACKS: Team Muddy Meadows
have broken the land speed

1132
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,782
record.

1133
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:19,244
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER: Yeah, they're
definitely going to crash.

1134
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:22,412
Whoa, we're too hot.

1135
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:23,582
Lay off the nitro.

1136
01:00:29,547 --> 01:00:30,295
Come on!

1137
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:30,923
Whoa!

1138
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:47,979
Yes!

1139
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:49,357
Go, Zhi-zhi, go!

1140
01:00:51,694 --> 01:00:54,027
ABBY JACKS: Let's take
another look at that finish.

1141
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:54,780
Yes, Speedy!

1142
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,369
You could have killed us.

1143
01:01:03,371 --> 01:01:05,581
Nitro can't handle
that kind of heat.

1144
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:07,626
You can't handle
that kind of heat.

1145
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:13,839
Your pistons are misfiring, son.

1146
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:17,342
[growl]

1147
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,177
You are just like your mother.

1148
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:20,554
As soon as you
don't get your way,

1149
01:01:20,556 --> 01:01:22,723
you just fly off the handle.

1150
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:24,392
My mother?

1151
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:34,234
I taught her how to race.

1152
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:37,237
My mother raced cars?

1153
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:40,741
And she was great
too just like you.

1154
01:01:40,743 --> 01:01:44,077
But then this one rally,
we were racing as a team.

1155
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,914
And I signaled to her
to slow down and not

1156
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,834
take the easy pass,
but she couldn't

1157
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:54,796
resist so she blazed by me.

1158
01:01:54,798 --> 01:02:00,468
And-- and when she hit
that next turn, she--

1159
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,929
She what, Gnash?

1160
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:07,100
She-- she should
have listened to me.

1161
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:10,604
What happened, Gnash?

1162
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:12,149
I lost my best friend.

1163
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:20,032
[explosion]

1164
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,452
We could have been amazing.

1165
01:02:26,454 --> 01:02:27,495
Could have been amazing.

1166
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,583
[yelp]

1167
01:02:33,546 --> 01:02:35,003
Oh, yeah?

1168
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:38,551
If I had middle fingers,
you'd all know it right now.

1169
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:44,181
Hey, what's this?

1170
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,017
One, get out of here.

1171
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:49,518
Get away.

1172
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,226
Go on.

1173
01:02:50,228 --> 01:02:51,186
Shoo.

1174
01:02:51,188 --> 01:02:52,563
It's all mine--

1175
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:56,441
the trophy, Muddy Meadows,
totally conditional

1176
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:58,652
love of my family.

1177
01:02:58,654 --> 01:03:02,405
Echoes, cue the
victory simulation.

1178
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:04,577
[party music]

1179
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,832
ABBY JACKS: Well, that
was a dramatic end

1180
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:14,292
to a dramatic day, folks.

1181
01:03:14,294 --> 01:03:17,128
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER (ON PHONE):
He and Vainglorious somehow now

1182
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,547
both in first place.

1183
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:21,091
ABBY JACKS: And with his car and
his relationship with teammate

1184
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:24,636
Gnash both up in flames,
there's suddenly no way for Zhi

1185
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:28,264
to finish the rally,
let alone win it.

1186
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:29,602
He needs us.

1187
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:44,823
Hey, there she is.

1188
01:03:44,825 --> 01:03:45,866
There she is.

1189
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:47,826
Oh, what are you
so happy about?

1190
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:48,994
Haven't you heard?

1191
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:52,205
Zhi is out of the race.

1192
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:52,998
We did it!

1193
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,502
You and me, the two amigos.

1194
01:03:56,504 --> 01:03:57,794
I don't want this.

1195
01:03:57,796 --> 01:03:59,295
Oh, don't be shy.

1196
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:02,090
Take a pic.

1197
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:02,676
Shelby?

1198
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:07,095
Zhi, what are you--

1199
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:10,557
what are you-- what are you--
what are you doing here?

1200
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,601
I came to make a trade--

1201
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:14,936
me for the village.

1202
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:16,938
How noble of you.

1203
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:22,569
But seeing as your leverage
just blew up-- what?

1204
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:24,112
Five minutes ago?

1205
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:27,032
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you didn't hear about that yet.

1206
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:31,246
I think I'll just take
you and the village.

1207
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:37,125
Echo Training Program?

1208
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:38,835
Benefits?

1209
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:39,836
Wait a second.

1210
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:41,755
Why are you here, Shelby?

1211
01:04:41,757 --> 01:04:44,049
What-- what's going on?

1212
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:47,468
Well, OK-- so this
is a crazy story.

1213
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,429
You'll think this is funny.

1214
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:53,101
The thing is-- well the--

1215
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:58,980
Oh, enough with
the dramatic pauses.

1216
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:01,942
The lady loris works for me.

1217
01:05:01,944 --> 01:05:02,818
No, no, wait.

1218
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:03,819
It's not like that.

1219
01:05:03,821 --> 01:05:06,321
I hired her to destroy you.

1220
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:07,157
How did she do?

1221
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:15,330
She killed it.

1222
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:15,958
Speedy.

1223
01:05:19,377 --> 01:05:22,295
Well, that was awkward.

1224
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:24,840
[thunder]

1225
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,258
ABBY JACKS: Oh, what an
emotional roller coaster

1226
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,094
ride this has been for Zhi.

1227
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:32,889
And now, it looks like
everyone's favorite slow loris

1228
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:35,976
is in for a dark
night of the song.

1229
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:38,604
It feels like a
saxophone moment to me.

1230
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:40,566
[saxophone music]

1231
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,180
[cat scream]

1232
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:17,394
Zhi-zhi, where did
you find that car?

1233
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:30,488
Kid, you're a force of nature.

1234
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:34,450
That was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

1235
01:06:34,452 --> 01:06:37,205
When will you
find your [chinese]??

1236
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,580
GRANNY BAI: Going
somewhere, Gnash?

1237
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:22,499
Granny Bai, what
are you doing here?

1238
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:26,252
Making sure the past
doesn't repeat itself.

1239
01:07:26,254 --> 01:07:30,591
You need to help him finally
embrace his [chinese]..

1240
01:07:30,593 --> 01:07:34,385
I think you
should talk to Zhi.

1241
01:07:34,387 --> 01:07:37,180
You owe me this, Gnash.

1242
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:39,683
And you owe it to Zhi.

1243
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:44,855
But mostly, you
owe it to yourself.

1244
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:49,693
It wasn't your fault.

1245
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:52,487
It was nice to see
you again, Granny.

1246
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:55,657
You take care of yourself.

1247
01:07:55,659 --> 01:07:56,324
Aw!

1248
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:58,034
Aw, aw, aw, aw, aw.

1249
01:07:58,036 --> 01:08:00,161
Granny, let go.

1250
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:01,540
Oh, come on, Granny.

1251
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:09,337
Don't be an idiot.

1252
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:10,881
Well, that's a good one.

1253
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:13,967
Darn bumper stickers, why do
they have to be so persuasive?

1254
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:14,845
So persuasive.

1255
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:26,563
Next race to
start in one hour.

1256
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:26,940
What?

1257
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:48,879
The plant just
knows how to grow.

1258
01:08:53,175 --> 01:08:55,343
[deep breathing]

1259
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:09,230
Zhi!

1260
01:09:09,232 --> 01:09:10,106
Zhi!

1261
01:09:10,108 --> 01:09:11,817
Where have you been?

1262
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,361
Come on, it's Berpe.

1263
01:09:19,076 --> 01:09:20,033
Zhi!

1264
01:09:20,035 --> 01:09:21,702
Look at what my Berpe did.

1265
01:09:21,704 --> 01:09:24,955
It was awesome and
a little disgusting.

1266
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:28,792
I swear I have a whole
new respect for men.

1267
01:09:28,794 --> 01:09:31,878
Come and meet the
little tailbiters.

1268
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,339
They're so cute.

1269
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:35,799
Wow.

1270
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:37,050
Hi.

1271
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:38,343
They're beautiful.

1272
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:41,431
Everyone, say hi to Uncle Zhi.

1273
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:52,357
Look at him all tuckered out.

1274
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,234
I'm so proud of him.

1275
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:57,779
But doc says he's in no
condition to finish the rally.

1276
01:09:57,781 --> 01:10:00,907
Well, then, we can watch
the last leg together

1277
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:03,368
because I'm out too.

1278
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:04,410
No, Zhi.

1279
01:10:04,412 --> 01:10:06,872
This is where our road led us.

1280
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:09,833
But you, you need to
get back out there

1281
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:12,753
and find out where
your road goes.

1282
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:14,254
But even if I wanted to--

1283
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:16,590
BERPE: Zhi, we are a familia.

1284
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:20,260
I cannot sit here and let
you offer this a hook.

1285
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:21,803
No.

1286
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:25,599
Familia, we push each other
forward even when we think we

1287
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:30,521
can't possibly go on, especially
when we think we can't.

1288
01:10:30,523 --> 01:10:32,606
You can do this, Zhi.

1289
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:36,151
We believe in you.

1290
01:10:36,153 --> 01:10:38,030
[door opening]

1291
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,323
Shelby?

1292
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:44,450
I'm so sorry.

1293
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:46,912
Everything Vainglorious
said is true.

1294
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:48,664
When we met, I was
working for him

1295
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:50,415
but I didn't really
know what I was doing

1296
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:51,500
or who I was doing it to.

1297
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:53,376
And then-- and then we met.

1298
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:54,920
And we got along so well.

1299
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:58,173
And you-- you were the kid
with the soup pot on your head.

1300
01:10:58,175 --> 01:10:59,966
And then I realized
that you were fighting

1301
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:04,012
for the Loris Village which
meant that I was the one trying

1302
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:05,764
to destroy it.

1303
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,182
Shelby, I get it.

1304
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:08,349
You didn't know.

1305
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:09,851
No, but that
doesn't make it right.

1306
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:12,478
My whole life, I have been
trying to find my way back

1307
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,229
to the village.

1308
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:14,480
[crying]

1309
01:11:14,482 --> 01:11:17,818
SHELBY: And when you offered
it to me, I betrayed you.

1310
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,697
But I want to make it right
so that's what I'm doing here.

1311
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:26,409
I'm trying to do right by
the guy I'm sort of into.

1312
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:29,081
The guy you're sort of into?

1313
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:33,458
She loves me!

1314
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,585
Did you guys hear that?

1315
01:11:34,587 --> 01:11:37,462
She totally loves me.

1316
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:39,631
Whoa, slow down there, Speedy.

1317
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:42,634
We still got a race to finish.

1318
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:44,260
Shelby, I--

1319
01:11:44,262 --> 01:11:45,929
I blew up my car.

1320
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:48,264
There's no way for me
to finish the race.

1321
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:52,393
There's-- there's not going
to be a village to go back to.

1322
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:52,980
Unless--

1323
01:11:57,735 --> 01:11:59,484
Isn't this Neil's car?

1324
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:00,821
Not anymore.

1325
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:09,285
The starting line is
the other direction.

1326
01:12:09,287 --> 01:12:10,122
ZHI: Oh, I know.

1327
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:16,292
Hey, wait.

1328
01:12:16,294 --> 01:12:16,879
Gnash.

1329
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:22,508
GNASH: Zhi?

1330
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:23,509
Gnash?

1331
01:12:23,511 --> 01:12:24,970
What are you doing here, kid?

1332
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:30,015
I'm so sorry about
what I said, Gnash.

1333
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:33,852
You've been nothing but good
to me, and I blew it all up.

1334
01:12:33,854 --> 01:12:35,478
We blew it up.

1335
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,230
I'm sorry too, kid.

1336
01:12:37,232 --> 01:12:40,275
I should have told you
about your mama sooner.

1337
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:42,861
And then when the
road got rough,

1338
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:45,781
I just up and split
without so much as a glance

1339
01:12:45,783 --> 01:12:47,407
in the rearview.

1340
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:49,701
You know, truth is I would
have been on that bus

1341
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:51,995
there too if an old
friend hadn't stopped by

1342
01:12:51,997 --> 01:12:54,540
to drop some wisdom on me.

1343
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:57,083
An old friend?

1344
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:58,919
GRANNY BAI: Come
on now, you two.

1345
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:00,587
I'm not that old.

1346
01:13:00,589 --> 01:13:01,173
Granny!

1347
01:13:05,343 --> 01:13:06,927
I'm sorry, Zhi-zhi.

1348
01:13:06,929 --> 01:13:08,428
I never intended--

1349
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,387
It's OK, Granny.

1350
01:13:09,389 --> 01:13:10,015
It's OK.

1351
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:14,935
I'm so proud of you.

1352
01:13:14,937 --> 01:13:17,604
You're proud of me?

1353
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:19,397
Even though I'm racing?

1354
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:22,192
Because you're racing.

1355
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:25,445
You found your
[chinese],, Zhi-zhi.

1356
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,074
Now, go save our home.

1357
01:13:29,326 --> 01:13:31,492
GNASH: I hate to be the one
to break it to you guys,

1358
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:35,330
but I think it might be a
little too late for that.

1359
01:13:35,332 --> 01:13:36,540
Too late?

1360
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:40,126
But you're the one who said
races aren't won or lost

1361
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,462
until the final second.

1362
01:13:42,464 --> 01:13:43,254
Hmm?

1363
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:44,255
Yeah.

1364
01:13:44,257 --> 01:13:45,342
Again, that's not
what I sound like.

1365
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:50,721
ABBY JACKS: Well, race fans,
it's the last day of the rally.

1366
01:13:50,723 --> 01:13:54,224
And with Zhi out, the only
question on everyone's mind

1367
01:13:54,226 --> 01:13:55,391
is--

1368
01:13:55,393 --> 01:13:56,852
Why don't croissants
come in any other shapes?

1369
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:58,144
No, not that.

1370
01:13:58,146 --> 01:14:00,939
Can anyone else left
in this race actually

1371
01:14:00,941 --> 01:14:03,567
beat Archie Vainglorious?

1372
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:04,903
Of course not.

1373
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:08,530
Where's Zhi?

1374
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:09,823
[speaking chinese]

1375
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:12,408
Yeah, he's totes
going to miss the race.

1376
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:15,537
His village is going
to be destroyed.

1377
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:21,710
We've got to find a
way to buy him some time.

1378
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:23,754
Lovely idea, lads.

1379
01:14:23,756 --> 01:14:25,674
All right, you lot,
follow our lead.

1380
01:14:56,747 --> 01:14:57,746
Huh?

1381
01:14:57,748 --> 01:14:59,750
[cheering]

1382
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:05,589
Tucks away.

1383
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:12,680
Well, that's just a waste
of perfectly good people.

1384
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:22,187
Hey, what are you doing?

1385
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:24,105
ABBY JACKS: 7 minutes
in, and the other teams

1386
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:26,357
have a deadlock on Vainglorious.

1387
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:28,571
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER: Wow,
this map is really handy.

1388
01:15:34,993 --> 01:15:36,577
ABBY JACKS: Oh, we
are four hours now.

1389
01:15:36,579 --> 01:15:39,913
And these guys have no intention
of letting Vainglorious pass.

1390
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:41,206
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER: Well, hours?

1391
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:44,042
It was just 7 minutes
like 12 seconds ago.

1392
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:45,168
Oh, that's a lot of numbers.

1393
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:46,795
My head hurts.

1394
01:15:46,797 --> 01:15:49,715
[scream]

1395
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:51,925
[horn honks]

1396
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:54,177
ABBY JACKS: I don't know
what these guys are up to,

1397
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,848
but they're up to something.

1398
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:08,191
They're corralling him.

1399
01:16:08,193 --> 01:16:10,485
Five trapped Vainglorious.

1400
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:10,904
Oh.

1401
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,333
ABBY JACKS: And Vainglorious
has broken free.

1402
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:26,837
Who would've seen that coming?

1403
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:49,566
[explosion]

1404
01:16:49,568 --> 01:16:52,819
Well, folks, it seems like
it's a great day for evil

1405
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:56,489
everywhere as Archie
Vainglorious has just secured

1406
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:58,451
himself a certain victory.

1407
01:17:02,581 --> 01:17:03,580
Yey!

1408
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:04,956
ABBY JACKS: Hang on a second.

1409
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:05,918
What's this?

1410
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:10,962
Some fool has just
joined the race.

1411
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:13,173
Is that Neil?

1412
01:17:13,175 --> 01:17:14,508
Oh!

1413
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,259
ABBY JACKS: Oh, no way,
that's not some fool.

1414
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:21,431
It's Muddy Meadows,
the mini miracle!

1415
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:23,308
Mini miracle?

1416
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:25,521
Oh, that's a cool nickname.

1417
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:30,400
[energetic music]

1418
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:39,952
There it is, Shanghai!

1419
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:48,291
You got this, Speedy.

1420
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:52,128
ABBY JACKS: If there's ever been
a more exciting race for a cup,

1421
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:55,507
I, for one, cannot recall it.

1422
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:57,092
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER:
I've got to agree.

1423
01:17:57,094 --> 01:17:58,885
ABBY JACKS: That's because this
is the first race you've ever

1424
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,136
seen, Juni.

1425
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:01,890
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER: I've got
to agree with you again.

1426
01:18:05,102 --> 01:18:07,102
GNASH: Steady, steady.

1427
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:08,436
Ha-ha!

1428
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:09,771
As if, loris.

1429
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:11,356
As if.

1430
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:14,067
ZHI: I can't get past him.

1431
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:15,986
GNASH: Not yet.

1432
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:16,572
Not yet.

1433
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:20,075
Now!

1434
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:27,750
See you!

1435
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:34,045
GNASH: Yeah, way to go, kid.

1436
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:35,633
[laugh]

1437
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:41,887
SHELBY: Right, left, right?

1438
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:42,556
Hold on.

1439
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:48,521
SHELBY: Speedy!

1440
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:55,528
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS: Dang it!

1441
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:03,911
[crash]

1442
01:19:13,671 --> 01:19:14,795
SHELBY: Back up, back up!

1443
01:19:14,797 --> 01:19:16,254
You can get around
him and take it.

1444
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:17,463
Coming down, look out!

1445
01:19:17,465 --> 01:19:19,051
You're not going
to make it through!

1446
01:19:22,555 --> 01:19:23,469
Forward, Zhi!

1447
01:19:23,471 --> 01:19:24,932
Forward fast, forward!

1448
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:33,313
ABBY JACKS: Oh, Vainglorious
has pulled ahead yet again.

1449
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:36,652
And this time, it looks
like it's curtains for Zhi.

1450
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:39,611
What are we going to do?

1451
01:19:39,613 --> 01:19:40,612
Gnash?

1452
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:42,030
I'm sorry.

1453
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:44,199
I'm all out of bumper stickers.

1454
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:45,366
Speedy?

1455
01:19:45,368 --> 01:19:47,368
Hmm?

1456
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,582
[intense music]

1457
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:04,096
Go save our home.

1458
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:12,477
What exactly is going through
that giant head of yours right

1459
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:13,937
now, kid?

1460
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:18,108
Like you said, when I'm
behind, I'm a force of nature.

1461
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:19,987
[engine starts]

1462
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:24,030
ABBY JACKS: Oh, stiffen the
wombat and thump the lizard.

1463
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:27,325
The mini miracle is headed
straight into a colossal death

1464
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:28,744
spiral.

1465
01:20:28,746 --> 01:20:30,163
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER: It sounds
like a very stupid idea.

[deep breath]

1467
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:48,306
SHELBY: This is crazy.

1468
01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:26,303
We're close to
the finish line.

1469
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:31,224
No!

1470
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:41,650
ABBY JACKS: Well, vanquish me
Vegemite and call me a koala.

1471
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:43,318
You are a koala.

1472
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,738
ABBY JACKS: The mini miracle
has just won the first

1473
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:49,825

01:21:58,794 --> 01:21:59,377
Hey.

1477
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:04,548
I'm his friend!

1478
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:05,175
Go, Zhi!

1479

[crowd roars]

1480
01:22:31,243 --> 01:22:33,451
Zhi, can I have
your autograph please?

1481
01:22:33,453 --> 01:22:35,871
That was great.

1482
01:22:35,873 --> 01:22:37,413
Hey, you did it.

1483
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:39,625
What's up, Zhi?

1484
01:22:39,627 --> 01:22:43,296
Hey, it's supposed to
say the Amazing Gnash.

1485
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,924
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS: Fired!

1486
01:22:47,926 --> 01:22:48,675
Fired!

1487
01:22:48,677 --> 01:22:49,300
Fired.

1488
01:22:49,302 --> 01:22:49,926
Fired.

1489
01:22:49,928 --> 01:22:50,594

Fired.

1494
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:55,766
Hey, Vainglorious.

1495
01:22:55,768 --> 01:22:58,685
Ready to settle that bet?

1496
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:01,563
I'm sorry what bet was that?

1497
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:02,773
There you go.

1498
01:23:02,775 --> 01:23:04,650
We got you, Zhi.

1499
01:23:04,652 --> 01:23:05,235
Hmm?

1500
01:23:11,449 --> 01:23:15,493
We had-- someone must
have hacked my account.

1501
01:23:15,495 --> 01:23:19,330
Daddy, you appeared to
have accidentally nabbed me

1502
01:23:19,332 --> 01:23:21,084
with your giant cool device.

1503
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:27,047
SHELBY: Yes.

1504
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:27,675
Look.

[crowd cheering]

1506
01:23:33,013 --> 01:23:34,012
We did it!

1507
01:23:34,014 --> 01:23:35,388
Let me think.

1508
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,015
I never really liked that
neighborhood anyway--

1509
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:39,350
too many lorises-- sees?

1510
01:23:39,352 --> 01:23:40,561
Lorisees?

1511
01:23:40,563 --> 01:23:41,520
Lorises.

1512
01:23:41,522 --> 01:23:42,353
Lorisi?

1513
01:23:42,355 --> 01:23:44,480
Aw.

1514
01:23:44,482 --> 01:23:46,650
I'm really going
to miss that guy.

1515
01:23:46,652 --> 01:23:47,442
Really?

1516
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:48,070
No.

1518
01:24:03,376 --> 01:24:04,042

SHELBY: Yay, Granny.

1520
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:06,127
ZHI: Go, Granny.

1521
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:07,128
Go, Granny.

1522
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:08,088
Oh, yeah.

1523
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:09,590
Oh, yeah.

1524
01:24:09,592 --> 01:24:10,217
Hey.

1525
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:22,561
You know I seem to recall
we've been here before.

1526
01:24:22,563 --> 01:24:25,063
Or was it here?

1527
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:28,984
Actually, I think
I was more like here.

1528
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:30,527
Oh, that's right.

1529
01:24:30,529 --> 01:24:35,281
Hmm, I can't remember
what happened next.

1530
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:36,326
Not this.

1531
01:24:38,746 --> 01:24:42,666
Zhi-zhi, Shelby, are
we going to play or not?

1532
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:47,544
Whoa.

1533
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:49,921
I don't know why
I call you, Speedy.

1534
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:50,508
Hmm?

1535
01:24:55,513 --> 01:25:02,851
[sigh]

1536
01:25:02,853 --> 01:25:04,728
Yellow mountain fruit peak?

1537
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,648
I know it was
always your favorite.

1538
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:08,231
Your favorite?

1539
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:09,190
[yelp]

1540
01:25:09,192 --> 01:25:11,109
[sip] [sigh]

1541
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:13,444
I'm still getting
used to that.

1542
01:25:13,446 --> 01:25:14,863
All right, game on.

1543
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:18,074
OK, but Shelby has to take
it easy on me this time.

1544
01:25:18,076 --> 01:25:19,242
Not a chance.

1545
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:20,410
I've been learning
from the best.

1546
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:22,746
[speaking chinese] Thank you.

1547
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:24,873
Wait, I've lived
with her all my life.

1548
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,833
How come I never learn
to play like this?

1549
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:29,630
Because you actually
have to listen.

1550
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:35,008
ABBY JACKS: Oh, and as the sun
sets over this happily restored

1551
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:38,762
Slow Loris community, there's
only one thing left to say.

1552
01:25:38,764 --> 01:25:41,222
JUNI HAKANSDOTTER: This story
is a lot like that turtle

1553
01:25:41,224 --> 01:25:42,182
and the rabbit one.

1554
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:43,391
ABBY JACKS: No, that's--

1555
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:44,768
forget it.

1556
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:48,188

to be in the sequel, yeah?

1558
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:49,648
OK, OK.

1559
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:53,193
I got a rhythm in my body.

1560
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:54,235
No way, no way.

1561
01:25:54,237 --> 01:25:57,488
Nobody's going to stop me now.

1562
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:58,699
Today, today.

1563
01:25:58,701 --> 01:26:00,617
I'm going to hold
onto the feeling,

1564
01:26:00,619 --> 01:26:04,079
not going to worry
about the reasons.

1565
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:05,914
No.

1566
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:10,335
The song is getting started
to the beating of my heart.

1567
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:15,298
And it's getting
me carried away.

1568
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,300
I got the feeling,
feeling right now.

1569
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:19,847

and I'm making a part.

This is electric,
electric in there.

1572

Back in the rhythm and
I ain't going to stop.

1573
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:42,659
OK, OK.

1574
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:46,204
Walking on the air like magic.

1575
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:47,413
No way, no way.

1576
01:26:47,415 --> 01:26:50,166
I ain't going to let
them drag me down.

1577
01:26:50,168 --> 01:26:51,459
Today, today.

1578
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:53,211
I'm going to hold
onto that feeling.

1579
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:57,257
I've been awaken
from my dreaming.

1580
01:26:57,259 --> 01:26:59,009
Oh.

1581
01:26:59,011 --> 01:27:03,429
Something is getting started,
the beating of a heart.

01:27:03,431 --> 01:27:07,601
It's getting me carried away.

Hey!

This is electric,
electric in there.

1587

Back in the room, and
I ain't going to stop.

1588
01:27:43,889 --> 01:27:47,516
Something getting started.

1589
01:27:47,518 --> 01:27:49,603
There's something
getting started--

1590
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:58,694
the beating of a heart,
the beating, the beating,

1591
01:27:58,696 --> 01:28:00,821
the beating of a heart.

Something getting started.

01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:09,329
There's something
getting started--

01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:16,503
the beating of a heart,
the beating, the beating,

1595
01:28:16,505 --> 01:28:18,505
the beating of a heart.

01:28:18,507 --> 01:28:20,924
I got the feeling,
