...they threw him away

185
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,602
[speaking Spanish]

186
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,624
Mm-hmm.

187
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,763
[giggles]

188
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:28,472
- [gasps]
- [both giggling]

189
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,988
Hmm?

190
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,809
[man] What's the charge?

191
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,044
[officer 1] Shut up.

192
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,484
[officer 2 speaks indistinct]

193
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,631
Do you think he knows
why he's here?

194
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,933
I think he knows
it's for murder.

195
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,269
I think he knows that much.

196
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,805
Why do you think
they call him Black?

197
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:14,278
I asked his pal, Kendu Wallace, why they
called him Black but he didn't know.

198
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,780
Did he know anything else?

199
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:20,084
Well he knew Black
didn't like Joey.

200
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,519
He knew that.

201
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:22,553
Hmm...

202
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:25,689
He said Black hated him.

203
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,659
Can I ask y'all something?

204
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,628
Please do.

205
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:37,268
What did Kendu Wallace
ever do to you?

206
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,604
I don't care
about Kendu Wallace.

207
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,806
He means nothing to me.

208
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,575
Yeah?

209
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,544
Obviously.

210
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:51,582

[speaking Spanish]

212
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,985
Say "good doggy."

213
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,654
[speaking Spanish]

214
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:59,690
[all cheering]

215
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,759
Tell him again.

216
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:06,130
- Aww...
- [laughing]

217
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:09,333
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

218
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:11,635
You're a good boy!

219
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,671
Yeah, you're a good boy.

220
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,640
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, don't fight it.

221
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,043
Don't fight me...
Hey, look at me, don't fight it.

222
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,811
Come on, I'm almost done.

223
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,112
I'm almost done.

224
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,949
[indistinct chatter
on police radio]

225
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,258
[officer] Victims ID'd as Kendu
Wallace and Jennifer Richards.

226
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,735
<i>[José] Where's my bro, Rocky?</i>

227
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,704
Washing your dirty dog.

228
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:49,239
<i>Hey, careful, that's my baby.</i>

229
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,908
[José speaks indistinct]

[speaking Spanish]

232
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,160
None of that
same stuff again, Eva.

233
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,961
<i>I'm calling from Iraq and
you're still talking about...</i>

234
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,663
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

235
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,398
Who's that causing ruckus
in my house, man?

236
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,733
What?! What?!

237
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,701
Who's calling from the
Middle East?

238
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:20,871
My brother!
[laughing]

239
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,973
<i>So you're a free man now,
my nigga.</i>

240
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,074
Yeah.

241
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,110
Wow. How it feel?

242
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,145
[groans] I ain't trying
to go back in. Know that.

243
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,347
<i>[José] Hey, but listen to me,
you feel me?</i>

244
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,716
You have to stand up
straight, you know?

245
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:33,917
You don't have
the same opportunities

246
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,653
like you used to have.
Do you hear me, Rocky?

247
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,388
<i>Look at me, look at me
in the camera, over there.</i>

248
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,658
No, your boy is done.
None of that bullshit.

249
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,662

250
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,398
[all laughing]

251
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,099
<i>[José] You like that meat, boy?</i>

252
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,438
[Naldo] So everything OK?

253
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,675
You need me
or why you call me here?

254
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,246
[Black] How's things with you?

255
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:06,150
Business is good, you know?

256
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,819
How you?

257
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:14,758
Well, they had me down at the
police station the other day.

258
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,293
Oh, yeah? Why?

259
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:21,198
Something about some cop
that got murdered.

260
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,002
Um... a DT named Cullen.

261
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:27,471
Oh, yeah...
yeah, I heard that there

262
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:32,476
was a cop that got killed over
there in the subway at 191st.

263
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:39,717
You know, they had some
snitch pictures, man,

264
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,319
of you and some other cat.

265
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,821
Me?

266
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:45,456
No, no, no.

267
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:49,493
Why? I don't know what
you're talking about.

268
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:52,730
I couldn't figure it out either,
I'm like, you know...

269
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,064
You know,
what type of connection

270
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,199
could you have to this,
you know?

271
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,800
Connection?

272
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:59,737
Black, I have no connection
with no cops, man.

273
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,506
You know, I'm just...
I'm just out here, you know,

274
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,041
I'm always hustling...

275
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:06,443
- Well...
- I don't...

276
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:10,914
It was pictures of you
and some Dominican nigga

277
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,783
in front of, um...

278
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,119
...Club Miami.

279
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,858
Oh, OK, OK.

280
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:25,329
[coughs]
That's my friend, Rocky.

281
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:27,331
[growling]

282
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,332
Yo, Rock, you should let
that nigga go, man!

283
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,801
I'm serious, man!

284
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:33,837
[speaks indistinct]

285
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,840
Look, my brother,
this is my bro's dog.

286
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:40,244
How am I gonna put the dog
in harm's way? Explain it to me.

287
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:41,311
Good boy!

288
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,980
His brother was
a tough ass dude,

289
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:44,948
that's why he got
a tough ass dog.

290
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,951
Munch, the nigga is a dog, B!

291
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,087
Shit, you don't understand!

292
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,022
Cut some of that fur off
and you'll get it!

293
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:55,225
So you're talking about Cullen.

294
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,795
Cullen, Cullen,
the Detective Cullen?

295
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,263
Oh, man, he's the devil.

296
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:01,198
He is dirty, man, he's dirty.

297
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,867
Do you know what he did?

298
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,535
He violated my nigga
with a stick, man.

299
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:06,754
He...

300
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:08,972
I don't even want to talk
about that because it's just...

301
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:14,845
It's just crazy that he did that
to Rocky, who just got out.

302
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:17,548
He did three years,
he never snitched on me before,

303
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,450
so I don't know
what he was doing,

304
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:23,587
maybe he was scouting him
or something because...

305
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,522
I don't know, but I have
nothing to do with that.

306
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,374
I don't know...

307
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,455
I don't know what you
want me to tell you, man.

308
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,464
Pay that man.

309
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:42,439
[speaking Spanish]

310
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,957
Shh...

311
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:38,896
You ever seen
one of those ant farms?

312
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,633
I got one for Chrissy
for his birthday last year.

313
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:46,637
He never looks at it,
but I find it fascinating.

314
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,207
It's amazing...

315
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:55,979
Leslie...

316
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:03,954
Anyway this Joey thing...

317
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:07,057
could get pretty ugly
if it's not handled properly.

318
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:11,128
He had a lot of enemies and...

319
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:18,302
I'm not just talking about
the drug dealers he robbed.

320
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:20,270
I know he was your partner

321
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,206
but Scotty,
he was a fucking idiot.

322
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,145
You know, he was very dirty.

323
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:31,481
And, unfortunately,
his dirt caught up with him.

324
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:34,651
But at least his wife
will get his full pension.

325
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,955
Now, the more you dig
the more you risk

326
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:41,058
screwing up that pension
for his wife and kids.

327
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:45,429
And I don't think you want
that on your conscience.

328
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:50,534
Like Chrissy's ant farm,
sometimes the ants die.

329
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,636
The other day I'm looking
at a dead one,

330
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,004
and he's all the way down
at the bottom,

331
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,038
and all the other ants are...

332
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,543
...crawling all over him
like it's nothing, you know?

333
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,545
No big deal.

334
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:09,720
And Black, Mr. Jonathan Jones?

335
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,155
There's nothing there.

336
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,157
He has motive.

337
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,727
What's his motive?

338
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:20,664
It seems like Joey was
maybe blackmailing him.

339
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,432
Extorting him.

340
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,135
I don't know.

341
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,437
But he definitely has motive.

342
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,674
[scoffs]
Mr. Jones.

343
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,709
The Feds have been all over him

344
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,578
for a while now.

345
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,046
Years.

346
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,314
He knew that.

347
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,250
He's not killing a cop.

348
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,355
OK.

349
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,090
Who else you got?

350
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:51,228
Well, I'm waiting on MTA.
forensics...

351
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,198
There's this girl.

352
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,567
I don't know.

353
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:01,038
I think she might
know something.

354
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,828
This nigga's buggin'.
I'm lying?

355
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,064
Yeah, nigga on some other shit!

356
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,265
Hating is a weak emotion.

357
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,800
Y'all niggas gotta be
better than that, B.

358
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:33,136
How's it going, man?
All good?

359
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,605
[speaks indistinct]

360
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,708
Just out here.

361
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,712

365
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,490
Yeah, man.
I know, I know how it is.

366
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,125
I don't know if you heard,

367
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:57,394
but that detective
you had beef with,

368
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:01,331
somebody caught that nigga
in the subway. He's dead.

369
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:05,652
So what?

370
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:08,637
I don't care nothing
about that faggot ass cop.

371
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,273
Whether he's dead or alive, B.

[speaking Spanish]

373
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:24,588
Maybe you should lay low.

374
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,523
Yo, my nigga.

375
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:30,127

- Yeah, OK.

390
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,390
Let's get this over with.

391
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,371
Well, our main concern
is for you.

392
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,773
So what are you saying exactly?

393
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:07,877
If things came out
and an investigation

394
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:11,348
were opened on Joey, you know.

395
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,119
We wouldn't want that
to jeopardize,

396
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:19,856
you know, Joey's pension.

397
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:27,697
Really?
So you come into my house,

398
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:32,535
my and my dead husband's house,
and you're telling me what?

399
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,672
That you're not going
to go after his killer?

400
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:38,408
I want you out of my house.

401
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,644
Scotty, make her get
out of my house!

402
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,079
I don't want her in here!

403
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,816
OK, partner,
I'll meet you outside.

404
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,858
You know what you are, Scotty?

405
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,960
Well, I'll tell you.

406
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,131
You're pathetic.

407
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,166
Look at me.

408
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,137

Don't Janine me.
You had one friend!

411
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:15,445
You had one fucking person
in this world

412
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,814
who gave
a flying fuck about you!

413
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:24,154
Who took you kid every weekend
because you couldn't handle it!

414
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:26,122
Who watched your son!

415
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:29,959
You couldn't even take care
of your own fucking son!

416
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:35,999
And this is how you treat him?

422
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,786

424
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,189
If I see him, I call you.

425
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,826
Lemme see, lemme see.
You see this guy?

426
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,128
He don't look Dominican,
he look Puerto Rican.

428
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:43,900

that your son,

00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:34,644
José Alvarez de la Cruz,
was killed in action.

443
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:52,395
My nephew is no slouch either.

444
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:54,330
[man] Let me tell you
how good a cop he is.

445
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:58,101
He is, in my opinion, the best
doughnut guy we ever had!

446
00:43:58,103 --> 00:44:01,204
And he was nice enough
to give a ticket

447
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:02,872
to an old girlfriend of mine.

448
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:06,042
A chick who, sad to say,
broke the D-man's heart.

449
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,877
How much was that ticket?

450
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:13,349
Oh, that's right,
$250 for blocking the bus!

451
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,718
I call him

Hey, Rocky, I'm sorry to hear
about your brother, José, man.

455
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,942
[man] Just waiting until I clear
my head some more, you feel me?

456
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:15,445
I feel you, but look,

457
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:17,947
the police came
looking for you the other day.

458
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:20,083
- For real?
- Seriously.

459
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:23,136
Yo, that must be what

460

about, remember?

461
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,823
Come on, bra, pay attention.

That nigga Naldo is dead.

463
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:33,296

You just watch your back, man.

466
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,072
Word is Black is the one
that killed Naldo.

467
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,307
That's crazy, man.

468
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,309
Maybe you should just
lay low for a minute.

469
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:52,882
[Ramirez] What is it?

470
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:57,386
Come on,
what do you got, partner?

471

I don't know, probably nothing.

00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:04,427
Isn't that the girl
from the photo?

473
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:13,503
- What?
- Tell me about your kids.

What are they like?

477

They're loud. They're wild.

What'd you really
think about Joey?

490
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:33,916
He was there for me
when my wife died.

491

Of course I remembered.

00:52:56,874 --> 00:53:00,509
- But I lied.
- Yeah.

525
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:04,413
When I said that you didn't
have no fucking friends.

526
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:08,184
I'm your friend.

00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,958
We need some good news.

545
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,308
[all talking over each other]

546
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:40,969
Gloria...

547
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:44,440
Gloria...

548
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,098
[Gloria] She needs to leave
this house right now.

549
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,899
Let her parents
take care of her.

550
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:13,669
- I don't want her here!
- [Eva] I'll tell her to leave.

551
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,111
Manuel...

552
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:25,447
[speaking Spanish]

553
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,741
You think I don't feel guilty?

554
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:55,444
I don't know.

555
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:57,179
Of course I do.

556
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,415
But you should feel way worse!

557
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,083
[both laughing]

558
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:03,819
Come on.

559
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:05,888
Don't be a little pussy.

560
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,923
We didn't do nothing wrong.

561
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,460
Your wife is dead,
my husband's dead.

562
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:13,762
We're just human.

563
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,598
I know.

564
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:27,443
Besides,
Joey wasn't no choir boy.

565
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:32,348
Yeah, I know.

566
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:35,150
I know he took money from
dealers. Everybody knew that.

567
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:38,554
Yeah.

568
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,889
He did more than that.

569
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:45,727
Remember that... A few years
ago, that Dominican kid?

570
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:47,629
Yeah, of course.

571
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,465
What about it?

572
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:52,768
He did do it, Scotty.

573
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,638
One day he just broke down,
and he told me everything.

574
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,811
But the kid was a real
troublemaker, you know?

575
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:05,547
He was dealing drugs and shit.

576
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,818
Joey said he was just trying
to mess with him, you know?

577
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:18,227
But I don't want my Joey's name
tarnished with this shit, OK?

578
00:58:18,229 --> 00:58:20,963
I mean, we got kids!

579
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:23,866
I mean, you owe him that much.

582
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,959
[Anthony] Hello?

583
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:58,961
Hey, buddy, it's me.

584
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:00,729
How's it going?

585
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:03,632
Hi, Dad, I'm sleeping.

586
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:06,835
I know. I know, OK.

587
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:09,037
Go back to sleep.

588
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,139
<i>Dad, did you get my card?</i>

589
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:13,141
I did.

590
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,244
It's the best card ever.

591
01:00:17,648 --> 01:00:19,781
You really liked it?

592
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,718
I loved it.

593
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:29,992
Uh...
I'm coming down to visit soon.

594
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:31,727
When?

595
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,798
Soon.

596
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,300
I just gotta finish a case here,
and then I'm coming down.

597
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:43,972
- Anthony?
- [yawns]

598
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:48,210
Anthony, OK, go back to sleep.

599
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:50,712
- <i>Oh, Dad...</i>
- Yeah.

600
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:53,782
Did you have a nice birthday?

601
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:58,286
Yeah, it was good.

602
01:00:58,288 --> 01:00:59,788
The, uh...

603
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:07,029
The guys, um... they had
a little cake, you know,

604
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:11,433
and a little something for me
down at the station.

605
01:01:11,435 --> 01:01:15,704
It was...
It was real nice.

606
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:23,445
OK, um... go back to sleep, huh.

607
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:26,081
- I love you.
- <i>Good night, Dad.</i>

608
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:29,885
- <i>I love you, too.</i>
- OK, good night.

609
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,721
Good night, pal.

615
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,378
Mm-hmm.

Olga...

617
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:47,522
Amen.

618
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:50,892
Amen.

619
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:13,181
Playboy, how much
they pay you up in here?

620
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,583
[José] Why, you need a job?

621
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:18,620
Nah, man,
I'm just curious, man.

622
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:20,622
Ah, let me see.

623
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:24,926
How about some... pig butt?

624
01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:27,195
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

625
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,064
Pork butt.

626
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:30,966
Yeah.

627
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:35,403
Let me get the biggest piece
you got, man.

628
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,540
Yeah.

629
01:04:42,613 --> 01:04:45,013
And trim
all that fat off, homie.

630
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:48,416
Yeah.

631
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,627
Yeah.

632
01:04:58,629 --> 01:05:02,530
You know I like my butt
to be firm, feel me?

633
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,905
You know, for some reason

634
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:11,940
I just feel like
you one of them brothers

635
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:14,643
that's been violated before,
you know?

636
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:16,945
Like I don't know what it is,

637
01:05:16,947 --> 01:05:20,315
but I just get
that vibe, you know.

638
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:24,085
That type of energy
from you, man.

639
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:30,625
Have you ever been sodomized
or anything like that before?

640
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:32,661
Now I'm just saying, no, no, no,
hear me out, hear me out,

641
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:35,397
because if you have...

642
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:38,400
...it wasn't your fault.

643
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:41,220
Because you see,

644
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:44,039
if you decided to kill the
nigga that did it to you.

645
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:49,477
I don't think anybody would
hold that against you, homie.

646
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:55,150
So you obviously know more
about me than I know about you.

647
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:59,020
- I tell you what.
- What's up?

648
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:02,390
- This is what I need you to do.
- What you need me to do?

649
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:04,526
I need you to go to the police

650
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:07,529
and tell them
what happened between you

651
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:10,498
and that little faggot cop,
Cullen.

652
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,469
Because you see right now

653
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,539
they thinking that I'm
the one that killed him.

654
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:24,412
And you and me both know
that that ain't what happened.

655
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:26,481
If you came here to kill me,
right?

656
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:30,618
You better make sure
you do a good job, homie.

657
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,989
And that's the only thing
I'ma tell you.

658
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:39,260
You know,
under different circumstances

659
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:42,731
you could've been
one of my top employees.

660
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:44,766
Thank you, come again.

[distorted voice] Isabel, I need
to talk to Manuel De La Cruz.

667
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:20,161
Do you know
where I can find him?

668
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,769
[man] Half-a-pound of that now?

669
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:28,870
She's crazy out here.

670
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:30,672
Nah, we got to get at her.

- [Ramirez] He's downtown.

676
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,355
Oh, perfect.

677
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:24,459
Hey, talk to me.

678
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:28,730
Well, let's see...

679
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:30,465
He's dead.

680
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:32,667
He's dead.

681
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:35,303
She's dead.

682
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:38,640
Mr. De La Cruz
is nowhere to be found.

683
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:41,876
And she saw something.
She was there.

684
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,213
But what am I gonna do?
Bring her in?

685
01:09:45,215 --> 01:09:46,781
She'll be dead in a week.

686
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:50,185
No one's saying a thing.

687
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:53,555
And suddenly nobody
speaks English either.

688
01:09:53,557 --> 01:09:56,691
Well, your Spanish is
half-way decent, isn't it?

689
01:09:56,693 --> 01:10:00,195
My Spanish fucking sucks,
but that's not the problem.

690
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:03,498
It's just nobody's talking.
Nobody's saying a fucking thing.

691
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,400
And I don't fucking blame them.

692
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:07,869
But somebody knows something.

693
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,205
She knows what happened.

694
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:15,944

Haul her in? Get her killed?

695
01:10:15,946 --> 01:10:17,445

[chuckles]

699
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:47,442
Because Mr. Jonathan Jones here

700
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:51,679
cannot associate
with any known felons.

701
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:05,593
So this is their new plan?

702
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:10,265
To just sit there
and harass me to death?

703
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:13,768
What can you do?
They think you killed a cop.

724
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:25,806
Her.

725
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,675
Who is this?

726
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,411
[Scott] A girl.

727
01:17:30,413 --> 01:17:32,813
I can see that.

728
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:38,786
Joey had some photos of her
on his camera.

729
01:17:38,788 --> 01:17:41,422
She's related to the
Dominican kid that he had that...

730
01:17:41,424 --> 01:17:43,591
Shh.

731
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:45,759
Hey, sweetheart,
you want to go upstairs?

732
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:48,963
You can go watch some cartoons,
OK?

733
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:51,098
They love TV.

734
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:57,805
Was Joey messing round
with this bitch?

735
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:59,173
I don't know.

736
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:01,342
Yeah, so what's your point?

737
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:03,778
I mean, what's this
got to do with anything?

738
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,914
I don't know, I just wanted to
know if he mentioned anything,

739
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:10,851
or if you ever saw her
or or anything.

740
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:15,156
No, I never saw her before.

741
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:29,370
So are you gonna
stay a little while?

742
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,172
I can't.

743
01:18:31,174 --> 01:18:33,774
I gotta get to the city.

744
01:18:33,776 --> 01:18:35,409
Whatever.

745
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:49,390
[Elisa singing indistinct]

746
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:51,859
[speaking Spanish]

747
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:49,049
- So that's it?
- That's it.

748
01:19:49,051 --> 01:19:51,819
And what about Jonathan Jones?

749
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:54,054
We're just gonna let him off?

750
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:56,524
Is your gut telling you
he's our guy?

751
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:02,129
Cause what about the kid
that Joey allegedly sodomized?

752
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,831
Any word on him?

753
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:08,235
It's either him
or Jonathan Jones, OK?

754
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:10,171
I know that much.

755
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:13,474
Scotty you're not gonna
drop this, are you?

756
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:19,213
What is this?

757
01:20:22,919 --> 01:20:24,151
Who is she?

758
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,920
Well, your buddy raped her.

759
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,260
At least that's what she said,
and will say under oath.

760
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:38,833
We're dropping the
investigation, let it go.

761
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:41,068
Your buddy was a rapist.

762
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:43,437
You understand me?
He was not a good guy.

763
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:47,875
The department's not gonna
take a fall for that prick.

764
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:51,278
So the case is dropped
for good.

765
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,047
It's dead.

766
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,550
That's it.

767
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:15,002
[man] They're not gonna be
bothering you anymore.

768
01:21:15,004 --> 01:21:17,171
I got the inside line,
the cops are dropping

769
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:19,306
the investigation
into Joey Cullen's murder.

770
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:22,142
And I am 100 percent
certain about that.

771
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:23,944
[thunder rumbles]

772
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:25,346
That's what I want to hear.

773
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:27,514
You did good, Mr. Himmel.

774
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:31,018
But you know
I woulda killed him,

775
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,954
that crooked-ass cop, Cullen.

776
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:37,958
But, I guess somebody else
beat me to it.

777
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,996
Well, it's all over now.
Right?

778
01:21:42,965 --> 01:21:45,532
Yeah, almost.

779
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,269
One more loose end.

780
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,086
My bigger nigga.

781
01:22:06,656 --> 01:22:08,322
Come on, my dude.

782
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:09,690
Actually, um...

783
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:12,293
...I'm looking for
that homicidal maniac

784
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:13,594
you be running with, man.

785
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:16,530
I haven't seen Rocky
in a long time, man.

786
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:18,699
Well, I got some unfinished
business with him.

787
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:20,935
Let's talk upstairs, bro.

788
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,015

[chuckles]

792
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:07,448
You know,
I'll give you one thing.

793
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:10,985
You definitely
one little tough nigga, man.

794
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:18,726
But you see the game
is over now, playboy.

795
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:21,379
Yeah.

796
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:24,031
I can't afford you bleeding
on these $1,500 Ferragamo's!

797
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:40,481
I'll tell you what.
I got it.

798
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:44,184
I mean that's the least
I can do for you.

799

[groans]

800
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:59,400
I told you to make sure
you do a good job.

801
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:16,050
Isabel?

802

809
01:26:10,299 --> 01:26:11,498
Huh?

810
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:29,783
OK...
