1
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:06,971
Oh, yeah, yeah

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,944
l'm your basic average girl

3
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:10,970
And l'm here to save the world

4
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:15,144
You can't stop me
'cause l'm Kim Possible

5
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:17,050
There is nothin' l can't do

6
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:18,554
When danger approaches

7
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:21,751
Know that l am on my way

8
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:25,888
lt doesn't matter
where or when there's trouble

9
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,523
lf you just call my name

10
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,089
Kim Possible

11
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,101
Call me, beep me,
if you want to reach me

12
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:33,966
When you want to page me,
it's OK

13
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:35,995
Whenever you need me, baby

14
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,836
Call me, beep me,
if you want to reach me

15
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:40,001
Call me, beep me

16
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:41,840
lf you want to reach me

17
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,008
Doesn't matter where,
doesn't matter when

18
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,678
l will be there for you
till the very end

19
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,177
Danger or trouble,
l'm there on the double

20
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:57,853
You know that you always
can call Kim Possible

21
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:59,418
So what's the sitch?

22
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:02,158
Call me, beep me,
if you want to reach me

23
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:29,981
Hi.

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,207
No, no problem.
No, thank you.

25
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:50,509
My life is so over.

26
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,317
Ron, turn down
the drama and eat.

27
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:56,580
Not hungry.

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,758
What am l gonna do, K.P.?

29
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,623
Well, let's see.

30
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:06,253
The guidance counselor
told you...

31
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:08,594
that you need
an extra-curricular activity.

32
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,998
Because it'll look good on
my college applications.

33
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:12,592
That's years away!

34
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:14,627
There's plenty of teams
and clubs out there.

35
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,696
You could join the Mathletes.

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,709
Right! l can't get in
that kind of shape!

37
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:23,008
-How about the debate team?
-l'm not gonna argue with you, Kim!

38
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,741
Afterschool activities
are great...

39
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,544
like cheer squad for me.

40
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,949
Cheer squad!

41
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:31,453
For me. Not you.

42
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:34,389
That's it! l'm upbeat.
l can do that.

43
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:36,551
-Do what?
-Cheerleader!

44
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:39,460
Yeah! Go Mad Dogs!

45
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,200
Hi!

46
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:52,035
My life is so over!

47
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:54,737
l think it's cute that
Ron wants to be a cheerleader.

48
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:56,769
Mother, boy bands are cute.

49
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,145
Brown bear backpacks are cute.

50
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:02,015
Ron as a cheerleader--
not cute.

51
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:04,111
He'll wear a different outfit,
won't he?

52
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:05,781
Knowing Ron...

53
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:08,017
Hi, hon.
Pizza for dinner.

54
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:09,457
What do you want on yours?

55
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:10,754
Toppings...

56
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:13,319
You know l love bacon
on pretty much everything.

57
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:21,167
OK. See you
in 30 minutes or less.

58
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:26,941
Gotta go.

59
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:31,138
-Hello?
-Hey, Possible. Bob Chen.

60
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:34,412
Did you launch something
over there?

61
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:37,352
On the Q.T., Bob,
prototype G-6 rocket.

62
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:40,015
Went up like a dream.
Too bad it wasn't...

63
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:42,081
supposed to launch
until next week.

64
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,753
-Lean on a button again?
-Roger on that, Bob.

65
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:46,921
See you at the class reunion
this weekend?

66
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:48,294
Wouldn't miss it. Ouch!

67
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:51,494
The military is scrambling
around my rocket.

68
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:54,196
-Better hop off, Bob.
-See you at the reunion.

69
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:56,228
Same old Possible.

70
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,315
You cannot allow this, Kim.

71
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,840
Bonnie, l'm as freaked out
about this as you are...

72
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:11,877
but there is no rule
that says Ron can't try out.

73
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,515
Check your calendar!
lt's not Befriend-A-Loser Week!

74
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:16,525
Ron is not a loser.

75
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:19,687
He's just... different.

76
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,459
-Ladies, let's boogie!
-Oh, yeah!

77
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,392
Ladies?

78
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:32,504
- They take a long time to get dressed.
- Hey.

79
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,203
Where's the squad?
l'm pumped!

80
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:37,577
They, um... they take a long time
to get dressed.

81
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:41,516
Are you totally sure
you want to be a cheerleader, Ron?

82
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:44,179
l'm not gonna be
a cheerleader, K.P.

83
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,744
You're not? Great!

84
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,087
l mean, why not?

85
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:50,524
Because l'm going
to be the mascot!

86
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,085
Middleton Mad Dogs!
Fight!

87
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,188
Where did you get that mask?

88
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:58,325
l made it with
my Movie Makeup Magic kit.

89
00:04:58,368 --> 00:05:00,359
What's the sitch?

90
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:04,764
l'm impressed...and disturbed.

91
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:08,039
Does it not rock hard?
Check this out!

92
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:11,138
Mad Dog foams at the mouth!

93
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:12,739
-Kim!
-Ron!

94
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:14,545
The crowd will eat it up!

95
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:16,108
Taste it.
lt's banana cream.

96
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:17,449
Yum.

97
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,887
Banana! Hey!

98
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,413
This idea is idiotic.

99
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,619
The entire student body
will laugh at you.

100
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,185
-But--
-Not with, at.

101
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,629
Loudly and cruelly,
they will laugh.

102
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:32,032
You don't deserve to be kissed
by a naked mole rat.

103
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:34,502
-Ron...
-l know, Kim. l know.

104
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:36,129
You believe in me
and you'll work on them.

105
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:39,403
l kind of agree with Bonnie.

106
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:42,104
Oh, l see.

107
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,421
Dad, l have a problem.

108
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:56,721
Frankly, your mother
has the good advice...

109
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,420
vis-a-vis boy trouble.

110
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:00,827
This isn't about a boy.
lt's about Ron.

111
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,923
Oh. Gotcha.

112
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,901
Everyone got down on Ron,
and l don't know...

113
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:07,664
maybe l should have
stuck up for him.

114
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:09,433
But you didn't...

115
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:12,669
He was foaming at the mouth.
l'm only human.

116
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,405
You know, Kimmy,
back when l was in college...

117
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:19,381
l had a group of friends,
my posse, if you will.

118
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,211
lt was the night...

119
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:24,413
of the big science
department mixer.

120
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:28,220
ln those days,
l wasn't exactly a ladies man.

121
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:29,725
Where's Drew?

122
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,317
He was supposed to be here
a half hour ago.

123
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:33,454
l knew he wouldn't come
through with dates for us.

124
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:35,361
What did you expect?

125
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,525
He cannot even come through
with a date for himself.

126
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,536
-This was folly.
-lt was a nice dream.

127
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,299
The dream is real.

128
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,033
Drew! You found girls!

129
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:47,372
Found! Gentlemen,
tonight we make history.

130
00:06:48,878 --> 00:06:51,346
l give you the future!

131
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:53,975
My name is Bebe.

132
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,649
Bebe, would you like to dance?

133
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:01,384
Affirmative. Bebe will dance.

134
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:10,327
As gentle as
a summer shower, no?

135
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:11,833
No!

136
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:18,370
All right.
Go on, laugh away...

137
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:22,037
but one day my genius
will be recognized!

138
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:24,205
Bebe will be perfect...

139
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:26,511
and l will be
the one laughing.

140
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:29,814
l am Bebe.

141
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:33,015
Drew dropped out
and we never saw him again.

142
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:34,751
l don't think
he ever forgave us...

143
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:39,125
and in some small way,
we never forgave ourselves.

144
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:40,527
For a giggle fit?

145
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:42,622
No, no, Kimmy.
We laughed for days.

146
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:45,259
Long and loud,
with youthful abandon.

147
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:47,098
That was bad.

148
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:49,627
So you'll reconsider
Ronald's dream?

149
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:50,934
l don't think so.

150
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:53,943
His Mad Dog routine
is way stupid.

151
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:56,104
That's one person's opinion.

152
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:58,306
One entire cheerleading
squad's opinion.

153
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,839
Maybe you and your squad
just don't get it.

154
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,111
You don't get it!

155
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:05,678
''l'm Kim Possible.
l can do anything.''

156
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:07,656
Except believe in
my best friend!

157
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,723
Go, Wade.

158
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:14,491
-l've got a weird one.
-Me, too.

159
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,464
Professor Ramesh from the
Mount Middleton Observatory...

160
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:17,796
wants your help.

161
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:20,894
That name sounds familiar.
l think my dad knows him.

162
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:23,565
Ramesh's partner,
Professor Chen, is missing.

163
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,130
OK, Wade. Set up a ride.

164
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:26,801
l'll bring the Man
of a Thousand Faces.

165
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:28,811
No, thanks. l'll fly solo.

166
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,837
l won't be flying,
but l'll get there somehow.

167
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,917
Nice going, Possible.

168
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:38,580
And that's
the traffic update...

169
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,589
from your
''Eye Over Middleton.''

170
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:42,591
Thanks for the lift, Dallas.

171
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,650
lt's the least
l could do after...

172
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:47,424
you brought that interstate
police chase to a happy end.

173
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:48,657
No big.

174
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:50,529
The guy didn't even know
he needed a new brake light.

175
00:08:54,137 --> 00:08:56,264
Better check on the Mad Dog.

176
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:58,968
Ron? Come in, Ron. Ron!

177
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:02,671
Sorry! Can't hear you!

178
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:05,010
Bad reception!

179
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:09,945
Come off it, Ron.
l know you're doing that.

180
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:14,446
What? l'm only hearing
every other word!

181
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,187
Ron! Don't be a baby.

182
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:23,154
Stay back!

183
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,862
Professor Ramesh...

184
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:29,531
we have come for you.

185
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:35,402
Who are you?

186
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:41,548
l am Bebe.

187
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:44,644
ls there an echo in here?

188
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:47,884
Analysis subject--Kim Possible.

189
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:50,051
Threat--minimal.

190
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,323
That hurts.

191
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,162
Not bad.

192
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:03,900
Bebe is perfect.

193
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,459
What are they?

194
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,563
Kim, don't think l didn't...

195
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:36,572
hear that baby comment.

196
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:38,233
l heard it.

197
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,271
Ron?

198
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:56,589
Thanks a lot.

199
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,753
What did l do?

200
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:00,626
Those robots
took Professor Ramesh.

201
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:02,028
Are you happy now?

202
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:04,897
Yes.

203
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:07,926
l mean, no!

204
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,530
Whatever. All l know
is that now we've got...

205
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:14,304
two missing scientists
and three killer Bebes.

206
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,710
Huh?

207
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:20,648
Professor Ramesh.

208
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:23,914
Back in the old college days.
Check it out.

209
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,857
Oh, yeah.
That guy must be Professor Chen.

210
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:37,498
What? No way, that is not--

211
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,128
Wow, it is! lt's Kim's dad!

212
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,195
This is terrible.

213
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,673
Can you believe he actually
wore his jacket that way...

214
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,768
with the sleeves pushed up?
Totally Eighties.

215
00:11:57,119 --> 00:12:00,520
Kim's dad could be
the next target.

216
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,417
Gotta tell Kim!

217
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,190
No, wait.
We don't need Kim.

218
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,326
l know exactly what to do!

219
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:29,346
Subject--Dr. Possible.

220
00:12:29,385 --> 00:12:32,445
Directive--capture.

221
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,225
Doctor...

222
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,628
we have come for you.

223
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:58,638
Kimberly Ann Possible!

224
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,475
Dad? Here?

225
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:06,648
Great. Kim found another
new recruit for the squad.

226
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:10,750
Daddy, hi!
What are you doing here?

227
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:12,590
-Where's Ronald?
-Not here.

228
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:16,754
That hole in
the roof of my car...

229
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,391
really grinds my beans.

230
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:20,561
l'll be sure
that Ron gets the message--

231
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:23,572
Wait a second.
He put a hole in your car roof?

232
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:26,234
He came to the house,
said something about a mission.

233
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:27,765
What mission?

234
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,941
-Who is behind this?
-lt's obvious.

235
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:35,974
Some villain needs our genius
to help take over the world.

236
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:37,178
What else could it be?

237
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:39,915
Gentlemen,
don't flatter yourselves.

238
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:42,447
There is only one genius
in this room...

239
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:45,585
and it is l, Dr. Drakken!

240
00:13:45,628 --> 00:13:46,822
Drew?

241
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:49,057
Drew Lipsky?
ls that you?

242
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,259
No!

243
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,790
He's Dr. Drakken...

244
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:55,804
and he's in
for a world of hurt!

245
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:59,706
So, Kim Possible is near.

246
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,710
Oh, yes!

247
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:03,268
Actually, no.

248
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:13,550
Wade, Ron's missing.
Can you find him?

249
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,285
Do you think l have him
micro-chipped or something?

250
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:17,758
Well, do you?

251
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:21,251
Yeah. Hang on.

252
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,925
And could you maybe
go a little faster?

253
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:27,129
Kim, it's a school zone!

254
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:32,771
l purposely programmed you
with a pinch of human emotion...

255
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,936
just so you would be
ashamed of failures like this.

256
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:37,741
lt's slipshod is what it is!

257
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,078
-Slipshod?
-That's right, missy!

258
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:42,141
And l demand better
from my lackeys!

259
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:46,018
-Especially the robotic ones!
-Lackeys?

260
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:50,116
Let's not get testy.
l am a patient man.

261
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,153
You will get another chance.
Go forth and find Dr. Possible!

262
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,869
Why are you after Kim's dad
and his friends anyway?

263
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:04,339
Payback! For you see--

264
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:09,367
Wait. Dr. Possible
and Kim Possible are related?

265
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:12,506
-Duh.
-Don't ''duh'' me.

266
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:14,379
Possible is
a very common last name.

267
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:17,443
-So not.
-So--so, yes, it is.

268
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:18,953
lt's pretty unique.

269
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:23,357
Enough! l shall prove it!

270
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:25,917
Where's the phone book?

271
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:38,069
Park it close.
We shouldn't be long.

272
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:41,201
Keep your keys, Dad.
He's been hit with knockout gas.

273
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,520
This is bad.

274
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,290
l'll say. They'd better
get this ironed out...

275
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:03,025
before our big
college reunion this weekend.

276
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:13,032
Kim, it was Drakken!

277
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,599
Drakken's behind this?

278
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:16,110
Fine, so in Middleton...

279
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:18,272
there's only
one ''Possible'' family.

280
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:19,941
D'oy!

281
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:23,281
Kim Possible! And--and--

282
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,617
Her father, Dr. Possible.

283
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:29,590
There's no way
l can be expected to conclude...

284
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,525
that my arch-nemesis
is the daughter...

285
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,460
of a guy
l went to college with!

286
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:35,726
Drew? Drew Lipsky?

287
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:38,199
Wait!
He's the guy from college?

288
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:39,667
My arch-foe?

289
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:42,136
He didn't used to be blue,
l can tell you that much.

290
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,732
But l was blue on the inside.

291
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:48,972
Scorned by my so-called friends.

292
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:52,003
My...my posse.

293
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:55,847
But l vowed to prove
my genius to all of you...

294
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:58,979
and when l got
the reunion invite--

295
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:01,888
Since you dropped out,
you're not entitled to that.

296
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,186
lndeed!

297
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:07,423
Exactly why l planned
my own little reunion!

298
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:10,023
Bebes, return to me at once!

299
00:17:12,868 --> 00:17:15,428
Who's the genius now?

300
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:17,564
These robots are perfect!

301
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:20,598
And their sole purpose
is to obey me!

302
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:23,043
Question--
if we are perfect...

303
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:26,639
why do we obey
one who is not perfect?

304
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:30,482
Conclusion--
Drakken is unfit to command.

305
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:34,153
lt's college all over again.

306
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,680
That man cannot build a robot.

307
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:37,453
He should take up cloning.

308
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:41,452
Bebes, no! Bad Bebes! Bad!

309
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:44,125
This is just too weird.

310
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:50,195
Where did little Kimmy learn
to kick bottom like that?

311
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,638
Cheerleading.

312
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:53,972
Yes!

313
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,573
Kim!

314
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,788
We got a roomful
of geniuses here!

315
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:47,022
Can't somebody
come up with something?

316
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:49,360
-l'm an astronomer.
-Ditto.

317
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,430
And you?

318
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:56,564
Let the ladies work this out
amongst themselves.

319
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:00,832
-Wade!
-Dr. Possible?

320
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:04,209
l need a sonic disturbance.
Make it loud. Ultra-high frequency.

321
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:05,975
Something to jam
a wireless network signal?

322
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:07,312
Please and thank you.

323
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:18,885
Analysis--subject--

324
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:21,488
Dr. Possible's
attack strategy.

325
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,431
Threat--substantial.

326
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:27,663
Destroy electronic device.

327
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:42,509
Dr. P! l'm open!

328
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,334
Hive mind command...

329
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,802
con-con-connection...

330
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:03,361
lo-lo-lost.

331
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:05,066
l'll take that as good news.

332
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:08,508
Now, Kim, you know
l don't approve of violence...

333
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:12,708
but they are deadly robots.
You go, girl!

334
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:44,036
Way to go, Kim!
You, too, Dr. P.!

335
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,512
What was that, Ronald?

336
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:48,806
Way to go, Dad.

337
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,792
What about
your college reunion, Drew?

338
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:00,886
l'll come to the next one...

339
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:04,387
when l'm even more successful!

340
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:12,372
A little help.

341
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:15,844
l can't believe Drew Lipsky
turned into a mad scientist.

342
00:21:15,878 --> 00:21:17,743
Let alone our daughter's
arch-nemesis.

343
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,441
But my man knew what to do!

344
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,381
Possible, you rock!

345
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:24,511
Oh, please.
Drakken was so obvious.

346
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:27,545
l mean, really.
The whole ''Bebebe'' thing.

347
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:29,648
The hive mind behavior
was clearly the result...

348
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:32,251
of a cybertronic linkage through
a wireless control network.

349
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:34,228
Sure.

350
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:37,198
Poor Drew. Maybe if we hadn't
laughed at him back then...

351
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:40,998
there would be one less
mad scientist running around.

352
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:43,163
The fact that
l was so rotten to you...

353
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,638
that's not gonna
drive you to become...

354
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:46,834
some kind of mask-wearing
villain, is it?

355
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,035
lf l said yes...

356
00:21:48,077 --> 00:21:50,568
would you let me do
my Mad Dog routine?

357
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:52,842
That's not a good reason
for me to say yes.

358
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:54,041
l know.

359
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,345
Because you're my best friend.

360
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:57,079
That's a good reason.

361
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,610
Boo-yah! Mad Dog lives!

362
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:18,102
Please put
your hands together...

363
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,008
for your
Middleton Mad Dog!

364
00:22:33,822 --> 00:22:35,483
They like him?

365
00:22:35,524 --> 00:22:38,493
Yeah.
Kinda surprises me, too.

366
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:51,034
And...

367
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:04,278
Bye-bye.

368
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,804
Let's keep it moving, people!

369
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:29,000
Stoppable, stow that gear.

370
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,477
Aye-aye, Mr. Barkin!

371
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:33,343
-My bad!
-Ron!

372
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:35,440
Sorry, K.P.
l am just totally psyched!

373
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:37,576
Tell me about it.
lt's been so long...

374
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,179
since l've skied without
some crazed henchmen after me.

375
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:44,214
Naked mole rat good to go.

376
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:46,318
Look, Ron.

377
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:49,296
Alan Platt.
He deserves our pity, K.P.

378
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,558
So sad.

379
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:52,190
The biggest trip
of the school year...

380
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,064
And his parents
are the chaperones.

381
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:57,594
-Humiliation Nation.
-Tragic.

382
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,334
But better him than me.

383
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:00,841
-Kimmy!
-Mom?

384
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,070
What's the sitch?
Did l leave something at home?

385
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:06,547
Not at all, honey.
Your friend Bonnie called us.

386
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:10,312
The Platts came down with
the flu at the last minute.

387
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:13,343
So we grabbed our gear,
dropped the boys at Nana's...

388
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:14,878
and high-tailed it right over.

389
00:24:14,923 --> 00:24:16,220
Wait! You don't mean--

390
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:20,751
Meet our new ski trip
chaperones! Smiles!

391
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:28,230
You know,
it just occurred to me...

392
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:30,703
some people might
find it humiliating...

393
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:33,070
to have their parents along
on a class outing.

394
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:35,871
Especially one
with a big photo spread...

395
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,070
in the yearbook.

396
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:39,579
You did this to me
on purpose, Bonnie!

397
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:41,980
You are so paranoid.

398
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:45,850
l think
your parents are...cute.

399
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:49,550
-What you got there, Dr. P.?
-My homemade snowboard.

400
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,423
-l'm ready for shreddy.
-Excuse me?

401
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,556
Dad's trying to act cool?
l'm doomed.

402
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:02,669
l know a fun travel game...

403
00:25:02,704 --> 00:25:04,399
that Kimmy used
to love on family trips.

404
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,566
When she wasn't
begging for a rest stop.

405
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:10,934
-lncredible!
-l know!

406
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:12,674
Bonnie will pay for this.

407
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:15,114
No, l mean this.
Check it out, K.P.

408
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,208
We're heading straight
into the lair of the beast.

409
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:20,243
''The Snowbeast of
Mount Middleton Makes Tracks''?

410
00:25:22,357 --> 00:25:24,757
Right. From the same
hard-hitting journalist...

411
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,987
who broke the Frog Boy story.

412
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:29,087
l was personally touched
by Frog Boy's struggle...

413
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,428
to fit into a world
that can never truly accept him.

414
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:34,264
Look at this picture.
lt could be anything.

415
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:37,100
That's why the ''Wonder''
is offering $5,000...

416
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:40,005
for a clear photo of the beast!

417
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:43,807
You don't really believe
all that hooey, Stoppable?

418
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:46,507
-Well...
-Thank you, Mr. Barkin.

419
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,981
Some of us have
real issues to deal with.

420
00:25:49,017 --> 00:25:51,178
Like helping your parents
with the sing-along?

421
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:53,551
-Here we go!
-Join in, Kimmy!

422
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:57,581
Did you know that Kim has
a beautiful singing voice?

423
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,752
99 bottles of pop on the wall

424
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:01,659
99 bottles of pop

425
00:26:01,696 --> 00:26:03,288
You take one down,
pass it around

426
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:05,822
98 bottles of pop on the wall

427
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,698
98 bottles of pop on the wall

428
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:09,669
98 bottles of pop

429
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:11,695
You take one down,
pass it around

430
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:13,798
97 bottles of pop on the wall

431
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,241
Make sure you collect
all your personal belongings.

432
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,680
Ready to find that snowbeast?

433
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:23,707
Mr. B.? l don't get it.

434
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:29,280
Stoppable, do you want
the whole class after the 5 Gs?

435
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:32,224
l gotcha.

436
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:35,453
What about Rufus?

437
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,963
Tell you what, Stoppable...

438
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:40,195
you help me get that photo
and l'll cut you in for 2% .

439
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,929
How you diwy it
with your hairless pal...

440
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:43,368
that's your business.

441
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:45,031
Deal.

442
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:46,768
Catch you later, K.P.!

443
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:48,708
Ron, where are you going?

444
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:52,042
That reminds me
of the cutest Kimmy story.

445
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,479
We're on
our first family ski trip...

446
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:55,709
Kimmy's two years old and
she takes off her clothes...

447
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,012
in the middle of the lodge.

448
00:26:57,051 --> 00:27:00,646
Mom! Not now. Not ever!

449
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:02,451
Honey, two year olds
have been known...

450
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,323
to strut around stark naked.
Am l right?

451
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,850
Absolutely.
Please...go on.

452
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:13,124
Shouldn't we have mules
or sherpas or something?

453
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:16,000
When l snow hike with Kim,
we get sherpas.

454
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,267
You're not traveling
with the pep squad today, son.

455
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:21,867
Up here,
you gotta earn your 2% .

456
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:24,377
Wait a minute.
You hear something?

457
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:25,572
Teeth chattering?
Knees knocking?

458
00:27:25,613 --> 00:27:27,376
Bladder sloshing?
That's me!

459
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:28,780
Listen!

460
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,485
Snowbeast!

461
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:39,723
-Get a move on, Stoppable!
-lt's on! lt's on!

462
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,022
Over there!

463
00:27:41,062 --> 00:27:44,930
Wait!
lt changed direction!

464
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,745
Rufus! Rufus, you OK?

465
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,282
Where's Mr. Barkin?

466
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:15,226
lt got away.

467
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:20,430
lt's coming back.

468
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,868
Calm down, Stoppable.
lt's a woman.

469
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,505
Thanks for noticing.

470
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:37,245
Well, you know,
you're obviously...

471
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:39,480
you know, female.

472
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:44,518
We thought
you were the snowbeast.

473
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,995
Not that you look beastly
in any way, ma'am.

474
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:49,656
Oh, please.

475
00:28:49,697 --> 00:28:52,564
Don't tell me you believe
that silly fairy tale!

476
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,831
-No, no.
-No, no, no.

477
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,839
l'm Amy Hall.
Pleased to meet you, Mr...

478
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:00,272
Barkin. Steve Barkin.

479
00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:03,800
-Say, Stevie...
-l prefer Steve.

480
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:06,244
That makes two of us.

481
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,044
Anyhoo, l got all
turned around up here.

482
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,608
Would you mind
leading me back to the lodge?

483
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:15,110
-Actually, we--
-Would be tickled pink.

484
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:18,148
Pink is my favorite color!

485
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:20,387
Excuse us.

486
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:22,362
What about the photos?

487
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:26,025
The photos can wait, Mr. B.
You got a lady on the line.

488
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:28,627
-Come on, Stevie.
-Stoppable...

489
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:32,127
Stevie!
The lodge awaits us!

490
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:34,641
Mr. Barkin, babe magnet.

491
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:37,371
Drop it, Stoppable.

492
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:40,278
Ma'am, please follow me.

493
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:43,147
To the ends of the earth,
Stevie.

494
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:03,832
You built your own snowboard,
Dr. Possible?

495
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:06,237
You'd be surprised what
you can cobble together...

496
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:08,242
with odds and ends
from around the space center.

497
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:09,868
l'd love to see it in action.

498
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,174
-Slow down there, Dad.
-Kimmy?

499
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:14,613
Yours is so much cooler
than everyone else's.

500
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:17,243
You don't want to bum out
the other guys, do you?

501
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:20,584
Gosh, Kimmy,
l don't want to bum anybody out.

502
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,419
Good, Dad. Real good.

503
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:26,984
ls everything OK, Kim?
You seem stressed.

504
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:28,757
Kim!

505
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:32,963
You did that on purpose!

506
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,731
Now who's paranoid, Bonnie?
lt was an accident.

507
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:41,504
-l owe you one.
-lt was nothing.

508
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,641
Find your snow monster?

509
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:46,909
How much do you know?

510
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:51,975
l'm gonna buy y-o-u
a mug of hot cocoa, Stevie.

511
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,680
That's really not necessary.

512
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:55,313
l need to get back
to the slopes.

513
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:57,483
With mini marshmallows!

514
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:01,154
Hey! An Otterfly!

515
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:04,528
That's right!
You collect Cuddle Buddies?

516
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:08,797
l've seen them at the mall.
No big.

517
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:11,896
Seen them? Kimmy went wild
for those little things.

518
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,201
l'm the past president...

519
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,175
of the Cuddle Buddy
Collectors Club.

520
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,111
lt's so nice to find
a fellow Cuddler!

521
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:22,172
You two must
have so much in common.

522
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:26,516
You meet the nicest people
at Cuddle functions.

523
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:28,249
l've never gone.

524
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:30,416
Kimmy, who's your fave?

525
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,427
Mine's Otterfly obviously.

526
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:36,055
lt was a long time ago.

527
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:38,031
What was that one
you never let me wash?

528
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:41,762
-l don't--
-Pandaroo, that's it.

529
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:43,736
You still sleep with
that little guy, don't you?

530
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:46,831
So cute. Little Pandaroo.

531
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:52,145
Kim?

532
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:55,080
Bonnie knows about Pandaroo.
Hope is lost.

533
00:31:55,116 --> 00:31:57,482
That's harsh.
Can l borrow the communicator?

534
00:31:57,518 --> 00:31:59,383
Your concern touches me.

535
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,820
Wade, what's
the snowbeast sitch?

536
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:03,323
l've got no historical
sightings...

537
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:05,484
no local legends, nothing.

538
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:08,120
-You pulled Wade in on this?
-Only if he delivers.

539
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:09,720
What were you talking about?

540
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:12,597
Not about
the ''Weekly Wonder'' reward.

541
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:14,658
Barkin has me down for 10% .

542
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,226
-Ten?
-lf l deliver.

543
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,636
Fine. Just call me
if you find anything.

544
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:19,832
Keep it.

545
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:22,069
Wade might want to share
some beasty breakthrough.

546
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:25,010
-Want to come track it?
-Don't you get it?

547
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:27,843
This weekend is now
strictly damage control.

548
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:30,510
lf l don't stay on top of
my parents every minute...

549
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:33,349
l'll never be able to show
my face in school again!

550
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:36,083
l'm in Humiliation Nation!

551
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:40,757
Let's move, Stoppable,
before that Amy woman...

552
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:43,389
force-feeds me cocoa again.

553
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:54,731
l think we're getting close.

554
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,515
Something moved.

555
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:05,883
lt didn't sound beast-sized.

556
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:11,515
lt's just a dog.

557
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:14,585
Hey, pup.
What are you doing way out here?

558
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:15,993
Cheese and crackers!

559
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,089
That's a mixed breed!

560
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:29,506
Snowbeast.

561
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:36,081
No! You naughty,
naughty beastie.

562
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,344
You shouldn't have
run off like that.

563
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:39,818
You had Mommy all worried.

564
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:44,491
Amy, in the nick of time,
you tamed the beast!

565
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:47,153
-You saved me!
-Why did it listen to her?

566
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,458
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

567
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:51,658
Why did she say ''Mommy''?

568
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:55,157
You're a clever one, Stevie.

569
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,430
Get the camera!

570
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,062
Hey, that's mine!

571
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:00,903
She wants the reward!

572
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:02,203
Or not.

573
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:09,672
Don't be a pig.

574
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:16,722
Take them to the lab!

575
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:19,055
Let me go! Let me go!

576
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,927
Ron? Mr. Barkin?
l'll get Kim.

577
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:40,672
Nice outfit, Dr. Possible.
lt's, like, retro chic.

578
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:42,238
Groovy.

579
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:46,918
l was making small talk.

580
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,478
Forgive me
if that's out of bounds.

581
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:50,854
-What do you mean?
-We'd better be going.

582
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:54,054
We wouldn't want Kimmy
to be in Humiliation Nation.

583
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,585
You heard me?

584
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,030
Smooth move, Kim.

585
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:00,897
Kim!

586
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:03,096
-Wade?
-We've got a situation.

587
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:09,437
You can't go gallivanting
all over the mountain.

588
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:11,034
lmagine what people must think.

589
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:12,238
What is this place?

590
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:15,407
My homey little
genetics engineering lab.

591
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,713
Let me show you
my favorite part.

592
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:24,713
Sweet mother of pearl.

593
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:30,662
Every Cuddle Buddy ever made!

594
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:32,359
That's a lot of plush, lady.

595
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:35,095
l collected them all,
but it wasn't enough.

596
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,602
Cookies!

597
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:39,333
-Question!
-Yes?

598
00:35:39,373 --> 00:35:42,274
What's up with the monsters?

599
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,901
l wanted more.

600
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:46,310
To go where no Cuddler
had gone before.

601
00:35:46,347 --> 00:35:48,815
Life-sized
living Cuddle Buddies!

602
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,146
That's quite a leap.

603
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:52,880
Not if you're one of the world's
foremost biogeneticists!

604
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,581
They called me DNAmy.

605
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:57,785
They said l was mad
at the Cuddle Con.

606
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:59,224
Gingersnap?

607
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:01,489
-Lady, you are--
-Special?

608
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:05,123
You are sick...and wrong!

609
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,725
You're just a meanie, Stevie!

610
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:09,963
But l can fix that.

611
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,233
Wade, try searching
the Cuddle Buddy website.

612
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:18,767
They profile all major
Cuddlers--collectors.

613
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:20,040
How'd you know that?

614
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,641
l logged on a few times.
They're a good investment.

615
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,279
Good call, Kim.

616
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:30,756
-She's a biogeneticist?
-That's not all.

617
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,281
She was kicked out
of her university...

618
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:34,556
for unorthodox
splicing experiments.

619
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:37,155
Her nickname was DNAmy.

620
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,755
An out of control geneticist.

621
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,927
l should've paid more attention
to Ron's crazed snowbeast talk.

622
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,335
We need to hurry.
ls there a satellite...

623
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,805
that can scan the mountain
for geological anomalies?

624
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,832
Natch. Hoping to find
a hidden scientific lab?

625
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,311
-lf it's not too much.
-You're on a roll.

626
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:55,338
Artificial reinforcements
in a large cavern to the north.

627
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,815
l'm there.

628
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,339
Wait! Why punish Rufus?

629
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:26,039
Barkin's the one you're mad at!

630
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,176
That's it, Stoppable!
Kiss your 2% good-bye.

631
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:34,916
We could have been
so cute together, Stevie!

632
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:37,321
Now you'll find out
what it's like...

633
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:40,588
to be genetically fused
with a hairless rodent!

634
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:46,166
You are one twisted sister!

635
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:41,080
Let them go, DNAmy,
or l'll--Pandaroo?

636
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:44,284
Superstar edition?
They only made 12 of these!

637
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:04,370
You like
Cuddle Buddies, Kimmy...

638
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:07,676
wait till you see
my genetic zipper in action!

639
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:37,333
-Rufus! You're a mutant!
-Gross.

640
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,345
Naked mole man!

641
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:42,439
My greatest
splicing success yet!

642
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:44,040
Hey, Snowy!

643
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:47,679
Looks like your mommy's
got a new favorite.

644
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,018
She doesn't care about you.

645
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,251
You're just another
collectible to her.

646
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:01,296
Stop it!
Stop it this instant!

647
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:07,834
There's room in my heart
for all of you!

648
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:28,751
Thanks, K.P.
We gotta get Rufus back.

649
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:30,763
-And Mr. Barkin.
-Him, too.

650
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:39,462
No!
These materials are unstable!

651
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:42,236
According to my readings,
the whole place is gonna blow!

652
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:45,374
Mr. Barkin, no!

653
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:47,642
Rufus, l know
you're in there, buddy.

654
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,309
lt's me!

655
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,908
That's my Rufus!

656
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:18,503
Rufus, you're OK!

657
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:20,342
And you're wearing
Barkin's clothes.

658
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,473
Then what's Mr. Barkin wearing?

659
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:26,043
Stoppable, l need pants!

660
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:31,047
Let's evacuate, people!

661
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,017
Just once, l wish the bad guy's
lair didn't blow up.

662
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:38,725
-No!
-You have to leave!

663
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:41,131
Not without my Cuddle Buddies!

664
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:59,745
-We made it!
-Great.

665
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:02,914
Now l've got to find
my parents to apologize.

666
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:06,155
You might not get the chance.

667
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:08,320
Avalanche!

668
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,092
We'll never outrun it!

669
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,937
No way!

670
00:42:17,971 --> 00:42:21,202
Get ready.
No time to stop!

671
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:23,937
Hang on.
This could get gnarly.

672
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,789
There they are!

673
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:40,349
Awesome ride, Dr. P.!

674
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:56,171
-Way to go!
-Cool!

675
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:59,872
-That was amazing!
-l could never do that!

676
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,778
Dad, you're amazing.

677
00:43:01,815 --> 00:43:03,806
Oh, no big.

678
00:43:09,322 --> 00:43:11,813
Come see me, Stevie!

679
00:43:17,864 --> 00:43:20,332
Mom, l am so sorry.

680
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,595
Don't worry, honey.

681
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:23,694
Your father and l
were teenagers once.

682
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:26,433
Sometimes we forget
what it's like.

683
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:31,172
lsn't this a sweet moment?

684
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:33,907
-Bonnie!
-Mom?

685
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:36,245
Pumpkin!

686
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:39,780
Mother,
what are you doing here?

687
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,119
l heard you kids
needed more chaperones...

688
00:43:43,156 --> 00:43:45,386
so l rushed right up.

689
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:46,619
But you can't!

690
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,221
Bon-Bon, don't go
flying off the handle.

691
00:43:50,263 --> 00:43:51,491
Bon-Bon?

692
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:54,022
lf everything
isn't just so...

693
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,695
little Bon-Bon
goes straight to pieces.

694
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:01,439
But why? Who called you?

695
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:03,500
There's too many kids
for just us to handle...

696
00:44:03,543 --> 00:44:05,340
and l figured
if Kimmy got to enjoy...

697
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:10,281
having her parents around,
why not you, too, Bonnie?

698
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:12,080
This is going to be such fun!

699
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,520
You have to introduce me
to every single one...

700
00:44:15,555 --> 00:44:18,080
of your little classmates.

701
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,786
You rock, Mom.

702
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:22,522
You rock, too, Kimmy.

703
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,406
Now, boys...

704
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,237
You said we should practice.

705
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:15,271
You also said we can't touch
the ball with our hands.

706
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:18,279
Save it for the field, boys.

707
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:20,616
-First time coaching?
-ls it that obvious?

708
00:45:20,654 --> 00:45:22,986
Your lack of protective gear
gave it away.

709
00:45:23,023 --> 00:45:24,820
Sorry!

710
00:45:28,662 --> 00:45:30,653
Would you go get them, please?

711
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:32,597
Mom, they're your kids!

712
00:45:32,632 --> 00:45:35,430
But l hate this place.
You go.

713
00:45:35,468 --> 00:45:37,163
l'll give you $5.00.

714
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:40,332
But the place reeks
of burnt pizza!

715
00:45:40,373 --> 00:45:44,332
Not the puppy dog pout!
That's mine!

716
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:47,278
OK...

717
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:50,340
but keep the engine running
for a quick getaway.

718
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:55,114
Kim! K.P.!

719
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:58,691
Ron?
What are you doing here?

720
00:45:58,725 --> 00:46:00,056
l come for the games...

721
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:01,924
but l stay for
the burnt pizza smell.

722
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:07,958
-l win!
-Rematch!

723
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:09,935
Have you seen
my dad and the tweebs?

724
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:13,162
Give me that ball right now!

725
00:46:13,206 --> 00:46:15,003
l'm not just saying this
as your father...

726
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,509
but as your coach!

727
00:46:17,544 --> 00:46:19,068
Come here!

728
00:46:23,049 --> 00:46:24,880
Dad!

729
00:46:26,353 --> 00:46:29,811
Kimmy, the team needs a coach
until l'm back on my feet.

730
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:31,380
You cannot be serious!

731
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:33,619
l don't know
the first thing about soccer!

732
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,787
What's to know?
You're wonderful with children.

733
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:43,228
Those are not children!

734
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,261
l'm not even
sure if they're human!

735
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:48,102
Wade, what's the sitch?

736
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:51,269
Trouble at J.P. Bearymore's
Pizza Party-torium.

737
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:54,041
Tell me about it.
My dad's totally out of action.

738
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,277
No, Kim! After you guys left,
they were robbed!

739
00:47:00,086 --> 00:47:02,714
Somebody stole J.P. Bearymore!

740
00:47:02,756 --> 00:47:05,281
At least you still
have the backup band.

741
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:08,226
The bear was totally
carrying those hacks.

742
00:47:08,261 --> 00:47:11,822
J.P. is the state-of-the-art
in animatronic musicians.

743
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:17,864
Whoever those thieves are,
they're not subtle.

744
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:25,642
No, no. A villainous laugh
needs to be deep...

745
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,307
from the diaphragm.
Try again.

746
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:30,816
The laugh is not important.
l have the bear.

747
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,078
Yes, but why stop at the bear?

748
00:47:32,118 --> 00:47:35,144
l have no use for the otter
and the beaver was off-key.

749
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:38,589
Junior, a true arch-villain...

750
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:41,150
doesn't leave behind
a perfectly good otter.

751
00:47:41,194 --> 00:47:42,684
l thought
this was my crime to run!

752
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:46,165
Of course. Provided
you make sound decisions.

753
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:48,463
Fine. l will get the otter.

754
00:47:48,501 --> 00:47:50,765
-And the beaver.
-Whatever.

755
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:54,765
That bear is quite
a piece of work, Kim--

756
00:47:54,808 --> 00:47:56,537
state-of-the-art
inside and out.

757
00:47:56,576 --> 00:47:59,511
OK, so we need to think
about who might want it.

758
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,776
-lndustrial rivals?
-Other animal bands?

759
00:48:02,982 --> 00:48:06,247
Pizzapotamus! No!

760
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:09,778
-Ron!
-Not Pizzapotamus!

761
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:19,321
lt's Senor Senior, Sr.
and Senor Senior, Jr.!

762
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:21,800
Looks like we picked up
a few passengers--

763
00:48:21,835 --> 00:48:24,030
Kim Possible and
her sidekick-type friend...

764
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,503
whose name escapes me.

765
00:48:25,538 --> 00:48:28,098
What is your name again,
young man?

766
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:31,110
lt's Ron! Ron Stoppable!

767
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:32,372
That's right.

768
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:33,936
l will smash them
into a building.

769
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,379
Junior, no!

770
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:37,042
l do not like this at all.

771
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:39,017
You cannot
simply smash your foe.

772
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:41,043
-Why not?
-Give your foe a chance.

773
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:42,247
To do what?

774
00:48:42,288 --> 00:48:44,654
To shimmy up the cable
and try something heroic.

775
00:48:44,691 --> 00:48:48,218
-Shimmy up the cable.
-You're closer. You shimmy.

776
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:50,695
Have you seen me shimmy?
lt's not pretty.

777
00:48:57,537 --> 00:48:58,868
Hang on!

778
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:10,946
Come on.
We don't have much time.

779
00:49:10,984 --> 00:49:14,078
They're in a helicopter.
We'll never catch them.

780
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,348
Who's talking about them?

781
00:49:15,388 --> 00:49:17,117
Bueno Nacho
closes in three minutes!

782
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:19,887
-l'm starving!
-Yeah!

783
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:33,196
-K.P., this can't go on.
-What?

784
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:37,198
Studying in study hall!
lt sets a bad precedent.

785
00:49:37,243 --> 00:49:38,870
Don't worry.
lt's not schoolwork.

786
00:49:38,912 --> 00:49:42,473
-The Senior and Junior case?
-Wrong again.

787
00:49:42,515 --> 00:49:44,710
Soccer.

788
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:47,276
Or as the English
call it--football.

789
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,787
You know a lot about soccer?

790
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:50,915
Oh, yes.
l will teach you all l know.

791
00:49:50,957 --> 00:49:52,117
Let's see...

792
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,126
soccer is the world's
most popular sport.

793
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,923
You can't touch the ball
with your hands...

794
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:58,590
-Unless you're the goalie.
-Really? That's it.

795
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:01,225
The student has surpassed
the teacher. Nap-time.

796
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:08,073
Keep 'em coming, Ron.

797
00:50:16,749 --> 00:50:19,411
-Are you the goalie?
-No, Kaitlin is.

798
00:50:19,452 --> 00:50:21,511
Then no hands.

799
00:50:21,554 --> 00:50:22,953
Cool! Let me try.

800
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:25,014
Wait.
Your approach is all wrong.

801
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:27,117
Like this.

802
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,060
Take it, Tim!

803
00:50:29,095 --> 00:50:30,323
l got it, Kaitlin!

804
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:31,887
Here's a give-and-go.

805
00:50:31,931 --> 00:50:33,558
See? You pass it
right back to the person...

806
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,727
who passed it to you.

807
00:50:35,768 --> 00:50:38,498
l could've done that myself.

808
00:50:38,538 --> 00:50:40,529
There's no ''l'' in ''team.''

809
00:50:40,573 --> 00:50:42,541
And there's no fun in soccer.

810
00:50:42,575 --> 00:50:44,509
Not with her hogging the ball.

811
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:46,705
Let me show you.
Do it like this.

812
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:55,350
Junior, l do not approve
of the sign.

813
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:57,185
Your lair should be secret.

814
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:58,747
But l want people to find me.

815
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:00,759
So it is a trap. Clever boy.

816
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:02,420
Father, it is my scheme.

817
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:03,986
Yes, of course.

818
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,123
l just want to see
if it is evil enough.

819
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:07,564
Please! l assure you...

820
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,864
it will be the greatest
achievement of my life.

821
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:11,461
Greatest evil achievement.

822
00:51:11,504 --> 00:51:13,699
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

823
00:51:20,113 --> 00:51:23,344
Keep it moving.
Use both sides of your feet.

824
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:25,783
Here, l'll show you.

825
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:29,413
-ls she scaring you, too?
-Oh, yeah.

826
00:51:29,455 --> 00:51:31,423
l am so glad
l'm just the equipment--

827
00:51:31,457 --> 00:51:33,391
Equipment manager!

828
00:51:35,662 --> 00:51:37,323
Blow these up! Hurry!

829
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:45,130
l wasn't ready! Do-over!

830
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:47,196
There are no do-overs
in a real game.

831
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,573
Come on, hustle!

832
00:52:07,493 --> 00:52:09,188
Heads up! Survey the field!

833
00:52:09,228 --> 00:52:11,059
Keep the ball moving!

834
00:52:12,265 --> 00:52:13,596
What's the sitch, Wade?

835
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:15,601
-How's the coach thing going?
-Getting there.

836
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:17,694
Visualize goals!

837
00:52:17,737 --> 00:52:20,604
Visualize Senor Senior, Sr.

838
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,437
What did you say?

839
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:24,102
Triple-S has struck again.

840
00:52:24,143 --> 00:52:27,112
Listen up, team!
l've gotta jet.

841
00:52:27,146 --> 00:52:29,046
Yeah!

842
00:52:29,082 --> 00:52:33,348
That kind of attitude says
extra header practice.

843
00:52:33,386 --> 00:52:35,217
Now remember--hustle!

844
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:38,189
l'll be back as soon as l can.

845
00:52:38,224 --> 00:52:40,385
That's not hustle.

846
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:46,488
Our company has invented
a revolutionary new gas...

847
00:52:46,532 --> 00:52:50,059
that burns 100 times
brighter than neon.

848
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:51,934
Doesn't look so bright to me.

849
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:57,101
lt's quite bright, isn't it?

850
00:52:57,143 --> 00:52:59,475
Not as bright as
the stolen prototypes...

851
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:01,639
but very bright all the same.

852
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:03,979
What makes you think
Senor Senior stole it?

853
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:05,484
They left this.

854
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:09,215
Good day...

855
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:11,450
unless you're watching this
after dark...

856
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:13,152
in which case,
good evening.

857
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:15,023
So Junior.

858
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:17,188
You are no doubt wondering
why we have taken...

859
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,492
your super-neon--

860
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:19,930
What are you doing?

861
00:53:19,966 --> 00:53:21,194
A video calling card.

862
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:23,259
lt will be
my villainous trademark.

863
00:53:24,837 --> 00:53:27,135
Have you studied
villainy at all, Junior?

864
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:29,141
Father!

865
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:31,803
-What do you make of it?
-Family issues.

866
00:53:31,844 --> 00:53:33,402
My eyes!

867
00:53:39,852 --> 00:53:42,946
-How's it going, Kimmy?
-Usual villain stuff.

868
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:45,719
l meant the soccer practice.

869
00:53:45,758 --> 00:53:46,952
Uh-oh.

870
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:58,768
OK, team.
That should be about enough.

871
00:54:01,507 --> 00:54:03,702
Same time tomorrow.

872
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:06,708
My legs hurt.

873
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:09,146
l can't even feel my legs.

874
00:54:09,182 --> 00:54:11,616
How are my star players?

875
00:54:11,651 --> 00:54:13,642
You two better
get a good night's sleep.

876
00:54:13,686 --> 00:54:15,620
Tomorrow we go full contact.

877
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:18,522
lsn't soccer
pretty much no contact?

878
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:20,651
That's what
the other teams think.

879
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:26,165
You get one chimorito,
and they give you...

880
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:28,724
a dozen little packets
of Diablo sauce!

881
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:31,794
You can't possibly use
all this sauce.

882
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:35,296
Somewhere there's a landfill
of unopened hot sauce...

883
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:38,003
and someday l'm gonna find it.

884
00:54:38,044 --> 00:54:40,012
lf l put on a uniform...

885
00:54:40,046 --> 00:54:41,741
l could pass as
a tall ten-year-old.

886
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:44,272
What do you think?

887
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:45,477
l think it's just a game...

888
00:54:45,518 --> 00:54:47,418
and your natural
competitive Kimness...

889
00:54:47,453 --> 00:54:50,251
has taken you
to a very dark place.

890
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:52,052
The team needs an edge.

891
00:54:52,091 --> 00:54:54,753
-You're the coach!
-l'm a hands-on coach.

892
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:59,356
Hands-on soccer...interesting.

893
00:55:00,566 --> 00:55:04,866
Wade, do you think
it's wrong to help my team?

894
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:07,395
-Like fund-raising?
-Like playing forward.

895
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,340
Then l'd have to say yes.

896
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,172
So...what's the sitch?

897
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:14,202
Watch this. Junior calls it
his video calling card.

898
00:55:16,716 --> 00:55:20,777
Do you love the nightlife?
Love to boogie?

899
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,754
Then come on over
to Club Lair...

900
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:26,190
the globe's newest
and hottest disco.

901
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:29,558
-He loves the camera.
-And the camera loves him.

902
00:55:29,595 --> 00:55:32,758
Club Lair is conveniently
located in Europe.

903
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,994
Drive a little, party a lot.

904
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:39,529
They shouldn't be hard to find.

905
00:55:39,572 --> 00:55:41,233
Yeah, the map helps.

906
00:55:46,779 --> 00:55:48,804
-What?
-l did not say a thing.

907
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:50,748
You did. You said, ''Hmm.''

908
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,842
l did not mean to say, ''Hmm.''

909
00:55:52,885 --> 00:55:55,683
lt is your evil disco, not mine.

910
00:55:55,721 --> 00:55:58,121
Good. Now, ready...

911
00:55:58,157 --> 00:56:01,251
steady...go!

912
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:12,967
Yes, very nice.
But where is the villainy?

913
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:17,499
Father, please!
l want to do this on my own.

914
00:56:22,148 --> 00:56:24,582
Thanks for the ride,
Mr. Blumberg.

915
00:56:24,617 --> 00:56:26,448
l owe you one, Kim.
l never would've...

916
00:56:26,485 --> 00:56:28,180
gotten around
the world in 80 days...

917
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:30,018
if you hadn't saved me
from that hurricane.

918
00:56:30,056 --> 00:56:32,354
Anyone could've steered
a hot-air balloon...

919
00:56:32,391 --> 00:56:33,881
through gale-force winds.

920
00:56:33,926 --> 00:56:36,520
l'm just glad Ron was around
to serve as a ballast.

921
00:56:36,562 --> 00:56:39,759
This time l'm staying
inside the basket.

922
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:42,532
l hope this doesn't
take too long.

923
00:56:42,568 --> 00:56:45,196
l promised the team
l'd do power drills today.

924
00:56:45,238 --> 00:56:47,536
Power drills?
That sounds harsh.

925
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:49,165
No pain, no gain.

926
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,104
Kim, the team wanted me
to talk to you...

927
00:56:55,147 --> 00:56:57,206
about your coaching technique.

928
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,184
What about
my coaching technique?

929
00:56:59,218 --> 00:57:01,709
Too much technique,
not enough coach.

930
00:57:01,754 --> 00:57:03,312
What's that supposed to mean?

931
00:57:03,356 --> 00:57:04,823
They want to have fun, Kim.

932
00:57:04,857 --> 00:57:06,882
Winning is fun, Ron.

933
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:09,121
See?
That's your Kimness talking.

934
00:57:09,161 --> 00:57:11,391
Well, l am Kim.

935
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:12,829
lt's just a game...

936
00:57:12,865 --> 00:57:14,924
with small children...

937
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:17,595
who cry when
they see you coming!

938
00:57:17,637 --> 00:57:20,367
Fine. We'll let the team
decide when we get back.

939
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:23,336
Going down.

940
00:57:24,944 --> 00:57:27,344
So, you taught
the animals to cha-cha-cha.

941
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,610
Now tell me
your villainous scheme.

942
00:57:29,649 --> 00:57:32,482
My plan is this--
as the funny animals...

943
00:57:32,518 --> 00:57:34,145
dance to
the pounding beat...

944
00:57:34,186 --> 00:57:36,780
the crowd will be inspired
to do the same.

945
00:57:36,822 --> 00:57:41,020
-And then?
-We will party all night long!

946
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,518
Everyone will dance?
That is your evil plan?

947
00:57:44,563 --> 00:57:46,053
And...

948
00:57:46,098 --> 00:57:49,261
l will overcharge
for beverages.

949
00:57:49,302 --> 00:57:52,999
Sorry to break up the party,
Senor Seniors.

950
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:55,234
What have they done
to Pizzapotamus?

951
00:57:56,776 --> 00:57:58,767
And where's
J.P. Bearymore's banjo?

952
00:57:58,811 --> 00:58:00,073
l'm so sorry...

953
00:58:00,112 --> 00:58:02,342
but tonight
is my grand opening.

954
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:05,908
lt would be most inconvenient
to give up now.

955
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:07,442
Did you see the thing
with the eyebrow?

956
00:58:07,486 --> 00:58:08,680
Nice touch, no?

957
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:12,122
Other than wrapping
Pizzapotamus in polyester...

958
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:13,750
this doesn't seem very evil.

959
00:58:13,793 --> 00:58:16,023
See? What did l tell you?

960
00:58:16,062 --> 00:58:17,529
l'm sorry, my friends...

961
00:58:17,563 --> 00:58:19,758
but this nightclub
is rather exclusive...

962
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:21,790
and you're not
on the guest list.

963
00:58:21,834 --> 00:58:24,803
The clever threat.
Good, Junior.

964
00:58:24,837 --> 00:58:28,295
Follow through with
a display of violent anger.

965
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:31,401
-l'm mildly put off at best.
-Throw something!

966
00:58:31,444 --> 00:58:34,470
l just had my nails buffed
for the gala opening.

967
00:58:36,315 --> 00:58:39,978
Junior, this is not a party.
This is not a disco.

968
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:42,579
This is not fooling around.

969
00:58:47,994 --> 00:58:51,486
Sunglasses indoors?
How stylish!

970
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:06,005
No longer will you interfere,
Kim Possible.

971
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:08,343
Now you are under my control.

972
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:10,406
What have you done, Father?

973
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:12,440
The intense light
of the super-neon...

974
00:59:12,485 --> 00:59:15,010
is refracted into
a hypnotic pattern...

975
00:59:15,054 --> 00:59:16,783
by the modified disco ball.

976
00:59:16,822 --> 00:59:19,052
You modified my disco ball?

977
00:59:19,091 --> 00:59:23,323
But now they're standing still.
Everyone must dance!

978
00:59:29,035 --> 00:59:30,662
Gotta dance.

979
00:59:30,703 --> 00:59:33,103
Can't stop dancing.

980
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:35,107
Must boogie. Oh, yeah!

981
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:37,132
Did l not mention
that the hypnotic victim...

982
00:59:37,176 --> 00:59:39,474
responds to
the first suggestion given?

983
00:59:39,512 --> 00:59:41,036
They dance well
for hypnotized people.

984
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,809
Junior, now is not the time!

985
00:59:42,848 --> 00:59:45,282
Europe's elite
will be here in a few hours.

986
00:59:45,317 --> 00:59:48,514
Yes...to get down
with their bad selves.

987
00:59:48,554 --> 00:59:51,182
No, to be hypnotized pawns...

988
00:59:51,223 --> 00:59:53,657
in our plan
to take over everything.

989
00:59:53,692 --> 00:59:55,057
But that is not my plan!

990
00:59:55,094 --> 00:59:56,584
lt is now.

991
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:06,468
-Ready?
-Whatever.

992
01:00:06,505 --> 01:00:08,496
This is no longer my party.

993
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:10,566
Junior, you can party
all you want...

994
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:12,668
when we control everything.

995
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:14,178
l don't want to control.
l just want to--

996
01:00:14,213 --> 01:00:17,671
No! Do not speak
the ''D'' word.

997
01:00:17,716 --> 01:00:22,176
Ambassador, so pleased
you could make it.

998
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:30,528
The crowd
is starting to perk up.

999
01:00:30,563 --> 01:00:33,088
Not for long.

1000
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:51,339
Hello. Europe.

1001
01:00:51,383 --> 01:00:53,647
This is Senor Senior, Sr.

1002
01:00:53,686 --> 01:00:58,521
l am in command of a disco
filled with fabulous VlPs.

1003
01:00:58,557 --> 01:01:02,721
Can you speak up, sir?
The music is awfully loud.

1004
01:01:02,761 --> 01:01:05,889
ln exchange for these
very important persons...

1005
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:10,493
l demand that you name me
King of Everything!

1006
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:13,903
l'll have someone get back
to you on this.

1007
01:01:16,876 --> 01:01:19,276
Kim? Kim!

1008
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:25,641
Can't talk...dancing.

1009
01:01:25,684 --> 01:01:27,083
Oh, my gosh!

1010
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:34,122
A hypnotic disco ball?

1011
01:01:35,494 --> 01:01:36,893
Help!

1012
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:38,920
Help is on the way, Rufus.

1013
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:50,271
Aw, man!

1014
01:01:52,878 --> 01:01:54,175
Now!

1015
01:01:57,449 --> 01:01:59,110
You rock, Wade.

1016
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:02,914
Let's get this blackmail
over with...

1017
01:02:02,955 --> 01:02:05,014
so the party can start.

1018
01:02:05,057 --> 01:02:06,354
Patience, my son.

1019
01:02:06,392 --> 01:02:08,758
We are on the verge
of being royalty.

1020
01:02:08,794 --> 01:02:11,160
Fine. Whatever.
Then we can all--

1021
01:02:11,197 --> 01:02:12,528
Don't say it!

1022
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:15,659
Sorry, Seniors.
Cancel the coronation.

1023
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:18,397
Kim Possible.
You are so resourceful...

1024
01:02:18,437 --> 01:02:20,769
unlike some people
l could mention.

1025
01:02:20,806 --> 01:02:22,899
Always the put-downs!
But where is the praise?

1026
01:02:22,942 --> 01:02:26,105
-Where, Father?
-Now is not the time, Junior.

1027
01:02:26,145 --> 01:02:28,978
Senor Senior sounds like
a certain soccer coach l know.

1028
01:02:29,014 --> 01:02:31,505
Does he have
too much Kimness now, too?

1029
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:34,246
Not exactly.
He's just a control freak.

1030
01:02:34,286 --> 01:02:38,347
You're...well...
Wow, that's weird.

1031
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:39,914
You know, Kim Possible...

1032
01:02:39,959 --> 01:02:43,360
the disco ball is not
the only thing l modified.

1033
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:51,369
J.P. Bearymore's gone rogue!

1034
01:02:51,403 --> 01:02:53,701
First they take his banjo,
now this?

1035
01:02:59,245 --> 01:03:01,839
Attack, my robotic animal pawns.

1036
01:03:08,554 --> 01:03:10,681
Not Pizzapotamus!

1037
01:03:10,723 --> 01:03:13,123
Ron, we can't let
those innocent people get hurt.

1038
01:03:13,158 --> 01:03:15,422
Not to mention
us innocent people!

1039
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:18,521
Can you hack into the system
controlling the animals?

1040
01:03:18,564 --> 01:03:20,293
Kim, it's
the most sophisticated...

1041
01:03:20,332 --> 01:03:22,027
computer system l've ever seen.

1042
01:03:22,067 --> 01:03:23,796
lt's a banjo-playing bear.

1043
01:03:23,836 --> 01:03:25,497
They took his banjo!

1044
01:03:25,537 --> 01:03:27,528
l can't hack the bear.
Let me try the beaver.

1045
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:32,171
Father has made my party
a major drag.

1046
01:03:32,211 --> 01:03:33,940
Everybody dance!

1047
01:03:38,317 --> 01:03:40,945
Junior, what have you done?

1048
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:45,220
l'm in!

1049
01:03:49,061 --> 01:03:51,427
Kim, l took out
the otter and the beaver.

1050
01:03:51,463 --> 01:03:53,761
-Sweet, Wade!
-Kim!

1051
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:01,005
Help!

1052
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,565
Bear! Bear! Bear!

1053
01:04:26,598 --> 01:04:27,895
l'll be right down!

1054
01:04:27,933 --> 01:04:30,231
No, Coach Possible...

1055
01:04:30,269 --> 01:04:32,499
this is my ball!

1056
01:04:47,786 --> 01:04:49,117
Goal!

1057
01:04:51,423 --> 01:04:54,358
This is the last time
l let you run the show.

1058
01:04:54,393 --> 01:04:55,621
lf you had let me run it...

1059
01:04:55,661 --> 01:04:58,687
none of this
would've happened.

1060
01:04:58,731 --> 01:05:01,063
Nice hustle.

1061
01:05:09,842 --> 01:05:11,309
l hate it when they get away.

1062
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:13,038
Let's go.

1063
01:05:13,078 --> 01:05:16,309
l've gotta do
some hands-off coaching.

1064
01:05:22,421 --> 01:05:23,581
Good shot!

1065
01:05:23,622 --> 01:05:25,988
Next time, try for
the other team's goal!

1066
01:05:26,024 --> 01:05:28,049
You got it!

1067
01:05:28,093 --> 01:05:30,789
The important thing
is that they're having fun.

1068
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:33,354
-l'm glad you see that now.
-Whatever.

1069
01:05:33,399 --> 01:05:35,196
You'd better perk up.
You're the coach.

1070
01:05:35,234 --> 01:05:36,633
Not anymore, Dr. P.

1071
01:05:36,668 --> 01:05:38,533
While Kim was learning
to let go...

1072
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:40,538
the team let her go.

1073
01:05:40,572 --> 01:05:43,370
-Who's coaching, then?
-The guy with the banjo.

1074
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:46,712
Way to go, team!
Kick that ball! Way to go!

1075
01:06:13,639 --> 01:06:17,336
Who is that,
that freaky thing?

1076
01:06:17,376 --> 01:06:21,506
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

1077
01:06:21,547 --> 01:06:22,946
Come on, y'all...

1078
01:06:22,981 --> 01:06:25,279
Nice guy.

1079
01:06:25,317 --> 01:06:28,718
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

1080
01:06:33,992 --> 01:06:35,755
Boo-yah!

1081
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,191
Come on and listen
to the mole rat.

1082
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:49,033
Hit it!

1083
01:06:49,074 --> 01:06:51,235
Yo, listen up,
have a holla from Ron

1084
01:06:51,276 --> 01:06:53,437
''Naked Mole Rap''
is the name of the song

1085
01:06:53,479 --> 01:06:55,174
Here's the story
in all its glory

1086
01:06:55,214 --> 01:06:56,909
Ain't hidin' nothin',
y'all know what the truth is

1087
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:58,610
How Ron met Rufus

1088
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,515
Never heard a cat bark,
never heard a puppy purr

1089
01:07:00,552 --> 01:07:02,452
My dad's allergic
to every kind of fur

1090
01:07:02,488 --> 01:07:04,456
So l searched for
hairless pets on the internet

1091
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:07,391
Saw a jpeg of a pink thing,
gonna need sunscreen

1092
01:07:07,426 --> 01:07:09,758
What is that,
that freaky thing?

1093
01:07:09,795 --> 01:07:12,059
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

1094
01:07:12,097 --> 01:07:14,122
Come on, y'all,
let the girlies sing

1095
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:17,101
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

1096
01:07:17,135 --> 01:07:18,864
What is that,
that freaky thing?

1097
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:21,168
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

1098
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:23,299
Hey, wait,
l can't hear the girls sing

1099
01:07:23,342 --> 01:07:25,572
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

1100
01:07:25,611 --> 01:07:27,579
l heard Smarty-Mart
was havin' a sale

1101
01:07:27,613 --> 01:07:29,945
On a hairless pink rodent
with a long skinny tail

1102
01:07:29,982 --> 01:07:32,314
lt seemed to me
this could be a solution

1103
01:07:32,351 --> 01:07:34,478
The perfect pet for my dad's
sensitive constitution

1104
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,351
So the manager
came to open the cage

1105
01:07:36,388 --> 01:07:38,151
He said, ''You know,
this pet's hairless''

1106
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:40,420
l said l couldn't care less,
handed him to me and said

1107
01:07:40,459 --> 01:07:42,518
''Be careful, don't drop it,
and do you want this cage?''

1108
01:07:42,561 --> 01:07:44,324
''No, l'll keep him
in my pocket.''

1109
01:07:44,363 --> 01:07:46,228
What is that,
that freaky thing?

1110
01:07:46,265 --> 01:07:48,563
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

1111
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,795

1113

Yes, that's right,

1115
01:07:57,709 --> 01:07:59,836
l'm goin' to buy me

1116
01:07:59,878 --> 01:08:02,005
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

1117
01:08:04,783 --> 01:08:06,250
Psyche!

1118
01:08:08,387 --> 01:08:10,878
Super-freaky! Psyche!

1119
01:08:13,325 --> 01:08:15,725
Guitar, baby!

1120
01:08:15,761 --> 01:08:18,025
What are we missin' here?

1121
01:08:18,063 --> 01:08:20,395
Rufus, the naked mole rat

1122
01:08:38,016 --> 01:08:40,507
Can l get a boo-yah?

1123
01:08:40,552 --> 01:08:43,385
Can l get a boo-yah?

1124
01:08:43,422 --> 01:08:45,720

And smile for the camera,
say cheese

1130
01:08:56,868 --> 01:08:59,098
We go to Bueno Nacho,

1131
01:08:59,137 --> 01:09:01,605

Rufus in my pocket,
you can't stop it

1133
01:09:03,575 --> 01:09:06,066
Can't top it, don't drop it,
you might just pop it

1134
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:08,136
Rufus and Ron Stoppable
