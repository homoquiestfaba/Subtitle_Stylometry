A shoe like that needs a fancy table to go under.

it'll be Parson Maybold. You mark my words.

44
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,293

00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,338
It took four of us to get it
from the cart to the parsonage.

46
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,775
- What was in the box, Reuben?
- He didn't say, and I thought it impolite to ask.

47
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,041
But more than once he glanced from that box
to her lodgings with a gleam in his eye.

be utilised in the classroom, however.

To our enormous good fortune,
and to the glory of God,

152
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:21,830

153
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,206
which is to be installed in the church.

154
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,006

157

what's in the box now, Reuben.

160
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,924
It happened at Flintcomb Ash.
It happened at Longpuddle.

161
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,369

that was warmer than Christianity asked for.

Let's not get agitated, my sonnies.

165
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,978
I'm sure when the parson knows
how we feel, he'll think differently.

166
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,317
- ROBERT: Tell him now, Reuben.
- No. Now is not the place.

167

I'll ask him and Miss Day to our party tonight.

168
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,759
That should do it.

169
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,055
- MAYBOLD: Merry Christmas, children.
- Merry Christmas.

170
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,859
Now run along, I'd like to speak with Miss Day.

171
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,429
How did you enjoy the sermon, Miss Day?

172
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,407
Very much, Mr Maybold.
There was one small thing.

173
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,972
I had assumed
that the congregation knew about the harmonium.

174
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:39,006
No, no. It was my little Christmas present to them.

175
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,545
I would hate to be seen as the person

176
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,557
who came newly to the village
and, well, threw out the choir.

177
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,186
Think nothing of it, Miss Day. The men will be
delighted to put down their fiddles

178
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,857
and join their wives and children in the pews.
Isn't that so, Mr Dewy?

179
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:58,563
You have no objection to the arrival
of a fine harmonium and Miss Day's playing of it?

180
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,965
Well, sir, the thing is,
not mincing up a man's words and all, but...

181
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,273
No, of course you don't.
You a man of music and all.

182
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:10,144
I'm sure Miss Day's playing
will make us known throughout the county.

183
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,777
When I've properly learnt to play it, sir.

184
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,046
Party.

185
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,318
I beg your pardon?

186
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,557
Party.

187
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:25,062
Er... what he's trying to say, sir,
is that you and Miss Day

188
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,089
would be most welcome
at our small Christmas celebration tonight.

189
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,932
Indeed, it would be an honour.

190
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,302
- Well, I...
- Thank you, Mr...

191
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,603
His name is Dick Dewy, miss.

192
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,473
I shall very much look forward to that, Mr Dewy.

193
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,409

194
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,640

(STAMMERING)

196
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,883
- As will I, Mr Dewy. Thank you.
- Sir.

197
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,661
Come in, Father. Come in. Sit by the fire.

198
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,966
Stop your fussing, Fancy. I'm fine. I'm fine.

199
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,738
I'm a man of the country, Fancy.

200
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,840
It's in my blood.

201
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,241
You wait until you're well again.

202
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,281
You and I both know that may never be.

203
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,408
Please don't talk like that.

204
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,889
Tell me about the party.

205
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,993
Mr Dewy has invited me
to his house tonight for some dancing.

206
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,722
Dewy? The carrier?

207
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:37,125
You should wait for a better offer
to make your first appearance in public.

208
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,692
A better offer?

209
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,706
Mellstock may only be a small place, Fancy,

210
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,867
and it's not what I wish for you.

211
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,004
I'm quite content.

212
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,240
How can you be?

213
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,216
You, an educated young woman,
ready to spread your wings,

214
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,550
stuck in a village school
to be near your ailing father.

215
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,250
But there are men of means
living in a place like this.

216
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,317
Mr Shinar, for instance.

217
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,919
Well, I believe Mr Shinar is going to the party.

218
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,659
Well, why didn't you say so, girl?

219
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,702
Mr Shinar is a man of considerable affluence.

220
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,602
You should be getting back, getting ready.

221
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,999
I've bought you a Christmas present.

222
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,940
The only present I want from you

223
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,570
is to see you married and married well.

224
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,641
There.

225
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,846
This could be my last Christmas.

226
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,112
Father.

227
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:31,553
But I won't go
until I see you embrace your destiny.

228
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,560
Fancy Day.

229
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,635
I promised your mother that
on her last day on earth.

230
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,233
You make me sound like some exotic butterfly.

231
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,733
That's exactly what you are.

232
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,076
You marry well, my child...

233
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,013
and let your father die a contented man.

236
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,898
- Elias!
- Oh, here he is.

237
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,650
- Miss Day.
- Mr Dewy.

238
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,329
I wondered if, in a manner of speaking,

239
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,200
I wondered if, perhaps later, if, perhaps...

240
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,568
I'd very much like to dance, Mr Dewy.

241
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,754
Your feet are more articulate
than your tongue, Mr Dewy.

242
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,127
I like to dance, Miss Day. 'Tis true.

243
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,493
It was unfortunate this morning in church.

244
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,436
I didn't intend to come here
and cause any trouble.

245
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,434
I'm sure we all know that.

246
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,943
So you'll still speak to me after the choir is gone?

247
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,206
I shall certainly consider it.

248
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,052
Some cider, sir?

249
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,355
Oh.

250
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,860
Thank you.

251
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,489
There's been a misunderstanding, sir.

252
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:57,365
About the choir and that thing
you are about to replace it with.

253
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,495
Change can be painful, I don't deny it.

254
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,836

and let that be an end to it.

Some cordial, perhaps?

257
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,616
- What are you having, Mr Dewy?
- A drop of Father's best cider.

258
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,451
Then I shall have the same. Thank you.

259
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,220

of Exeter, Miss Day.

Yes.

261

They're simple people, but kind. And generous.

262
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,300
Well, I think we've put in an appearance,
which is the main thing.

263
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,997
- Shall I accompany you home, Miss Day?
- I...

264
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,471
- It's my dance, I believe, Miss Day.
- Mr Shinar.

265
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,600
I was just about to escort Miss Day home.

266
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,304
Nonsense. The night is young.
You get off, Maybold.

267
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,244
I'll escort the lady home.

268
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,338
I'd be happy to walk Miss Day home.

269
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,646
I said I'd do it, young Dewy, and I shall.

270
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,245
Come, Miss Day, and do try not to step on my feet.

Waste not, want not.

00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,775
SHINAR: So the farm next door to ours
came up for sale and I bought it.

273
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:25,880
Oh, everyone said I was mad to do it,
but I borrowed every last penny I could.

274
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,521
Then, two years later,
I bought the farm on t'other side.

They don't call me mad no more.

Leastways, not to my face.

You're obviously very good at business.

278
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,232
I am. If there's a man between
Melchester and Casterbridge

279
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,207
who can better me in business,
I've yet to meet him.

It's filled my every waking
and sleeping hour, Miss Day.

281

Thank you for walking me home, Mr Shinar.

282
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,008
I have everything a man could want.

283
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,056
A big house. The best food and wine.

284
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,853
More money than I can shake a stick at.

285
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,486
But there's a price you pay
for filling your days with business.

286
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,963
What's that, Mr Shinar?

287
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,101
A lack of wife.

288

Nonsense. You merely need
more discipline and less emotion.

the choir ought to be given a bit more time,

00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,792
You know my father, Geoffrey Day.

345
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,270
Welcome, Mr Dewy. Forgive me if I don't get up.

346
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,637
Mr Dewy, as I live and breathe.

347
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,740
Mr Shinar.

348
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,270
Well, sit down, sit down, Dick. I'll get you a plate.

349
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,283
Superb piece of lamb, Mr Shinar.

350
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,152
Very kind of you to share it with us.

351
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,063
One sheep less, Mr Day,
'tis of no consequence to me.

352
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,790
Father's right, Mr Shinar, you're very kind.

353
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,764
Nonsense.

354
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,102
Give the boy some wine, Fancy.

355
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,945
'Tis from France.

356
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,580
Care of Mr Shinar.

357
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:31,621
A rather fetching drop of Bordeaux,
though I say so myself.

358
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,839
Best stick with your father's cider, eh, Dick?

359
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,739
FANCY: You must forgive him

360
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:57,043
if my father is a little
overenthusiastic about Mr Shinar.

361
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,742
DICK: It's his own house. He can like who he likes.

362
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:03,219
My father used to be a gamekeeper
on the Duke of Yalbury's estate.

363
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,223
He fell in love with the niece
of his employer and he married her.

364
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,953
DICK: Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Smart.

365
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,425
Your mother?

366
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,193
She was cut off without a penny or a kind word.

367
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,561
She died two years later.

368
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:20,094
My father always blamed himself
for dragging her down.

369
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,406
He's made it his life's work
to see me married well.

370
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,903
What are your thoughts on Mr Shinar?

371
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,571
They're private, is what they are.

372
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,173
Get on.

373
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,487
All done, Miss Day.

374
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:47,463
I suppose you should call me Fancy now
as we're friends.

375
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,932
If that's what we are.

376
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,491
Wash your hands, Dick.

377
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,537
You first... Fancy.

378
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,540
- You're dirtier than me.
- But you're a lady.

379
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,019
Now the hot water's used up.

380
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,558
Cold will do.

381
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,822
If you don't object,
you could use the same water as me.

382
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,693
Not at all.

383
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,995
And to save time, I won't wait till you have done...

384
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,697
if you have no objections.

385
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,773
I don't know which are my own hands
and which are yours.

386
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,517
Towel.

387
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,792
Whoever thinks of a towel
until their hands are all wet?

388
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,557
Nobody.

389
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,655
Nobody. Where is that towel?

390
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,200
Wait, Fancy.

391
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,332
I believe you have a smut of dust
on your forehead.

392
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,498
- I do?
- Let me, 'tis soon done.

393
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,934
Hold still.

394
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,340
Dick Dewy!

395
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,417
- Is there anything further I can do for you?
- Certainly not!

396
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,678
I shall see you very soon, Miss Fancy Day.

397
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,930
FANCY: They say that Venice
is the most beautiful city

398
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,730
in the whole world.

399
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,563
- Wondrous paintings and squares and churches...
- No.

400
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,629
Shh!

401
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:48,939
Tintoretto, Piazza San Marco, the Rialto.

402
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:54,545
And there's not a cart or a street
anywhere to be seen.

403
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,284
And who can tell me why?

404
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:02,059
- ALL: Miss, miss.
- Bessy.

405
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,655
Oh, I'm a stupid old fool, Tristian.

406
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,622
Shaking like a leaf at my age.

407
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,158
Still, the prize is great.

408
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,496
Sir.

409
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,037
Right. How do I look?

410
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,719
I'm not a man for giving advice but if I was,

411
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:34,485
I'd advise you to forget Miss Fancy Day
and get on with your life.

412
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,423
Why would I forget the woman I love?

413
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,021
Love? You barely know her.
Is there an understanding between you?

414
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,125
Not yet, but there will be.

415
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,602
She's destined for greater things
than you, my son.

416
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,173
Anyway, she'll be married to Shinar
before the summer's out.

417
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,843
Who told you that?

418
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,779
Shinar's got his hat set on having her
and what Mr Shinar wants...

419
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,373
Mr Shinar gets.

420
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,778
SHINAR: So, anything you want, it shall be yours.

421
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,656
MAN: Mr Shinar.

422
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,091
Anything you want, it shall be your...

423
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:20,067
REUBEN: Don't be a child, son. Miss Day will do
what she has to do. 'Tis the way of the world.

424
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,299
- You don't know her.
- What would you have?

425
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:26,639
An educated woman like that
living as a carrier's wife in our crowded cottage,

426
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,372
with kids and dogs running about her legs?

427
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,347
'Tis not thinkable, Dick.

428
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,945
Now there's the woman for you, Dick Dewy.

429
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,546
And I hope you have the sense to see it
afore she finds another.

430
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,526
You and your father will never need...

431
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,292
You and your father...

432
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,200
You and your father will never want...

433
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,364
Beautiful.

(CLEARS THROAT)

435
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,300
Mr Shinar.

436
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,371
Go on.

437
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,940
Miss Day.

438
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,574
Lovely morning, is it not?

439
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,813
It is. It is indeed very lovely.

440
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,880
Oh!

441
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,615
Are you going for a walk?

442
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:18,287
I don't believe in aimless walking.
Don't see the point in it.

443
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,354
Not that I'd stop you, for I wouldn't.

444
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,422
You'll come and go as you please.

445
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,298
You'll not find me a harsh man in that respect.

446
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,805
I'm not sure I understand you, sir.

447
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,974
I've come here to ask for your hand
in marriage, Miss Day.

448
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,778
Marriage?

449
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,979
I know I'm maybe not the catch
you dreamed of in your girlish days,

450
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,988
but I will be a devoted and loving husband

451
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,616
and I will share everything I have with you.

452
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,625
You and your father will never want
for anything again.

453
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,823
You'll be the most important woman in the area.

454
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,903
- What say you, Fancy?
- I'm very flattered, Mr Shinar.

455
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:09,141
I see that my overture is a shock to you, Miss Day,
and I'll not force you for an answer straightaway.

456
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,876
Just give me your word
you'll think my offer over and I'll be gone.

457
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,953
I give you my word.

458
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,128
I'll make you happier
than a woman has ever been.

459
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,932
Just give me the chance.

460
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,240
Good day, Miss Day.

461
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,245
Good day, Mr Shinar.

462
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:13,769
Miss Day?

463
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,656
Just imagine. You, the mistress of Mellstock.

464
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,901
I haven't said yes yet,
only that I'll consider his proposal.

465
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,531
He will shower you with riches.

466
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,505
Silk dresses from London. Perfumes from Paris.

467
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,144
Diamonds and emeralds and rubies
by the cartload.

468
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,683
Stop it.

469
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,522
Is he a good man?

470
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,291
I believe he is, yes.

471
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,192
Hard when he wants to be, for sure,

472
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,927
but you don't get to do
what he's done without breaking a few eggs.

473
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,631
But they say he is kind beneath the gruffness.

474
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,376
How's Dick? I haven't seen him in an age.

475
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,841
That's because you avoid him, miss.

476
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,585
I think he may have exaggerated
my affection for him.

477
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:33,251
He's a little lovelorn, I'd say,
since he heard about Mr Shinar.

478
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:38,952
Still, Father hopes he and Anne Roebuck
will be married before the year's out.

479
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,057

482
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,292
- You're avoiding me, Fancy.
- Hardly, Mr Dewy.

483
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,268
Back to Mr Dewy.

484
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,329
If you have something to say to me,
I'd rather you said it to my face.

485
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,533
I have nothing to say to you, Mr Dewy.

486
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,600
Fancy, I've missed you.

487
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:30,044
Please don't talk to me in such a way.
If I gave you hope, then I apologise.

488
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,514
I want no apology for a kiss.
I want your honesty...

489
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,347
- Miss Day.
- Mr Shinar.

490
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,555
Mr Dewy, would you mind leaving
Mr Shinar and I alone for a moment?

491
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,456
Not at all, Miss Day.

492
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,762
I... Oh.

493
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,929
I was wondering if you'd had time
to think about my offer.

494
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,903
- I've thought about it, of course.
- No hurry, lass. None at all.

495
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:00,644
I don't want you doing anything against your
will, but I never was very good at waiting.

496
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,406
You're very kind.

497
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,380

He has.

504
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,175
And she will say yes, do you think?

505
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:38,371
She's like her mother. She needs to squeeze
the last bit of drama out of the thing.

I fear you may have misconstrued
an innocent friendship, Mr Dewy.

512

I've not read the books you have read
but I know it was more than a friendship.

There's the passionate sort
that has no future and...

What were you doing there in the first place?

702
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:45,127
Just a walk for old time's sake.
They've moved the mantraps.

703
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,163
The doctor says it is a nasty wound
but a clean one.

704
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,495
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you like, Geoffrey.

705
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,432
You know that goes without saying.

706
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,902
Thank you, Mr Shinar. You are most kind.

707
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,665
Just glad to be of help, Miss Day.

708
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,170
Come on, boy.

709
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:05,314
When you are well, you shall come and stay
with me where I can keep an eye on you.

710
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,247
- Isn't he a fine man?
- Yes.

711
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:11,376
Without his help
I'm not sure I'd be here talking to you now.

712
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,982
He saved you from the trap?

713
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:19,623
He's a modest man.
He'd be affronted if you mention it.

714
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:24,057
Just show your gratitude
in your behaviour towards him.

715
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,024
Sunday it is, Miss Day.

716
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,623
You will fill that old place with new music.

717
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,211
- Miss Day.
- Mr Dewy. You look very smart.

718
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,052
- How is your father?
- Mr Shinar has been most kind.

719
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,612
I don't know what would have happened
to my father without him.

720
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:26,195
I'm off to Budmouth to rustle up some
new business. No peace for an ambitious man.

721
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,491
Indeed.

722
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,095
So, Sunday is to be your coming out
on the harmonium, is it?

723
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,293
It is.

724
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:36,531
I trust that the ill-will towards Mr Maybold
and his plans to better the church has receded?

725
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,871
The turkeys won't cheer 'tis Christmas
if that's what you mean.

726
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,969
I hope it goes well. I'm only sorry I won't be there.

727
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,607
You won't be in church?

728
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:48,115
I have to see a man out at Longpuddle way
on new business.

729
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,084
It is the only day he can do.

730
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,686
- I thought you cared for me just a little.
- You know I do.

731
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:59,125
- I thought you were my friend.
- More than a friend, I'd hoped.

732
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,328
Well...

733
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,899
I shall go into the lion's den on my own.

734
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,131
Good day to you, Mr Dewy.

735
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,684
There'll be other occasions, Reuben.

736
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:35,526
But not in church.
It is what it were truly meant for.

737
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,968
Are you happy, Mary?

738
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,904
What sort of a question is that, Reuben Dewy?

739
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,672
I've never been an ambitious man, I know that.

740
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,942
You're all the man I've ever wanted.

741
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,345
He's a young man in love.

742
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,885
He says things he don't mean.

743
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:14,500
I've worked with the same carrier
for nigh on 20 years.

I'll not knock another man's work, sir.
'Tis not what I'm about.

745
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:22,736
If he says what he's going to do on time,
with good grace and a fine price...

746
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,246
Well, he has been a bit over-busy
this last year or so.

747
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,613
I've had to wait a few times for he to come free.

748
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:31,245
There's no waiting with Dewy and Sons, sir.
And that's a promise.

749
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:35,119
You came all this way on a Sunday
just to try for a bit of custom?

750
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:36,624
I did, sir.

751
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,557

You do this old place the power of good, miss.

756
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,792
Not everyone would agree with you.

757
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,495
Mr Shinar would.

758
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,961
And Mr Maybold too, I suspect.

759

760
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,439
But it's true.

761
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,911
I've watched his eyes follow you
full of puppy love.

762
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:35,983
Stop it! I will not have Parson Maybold's name
taken in vain.

- Thank you, Mr Shinar.
- Mind if I come in?

789
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,462
- It is a damp day out here.
- Yes, of course.

- And are you that ambitious man, Dick?
- I believe I am.

Though it took meeting you to make me see it.

807
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,253
It is a wet day and no mistake.

808
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,891
Forgive me, look at you standing there. You must
go home and change your things this minute.

809

It would be easier to come in
out of the rain, Fancy.

- Yes, thank you, Mr Maybold.

Just the carrier's son all covered in muck.

01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,306
And not fit to set before a parson and a rich man.

824
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:56,175
- Don't you dare make a scene here.
- I wouldn't dream of doing such a thing, Miss Day.

For a while I was blinded by your beauty,
but I now see you for what you are.

And what, pray, is that?

I would marry the lowliest maid in the county
if I loved her.

828
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:11,360
Nor money, nor learning, nor opinion of others
would force me from loving her.

- Dick, I...
- Goodbye, Miss Day.

The very thought.

Why shouldn't you wear it?

Nonsense, Susan. Put it on.

Think of all the dresses
you'll be able to afford next year, miss.

It is all over the village that Mr Shinar
will ask you to be his wife tonight.

844
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,655
And that you will say yes.

845
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,999
And does the village know
which dress I should wear?

- Fine evening, sir.

- All I get is a hand, is it?

You asked me some time ago
if I would be your wife, Mr Shinar.

and I should have told you so a long time ago.

Because if it is...

- But I do believe I know what love is, Mr Shinar.

- I have an early start.

some friends to put my name forwards,

Steady, Fancy, nothing was meant by it.

1046
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:43,745
It's a hateful, mean, gossipy little place
and I want no more of it.

It's me. Parson Maybold.

I want to be alone, Mr Maybold.

Open the door, Fancy. Please.

1054
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:38,803
I would simply like to apologise
on behalf of my congregation

1055
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:42,001
for that shameful display, Miss Day.

1056
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:45,376
You are the best thing to have happened
to this village for a generation

1057
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:46,812
and this is how they treat you.

- You have nothing to reproach yourself for, sir.
- They are simple folk.

Like beasts of the field, they are fascinated
when a peacock lives amongst them.

Forgive them.

It will ever be thus in this place.

- What are you doing here?
- I had to speak to you.

You've thought about my offer?

1091

I cannot marry you, sir.

In the morning...

I should never even have considered it.

None.

Or Rome or Paris.

When were you happiest?

1110
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:37,189
- What has that got to do with anything?
- We both know the answer.

to marry for love, like she married you for love.

straight after marrying us.

01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:36,609
He wanted to find his place in the world, Dick.
