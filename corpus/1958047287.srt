1
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:26,129
(slow music)

2
00:00:30,927 --> 00:00:32,446
(Peyton) Excuse me, sir.

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,861
Have you seen my phone?

4
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:35,011
I left it on that
wall over there.

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,933
It's got a gray phone case.

6
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:38,866
(Man) No, I'm sorry,
I haven't seen it.

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,385
Good luck in finding it.

8
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:41,524
Thank you.

9
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,289
Pardon me.

10
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:49,325
Have you seen my phone?

11
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,843
It's got a grey phone case.

12
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:51,982
No, dear.

13
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:53,260
I am sorry, I haven't.

14
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:02,786
What's wrong?

15
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,340
I think someone
stole my phone.

16
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:05,558
(Policeman) What
did it look like?

17
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:08,792
It's got a gray...
(phone dinging)

18
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,728
Want some lemonade?

19
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:15,178
Hi, two please.

20
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:19,009
Just a donation.

21
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:20,321
Oh okay, great!

22
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:21,633
Wanna put that in the jar?

23
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:26,257
Okay.

24
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:28,916
There you go.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,469
What do you say?

26
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:31,815
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,989
- Bye.
- You too.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,411
- Oh!
- Oh I'm so sorry!

29
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:42,412
So sorry!

30
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:43,607
(Woman) It'll be all right.

31
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:48,763
Hi, how much for one lemonade?

32
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:50,006
(Girl) Donations.

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,076
All right, awesome.

34
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:57,393
There you go.

35
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:58,221
Have a nice day.

36
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:59,256
Thank you, bye.

37
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,225
Thank you.

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,916
Oh, thank you so much!

39
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:05,125
That was so thoughtful.

40
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,508
Hey, are you Peyton Hawthorne?

41
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:10,785
(Peyton) Yeah, yeah I am.

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,718
Yeah, your mom and
I volunteer together

43
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:14,030
at the animal shelter.

44
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:17,689
(slow music)

45
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:22,763
(phone dinging)

46
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:37,433
(traffic whirring)

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,524
(phone dinging)

48
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,076
(gentle guitar music)

49
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:38,839
Hey, sweetie.

50
00:03:38,873 --> 00:03:39,667
How was your day?

51
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:40,702
It was fine.

52
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:48,504
(indistinct chatter)

53
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,161
- Sophie!
- Sophie!

54
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:55,072
- Should we head inside?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,167
Yeah, awesome!

56
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:58,202
Wait guys!

57
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,620
(giggling)

58
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,139
Happy birthday!

59
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:03,967
Thank you.

60
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,072
Late as always, I see.

61
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,247
- Hey Landon.
- Hey there.

62
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,628
Hey Landon, Tyler
just texted me.

63
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:10,916
He said you were supposed
to be at his house

64
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,734
like an hour ago.

65
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,011
Uh okay.

66
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,426
Tell Tyler I'll
be there in a few.

67
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:16,635
- Bye.
- (Landon) See you.

68
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,189
So where should
we put our stuff?

69
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:21,502
Uh, over there I guess.

70
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:22,917
Cool, let's go!

71
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,490
(Mom) You guys
ready for some cake?

72
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:44,732
- Sure!
- Yeah!

73
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:57,158
So what's your
wish going to be?

74
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:58,401
Can't tell you that.

75
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:06,996
My Instagram photo
is gonna be amazing.

76
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,205
You know, I lost
like 20 followers

77
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:12,933
when Instagram did its
full like bot sweep.

78
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,004
- That's terrible.
- Isn't that ridiculous?

79
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,769
I mean I didn't have very
many followers to begin with

80
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,219
so then losing more.

81
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:25,014
Don't you guys like my cake?

82
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,981
- Sure.
- Yeah, yeah.

83
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:29,743

84
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:32,849

(gentle guitar music)

88
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,909
Are you done yet?

89
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,015
(knocking on door)

90
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,051
Who's there?

91
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:04,640
It's Skylar!

92
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:05,813
(Girl) It's Skylar?

93
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:06,848
Yeah.

94
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,196
Hi.

95
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,508
Happy birthday!

96
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,475
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

97
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:15,305
So what are we gonna do?

98
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,929
Well, I was thinking we could
maybe do some board games,

99
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:21,277
like Sorry, or
Candyland or Monopoly.

100
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:22,520
Monopoly!

101
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,763
Remember your brother
when we were playing?

102
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:26,040
He like flipped over the table!

103
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:28,353
(giggling)

104
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:33,703
Mom!
(phone ringing)

105
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,395
Is that an iPhone?

106
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,326
Yeah, isn't it cool?

107
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:37,673
I'm getting one for Christmas.

108
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:38,605
That's so not fair!

109
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,227
I have to wait til I'm 13.

110
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:41,711
Let me see that.

111
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:43,586
I saw the most hilarious
YouTube video the other day.

112
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,405
Let's see if I can find it.

113
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,268
What about Monopoly?

114
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,200
(knocking on door)

115
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:50,271
That must be Sophie!

116
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:51,306
Yeah!

117
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:01,593
(gentle guitar music)

118
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,756
This is a lame
excuse for a party.

119
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,275
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:29,483
I mean, look at you.

121
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:32,003
You're all off in
cyberspace somewhere.

122
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:34,764
You're on Instagram and
Sophie's on Snapchat.

123
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,904
Courtney's working on her blog.

124
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,666
I might as well have celebrated
my birthday by myself.

125
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,946
I know how you feel, Peyton.

126
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,912
You do?

127
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:45,947
How so?

128
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,951
I've been thinking
about this a lot lately.

129
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:50,400
Thanks to social media

130
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:53,127
I'm more connected
than I've ever been.

131
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:56,924
And yet I've never
felt so lonely.

132
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,755
I'm glad I'm not the only
one who feels this way.

133
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,274
Yeah, it's pretty
depressing all right.

134
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:05,139
So what do you
suggest we do about it?

135
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:07,739
(Mom) Pardon my
eavesdropping girls,

136
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:10,041
but it sounds like you
could all use digital detox.

137
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:14,010
What is she talking about?

138
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,194
(Courtney) She's suggesting

139
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:16,841
we give up our
screens for awhile.

140
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,773
But that would kill me.

141
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:19,015
(Courtney) Skylar, please.

142
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,223
Don't be so dramatic.

143
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:21,708
I'm not being dramatic.

144
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:25,401
I, I think I have a problem.

145
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:26,885
Go ahead, fess up.

146
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
We're all ears.

147
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,269
Okay, I will then.

148
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,583
Last night I stayed up
until four in the morning

149
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:36,619
watching YouTube videos.

150
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:40,140
And the night before that
I didn't sleep at all.

151
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:43,039
I think I'm like addicted.

152
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,317
There I said it, I'm
addicted to my phone.

153
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,458
Well then I must be too.

154
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,807
I mean, I check mine
like every five minutes.

155
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:54,982
I even sleep with it
under my pillow at night.

156
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:57,191
Peyton, you know
that's a fire hazard.

157
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:59,539
I know but I just
can't help myself.

158
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,852
Want some orange juice?

159
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:06,960
Orange juice, Courtney.

160
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,755
What does he
even mean by this?

161
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:11,067
Care to elaborate?

162
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:14,139
Clearly Andrew
misunderstood my last text.

163
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:16,038
And if I'm not mistaken,

164
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,696
I think he just
broke up with me.

165
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:22,562
Was there ever a worse
form of communication?

166
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:28,360
So about the digital detox.

167
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:30,431
If we're going to do this,
we should make a pact.

168
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,744
No screens for 24 hours.

169
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,021
What do you say?

170
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,343
But what about my
Instagram followers?

171
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,783
And my Facebook friends?

172
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,094
Come on Sophie.

173
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,278
They aren't your real friends.

174
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:40,821
(Sophie) I resent that.

175
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:42,627
Besides you're not gonna
lose all of your followers

176
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:43,962
in just one day.

177
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:48,484
Are we talking every screen?

178
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:49,899
Even my laptop?

179
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:52,315
Anything with
internet connection.

180
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,800
We can do this guys.

181
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,249
Right, we can help each other.

182
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:56,906
Okay, so we power off.

183
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:00,082
Then what, we just sit
around twiddling our thumbs?

184
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,048
Not at all.

185
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,498
We can...

186
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:04,638
- Play board games!
- Yes!

187
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:07,054
You can't be serious.

188
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,436
I'm up for a game of Monopoly.

189
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,369
Me too, I haven't
played it in ages.

190
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:13,474
Care to join us?

191
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,373
I've got some
business to attend to.

192
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,031
I'll be the cat.

193
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:19,480
Ooh, I want to be the shoe.

194
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,862
(Peyton) I'll get the top hat.

195
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:25,625
Yeah, I can be the banker.

196
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:32,217
(pieces rattling)

197
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:35,842
(giggling)

198
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:39,915
I mean, I'm not gonna judge.

199
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,574
(upbeat music)

200
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,582
(knocking on door)

201
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,112
Hey babe, you ready to go?

202
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:06,493
Just one more game.

203
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,978
But I only have an hour.

204
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,221
It'll only be a minute.

205
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,922
(phone dinging)

206
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:41,114
(Video Game Voice) Game over.

207
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:42,874
(bowl clattering)

208
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,151
What was that for?

209
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:46,015
Come on Tyler,
it's just a game.

210
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:55,749
(door creaking)

211
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:58,131
(slow music)

212
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:12,973
- Hey.
- (Cashier) Hi.

213
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,148
I got that for my birthday,
but it wasn't my size.

214
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:16,528
Oh okay.

215
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,496
Would you like store
credit or cash back?

216
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,981
Actually, could you
put it on my card?

217
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,016
Sure, no problem.

218
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,194
All right, there you go.

219
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,748
- Thanks.
- Yeah, of course.

220
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,133
Can I help you?

221
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:36,307
Yes, thank you.

222
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,176
I have this notebook too.

223
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,178
It's perfect for journaling.

224
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:47,456
Great, that's what
I'm getting it for.

225
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,424
It actually helped me
break my screen addiction.

226
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,288
You know, I've
been thinking about

227
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,187
cutting back myself recently.

228
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,947
Are you glad you did?

229
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:57,431
It gave me back my life.

230
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:02,057
Monopoly, really?

231
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:04,300
I mean, who wants
to play board games

232
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:06,026
on their 16th birthday?

233
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:08,166
How lame is that?

234
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,030
Uh huh.

235
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:12,377
She could have
flown us to the Azores

236
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:13,793
with all the money she has.

237
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,149
Oh, and I totally
forgot to tell you,

238
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:27,220
last night as I was sleeping

239
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:30,879
my dog got abducted by aliens.

240
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:31,913
Yeah.

241
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,092
Oh, I have to go.

242
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:52,038
Sorry we're late.

243
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:53,625
Got stuck behind
a student driver.

244
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,248
Hey, you're looking at one.

245
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:56,352
Sorry.

246
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:58,458
So about the pact.

247
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:02,013
I've been mulling
something over.

248
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:04,153
What if we went a week
instead of just a day?

249
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:07,122
I mean, how much good
can 24 hours really do?

250
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,503
You're crazy.

251
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:11,264
I agree with Peyton.

252
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:12,748
I did some research last night,

253
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:14,646
and it kind of shook me up.

254
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:16,338
Listen to this.

255
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:18,305
Teen suicide rates
have nearly tripled

256
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,869
since the introduction
of the smartphone,

257
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:20,998
the study finds.

258
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:24,725
MRis revealed that
brains on smartphones

259
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,314
are nearly identical
to brains on drugs.

260
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,180
And researchers say
that the average person

261
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:35,460
will spent over 34 years of
their life staring at a screen.

262
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:37,980
Am I the only one that finds
these things disturbing?

263
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:39,913
It sounds like the
risks of screen use

264
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:41,673
might outweigh the benefits.

265
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,779
But there are
so many benefits.

266
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:47,300
I mean, I just Face Timed my
aunt and she lives in Thailand.

267
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:49,336
And then there are
selfies and GPS.

268
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:52,063
I mean, where would
I be without GPS?

269
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:54,686
Why don't we just
reduce our screen time?

270
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,136
It's not that simple, Sophie.

271
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:59,829
I think we have to break
our addiction first.

272
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:00,969
I agree with Peyton.

273
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:02,003
One week.

274
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:04,248
Well, where do I sign?

275
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:08,977
Count me out.

276
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:16,467
I guess it's just
the two of us now.

277
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,921
(Cashier) Excuse me, ma'am.

278
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,588
You're spilling something
all over the floor.

279
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:24,785
Oh my gosh!

280
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,649
Do forgive me.

281
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:30,032
I was so busy texting
I didn't even notice.

282
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:32,379
It's actually, it's actually

283
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:35,106
a bottle of margarita
mix for my son

284
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:36,314
that I just picked up.

285
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:39,697
I must've hit it on
the door on my way in.

286
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,732
I'm so sorry.

287
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,079
I've made such a mess!

288
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:43,435
- (Cashier) It's no problem.
- I'm so sorry.

289
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:44,564
I'm so sorry.

290
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:45,817
(Cashier)
Absolutely no problem.

291
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,636
(Courtney) Looks like
we might have a trio.

292
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:58,267
Hey!
(gentle music)

293
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:06,034
Perfect.

294
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:08,484
No screens for one week.

295
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,384
(Skylar) But wait, I thought
we'd agreed to 24 hours?

296
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:14,628
You should probably read
the contract next time.

297
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:22,567
(gentle guitar music)

298
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,478
(washing machine dinging)

299
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:01,365
(indistinct chatter)

300
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,371
(speaking in Spanish)

301
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:26,390
- Hey.
- (Peyton) Hi.

302
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:27,908
How's that journaling going?

303
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,670
(Peyton) I
haven't started yet.

304
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:32,879
I'm not really sure
where to begin.

305
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:34,363
Perhaps I could be of help.

306
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:39,610
(pen clicking)

307
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,271
Oh hey hon.

308
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:46,524
Why aren't you
working on your blog?

309
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:48,205
We're fasting from
all screens, mom.

310
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,138
Not just our phones.

311
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:51,622
You can go to library.

312
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:53,624
I can't use their
computers either.

313
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:54,935
They're still screens.

314
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,490
Books, Courtney.

315
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:00,009
Talking about books.

316
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,563
Right.

317
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:03,358
You know, I think I
will try the library.

318
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:04,392
Oh great.

319
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:12,091
(phone ringing)

320
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:22,515
(phone ringing)

321
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,246
(Amy) Skylar, this is Amy.

322
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:32,490
Why haven't you been
answering my texts?

323
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,148
Pick up your phone already.

324
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:36,183
Skylar?

325
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,599
Whatever.

326
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:18,950
Marilyn, I can't
believe teenagers today.

327
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:22,091
They're literally
glued to their phones.

328
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,646
(Marilyn) It's really
dreadful, isn't it?

329
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,512
You know the other day I
was on my way to Pilates class

330
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:31,031
and this girl came
running up to me

331
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:36,036
and she asked me if
I'd seen her phone.

332
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:37,521
Poor thing.

333
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:39,799
She was utterly frantic.

334
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,215
That's how they get when
they lose their phone.

335
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:45,632
This is a cute shop.

336
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:07,447
You ate all the cookies!

337
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:09,484
That was a lot of work!

338
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:12,072
Mom, Skylar ate all my cookies!

339
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,220
Make her nose bigger.

340
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:24,647
Hurry up, we don't have all day.

341
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:26,328
Can't you see I'm trying?

342
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:34,543
Okay, now give her
skin a green hue,

343
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:36,165
but make it look realistic.

344
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:41,550
Oh, and can you mess up
her hair a little bit?

345
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:42,585
I'll do my best.

346
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:51,871
Successful trip
to the library?

347
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:53,631
These are totally antiquated.

348
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:58,533
(pen clicking)

349
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,883
What are you talking about?

350
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,367
This is from this year.

351
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:06,334
What?

352
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,025
Like six months ago.

353
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:10,648
Just as I thought.

354
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:12,961
I'm going to lose
all of my followers.

355
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,075
I'm so excited it's
almost Spring Break.

356
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:01,664
Hey!
Hey!

357
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:04,150
How was the exam?

358
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:06,842
So, about the digital detox.

359
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:09,397
You first.

360
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:12,883
Honestly, it's been great.

361
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,679
I've actually become
reacquainted with the library.

362
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:18,544
I kind of forgot it existed.

363
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:19,578
And you, Peyton?

364
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:22,306
I think I've done pretty well.

365
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,619
Okay, maybe I went
shopping a little too much,

366
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:27,207
but at least I
stayed off my phone.

367
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:28,208
(Courtney) And you, Skylar?

368
00:22:28,243 --> 00:22:30,556
Piece of cake, or cookies.

369
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,042
So I did do a little
bit of binge eating,

370
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:36,113
but it was totally
my sister's fault.

371
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,046
I haven't looked
at a single screen.

372
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:40,876
Why are you looking
at me that way?

373
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:44,224
What if we just exchange
one addiction for another?

374
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:45,467
Does that still count?

375
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,367
I'll have to think about that.

376
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:51,024
You know what I just realized?

377
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,131
We're actually having a real
uninterrupted conversation.

378
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,064
I could really get used to this.

379
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:59,067
Me too.
(phone dinging)

380
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:02,173
Oh, I forgot I have
to babysit today.

381
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,899
Peyton, your phone!

382
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:06,039
We still have three days left.

383
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:09,318
It's just for emergencies.

384
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:10,353
See you!

385
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:16,947
(Skylar) That's
not an emergency.

386
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:25,507
(toy trucks rumbling)

387
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:41,765
(indistinct toddler chatter)

388
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,982
(slow music)

389
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:55,951
(phone dinging)

390
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:07,515
(Peyton) Go kill yourself?

391
00:24:55,735 --> 00:24:56,735
One.

392
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:26,179
(dramatic music)

393
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:05,702
You must be the
new babysitter.

394
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,291
I found this chicken thief

395
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,017
stealing a chicken
out of my coop.

396
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:14,745
Is everything okay?

397
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:17,679
He swallowed my
antidepressants.

398
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:26,412
911, yes I'm at...

399
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:28,207
There's a boy here.

400
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:29,898
He took some pills, I think.

401
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,592
Maybe three or four?

402
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:39,736
Yes, we're at we're
at 456 North Mason.

403
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:42,014
Yes, please hurry.

404
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,016
I don't know what's going on.

405
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,776
I don't know if he's okay.

406
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,468
(sirens blaring)

407
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,577
(intensifying music)

408
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,931
(indistinct chatter)
(slow music)

409
00:27:57,503 --> 00:28:00,126
(sirens blaring)

410
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:09,757
(dramatic music)

411
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:16,384
(phone cracking)

412
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:30,674
Honey, why don't you
just wait here, okay?

413
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:02,395
How's the Reese boy doing?

414
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,534
Is he still in a coma?

415
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:04,777
Unfortunately yes.

416
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:07,652
(Paramedic) Yeah,
what's his prognosis?

417
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:09,920
(Doctor) Dr. Hughes says
it's too early to tell.

418
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:11,680
It doesn't look good.

419
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:20,102
Peyton!

420
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:21,862
Peyton!

421
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:37,465
Any news on Dylan?

422
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:39,225
It's been almost a week.

423
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,297
Well, as far as I know
he hasn't gotten any worse.

424
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:44,506
I'm sorry you're going
through this, Peyton.

425
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:46,101
Sure wish you would
have kept that pact.

426
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:48,096
You're the lamest
brother in the world!

427
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:49,270
She didn't mean that, son.

428
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:51,582
But that was really
inappropriate.

429
00:29:51,617 --> 00:29:52,514
You're right.

430
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:53,377
I shouldn't have said that.

431
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:54,412
I'm sorry.

432
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:57,519
You know Peyton, we
can't change the past,

433
00:29:57,554 --> 00:29:58,600
but we can learn
from our mistakes

434
00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:00,005
and do better in the future.

435
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,145
I don't know that I can.

436
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:03,974
Of course you can, honey.

437
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:07,046
Not having my phone is
like missing an appendage.

438
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:09,877
Now I've just replaced
it with my tablet.

439
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:11,682
(Landon) Maybe you should
get off the grid for awhile.

440
00:30:11,706 --> 00:30:14,122
As if I'm the only
one that has a problem!

441
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:16,745
(Landon) Hey, look, I
have problems all right.

442
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,334
But screen addiction
isn't one of them.

443
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:20,369
Oh really?

444
00:30:23,442 --> 00:30:27,549
Monday, seven hours
and 33 minutes.

445
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,138
Entertainment, social media and,

446
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:31,173
Landon!

447
00:30:32,175 --> 00:30:34,418
(Landon) Well at least
I didn't kill a kid.

448
00:30:35,454 --> 00:30:40,390
How dare you!
(dramatic music)

449
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,330
(slow piano music)

450
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:16,908
What are these?

451
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:20,430
(Mom) There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

452
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:21,638
What's that?

453
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:25,676
Sorry, I should've
told you a long time ago.

454
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,852
You have a half sister.

455
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,887
What?

456
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,511
I was a junior in high school.

457
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:33,995
My boyfriend got me pregnant.

458
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:36,687
It wasn't consensual.

459
00:31:36,722 --> 00:31:38,655
But that's horrible.

460
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,760
I had to give the
baby up for adoption.

461
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:42,866
Her name is...

462
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,454
Chloe.

463
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:45,800
I know her.

464
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:46,628
How do you...

465
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:49,804
(phone ringing)

466
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:51,081
That's the hospital.

467
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:52,082
Hello?

468
00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:53,117
This is she.

469
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:56,500
What?

470
00:31:56,535 --> 00:31:58,330
Oh, that's wonderful news.

471
00:31:58,364 --> 00:31:59,434
Can we come visit him?

472
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:01,574
Right now?

473
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:02,921
Oh, thank you so much.

474
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,095
Dylan's awake!

475
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:09,928
(footsteps stomping)

476
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,768
What are you doing here?

477
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:24,908
Oh, I volunteer at
the children's ward.

478
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,910
Are you here to see a patient?

479
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,118
Yeah.

480
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:29,257
Dylan Reese.

481
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:32,019
Chloe, what happened?

482
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:32,916
I'm so sorry, Peyton.

483
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,193
I can't tell you.

484
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:35,746
I signed a
confidentiality agreement.

485
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:40,751
What I meant to say
was what happened to you?

486
00:32:40,786 --> 00:32:42,857
I got in a car
accident a few years ago.

487
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,894
How did it happen?

488
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:48,690
I slammed into a
tree while texting.

489
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:50,969
I'm so sorry.

490
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,178
It's okay, I knew
I had a problem.

491
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:55,076
I was glued to my
phone back then,

492
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:58,493
but I never thought
it would lead to this.

493
00:32:58,528 --> 00:32:59,746
That never would have happened

494
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,669
if I didn't break my pact.

495
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:02,981
What pact?

496
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:06,122
I was on day four
of a digital detox

497
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:09,090
when I fell off the
wagon, so to speak.

498
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,851
That's when Dylan
got into my Prozac.

499
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:12,991
Antidepressants?

500
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:15,510
The cyber bullying.

501
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:17,374
It really gets me down.

502
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,425
Chloe.

503
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:34,909
It's okay, mom.

504
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:35,943
I already know.

505
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,541
Hey Trish, are you sitting?

506
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:49,993
You are not going to
believe what I just read.

507
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:52,167
Hold on a second.

508
00:33:53,307 --> 00:33:54,549
Daniel.

509
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:57,759
(speaking in Spanish)

510
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:00,210
I'm sorry, Trish,

511
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:05,491
but Kristen just married a
famous Hollywood producer.

512
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:09,392
No, Kristen Bowers.

513
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:10,945
Chloe's birth mom.

514
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:15,570
No, they never met.

515
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:16,709
It's a closed adoption.

516
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:21,335
Funny, I was thinking
the same thing.

517
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,372
Chandler Hawthorne.

518
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:29,653
Yeah, talk about a
change in circumstances.

519
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,014
I think I can
help you, Peyton.

520
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:47,257
Really?

521
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:48,614
(Chloe) My uncle,
he owns this cabin

522
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:50,502
on an island off the grid.

523
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:53,643
I went there to break
my screen addiction.

524
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:56,577
If you'd like I could
take you there with me.

525
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,751
You'd, you'd do that for me?

526
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,305
Of course.

527
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:01,903
Besides I've been itching
to get back to the island

528
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:03,273
since my accident,

529
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:05,758
but I don't feel
comfortable going alone.

530
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:07,415
I would really
love your company.

531
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,730
By any chance could I
bring a couple friends along?

532
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:14,181
They've been struggling
with screen addiction, too.

533
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:15,215
Absolutely.

534
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,226
(Landon) Hoping we
can catch some fish.

535
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:26,883
Bet I can get double
what you can get.

536
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,540
I don't know about that.

537
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:30,162
(throat clearing)

538
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:31,059
Who do you think I am?

539
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:32,164
Some kind of moron?

540
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,096
Come on, Morgan.

541
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,442
She's like a sister to me.

542
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:35,719
Oh really?

543
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:36,513
I've seen the way
you look at her,

544
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:38,136
and I read your texts.

545
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,896
Oh Peyton, happy birthday.

546
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,760
You're such a
beautiful young woman.

547
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:44,383
And now you're going on a
trip with her behind my back?

548
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:45,902
Look, Landon and I

549
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,742
are just going on a fishing
trip to get off the grid.

550
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:49,457
We're just dropping
them off on the way.

551
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:52,391
Oh, so now you've joined
in on the digital detox too?

552
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:55,014
Okay, it was your idea for
me to cut back on my gaming.

553
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:57,500
I swear, Tyler, if
you leave on that boat,

554
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:58,949
we are finished.

555
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:05,370

(Chloe) He sure did.

566
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:10,158
That's so cool.

567
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,058
(slow piano music)

568
00:37:13,092 --> 00:37:14,646
(Chloe) Oh, I just
love this garden.

569
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:20,548
(Courtney) Look at those
roses, oh my goodness.

570
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:37,531
(Chloe) All right,
make yourself at home.

571
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,479
Check out this
incredible view.

572
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:56,619
And this awesome loft.

573
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:57,689
(Courtney) Bunk beds!

574
00:37:57,723 --> 00:37:58,655
This is just like summer camp!

575
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,208
Dibs on the top bunk!

576
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,280
Speaking of beds,

577
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:03,971
would any of you mind
if I put my feet up

578
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,042
for a minute or two?

579
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:06,836
Of course not.

580
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,147
By all means.

581
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:10,564
We can make some snacks.

582
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:11,598
Perfect.

583
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:20,953
Anyone for pistachios?

584
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:21,988
Peyton?

585
00:38:25,855 --> 00:38:27,097
Here it goes.

586
00:38:27,132 --> 00:38:29,617
Five straight days
without any screens.

587
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:31,447
And no way to cheat this time.

588
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:32,481
What a relief.

589
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:35,634
Do you really think
things will be any different

590
00:38:35,658 --> 00:38:36,693
when we get back?

591
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,214
Yeah, I think they will.

592
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:42,320
If we can commit to
making some changes.

593
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:44,781
(Skylar) What
are you suggesting?

594
00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:47,808
I think we need to
set some boundaries.

595
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:50,880
Maybe cut our social
media time in half.

596
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:52,019
I think that's doable.

597
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,678
And we should probably
keep all screens

598
00:38:55,712 --> 00:38:58,681
out of our bedrooms.

599
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:00,476
And turn them off at dinner.

600
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:06,171
Peyton, you're pretty
quiet over there.

601
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:08,691
It's just,

602
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:11,418
I've been considering giving
up smartphones altogether.

603
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,561
Hey girls, you guys
wanna go on a hike?

604
00:39:16,595 --> 00:39:18,632
(Skylar) Sure, I'm
always up for an adventure.

605
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,841
Okay, yeah maybe
grab us some snacks.

606
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:21,807
Yeah.

607
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:23,257
I'll tell you where it's at.

608
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,749
So head back down to the dock,

609
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:35,821
and then about a quarter
mile along the beach

610
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:37,799
on the right hand side you're
gonna see the trail head.

611
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:39,342
Great.

612
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,308
Yeah, shouldn't take you
guys more than an hour.

613
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:41,586
Okay.

614
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,794
Yeah, have fun.

615
00:39:42,828 --> 00:39:43,484
(Courtney) We'll
see you later.

616
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:44,796
Yeah, see you.

617
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,626
Bailey, you gotta
stay here, okay?

618
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,491
No Bailey, come on.

619
00:39:50,526 --> 00:39:51,561
I know.

620
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:52,596
Have fun!

621
00:39:56,117 --> 00:39:58,396
(giggling)

622
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:02,400
Don't fall.

623
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:03,746
You either, please.

624
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,230
I'm doing my best.

625
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:07,612
There's no hospital
on this island.

626
00:40:09,752 --> 00:40:11,719
- (Skylar) Here's the trail.
- Awesome.

627
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:14,377
Come on, Courtney.

628
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,412
Slowpoke!

629
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:18,899
(giggling)

630
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:20,072
This is so gorgeous.

631
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:22,557
(Peyton) Yeah.

632
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:43,544
I have yet to see a
single mosquito, Skylar.

633
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:45,443
So what are you swatting at?

634
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:50,758
I could swear I feel my
phone vibrating in my pocket.

635
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:53,312
They're called phantom
vibrations, Skylar.

636
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:54,693
They'll go away eventually.

637
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:08,155
Did you see that
slug back there?

638
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:09,304
(Skylar) I know,
that was so weird.

639
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:10,985
It was like, hanging
from the tree.

640
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:15,449
(Peyton) Are we
still on the trail?

641
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,820
It's just a little overgrown.

642
00:41:17,854 --> 00:41:19,097
A little?

643
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,339
I think we should turn back.

644
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:21,651
Come on, Peyton.

645
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:23,688
This island can't be that big.

646
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:45,813
I'm famished.

647
00:41:57,376 --> 00:42:00,690
Okay guys, I think
we're officially lost.

648
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:03,175
(Courtney) Where's Google
maps when you need it?

649
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:14,532
Hey, I think I see
the remnants of a trail.

650
00:42:15,463 --> 00:42:16,463
Let's try this way.

651
00:42:31,894 --> 00:42:33,102
What time is it?

652
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:35,138
I think my blood
sugar is dropping.

653
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:37,658
Maybe around eight.

654
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:39,108
I'm sorry, Peyton.

655
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:41,051
I would have brought more
snacks if I'd known we'd be out

656
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:42,007
for so long.

657
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,422
It's okay, I'll be fine.

658
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:45,114
Maybe we should
pick up the pace.

659
00:42:47,288 --> 00:42:49,394
(dramatic music)
(girls screaming)

660
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:50,428
Peyton!

661
00:42:57,436 --> 00:42:59,784
(slow music)

662
00:43:15,523 --> 00:43:16,523
Bailey.

663
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:42,792
(dramatic music)
(Peyton crying)

664
00:43:54,977 --> 00:43:57,151
(panting)

665
00:44:24,592 --> 00:44:27,009
(slow music)

666
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:43,128
(dog barking)

667
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:37,216
Wait, one second.

668
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:39,460
I learned in survival camp

669
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:41,393
that you can actually
eat sting nettles.

670
00:45:41,428 --> 00:45:42,878
- Stop!
- Don't touch that!

671
00:45:42,912 --> 00:45:45,708
They're called stinging
nettles for a reason.

672
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,882
Trust me.

673
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:48,607
I know what I'm doing.

674
00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:50,644
Wait, what's this?

675
00:45:50,678 --> 00:45:53,060
(slow music)

676
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:14,970
Look, another one.

677
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:23,564
(footsteps tapping)

678
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:48,589
Thank God.

679
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:49,970
What happened to you guys?

680
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:54,009
We got a little lost.

681
00:47:54,043 --> 00:47:56,356
But then we found these.

682
00:48:01,706 --> 00:48:04,882
(gentle guitar music)

683
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:53,734
(Skylar That was so
funny when you fell off

684
00:48:53,758 --> 00:48:56,209
the paddleboard yesterday.

685
00:48:56,243 --> 00:48:58,487
I wouldn't exactly
call it funny.

686
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:00,868
I thought it was funny.

687
00:49:00,903 --> 00:49:02,491
Oh, are these the
marshmallow sticks?

688
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:04,631
(Skylar) Nice job
on the fire, Peyton.

689
00:49:04,665 --> 00:49:05,701
Thanks.

690
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:14,882
(giggling)

691
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:22,373
I'm so sorry about
the trail girls.

692
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:25,583
My uncle must've stopped
maintaining it after my accident.

693
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:29,138
Accident, I thought you
were just born that way.

694
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:29,967
What happened?

695
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:30,795
Skylar!

696
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:31,829
What!

697
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:35,282
I slammed into
a tree with my car

698
00:49:35,317 --> 00:49:36,318
a couple of years ago

699
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:38,630
and shattered my pelvis.

700
00:49:38,665 --> 00:49:39,665
That's awful.

701
00:49:41,047 --> 00:49:43,463
Unfortunately, that
wasn't the worst of it.

702
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:46,190
I got a brain bleed when
my head hit the dashboard.

703
00:49:46,224 --> 00:49:48,192
The doctors didn't
expect me to survive.

704
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,989
Skylar, your marshmallow!

705
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,750
Go on.

706
00:49:57,615 --> 00:49:59,720
So much of it is a blur.

707
00:49:59,755 --> 00:50:02,930
I'm told that I was on the
brink of death for weeks,

708
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:04,346
but my lowest point came when

709
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,796
my doctor told me that I
would never walk again.

710
00:50:07,866 --> 00:50:09,558
I swear when I heard that

711
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,457
I wanted to curl up and die.

712
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,253
I can't even imagine.

713
00:50:16,668 --> 00:50:18,946
That's when I began
contemplating my mortality.

714
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,915
Something that I'd never done
while plastered to my screen,

715
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:26,471
Instead of succumbing
to despair,

716
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:30,441
I found myself overwhelmed with
this intense desire to live

717
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:33,996
and this rising conviction
that my life had purpose.

718
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,309
And I vowed that if I did live,

719
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:38,656
I would find out what
that purpose was.

720
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:39,690
And I did.

721
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:43,592
Life is precious girls,

722
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:46,457
and I don't want to waste
another minute of it.

723
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:48,907
Which is why you
tackled your addiction?

724
00:50:49,805 --> 00:50:52,256
Yes, that's why.

725
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,154
But enough about me.

726
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:55,189
What's your why?

727
00:50:59,504 --> 00:51:02,542
