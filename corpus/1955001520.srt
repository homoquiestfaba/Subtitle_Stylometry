I've never seen anything
like that, ever.

felt threatened by him before?

No.

Then, maybe it was a one-time thing.

536

than something stupid.

that you were the one.

the rest of my life with.

We broke up a few weeks ago.

No.

647
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,580
Miss Vaughn, it's not a crime
to be in a public place,

648
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,808
or buy a girl a cup of coffee,

649
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,969
or, sadly, to call someone
a hundred times a day.

650
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,460
But isn't this stalking
or harassment or something?

651
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,260
The crime of stalking
is difficult to prosecute.

652
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,740
We need to prove a pattern
of prolonged harassment by the individual.

653
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,580
And even then, it's often a matter
of "she said, he said."

654
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,445
So what am I supposed to do?
Just put up with it?

655
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,926
Hopefully, he'll see his behavior is
getting him nowhere and stop on his own.

00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,082
This is what happens
in 95% of the cases.

And if it doesn't?

658
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,300
We can seek a restraining order,

659
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,500
which will prohibit him
from coming near you.

660
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,060

that sometimes antagonizes them.

So, I knew this guy.

1145

Someone broke into his house
while he was sleeping.

1146
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,526
After that, he kept
a shotgun in his house.

1147
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,122
It was a 12-gauge Remington.

1148
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,340
I don't know what that means.

1149
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,620
Remington is the make.

1150
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,166
It holds seven rounds, or bullets.

1151
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,331
But in shotguns, they're called shells.

1152
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,940
Okay.

1153
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,300
So he loaded the first two shells
with bean bag rounds

1154
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,051
and the last five with regular shells.

1155

You... You lost me.

1156
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,802
Bean bag rounds
are little bags filled with lead shot.

1157
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,780
The bag is designed to protect the skin
from penetration.

1158
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,487
So, technically, they're classified
as non-lethal rounds.

1159
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,380
So, he loaded the first two shells
with bean bags

1160
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,007
because a non-lethal round
qualifies as a warning shot.

1161
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,860
Why?

1162
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,682

to threaten your safety,
