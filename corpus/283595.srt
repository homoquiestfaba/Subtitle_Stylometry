1
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:55,743
Lunch boxes! Come and eat here!

2
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,449
From a Western view

3
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,280
the nation of China

4
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,514
is completely different
from their own nation

5
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,623
on the other hand

6
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,955
the citizens of China have
had to fight off their invasion and

7
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,096
the gradual realization that

8
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,527
the country of China should be recognized
as a unified whole

9
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,429
Confronting the invasion of imperialism

10
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,230
the people of China
all share the same grounding principles

11
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,666
of destiny, fate, honor and misfortune

12
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,864
The revolutionists underwent a long time
to bring this practice into fulfillment

13
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,339
the revolutionists and
theorists gave continuous explanations

14
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,571
on the objective
existence of Chinese people in China

15
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,874
finally through thousands of years
of self-reliance and development

16
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:30,913
it has given the people of China...

17
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,915
a sense of national consciousness
and understanding

18
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,385
To summarize the nation of China
is a term that has gone through

19
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,684
extensive theoretical
and social-scientific study

20
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,351
The Communist Party clearly understands...

21
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,928
he key conflicts effecting modern China

22
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,759
is the contradiction of foreign
imperialism on the Chinese nation

23
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,697
it is wholly necessary
for the nation of China to unite

24
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,167
and demand the right of liberation
from external aggressors

25
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,000
and internally,
to bring equality to all Chinese people

26
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,769
Understanding the root problem
of Chinese Nationalism,

27
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,377
he formulation of the Chinese

28
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,843
Communist Party carried out the most...

29
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,312
suitable national policy
for the people of China

30
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,384
therefore, creating a central
foundation bringing unification...

31
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,214
for the nation of China

32
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,083
Their guidance gave independence

33
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,316
and liberation for the whole nation
of China.

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,928
Passengers,
the announcement presented to you is about

35
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,756
The Meaning & Significance
of the Nation of China.

36
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,120
The national patriotic educational...

37
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,766
broadcast program special has ended.

38
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,265
Thank you for listening.

39
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,902
Mister, I'm going to Ma-duo,
heading in the right direction?

40
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,363
I'm going to Hua-Shi Valley.

41
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,840
You can change there.

42
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,233
Jump on.

43
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,375
Thank you!

44
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,326
Cheers!

45
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,964
You little rascal! Don't get lost!

46
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,301
Looking for a room?

47
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,976
Where are you from?

48
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,135
Hong Kong.

49
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,813
Ah! Hong Kong.

50
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,610
Wait a minute, please.

51
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,456
Follow me.

52
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,717
Thanks.

53
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,641
This one.

54
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,549
This is the best one we have.

55
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,618
Have a rest.

56
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,951
Thanks.

57
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,525
Long time no see!

58
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,755
How are you doing?

59
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,126
Very good!

60
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,332
I've come here to help you!

61
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,593
That's great!

62
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,599
Let me go in and see.

63
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,294
Very good, thank you very much!

64
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:49,956
Come in.

65
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,391
Hot water...

66
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,598
Are you here on holiday?

67
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,997
Looking for someone.

68
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,502
Please have you seen this person before?

69
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,546
You've seen him?

70
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,579
You look like him.

71
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,381
He's my elder brother.

72
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,324
I don't think I have seen him.

73
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,717
Take a rest.

74
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,090
Thanks.

75
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,566
Excuse me.

76
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,762
What do you want?

77
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,341
Please, have you seen this person?

78
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,702
A roll of film?

79
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,579
Eighteen dollars.

80
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,841
Not this one.

81
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,678
Please. Have you seen this person?

82
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:57,944
No.

83
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,016
Ni-Ma!

84
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,261
Have you seen this man?

85
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,561
Thanks.

86
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,410
Hey! Can of Pepsi?

87
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,246
Watch where you going? Fucker!

88
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,833
Mister, please have you seen this person?

89
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,241
No.

90
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,041
This, should have been sent from here.

91
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,017
So many people come in here everyday,
how can I remember them all.

92
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,559
Please have another look,
this is very important.

93
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,218
I have come a long way to find him.

94
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,660
Stop hassling me.
Look I said I haven't seen him!

95
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,965
Come on help him. You're not busy anyway.

96
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,068
Oh my god! This was sent three years ago!

97
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,505
How would I know?

98
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,743
I haven't seen him,
you're better off asking somewhere else!

99
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,837
Please, have you seen this person?

100
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:01,932
No, I haven't.

101
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,574
Thanks. That's okay.

102
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,674
Hey! Where do you want to go?

103
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,781
May I follow you?

104
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,517
Can I be your 'kammo'?

105
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,219
What is 'kammo'?

106
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,719
'Kammo' means wife.

107
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,658
Why do you want to be my 'kammo'?

108
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,696
This dumb kid is always like this.
Ignore her.

109
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,993
I keep seeing you everywhere,
are you looking for someone?

110
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,066
Yes!

111
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,003
Have you seen this person?

112
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,905
I've just started working here,
I don't know much.

113
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,369
Ask my friend here.

114
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,982
He used to live here.

115
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,555
If you know anything about him,
let me know,

116
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,885
I have come a long way.

117
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,390
Are you from Hong Kong?

118
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:30,789
Guang-dong.

119
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:31,792
Where in Guang-dong?

120
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:32,725
Guang-zhou.

121
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:33,887
Really?

122
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,394
They don't really remember.

123
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,663
Can't really blame them,
Ma-duo's a stop-over place.

124
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,097
Why are you looking for him?

125
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,901
Just looking.

126
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,442
Thanks.

127
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,477
Two large bread, to take-away.

128
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,355
How are you, have you found him yet?

129
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,584
Not yet.

130
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,693
Good luck.

131
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,004
If you need the postal service,
come and find me.

132
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,304
Alright.

133
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,036
It was built last year.
By a Hong Kong person.

134
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,039
Can't imagine Run Run Shaw
arriving here before me.

135
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,243
The old man may have met my brother.

136
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,028
Look. Ma-duo's a rural place
it needs modernization.

137
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,768
Everyday it's different.

138
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,444
Go back.

139
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,973
I want to stay a while.

140
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:45,814
Do you want to borrow this?

141
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:47,943
You ride it.

142
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,265
You're here!

143
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,614
To Hong Kong.

144
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,842
Hong Kong... six dollars twenty.

145
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,023
Give it here.

146
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,098
Such a small place. You get use to it.

147
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,776
No. I'm only twenty-one.

148
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,914
I've worked at this post office
for three years now,

149
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,219
once I went to Xian, apart from that
I've never been anywhere else.

150
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,198
Xian. It's quite a busy place!

151
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,770
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

152
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,350
What?

153
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,809
I said I'm leaving tomorrow!

154
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,522
You've only been here a few days,
leaving already?

155
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,290
Why are you looking for him?

156
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:58,413
I can't read.

157
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,544
I received this three years ago,

158
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,988
sent from Ma-duo.

159
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:16,098
He suddenly disappeared
when I was young...

160
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:24,473
Early one day I woke up to suddenly
see my brother had gone.

161
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,976
Afterwards I began receiving postcards...

162
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,408
and photo from all over China,

163
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,216
I never thought of looking for him.

164
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,155
Three years ago, I received this letter.

165
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,486
Since then I have not
received anything else.

166
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,368
Sorry, I just said...

167
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,243
That's okay, I understand.

168
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,582
He's been gone so many years,

169
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,548
you've only been looking for a few days.

170
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,887
Well I'll be leaving tomorrow afternoon!

171
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:12,479
One Lamb-meat noodle.

172
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,311
Add more garlic, not hot, please.

173
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,010
Coming-up!

174
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,480
Get me another Er-Guo-Tou.

175
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,588
Here it is!

176
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:24,921
Thanks!

177
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,902
What's the matter?
Can't handle the hot from Guang-dong?

178
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,370
From Hong Kong.

179
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,477
Fuck! Isn't Hong Kong in Guang-dong?

180
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,714
Drink some.

181
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,386
First sip and I fell in love with it.

182
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,857
There isn't anything like this
in Hong Kong, don't know what I'll do?

183
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,668
Have you seen him?

184
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,401
He's my elder brother.

185
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,448
Na-Ri. It's ready.

186
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,222
Hey! Photo!

187
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,782
Na-Ri. Pay up this time!

188
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,120
Sorry.

189
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,898
You know him!

190
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,864
Lamb-meat noodle,
add more garlic, not hot.

191
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,197
You say it just like your brother.

192
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,046
It's been years.

193
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,946
Tell me, where has he gone?

194
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,793
You must know!

195
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,122
Hold it!

196
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,636
Take another one!

197
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,832
You look alike!

198
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,375
Are you going to tell me?

199
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,344
The photo you are holding, I took it.

200
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:58,805
That time, my skill was crap,
I used a tripod.

201
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,481
Drink this.

202
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,291
This Er-Guo-Tou,

203
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:18,625
first time your brother and me...

204
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,463
had this we got really drunk.

205
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,329
Fucking puked everywhere!

206
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,202
First sip and I fell in love with it.

207
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,471
Fucking thought he was really back!

208
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:49,290
The blood in his veins are sounds
of gallops

209
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:55,495
The holy sun shines in his eyes

210
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:04,044
Highland Barley wine fills his heart,
when he sings

211
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:08,178
The whole world is in his hands,

212
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,613
in his hands

213
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,395
Aren't you leaving today?

214
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,166
Today, I bumped into someone
who knew my brother.

215
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,609
You knew him!

216
00:44:58,796 --> 00:44:59,694
Follow me!

217
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:08,858
I get a new one.

218
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:20,361
Let me.

219
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,115
When I was small, my greatest achievement
was changing the light bulb.

220
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,087
Because my dad wouldn't get
on the chair to change it,

221
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,183
this was when I felt
the most satisfaction.

222
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,298
In these days,

223
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,594
I would sometimes lie awake in bed,

224
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,904
staring at the light bulb up
at the ceiling, all night.

225
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,138
Looking at what?

226
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,739
I remember there was a man
who helped change a light bulb for me,

227
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,880
that night he also told me
exactly this same story.

228
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,315
Well,
you ever thought of leaving with him?

229
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,426
It's nice here, isn't it?

230
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,631
You see it, come in!

231
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,463
Let me go inside, please.

232
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,399
Okay!

233
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,860
I think this is what you are looking for.

234
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:20,509
Take these with you.

235
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,729
I'm on my own.
Since then I've always on my own.

236
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,370
You're in a hurry to leave?

237
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,902
I'll be going to
my brother-in-law's farm tomorrow,

238
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,569
do you want to come with me?

239
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:52,906
Alright.

240
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,015
Present from my brother?

241
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,185
This is the only thing I have of him.

242
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:34,978
Ren Qing-Jia!

243
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:48,789
Ren Qing-Jia! Ren Qing-Jia...

244
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,169
Duo Ri-Ma!

245
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,636
How do you do? How do you do?

246
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:58,996
Where's your sister?

247
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,937
Where is your 'kammo'?

248
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:02,402
I have no 'kammo'.

249
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,378
She has passed away.

250
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:05,779
Sorry.

251
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:07,872
Why are you saying sorry?

252
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,448
Did you kill her?

253
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,146
We don't talk about the dead.

254
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:15,551
It's disrespectful.

255
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,657
Little rascal, hop on.

256
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,095
Thanks.

257
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,543
Xia Ri-Ge!

258
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:50,701
Xia Ri-Ge?

259
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,817
Eagles breed in the sky,

260
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,223
Fiercely hooking onto each other
with their claws,

261
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,519
they play and roll around, then

262
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,956
suddenly stop and
seem to fall down from the sky.

263
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,699
Really!

264
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:12,666
Eagles mate in the sky,

265
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,531
they separate before
they reach the ground.

266
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,734
This is because eagles fly alone.

267
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:27,709
But humans are not the same.

268
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,497
Does he really want to live a solitary
life up in the plains?

269
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,356
It's fucking freezing!

270
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:28,788
Have you not got it in tune yet?

271
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,089
It's impossible to tune.

272
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,158
The fret board's bent.

273
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,331
The Pegasus-Zeus star!

274
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,401
Where? How can you see it?

275
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:18,735
Well,

276
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:20,208
actually I don't know.

277
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,445
I just made it up.

278
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,079
I say it to chat-up girls.

279
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,284
Even if I said it to them,
they will still ask.

280
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:31,620
You smart arse!

281
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,224
They say, when people die,

282
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,229
there's one less star.

283
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,127
Finished?

284
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,203
But the kid's mother always says:

285
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:45,572
When people die...

286
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:49,406
a star appears in the sky.

287
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,341
How are you?

288
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,372
When a person dies they turn into star.

289
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:56,309
What for?

290
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:00,046
So at night, they light the way
for people walking down below.

291
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,487
Fuck that!

292
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:12,213
Thanks!

293
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,208
Are you missing home?

294
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:44,882
Where is his home?

295
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:46,786
Here! Beijing!

296
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:43,770
When I was younger,

297
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,106
I was walking up in the hills with my dad,

298
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,078
he unexpectedly stopped on the spot.

299
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,241
My threatening stern father,

300
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,319
just stood there,

301
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,114
and began watching the ants on the ground.

302
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:02,962
I don't know why but this
has remained deep in my memory.

303
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:06,192
I'm not sure...

304
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:07,926
what kind of relationship we had.

305
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,694
I never really knew at all.

306
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:15,132
We've never laughed together,

307
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:16,975
cried together,

308
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:20,245
or experienced ever the kind
of relationship between father and son.

309
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:22,012
Have never traveled together,

310
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:24,152
or fought together.

311
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:29,913
Sometimes the people we love grow
apart from us little by little,

312
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:32,820
or somehow the people who love us
gradually fall into the distance.

313
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:37,659
I know each and every one of us
will travel on life's journey,

314
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:40,800
and there is no turning back.

315
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:47,301
I see and can only say, I wish you well,

316
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,802
a good journey,

317
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:52,970
take care.
