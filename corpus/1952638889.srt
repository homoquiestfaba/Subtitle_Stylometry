13
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It just confirmed for me what I've really always known about myself. 

14
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I was telling everyone I met that it was so sad 

15

how no one in my entire life had ever given me a lily 

16
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, he left a lily on my doorstep 

17
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
which was... nice. 

18
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I have this rule that if I have sex with somebody 

19
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
well... they have to eat my pussy. 

20
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000

that he wouldn't have oral sex without protection. 

22
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He confessed that he hadn't had sex in 3 years 

23
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000

29
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I guess he thought it was gross that I was pregant 

30
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
eventually I just told him that I didn't even know if I was pregnant 

31
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
so, we went ahead... which actually consisted of him messing around with...

37

because we had made all these plans to move in with each other... 

38

40

41

46
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
By 7th grade I had convinced my parents to send me to modeling school 

47
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
where I learned to look and feel like a model, 

48
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I went on to get a BFA in painting, 

49
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and then I moved to this lovely city where I currently reside,

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
While I'm here, I'm going to do the book, The Artist's Way, that my mom bought for me last Christmas. 

335
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I've already started writing three pages in the morning to empty the contents of my mind 

336
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Paint from--paint from the spray cans is going to drip into the water colors. 

337
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Pencil drawings will be layered on top, which will be whited out and spray-painted over once again. 

338
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And then I'll draw, in marker, on top of it once it's dried. 

339
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
When I burn the edges, it's going to make it say that my art is full of decay and that I'm finished. 

340
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
We don't just have fears for no reason at all.  You have them because you should legitimately be afraid. 

341
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
People are naturally afraid of heights because you really can fall and die. 

342
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm not trying to accuse you, I just -- I don't know.  This is crazy, but I have this weird idea 

343
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
that there's people out there and it can't possibly be you, but that there are people that have something -- 

344
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and there's some sort of weird spite to the world -- purposely give that to others. 

345
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm not saying that that is you, I'm just looking for information to show that it's not -- 

346
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I was wondering if you could tell me honestly if you've had any symptoms recently or ever. 

347
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Because I really find it hard to believe that you have never had anything weird -- whatsoever strange -- happen down there, at all! 

348
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I don't feel accused except for the fact that I'm obviously being accused. 

349
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And no, I don't have any symptoms and I'll get my test results back in a couple weeks. 

350
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I think -- it's probably pretty obvious to say this, but I don't think we should have had sex. 

351
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
At the time, of course.  Right.  I was thinking -- we shouldn't have sex. 

352
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Right!  I mean -- that's why I was so surprised when you hopped on top of me. 

353
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
You asked me to have sex.  In that note. 

354
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Is this a joke? 

355
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I have the note right here.  Oral comma condom question mark. 

356
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I was asking if you wanted to have oral sex with a condom. 

357
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I thought you were giving me options. 

358
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I mean, I've never heard of oral sex with a condom. 

359
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I thought you meant oral sex or sex with a condom. 

360
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I opted for something I thought we would both enjoy. 

361
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I've never had sex with somebody more than once because it just goes so bad, 

362
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I think they they are just, um, ready to move on -- 

363
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That's what blew me away about being with you is that for once, it was an experience. 

364
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It was an event that was like a major breakthrough, for me. 

365
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I didn't want to not tell you what I was going through -- 

366
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:55,000
you know, I didn't want to just -- be experiencing that and just create a blockade 

367
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:03,000
rather than confronting you and -- it was better than just never speaking to you again, in my mind. 

368
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Full Disclosure Presentation for Arin 

369
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
God!  I really have to think about it.  Okay, there's not someone since 

370
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Jason, Rob, Vincent, Mark, Jay, Chris, Steve -- agh!  Let's see.  Claudio. 

371
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:30,000
The bus boy at work, but at least that was protected. There's a whole slew of people I just can't totally remember. 

372
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The kid in my painting class -- the there was a friend of a friend-- then I got tested around that time, and everything was fine. 

373
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But still.  If someone says they got something from me, then maybe they did. 

374
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Now, it just seems like such a ridiculous thing that I didn't insist every time I had sex with somebody 

375
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
that we were going to use condoms.  But I honestly just didn't feel comfortable asking.  So I just didn't ask. 

376
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm getting my test results back soon.  Will let you know what's up.  -- Susan 

377
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I'll make you think this is weird.  Not this.  This is definitely weird.  But why do I still smell you? 

378
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Even though you're like in -- three states away, or whatever. 

379
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It's almost like my B.O. smells like you.  Now. 

380
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I noticed that ever since we were together. 

381
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Would that be, like, a scientific -- I mean, can there be a reason behind that? 

382
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Or -- is it just my imagination?  Or -- did your smell somehow actually get left behind? 

383
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
It seems pretty strange to me. 

384
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I made a copy of some video editing software that you can check out. 

385
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And I've also written out some instructions that should help you get up to speed. 

386
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I came here to find out if I was an artist. 

387
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I didn't create from my core. 

388
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I didn't stay in my truth. 

389
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I didn't make mixed media drawings.  I didn't paint. 

390
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I didn't draw. 

391
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Given free time to do with which whatever I want, I've done nothing. 

392
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
-- scream -- 

393
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I am not an artist. 

394
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
-- laughs -- 

395
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I have no future. 

396
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Can you steam my broccoli with no olive oil and no butter?  Can I have a baked potato instead of mashed potatoes? 

397
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Can I get that with fat-free dressing?  Can I please substitute --?  Can I get that with cheese? 

398
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Do you have Harvey's?  Can I get creme brulee?  No substitutions!  It used to be on the menu.  Can I see --? 

399
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Grilled cheese.  -- with chicken.  How much --.  -- switch to fries. 

400
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Can I get greens instead of fries? 

401
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I don't know what to say.  This is the problem talking.  You know, you never get to say the things -- that you want to say -- 

402
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
-- and then, when you get the chance to say it, words are not enough. 

403
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So you just lock up. 

404
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You don't say anything.  That's when you hear sounds -- or worse, you don't, you hear just, like, some filler -- 

405
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
-- something to take up the space.  Fill in the gap that's there because you don't know how to say what you really want to say. 

406
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Probably it can't be said. 

407
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
What I'm really trying to say is: I like you. 

408
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I haf ze good news of ze test back from the Herpes Two, and I no haf Herpes Two. 

409
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
C L E A N 

410
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
On one level, time here in Vermont is flying by. 

411
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
But on another, it's like time is moving so slow waiting to see you. 

412
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
If you appeared magically before me,right now, it wouldn't be soon enough. 

413
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Could you bring the catsup over? 

414
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
No problem. 

415
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Thanks. 

416
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
You're welcome. 

417
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
My feet are cold. 

418
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
My feet are cold. 

419
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
No offense but can you shut up! 

420
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I don't need another boyfriend who controls me, and this no-talking thing is just a device to-- 

421
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I don't want to be controlled, or harassed into modes of thinking in my analytical process -- 

422
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
If you think of having to do things analytically, and getting confused by other people's thoughts -- 

423
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I'm sick of your imposing your thoughts and beliefs on me. 

424
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I'm sick of your reasons for wanting me to keep writing, that you've avoiding me, and trying to control me, 

425
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and you don't trust me.  What are you trying to prevent? 

426
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
What are you trying to protect yourself from? 

427
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Why don't you want to find out more about me?  Why don't you want to get to know me? 

428
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
What are you afraid of?  Who are you trying to protect yourself from? 

429
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Why don't you want to know me better?  Why won't you talk to me?  Why don't you trust me? 

430
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
don't 

431
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
discover 

432
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
tired of falling 

433
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
stupid 

434
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
medio crity 

435
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It ran out! 

436
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You're not going to say anything! 

437
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:57,000
(crying) What I was trying to say to you -- what I was trying -- (shouts) 

438
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
(weeping) I don't want -- Stop! Crying! 

439
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Listen to me!  Listen  (weeping) Listen to me! 

440
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
(shouting) Listen to what I'm trying to tell you! 

441
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
No!  Jesus. 

442
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I mean, okay.  Obviously we should talk.  Of course.  Right? 

443
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Talk. 

444
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
You know when this was in storage the rats must have gotten into it. 

445
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I do tend to try to exist maybe through the video camera -- 

446
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
but for processing things in life through artistic mediums, 

447
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'd rather look at it that way.  We can use these creative lubricants to help us find out who we're trying to be. 

448
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Why should we be dealing with who we've been, you know?  That's pretty much irrelevant, you know -- 

449
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I just feel like you're -- canning that experience.  You're just stopping it dead in its tracks 

450
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
only because maybe you're discovering things that you don't want to discover, 

451
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
through our communication -- I created this version of you 

452
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and any of the blanks I just assumed were pleasant. 

453
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:29,000
and I really feel bad about saying this, but it's starting to be very apparent that they're not, you know? 

454
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And if we start talking, it's just a matter of time before all that stuff comes out. 

455
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Let's be honest with ourselves, it's going to end -- you know -- it's just a question of how. 

456
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You know. 

457
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
How our story ends. 

458
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And -- it just seems before that happens we should try to experience more, learn more from each other. 

459
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I guess you're not ready for this. 

460
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I don't want to ruin what we have, you know? 

461
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It sounds like you're into this experiment and into this process but you're not really into me. 

462
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Well, you either click or you don't 

463
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I feel like my childhood left me with some serious abandonment issues. 

464
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I'm really smart.  I have a great tight pussy.  I can make lasagna. 

465
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I guess because I've never felt that I wsa beautiful, I would like him to think I was. 

466
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I don't have any idea just -- I feel so lost. 

467
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I want a man to say -- I love you. 

468
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I'm going to say something. 

469
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I'm going to film it. 

470
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
We've all all the writing -- Go all the way! -- and the drawings and all the video -- to make this into something. 

471
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Isn't this crazy?  I don't think we should even ask ourselves questions like that. 

472
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
There's sort of like this compulsive nature to our relationship 

473
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:16,000
--for it to be in creation.  I'm not interested in arriving anywhere.  I'm interested in the process of getting there. 

474
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:32,000
we solve our problems -- I don't think anybody brings out in me what -- the hell is wrong with you except you -- honest 

475
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:42,000
--it gets really fucked up sometimes -- we are --faith in a relationship -- on the same page with you -- no discussion -- you say jump 

476
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:49,000
--I say how high -- I don't know what's going on inside my head -- it's the difficulty of executing this project it's kind 

477
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:01,000
it's feeling very familial --  part of the question is -- qo you want to do? -- I don't know if I want to -- let's not fight -- I want to be 

478
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I just want to say that --that's the big question -- it would be a lot easier than trying to make it work. 

479
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Well, congratulations!  You've been selected for one of twelve narrative feature spots 

480
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
How long have you been working on this film? 

481
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
A year.  -- Oh, congratulations. 

482
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I do just now and then kind of like lean off into this kind of question of -- 

483
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
What's happening?  What do you think is happening? 

484
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
There's never an end.  You resolve -- a nice day. 

485
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
There's too many fucking weird little things to say to say we're ever sorry -- 

486
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
As if there's no fucking other shit! 

487
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Do you understand what it feels like? 

488
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
-- such an asshole! 

489
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Damn it!  Damn it!  Damn it! 

490
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I'm just making a decision on my own but it hurts! 

491
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I hate it so much. 

492
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Is this the part where we grow old together? 

493
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I can't believe we're doing this. 

494
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
This is it!  This is it! 

495
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Owooo!   Owooo! 

496
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
What will -- You're not going to say anything more? 

497
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
What do you want to get this -- I am totally -- I want to stop being so pissed off. 

498
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Well, I am compli -- listen, Arin.  And just be natural, be present -- 

499
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Lean in.  Y'know -- come on in. 

500
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Yeah, okay.  So less --.  Yes.  Like that.  That's good. 

501
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I'll just fucking do it.  Like I don't--  Without all that.  And -- I'm talking to you right now. 

502
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I will do whatever it takes to get this stupid fucking intro out there. 

503
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
All right?  Okay.  So what do you want said? 

504
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Let's discuss that so that it's crystal clear. 

505
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Are we going to be able to fix this relationship? 

506
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Are we going to be able to --- 

507
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
--fall in love again?
