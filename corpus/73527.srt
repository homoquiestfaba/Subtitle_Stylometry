1
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,246
Get out of here!
Get off!

2
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:02,584
Excuse me.

3
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:04,520
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

4
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,351
I was expecting
to be met.

5
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:20,367
Good morning,
Truscott.

6
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,340
I am Belansai.

7
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,171
Welcome
to our country.

8
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,211
He's a bright chap.

9
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:39,548
He'll be the head man
of his Longhouse in two years.

10
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:41,448
John Truscott.

11
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,720
Henry Bullard.

12
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,922
I'm the governor
of this district,

13
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:49,152
but you just
think of me as God.

14
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,318
Hop aboard.

15
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:58,967
You've got far too good
a degree for this job.

16
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:02,905
What are you running away from?
Your debts?

17
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:05,507
Your family?
Or a woman?

18
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:07,443
No, no debts.
No woman.

19
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:09,445
My mother
died two years ago.

20
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:11,747
My father was killed
at Passchendaele, so...

21
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:14,283
Well, why in God's name
are you here?

22
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:16,718
My father was
a district officer out here.

23
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:17,753
William C. Truscott?

24
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:19,655
Ahhh.

25
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:22,324
He'd drawn up a plan
to bring education to the Iban

26
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:24,326
which the governor general
had approved,

27
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,261
but then he had
to go back to the war...

28
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:27,863
and it never happened.

29
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:31,266
And you've brought
this plan with you, have you?

30
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:34,036
Yes, I think it's our duty
to educate primitive people.

31
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:36,638
God, you sound
a sanctimonious little prig.

32
00:13:36,638 --> 00:13:39,308
Still, you're young.

33
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:42,243
Sarawak'll knock
it out of you.

34
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:49,218
Famous,
you lazy bastard!

35
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:51,286
Look at the state
of this place.

36
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:54,289
Bring Truscott tea and gadgets
double quick.

37
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:55,958
Come on.
Chibi, chibi, chibi.

38
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,327
It's got bugs in there.

39
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:00,596
He's the best cook
in Sarawak.

40
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:03,087
Though strictly speaking
he's still on parole.

41
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,402
What did he do?

42
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:10,506
Oh, he hacked some damn fool
rickshaw driver to death.

43
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:13,308
But you should
taste his meringues.

44
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:15,511
- Shouldn't he be in--
- Now, tomorrow,

45
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:19,448
you've an invitation
from your local Longhouse,

46
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:21,250
the Gawa Kenyalong.

47
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,052
So Belansai'll
pick you up.

48
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:26,155
The feast to honor
the war god

49
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:29,057
where they take the giant hornbill
statue down from the rafters.

50
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:30,759
Oh, God.

51
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,262
You read-- books.

52
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:36,064
I'm afraid they insist
upon it at university.

53
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,966
Do they?

54
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:40,594
Has it come
to that now?

55
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,378
Yes, I'll--

56
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:51,539
I'll see you
in a day or so.

57
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:55,284
Excuse me.

58
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:58,387
Excuse me.
Excuse me...

59
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:00,582
What's my job?

60
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:38,727
This is my father,
Melaka.

61
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,786
He is head man
of the Longhouse.

62
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:00,115
This is rice wine.

63
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:02,884
Ah. Um...

64
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:05,120
I won't drink
on duty, thanks.

65
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,385
To refuse is an insult.

66
00:17:11,753 --> 00:17:15,123
Left, right.
Left, right.

67
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:16,852
It's chibi,
chibi, chibi!

68
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:28,227
It is a... very ancient
tribal dance.

69
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:39,841
Oh, no, um... no.

70
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,209
Very kind
of you to offer,

71
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:44,045
but I think I'll give it
a miss this time round.

72
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:45,981
You must make us
entertainment.

73
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:48,817
A song? A dance?

74
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:51,219
A poem?

75
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:53,312
Perhaps all three.

76
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:25,454
"The sand of the desert
is sodden red,

77
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:28,890
Red with the wreck
of the ranks that broke.

78
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,693
The Gatling's jammed
and the Colonel dead,

79
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:35,330
And the regiment blind
with dust and smoke.

80
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,899
The river of death
has brimmed his banks,

81
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:40,902
And England's far
and honor's a name,

82
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:44,473
But the voice of a schoolboy
rallies the ranks,

83
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:45,874
'Play up!

84
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,967
Play up
and play the game!'"

85
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:11,032
" Da-dum-dum-dum "

86
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:14,402
" Da-da-da-da,
Dum-dum-dum-dum "

87
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:16,597
" Da-da-da-da "

88
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:47,194
Oh, Truscott, you are very
funny Englishman.

89
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:01,182
Excuse me.
What's going on?

90
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:03,652
The dancing is over.

91
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:05,552
We go to sleep now.

92
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:04,779
You deliberately dropped me
in it, didn't you?

93
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:06,948
You know I made a complete
fool of myself?

94
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:08,950
They like a man
who makes them laugh.

95
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,987
Iban society is based
on heavy drinking,

96
00:22:11,987 --> 00:22:15,123
violent sport
and practical jokes.

97
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:17,392
Just think of it as
English public school

98
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:18,994
without the buggery.

99
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm on a mission to civilize,
not to entertain.

100
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:26,968
The mining concessions
at Kera Pulau

101
00:22:26,968 --> 00:22:29,270
have been trespassing
outside their boundaries.

102
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,139
Your local Longhouse

103
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:33,875
got to some Chinese miners
before I did.

104
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,244
You're going to have
to bring in their heads.

105
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:38,013
What?

106
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:39,614
Well...

107
00:22:39,614 --> 00:22:42,250
we limit the areas where
the mining concerns can--

108
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,653
No, no, no.
You said...

109
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:46,655
you said "their heads."

110
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:48,623
Well, yes.

111
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:50,392
The Iban have
cut them off.

112
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:52,553
What?

113
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:55,858
Ahh.

114
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:01,227
My dear.

115
00:23:04,572 --> 00:23:06,408
This is Selima.

116
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:08,743
She's going
to live with you.

117
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:11,146
As what?

118
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:14,482
Uh... she performs
wifely duties.

119
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:17,849
Oh yeah?
What... sewing?

120
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:24,415
She performs wifely duties
in the bedroom.

121
00:23:27,662 --> 00:23:30,358
- For God's sakes, man.
- I sleep with you.

122
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,070
We expect you to know
the language within six months.

123
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,806
Selima's what's known around here
as a "sleeping dictionary."

124
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,107
Sleep...

125
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:41,443
My mother was also
sleeping dictionary.

126
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:43,678
That's why I speak
the King English.

127
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:46,715
There's nothing like bed
for learning a language.

128
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:49,050
It's the only reason
I speak Portuguese.

129
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,986
No, look, poor girl.

130
00:23:51,986 --> 00:23:55,023
- She was just-- picked?
- I pick you.

131
00:23:55,023 --> 00:23:56,725
And she's really choosy.

132
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:59,794
She turned down
my last two cadet officers.

133
00:23:59,794 --> 00:24:02,731
Listen, your contract
forbids you

134
00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:05,166
to marry
for three years.

135
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:08,069
Three years can be
very lonely.

136
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:10,438
And after three years?

137
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:13,930
We'll probably all be dead,
so why worry?

138
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,279
Oh, dear.

139
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,081
Listen...

140
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:22,951
you'll go home
on leave to England

141
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:26,387
and you'll come back with
a rosy-cheeked little wife.

142
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:29,657
Selima will go home
to her Longhouse

143
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:32,460
speaking
fluent English.

144
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,131
Oh, damn it, man,
it's worked for centuries.

145
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:38,326
There's no reason
why you should be different.

146
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:46,207
No, I'm sorry, no. No.

147
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:48,042
I know you think
I'm just some young idiot,

148
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:50,845
but if I don't follow what
I think's right, what else is there?

149
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:54,516
Then you'd better find another way
to learn the damn language.

150
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:57,152
Because if a so-called
educated man

151
00:24:57,152 --> 00:24:59,621
can't speak the language
of the people he governs,

152
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:01,589
he's no right to be here!

153
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:06,060
Fine, maybe she can stay as...
just a dictionary?

154
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,930
- If she doesn't mind, that is.
- What?

155
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,923
Mind not sleeping with you?
I'm sure she'll survive.

156
00:25:18,406 --> 00:25:20,408
She said yes.

157
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:22,677
What else did she say?

158
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:25,613
You'll have to learn Iban
and find out, won't you?

159
00:25:25,613 --> 00:25:28,275
I'd stand back
if I were you.

160
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,791
Ha ha!

161
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,182
Ants.

162
00:26:01,182 --> 00:26:04,242
Yes, ants.
Thank you very much.

163
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:08,245
Good night.

164
00:26:15,663 --> 00:26:18,325
You say no,
she get very angry.

165
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:27,798
Rain always stop
in morning.

166
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:09,847
Sleep tight and don't
let the bedbugs bite.

167
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:22,390
Chinese heads
as per request.

168
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:25,523
Thank you.

169
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:37,211
As you know, the Longhouse
will be fined.

170
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:40,009
Beyond that, there will
be no further action.

171
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:00,197
Monkey heads.

172
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,945
We make a joke on you.

173
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:12,814
Maybe I'll make
a joke on you

174
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:15,282
and bring a detachment
of colonial police up the river.

175
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:21,356
I want those heads delivered
to my bungalow by tomorrow morning

176
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:23,916
or I will confiscate your--

177
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:27,394
your pigs.

178
00:28:36,637 --> 00:28:38,406
Master?

179
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:40,431
I bring you someone.

180
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,612
This is Jasmine.

181
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:46,180
He is assistant chef.

182
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,349
What do we need
an assistant chef for?

183
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:50,885
- He assist you.
- Me?

184
00:28:50,885 --> 00:28:52,620
He assist you in...

185
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,422
private way.

186
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:57,492
Is this one of your relatives?

187
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:59,594
No, no, no.
He very clean.

188
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:01,896
He come from
Englishman on coast

189
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:04,632
who too old
for all that now.

190
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:07,135
What?

191
00:29:07,135 --> 00:29:09,337
Oh, good God.
Get him out of--

192
00:29:09,337 --> 00:29:10,638
No, get him out now!

193
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:12,573
- But, master--
- Get him out of here!

194
00:29:12,573 --> 00:29:14,666
And Selima,
bring me a whiskey.

195
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:18,479
What are you doing?!

196
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,714
I'm not servant.

197
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:21,949
Fine.
You don't have to be a servant.

198
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:24,118
You're fired!
Dismissed!

199
00:29:24,118 --> 00:29:28,089
You cannot fire me because
I am not yours to fire.

200
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:30,216
I fire you.

201
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:34,691
You are dismissed.

202
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:40,566
Make no attempt
to follow me.

203
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,600
- What are you doing?
- I live here now.

204
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,002
You can't live there.

205
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:17,371
Then I will live
in the jungle.

206
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:19,640
I like the jungle.

207
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,677
No, listen. You must go
back to the Longhouse.

208
00:30:22,677 --> 00:30:24,579
They will
laugh at her.

209
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:27,878
They will say she choose you
but you no have her.

210
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:31,919
- Is that true?
- No.

211
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,589
They will say you
not sleep with her

212
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:37,058
because she too
pig ugly.

213
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:40,027
Listen, I don't
think you're ugly.

214
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:42,120
I think you're
very beautiful.

215
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:46,430
I don't sleep with you
because of my beliefs.

216
00:30:49,337 --> 00:30:52,974
Because... the spirits
of my country forbid it.

217
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:57,468
You want to sleep with me
but you forbid by your spirit?

218
00:30:58,546 --> 00:31:00,605
Yes, you could say that.

219
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:04,118
I will go to my tree now.

220
00:31:04,118 --> 00:31:05,720
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

221
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,557
Perhaps we could
have another try.

222
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:13,789
If you're willing
to re-employ me, that is.

223
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:21,793
I will give you
one more chance.

224
00:31:30,244 --> 00:31:32,914
Hey!

225
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:34,649
I want a word
with you.

226
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:37,785
Last night you got
completely drunk again.

227
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:39,787
My other masters,
they fine me

228
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:41,789
one week pay
if I blind drunk,

229
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:45,126
two week pay if I blind,
legless drunk.

230
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:48,796
I blind drunk two time
a month regular,

231
00:31:48,796 --> 00:31:50,889
so very cheap cook.

232
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,802
Fair enough.

233
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:11,683
Wait.

234
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:43,684
Do you play croquet?

235
00:32:43,684 --> 00:32:45,486
No.

236
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:48,011
Help me reload,
would you?

237
00:32:49,757 --> 00:32:52,193
I'm clearing the jungle
for a croquet lawn

238
00:32:52,193 --> 00:32:54,695
for when Cecil,
my daughter, comes out.

239
00:32:54,695 --> 00:32:57,231
It's much quicker than
a working party from the jail.

240
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:59,667
Aggie Bullard,
Henry's wife.

241
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,669
You must be Truscott.

242
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:05,172
How are you getting on
with Henry's damn fool tests?

243
00:33:05,172 --> 00:33:07,663
I think next
I have to wrestle a crocodile.

244
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,947
Sleeping dictionary
shaping up all right?

245
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,415
Truscott!

246
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:17,213
Us women don't know anything
about all of that.

247
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:19,754
- Truscott!
- And for heaven's sake,

248
00:33:19,754 --> 00:33:21,222
bed her or the Iban'll think

249
00:33:21,222 --> 00:33:23,257
there's something wrong
with you down below.

250
00:33:23,257 --> 00:33:25,192
Excuse me.

251
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:26,955
Re-group!

252
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,802
Sorry?

253
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:37,805
You're not picking up
the language very fast, are you?

254
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:40,933
And where are those
Chinese heads?!

255
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,339
You are in the bathroom.

256
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:55,150
I am in...?

257
00:33:59,794 --> 00:34:01,659
the bedroom.

258
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:17,867
What do I do?

259
00:34:20,114 --> 00:34:21,649
I...

260
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:23,879
I say good night
to my father.

261
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:36,429
Where do you go?

262
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,105
Bedroom.

263
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:47,199
Bedroom...
bedroom.

264
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,007
W-what next?

265
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:04,490
I-I go to sleep.

266
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,836
Do English people
have dreams at night?

267
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:26,247
Sometimes, yeah.

268
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:29,216
Are we really
that strange?

269
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:32,477
Have you ever
sleep with a woman?

270
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:39,627
I won't
till I get married.

271
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:42,229
That's our way.

272
00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:44,865
But when you marry
you'll be very bad at sex

273
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:46,696
and your wife
will be unhappy.

274
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:52,702
I'll take evening classes,
I promise.

275
00:35:59,346 --> 00:36:01,549
I've never met anyone...

276
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:03,744
even a little like you.

277
00:36:08,856 --> 00:36:11,086
Whyever did you
choose me?

278
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:17,119
Your dance is not
the dance of an Englishman.

279
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,404
Good night.

280
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:25,895
Yes.

281
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,633
I thought you didn't like
our education.

282
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:55,669
You want to educate us
like your father did?

283
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:57,805
You were educated because
you're the chief's son.

284
00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:59,673
Shouldn't others have
the same opportunity?

285
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:01,509
William, William,

286
00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:04,645
Henry, Henry,
Richard, John, Henry,

287
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:07,615
Edward, Edward,
Richard, Henry,

288
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:09,717
Henry, Edward,
Edward, Richard,

289
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:11,385
Henry, Henry, Edward--

290
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:13,153
Mary, Elizabeth,
James, Charles,

291
00:37:13,153 --> 00:37:16,490
Charles, James, William,
George, George, George, George,

292
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,627
William, Victoria,
Edward, George, Edward, George.

293
00:37:19,627 --> 00:37:22,129
The kings of England.

294
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:24,465
And why do I need
to know that?

295
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:26,700
The mission school
tries to turn us

296
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,536
into little Englishmen.

297
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:31,403
They didn't do a very good job
with you, did they?

298
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:34,308
You missed Queen Anne,
by the way.

299
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:35,969
You missed King Stephen.

300
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:43,584
I hear when you were young,

301
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:45,319
you were a champion at
the underwater battles.

302
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:46,754
When I was young?

303
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:49,590
I am still champion
of 1 0 Longhouses.

304
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,956
Yes, they say you can
beat any girl on the river.

305
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:56,324
Will you
challenge me then?

306
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:29,657
How you--
how you do that?

307
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:31,859
Some Englishmen

308
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,228
can breathe underwater

309
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:36,696
through their ears.

310
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:01,588
I wonder if I might
have a word about...

311
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:03,556
those heads.

312
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:09,953
It's lovely
workmanship.

313
00:40:11,131 --> 00:40:13,734
I'll add those
to the collection.

314
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:16,970
The ants eaten
your dinner jacket yet?

315
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,639
I think there's
an arm or two left.

316
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,773
Good.

317
00:40:19,773 --> 00:40:23,143
My daughter Cecilia
is arriving for Christmas.

318
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:25,546
First class honors degree
at Oxford.

319
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:26,780
You'd like her.

320
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,270
Come to dinner.

321
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:39,226
Oh!

322
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:41,328
How drunk is he?

323
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:44,661
Blind, legless, daft,
sick, smelly drunk.

324
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,108
My mother
read that to me.

325
00:40:54,108 --> 00:40:56,577
My father
read it to me.

326
00:40:56,577 --> 00:40:58,212
Do you remember
your father?

327
00:40:58,212 --> 00:41:01,443
He go back to England
when I am four.

328
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:05,351
My dad died
when I was four.

329
00:41:08,856 --> 00:41:11,058
"Deep, deep
beneath the sea

330
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:13,427
where the water is
clear as purest glass

331
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:15,863
Iies the palace
of the Sea King.

332
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:19,166
There behind its...
walls of coral

333
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:22,567
and roof of cockleshells
lives a little mermaid."

334
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:27,474
You can read English.

335
00:41:27,474 --> 00:41:30,144
I remember it
by my heart.

336
00:41:30,144 --> 00:41:32,476
I made him read it
many time.

337
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:40,518
Write a word from it.

338
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:47,256
"Deep."

339
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:50,124
Now you.

340
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:03,371
"Hand."

341
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:20,686
"Arm."

342
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:39,108
Neck.

343
00:42:51,558 --> 00:42:53,822
Lips.

344
00:43:27,094 --> 00:43:29,221
Breast.

345
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:04,398
I-I'm sorry.

346
00:44:04,398 --> 00:44:07,367
That was too quick,
wasn't it?

347
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:10,928
You teach me English,
I'll teach you this.

348
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:17,235
School is not finished.

349
00:45:55,942 --> 00:45:59,469
Not quite the education
my father had in mind.

350
00:46:04,651 --> 00:46:06,653
Why do you always go?

351
00:46:06,653 --> 00:46:09,451
For sleeping dictionary,
it is proper.

352
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,129
For the Iban,

353
00:46:16,129 --> 00:46:19,466
if a man and a woman wake up
together five nights in a row,

354
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:21,024
they are engaged.

355
00:46:22,235 --> 00:46:24,533
You don't want that,
do you?

356
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,796
Cecilia's got a degree
in anthropology, you know?

357
00:46:49,796 --> 00:46:52,499
She did her thesis
on the Iban.

358
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:54,034
- Really?
- Mmm.

359
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:55,969
Why did you choose
the Iban to study?

360
00:46:55,969 --> 00:46:57,704
I lived here until I was five.

361
00:46:57,704 --> 00:46:59,739
Till Mother and Father
couldn't stand me any longer

362
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:01,172
and shipped me off to school.

363
00:47:02,576 --> 00:47:04,444
But I always
remembered them.

364
00:47:04,444 --> 00:47:07,047
The way you'd never see them arrive,

365
00:47:07,047 --> 00:47:09,816
but then suddenly there they'd be,
standing beside you

366
00:47:09,816 --> 00:47:12,252
as if they'd
been there since...

367
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:13,587
time began.

368
00:47:13,587 --> 00:47:17,724
Although, for them, of course,
time only began 53 years ago.

369
00:47:17,724 --> 00:47:20,827
- Really?
- Yes, the year Krakatoa exploded.

370
00:47:20,827 --> 00:47:23,830
- That's their year zero.
- Is that true?

371
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:25,665
How the deuce
do you know that?

372
00:47:25,665 --> 00:47:28,657
- Well, I listen.
- Do you now?

373
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:34,307
Well, I can't wait to get
stuck in and meet the Iban.

374
00:47:34,307 --> 00:47:36,343
Shipperly's taken over
from Teague--

375
00:47:36,343 --> 00:47:38,245
chap I told you about.

376
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:40,480
Went doolally
and ate his own toes.

377
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,250
I'll tell you something
I bet you don't know.

378
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,720
Back in Victorian times,
the young officers coming out here

379
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,190
were given a young woman
from the local head-hunting tribes

380
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,215
to share their bed...

381
00:47:53,793 --> 00:47:56,363
so they could learn
the language quickly.

382
00:47:56,363 --> 00:47:59,232
I hardly think so, darling.

383
00:47:59,232 --> 00:48:02,002
Now you are having us on,
aren't you?

384
00:48:02,002 --> 00:48:03,731
No, that's true.

385
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:07,541
I've heard tell of it
from a very old Iban.

386
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,110
- See?
- Well...

387
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,846
if it did exist,
I'm sure it was purely

388
00:48:12,846 --> 00:48:15,115
a matter of convenience
and no...

389
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:17,050
higher feelings
were involved.

390
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,987
- Don't see why.
- Surely you can't seriously believe

391
00:48:20,987 --> 00:48:23,790
that a primitive
head-huntress

392
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,027
and an English officer
could experience love.

393
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:28,528
Not love, maybe,

394
00:48:28,528 --> 00:48:30,664
but I'm sure they could
feel a great deal.

395
00:48:30,664 --> 00:48:32,299
Whatever an Englishman felt,

396
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:34,434
he would never
let that get in the way

397
00:48:34,434 --> 00:48:36,436
of his duty
to the local people.

398
00:48:36,436 --> 00:48:38,505
My Iban wouldn't
think less of an officer--

399
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:41,174
"My Iban"?
They're not your Iban.

400
00:48:41,174 --> 00:48:44,010
They might be God's,
but they're certainly not yours.

401
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:46,580
We've got enough bloody dictators
in Europe, thank you.

402
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,815
- All I'm saying--
- And all I'm saying,

403
00:48:48,815 --> 00:48:50,784
is that an English officer

404
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:53,053
would never let
his country down.

405
00:48:53,053 --> 00:48:55,112
Nor his family.

406
00:48:57,624 --> 00:48:59,455
Would he, Truscott?

407
00:49:00,994 --> 00:49:02,825
No, sir.

408
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,123
So is she pretty?

409
00:49:30,123 --> 00:49:32,125
Well, she's fairly pretty.

410
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,150
But does she have wings?

411
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:54,672
What happened to
the spirits of your country?

412
00:49:56,483 --> 00:50:00,249
They grew old and tired and packed
their bags and left for England.

413
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:52,372
This is a land dispute
between two Longhouses.

414
00:50:52,372 --> 00:50:54,274
It's fiendishly
complicated.

415
00:50:54,274 --> 00:50:56,643
You must be sick of me
following you around.

416
00:50:56,643 --> 00:50:58,378
No, I know how
interested you are.

417
00:50:58,378 --> 00:51:00,780
At least this time we escaped
the dreaded Shipperly.

418
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,882
He's harmless, but...
he's like all men

419
00:51:02,882 --> 00:51:05,151
who've been to an all-male
school and college.

420
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:07,854
The only women they're comfortable
with are their mothers.

421
00:51:07,854 --> 00:51:09,823
He talks to me like
I'm a Labrador.

422
00:51:09,823 --> 00:51:12,359
I went to an all-male school
and an all-male college.

423
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,794
Then something
must've changed you.

424
00:51:14,794 --> 00:51:17,319
Well...

425
00:51:19,466 --> 00:51:22,060
yes.
Being out here, I imagine.

426
00:51:24,003 --> 00:51:26,673
So have you
sorted out this dispute?

427
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:28,470
Yes, I think so,
yes.

428
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,783
See, it's impossible
to sort out the argument.

429
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:39,352
So if I decide
for one side or the other,

430
00:51:39,352 --> 00:51:41,946
it'll just seem
unfair to them.

431
00:51:55,535 --> 00:51:57,503
Pull!

432
00:52:09,182 --> 00:52:12,515
Would you mind?
That's it, perfect. Thank you.

433
00:52:15,054 --> 00:52:16,612
Thank you.

434
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:20,251
Isn't she amazing?

435
00:52:22,629 --> 00:52:24,297
What did she say?

436
00:52:24,297 --> 00:52:27,934
There's not a precise
English translation for that one.

437
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:30,270
Cecil, these children
love having their photo--

438
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,272
She's wonderful.
I wish I looked like her.

439
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:34,365
Hands higher, please.

440
00:52:36,242 --> 00:52:37,744
That's it.
Perfect.

441
00:52:37,744 --> 00:52:40,269
Cecil, I don't think
she wants her photograph taken.

442
00:52:42,482 --> 00:52:44,684
- Just a couple more.
- Truscott!

443
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:47,619
Go and see what's happening
down there, will you?

444
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:52,890
Ask her to keep up
that fierce expression, please.

445
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:56,796
- Cecil--
- Truscott!

446
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:59,356
I told you to go and see
what the devil's happening!

447
00:53:16,082 --> 00:53:18,318
She won't understand.

448
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:20,086
She's Yakata.

449
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:22,255
You can tell by
the turquoise bracelet.

450
00:53:22,255 --> 00:53:25,088
I studied them.

451
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:30,763
She was bleeding
through her skin.

452
00:53:30,763 --> 00:53:32,632
Come away
and wash your hands.

453
00:53:32,632 --> 00:53:35,835
There's a dozen more dead bodies
turned up at Laksai,

454
00:53:35,835 --> 00:53:38,605
50 miles out
of their territory.

455
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:41,374
I'd better go up river
and have a look, hadn't I?

456
00:53:41,374 --> 00:53:43,176
No, you hadn't!

457
00:53:43,176 --> 00:53:45,912
It's dangerous enough up there
without an epidemic.

458
00:53:45,912 --> 00:53:47,881
That's my job.

459
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:50,416
They'll have your head
as soon as look at you.

460
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:53,152
Besides he doesn't
speak the language.

461
00:53:53,152 --> 00:53:55,421
Well,
I'll take Selima.

462
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:57,056
She speaks
half a dozen languages.

463
00:53:57,056 --> 00:53:59,893
And Belansai, no one's
going to tangle with him.

464
00:53:59,893 --> 00:54:00,960
Send that idiot Shipperly.

465
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,121
A few poisoned darts
might liven him up.

466
00:54:04,797 --> 00:54:07,664
I'll set out
tomorrow morning, shall I?

467
00:54:10,103 --> 00:54:11,638
Aggie,
I can't send Shipperly.

468
00:54:11,638 --> 00:54:13,606
You said yourself
the man's an idiot...

469
00:54:17,043 --> 00:54:19,739
If you're about to be killed,
at least stay for dinner.

470
00:54:31,257 --> 00:54:33,725
Terrific girl, Cecil.
Isn't she?

471
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:36,718
Absolutely, yeah.

472
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:42,168
If you want a child
properly educated,

473
00:54:42,168 --> 00:54:44,103
you've got to send them
back home.

474
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:47,040
But you can't be
in two places at once.

475
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,723
And I thought
it was my duty...

476
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:52,292
to stay with Henry.
