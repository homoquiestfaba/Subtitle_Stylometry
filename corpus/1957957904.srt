1
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,979
Okay, here we go.

2
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:15,487
Stay loose.

3
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:30,836
Hello?

4
00:00:30,904 --> 00:00:33,099
Anybody in there? Hello.

5
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:39,778
Hi.

6
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,783
Right.

7
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:53,524
- My turn? Do I go?
- Please.

8
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:56,290
- The "bless me, Father" thing?
- Yes, my son.

9
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:57,591
Right.

10
00:00:57,664 --> 00:01:00,599
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been...

11
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:05,469
20, 25 years
since my last confession.

12
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:09,908
I've used the Lord's name in vain
20, 30 times today.

13
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:17,780
Okay. Where do I start?

14
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:23,320
I've got a problem
that's causing me pain and heartache.

15
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,358
Her name is Linda Paliski.

16
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:31,196
She is everything.

17
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,199
You know what I'm saying, Doc?

18
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:35,633
Well, you wouldn't know
what I'm saying.

19
00:01:35,702 --> 00:01:39,297
But she's like...
How can I say it in your terms?

20
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:42,638
She's my light, my beacon.

21
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:48,347
My amazing grace.

22
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:52,112
Look, changed man.
When can I move in?

23
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:56,288
Do you have any dog food?

24
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:59,951
Come on. How long
are those things good for?

25
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,427
- I'll get you what I have.
- I'll come up and get it.

26
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,327
No, you won't.

27
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:07,765
Is this going to be a permanent thing,
because I gave Blinker to you.

28
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:10,428
We're sort of like apart now.

29
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:13,496
She's dumped me.

30
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,505
This is Rhonda.
What do you want?

31
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:19,704
How courteous. It's me, Gary.

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,613
Linda wants me to come up
and get some dog food.

33
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:24,617
Hold on.

34
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:26,983
Great, Blinkie.
Me and you, baby.

35
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:33,325
The thing that really
gets to the problem...

36
00:02:33,393 --> 00:02:35,588
is that I'm in sales.

37
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:37,425
It's not sales.

38
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:41,263
It's resales. I'm a scalper.

39
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:43,098
I'm a ticket scalper.

40
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,130
I'm a scalper, for chrissakes.
That's why she dumped me.

41
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,143
It's been two months, and she hasn't
directed one word towards me.

42
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:53,338
Even a look in my direction.

43
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:57,349
I'd like to do the right thing.
I'd like to get a legit gig.

44
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:00,147
But those things are like another world.
Are you getting this?

45
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,450
Because it doesn't stop there.

46
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:05,719
I've got this guy that works for me.
He's my holder.

47
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:08,283
Talk about carrying the cross.

48
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:10,796
You got mustard on your chin, Benny.

49
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,432
Tell me something.

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,095
- You seen any oscars today?
- Nope. Haven't seen a cop all morning.

51
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,071
- Benny, who's that?
- What?

52
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,802
That guy over there.
Uniform. Hat.

53
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:24,741
Badge.

54
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:29,248
That's another navy blue.
I should've seem him.

55
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:31,910
Can we pay attention here?
I'm trying to work.

56
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:34,112
I'm on it, Chief. I'm with you.

57
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:38,487
I'm gonna do such a good job for you
'cause I love you so much.

58
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:41,891
And I'm just here,
I'm just paralyzed.

59
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:45,454
I just need...
I just want a little guidance.

60
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:48,626
Just a little something.
Gimme a sign.

61
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:52,035
A little light at the end of the tunnel.
Something to hang my hat on.

62
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:55,131
Recognizing your problem
is half the battle, my son.

63
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,142
Find a new path to travel.

64
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,178
Follow your heart.
Do God's work.

65
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:02,147
The strength is within you.
Find the courage.

66
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:04,149
What, are you in a hurry?

67
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:07,851
God will show you the way.

68
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:11,379
I'm here for the "how" part. How?

69
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,653
You know, the light, the vision.

70
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:15,922
As I said, God will show you the way.

71
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:18,430
Trust in Him.
You'll find strength in Him.

72
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:20,432
Go in peace, my son.

73
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:25,332
But before you do, you have any tickets
for the Knicks' game Friday night?

74
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:31,801
Sold out.
I got two tickets.

75
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:37,578
Van Gogh Ear ashtrays!
$10, two for $20. What a deal.

76
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:40,814
It's sold out.
30 bucks apiece.

77
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,320
Knock yourself out.

78
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,017
I'd like a refund.
I didn't enjoy the show.

79
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:47,526
I can't give you a refund.
I didn't produce the show.

80
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:50,893
Gary, tell the lady
we don't give refunds.

81
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:54,092
Refunds? We got refunds.
The guy in the red hat.

82
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:57,295
I'm sorry. The guy in the red hat.

83
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,862
You can talk to him over there.
Good luck. We'll see you next year.

84
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:05,567
Take the tickets to Mrs. Manhime.
Pick up $200.

85
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:09,672
- Manhime. M-A-N-H-l-M-E.
- I got it.

86
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:14,049
Come on. Oyster Perpetual!
El Presidente. Submariners.

87
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:17,420
They're releasing tickets for tonight
at the Meadowlands.

88
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:21,257
We're making a move to Jersey.
Pick up those tickets at will-call.

89
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:25,025
And see Mrs. Manhime
and collect $200.

90
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:26,565
Let's go.

91
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:30,192
- How you feeling?
- I'm okay. Just hate this business.

92
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,261
Go. You got it.

93
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:44,706
I'm gonna hang around here,
mop up the museum. I don't wanna go.

94
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:47,947
Are you crazy? The joint's
almost closed. No one can sell a ticket.

95
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:50,489
- Get on the bus.
- I'll take whatever you got, half face.

96
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:56,086
You got it. Here you go.
Come back. You're crazy.

97
00:05:56,163 --> 00:06:00,532
Save me some tickets, all right?
Okay. We'll see ya.

98
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:12,374
Arigato, fellow-san!

99
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,005
Got tickets.

100
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:28,594
Yes, American tickets.

101
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,323
Big American scalper.

102
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:00,057
How many more tickets
did Gary sell than you?

103
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:03,152
And how many T-shirts and watches
did you have to pedal home?

104
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,663
A couple.

105
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:15,641
- Where's the food?
- It's coming.

106
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:21,113
Hey, the man!

107
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,084
How you doing, Professor?

108
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:30,781
You consider my proposition?

109
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:32,290
I did.

110
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,054
And?

111
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,321
Hello!

112
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:42,357
It's the thing about working alone.
That's the way I gotta do this.

113
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:48,436
I mean, it's no offense to...
It's the way I have to do this.

114
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:50,533
Why don't you relax?

115
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,704
I'll do that. Okay.

116
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,681
This is not a shakedown.
This is just a business idea.

117
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,583
- You make me nervous.
- We're all adults here.

118
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:04,389
Give this to Sylvia when she comes in.

119
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:12,593
- What was that about?
- Barry the Book.

120
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,634
Bookmaker to the degenerates.

121
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:18,000
Wants to buy a piece of me,
stake me financially for a percentage.

122
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:21,700
- You know what that means.
- Gary, you don't need anybody.

123
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:24,141
The museum today? You're a god.

124
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:30,412
- Good call, brother.
- Good call, that's it.

125
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:32,474
Anybody hear anything
about the pope today?

126
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:36,579
- What pope?
- Big guy. Tall. White hair. Long dress.

127
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:41,559
My sources tell me it's between
New York, Moscow or Russia.

128
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:46,258
Acts don't go to Siberia when they can
come to the media capital of the world.

129
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,267
The Big Apple.

130
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:53,561
I hear the stadium's holding open dates.
Rescheduling events.

131
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,403
End of the month.

132
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:56,908
You heard that?

133
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:59,240
You really think he'll come here?

134
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:02,508
I pray every night that he does.

135
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:05,016
An event like this is like...

136
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:07,952
- Comes around once in a lifetime.
- And lives get changed.

137
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:10,489
- What did you say?
- And lives get changed.

138
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:46,990
How you doing, Blink?
Move over.

139
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,120
We better call Lin.
Wanna call Lin?

140
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:09,276
Hi, it's Linda.
I'm not here to take your call.

141
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:12,477
Leave a message after the tone.
Bye.

142
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:16,454
Hi, Linda.
It's me, the asshole.

143
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:19,253
I know you're there.
Will you pick up, please?

144
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:21,850
Come on, baby.
I need to talk to you.

145
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:26,054
Okay, I'll just talk to you then.

146
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:29,568
How are things doin'?
Everything's well?

147
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:34,070
Come on, please.
I've gotta talk to you.

148
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,166
I wouldn't be calling if it
wasn't important. Please pick up.

149
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,446
Okay, I'm going to stop by
the store tomorrow.

150
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,381
All right, okay.

151
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:48,046
You know what? If you don't pick up
in five seconds...

152
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:50,521
I'll take that as a yes
and I'm coming tomorrow.

153
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,182
One, two, three, four, five.

154
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:11,371
This set is really great
for the kitchen.

155
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:15,710
It's small, discreet. It has a clock
on it if you want to time something.

156
00:11:15,782 --> 00:11:18,478
If you're looking for a larger set,
those have built-in videos...

157
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:20,951
which are extremely convenient.

158
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,419
He's not gonna buy.
You're wasting your time.

159
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:28,951
Beat it. Scram. Go away and don't
come back. Don't write, don't call.

160
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:32,122
Did you get my messages?
I need to talk to you. It's important.

161
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:34,257
- Let me buy you lunch.
- No.

162
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:38,869
Dinner then, please. This is important.
I have things to talk to you about.

163
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:40,872
I had things to say to you,
but I don't anymore.

164
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,170
Don't say that.

165
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,370
Things are different now. It's nice.

166
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:48,778
No more waiting up for you, no calls
in the middle of the night, no excuses.

167
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:52,409
Linda, look at me.

168
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:54,146
That's not me anymore.

169
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,882
I've got a plan big enough
to change everything for us.

170
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:59,823
- Please.
- Come on, please. Let me say my piece.

171
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:11,203
What if I can sell this guy a TV?
Not that 13" job, but that 60" TV there.

172
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,763
- Will you have dinner with me then?
- That man's too cheap to buy a toaster.

173
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:20,803
Are you kidding me?

174
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:23,381
Deal?

175
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:28,443
A piece of cake.

176
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:31,889
Ouch.

177
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,459
I wouldn't get too close
to this baby, Commander.

178
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,464
It might suck you right in.

179
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:41,295
Beautiful.

180
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:44,666
How are you? Dave Kelly,
sales representative for Sony.

181
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,699
Just lookin'.

182
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:51,141
Well, aren't we all.
It's okay. I'm not working today.

183
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,202
It's obvious to me anyway
that you're here without your wife...

184
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,510
and couldn't make a decision
without her.

185
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,744
This is an extraordinary
piece of equipment.

186
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:03,585
This equipment was designed
for only the most deserving of men.

187
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:06,056
The working man.

188
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,685
The man who is the backbone
of this country.

189
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:13,858
A man who deserves not 13",
but the full 60" experience.

190
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:16,595
Full visual stimulus,
a cacophony of sound...

191
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,866
that stimulates the ocular nerve.

192
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:22,203
Have you ever had
your ocular nerve stimulated?

193
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,876
Yeah, once.

194
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:29,381
An assault on the senses. It takes you
to a place where everything is good.

195
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:32,612
Where everything's swell.

196
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:36,086
But, again,
your wife is not here.

197
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:40,255
Oh, goodness. Can l...

198
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,264
What?

199
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:47,265
No, you'd better leave.

200
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,733
- Why?
- This is a private thing.

201
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:51,736
What are you talking about?

202
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:56,036
- You never entered the "Stargate"?
- No. Have I missed something?

203
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:58,077
Take a load off.

204
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,151
The first time I went through
the "Stargate"...

205
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,688
it was an extraordinary experience
I never forgot it.

206
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:11,724
And you'll never forget me.

207
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,224
Here we go.

208
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:17,253
Look at that baby.
Just push "play"...

209
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,820
and we're off.

210
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,600
Here we go.

211
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,330
He's a good actor.

212
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:28,568
Just relax. Let yourself go.
Go with the feel.

213
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:30,905
Go with the sound, with the feeling.

214
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:47,086
You're there. You own it.

215
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:52,325
You're on. See?

216
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:54,423
What a rush.

217
00:14:57,904 --> 00:15:01,237
- How much is it?
- How much is this?

218
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:04,936
Not any more than what you spend
on your wife for manicures, pedicures...

219
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:07,536
facials, hair dying...

220
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:10,047
and tennis lessons
with that 20-year-old pro.

221
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:12,209
What do you get out of that?

222
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,150
Zero.

223
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,384
For $99 a month,
in about 18 years you get that.

224
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,027
That TV right there.

225
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,858
Enjoy your TV.

226
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,562
Okay, you win.
Listen good and hard.

227
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,831
Pick me up at 8:00.
Not 8:01.

228
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:35,806
Pope John Paul will make his awaited
State of the World address...

229
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,809
here in New York City
at Yankee Stadium...

230
00:15:37,877 --> 00:15:40,038
two weeks from this Sunday.

231
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,081
The pope last visited the United States
over six years ago.

232
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:44,616
The visit comes as a bit of a surprise.

233
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:46,743
- Do you hear me?
- Thank you so much.

234
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:48,013
Yes!

235
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:51,818
Lordy, Lordy! My Lord, my Savior.
Hallelujah.

236
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:55,622
It's just dinner.
It's not gonna be that exciting.

237
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:59,563
I have some things to tell you,
so if you show up one nanosecond late...

238
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:02,032
Not more "ifs," no more "buts."

239
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:03,534
No more "maybes."

240
00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:06,572
Thank you.
You're so beautiful.

241
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,004
I'll see ya.

242
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:12,977
8:00, Linda Paliski's.

243
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:15,411
With my shiny shoes on.

244
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:24,420
Make sure you get diggers, and tell them
it's gonna be an overnighter.

245
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,152
After that, check all
the local churches...

246
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:29,660
Salvation Army...

247
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:32,459
the Red Cross, choirs,
anybody who's connected.

248
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:34,523
What do you think?
"He's back."

249
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,933
- Or "Yo, Pope, over here."
- "Yo, Pope, over here."

250
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:41,302
"He is here."

251
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:43,808
Stinko. Stick to tickets.
Zeus, what are you working on?

252
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:46,936
Popesicles.

253
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:52,144
Pontiff Purple, Roman Raspberry
and Christian Cherry.

254
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:55,619
- Tony, cut him off quick.
- No more shrimp for you.

255
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:58,816
- You're going to ruin my picture.
- He is here

256
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:01,325
The pope is here

257
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:03,988
Bong
We're in the money

258
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,438
Hey, Gary, what's the word?

259
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:16,407
The word is pope tickets. I'm paying
five over face value. No limit.

260
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:18,909
I'll take everything you can get
your tiny hands on.

261
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:24,846
- Make it 10 over face.
- Ten over face?

262
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,248
You heard me.

263
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,753
What do they teach you in here?

264
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:31,783
Okay, ten. Deal.

265
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,452
Stanley, take your diggers
to Yankee Stadium tomorrow...

266
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,893
and get me as many pope tickets
as you can.

267
00:17:36,963 --> 00:17:39,056
I'll pay ten over face, no limit.

268
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,000
I need these tickets badly.

269
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,803
Close the parking lot.
You owe me.

270
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:50,331
What are you saying, Arty?
I need pope tickets.

271
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:53,344
I got nothin' for ya.

272
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:57,007
Sold your allotment to some new guy.
Walked up where you're standing now.

273
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,813
Offered me double your grease.
I should say no to that?

274
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,753
You should say, "Wait a minute,"
and call me.

275
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:05,290
It's two years
we've had this arrangement.

276
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:08,725
If you're unhappy, all you gotta do
is say something. We'll work it out.

277
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:10,887
You couldn't beat the offer.

278
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:12,954
Besides, it was cash on the spot.

279
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:15,193
- Who was it?
- Some new guy.

280
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:17,702
Never saw him before.
Slick, though.

281
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:22,400
Cell phone. Beeper.
Had an island accent.

282
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:31,915
How you doing, Benny?

283
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:34,043
Who's this guy?

284
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,180
Check it out, Johnny.
The Cheshire Cat.

285
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:39,690
It's some island guy from Miami.
Showed up a couple days ago.

286
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,693
We talked for a minute.

287
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:45,586
We talked.

288
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:54,637
Let me call you back.

289
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:59,771
How you doing, man?

290
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:01,506
Gary, right?

291
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,105
Heard a lot about you.
Casino.

292
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:09,785
Go by the Broadhurst today?

293
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:13,552
Yeah, man. Picked up
some nice action over there, boy.

294
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,860
Casino here.
How many you need?

295
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,633
Broadhurst is my juice.
Has been.

296
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:26,399
- Arty's your connection?
- That's right.

297
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:28,702
- I didn't know he was greased already.
- Now you know.

298
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:30,969
This is a problem.
No, no. No problem.

299
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,567
Gary, let's go.

300
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:36,911
It's a quarter to. You got to get
yourself presentable for Linda tonight.

301
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:40,450
- You gotta be sharp for Linda.
- I got you.

302
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,714
Sorry. So you were saying?

303
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:45,018
I said, undo what you did.

304
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:48,618
Next time check things out,
otherwise we're gonna have a problem.

305
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:49,991
Otherwise?

306
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:53,424
Shit happens, bro.

307
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:57,299
This is the wild west. There are
no rules. This is a day-by-day thing.

308
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,702
You slick, smiling shyster.

309
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:02,502
You don't tell him what to do.
He tells you.

310
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:04,736
- Get him out of here. Pull the punch.
- I'll drop him so fast.

311
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,677
- Take him out of here.
- He won't know up from down.

312
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:09,180
Let's go, champ.

313
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:12,316
Oh, Jesus.

314
00:20:13,252 --> 00:20:14,685
Business is heating up.

315
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,745
Talk to me later.

316
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:19,450
We'll work something out.

317
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:24,162
- Count on it.
- Right.

318
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,494
He tries that again, I'll drill fingers
in his head, use it as a bowling ball.

319
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,298
Know what I mean?

320
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:35,238
Hey, Gary, swag sale.
Do you want a coat?

321
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:37,468
TV? Cigars? Batteries?

322
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:39,534
- Fat fuck!
- Fuck you!

323
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:43,179
I'd rather swallow Clorox
than deal with Fat Max.

324
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:44,876
Scum of the earth.

325
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,544
Draws no lines. Today it's coats,
tomorrow it's something else.

326
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,316
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

327
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,364
Are you clean?

328
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,235
Yeah, Gary.

329
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:05,236
I would never let you down.

330
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:09,673
I appreciate what you've done for me.
It's been two years.

331
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:14,737
You're a good kid.

332
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:17,078
Somebody's gonna have to take over
when I retire.

333
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:19,140
You will never retire.

334
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:21,152
As most of you are aware...

335
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,451
Miss Bennett is the restaurant critic
for the New York Times.

336
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:26,650
Her palate is exquisite.

337
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:30,627
And her review will count for one-third
of your total grade this quarter.

338
00:21:30,696 --> 00:21:34,996
You will be judged on taste,
texture and presentation.

339
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:39,897
Medallion de veau en croute?

340
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:42,634
Very ambitious, my dear.

341
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:46,611
It's a lovely presentation.

342
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,421
It's very well done.

343
00:22:11,937 --> 00:22:17,136
It's obvious you possess
a very rare talent, my dear.

344
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:21,974
I would like to see
more of your cooking.

345
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:48,939
Nice and cool.

346
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:53,211
You're the man.

347
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:01,085
Who's there?

348
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:04,288
Gary?

349
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:06,890
You're back.

350
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:10,627
How are you, Mrs. D.?
You're looking well.

351
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:13,859
And you need glasses. Wait.

352
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:18,395
Give this back to Julia Child.

353
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,634
Tell her I couldn't even tell
it was goat. Tasted just like chicken.

354
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,141
Will do.

355
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,948
You ever spend time
in your own apartment, Rhonda?

356
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:34,042
What for? It's more fun here
watching you suffer.

357
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,850
- Linda, Dean Martin is here.
- Very funny.

358
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:40,585
Here, lick the plate.

359
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,360
She's testing cookbooks again...

360
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:50,368
so I'm gaining like a sponge.

361
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:54,832
She's been fussing all day.

362
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:57,508
Really?

363
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:02,079
I think I'm gonna go.
I can't bear to watch this.

364
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:04,240
Good.

365
00:24:04,316 --> 00:24:07,410
I'm going downstairs
to try to get a taxi.

366
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,754
I'm sorry.
I tried to call you three times.

367
00:24:15,728 --> 00:24:17,161
Not Mrs. Haywood?

368
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:20,255
Mrs. Haywood, but no notice
and an impossible menu.

369
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:22,994
Oh, flowers. Oh, Blink.

370
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:25,736
Asparagus.

371
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:28,864
Haywood time! Blinkie, lay down.
Stay calm. We can do this.

372
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:31,432
I've got the water. Here we go.

373
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,001
- This is such a big break for me.
- I see that.

374
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,013
I'm really nervous.

375
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:40,608
I'm really sorry. I've been begging
the school for this opportunity.

376
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:43,280
It is Lydia Haywood!

377
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:45,289
You're gonna be great.

378
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:48,454
Oh, God!

379
00:24:50,162 --> 00:24:51,891
Here we go.

380
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:55,695
After all, it is the catering business,
and you never know who will be there.

381
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:58,566
Everybody's gonna be there.
You're gonna be great.

382
00:24:58,637 --> 00:25:00,070
Salmon mousse!

383
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:05,206
- Salmon mousse.
- Thanks.

384
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:07,905
Mrs. Haywood.
I love your salmon mousse.

385
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:11,472
- How is it? Good?
- I don't know.

386
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,983
That's good.

387
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:18,650
Ooh, I love the way you squeeze
that mousse right in the center.

388
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:23,228
Ooh, squeeze that mousse, baby.
Squeeze that mousse.

389
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:28,226
What?

390
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:30,667
What?

391
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:34,765
- What?
- What do you have there?

392
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,967
- What is that?
- What?

393
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:40,671
You've got something. What is that?
You okay? Burn yourself?

394
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:42,976
Can I get a little bit of that?

395
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:44,948
Shit! The torte tatin!

396
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,417
Mitts.

397
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:51,288
Thanks.

398
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:55,593
- I got it.
- Clear a place. Quick. Clear a place.

399
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:58,129
- Got it.
- Space.

400
00:25:58,197 --> 00:26:00,165
- This white one?
- My nice white tray.

401
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:07,835
Here we go.
One, two...

402
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:09,339
three.

403
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:15,435
- Good job.
- Like we never stopped doing this.

404
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:20,615
- Why are you doing that?
- 'Cause I like it.

405
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:22,119
Come on.

406
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:24,178
Help me take that off now.

407
00:26:26,392 --> 00:26:29,361
- Here we go. May I do the honors?
- Yes, please.

408
00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:32,295
That works.
There it goes.

409
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:48,043
You're so beautiful.

410
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:50,240
Give me the scissors.

411
00:26:54,753 --> 00:26:58,189
I tell you you're beautiful
and you tell me to get the scissors?

412
00:26:58,257 --> 00:27:01,226
Ouch! I gotta talk to you.

413
00:27:01,293 --> 00:27:04,228
- Gotta go.
- Gotta talk to you. Gotta talk.

414
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:07,094
Listen to me.
I gotta talk to you.

415
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,726
I gotta talk to you.
Something big's come up.

416
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:13,431
Don't look at me that way. Something
big enough to change everything for us.

417
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:16,201
Let me guess.
Another swell business idea...

418
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:19,836
to invest all the money in
that you don't have.

419
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:23,370
This is the real thing.
It's different. It's real.

420
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:26,850
Really? Is it like
the combination salad bar...

421
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:29,513
and Laundromat?

422
00:27:29,588 --> 00:27:32,148
Or the drive-through
teeth-cleaning place?

423
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,819
What was that called?
Gary's Plaque-O-Rama.

424
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:38,158
You even had a commercial.

425
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,892
Big date
Tartar problem

426
00:27:40,966 --> 00:27:44,333
That could've worked.

427
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:50,766
That's very funny. This is
a solid thing, real, respectable.

428
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:53,004
It's bullshit, Gary.

429
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,691
- You were concerned, right?
- I was very concerned.

430
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,251
Pay attention to me.
I'm talking about a real thing here.

431
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:14,127
Come on, come on.

432
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:17,066
I've been presented with
this opportunity. It's a one-shot deal.

433
00:28:17,135 --> 00:28:19,069
It's a sure thing.

434
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:21,196
I want to talk to you about it.
It concerns you.

435
00:28:21,273 --> 00:28:23,298
I'm not doing it anymore.
No. Good night.

436
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,809
We'll chat on the way.

437
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,436
Go, go, go!

438
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:30,482
That is one messed-up couple.

439
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,880
The way I figure it,
this'll make us enough money...

440
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:37,911
that if everything goes right, I could
stake you with anything you want.

441
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,926
Anything your heart desires,
I can provide for you.

442
00:28:41,994 --> 00:28:43,427
That's great.

443
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,130
- Wish me luck.
- You don't need luck.

444
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,534
One last thing.
I'm already gone.

445
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,443
I wanted to let you know that scalping
tickets is history after the 25th.

446
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:03,447
Not like the other times.

447
00:29:04,883 --> 00:29:06,316
Linda, dear.

448
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:10,310
Who's this person?

449
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:12,823
I'm not paying extra for help.

450
00:29:12,891 --> 00:29:15,359
- It's included.
- He's leaving.

451
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:17,361
That's different.

452
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:19,989
But that jacket.

453
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:23,557
- You like it?
- No.

454
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:26,436
Wait here.

455
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,942
They loved the whatever-they-were.
Cleaned the plate.

456
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,342
I'm sure the waiter's charm
had something to do with it.

457
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:36,779
What a team.

458
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:53,224
Linda, the salmon toast.

459
00:29:53,298 --> 00:29:56,597
I'm disappointed in their size.
They're awfully small.

460
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:59,501
They're the standard size,
Mrs. Haywood.

461
00:29:59,571 --> 00:30:02,131
No, they were definitely small.

462
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:05,734
We'll reflect that on the bill.

463
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:11,548
Stop it.

464
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:14,711
Okay, which one is hers?

465
00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:16,947
It's not worth it.

466
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:20,583
You kidding me?
I wouldn't put up with her shit.

467
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,593
You walk out, her shindig is history.

468
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:26,961
Yeah, and I lose money and new clients
I could pick up on a job like this.

469
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:29,466
I still say stick it to her.
It's not worth it.

470
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:33,436
Yes, it is. I really need this.
I've got plans.

471
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:35,837
I'm not gonna blow it over one job.

472
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:40,935
Well, sometimes, my dear,
you just have to say "fuck it."

473
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:43,447
Miss Haywood!

474
00:30:46,318 --> 00:30:47,751
Right.

475
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:54,425
I'm sick of this.

476
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,766
Goodness, how lovely looking.

477
00:31:03,835 --> 00:31:06,463
We can only hope it tastes
as good as it looks.

478
00:31:08,006 --> 00:31:09,564
Here's your check.

479
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:14,645
You'll find I've deducted for
the smallness of the hors d'oeuvres.

480
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:18,171
The young man put altogether
too much champagne in the glasses.

481
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,718
You'll find that reflected
on the calculations.

482
00:31:20,786 --> 00:31:25,655
And Mrs. Hamlish is on a diet,
so she shouldn't count as a full person.

483
00:31:25,724 --> 00:31:30,627
A hundred dollars
doesn't even cover my expenses.

484
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:36,032
Young lady, I've been dealing with
the Culinary Institute for many years.

485
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:39,935
I give their best students
a grand opportunity.

486
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:42,496
You should be paying me
for this evening.

487
00:31:42,574 --> 00:31:44,508
- Boy!
- Yes.

488
00:31:44,576 --> 00:31:47,010
- The soup!
- Coming!

489
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:49,646
Good.

490
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:09,166
They're applauding the chef.

491
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:14,137
Haywood's taking all the credit.
So much for your new clients.

492
00:32:17,676 --> 00:32:20,736
I'm really sorry.
I thought you did a fantastic job.

493
00:32:24,282 --> 00:32:26,944
You did a fantastic job.
I'm proud of you.

494
00:32:27,018 --> 00:32:30,010
I agree, sometimes you do have to be
a pro in these situations.

495
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:32,488
Sometimes you do have to make a plan
and stick to it.

496
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:35,993
Sometimes you do have to suck it up
and eat shit.

497
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:41,657
Sometimes... Sometimes...

498
00:32:44,836 --> 00:32:49,864
Sometimes you just gotta say
fuck it!

499
00:32:55,313 --> 00:32:57,076
Haywood time!

500
00:33:22,474 --> 00:33:23,941
I've got an idea.

501
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:30,142
Did anybody hear the buzzer?

502
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:49,265
Oh, how beautiful.

503
00:33:59,644 --> 00:34:02,010
I had so much fun today.

504
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,810
I've never done anything like that
in my whole life.

505
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:06,373
Stop it.

506
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:11,488
I'd love to see their faces
when they take a bite into that rawhide.

507
00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:14,557
Stop.

508
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:16,594
Kitty litter can kill, you know.

509
00:34:20,665 --> 00:34:23,930
I've been thinking about the things
that are happening to us now.

510
00:34:27,038 --> 00:34:30,371
Did you know the pope
is coming into town?

511
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:33,104
An event like this
could stake our future.

512
00:34:35,213 --> 00:34:37,204
I was thinking to myself...

513
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:39,546
"What am I gonna do
with all this money?

514
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:42,416
What are we gonna do
with all this money?"

515
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:45,285
Because it has to be right.

516
00:34:45,357 --> 00:34:49,191
Then tonight it hits me
when I was watching you work.

517
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:51,889
You had them eating right out
of the palm of your hand.

518
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:54,397
Just the way you were moving.

519
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:57,401
You're... It's like poetry.

520
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:59,664
You're like a vision.

521
00:35:08,346 --> 00:35:10,041
What?

522
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,983
Come closer.

523
00:36:39,037 --> 00:36:41,505
- Hello.
- It's Benny.

524
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:45,532
- Call me back. I'm sleeping.
- Wake up! It's important.

525
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:50,411
Vinnie told me Red Dog is selling
pope tickets at the Yanni concert.

526
00:36:50,482 --> 00:36:51,915
Vinnie said what?

527
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:56,010
Pope tickets tonight. P-O-P-E.

528
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:59,545
- How many are they releasing?
- I don't know. A lot.

529
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:01,558
I'll be right there.

530
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:05,223
Benny, what's happening?

531
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:07,730
Watch your step.
Talk to me.

532
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:12,930
You sure you don't want me to go?
Could be trouble. I can help.

533
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:14,437
How's Stanley?

534
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:17,532
He said his mother brought
her bridge club with her...

535
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:19,634
so we got 22 people digging tickets.

536
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:22,771
Stay on top of Stanley. Take Blinker
to the vet, see how she's doing.

537
00:37:22,847 --> 00:37:25,042
And I got Linda at 8:00 tonight.

538
00:37:25,116 --> 00:37:27,311
Gary, you got your ball?

539
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:31,380
- You never know.
- Thank you, Ben.

540
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:36,918
Gary, is that you? I need to talk
to you. Last night was...

541
00:37:36,995 --> 00:37:40,158
A mistake?
You're damn right it was.

542
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:43,860
But don't ask me.
I'm just the nosy neighbor.

543
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:45,368
Did you see him?

544
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:49,032
No, but he left his love slave
a missive.

545
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:51,041
"Off to work.
See you tonight around 8:00."

546
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:53,475
He can't come at 8:00.
Alex is coming at 8:00.

547
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:57,948
Like he's really gonna show up.
To Gary, "around 8:00" means next week.

548
00:37:58,016 --> 00:37:59,540
Damn!

549
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:02,108
I wanted to tell him about Alex...

550
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:04,485
but he kept looking at me
with those eyes.

551
00:38:04,556 --> 00:38:06,217
Those puppy-dog eyes.

552
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:09,658
I just melt.
I have no courage.

553
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:12,890
Lin, it came.

554
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:15,330
Registered.
The doorman signed for it.

555
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,800
It's from Paris.

556
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:34,117
I got in.

557
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:35,618
Congratulations!

558
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:42,286
When do you leave?

559
00:38:43,394 --> 00:38:46,693
Let freedom ring, Rocky. Come on.

560
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:49,699
Nice work, Head.

561
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:52,001
Good call.

562
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,903
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

563
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:57,464
How many undercover cops
wear kilts?

564
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:02,469
Oh, nice.

565
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:05,248
Very nice.

566
00:39:07,018 --> 00:39:11,045
What are they gonna do to us?
I can't go to jail.

567
00:39:11,122 --> 00:39:14,114
- I don't wanna be somebody's bitch.
- Will you shut up?

568
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:16,922
All they do is take your tickets
and hold you until the concert starts.

569
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:21,159
Then they let you go.
You walk kind of cute, though.

570
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:24,429
Come over here. Just sit on my lap.
I'll take care of you.

571
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:26,800
You ever see a monkey's rear end?

572
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:29,066
Give the guy a break.
Leave him alone.

573
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,573
He's mine.

574
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:37,072
What am I doing here?
I promised Linda I'd be back.

575
00:39:37,148 --> 00:39:38,581
Oh, Rhonda.

576
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,521
What am I gonna do?

577
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:46,751
Write a note to the guy,
tape it to the door.

578
00:39:46,824 --> 00:39:48,758
When he shows, he shows.

579
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:50,623
Why do I do this?

580
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:54,392
'Cause he's like a drug to you,
and you can't give him up.

581
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:56,797
I saw that on Ricki Lake.

582
00:39:56,868 --> 00:39:58,802
This wouldn't happen
if you had a better holder.

583
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,338
What Vinnie's trying to say is
Benny's too old.

584
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:05,274
I love him, too, but he's too slow,
too fucking gone to hold.

585
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:08,642
You gotta have somebody who can fly.
A guy like Dice McGrath...

586
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:11,147
Skates Page, guys like that.

587
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:12,843
They can see the oscars coming.

588
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:15,852
How come they got your stuff,
they don't got mine?

589
00:40:17,855 --> 00:40:19,789
You know why?

590
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:23,193
Oh, good one, Gary.

591
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:29,624
Benny taught me that. He ain't stupid.
He gives an honest count.

592
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:31,862
Told me he used to be
Joe Frazier's corner man.

593
00:40:31,936 --> 00:40:35,201
He told me he was one of the original
Mercury astronauts.

594
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:38,538
I was there. I saw it.

595
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,943
Frazier was fighting Young
at the Garden. I was 13 years old.

596
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:44,174
I was working the players' entrance.

597
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:47,741
I had six boosted ringsides in my sock.

598
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:50,185
Three Wall Street guys come to me.

599
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:53,918
I get 'em up to $150,
out come the shields.

600
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:57,428
I get popped.
They threw me up against the wall.

601
00:40:57,495 --> 00:40:59,929
They started slapping me around.
Then, out of nowhere...

602
00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:02,592
comes this guy with his I.D. badge.

603
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:06,194
He says, "The kid's clean.
The kid is with us."

604
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:08,330
I'm going, "Who is this guy?"

605
00:41:08,406 --> 00:41:10,897
The guys let me go.
He takes me inside...

606
00:41:10,975 --> 00:41:14,411
hands me a ringside pass,
and doesn't say another word.

607
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:16,538
I've never seen him before in my life.

608
00:41:16,614 --> 00:41:18,582
And this is Benny.

609
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,675
Benjamin Moran.

610
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:25,348
I take my ringside pass, and I'm sitting
right under Joe Frazier's corner.

611
00:41:25,423 --> 00:41:27,653
Out comes Frazier.

612
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:31,525
Hungry! Smoking!
Next to him is?

613
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:33,120
Benny.

614
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:38,134
He's wearing one of those smocks
with "Smoking Joe Frazier" in sparkles.

615
00:41:38,202 --> 00:41:40,693
So he's the water boy?

616
00:41:40,772 --> 00:41:42,831
He's the corner man, asshole!

617
00:41:42,907 --> 00:41:46,365
Every time he comes back to the corner,
he's there sponging him off, saying...

618
00:41:46,444 --> 00:41:51,143
"Stay on top of him. Joe, look at me.
Don't let him breathe."

619
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:53,376
He's doing this round after round.

620
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:58,479
In the last round, Joe Frazier goes back
to the corner, his heart is pumping.

621
00:41:58,556 --> 00:42:02,652
Benny's screaming at the top of
his lungs, "Joe, look at me! Hook him!

622
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:04,888
Hook him! Hook him!"

623
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:07,954
He goes out, throws a left hook.
Boom! Fight's over.

624
00:42:08,032 --> 00:42:10,728
Great fight.
Benjamin Moran.

625
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,864
That's a great story.
Too bad it's all bullshit...

626
00:42:14,939 --> 00:42:18,067
because Benny never knew
Joe Frazier.

627
00:42:19,677 --> 00:42:22,976
Want me to tell the story again?
What the fuck's going on here?

628
00:42:23,047 --> 00:42:25,675
So why'd you dump him then?

629
00:42:30,655 --> 00:42:32,850
Because he won't grow up.

630
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:37,817
But Bug Man, I like this guy.

631
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:40,420
He's strong, steady...

632
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:43,092
and we get free pest control.

633
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:48,030
Aren't you gonna get it?

634
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:05,721
I'm coming.

635
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:09,926
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

636
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:15,221
What? I missed my train. Tell me
you didn't expect me until tomorrow.

637
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,830
Here, I got you this.
It's that slicer on TV.

638
00:43:18,903 --> 00:43:21,804
Thanks. You gotta leave.

639
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:23,306
Right. Okay.

640
00:43:23,374 --> 00:43:25,308
I'll take Blinker for a long walk.

641
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:27,435
She's out for a walk.

642
00:43:32,817 --> 00:43:36,685
- Who's walking her?
- It doesn't matter.

643
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:40,246
- It matters. Who's walking her?
- It doesn't matter. She's being walked.

644
00:43:43,561 --> 00:43:46,189
Gary, just leave it.

645
00:43:51,235 --> 00:43:55,262
- Hey, you! That's my dog!
- What?

646
00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:58,365
- Get your hands off my dog!
- This isn't your dog.

647
00:43:58,443 --> 00:44:01,276
- What are you doing with my dog?
- Taking it for a walk.

648
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:04,439
That's what they all say.
It's not an "it," it's a "she."

649
00:44:04,515 --> 00:44:08,349
- I was taking her for a walk.
- You're trying to steal my dog.

650
00:44:08,419 --> 00:44:09,943
Wait, wait.

651
00:44:10,021 --> 00:44:14,048
Let me say one thing to you.
This isn't your dog.

652
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:17,957
Get your hands off my dog.

653
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:20,054
Drop the dog.

654
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,461
What?

655
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,660
I asked him to walk Blinker.

656
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:34,868
Okay. You all right?

657
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:36,880
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

658
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:46,318
This is Alex. He's my friend.
My boyfriend.

659
00:44:50,394 --> 00:44:51,986
Look.

660
00:44:52,063 --> 00:44:54,827
I told you. I've moved on.

661
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:57,891
I was going to tell you everything,
but you never gave me a chance.

662
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,178
Hi. It's Gary.

663
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,878
Linda told me all about you.

664
00:45:14,952 --> 00:45:19,252
She would've told me about you,
but I guess...

665
00:45:19,323 --> 00:45:21,257
I didn't let her.

666
00:45:21,325 --> 00:45:22,849
I screwed up.

667
00:45:27,098 --> 00:45:29,032
I should go.
Take it easy.

668
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:31,467
See you.

669
00:45:31,536 --> 00:45:33,629
Nice meeting you.

670
00:45:45,283 --> 00:45:47,308
You ain't kidding.

671
00:45:47,385 --> 00:45:50,684
Whack the boyfriend.
He's causing you pain.

672
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:52,882
I know a guy who'll do it as a joke.

673
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:55,824
Make him swallow his own bug spray.

674
00:45:55,893 --> 00:45:58,293
I'm serious.
I got the guy.

675
00:45:58,362 --> 00:46:00,296
Give me the word, I'll call him.

676
00:46:00,364 --> 00:46:03,561
Sympathy is the key.

677
00:46:03,634 --> 00:46:06,034
You gotta make her
feel sorry for you.

678
00:46:06,103 --> 00:46:10,096
Get an operation.
Have something taken out of you.

679
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:13,176
Donate one of your livers.

680
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:17,442
You could pretend Linda's
still your girlfriend, only she's...

681
00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:20,678
away on a cruise or in a coma,
or something like that.

682
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:23,447
Wear a sock in your pants.

683
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:25,921
I'm serious. It works.
I've got a whole collection.

684
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:30,086
Different sizes, lengths, thicknesses.
I'll lend you a couple. Try it.

685
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:32,493
Get that for me, will you?

686
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,997
You don't separate?

687
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:40,367
Buy her a pair of shoes.

688
00:46:40,438 --> 00:46:42,463
Women love shoes.

689
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:45,606
That and oral hygiene.

690
00:46:45,676 --> 00:46:49,009
Buy her a bike.
Women love bikes.

691
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,674
That or a big diamond.

692
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:56,045
She must know you have a passion.

693
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,553
Tell her.

694
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,322
Tell her what you feel.

695
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,330
Remember how she wanted me
to get a social security number?

696
00:47:12,403 --> 00:47:13,893
I should've.

697
00:47:13,971 --> 00:47:16,997
Yeah, you should've. But can he think up
a scam to fly for free?

698
00:47:17,074 --> 00:47:20,271
She doesn't care about that.
See that?

699
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,979
See how the IRS has auctions
for boats and houses and stuff?

700
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,382
The other day I was thinking...

701
00:47:28,452 --> 00:47:31,046
I was watching her...

702
00:47:31,122 --> 00:47:35,923
She was catering this extraordinary meal
for all these Guccis, and it hit me.

703
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:37,961
I said, "Now I know.
I have the answer."

704
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:41,362
The beauty of it all is that
we could do this together.

705
00:47:41,432 --> 00:47:44,458
It could be me and her
doing this together.

706
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,861
That'd be great...

707
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,400
being together all the time
with someone you really loved.

708
00:47:57,982 --> 00:48:00,314
You want to know
what she really wants?

709
00:48:00,384 --> 00:48:02,318
How would you know?

710
00:48:02,386 --> 00:48:05,412
I'm a girl, too,
in case you didn't notice.

711
00:48:07,191 --> 00:48:09,318
Stop talking.

712
00:48:09,393 --> 00:48:12,260
All you ever do is yak,
but what have you ever done?

713
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:15,196
I mean something concrete.
You love her, then show her.

714
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:19,336
- What do you think I'm doing?
- You're bullshitting.

715
00:48:22,606 --> 00:48:24,904
Do the little things.

716
00:48:24,975 --> 00:48:28,775
She wants a social security number,
then go get one. Sign some forms.

717
00:48:28,846 --> 00:48:32,748
It may not seem like much,
but it's symbolic.

718
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:34,944
Noble deeds.

719
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,414
You go do that now,
and follow through...

720
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,958
and maybe you've got
one last chance.

721
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:45,494
Do it now?

722
00:48:47,832 --> 00:48:49,823
Social security number?

723
00:49:09,987 --> 00:49:13,286
Let me see what you've done
with this form, sir.

724
00:49:13,357 --> 00:49:15,825
No. You have to fill
this out completely.

725
00:49:15,893 --> 00:49:17,827
May I see your birth certificate?

726
00:49:17,895 --> 00:49:21,262
No. I couldn't find that thing.

727
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:23,823
We need some record
that you exist...

728
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:27,735
so I'm going to need an insurance card,
union card.

729
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:29,238
I don't have that.

730
00:49:29,306 --> 00:49:31,433
- Voter's registration card.
- What for?

731
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:34,273
- Bank statement.
- No.

732
00:49:34,345 --> 00:49:37,678
- Driver's license?
- No.

733
00:49:37,748 --> 00:49:39,682
I've got a locker key from the Y.

734
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,344
That's not gonna help me.

735
00:49:42,419 --> 00:49:45,616
What I need is record you exist.

736
00:49:45,689 --> 00:49:48,351
It's from the Y.
Everybody knows me there.

737
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:51,690
Step out of the line. When you have
record you exist, then come back.

738
00:49:51,762 --> 00:49:54,856
- I'm existing right now.
- I see you, but I need record.

739
00:49:54,932 --> 00:49:58,333
- I'll find something.
- Thank you. Step out of the line.

740
00:50:00,704 --> 00:50:03,434
Nobody told me you need a
birth certificate to get those numbers.

741
00:50:03,507 --> 00:50:05,441
I could've saved myself an afternoon.

742
00:50:05,509 --> 00:50:08,478
- Just call the hospital.
- What hospital?

743
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:11,913
- Where you were born?
- I don't know if I was born in one.

744
00:50:11,982 --> 00:50:14,280
They told me I didn't even exist.

745
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:18,253
- Try the Bureau of Vital Statistics.
- I've got something else cooking.

746
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,483
How we doing with Stanley?
How many tickets did we get?

747
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:26,121
Actually, we got none.

748
00:50:26,197 --> 00:50:28,222
None? What are you talking about?

749
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:32,360
Stanley said he's got nothing for us,
nobody did.

750
00:50:32,436 --> 00:50:34,666
Don't go crazy, don't get nuts.

751
00:50:34,738 --> 00:50:38,504
You gotta be calm, you gotta be cool.

752
00:50:38,576 --> 00:50:40,669
And you gotta be still inside.

753
00:50:40,744 --> 00:50:42,905
Come here, you piece of shit!

754
00:50:46,317 --> 00:50:50,151
- Where are my pope tickets!
- I didn't take any money!

755
00:50:50,221 --> 00:50:52,689
I want my tickets.
Where are my tickets?

756
00:50:52,756 --> 00:50:54,587
I sold them.

757
00:50:54,658 --> 00:50:56,626
You sold them?

758
00:50:58,395 --> 00:51:00,329
You piece of shit.
Where are my tickets?

759
00:51:00,397 --> 00:51:01,830
Calm down.

760
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,264
I'll ask you one more time.
Where are my tickets?

761
00:51:05,336 --> 00:51:07,668
The dude was offering cash on the spot.

762
00:51:07,738 --> 00:51:09,797
I told my crew not to take it.
I know I owe you...

763
00:51:09,874 --> 00:51:14,106
but everybody's flocking this guy
because he's peeling off 20s.

764
00:51:14,178 --> 00:51:18,046
- What guy?
- Some island guy.

765
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:27,284
Excuse me.

766
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:29,292
Where's that island guy?

767
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,851
I saw him by the backstage area.
What's up?

768
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:34,489
Finally sold the tickets.

769
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,161
- Where's backstage?
- Over there.

770
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:51,774
Seen that island fuck?

771
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:53,976
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna drop the fucker.

772
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:57,077
Stay here. Leave it alone.

773
00:51:57,154 --> 00:52:00,317
What do you mean?
That fuck stole my life!

774
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:02,882
Those tickets are my life!

775
00:52:04,628 --> 00:52:07,096
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Do it for me.

776
00:52:07,164 --> 00:52:10,031
Leave it alone for me.
How about that?

777
00:52:11,936 --> 00:52:16,202
What do you mean, "for you"?
What is that supposed to mean?

778
00:52:16,273 --> 00:52:19,572
- I think he's getting to you.
- Why? Talk to me straight.

779
00:52:19,643 --> 00:52:22,305
What do you mean, "for you"?

780
00:52:22,379 --> 00:52:25,177
A lot of people are working for him,
and I'm working for him too...

781
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:27,183
'cause I make more money.

782
00:52:27,251 --> 00:52:32,086
I'm supposed to keep you off his back
because we know each other.

783
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,558
Come here! Come here!

784
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:43,528
No! This is the men's room!

785
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,037
Look at yourself in the mirror!
Take your glasses off and look.

786
00:52:48,105 --> 00:52:50,039
You like that image?

787
00:52:51,775 --> 00:52:55,142
You happy with yourself?
Is this what you want for your kid?

788
00:52:55,212 --> 00:52:58,045
What are you doing?
What is that?

789
00:52:58,115 --> 00:53:00,515
Just stop yelling.

790
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:05,083
I know I fucked up, Gary.

791
00:53:05,155 --> 00:53:09,216
I'm gonna get clean, but right now,
it's just something I've gotta do.

792
00:53:10,794 --> 00:53:15,288
I'm looking at myself,
and I fucked up.

793
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:17,425
I fucked up.

794
00:53:22,406 --> 00:53:23,839
I'm sorry.

795
00:53:35,152 --> 00:53:38,087
He's gonna ask me
if you're gonna be a problem.

796
00:53:38,155 --> 00:53:40,089
I gotta tell him something.

797
00:53:40,157 --> 00:53:43,991
Tell him that I am gonna be a problem.

798
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:47,827
He's not alone.
He don't play by our rules.

799
00:53:47,898 --> 00:53:50,833
He'll do whatever it takes,
and he's not alone.

800
00:53:50,901 --> 00:53:54,132
He has so many people.

801
00:53:56,373 --> 00:53:59,934
You got a baby inside you,
and I don't know what you're doing.

802
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:09,978
If I see you like this one more time,
I'm not gonna be your friend anymore.

803
00:54:14,758 --> 00:54:18,091
I know where you can get
200 plus seats for the pope.

804
00:54:18,162 --> 00:54:21,325
I was gonna tell Casino.
I won't tell him.

805
00:54:21,398 --> 00:54:24,834
You back off.
Fat Max has got them.

806
00:54:24,902 --> 00:54:26,836
230 of them.

807
00:54:27,805 --> 00:54:31,605
Then you got the tickets,
and for me you back off.

808
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:52,057
You're blocking my UV rays.

809
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:57,262
Max, word is you're selling something
I might be interested in.

810
00:54:58,302 --> 00:55:01,237
Max? Did I hear you say Max?

811
00:55:01,305 --> 00:55:03,068
Not Fat Max...

812
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,007
or Fat Fuck or Fuck Face anymore?

813
00:55:06,076 --> 00:55:08,670
Funny. Suddenly everybody wants
to be my friend.

814
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:11,714
- How much?
- Five large.

815
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,785
I'll give a grand now
and the rest after the show.

816
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:22,757
You want me to wail till after the show.
Fine, I can wait.

817
00:55:22,826 --> 00:55:24,760
But I'm not the one that counts.

818
00:55:24,828 --> 00:55:27,695
Talk to the guy inside
in the nice suit, ltalian loafers.

819
00:55:27,764 --> 00:55:31,461
You can't miss him.
You ask him if he can wait.

820
00:55:31,535 --> 00:55:35,665
He told me I settle up by Saturday
or I don't walk so good Sunday.

821
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:37,604
I need those tickets.

822
00:55:37,674 --> 00:55:40,165
This ain't a deli where you pick
a number and stand in line.

823
00:55:40,244 --> 00:55:43,042
This is the fucking street.
First come, first served.

824
00:55:43,113 --> 00:55:47,049
Bring me five grand by Saturday, you
can have a fucking religious experience.

825
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:49,051
- Where'd you get them?
- From some orphans.

826
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,611
What the fuck do you care?
I got them, okay?

827
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:55,357
I got 'em.

828
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:02,898
By Saturday.

829
00:56:04,134 --> 00:56:07,467
Make a list of the events going on.
I don't care what they are.

830
00:56:07,538 --> 00:56:11,304
Pony shows, midget tossings, whatever.
If there's a ticket, I'll work it.

831
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:13,475
You got it.

832
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:17,241
I've got tickets close enough
to kiss the Torah as it goes by.

833
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:20,650
Don't atone. See if I care.

834
00:56:21,885 --> 00:56:23,648
I've got orchestra seats.

835
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,689
Thirty bucks apiece. It's sold out.

836
00:56:26,757 --> 00:56:29,954
Cats! It's good,
and they got more cats now.

837
00:56:30,027 --> 00:56:32,860
Backstage pass, front row seats.
Bon Jovi!

838
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:38,100
Knock yourself out.

839
00:56:38,168 --> 00:56:41,797
- We got you. You're under arrest.
- Come on. Goddamn it!

840
00:56:44,775 --> 00:56:47,005
I said two bills.
I didn't say what kind of bill.

841
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:48,408
Benny!

842
00:56:48,478 --> 00:56:53,211
He's over the other side.
He's okay. He's okay.

843
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:55,342
Gimme my money back.

844
00:56:57,821 --> 00:56:59,254
He's okay.

845
00:57:00,657 --> 00:57:04,684
First time's free, no charge.
Welcome to Casino's corner.

846
00:57:05,696 --> 00:57:07,288
I did that for you.

847
00:57:07,364 --> 00:57:10,629
Casino and Company is expanding.

848
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:12,965
Got kind of a union thing
happening here.

849
00:57:13,036 --> 00:57:14,526
Dues are not high...

850
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:17,870
considering the benefits
and protection you receive.

851
00:57:20,077 --> 00:57:23,274
Membership week ends tonight.

852
00:57:23,347 --> 00:57:26,544
After that, it's gonna get
very lonely out here.

853
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:28,551
I'm looking forward to it.

854
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,918
Stay out of my face or I'll crack
that coconut head of yours.

855
00:57:34,157 --> 00:57:36,853
Whatever you say, Gary.

856
00:57:39,129 --> 00:57:40,721
Funny guy.

857
00:57:43,311 --> 00:57:45,575
I'm dying here.

858
00:57:50,251 --> 00:57:54,244
Stadium spokesman made it official.
The Papal Mass is sold out.

859
00:57:54,322 --> 00:57:57,587
1.6 million people vied
for the 65,000 seats.

860
00:57:57,658 --> 00:58:00,525
Ticket windows closed at 1:45.
You got shut out?

861
00:58:00,595 --> 00:58:03,564
Shame on you. You didn't say
enough Hail Marys or Our Fathers.

862
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:29,182
Linda Paliski?
What are you doing here?

863
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,316
I'm sorry for how you found out
about Alex.

864
00:58:32,393 --> 00:58:37,558
No hard feelings. Don't worry about it.
Me and Blinker have moved on.

865
00:58:37,632 --> 00:58:40,658
Then why are you sitting
in front of my apartment?

866
00:58:40,735 --> 00:58:43,169
I'm not sitting. I'm waiting.
Waiting for Benny.

867
00:58:43,237 --> 00:58:45,899
He's old.
I want to save him the walk.

868
00:58:45,973 --> 00:58:48,635
Yeah, that's Mommy!
You smell Mommy?

869
00:58:48,709 --> 00:58:52,577
Yes, I know.
I feel the same way. I know.

870
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:55,775
You're gonna have to talk to her
about that. I can't help you.

871
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:58,148
She'll be back.

872
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:01,751
Well?

873
00:59:01,822 --> 00:59:04,154
- Would you like to sit?
- Yeah, why not?

874
00:59:04,225 --> 00:59:06,489
- Is that for me? Thank you.
- Yes.

875
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,494
I think I'll save it.

876
00:59:08,562 --> 00:59:12,760
Me and Blinkie will have a shindig later
because we're all by ourselves.

877
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:16,196
We don't have much stuff
at the apartment.

878
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:19,103
Say hi to Mom.

879
00:59:19,173 --> 00:59:21,198
She almost forgot who you were.

880
00:59:21,275 --> 00:59:22,435
Good girl.

881
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:27,607
She misses you. Can't live without you.
Thinks about you all the time.

882
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:33,211
Listen, I want you to know
how special you are.

883
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:34,720
Go no further.

884
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:37,724
I like it there.
This is good.

885
00:59:37,792 --> 00:59:40,226
There is fine, okay?

886
00:59:43,197 --> 00:59:47,293
I'm leaving. I got into Cordon Bleu.
I go to Paris in three weeks.

887
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,577
You don't have to leave the country just
'cause you don't wanna be my girlfriend.

888
00:59:59,647 --> 01:00:01,444
It's a little drastic.

889
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:04,575
I really wanted you to be there
when I got the letter...

890
01:00:04,652 --> 01:00:09,214
'cause you always seemed to want it
as much as me.

891
01:00:10,391 --> 01:00:13,155
But then...

892
01:00:13,227 --> 01:00:16,128
you always had
more faith in me than I did.

893
01:00:22,236 --> 01:00:26,297
You're special.
You don't need to go to Paris.

894
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:33,472
What are you gonna do?

895
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,516
I really worry about you.

896
01:00:36,584 --> 01:00:40,782
You're not like other people.
You don't have things.

897
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:43,722
You're adrift, a nonentity.

898
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:47,192
- I'm not a nonentity.
- You don't exist.

899
01:00:47,261 --> 01:00:50,094
-I do exist.
-You can't keep doing what you're doing.

900
01:00:50,164 --> 01:00:53,099
One day you're gonna wake up
and you're gonna be somebody's Benny.

901
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:56,432
I don't wanna be there to see it.

902
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:15,188
I see Blinker doesn't wear
her cone anymore.

903
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:18,248
I wonder what all that scratching
was about.

904
01:01:18,325 --> 01:01:20,850
- Allergies.
- What was she allergic to?

905
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:22,953
Pesticides.

906
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,954
- Book in?
- In his office.

907
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:26,857
Five more days till Pope John Paul's
Papal Mass at Yankee Stadium.

908
01:02:26,927 --> 01:02:29,987
If you don't have a ticket, too bad.
The seats are bought.

909
01:02:30,064 --> 01:02:32,362
An event like this
comes once in a lifetime.

910
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:42,707
You're not listening to me.

911
01:02:47,915 --> 01:02:51,578
Do you know the word "no"?
It's a complete sentence.

912
01:02:56,891 --> 01:02:59,655
You believe that greaseball Franco?

913
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:01,786
Cost me 20 large last night.

914
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:04,023
Tonight...

915
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:07,431
he's gonna be my hero.

916
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:11,494
- What can I do for you?
- I need capital to make a move.

917
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:17,575
What does this look like here?
I'm a bookmaker, not a shylock.

918
01:03:17,645 --> 01:03:20,170
What about that proposition you offered?
You fund my moves for a percentage.

919
01:03:20,247 --> 01:03:22,477
I have this sure thing with the pope.

920
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,141
The pope?

921
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,687
Is there nothing you don't work?

922
01:03:27,755 --> 01:03:31,122
I need $1,800. Twenty percent
of my first dollar you can have.

923
01:03:31,191 --> 01:03:35,457
Sit down. Let me tell you
something I have learned.

924
01:03:35,529 --> 01:03:38,157
Let me share something with you.

925
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:41,690
Life, my friend, is timing.

926
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:46,399
Some people know that, some don't.
Me, I live by it.

927
01:03:46,473 --> 01:03:50,341
I feel something's right, I do it.

928
01:03:50,411 --> 01:03:54,973
I like you, Gary.
I've never seen nobody better than you.

929
01:03:55,049 --> 01:03:59,577
I swear to God, I'll never forget them
tickets you got me for Jimmy Roselli.

930
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:04,716
Right down front, first row.
Beautiful night.

931
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:08,626
But lately I'm hearing disturbing
things like you're not the man anymore.

932
01:04:08,696 --> 01:04:12,132
That's bullshit. Listen to me.
I'm on top of this thing.

933
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:15,293
This is what I'm hearing.

934
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:18,304
That some new kid is running
the walk out there.

935
01:04:18,372 --> 01:04:20,499
He moved right in.

936
01:04:20,574 --> 01:04:24,908
Myself, I'm sorry to hear it. But
I'm a businessman so I can't help you.

937
01:04:24,979 --> 01:04:28,574
Take whatever cut you want.
You want something else, something more?

938
01:04:28,649 --> 01:04:30,708
You're not hearing me!

939
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,014
I never bet on nobody
past their prime.

940
01:04:44,164 --> 01:04:46,928
Hi, Benny.
Yeah, it's me.

941
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:54,763
In all the years we've been together,
this is the first time I've been here.

942
01:04:54,842 --> 01:04:56,605
I know.

943
01:04:56,677 --> 01:04:58,440
It's a nice place.

944
01:04:58,512 --> 01:05:01,606
It's a shithole.

945
01:05:01,682 --> 01:05:03,616
But there's a terrific shower.

946
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:05,675
Best shower I ever had.

947
01:05:05,753 --> 01:05:09,189
I appreciate this. I'm gonna get
that back to you right away.

948
01:05:12,259 --> 01:05:14,693
I'll get it back to you.

949
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:17,060
Yeah.

950
01:05:17,131 --> 01:05:20,498
Well, you know.

951
01:05:20,567 --> 01:05:24,298
I'm worried about you.
You don't plan for your future.

952
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:27,101
The future's coming.

953
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:31,201
I ain't always gonna be around
to take care of you.

954
01:05:31,278 --> 01:05:33,269
When something goes wrong,
what are you gonna do?

955
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:35,440
Are you gonna lend me this money
or not?

956
01:05:44,725 --> 01:05:48,821
I'm gonna turn this thing right over.
It's a piece of cake.

957
01:05:48,896 --> 01:05:51,057
I'll call you in the morning.

958
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:55,658
- Gary?
- What?

959
01:05:57,004 --> 01:05:58,938
This on the up-and-up?

960
01:05:59,006 --> 01:06:01,907
We always worked legit.

961
01:06:01,975 --> 01:06:05,035
It's not a problem.
I told you, it is totally legit.

962
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,648
We're gonna be okay, old man.

963
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,792
Five grand.
Knock yourself out.

964
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:27,758
A funny thing happens to me
this morning. I can hardly believe it.

965
01:06:27,835 --> 01:06:31,771
I get a phone call that someone else
is interested in buying these items.

966
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:35,935
I'm thinking, maybe I am underpriced.

967
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:38,944
So I tell this other guy six large.
He says, "Fine."

968
01:06:39,012 --> 01:06:43,312
He's on his way as we speak.
Sorry.

969
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,956
Okay. Sorry? Sorry?

970
01:06:56,029 --> 01:07:00,295
You'll bet your knees this guy is gonna
show up while I have cash on hand?

971
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:04,064
Sorry? Okay, sorry. Have a nice meal.
Hope you choke to death.

972
01:07:04,138 --> 01:07:05,571
Wait.
Come here.

973
01:07:06,373 --> 01:07:09,171
You want this or not?
I got five grand here!

974
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:11,541
I don't care if you take it or not
because I'm tired...

975
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:14,547
of looking at you slobbering
all over yourself!

976
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:17,243
So, are you going to take
this money or not?

977
01:07:17,317 --> 01:07:20,150
Right now! One, two...

978
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:21,653
Yes!

979
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:39,267
Just four more days to the Papal Mass.
The city looks like Rome on the Hudson.

980
01:07:39,339 --> 01:07:43,673
You can't go anywhere without running
into someone selling pope memorabilia.

981
01:07:43,744 --> 01:07:47,043
Make a move here, Benny.

982
01:07:47,114 --> 01:07:51,483
Remind me to go by the Beacon.
You go by the "Y" and take out Blinker.

983
01:07:51,552 --> 01:07:53,918
Forget about Arty at the Broadhurst.
He's dead.

984
01:07:55,189 --> 01:07:58,647
We'll go to
Madison Square Garden someday.

985
01:07:58,725 --> 01:08:01,023
Benny, we ain't got all day.
Let's go, make a move.

986
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:05,155
You writing this down?
Write this down. What's the matter?

987
01:08:05,232 --> 01:08:09,032
You didn't get them tickets
from no stadium guy.

988
01:08:09,102 --> 01:08:11,832
- What are you talking about?
- You got them from Fat Max.

989
01:08:11,905 --> 01:08:14,135
So what? Let's go.
Let's make a move!

990
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:16,472
So what? He's scum!

991
01:08:16,543 --> 01:08:19,273
Who knows what he did?
Who knows where he got them?

992
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:21,814
- Who cares?
- You used to care.

993
01:08:21,882 --> 01:08:25,750
Don't start with me.
Come on, get off my back!

994
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:28,515
Do you want your money back?
I'll give it back.

995
01:08:28,589 --> 01:08:30,955
- You want it back?
- You know that's not it.

996
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,549
Then what do you want from me?
Want me to give up on Linda?

997
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:36,824
To give up the best thing
that's ever happened in my life?

998
01:08:36,897 --> 01:08:41,095
Don't you think I look at you every day
and pray to God I don't turn into you?

999
01:08:41,168 --> 01:08:45,468
A broken-down nobody with a bunch
of stories, half of which are bullshit.

1000
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:48,599
But at least you have stories!

1001
01:08:48,675 --> 01:08:52,873
I got nothing, but now I got my shot.
These tickets are my way out of here.

1002
01:08:52,946 --> 01:08:57,349
I'm gonna take my shot. I've been paying
for your fuck-ups for 11 years.

1003
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:59,908
You're no one to tell me
how to run my life.

1004
01:08:59,987 --> 01:09:03,184
Have you ever beaten anybody
in the ring?

1005
01:09:03,257 --> 01:09:05,452
Yes, I have.
And I was an honest fighter.

1006
01:09:05,525 --> 01:09:07,686
You were a human punching bag,
now you're a gofer for me.

1007
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:12,130
Perfect. We're doing great.
What am I saying?

1008
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:18,504
Come on, Benny, I didn't mean that.

1009
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:21,166
- That's all right. Just keep the money.
- That's not what I meant.

1010
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:26,110
Maybe it'll help pay for what I cost you
for the last 11 years.

1011
01:09:26,179 --> 01:09:27,840
Good-bye.
Leave me alone.

1012
01:09:32,352 --> 01:09:35,253
Benny, wait a second.
Stop, please.

1013
01:09:35,322 --> 01:09:37,313
I'm sorry I got mad at you.

1014
01:09:37,391 --> 01:09:39,359
I didn't mean what I said.

1015
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:41,951
You're the best fighter.
You're the best corner man.

1016
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:46,363
I just need a little room on this thing.
Just this once.

1017
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,094
You said things...

1018
01:09:48,168 --> 01:09:52,127
I know. I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry. Listen to me.

1019
01:09:52,205 --> 01:09:54,673
- Look at me.
- You said things.

1020
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:56,971
Keep your chin up here.
I gotta talk to you.

1021
01:09:57,044 --> 01:10:00,946
Stick with me. You're what separates me
from the scum of this earth.

1022
01:10:01,014 --> 01:10:04,848
You give me class.
Please stick with me on this one thing.

1023
01:10:04,918 --> 01:10:08,752
Okay? You're my corner man.
When I hurt, you stop the bleeding.

1024
01:10:08,822 --> 01:10:11,222
I'm bleeding right now,
and I need you.

1025
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:13,816
This one time, I need you.
Please.

1026
01:10:13,894 --> 01:10:15,987
- You really need me?
- Absolutely.

1027
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,224
I need you.
Please.

1028
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,095
One shot.

1029
01:10:21,168 --> 01:10:23,329
If you need me, okay.

1030
01:10:23,403 --> 01:10:26,668
You're all I got, kid.

1031
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:29,004
I got nobody else.

1032
01:11:02,909 --> 01:11:04,399
Gary!

1033
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,106
All right!

1034
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:12,811
- How you doing, man? Cool shirt!
- Where's Mrs. Paliski?

1035
01:11:12,886 --> 01:11:15,081
Over here. Come on.
Time out. Let's go.

1036
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:19,723
I heard Linda dumped you.
Total bummer.

1037
01:11:20,727 --> 01:11:22,160
Ma!

1038
01:11:25,899 --> 01:11:30,859
I'm so happy to see you!
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

1039
01:11:30,937 --> 01:11:32,734
Free food, great broads.

1040
01:11:32,806 --> 01:11:37,505
Cut the crap. I know you.
You got something up your sleeve.

1041
01:11:37,577 --> 01:11:40,045
- Want a beer?
- Yes.

1042
01:11:41,248 --> 01:11:43,216
Look, everybody!

1043
01:11:50,323 --> 01:11:52,791
She gave you the stare.
You know what that means.

1044
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:54,292
A long one.

1045
01:11:59,599 --> 01:12:01,362
Twice with the stare.

1046
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:04,935
Everybody, home movies!

1047
01:12:09,976 --> 01:12:12,945
Why do we subject ourselves to this
every year? Why?

1048
01:12:13,013 --> 01:12:18,280
Why? You don't like living the most
boring moments of the past every year?

1049
01:12:19,386 --> 01:12:25,052
There's been a major technological
breakthrough. What's it called?

1050
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:27,753
Oh, yeah. Video.

1051
01:12:27,828 --> 01:12:30,797
So you can fast forward
through all my stuff? Never.

1052
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,360
Okay, here she comes.
Cut the lights.

1053
01:12:44,144 --> 01:12:46,840
This ain't Busch Gardens.

1054
01:12:46,913 --> 01:12:49,074
I was sure I put on the right reel.

1055
01:12:49,149 --> 01:12:51,344
It's Gary and Linda.

1056
01:12:51,418 --> 01:12:53,682
You got it out of focus.

1057
01:12:53,753 --> 01:12:56,187
Leave it. We want to see this.

1058
01:12:58,592 --> 01:13:02,528
When did Blinky develop
that skin rash?

1059
01:13:02,596 --> 01:13:04,757
You guys make a lovely couple.

1060
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:12,800
Oh, what a couple!

1061
01:13:18,545 --> 01:13:19,978
Good work.

1062
01:13:59,953 --> 01:14:02,080
I knew you'd be here.

1063
01:14:02,155 --> 01:14:05,318
- You embarrassed me.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1064
01:14:05,392 --> 01:14:08,884
I just wanted to give you
this little not-going-away present.

1065
01:14:11,398 --> 01:14:13,696
I found it in one of my bags.

1066
01:14:13,767 --> 01:14:16,099
It's a trophy.

1067
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:22,608
This is what's important.
It's a first-place couples competition.

1068
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:25,770
Remember?
We won it at Macy's picnic.

1069
01:14:25,845 --> 01:14:28,814
We won the three-legged race...

1070
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:32,318
the tag-team sack race
and the egg pushing contest.

1071
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:35,684
- Want to know why?
- 'Cause we weren't drinking.

1072
01:14:37,157 --> 01:14:39,489
No. Because we were
the best couple together.

1073
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:42,426
Best first-place couple.

1074
01:14:42,495 --> 01:14:45,089
Best together.
Me and you.

1075
01:14:45,165 --> 01:14:50,660
I'm working on something that will
resolve your problems. Listen to me.

1076
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:54,696
Don't you ever get tired
of dreaming?

1077
01:14:54,774 --> 01:14:57,675
Ever since we met, you've dreamed
of wonderful things for us.

1078
01:14:57,744 --> 01:15:03,444
Things that have made my heart soar.
But what do we have to show for it?

1079
01:15:03,516 --> 01:15:06,610
- What?
- Let me show you.

1080
01:15:08,388 --> 01:15:12,085
I loved you like I have loved no other,
and believed in you with all my heart.

1081
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:15,559
But I need to know what is gonna happen
with the rest of my life.

1082
01:15:15,629 --> 01:15:17,290
Give me two weeks...

1083
01:15:17,364 --> 01:15:19,525
and I'll show you.

1084
01:15:30,744 --> 01:15:32,735
I'm gonna miss you.

1085
01:15:38,685 --> 01:15:42,553
Okay, a week. One week!

1086
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:49,326
Hi, sweetie. How are you?

1087
01:15:49,396 --> 01:15:51,990
- Great!
- Mind if I join you?

1088
01:15:52,065 --> 01:15:56,434
Please. I'd love the company.
Want a bite?

1089
01:15:56,503 --> 01:15:59,961
No. I don't like
to mix my meats.

1090
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,498
That looks too rich.
Been having a little indigestion lately.

1091
01:16:03,576 --> 01:16:05,601
I wonder why.

1092
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,910
It's not the dogs.
It's the chemicals.

1093
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:12,751
It's really nice to see you.

1094
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:15,947
What brings you to the neighborhood?
Do you have business?

1095
01:16:16,022 --> 01:16:20,618
No. I just wanna talk to you
about Gary.

1096
01:16:20,694 --> 01:16:22,889
There's nothing left to say.

1097
01:16:24,431 --> 01:16:27,764
Do you see what it's been like for him
these years with nobody?

1098
01:16:29,135 --> 01:16:32,935
I know he doesn't have a family.
I brought him into mine.

1099
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:35,634
I wanted to start a family with him.

1100
01:16:35,709 --> 01:16:40,737
Look. Do you think leaving him
is easy? It's not.

1101
01:16:43,983 --> 01:16:47,316
You're everything to him.
You're his angel.

1102
01:16:52,792 --> 01:16:56,990
He's onto something,
and I don't know what.

1103
01:16:57,063 --> 01:17:01,432
But he's onto something,
and it's important.

1104
01:17:05,405 --> 01:17:09,808
There's a different look in his eyes.
I never saw it before.

1105
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:12,174
There's a burning in there.

1106
01:17:12,245 --> 01:17:15,874
It's intense.

1107
01:17:15,949 --> 01:17:18,747
It's a determination, like a focus.

1108
01:17:18,818 --> 01:17:23,585
You'll see what I'm talking about,
because it's there.

1109
01:17:23,656 --> 01:17:25,180
I want...

1110
01:17:26,826 --> 01:17:30,057
I'm gonna ask you
to do something for me.

1111
01:17:31,264 --> 01:17:33,425
It'll make this old man feel like...

1112
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:39,166
he's finally done something meaningful
later on in his life.

1113
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,969
Will you promise me something?

1114
01:17:42,942 --> 01:17:46,343
No, no. This is not
what my partner and I had in mind.

1115
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:50,439
-You'll have to swing two years on that.
-We're looking for five.

1116
01:17:50,517 --> 01:17:53,452
You'll have to swing two,
and you got till Monday.

1117
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,455
There's another buyer interested.

1118
01:17:57,791 --> 01:18:01,158
No, there's not.
I'll see you Monday.

1119
01:18:20,914 --> 01:18:22,404
Benny!

1120
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:30,218
Benny, let's go.
Let's make a move.

1121
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:32,349
Three more days to show time!

1122
01:18:32,425 --> 01:18:35,189
Come on, let's go. Benny.

1123
01:20:18,264 --> 01:20:19,891
This is it?

1124
01:20:19,966 --> 01:20:23,367
Yes. It's a lovely spot!
Isn't it?

1125
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:35,881
How much for something
with a little privacy?

1126
01:20:46,693 --> 01:20:48,354
This way.

1127
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:55,890
Level, dickhead. Pick it up!

1128
01:20:55,969 --> 01:20:57,994
I got the heavy end.

1129
01:21:11,317 --> 01:21:13,581
Sister Betrayal, English, please.

1130
01:21:15,588 --> 01:21:19,183
- Some lives begin with birth.
- Some?

1131
01:21:19,258 --> 01:21:21,226
Some?

1132
01:21:22,228 --> 01:21:24,924
Others take flight.

1133
01:21:24,998 --> 01:21:26,260
Be quiet.

1134
01:21:26,332 --> 01:21:29,426
Faster, Father.

1135
01:21:29,502 --> 01:21:32,232
Guys, give him a break.
He's trying to do his job.

1136
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:35,172
Lose the priest. Padre,
go get yourself a whiskey sour.

1137
01:21:35,241 --> 01:21:38,335
Gary, you say something about him.
You knew him best.

1138
01:21:38,411 --> 01:21:40,402
Yeah, right, Gary.

1139
01:21:41,447 --> 01:21:43,642
Nice try. Tough crowd.

1140
01:21:51,457 --> 01:21:53,755
A lot of things
I could say about Benny.

1141
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,852
He liked you guys a lot.

1142
01:21:59,465 --> 01:22:02,457
Nobody played a cripple
better than Benny.

1143
01:22:02,535 --> 01:22:03,968
That's true.

1144
01:22:04,037 --> 01:22:05,629
For sure.

1145
01:22:09,809 --> 01:22:12,039
Excuse me.

1146
01:22:14,247 --> 01:22:16,044
Excuse us.

1147
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:36,266
- You Gary?
- Yes, sir.

1148
01:22:36,335 --> 01:22:37,927
Thanks for calling.

1149
01:22:39,072 --> 01:22:41,302
Thanks for coming, Champ.

1150
01:22:43,509 --> 01:22:45,443
Hook 'em, Benny!

1151
01:22:45,511 --> 01:22:47,069
Thank you.

1152
01:22:51,918 --> 01:22:54,352
Hey, Joe,
I was Benny's best friend.

1153
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,911
Sorry, Benny.
I thought it was all bullshit.

1154
01:22:56,989 --> 01:22:58,980
Let's go get an autograph.

1155
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:12,864
Benny was lucky to have you
in his life.

1156
01:23:14,874 --> 01:23:17,399
You meant the world to him.

1157
01:23:22,014 --> 01:23:23,948
Look at this.

1158
01:23:30,623 --> 01:23:32,955
You want a ride to the city?

1159
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,091
I wanna stay here for a while.

1160
01:23:54,981 --> 01:23:56,414
What is it?

1161
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:00,013
It's there!

1162
01:24:00,887 --> 01:24:03,014
What does that mean?

1163
01:24:04,357 --> 01:24:08,657
Benny came to see me the other day and
said you were going to ask me something.

1164
01:24:08,728 --> 01:24:13,097
And that no matter what it was,
I was to say "yes."

1165
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:16,135
To do that for him.

1166
01:24:23,442 --> 01:24:28,607
Okay. Will you meet me
some place Monday at 9:00 a.m.?

1167
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:36,918
It'll be the last thing I ask of you.
Monday, 9:00 a.m., 157 Duane Street.

1168
01:24:38,057 --> 01:24:39,752
Please, for Benny.

1169
01:24:43,362 --> 01:24:45,592
Not just for Benny.

1170
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,599
For you.

1171
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,145
Tomorrow's the big day.
Papal Mass at Yankee Stadium.

1172
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:15,550
Can I come in?

1173
01:25:15,628 --> 01:25:20,031
No. And I ain't got
any money for you.

1174
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,799
Fat Max got arrested yesterday.

1175
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:28,636
Those tickets you got,
they were for...

1176
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:33,145
some church thing, some charity thing
and they're looking for you.

1177
01:25:37,817 --> 01:25:41,685
The heat's really heavy on this.

1178
01:26:03,209 --> 01:26:05,177
Don't cry, please.

1179
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:07,178
Don't cry. Okay?

1180
01:26:08,748 --> 01:26:10,682
Listen to me.

1181
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:14,652
I know a Dr. Perlman.
He's a good friend. I sell him tickets.

1182
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,621
I'm gonna take you there tomorrow,
and we're gonna get you all better.

1183
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:20,625
And clean you up.
And this baby's gonna be fine.

1184
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:27,665
You ever hear that
it's good for kids to listen to music?

1185
01:26:30,169 --> 01:26:31,898
Wanna see?

1186
01:26:34,073 --> 01:26:36,769
- Wait. Wait.
- You don't want to?

1187
01:26:36,842 --> 01:26:39,936
No, I'm just scared.

1188
01:26:40,012 --> 01:26:41,445
Wait.

1189
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,715
That's beautiful.

1190
01:26:59,031 --> 01:27:02,694
Earl "The Pearl" Monroe.
He's goin'! He's movin'!

1191
01:27:02,768 --> 01:27:08,263
He's got it. Turning the ball over.
Going for the jump shot.

1192
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:16,546
Let's put this on. Where's the head?
That's the head there?

1193
01:27:39,138 --> 01:27:42,107
Good morning, New York!
The big day has arrived.

1194
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:45,473
The Papal Mass at Yankee Stadium
in four hours.

1195
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:25,813
Forgive me, Father,
for I am about to sin.

1196
01:29:07,626 --> 01:29:11,460
Come on, folks. Tickets, 900 a pop.

1197
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:13,589
It's once in a lifetime.

1198
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:15,600
This is genuine Popesicles...

1199
01:29:15,668 --> 01:29:19,365
made with Vatican sugar
and holy water.

1200
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:22,498
T-shirts.
New from the Vatican collection.

1201
01:29:22,575 --> 01:29:25,373
Pope T-shirts.
He's back, he's here!

1202
01:29:27,379 --> 01:29:31,008
This is the big score. He wasn't
at the apartment. He's gotta be here.

1203
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:33,381
The guy is here.

1204
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:35,716
- Thank you very much.
- Did you see Gary?

1205
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:39,747
He's not gonna be here.
With all these people around? No way.

1206
01:29:39,825 --> 01:29:43,420
A lot of oscars here.
I hope he stays low. Pope T-shirts.

1207
01:30:02,348 --> 01:30:07,684
Excuse me, Sister.
This guy is looking for a pair.

1208
01:30:07,753 --> 01:30:11,450
You got $600? Box seats.
Right behind first base.

1209
01:30:12,424 --> 01:30:15,018
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Let's go.

1210
01:30:15,094 --> 01:30:17,153
Bless you, my son.

1211
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:20,097
- How are we doing?
- Very nice.

1212
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,190
Say some Hail Marys.
We might pull this off.

1213
01:30:22,268 --> 01:30:25,066
- Been there, done that.
- See ya.

1214
01:30:25,137 --> 01:30:29,073
Tickets? Close enough
to count the beads.

1215
01:30:32,878 --> 01:30:34,311
$500.

1216
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:44,655
You got tickets?
What do you need? Two?

1217
01:30:44,723 --> 01:30:47,055
The oscars.

1218
01:30:48,294 --> 01:30:51,991
Right there.
Knock yourself out.

1219
01:30:52,064 --> 01:30:54,862
A lady and a lucky man.
I'll say a prayer for you.

1220
01:30:57,069 --> 01:31:00,937
He's dressed up. The guy's here.
I'm telling you. He's everywhere.

1221
01:31:01,006 --> 01:31:05,170
There's no way he couldn't be here.
Hey, give me a break.

1222
01:31:07,413 --> 01:31:09,472
Tickets? Tickets?

1223
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:14,679
Very clever.
That's very, very clever.

1224
01:31:14,753 --> 01:31:18,189
You almost pulled this off.
Almost.

1225
01:31:18,257 --> 01:31:20,350
The dance is over, my friend.

1226
01:31:21,493 --> 01:31:24,860
Police! Police!
It's him! That's him!

1227
01:31:30,102 --> 01:31:31,865
Over here.

1228
01:32:37,002 --> 01:32:39,232
He say anything?

1229
01:32:41,206 --> 01:32:45,040
I'm here to ask you one more time.

1230
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:47,670
Where are those tickets?

1231
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:03,192
I don't know anything
about any tickets.

1232
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,260
He's lying.
We'll get him.

1233
01:33:57,816 --> 01:34:00,614
Knock 'em dead, Pope.

1234
01:34:00,686 --> 01:34:02,711
Knock 'em dead.

1235
01:34:11,163 --> 01:34:14,360
You've been blessed. Now get out.

1236
01:34:47,232 --> 01:34:48,824
Hey, brother.

1237
01:34:52,237 --> 01:34:56,139
What happened today, all that commotion
you had to go through...

1238
01:34:57,309 --> 01:34:59,470
was 'cause of me.

1239
01:35:01,046 --> 01:35:04,914
Remember when I told you
this was the wild west?

1240
01:35:04,983 --> 01:35:06,575
Well...

1241
01:35:06,652 --> 01:35:09,644
I'm the one with all the horses
and I got all the land.

1242
01:35:09,721 --> 01:35:13,748
You want to work on my land,
you have to pay the baron's price.

1243
01:35:13,826 --> 01:35:15,726
Works like this.

1244
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:21,357
I supply tickets and protection
for 70% of your take.

1245
01:35:24,903 --> 01:35:29,203
Okay. Why don't you
go fuck yourself?

1246
01:35:32,311 --> 01:35:34,074
Piece of shit!

1247
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:44,949
Hold him up. Hold him up.

1248
01:35:45,023 --> 01:35:47,184
Hold him up.

1249
01:35:47,259 --> 01:35:49,727
Like that? Like that shit?

1250
01:35:50,963 --> 01:35:54,922
That's for calling me coconut,
you fuck! Let's go.

1251
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,025
Let's go.

1252
01:35:57,102 --> 01:35:58,535
Shit!

1253
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:05,442
Gary?

1254
01:36:06,945 --> 01:36:10,642
- Are you all right?
- Let me help you up.

1255
01:36:12,217 --> 01:36:14,549
- You all right?
- He's all bloody.

1256
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:17,384
Shit. Come on.

1257
01:36:17,456 --> 01:36:19,651
Oh. Oh, man.

1258
01:36:21,994 --> 01:36:25,987
- I got it.
- You all right?

1259
01:36:26,064 --> 01:36:29,261
- I got it, I got it.
- All right.

1260
01:36:29,334 --> 01:36:32,360
- Slow down. Hold on.
- Easy. You aren't going anywhere.

1261
01:36:32,437 --> 01:36:35,099
I'm okay. I got it.

1262
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:41,072
Where are you going?
Come on, hang on.

1263
01:36:41,146 --> 01:36:43,808
Hey, I don't work here no more.

1264
01:38:20,679 --> 01:38:24,376
Yes, Mr. Starke? I'm Ray Charles
from Farmer's Insurance.

1265
01:38:25,584 --> 01:38:27,575
Mr. Starke, sir?

1266
01:38:30,455 --> 01:38:32,946
- What?
- I know. I get that all the time.

1267
01:38:33,025 --> 01:38:36,324
I'm obviously not that Ray Charles.
But I'm not here to sell you insurance.

1268
01:38:36,395 --> 01:38:39,387
May I come in just a moment?

1269
01:38:40,866 --> 01:38:43,391
Just take a moment of your time.

1270
01:38:46,138 --> 01:38:49,596
I just have a couple questions
for you on this whole thing.

1271
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:52,336
Obviously...

1272
01:38:52,411 --> 01:38:54,777
you are the...

1273
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:58,111
Gary Starke who resides
at 215 West 23rd Street.

1274
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,152
Yeah.

1275
01:39:03,288 --> 01:39:05,984
Good. Now as...

1276
01:39:06,058 --> 01:39:09,892
Mr. Moran's sole beneficiary
on the life insurance policy...

1277
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:15,058
what I need to do is get a couple
of paperwork things finished up.

1278
01:39:15,133 --> 01:39:17,829
What did you say there?

1279
01:39:17,903 --> 01:39:19,803
Benjamin Moran.

1280
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:22,999
He has you listed as the beneficiary
on his life insurance policy.

1281
01:39:24,142 --> 01:39:27,737
We've been looking for you
for almost a week.

1282
01:39:27,813 --> 01:39:32,773
I don't usually find it so hard
to give away $56,000.

1283
01:39:32,851 --> 01:39:34,580
Tax free.

1284
01:39:37,355 --> 01:39:40,415
If I can see some identification.

1285
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:55,364
I don't have any identification.

1286
01:39:59,211 --> 01:40:01,145
That is correct.

1287
01:40:01,213 --> 01:40:05,946
It says the recipient should have
no means of identification.

1288
01:40:06,017 --> 01:40:09,316
In which case, Mr. Starke...

1289
01:40:09,387 --> 01:40:13,881
I can give you this, sir.

1290
01:40:13,959 --> 01:40:16,985
If I can just
leave this with you.

1291
01:40:17,062 --> 01:40:20,190
And I almost forgot.
Bear with me.

1292
01:40:20,265 --> 01:40:25,635
The City Probate Office asked me
to forward this to you.

1293
01:40:25,704 --> 01:40:27,331
I said I would.

1294
01:40:27,405 --> 01:40:30,738
That's for you as well.

1295
01:40:30,809 --> 01:40:34,404
I do wish you a very good day.

1296
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:36,709
Good luck to you, sir.

1297
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:40,410
Have a really fine day, sir.
Good-bye.

1298
01:41:19,791 --> 01:41:21,622
All there.

1299
01:41:27,299 --> 01:41:29,995
Benny! Yes!

1300
01:41:31,036 --> 01:41:32,731
Linda?

1301
01:41:33,972 --> 01:41:36,907
Linda, I'm coming.

1302
01:41:44,916 --> 01:41:47,544
Open up.
I know you don't leave till tomorrow.

1303
01:41:47,619 --> 01:41:50,247
Sorry. Where's Linda?

1304
01:41:50,322 --> 01:41:52,085
Linda's gone.

1305
01:41:53,258 --> 01:41:57,422
I'm the new tenant. I'm Vickie.
Who are you?

1306
01:42:00,398 --> 01:42:03,299
Rhonda. Rhonda.
It's me Gary. Open up.

1307
01:42:03,368 --> 01:42:05,131
- What?
- Where is she?

1308
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,262
I don't have to tell you anything.

1309
01:42:07,339 --> 01:42:11,070
Please open the door.
Please open the door. One time.

1310
01:42:13,178 --> 01:42:18,013
- I beg of you. Tell me where'd she go.
- Why should I tell you anything?

1311
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:22,144
I want to do this one thing for her.
Just one thing. Please.

1312
01:42:23,688 --> 01:42:28,489
She at her mom's. But you're too late.
They're on their way to the airport.

1313
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:30,823
Good luck.

1314
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:34,991
Mrs. Paliski?
Yeah, this is Gary.

1315
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:38,832
Listen. No, everything's fine.
I need you to do me a favor.

1316
01:42:44,109 --> 01:42:47,476
Which way are you going?

1317
01:42:47,545 --> 01:42:50,742
Honey, let the man do his job.

1318
01:42:50,815 --> 01:42:53,511
But I said Kennedy.

1319
01:42:53,585 --> 01:42:56,053
You missed the tunnel.
Can you turn back?

1320
01:42:56,121 --> 01:42:57,645
Relax.

1321
01:43:00,292 --> 01:43:03,318
That's it. I'm writing down
your badge number.

1322
01:43:05,697 --> 01:43:10,794
The old broad gave me a fifty to take
you to this corner and drop you off.

1323
01:43:10,869 --> 01:43:13,394
For fifty more, I will take you
wherever you want to go.

1324
01:43:13,471 --> 01:43:16,463
- I'm not giving you a dime.
- Then get out!

1325
01:43:23,214 --> 01:43:25,239
I don't know what is going on.

1326
01:43:25,317 --> 01:43:28,582
I don't know.
I just like the guy.

1327
01:43:28,653 --> 01:43:31,349
And if I'm wrong,
you'll just have to forgive me.

1328
01:43:36,061 --> 01:43:38,029
Taxi! Yo!

1329
01:46:02,674 --> 01:46:04,164
Come with me.

1330
01:46:06,511 --> 01:46:08,672
Three. Table seven.

1331
01:46:27,899 --> 01:46:31,596
Service charge is included.
Go in peace, Gary.

1332
01:46:31,669 --> 01:46:34,399
Thank you, Father.
In peace I go.

1333
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:46,116
Honey, have you noticed
we are $200 to $300 over every night?

1334
01:46:46,184 --> 01:46:47,344
Really?

1335
01:46:47,418 --> 01:46:49,784
Do you have any idea why?

1336
01:46:49,854 --> 01:46:51,378
Not a clue.

1337
01:46:51,456 --> 01:46:55,984
Really? Could you take the pot
and follow me?

1338
01:47:15,013 --> 01:47:19,143
Gary, let it go. Leave it.

1339
01:47:21,286 --> 01:47:23,811
Save the paper.

1340
01:54:24,742 --> 01:54:27,472
Five dollars, five dollars.

1341
01:54:32,049 --> 01:54:34,040
Five dollars, ma'am.
Five dollars, huh?

1342
01:54:35,186 --> 01:54:37,586
Nice haircut.
What size bowl they use?

1343
01:54:41,325 --> 01:54:43,452
