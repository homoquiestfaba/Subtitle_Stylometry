Dad? No, I'm in the elevator.
I might lose you.

9
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:12,067
- Why'd your number come up "private"?
<i>- Because I blocked it.</i>

I was working in Mexico, Dad.

- Oh, yeah.

- You're not fooling anyone.

- Did she say why?

No, but I assume

- Thanks, but I don't want 'em.

I have an appointment to get to.

Maureen, it's Cooper.

Hey, Maureen.

00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:49,001
Hey. Hi.

00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:51,000

Hi. Hey, everything's...
Everything's gonna be...

71

It's gonna be OK.

72
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,090
You know, my watch says it's the 26th,

73
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,802
so I think that means
we've been out since Friday.

74
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,374
- Hey, Ed. Wake up, big guy.
- I don't remember any break-in.

a giant bug.

00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,510
In the office.

Oh, my God. Sara. 
I have a daughter.

about my family, too.

She's outside in a car.
She was picking me up.

Hey, wait! Maureen,
there could be more things out there!

90
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:57,208
More what?

Stop, stop, stop. It doesn't feel good

- In that car? OK, alright.

00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:19,392

we'll all go back inside together, OK?

Look, I've been awake
ten minutes longer than you.

129
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:03,884
Right.

130
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:08,186
<i>(Cooper)</i> What are you doing?
No. I made that mistake already.

131
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,874
Now's not the right time
to be waking people up, OK?

132
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,292
You ever hear of teamwork?

133
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,857
Anything can happen
when you wake somebody up.

134
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,268
These are human beings in cocoons.
We can't leave them like this.

135
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:21,192
You wake everyone up,
you gotta give an explanation,

136
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:23,681
and then everyone goes off
on their own tangents.

137
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:26,404
So I'm thinking
the safest place for these people

138
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:28,364
is to be in the cocoons.

139
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:30,245
Oh, sh... Oh, shit!

140
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:33,193

Get our bearings, form a plan?
What are you doing?

145
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:08,716
You're really gonna wake people up

146
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:12,707
- I'm waking everyone in this room.
- What is she?

00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:17,432
<i>(Sara)</i> OK, I know
this is all very confusing.

Cooper and I don't have

149
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:23,375
But what we do know
is that there seems to be bugs,

150

like this dead one on the floor,
crawling all over the place.

151
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,660
And there are flying ones, too.

Whoa. Something's moving out there.

153
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,453

I mean, who do we listen to, you know?

Yeah.

00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,771
<i>(man)</i> Listen up. I got a truck outside.

It's diesel. Strong as an ox.

00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,835
Starting an engine could be a bad idea.
They like noise.

161
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:57,058
We could wait it out, stay here?

162
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,856
Someone more equipped than us
should be working on this.

163
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:01,358
What if they ain't?

164
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:04,119
If we woke up
as many people as possible,

165
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:06,107
we could be too much
for them to control.

166
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,909
They controlled us
or we wouldn't be in this situation.

in here, that's for sure.

334
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,641
I got a protein bar in my jacket.

335
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:30,727
- Here you go.
- You know, I work at WLBZ.

336
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:35,413
Oh! Oh, you're the weather lady.

337
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:38,055
- Oh, that's awesome.
- You know, we could go there.

338
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:41,936
They're hooked up to communication
satellites all over the world.

339
00:27:42,014 --> 00:27:44,425
- We could see how widespread this is.
- Yeah.

340
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:46,919
We should bring it up to the group
in the morning.

341
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:51,746
Well, I mean that... <i>we</i> could go.

342
00:27:52,908 --> 00:27:55,320
Erm... That's...

343
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:00,534
We can't leave them, though, right?

344
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:01,721
No.

345
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:05,757
- I didn't mean...
- That's OK.

346
00:28:05,837 --> 00:28:06,786
I just...

347
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,591
<i>(sobs)</i>

348
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,582
Hey, hey, hey.

349
00:28:13,662 --> 00:28:15,310
Look, erm...

350
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:19,262
It's gonna be OK, alright?
We're gonna figure this thing out.

351
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,024
- Do you really believe that?
- Yeah.

352
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:25,015
I am so glad that we found each other.

353
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,029
Erm...

354
00:28:35,107 --> 00:28:36,983
What are the chances, you know?

355
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:49,447
Right.

356
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:55,050
I should... focus on lookout.

357
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,776
That's for you.

358
00:28:58,661 --> 00:29:00,570
It's blueberry.

359
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:04,791
OK.

360
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,442
<i>(screeching)</i>

361
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,855

364
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,040
Watch out!

00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:29,652
<i>(screeches)</i>

366
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:37,744
- What was it doing?
- Calling for help.

367
00:29:38,597 --> 00:29:39,545
OK.

Cindy?

371
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,173
It's time to go.

372
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:10,850
I won't be joining you.

373
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:15,923
It makes sense that someone remains,
wakes up as many people as possible.

374
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:18,758
It's what I need to do.

375
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,563
Guess you're kind of a loner, huh?

376
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,662
Me? What, because I'm 20 feet ahead?

377
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:43,310
That, and you haven't said very much.

378
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:45,040
What do you wanna hear?

379
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:49,182
Tell me about your boyfriend.

380
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:52,174
- Got it. Thank you for that.
- Got what?

381
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:55,701
The final piece
to the kind of guy you are.

382
00:30:55,783 --> 00:30:58,391
Really? Wow. Do tell.

383
00:30:58,468 --> 00:31:01,305
You're shallow. Solipsistic.

384
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:05,868
Pathologically witty to cope with
family stress. Father issues, obviously.

385
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,785
You consider yourself spiritual,
just so you can meet women.

386
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:10,970
Feelings weren't honoured in your home,

387
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:13,540
so you stopped developing them
around 14,

388
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,414
leaving you
severely emotionally retarded.

389
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,373
I prefer "challenged", by the way.

390
00:31:18,454 --> 00:31:22,481
You know, I tended bar
in a little cantina down in Mexico.

391
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,429
- Got good at reading people myself.
- Take your best shot.

392
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:29,152
You grew up on a farm.
The boys found you quickly.

393
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:32,105
All those sticky fumblings
in the back of a car.

394
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,830
All the while dreaming of getting out,
getting anywhere, all the way to the...

395
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:39,318
The FBI. Cute.

396
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,117
<i>- Silence of the Lambs?</i>
- Yep.

397
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:44,111
You like movies?

398
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,681
I'm gonna walk ahead now.

399
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:51,945
Fine. I'll just walk by myself.

400
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:59,770
This is where you live?

401
00:31:59,848 --> 00:32:02,870
- That's right.
- I'm gonna stay outside.

402
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:08,392
Er, me, too.
I'll keep an eye on things.

403
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:41,004
Oh!

404
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,611
What the?

405
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:08,019
What's wrong?

406
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:14,646
I think she's dead.

407
00:33:14,732 --> 00:33:16,872
What, from the cocoon?

408
00:33:17,994 --> 00:33:21,135
They, er, they didn't web her,
you know. They...

409
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:26,006
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe it's because she was too weak.

410
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:28,578
Or she'd already died.

411
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:34,099
You still have those smokes?

412
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,210
Yeah. Yeah, I still got... Yeah.

413
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:40,927
Hell, yeah, I still got those smokes.

414
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,682
I picked the wrong time to quit.

415
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,200
I'm worried about her.

416
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:01,841
Yeah. Ugh!

417
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:07,742
We're done here.

418
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:12,545
Is that a gun?

419
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:17,486
I'll... I'll go talk to him.

420
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,587
I'm really sorry, Al,
but, er, the gun, erm...

421
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,734
You know, if you use it,
there's only gonna be more of them.

422
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:32,069
Yeah, well,
in case we run out of options,

423
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:34,058
I wanna know it's with me.

424
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:42,536
He's fine. He's fine.

425
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:45,836
- Yeah.
<i>- (Cindy)</i> Come on.

426
00:34:50,408 --> 00:34:53,627
I think it's just, you know,
like a safety blanket, you know?

427
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,771
- Right.
- Yeah.

428
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:59,185
- Like Linus, but with a 12-gauge.
- Yeah.

429
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:04,296
- Chad! Susan!
<i>- (Sara)</i> Shh!

430
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:07,934
It's me! It's Cindy!

431
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:20,554
- Your brother's family?
- No.

432
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:23,628
- Neighbours.
- Why are they here?

433
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:26,425
Why are they all gathered
in a clump together?

434
00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:29,498
Susan? Susan!

435
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:31,224
It's me.

436
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:33,911
- Susan.
<i>- (Sara)</i> Something carried them here?

437
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:36,858
<i>- (Al)</i> Or dragged 'em.
<i>- (moans)</i>

438
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:39,006

439
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:41,230
Come on. Wake up. Wake up, Susan.

440
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,225
Can you see me?

441
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,796
Don't just stand there. Do something.

442
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,051
Chad?

443
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,337
Al, don't.

444
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:06,510
<i>(Cindy)</i> No!

- You're killing him!
- No shit!

450
00:36:45,074 --> 00:36:46,144
Chad.

451
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,509
- How bad?
- Oh, I've done worse shaving.

452
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:56,577
Oh! Oh, yeah, way worse.

453
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:02,831

- You sure?

454
00:37:03,795 --> 00:37:06,010
I'm good. I'm solid.

455
00:37:09,743 --> 00:37:14,030
- What the hell was that thing?
- Some kind of hybrid. Us and them.

456
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:16,986
Look, I understand them
wanting to eat us,

457
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,601
but how does that fit into their plan?

458
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,820
He was doing a job. Yeah.

459
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,152
Carrying little cocoons around.
Collecting them.

460
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:29,839
- I mean, that thing's screwed up.
- That "thing" was my brother.

461
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:32,713
I know. I'm sorry. He seemed nice.

462
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:35,361
Just shut up.
I've had enough of you people.

463
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,770
Even post-apocalypse,
I'm the drunk asshole.

464
00:37:40,854 --> 00:37:42,195
Hm-hmm.

465
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:43,343
Ow!

466
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:45,881
God! A little warning next time, please.

467
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:49,906
- That's gonna sting.
- Oh. I get it. That's funny.

468
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:53,312
Listen, we're gonna go check
the doors and windows,

469
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:55,428
make sure everything's locked up.

470
00:37:55,508 --> 00:37:56,457
Come on, son.

471
00:37:56,544 --> 00:38:00,451
Listen to me. This is really important.

472
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:03,601
I need you to do me a favour.

473
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:09,347
If I ever turn into one of those things
and you're holding a shotgun...

474
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:13,689
...don't... hurt me.

475
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,411
Just run away.

476
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,595
OK?

477
00:38:22,478 --> 00:38:27,072
I used to want something like this to
happen, some kind of cataclysmic event.

478
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:29,842
It seemed really sexy
for it to come down to, like,

479
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:34,360
me and a dog and a woman
and a muscle car.

480
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:38,703
We'd find a cabin in the woods and do
our part to repopulate the planet.

481
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:42,961
At night we'd, like, tell our feral,
spiky-haired little children

482
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,412
stories of, er, of "the before times".

483
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:51,281
When I was young,
before I knew it wasn't a real job,

484
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:54,850
I used to wanna grow up
and be a motorcycle girl.

485
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,461
That's awesome.

486
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,373
Seriously, I could totally
see you doing that.

487
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:02,366
Uh-huh.

488
00:39:02,451 --> 00:39:04,742
- I have a confession to make.
- OK.

489
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,889
You <i>are</i> on match. com?

490
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:12,688
- No.
- Oh. Neither am I.

491
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:15,260
I'm not a medical doctor.

492
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,779
I have my doctorate. Erm...
Well, I'm getting my doctorate.

493
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:22,698
In what?

494
00:39:22,783 --> 00:39:24,888
Psychology.

495
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,458
Got it. Thanks for that.

496
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,414
The final piece of the puzzle that tells
me the type of girl you really are.

497
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:35,093
I stretched the truth
because I don't like to be questioned.

498
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,245
Why not?

499
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:41,305
OK, you're right. I'm sorry.
That was a question. I get it.

500
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,884
- Hold still.
- Wait.

501
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,679
OK, I gotta know
a few things about you first.

502
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:48,863
When's your birthday?
I mean, what sign are you?

503
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:51,162
Are you stalling right now?

504
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,668
- Stalling?

Come on! Get your butt down there.

Jesus Christ!
You could have killed me, lady!

687

That happens
when you wander blindly into the street.

688
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,792
- Well, I was about to cross.
- Yeah, illegally.

689
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:31,708
- Illegally. Are you drunk?
- Are you deranged?

690
00:54:31,787 --> 00:54:33,850
God! I am parking.

691
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:36,543
You can't park in front
of the fire hydrant. You see it?

692
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,725
Wow, nothing gets past you. Alright.
Why don't we just call it even?

- Hey.
- You know, you're really...

696
00:54:51,198 --> 00:54:53,413
No, no, no. No, no. Listen, listen.

697
00:54:55,111 --> 00:54:58,986
My number. In case you decide there's
any damage to the front of your vehicle.

698
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:03,123
Oh, OK. And you just happened
to have it written down?

699
00:55:03,207 --> 00:55:05,695
That's a fantastic question.

700
00:55:05,777 --> 00:55:07,498
No. Mm-mm. No.

701
00:55:07,578 --> 00:55:11,136
I was gonna give it to the girl
that works in my Starbucks.

702
00:55:11,223 --> 00:55:13,983
And I offered it. She said no.

703
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:17,663
Can I get yours, too,
in case I wanna sue you?

704
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,575
Or ask you to dinner?

705
00:55:23,922 --> 00:55:27,325
How about this... Cooper?

706
00:55:27,412 --> 00:55:31,547
I'll leave it so that I contact you...
if I decide there's damage.

707
00:55:32,898 --> 00:55:34,809
Well, I hope you do.

709
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:04,307
<i>(Cooper's dad)</i> Huh.
Even in a crisis, you sleep late.

710
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,305
I made some Joe.

711
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:15,591
You know,
I tried the shortwave this morning.

712
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:19,426
A few automated distress signals,
but no live broadcast.

713
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,997
I never heard that before.

714
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,803
- What's this?
- Oh, yeah.

715
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:28,749
Those hearing aids, they got fried.
The bug juice just toasted 'em.

716
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:32,813
Now, Hugo and I are gonna be ready
to leave in a second.

717
00:56:35,047 --> 00:56:37,337
Put these on ASAP.

718
00:56:37,424 --> 00:56:41,560
Camo? Dad, the...
the bugs are blind, Dad.

719
00:56:41,644 --> 00:56:43,247
If we move at five miles per hour,

720
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:45,668
we should make it to Gibsonton
by sundown.

721
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,924
I think I should be involved
in the decision making from now on.

722
00:56:49,011 --> 00:56:52,807
Cooper, come on.
You're here. You made it here.

723
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:54,641
Well done. Bravo.

724
00:56:54,727 --> 00:56:57,595
Now, just drop your ego.
Let me take over.

725
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,709
Drop?

726
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,964
Dad, look,
I was thinking last night, you know.

727
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:05,889
I was gonna say something.
I should have.

728
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:10,646
- I think I should go to the nest.
- What?

729
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:13,670
That girl, Sara, might be there
or might not be there, but...

730
00:57:13,754 --> 00:57:18,162
- You have a plan to go to the nest?
- No, I don't, but... Look, I think...

731
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:23,186
Dad, I've never done anything in my life
that merits, you know...

732
00:57:23,269 --> 00:57:26,137
I'm selfish. In fact, I'm solipsistic.

733
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:30,317
That's a real word. Look it up
in the dictionary. It's in there.

734
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:32,737
- I'm aware it's a word.
- OK, well, then...

735
00:57:35,238 --> 00:57:37,343
Look, I don't expect you to go.

736
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,290
But I really think I should go,
and I don't think I can do it by myself.

737
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:44,322
- I think I need... I need your help.
- I think it's a crazy idea.

738
00:57:44,407 --> 00:57:47,276
Of course you'd say that.
Of course you'd think it was crazy.

739
00:57:47,361 --> 00:57:50,655
Because, you know, feelings
were never honoured in our home.

740
00:57:59,252 --> 00:58:02,733
Let me tell you a little story.
You're an idiot.

741
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,315
Oh, my God. I'm done.

742
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:07,306
- Always a pissing contest.
- I've no time for this. I'm done.

743
00:58:11,912 --> 00:58:16,243
Alright. So what do you want?
An apology?

744
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:19,160
If you did,
then what would that be for, huh?

745
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:23,680
I have no idea. You and your mother
were always the hypersensitive ones.

746
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:27,869
- I don't have those needs.
- Mom was not hypersensitive, OK?

747
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:29,857
See what I mean?

748
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:35,310
Would it kill you
just to admit for one second

749
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,183
that what I've done so far
isn't terrible?

750
00:58:38,267 --> 00:58:43,439
Cooper, you just don't make
good decisions, alright?

751
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:47,887
Somewhere along the line,
you did not develop good logic skills.

752
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:54,145
Are you gonna take this innocent
with you on your suicide mission?

753
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:56,787
Fuck.

754
00:58:56,874 --> 00:59:00,899
Hugo, you're gonna stay with my dad.

755
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:04,504
Thank you.
You've saved my life a trillion times.

Goddamn it, Coop! He's following you.

757
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:15,821
Hugo, stay with my dad, OK?

758
00:59:18,394 --> 00:59:19,616

Hugo and I got about as far
as the end of the street this morning,

843
01:06:51,956 --> 01:06:55,131
we passed this little dachshund,
all webbed up.

844
01:06:55,218 --> 01:06:58,055
I couldn't just leave it,
so I unwrapped it.

845

Little damn thing
started barking its fool head off.

846
01:07:00,818 --> 01:07:04,691
I was trying to keep its mouth shut when
I felt something drop down behind me.

847

It's pretty funny, actually.

Yeah, sure. I'm in my element.

their back's turned, you say their name,

around, you pretend like you didn't.

I'd bitch about how you only had done
three semesters at the college,

had to do things differently.

your own way, followed your own path.
