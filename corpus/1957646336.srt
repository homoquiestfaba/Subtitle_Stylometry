00:00:01,208 --> 00:00:03,969
[dramatic music]

00:00:10,113 --> 00:00:13,047
[triumphant music]

3
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:26,992
[wind whistling]

4
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:28,959
[music box clicking]

5
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:32,342
[gentle music box music]

6
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:55,124
[Ana Mae chanting
 in foreign language]

7
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:28,053
[Ana Mae praying in
 foreign language]

8
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:54,493
[wind howling]

9
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,329
[gentle hopeful music]

10
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:25,386
[dramatic pensive music]

11
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,082
[ships bell ringing]

12
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:17,231
[gentle pensive music]

13
00:03:57,892 --> 00:04:00,826
[ship horn blaring]

14
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:11,768
- Do you mind?

15
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,599
- Not at all.

16
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,810
- For the love of God, doctor,
 a cigar in this tight space,

17
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,570
you of all people, a doctor.

18
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,571
- Doesn't bother me.

19
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:25,195
I like the way they smell.

20
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,615
In fact, I think you should
 let me light it for you.

21
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:33,376
[lighter clicks]

22
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:38,416
- Perhaps it doesn't bother
 her, but it bothers me.

23
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,314
A doctor should set an example.

24
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:43,248
- Did you know that
 all the great healers

25
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:45,630
smoke cigars or pipes?

26
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,289
- I had imagined that you were
 something more than a healer.

27
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,498
I had thought of you
 as a man of science.

28
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:53,327
- Doctor, healer,
 it's all the same.

29
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:58,539
But cigar smoke is like
 incense, it cleans the air.

30
00:04:58,539 --> 00:04:59,471
[Father scoffs]

31
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:01,024
- What a ridiculous comparison.

32
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:04,200
Incense purifies, this poisons.

33
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,202
- Well, then maybe
 you could tell us

34
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:07,030
a bit more about Brazil.

35
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:11,966
- Well it's as if there
were many countries,

36
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:12,967
all in one.

37
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:18,387
You and your wife are going
 to the most backward region,

38
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,665
where everything
 is yet to be done.

39
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:24,945
As I said, it's very hot and
 the people are rather lazy.

40
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:28,017
Although I ask myself,
 if they're not wiser,

41
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,502
then we are with our
 foolish forecasts,

42
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:33,505
our petty ambitions,
 that have once again,

43
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:36,094
brought us to the
 brink of terrible war.

44
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:36,922
- Brink?

45
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,063
We are already at war.

46
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,962
- You really think so, Captain?

47
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,171
- War has not been declared yet.

48
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:46,138
Consequently,
 there's still hope.

49
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,831
- Really, father, a little
 smoke to clear your head.

50
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,249
[Doctor exhales loudly]

51
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:55,320
- I say there is hope,

52
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,668
but I can see the dark clouds
 that cover up poor Europe.

53
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,465
You two make a beautiful couple,

54
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,125
and you are going to live
 in an oasis of peace.

55
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:10,680
Remember, Frank,
 and you too, Donna,

56
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,027
that millions will
 live in a world

57
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:16,341
filled with hatred,
death, and destruction.

58
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,001
Remember that every
 time you feel superior

59
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:23,313
to those poor,
 peace-loving natives.

60
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:25,177
- Peace loving?

61
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:27,904
They are savages,

62
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:31,736
capable of stabbing
each other for nothing.

63
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:34,566
- Captain, people
 everywhere kill each other;

64
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:40,261
for women, money, political,
 not necessarily in that order.

65
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:41,470
Gentlemen,
 [glass dings]

66
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,955
enough of wars,
 death, stabbings.

67
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:47,061
I propose a toast to the
 lady who has brought light

68
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,062
to our journey.

69
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,513
To Bela Donna.

70
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:55,518
Belladonna, a plant, both
 beautiful and dangerous.

71
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,418
- [All] To Belladonna.

72
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,317
[glasses clinking]

73
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,878
[gentle romantic music]

74
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,374
[waves splashing]

75
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,309
- Why do you always
 behave so improperly?

76
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,657
Lighting someone's cigar
is much too intimate.

77
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,694
- I decided to ignore that rule.

78
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:34,592
- Yes, I noticed.

79
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:40,874
- Did you forget where I'm from?

80
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:43,808
You should have followed
your family's advice

81
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,741
and married one
 of your own kind.

82
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,089
I'm not Donna O'Connor.

83
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:52,057
- [Frank] You come
 from a fine family,

84
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:53,438
you just don't know it yet.

85
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:00,203
- Do you think that
people are who they are?

86
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,275
Or do you think life
 can change them?

87
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,554
- If they want to change.

88
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,905
- You talk to me, tell me
 you came to Brazil for me.

89
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,978
- Oh, Brazil is wild, Donna,
 full of oil and opportunity.

90
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:22,743
- You came for me.

91
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:28,715
Somehow you thought this
 wild place would change me.

92
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,614
Calm me down.

93
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,548
- All right then, just for you.

94
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:43,868

Bela Donna.

153

- What happened?

154
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,790
- She'll be all
 right, Mr. Hookly.

155
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,207
Just keep her out of the sun.

 [burro bellowing]

157
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:45,608

160
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,407
I'm Michael Silver,
 how do you do?

00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,236
- How do you do?

162
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:53,375
- Welcome to Algiers.

163
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,859
This is John, this is Lidia.

164
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:56,033
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

165
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,275
- It's a pleasure,
 this is Donna.

166
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,759
I'm afraid she's not
 feeling very well.

167
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,140
- Oh, we'll have a doctor
 meet you at the house.

168
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,797
A few hours on stable ground,
 you'll feel just fine.

169
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:04,179
- Great.
 - After you please.

You come with me and
John in the yellow one.

173

 - Have a good trip?

 reality for later, shall we?

548
00:46:28,682 --> 00:46:29,890
- Maybe you're right but,

549
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:35,344
I realize that the reason we're
here is because of the war.

550
00:46:35,344 --> 00:46:37,622
And if our husband's find oil

551
00:46:37,622 --> 00:46:41,626
in that God forsaken
 field, then our lives

552
00:46:41,626 --> 00:46:42,903
will be measurably better.

553
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:48,426
Frank might finally find
 some peace, some contentment.

554
00:46:50,704 --> 00:46:51,809
And I would too.

555
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,815
You think I'm shallow.

556
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:04,200
Perhaps, but I choose
 only to let myself

557
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,513
think about the things
 that I can change.

558
00:47:13,313 --> 00:47:15,729
Think whether you want
 it to all go away,

559
00:47:15,729 --> 00:47:18,111
so you can return to the
Europe you left behind?

560
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:23,875
Or perhaps deep down,
 you look forward

561
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,843
to returning to a
 racially pure Europe.

562
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:29,536
- Do you want to know
 why we're still here?

563
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:32,711
John is Jewish.

564
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:35,404
He can't go back.

565
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,961
I don't think I will have
 that drink after all.

566
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:44,240
Suddenly I'm not very thirsty.

609
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:53,927
- Fine.

610
00:56:56,309 --> 00:56:57,517
- You seem very far away.

611
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,485
- No, I'm fine.

612
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:11,393
Let me be for a moment
 the perfect wife.

613
00:57:11,393 --> 00:57:12,636
Can I get you drink, hon?

614
00:57:14,085 --> 00:57:15,017
- No thank you.

615
00:57:15,017 --> 00:57:16,778
- And how was your business.

616
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:18,193
- It's all right.

617
00:57:19,746 --> 00:57:21,438
- And how are we?

618
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,094
- I'm still here.

619
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:24,682
- Yeah, part of you is here.

620
00:57:48,948 --> 00:57:49,776
- I was rude.

621
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:52,227
I brought you these.

622
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:55,575
They're almost like the
ones we have back home.

623
00:57:59,303 --> 00:58:01,236
I had no right to
 speak to you that way.

624
00:58:02,686 --> 00:58:03,514
And I'm sorry.

625
00:58:06,241 --> 00:58:08,346
Now I'm hoping you'll
 offer me drink.

626
00:58:08,346 --> 00:58:10,210
- I was saying to
 John the other day,

627
00:58:12,143 --> 00:58:14,801
it's strange how a war
we're so far away from,

628
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,598
I mean geographically
 far away from,

629
00:58:19,772 --> 00:58:21,428
should affect us so acutely.

630
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,880
It's as though it's
 under our skin.

631
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,505
It's a kind of fear.

632
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,200
A premonition that the world
 we know will no longer exist.

633
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:37,548
[Lidia chuckles]

634
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:40,517
You know, I think I need
 a drink more than you do.

635
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:53,046
- How much of my money do
 you intend to lose here?

636
00:58:53,046 --> 00:58:54,841
- That's not a question
I'm being paid to ask.

637
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:56,671
- At this point it would
be irresponsible of me

638
00:58:56,671 --> 00:58:58,017
not to ask it.

639
00:58:58,017 --> 00:58:59,225
- Sit down, Frank.

640
00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:07,405
I demand a little
 more respect from you.

641
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,201
Your job is to drill.

642
00:59:10,201 --> 00:59:11,755
- If I thought that
 doing my job properly

643
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:13,342
was all that was required-

644
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:15,172
- Look, I have
 geological surveys

645
00:59:15,172 --> 00:59:17,761
that show there is oil to
 be found in this region.

646
00:59:19,176 --> 00:59:20,833
- I say they're not worth
 the paper they're written on.

647
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:24,319
- If there is some reason to
 believe that oil exists here,

648
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,148
then it is your job to find it.

649
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:28,392
- Sounds more and
 more like you hired me

650
00:59:28,392 --> 00:59:30,394
to perform a miracle.

651
00:59:30,394 --> 00:59:31,395
Take it as you will.

652
00:59:32,776 --> 00:59:33,604
- Frank.

653
00:59:36,883 --> 00:59:41,336
If I were you, I'd also
keep an eye on my wife.

 you're such a prick.

00:59:58,940 --> 00:59:59,768
- [Frank] Tonho.

 [Tonho speaks Portuguese]

666
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,454
I want this very much.

I like!

- Woman good, Doctor.

681
01:00:59,863 --> 01:01:01,658
Woman free.

01:04:54,304 --> 01:04:56,375
- She gets me with those
old records of hers.

733
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:01,552
- When did you start
 making friends with women?

734
01:05:05,142 --> 01:05:06,143
- Lidia's my friend.

735
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:13,737
Or have I really
 ever had a friend.

736
01:05:15,463 --> 01:05:16,947
- I'm your friend.

737
01:05:18,121 --> 01:05:20,123
- You know I actually
think you'd like to be.

738
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,197
Why'd you marry me, Frank?

739
01:05:26,163 --> 01:05:27,268
- Because I loved you.

740
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:43,836
- It's not you, you know.

741
01:05:45,596 --> 01:05:46,425
It's me.

742
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:50,705
It's just that sometimes
 your love is suffocating.

743
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:55,158
It just feels as
 though I can't breath.

744
01:05:57,919 --> 01:05:59,265
- I don't do it on purpose.

745
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:02,441
- It's not your fault.

746
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:08,585
[Donna sighs]

747
01:06:08,585 --> 01:06:10,207
I'm not always easy
 to be with either.

748
01:06:13,521 --> 01:06:14,625
I'll try to be better.

749
01:06:19,113 --> 01:06:20,666
It's just that sometimes

750
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:22,909
I think it's only the bad
 parts of me that you love.

[Nô chuckles]

768
01:08:34,765 --> 01:08:38,148

Aah.

777
01:09:14,115 --> 01:09:15,151

[Lidia exhales sharply]

782
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:32,616
What is it?

783

What's he like?

784
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,073
Well, what's it like to
 lie in the sand together?

785
01:09:42,661 --> 01:09:43,972
To be in his raft?

786
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,738
- It's like nothing ever
I've ever known before.

787
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,984
But something I
 always knew existed.

788
01:10:01,127 --> 01:10:03,509
- I think I shall try
 some of this cashew juice.

789
01:10:06,443 --> 01:10:08,031
Mm.

790
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:11,345
[Lidia and Donna laugh]

791
01:10:12,518 --> 01:10:14,900
I guess it's good
 for somethings.

[Donna chuckles]

793
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:19,353
And when you get caught?

794
01:10:23,943 --> 01:10:25,428
- It won't matter.

795
01:10:27,947 --> 01:10:28,845
- Won't it?

796
01:10:30,812 --> 01:10:32,435
'Cause you will get caught.

797
01:10:34,437 --> 01:10:36,059
You're right on the edge of it.

798
01:10:37,336 --> 01:10:38,372
There's talk.

799
01:10:39,338 --> 01:10:40,166
- Talk.

800
01:10:41,927 --> 01:10:43,169
That's the one thing

801
01:10:43,169 --> 01:10:44,447
this place has in
 common with back home.

802
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:49,555
Isn't that right, Benta?

803
01:10:52,696 --> 01:10:54,526
- Here, as in many other
parts of the world,

804
01:10:54,526 --> 01:10:56,459
people stick there nose
 in other peoples business.

805
01:10:56,459 --> 01:10:58,288
- Well it doesn't bother me.

806
01:10:58,288 --> 01:10:59,116
- Well it should.

807
01:11:00,014 --> 01:11:01,705
- It bothers me.

808
01:11:01,705 --> 01:11:03,293
You're my wife, your
 behavior affects me

809
01:11:03,293 --> 01:11:05,295
and the way I'm perceived
 affects the company.

810
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:08,816
- And have I done that
 affects the company, Frank?

811
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,647
- There's talk about
you and that half breed.

812
01:11:12,647 --> 01:11:13,924
- He's not a half breed.

813
01:11:16,824 --> 01:11:18,239
And I am not your property.

814
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:21,691
- This is a very small
world we live in, Donna.

815
01:11:23,175 --> 01:11:24,590
We're not the only ones here.

816
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:29,457
- And what kind of world
is it, if the only thing

817
01:11:29,457 --> 01:11:31,735
people care about is
 small town gossip?

818
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:33,289
- You're being very
 naive, darling.

819
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,876
Do as I tell you.

820
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:37,051
Give me your word you
 won't speak with him again.

821
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:40,882
- I don't know if I can do that.

822
01:11:49,822 --> 01:11:52,963
[Donna sighs angrily]

823
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:57,209
Say something.

824
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:00,730
Say something.

825
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,389
Yell at me, insult me,

826
01:12:04,389 --> 01:12:06,839
just don't sit there
 staring at me like an idiot.

827
01:12:12,086 --> 01:12:13,708
- I had no idea until
 just this minute

828
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,123
how little you respected me.

829
01:12:20,853 --> 01:12:22,130
- You know it's not that.

830
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:23,994
- I don't know
 anything, apparently.

831
01:12:28,965 --> 01:12:31,416
Donna, I thought that
 if I took care of you,

832
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:34,108
you, you would, take care of me.

833
01:12:39,182 --> 01:12:41,460
Silva, John and Lidia
are going into Fortaleza

834
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,323
for the weekend.

835
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:45,222
We'll go with them.

836
01:12:45,222 --> 01:12:46,051
- Ah!

837
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:46,879
- Don't say anything.

838
