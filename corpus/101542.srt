1
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,121
Please.

2
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,971
If he makes it to the river,
he's won.

3
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,375
We cannot allow that
to happen, Mr. Lopaki.

4
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,985
Brandy?

5
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,558
It's like a drug,
isn't it?

6
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,223
To bring a man down.

7
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,904
Was it worth it?

8
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,433
- Every nickel.
- Good.

9
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,462
Yes?

10
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,132
Hi, I'm... I'm looking
for Douglas Binder?

11
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,643
- You a friend of Mr. Binder's?
- No, l...

12
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,714
I'm... I'm his daughter.

13
00:06:55,848 --> 00:07:00,251
Doug was a nice man.
He had manners.

14
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:04,790
He didn't tell you where
he was moving, did he?

15
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,291
He owed some rent,
honey.

16
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,488
I told him he could
wait to pay me...

17
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,260
- 'til he got back on his feet.
- He wasn't in an accident, was he?

18
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:19,099
Oh, no. He lost his job
with the oil tool company.

19
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,298
When Doug moved out,

20
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,604
he left this box.

21
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,071
He told me I could
hold it...

22
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,413
'til he could make up
his back rent.

23
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,620
Do you have any idea
where he might be now?

24
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,127
You might try checking down
at Our Lady of Charity.

25
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,130
Marine, huh?

26
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,462
Ah, Recon.

27
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,366
- I was in the service
for a while myself.
- Really?

28
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,871
- Yeah.
- Do you know him?

29
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,339
Well, he comes here
sometimes.

30
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,377
Nice guy too.
Uh, if I see him,

31
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,448
I'll... I'll tell him
you're looking.

32
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,278
Do you happen to know
where he lives?

33
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,023
I-I'm afraid your...
Your daddy, uh, well...

34
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,060
Well, he was like the rest of us:
Out of doors.

35
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,062
You know?

36
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,928
How is that gumbo, Chance?

37
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,665
A tragedy.

38
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,701
The coffee
was tolerable, though.

39
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:00,329
- It ain't free neither.
- Yeah, I know.

40
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,839
Leave your wallet
in your tuxedo?

41
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,903
I play that one
on you before?

42
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:11,541
- Yeah. For the gumbo.
- That's right.

43
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,475
- If you don't want me, baby
- Hi. Do you have any change?

44
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,137
Baby
please tell me so

45
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,576
- If you don't want me, honey
- Thank you.

46
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,916
Honey
please let me know

47
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,158
But if you don't
want me that bad

48
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,491
Darlin'
please let me know#

49
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,136
Hi, Murray.

50
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,369
Yes, I was wondering if my father
came to pick up his mail yet.

51
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,513
He hasn't? No, that's fine.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

52
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,828
- Hello, pretty lady.
- Leave me the hell alone.

53
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,528
We'll take the wallet.

54
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,333
How about a little
extra, honey?

55
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,011
You having fun?

56
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,620
Why don't you do yourself
a favor, boy?

57
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,988
I think the favor
gonna be done for you.

58
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,221
It's okay.

59
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,197
I said get lost.

60
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:13,704
Now, take your big stick
and your boyfriend...

61
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,467
and find a bus to catch.

62
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,169
Oh, this guy's funny.

63
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,747
Come on, let's go!

64
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,709
Let's go! Come on!

65
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,926
You know, it's a shame. This
used to be such a nice part of town.

66
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,731
Next time be more careful
when you show your wallet.

67
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,826
Without cops, the city stops!

68
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,903
Without cops,
the city stops!

69
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,971
Without cops,
the city stops!

70
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,006
Without cops,
the city stops!

71
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,099
Without cops,
the city stops!

72
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,303
Without cops,
the city stops!

73
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,574
Without cops, the city stops!

74
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,550
- Come on, let's hurry now!
- Without cops, the city stops!

75
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,553
- Will the strike end soon?
- Here you go.

76
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,624
Without cops,
the city stops!

77
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,851
Without cops,
the city stops!

78
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,190
Without cops,
the city stops!

79
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,856
Without cops,
the city stops!

80
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,508
Happy birthday to me.

81
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,579
Excuse me.

82
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:23,495
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. I need to fill out
a missing person report.

83
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,531
Look, I just pulled a double shift.
Why don't you catch me tomorrow.

84
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:33,671
Okay.
Why don't you catch me now.

85
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,741
- What is the name
of the missing individual?
- Douglas Charles Binder.

86
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,244
Relationship
of reporting party?

87
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,874
Daughter.

88
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,248
- Okay. You got a picture?
- Mm-hmm.

89
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:58,760
- Got something a little more recent?
- Oh, no, I don't.

90
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,391
See, my parents
were divorced 20 years ago.

91
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,402
- You got an address?
- I think my father was homeless.

92
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,370
I didn't even know myself...

93
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,739
u-until I just
came down here.

94
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:16,213
Look, um, I'm not sure
what you want me to do here.

95
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,909
I want you
to take my report.

96
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,316
Well, generally, in order
to be considered missing,

97
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,321
you need somewhere
to be missing from.

98
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,983
Fine.

99
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,390
If you're too busy
to do your job, Detective,

100
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,055
then I'll find somebody
who isn't so busy.

101
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,131
Look.

102
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,766
You wanna find your father,
take my advice: Canvas the missions,

103
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,670
ask at the shelters,
but, um,

104
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,107
get somebody who knows the city
to show you around...

105
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,644
or I'll be filling out
one of these on you.

106
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,245
Hey, you're welcome.

107
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,858
All right,
pipe down and listen up.

108
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,460
We got 12 positions this morning,
Able Seaman or better.

109
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,802
When I call your name, come into
the office, show your papers,

110
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,502
and you'll get your ship.

111
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:56,205
Here we go. First man,
Gombas, Luigi. Able Seaman.

112
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,011
- Right here.
- Walker, Steven. Second Engineer.

113
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,482
- Hi.
- Leslie, Francis R.

114
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,026
- They told me at the cafe
that you might be down here.
- Seeler, D. Master.

115
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,060
I need to talk to you
about something.

116
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:14,724
- I don't think this is a good time now.
- Walters, Nichols D.

117
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,266
- Yeah.
- Able Seaman.

118
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,768
How'd you, um,
like to work for me?

119
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,308
- I'll pay you $100 a day.
- Third Mate. Stevens, Frank G.

120
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,378
- For doing what?
- For $100, does it really matter?

121
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,141
Actually, it does.

122
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:34,081
Yeah. It does.

123
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,747
Look, I really need you
to help me find someone.

124
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,256
Jales, Bill. Cook.

125
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,193
You know this city, you obviously
can take care of yourself.

126
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:48,926
Boudreaux, C. Able Seaman.

127
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,867
I would like to
help you, darling.

128
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,235
- Looks like I'm gonna be out of town.
- Bakelman, Fats.

129
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,808
- Way out of town.
- Able Seaman.

130
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,843
Sorry.

131
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,614
Chance.
Thought you got blackballed...

132
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,688
about that thing with,
uh, Captain McDonald.

133
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,281
- That was a big misunderstanding.
- Right.

134
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,793
Broke his damn jaw
is what I heard.

135
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,730
You make sure I said
a big "hello."

136
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,961
Whoa. Wait a minute.

137
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,401
Johnson says
I was reinstated.

138
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,133
With the company.
Not with the union.

139
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,971
You owe some dues here,
boy.

140
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,604
- 217 bucks.
- I'll pay that off on this cruise.

141
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,308
No. Nobody ships out if they're
in arrears, you know that.

142
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:44,252
- How am I gonna pay my dues
if I can't get the job?
- I don't make the rules, mate.

143
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,824
Look, your ride doesn't sail
'til the end of the week.

144
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,488
If I can get the money,
then what?

145
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,792
Then I'll let you
ship out.

146
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,001
I'll get the money.

147
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,511
Keep goin'.
Take it back. Yeah.

148
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,246
Bring it, bring it,
bring it, bring it.

149
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,287
Okay, down.

150
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,378
So, this guy you're looking for,
he owes you money or something?

151
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:47,316
- He's my father.
- Okay, I change my mind.

152
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:52,186
I'll help you for two days,
you'll pay me $217.

153
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,488
It's a deal.

154
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,062
- You can drive.
- I...

155
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,098
don't have
a driver's license, ma'am.

156
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,960
So, what's your name?

157
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,039
Chance Boudreaux.
What's your name?

158
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,735
It's Nat.

159
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,777
Nat?

160
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,110
Your parents name you
for a... bug?

161
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,083
No, actually,
it's short for Natasha.

162
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,449
Natasha.

163
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,216
What kind of a name
is Chance?

164
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,623
Well, my mama took one.

165
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,355
So how did you lose
your papa?

166
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:40,094
My parents, um, they got divorced
when I was seven and my father...

167
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,639
Well, he moved away.

168
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,546
We started to write and
he even called me a couple of times.

169
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,674
Three weeks ago
the letters just stopped.

170
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,423
I've got a friend here
who can help us.

171
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,050
You check the line,
I'll look around inside.

172
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,800
Hey, you don't have
a bottle of hot sauce on ya, do ya?

173
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,102
- Elijah. What's happening?
- Hi.

174
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,110
Wednesday meat loaf.

175
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,544
I mean, they said
it was meat loaf.

176
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,448
- I thought you were gonna get a ship.
- I lost my boarding pass.

177
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,849
I've got something
to show you.

178
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,857
You two know each other?

179
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,895
- We met yesterday.
Have you seen my father?
- I saw the next best thing.

180
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,964
I was over at
Plaza D'ltalia yesterday...

181
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,091
and I saw this sleeping bag
in a cart.

182
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:48,138
It was a tiger stripe, like the kind
they used to issue to Recon guys.

183
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,538
Your daddy had one
just like it.

184
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,110
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You bet.

185
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,228
Don't be offended.
He passed them out for money.

186
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,536
Uh, yeah, I've had to
do it myself.

187
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,547
Here. Barracks Street.

188
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:09,211
Both sides this time, Grandpa.
Next! Get!

189
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:13,120
Here. Decatur. Lower half.

190
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,756
Well, if it ain't
my good friend Boudreaux.

191
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,093
I thought you was gonna
catch a ship.

192
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,894
Maybe I'll stick around
to run for mayor.

193
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,401
We're looking for someone
who worked for you.

194
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,405
The man's name
is Douglas Binder.

195
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,374
- I never heard of him.
- I think he know you.

196
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,411
- Did he work for you, sir?
- Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.

197
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,037
I'm not too good with names.

198
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,182
I have a photograph.

199
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,629
What Mr. Poe trying to say,

200
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,564
he's not too good with faces.

201
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,363
Right?

202
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:04,305
Hello, Randal.
I didn't know you had company.

203
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,454
We were just leaving.

204
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:28,263
- You know, we should go back up there.
- Not now. Not together.

205
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,301
Poe knows something
about my father, obviously.

206
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,167
If you don't want to go back
up there, I'll go myself.

207
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,867
If you want to find your daddy,
you're gonna have to work smarter,

208
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,477
not harder.

209
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,512
Yeah.

210
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,750
- Natasha Binder?
- What's the problem?

211
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,415
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

212
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,491
They found
your father's body.

213
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,552
I'm sorry.

214
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,454
- They made a positive I.D.
- How did it happen?

215
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,359
There was a fire last night in
an abandoned building in the Ninth Ward.

216
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,660
The fire department discovered
your father's body in one of the rooms.

217
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,166
I need to see him.

218
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:41,171
Your daddy was burned
pretty badly.

219
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,571
The identification had to
be made from dental charts...

220
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,373
in your father's
service record.

221
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,390
What's your
involvement here?

222
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,857
I was helping her
find her daddy.

223
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:36,556
Wakey, wakey, you fat fuck!

224
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,304
Oh, God!

225
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,533
Mr. Fouchon,
what are you doing here?

226
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,906
- Aah! Oww!
- Don't talk, Randal. Listen.

227
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,912
Oh, don't worry
about Randal.

228
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,448
- Aah!
- He's all ears.

229
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,849
When Mr. Van Cleaf came upon
your visitors yesterday,

230
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,615
you neglected to tell him
that they were inquiring...

231
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:08,819
- about one of our volunteers.
- That was nothin', Mr. Fouchon.

232
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,951
Oh, it was something,
Randal.

233
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,168
This man we hunted last night.

234
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,145
Why don't you tell us his real name?

235
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:34,048
- You fuck.
- Binder. Binder. Douglas Binder.

236
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,882
That's not the one
we selected, is it?

237
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,320
I-I couldn't get the guy
you asked for.

238
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:43,292
Look, y-you said you wanted
a combat veteran, so I sent you Binder.

239
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:47,422
- He has more medals.
- He had a family.
Now they're asking questions.

240
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,692
Please. Please.
I said I was sorry. I sai...

241
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,565
- Aah! I said I was sorry.
- Careless is what you are, Randal.

242
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,799
Careless and stupid...

243
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,965
and now you're sorry, too.

244
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,407
He said he...
He said he was alone.

245
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,845
- I didn't know he had
any relatives. Honest.
- You made a mistake?

246
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,745
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yeah. Yeah.

247
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,683
Uh-huh. And I see you're anxious
to make up for it, aren't you?

248
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,813
Yeah. Yeah, right.
Yes. Yes, sir.

249
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:16,222
We've got another client
and he's about to select a new playmate.

250
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,735
Next time send us
the one we ask for.

251
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,728
I will, Mr. Fouchon,
I swear. L...

252
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,335
I think
we understand each other.

253
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,140
- Yes? No?
- Yes. Yeah.

254
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,215
Randal.

255
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,012
I come back here,

256
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,052
I cut me a steak.

257
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,393
You did your best.

258
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,929
No, l...
I came too late.

259
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,556
I mean, Jesus, he was living
out of a shopping cart.

260
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,568
Goddamn it.

261
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,640
Why didn't he just...
tell me?

262
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,334
Why didn't he ask
for my help?

263
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:09,277
I've been there myself
on the street.

264
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,814
It's hard.

265
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,850
It's hard to...

266
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,920
put your hand out.

267
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,852
I just kept thinking
if I could...

268
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,594
just tell him
that I loved him.

269
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:30,023
And because
he loved you so much,

270
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,932
he didn't want to
pull you into it.

271
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,477
- Our friend, Mr. Boudreaux.
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,778
Silver Star.

273
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,783
Marine Force Recon.

274
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,683
He joined
the Merchant Service after he got out.

275
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,915
His captain
was smuggling opium.

276
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:55,719
When Boudreaux found out,
he threw the man overboard.

277
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,294
He's been looking
for work ever since.

278
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,921
He's obviously not someone
we should underestimate.

279
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,263
He was raised
in the bayous by his uncle.

280
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,598
I think Mr. Boudreaux...

281
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,299
would make
a very interesting quarry.

282
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:15,003
Maybe I should, uh,
pay him a visit.

283
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,046
No, no, no, no, no.

284
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,777
Send a couple of lads down there
to have a chat with him.

285
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,819
Yeah.

286
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,692
Yeah.

287
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,620
Bingo.

288
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,120
Some friendly advice, Boudreaux:
Get the fuck outta Dodge!

289
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,249
Do it today! And tell
that bitch girlfriend of yours...

290
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,260
to point her titties north
and step on the gas!

291
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,301
It's always
nice to see you.

292
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,772
You seem to have a real talent,
Mr. Boudreaux,

293
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,843
for attracting violence.

294
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,344
Does that make me
a bad person?

295
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,615
Why did you arrest me for,

296
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,345
getting beat up
without a license?

297
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:12,321
Thank you for calling me.
Oh, my God, you look awful.

298
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,789
Darling,
you hurt my feelings.

299
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,326
What we have here is a charge sheet.

300
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,920
Willfully crossing a police barrier;
that's considered Criminal Trespass.

301
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:24,195
Yes, that officer was nice enough
to mention that to me.

302
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,770
- What were you doing at the house?
- The dog tag...

303
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,305
you find in that fire?

304
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,307
They always come in twos.

305
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,537
So I went back to that place
to look for the other one.

306
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,511
Your daddy,
he didn't die in the fire.

307
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,054
- He was murdered.
- There's no evidence of that.

308
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,180
There is now.

309
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:52,456
That hole in that tag was made
by something sharp and hard.

310
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,191
And I'll bet my rent money
it was made...

311
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,166
when Binder
was still wearing it.

312
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,796
Why would somebody go through all
this trouble to kill a homeless man?

313
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,842
- Do you believe us now?
- The wheels turn slow around here.

314
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,503
- Real slow.
- But they do turn.

315
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,240
I'll order a new autopsy.

316
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,252
This'll help.

317
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,896
- You should see a doctor.
- I hate them doctors.

318
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,099
Yeah... Aah! Shit!

319
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,101
Goddamn it.

320
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,706
What? Not now.

321
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,576
So... So, you in 'Nam?

322
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,211
Yeah,
a long time ago.

323
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,415
It seems to me a man with
your obvious experience...

324
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,424
should be pullin' down
a lot more money.

325
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,961
You're gonna pay me 100 bucks
to fill out a form?

326
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,933
I'll pay you a lot more than that
if you got the experience.

327
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,933
What kind of experience?

328
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,135
Well, maybe you ain't interested.

329
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,839
Uh, no.

330
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,313
I'll fill out
the application.

331
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,112
You got any family?
Anybody to worry about you?

332
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,187
Friends?
Anything like that?

333
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,688
I got nobody.

334
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:21,004
You'll deposit
$500,000 in our account...

335
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,012
in a bank
in the Cayman Islands.

336
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,208
Do not refer to
our agreement by telex...

337
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,217
or in conversations
on the phone.

338
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,222
You'll be provided
with a guide, trackers...

339
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,622
and the weapon
of your choice.

340
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,092
Naturally, we will
dispose of the body...

341
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:42,633
and provide you with
an out-of-town, airtight alibi.

342
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,601
Don't worry, Mr. Zenan, all you
have to do is point and shoot.

343
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:58,006
Mr. Zenan has made his selection.

344
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:02,347
A black man named Roper.
Used to be in Special Forces.

345
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,478
Excellent.

346
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,023
I don't see any problem
with your choice.

347
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,649
It has always been
the privilege of the few...

348
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,660
to hunt the many.

349
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:16,096
Soldiers, policemen,
fighter pilots.

350
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,033
Men who kill for the government
do so with impunity.

351
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,229
All we do is offer
the same opportunity...

352
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,603
for private citizens
such as yourself.

353
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:28,008
- These opponents, they're volunteers?
- More or less.

354
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,876
The same government that has
made murder their sole preserve,

355
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,882
they train our targets.

356
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,215
We pride ourselves
on only hunting combat veterans,

357
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,345
men who have
the necessary skills...

358
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:42,085
- to make our hunts more interesting.
- What about the police?

359
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,026
I'm sure that they would be interested
if they were to find out.

360
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,563
Dr. Morton here
assists us...

361
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,532
with the formality
of police autopsies.

362
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,126
It's no accident
that we're in New Orleans.

363
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,798
Last year we conducted hunts
in Rio de Janeiro at Carnival,

364
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,205
Yugoslavia during
the late unpleasantness.

365
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,369
Oh, yeah.

366
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,643
You see, there's always some unhappy
little corner of the planet...

367
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,344
where we can ply our trade.

368
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,352
All right, Mr. Fouchon.

369
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:15,647
- You have a client.
- Well,

370
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,490
thank you for visiting,
Mr. Zenan.

371
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,996
Dr. Morton will
show you to the car.

372
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,794
My bank will arrange
the transfer of funds within the hour.

373
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,131
- Excellent.
- When do we go out?

374
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,832
We'll contact you when the
necessary arrangements have been made.

375
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,779
Chance. What you doing here?

376
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:45,151
- Secret mission.
- Mmmm.

377
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:49,192
Rub me, baby.

378
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,674
Oh, yeah, baby.

379
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,441
Hello, Poe.

380
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,484
What the fuck?

381
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,452
- You miss me?
- Aw, Christ, not again.

382
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,580
Looks like you're short
an ear,

383
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,386
so you better listen
very carefully.

384
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:27,123
- Now, are you paying attention?
- Uh-huh.

385
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,290
Who sent those apes
after me?

386
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,459
I don't know
what you're talking about.

387
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,696
Two million people
in this city.

388
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:39,401
- Who's gonna miss a fat
slob like you, Poe, huh?
- Van Cleaf!

389
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,410
H-His name was Van Cleaf.

390
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,503
Good boy.
Where is he?

391
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:47,072
I don't know where he lives!
He ain't even American!

392
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,017
Look, he'll... He'll kill me
if I don't do what he says!

393
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,453
You gotta believe that!
Aaah!

394
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,990
Tell your boyfriend
Van Cleaf...

395
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,528
I'm gonna find out who
killed Douglas Binder.

396
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,860
If you understand me,
just grunt.

397
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,937
Again.

398
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:23,085
Did you get my memo?

399
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,020
Binder, Douglas C.

400
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,024
I want you to take another look
at the post-mortem.

401
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,361
That memo contains evidence...

402
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:38,128
that might make
Binder's death a homicide.

403
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,432
Now, you can act on it, Doctor,
or you can file it,

404
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,236
but if I have to get a court order
for a formal inquest,

405
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,776
I will.

406
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,322
You should do something
about that cough.

407
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:08,421
Don't you ever knock?

408
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:21,505
We have a problem.
A big problem.

409
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,240
They want me to redo
the autopsy on Binder.

410
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:31,844
- Who is it that's asking?
- A detective named Mitchell.

411
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,356
Binder's family's
breathing down her neck.

412
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,786
- Can we buy her?
- No.

413
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,202
I guess we've overstayed
our welcome.

414
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,537
Tonight is our last hunt
in New Orleans.

415
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,043
Open it.

416
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,119
What a funny
little man, eh?

417
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,089
A change of scenery's what we need.
Something less tropical.

418
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,828
Rolling hills, castles.

419
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,263
Eastern Europe.
We can work there for years.

420
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,370
- Where's Poe?
- Mr. Poe couldn't make it.

421
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,374
He's got an ear infection.

422
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,412
Look, he, uh, he said
he'd have some work for me.

423
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,382
That may still be
a possibility.

424
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,217
We got a little game
we'd like you to play with us.

425
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,086
This money belt...

426
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,993
has $10,000 in it.

427
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,090
It's all yours if you want it,
every penny.

428
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,568
What do I have to do?

429
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,606
The rules of the game
are very simple.

430
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:07,336
All you have to do is get to the river.
Ten miles through the city.

431
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:11,904
You and the money belt make it
to the river, you're $10,000 richer.

432
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,916
Bullshit.

433
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,383
Maybe you like being
the object of pity,

434
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,582
begging for quarters,
sleeping in the rain,

435
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,091
listening to a half an hour
of fire and brimstone...

436
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:26,492
- for a bowl of soup.
- Man, fuck you.

437
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,758
You could change everything
tonight.

438
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:32,461
Think of what $10,000
could buy you.

439
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,800
You could get new clothes,
clean yourself up,

440
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:39,342
look men in the eyes when
you pass them on the street.

441
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:42,435
This money could
make you a man again,

442
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:45,640
instead of the shadow
of your former self.

443
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,880
- I get to the river, I get the cash.
- Every nickel.

444
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:02,058
- If I don't make it?
- Oh, you're a sports fan, Roper.

445
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,634
Figure it out.

446
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,912
You've got a five minute head start.
Don't waste it.

447
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:45,098
This is New Orleans,
Mr. Zenan,

448
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,109
not Beirut.

449
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,749
After you, sir.

450
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,181
- Mr. Zenan, take it off "safe."
- Oh.

451
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,985
Finish him.

452
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:40,955
I don't want him. H-He's wounded.

453
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,492
- Finish him.
- I can't do that. I hit him.

454
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:47,963
- I shot him. Let's go, okay?
- Listen, don't make me look bad
in front of my dogs.

455
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,965
You know why you're here?

456
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,194
You paid us a
half a million dollars...

457
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,896
to find out
if you're alive or dead.

458
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,768
Now finish him.

459
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,274
Finish him!

460
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,811
God, why didn't he
go fishing?

461
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,415
Now you understand why we
insist on payment up front.

462
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,958
Here.

463
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,886
Set the dogs on him,
won't you, Pick?

464
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,760
I don't wanna be out here
all night.

465
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:05,239
Help me!
Please! Please!

466
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,349
Help me!

467
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,784
H... Please!
Help me! Help me!

468
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,788
- Go on, get a job!
- Please!

469
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,916
- Please!
- Watch it! Damn! Watch yourself!

470
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,587
Help me. Help me!

471
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:31,133
Help me! Please!

472
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,065
Hey, look!
Come on, man!

473
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,144
- Walk on by, now, man.
- Call the police here or somethin'!

474
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,076
Help me!

475
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,482
- Hey! Hey! Let me in! Come on, man!
- No, we're closed!

476
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,553
Let me in!

477
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:53,019
Hey, buddy!
Hey! Hey! Come on!

478
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,887
- Brother, get out of here, man.
Come on, get out of here.
- Hey, come on, man!

479
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,121
- Help me!
- Hey! I ain't got no change, man!

480
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:43,797
He was passin' out flyers
for Randal Poe.

481
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,494
Let's pay him a visit.

482
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:50,331
Randal, Randal, Randal.

483
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:55,169
You were gonna leave
without saying good-bye?

484
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,932
My mama got sick in Biloxi.
L...

485
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,373
I was gonna call you,
Mr. Van Cleaf.

486
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,948
Of course you were,
Randal.

487
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,450
Of course you were.

488
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:13,956
I know you didn't mean to
hurt my feelings.

489
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,582
Hmm?

490
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,632
Looks like we missed
the party.

491
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,510
- Get down!
- Ooh!

492
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:42,439
Stay down!

493
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,829
Go! Go! Go!

494
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,370
- Let's go.
- We can't just leave her here!

495
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,516
Keep him in the Quarter.
Stay on his ass.

496
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,951
She's dead. Come on.

497
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:10,354
Grab the bar!

498
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:59,796
Yeah!

499
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:02,287
Ladies first.

500
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,298
What?

501
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,695
It appears we'll have
one last hunt after all, Pick.

502
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,426
The train went by
maybe two,

503
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:14,128
two and a half hours ago.

504
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,400
This could be dangerous.
We're on his turf now.

505
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,102
Thank you, gentlemen, for making
yourselves available on short notice.

506
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,111
We are stalking
an exceptional opponent.

507
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,446
Truly a world-class trophy.

508
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,543
The price for participating
in this little excursion...

509
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,918
is $750,000 each.

510
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,514
Should one of you be lucky
enough to bring him down,

511
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,594
I'll consider that hunter's
account paid in full.

512
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,893
Shouldn't we be worried
about alligators or something?

513
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,028
If it make you
feel better,

514
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,038
yeah.

515
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:00,573
Come on, keep going.
It's still a long way...

516
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:04,710
- to Uncle Douvee's place.
- At least they won't
be able to find us out here.

517
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:08,951
Yes, they will, if they have
a tracker as good as Uncle Douvee.

518
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,289
All they have to do
is to check along the railroad.

519
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,592
I'm just guessing
we have a couple of hours.

520
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:19,498
- Okay.
- Maybe less. Come on. Let's go.

521
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,779
Isn't there
a trail or something?

522
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,874
This is the trail.

523
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:38,579
You're really enjoying yourself,
aren't you, Chance?

524
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:43,022
If it's tough for us,
it's tough for them.

525
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,930
You trust me?

526
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,934
Of course I trust you.

527
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:57,528
Close your eyes.

528
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,599
Why do you want me to trust you
with my eyes closed?

529
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,536
Close your eyes.

530
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:41,574
- Is it dead?
- Not hardly.

531
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,551
What are you doing?

532
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,092
I'm leaving a surprise
for my friends.

533
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,241
Son of a bitch!

534
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:48,579
If you would die quieter
and pick up the pace,

535
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:51,619
Boudreaux would have less time
for these little surprises.

536
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,916
Jerome!

537
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,583
Would you be so kind?

538
01:04:56,692 --> 01:05:00,423
And do watch your step,
won't you? Let's go.

539
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:34,925
Sometime I amaze myself, me!

540
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:39,365
Is good whiskey!
Make jack rabbit slap the bear!

541
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:01,156
- Chance? Chance.
- Yeah!

542
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,623
You come to see your Uncle Douvee.

543
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:18,996
Natasha,
my Uncle Douvee.

544
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:21,576
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

545
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:28,307
We'll fix him up good.
Put bandage on, it no hurt.

546
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:33,013
- Be strong, my boy.
- Douvee, I've got some people after me.

547
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:37,218
I know.
I can smell them.

548
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:40,557
You've still got a.30-06,
the one I gave you for your birthday?

549
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,393
No. A gator ate it.

550
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,097
But, uh,

551
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,104
I've still got
your shotgun.

552
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,922
So tell me, this mans
what chase after you,

553
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:45,516
he mad at you
for business or pleasure?

554
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:49,325
- Both.
- Uh-huh.

555
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:52,924
I'm going to take Elvira south,
then to Bayou La Fouche,

556
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:54,935
Mardi Gras graveyard.

557
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:59,599
If you can talk her
into it, go ahead.

558
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,801
You be careful.

559
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,652
Don't worry about me.

560
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,653
I love the company.

561
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:22,090
Be careful.
Without you, I'm hunting them.

562
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:52,890
He's gonna be all right.

563
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:55,225
Oui. Come.

564
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:57,231
We go.

565
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:44,038
Here, drink. But do not spill.

566
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,046
It kill the grass.

567
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,778
The place is clean.
He just left.

568
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,929
Get the fuck down!

569
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,202
Hey!

570
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,032
Hold it!

571
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,338
Boudreaux is the target
we're after.

572
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:26,243
You are a fucking buffalo!

573
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:29,317
Move!

574
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:45,732
Boudreaux went this way, maybe ten,
15 minutes ago. He's on a horse.

575
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,170
He's trying to lead us
away from his friends.

576
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:54,903
Get in
the fucking trucks.

577
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,878
Move! Fucking move!
Will you move? Move!

578
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,516
They're fucking brain-dead.

579
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,553
Get the helicopter.
Find Boudreaux.

580
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:12,059
- We'll set up an ambush
this side of Bayou La Fouche.
- I can take him from the air.

581
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,255
Any pinhead can take him from the air.
I want to take him from the ground!

582
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:17,457
I can take him
from the air.

583
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:21,127
- Be a professional, Pick.
- Hey, you're making a mistake here.

584
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:25,236
Make sure
he gets there, Pick.

585
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:58,171
That's him.

586
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,904
Hey, pigeon.

587
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,528
Avril Pybus has a store
two miles this way.

588
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:51,764
You go to a telephone,
call the sheriff.

589
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,398
You know,

590
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:57,706
chére, I think you should
call the sheriff.

591
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:05,380
It appears your trophy's
ripping us a new orifice.

592
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,921
Let me review the tactical situation
for you, gentlemen.

593
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:11,582
Boudreaux is wounded.
He's been pursued and harried...

594
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,991
across miles of open country.

595
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,656
Now he's cornered
and outnumbered 20 to 1.

596
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,290
He's an annoying little
fucking insect...

597
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:22,903
and I want him
stepped on, hard.

598
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:27,898
You're not angry with me,
are you, Pick?

599
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:31,103
I don't get angry.

600
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:33,146
I'm a professional.

601
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,572
Let's move!

602
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:06,239
This is not good.

603
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:11,601
If we walk away now,
we can be in Mexico in five hours.

604
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,147
What the fuck is the matter
with you, Pick?

605
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:16,216
Hunting drunks in alleys
made you soft?

606
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:06,400
God, that son-of-a-bitch
is good!

607
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:10,494
Goddamn it, I'm gonna blow
his goddamn head off!

608
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,608
What are you lookin' at,
you sons-of-bitches?

609
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:16,677
This is what you paid for!
Get him!

610
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,518
Seal off this place.

611
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,664
The son-of-a-bitch
is mine.

612
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:34,355
Sorry about the shirt.

613
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:38,458
Give it a rest, pal.

614
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:50,464
- Now what do you want to do?
- Now...

615
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:53,938
Now we put arrow into everyone
what's not Chance, huh?

616
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,066
Come.

617
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,855
You fuckin' bitch!

618
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,389
Now...
Now look what you do.

619
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:53,660
Give me this gun.
I take care all this bad guy.

620
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,667
Give me this gun!

621
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:32,399
Chance!

622
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:03,203
- I told you to go for help.
- But we help.

623
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:06,296
All these men try to kill you.
We're here to help.

624
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,094
Boudreaux,
Boudreaux, Boudreaux.

625
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,600
I've been looking
all over for you.

626
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:20,476
- You've been looking
in the wrong places.
- That's good,

627
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,812
'cause I know you wouldn't
want to... hurt my feelings.

628
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:21,163
Can you get up?

629
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,829
I cannot dance,
but I can get up.

630
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,278
Hey!

631
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,656
Hey!

632
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:01,961
You lucky son-of-a-bitch!

633
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,699
- You want some more of that?
- Yeah!

634
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:11,512
How does it feel
to be hunted?

635
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,510
You tell me!

636
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:17,106
You should know better.

637
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:21,655
There isn't a country in the world
I haven't fired a bullet in!

638
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,456
You can't kill me!

639
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:28,756
You can't kill me!

640
01:29:33,801 --> 01:29:35,132
I'm on every battlefield!

641
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:41,300
There's no winner here!

642
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:42,808
I don't see one.

643
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,775
You're looking at him!

644
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:49,514
Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!
Take your best shot!

645
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,167
Chance!

646
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:10,170
Chance!

647
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:18,005
My boy!

648
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:33,987
Just shoot him!

649
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:38,755
You won't do that, will you,
Mr. Boudreaux?

650
01:30:38,866 --> 01:30:42,825
- Chance, please!
- If he shoots me, he'll kill you.

651
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:46,839
He's picked the wrong tool
for the job.

652
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:53,945
Put the weapon down...

653
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:57,149
or I'll run her through!

654
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,786
No!

655
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:30,213
You see, Miss Binder,

656
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,776
you I can understand;
it was a matter of family.

657
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:38,120
You had nothing in common
with those people.

658
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:41,889
What made you want to
complicate my life like this?

659
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:45,898
Poor people get bored too.

660
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:50,132
- Come here.
- Please.

661
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:59,271
Load me.

662
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:56,490
Hunting season... is over.

663
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:30,326
Douvee!

664
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:32,331
Douvee!

665
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:36,331
What is this noise?

666
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:39,304
I was dreaming.
Chére, I think about you.

667
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:43,673
I tell this turkey,
he no kill this eagle.

668
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,912
Some headache I got here!

669
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:54,178
Oh, my God.

670
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:59,349
- What?
- I think I hurt pretty bad.

671
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:07,395
Now this,
this real catastrophe!

672
01:35:07,501 --> 01:35:10,026
- This real bad.
- Yeah, real bad.

673
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:16,805
Ah, when I was just
a little boy

674
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:20,938
A-standin'
to my daddy's knee

675
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:24,984
My papa said, Son
don't let the man get ya

676
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:27,611
And do
what he done to me

677
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:32,486
Born on the bayou

678
01:35:34,428 --> 01:35:37,454
Born on the bayou

679
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:41,999
Born on the bayou
Lord, lord

680
01:36:55,075 --> 01:36:59,011
Wish I was back
on the bayou

681
01:36:59,113 --> 01:37:03,277
Rollin'
with some cajun queen

682
01:37:03,384 --> 01:37:06,820
A-wishin' I were
a fast freight train

683
01:37:06,921 --> 01:37:10,982
A-just a-chooglin'
on down to New Orleans

684
01:37:12,526 --> 01:37:15,051
Born on the bayou

685
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:20,600
Born on the bayou
Mmm, mmm, mmm

686
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:22,760
Born on the bayou

687
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:25,430
Doin' it, doin' it
doin' it, doin' it

688
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:28,638
Lord

689
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:47,526
Oh, get back now

690
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:30,630
Well, I can remember
the fourth of July

691
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:34,731
A-runnin' through
the backwood bare

692
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:38,778
And I can still hear
my ol' hound dog barkin'

693
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:41,780
Chasin' down
a hoodoo there

694
01:38:43,017 --> 01:38:45,952
Chasin' down
a hoodoo there

695
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:50,046
Born on the bayou

696
01:38:52,192 --> 01:38:56,128
Born on the bayou
Ohh, ohh

697
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:58,664
Born on the bayou

698
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:01,132
All right

699
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:03,931
Do it, do it, do it
do it

700
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,541
Mmm, ohh
