00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:12,413
This is Los Angeles,
City of Angels and

2
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:15,015
it's Christmas time, in case
that was

3
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:18,119
unclear, and our particular
story

4
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,154
concerns a young
man just discovering

5
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,823
his place in the world. It's the
story of

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,259
a family who finally
need each other

7
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:26,960
more than any of
them are willing to admit.

8
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:30,164
And it's the
tale of the Christmas

9
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:33,000
spirit made manifest
and the magic that

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,868
exists this time of
year if we just look

11
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:38,272
hard enough and believe.
It's like my dad

12
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:41,542
always told me: digging
up holes you will

13
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:46,580
eventually find a
bone.

14
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,554
Yeah, well yeah I heard Ricardo
bring it up at the

15
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,090
quarterly meeting
and you know how he

16
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:59,827
likes to talk. Yeah
I just didn't think

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,865
it would be so soon.
Yeah I was just

18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,169
hoping that we could
get through this Christmas.

19
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,705
I wanted to
prove to Riley that

20
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,942
there was a little magic left.

21
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,912
Okay, Molly, thanks for
letting me know.

22
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:23,951
[Music]

23
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,940
Come in.

24
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:57,151
I sold the company.
So all those hours

25
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,356
for Christmas or to transition

26
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,358
operations into shutting
computer

27
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:09,397
services down...I'm
out of a job.

28
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:16,737
Yeah. I always thought it
was cool you worked there.

29
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,176
Hey, don't be worried about
a thing. We're going to get
through this.

30
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,545
I'm already look for
something else and I'm
definitely going

31
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,079
to be taking those
extra shifts for the

32
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,716
next 48 hours and
we're going to do

33
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,553
something really nice
for Christmas.

34
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,722
That's ok, mom, you
know I've never really
been a

35
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:39,427
fan of Christmas
anyways, so...the magic,
it's dead.

36
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:39,760
Hey, don't say that!

37
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:45,533
Well, it's true, Mom, I've
been alone for more holidays

38
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,868
than I've been alive.
You know you've

39
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,102
always had to be the one to work

40
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,171
double-time and I
appreciate everything

41
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,007
you've done for
us, I really do but

42
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,545
Christmas is just
another day.

43
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:02,015
I don't want you to think
that way.

44
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,518
Sorry, I just really wanted
us to have a special day,
just once.

45
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:08,155
Don't worry about me, Mom.

46
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,191
I'll go over to Andy's
and on the day we'll

47
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:14,027
go grab waffles like
every other Saturday.

48
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:19,066
[laughs]
How did you get to be so
grown up?

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,905
Science works wonders.

50
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:27,608
[Music]

51
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,511
I just don't want you to think
that there's no magic.

52
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,481
Well, I stopped believing in
magic when you beat up that
mall Santa.

53
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:37,418
Hey, he was awful!

54
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,220
He wouldn't
see you, come on,

55
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,323
Santa's don't take coffee
breaks! We waited in line for

56
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,591
over an hour.

57
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,626
You know well I liked the hot
cocoa

58
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,828
afterwards at the
coffee shop way better.

59
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:52,099
- Marshmallows.
- Marshmallows make everything
gooder.

60
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:57,137
Yes they do.

61
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:09,750
[Music]

62
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,188
[Music]

63
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,636
Nope. Christmas
spirit is left the

64
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:29,837
building.

65
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,808
It was never that
good anyways.

66
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,300
Did you read all these books?

67
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,572
[Music]

68
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:11,011
- Who are you?
- I'm Hope. I'm a Christmas
spirit.

69
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:16,049
What?

70
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,454
My sisters and I
are Christmas spirits.

71
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:24,992
Faith, Mercy, Charity.
We we go around and

72
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,727
try to restore
people's belief in the

73
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,398
magic of Christmas.
people like you Riley.

74
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,966
Mom told me not
to eat a full burrito

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,903
before going to bed.

76
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,407
Yes, gives you heartburn, or
gas, or sometimes both but
that's not

77
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,340
why I'm here.

78
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:43,544
No no of course not you said the

79
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,113
Christmas spirit had
left the building,

80
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:51,151
you said and, I quote,
'the magic is dead'.

81
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,687
Do I look like I've
left the building?

82
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:58,726
And how about this
magic? Yeah, but

83
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,898
don't wake your
mother.

84
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,636
I need you to
recognize your magical

85
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,605
thoughts. I need you to
find the Christmas spirit.

86
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,609
Right, well aren't you
a Christmas spirit?

87
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:19,012
Okay, here you are.

88
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,448
Yes, good point, I was thinking a
little more figuratively with

89
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,883
a touch of abstraction...
You know what I'm

90
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,117
saying.

91
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,287
- No, not at all yeah
- I was afraid of that

92
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,525
It's like this: you
need to rediscover

93
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,928
the spirit of Christmas.
And to do that,

94
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:38,432
you have to give
it to someone else as well.

95
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,469
You mean like giving
gifts and stuff?

96
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,936
I mean I gave change to,
like, one of those

97
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,506
bell ringers downtown.
And I watched the

98
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,040
Charlie Brown
Christmas special every

99
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,042
year

100
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,278
All the knowledge
in these books and

101
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,780
that's the best you
can come up with?

102
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:56,283
So, you mean, like 'the
sharing and giving

103
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,986
of yourself and finding
fellowship in mankind'?

104
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,823
Much better! The Christmas

105
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,125
spirit isn't the same
thing for everyone.

106
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,227
You're a smart young man,

107
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,429
you'll catch on quick.

108
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:12,466
What does that mean?

109
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,837
A fortune cookie?

110
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,781
'You will discover the spirit
of Christmas and give it to
someone else.'

111
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,617
You can't be serious.

112
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,121
[Music]

113
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:40,227
Better? More serious?
Good, on the back of

114
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,998
your fortune is a
series of numbers

115
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,601
there but rules follow
them in order and

116
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,369
then follow the signs.

117
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:54,074
- What signs?
- A sign. A harbinger, a
mystic

118
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,377
symbol from the comic
cosmos or it could

119
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,080
just be an arrow
in a dirt. I have no

120
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:00,681
control over what
it will be.

121
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,583
Is this a dream?

122
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:10,190
Not a dream.
You're welcome.

123
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,492
If you don't want to do it
for yourself, do it

124
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,563
for your mother. She
still believes the

125
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,165
spirit of Christmas
but she needs you to

126
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,432
believe it as well.

127
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,935
To do that you have
to help someone you

128
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,672
don't know find it
too, even if they

129
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,474
don't necessarily
want it at first.

130
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,711
It won't be easy but
the rewards will make
up for it.

131
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,647
No, what if I can't do it? What
if I fail?

132
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,049
You won't know until you make an
effort.

133
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:41,088
Okay I'll do it

going to be at Andy's
overnight, right?

138
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:18,158
Yeah, yeah. Wow, mom
you're right about the

139
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,128
burrito thing, I had
the craziest dreams

140
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,697
last night

141
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:25,999
Did you get a job at
the mall?

142
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,301
Umm, yeah. Yeah.

143
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,238
I applied but they
wanted to see if the

144
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,806
costume fit first
in case I shrunk.

145
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,279
You look fine. Hey,
we're gonna be alright.

146
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,814
- We are.
- I know.

147
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,282
I love you.

148
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,117
I love you, too.

Wow. The spirit of
Christmas.

151
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,832
hope, the Christmas
Spirit and imagination

152
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,068
and his own spirit
of adventure and

153
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,737
found himself in
Malibu. Sun dappled

ever rains! Almost.

00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,247
Is this a place I need to
bring the Christmas
Spirit to?

158
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,349
Why am I talking to myself?
This is nutts.

159
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:29,429
'Yes, this is the place.
The Christmas Spirit is
needed here, get to work'.

00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,599
Alright, I don't know
why these

name they put on it?

'Restructuring', which is a

175

wishy-washy way of
saying soon to be out
of work.

Tom isn't normally
so stressed out and

177
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:53,513
intense but restructuring
will do that to you.

She writes books for

180
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,408
kids and kids of all
ages, but she's had

181
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,343
a bit of our writers
block recently and

182
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,645
there's nothing more
disappointing and

183
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,514
being so worried
about being an adult

184
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:31,618
forget what it's
like to be a kid.

with her family,

Great! You know

201
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,456
apparently there is
this website where

202
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,325
you can actually
look at pictures of

203
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,294
your children and
your grandchildren?

was telling
me all about it.

Well I'm sorry I
had sent you any
pictures, okay?

It's just that
we've been busy.

feel bad about this

time just got away from us
I guess.

still come out.

busy with you know the

It's not like we'd do
anything special.

213
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,962
Winnie, is there something
you want to tell me?

214
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,863
because you know
you can.

Okay don't worry
about it. I mean don't

217

don't have to spend

every holiday together.
How's Ali doing?

00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,616
Oh, um, well you know
we went through the

220
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,752
terrible twos and
then our gawky 12s,

00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:24,657
well now it's our

you at that same age.

No, thank you, please
don't.

you mean about me.

the gate speaker

broken? I have been
meaning to get that

00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,922

worked properly.

speaker's broken.

Christmas was my favorite
time of year.

266
00:18:54,501 --> 00:19:00,740
I just loved it. It's like,
you know, like we had
stockings that were

267
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:04,110
just full of toys
and on Christmas Eve

268
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,247
we got to open one
present, and my mom

269
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,616
would take the
simplest things and make

270
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,786
a feast fit for a
king I can't even boil

271
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,622

skips a generation

I guess it skips two
generations.

Yeah it all sounds
really nice. So why don't
you do it again?

recreate the family

taken care of in the

is the hard work,

to me...that much

332

about you.

333
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:16,469

00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,349
I, um, I did the art too,
but I'm not
as good at that.

350
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,619
Are you crazy? This
was like my favorite

351
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,088
book when I was a
kid. I had my mom read

352
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,724
it to me every night!

353
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:15,528
I forget; it's been ten
years since it's been out!

354
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:20,467
It's been a hard one to
top. I'm not sure what I'm
going to do next.

355
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,402
Everyone seems to have a
good idea except for me.

356
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,940
I remember every word.
it's crazy, my mom she

357
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:32,144
did the best werewolf
howl!

358
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:36,449
Well maybe she read
my other books!
'The Littlest Creature,'

359
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:40,520
'The Littlest Monster'.
Oh, and
'The Littlest Mummy.'

360
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:44,624
Oh, yeah, she read those.
But the first one of them is
kind of the best.

361
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,193
Oh yeah, I know.

362
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,260
These weren't as good.

363
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,328
No, I didn't-

364
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,731
No, no. It's just
that the publisher
wanted me to

365
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,500
keep writing them
because the first

366
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,101
one sold so well.

367
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,003
Oh, that's too bad. You
could say I got into reading
because of your books.

368
00:23:57,136 --> 00:24:01,240
Really?
That's so nice to hear.

369
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,942
Yeah you know,
now that I think
about it, it was

370
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,744
the first book I
ever read.
I read it back to my mom.

371
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,479
Makes you creative,
I guess.

372
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:10,683
Yeah I forget
that reading out

373
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:13,285
loud can spark
the creative fire.

374
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,755
Yeah, my mom, she'd
read it to me,
I read it to her

375
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,725
and we'd do all the
voices and stuff.

376
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,860
She's really good at like,
computer design and

377
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,262
stuff, and she says
I'm creative and it

378
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,864
made me want to become
a writer one day.

379
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,033
So yeah, I guess it is.

380
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,167
[knocking]

381
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:34,073
Oh hey, I just wanted
to see if you wanted

382
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,475
a cup of coffee. I
made a fresh pot. But I

383
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,177
see we have company.

384
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:41,914
Oh this is Riley.
Allison's friend.

385
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:44,116
Oh, hi Riley. I'm Tom.
Nice to meet you.

386
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,018
His mom read him
'The Littlest Werewolf'
when he was a kid

387
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,453
and now he wants
to be a writer.

388
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,857
Oh! That's...that's
great. Listen, I'm

389
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,859
gonna be working late
again so we should

390
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,293
probably plan on
ordering in. I mean

391
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,863
Oh, Honey, again?
It's almost Christmas.

392
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,666
Sorry, I don't know what
to tell you.

393
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,168
Nice seeing you Riley,
I'll tell Alison
you're here.

394
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,870
Uh, no, please don't do...

395
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,875
Hey Riley, will you do
me a favor?

396
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,109
Yeah, sure.

397
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,111
[knocking]

398
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,183
How's my little girl?

399
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,317
[sigh]

400
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:24,056
Look, we're gonna order out.
You tell your mother

401
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,558
what you want. I have
to work late again.

402
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,427
Of course you are.
Why don't you just

403
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,962
tell me when something
new happens?

404
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,198
Alli, come on,

405
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,466
this isn't easy on me
either.

406
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,835
The company's shutting
down. I have to go
through their books.

407
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,037
I've heard this song.

408
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,839
Please skip ahead.

409
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,073
[sigh]

410
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:45,377
It's just weird that I never
get to see you, and
Christmas is

411
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,046
ruined, all so you can
work on some stuff

412
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,781
for a company that's
just going to fire you

413
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:52,351
after you're
done. Nice one, dad.

414
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,455
Sweetheart, I don't
want it to be like this.

415
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:01,527
But it is. I don't want
to talk about it.

416
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,261
[sigh]

417
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,263
Fine.

418
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,700
By the way,
your friend Riley is here.

419
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,501
Who?

420
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:13,906
Your friend
Riley from school

421
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,375
I don't have any
friends from school.

422
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,213
And the moon came full and
bright, and the pack

423
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,116
ran together except
one, try as he might.

424
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,686
The littlest werewolf
was left behind,

425
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,655
the pack thinking
it was a little more

426
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,890
than a growl, but
none of them knew.

427
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,627
He had his own special
howl.

428
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:36,128
[mimicking howling.
pitifully.]

429
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,466
Come on! Let me help you.

430
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,369
[howling]

431
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,872
[howling in unison]

432
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,848
Ah, Allison! You caught
Riley and me trying to
spark our creativity.

433
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,651
Oh, did I?

434
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,452
Yes, why didn't you
tell me about him?

435
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,021
We're like two peas in
a pod!

436
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,591
Yes, Riley's
quite the pea isn't he?

437
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:11,263
We all know how I
like my Peas: Mushed.

438
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,600
Listen, do you two
want a soda because

439
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,836
I'll be right back.
And Riley it
was sooo

440
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,938
nice to meet you.
Come back anytime.

441
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:23,976
I will, Winnie.

442
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,013
Who are you, Riley?

443
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:34,386
Is that your real name?
Did Zoe put you up to this?

444
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,857
Her stupid
pranks are so stupid.

445
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,192
But this is the worst yet,
making a

446
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,428
chucklehead come
over and embarrass

447
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,130
himself with my mom.

448
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,665
Yeah, yeah she did.

449
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:47,700
You caught me.

450
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:51,470
I knew it. What was she
thinking?

451
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,475
Are you filming this?
Are you supposed to give
her the footage?

452
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:00,980
Yeah, yeah that Zoe,
what a nut!

453
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,849
Give it here.

454
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:03,950
Ummm...

455
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:12,591
She is going to be
so sorry. I am so going

456
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:16,428
to get her back, in
front of the whole school.

457
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,330
What was the end game?

458
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:22,568
What were you
supposed to do?

459
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,805
I was supposed to
make a fool of myself.

460
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,840
At least that's how
it's ending up.

461
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:32,078
Huh. Did Zoe have something
on you? Is that it?

462
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,382
Is that why you look like a
slack-jawed narcoleptic panda
right now?

463
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:41,653
Yeah, that Zoey, she
got me.

464
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:45,024
I knew it. But this is
going to backfire on
her big time.

465
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:50,062
How can I use
this? You know what
you're going to do?

466
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,201
Bring joy and happiness
into your life?

467
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:59,571
Stop being a goofball.
No, you're going to

468
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,973
pretend to be my boyfriend,

469
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:04,076
and help me drive my
parents crazy.

470
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,444
I am?

471
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:05,978
Do you want your phone back?
Or do you want me to tell

472
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,650
my mom and dad about
your little prank?

473
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,619
[sigh]
What do I have to do?

474
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:14,921
You'll stay for dinner.

475
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,891
How are you about
swearing uncontrollably?

476
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,559
Not very.

477
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,895
I don't suppose
you would be.

478
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,664
How about breaking
things?

479
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,333
Break something in here
right now.

480
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,301
You know, I'd rather not.

481
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,770
You are terrible at this
already.

482
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,472
Tell me about it.

483
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,876
Fine. Just follow my
lead when the time comes.

484
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:38,277
Here we go!

485
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:40,947
Oh, thank you.

486
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,082
Riley's gonna stay
for dinner.

487
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:47,686
Oh. Ok.

488
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,622
Um, how do you
feel about Christmas?

489
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,224
[Music]

490
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:53,559
I hate it.

491
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,066
That's what I thought.

492
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,738
Well, uh, since Allie's busy
would you like a

493
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,074
tour the house?

494
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:09,075
Sure.

495
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:10,977
Okay.

496
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:19,218
Chompy! Chompy!

497
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,525
The only dogs will
hibernate every winter.

498
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,466
[magical chime]

499
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:38,004
[Music]

500
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:38,204
Doesn't really seem
like Christmas, does it?

501
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,642
You mean like snow
and sleigh bells
and stuff?

502
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:48,680
No. More like the feeling.

503
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,918
What's your favorite
Christmas memory?

504
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:55,721
Um, well my mom
she kind of has
to work a lot and

505
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,891
she's getting laid off this
year so...

506
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,360
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

507
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,263
It's been a tough year
for everyone.

508
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,767
She did almost beat up a
mall Santa once, but I'm

509
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,070
sure that's not
what you're talking
about.

510
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,673
Your mother sounds
like an amazing woman.

511
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,143
She is, she is. I just
kind of feel like I

512
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:18,510
let her down.

513
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:20,146
Why?

514
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,082
Well she kind
of feels like you do

515
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,018
about Christmas.
About making it
magic.

516
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,521
Well, I might be
overthinking it 'cause

517
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:33,960
[mumbling]
I'm seeing a strange
fairy woman.

518
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:34,860
Excuse me?

519
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,897
Uh, never mind.

520
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,736
How about this? While
you're here, you and

521
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,605
I try to reclaim
a little Christmas

522
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,507
magic for ourselves.

523
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,179
I am definitely going to
need a little help
with Allison though.

524
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,147
Yeah, so I've
noticed.

525
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,516
I'm not so sure my
husband is going
to be open to the

526
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:58,684
prospect either.

527
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:01,020
Well, you never know
till you try.

528
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,656
Well said, Riley.

529
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,592
One down, two to go.

530
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,694
I'm sorry?

531
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:10,429
Uh, what's for dinner?

532
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,164
Good lad.

533
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:12,364
[magic sounds]

534
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,002
Would you like
something to drink?

535
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:19,071
Sweetheart, has the
gate been giving you
trouble? I can't get
it open.

536
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,873
Oh, no, but Riley
couldn't get in, he

537
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,075
had to jump the back
fence.

538
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,378
Yeah, 'cause the
gate's not working,
exactly.

539
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,181
Yeah, well these
clickers aren't
working either.

540
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:30,616
I guess I can go

541
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,551
pop the manual release.
I don't want to,

542
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:33,952
but I gotta grab
some stuff from the
office.

543
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,787
I thought we'd have
a really nice

544
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,889
meal with our guest,
right Riley?

545
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,459
Yeah, a nice family
dinner is great for
Christmas.

546
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,528
Yeah, well that's all
fine and dandy,

547
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,530
but I have a
bunch of work to do

548
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,897
before the year's
end and I have news

549
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,733
for you. If I can't
get that gate open

550
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,868
there won't be any
dinner.

551
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,037
Oh that's not good.

552
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,140
I'm pretty good with
electronic gizmos,
can I take a look?

553
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:55,141
Knock yourself out.
Hi, Sweetie.

554
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,448
What is Riley going to
do? I don't think he
should be doing

555
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,715
anything to help
anyone.

556
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,718
Well, at least he's
offering to help.

557
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,721
[distant thunder]

558
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:13,559
[metallic clattering]

559
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,727
Good one, Riley, I
would have never

560
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:17,129
thought of pressing
buttons for the gate

561
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,198
opener. You're my hero!

562
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,932
Alright, Allie, Please.

563
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,103
The manual opener's
just over there.

564
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:27,473
by the hatch
out there in the

565
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,377
downpour. Did I ever
mentioned that I don't

566
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,644
- Yes, honey.
- All the time, Dad.

567
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,713
You don't like the rain?

568
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,083
No, no, I
grew up in Florida.

569
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:38,650
I worked my way
through school
pushing

570
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,520
water from those
summer rain storms off

571
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,322
the marble entry-way
to the administration

572
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,056
building.

573
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,691
They called him Squeegee.

574
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:46,392
Ok. Ok.

575
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,230
- 'Squeegee Boy'
- Here.

576
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:55,801
That's why I moved to Southern
California! It wasn't supposed
to rain.

577
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,537
[mechanical swish]
[groan]

578
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:01,773
- Oh, honey!
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

579
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,614
Oh!
[Allison laughing]

580
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,217
I'm calling the
repair people!

581
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:15,721
What? No, no, never
mind! The lever's right
here!

582
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,290
Somewhere...

583
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:21,227
Yeah, the blind leading
the more blind.

584
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:23,929
I think Riley did
it on purpose.

585
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,731
He slammed into it
on his motorcycle or

586
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,166
something

587
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,534
You have a motorcycle?

588
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:35,040
Yeah! Tell her how we'd
ride around on it with no
helmets on.

589
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,675
That's not true, is it?

590
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:43,815
I, uh...promise to get
a helmet for it. And an
engine, too.

591
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,617
I took the bus here.

592
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,454
Ok, we'll discuss it later.

593
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:49,721
I'm going to call the
gate people.

594
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:52,724
I told you
to follow my lead

595
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,793
Yeah, sorry.

596
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,863
Do you want me to tell
them about your giant
fraud? I'm sure the police

597
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,030
can get through
that gate.

598
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:02,968
No, I'll do better. Really.

599
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,671
Here it is! Oh...
never mind, that wasn't the...

600
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:09,308
that was the
sprinkler...

601
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,044
Allie, have your mom call
the repair people.

602
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,317
Please honey. Daddy's
getting very moist here.

603
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,519
You betcha, Daddy.

604
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,090
[dialing]

605
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,063
Oh hello, is this, uh,
Spirit Gate Repair?

606
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:34,333
[female voice, via phone:]
Yes, what can I do for you?

607
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,402
What is your gate
problem?

608
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:39,938
Our gate won't open.
The clickers don't work.

609
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,474
Have you tried the manual
gate lever?
[chuckling]

610
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,043
Hello?

611
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:48,214
Oh yes, I'm sorry I'm
getting a cold. Any

612
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,016
luck with the
manually lever?

613
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,452
No, we can't even find it.

614
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:58,257
Okay let me pull up
your account here, Ms. Sims,
just hold on one second.

615
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:02,728
Oh yes I see your
problem.

616
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:02,961
What?

617
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,732
Your gate is a PBX 20.
We've been getting
a lot of

618
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,000
problems with that
model. I would not try

619
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,536
to fix it on your
own. Why, we've been

620
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,941
getting reports of
electrical issues,

621
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:20,379
small fires, real
Stephen King
type-stuff.

622
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,348
I wouldn't get any water
near the system, either.

623
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:25,984
What are we supposed
to do? We're trapped
inside our house.

624
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,087
I will send someone
out first thing

625
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,323
tomorrow. But yes, I
will just lie low for

626
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:37,028
the evening. Talk to
your family, family stuff.

627
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,231
Fine.

628
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:40,098
[beep]

629
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,605
I'm a little wet and
just so you know, this

630
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:50,141
isn't the manual
release lever.

631
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,043
[laughing]

632
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,147
Oh, he's my hero.

633
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:01,987
Oh, go on in!

634
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:03,889
Oh, it's freezing!

635
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,658
So I guess you're staying
with us tonight Riley.

636
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:09,160
Is your mom going
to be okay with that?

637
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,962
I'm sure she will be.
I'll call her.

638
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:13,532
Yeah, uh, Allie, you
wanna get the guestroom
ready please?

639
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,903
So we can have a stranger
over for Christmas but
not Grandma?

640
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,572
He's not a stranger,
he's your friend.

641
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,341
'Cause you're
too busy to care.

642
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,145
Whatever, Allison, you
know we can't afford

643
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,848
a big Christmas this
year.

644
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,450
I understand. You two
are both too wrapped
up in yourselves

645
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:35,421
to care about grandma
freezing to death in some
cabin in Michigan.

646
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:39,090
Allie, grandma lives in a
condo next to a golf

647
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,059
course and she said
it was perfectly

648
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,528
fine for her to take
Christmas off this

649
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,795
year given the
circumstance.

650
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:47,132
Take Christmas off?
Who does that?

651
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,600
Who takes Christmas off?

652
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:52,404
That's totally stupid.
But I'm glad we're

653
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:53,639
doing it because
you'd make sure this

654
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:57,275
Christmas stinks,
anyway.

655
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,945
I'll start dinner.

656
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,012
You wanna go after her?
I'll start dinner?

657
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:09,421
That was a little
awkward, wasn't it.

658
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:12,458
Yes.

659
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:16,161
Okay well I guess I'll go
start dinner.

660
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,249
Hope you like frozen
stuff. We've got a

661
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:39,585
lot of frozen stuff.

662
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:42,120
Sure, but I'm actually
pretty good at

663
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,755
making dinner because
my mom has to work

664
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,491
all the time.

665
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,559
Oh okay,
that sounds great

666
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:48,927
I'll see what you have.

667
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:50,529
Frozen stuff.

668
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,631
[plastic crinkling]

669
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:00,606
You know, uh, Allison's
grandmother lost her
husband

670
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,776
two years ago and
they moved to Hawaii

671
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:09,180
to retire, and first
we thought she'd

672
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,883
stay there or move
back here. But she

673
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:15,454
decided that she
missed the cold and up

674
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,289
and moved to Michigan
of all places.

675
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:22,528
Didn't know anyone
there, just had a gut

676
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,095
feeling that she
should start the next

677
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:25,797
chapter of her life
somewhere new.

678
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:28,700
Pretty extraordinary
woman, I'd say.

679
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:29,868
Sounds like it.

680
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:36,241
Yeah. Hey um, wondering
if you could help me with

681
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,744
something? You've
been friends with

682
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:40,078
Allison for a while
right?

683
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,781
Sure, minutes upon
minutes. Hours even.

684
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,884
Why does she
hate me so much?

685
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,187
I'm sorry, that's...that's

686
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,556
not fair to ask of you.

687
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:55,126
No, I, uh, I'm sure she
doesn't hate you,

688
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,463
You did just see
what happened,
didn't ya?

689
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,600
Y'know, man, I didn't
even realize how

690
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,235
important Christmas
was until recently.

691
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:08,039
Until very, very
recently. Now family...

692
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,340
Family's family.

693
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:10,576
Yeah.

694
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:17,315
no matter how small,
no matter how
dysfunctional, if it means

695
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,517
that much to one
person then it's worth
it.

696
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,988
I love my mom and
I wish...I wish she

697
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,791
didn't have to work
on Christmas.

698
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,762
I'm sorry. Got a little
emotional and stuff.

699
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:35,667
Don't be. You should
say that to your mother.

700
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:37,503
I'm sure she'd appreciate
it.

701
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:40,205
I will.

702
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:07,799
Hey Mom, uh, it's me Riley.
I'm at Andy's and

703
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,168
I know you're at work
and all but I just

704
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,738
wanted to say I love
you and Christmas,

705
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,873
it's going to be
special, no matter when

706
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,475
or where, so...

707
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:18,409
[beep]

708
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,548
[magical sound]

709
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:30,756
For someone who said that
the Christmas Spirit's
magic was dead, you sure are

710
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,925
doing a lot of
abracadabra.

711
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,261
Yeah, well, you're
weird.

712
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,462
I won't argue.
Keep going, my lad.

713
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,098
[magical chimes]

714
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,806
[music]

715
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,688
[footsteps]

716
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:04,990
I was looking for
Allison I thought I

717
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,091
might talk to her.

718
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,559
Well you're welcome to

719
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:11,529
try. She's in the
living room.

720
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:15,333
Oh, do you mind me
asking who Justin is?

721
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,569
Oh Justin. He's a
neighborhood
boy. He's quiet but he

722
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:18,336
seems nice.

723
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,304
Do you know him?

724
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:21,973
No. No, not yet.

725
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:26,712
Well, I'd better go help
with dinner. I hope you
like frozen food.

726
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:40,458
[magical sounds]

727
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,966
Is that your famous
catch-all stew?

728
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:54,439
Thought I'd give it a try.
It's Christmas after all.

729
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,942
Who are you, and what
have you done with my
husband?

730
00:42:56,975 --> 00:43:00,779
Okay, I deserve that

731
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:06,251
Oh, Winnie. I've taken
on too much. Allison's

732
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,760
right. I'm working
myself sick for

733
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,194
a company that's
closing and a job I

734
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,897
won't even have. None
of it'll be enough

735
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,398
to pay the mortgage.
I need to find a new job.

736
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:24,870
We'll be fine. You know,
you'll get a new job

737
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:28,640
and I'll actually
come up with a story
idea.

738
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:33,745
Oh, now you are
a great writer. And

739
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:36,147
however long it takes
you is however long it

740
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:37,515
takes you.

741
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:41,552
See? My biggest fan
is always right.

742
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:48,393
And I'm your biggest
fan, and if we just

743
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:53,498
focus on that, it we'll
be alright.

744
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:54,565
[kiss]

745
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,808
Hey, do me a favor.

746
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,210
Do not let me ruin
this Christmas

747
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,245
anymore than I already have,
ok?

748
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:12,718
We're trapped in
our own house!

749
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,619
You couldn't ruin it
anymore!

750
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,987
This is true!

751
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,157
Why don't you take a
break for tonight, ok?

752
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:22,427
You know, finish what
you have tomorrow

753
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,895
morning and then
the last part of the day

754
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,530
we'll go Christmas
shopping. And who knows,

755
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:31,669
maybe Allison will
want to come with us.

756
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:34,472
You really think so?

757
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,541
No.

758
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:41,179
Easy. Easy, easy!
There's an art to this.
[laughing]

759
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:47,418
Now, one to go.

760
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:24,790
What are you doing
here? Really?

761
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:26,224
The gate's stuck.

762
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:31,262
No, not that,
Goofball. Even if

763
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,398
someone did put you
up to this,

764
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:36,134
no normal person
would have stayed.

765
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:41,172
Well, apparently I'm not
normal.

766
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,043
You like Christmas?

767
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,912
I'm beginning to
understand

768
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:48,279
the importance of it.
How being together

769
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:55,386
is most important
thing to do no
matter what.

770
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,157
My grandma makes
the best sugar cookies.

771
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,691
With cinnamon and
nutmeg. She would

772
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:05,797
make it wherever we
were we were.

773
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:07,833
We were even on a cruise
once and she had the captain

774
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:12,103
open up the kitchen
so she could make it
for us.

775
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,040
Those cookies
are Christmas.

776
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,275
She's not making it
this year, or...?

777
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:23,314
No...she's going to make it.

778
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:31,589
Yeah, Riley, you're
right. We're gonna make
this happen!

779
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,724
Um, I didn't say anything.

780
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,962
We're going to make
this happen and

781
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:37,996
you're going to help
me.

782
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,165
[music]

783
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:41,199
Let's go, Goofball!

784
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:51,076
I want to help make dinner!

785
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,279
Me and Riley.

786
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,114
You do?

787
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,116
Yeah. Take a load off.

788
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,085
Are you sure?

789
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:01,519
We've got it covered.

790
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:06,157
Ok, then.
Sweetheart...

791
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,198
Let us know if you
need anything.

792
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:19,337
- So what are we making?
- Stew, apparently.

793
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:21,940
And trouble.

794
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:26,611
What's that?

795
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:28,980
Here you go.

796
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:31,782
Are you crazy?
This stuff's hot!

797
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,354
Really, no
kidding. Dump 'em
in the stew.

798
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:37,788
Why?!

799
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:42,127
Fine.

800
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:45,363
What does burning
your parents faces

801
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:46,631
off have to do with
your grandma ?

802
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,700
Well, my dad starts to
sneeze and gets the

803
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,202
hiccups when he eats
spicy food.

804
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:53,571
And when he's having his fit,

805
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,874
I'm going to help him.
And you're gonna take

806
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:59,410
his credit card,
pretend to be him, and

807
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:01,012
buy my grandmother
a plane ticket.

808
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:03,348
So that's your plan? To
poison your

809
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,782
father so I can commit a felony?

810
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:08,753
Well you said it
yourself: Christmas is
worth it.

811
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:13,691
I did not, ok? Christmas
is so not worth prison time.

812
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,792
You said that you

813
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,194
wanted to help the
family come together
for Christmas.

814
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,295
Not like this!

815
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:18,663
Then how?

816
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:21,766
Through wishes and dreams
and unicorns with

817
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:26,904
fluffy pancakes
on their heads.
No, Riley.

818
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:29,374
Sometimes it takes making
a hard choice,

819
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:32,110
even when it gets
you in trouble.

820
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:34,012
What about you? Why don't
you get your mom's

821
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:36,014
credit card pretend
to be her?

822
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:39,384
After the eBay
incident, my file
has been flagged.

823
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,287
I'm being tracked
24/7.

824
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,389
You have a file?!

825
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:49,027
Oh, Riley. Grandma's
cookies!

826
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,696
Can she make a filing tool?

827
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,467
I over-did it, I think.

828
00:48:56,501 --> 00:49:00,638
This is crazy, Allison.
I mean...totally crazy
taste this

829
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,941
stew's gonna
have, Allison!

830
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:04,842
Are you okay, Riley?

831
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,911
I'm great. Totally fine.
Awesome, Ms. Sims.

832
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,852
Did you put something spicy
in the stew?

833
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,754
- No.
- Yes.

834
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:21,459
Well, be careful, ok?
'Cause you know how your
dad reacts to spicy food.

835
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,095
He sneezes and hiccups,
and let me tell you

836
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:25,296
that ain't pretty.

837
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,499
Yeah, we wouldn't dream
of doing anything like
that.

838
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:31,702
Ok, let us finish up
in here. Dinner will

839
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:32,770
be ready in 30
minutes.

840
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,406
Ok, perfect.

841
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,510
You would make a
terrible criminal!

842
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:40,078
Yeah I know,

843
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:42,013
isn't that a good thing?

844
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,385
[rain]

845
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:51,756
Dinner's served.

846
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:53,224
- Oh.
- Oh! Wow!

847
00:49:58,696 --> 00:49:59,864
Here you go, Riley.

848
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:04,735
Let's get to it!

849
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:09,774
No...! Ah, I forgot the
biscuits. They're fluffy!

850
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:15,280
I'm going to go help him.
Be right back.

851
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:20,318
Can't start without
fluffy biscuits!

852
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:24,322
Do not mess this up
for me. Now you know
what you're going to do?

853
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:24,889
Well, your father

854
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:29,460
slowly suffers a
chili pepper inferno, I

855
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:32,197
sneak into his office,
steal his credit card,

856
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,265
and then call
your grandma.

857
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:35,533
You have all my
grandma's information

858
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:37,935
for the ticket, right?

859
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:41,506
Good! Now after you
put the card back,

860
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:45,076
I'll call my grandma
tell her the good news,

861
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:49,914
and look like the hero.
And you're gone by
tomorrow.

862
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,716
It's foolproof!

863
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:53,050
No, no it isn't,

864
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:55,420
actually at all! I'm
sure you thought

865
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,256
this through.

866
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,325
Just grab the biscuits,
Apron Boy.

867
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:03,361
[sigh]

868
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,065
- Wow!
- Oh, wow!

869
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,868
Okie biscuits. Ok!

870
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,805
Allie.

871
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,006
Thank you.

872
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:18,276
Smells delicious, guys.

873
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,518
I'm so proud of you.

874
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,556
There you go, Buddy.

875
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,457
Thank you.

876
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:39,029
Uh, I'd like to say a
couple things...

877
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:42,500
Um, I'm just really
glad that everything

878
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:46,671
that happened today
happened so that we

879
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:49,140
get to share this
wonderful feast

880
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:53,411
together.

881
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,512
And hail to the chefs!

882
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:55,880
Yes, here here!

883
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:01,852
Mmh! Allie and Riley,
good stuff!

884
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,928
Did you put something
spicy?

885
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:15,433
No, Honey, it's fine!
I can take a little heat.

886
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,967
[holding back a cough]

887
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:21,005
[flamenco-esque music]

888
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:22,740
Allison!

889
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:24,242
What? I told Riley to put a
little bit, and he goes all
crazy!

890
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,216
Then try some!
Both of you!

891
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:45,830
A bigger bite
than that!

892
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,768
[coughing continues
in background]

893
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,342
[breathing strangely]

894
00:52:58,443 --> 00:53:01,346
My face, my face!
My tongue...

895
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:03,080
Now go help your
father, keep him

896
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,284
moving, and I will go
make the chocolate
milkshake.

897
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:10,321
A chocolate shake is
the only thing that

898
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,389
will help him when
he gets like this.

899
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:12,257
Of course sometimes he
seizes it through

900
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,458
his nose and it can
get a little messy.

901
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:14,625
I suppose so.

902
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,573
[brief music]

903
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:47,758
Hope. Hope! I need your
help here.

904
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:48,993
[magical sound]

905
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,896
Whoah! Don't scare me
like that!

906
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:55,433
It's a small shower. I
didn't have a choice. I
got my shoes all wet
earlier.

907
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:57,835
Look, I'm in trouble.

908
00:53:57,868 --> 00:53:59,203
I think you're doing a great
job!

909
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,938
No, it's Allison, she
wants me to get her

910
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,907
grandma here tomorrow
for Christmas from

911
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,674
Michigan.

912
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,242
Well, It sounds lovely.

913
00:54:05,343 --> 00:54:09,113
Her coming here. Not Michigan
so much. I had

914
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,015
a relationship with a tree
sprite from Detroit.

915
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:13,451
It didn't
work out.

916
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:14,819
What, really?

917
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:19,424
No! There's no such thing
as tree sprites. Don't be
so daft.

918
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,626
So what's
the problem with
Grandma visiting?

919
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:22,760
It's Allison, she wants

920
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:24,495
me to steal her
dad's credit card and

921
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:25,830
buy the ticket
illegally.

922
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:27,532
I see.

923
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:29,634
I'm all for cutting corners
for the greater good, but

924
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,235
this is not quite the
way to go about it.

925
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,803
That's what I said,
but what am I

926
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:34,071
supposed to do?

927
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,773
Why didn't they have
grandma come out?

928
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,743
Uh, Winnie said something
about being busy,

929
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,277
Tom said something
about money and

930
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:42,212
Allison thinks her
parents hate her.

931
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:44,214
I don't know, they're
kind of wishy-washy

932
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:45,182
about it.

933
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,852
I see. So there's still
one member

934
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:50,721
of the family you
haven't spoken to yet.

935
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:52,056
Grandma?

936
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:54,359
what am I...what am I
supposed to do?

937
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:56,994
You going to magically
transport me to Michigan?

938
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,095
Yes.

939
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,432
I'm going to call Charles,
my flying Christmas Dragon.

940
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:06,871
Oh, you silly fool
Do you or do you not

941
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,473
have her name, address
and phone number

942
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:09,740
in your pocket?

943
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:12,142
Ah...yes...

944
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:14,412
Dial her up on
the phone.

945
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:16,246
What should I say?

946
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,516
The truth is
generally preferable

947
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,585
Yeah but she's gonna
think I'm crazy.

948
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,120
The truth often is.

949
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,992
[magical chimes]

950
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:36,834
Let's see...'Grandma'...

951
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:41,338
[buttons beeping]

952
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:49,246
[phone ringing]

953
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,114
[beep]

954
00:55:50,147 --> 00:55:51,616
Hello, this is Betty!

955
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,919
Um, Hi, this is
Riley Blackwood.

956
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:57,154
well hello, Riley
Blackwood, who are you

957
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,889
and why are you
calling me so late?

958
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:00,190
Um, well...

959
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,127
[Tom wheezing in
the background]

960
00:56:04,629 --> 00:56:06,063
Is that my son-in-law,
Tom?

961
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:06,196
Yeah, it is, Maam.

962
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:10,067
Somebody give him something
spicy to eat?

963
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:11,636
Yeah.

964
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:14,271
I give my chili an extra
kick sometimes, makes him

965
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,973
turn the most marvelous shade of

966
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:21,011
vermillion. So, revised
question: Who are you,

967
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,448
and what are you
doing at my daughter's
house?

968
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:24,549
Um, well it's kind of a

969
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:26,684
really weird story...

970
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:30,655
Riley, I've seen and heard a lot
of strange and lovely things

971
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:32,723
in my lifetime, but
at my age I don't

972
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:37,227
have time to dilly-dally
so spit it out, Son.

973
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:39,664
Uh, a Christmas
spirit named Hope

974
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:41,832
came into my bedroom
and told me to

975
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:43,601
bring the magic of
Christmas to your

976
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:48,739
family. And then she
dressed me like an elf.

977
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:51,609
I'm listening,
Riley go on...

978
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:53,978
Um, ok...

979
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,753
[uplifting music]

980
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:10,127
It's so beautiful here,
with you.

981
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:13,864
I just hope that...

982
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:17,134
Hey, don't say it.

983
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,372
Let's just stay in our
happy place together, ok?

984
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:23,641
It's been a long time.

985
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:28,546
Come on now, have I
been that bad?

986
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,881
I think we've both been
that bad.

987
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:34,652
[kiss]

988
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:37,021
Are you trying to
tell me that we should

989
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:39,056
appreciate the
smaller things in life?

990
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,858
Yes.

991
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:46,430
Okay.
[in funny voice:]
I'm a shrinking man

992
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,967
that needs love.
Love me, Winnie!

993
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:51,902

995
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:23,000
hey Utah

996
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:26,136
Hey Goofball, get up and
make me some coffee!

997
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:31,141
Where are you?

998
00:58:37,582 --> 00:58:39,784
[coffee percolating]

999
00:58:41,485 --> 00:58:43,621
What are you doing?

1000
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:45,189
I woke up early.

1001
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,793
I see that. After you
messed up yesterday
I thought

1002
00:58:48,826 --> 00:58:51,762
you'd be gone by now.

1003
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:53,530
No, I'm just gonna
make you look bad.

1004
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,201
Yeah, back off, Pal.
I'm the only one in

1005
00:58:57,234 --> 00:59:02,239
here that makes me
look bad.

1006
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:09,680
I've got to salvage stupid
Christmas somehow.

1007
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,720
[dishes clattering]

1008
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:19,890
Good morning!

1009
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:26,096
Do my eyes deceive me?
Is my daughter up and
cleaning?

1010
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:29,399
I made coffee, too

1011
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,401
Oh, Winnie, I think
that an alien may have

1012
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:33,570
taken over here.
Are you an alien?

1013
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,572
A Christmas alien, hmm?

1014
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:38,175
Hey, that's a good idea.
I've been wanting to do a
Christmas story!

1015
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:39,376
You're the alien, Dad.

1016
00:59:39,476 --> 00:59:42,246
Oh, am I? An alien, huh?

1017
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:45,916
- Oh, she's smiling!
- Ah, I saw it too, yes!

1018
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,721
Honey, I'm going to write
down that Christmas
alien idea, because

1019
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:53,257
it's really good. I'll be
right back.

1020
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,125
Thanks for the inspiration,
everyone!

1021
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:59,664
Now, is this coffee
sabotaged? If I drink
it am I gonna

1022
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:03,768
get peppers or...flying
coffee weasels out

1023
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:04,702
of my nose?

1024
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,705
No, coffees
not sabotaged.

1025
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:12,142
I mean, unless
Riley's sabotaged it...

1026
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,483
Um, Mom and I are
going to go shopping later,

1027
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:22,352
Would you like to
come? I mean we could

1028
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:28,225
get some frozen
yogurt and...
[mumbling]

1029
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:29,359
comfortable for
them maybe I'll take

1030
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:34,231
Maybe.

1031
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:35,900
'Maybe'. I'll take that. I
just have a bit of work to
finish up before I do,

1032
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,868
but I promise, it's just
a little, ok?

been in my office?
I cannot find my pen.

1039
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:41,398
So is my pen. The
silver one that
I write with.

1040
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,768
Yeah, and the mouse to my
computer and the stress

1041
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:45,402
ball that your mom
gave me that I kept

1042
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:46,136
on my desk.

1043
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:46,837
Where's our stuff?

1044
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:47,004
Good morning.

1045
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:50,875
- Hey...
- Hi...

1046
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:54,144
Did you go into my room
and take something of mine?

1047
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:57,815
Were you in my office
last night?

1048
01:01:58,248 --> 01:01:59,316
Yes I was...

1049
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,451
Where's his backpack?

1050
01:02:01,786 --> 01:02:02,920
It's in the kitchen.

1051
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,489
I think they came and
fixed the gate this
morning

1052
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:08,392
'cause it opened right
up, so...

1053
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:09,927
I knew I shouldn't
have trusted you.

1054
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:12,396
Trusted him about what?

1055
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:16,033
Umm...

1056
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,536
I might have had
him use Dad's credit card.

1057
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:20,570
What?!

1058
01:02:22,006 --> 01:02:24,041
I didn't, I didn't, I swear.
I worked it all out with
Grandma Betty.

1059
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:26,743
You talked to my mother?

1060
01:02:27,644 --> 01:02:29,646
Where's our stuff?

1061
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:33,050
Now you stop it, young lady.
Ok? You're in enough
trouble already.

1062
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,952
Riley I think it's
best if you go yeah

1063
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:38,956
Yeah, yeah. Um, sorry.

1064
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,832
What? He wasn't
my friend!

1065
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:56,874
I was just trying to
have a good Christmas.
Why is that so bad?

1066
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:58,843
Look you're gonna
have to call the
credit card

1067
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,344
company to find out
what they did with

1068
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:01,979
it, and then cancel
the card.

1069
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:03,814
Yeah. You'd better check on
yours as well.

1070
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:04,849
Ok.

1071
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:08,485
[magical sounds]

1072
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:12,122
Sorry, I really messed this up.

1073
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:16,293
No, not at all Riley.
You did great.

1074
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:17,594
How can you call that great?

1075
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:21,165
You believed, Riley.
Your selfless and

1076
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:23,800
thoughtful, and you
took a chance on hope

1077
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:25,369
and faith and
something bigger than

1078
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:26,536
yourself!

1079
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,572
If that doesn't
prove that you have the

1080
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,607
Christmas spirit
in your heart, than I

1081
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,775
don't know what
does.

1082
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,445
But it all got ruined! I'm
probably gonna go to jail!

1083
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:38,148
No, Riley. You may not
think you now, but

1084
01:03:38,182 --> 01:03:40,684
you've given them a
gift one that maybe

1085
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:43,253
they don't appreciate
at the moment but

1086
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:46,423
they will. And I hope you do,
too

1087
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:51,228
You're a special
man, Riley. Don't forget it.

1088
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:51,461
[magical sounds]

1089
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:00,670
[contemplative music]

1090
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:03,107
Well, no one use my card.

1091
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:08,145
Mine either.
Alison, get down here!

1092
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:10,147
I didn't do anything!

1093
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,015
No, of course not.
And you never got

1094
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:14,584
banned from the
internet, either.

1095
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:15,752
You're never gonna let me
forget about that.

1096
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,321
Actually I'm not.

1097
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,822
Alright, alright. Alli...

1098
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,157
I need to know what
you had Riley do

1099
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,058
with my card.

1100
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:21,892
Stop yelling at m-

1101
01:04:21,926 --> 01:04:22,927
I'm not yelling at you!

1102
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,794
I just need to know
what Riley did with my
card!

1103
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:25,662
[knocking]

1104
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:27,965
- Are you serious?
- Look, you need to
listen to your father.

1105
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:29,266
Hi, it's your Grandma Betty!

1106
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:30,300
Hi Tommy!

1107
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:31,235
...Hi...

1108
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:31,335
Hello!

1109
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:36,106
What, would somebody like
to take my bag before

1110
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,708
the old lady's arm
falls off?

1111
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:39,376
Oh, my baby!

1112
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:41,445
What are you doing here?!

1113
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:44,014
Merry Christmas to you,
too, dear.

1114
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:48,852
Now if you'd all like to
stop

1115
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,054
being quite so shouty
with each other we

1116
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:52,022
can get down to
business, okay? First

1117
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:53,257
things first,

1118
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,426
where's Riley?

1119
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,227
Uh oh.

1120
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,231
The look!
Uh, let's sit down

1121
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:06,270
you tell me all
about it, okay?

1122
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:10,874
So you sent the boy off
thinking that he had

1123
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,910
literally stolen
your Christmas.

1124
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:16,546
Uh...yeah...?

1125
01:05:17,982 --> 01:05:19,049
Is that bad?

1126
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,618
Let me read to you from your

1127
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:25,355
Christmas letter this year.

1128
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:29,026
'Tom is working to
ensure the smooth

1129
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:32,096
transition of the
company's assets.

1130
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:34,531
We hope his loyalty will
lead to a new and

1131
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:37,101
exciting opportunity
in the new year.'

1132
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:39,136
Is this a holiday
greeting or a press
release?

1133
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:42,706
'Winnie is
considering several

1134
01:05:42,739 --> 01:05:46,343
options for her
next book.' I seem to

1135
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:48,378
recall that sentence
in previous holiday

1136
01:05:48,412 --> 01:05:50,780
letters. It's an oldie
but a goodie for

1137
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:53,483
sure. Really, can
you call yourself a

1138
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:54,684
writer? I mean can't
you even pretend

1139
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:56,453
that something
exciting happened this

1140
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:57,787
year? With all the
stories in the world

1141
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,324
you got writer's block?
Winnie!

1142
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:02,626
I actually came up with an idea
today.

1143
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,962
An Alien Christmas.

1144
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:10,067
Ok. 'Alison is finding school

1145
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,336
challenging and is
looking forward to

1146
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:15,472
new challenges.' Really, Alli,
have you

1147
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:16,906
challenged yourself
at all this year?

1148
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,942
I was the one who got
you here.

1149
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,779
What? No, no, no. You
did nothing of the sort.
I paid my own way

1150
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,913
here, honey.

1151
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:24,881
You did?

1152
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:26,183
Yeah.

1153
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,351
But Riley...

1154
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:32,122
No, Riley did nothing
except to tell an old
lady that

1155
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:34,391
her family loves her
very much but they

1156
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,726
were oblivious to
the notion that she

1157
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,295
might want to come and visit and

1158
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,964
actually pay her own
way, even if there

1159
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,333
wasn't some big crazy
shindig going on.

1160
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:46,203
And then when
Riley told me about

1161
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:50,074
Allison's nefarious
little plan I told

1162
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:51,741
him not to worry, that
I would come here

1163
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,745
and set my family
straight. I really was

1164
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:56,946
hoping to meet him.

1165
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,883
Yeah, well about
that Riley...

1166
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:05,722
He stole our stuff...
maybe...

1167
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,092
Uh huh. Ok,
if you'll excuse me

1168
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:10,560
with all the excitement
and traveling

1169
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:12,662
and everything I'd
like to use the facilities.

1170
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,799
Allison, why don't
you bring your

1171
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:20,837
Grandma to her room?

1172
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:22,972
What do you want
Santa to bring you
this year?

1173
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:34,618
Well, if Riley didn't take
our stuff, who did?

1174
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:37,187
What's that?

1175
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:38,021
What?

1176
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:40,490
On Choppy's bed.

1177
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:48,698
- That looks like the stress
ball from your desk.
- It sure does. It is.

1178
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:53,770
Hey, here's the remote
for the guestroom TV.

1179
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:58,007
Chompy must have stolen
these things.

1180
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:00,744
Do you think he has
another place that
he puts his toys?

1181
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:04,914
I don't know. Chompy!
Chompy!

1182
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:12,256
Chompy! Chopmy!
[whistling]
Where is that dog?

1183
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:14,124
What?

1184
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:18,295
He may be our Christmas
thief. Dad found some of
the missing things in his
toy basket.

1185
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,266
Chompy's pretty OCD
about his toys.

1186
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:23,500
Exactly. Let's go.

1187
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:26,903
- Chompy!
- Chompy! Chomps!

[music continues]

1190
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,746
Chompy! Chompy!

1191
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:16,052
Chompy! Chomps?

1192
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:20,657
Where are you, boy?

1193
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:25,128
Chompy...

1194
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:29,899
[sigh]

1195
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:34,304
Chompy?!

1196
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:37,607
Chompy!

1197
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:46,916
Chompy!

1198
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:50,287
Come here!
[whistling]

1199
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:03,967
Win, anything? Allison?

1200
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:09,606
Tom, the firepit! Chompy
loves to sleep by the firepit!

1201
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:15,044
I found some of his
chew toys there!

1202
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,347
[in unison]:
You have to go out in
the rain again.

1203

[muttering]
Stupid dog...

1204
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:29,359
You think our stuff is out
there?

1205
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:30,994
I hope so.

1206
01:10:33,096 --> 01:10:34,398
Oh!
[clapping]

1207
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:41,004
Here you go.
And that's for you.

1208
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:44,974
'Chompy: The Dog Who
Stole Christmas.'

1209
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,744
Wow, that's good

1210
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:51,047
I'm totally stealing that.

1211
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,352
Mom, that was your idea. You
just came up with that.

1212
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:58,221
Oh.
[laughing]
Wow.

1213
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:00,089
- Allison.
- Justin?!

1214
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:08,332
- Hi.
- Um, I just wanted to come over
and say thanks.

1215
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,800
Thanks? For what?

1216
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:16,840
That's my scarf! I
mean, your scarf! What?

1217
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:21,411
Yeah, your cousin
brought it over
this morning.

1218
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:22,646
My cousin?

1219
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:24,714
Yeah, Riley?

1220
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:29,653
Riley? Oh right ,

1221
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:33,657
Riley, my cousin.

1222
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,325
Yeah, yeah, you know he

1223
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,395
brought it over. He
said that you've been
meaning to give it to me.

1224
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:41,631
Yes, I've been meaning
to give it you.

1225
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:43,099
But, you know, I'm sure
you've

1226
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,468
probably been busy
helping your parents

1227
01:11:44,501 --> 01:11:46,336
with Christmas stuff, and...

1228
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:47,371
What? Yeah, yeah

1229
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:48,271
[coughing, forcefully]

1230
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:56,212
Yeah, yeah, I've been helping
my parents prepare for
Christmas.

1231
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,382
Did you know she
liked Justin?

1232
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:03,420
No, but I'm guessing
that she wanted to tell us
except we were a little too
busy.

1233
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:05,755
You're right. Let's not
do that again.

1234
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:11,528
Don't mind them.
Please, don't mind them.

1235
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:15,632
They seem like
they're having a good
time.

1236
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:16,766
But you know,
that’s, uh, that's

1237
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,203
really cool that
you like Christmas.

1238
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:21,771
I love Christmas

1239
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:23,306
I love Christmas, too.

1240
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:28,077
You should come
over later with your folks.

1241
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:31,915
My grandma's here and
we're gonna have a big
meal.

1242
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:35,284
We're gonna have a big
Christmas Eve meal, right?

1243
01:12:35,318 --> 01:12:38,388
Uh, yes actually, I
was just about to

1244
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:40,323
alert the royal chef
to begin deboning

1245
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:44,494
the pheasant. Figgy
pudding for all.

1246
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:45,862
Well, you know what? My
parents are going to

1247
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:47,831
some like business
dinner thing, so I

1248
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:53,002
think it'll just
be me if that's alright.

1249
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,538
Uh, that's fine.

1250
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:56,806
Totally fine.

1251
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:59,676
Well, good.
I'll see you tonight.

1252
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:02,646
Oh, and thank you,
again.

1253
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:10,119
[whistful sigh]

1254
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:13,457
That's Justin.

1255
01:13:13,757 --> 01:13:15,559
We know, sweetheart.
He's lived

1256
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:16,760
here as long as we have.

1257
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,596
Riley gave him the
scarf that I was going

1258
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:21,565
to give to him.

1259
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:23,099
Uh huh?

1260
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,368
Riley is actually
an ok guy.

1261
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,170
And?

1262
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:31,140
And you totally misjudged
him.

1263
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,443
What? I don't think I caught
that.

1264
01:13:33,477 --> 01:13:37,413
Okay, I totally misjudged
him.

1265
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:40,817
What, what I can't hear
what you're saying!

1266
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:44,654
- No, no group hug!
- Yes, group hug!

1267
01:13:44,688 --> 01:13:46,022
[inaudible teasing,
laughter]

1268
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:46,523
Ok, ok fine. I am an awful
person and I owe Riley a big
apology.

1269
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,603
Well I don't know
how all this came

1270
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,605
about, but I'm sure
not complaining.

1271
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:05,809
I know Christmas
magic when I see it.

1272
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:10,714
Chompy! Where have
you been?

1273
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:11,948
Chompy!

1274
01:14:13,049 --> 01:14:13,917
[laughing]

1275
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:16,720
Committing felonies in his
sleep apparently.

1276
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,024
Well, now before we begin
this big Christmas

1277
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:23,860
meal, there's one
thing we have to do:

1278
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:26,195
Call Riley!

1279
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:27,897
Yes, absolutely. Allie?

1280
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,099
What?

1281
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,402
Call Riley and invite him over
so we can make up for
everything.

1282
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:33,837
And his mom, too!

1283
01:14:34,538 --> 01:14:37,206
How? I don't have
his number.

1284
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,942
But he's your friend.

1285
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:43,212
Uh, about that.
I, uh...

1286
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:47,684
Wait, I stole his phone!

1287
01:14:48,752 --> 01:14:51,855
That is the only time in
my life I'm happy to hear
those words!

1288
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:53,456
I'm telling you, the kitchen is
closed until I know

1289
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,824
Riley's on his way.

1290
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:56,292
Don't worry mom, we're on the
case.

1291
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:59,362
Apparently it's not a
Sims family Christmas without
a little

1292
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:01,865
mystery and daring do,
would it?

1293
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:06,670
Okay we should call
his mom, first. What's?
her name?

1294
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:13,209
Sarah Blackwood.
What? I talked to him.
I listened.

1295
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,311
Some people
still do that.

1296
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,114
He said his mom was
working through Christmas.

1297
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:20,483
Her company
is closing down.

1298
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:24,220
Ah, there's a lot of
that going around now.

1299
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:26,723
Wow, there is a lot of
that going around!

1300
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:28,758
Look where she works!

1301
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:30,860
Wahoo Toys?

1302
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:32,996
That's where you work.

1303
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:36,866
Yeah, which means
I've been helping to

1304
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:40,103
put her out of a
job faster. And more

1305
01:15:40,136 --> 01:15:43,372
efficiently, too. And
look at the extension.

1306
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:45,809
This is computer
services. They've been
working

1307
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:48,477
double-time transferring
data.

1308
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:50,580
Well, then maybe she should
report personally to

1309
01:15:50,614 --> 01:15:52,882
the VP of Accounts
for a status update.

1310
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:54,884
No, no, no. I can't
do that.

1311
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:58,154
Uh, good luck eating
your shoes tonight, Hun.

1312
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:01,090
Oh, look, if you
can't pull rank now,

1313
01:16:01,124 --> 01:16:02,525
when can you pull
rank?

1314
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:05,795
[sigh]

1315
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:07,330
[beep]

1316
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:12,802
Yes, hi, this is

1317
01:16:12,836 --> 01:16:15,104
Tom Sims. Um, can you
connect me with a

1318
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:20,143
Ricardo in computer
services please?

1319
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:28,317
Hi Ricardo, Tom Sims.
Yeah, fine, fine. How

1320
01:16:29,452 --> 01:16:33,522
are you doing? Yeah,
yeah, yes they do grow

1321
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:37,727
up fast don't they?

1322
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:39,763
Listen, listen, Ricardo
I need you to get

1323
01:16:39,796 --> 01:16:43,532
Sarah Blackwood to
my house tonight.

1324
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:48,104
I'm aware of that, but she,
she has some, uh...

1325
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:51,240
she has vital information
that I need to

1326
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:54,744
reconcile with
accounting. I know it's

1327
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:56,112
Christmas but I want
you to requisition

1328
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:59,615
for a car, and a
nice one, and make sure

1329
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:04,587
that they pick up
her son Riley, too.

1330
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,724
He's totally checking with
corporate.

1331
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:08,825
Put your foot down!

1332
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:08,958
I will, shh, shh!

1333
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:13,496
Ricardo, listen to me.

1334
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:15,398
I know you're on the
other line trying

1335
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:16,933
to get authorization
from corporate, but

1336
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,668
as far as I can tell
I'm the only person

1337
01:17:18,702 --> 01:17:20,670
in corporate working
their butt off on

1338
01:17:20,704 --> 01:17:22,706
the holiday so I
would appreciate it if

1339
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:27,744
you ensure that I get...
yes I will.

1340
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:36,285
Six o'clock would be
fine. Yes, thank you
so much.

1341
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:39,956
Merry Christmas to you
Cicardo...

1342
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:44,994
Uh, Ricardo.

1343
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,430
Wow, Dad. That was awesome.

1344
01:17:48,031 --> 01:17:52,535
Awesome. Awesome Dad.
I could get used to that.

1345
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,739
Okay, it's off to the market

1346
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:57,440
I need supplies!

1347
01:17:57,573 --> 01:18:02,578
[Music]

1348
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:22,331
Come in! Grandma is just
finishing up dinner.

1349
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,935
The best one you'll
ever have.

1350
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:28,838
Hi, Tom Sims,
Wahoo Toys,

1351
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,506
VP account services.
Well for the next

1352
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,742
eight to ten days.
Anyhow, you must be Sarah.

1353
01:18:32,776 --> 01:18:34,978
Yes. Yes I know who you are

1354
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:37,480
This is my beautiful
wife Winnie.

1355
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:38,815
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1356
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:40,316
Our neighbor, Justin

1357
01:18:40,349 --> 01:18:41,350
Hi, how're you doing?

1358
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,352
I believe you met our lovely
daughter, Allison.

1359
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:45,889
So, are we not going
to reconcile the

1360
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:46,923
accounts data?

1361
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:51,060
That just sound so
un-Christmassy, don't
you think?

1362
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,930
I say we jump into the
festivities instead.

1363
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:58,234
But before we do, I
just wanted to tell
you that you have a

1364
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:02,071
really great son, and
I'm sorry it took us

1365
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:04,540
all so long to notice.

1366
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,909
No worries here.

1367
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,913
So, Riley, how how do
you know the Sims?

1368
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:13,316
What exactly are you up to?

1369
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:15,018
That's kind of a long story

1370
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:17,620
Yes it is! And if you
come into the dining

1371
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:21,991
room I'll tell you
all about it.

1372
01:19:22,025 --> 01:19:24,093
I wanted to sit
next to Justin.

1373
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:35,939
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1374
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:38,574
- Sarah, welcome Dear.
- Thank you.

1375
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:39,976
Riley, hi, I'm Betty.

1376
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:41,377
Right.

1377
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:44,213
I really enjoyed our
conversation last night
and I'd like to speak to

1378
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:47,716
you again later on so
don't forget, ok?

1379
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,085
I won't forget.

1380
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,454
Dinner in ten minutes
everybody! I hope
you're hungry!

1381
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:54,090
One sec,
I just want to say

1382
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:59,128
a quick toast. To
family and to friends,

1383
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:09,205
may the Christmas spirit
warm us all.

1384
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:10,406
Cheers!

1385
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:14,577
- Thank you for coming
- Thanks for having me.

1386
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:17,680
Merry Christmas!
Mom, let me help you in
the kitchen.

[footsteps]

1389
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:46,475
Hi. Well, how did you
like your dinner?

1390
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,545
Oh, it was the best
I've ever had. Really.
I'm stuffed!

1391
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,314
[magical chimes]

1392
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,050
Oh, that's good. But I
have some cookies

1393
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,219
baking in the oven
right now so I hope

1394
01:20:56,252 --> 01:20:58,054
you saved a little
room.

1395
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:01,190
Sounds great.

1396
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:02,992
You know, when we talked
last night you were

1397
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:07,596
honest about Hope,
the Christmas spirit
that you said you saw.

1398
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:08,631
Yeah.

1399
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:12,568
Well I wasn't completely
honest with you.

1400
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:13,702
How's that?

1401
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:15,104
My husband
Lawrence passed away a

1402
01:21:15,138 --> 01:21:18,641
few years back and
he was the love of my
life.

1403
01:21:18,674 --> 01:21:20,243
I'm sorry to hear
about that

1404
01:21:20,276 --> 01:21:22,011
But we never would
have met that weren't
for a

1405
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:24,547
Christmas spirit by
the name of Faith.

1406
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,050
Wait, you saw a
Christmas
spirit, too?

1407
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:29,986
I didn't. He did. And
for years he
would tell the

1408
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:33,556
story about how Faith
cajoled him into

1409
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:35,925
going to this holiday
formal where we

1410
01:21:35,959 --> 01:21:38,861
met and had our
first dance. And even

1411
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,429
though it was a
blizzard and he had to

1412
01:21:40,463 --> 01:21:43,666
drive a snowplow, he
made it for the last

1413
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:47,036
dance, and his bow
tie was peeking out

1414
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:51,340
from under his
parka. And, I mean all

1415
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:53,909
those years I just
figured it was his

1416
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:55,945
imaginative way of
telling me that he

1417
01:21:55,979 --> 01:21:59,548
loved me. But last
night, Riley, you made

1418
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:01,050
me realize that he'd
been telling the

1419
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:05,254
truth all along. And
it just made me love

1420
01:22:05,288 --> 01:22:07,523
him all the more.

1421
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:09,892
So I really have to
thank you, Honey, for

1422
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,295
giving me that.

1423
01:22:12,328 --> 01:22:13,396
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

1424
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:18,434
I better go check on
those cookies.

1425
01:22:21,704 --> 01:22:22,871
Yes.

1426
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:32,648
Riley? Hey, so I was just
talking with Tom and

1427
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:35,651
Winnie...And it seems
like they want to

1428
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:37,853
start their own toy
company based on

1429
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:41,090
Winnie's books, and a
little birdie told

1430
01:22:41,124 --> 01:22:44,060
them that I'm a real
creative asset to

1431
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:48,097
any company and
apparently I have this

1432
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:53,136
world-class werewolf
howl. Ok, I've

1433
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,804
only met Tom a
couple times at the

1434
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:58,041
company and you don't
go to school with Allison.

1435
01:22:58,074 --> 01:23:03,079
So how did
you get here?

1436
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:07,816
Well, I wanted us to share
something special for

1437
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,952
Christmas, and I
wanted a little bit of

1438
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,655
magic to believe in.

1439
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,659
You're not gonna
tell me are you?

1440
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:19,628
No, I'm not, but I will
write a story about

1441
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:24,667
it one day I promise.

1442
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:26,869
Open it.

1443
01:23:39,382 --> 01:23:42,818
'May you both believe
in Hope.

1444
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,921
Merry Christmas
Sarah and Riley.'

[musical chimes]

1447
01:23:59,668 --> 01:24:02,238
So you may have
figured out I didn't

1448
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:04,807
actually steal
Christmas. I just helped

1449
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,110
Hope work her magic a little
and,

1450
01:24:07,143 --> 01:24:09,645
contrary to Tom's
lack of pronoun

1451
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:12,515
precision, I am a
patient Dame who may

1452
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:16,985
love her naps, but I
love my family more!

1453
01:24:17,019 --> 01:24:19,822
'Chompy the Dog Who
Stole Christmas' was

1454
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:22,091
whinnies next book
and it was a great

1455
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:25,194
success. Because of
it Tom and Winnie

1456
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:28,364
kept their house. The
Sims toy company

1457
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:30,999
made a Chompy dog
stuffed animal, that

1458
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:32,501
became the first
success for the new

1459
01:24:32,535 --> 01:24:34,770
company. I'd like to
think it was because

1460
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:37,140
Sarah made sure it
captured my quiet

1461
01:24:37,173 --> 01:24:42,044
dignity, if I do say
so myself. And Reilly?

1462
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,513
He went on to write
his own stories.

1463
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:47,416
Stories full of
fantasy and wonder, and

1464
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:52,955
an unshakable belief
in the spirit of Christmas.
