1
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:05,904
(Multicom jingle)

2
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:16,796
(fire crackling)

3
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:51,431
(mysterious Celtic music)

4
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,799
- [Narrator] In the dark ages,

5
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,641
an evil knight would roam the highlands.

6
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:59,946
Sorcerers they were,

7
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:04,113
pledged to wipe out of every
trace of good magic on Earth.

8
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:16,497
Dragons were the most magical
creatures that ever lived.

9
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:18,987
They were a benefit to humankind,

10
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:21,371
but the Dark Knighthood
wiped out their clans,

11
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:23,721
stole their treasures,

12
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:27,888
and used their precious blood
for their own black sorceries.

13
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,678
(roaring)

14
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:48,008
(ground rumbling)

15
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:50,710
So it was that the Dark Knight MacClain

16
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,394
slew the last of the great dragons

17
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:57,561
and desecrated it's blood
to the powers of darkness.

18
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:02,352
But in the silence that followed,

19
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:05,019
he heard a cry, like a wee babe.

20
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,220
He followed the sound deep into the cavern

21
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,303
and there he found a wee baby dragon.

22
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:22,622
So sad and helpless it was,

23
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,569
it could melt the heart
of anyone who saw it.

24
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:45,246
But MacClain was no ordinary mortal.

25
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:48,284
He took the wee one,
the last of the dragons,

26
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:49,762
to the Giant Stone to spill

27
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,845
it's innocent blood on sacred ground.

28
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,315
That ground belonged to the fey folk,

29
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:15,986
who spirited the dragon off

30
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:18,903
to the safety of the Elven kingdom.

31
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:24,860
And imprisoned the Dark Knight MacClain

32
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,610
forever after in the Giant Stone.

33
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,322
Centuries passed.

34
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:37,405
The age of magic gave way
to the age of machines.

35
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:41,289
An orphan boy came to the highlands

36
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,829
to live with a grandfather he'd never met

37
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:46,765
at the castle of his forefathers.

38
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:48,045
- Four fathers?

39
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:50,012
Nobody has four fathers.

40
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:51,073
(bagpipe music)

41
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:53,897
- [Narrator] He was the
last of the McGowin clan.

42
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:56,066
Strong and proud.

43
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:58,066
He wished for a friend.

44
00:05:00,753 --> 00:05:02,999
And his wish was answered!
(yowling)

45
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:07,239
he was chosen by the fairy folk
to raise the orphan dragon,

46
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:10,906
to see that it grows
up in harmony with man.

47
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:16,582
It's a great responsibility for a wee lad.

48
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:20,665
But the fairy folk are
canny judges of character.

49
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,797
(upbeat traditional music)
(yelling)

50
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,215
- Back you vikings!

51
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:34,048
You'll never take Captain McGowan!

52
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,043
Yowler, they're getting the best of me!

53
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:39,210
(yowling)

54
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,949
Take that you scoundrel!

55
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:01,155
Yowler, look what you've done!

56
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:01,988
Bad boy!

57
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,644
Yowler, get off of me!

58
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:08,894
Come on Yowler.

59
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:12,016
Yowler, have you gone mad?

60
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:12,933
Yowler, no!

61
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:17,575
- What in the blue
blazes is going on here?

62
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,426
Shame on you young lad.

63
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:26,225
Give me that, you'll break it.

64
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:27,142
Help, help!

65
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:29,954
Help, help!

66
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:35,317
Oh help!

67
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:38,779
- That's enough now Yowler.

68
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,529
- Come on, up you go.

69
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,013
You all right, lad?

70
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:46,835
You naughty reptile Yowler.

71
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:48,626
Misbehaving like that.

72
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:51,223
(yowling)

73
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,568
Did you see what he did now?

74
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:55,900
- It takes two to start a ruckus.

75
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,527
(yowling)

76
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:00,503
- Don't you sass me like that!

77
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,317
Go on, away with ya.

78
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:04,094
- It was only a game Yowler.

79
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:06,888
You didn't have to break my sword.

80
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:09,392
- Swordplay is no game for a dragon, lad.

81
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:11,973
It brings forth memories of darker days.

82
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,223
All now Yowler.

83
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:16,168
- I'm sorry Yowler.

84
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:17,997
- Remember lad, in dragon years,

85
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:20,488
he's like a three year old child.

86
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,654
He needs to learn gentleness.

87
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:24,075
Not fighting.

88
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,235
- That's right!

89
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:28,818
Now the both of ya,
you just straighten up!

90
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:31,863
- He's still a pup lad.

91
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:35,946
You've got to protect him
from the outside world.

92
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,415
- I apologize Yowler.

93
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:41,993
Do you forgive me or not?

94
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:44,841
(growling)

95
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,746
- Go down to the old jalopy lad.

96
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,544
You'll find a surprise there.

97
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:49,860
- Yes sir!

98
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,242
Let's go Yowler.
(yowling)

99
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:53,409
Suit yourself.

100
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,711
Come on Yowler!

101
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:02,548
I'm sorry, okay?

102
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,239
- Don't hold a grudge Yowler.

103
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,243
Scat!

104
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:08,493
(upbeat Celtic music)

105
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:31,554
- Candy, a whole bag ful!

106
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:34,471
Hold on Yowler, I'll give you some.

107
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,658
- Any mail in town for me?

108
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:39,167
- No.

109
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,285
- What's that in your hand?

110
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:44,464
Is that another warning from the tax man?

111
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,186
(grumbles)

112
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:48,357
- The Department of Child Welfare.

113
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:50,920
They say we've got to
put Johnny in school.

114
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,350
Or they're going to send someone
out here to investigate us.

115
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,017
- The devil you say?

116
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,433
It's not a bad idea though.

117
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:02,156
A little schooling never hurt a soul.

118
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,202
- The lad can read and write,

119
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,929
and figure numbers better than most.

120
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:07,647
I could teach him
everything he needs to know.

121
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,507
- Angus McGowan, you'd
better watch your step,

122
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,661
or they're gonna lock you up.

123
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:14,937
- That's not the half of it.

124
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:18,141
They say he'll have to see
a doctor every sixth months.

125
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,350
- A doctor?

126
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,985
What the devil for?

127
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:23,103
The lad hasn't been ill in years.

128
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,536
Between my cooking and my medicinal herbs,

129
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:27,536
he's as fit as a fiddle!

130
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:30,539
The nerve of these city folk,

131
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,008
trying to push their ways on us.

132
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:37,175
- They can't tell me what to
do with my own flesh and blood.

133
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,130
This is no ordinary family.

134
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:48,674
They want education, I'll
give the lad a real education.

135
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:52,779
- Catch this one Yowler.

136
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,813
All right!

137
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:56,286
Okay here's another one.

138
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,671
Oh, good boy!

139
00:09:57,671 --> 00:09:59,327
That's enough Yowler.

140
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:01,689
Too much candy will rot your teth.

141
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:04,497
- Come along lad, I'm gonna
teach you a thing or two.

142
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:05,727
- Yes sir.

143
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:06,977
Come on Yowler.

144
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:18,273
- We'll be back by nightfall.

145
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:21,106
- I'll have a warm supper waiting.

146
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,051
- Here you are lad.

147
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,311
- What's this grandpa?

148
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:31,946
- It's a divining rod.

149
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:33,668
- A divining rod?

150
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:34,933
For fishing?

151
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,553
- Not for fishing.

152
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,053
No for dosing lad.

153
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,993
Getting things in the Earth.

154
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:43,576
Water, minerals, and ley lines.

155
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:46,666
- Ley lines?

156
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,499
- Let's see if you're a doser lad.

157
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:53,982
You hold it like this, little bit flexed.

158
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:58,276
Now walk forward, nice and slow.

159
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:16,438
That's a ley line right beneath you, lad.

160
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:20,322
Ley lines are a kind of
energy within the Earth, lad.

161
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:24,489
Like the magnetic forces, but
a bit more magical in nature.

162
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:29,356
The Chinese call them dragon paths.

163
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,805
The Celtics called them fairy tracks.

164
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:35,030
They're great lines across the land

165
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,879
that link up ancient sites.

166
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,129
Standing stones, churches, and castles.

167
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:42,637
And a grand design.

168
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:48,820
Even castle McGowan was
built upon a ley line.

169
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:52,060
- So you mean this piece of wood

170
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,657
is sort of a magic wand or something?

171
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:57,804
- The magic is within you lad.

172
00:11:57,804 --> 00:12:01,807
The divining rod is just an instrument.

173
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:03,454
Come now.

174
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:06,287
Let's see where this ley leads us.

175
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:12,094
The Earth is like a great living creature.

176
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:14,405
It's life force is part of all of us.

177
00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:16,679
In the olden days man
built his secret sites

178
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,929
where it's inner forces were strongest.

179
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,815
This is the Giant Stone.

180
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:42,648
The resting place of the
Dark Knight MacClain.

181
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:46,190
To protect this stone is
part of our ancestral duty.

182
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,056
It was my father's before me.

183
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:51,525
And it will be yours
after I'm dead and gone.

184
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:54,512
- How do you protect a stone grandpa?

185
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:57,941
- This stone must never
be moved or broken.

186
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:00,181
Or the Dark Knight will be free.

187
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:02,222
And if he finds Yowler here,

188
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:06,389
he'll use his blood to unleash
all manner of evil on Earth.

189
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:11,903
- But that's just a story, right?

190
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:13,653
It's not really real.

191
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:16,254
- Who's to say?

192
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,255
Every legend has a seed of truth.

193
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:25,966
Now, here's something they
don't teach in school.

194
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:31,054
Two great ley lines
intersect on this hilltop.

195
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:34,574
The Earth force here is stronger
than anywhere for miles.

196
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:38,284
Scientists and city folk
say it isn't possible.

197
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,867
But here it is lad.

198
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:42,515
Feel it.

199
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:51,854
I must've tapped right
into the heart of it.

200
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:55,482
(yells)
- Careful grandpa!

201
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,649
(mutters)

202
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:01,807
This is no game.

203
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,528
(yowling)

204
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:10,609
- Grandpa, what's happening?

205
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:12,385
- There's a storm blowing in.

206
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:16,094
We'll have to find shelter quickly.

207
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:16,927
It's hot.

208
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,446
(thunder rumbling)

209
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:32,427
Johnny, there's not a second to lose.

210
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:34,927
- Come on Yowler, come on boy!

211
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:08,817
- Run, Johnny.

212
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:09,936
Like the wind.

213
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:12,496
- No, not without you grandpa!

214
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:13,741
Come on!

215
00:15:13,741 --> 00:15:15,112
- I'll be along as fast as I can.

216
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:18,881
Go on Johnny, take Yowler,
lock him safely in the castle!

217
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:20,214
Run Johnny, now!

218
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:23,943
- [Johnny] Come on Yowler!

219
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:25,844
Come on.

220
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:43,687
Stay inside the circle, MacClain.

221
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:42,819
- Mrs. Cosgrove!

222
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:47,211
Mrs. Cosgrove!

223
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,173
(belling ringing)

224
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:55,479
- Johnny, what's the problem child?

225
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,482
- A storm blew up out of nowhere!

226
00:16:57,482 --> 00:16:58,869
Lightning struck the Giant Stone

227
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:01,115
and freed the Dark Knight MacClain!

228
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:03,948
Yowler, get inside and stay there!

229
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,441
We've got to find grandpa!

230
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:13,858
- Right ya are lad, let's go.

231
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:21,895
(yelling)

232
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,346
- You there, what are you tryin' to do?

233
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,371
Get yourselves killed?

234
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:31,304
- Douglas, could you
lend us a hand please?

235
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:35,301
- What's that you say?
- We need your help sir!

236
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,206
- Well what can I do for ya?

237
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,876
- It's grandpa sir!

238
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:40,604
- Angus is missing!

239
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,204
- Missing you say?

240
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:44,905
- The Dark Knight, the dragonslayer!

241
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:46,948
I saw him with my own eyes.

242
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,498
- You'll have to speak up laddie,

243
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,560
I cannae hear you.

244
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,073
- He's as deaf as a doornail,

245
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:54,507
it's from the sound of
his own hunting rifle.

246
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,688
He says he saw the Dark Knight

247
00:17:57,688 --> 00:18:00,256
break free from the Giant Stone.

248
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:03,589
- Oh the Dark Knight of the Giant Stone.

249
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:07,015
Oh that's just a legend laddie.

250
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:10,136
I would nae worry too much about

251
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:12,894
your grandpa's fairytales coming to life.

252
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:13,960
- Aye Johnny.

253
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,465
You don't want to let Angus' tall tales

254
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:18,916
fill your head with fancies.

255
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,999
- Come on, let's find the old rascal.

256
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,653
- Merciful heavens!

257
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:30,051
- Grandpa?

258
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,192
- Stay away from him, Johnny.

259
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,109
Don't look at him, lad!

260
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,216
- The Dark Knight, he killed him!

261
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:43,526
- He's been struck by lightning laddie.

262
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:44,693
Come away now.

263
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:48,645
No sight for a child's eyes.

264
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:51,756
- The dragonslayer,
he's come back to life!

265
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,300
Why won't you believe me!

266
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,647
- Get a grip on yourself laddie!

267
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:58,497
You're suffering from shock!

268
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:01,036
There is no dragonslayer.

269
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:04,769
And if there was one,
he'd be stiff outta luck,

270
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,269
because there's nae such thing as dragons.

271
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:24,805
(ominous instrumental music)

272
00:19:58,873 --> 00:20:00,790
- What's happened here?

273
00:20:02,922 --> 00:20:05,172
How many years have passed?

274
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,060
What sorcery has brought me back?

275
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,602
I'll need dragon's blood.

276
00:21:52,536 --> 00:21:55,407
(neighing)

277
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:58,074
(bagpipe music)

278
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:31,031
- Aye, he was a good man.

279
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,959
- God rest his soul.

280
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:39,304
- Well, I'll be leaving you now.

281
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:44,168
- You're a kind neighbor Douglas.

282
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:45,001
Thank you.

283
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:49,659
- He'd have done the same for me.

284
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,492
- Aye.

285
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:11,484
- His heart's in the highlands,
his heart is no here.

286
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:15,651
His heart's in the highlands
and chasing the deer.

287
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,722
If you've a mind to laddie,

288
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:22,389
perhaps you and I could
go hunting sometime.

289
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:25,884
- I appreciate the offer sir.

290
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:28,909
But I don't kill animals for sport.

291
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,264
- Oh you're just like your grandpa.

292
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:34,851
I was right fond of him,

293
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:38,768
but he was the most
contrarian man I ever knew.

294
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:48,516
I'm there if you need me.

295
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:01,047
- Come on lad.

296
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:02,714
Let's dry your eyes.

297
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:08,429
- What are we gonna do Mrs. Cosgrove?

298
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:10,512
- Oh, we'll be all right.

299
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:15,582
We'll miss your grandpa of course but,

300
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:17,884
you're the lord of the manor now,

301
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:21,136
and you've got to rise
to your responsibilities.

302
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:23,982
There's the land, the castle.

303
00:24:23,982 --> 00:24:26,815
But most important there's Yowler.

304
00:24:27,987 --> 00:24:30,402
- Am I an orphan again?

305
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,485
- Oh, God bless your heart child, no.

306
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:39,784
I'll be your mother, if
you'll have me, Johnny.

307
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:44,612
You know I love you with all my heart.

308
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,493
- Can I still call you Mrs. Cosgrove?

309
00:24:53,707 --> 00:24:56,707
- You can call me anything you like.

310
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,976
(horse neighing)

311
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:03,718
What's the matter Johnny?

312
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,550
- The Dark Knight!

313
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,550
- I told you about that.

314
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,460
What in the blue blazes?

315
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,512
- He's coming!

316
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,012
- Quick Johnny, lock the gate!

317
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:24,569
Come on.

318
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:39,923
- Yowler, Yowler where are you?

319
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:42,090
(yowling)

320
00:25:43,593 --> 00:25:45,176
- Into the library.

321
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:55,944
(yells)

322
00:25:55,944 --> 00:26:00,111
Yowler, behave yourself!
(yowling)

323
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,244
- Yowler, stop it!

324
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:06,558
Do you believe me now?

325
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:07,591
It's the Dark Knight!

326
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,297
- It's not the Dark Knight lad!

327
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:11,928
It's just a ghostly apparition.

328
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:14,204
It can't do us any real harm.

329
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:17,704
Just frighten the daylights out of us.

330
00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:18,847
- If he can't do us any harm,

331
00:26:18,847 --> 00:26:20,853
why did we barricade the door?

332
00:26:20,853 --> 00:26:22,971
- The secret to gettin' along with ghosts

333
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:26,864
is to keep a good solid wall between you.

334
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:29,614
(horse neighing)

335
00:26:31,895 --> 00:26:33,191
Come to think of it,

336
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,746
I've never seen a ghost in broad daylight.

337
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:39,733
- See I told you, he's real!

338
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:42,313
- Oh quick lad, hide Yowler in the cellar.

339
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:44,071
And bring back a hammer and nails.

340
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:44,977
- Yes ma'am!

341
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:47,894
- I'll fetch my trusty blunderbuss.

342
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,677
- Yowler, come on!

343
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,843
Yowler, stay here and don't make a sound!

344
00:27:03,843 --> 00:27:06,103
Yowler, come on boy!

345
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:08,853
I'm doing this for your own good!

346
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:18,051
Yowler, that's a boy.

347
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:21,468
Stay here, I'll be back as fast as I can!

348
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:51,328
- Johnny?

349
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:54,444
Johnny?

350
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:55,526
- [Johnny] Yes ma'am?

351
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:58,218
- Johnny, don't jump out at me like that!

352
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,178
- [Johnny] Sorry.

353
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:03,018
- We've got to hang this
iron cross on the front door.

354
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:04,435
To ward off evil.

355
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:12,340
Johnny, quick!

356
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:23,035
- Perhaps there's another entrance.

357
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:25,035
Or a breach in the wall.

358
00:29:26,655 --> 00:29:28,572
I'll find a way inside.

359
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,824
- I beg your pardon, is anybody home?

360
00:30:13,357 --> 00:30:15,656
- Take this Johnny, to defend yourself,

361
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:17,397
if it comes down to it.

362
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:19,562
(rumbling)
- It's the Dark Knight!

363
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:20,740
- Don't worry about it.

364
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,518
If he tries any monkey business,

365
00:30:22,518 --> 00:30:26,222
he'll be answering to my blunderbuss.

366
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:28,542
(screaming)

367
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:31,316
What in the blue blazes?

368
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:32,884
- Put that weapon down immediately madam,

369
00:30:32,884 --> 00:30:34,912
or I shall have you arrested!

370
00:30:34,912 --> 00:30:36,156
And you young man!

371
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:38,361
You could poke somebody's
eye out with that sword.

372
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:41,916
- I beg your pardon
ma'am, but who are you?

373
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:44,937
And what business brings
you to Castle McGowan?

374
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:46,518
- Evelyn Churchill.

375
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:48,633
Department of Child Welfare.

376
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:52,800
I am here to see Mr. Angus
McGowan and young Jonathon.

377
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,187
- Well come inside, mustn't
dawdle out in the open.

378
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:10,215
There now!

379
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,770
Department of Child Welfare you say?

380
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,913
We were just dusting off
the family heirlooms.

381
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:22,307
There's a good boy Johnny, nice and shiny.

382
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:25,224
Now get back on the wall mount lad.

383
00:31:27,827 --> 00:31:30,646
- Mrs. McGowan I presume?

384
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:31,646
- Oh! Oh no.

385
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,559
I'm afraid not ma'am.

386
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,142
I'm Lila Cosgrove, housekeeper.

387
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:40,674
- I see.

388
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:42,757
And you must be Jonathon?

389
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:47,139
- Say hello to the nice lady Johnny.

390
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:51,070
- Pleased to make your
acquaintance, ma'am.

391
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,820
- Likewise, I'm sure.

392
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:57,572
Well now, down to business, eh?

393
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:05,951
I believe Mr. McGowan is expecting me.

394
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:07,468
- Oh.

395
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:11,027
I don't suppose you've heard, have you?

396
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:14,110
Mr. McGowan passed on just yesterday.

397
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:16,548
- Oh dear.

398
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:18,323
I am sorry.

399
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,318
- It was a terrible accident.

400
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,401
Struck down by lightning.

401
00:32:26,783 --> 00:32:30,564
Right, let's go to the library shall we?

402
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:31,397
This way.

403
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,420
Don't let on that anything's
amiss, it's very important.

404
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,873
Be on your best behavior lad.

405
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,196
(distant yowling)

406
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:42,907
- Sorry about that, it's the dog.

407
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:46,105
(distant yowling)

408
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:47,580
- Dear me.

409
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,247
I've heard such a plaintive cry.

410
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:54,427
What breed is it?

411
00:32:54,427 --> 00:32:55,399
Can I see it?

412
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:57,835
- Oh no ma'am, he's a wild creature.

413
00:32:57,835 --> 00:33:00,060
Doesn't take kindly to strangers.

414
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,783
- Oh he doesn't bite though, no,

415
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,700
he's sweet and gentle with the lad.

416
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:32,688
Pardon the inconvenience, ma'am,

417
00:33:32,688 --> 00:33:34,188
but we were just--

418
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:40,571
- Taking inventory of
grandpa's possessions.

419
00:33:40,571 --> 00:33:41,404
- I see.

420
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,434
Mr. McGowan did receive
the letter we sent?

421
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:50,380
- Oh yes, I'm sure he did ma'am.

422
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,996
But Mr. McGowan had a bad habit of

423
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:57,188
tearing up official
correspondence. (laughs)

424
00:33:57,188 --> 00:33:58,021
- Right.

425
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:03,322
I'm here to discuss certain irregularities

426
00:34:03,322 --> 00:34:06,349
regarding Jonathon's upbringing.

427
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:10,083
- Yes indeed ma'am, and
I agree with you 100%.

428
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:13,476
I told Angus the lad should be in school.

429
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:17,393
- However, in the light
of recent developments,

430
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:23,062
I'm obliged to conduct a
thorough investigation.

431
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,155
- Investigation?

432
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:28,905
And what sort of
investigation might that be?

433
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:33,727
- Tell me Jonathon.

434
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:36,706
Have you ever been to school?

435
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:37,623
- No ma'am.

436
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,905
But my grandpa taught me
how to read and write.

437
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:44,248
- Oh, he's a brilliant reader, he is.

438
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,485
He's been reading the classics
since he was knee high.

439
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,318
- I see.

440
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:53,870
Are you happy here, Jonathon?

441
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:56,524
- Oh yes ma'am!

442
00:34:57,603 --> 00:35:00,686
That is, I was until my grandpa died.

443
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:04,249
- Oh yes of course.

444
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:06,061
What a terrible blow.

445
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:08,302
- Oh but Johnny's a resilient lad.

446
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:13,037
Do you know his mum and dad
died when he was six years old?

447
00:35:13,037 --> 00:35:16,463
- Yes, yes it's all here in the file.

448
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:18,507
(crashing and yowling)

449
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:19,392
- Beg your pardon ma'am.

450
00:35:19,392 --> 00:35:20,975
I'll be right back.

451
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:27,914
- I'm knitting Johnny a fine pullover.

452
00:35:27,914 --> 00:35:28,997
Look at that.

453
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:40,016
(yowling)
- Yowler?

454
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:46,030
Yowler, for crying out loud!

455
00:35:55,861 --> 00:36:00,853
Be good now, and I'll let
you out as soon as I can!

456
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:04,353
(chanting unintelligibly)

457
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:41,212
- Let's discuss Jonathon's
future, shall we?

458
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:42,382
- Well yes indeed.

459
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:45,882
I was thinking the very same thing myself.

460
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,450
(sniffing)

461
00:36:53,163 --> 00:36:55,580
- Is there something burning?

462
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:59,239
(shrieks)
Fire!

463
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,367
- Oh, dear heavens!

464
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:02,971
Help!

465
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,335
- [Evelyn] I don't believe
it, this is a mad house!

466
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:07,793
- What's going on here?

467
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,376
- Where's the kitchen, quickly?

468
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,798
Unsanitary conditions!

469
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:34,406
- What the devil happened here?

470
00:37:34,406 --> 00:37:36,877
- I haven't the faintest idea.

471
00:37:36,877 --> 00:37:39,775
It just burst into flame.

472
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:42,228
- Jonathon, I'm going to ask you to

473
00:37:42,228 --> 00:37:44,860
come with me to Edinburgh for a few days.

474
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,993
To sort out some legal matters.

475
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:48,415
- Edinburgh?

476
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:50,391
Oh that's out of the question ma'am.

477
00:37:50,391 --> 00:37:53,449
Mrs. Cosgrove needs me here
at the castle just now.

478
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:54,922
Right Mrs. Cosgrove?

479
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:56,115
- Oh yes indeed ma'am.

480
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:58,548
Johnny's the lord of the manor now,

481
00:37:58,548 --> 00:38:01,765
and he's got responsibilities you know?

482
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:03,597
- I'm sure he has.

483
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,182
But I'm afraid my responsibilities

484
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:08,152
outweigh his at the moment.

485
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,302
In the absence of a legal guardian,

486
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:13,624
I am obliged to place
Jonathon in a foster home

487
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,096
until his case can be thoroughly reviewed.

488
00:38:17,096 --> 00:38:18,228
- Foster home?

489
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:19,384
But I'm on orphan!

490
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:21,822
Mrs. Cosgrove's gonna be my mother now!

491
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:23,383
Aren't you, Mrs. Cosgrove?

492
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:24,717
- Of course I am lad!

493
00:38:24,717 --> 00:38:28,085
I'll adopt him this instant, ma'am.

494
00:38:28,085 --> 00:38:30,547
If you just help me out
with the paperwork--

495
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:32,169
- I'm afraid that wouldn't necessarily

496
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:34,906
be in the boy's best interest.

497
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:39,073
This gloomy castle is hardly
conducive to a happy childhood.

498
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:42,979
- What would you know about
happy childhoods ma'am?

499
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:45,538
You certainly don't look like you had one!

500
00:38:45,538 --> 00:38:46,411
- Johnny!

501
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,172
- I beg your pardon?

502
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:50,255
- Hold your tongue child.

503
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:54,802
Surely there must be some
other solution, ma'am.

504
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:57,823
- You can file an appeal if you wish.

505
00:38:57,823 --> 00:38:59,658
But I warn you.

506
00:38:59,658 --> 00:39:01,219
If you interfere with me,

507
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:02,594
I shall have you prosecuted

508
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:05,454
to the fullest extent of the law.

509
00:39:05,454 --> 00:39:07,607
- You can't remove me from my own castle!

510
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:09,954
This is my ancestral land.

511
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:13,636
- I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this Jonathon.

512
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:15,394
But according to the records,

513
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:19,197
your grandfather died owing
a fortune in property taxes.

514
00:39:19,197 --> 00:39:21,454
Your ancestral lands will soon be

515
00:39:21,454 --> 00:39:23,856
auctioned off to the highest bidder.

516
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,509
- They can't do that!

517
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:27,392
- Oh yes they can.

518
00:39:27,392 --> 00:39:30,663
Unless you are in a position
to pay off the debt yourself.

519
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:32,031
- How can we do that?

520
00:39:32,031 --> 00:39:34,213
We haven't any income.

521
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:36,419
- My point precisely.

522
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:38,659
- I'll ask you to leave
my property now ma'am!

523
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:42,255
I'm not going anywhere
with the likes of you!

524
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,672
- Oh yes you are.

525
00:39:45,654 --> 00:39:46,487
- Run lad!

526
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:49,822
- Don't underestimate me, boy.

527
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:52,423
I worked for 10 years as drilling officer.

528
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,040
- Yowler, help!

529
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,873
No!

530
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:58,023
(yowling)

531
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:04,674
- Have mercy, ma'am!

532
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:06,166
He's all I have left in the world!

533
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,673
- Unhand me!

534
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:09,117
You don't understand!

535
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:11,409
- I understand perfectly, child.

536
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,930
I've done this many times before.

537
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:18,007
Now be a good boy or I'll
place you in handcuffs.

538
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:20,174
(yowling)

539
00:40:27,443 --> 00:40:30,002
- Mrs. Cosgrove, do something!

540
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:31,463
- Be brave, Johnny!

541
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:34,007
I'll sort this out in no time!

542
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:36,120
- If you have any further inquiries,

543
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,953
you can contact me on this number.

544
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,383
- No offense ma'am,

545
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:44,550
but I'll be contacting your superiors.

546
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:55,399
- Mrs. Cosgrove!

547
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:00,264
Mrs. Cosgrove!

548
00:41:03,554 --> 00:41:04,471
Let me out!

549
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:23,334
- Yowler?

550
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:27,206
Yowler, no!

551
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:31,437
(horse neighing)

552
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,746
Hold it right there MacClain!

553
00:41:49,497 --> 00:41:52,164
Heaven help me, I've killed him.

554
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:59,181
(yelling)

555
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:00,848
Help, somebody help!

556
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,793
- Where that boy goes,
the dragon will follow.

557
00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:22,431
- Right now, let's see.

558
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,945
First off, well it stand to reason,

559
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:29,383
I'll start the motor.

560
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:32,188
(engine rumbles to life)

561
00:42:32,188 --> 00:42:36,529
Well if Angus can drive, I'm
certain I can make a go of it.

562
00:42:36,529 --> 00:42:39,612
Oh, I'll just push this down to here.

563
00:42:50,787 --> 00:42:53,954
(upbeat Celtic music)

564
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:11,165
- There now child, don't
look at me like that.

565
00:43:11,165 --> 00:43:12,998
I'm only doing my job.

566
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:15,557
- And a rotten job it is, ma'am.

567
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:16,762
Tearing helpless children from

568
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:19,345
the comfort of hearth and home.

569
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:21,281
Yowler?

570
00:43:22,165 --> 00:43:23,082
Yowler, no!

571
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,057
Stop the car ma'am, please!

572
00:43:28,057 --> 00:43:29,479
You don't understand.

573
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:30,866
- Explain it to me then,

574
00:43:30,866 --> 00:43:35,273
I would love to hear
your side of the story.

575
00:43:35,273 --> 00:43:38,043
- First off, I suppose I should tell you.

576
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:39,210
My dog Yowler?

577
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:43,328
Well, you see, he's not exactly a dog.

578
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:46,881
- Oh really?

579
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:50,762
What is he, a pup wolf? (laughs)

580
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:53,657
- No ma'am, he's actually a,

581
00:43:53,657 --> 00:43:55,740
sort of a, well a dragon.

582
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:03,064
Honestly ma'am, he was given
to me by the fairy folk!

583
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:04,947
Back when I first came to the highlands!

584
00:44:04,947 --> 00:44:08,111
Everything was going fine until
grandpa's dad was walking.

585
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:12,111
(Johnny continues indistinctly)

586
00:44:17,606 --> 00:44:19,891
(Yowler groaning)

587
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,641
(horse neighing)

588
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,784
So you see ma'am, if I'm
not there to protect him,

589
00:44:31,784 --> 00:44:33,562
the Dark Knight will use Yowler's blood

590
00:44:33,562 --> 00:44:36,086
to conjure all manner of evil on Earth!

591
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:39,342
- Jonathon, I'm afraid you spent a little

592
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:43,800
too much time alone with
superstitious old folk.

593
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,117
- Those superstitious old folk

594
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:46,824
happen to be my loved ones ma'am.

595
00:44:46,824 --> 00:44:48,586
And I'll thank you kindly
to mind your tongue

596
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,953
while speaking about my departed grandpa!

597
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:52,482
- All right then.

598
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,663
We'll let the mental
health experts sort out

599
00:44:54,663 --> 00:44:56,551
whether these delusions of yours

600
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:59,694
stem from of an overactive imagination,

601
00:44:59,694 --> 00:45:01,710
morbid anxieties,

602
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,543
or if you're simply a
lying little ragamuffin.

603
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,887
You and I both know there are
no such things as dragons.

604
00:45:14,627 --> 00:45:16,633
Therefore it stand to reason

605
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:20,800
there are no such things
as dragonslaying knights.

606
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:27,263
What the ruddy hell?

607
00:45:34,538 --> 00:45:36,509
- It's the Dark Knight!

608
00:45:36,509 --> 00:45:38,272
Help me ma'am!

609
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:41,022
- Stay right where you are child.

610
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:45,885
Now look here sir.

611
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:49,040
What right have you to
block this thoroughfare?

612
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,540
Let us pass, or I shall have you arrested!

613
00:45:56,451 --> 00:45:59,201
(horse neighing)

614
00:46:00,773 --> 00:46:03,552
How dare you, you ruffian!

615
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,253
This vehicle is the property

616
00:46:05,253 --> 00:46:07,581
of the Department of Child Welfare!

617
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:09,414
Give me your name sir!

618
00:46:10,805 --> 00:46:14,222
Or I shall report you to the authorities.

619
00:46:18,373 --> 00:46:19,206
Come back!

620
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:21,514
Come back!

621
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:32,986
Don't you come any closer!

622
00:46:32,986 --> 00:46:36,403
Or I shall disable you with martial arts!

623
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,260
Help.

624
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,093
Help.

625
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:51,120
Help!

626
00:46:54,355 --> 00:46:58,438
(neighing and hooves clattering)

627
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:18,912
- [MacClain] Give me the
dragon, and I spare your life.

628
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:22,062
- This is the 20th century, sir.

629
00:47:22,062 --> 00:47:25,062
We don't believe in dragons anymore.

630
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,590
(horse neighing)

631
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:51,450
Evil spirits can't cross running water!

632
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:55,931
My grandpa wasn't just a
superstitious old geezer after all!

633
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:58,044
- I'll find your dragon, lad.

634
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:01,564
And with it raise the powers of darkness.

635
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:03,733
- Over my dead body, sir!

636
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:07,150
- I'll grant that wish when next we meet.

637
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,000
- Dragonslaying knights.

638
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,362
The nerve of these highlanders.

639
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,729
Aiding and abetting a boy's escape.

640
00:48:20,729 --> 00:48:22,705
Trying to make a fool of me.

641
00:48:22,705 --> 00:48:24,355
I shall have them prosecuted to

642
00:48:24,355 --> 00:48:26,855
the fullest extent of the law.

643
00:48:39,487 --> 00:48:40,320
- Yowler!

644
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,302
It's suppertime, Yowler!

645
00:48:44,302 --> 00:48:45,719
Oh, oops-a-daisy.

646
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:49,442
Settle down now, jalopy.

647
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:51,611
- And damaging government property.

648
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:52,778
Dragon my eye.

649
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:56,960
Do they actually think I'll
fall for that outlandish yarn?

650
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,543
They'll find I'm not
so easily intimidated.

651
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,399
- Miss gentle-ma'am?

652
00:49:24,399 --> 00:49:27,042
What in the blue blazes
are you doing here?

653
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:30,103
- Mrs. Cosgrove, thank
heavens you found me!

654
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:31,866
- Oh spare me your gratitude ma'am.

655
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:34,283
It isn't you I'm looking for.

656
00:49:36,902 --> 00:49:38,515
Where's Johnny?

657
00:49:38,515 --> 00:49:39,937
- The last I saw of him,

658
00:49:39,937 --> 00:49:41,963
he was running off through the forest.

659
00:49:41,963 --> 00:49:45,092
With in accomplice in a suit of armor.

660
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:46,230
- (gasps) No!

661
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,581
- Oh yes!

662
00:49:47,581 --> 00:49:49,593
It was quite an elaborate little escapade.

663
00:49:49,593 --> 00:49:52,655
- That was no escapade ma'am.

664
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,997
That was the Dark Knight!

665
00:49:54,997 --> 00:49:57,003
- Now look here madam.

666
00:49:57,003 --> 00:49:58,957
I do not appreciate you highlanders

667
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:00,932
having a laugh at my expense!

668
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:03,759
Frighten off the city folk, eh, hm?

669
00:50:03,759 --> 00:50:05,217
Is that your little game?

670
00:50:05,217 --> 00:50:07,967
- Believe me ma'am, it's no game.

671
00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:10,306
Where was he?

672
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:15,347
- That way, up the road a bit.

673
00:50:15,347 --> 00:50:16,579
- Johnny!

674
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:19,155
Johnny, can you hear me?

675
00:50:19,155 --> 00:50:20,988
Yowler, where are you?

676
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:26,770
- Good heavens, you actually
believe all this, don't you?

677
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,138
And just where do you think you're doing?

678
00:50:32,138 --> 00:50:33,305
Mrs. Cosgrove!

679
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:35,763
Wait for me!

680
00:50:59,773 --> 00:51:00,606
- Hello?

681
00:51:01,462 --> 00:51:03,295
Any fairy folk around?

682
00:51:04,783 --> 00:51:06,866
I hope I'm not intruding.

683
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:36,398
Grandpa?

684
00:51:36,398 --> 00:51:38,282
You're alive?

685
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:40,213
- I'm a ghost, lad.

686
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:41,880
Wandering the moors.

687
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:45,267
- Why did you have to die, grandpa?

688
00:51:45,267 --> 00:51:47,827
You left us in an awful mess.

689
00:51:47,827 --> 00:51:49,696
- Forgive me Johnny.

690
00:51:49,696 --> 00:51:51,951
I was showing off like a damn fool

691
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:54,745
and didn't consider the consequences.

692
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,451
- Can you help us at least?

693
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:58,118
From the other side?

694
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:00,964
- I'll do my best lad.

695
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:05,343
But I haven't quite got the
hang of this ghostly existence.

696
00:52:05,343 --> 00:52:07,948
- Can you point me in the direction home?

697
00:52:07,948 --> 00:52:09,480
- Home's that way.

698
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,226
Follow the ley line.

699
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:13,020
(horse neighing)

700
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:13,853
Sh.

701
00:52:15,296 --> 00:52:17,162
Beware Johnny.

702
00:52:17,162 --> 00:52:19,412
The Dark Knight draws near.

703
00:52:25,122 --> 00:52:27,872
(horse neighing)

704
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:50,593
(yowling)

705
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:04,594
(horse neighing)

706
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,397
(yowling)

707
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:26,774
- Johnny!

708
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,619
Johnny, Yowler, are you there?

709
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:38,097
- Oh, these ruddy boots.

710
00:53:38,097 --> 00:53:40,017
We should have stayed on the highroad.

711
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:40,923
- Sh!

712
00:53:40,923 --> 00:53:43,644
Don't let the fairy folk hear you.

713
00:53:43,644 --> 00:53:45,245
- Fairy folk?

714
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:48,428
You really are something else,
aren't you Mrs. Cosgrove?

715
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:51,503
I cannot believe I'm following you.

716
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:52,802
- It's almost daylight.

717
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:56,342
We'd best get back to the
castle and see if they're there.

718
00:53:56,342 --> 00:54:00,009
- Help me up then. (groans)

719
00:54:12,478 --> 00:54:15,228
(horse neighing)

720
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:32,615
- Yowler?

721
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:37,344
Yowler!

722
00:54:52,653 --> 00:54:55,986
(peaceful Celtic music)

723
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,617
I've got to find my way home.

724
00:55:22,642 --> 00:55:24,809
(snoring)

725
00:55:42,147 --> 00:55:43,868
- You'd better have a good explanation

726
00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:46,395
for this whole fiasco Mrs. Cosgrove.

727
00:55:46,395 --> 00:55:47,928
Because believe you me,

728
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,715
if I file a report
claiming child endangerment

729
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:54,500
due to dragons and encounters
with medieval knights,

730
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,857
the department will have
my bloody head examined!

731
00:55:57,857 --> 00:56:00,869
- There is only one dragon ma'am!

732
00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:03,373
And he's like a brother to Johnny.

733
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:06,822
- The department sibling rules
to not extend to dragons,

734
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,205
Mrs. Cosgrove.

735
00:56:08,205 --> 00:56:11,023
If that is the basis of your appeal,

736
00:56:11,023 --> 00:56:14,773
you will find yourself
on shaky legal ground.

737
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,313
- Johnny?

738
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:22,111
Yowler?

739
00:56:23,071 --> 00:56:24,154
Anybody home?

740
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:42,241
(groaning)

741
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:43,574
- Run ya coward.

742
00:56:45,832 --> 00:56:47,249
We'll meet again.

743
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:55,337
(singing indistinctly)

744
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,330
(sniffing)

745
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:18,706
(yowling)

746
00:57:34,337 --> 00:57:36,521
(sniffing)

747
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:38,248
(sneezes)

748
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:40,113
What in tarnation?

749
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:42,231
(yelling)

750
00:57:42,231 --> 00:57:43,314
Get back you!

751
00:57:59,005 --> 00:57:59,838
Dragon!

752
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:02,512
Dragon!

753
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:32,636
- Now, if I can just find the ley line.

754
00:58:37,564 --> 00:58:38,397
- Johnny?

755
00:58:39,591 --> 00:58:40,424
Yowler?

756
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:42,700
Johnny?

757
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:44,936
Yowler?

758
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,323
I thought sure they'd be back by now.

759
00:58:56,769 --> 00:58:59,899
We've got to round up a search party.

760
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:01,316
- Excellent idea.

761
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,709
But first of all let's
round up a pot of tea.

762
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:09,042
After all that walking, my rump is sore.

763
00:59:10,312 --> 00:59:13,206
- Well you stay put and catch
up on your beauty sleep.

764
00:59:13,206 --> 00:59:14,774
I'm going out alone.

765
00:59:14,774 --> 00:59:16,944
- Oh no you don't!

766
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:21,111
Jonathon's my responsibility,
now let's not forget.

767
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,483
After we've found him he's coming with me.

768
00:59:35,456 --> 00:59:38,206
(horse neighing)

769
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:54,366
- No!

770
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,378
No please, leave me alone!

771
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:01,795
- That's right, struggle lad!

772
01:00:02,715 --> 01:00:05,798
Your fear will call the dragon to us.

773
01:00:15,756 --> 01:00:19,135
- Mrs. Cosgrove, Mrs. Cosgrove!

774
01:00:19,135 --> 01:00:22,302
Mrs. Cosgrove, there's a dragon ma'am!

775
01:00:25,108 --> 01:00:28,178
(gun fires)

776
01:00:28,178 --> 01:00:29,382
- What was that?

777
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:31,465
- It sounds like trouble!

778
01:00:35,713 --> 01:00:37,636
- What's all the ruckus down there?

779
01:00:37,636 --> 01:00:39,272
- I've come to warn you ma'am!

780
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:41,239
There's a dragon hereabouts!

781
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:43,803
I'm raisin' up a hunting party!

782
01:00:43,803 --> 01:00:46,454
- Don't you go raisin'
up anything Douglas!

783
01:00:46,454 --> 01:00:48,037
I'll be right down.

784
01:00:50,071 --> 01:00:52,625
- He's a rather rugged looking fellow.

785
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:54,937
- I've got to stop him ma'am.

786
01:00:54,937 --> 01:00:58,437
- You go on, I'll be along at my own pace.

787
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,664
- There's a dragon on the moor!

788
01:01:04,664 --> 01:01:06,599
I saw it with me own eyes!

789
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:09,570
- Where did you see it
man, tell me, quickly now!

790
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:12,039
- That way, down by the river!

791
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:14,777
A vicious man-eating beast!

792
01:01:14,777 --> 01:01:16,270
- Listen to me Douglas.

793
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,068
We've got to find Johnny.

794
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:21,432
He's been missing since last night.

795
01:01:21,432 --> 01:01:23,452
- Dragon's got Johnny ya say?

796
01:01:23,452 --> 01:01:26,865
We've got to warn old
man Kimison and his boys!

797
01:01:26,865 --> 01:01:28,323
Meet us at the crossroads,

798
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:32,536
we'll hunt the beast down
and pump it full of lead!

799
01:01:32,536 --> 01:01:34,672
- No Douglas, come back!

800
01:01:34,672 --> 01:01:36,662
Would you listen to me--
(blunderbuss fires)

801
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:37,960
(shrieks)

802
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,484
- Hold your fire, madam!

803
01:01:40,484 --> 01:01:42,901
- Oh it was just a warning shot.

804
01:01:42,901 --> 01:01:46,494
But if he so much as looks
at Yowler cross-eyed,

805
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:51,067
he'll be tasting the
wrath of my blunderbuss!

806
01:01:51,067 --> 01:01:55,951
- Discharging a firearm,
threatening bodily harm.

807
01:01:55,951 --> 01:02:00,118
Give me that gun madam or I
shall disarm you with Kung Fu.

808
01:02:01,091 --> 01:02:04,424
(shouting and groaning)

809
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:10,420
(birds cawing)

810
01:02:16,777 --> 01:02:19,694
All right, let's just find the boy,

811
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:23,817
and rescue him from this insanity.

812
01:02:23,817 --> 01:02:24,650
- Right!

813
01:02:28,596 --> 01:02:30,354
Don't dilly dally, ma'am.

814
01:02:30,354 --> 01:02:32,233
We've got to stop McCoy before he

815
01:02:32,233 --> 01:02:34,829
whips the menfolk into a frenzy!

816
01:02:34,829 --> 01:02:38,648
- I am sorry, but I
cannot walk any faster.

817
01:02:38,648 --> 01:02:42,815
I'm aching from my bloody
toenails to my ruddy bum!

818
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:47,772
- I'll fetch MacDuf.

819
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:52,059
- Oh, who's he, the country doctor?

820
01:02:55,202 --> 01:02:58,387
- Come along MacDuf, faster now.

821
01:02:58,387 --> 01:03:02,054
- Fast enough MacDuf,
there's a good fellow.

822
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:12,450
- No, let me go!

823
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,228
Mrs. Cosgrove!

824
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:15,061
Help!

825
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:18,369
Let me go, let me--

826
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:19,825
Let me go!

827
01:03:19,825 --> 01:03:21,242
Let me go please!

828
01:03:22,351 --> 01:03:23,268
Help, help!

829
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:28,595
Let me go please!

830
01:03:28,595 --> 01:03:29,441
Help!

831
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:30,788
Help!

832
01:03:30,788 --> 01:03:32,432
- Call the dragon to me lad,

833
01:03:32,432 --> 01:03:36,599
or I leave you here 'till the
birds pluck out your eyes.

834
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,103
- Please sir!

835
01:03:41,296 --> 01:03:43,006
(Johnny yelling)

836
01:03:43,006 --> 01:03:45,173
(yowling)

837
01:03:56,676 --> 01:04:00,593
- I call on lightning to
consecrate my sorcery.

838
01:04:03,102 --> 01:04:04,935
- If it's lightning you're after sir,

839
01:04:04,935 --> 01:04:07,423
I know a place more powerful than this.

840
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,497
If you let me go, I'll
show you where it is!

841
01:04:10,497 --> 01:04:12,615
- I know where it is, lad.

842
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:15,032
I lived here long before you.

843
01:04:19,513 --> 01:04:21,057
- Help!

844
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,057
Please somebody help me!

845
01:04:26,589 --> 01:04:27,506
- Ho there!

846
01:04:28,485 --> 01:04:30,068
Settle down, sheep.

847
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:34,817
- Mr. Kimison!

848
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:36,311
Mr. Kimison!

849
01:04:36,311 --> 01:04:37,943
There's a dragon on the moor!

850
01:04:37,943 --> 01:04:39,950
It's gotten the young McGowan lad!

851
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,355
Arm yourself up and follow me!

852
01:04:42,355 --> 01:04:43,620
- Dragon?

853
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:46,272
Have you gone mad McCoy?

854
01:04:46,272 --> 01:04:49,060
Go home man, sleep it off.

855
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:52,143
(yowling)
- Look out!

856
01:05:00,812 --> 01:05:02,395
- Stinking reptile!

857
01:05:07,332 --> 01:05:09,805
Drat, got away again.

858
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:10,805
Mr. Kimison.

859
01:05:13,173 --> 01:05:15,256
Mr. Kimison, Mr. Kimison!

860
01:05:16,149 --> 01:05:17,899
Oh, are you hurt man?

861
01:05:19,314 --> 01:05:20,770
- Did you see that, man?

862
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:22,905
The beast tried to kill me!

863
01:05:22,905 --> 01:05:26,572
Come on, my boys, they're
down at the still!

864
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:38,228
- Not a bad batch of the Mountain Dew.

865
01:05:38,228 --> 01:05:39,992
- Pa's gonna be proud of us.

866
01:05:39,992 --> 01:05:41,128
- Yes indeed.

867
01:05:41,128 --> 01:05:42,252
(gunshot firing)

868
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:43,771
- Did you hear that?

869
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:46,854
- Sounded like gunfire, in pa's direction.

870
01:05:46,854 --> 01:05:50,231
- It's the taxman, coming
to close our still!

871
01:05:50,231 --> 01:05:52,398
(yowling)

872
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:56,389
- What the blazes?

873
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:08,218
It went that way!

874
01:06:09,145 --> 01:06:11,919
- We've got to stop him lads!

875
01:06:11,919 --> 01:06:14,021
- It's gotten young John McGowan,

876
01:06:14,021 --> 01:06:16,969
and damn near killed your father!

877
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:19,552
Grab your rifles and follow me!

878
01:06:24,566 --> 01:06:27,483
(thunder rumbling)

879
01:06:30,326 --> 01:06:31,926
(yowling)

880
01:06:31,926 --> 01:06:32,759
- Yowler!

881
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:42,305
No!

882
01:06:43,513 --> 01:06:44,346
Yowler!

883
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:51,200
- Bid farewell to your dragon, lad.

884
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,143
And to the world you've known.

885
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:55,893
The age of black magic has begun.

886
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:12,806
You think you can get away?

887
01:07:12,806 --> 01:07:14,889
I promise you, you won't.

888
01:08:04,098 --> 01:08:06,162
- You've got to reconsider ma'am!

889
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:08,153
I don't know what I'll do with myself

890
01:08:08,153 --> 01:08:10,378
if I don't have Johnny.

891
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:13,293
- I understand perfectly Mrs. Cosgrove.

892
01:08:13,293 --> 01:08:16,669
But we have to act in
Jonathon's best interests.

893
01:08:16,669 --> 01:08:19,172
- I have been actin' in
Johnny's best interest

894
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:20,950
for the past five years.

895
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,944
And if I say so myself,

896
01:08:22,944 --> 01:08:25,777
I have made a right good go of it.

897
01:08:26,804 --> 01:08:27,971
Douglas McCoy!

898
01:08:28,807 --> 01:08:30,140
Mr. Kimison sir!

899
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:36,817
We'll take a shortcut to the crossroads.

900
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:39,779
Come along, MacDuf, quit your grousing.

901
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:41,042
Come on.

902
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:44,875
- [Evelyn] Easy MacDuf,
there's a good donkey!

903
01:08:45,877 --> 01:08:48,960
(baaing and barking)

904
01:08:53,324 --> 01:08:56,209
- Remember men, it's a
vicious man-eating beast.

905
01:08:56,209 --> 01:08:59,209
Shoot first and ask questions later.

906
01:09:00,086 --> 01:09:02,502
- Where's the widow Cosgrove?

907
01:09:02,502 --> 01:09:04,422
- She should've been here by now.

908
01:09:04,422 --> 01:09:08,293
- The dragon's eaten the widow Cosgrove!

909
01:09:08,293 --> 01:09:09,466
- [Men] No!

910
01:09:09,466 --> 01:09:11,350
- Wouldn't surprise me one bit.

911
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,183
Right men.

912
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:16,435
Let's stop the beast
before it kills again!

913
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:18,602
(yelling)

914
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:24,449
(distant thunder rumbling)

915
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:50,187
- First, the potion must
be touched by lightning.

916
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,360
And then, by the dragon's blood.

917
01:10:04,282 --> 01:10:07,032
(Yowler moaning)

918
01:11:00,776 --> 01:11:02,943
(yowling)

919
01:11:06,877 --> 01:11:07,710
- Yowler?

920
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,187
(yowling)

921
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:14,561
Yowler.

922
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:18,716
How does it open?

923
01:11:18,716 --> 01:11:20,049
There's no door.

924
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:32,634
This must be his book of spells.

925
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:52,737
(Yowler moaning)

926
01:11:55,424 --> 01:11:56,424
Not bad, eh?

927
01:11:57,789 --> 01:12:01,863
This sorcery stuff is
easier than it looks.

928
01:12:01,863 --> 01:12:06,517
We'll take this book so he
can't do any more mischief.

929
01:12:06,517 --> 01:12:09,100
Go on out, I'll be right there.

930
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:13,004
Would you look at this!

931
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:17,121
We'll take this too for good measure.

932
01:13:02,235 --> 01:13:05,235
(screaming in rage)

933
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:13,871
Yowler, this way!

934
01:13:16,827 --> 01:13:19,577
(horse neighing)

935
01:13:30,393 --> 01:13:32,893
Come on Yowler, let's go home.

936
01:13:34,099 --> 01:13:35,860
- You can search the world over ma'am,

937
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:37,568
but you won't find anyone that

938
01:13:37,568 --> 01:13:39,894
loves Johnny half as much as I do.

939
01:13:39,894 --> 01:13:42,702
- I don't doubt that Mrs. Cosgrove.

940
01:13:42,702 --> 01:13:45,726
But you have to be gainfully
employed to adopt a child.

941
01:13:45,726 --> 01:13:47,950
And with the death of McGowan the elder,

942
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:49,637
your job at the castle is largely

943
01:13:49,637 --> 01:13:51,536
a figment of your imagination.

944
01:13:51,536 --> 01:13:53,832
- We'll raise more sheep and we'll

945
01:13:53,832 --> 01:13:56,945
pay taxes around shearing time.

946
01:13:56,945 --> 01:13:58,967
Oh look, there they are!

947
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:00,903
They're a good 10 minutes ahead.

948
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,945
- Let's go MacDuf, after them!

949
01:14:02,945 --> 01:14:05,195
- You've slowed me down enough already.

950
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:08,459
I've got to go now and
stop those rabble rousers!

951
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:10,223
- Oh no you don't.

952
01:14:10,223 --> 01:14:12,548
You're not leaving me alone out here.

953
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:14,079
- You're not alone.

954
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:15,912
MacDuf knows the way home.

955
01:14:15,912 --> 01:14:17,853
Get along MacDuf!

956
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,148
- Stay where you are MacDuf!

957
01:14:19,148 --> 01:14:22,724
- I've got to find Johnny and
bring him home safe and sound.

958
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:25,853
You and me can fight over him later!

959
01:14:25,853 --> 01:14:26,936
Home, MacDuf!

960
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:31,503
- After her MacDuf, giddy up!

961
01:14:31,503 --> 01:14:32,920
Come on, come on.

962
01:14:37,177 --> 01:14:41,344
- Now, if I can just find a
ley line I can get us home.

963
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:51,371
(men shouting)

964
01:14:59,665 --> 01:15:00,748
(horse neighing)

965
01:15:00,748 --> 01:15:03,115
- [Douglas] Now who do
you suppose that is?

966
01:15:03,115 --> 01:15:05,115
- Never seen him before?

967
01:15:08,176 --> 01:15:10,104
- Good day to you sir.

968
01:15:10,104 --> 01:15:12,948
Have you seen a dragon about?

969
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:15,698
(horse neighing)

970
01:15:28,735 --> 01:15:30,884
That's a fine how-do-you-do.

971
01:15:30,884 --> 01:15:34,051
- Look there, it's the widow Cosgrove!

972
01:15:35,836 --> 01:15:39,222
- Hold it right there Douglas McCoy!

973
01:15:39,222 --> 01:15:40,519
- What she's saying?

974
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:43,044
- Put down your weapons
men and listen to me.

975
01:15:43,044 --> 01:15:45,553
- Damn right we were missin' ya, ma'am.

976
01:15:45,553 --> 01:15:48,289
We'd begun to fear the dragon
had eaten the both of ya.

977
01:15:48,289 --> 01:15:49,926
- Quit flappin' your tongue Douglas

978
01:15:49,926 --> 01:15:51,740
before you make matters worse!

979
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,813
I need your help to find my boy Johnny.

980
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:56,910
- Have you not heard ma'am?

981
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:00,344
Your boy Johnny's been
eaten by the dragon!

982
01:16:00,344 --> 01:16:01,908
- You dunderheads!

983
01:16:01,908 --> 01:16:04,748
That dragon's no danger to you.

984
01:16:04,748 --> 01:16:08,344
It's the Dark Knight
we have to reckon with.

985
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:10,081
- Dark Knight you say?

986
01:16:10,081 --> 01:16:11,983
- From the old fairytale?

987
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:14,708
- Don't you worry about that dragon ma'am.

988
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:17,304
We'll stop him before nightfall.

989
01:16:17,304 --> 01:16:19,153
Right men?
(cheering)

990
01:16:19,153 --> 01:16:22,070
Come on lads, the time's a wasting.

991
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:25,924
- Classic mob mentality.

992
01:16:25,924 --> 01:16:28,021
Didn't listen to a word you said.

993
01:16:28,021 --> 01:16:31,988
- Oh it's not the mob ma'am,
it's the men of the region.

994
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:34,596
Stubborn lot of jackasses.

995
01:16:34,596 --> 01:16:37,053
Present company excluded, MacDuf.

996
01:16:37,053 --> 01:16:39,734
Come on, we've got to keep up with them.

997
01:16:39,734 --> 01:16:42,528
- I think you'll be needing
this more than I will,

998
01:16:42,528 --> 01:16:43,986
Mrs. Cosgrove.

999
01:16:43,986 --> 01:16:46,509
But mind you, warning shots only,

1000
01:16:46,509 --> 01:16:48,094
and no aiming at people.

1001
01:16:48,094 --> 01:16:50,081
And in regards to Jonathon,

1002
01:16:50,081 --> 01:16:52,445
we are still legal adversaries.

1003
01:16:52,445 --> 01:16:55,695
- Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way.

1004
01:16:59,812 --> 01:17:02,746
- Walk on MacDuf!
(MacDuf baying)

1005
01:17:02,746 --> 01:17:03,579
Walk on!

1006
01:17:08,807 --> 01:17:12,344
(Yowler murmuring)

1007
01:17:12,344 --> 01:17:14,477
- One step at a time, Yowler.

1008
01:17:14,477 --> 01:17:16,843
We just have to pick
up that other ley line.

1009
01:17:16,843 --> 01:17:17,676
Over there!

1010
01:17:17,676 --> 01:17:19,802
(yowling)

1011
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:21,754
What is it boy?

1012
01:17:21,754 --> 01:17:24,566
(men shouting)

1013
01:17:24,566 --> 01:17:25,775
Hide Yowler!

1014
01:17:25,775 --> 01:17:26,608
Quickly!

1015
01:17:28,799 --> 01:17:30,717
- [Douglas] Look men, the dragon!

1016
01:17:30,717 --> 01:17:32,800
It's got the McGowan lad!

1017
01:17:34,511 --> 01:17:37,331
- Mr. Kimison, Mr. McCoy!

1018
01:17:37,331 --> 01:17:40,231
I'll ask you to keep your distance, sir!

1019
01:17:40,231 --> 01:17:43,787
- Don't worry Johnny,
we're coming to the rescue!

1020
01:17:43,787 --> 01:17:45,635
(yowling)

1021
01:17:45,635 --> 01:17:47,889
- Hush Yowler, don't aggravate them!

1022
01:17:47,889 --> 01:17:50,056
(yowling)

1023
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:54,184
- Johnny!

1024
01:17:54,184 --> 01:17:55,672
- Mrs. Cosgrove!

1025
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:56,505
- Johnny!

1026
01:17:58,945 --> 01:18:01,117
(Yowler murmuring)

1027
01:18:01,117 --> 01:18:04,117
- Quiet Yowler, don't be a nuisance!

1028
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,737
Grandpa, help us!

1029
01:18:11,474 --> 01:18:15,164
- This is a bonny place
to make a stand, lad.

1030
01:18:15,164 --> 01:18:18,625
You've got the part of the ley
lines working in your favor.

1031
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:20,014
- But what good are the ley lines

1032
01:18:20,014 --> 01:18:22,254
against the likes of Mr. McCoy?

1033
01:18:22,254 --> 01:18:23,921
And the Dark Knight?

1034
01:18:24,891 --> 01:18:28,227
- You can fight fire with fire, lad.

1035
01:18:28,227 --> 01:18:30,111
And magic with magic.

1036
01:18:30,111 --> 01:18:31,696
But there's only one way you can

1037
01:18:31,696 --> 01:18:34,041
fight hatred and misunderstanding,

1038
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:35,874
and that is with love.

1039
01:18:36,942 --> 01:18:39,181
You've got the power Johnny,

1040
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:42,911
because your heart is full of love.

1041
01:18:42,911 --> 01:18:44,661
- Johnny hold on lad!

1042
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:50,569
- Johnny, don't tell Mrs.
Cosgrove you've seen me like this.

1043
01:18:51,832 --> 01:18:53,397
I reckon she might have a hard

1044
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:55,747
time getting used to the idea.

1045
01:18:55,747 --> 01:18:56,997
- Grandpa wait!

1046
01:18:58,094 --> 01:19:01,029
- Do not mourn my passing, Johnny.

1047
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:05,418
Wandering these moors
is a fine fate for me.

1048
01:19:05,418 --> 01:19:07,418
I'll be seeing you, lad.

1049
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:11,536
(yowling)

1050
01:19:11,536 --> 01:19:14,485
(men shouting)

1051
01:19:14,485 --> 01:19:17,391
- [Douglas] Have at thee!

1052
01:19:17,391 --> 01:19:18,964
- [Mr. Kimison] Come on lads!

1053
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:21,185
- Don't fret Johnny, help's at hand!

1054
01:19:21,185 --> 01:19:23,391
- You there, stand back!

1055
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,058
- Stop, don't shoot!

1056
01:19:26,376 --> 01:19:28,242
- Hold your fire men.

1057
01:19:28,242 --> 01:19:29,471
Let's get the boy out.

1058
01:19:29,471 --> 01:19:31,249
- Cowardly beast.

1059
01:19:31,249 --> 01:19:32,082
- Fan out!

1060
01:19:38,853 --> 01:19:42,103
- Please, don't point those guns at us!

1061
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:46,020
This dragon happens to be my friend.

1062
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:48,600
Drop your weapons and leave us be!

1063
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,916
- Run for it Johnny!

1064
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:51,416
Now's your chance!

1065
01:19:55,942 --> 01:19:58,442
- Drop your gun Douglas McCoy.

1066
01:20:00,184 --> 01:20:01,261
(laughing)

1067
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:04,344
- You're not going to shoot me, Lila.

1068
01:20:06,524 --> 01:20:10,462
- I wouldn't be too sure
about that if I were you.

1069
01:20:10,462 --> 01:20:13,306
- Dinnae risk it ma'am, let
the menfolk handle this!

1070
01:20:13,306 --> 01:20:16,984
- And you men, you'd
better behave yourself.

1071
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:20,401
Or you'll be answering to my blunderbuss!

1072
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:32,866
- Yow.

1073
01:20:33,739 --> 01:20:36,656
(thunder rumbling)

1074
01:20:38,112 --> 01:20:40,279
- [Man] Light the torches.

1075
01:20:46,362 --> 01:20:48,704
- Don't lose your spirit lads!

1076
01:20:48,704 --> 01:20:51,371
It's only a bit of foul weather.

1077
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,049
(horse neighing)

1078
01:20:56,049 --> 01:20:58,049
(gasps)

1079
01:21:01,098 --> 01:21:03,637
- There's that tin plated rascal now.

1080
01:21:03,637 --> 01:21:05,534
(yowling)

1081
01:21:05,534 --> 01:21:07,042
- Stop it Yowler!

1082
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:08,209
Get behind me!

1083
01:21:18,613 --> 01:21:21,655
- I'm not shooting my
rifle into a fairy ring.

1084
01:21:21,655 --> 01:21:24,988
- And I'm not taking on the Dark Knight.

1085
01:21:30,621 --> 01:21:32,947
- The book is mine.

1086
01:21:32,947 --> 01:21:35,079
- Not any more sir!

1087
01:21:35,079 --> 01:21:37,246
- The book and the dragon.

1088
01:21:38,492 --> 01:21:40,242
Give them to me, now.

1089
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,462
- One step closer and I'll shoot!

1090
01:21:50,462 --> 01:21:52,397
I'm warnin' you!

1091
01:21:52,397 --> 01:21:55,730
One more inch and I'll pull the trigger!

1092
01:21:59,264 --> 01:22:01,431
You asked for it MacClain!

1093
01:22:06,071 --> 01:22:08,988
- I grant your death wish now, lad.

1094
01:22:10,906 --> 01:22:13,739
- You want your stinkin' old book?

1095
01:22:14,811 --> 01:22:16,900
Come and get it!

1096
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:17,733
- No!

1097
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,214
- Did you know sir?

1098
01:22:31,214 --> 01:22:35,381
This is the very spot where
two ley lines converge.

1099
01:22:38,645 --> 01:22:41,562
(thunder rumbling)

1100
01:23:15,501 --> 01:23:17,349
- You've done it, Johnny!

1101
01:23:17,349 --> 01:23:20,194
You've defeated the Dark Knight!

1102
01:23:20,194 --> 01:23:22,469
- With the power of the ley lines.

1103
01:23:22,469 --> 01:23:24,279
Just like grandpa said.

1104
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:27,969
- You've been talking with your grandpa?

1105
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:31,802
- No ma'am, I just
remember what he taught me.

1106
01:23:39,501 --> 01:23:43,084
- You and this dragon
are friends, you say?

1107
01:23:45,266 --> 01:23:47,683
(Yowler murmuring)

1108
01:23:47,683 --> 01:23:49,400
- This dragon's name is Yowler.

1109
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,077
He's my friend any my responsibility.

1110
01:23:52,077 --> 01:23:55,470
I've sworn to protect him
from the outside world.

1111
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:57,426
Now that you've all seen him too,

1112
01:23:57,426 --> 01:23:59,129
I'll ask you to help me keep his

1113
01:23:59,129 --> 01:24:02,139
existence a secret between us.

1114
01:24:02,139 --> 01:24:04,000
- Don't you worry laddie.

1115
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,513
Your secret's safe with us.

1116
01:24:06,513 --> 01:24:08,128
Ain't that right men?

1117
01:24:08,128 --> 01:24:10,119
(cheering)

1118
01:24:10,119 --> 01:24:12,024
- I appreciate it, sir.

1119
01:24:12,024 --> 01:24:13,024
- Yowler eh?

1120
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:18,261
You're a curious looking
creature, aren't you?

1121
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:20,430
(Yowler murmuring)

1122
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:23,914
- He says you're a rather curious
looking creature yourself.

1123
01:24:23,914 --> 01:24:26,164
(laughing)

1124
01:24:30,584 --> 01:24:35,008
- Well, they do say beauty is
in the eye of the beholder.

1125
01:24:35,008 --> 01:24:38,211
Is that not right Miss Churchill?

1126
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:41,570
- That has been my experience Mr. McCoy.

1127
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:43,737
(yowling)

1128
01:24:45,736 --> 01:24:46,819
Hello Yowler.

1129
01:24:48,094 --> 01:24:49,511
Evelyn Churchill.

1130
01:24:50,759 --> 01:24:52,948
Department of Child Welfare.

1131
01:24:52,948 --> 01:24:54,706
(yowling)

1132
01:24:54,706 --> 01:24:56,539
- Yowler, be nice now.

1133
01:25:01,523 --> 01:25:04,255
- Never have I witnessed
such a rousing display

1134
01:25:04,255 --> 01:25:07,257
of the maternal instinct in action.

1135
01:25:07,257 --> 01:25:09,209
- I was that mad.

1136
01:25:09,209 --> 01:25:11,626
I was like a bull seeing red.

1137
01:25:13,223 --> 01:25:15,861
- With your permission Mrs. Cosgrove,

1138
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,514
I recommend we proceed with

1139
01:25:17,514 --> 01:25:21,017
the adoption as soon as possible.

1140
01:25:21,017 --> 01:25:22,993
And in answer to your question,

1141
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:26,777
I would be happy to help
you with the paperwork.

1142
01:25:26,777 --> 01:25:30,033
It'll give me an excuse
to come back visit you.

1143
01:25:30,033 --> 01:25:31,754
- Oh yes indeed!

1144
01:25:31,754 --> 01:25:33,481
Oh thank you ma'am.

1145
01:25:33,481 --> 01:25:35,879
Did you hear that Johnny?

1146
01:25:35,879 --> 01:25:36,879
- Yes ma'am!

1147
01:25:40,408 --> 01:25:44,575
- And as for you young man,
I owe you a huge apology.

1148
01:25:46,997 --> 01:25:50,863
I was wrong, about a number of things.

1149
01:25:50,863 --> 01:25:54,695
Especially about placing you in the city.

1150
01:25:54,695 --> 01:25:56,572
That would be scarcely
be a suitable environment

1151
01:25:56,572 --> 01:26:00,155
in which to practice
your responsibilities.

1152
01:26:01,941 --> 01:26:06,018
- Thank you ma'am, for setting
everything right again.

1153
01:26:06,018 --> 01:26:08,595
- Oh Jonathon I wish I
could set everything right.

1154
01:26:08,595 --> 01:26:10,442
But unfortunately there's still the matter

1155
01:26:10,442 --> 01:26:12,436
of your grandfather's tax debt,

1156
01:26:12,436 --> 01:26:14,320
and the same with the castle.

1157
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,820
- No, it can't be!

1158
01:26:16,681 --> 01:26:18,657
- Oh that's all right.

1159
01:26:18,657 --> 01:26:23,144
Just as long as we're together,
we can weather any storm.

1160
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,394
- Thanks for your help men.

1161
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:30,710
Hey, Johnny!

1162
01:26:32,802 --> 01:26:35,948
Would you look at this, laddie?

1163
01:26:35,948 --> 01:26:38,841
A new tree sprouting from the

1164
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:41,761
very spot your grandfather died.

1165
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:44,657
- Isn't that just like Angus?

1166
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:47,664
Clinging onto life for all he's worth.

1167
01:26:47,664 --> 01:26:49,880
- I did my best grandpa.

1168
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,623
I saved Yowler and
defeated the Dark Knight.

1169
01:26:53,623 --> 01:26:56,624
But I can't save castle
McGowan from the tax men.

1170
01:26:56,624 --> 01:26:58,858
(yowling)

1171
01:26:58,858 --> 01:27:00,873
What is it Yowler?

1172
01:27:00,873 --> 01:27:02,373
What's the matter?

1173
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:04,643
Oh yes!

1174
01:27:08,042 --> 01:27:10,042
(gasps)

1175
01:27:13,794 --> 01:27:16,377
- Johnny, where'd you get this?

1176
01:27:17,634 --> 01:27:20,037
- It's the Dark Knight's treasure.

1177
01:27:20,037 --> 01:27:21,620
There's more, look!

1178
01:27:22,511 --> 01:27:26,401
- John McGowan, I do believe you're rich.

1179
01:27:26,401 --> 01:27:29,210
Rich laddie, beyond
the dreams of a-ve-rus!

1180
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,404
- Yes sir.

1181
01:27:30,404 --> 01:27:32,481
- Bless my soul.

1182
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:35,432
- Is this enough to satisfy the tax men?

1183
01:27:35,432 --> 01:27:39,154
- I should say so. (laughs)

1184
01:27:39,154 --> 01:27:40,624
- Johnny lad I think we've got

1185
01:27:40,624 --> 01:27:42,267
enough there to satisfy the tax man

1186
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:45,965
and take care of us for
a long time to come!

1187
01:27:45,965 --> 01:27:46,965
- Yes ma'am!

1188
01:27:51,069 --> 01:27:53,319
(cheering)

1189
01:28:00,353 --> 01:28:02,520
(yowling)

1190
01:28:07,571 --> 01:28:10,738
(steady Celtic music)
