1
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:06,354
(ominous music)

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,184
(man panting)

3
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:20,107
Please! Please, stop!

4
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:27,549
No!

5
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:34,556
(dramatic music)

6
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,047
(birds chirping)

7
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:57,231
(car approaching)

8
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:13,943
(keys jingling)

9
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,167
Come on, Jordyn, come join me.

10
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,518
(Jordyn) You could've pulled up
further, Mom.

11
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,086
(Sara) I know.

12
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:27,913
I guess I find it
hard to believe

13
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:29,611
it's really ours, you know?

14
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:33,310
I bet there's dead bodies
in the basement.

15
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:34,572
Oh, Jordyn.

16
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:36,313
Or the previous owner died

17
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:38,271
under mysterious circumstances.

18
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:41,013
No, he just fell behind
on payments

19
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,537
and the bank foreclosed.

20
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,152
I heard it was your big day.

21
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,719
Yeah.

22
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,894
Oh, Kendall Jones.

23
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:53,104
We met briefly at the bank.

24
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,636
I'm a local realtor.

25
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:57,029
Oh, hi, yeah.
Uh, this is my daughter, Jordyn.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,335
Oh, hi, Jordyn.

27
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,642
I wanted to bring
something for you.

28
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:03,558
Welcome to the neighborhood.

29
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:04,950
Thank you.

30
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:06,474
If you need help with anything,

31
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:07,866
just let me know.

32
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:08,866
We should have lunch sometime.

33
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:10,130
Sure.

34
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,740
How about you get settled in

35
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,524
and then give me a call?

36
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:14,656
Wonderful, thanks.

37
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,005
All right, take care.

38
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,696
- (Sara) See ya.
- (car engine turns over)

39
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:30,019
Oh, looks even bigger
than I remember it.

40
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,724
Uh, Mom,
why is there furniture here?

41
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:43,293
Because the previous owner
sold it with the house.

42
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:45,295
If the guy couldn't make
the mortgage payments,

43
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,558
why didn't he sell some of it?

44
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,605
I don't know.
But aren't we lucky?

45
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:52,172
It's beautiful.

46
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:53,738
(car horn honks)

47
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:55,175
Oh.

48
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,048
That must be the movers.
Be right back.

49
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,189
(suspenseful music)

50
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,574
(water splashing)

51
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,755
(ominous music)

52
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:04,418
Huh, weird.

53
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,271
(clears throat)

54
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,317
What?

55
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:35,231
Huh?

56
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,580
I said, "What?"

57
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,626
As in, what are you looking at?

58
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:41,977
Oh, is this some
sort of movie reference?

59
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,128
You want me to guess? Um...

60
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,719
Oh, please go.

61
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,764
Oh, wait. I...

62
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,636
How about we start again?

63
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:51,159
I'm Noah. Noah Ryan.

64
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,250
Jordyn Wilson.

65
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,773
Lovely to meet you,
Jordyn Wilson.

66
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:56,904
Did you just move here?

67
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,254
Yup.

68
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,125
(Noah)
You going to Memorial High?

69
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,302
How'd you ever guess?

70
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:03,825
You don't seem
too happy about it.

71
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:04,956
Why wouldn't I be happy?

72
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,306
Isn't it every girl's dream

73
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,873
to be dropped
into a new high school

74
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:10,614
in the middle of her senior year

75
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:11,876
knowing no one?

76
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,530
That's not true.

77
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,053
What's not?

78
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:16,838
You know me.

79
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,970
Terrific.

80
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:19,841
So I'll see you tomorrow.

81
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:20,842
On the bus?

82
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:22,060
Bus?

83
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,149
Nobody takes the bus.

84
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,586
How do you get to school?

85
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,196
I drive.

86
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:30,591
I'll be by at 8:00
to pick you up.

87
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:33,681
(dramatic music)

88
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,187
I know you like to give me
a hard time

89
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:43,691
about rarely cooking,

90
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,451
but even you have to admit
this is way better

91
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:46,868
than anything I could make.

92
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,872
Come on, Jordyn.
It's our first night here.

93
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:53,091
So?

94
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:54,919
New house, new start?

95
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,096
I just don't understand
why we had to leave.

96
00:05:58,227 --> 00:05:59,533
I didn't want to.

97
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:02,231
No, I'd say
we both needed a change.

98
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,755
Well, I didn't ask them
to suspend me.

99
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,844
You didn't have to.
Vaping on school property,

100
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,605
after they had already given you
a warning...

101
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:11,588
It was just one hit, barely one.

102
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,416
Okay. A suspension isn't exactly

103
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:16,114
a badge of honor
on a college transcript.

104
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,595
Who says
I even wanna go to college?

105
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:19,901
(sighs)

106
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,226
Okay. Can we not have
this conversation?

107
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,425
Not tonight.

108
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,558
I'm not the one
who brought it up.

109
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,430
Look, your dad and I always said

110
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,842
that you could pick
any career you want

111
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,955
as long as you go
to college first.

112
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,567
Well, at least you guys agreed
on one thing.

113
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,266
Have you talked to him recently?

114
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,311
Who, Frank?

115
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,662
Yes, your dad.

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,404
Nope.

117
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,973
So, are you excited
for tomorrow?

118
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,409
First day of school.

119
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,063
Were you planning
on taking my picture

120
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:53,630
and walking me to the bus stop?

121
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,980
I was gonna offer you a ride.

122
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,722
Actually, I already have one.

123
00:06:58,853 --> 00:06:59,853
What do you mean?

124
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:02,596
A ride for tomorrow.

125
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,162
I make friends quickly, Mom.

126
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,904
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

127
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,297
Save the rest of my pizza

128
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,430
so I can eat it
for breakfast, please?

129
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,737
Uh-hmm.

130
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,435
(dramatic music)

131
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:18,873
(crickets chirping)

132
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:29,536
(footsteps approaching)

133
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,423
(floor creaking)

134
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,428
Jordyn?

135
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,823
(ominous music)

136
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,371
(snoring)

137
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,710
(suspenseful music)

138
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,634
(birds chirping)

139
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,949
What?

140
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,623
Couldn't you wear something
a little less black

141
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:22,344
on your first day?

142
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,868
It's not my first day.
It's the middle of my last year.

143
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,697
Can I make you something to eat?
Toast you something?

144
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:29,743
No, I'll have my pizza cold.

145
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,486
Did you hear
anything last night?

146
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:35,836
Mom, where's my pizza?

147
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,098
It's in tin foil.

148
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:38,641
A creaking
in the middle of the night,

149
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:39,970
did you hear that?

150
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,421
No idea
what you're talking about.

151
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,104
And... and the pizza's not here.

152
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,845
It's on the bottom shelf.

153
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:49,153
Huh.

154
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:50,328
(doorbell dings)

155
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,765
I wonder who that is.

156
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:53,810
I told you. I have a ride.

157
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:56,596
Oh, I thought you were joking.

158
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:00,730
Can I meet whoever it is?

159
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,341
I don't wanna be late
on my first day, Mom.

160
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:04,516
But, Jordyn, I...

161
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,170
- Hey.
- Hi.

162
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,650
(Sara) But, Jordyn, I just...

163
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,480
- Uh, shouldn't I say hello?
- No.

164
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,438
- (Noah) Oh.
- (Jordyn) Let's go.

165
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,615
(Sara) Have a great day,
you guys.

166
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,053
Hmm.

167
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,933
(woman)
Hey. Let's see about that.

168
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,588
Oh, I'm sorry. I... I'm slammed.

169
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,131
I will get to the numbers
by the end of the day.

170
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:35,567
Oh my gosh,
to hell with the numbers,

171
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,245
tell me about the house.

172
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,465
Well, there's not much to tell.
I mean, you saw it.

173
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:43,251
Came with some furniture.
And now we're just unpacking,

174
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,296
you know, trying to make it
feel like ours.

175
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:47,037
But you like it, right?

176
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:50,084
I love it. I mean, Lucy,
I have an indoor pool.

177
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:53,827
I know. Which I can't wait
to swim in (indistinct)

178
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:55,611
It's a big step up
from that hovel

179
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,569
the two of you used to live in.

180
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,441
Our house was quaint.

181
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,226
It was a disaster.

182
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,533
And Ms. Jordyn, what does
she have to say about it?

183
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,056
You know Jordyn.

184
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:07,884
I mean, we could moving
into the Taj Mahal

185
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,320
and she would feel put out.

186
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,844
Well, you deserve a medal.

187
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:11,974
Why?

188
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,411
You threw your hat into the ring

189
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:14,822
and worked hard for a promotion.

190
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,676
All while shopping for a house

191
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,721
so you two could have
a new start.

192
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,897
I'm just doing
what any mother would do.

193
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,769
- (Lucy) Uh-hmm.
- Just trying to give us

194
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,641
- a better life.
- Hmm, with no help from Frank.

195
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,208
Not like he'd know how to.

196
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:29,863
Oh. I am just happy
that I don't have

197
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:32,126
to listen
to his abusive criticism,

198
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:34,824
you know, or wonder
what his ulterior motives are.

199
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,783
Oh, my gosh, he was exhausting.

200
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,306
Have you heard from him?

201
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,395
Not a word, surprisingly.

202
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:44,442
Well, enjoy it, the job,
the house, all of it.

203
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,140
- (Sara) Uh-hmm.
- You deserve it.

204
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,248
Hey, Sara, here's those numbers
that you asked for.

205
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:49,796
Thank you.

206
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:52,059
Okay. I better get back
to this report.

207
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:54,080
I took a half-day so I could
be home for Jordyn today.

208
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,237
- Oh, that's sweet. Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

209
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:57,455
(dramatic music)

210
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:00,589
(vehicle approaching)

211
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,956
(birds chirping)

212
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,611
- (door creaks open)
- (Sara sighs)

213
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:37,104
No. Okay.

214
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,106
Wow.

215
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,771
- (thuds)
- (gasps)

216
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,038
Oh.

217
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,300
(doorbell dings)

218
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,997
What'd you do with your key?

219
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:04,305
I'm sorry.
You were expecting someone else.

220
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,959
Yeah, my daughter.

221
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:08,091
Oh, uh, well,
I won't keep you long.

222
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,267
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

223
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,443
I'm Colin Murray.

224
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:15,142
Hey. Sara. Uh, Sara Wilson.

225
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:19,494
Um, can I help you?

226
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,497
Yeah, you live in my house.

227
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,847
I mean,
I've lived in your house.

228
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:28,285
I mean, you bought my old house.

229
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,157
Oh, yeah, you're the guy?

230
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:33,377
Yeah, yeah,
I was in between jobs

231
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:36,032
and I put all my savings
into maintenance, so...

232
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,556
Well, you kept the place
in great shape.

233
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,863
I mean, I can't believe
it's a hundred years old.

234
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:42,434
Those wood doors
off the living room,

235
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,911
they're gorgeous.

236
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,261
Wow. I'm so happy
you appreciate the place.

237
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,046
Yeah, right.

238
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:52,309
Well, uh, I just...
yeah, I just wanted

239
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,443
to introduce myself like I said
and I'm a contractor,

240
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,575
so if you have any questions
or need anything,

241
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,403
please, uh, feel free to call.

242
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,188
That's my number.

243
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,063
Look, I'm sorry,

244
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:08,630
I, uh...

245
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,631
I didn't just live in the house,

246
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:10,588
I grew up in it.

247
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,156
My grandfather built it.

248
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,592
Oh.

249
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:15,593
(Colin) Yeah, the, uh,
wooden doors

250
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,639
are from Barcelona.

251
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,336
He built the house
during Prohibition

252
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:22,209
and there even used to be
a Speakeasy in the basement.

253
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,472
It's not still down there,
is it?

254
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,126
Um, no.

255
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:28,215
No, the... the swimming pool area
consumed it.

256
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:29,912
Oh.

257
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:31,643
But when I was little,
there were cubbies

258
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,718
and secret doors hiding
where they kept the alcohol.

259
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:35,135
How interesting.

260
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:38,007
I have a lot of good memories
in this place.

261
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:41,619
I just wanna make sure
it's, uh, taken care of.

262
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,273
Yeah, of course.

263
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:45,319
Oh! I... I did have one question
for you.

264
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:48,757
Um, I just heard
something in the walls.

265
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,325
You didn't have a pest problem,
did you?

266
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:52,326
It sounded pretty big.

267
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:56,199
Uh, no, I didn't.

268
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,855
Okay. Well, we sure do love
the place, my daughter and I.

269
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,639
We'll do our best
to take good care of it.

270
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,554
Well, I won't keep you
any longer.

271
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,427
You have my number.
Please feel free to use it.

272
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:08,429
Thank you.

273
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,265
(scoffs)

274
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:22,356
(upbeat music on radio)

275
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:32,496
Thanks.

276
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,126
No problem.
You're right on my way home.

277
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,979
I mean for everything.

278
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,851
You made my first day
a lot easier.

279
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,897
And also for the pizza.

280
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:44,508
Oh, well, that was just me
doing my duty as a citizen.

281
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,033
You can't move here
and not eat at Angelo's.

282
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,254
I better get going.
My mom is probably

283
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,213
glued to the front door waiting.

284
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,692
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

285
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,129
Uh-hmm.

286
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,091
Listen, like I said,
I appreciate all this,

287
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:04,615
but I don't want you to think

288
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:05,941
the new girl is just some easy...

289
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,227
Uh, Jordyn,

290
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:09,533
no, I... I swear.
Not for one second.

291
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,710
(laughs)

292
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,495
I'll see you tomorrow.

293
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,412
What are you doing?

294
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,502
There was this guy standing
by the side of your house.

295
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,504
He took off around the back.

296
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:25,723
What did he look like?

297
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,421
I don't know.
It happened so fast.

298
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:30,293
Maybe someone from
the electric company or gas.

299
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,730
No. No uniform.

300
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,602
And why would he run?

301
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,952
I don't know.

302
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,910
My mom, she's in the house.

303
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,175
(suspenseful music)

304
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:54,361
Hey! Why don't you
let me go first, okay?

305
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:57,538
(suspenseful music)

306
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,471
He had plenty of time
to get away.

307
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:18,601
Get away where?

308
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,343
I don't know.

309
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,537
Into the woods over there,
or he could have gone back

310
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,346
around the house
on the other side.

311
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,001
Either way, he's not here now.

312
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,221
Let's just make sure, okay?

313
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,969
I mean, we looked everywhere.

314
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,015
But if I were you,
I'd still tell your mom.

315
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:43,671
I will, but I don't know
what she's gonna do about it.

316
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,151
You didn't get
a good look at him.

317
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,717
He moved too quickly.

318
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:49,938
God, Mom!

319
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:53,072
I'm sorry.
I just heard you guys talking.

320
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:56,858
Mom, this is Noah.

321
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,381
Uh, hello, Mrs. Wilson.

322
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,730
I just live down the road.

323
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,210
Oh, it's nice to meet you, Noah.

324
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:02,535
Why don't you guys come inside?

325
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,735
Uh, he can't.
He has to get going.

326
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:07,042
Yes, I... I... I have to get going.

327
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,784
Hmm. Could I ask a favor
before you go?

328
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:10,914
Yes, ma'am.

329
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,439
Super!

330
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:16,791
Little bit left,
and then take it

331
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:18,749
back just another inch,
and then down.

332
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,534
And just straight.

333
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,405
Oh, thank you, you guys.

334
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,886
Why are we moving it?
It looked fine before.

335
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:27,367
Oh, I just wanna make
the space feel new.

336
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,238
Yeah, it looks good.

337
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,457
Thank you, Noah.

338
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:32,502
So I'll pick you up
tomorrow morning?

339
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,548
Sure.

340
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,116
Okay.

341
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:41,859
Nice to meet you, Ms. Wilson.

342
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,339
Oh, you as well.

343
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,646
- See you tomorrow, Jordyn.
- (Jordyn) Bye.

344
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,215
He seems nice.

345
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:50,477
I guess.

346
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:51,887
Oh, don't give me
that "I guess."

347
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,412
I saw the way
you were looking at him.

348
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,308
Mom, he's the only person
I know here,

349
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:56,546
so I let him give me a ride.

350
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,225
- That's it.
- Uh-huh.

351
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,878
So how was school?

352
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:06,014
Um, Mom, how long
have you been here?

353
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,798
What do you mean?
Here at the house?

354
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,279
Maybe an hour and a half. Why?

355
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,674
Did you... hear anything?

356
00:19:13,804 --> 00:19:15,023
Yeah, I heard your voices.

357
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,851
That's why I opened
the front door.

358
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:20,028
No, no, no. Before that.
Did you hear anything else?

359
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,075
I think I might've heard
some rodents in the walls.

360
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,294
But don't worry,

361
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,078
I'm calling the exterminator.

362
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,341
Why?

363
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:30,386
Well, when Noah pulled up,

364
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:34,695
he saw some guy lurking
around the side of the house.

365
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,828
Okay. Well, the previous owner
came by

366
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,180
just to introduce himself,
but he was hardly lurking.

367
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,966
Well, Noah saw a guy run
around the side of the house.

368
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:47,229
So we tried to catch him.

369
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,883
(Sara) What? What happened?

370
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,537
He got away.

371
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:52,539
Okay.

372
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,281
You don't believe me.

373
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:56,934
No, I didn't say that.

374
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,198
I'm just wondering
if Noah saw something else

375
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:00,851
and maybe thought
it was a person.

376
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,375
He's on varsity tennis, Mom.

377
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,246
I'd say his vision
is pretty good.

378
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:07,902
It just seems odd that some guy
would be snooping around.

379
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,295
Okay.

380
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:12,341
(dramatic music)

381
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:13,821
(sighs)

382
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,651
Thanks so much
for coming back over.

383
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,218
(Colin) No problem.

384
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,874
Now they can't get in.

385
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:26,050
- So that's it?
- That's it.

386
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:28,096
I, uh, laid the traps
and filled any holes

387
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,706
they might use
to enter the house.

388
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,099
So, you should be fine.

389
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,536
Oh. I was about to call
an exterminator.

390
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,867
But then I thought, you know,
what if the noises I heard

391
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,888
wasn't animals
and it was just pipes clanking?

392
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,412
Yeah, well, I'm glad you didn't.

393
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,110
It doesn't look like
you have a pest problem to me.

394
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,591
But, uh, better safe
than sorry, right?

395
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,723
Well, thank you
for dealing with it.

396
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:48,005
You saved me some money, anyway.

397
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,031
No, it was my pleasure, really.

398
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:53,469
And Like I said,
I know this house.

399
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,558
Yeah. Great.

400
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,605
(dramatic music)

401
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:01,347
Well, hey, looks like
you're really...

402
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:02,609
getting settled in.

403
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,785
(Sara) Yeah, we're trying.

404
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:06,763
Are you sure you don't want
some coffee?

405
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,397
I was just about to make some.

406
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,965
Oh, well, I wish I could,
but I really need to get going.

407
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,359
Okay. Maybe some other time.

408
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,709
Yeah, I'd like that.

409
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,927
Okay.

410
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:20,366
- (crickets chirping)
- (owl hooting)

411
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:23,804
(ominous music)

412
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:30,941
(thuds)

413
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:39,123
(ominous music)

414
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:41,300
(door creaks open)

415
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,170
(ominous music)

416
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:57,637
(gasps)

417
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:19,049
Thanks. So how'd you sleep?

418
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,661
- Fine. You?
- (Sara) Good.

419
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:25,926
Jordyn, I need to talk to you
about something.

420
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:28,885
Mom, we had this talk
in middle school.

421
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:31,540
Plus, they bring it up every
year in health class.

422
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:36,458
No, not that. Um, did you move
the couch last night?

423
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:39,940
- What?
- I want the truth.

424
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:43,117
Mom, you asked Noah and I

425
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:45,511
to move the couch
for you yesterday.

426
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:47,077
Okay, but now it's back.

427
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,079
So I thought maybe, you know,

428
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,733
because you were irritated
with me

429
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,064
for questioning whether or not

430
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,171
you saw someone
outside the house.

431
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,435
Um, I was irritated.

432
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,088
So you moved the couch?

433
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,221
Why would I do that?

434
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:03,006
I don't know.
Maybe to make a statement?

435
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:07,097
Here's a statement.
You're crazy.

436
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,448
(sighs)

437
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:15,889
Give the kid a break.

438
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:18,065
She's had to deal
with a lot in the last year.

439
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:20,502
Count yourself lucky
she's still in school.

440
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:23,984
I know. But I just don't
understand why she would do it.

441
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,377
Maybe she's trying
to assert herself,

442
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,597
make her presence felt
in the new house.

443
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:30,164
Possibly.

444
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:32,775
Just ignore it.
It'll stop eventually.

445
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,342
Lucy, you should be a therapist.

446
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,039
Hmm. Hardly.

447
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,128
Well, I don't know
what I would do without you.

448
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:42,176
Oh.

449
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:47,834
Hey, oh, sweetie, can you hand
me that one?

450
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,524
- Uh, yeah.
- Just wanna make this place

451
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:51,925
feel a little
bit more like ours, you know?

452
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,015
- (Jordyn) What is this?
- (Sara) It's a shadow box.

453
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:56,016
You know, with memorabilia
from the house.

454
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:57,365
Huh.

455
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,908
How do you feel
about Thai food tonight?

456
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,064
Um, I'm going over to Noah's.

457
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:03,197
Oh. Will his parents be there?

458
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,372
Of course.

459
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,417
Well, you do need
to eat, sweetie.

460
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:07,897
They're gonna feed me.

461
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:10,552
We just have
a big history test tomorrow.

462
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:13,990
Oh. Are you guys...
you're dating now?

463
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,906
God, Mom. He's just a nice guy.

464
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:19,624
All right. Just wake me up
when you get home.

465
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,128
Okay.

466
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:25,611
(dramatic music)

467
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:28,831
(crickets chirping)

468
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,366
Oh.

469
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:47,720
(doorknob rattles)

470
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,983
Oh.

471
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,162
Hey, sweetie!

472
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:56,313
(Jordyn) (gasps)
Oh, God, Mom. You scared me.

473
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:57,947
I thought you'd be asleep.

474
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,820
No, I got a little preoccupied
unpacking boxes.

475
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,082
So how was studying?

476
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:03,910
It's good.

477
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,042
Great. All right.
Well, goodnight.

478
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,088
Love you. Sleep good.

479
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:09,263
You, too.

480
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:34,027
- (ominous music)
- (knocking)

481
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:57,528
- Oh!
- Come on, you guys!

482
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,182
You really scared me!

483
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,402
Uh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilson.
I was just, um...

484
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:04,927
Uh, I... I took his history book
by mistake.

485
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,103
- Oh.
- Uh, here.

486
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,802
Thank you! I should get going.

487
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:12,935
Noah. Uh, let's just use
the front door. Always, please.

488
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,197
- Of course.
- (Sara) Please.

489
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:15,503
Sorry.

490
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,898
We didn't wanna wake you up.

491
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,335
I'm sure you didn't.

492
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:24,381
Don't give me that look, Mom.

493
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:26,296
Jordyn, I'm not naive.

494
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:28,037
Let's keep the windows closed

495
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:30,649
and Noah out of the bedroom
from now on, okay?

496
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,826
- Fine.
- Great.

497
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,135
Goodnight.

498
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:43,835
(groans)

499
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,799
(birds chirping)

500
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,506
(gasps)

501
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,814
(ominous music)

502
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,316
I don't want you to panic,

503
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,274
but it sounds like
you have a poltergeist.

504
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:33,146
Stop it.

505
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,539
No, a ghost might be moving
things around in your house.

506
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,910
Okay, well, Lucy, you know that

507
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,344
I don't believe
in that sort of thing.

508
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:40,849
So there must be
some other explanation.

509
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:44,331
Well, have you asked
Jordyn about it?

510
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:47,160
I didn't want her to feel like
I was accusing her again.

511
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,031
And I guess
I didn't wanna scare her.

512
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:51,730
- Yeah. Oh.
- (phone buzzes)

513
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:53,906
I have a 10 o'clock meeting.

514
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:56,212
- We'll talk later, okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

515
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:03,045
(phone line trilling)

516
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,135
Hey, Colin.

517
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:07,702
Fine.

518
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,878
Yeah, do you have
any free time today?

519
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,275
So, do you think I'm crazy?

520
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:16,537
Oh, yes.

521
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,278
Certifiably so.

522
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:19,714
I'm serious!

523
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,847
No, I don't think you're crazy.

524
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:24,284
And I'm... I'm really glad
you called.

525
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,026
I just hoped, I don't know,

526
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:29,593
maybe you might have
some sort of explanation

527
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,334
for what's going on.

528
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:32,858
I don't.

529
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,729
And I'm finding it
a little hard to believe

530
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,035
what you're telling me.

531
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:37,485
So nothing like that
ever happened

532
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:39,778
- when you lived there?
- No.

533
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,128
Oh.

534
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:45,435
Do you...
think it could be your daughter?

535
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,136
I did at first
when the couch was moved back.

536
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:52,094
Hmm.

537
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,898
She did have a history of lying
before we moved here,

538
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,750
but she was with a friend
last night.

539
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,839
Well, maybe she and her friend.

540
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,146
I have reason to believe
that they didn't.

541
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:04,324
Did you ask her what she thought
might've happened?

542
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:07,457
I didn't wanna
scare her unnecessarily.

543
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:09,764
Look, I would suggest
going to the police.

544
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:13,550
But in this case, I'm not sure
how much they can really do.

545
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,337
I know what they'd do.
They'd think I was crazy.

546
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:20,993
Why don't I take a look around?

547
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:23,734
And see if anything strikes me
as suspicious.

548
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,345
I'd appreciate that.

549
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,608
Why don't you come over
for dinner tomorrow?

550
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:28,870
Sure.

551
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,176
Oh.

552
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:31,699
- Ooh.
- Thank you.

553
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,048
Looks good.

554
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:33,919
Can I get you guys
anything else?

555
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,049
No, thank you.

556
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:36,312
- Okay.
- All right. Yeah.

557
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,575
Sorry. Every time I call,

558
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,577
I'm either talking about me
or the house.

559
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,798
Not at all. I gave you
my number for a reason.

560
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:46,975
Okay, Colin Murray,
tell me more about,

561
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,890
I don't know, the construction
that you do.

562
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:52,024
Oh, it's mostly
residential renovations.

563
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,113
Are you renovating
your place at all?

564
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,376
A little. But I'm just
renting right now.

565
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:58,769
You know, until I'm ready
to buy again.

566
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,380
Hmm. So are you married?

567
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:02,730
No.

568
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,385
I haven't met
the right woman and...

569
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:08,605
Oh, come on, tell me.

570
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:10,216
Uh, I... I just...

571
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:12,087
I always thought that
I'd get married

572
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:14,785
and we'd live in the house.

573
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,918
Raise a family there.

574
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,070
Oh. Well, what about
your parents?

575
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,183
They're both deceased.

576
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,272
I'm so sorry.

577
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:25,535
No, uh, they had me
when they were older

578
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,842
and lived long and happy lives.

579
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:31,498
Yeah, we had some good times
at that house.

580
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:33,804
Well, I know Jordyn
and I will, too.

581
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,545
It's a special place.

582
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:40,550
Yeah, it really is.

583
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:43,858
(Sara) Lucy was right.

584
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,642
- This place is pretty good.
- Uh-hmm.

585
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:48,167
(phone ringing)

586
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:50,169
(Sara) No phones
at the table, please.

587
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:51,431
Sorry.

588
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,564
(phone ringing)

589
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:56,218
It's your dad calling you.

590
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,567
I know.

591
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,308
Have you talked to him recently?

592
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:00,570
No.

593
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,536
(Sara) Well, he's called you
three times tonight.

594
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:07,336
I mean, if he's trying
to get in touch,

595
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,101
we should just talk about it.

596
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:12,408
Mom, I haven't picked up.
Don't worry.

597
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,062
Okay. Well, I'm...

598
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:17,457
Um, I have an English paper
to finish, so...

599
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:19,067
Okay. Sure.

600
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,244
(sighs)

601
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:27,423
- (crickets chirping)
- (ominous music)

602
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:43,700
(knocking)

603
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,137
Ugh.

604
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,662
(knocking)

605
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,142
Not again.

606
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,975
(ominous music)

607
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:11,641
(gasps)

608
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,470
Noah?

609
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:25,873
Noah?

610
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,619
Frank?

611
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:35,100
Hey, Sara.

612
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,971
What are you doing here?

613
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,278
I was hoping to see
our daughter.

614
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:41,541
In the middle of the night?

615
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:44,109
I keep calling her, but...

616
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,459
that girl, she, uh...

617
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,330
she sure knows
how to hold a grudge.

618
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:50,245
Wonder where she gets that from.

619
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:51,696
If you wanna talk
to our daughter,

620
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:53,814
you have to contact me
per our court order.

621
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:58,123
And if I had,
you'd let me see her?

622
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:02,301
If you do this again,
I'm gonna call the police.

623
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,911
No need.

624
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,391
I'm going.

625
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:12,398
You're looking good, though.

626
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:13,920
Oh.

627
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,358
Who's Noah?

628
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:19,360
Frank, get out of here.

629
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,234
Okay.

630
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:26,411
(dramatic music)

631
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:42,949
When I asked
for something to drink,

632
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,170
I thought you'd bring me, like,
seltzer or something.

633
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,607
Oh! You deserve better
than bubbly water.

634
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:49,043
- (Jordyn) Uh-huh.
- Plus,

635
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,871
your mom was,
like, "No alcohol."

636
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:52,544
Except for this whiskey I found
in the back of a cupboard.

637
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:55,179
Yeah,
she's not much of a drinker.

638
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,834
Anyways, let's toast?

639
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,749
- To having an indoor pool.
- Yeah.

640
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:05,581
- Oh!
- You don't like it?

641
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:06,713
Um, not really,

642
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:08,280
uh, but I need something

643
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,630
- to help me get through tonight.
- What's tonight?

644
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:13,111
My mom is having the guy

645
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,243
who used to live here
over for dinner.

646
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:17,593
Should be good and boring.

647
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:23,643
(indistinct chatter)

648
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,522
I'm sorry I'm late, Lucy.

649
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:34,653
Oh, my God.

650
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:36,482
So, tell me everything.

651
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:39,137
Did Frank really show up
last night?

652
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,269
Tapping on Jordyn's window,

653
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,029
to wake her up
in the middle of the night,

654
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:44,533
to talk to her.

655
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,884
I mean, if he just wants
a relationship

656
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:49,321
with Jordyn though,

657
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:50,670
maybe that's a good thing.

658
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,889
Hmm, maybe.

659
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,022
I just can't tell
if that's the only thing.

660
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:58,112
Wait, do you think
he's been breaking in

661
00:35:58,243 --> 00:35:59,809
and doing those things?

662
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,071
It's entirely possible.

663
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:03,422
Maybe he's desperate.

664
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:04,901
Maybe.

665
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:07,034
Oh, before I forget,

666
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,472
I got an extra house key
made for you.

667
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:13,127
Just in case I lock myself out.

668
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:15,260
Or need me to swim in your pool.

669
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,783
(both laughing)

670
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:17,914
- Or that.
- Yeah.

671
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,133
Anytime.

672
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,544
(Jordyn)
I just need to make sure

673
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:21,962
I'm back in time
for that dinner.

674
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:23,224
(Noah) Just a few more hours

675
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:25,444
of studying at my place,
I promise.

676
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:26,706
Yeah.

677
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:29,709
Dad?

678
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,624
Hey, kiddo.

679
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:34,496
- Who's this?
- Uh, Noah Ryan, sir.

680
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:39,284
You're not supposed to be here.

681
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,025
Look, you're my daughter.

682
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:43,810
I have to see you.

683
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,060
Well, you should have
thought of that before you left.

684
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:47,901
Come on, sweetheart.

685
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,729
I know you.

686
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,993
Let's cut the angry
teenager routine.

687
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:56,518
I have nothing to say to you.

688
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:57,737
Let's go.

689
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:00,479
Jordyn?

690
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:02,655
Come on.

691
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:03,960
Jordyn!

692
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:07,399
(dramatic music)

693
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:23,893
I told you last night

694
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,460
- to stay away.
- Yeah, I know.

695
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:27,288
I just thought
I'd give it one last shot.

696
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:29,551
- Are you stalking our house?
- What?

697
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:33,251
No, I just... I just wanted an
opportunity to talk to Jordyn.

698
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,123
Clearly, she doesn't want to.

699
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:40,997
Okay, so you're not sneaking in
and moving things around on us?

700
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,564
I'm trying to make contact.

701
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,523
Not scare her.

702
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,268
Why? Is something going on?
Is someone bothering you?

703
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,575
No, no, we're fine. Never mind.

704
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:55,229
Are you sure? You two are safe?

705
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,537
- We're fine.
- I could help.

706
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,297
The best way you can help
right now, Frank,

707
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,931
is by staying away.

708
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:08,460
Fair enough.

709
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,245
You know, it takes time
to earn trust back.

710
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:12,681
So just give her some space.

711
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:14,727
Fine.

712
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:16,424
I'll keep my distance.

713
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,948
Until she is ready.

714
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:25,781
(dramatic music)

715
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:39,360
So, what, is this guy
like your boyfriend now?

716
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:40,622
Boyfriend?

717
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:42,320
Please. He's just a nice guy.

718
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,582
You know, like Noah.

719
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,148
(doorbell rings)

720
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,324
Oh!

721
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:50,850
- (Colin) Hi.
- (Sara) Hi.

722
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,112
(Colin) I hope I'm not late.

723
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:54,332
(Sara) Not at all. Come on in.

724
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:58,814
I know you said
not to bring anything,

725
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,729
but I couldn't come
empty-handed.

726
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,905
God forbid.

727
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,733
(Sara) Thank you.

728
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:06,518
Colin, this is my daughter,
Jordyn.

729
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:08,520
Hi, Jordyn.
And pleased to meet you.

730
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,730
I've heard a lot about you.

731
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,784
Oh, great.

732
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:13,351
Come on. Have a seat.

733
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,354
Well, she's looking good.

734
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,359
Oh, yeah, the house.

735
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:23,665
Oh, yes, the house.

736
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:29,454
Anyway, so, uh, Jordyn,
how do you like your new school?

737
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:31,586
Um, same as my last one.

738
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:33,458
I don't.

739
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:34,633
Can I get you some wine?

740
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:36,069
Please.

741
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,464
Jordyn, what do you make
of the latest

742
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:40,987
occurrence in the house?

743
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:44,817
What occurrence?

744
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,036
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her about that yet.

745
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,561
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.

746
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:53,478
Oh, it's just that some things
we moved again.

747
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:56,481
And you think I did it?

748
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:59,179
Did you... do it?

749
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:02,182
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry. I overstepped.

750
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:04,053
It's just that
your mother and I, we were...

751
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:07,143
We were just looking
for a rational explanation.

752
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:08,274
For what?

753
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:09,668
Uh, the fact that the shadow box

754
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:11,670
is hanging up again
after I took it down

755
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,106
a few nights ago.

756
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:15,325
Oh, well, well, busted!
You got me!

757
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,303
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I really just don't like seeing

758
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:20,113
shadow boxes mistreated.

759
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,334
Ridiculous.

760
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:26,032
Wow, I apologize.

761
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:27,250
I didn't mean to...

762
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:29,078
She's just an angry teenager

763
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,428
who's been through a lot.

764
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:34,562
You know, my husband...
my ex-husband,

765
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:35,781
he was pretty rough.

766
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,173
I mean, not, uh, physically,

767
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,437
but just not the nicest of guys.

768
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:42,396
He used to put us
both down a lot.

769
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:46,400
And then, one day, he just left.

770
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:49,272
That's terrible. I'm sorry.

771
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,554
You know,
he came by this morning,

772
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:53,668
so I know that's why
she's upset.

773
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:55,365
Makes sense.

774
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,324
You would think
that this whole situation

775
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,848
would bring us closer together,
but...

776
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:02,242
- Have you ever thought...
- A therapy?

777
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:03,635
Uh, yeah, we've had therapy.

778
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:06,246
No. No.
Have you ever thought that...

779
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:10,032
well, you know,
maybe it's your ex-husband

780
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:11,947
doing these things?

781
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:16,648
Yeah, I did, but not anymore.

782
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,302
Mom, where are the paper towels?

783
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:21,348
What happened? Something spill?

784
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,264
Um, yeah,
just my entire plate of pasta.

785
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:25,874
Okay. Let me grab a towel.

786
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:27,441
Hang tight.

787
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,313
(Colin) Hey. Jordyn, uh,

788
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:32,185
why don't you sit for a sec?

789
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,014
Why?

790
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:36,252
Oh, just hoping
maybe we could have

791
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,800
a moment together to connect.

792
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,411
Okay. Um, let me guess,

793
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:44,197
you're gonna tell me
how much my mom means to you,

794
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:46,678
and how you understand
that it's hard for me

795
00:41:46,808 --> 00:41:48,767
to see her with another man.

796
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:50,377
Oh, wait! No, no, no, no.

797
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,860
It's totally that you know
how much I mean to my mom,

798
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,080
and how I now mean a lot to you.

799
00:41:58,211 --> 00:42:00,126
Am I getting close?

800
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:03,259
Actually, I was gonna tell you
to stop being so ungrateful

801
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,045
that you get to live
in this house.

802
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:12,704
Okay, well, your, uh, comforter
is in the wash.

803
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,750
Just make yourself
another plate, okay?

804
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,404
I'm good.

805
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:21,060
Uh-hmm.

806
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,452
Oh, sorry about that.

807
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,845
Where were we?

808
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:24,803
You want some salad?

809
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,326
Sure.

810
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,242
Looks good.

811
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:35,553
Thank you for
such a lovely dinner tonight.

812
00:42:35,683 --> 00:42:38,425
Oh, thank you for checking out
the house for me.

813
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,383
Yeah, the doors
and locks are secure.

814
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:41,994
No one's getting in here.

815
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:43,125
Thank you.

816
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:45,258
Oh, hang on! Hey!

817
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:52,091
- What's this?
- It's just a small thank you.

818
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:55,877
This is the, uh,
Prohibition Amendment,

819
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:57,313
written on the side there.

820
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:58,604
I saw it at this little shop,

821
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:00,142
and it just made me
think of you,

822
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:02,449
because of the house's history.

823
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,930
Wow.

824
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,148
Thank you.

825
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:07,889
It's my pleasure.

826
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,675
And I'm so sorry
about Jordyn's behavior tonight.

827
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:13,939
Oh, well, we were all
teenagers once, right?

828
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:15,767
Yes. That, we were.

829
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:20,641
It's not just that
he's on her side, Noah.

830
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:22,774
I am telling you
there is something

831
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:25,385
really off about this guy.

832
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:26,516
How so?

833
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,170
(Jordyn)
I feel like he's using her

834
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:30,825
to get his house back
or something.

835
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:32,610
Or maybe he just likes her.

836
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,177
Oh, my God. Ugh!

837
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,266
I'm watching them
talk outside right now.

838
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:38,964
I bet she wants him to kiss her.

839
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:40,095
(chuckles)

840
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:41,662
(Jordyn) It's pathetic.

841
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:43,316
- Ew.
- Oh.

842
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:45,710
Uh, my mom's calling.

843
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,885
I got to go, okay?

844
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:48,190
Okay.

845
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:49,496
See you tomorrow.

846
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,631
We should do this again.

847
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:55,652
Yeah. I mean, I would love to
have you over at my place,

848
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:58,200
but, uh, not really nice enough
for entertaining.

849
00:43:58,331 --> 00:43:59,637
Oh, that's okay.

850
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,092
I mean, really,
I just wanted to say

851
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,683
thank you for the advice and...

852
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:05,095
But I would love to take you out
to a restaurant sometime.

853
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:07,427
I mean, if you'd like.

854
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:10,691
Yeah, I'd like that very much.

855
00:44:10,822 --> 00:44:11,823
Okay.

856
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:16,044
Well, good night.

857
00:44:16,175 --> 00:44:17,959
Good night.

858
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,657
- Bye.
- Bye.

859
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:26,359
(dramatic music)

860
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:40,373

Good morning.

867
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:44,497
I said good morning.

868
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:48,327
Do you wanna at least talk
about last night?

869
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:52,331
- No.
- Jordyn, please.

870
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:54,899
Mom, your creepy new boyfriend

871
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:56,944
called me ungrateful

872
00:46:57,075 --> 00:46:59,555
because I am not thrilled
about living in this house.

873
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:02,123
Well, I... I'm sure
he didn't call you ungrateful.

874
00:47:02,254 --> 00:47:05,735
He was probably just urging you
to appreciate living here.

875
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:08,738
No. Mom, he did,

876
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:11,524
and he was weird
and mean about it.

877
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:14,614
Can you not do this?

878
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:17,008
I mean, I really want us
to have a new start.

879
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:20,098
A new start would be you
starting to trust me.

880
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:23,188
Okay, you lied to me
about drinking and vaping.

881
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:25,103
Oh, my God,
that was just a phase.

882
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:26,669
And I'm over it.

883
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,411
Well, it takes a minute
to earn trust back, okay?

884
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:31,849
Even the people
you love the most.

885
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,853
Oh, and take Noah's camera
back to him.

886
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:37,202
That's not Noah's.

887
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:40,640
- Whose is it?
- I don't know. Colin's?

888
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,033
Uh, that's not Colin's.

889
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:43,643
He didn't bring that
over last night.

890
00:47:43,773 --> 00:47:46,733
God! I hate this house.

891
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:52,391
(dramatic music)

892
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:26,904
So, it doesn't actually work?

893
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:30,951
Uh, no. These cables,
they weren't even plugged in,

894
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:35,216
so I don't think that camera
can record anything.

895
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:37,673
You know,
I remember admiring this tree

896
00:48:37,697 --> 00:48:39,525
when I bought the house.

897
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:41,353
I feel like I would've
noticed that.

898
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:43,964
And you didn't install anything
when you lived here?

899
00:48:44,095 --> 00:48:45,705
Uh, no.

900
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,596
I didn't install any
security cameras around here.

901
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,448
I never felt like
I needed them, so.

902
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:51,841
What do you think
it's doing up there?

903
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:55,628
Well, maybe the bank thought
they should have one,

904
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:57,108
when they were
showing the place,

905
00:48:57,238 --> 00:49:00,154
and then, you know,
just forgot to remove it.

906
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:02,200
Okay. So no one's watching me?

907
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:03,679
Watching you?

908
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:04,898
Uh, no.

909
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:07,074
That camera
looks pretty inactive.

910
00:49:07,205 --> 00:49:08,510
Oh. I... I'm sorry.

911
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:10,164
You must think
I'm out of my mind.

912
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:11,861
Not at all.

913
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:13,143
I think you're just getting
used to a new house

914
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,473
and all its quirks.

915
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:16,170
I hope I didn't
mess up your morning

916
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:18,694
by calling you here,
for basically nothing.

917
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:22,089
It's no problem. Really.
I'm happy to help.

918
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,874
And, I was close by, so...

919
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:26,659
Okay.

920
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:31,098
(Lucy)
So are you becoming a thing?

921
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:33,231
Yeah, I like him.

922
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:35,276
Like him, like him?

923
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:37,104
What are we, in junior high?

924
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:40,934
To be honest,
it's just nice to have someone.

925
00:49:41,065 --> 00:49:42,283
Of course it is.

926
00:49:42,414 --> 00:49:44,155
And not just for companionship,

927
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,158
because of the house.

928
00:49:47,288 --> 00:49:48,986
It's still freaking you out?

929
00:49:50,465 --> 00:49:52,554
I feel like someone
is inside the house watching me.

930
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:54,078
I found a camera this morning

931
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:56,123
that neither Jordyn nor I
have ever seen.

932
00:49:56,254 --> 00:49:58,560
It doesn't make any sense.

933
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:01,041
I need to come over
and burn some sage.

934
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,828
- That's not necessary, Lucy.
- No, it wouldn't hurt.

935
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:08,048
Jordyn told me this morning
that she hates the house.

936
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:09,963
She wished
we'd never moved there.

937
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:12,748
She's just angry.

938
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:14,837
Maybe.

939
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:16,187
Oh.

940
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,195
- Oh!
- What you need is proof.

941
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:27,894
Of what? That there's something
messed up about this house?

942
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,069
Sure.

943
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,549
It's just,

944
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:33,247
now that she's dating Colin,

945
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:36,555
ugh, and he's, like,
in love with this place,

946
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:39,645
so she feels
like she needs to be too.

947
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:43,257
I just... I wanted to see
how twisted he is.

948
00:50:43,388 --> 00:50:44,867
Yeah.

949
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:51,526
Hey, we should find out
where he lives and follow him.

950
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:53,789
- Why?
- Because I bet he does

951
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,141
something creepy and we can
use it against him.

952
00:50:57,271 --> 00:50:58,838
Come on.

953
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:00,492
Isn't your mom
gonna be home soon?

954
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:02,581
Nope. We have time.

955
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,933
There's nothing on this guy.

956
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:10,589
There's a racecar driver
with the same name.

957
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:12,808
Hey, click on that site.

958
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:14,332
No, you have to pay
for that one.

959
00:51:14,462 --> 00:51:16,334
I'll pay for it.

960
00:51:16,464 --> 00:51:17,770
Okay.

961
00:51:18,684 --> 00:51:19,989
Here's my card.

962
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,358
And we don't have
a lot of homework,

963
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:22,794
so we can go
check out his place later.

964
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:24,516
(Jordyn) Yeah, good idea.

965
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:26,170
(Noah) Great.

966
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:32,480
(Jordyn) Okay. Here we go.

967
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:35,701
Just type in his name and...

968
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:38,704
check this out.

969
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:40,662
That's my address.

970
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:44,101
(tense music)

971
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:53,588
Maybe it's just not
the right house for us.

972
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:55,068
I mean, it's so lovely

973
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,350
and it has everything
we could want but...

974
00:51:56,374 --> 00:51:58,550
Yeah, houses are like people.

975
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,509
You click with some
and not with others,

976
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,295
and sometimes for no
discernable reason.

977
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,514
I gotta be honest,

978
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:09,126
there's been some
strange things happening.

979
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:12,303
What kind of strange things?

980
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:15,871
Things being moved
like furniture

981
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:18,178
and I've heard noises. I...

982
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:21,312
Like you think
the house is haunted?

983
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:25,794
I usually don't believe
in things like that.

984
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:27,666
But I don't know what to think.

985
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:30,016
I mean,
there's no good explanation.

986
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,585
Well, your house
should be a place

987
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:35,848
where you can relax

988
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:39,068
and... and you're able
to be yourself.

989
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,418
Exactly.

990
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:42,681
I feel like that's
what we're missing.

991
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:45,249
Yeah. I know.

992
00:52:45,379 --> 00:52:47,120
I've sold enough houses
to enough people

993
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,035
to know that a home

994
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,690
is a place you need
to feel safe.

995
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:54,823
You and Jordyn,
you deserve a place

996
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:56,608
that you can feel comfortable.

997
00:52:56,738 --> 00:52:58,610
Yeah.

998
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,699
You know,
if you're interested in selling,

999
00:53:00,829 --> 00:53:03,397
I could find plenty of buyers.

1000
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:04,528
Really?

1001
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:05,921
Oh, for sure.

1002
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:08,663
It's a historic home
with an indoor pool.

1003
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:11,057
Now, you will lose equity

1004
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,451
but you should get
your money back.

1005
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:15,061
It could be worth it.

1006
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:19,239
Okay. Okay.

1007
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:20,675
Great.

1008
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:22,677
Well, I'll go ahead
and send you some links

1009
00:53:22,808 --> 00:53:25,550
to some properties in the area
you might be interested in.

1010
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,815
Thank you, Kendall.
Gosh, I really appreciate that.

1011
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:31,643
It's my pleasure.

1012
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:35,081
(dramatic music)

1013
00:53:47,398 --> 00:53:49,661
- (knocks on door)
- (Jordyn) Hey, Mom?

1014
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,315
(Sara) Yeah.

1015
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:54,405
Uh, Noah is picking me up.

1016
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:56,363
We're going to the varsity
basketball game.

1017
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:58,191
Great. Is your homework done?

1018
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:00,324
Uh, I won't be late.

1019
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:01,716
Okay.

1020
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:08,332
Mom, um, how much do you know
about that Colin guy?

1021
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,526
(Sara) I mean, plenty, you know,

1022
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,423
for getting to know someone
at this stage.

1023
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:16,165
But you've never been
to his place?

1024
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:18,429
Yeah. I... I think
he's embarrassed by it.

1025
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:26,524
Um, well, I looked him up
online today

1026
00:54:26,654 --> 00:54:31,485
and this address was listed
for where he lives.

1027
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:33,748
You can't totally trust
an internet search.

1028
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:37,926
Yeah, but I went to, like,
a legit fancy site

1029
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:39,928
that you have to pay for.

1030
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:41,452
Well, he used to live here,

1031
00:54:41,582 --> 00:54:42,777
so maybe they haven't updated
the records yet.

1032
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:45,194
No, because we were listed
as living here

1033
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:47,936
and we just moved in.

1034
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:50,765
Hmm, that's a little strange.

1035
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:55,596
(Jordyn)
What if he lives in his car?

1036
00:54:55,727 --> 00:54:59,470
And the reason why
he's always here is because...

1037
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,081
he doesn't have a place to live?

1038
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:04,692
I don't get that impression

1039
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:07,739
but you're right,
I am still getting to know him.

1040
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:10,785
Just be careful.

1041
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:13,353
I know you're being protective
for me, sweetie.

1042
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:15,573
And I really appreciate it.

1043
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:17,444
Okay, but I also know

1044
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:19,968
that he's the first guy
that I've seen since your dad.

1045
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,580
- Probably...
- Never mind.

1046
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,451
Listen, go have fun tonight,
okay?

1047
00:55:24,582 --> 00:55:25,974
Enjoy the game.

1048
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:27,996
I'm gonna go to bed soon anyway.
Do you have your key?

1049
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,630
Yeah.

1050
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:31,676
Okay. Have fun.

1051
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:34,243
(Jordyn) Love you.

1052
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:37,638
(suspenseful music)

1053
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:46,691
(ominous music)

1054
00:56:51,016 --> 00:56:53,845
(Colin) There was a loose wire
to the breaker box.

1055
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:55,455
It happens.

1056
00:56:55,586 --> 00:56:58,284
The whole thing
is really disconcerting.

1057
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,808
I think maybe I should
call the cops.

1058
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:04,072
I agree, the picture is weird
and disturbing

1059
00:57:04,203 --> 00:57:07,511
but it's not really a crime.

1060
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:10,862
I'm still shaking.
Jordyn's gonna be home soon.

1061
00:57:10,992 --> 00:57:12,603
I don't want her
to see me like this.

1062
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,692
Let me go see
if I can find something

1063
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:16,258
to calm your nerves.

1064
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:29,533
You're still up?

1065
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:31,535
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1066
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:37,062
Well, the pantry cabinet
definitely needs some WD40.

1067
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:39,499
Oh. Hi, Jordyn.

1068
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,675
Hi.

1069
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:43,068
Thank you.

1070
00:57:43,198 --> 00:57:45,244
Mom, is everything okay?

1071
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:47,594
Yeah. I just had a little scare.

1072
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:49,466
(Jordyn) Well, what was it?

1073
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:53,644
Um, there was a painting left
at the front door.

1074
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:02,827
Oh, my God!

1075
00:58:02,957 --> 00:58:04,568
That is so messed up!

1076
00:58:04,698 --> 00:58:06,831
Jordyn, I don't want us
to overreact.

1077
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,397
Overreact?

1078
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:09,940
You're drinking whiskey
which you never do

1079
00:58:09,964 --> 00:58:12,053
because you know
something is wrong, Mom.

1080
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:14,104
Jordyn, I think what your mother
is trying to say

1081
00:58:14,142 --> 00:58:16,754
is that there has to be
a rational explanation for this.

1082
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:18,016
Why are you always here?

1083
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:19,844
You know,
it's not your house anymore.

1084
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:21,759
Jordyn.

1085
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:23,151
Stop it.

1086
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:26,372
Of course. Take his side.

1087
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:31,856
I should let you two
work this out.

1088
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:33,858
I'm so sorry
she spoke to you like that.

1089
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:35,686
It's okay.

1090
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:38,123
And thank you
for coming over tonight.

1091
00:58:38,253 --> 00:58:39,646
I'll check on you tomorrow.

1092
00:58:39,777 --> 00:58:41,300
Okay.

1093
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:54,966
Hey. I couldn't sleep.

1094
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:56,533
Mind if I join you?

1095
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:06,543
I know that painting
is really disturbing

1096
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:08,936
and I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

1097
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:10,764
And sweetie,
I wasn't taking his side.

1098
00:59:10,895 --> 00:59:13,811
I just...
I don't want you to be rude.

1099
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:16,291
Can we agree that
his obsession with the house

1100
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:19,381
is a little strange?

1101
00:59:19,512 --> 00:59:21,862
Well, he really loves it.

1102
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:24,691
And I think it's because
his parents have died

1103
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:27,738
and doesn't have any family,

1104
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:31,350
so in some ways,
this house is all he has left.

1105
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,613
But it's like he has no life.

1106
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:37,748
He's just always available
to stop by.

1107
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:41,055
You know,
he's been very helpful.

1108
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:43,014
I just don't trust him.

1109
00:59:44,058 --> 00:59:45,451
Okay.

1110
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,018
Well, I do.

1111
00:59:47,148 --> 00:59:49,586
He's been a really
good friend to me.

1112
00:59:50,935 --> 00:59:52,719
I tell you
how I feel and it's...

1113
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:54,895
you just...
it feels like you don't care.

1114
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:56,767
Of course I care.

1115
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:59,334
I'm just saying
that I don't feel the same.

1116
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:02,773
You're just so quick
to dismiss my opinions, Mom.

1117
01:00:02,903 --> 01:00:05,340
It's like you've stopped
believing in anything I've said.

1118
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:07,778
That is just not true.

1119
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:13,411
(over the phone)
We can't catch a break.

1120
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:17,701
Wow. This is... disturbing.

1121
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,180
Who would've done it?

1122
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:22,053
I have no idea.

1123
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:23,881
And Jordyn's right.

1124
01:00:24,011 --> 01:00:26,579
There's something wrong
about this house.

1125
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,450
I just had such high hopes.

1126
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:30,235
Of course you did.

1127
01:00:30,365 --> 01:00:32,585
I mean, we have to be
comfortable in our own home.

1128
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:34,543
(Lucy) (over the phone) Exactly.

1129
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:35,849
I just wish there was a way

1130
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,174
we could resolve
whatever it is going on

1131
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:38,678
without having to leave.

1132
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,986
You're dreading
what Colin would say

1133
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:45,119
if you told him you're thinking
of selling, aren't you?

1134
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,253
(Sara) (over the phone) I'm just
afraid he'd be disappointed.

1135
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:51,952
I mean, I know
that's crazy for me to say but...

1136
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:54,259
No, no, you... you like the guy.

1137
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:56,174
Yeah.

1138
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:58,132
I guess I do.

1139
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:01,570
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1140
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:03,442
You're the best, Lucy.
Thank you.

1141
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:04,399
(Lucy) (over the phone)
Goodnight.

1142
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,923
Yeah. Goodnight.

1143
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:09,143
Hmm.

1144
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:18,326
I love the windows in this room.

1145
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:20,241
Oh, it's a great room, isn't it?

1146
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:22,591
Yeah. Oh, thanks.

1147
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:24,376
Be careful. They're hot.

1148
01:01:24,506 --> 01:01:25,943
Oh.

1149
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:33,777
So, an out-of-town buyer
has made an offer.

1150
01:01:33,907 --> 01:01:35,300
Huh.

1151
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:39,391
Twenty percent more than
what you paid for this place.

1152
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:42,133
Wow.

1153
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:44,178
Wow. Why so much?

1154
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:47,007
Um, I don't know.

1155
01:01:47,138 --> 01:01:49,009
I think he needs the indoor pool

1156
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,011
for physical therapy
or something.

1157
01:01:51,142 --> 01:01:54,058
But who cares?

1158
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:55,886
He made the offer.

1159
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:03,632
Sara, this is a no-brainer.

1160
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:05,504
Why aren't you jumping up
and down?

1161
01:02:05,634 --> 01:02:09,726
I just didn't expect something
to happen so fast I guess.

1162
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:13,642
That's the way
the real estate market works.

1163
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:16,036
It's feast or famine.

1164
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:17,908
I think you need
to jump on this.

1165
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:21,128
Yeah. I know.
It's a great offer.

1166
01:02:21,259 --> 01:02:24,828
Just give me a day or two
to think about it.

1167
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:27,352
Of course. No problem.

1168
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:31,660
Hmm.

1169
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,925
(dramatic music)

1170
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,956
(Sara) Hi. You've reached
Sara Wilson's cell phone.

1171
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,286
Please leave a message

1172
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,027
and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

1173
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:51,419
Hey, Sara.

1174
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:52,701
Look, I just decided
to come into the office

1175
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:54,205
to finish that report

1176
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:56,555
and I started doing research
on your house

1177
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:58,663
just to see if there was any way
to solve its mystery

1178
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:03,431
and well I uncovered something
really interesting.

1179
01:03:03,562 --> 01:03:05,825
Look, I'm gonna come over
to tell you in person.

1180
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:09,263
Um, I don't know if you're out
but if you are, I'll just wait.

1181
01:03:09,394 --> 01:03:10,917
I've got the key. Okay.

1182
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:15,269
(suspenseful music)

1183
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:32,678
(doorbell rings)

1184
01:03:33,461 --> 01:03:34,941
(Lucy) Sara?

1185
01:03:48,476 --> 01:03:49,913
Hello?

1186
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:52,872
Who are you?

1187
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:56,615
I was just, uh,
fixing the cabinet door.

1188
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:58,791
Oh. So you're Colin?

1189
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:02,360
I'm Sara's friend Lucy.
I've heard so much about you.

1190
01:04:05,363 --> 01:04:06,973
Um, okay.

1191
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:08,211
Well, I'll let you get back
to what you're doing.

1192
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:09,802
Um, I've been dying
to look around

1193
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:12,413
and I'm sure
Sara will be back soon.

1194
01:04:12,544 --> 01:04:16,809
(suspenseful music)

1195
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:47,231
Hey, Luce, I'm home.
Are you here?

1196
01:04:51,365 --> 01:04:52,758
Lucy?

1197
01:05:01,027 --> 01:05:02,333
(phone line trilling)

1198
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:05,094
(Lucy) (over the phone)
Hi. You've reached Lucy.

1199
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:07,773
I'm away from my phone,
so just leave me a...

1200
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:15,452
(Det. Bryant) There's no
evidence of forced entry.

1201
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:16,956
She probably went out
for a walk.

1202
01:05:17,087 --> 01:05:18,436
No.

1203
01:05:18,566 --> 01:05:19,630
She wouldn't have
left me that message

1204
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:21,613
and then turn off her phone.

1205
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:23,963
And she wouldn't have asked me
to wait here.

1206
01:05:24,094 --> 01:05:26,226
And now her car is here
and she's not?

1207
01:05:26,357 --> 01:05:28,185
You're sure no one else
has the house key?

1208
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:31,014
Besides Jordyn and I, no.
Just Lucy.

1209
01:05:31,144 --> 01:05:32,450
And you have no idea

1210
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,949
what she had to tell you
about this house?

1211
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:36,410
(sighs) None at all.

1212
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,282
She told me to wait here.

1213
01:05:38,412 --> 01:05:40,371
And now her car...

1214
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:42,634
Why don't I go
get you a drink, huh?

1215
01:05:42,764 --> 01:05:45,158
Yeah, that's exactly
what she needs.

1216
01:05:45,289 --> 01:05:47,030
- Jordyn.
- Let's get you a water.

1217
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,596
Okay. Thank you.

1218
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,648
Mom, are you gonna tell him?

1219
01:05:58,389 --> 01:05:59,651
About the strange things

1220
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:01,958
that have been happening
in this house?

1221
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:05,178
Come on.

1222
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:07,509
Weird things have been happening
ever since we moved in.

1223
01:06:07,615 --> 01:06:11,271
(suspenseful music)

1224
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:20,106
(Jordyn) A couch got moved,

1225
01:06:20,237 --> 01:06:21,957
a shadow box
that was taken off of the wall.

1226
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:23,283
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1227
01:06:23,414 --> 01:06:24,734
(Jordyn) And put back
on the wall.

1228
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,287
There was this
disturbing painting of us

1229
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:29,246
that was at our front doorstep.

1230
01:06:29,376 --> 01:06:31,509
You think someone broke in
and did all that?

1231
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:34,207
No, it all happened
at different times

1232
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:36,601
over the last couple of weeks.

1233
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:39,125
It's like someone else
is living in the house with us

1234
01:06:39,256 --> 01:06:41,127
and just doing messed up things.

1235
01:06:41,258 --> 01:06:43,956
Okay. Start from the beginning.

1236
01:06:46,393 --> 01:06:48,439
(crow cawing)

1237
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:53,313
I'm gonna walk
the periphery of the house.

1238
01:06:53,444 --> 01:06:55,924
I mean, do you think that
she could've just wandered off?

1239
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:57,535
No, I think someone

1240
01:06:57,665 --> 01:06:59,798
might be getting
inside the house.

1241
01:07:01,234 --> 01:07:02,801
I'm gonna see him out.

1242
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,893
Detective.

1243
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:13,594
I was hoping we could have
a moment in private.

1244
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:15,466
Okay.

1245
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:17,294
I'm not sure
if you picked up on it

1246
01:07:17,424 --> 01:07:19,905
but, uh, Jordyn, well,

1247
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,169
she really
doesn't care much for me.

1248
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,520
Or I should say she doesn't
approve of me dating her mother.

1249
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:28,653
And this is relevant because?

1250
01:07:28,783 --> 01:07:29,480
Sara.

1251
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:31,395
She's just been under

1252
01:07:31,525 --> 01:07:33,658
a tremendous amount
of stress lately,

1253
01:07:33,788 --> 01:07:37,183
that combined with a daughter
who's, well, you know,

1254
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:40,926
let's just say she might not
be remembering things correctly.

1255
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,495
Mr. Murray, are you telling me
what I just heard was all lies?

1256
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:48,064
No. No, no, not lies
but maybe, um, you know,

1257
01:07:48,194 --> 01:07:50,631
unintentional exaggerations.

1258
01:07:50,762 --> 01:07:53,025
It could be that Sara
moved those things back

1259
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:55,462
and she just doesn't remember.

1260
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:57,203
You think she's delusional?

1261
01:07:57,334 --> 01:07:59,858
No, but she has a new job

1262
01:07:59,988 --> 01:08:03,383
and, you know,
difficult teenager,

1263
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,429
a challenging ex.

1264
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:06,841
She's just been
under a lot of strain

1265
01:08:06,865 --> 01:08:11,087
and I just wanted you to know.

1266
01:08:11,217 --> 01:08:13,306
Hmm. Tell me, Mr. Murray,

1267
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:15,917
how long have you been
seeing Ms. Wilson?

1268
01:08:16,048 --> 01:08:20,139
Oh, uh, a few weeks.

1269
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,401
A few weeks?

1270
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:23,011
And you feel you gained

1271
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:26,362
a good perspective
in that small amount of time?

1272
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:31,063
Yes.
Well, we've gotten very close.

1273
01:08:31,193 --> 01:08:34,458
Okay. Thanks for filling me in.

1274
01:08:38,288 --> 01:08:41,682
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I'm going to check the grounds.

1275
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:43,380
Sure.

1276
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:46,773
(dramatic music)

1277
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:52,389
(sighs)

1278
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:55,782
(birds chirping)

1279
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:58,629
Would you like me
to stick around?

1280
01:09:58,759 --> 01:10:00,500
I could order in food
for dinner.

1281
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,199
Yeah, I don't want Jordyn and I

1282
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:05,636
to be alone here tonight.

1283
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:07,725
I just hope Lucy's okay.

1284
01:10:07,855 --> 01:10:10,467
What if something
happened to her here?

1285
01:10:12,077 --> 01:10:13,818
This damn house.

1286
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,952
- It's not the house's fault.
- (door lock clicks)

1287
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,824
My friend is missing.

1288
01:10:19,954 --> 01:10:22,305
I'm just wondering when
the bad things are gonna stop?

1289
01:10:22,434 --> 01:10:24,523
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But I found something.

1290
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:26,787
- What is it?
- (Det. Bryant) A small room next

1291
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:29,355
to the pool area.
Someone's been living in there.

1292
01:10:29,486 --> 01:10:31,009
A small room?

1293
01:10:31,139 --> 01:10:33,751
A mattress, some clothes.

1294
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,621
Oh, and a glass that has...

1295
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:40,018
get this, the Prohibition
Amendment written on it.

1296
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:41,889
What?

1297
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:45,545
(scoffs)

1298
01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:54,772
I'm gonna need back-up
at the Wilson residence.

1299
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:01,518
(police radio chatters)

1300
01:11:02,606 --> 01:11:04,782
Looks like the cops are leaving.

1301
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:11,092
Oh, I don't wanna stay
in this house tonight.

1302
01:11:11,223 --> 01:11:13,660
I get it.

1303
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:17,098
- Can I stay at your place?
- I wish, but my mom

1304
01:11:17,228 --> 01:11:20,450
will definitely say no to us
being together overnight.

1305
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:24,628
Please?

1306
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:31,896
My parents just won't allow it.

1307
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:34,507
Even if you tell them everything
that happened here?

1308
01:11:34,638 --> 01:11:37,162
But you don't wanna leave
your mom here all alone.

1309
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:41,732
I will call first thing
in the morning.

1310
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:43,386
Don't be mad.

1311
01:11:44,778 --> 01:11:47,259
You and your mom
will be safe tonight.

1312
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:54,484
Don't worry.

1313
01:11:54,614 --> 01:11:56,790
I have patrol cars
driving around the area.

1314
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:59,880
- We'll keep looking.
- You know, before today,

1315
01:12:00,011 --> 01:12:02,448
the two people I would've called
in this situation

1316
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:04,320
would have been Lucy or Colin.

1317
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:10,108
Here's my personal cell.

1318
01:12:10,237 --> 01:12:11,849
You hear anything,

1319
01:12:11,978 --> 01:12:15,548
see anything, you call me.

1320
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,507
Thank you.

1321
01:12:17,637 --> 01:12:19,422
Thank you, Detective.

1322
01:12:20,814 --> 01:12:22,294
(sighs)

1323
01:12:28,692 --> 01:12:29,780
(sighs)

1324
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:32,957
(tense music)

1325
01:12:43,532 --> 01:12:46,797
- (knocks on door)
- Come in.

1326
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:48,799
Noah just left.

1327
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:50,452
Are you okay?

1328
01:12:52,716 --> 01:12:54,978
No.

1329
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:57,503
I mean, do we have
to stay here tonight, Mom?

1330
01:12:57,634 --> 01:12:59,984
Can't we go to a motel?

1331
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:02,726
There's some sort of conference
happening in town.

1332
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:06,251
I checked and everything's
booked up.

1333
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:10,210
Detective Bryant says there's
officers patrolling the area.

1334
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:13,389
I mean, he says there's no way
Colin would come back tonight.

1335
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:16,827
But he's obsessed
with the house.

1336
01:13:16,957 --> 01:13:17,957
(Sara) Yeah. I know.

1337
01:13:18,045 --> 01:13:20,744
But if he came back
he'd be caught.

1338
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,660
Ugh.

1339
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:27,490
Can I sleep in here
with you tonight?

1340
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,753
Of course, sweetie.

1341
01:13:29,883 --> 01:13:32,799
Why don't you get changed?
And I'll make us some tea.

1342
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:35,280
Okay. Thanks.

1343
01:13:41,068 --> 01:13:44,028
(tense music)

1344
01:14:02,133 --> 01:14:03,700
(scoffs)

1345
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:10,054
What is that?

1346
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,415
Oh, my God, Lucy?

1347
01:14:25,678 --> 01:14:27,071
Lucy!

1348
01:14:28,289 --> 01:14:29,900
Lucy!

1349
01:14:41,302 --> 01:14:44,741
(grunting)

1350
01:14:51,878 --> 01:14:53,837
Oh, my God, Lucy.

1351
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:55,403
Lucy.

1352
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:57,014
Oh, my God, Lucy.

1353
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:00,800
Okay.

1354
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:04,934
Hurry, before he comes back.
Hurry. Hurry.

1355
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,458
That's him! He's back!

1356
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:09,026
Okay, go, go. Go, go, go.

1357
01:15:09,156 --> 01:15:10,809
You run.

1358
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:18,775
All I wanted was to share
this house with you, Sara.

1359
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:21,429
That's why you need
to put that down,

1360
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,606
so nobody gets hurt.

1361
01:15:23,736 --> 01:15:26,870
Okay, Colin. Colin, please.

1362
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,047
We don't wanna hurt
this house, do we?

1363
01:15:30,177 --> 01:15:32,397
I won't let them
take me out of here!

1364
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,660
(grunting)

1365
01:15:55,115 --> 01:15:57,639
Please. Please, stop!

1366
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:04,734
(Colin) No! Don't go in there!

1367
01:16:07,214 --> 01:16:08,520
No! No! No!

1368
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:11,088
- Please, please.
- Let go! Let go!

1369
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:13,351
Stop! Hey!

1370
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:14,918
I never meant to hurt you, Sara.

1371
01:16:15,048 --> 01:16:18,398
I didn't leave you
that painting.

1372
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:21,620
We could've been so happy here.

1373
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:23,579
Get your disgusting hands
off of my mom.

1374
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:25,276
The police are on their way.
Get out!

1375
01:16:25,406 --> 01:16:28,148
(groaning)

1376
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:29,976
- Mom!
- Jordyn!

1377
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:31,848
Mommy.

1378
01:16:35,112 --> 01:16:37,809
It's normal for criminals
to deny things.

1379
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:40,204
He wasn't in his right mind.

1380
01:16:41,205 --> 01:16:43,270
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.
- I think what you mean to say

1381
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:45,644
is that my mom
was not in her right mind.

1382
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:48,038
She could've gotten killed
going after him.

1383
01:16:48,168 --> 01:16:50,431
The important thing
is you're both safe.

1384
01:16:50,562 --> 01:16:54,348
Officers picked him up before he
even made it to your front gate.

1385
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:57,395
And my boys did a sweep
of the whole house

1386
01:16:57,525 --> 01:17:01,181
and there's no cameras,
just a lot of clever peepholes.

1387
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:04,010
- We'll be taking care of those.
- Yeah.

1388
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:07,492
Well, you ladies stay put.
And I'll let myself out.

1389
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,672
Well, we're gonna play
hooky tomorrow.

1390
01:17:13,803 --> 01:17:16,196
- I'll make pancakes.
- Hmm.

1391
01:17:16,327 --> 01:17:17,633
(phone chimes)

1392
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:20,460
Oh, good.

1393
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:22,986
Lucy says the doctor doesn't
think she has a concussion.

1394
01:17:23,116 --> 01:17:24,814
- Oh.
- Well, then,

1395
01:17:24,943 --> 01:17:27,730
- we'll invite her to join us.
- Uh-hmm.

1396
01:17:37,478 --> 01:17:38,478
Hey.

1397
01:17:38,523 --> 01:17:40,830
- Hi.
- (Sara) Hi.

1398
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,615
I wanted to see
how you're doing.

1399
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:45,791
Oh, we had a really rough night

1400
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:48,925
actually last night,
kind of unbelievable.

1401
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:52,318
Yeah. I know.
That's why I'm here.

1402
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:54,234
Really? How did you hear?

1403
01:17:54,365 --> 01:17:56,933
I have a contact down
at the police department.

1404
01:17:57,063 --> 01:17:59,413
I need to know the goings
on around town,

1405
01:17:59,544 --> 01:18:02,242
- you know, so that I can...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1406
01:18:02,373 --> 01:18:04,157
Well, we were fine,

1407
01:18:04,288 --> 01:18:06,986
rattled but fine.

1408
01:18:07,117 --> 01:18:09,423
I'm so glad you guys are okay.

1409
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:11,034
I was so worried.

1410
01:18:11,164 --> 01:18:14,037
Thank you.
Do you wanna come inside?

1411
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:17,972
(Kendall)
Have you had the chance

1412
01:18:17,996 --> 01:18:20,696
to consider the offer
on the house?

1413
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:24,830
It's funny you should ask.

1414
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,050
Jordyn and I talked
about it this morning.

1415
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:30,967
Be careful.
Sorry, it is scalding hot.

1416
01:18:31,097 --> 01:18:33,534
Oh, it's okay.

1417
01:18:33,665 --> 01:18:35,058
After everything
that's happened,

1418
01:18:35,188 --> 01:18:38,888
I can imagine
that you'd wanna leave.

1419
01:18:39,018 --> 01:18:41,673
Yeah. You'd think, right?

1420
01:18:41,804 --> 01:18:44,675
That's why it's so unexpected,
you know, that Jordyn and I,

1421
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:48,027
we decided we're gonna stay.

1422
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:50,682
- What?
- Yeah.

1423
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:53,206
I think this whole experience,

1424
01:18:53,337 --> 01:18:55,731
you know, has brought us
close together, and...

1425
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:57,558
we're gonna make
our new start here.

1426
01:18:57,689 --> 01:19:01,258
You know, like we planned,
instead of running.

1427
01:19:01,388 --> 01:19:03,564
Plus, I think it'd be really
hard to find another house

1428
01:19:03,695 --> 01:19:06,219
with the indoor pool, right?

1429
01:19:07,438 --> 01:19:09,875
I don't know, Sara. I, uh...

1430
01:19:10,005 --> 01:19:12,094
I think you should reconsider.

1431
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:16,708
My client, I mean,

1432
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:19,058
he just really wants this house.

1433
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:21,713
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Kendall,

1434
01:19:21,844 --> 01:19:24,629
but we really wanna stay.

1435
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,246
Um...

1436
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:50,263
Are you okay?

1437
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:04,451
No, Sara, I'm not okay.

1438
01:20:04,582 --> 01:20:07,759
I needed you to sell this house
to my buyer.

1439
01:20:07,889 --> 01:20:10,588
Don't you get it? I'm the buyer.

1440
01:20:10,718 --> 01:20:13,286
Okay. Just put the knife down.

1441
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:15,308
- We can talk about this.
- It's too late for that.

1442
01:20:15,332 --> 01:20:17,813
- Hey, Mom, have you seen...
- No, no, no. Jordyn!

1443
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:20,337
(screams)

1444
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,340
Oh!

1445
01:20:23,469 --> 01:20:25,385
Jordyn! Oh, my God.

1446
01:20:25,516 --> 01:20:27,126
Are you okay?

1447
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:30,956
She made me do it!

1448
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:34,177
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1449
01:20:34,307 --> 01:20:37,049
Look... (panting)

1450
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,183
This is just a house, okay?

1451
01:20:43,055 --> 01:20:44,621
Why?

1452
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:46,842
Why are you doing this?

1453
01:20:49,714 --> 01:20:51,759
Mary Weather Industries,

1454
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:55,894
they're one of the largest
conglomerates in the world.

1455
01:20:56,025 --> 01:20:59,157
They're going to invest
two billion dollars

1456
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:01,943
just to revitalize this area.

1457
01:21:02,074 --> 01:21:04,642
And at the heart
of their endeavor,

1458
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:08,166
where they plan to put
their corporate campus...

1459
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:10,909
you guessed it.

1460
01:21:12,084 --> 01:21:14,913
It's right here
in your lovely home.

1461
01:21:15,044 --> 01:21:17,873
So you're planning
on selling our land

1462
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:20,571
to Mary Weather Industries?

1463
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:22,268
(chuckles)

1464
01:21:22,398 --> 01:21:24,270
Oh.

1465
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:28,535
It's going to make me very rich.

1466
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:32,626
When you told me about
all the real scary things

1467
01:21:32,757 --> 01:21:34,889
that were going on
in this house,

1468
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:38,197
I figured it out way
before you did.

1469
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:41,374
I knew it was the former owner.

1470
01:21:41,505 --> 01:21:44,160
I mean, clearly, this Colin guy

1471
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:47,032
couldn't let go of his home.

1472
01:21:47,163 --> 01:21:50,427
And he even became obsessed
with you in it.

1473
01:21:50,557 --> 01:21:53,299
And, you know,
I was actually worried

1474
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:57,477
that you would get in
the way of my plan.

1475
01:21:57,608 --> 01:21:58,914
He helped me.

1476
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:01,394
So the only thing
I had left to do

1477
01:22:01,525 --> 01:22:06,008
is find a way to scare you
to make you finally leave.

1478
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:07,698
(Sara) Why didn't you
just explain to me

1479
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:10,360
that Mary Weather Industries
wanted our property?

1480
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:13,580
I mean, the commission alone
would've made you rich.

1481
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:17,715
The commission alone...

1482
01:22:17,844 --> 01:22:20,109
would have given me peanuts.

1483
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:23,503
- Jordyn.
- (Jordyn) Mom.

1484
01:22:23,634 --> 01:22:25,418
(scoffs)

1485
01:22:42,782 --> 01:22:44,655
No!

1486
01:22:44,785 --> 01:22:46,483
No!

1487
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:09,985
(Jordyn) Mom!

1488
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:14,119
- Mom!
- (gapping)

1489
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:15,512
Jordyn.

1490
01:23:16,904 --> 01:23:17,993
Are you okay?

1491
01:23:18,123 --> 01:23:19,516
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, Mom.

1492
01:23:20,734 --> 01:23:22,300
I'm so sorry that I...

1493
01:23:22,432 --> 01:23:24,323
I stopped listening to you,
and trusting you and...

1494
01:23:24,347 --> 01:23:27,741
No. It's okay. I'm sorry
for being such a brat.

1495
01:23:27,871 --> 01:23:30,266
I love you, honey, so much.

1496
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:31,528
I love you, too.

1497
01:23:32,485 --> 01:23:33,680
- Are you okay?
- (doorbell rings)

1498
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:35,010
(Jordyn) Yeah.

1499
01:23:38,796 --> 01:23:40,537
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1500
01:23:46,412 --> 01:23:48,023
Okay.

1501
01:23:57,597 --> 01:23:59,117
Let me just find a couple more
of these

1502
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:01,123
- and I can start a fire.
- Thank you, Noah.

1503
01:24:01,818 --> 01:24:03,299
This is beautiful.

1504
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:05,518
I was thinking I'd collect
a bunch of these,

1505
01:24:05,648 --> 01:24:07,520
and put them in a vase
at the front entrance.

1506
01:24:07,651 --> 01:24:09,000
I love that idea.

1507
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:10,480
What do you guys want
for dinner?

1508
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:12,177
Um, souffle...

1509
01:24:12,308 --> 01:24:15,224
or coq au vin. (laughing)

1510
01:24:15,353 --> 01:24:17,313
(Sara) How about some pizza?

1511
01:24:17,443 --> 01:24:19,141
(Jordyn) Come on, Mom.

1512
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:26,713
(ominous music)
