immigrated into the United
States 15 years ago,

110
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,841
led by a guy
named Vor Kashalov.

111
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,207
He deals with drugs,
fraud and extortion.

112
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,268
And what's this
have to do with me?

113
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,939
We're leveling an indictment
against Kashalov this afternoon.

00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,108
His chief witness
is a guy named Jason Patrons.

115
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,846
Patrons did the books for
Kashalov without knowing it.

116
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,913
And we are in (he process
of convincing Jason Patrone

117
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,014
to testify against Vor.

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,026
And I got a grilled
cheese for lunch.

119
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,386
- What?
-What is your point?

120
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,695
My point is Patrone's daughter
goes to college in New Orleans,

121
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,702
and we want you
to keep an eye on her.

122
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,897
Don't you have someone at the
bureau that can do that?

123
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,940
Our trainees would have
a pretty difficult time

124
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,270
passing as a college
sorority girl.

125
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,310
They're pretty beefy
and they got mustaches.

126
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,471
And that's just the women.

127
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,048
I did my homework on you. Your
mother died when you were young.

128
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,913
You were raised by your father,
and by proxy,

129
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,714
most of the Dallas
police force.

130
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,584
At eleven, you became
a really great shot,

131
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,748
and you're well versed
in Jiu Jitsu.

132
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,382
I'm an Aikido man myself.

133
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,551
Sorry.

134
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,288
Why are you sorry?

135
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,158
Aikido is a fashionable way
for fat housewives

136
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,890
to lose weight
at their local Equinox.

137
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,230
Are you calling me a fat housewife?
Yeah.

138
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,098
You don't think that Jiu
Jitsu is a dated form?

139
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,104
No. It's the most
effective defense system

140
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,571
when it comes
to overcoming size.

141
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,266
Please!
I'm serious.

142
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,173
With the right amount
o! leverage and speed,

143
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,903
I'd drive you
through that window.

144
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,810
If you were behind
the wheel of a forklift.

145
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,438
This is a waste of my time.

146
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,818
You know what a near! hi! is?

147
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,583
Never heard of it.

148
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,625
It's an Eastern European
enforcement practice.

149
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,353
The family
will plant someone

150
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,360
into the life of a loved
one of their enemy.

151
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,692
The plant will work their way
into the life of the target.

152
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,527
Get close to them.

153
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,101
So the threat of a hit
alone prevents testimony.

154
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,761
Exactly There is
a heart hit planted

155
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,136
on Jason's daughter's life.

156
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,106
Her name is Alex Patrons.

157
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,109
We think she's holding
something for her father.

158
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,304
Some evidence
against Kashalov.

159
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,111
Financial statements, accounting
ledgers that provide her dad

160
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,344
with a bargaining chip
of some sort.

161
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,943
I can't do it.
I'm needed here.

162
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,717
Fifteen thousand.

163
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,812
I've got a kid.

164
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,517
No, you don't.

168
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,030
I'm offering you a chance
to do something real.

169
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,158
A chance to work
for the FBI.

170
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,397
A chance to possibly make a real
difference in someone's life.

171
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,302
Think about it, Molly,

172
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,671
because we both know
that chasing cheating truckers

173
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,472
is not the top rung
of investigative fulfillment-.

174
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,345

175
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,179

Oh, I had dinner
with the guys.

00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,775
That coffee cup you're holding
is from Rolly Roasters,

180
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,574
and there's only two
franchises in the Dallas area.

181
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,447
Al the airport
and Lone Star Park.

182
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,712
You always read the newspaper
at dinner with the guys,

183
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,119
yet that newspaper you're holding
hasn't been opened yet-.

184
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,088
And that red stamp on your
hand gives you access

185
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,319
to the box seat section.

186
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,157
So tell me, Dad,

187
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,995
how was the track?

188
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,164
You're too quick
for me. Moll.

189
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,068
How much?

190
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:33,441
I was so close to getting
that money for that lawyer.

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,606
I was so close to getting
hack on the force and then...

192
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,741
Really! I was just
one hot streak away.

193
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,574
Dad.

194
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,746
And then I lost.

195
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,084
Then I chased.

196
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,351
How much?

197
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,983
Seventeen thousand.

198
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,879
Armon.

199
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,682
What is this place'?
You'll see.

200
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,151
We've gained you entry
to Alex's sorority.

201
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,623
You're a transfer
from University of Hawaii.

202
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,786
Obscure school.
Far away. Smart.

203
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,127
But I need more money-
What?

204
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,793
Listen, I'm gonna take the gig.
I'm gonna go ta (he college.

205
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,199
I'll even throw in
some lipstick.

206
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,362
But I need five grand more.

207
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,133
Fine, but you're gonna do a lot
more than just put on lipstick.

208
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,649
Okay, you're like,

209
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,154
Who's this?

210
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,157
I'm Bizzy.

211
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,556
You're busy?

212
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,149
No, Molly,
her name is Bizzy.

213
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,854
She works out
of the New York office.

214
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,262
So what's this look
we're rocking? Hobo chic?

215
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,095
I don't get it.

216
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,329
Okay, you have to like try on
all these clothes.

217
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,996
Fine.

218
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,541
No, Molly, you say
'totally' or you say

219
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,771
its shorter cousin 'totes'
when you want to say “fine.”

220
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,278

00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:55,052
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was totes inappropes.

233
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,088
No, I liked it.

234
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,555
It's kind of like
my last Craigslist experience.

235
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,886
Amaze balls.

236
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,551
A what balls?

237
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,391
This is the Kappa
Kappa Zeta pecking order-.

238
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,556
You're gonna need to know this
lo fit into the house.

239
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,226
At the top,
we've got Sasha Stolezinsky.

240
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,395
She is ruthless
and power hungry

241
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,961
and runs the house

00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,904
She-'s like Khadafi

In-styler rolling hot iron.
Trust me. You'll need it.

244
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:24,479
If binging and purging were a
crime, she'd be on death row.

245
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,447
Do you know what I'm saying?
Not really.

246
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,746
<i>I out my hair myself.</i>

247

In an earthquake?

248
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,749
These are her
lop three lieutenants.

249
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,918
Cotton, Taylor, and Hunter.

250
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,087
Cotton, Taylor, Hunter.

251

They were conceived
while their parents

252
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,193
were having sex
in an L.L. Bean outlet store.

253
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,632
This is your target
right here. Alex Patrone.

254
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,262
You are her best friend.
Got it.

Bravo wicked thin lubricated
condoms, size large, jumbo pack.

256
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,535
Yeah, I won't
be needing those.

257
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:58,810
Oh! It': like a sad animal
attempted suicide on her head'

258
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,782
You both know
I'm sitting right here.

259
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,720
If anyone can do it, you can.
You're the hair whisperer.

260
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,882
This is your phone.

261
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,822
What did you do?
Rob a nine-year-old'?

262
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,724
No, you're actually going
to use this phone.

263
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,524
It's got
a built-in Kappa app

264
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,655
with information on all
of your sorority sisters.

265
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,064
Kappa app?
That's right.

266
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,691
And this one
you will not use.

267
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,999
But keep it on you
and on at all times.

268
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,664
Why?

269
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,402
Because that's how
I'm going to find you.

270
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,170
You'll receive a text.

271
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,007
What if I need to call you?
You'll get a text.

272
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,910
So if I need to call you,
I'm going to get a text'?

273
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,208
Correct.
Makes no sense.

274
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,749
Kappa phone,
bat phone.

275
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,319
Don't call it a hat phone.
Why not?

276
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,322
It belittles the importance
of the phone.

277
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,517
Okay. I'm sorry, but I'm
calling it a bat phone.

278
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,653
No. The bat phone was red,
and it was a land line,

279
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,424
and Bruce Wayne
used it for calls,

280
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,659
and you're only using that
to receive texts!

281
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,169
I don't see the point, okay?
Okay.

282
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,938
And this right here

283
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,712
is your brand new
Volkswagen EOS.

284
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,112
Come on, can'! I ride
my bike to school?

lo drive (his thing'

287
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,881

most girls.

289
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,753
Who's Brook Stonebridge?

290
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,551
It's your new identity.

291
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,251
Are you serious?

292
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,123
That's not a name.
That's a gated community.

293
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,251
I really don't care.

294
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,698
Holy shit.

295
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,465
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

296
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,868
Holy shit.

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

298
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:31,773
Try it.

299
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,707
Try what'?

300
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,043
You say, "Oh my God” when you
want to say “holy shit."

301
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,047
<i>Oh, my God'?</i>

302
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:44,248

Cotton? Listen to me.
I'm late as it is.

314
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,152
I still have to shave
my chest and meditate

315
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,653
before I meet my parents.

316
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,586
So just meet us
at the horse show.

317
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,487
Cameron, I told you.
I can't!

318
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,084
Cotton, sometimes you can be
such an insipid idiot!

319
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,321
Cameron, I don't know
what that word means.

320
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,865
What kind of idiot doesn’t know
what the word “idiot” means?

321
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,332
No, the other one.

322
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,096
İnsipid,
devoid of character.

323
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,828
I have character, Cameron.

324
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,599

I was a raspberry!

I think you could be
a bit more patient.

328
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,234
Oh, really.

329
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,881
Don't be late.

330
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,858

a first date.

00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,636
I was really nervous
about transferring here, but..-...

394
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,046

Wow! That was
disturbingly poetic.

526
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,690
Look, I really am sorry.
It was just accident.

527
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:23,323
No, an accident is like
when you're driving

528
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:25,299
and you hit a raccoon,
but you don't want to stop

529
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,701
because it turned out
to be somebody': dog.

530
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:30,296
This is a tragedy.

531
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,707
All right, girls, let's go.

532
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,338
<i>The Racketeer Inﬂuenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act.</i>

533
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,206
RICO allowed law enforcement

534
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,836
to get into areas
that it'd never been before

535
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,903
when it came
to investigating the mafia.

536
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,573
It was a Nixon hustle.

537
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,314
Excuse me?

538
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,651
I'm sorry, but you're
not telling the whole story-.

539
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,348
Well, enlighten us.

540
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,221
The Justice Department
used RICO

541
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,351
to go after anybody
on Nixon's hate list.

542
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,659
Gays, liberals, reformers,
subversive students.

543
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,426
Yeah, RICO was enacted
to go after the mob,

544
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,432
but don'! tell me
that it wasn't abused.

545
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,059
I won't.
What's your name?

546
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,865
Brook.

547
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,533
How would someone
like you know (his, Brook?

548
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,246
I don't know.

549
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:46,373
I guess I'm just like, so into
crime, I want to throw up!

550
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,941
[everyone laughs]

551
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,182
Interesting take
on RICO.

552
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,419
I don't really know
what I'm talking about.

553
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:58,387
Hey Summer!

554
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,858
That was kind of rude.

555
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,959
She was my freshman
roommate last year.

556
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,695
I haven'! seen
her since (hen.

557
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,898
She's probably just
trying to keep it low.

558
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,372
Keep what low'?

559
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,034
Her affair
with the good doctor.

560
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,634
<i>[Nicholas]
What are you talking about?</i>

561
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,804
She was probably
in one of his lectures,

562
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:19,542
and now they're on their way to
have scandalous motel room sex.

563
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,949
Come on. How do you
know that. Brook?

564
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,420
The parking pass on the back of his
car is preferential for doctors.

565
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,617
He's not wearing a wedding
ring but I see the tan line.

566
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,215
She obviously
knows he's married,

567
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,784
so that's not why
he doesn't wear it.

568
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,726
It's a guilt thing
cheating men do.

569
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,562
Wow. All I saw was Summer
and some guy. I'm impressed.

570
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,659
You've got a really nice
sense of deduction Brook.

571
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:44,405
I developed it early.
What?

572
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:49,139
I don't know. I should
probably not talk anymore.

573
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,236
Okay, amaze-balls.

574
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,648
I'm gonna go nap now.

575
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,489
Shit.
What's up'?

576
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,933
[crunching]
Finance major.

577
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,870
Why can'! I be like everyone else
in the house and just marry one?

578
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,872
[snickers]

579
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,306
What are those books'?

580
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,708
Not books, ledgers.
[crunches]

581
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,474
Big, fat accounting ledgers-.

582
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,675
You know they have
computers for that, right?

583
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,274
Our sadist teacher makes
us do it all by hand.

584
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,343
That way we really learn.

585
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,688
I need a break.

586
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:46,365
See you.
See you.

587
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,864
That's weird.

588
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,826
The house doesn't have a dug.

589
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,107
What are you doing?

590
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,073
Hey, Taylor.

591
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,540
Hows it going?

592
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,582
I'm retaining water
and I'm not sure why-.

593
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,054
Why are you in our room'?

594
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:43,354
I'm just borrowing
Alex's thong.

595
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,021
You know how we like to all
borrow each other's stuff.

596
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,927
I guess so.

597
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,861
Brandy.
Huh?

598
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,235
If you drink brandy, you won'!
retain all that water.

599
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,571
Really
Okay, thanks, Brook.

600
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,042
Nu prob.

601
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,242
See you.

602
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,711
I'll try that.

603
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:13,279
[beeping]
Bat phone.

604
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,911
Hi, Brook.
Armon.

605
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,784
You made me ride
the whole streetcar line.

606
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,755
Precautions.

607
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,314
Follow me.

608
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,757
All right, update me.

609
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,453
There's nothing to say.

610
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,463
Look, I know I haven't
been there that long,

611
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,430
but I know dangerous people
and there aren't any there.

612
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,195
Take a look at this.

613
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,699
<i>Oh, my God, that's Bizzy.</i>

614
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:08,869
Yep, Kashalov
had her killed.

615
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,947
I don'! get it. Why wouldn't
they just kill Alex?

616
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,379
Why would they go
to all the trouble

617
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,177
of planting someone
in her life?

618
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,718
If he has Alex killed,
her father will testify.

619
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,288
The only way he can gain
momentum right now

620
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,119
is by planting
a killer-in-wait.

621
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,022
You have to take
(his seriously.

622
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,458
Find out who's not
who they say they are

623
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,294
and try to uncover any information
about this bargaining chip

624
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,833
(ha! Alex may be holding.

625
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,726
[floor creaks]

626
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,658
[door squeaks]

627
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,168
Wake up! Wake up!
[beating pan]

628
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,206
Move and I shoot!

629
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,405
What the hell, Cotton'?

630
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:19,515
It was a PJ party.
What?

631
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,517
It's a tradition.

632
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,553
We wake each other up
in the middle of the night

633
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,782
(hen go to a frat party
without showering or changing'

634
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:29,688
So everyone's showering
and changing right now

635
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,921
to make it look like
they didn't shower or change.

636
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,792
You sleep with a gun?

637
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:35,796
It's not real.

638
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,930
It's not'?
Of course not.

639
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,796
Your money or your life.

640
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,532
I'm gonna bust
a cat in your ass.

641
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,939
Give it back.

642
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,771
<i>It's a cap.
What's a cap'?</i>

643
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,142
It's bust a cap in your ass.

644
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,078
Why would anybody
put a cap in their ass?

645
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,583
Because, Cotton,
that's what the gangsters do.

646
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,550
That's weird.

647
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,748
Oh! And putting a cat in
your ass isn't weird at all?

648
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,282
You're a real
Einstein, Cotton.

649
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,491
<i>I am not.</i>

[rap music playing,

651
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,599
I can'! believe you'd
wear that here.

652
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,034
You look like a cheap trick.

653
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,661
<i>You bought this
for my birthday!</i>

654
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,467
No, I didn't.

655
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,166
My fathers secretary did
and I signed the card.

656
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,708
And don't you think
for a second

657
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,505
that she's not going
to gel fired

658
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,876
for making you look
like a New Jersey housewife!

659
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,540
I guess he's better once
you get to know him?

660
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,143
Not really.
He just called me a housewife.

661
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,713
Cotton, you don't
need to take that.

662
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,217
Wait, did he
just propose to me?

663
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:13,193
I don't think--

664
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,025
Wow.

665
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,193
Do you think I'm pretty'?

00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,136
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

667
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:28,575
Sometimes I wanna kill you
because you are so pretty.

668
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,806
I'm serious. I think
about killing you a ma.

669
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,646
Oh, you're so sweet.

you in a dip

681
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,039
and it's not a place
students usually go,

682
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,010
but I promise you'll
have a lot of fun.

Not really here
lo have fun.

Besides, I hate
the French.

This is so unlike me!

but the guy has nothing
on his background.

700
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,248
He is a complete ghost.

701
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,978
Is she sleeping with him?
Possibly'

702
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,748
Sasha's not telling the truth
about her past either.

703
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,585
How do you know that'?

704
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,682
She claims she modeled
in Croatia for three years,

705
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,191
which is smarter
than saying Paris

706
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,590
because it's
a memorable detail

707
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,527
(ha! helps sell the lie.

708
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,690
It's called a unique qualifier.
I use them all the time.

709
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,359
When she told me, she leaned her
head back, looked lo the right,

710
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,199
<i>and widened her eyes
and touched her lip.</i>

711
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,295
These are non-verbal tells
of deception in women.

712
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,171
What about guys?
Is she dating anyone?

713
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,504
There's Nicholas Dexter
in our criminal justice class

714
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,135
but I don't think
it's romantic.

715
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,044
What about him?

716
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,343
He's smart and he's got this
boyish charm about him.

717
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,315
But he's not as immature
as the other frat boys.

718
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,650
Jesus. [nun gasps]
God bless you.

719
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:52,949
What?

720
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,820
You're into him.
Am not!

721
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,291
And BTW's, if anything,
he's the one crushing on me.

722
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,294
BTW's?
By the way.

723
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,125
Crushing on you?
What does that mean?

724
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,825
He kind of asked me out.

725
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,333
Are you gonna
go outwith him?

726
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,233
I told him that
I hate (he French.

727
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,828
No, I'm not here to date.

728
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,738
Obviously, but you are here

729
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,572
to investigate anyone
that comes into her life.

730
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,842
I'm gonna get some intel on the professor.
You investigate Sasha.

731
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,383
And go out with Nicholas.

732
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,974
I don't think going out
with Nicholas

733
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,349
is the best way
m go about this.

734
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,218
Of course it is.
What else?

735
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,153
I'm writing this
totally kick-ass paper

736
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,988
about the pros
and cons of RICO.

737
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,086
What does that
have to do with Alex?

738
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,720
Nothing, I guess.

739
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,762
[talking, dog barking]

740
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,169
How's your head'?

741
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,367
Yeah, I know.
See you later.

742
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:56,851
Brook!

743
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,512
Hey, Brook!

744
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,848
Nicholas, hey.

745
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,357
How are you doing?

746
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,051
Did you enjoy
the party last night?

747
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:08,096
<i>Yeah. Just been so busy with school.
Yeah.</i>

748
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,564
Wish I could just
burn off same steam.

749
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:15,127
Go to some old jazz club
or something, just let loose.

750
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,763
There's that place I told you
about in (he French Quarter,

751
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:20,365
but it's swarming
with lazy French people.

752
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,138
Maybe they deserve
a second chance.

753
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,541
Yeah, tell that to Algeria.

754
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,603
[laughs]

755
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:31,051
I don't know what that means,
but I bet it was really funny.

756
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,713
Yeah, maybe I'll do that.

757
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,984
If you don't mind,
I'd love to tag along.

758
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,215
Your balls are amazing.

759
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,091
My balls'?

760
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:44,291
I meant to say that would
be amaze-balls. Right.

761
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,163
I think I gotta go.

762
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,430
You okay, Break'?

763
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:50,905
Yeah, me'?
I'm great!

764
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,964
<i>I'm the bomb dot com.</i>

765
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,446
All right, well, I'll see you tonight.
See you!

766
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:02,508
[jazz music, laughter]

767
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,854
If you're not from New Orleans,
let me hear you scream.

768
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,583
[screaming]

769
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,422
The greatest music
created and nobody cares.

770
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,586
You from here?

771
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,129
Listen to that.

772
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,823
That is all about
call and response.

773
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,367
You're not
into this, are you?

774
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,960
No. I am.

775
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,972
I just wanted
to get to know you more.

776
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,474
Well, you're the bigger
mystery than me. Me?

777
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,340
Yeah! You come out of nowhere,

778
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,345
you know about motorcycles
and RICO statutes,

779
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,312
then suddenly you're
(his little Kappa girl

780
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:36,352
who's the bomb dot com
and just wants to throw up.

781
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:38,977
Where are you from'?

782
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,114
And that is harmony
and interpretation.

783
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,783
Why won't you answer me'?

784
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,189
I'm just into this.

785
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:47,854
Are you hiding something?
Nu.

786
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:50,830
No, you can
ask me anything.

787
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,390
Have you ever killed somebody?

788
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:58,199
I'm kidding.

789
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:00,037
You've got a strange
sense of humor, Brook.

790
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:01,337
Yeah. Love it or leave it.

791
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,035
So?

792
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,043
I'm from Florida.

793
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,525
He kept on asking me
about a jab,

794
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:21,928
a job this
and a job that,

795
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,555
and I said [didn't
want a job,

796
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,258
that I was trying
really hard in school,

797
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:27,393
and I was
on the baseball team

798
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:30,062
and I didn't
have time for a job.

799
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:34,667
He just looked at me
and told me he was leaving,

800
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,268
that he met a woman,

801
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,506
that he didn't love
my mother anymore,

802
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,016
<i>and that I was going to have to
take care of her and my sister.</i>

803
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,950
And he told me it
just like (hat,

804
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,681
like he was telling me what
to pick up from the store.

805
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:54,385
And that's why I quit playing
baseball in high school.

806
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:57,558
I'm sorry. I didn't plan on telling
you that story. It's okay.

807
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,538
We're at your house again.

808
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,130
One more lime
around the block?

809
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,936
I've walked you home
six times tonight.

810
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,635
Let's make it seven.

811
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,381
So, what about you?
Are your parents together?

812
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,921
No, my mom died
when I was younger.

813
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,220
Did your dad remarry'?
No.

814
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,783
What's he do?

815
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,759
[clears throat]

816
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,956
I don't really want to get
into it right now, Nicholas.

817
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:33,292
Don't be mad at me.

818
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:34,893
I'm not mad, I just--

819
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,939
I've been opening up
m you all night,

820
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:42,000
and you deflect any real question
I ask you about yourself.

821
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,943
I just don't trust
people that easy.

822
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,642
I don't have the most faith
in relationships. That's all.

823
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,944
Why not'?

824
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,986
Because I've been there.

825
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:54,318
I've seen it. People lie and
they misrepresent themselves

826
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:55,686
and they let
each other down.

827
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,924
Well. I don't lie.

828
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,430
I don't misrepresent myself.

829
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:06,263
And as far as I know,
I don't let anyone down.

830
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,287
You better be
who you say you are,

831
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,158
because I'll know
if you're not.

832
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,519
Pull it together, Morris.

833
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:00,146
[scream]

834
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,194
Oh my God! Look!
The Lafitte dolls came in!

835
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,559
Look, aren't they adorable?

836
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,324
I had this terrible dream
that Taylor was in our room.

837
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,729
Oh, it really is you.

838
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,910
We have to sell at least a
hundred at the even! tomorrow.

839
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,706
Okay.

840
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:26,009
Oh, and Brook, thank you
so much for the tip.

841
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,449
I've been drinking like a ton of
brandy and I'm feeling a lot better.

842
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,182
And I'm actually fitting into
my can't-breathe jeans again.

843
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,226
It's like that amazing time
I had (he stomach flu.

844
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:40,091
Anyways, you're the best.
I'll talk to you later.

845
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:42,460
Sleeping.
Like I care.

846
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,104
Okay, team.

847
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:51,366
How are we going to get people
dying to buy these dolls?

848
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,433
I know! We can give away a can
of my homemade mace as a prize.

849
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,102
[everyone]
No.

850
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,544
We can think
of something better-.

851
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,208
Come on, girls.
Let's sell some products.

852
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,583
Colton, you make
your own mace?

853
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:07,248
Yeah. I'm a chemistry major.

854
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,416
You're a chemistry major?

855
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,221
Yes, Brook.

856
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,387
I'm gonna became
a perfumer like Annick Goutal.

857
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:17,560
They're just upset
because my last prototype

858
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,328
burned some holes
through leather purses-.

859
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:20,629
But I've perfected it now.

860
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,000
Here. This one's for you-.

861
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,664
See, there's a place for keys on it
and there's a little flashlight.

862
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,071
Thank you, Cotton.

863
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,338
Use it wisely.
[both laugh]

864
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,505
Wait, at least I think
that's the one I perfected-.

865
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:35,976
Buy a doll.

866
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,484
Buy a doll,
play with balls!

867
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,796
Buy a doll,
play with balls.

868
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:51,425
Didn't Lady Gaga
wear that at the VMA's?

869
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,594
Brook?
Nu.

870
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,604
I recognize your voice.

871
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,106
Well, aren't you
just the great detective?

872
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,268
Okay, so let me
gel this straight'

873
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,313
You're a fighting crawdad who's
encouraging people to buy a doll

874
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,713
<i>so that they can play inside of
a giant inflatable child's my</i>

875
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:10,285
that's more of a liability
nightmare than anything else?

876
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:10,978
Bingo!

877
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:18,521
No! happening-

878
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,562
<i>The only thing you
will be kissing is my ass.</i>

879
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:24,724
I'm done. I'm done.
Screw the dolls, I'm done!

880
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,130
Have you sold
many dolls?

881
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,635
Believe it or not, no.

882
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,170
Where's everybody going?

883
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,137
Oh, the Alpha Lambda
Alpha carwash.

884
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,206
Alpha car wash'?

885
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,474
[cheering, talking]

886
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:05,770
It's basically prostitution
with detergent if you ask me.

887
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:10,903
<i>They are so lucky they
had bad childhoods.</i>

888
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,379
There's no way we're going to
sell all of our dolls in two days

889
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,110
with our clothes on.

890
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,684
We have lo come up
with something.

891
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,742
[screaming cheering]

892
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,685
Woooo!

893
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,690
We're going to win the
Lafitte Cup, I promise you.

894
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,724
How?

895
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,257
Just trust me.

896
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:33,132
<i>That guy looks
so much like Cameron.</i>

897
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,865
Come on.
Don't let me down.

898
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,540
There we are.

899
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,445
[shutter clicking]

900
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,654
Dr. Milton'?
Yes.

901
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,484
Have we met'?

902
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,222
No, but I can promise you you're
going to want to be my friend.

903
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,561
Really?
Really'

904
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,405
The waterbed one's
my favorite.

905
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,948
It really brings out
your smile.

906
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:22,006
It would be a great
Christmas card.

907
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,583
What do you want'?

908
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,023
Here you go, Dr. Milton.

909
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:31,650
Thank you.
I'm happy to help.

910
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:33,422
You know how important
this is to me.

911
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,191
The negatives
are in the box.

912
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,363
Are we done?

913
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:38,865
Yep. See you.

914
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,594
Thank you.

915
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,697
Brook, how'd you do it'?

916
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:47,537
<i>On, I just had
to convince him</i>

917
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,372
that all the sick kids
in his ward

918
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,776
deserve to love crawdaddys
like everybody else.

919
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,280
So Christian of him.

920
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,941
Talk about a man
with a big heart.

921
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,985
Yep, and he shares it
with everybody.

922
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,453
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you sold all our dolls!

923
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,887
[cheering]

924
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,502
Son of a hitch.

925
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,866
[knocking]

926
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,700
<i>Brook, hey.</i>

927
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,638
I know we've gotten off
to a rocky start

928
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,177
but I want to smooth
things over.

929
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:25,145
Come here.

930
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,672
Sister dysfunction is
just so toxic, you know?

931
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,343
Yeah.

932
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,478
Taylor says you helped
her water problem,

933
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,489
and Cotton says
you've been defending her

934
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,422
when Cameron
gels out of hand.

935
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,652
If it wasn't for you, we'd
never have sold those dolls

936
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,718
and everybody
obvi loves you.

937
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,993
My bracelet.

938
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,934
I would be honored
if you were to wear it-.

939
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,168
Cool, thanks.

940
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,267
No, really, Brook, where I come
from, (his is a really big deal.

941
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:59,677
But this is a bracelet, with
the words “Mother Green Earth'

942
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:03,583
surrounded by real crusted
pink moissanites.

943
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:07,918
Wow. Thanks, Sasha.
I love it.

944
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,615
Are you going
m put it on?

945
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,592
Duh!
[both lhugh]

946
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:18,192
OMFG, it's so cute.

947
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:22,533
<i>You threw the F in there,
so it must be super cute.</i>

948
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:34,309
Hi, Brook!
Good morning.

949
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,618
Good morning, Brook.

950
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:40,950
Hey, come eat with us.

951
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,114
I'll save you
a seal, okay?

952
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,247
Okay, cool.

953
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,890
Where did you gel that'?

954
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,261
Gel what?
The bracelet.

955
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:52,898
Oh, Sasha
gave it to me.

956
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,663
That's my bracelet.

957
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,635
That was my mother's
bracelet before.

958
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:57,967
Her name is
right there on it-.

959
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,268
That says Green Earth.

960
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,105
Your mom's name
was Green Earth?

961
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,474
Uh, yeah.

962
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,240
Was she a hippie?

963
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,976
No, Brook. She was 100%
Waccamaw-Siouan Indian.

964
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,641
Do you have
a problem with that?

965
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,016
No, it's just you don't
really look Indian.

966
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:14,180
I was adopted. Do you have
a problem with that'?

967
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:17,259
No. Sasha!
Sasha gave it to me.

968
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,294
Sasha, can you came here
for a minute, please?

969
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,987
Did you give Brook
this bracelet?

970
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,032
No, I don't think so. What?

971
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:29,093
That's your mother's
name, isn't it?

972
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,934
Okay. I see
what's going on here.

973
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,270
<i>Oh, my God, Brook.</i>

974
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,470
I think we found
our kleptomaniac.

975
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,947
That's my iPod.

976
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,609
That's my Eyelicious
moisturizer.

977
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,620
My neck massager?

978
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,553
There's going lo be
a hearing on (his, Brook.

979
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,453
You may be
out of the house.

980
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,993
You have no idea
who you're messing with.

981
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,794
I guess Cameron
was right about you, Brook.

982
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,165
You're no sister of mine.

983
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:05,367
Sasha set me up.
With who?

984
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:10,035
I didn't steal anything, Cotton.
I don'! believe you.

985
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:20,520
Hey, how's it going?

986
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,569
Klepto.

987
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:36,365
[indistinct]

988
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,365
Tell me something
good, please.

989
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,204
<i>I'm sorry, honey,
um I checked everything.</i>

990
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:44,371
I checked the Tenet system,
(he Texas DMV backlogs.

991
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,074
I checked six other record
and notification databases

992
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,878
and there's nothing
for a Sasha Stolezinsky-.

993
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,012
All right, it's fine-
I'll figure it out.

994
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,453
How are you'?

995
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:58,287
I'm going to a meeting.
Good.

996
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:02,186
I love you.
I love you, loo.

997
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:09,769
They don't hate you.

998
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,032
Yes, they do.

999
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,971
They think I'm a klepto.

1000
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,034
What are you doing?

1001
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,704
I'm making sure
I still have my wallet.

1002
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,409
Stop! I'm serious.

1003
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:22,973
They were just starting
to accept me,

1004
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:24,814
and now I've become
the enemy,

1005
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,219
which, trust me,
doesn't help anything.

1006
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,588
You're a girl. Didn't you deal
with (his stuff growing up?

1007
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:32,126
I worked a lot.

1008
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,388
What kind of work
did you do?

1009
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,295
Photography.
What, like weddings'?

1010
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:44,737
No, more nature photography.
Mostly dogs.

1011
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,274
They don't
hale you, Brook.

1012
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:50,173
Okay, nobody can hale you.
Thanks.

1013
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:55,408
I'm really happy you're here.
So am I.

1014
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,076
You're amazing.

1015
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,086
Well, ifs actually
my balls are amazing.

1016
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,450
That doesn't make sense.

1017
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,285
You're the one
that said it.

1018
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:03,825
I have to go.

1019
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,695
Now I have to go.

1020
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,808
[crowd noise]

1021
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,109
Okay, Sasha.

1022
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,684
Here we go.

1023
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,697
Oh, it's you.

1024
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,699
I was hoping
you were a kidnapper.

1025
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,099
Nope. Just me. Everybody's
least favorite Kappa sister.

1026
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:24,400
You know they already
have a nickname for you?

1027
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,337
I won'! tell you if you
don't want to hear it.

1028
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,773
Thanks.

1029
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,674
Fingers.
Fingers Stonebridge.

1030
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,340
That's an improvement
over Brook, don't you think?

1031
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,445
Becky, I'm not a klepto.

1032
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,019
What's that'?

1033
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,214
Something I stole
from Sasha's room.

1034
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,620
Oh, my God. Becky,
you've got to see this.

1035
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,463
That's Sasha!

1036
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:50,861
Yeah, but it's not
her real name.

1037
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,486
There are just so many
fake girls in this house.

1038
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:15,887
I just hate lake people,
don't you, Sasha?

1039
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,153
What do you want'?

1040
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,493
Your name's Suzy Walters,
no! Sasha Stolezinsky.

1041
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:26,226
You never modeled
in Croatia.

1042
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,462
You've never
even been to Croatia.

1043
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,164
You were working at a Taco Bell

Why do you
have a gun, Brook?

1046

Because I'm here
looking for someone

1047

who's not who they say
they are, and I found you.

1048

Brook, what do you have
to say for yourself?

1067

Kleptomania is a disease.

1068

It's all about bulimia in this
house and I totally gel um.

1069
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:41,336
But we shouldn't cast off
the kleptomaniac

1070
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:44,208
because they also
have a disease.

1071

01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:58,703
What ledgers'?

1216
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:01,078
Accounting ledgers.

1217
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:03,481
Jason had kept
Kashalov's books.

1218
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,382
A bargaining chip.

1219
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:10,413
But she wouldn't tell
anyone where they were-.

1220
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,958
Not even me.

1221
01:14:15,718 --> 01:14:17,664
The bargaining chip.
[bat phone beeps]

1222
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:27,968
[sirens approaching]
That's what Armon wants.

1223
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:28,974
The ledgers.

1224
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:38,444
'The killer could be
anybody...' Molly.

1225
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:40,248
<i>“Somebody who's not
who they say they are.'</i>

1226
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,754
What are you doing?

1227
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,290
'Somebody who gels
close to Alex."

1228
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:45,348
You're only making
(his thing worse.

1229
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:47,985
Me. I was the killer
the whole time.

1230
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:50,758
Bravo. You pack
a mean punch.

1231
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,595
Now I know why
you didn't kill me-.

1232
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,532
You needed me
lo take the fall for you.

1233
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,467
Smart. See you actually did
learn something in college'

1234
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:58,937
Who's Bizzy?

1235
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,474
It doesn't matter
now, does it?

1236
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,509
You killed her.
I did not kill her.

1237
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,280
We had to cover our tracks
on this (hing, okay?

1238
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,337
I didn't kill her.

1239
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:11,815
Give me Alex and I give
you the ledgers.

1240
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,682
You heard me.
I found them.

1241
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,187
I'll give you fifty
thousand for them.

1242
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,852
No, you brought me here
to protect Alex Patrone...

1243
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:23,988
and that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

1244
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:25,862
What are you doing?

1245
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:28,026
You're going to protect
some sorority bitch?

1246
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,161
You know you really
got me with that

1247
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:32,331
“do something real, make a
difference, join (he FBI' bullshit'

1248
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:34,534
I had lo say something.

1249
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,632
Answer the phone
when it rings.

1250
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,975
If you have me followed, the
ledgers go (0 the real FBI'

1251
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,708
Yeah.
Got it?

1252
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:43,841
Oh, and that sorority bitch
is my Kappa sister.

1253
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:48,913
What time did Brook
leave the house?

1254
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:52,049
I do not know.
I am not my sister's keeper.

1255
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:54,822
What time do you
anticipate her return?

1256
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,592
[door opens]

1257
01:15:58,587 --> 01:15:59,224
Molly Morris?

1258
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:01,997
FBI.

1259
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,901
Molly Morris?

1260
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,101
Agent Sanderson
is very weak,

1261
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:09,506
but he did let us know
that you've been helpful.

1262
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:13,342
We checked and there's nobody in the
Kashalov family named Armon Ranford.

1263
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,439
Then obviously he used
a fake name with me.

1264
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:17,711
We'll figure all
of that out eventually.

1265
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,616
It's what we do.

1266
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,346
So (hank you
for your help, Molly,

1267
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,014
but we're going
lo take over from here.

1268
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,252
No!

1269
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,793
No. I started the job
and I'm going to finish it.

1270
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,864
Miss Morris, with all due
respect, we're the FBI

1271
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,197
and you're a young Pl who specializes
in infidelity photography.

1272
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,759
Ms. Keller, do you
have Alex Patrons?

1273
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:39,931
And 'with all due respect,'
do you have the ledgers?

1274
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:41,872
No.

1275
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,911
He brought me here to find
out who (he FBI mole was

1276
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:46,970
to lead him to the ledgers
and for me to take the fall.

1277
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:48,548
He thinks he got
two out of three.

1278
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,106
He thinks he killed
Agent Sanderson

1279
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:51,947
and I'm gonna take
the blame for it.

1280
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:53,748
But he doesn't have the ledgers.
Nobody does.

1281
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:55,220
Do you?

1282
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,881
No, but I know
where they are.

1283
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,550
He's waiting
for me to call him.

1284
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,719
I can deliver him to you,
but he's smart.

1285
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:03,229
He's going to throw us a curve
and we need to anticipate that.

1286
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,458
Why don't you let us
worry about that'!

1287
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:09,127
I'm telling you, if there's one
thing my experience has taught me,

1288
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:11,068
it's always have
a contingency.

1289
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,913
Brook, what is going on'?

1290
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:23,746
What's platinum rule number one
in the Kappa chapter book?

1291
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,513
Never wear sweatpants.

1292
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:27,246
Rule number two'?

1293
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,516
A sister in need comes
before anything else.

1294
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:32,957
Girls, we have
a sister in need.

1295
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:41,135
Molly, the second
he grabs the ledgers,

1296
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,136
you need to get
on the ground quickly.

1297
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:45,934
My roommate's freaked about these.
They're clue tomorrow.

1298
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,134
It doesn't matter that these
aren't the real ledgers.

1299
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:49,437
I know.

1300
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,102
Once he has them in hand,

1301
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,941
we can get him for obstruction.
Exactly.

1302
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,845
From there, we can deal
with him to give up Alex-.

1303
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,884
[agent in distance]
Agent Keller...

1304
01:17:57,973 --> 01:18:00,453
We're gonna come in
fast and hard.

1305
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,348
I found (his on a pile
of Talloway's graded papers.

1306
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:10,456
Don't tell anybody, but I
couldn't agree with you more.

1307
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,897
RICO was a complete
Nixon hustle.

1308
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:22,241
[crowd noise]

1309
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:51,062
Alpha One, do you have
a visual on Molly. Over.

1310
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,163
<i>We have her in our sights.</i>

1311
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,904
<i>Alpha Two?
Affirmative.</i>

1312
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:05,711
[Armon]
Molly!

1313
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:07,549
You look great.

1314
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:09,112
Okay, this is it.
Be ready people.

1315
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:12,021
Where's Alex?
Alex who?

1316
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,025
What are you doing?

1317
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,117
Here.

1318
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,229
I don't want those.

1319
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,428
What are you doing?

1320
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,129
Excuse me. I actually have
lo take this call.

1321
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:27,435
Ow!
[agents yen]

1322
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:30,533
That was a low portal
frequency jammer.

1323
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,307
I used to be a fed.
Can you imagine that'?

1324
01:19:34,637 --> 01:19:36,241
Where'd they go'?

1325
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:37,807
Somebody give me
a location on Armon.

1326
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:39,078
Alpha One,
do you have Molly?

1327
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,417
<i>Alpha Two ?</i>

1328
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:43,150
Now that I think about it,

1329
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,589
they actually did teach us
how to detect lies.

1330
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:48,923
Yeah, and obviously how to tell them.
Totes.

1331
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:51,898
I have to give it
to you, Morris.

1332
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,797
You know haw
to play (he game.

1333
01:19:57,826 --> 01:19:59,499
What are these'?
The ledgers'

1334
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:02,405
Kashalov never dealt
in widgets.

1335
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,909
Where are
the real ledgers?

1336
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,912
I don't know.
That's all I have.

1337
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,413
Where are
the real ledgers?

1338
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,005
I don't know.
That's all I have.

1339
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,084
I'll take care
of both of you at once-.

1340
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,484
Brook! I found the journal
thingies you were looking for.

1341
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,020
Cotton, not now.

1342
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,784
No, not now.
Like eight minutes ago.

1343
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:18,824
Who's this?

1344
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:19,858
Brook's dad.

1345
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:21,928
Hi.

1346
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,430
Princess, why don't you introduce
me to your friend here'?

1347
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:25,931
This is Cotton.

1348
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,695
You came all the way
from Hawaii?

1349
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:31,431
Of course. I'd go anywhere
for my little girl.

1350
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,599
So where are the journal
thingies you were talking about?

1351
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,937
Are you okay, Brook'?

1352
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,038
You're looking at me all weird like
I'm being insipid or something.

1353
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:43,616
Where are the journal thingies you
were talking about, Cinnamon?

1354
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,618
İt's Cotton.
It doesn't mailer.

1355
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,153
They're in the Chapter Room-.

1356
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:48,620
Thank you so much.
Nice meeting you.

1357
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,020
You, ton.

1358
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:01,158
Don't worry about her.
She's a little sedated.

1359
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:03,703
I need you to take me
to the Chapter Room.

1360
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:05,794
See what kind
of skills you got.

1361
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:17,977
Okay, Molly, ifs all
going according to plan.

1362
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,819
You're doing great. Alex is going to he fine.
Just stay calm.

1363
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,505
This car is rigged.

1364
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,405
If anyone tries
m get m Alex

1365
01:21:42,498 --> 01:21:45,274
I hit the trigger on this
phone and the car explodes.

1366
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,005
There's a bomb
under the car.

1367
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,605
The keys are in his
jacket pocket. Go now!

1368
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,118
Excuse me.

1369
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,522
[Nicholas]
Brook! We need to talk!

1370
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:00,685
Oh, no.

1371
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,251
Who the hell is this'?

1372
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:03,625
A guy I'm dating.

1373
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:05,062
You're dating this guy'?

1374
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,394
Wait a minute.
You're dating?

1375
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:08,025
No not this guy!
Really?

1376
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,535
What the hell
is going on?

1377
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,036
Is he a student?

1378
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:12,470
I can't talk
about this right now.

1379
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:14,097
Why not'?

1380
01:22:14,196 --> 01:22:15,698
When do you have lime
lo date someone?

1381
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,300
Where's the chapter
room, Molly'?

1382
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,401
Who the hell is Molly?
Hold on a second.

1383
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:21,106

w a radiator,</i>

1384
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:22,876
you bust me in the head,
(hen steal my bike.

1385
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,383
It was nothing personal.

1386
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,283
Wasn't personal?
You led me on!

1387
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:28,321
You tricked me into liking
you, (hen beat me down.

1388
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,822
It's not a good--
You like me?

1389
01:22:30,913 --> 01:22:33,621
When this is all over, I would
like a proper introduction.

1390
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,422
Where the hell
is the Chapter Room?

1391
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:36,724
It's right there!

1392
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:37,286
Come on.

1393
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:40,756
Where are
(he ledgers, huh?

1394
01:22:42,925 --> 01:22:44,063
[Spraying sound]

1395
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,571
What is that'?
Mace.

1396
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,800
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.

1397
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:50,001
No, Nicholas.

1398
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:52,100
What's your problem?

1399
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,306
[Yells]

1400
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:02,081
What you got
Bonus Jonas? Bring it.

1401
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,624
[shouting, crashing]

1402
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,670
Bravo, but you know
all I have to do

1403
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,536
<i>s press nine on this (hing</i>

1404
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,372
and that car blows up.

1405
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,946
You're lying.
Am I?

1406
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,608
Because you and I both know how
easy it is to make a cocktail

1407
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:33,118
out of nitrocellulose and ketone,
slide it under the back seat.

1408
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:35,018
You recognize
(his phone, don't you?

1409
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,023
It's outfitted with the
discontinued 6300 vibrator

1410
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:40,059
(ha! can send a signal.

1411
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:44,456
Give me the gun.

1412
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,057
Give me the gun!

1413
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:58,973
You still want to see if I'm
bluffing or not, don't you?

1414
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,069
No.

1415
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:02,170
Here we go.
No!

1416
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,555
I don't think so.

1417
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,688
Who's that?

1418
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:19,824
I'm the contingency.

1419
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:27,272
I think I gotta sit dawn.

1420
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:28,340
[groans]

1421
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:31,406
[groans]

1422
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,446
You're in big
trouble, Armon.

1423
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,344
There's no boys allowed
in the chapter room.

1424
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,113
Oh, everything's so pink-.

1425
01:24:43,946 --> 01:24:46,392
Alex!

1426
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:47,722
Hey, Molly!

1427
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:49,353
Oh, my Gad.
How did you--

1428
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,364
Well, Sasha.

1429
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,421
It's a disease.

1430
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:56,868
Good klepto.

1431
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,097
How'd I do?

1432
01:24:58,193 --> 01:24:59,467
You did great, Cotton.

1433
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,040
[Armon]
Put me in, Coach!

1434
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,269
No more of that
stinking root beer.

1435
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:06,710
Drop and give me 20, God.
Drop and give me 20!

1436
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,442
The FBI's gonna be here soon.
Why don'( you go watch him?

1437
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:11,575
[sirens approaching]

1438
01:25:15,077 --> 01:25:18,650
I need the ledgers
now, Alex.

1439
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:19,782
Yeah.

1440
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,070
[Armon] I want to go
to Candy Mountain,

1441
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,834
and float on the tears
of unicorns.

1442
01:25:33,929 --> 01:25:35,931
<i>Are those real?</i>

1443
01:25:35,998 --> 01:25:39,070
I got the kill shot from here,
but I don't know if I can pay!

1444
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:43,139
Maybe I put too much basidiomycoda
fungus in (he mace'?

1445
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:45,514
It's glorious.

1446
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:49,783
Wait, maybe I wasn't supposed to put
basidiomycoda fungus in the mace.

1447
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:53,816
[laughing, then crying]

1448
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:05,329
You can tum that car into a
jungle gym if you want, girls.

1449
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:06,770
Knock yourself out.

1450
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,364
I missed you.

1451
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:09,635
I am so proud of you.

1452
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:11,439
I'm proud of you, too.

1453
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,343
Well, I'm your father,
so let me be proud first.

1454
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:19,949
Good work, Morris. The FBI
could use someone like you.

1455
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:25,458
Thank you, but I think I'm gonna
stick around here and go ta college.

1456
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,960
But my dad could use some help
getting back on (he force.

1457
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,324
Molly.
What?

1458
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:31,489
We'll see
what we can do.

1459
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,226
Make it happen.

1460
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:34,629
The ledgers.

1461
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,829
The ledgers'?

1462
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:38,997
Consider it done, Morris.

1463
01:26:39,061 --> 01:26:40,301
Welcome back.

1464
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:41,705
Thank you.

1465
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:43,333
You're gonna
be a cop again.

1466
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:44,900
Brook.

1467
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:49,174
Dad, this is Nicholas.

1468
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:52,049
Hi. Nice lo meet you, sir.

1469
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:53,985
Who hit you'?

1470
01:26:57,179 --> 01:26:58,157
Your daughter.

1471
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,318
Yeah, she did.

1472
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:04,728
Yeah. I'm just gonna leave you
guys to get to know each other.

1473
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,925
Hey, Brook.
It's Molly.

1474
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:08,524
I mean, Molly.
Come over here.

1475
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,501
Wait, her name's Molly?

1476
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:13,403
I'm a cop, Nicholas. Just
something to think about.

1477
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:15,835
I'm so proud of you guys.

1478
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,843
<i>OMG, we are
so bad ass.</i>

1479
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,243
I'm really happy
you're my sorority sister-.

I hear some of those
Easy Alpha girls

(he Sorority Council.

1483
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,011
How do we know
who they are?

1484
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,520
We'll go undercover.

1485
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,784
[all laugh]

1486
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:33,223
[Cotton] Wait, are
we with the FBI now?

1487
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:35,056
Do we gel a gun'?

1488
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,790
Can I have a pink gun'?

1489
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,482
Why did you do that'?

1490
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,789
What're you
doing, Sherlock?

1491
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:07,451
Outlaws dating this new guy

1492
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:09,722
<i>so I told her I'd check
him out for her.</i>

01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:12,561
Ah, yes.
Nature photography.

1494
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,793
So what's up
with this guy?

1495
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:15,459
So far, so good.

1496
01:28:15,557 --> 01:28:17,559
He's getting his PhD
in Quantum physics,

1497
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:21,096
so they'll definitely be on
the same page intellectually.

1498
01:28:21,163 --> 01:28:23,234
<i>That's cool for you
w do that for her,</i>

1499
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:27,747
because people often aren't who
they say they are, you know?

1500
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:30,943
They lie. Molly, they let
each other down.

1501
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,112
How long are you
gonna do this for?

1502
01:28:34,176 --> 01:28:36,122
A couple of years.
Maybe ten'

1503
01:28:36,178 --> 01:28:37,953
Ten years.

1504
01:28:38,013 --> 01:28:40,357
You're the detective.
Why don't you figure it out?

1505
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:48,765
This is getting
in the way.

1506
01:29:05,307 --> 01:29:08,186
Let's go everybody.
Watch the lights, guys.

1507
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:09,880
Ready, and background...

1508

I myself am
an Aikido man.

1509
01:29:12,314 --> 01:29:14,191
Aikido is a fashionable way
for fat housewives

1510
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,057
to lose weight
at their local Equinox.

1511
01:29:16,151 --> 01:29:17,562
Are you calling me
a fat housewife?

1512
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:18,460
Yep.

1513
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,794
Look---...

1514
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:20,856
I'm a fat housewife

1515
01:29:20,956 --> 01:29:22,867
<i>- Yes.
- Really?</i>

1516
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:25,871
And rolling.

1517
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:28,874
[silly noises]

1518
01:29:28,964 --> 01:29:31,808
[evil crazy laugh]

1519
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:33,972
Let's go guys.

1520
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,036
Let's make a movie.

1521
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:36,410
Quiet, please.

1522
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:37,812
I'm not like
most girls.

1523
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:39,079
Well, Brook
Stonebridge is--

1524
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:40,482
Who's Brook Stonebridge?

1525
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,681
[laughing]

1526
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,157
Set, and...

1527
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,993
Sorry, but these
are so fucking spicy.

1528
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:54,590
[coughs
everyone laughs]

1529
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:00,170
That's an entrance!

1530
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:03,209
I'll find out
if you're not.

1531
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:08,914
[Miley screams
and runs]

1532
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:11,848
I'll find out
if you're not.

1533
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,284
All right.

1534
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:18,714
[both crack up]

1535
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,525
Still rolling,
and ready.

1536
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:26,031
What am I doing?
Fur real?

1537
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:29,296
Dude. Wait. Now what
do you want me to do?

1538
01:30:29,391 --> 01:30:30,870
Jump off the side'?

1539
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,769
Me.
What am I doing?

1540
01:30:32,861 --> 01:30:34,238
Ju-jit-su.

1541
01:30:34,296 --> 01:30:36,207
You're well-versed
in ju-jit-su.

1542
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,971
You heard o! the--

1543
01:30:38,066 --> 01:30:43,709
[nonsense babble]
Ju-jit-su.

1544
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:47,117
If that ends up anywhere,
I'm gonna kill you.

1545
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:51,315
I'm like,
totally undercover.

1546
01:30:51,413 --> 01:30:53,893
<i>I'm like,
so undercover.</i>

1547
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:56,828
I'm so undercover.
