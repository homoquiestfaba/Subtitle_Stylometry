It's futile.

Well, I, uh...

94
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,848
I grew up with my little sister, Naledi.

95
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,885
Our mother and father died
when... I was three.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,365
Oh, that's...

97
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,727
Oh, no, no, no.
We, we were raised by my uncle.

98
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,923
He's like a father to us.
We've been very fortunate.

99
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,368
How about you? If I...

100

about you I couldn't possibly guess?

We were evacuated to the countryside,
Muriel and I,

102
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,611
but I couldn't bear the boredom.

103
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,610
So I asked them
to take me at Friston, the airfield.

104
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,449
I drove the crash ambulance for them.

105

107
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,603
I looked it up, you know, your country.

108
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,844
The size of France
and 121,000 inhabitants.

109
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,201
And one of the poorest countries
in the world.

110
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,685
Is that right?

111
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,442
(Seretse) We asked for the protection
of Queen Victoria.

112
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,206
And she agreed. Eventually.

113
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,961
It was that, or face invasion
from a racialist South Africa.

114
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,807
- (Ruth) Sounds like no choice at all.
- What is the saying?

115
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,641
"No man is free,
who is not master of himself."

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,764
I wish we could see the stars.

117
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,727
They take your breath away
back in Bechuanaland.

118
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,407
It never fails to astonish me.

119
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,443

(Ruth chuckles)

121
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,924
(Ruth) We should stop here.

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,001
My father, he wouldn't approve.

123
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,683
I'm just two streets away.
Can we do this again?

124
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,565
I mean, meet?

125
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,250
Is that too forward of me?

126
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,725
No.

127
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,322
- No, it...
- What?

128
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,806
Queen Victoria...

129
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,762
The man who negotiated for
her protection of Bechuanaland...

130
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,085
he was my grandfather.

131
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,725
A king.

132
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,564
I am his heir.

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,243
For more than 20 years, my uncle
has been on the throne as regent

134

preparing me to rule.

135
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,164
My education is now complete,

136
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,408
and it is time for me to return.

137
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,968
Oh. I see.

138
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,887
Thank you. Thank you for explaining.

139
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,324
Not simply disappearing.

140
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,930
I quite understand.

141
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,930
I have had a wonderful evening.

142
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,211
Ruth.

143
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,441
No, I-I-I don't think you do understand.

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,923
I don't know what happened tonight.

145
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,806
But I do know that I would hate to walk
away from you here in this moment,

146
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,968
knowing that I wouldn't see you again.

147
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,371
Well, then you must.

148
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,690
See me again, I mean.

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,766
Father will hate him on sight.

155
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,326
He's clever than him and he's black.

156
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,002
- Oh!
- Yes, yes, yes!

157

Have you ever been in love?

159
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,405
No.

160
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,120
And then Ruth Williams came along.

161
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,044
(Passer-by) Look, it's a coon.

162

Cheap slut!

165
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,170

- Yeah?

166
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,567
- Seretse...
- Don't!

167
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,611
- Ruth...
- Oi! Get your black hands off what's ours!

168
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,085

172
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,410

a second thought.

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,371
Then what is it?

179
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,365
It scares me a bit.

180
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,729
The way he makes me feel.

181
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,206
Ruth, he has to go back
to his own country.

182
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,765
I know.

183
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,886
Just let me enjoy it while it lasts.

184
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,809
- Am I late?
- No. No, not at all.

185
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,285
Is something the matter?

186
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,130
I have been... thinking
about my responsibilities

187
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,402
back home in Bechuanaland.

188
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,891
There is so much
that I need to do there.

189
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,650
But I know that I will never
achieve anything worthwhile...

190
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,641
...if I leave my heart here.

191
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,921
Uh, I'm not asking for an answer
this, this very second.

192
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,211
All I, all I ask of you is that you...

193
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,168
...go away and, and think about it,

194
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,285
Because, uh, there...
there is a lot to think about.

195
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,843
And...

196
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,007
I don't need to think about it.

197
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,611
I know I love you.

198
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,204
And I know what you're asking.

199
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,530
What it means.

200
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,325
And yes.

201
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,090
Yes.

202
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,725
Yes, Seretse, I will marry you.

203
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,731
White? British? Oh, God.

204
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,524
And she's a salesman's daughter!

205
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,769
I don't care if her mother sells fish
in the market! I love her!

206
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,451
Aren't you supposed
to ask for your uncle's consent

207
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,011
before you ask for her hand?

208
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,525
And your people?

209
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,171
(Clicks tongue)

210
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,171
(Seretse) 'Dear Uncle...

211
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,761
'...I realise this won't please you.

212
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,883
'You and the tribe won't like it.

213
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,245
'I have asked an Englishwoman
to marry me.

214
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,651
'A white woman.'

215
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,165
(Creaking)

216
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,446
It will not happen.

217
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,405
It Will.

218
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,322
What in God's name is wrong with you?

219
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,327
At least Muriel
only wants to convert them!

220
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,401
I've said yes.

221
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,727
- She might change her mind, George.
- She won't!

222
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,927
Mum, I've met the man
I want to spend my life with.

223
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,771
And how many other wives
do you think he's already got, eh?

224
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,371
- You disgust me.
- George, don't.

225
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,363
You think about this, Ruth.

226
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,923
You marry a black,
you make it impossible for us.

227
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,083
For your mother, for Muriel.

228
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,445
You may choose
a life of insults and shame...

229
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,925
...but what about us?

230
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,045
We've only ever loved you.

231
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,531
Father...

232
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,930
I can't see you again.

233
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,445
Not if you choose him.

234
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,802
(Seretse pants)

235
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,364
This... is not how I wanted it to be.

236
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,329
You separated from your family.

237
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,284
I have fears, Ruth.

238
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,801
Not just about this, but... my uncle.

239
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,764
You can't take us all this way
to tell me you have fears!

240
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,370
Not for me, for you!

241
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,966
For everything
I am asking you to sacrifice.

242
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,727
Can you... even imagine a life in Africa?

243
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,765
Yes.

244
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,369
We'll take it moment by moment,
won't we?

245
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,931
Together.

246
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,441
(Typewriters clacking)

247
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,886
Morning, ladies.

248
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,401
An early tea break for you all.

249
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,889
I need to speak to Miss Williams.

250
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,802
(indistinct chatter)

251
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,010
Ruth, uh, there's a gentleman
to see you.

252
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,449
Good morning.

253
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,409
(Manager) I'll leave you to it.

254
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,968
- Sir Alistair Canning.
- (Door closes)

255
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,522
I am the British Government
representative in southern Africa.

256
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,246
And yet I find myself in London today.

257
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,849
Because it is my duty to inform you

258
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,406
that Mr Seretse Khama
has been gravely mistaken

259
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,609
in believing he may take you
as his wife.

260
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,808
A marriage between you
cannot take place.

261
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,443
A chief cannot simply come to London,

262
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,843
and pluck a girl out of a typing pool.

263
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,371
I'm not a typist.

264
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,164
Any union between you and Mr Khama
will have implications

265
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,047
for the not-insignificant neighbouring
countries of Bechuanaland.

266
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,440
Not least South Africa,

267
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,640
the prime minister of which is currently
enshrining into law the policy of...

268
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,650
The policy of apartheid.

269
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,205
Do you know this word?

270
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,805
(Lighter clicks)

271
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,251
No.

272
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,130
No. Well, it is this...

273
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,284
The black must live separately
from the white.

274
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,045
He must attend
his own school, hospital, church,

275
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,410
and he must never conjoin
with a white woman.

276
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,885
Your entry in Africa with him

277
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,767
would be seen as a flagrant disregard
for the current political climate.

278
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,447
It would be an act more powerful
than your limited experience

279
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,602
will allow you to comprehend.

280
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,286
We have already heard the presidents
of South Africa, southwest Africa

281
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,243
and the Rhodesias.

282
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,160
Yet all demanding that
this marriage not take place.

283
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,965
As a matter of diplomatic necessity.

284
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,805
I take it you need no more from me

285
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,241
to confirm that
you will not marry this man.

286
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,841
I will confirm nothing of the kind.

287
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,804
Have you no shame?

288
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,649
The British administration may dictate
many things in my country,

289
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,967
but they will not dictate who I marry.

290
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,691
They are trying to define us,
based on their rules,

291
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,041
their idea of the world,
and how they see it.

292
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,328
Seretse, do you hear yourself?

293
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,004
These men are at the very top
of government. They're powerful.

294
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,640
- Muriel, stop interfering.
- Stop it! Both of you!

295
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,245
Ruth...

296
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,288
Father won't talk to you.

297
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,051
You're called a whore in the street,
and now this.

298
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,127
You know how much I love Seretse.

299
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,207
But you don't have to do this.

300
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,531
Muriel, I've never wanted anything
like I want this.

301
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,205
(Knock at door)

302
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,411
Enter.

303
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,245
Sir.

304
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,930
(Canning) Mr Khama.

305
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,691
Good morning.

306
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,445
Sir Alistair Canning.

307
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,840
How do you do?

308
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,646
I believe you've met my fiancée,
Ruth Williams.

309
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,171
- Indeed.
- Sir.

310
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,441
We are told you can provide us
with some information, Sir Alistair.

311
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,170
Well, if I can,

312
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,968
then I most certainly will.

313
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,129
(Seretse) Who exactly has asked you
to interfere with my wish to marry?

314
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,284
I will tell you... exactly.

315
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,722
I received advice
from the Archbishop of Canterbury,

316
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,845
who was instructed by the Secretary
of State for Commonwealth Affairs,

317
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,409
who was himself instructed
by the solicitor, Douglas Buchanan,

318
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,802
who was, in turn,
instructed by his client,

319
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,003
your uncle, Tshekedi Khama.

320
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,331
So, you see...

321
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,963
...everyone here,
and in southern Africa,

322
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,243
is acting entirely according
to the wishes... of your uncle.

323
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,891
I knew he wouldn't take it well,
that he'd be angry with me,

324
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,321
but why is he allowing himself
to be used by them?

325
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,761
It's only you and I
who want us to be together.

326
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,291
No one else.

327
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,086
You are the only one
I want to spend my life with.

328
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,000
There's nothing in law
that says we cannot marry.

329
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,724
(Seretse) Have you got the rings?

330
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,162
(indistinct chatter)

331
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,850
(Registrar) It is with pleasure
I pronounce you man and wife.

332
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,848
May I offer you my congratulations?

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,923
(Cheering and laughter)

334
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,929
(Ruth) Thank you so much.

335
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,842
(indistinct chatter)

336
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,171
Mrs Khama...

337
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,850
(Reporters clamouring)

338
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,251
Mrs Khama, do you intend
to learn the native language?

339
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,324
- I will try, yes.
- And I will give her plenty of help.

340
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,605
Mr Khama, I hear your tribe are rebelling
against you bringing a white queen home,

341
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,609
according to South Africa
this morning.

342
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,240
South Africa has her own agenda.

343
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,442
Perhaps you should report on that.

344
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,204
Thank you. That'll be all.

345
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,322
(Clamouring)

346
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,205
Rebelling?

347
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,091
It's exaggeration. It has to be.

348
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,205
(Reporter) 'Bechuanaland chief from the
southern African British protectorate...'

349
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,369
(Reporter 2) 'Office girl, Ruth Khama,
will travel to Africa...'

350
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,171
(Reporter 3) 'Bechuanaland
will meet their new queen...'

351
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,522
(Reporters clamouring)

352
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,081
Mrs Khama... welcome.

353
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,642
(Clamouring)

354
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,127
Will your family be coming to visit?

355
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,004
- (Speaks Setswana)
- Sir.

356
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,247
(Sighs) Sir Alistair Canning
wants to meet before I see my uncle.

357
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,011
(Porter) Good afternoon, sir.

358
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,650
(Car door closes)

359
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,282
I have special dispensation as the king.

360
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,687
But we use a different entrance.

361
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,331
(Canning) Mr and Mrs Khama.

362
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,442
Welcome, Mrs Khama.

363
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,364
Thank you.

364
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,683
We didn't want to leave it too long
before Ruth could see her new home.

365
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,722
What would you like to drink,
Mrs Khama?

366
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,604
Gin and lime would be lovely.

367
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,848
(Canning)
We have lemonade for you, Mr Khama.

368
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,241
You are aware of the prohibition
of alcohol for blacks in Bechuanaland?

369
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,003
Well, if my husband is having lemonade,
then I will have lemonade.

370
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,003
Ah, here he is! It's our new district
commissioner, Mr Rufus Lancaster.

371
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,611
How do you do, Mr Khama?

372
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,085
A pleasure.

373
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,882
- Mrs Khama.
- How do you do?

374
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,123
Let me pour you that lemonade.

375
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,882
(Canning) I've asked Mr Lancaster along

376
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,241
to give you an assessment of affairs
in Serowe,

377
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,251
in light of your meeting at the kgotla,
Mr Khama.

378
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,607
You would like to tell me
how my people are feeling?

379
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,520
80% of the people
support your uncle's refusal

380
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,246
to accept your wife
as queen of your tribe.

381
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,850
May I ask how you arrived
at that figure, Mr Lancaster?

382
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,282
We are recommending that you resign
any claim to the chieftainship,

383
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,324
and that you announce that fact
to your tribe with a meeting.

384
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,284
The kgotla, Sir Alistair,

385
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,131
is the place where
our tribal decisions are made,

386
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,687
where every man has his say.

387
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,408
There, and only there, can the support or
dissatisfaction of my people be measured.

388
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,042
Where they will decide whether
they wish for me to remain king.

389
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,682
I believe you call it democracy.

390
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,047
(Lancaster) Mr Khama,
you understand the risks you're taking.

391
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,601
You're forcing the tribe to take sides.

392
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,768
This could cause a dangerous divide.

393
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,770
Make your country... ungovernable.

394
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,126
And it would open up South Africa's
claim to annex Bechuanaland.

395
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,281
Britain has long prevented it.

396
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,169
But for how much longer?

397
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,008
Lancaster just about got
through the evening

398
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,766
without calling me
an ungrateful nigger.

399
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,570
Can they really hand over
an entire country just like that?

400
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,125
They wouldn't risk it.

401
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,529
Malan's regime has very little support
from the British public.

402
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,129
But you're worried.

403
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,721
You know, I've seen the news reels.
I know what's happening in South Africa.

404
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,804
It's poison,
and it's already affecting you here.

405
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,440
That sign outside.

406
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,250
You have those in England too.

407
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,646
I know.

408
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,806
No blacks, no Irish, no dogs.

409
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,882
But I didn't expect it
in your own country.

410
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,571
(Sighs deeply) Come.

411
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,808
It's your first night in Bechuanaland.
I don't want you to be sad.

412
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,170
Let us not allow
the ugliness of this world

413
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,009
to take our joy away from us.

414
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,645
(Ruth sighs)

415
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,926
Another!

416
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,609
(Both laugh)

417
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,044
Oh...

418
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,441
- Shh, shh.
- What?

419
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,127
Can you hear that?
It's the music from the bar.

420
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,450
Dance with me.

421
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,248
Whoo! Oh!

422
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,727
(Both laugh)

423
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,325
What...? Ah!

424
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,371
(Lighter clicks)

425
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,045
(Seretse) My home.

426
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,371
Our home.

427
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,802
(Villagers shouting)

428
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,922
White woman.

429
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,082
(indistinct chatter)

430
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,364
Is that your mother?

431
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,851
(Seretse sniffs)

432
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,731
Uh, no.
No, that is my Uncle Tshekedi's mother.

433
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,731
That is me on the day
he became a regent.

434
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,770
(Goats bleating)

435
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,325
(Engine stops)

436
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,690
(Car door closes)

437
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,570
(Tshekedi speaks Setswana)

438
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,368
Uncle... this is Ruth.

439
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,727
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

440
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,729
I will speak to my nephew alone.

441
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,690
Refreshments will be provided
for her in the house.

442
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,922
Over two decades of preparing you
to be our king,

443
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,923
and this is how you face me.

444
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,809
A white woman by your side.

445
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,201
- Uncle...
- Are you trying to tear us apart?

446
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,330
I am Naledi, Seretse's sister.

447
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,649
Naledi.

448
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,604
- Seretse's told me so much.
- Please don't.

449
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,290
Why would you do this to us?

450
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,204
To yourself?

451
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,767
Be somewhere and be something
that makes no sense to you?

452
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,609
Look at them.

453
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,609
They are fighting because of you.

454
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,451
I mean you no harm.

455
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,126
Do you understand what mother,
mother, of our nation means?

456
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,684
(Speaks Setswana)

457
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,687
I married Seretse's uncle
knowing my responsibility.

458
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,448
That one day Seretse's wife
would be chosen from our nation,

459
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,443
and I would hand over to her.

460
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,290
We have waited years for the day
we would see her rule by his side.

461
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,326
Your first duty is to your people.

462
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,930
Your nation.

463
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,284
Seretse, you're a son to me.

464
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,603
Please... be my son.

465
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,571
I will entertain you in my home,
if that is my husband's wish.

466
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,527
But don't insult us.

467
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,210
It's...

468
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,209
...audacious of you to come here,

469
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,010
and present yourself married,

470
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,640
as if it were your right to be our queen.

471
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,369
Who do you think will accept you?
The men?

472
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,289
- I...
- Us? The women?

473
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,601
To have a white woman
who we must love

474
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,644
and trust and respect as our sovereign?

475
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,527
(Laughs mockingly)

476
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,124
Whoo.

477
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,244
You belong to the whites,
but they won't want you, either.

478
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,884
You insult us all.

479
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,170
Let him go.

480
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,565
We need him more than you.

481
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,000
You will obey me,
and you will divorce her!

482
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,685
No, sir.

483
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,886
I will not.

484
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,249
Then listen to me, boy.

485
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,247
You will stand up
in the kgotla tomorrow...

486
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,847
...and you will renounce your birthright.

487
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,882
And any right to the throne.

488
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,249
We've misjudged this, haven't we?

489
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,368
(indistinct chatter)

490
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,524
(Tshekedi) Would the British
have accepted it

491
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,567
if Princess Elizabeth had come here,
and taken one of us

492
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,523
as her husband?

493
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,926
(Crowd murmurs in dissent)

494
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,850
A negro king of England.
Can you imagine?

495
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,322
She would have been refused!

496
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,408
Every right on her claim to the throne
removed from her!

497
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,851
Just as we must refuse my nephew here!

498
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,087
If he does not divorce this white woman!

499
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,407
Seretse... honour your people.

500
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,287
Do not belittle your kingdom!

501
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,844
(Exhales)

502
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,687
(Seretse) Over there in
the royal burial ground lies my father...

503
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,249
...his father and his father before him.

504
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,248
If I had married a woman
of my uncle's choosing,

505
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,200
he would, this day,
proudly be confirming me king,

506
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,243
and the line of royal succession,

507
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,725
centuries old,

508
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,922
would remain unbroken.

509
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,167
I am proud of my lineage,

510
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,681
and I respect my uncle.

511
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,362
But he does not have the right
to decide on my succession to the throne.

512
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,563
I believe the people, and only the people,

513
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,641
should have that right.

514
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,526
My commitment to you
has never diminished.

515
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,123
But I am told that you no longer
wish for me to honour my duty

516
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,890
to serve you as your king

517
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,571
because of the colour of the wife
I have chosen.

518
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,927
South Africa's racialist disease

519
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,927
has infected
all our neighbouring countries and us.

520
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,445
Look around you.

521
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,084
Our schools, hospitals, churches

522
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,807
all segregated in practice, if not in law.

523
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,730
Are we now to uphold the abomination
that is apartheid in our own kgotla?

524
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,164
The very same abomination that
has been oppressing us for decades?

525
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,129
Is this to be the future for our Africa?

526
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,642
We should not be
fighting for segregation.

527
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,445
We should be fighting for equality.

528
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,251
That is where we should be
focusing our minds,

529
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,684
not on the wife I have chosen,
who means you no harm,

530
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,724
whose only apparent crime

531
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,002
has been to fall in love with me!

532
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,846
And mine to fall in love with her.

533
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,163
(Signs)

534
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,170
I cannot serve you
without her by my side.

535
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,527
But I cannot force you to accept this.

536
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,407
Africa can never be free,

537
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,281
until all those who live in her,
white and black,

538
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,203
recognise that race must have
no bearing on equality and justice.

539
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,528
I am ready to serve you

540
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,120
because I love my people.

541
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,449
I love this land!

542
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,569
But I love my wife.

543
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,765
And I shall respect your will.

544
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,041
Those who want Seretse as king,

545
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,730
raise your hand.

546
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,810
<i>Pula! Pula!</i>

547
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,608
(All) <i>Pula, pula, pula!</i>

548
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,009
<i>Pula, pula, pula!</i>

549
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,162
<i>Pula, pula, pula, pula.</i>

550
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,004
(Shouting in the distance)

551
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,560
Ma, what are they shouting?

552
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,611
<i>Pula.</i>

553
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,685
It means "rain".

554
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,842
They're celebrating.

555
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,123
<i>Pula, pula, pula!</i>

556
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,287
Accept the vote
and conclude the meeting.

557
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,683
Uncle!

558
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,605
Uncle!

559
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,886
Uncle.

560
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,924
The British are not your allies.

561
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,688
I know exactly what I'm doing,
and why I'm doing it.

562
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,211
Do you, Seretse?

563
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,607
Do you think she is your ally?

564
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,611
Your grandfather had no option,
but to allow outsiders to rule us,

565
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,448
but you... you bring this one
to rule our tribe by choice.

566
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,046
What you are doing
is demeaning to your own people.

567
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,969
This has nothing to do with love!

568
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,603
So next time you look in the mirror,
ask yourself this:

569
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,209
were you not a king,
would she ever even looked at you?

570
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,204
Now she knows there's
no Buckingham Palace in Serowe,

571
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,722
how long before the village dust
gets in her eyes?

572
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,369
Now you will see how an empire
defends itself, Mr Khama.

573
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,325
(Signs)

574
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,284
(indistinct chatter)

575
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,362
(Seretse speaks Setswana)

576
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,282
(Shouting)

577
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,329
(Ruth) Where will he go?

578
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,368
He will start
a new settlement somewhere.

579
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,362
It's our way to avoid conflict.

580
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,607
We stay apart, but we stay at peace.

581
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,286
(Olivia Canning)
'Let me show you the blood lilies.'

582
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,449
- (Seretse) Something to discuss?
- Indeed.

583
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,841
Come. We shall leave the men to it.

584
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,965
My wife is capable of hearing what the
commissioner has to say, Mrs Lancaster.

585
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,125
As you wish.

586
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,161
Though what I have to say
she may not want to hear.

587
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,611
Oh, but I do.

588
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,365
There is going to be a delay

589
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,603
in our acknowledgment
of your position as tribal chief.

590
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,690
Your uncle is questioning your legitimacy.

591
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,849
There is nothing to be questioned
in the decision of the kgotla.

592
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,851
The approval of the kgotla
was for your position as chief,

593
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,564
not the suitability of your wife.

594
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,241
(Seretse) I made it quite clear that
a vote for me was also a vote for my wife.

595
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,362
They knew what they were voting for.

596
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,010
Did they?

597
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,726
Mr Khama, Sir Alistair Canning
wants to be fair about this.

598
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,926
It should reassure you to know
that he has appointed

599
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,687
the Chief Justice of the High Commission
Territory, Sir Walter Harragin,

600
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,370
to conduct an enquiry.

601
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,245
Into what? My wife?

602
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,603
An enquiry that will prove that
our marriage has riled South Africa?

603
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,603
South Africa is not the issue.

604
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,361
Sir Alistair looked me square in the eye
in London and said that it was.

605
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,883
Well, then you clearly misunderstood.

606
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,809
Seretse, do I look like a fool to you?

607
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,285
Not in the slightest.

608
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,446
Commissioner,
to keep up this false pretence

609
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,127
that this is not about Great Britain's
fears of South Africa's discontent

610
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,210
and what that might mean for you
and your government...

611
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,131
...is very distasteful.

612
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,371
Mr Khama, neither you or I are privy
to discussions of the British Cabinet.

613
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,408
But one thing you can be sure of

614
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,291
are the conversations
that I am having with your uncle.

615
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,007
And it is he who demanded this enquiry.

616
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,282
(Footsteps approach)

617
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,362
Hey. Ooh.

618
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,769
Did I ever tell you I didn't
just marry you for your good looks?

619
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,331
Liar.

620
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,442
(Both chuckle)

621
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,205
(Ruth exhales)

622
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,890
(In Setswana)

623
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,848
(Women murmur in dissent)

624
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,327
(Wails)

625
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,771
(Woman) Malaria.

626
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,370
(Seretse sighs)

627
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,762
(Chair creaks)

628
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,885
(Chuckles)

629
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,610
(In Setswana)

630
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,890
(Raucous chatter)

631
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,802
Six cattle died here ten days ago.

632
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,883
Then three white men came,
and started drilling with a machine.

633
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,449
We thought they had come here to
help us find water, but they ignored us.

634
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,571
(Engine stops)

635
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,085
(Muttering)

636
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,809
I need help with some shopping.
Can you come?

637
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,411
It's OK.

638
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,965
(In Setswana)

639
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,285
(They speak Setswana)

640
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,562
(Naledi)
Let's get you the things you need.

641
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,085
Um...

642
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,411
Cornflour.

643
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,844
Cornflour, <i>mma.</i>

644
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,331
(Seretse) I missed you.

645
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,601
Kwashiorkor, malnutrition, malaria.

646
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,206
The hospitals can't cope
with the demands.

647
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,610
So what can we do?

648
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,850
We depend on the reports the district
commissioner sends to London.

649
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,010
And they do nothing.
There's no money left after the war.

650
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,405
(Naledi) They never gave us money
before the war.

651
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,006
We pay the taxes they demand,
and we get nothing.

652
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,931
Mr Nash.

653
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,087
What is keeping you here so long?

654
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,607
- It's a beautiful country.
- (Chuckles)

655
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,763
I should be flattered,
but I don't believe you.

656
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,162
- The story?
- Oh, is that what I am? A story?

657
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,289
It's OK. I'm not offended.

658
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,164
I thought I'd catch the film.

659
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,931
Only whites allowed I hear.

660
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,082
And kings.

661
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,806
- Even black ones.
- Why do you come?

662
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,411
To something like this?

663
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,369
There's not a black face in sight
outside of the waiters and maids.

664
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,371
Defiance.

665
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,202
The knowledge that one day
things will change because they have to.

666
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,685
And it has to start somewhere.

667
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,410
Mrs Khama... how nice to see you again.

668
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,365
You too.

669
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,325
Thank you, my love.

670
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,166
I read something of yours
in "World Reporter".

671
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,725
An old copy.

672
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,601
About the Chinese civil war.
Was impressive.

673
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,446
Hmm, it's true,
I'm just a burnt-out war correspondent

674
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,329
trying to find another story.

675
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,882
Well, there's one, right there.

676
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,928
Drilling in the Naledi Valley.

677
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,131
Mineral testing.

678
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,283
What? Copper? Diamonds?

679
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,765
I don't know,

680
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,925
but I imagine it wouldn't be difficult
for someone like you to find out.

681
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,967
The valley stretches across
into South Africa.

682
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,607
It's been lucrative that side.
Now they've started exploring our side.

683
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,210
Without our permission.

684
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,849
But with the British Government's?

685
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,325
Presumably.

686
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,044
You know what a discovery
would mean to this country, to my people.

687
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,288
It would change everything.

688
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,243
But only if our interests are secured.

689
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,602
I can do that if I'm ahead of the game.

690
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,880
And if I have enough information.

691
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,205
Enjoy the film.

692
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,842
(Film blasts)

693
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,602
I have some rather good news for you.

694
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,170
A word after the film.

695
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,929
Mr Khama, don't you want
to hear the good news?

696
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,769
We have tickets for you.

697
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,045
Tickets?

698
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,131
For what?

699
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,689
The government want to rectify the matter
of your chieftainship face to face.

700
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,606
In London.

701
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,809
Dealing with such matters long distance,
it slows the process down,

702
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,605
which isn't good for you,
and your people.

703
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,763
So we thought a month would suffice.

704
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,291
Oh.

705
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,562
It would give you, Mrs Khama,
an opportunity

706
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,603
to see your friends, see your family.

707
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,965
You shouldn't come.

708
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,726
They want me here and you in London.

709
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,002
That is why you must be here,
and me in London.

710
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,563
I have to go back to resolve this.
We don't have a choice in that.

711
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,604
But if you come with me,
they won't allow you back.

712
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,843
Why else would they purchase you
a trip to visit your family?

713
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,726
You can't just go.
Why would I be here by myself?

714
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,360
Seretse, I gave up everything
to be with you, but I can't do this alone.

715
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,167
I promise as long as I live
you will never be alone.

716
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,249
But if you leave with me...

717
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,006
...then I can never return because
they will force you to stay in England,

718
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,730
and I will not return without you.

719
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,205
What the devil is this?

720
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,604
My people have decided
that my wife should stay.

721
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,441
Tell your people to remove themselves
from this gate immediately.

722
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,444
(Seretse) Unfortunately,
in the absence of your decision

723
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,329
on my appointment as the king,

724
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,761
I don't have any power over them.

725
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,242
Mrs Khama, I strongly urge you
to reconsider and come with us.

726
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,884
My husband has told you. He's...

727
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,249
It's not within his power
to order these people to do anything,

728
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,725
and as a woman...

729
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,250
...well, I have no say
in the matter whatsoever.

730
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,722
So, alas, I'm powerless to help you.

731
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,170
(scoffs)

732
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,285
- (Whispers) That was very good.
- Thank you.

733
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,890
I'm ready, Commissioner.

734
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,048
(Crowd mutters)

735
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:43,563
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

736
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,611
(Canning) Enter.

737
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,442
Ah, Mr Khama. Good afternoon.

738
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,888
I'm grateful to you for returning
to London. Do please take a seat.

739
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,450
I'm intrigued to know
why you've brought me all this way.

740
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,250
The government summoned me
here last week

741
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,442
upon receipt of the Harragin report.

742
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,525
They have reviewed it and considered
the conflict between you and your uncle.

743
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,848
And after taking all things into account,

744
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,769
we have concluded

745
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,969
that you should be exiled
from Bechuanaland

746
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,764
for a period of five years.

747
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,561
Call it a period of reflection.

748
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,287
After five years, we will, of course,
review the situation.

749
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,727
But in the meantime,

750
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,970
we are able to offer you a position
in the administration of Jamaica.

751
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,403
And we will, of course, make sure
we accommodate your dear wife.

752
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,248
Jamaica is not my country.

753
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,283
There are some similarities.

754
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,604
I belong with my people.

755
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,410
We will be imposing direct rule,

756
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,610
with the district commissioner, Rufus
Lancaster, acting as native authority.

757
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,326
There will, of course,
be a tribal council,

758
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,561
so your people will have
some sort of say

759
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,243
in our running of your affairs.

760
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,567
I do understand
this is an awful lot to digest.

761
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,330
I want to see the Harragin report.

762
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,204
Not possible.

763
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,682
It was an advisory paper, so
the government's not obliged to publish,

764
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,087
but I can tell you this:

765
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,407
the conclusion was

766
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:38,441
you are not
a fit and proper person to rule.

767
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,204
Upon what basis?

768
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,163
That's confidential to the government.

769
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,442
I have a right to know.

770
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,728
Sir Walter has weighed the evidence.

771
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,405
And you chose to agree.

772
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:55,691
Mr Khama, I am the British Government's
representative in your country...

773
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,882
And yet you know nothing of it.

774
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,289
You don't even live there.
You are based somewhere else entirely.

775
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,609
Content with your government
to run our affairs from South Africa,

776
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,963
you move as closely with
Prime Minister Malan and his government,

777
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,447
as you do the British prime minster.

778
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:16,128
And, yes, Sir Alistair,
I am questioning your motives.

779
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,449
I do not make the decisions.

780
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,331
You advise.

781
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,603
And my advice... is always confidential.

782
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,367
It's six o'clock, Sir Alistair.
Might I suggest a glass of sherry?

783
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,525
Splendid idea.

784
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,807
The government
will release this white paper.

785
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,446
It explains the situation
and your succession.

786
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,841
It sets out in fairly plain English

787
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,045
that were it not for our intervention,
Bechuanaland would have been torn apart

788
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,407
by the rivalry
between you and your uncle.

789
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,050
That is an utter fabrication!

790
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,443
We are merely documenting
what your uncle has told us.

791
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,010
Oh, gosh. Thanks very much.

792
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,125
Sherry, Mr Khama?

793
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,803
(Engine stops)

794
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,569
(indistinct chatter)

795
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,684
(Groans)

796
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,685
Hello, Ruth.

797
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,565
You're in hospital in Serowe.

798
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,731
You have diphtheria,
but it is being treated.

799
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,011
And, Ms Khama, the doctor here
has discovered you are with child.

800
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,449
- But...
- My husband and I are concerned

801
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,444
that you should now get
the very best treatment available.

802
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,127
So he is organising for you to go to
Cape Town and visit a gynaecologist.

803
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,969
Dr Wessels.

804
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,329
Oh, Ruth, you are awake.

805
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,571
(Mrs Canning) This chap I'm talking
about is the top man in Africa.

806
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,810
It wouldn't be right
not to put my faith in the doctors here.

807
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,563
Without wanting to alarm you,

808
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,890
death rates in childbirth,
for both mother and baby, in Serowe

809
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,889
are dangerously high.

810
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,764
To stay here would be a serious risk.

811
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,724
We do urge you to go to Cape Town.

812
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,121
Well, perhaps Dr Wessels
could come here.

813
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,891
Dr Wessels does not travel
to his patients.

814
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,611
Look, I know what you're doing.

815
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,961
- And I don't like it.
- Mrs Khama...

816
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,561
I will ask you now both,
will you please leave?

817
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,286
Whatever your opinion of my husband,

818
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,410
I am here only as a woman,
who is also a mother.

819
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,729
I'm thinking only of the survival
of yourself and that of your baby.

820
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,127
You must give yourself
the very best chance.

821
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,766
(Mrs Canning)
We know Africa, and you do not.

822
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,764
I appreciate your thoughtfulness,
but I want to decide.

823
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,121
- Mrs Khama, Ruth...
- That's enough!

824
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,889
Please... do as my sister asks.

825
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,440
How dare you, girl.

826
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,762
Who on earth do you think
you're addressing?

827
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,928
And who do you think
<i>you're</i> addressing?

828
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,522
I am Naledi Khama,
from the royal family of the Bangwato.

829
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,363
Granddaughter of Khama the Great,

830
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:16,570
and sister to the present king,
who will never be dethroned.

831
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,602
(indistinct chatter)

832
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,044
(Phone rings)

833
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,806
Hello?

834
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,365
(Line crackles)

835
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,091
- My love?
- 'It's Ruth. Can you hear me?'

836
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,565
My love, I can hear you.

837
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,923
Best news in the world, I am pregnant.

838
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,810
- 'We are having a baby.'
- A baby.

839
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,606
'I've been to the hospital and
Dr Moikangao says everything's good.

840
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,165
'How about that?'

841
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,288
It's wo... it's wonderful news.

842
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,769
'I cannot wait for you to come home.'

843
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,691
When are you coming back?

844
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,244
Ruth, something's...
something has happened.

845
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,523
Uh... I-I had my meeting with Canning.

846
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,765
I have been banished.

847
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:31,564
'The Harragin report stated
that I am not fit to rule.

848
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,531
I-I cannot come back for five years.

849
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,531
This can't be happening.

850
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,129
They are determined that we will
not be together in Bechuanaland.

851
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,725
And if I return, they'll have
no reason to allow you back.

'We were never supposed to be apart!
You promised me!

that everything would be all right!'

854

(sighs) I know.

855
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,011
I know. I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry.

(Sobs)

857
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,007
Then find your way back to me, Seretse.

858
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,003
'Find your way back.'

859
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,801
- (Sniffles)
- 'I promise you I will.'

860

863

Ruth! Ruth!

01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,210
...and my wife.

875
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,931
(Knock at door)

876
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,404
Mr Khama... Anthony Benn.

877
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,885
(Seretse) You got my letter.

878
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,891
Seretse, uh, Mr Benn is a friend of Joe's.

879
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,370
We want to help.

880
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,602
Fenner Brockway. May we?

881
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,729
Uh, yes. Please.

882
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,609
It's subterfuge. Propaganda.

883
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,888
It's completely unprincipled.

884
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,890
We are talking about an entire nation
who want their leader.

885
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,561
While your government are concealing
their reasons for keeping me here,

886
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:49,002
they are allowing our lands
to be explored for minerals.

887
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,607
- For diamonds.
- And you believe the two are connected.

888
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,969
I don't know, but what happens
if they make a find?

889
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,322
Mr Khama, you are a protectorate,

890
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,205
which differentiates you somewhat
from other colonies.

891
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,802
Meaning the mineral rights should be
vested with the people of my country.

892
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:11,403
Ordinarily, yes, but you have been
placed under direct rule.

893
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,847
Your situation may have
become vulnerable.

894
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,931
My grandfather negotiated those rights.
I know they remain with us.

895
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,361
You are vulnerable.

896
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,045
(Signs)

897
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,171
What if the government acknowledged
our rights publicly in some way?

898
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,691
Or if I could get them on record

899
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,087
recognising the agreement
they have with us?

900
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,449
Well, that would be a great help,
and a miracle.

901
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,167
I will look into the legalities
of your country's change in status.

902
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,931
And the Harragin report?

903
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,963
We'll get a copy.

904
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,565
You have my word.

905
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,771
(Brockway)
Seretse, please hold your people off.

906
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,810
If the election brings new blood,
it could change everything.

907
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,528
How long can we rely on the good nature
of our people to stand by peacefully?

908
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,851
Tomorrow, Sir Alistair Canning
will announce to my people

909
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,282
the appointment of one of his
administration as the new native authority

910
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,765
to govern my people.

911
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,007
Every district was alerted, sir.

912
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,001
We were expecting 10,000
at this meeting.

913
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,522
(Applause)

914
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,042
The tribe is refusing
to organise a council.

915
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,929
Until their king... is returned.

916
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,803
(Seretse) When a man tells a lie,

917
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,523
he loses his dignity.

918
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,609
And so it is with a country.

919
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,921
I'm calling
on the British Government today

920
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,731
to release the Harragin report.

921
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,524
What are they hiding?

922
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,250
(Blows)

923
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,922
(indistinct wireless)

924
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,570
(Wireless) '...they did so
with only the slightest of...

925
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:01,442
'In a bid to show his support
for the exiled chief of Bechuanaland...'

926
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,802
'The leader of the opposition,
Mr Churchill, addressed Parliament.

927
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,086
'Mr Churchill told the House
of his deeply held belief

928
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,329
'in the virtue of the Christian marriage,
which he described

929
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:16,240
'as a "scared bond
between a husband and his wife".

930
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,843
'Why are the Labour government keeping
this African chief and his woman apart?

'Putting his opposition
to Khama's banishment on the record,

The honourable gentleman

936
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,128
We know these actions
against Mr Khama

937
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:50,246
are effectively introducing the principle
of a colour bar to British politics,

938
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,601
separating black from white.

939
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,563
(Shouting in dissent)

940
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,245
It is an utter betrayal,

941
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,409
both of myself, as your prime minister,
and of your government.

942
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,364
The betrayal is of the British people,

943
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,241
and anyone who believed the Labour Party
is on the side of what is right and just.

944
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,964
(Benn) The world is watching.

945
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,522
The UN have a petition signed by
every prominent black leader in the US.

946
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,406
America is sending funds to Mr Khama,

947
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,166
so that he can defend himself against us.

948
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,765
It's... I mean, look at these.

949
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,407
Never has a Labour government been
criticised this way by the negro press.

950
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,604
We are on the eve of the election.
I am pleading with you.

951
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,922
Send him home before Churchill does.

952
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,010
It will be an almighty humiliation
if a Tory government

953
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,446
fulfils our responsibility!

954
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,446
I would like nothing more than to say to
hell with Malan and his damned apartheid,

955
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,446
but we need South Africa to protect us
from Stalin and his advance there.

956
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,602
We all do! Including the...

957
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,002
...hypocritical Americans with
their Jim Crow laws lauding this over us!

958
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:53,768
- They're pointing out the facts.
- These are the facts! There's a Cold War.

959
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,043
If I allow that chief,
or any black chief and his white queen,

960
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,804
to sleep in the same bed
on African soil,

961
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,440
Malan will withdraw
from the Commonwealth.

962
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,887
He will utilise any favour
we show that couple

963
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,731
to whip up nationalist support
for a separate republic.

964
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,162
- He'll withdraw his uranium...
- This is how we justify our actions?

965
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,328
- An atomic bomb programme?
- And his gold!

966
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,330
If you don't care about the uranium,
think about our economy.

967
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,442
How long can we sustain our currency

968
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,443
without Malan supplying
our gold reserves?

969
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,444
Hmm? You count the months!

970
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,607
We have done a deal with the devil.

971

(Radio) 'Twenty-four hours have passed

Mr Khama. Good morning.

988
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,171
Morning.

989
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,043
Sir Winston Churchill will be
making his announcement

990
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,761
about your return to Bechuanaland
in the House of Commons this afternoon.

991
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,882
He wished for me
to convey it to you first.

992
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,404
I appreciate that.

993
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,767
He's decided that five years' banishment

994
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,089
will cause unrest and uncertainty
in the protectorate,

995
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,010
and he wishes to bring an end
to such insecurity.

996
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,607
Consequently, he will be announcing
that your banishment...

997
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,365
...is for life.

998
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,966
I beg your pardon?

999
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,401
Yes, on the occasion of our previous
meeting I was able to offer you a career

1000
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,528
in the administration of Jamaica.

1001
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,208
Pity you did not accept. Under current
circumstances, I cannot repeat the offer.

1002
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,766
Nor, indeed, a posting to any other land.

1003
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,281
(Signs)

1004
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,769
The prime minister
announced his intentions.

1005
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:40,968
He clearly stated that
he would allow me back home.

1006
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,607
Opposition is one thing, Mr Khama.

1007
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:51,366
The realities of government
are quite another. Good day.

1008
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,891
(Door opens)

1009
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,849
I want him to come back to me.

1010
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,403
Churchill promised. He promised.

1011
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,570
I believed him.

1012
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,085
Seretse says he'll write to Tshekedi,
and try and reconcile, but...

1013
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,409
You have to be strong.

1014
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,522
You have a voice. Use it.

1015
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,322
Mr Churchill,
10,000 of my husband's people

1016
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,286
fought the war for you,
and for the freedom of Britain.

1017
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,768
They answered your call
in your darkest hour.

1018

'Mr Churchill,
you have betrayed my husband,

1043
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,800
The decision of my government
is absolute and final.

1044
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,962
(Shouting in dissent)

1045
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,845
Control them, or I'll close the kgotla.

1046
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,691
Sir, you have pushed
the patience of the people too far.

1047
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,763
You can't close our kgotla

1048
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,327
any more than I can close
your Houses of Parliament.

1049
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,608
(Shouting)

1050
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,965
(Gasps)

1051
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,562
(Shouting continues)

1052
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,731
Hey!

1053
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,771
Hey!

1054
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,365

1071

(Phone rings)

1072
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,725
Hello?

1073
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,208
Here is your daughter.

1074
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,131
Can you hear her?

1075
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,724
No.

1076
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,050
- 'Hang on. Can you hear her?'
- (Baby cries)

1077
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,049
I-I can. I can hear her.

1078
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,689
But... she sounds... I-Is she all right?

1079
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,129
'She's beautiful.'

1080
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,605
But she's crying.

1081
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,007
Oh, I jabbed her, so she'd make a noise.

1082
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,250
Isn't she beautiful?

1083
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,564
She's, she's beautiful.

1084
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,244
(Ruth) I wish you could see her.

1085
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,044
You must come to me.

1086
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,050
'Are we giving up?'

1087
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,883
No. No, we are not.

1088
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,688
'But we've been separated for too long.'

1089
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,768
I can't do this alone any more.

1090
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,883
And I need you.

1091
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,602
- 'I need my family.'
- (Baby cries)

1092
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,730
'As soon as the baby's strong enough,
we'll come to you.'

1093
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,568
(Ruth) My tickets have arrived.

1094
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,569
Would it be all right if I joined you?

1095
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,889
See, I don't know when I'll be back.

1096
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,085

(Ruth) It's OK. Mmm.

1099
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,131
There.

(Singing in Setswana)

1102
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,371
Why are they here?

1103
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,606
They are thanking you
for walking the road with them.

1104
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,804
This song is about you.

1105
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,329
They are saying Seretse's wife
is as bright as the morning star.

1106

There's someone else here to see you.

1113

Thank you for coming.

(Reporters clamouring)

1115
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,609
- Hello, Daddy.
- Ruth.

1116
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:21,971
This is Jacqueline.

1117

The story on the mining companies.
I thought you'd like to know.

1124
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,245
We need a bit more information,

1125
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,931
but I'll say we'll be running with this
in about a week.

It's not confirmed, it's too soon, but...

1131
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,210
...there has been a find.

1132
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,640
Diamonds?

1133
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,209
Yes.

1134
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,442
Just three diamonds, but...

1135
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:02,964
But yes.

1136
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,764
It's a beginning.

1137
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,125
It could mean everything.

1138
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,527
The British don't know about the find yet.

1139
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,608
If I can get ahead...

1140
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,604
...I know, I know I can get this right.

1141
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,920
The prime minister told this country

1142
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,811
that he would allow
the King of Bangwato to return home.

1143
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,606
After the election,
he banished him for life.

1144
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,245
For good.

1145
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,528
Having deprived
the Bangwato people of their king,

1146
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,247
can his Commonwealth
under-secretary, at the very least,

1147
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:42,445
assure us that the Bangwato people
will still have a say

1148
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,887
in the running of their own affairs?

1149
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,609
With particular reference to the use
of their land for mineral exploitation?

1150
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:54,367
(Under-secretary)
Let me make it clear that the dispute

1151
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,291
is not between us and the Bangwato,

1152
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,607
it is between the chief and his uncle.

1153
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,361
We have a responsibility
to keep this warring family apart.

1154
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,806
(Murmuring in assent)

1155
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,361
With respect
to the Right Honourable Gentleman,

1156
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,081
his answer had nothing to do
with the question I just asked.

1157
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,767
Mr Chairman, the Honourable Gentleman
seems to be hounding me for an answer

1158
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,362
- that I'm quite prepared to give.
- (Chairman) Yes? Go on.

1159
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,769
Let me make an assurance

1160
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,929
that no leases will be given
to any mining companies,

1161
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,642
without the consent
of the Bangwato themselves.

1162
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,609
(Murmuring in assent)

1163
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,890
(Birds squawking)

1164
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,889
(Benn) The report.

1165
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,765
How did you get it?

1166
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,845
Let's say not everyone is proud of what
their government does on their behalf.

1167
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,970
Harragin concludes
that you are a fit and proper person

1168
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,003
to succeed to the kingdom.

1169
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,445
And that you, Ruth,

1170
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,841
are acceptable to the Bangwato people.

1171
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,647
But that neither of you
are acceptable to South Africa.

1172
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,371
It's your proof.

1173
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:26,281
(Seretse) Because my exile
is now permanent,

1174
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:30,849
I need to put our family affairs in order.

1175
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,162
As a consequence, I would like

1176
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:37,045
to arrange a meeting with my uncle

1177
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,288
in Bechuanaland,

1178
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:43,121
and so I'm requesting permission
to travel.

1179
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,645
Well, Mr Khama,
I have looked at your request.

1180
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,451
And as a gesture of goodwill,

1181
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,207
and to ensure that all can see
the sincerity of our efforts

1182
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:03,882
to keep peace within your tribe...
I will allow it.

1183
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,567
But only for a period of one week.

1184
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,004
By which point we expect you
to have dealt with whatever...

1185
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:19,441
...family concerns
you may need to address.

1186
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,971
Thank you.

1187
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,447
How kind of you, Mr Roberts.

1188
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,887
I hope you know how appreciative we are.

1189
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,211
(Car door closes)

1190
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,971
(Seretse speaks Setswana)

1191
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,001
We have a very difficult negotiation.

1192
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,004
Yes, Uncle.

1193
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,605
(Speaks Setswana)

1194
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,451
(Speaks Setswana)

1195
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,162
This is Jacqueline.

1196
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,171
She is a sweet one.

1197
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,844
I was going to put her down, but I...

1198
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,731
I think she'd rather be
in another mother's arms.

1199
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,649
Yes, she's a sweet one.

1200
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,725
I have read your letter.

1201
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,647
And what are your thoughts, Uncle?

1202
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,246
If we can agree now
to let go of our claims to the kingship,

1203
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,840
we will be equal private citizens.

1204
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,005
Then my marriage can be of no concern
to South Africa, Great Britain or anyone.

1205
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:23,448
Any disagreement between you and me
becomes a domestic squabble,

1206
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,284
not an affair of state.

1207
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,209
Then I will be allowed to return home.

1208
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,729
And we can start to rebuild.

1209
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,251
(Tshekedi sighs)

1210
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:39,207
You're speaking of dismantling hundreds
and hundreds of years of tradition.

1211
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,882
Uncle... you should read this.

1212
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,648
You, me, our people...

1213
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,241
...we have been pawns
in somebody else's game.

1214
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,371
They are coming.

1215
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,167
You may have convinced me, Seretse...

1216
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,931
...but now you're going
to have to convince the people.

1217
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,806
(Canning) I believe
that two days ago, Mr Khama,

1218
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,604
you had a meeting with your uncle,

1219
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,003
authorised by Mr Roberts
in the Commonwealth Office.

1220
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:48,926
Mr Roberts will not be available
in the future to make such decisions.

1221
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:53,329
I also know you want to discuss
the outcome of that meeting with me

1222
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,920
for relay to the British Government.

1223
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,724
Before you begin, let me be clear.

1224
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:04,449
There can and will be no circumstance

1225
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,002
in which we will allow you
to return to Bechuanaland permanently.

1226
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,608
No... circumstance?

1227
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,170
Not even a hand-delivered copy
of the Harragin report to the press?

1228
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:25,960
"Government lies to British public
for fear of South Africa in Khama affair."

1229
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,969
There would be conditions.

1230
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:37,765
I would have to discuss them
with the government.

1231
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,047
You should know this, Mr Khama...

1232
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:47,331
I would personally demand that you
give up all claim to the chieftainship,

1233
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,602
and that your uncle do the same.

1234
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,331
Sir Alistair,

1235
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,287
I don't have to do anything anymore.

1236
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,360
But... I will agree to that.

1237
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:06,242
And... upon condition that
we continue direct rule from London.

1238
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,045
I will agree to this, also.

1239
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:15,001
Up to the point
where we will hold democratic elections,

1240
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,168
and declare our independence.

1241
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,607
Yes, well, an election process
is hardly on the agenda.

1242
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,609
I suspect your government

1243
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:32,765
may take a slightly more
respectful position moving forward.

1244
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:38,643
You will be aware of the recent
discovery of diamonds on our lands?

1245
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:42,525
Yes, well...

1246
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,525
Any resources
Bechuanaland may have are...

1247
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,401
...hardly relevant
to this issue, Mr Khama.

1248
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:57,207
I hope you caught the news that
your Commonwealth under-secretary

1249
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,771
confirmed to Parliament that my people

1250
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,805
control all mineral resources
in Bechuanaland.

1251
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,766
You need my husband, Sir Alistair.

1252
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:18,886
May I offer you a sherry?

1253
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,402
(cheering)

1254
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,808
(Laughs)

1255
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,123
(Horn honks)

1256
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,049
(Seretse chuckles)

1257
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,362
(cheering)

1258
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,771
(Speaks Setswana)

1259
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,042
My uncle and I

1260
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,645
are now at peace.

1261
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,841
The exile is over!

1262
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,962
(cheering)

1263
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,646
I have a new vision for our nation.

1264
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,922
We are a people of tradition,
and rightly so.

1265
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,371
(Murmuring in assent)

1266
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,966
But we need a change in Africa.

1267
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:46,400
We need a change in Bechuanaland,
whether we like it or not.

1268
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,610
Whether the colonial powers that be
like it or not.

1269
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,329
It is time for us to take a step
beyond royal succession,

1270
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,841
and into a democratic Bechuanaland.

1271
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,201
(cheering)

1272
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,129
To create a new nation,

1273
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:07,881
not to be ruled by royalty here,
or royalty in great Britain,

1274
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:13,964
but a country to be led
by those who you choose.

1275
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,409
No man is free...

1276
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,009
...who is not master of himself.

1277
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,250
(cheering)

1278
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,643
Brother and sisters,
it is time for democracy,

1279
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,890
for independence,

1280
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,609
for us to be the masters of our own fate.

1281
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,010
A new Bechuanaland.

1282
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,049
A new Africa.

1283
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,765
It is time!

1284
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,882
(cheering)

1285
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:04,602
<i>Pula, pula, pula, pula...</i>

1286
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,091
Ruth!

1287
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,202
(Cheering)

1288
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:42,323
