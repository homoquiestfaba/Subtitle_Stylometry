1
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:19,626
Hey.

2
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,535
Can I ask you a question?

3
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:27,276
Okay.

4
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:32,679
You know that
the distance between here and here

5
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,777
is the same distance
between here and here.

6
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,146
No I didn't know that.

7
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,120
Well now you know.

8
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:43,360
It's very smooth.

9
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:49,728
Who is that?

10
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,170
I don't know.

11
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,180
Ahhh.

12
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:19,596
No!

13
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:21,664
Ahhh!

14
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:24,497
Stop.

15
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:26,127
Hey!

16
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:38,511
Shh. It's gonna be okay.

17
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:04,524
Stay back here,

18
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,638
we'll tell you as soon as
we know something.

19
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:07,830
Guys,

20
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:10,066
please.

21
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:31,351
The assailant parked his car

22
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:34,693
approximately twelve feet behind
this car on the passenger side.

23
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,666
He then walked around to the driver's
side and fired several shots.

24
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:40,067
Girl got out her door
and started running.

25
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:41,934
Boy tried to go out the same way.

26
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,571
The assailant walked around the front
of the car, came around,

27
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,803
shot the head
in the head at point blank range.

28
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,775
He then turned,
fired six shots at the girl.

29
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,281
Five shots hit her in the back
in a tight cluster.

30
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:55,482
Only five? What happened to the sixth?

31
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,712
Or the first?

32
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,049
What?

33
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,452
Or the first.

34
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:02,685
The first?

35
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:06,026
Nobody could have hit her like that
if she was running.

36
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,225
There was probably a warning shot
to keep her from running away.

37
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:16,766
To bulls-eye five shots
in total darkness at that distance.

38
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:20,678
He was a lucky man
or he was a trained marksman.

39
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:25,041
You guys know how important
it is to catch this guy?

40
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:26,810
And catch him fast?

41
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:29,985
There hasn't been a killing like this
in this area in years.

42
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:33,888
Those vultures are gonna be all over
us until we put somebody in jail.

43
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,693
This is it son.

44
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,533
I'm putting this whole mess
in your hands.

45
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,595
Clean it up. Okay?

46
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,104
Yes sir.

47
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,244
Hey.

48
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,182
-Hi dad.
-You're not supposed to be here.

49
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:05,955
I know. I just wanted to...

50
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,683
Get up. Come on. Let's go.

51
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:10,552
Let's go.

52
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:13,890
What happened?

53
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,232
Do you know who did it?

54
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:21,072
Not yet.

55
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:24,868
Hey inspector. So who did this?
You have any suspects yet?

56
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,841
As you heard Chief Perkins say
earlier this morning,

57
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,445
we are pursuing several leads.

58
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,774
Will you excuse us please?

59
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,548
But inspector, you can't expect
the people of this city to...

60
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,514
Mr. Coverling, exucse us.

61
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:40,221
-Hi Mr. Perry.
-Hi Bobbie.

62
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,454
It's christmas vacation.
You should be asleep still.

63
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:44,425
Yes sir.

64
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:45,495
Go.

65
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,257
You alright?

66
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:53,928
Are you alright?

67
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:55,232
Yes.

68
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,703
Get going. Follow her home.

69
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:02,638
Don't say a word to your mother.
You were not here.

70
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:19,789
IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME
OF THE YEAR...

71
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:24,896
Hello?

72
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:27,630
Oh hey Jenna I was going to call you.
I wanted to see.

73
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,300
No why?

74
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:32,603
No, not since.

75
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:37,237
Oh my god.

76
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,778
No that's awful I...

77
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,543
This was last night?

78
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,889
Okay, bye.

79
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:13,973
Ahh, oh my god.

80
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:15,617
Are you okay?

81
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,254
You scared me.

82
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:41,703
Johnny in bed?

83
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,466
I heard you're in charge, Detective.

84
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,515
Big news travels fast in a small town.

85
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,247
You're dinner is in the oven.

86
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:16,537
So, does this mean we're going to have
to start locking the door?

87
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:19,574
Sure.

88
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:04,918
Coffee?

89
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:11,222
No? Alright then.

90
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:27,206
I know this isn't easy for you
and Mrs. Boucher.

91
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:31,145
I assure you, I wouldn't be asking these
questions if I didn't they could help.

92
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:35,213
Help? Do you have kids officer?

93
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:36,547
Yes, Ma'am.

94
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:39,983
How old?

95
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:42,791
I have a son and he's twelve.

96
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,621
She was so young.

97
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,906
Mrs. Boucher, help me. Help me help you.

98
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:03,039
What about the necklace
and the earrings?

99
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:06,047
Did your daughter wear this sort
of expensive jewelry all the time?

100
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:08,084
It was her first date.

101
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:12,451
She was so excited.

102
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:18,885
Have you ever been
to Lake Helena road... at night?

103
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:20,953
No.

104
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,601
Why? Have you?

105
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:25,995
Uh uh.

106
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:35,672
And that's all of them?

107
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,406
Yep, that's the last one I found.

108
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,011
They came in just to the left
of her vertebrae

109
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,550
but there's not exit wounds.

110
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:45,213
Probably just ricochetted inside.

111
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:51,555
As far as I can tell,
he never touched her.

112
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,227
Before or after.

113
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:03,166
Or the boy for that matter.

114
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:38,963
Look at that,

115
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,531
almost done Johnny.

116
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,235
It's loking good.

117
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:47,675
-Honey?
-Yeah?

118
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:49,812
-Have you seen this?
-What?

119
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,915
This. It's that.

120
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,983
It's everywhere I go.

121
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,622
It's at the market, the post office,
it's all anybody talks about.

122
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,751
People are asking me if I know anything.

123
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:15,195
People are scared Matt.
They are more scared than you know.

124
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:20,975
Things like this just don't happen
around here. Okay?

125
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,580
You think this guy came
in from the city.

126
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:25,876
I was reading in the paper that
they saw a car get...

127
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:29,783
I don't want to get into it Laura.
Jesus Christ. Please?

128
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:32,214
It's just that Lake Helena...

129
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:33,449
Drop it!

130
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:39,356
This is my problem, okay?

131
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,700
It isn't just your problem.

132
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:53,674
I'm sorry.

133
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:55,776
I'm sorry.

134
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,039
You alright?

135
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:05,807
Bye Johnny.

136
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:10,843
No that's what I'm telling you.

137
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:13,252
I'm at the station now
and they won't talk.

138
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:15,156
Yeah. No.

139
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,891
No I don't care what Perkins says.

140
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,929
It's not a robbery.
The fact is, they don't know shit.

141
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,532
They don't know anything more this week
than they did last week,

142
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:23,895
or the week before that.

143
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:25,627
Or the week before that.

144
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:28,062
They're not talking because
they don't know anything.

145
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:08,501
You know,

146
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,208
we use to play bridge
with the Boucher's.

147
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:16,714
Poor Diane is gonna be crying
her way all the way to Easter,

148
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:18,485
for god's sake.

149
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,689
Hey, you've got a family
so you understand the concern here.

150
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:30,767
Okay, tell me what we've got right now.
Tell me straight.

151
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,334
The truth is sir, not a lot.

152
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:36,329
No weapons, no witnesses,
no prints, no motive.

153
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,499
All you're telling me
is what we don't have.

154
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:42,238
All right. He must have some kind
of light attached to his weapon...

155
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:45,304
so he can aim it at her hand free
for target fire.

156
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:50,349
He's good with weapons,
there's no doubt about it.

157
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,087
He's driving along the outskirts of town

158
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:56,625
armed with a customized 22 Caliber
loaded with long rifle slugs.

159
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:58,626
Yeah for raccoon hunting.

160
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,806
He comes across a couple
in a dark remote spot

161
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,568
and attacks with hesitation.

162
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,572
The large number of rounds fired

163
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:17,442
and the patterns on the victims bodies
indicate he attacked

164
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:19,072
with intention of killing those kids.

165
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:23,483
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on there son.
See, I can see where you're going.

166
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,680
Between you and me, it's great,
it's fine

167
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:28,485
but our official take on this is that

168
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:31,151
it's a botched robbery and nothing else,

169
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:33,354
until we have clear evidence
to the contrary.

170
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:35,021
If it was robbery sir,
why didn't he rob them?

171
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,394
Is that what you want in the headlines?

172
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,695
I have not seen any evidence
on either side.

173
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:42,067
Sir, the killer did not take
the boy's wallet

174
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:46,768
and did not take the girl's earrings.
It wasn't robbery.

175
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:54,677
That is why
I want you to catch this guy.

176
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,347
Yes, sir.

177
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,535
Now's not a good time, kiddo.

178
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:21,775
-Well, can I just stay?
-Not today.

179
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,115
Not today.

180
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,550
Johnny, come here.

181
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:42,830
I'm sorry.

182
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:48,401
Oh, oh man I've got a lot of work to do.

183
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:50,604
It's all right, I'll just go.

184
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:54,174
Johnny.

185
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:59,410
Johnny. I'm gonna catch this guy.

186
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:04,281
I'm gonna get him, okay? I promise you.

187
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:04,013
This, Inspector Parish,
is your first day off in months.

188
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:06,307
You're supposed to be having fun.

189
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:34,676
Mom? Can I go?

190
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:36,143
Yeah, you be home by nine though.

191
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,544
-Alright, eleven, thanks.
-Come here, give me a kiss.

192
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:41,175
Ten, okay?
You be home by ten.

193
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:43,183
Alright. Love you, bye.

194
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:45,182
Be safe.

195
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:51,089
It's gonna be fine.

196
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:53,855
I know.

197
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:58,426
I'll be back in a minute.

198
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,580
Johnny, come on.

199
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:22,443
You get comfortable?

200
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,547
Yes.

201
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:41,588
So... Why'd you bring me here?

202
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:47,604
Well, I thought maybe we could talk.

203
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:54,538
Shit!

204
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:03,850
Do you know him?

205
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:08,784
I think it's the cops.

206
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:36,467
Hello? Police Department.

207
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,097
I want to report a double murder.

208
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,506
If you'll go one mile east
of Erikson Parkway to the public park,

209
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:42,908
you'll find kids in a red car.

210
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:46,374
They were shot
with a 9 millimeter Luger.

211
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:50,317
I also killed those kids last year.
Goodbye.

212
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:22,179
Call CHP, tell them we need help
with a road block, right now.

213
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,186
Did you see him? Do you know him?

214
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:28,549
Did you get a look at him?

215
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:30,557
What did his hair look like,
his clothes?

216
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:35,097
Short hair, brown I think. Dark clothes.

217
00:30:35,732 --> 00:30:38,360
What about his car, did you see his car?

218
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:40,060
I think it was a Corvair.

219
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:42,171
We've gotta move.

220
00:30:42,406 --> 00:30:43,464
I never saw it before.

221
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:47,509
You're gonna be okay.
Logan, I need you to ride with him.

222
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:50,807
If he remembers anything,
if he has any information,

223
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:53,542
any vital information,
contact me immediately.

224
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:58,784
You're gonna be okay. Try to remember.

225
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:03,756
Fucker called the station.

226
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:04,519
When?

227
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:07,186
Couple minutes ago, Price took the call.

228
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:19,875
Gary, it's Dale.

229
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,136
You ready to finally give me
an assignment?

230
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:25,676
No, bigger than that.

231
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:28,447
There's a god damned psychopath
on the loose in Vallejo.

232
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:31,418
He shot two more kids. Uh-huh.

233
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:34,956
No, we missed the morning edition.
It'll be in the afternoon's.

234
00:31:36,693 --> 00:31:37,785
You want the story first?

235
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:40,419
You've gotta let me do it...
on the morning show.

236
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:42,532
That's right.

237
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:44,859
Yep.

238
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:48,368
Yeah, I'll be there. Alright.

239
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:55,672
In what appears to be the second
murderous assault on young lovers

240
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:56,779
in less than a year.

241
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,280
A Vallejo couple
was viciously attacked last night

242
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:02,385
and I'm saddened to report that one
of them has died.

243
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,784
While this small town has mourns
the death of twenty-two year old Gail...

244
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,790
the miracle survivor, Scott Walter,

245
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:12,157
recuperates here
at Sonoma County General Hospital.

246
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:14,159
You thought you were being followed?

247
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,665
Who do you think
was following you, Scott?

248
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:23,438
Did uh, did her husband know
you two were together?

249
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,304
Anything you can tell us, Scott.

250
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:29,303
Anything.

251
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:33,414
She dated a lot of guys.

252
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:36,241
So do you think, Scott,

253
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:38,718
that it might have been one
of her boyfriends?

254
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:46,195
She was acting strange just before.

255
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:51,801
Sort of felt like we were being watched.

256
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:56,370
Scott, is there anything else you can
tell us about his physical appearance?

257
00:32:56,673 --> 00:33:01,303
He had the light in our eyes.
I thought it was a cop.

258
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,240
Say that again.

259
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:08,812
I thought it was a cop.

260
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,183
I'm afraid you gentlemen
are going to need to leave now.

261
00:33:13,523 --> 00:33:14,581
He needs to rest.

262
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:17,985
Scott, listen.

263
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:24,028
If anything comes to mind,
you contact us.

264
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:25,191
Please.

265
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:27,165
Even at this moment,

266
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:30,273
Scott Walton may be providing police
with vital information

267
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:33,808
about the appearance of the deranged
killer who attacked him and Gail Lewis

268
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:36,344
at the Himut Valley golf course
on the fourth of July.

269
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,744
Perhaps an artists drawing
will finally help the police

270
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:41,874
make some progress in capturing
this elusive madman.

271
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,384
In his taunting phone
call to the police

272
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,715
the killer boasted of a double murder

273
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:48,654
but in fact he failed
to kill Scott Walton,

274
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:50,892
he failed to kill him.

275
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:58,032
Altitude now twenty-one thousand
feet still looking very good.

276
00:33:58,735 --> 00:34:00,669
Velocity down not
to twelve hundred feet per second.

277
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:02,294
You're looking great there.

278
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,740
Give us a reading when
the 12-02 programs reading alarm.

279
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:10,540
Roger we're go on that alarm.
Good radar data.

280
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,705
We're now in the approach stage,
everything looking good.

281
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:15,818
Man, this bullshit theory about there
being a bloodthirsty killer on the loose

282
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:18,580
and we don't know this guy is
the same guy that killed the other kid.

283
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:21,283
So what if he makes a phone call?
What does that prove?

284
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,484
Proves he likes to brag,
the son of a bitch,

285
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:24,924
doesn't mean he really did it.

286
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:27,086
I still think it was one
of Gil's boyfriends.

287
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:32,167
Listen to you tow, boyfriends, husbands,
it could have been anybody.

288
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:36,204
That guy, he didn't kill out of passion,
he didn't kill out of anger,

289
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,603
he shot them at random
just because they were there.

290
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:40,676
Wrong place, wrong fucking time.

291
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:48,341
I think that he might
have had training as an officer.

292
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:51,147
Oh Matt, that's crazy, we don't,
we don't have any evidence.

293
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:56,692
Why? A guy pulls up right behind a car
at an angle, driver's side.

294
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:58,294
That's standard police procedure.

295
00:34:58,428 --> 00:35:00,896
Walks up to the car,
approaches them with a flashlight,

296
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,828
shines them right
in the face so they can't see his.

297
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:05,457
That's another standard
police procedure,

298
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:08,264
it's obvious that this guy
is familiar with weapons.

299
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,566
Specifically handguns.

300
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:13,608
Probably years
of training with handguns.

301
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:16,645
This shit moves in
and out without leaving a clue,

302
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,610
a fucking clue.

303
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:19,305
Matt, where are you going with this?

304
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:20,943
No, no, no,
where are you going with this?

305
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:23,985
You think we should start looking
for cops in our own department?

306
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,588
All I'm saying,
all I'm fucking saying...

307
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:26,950
Mare IsIand.

308
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,290
Mare Island.

309
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:32,091
What if he was from the Naval base?

310
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:33,924
What the fuck are you two talking about?

311
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:36,994
It's Mare Island.

312
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,432
They've got a at least
four thousand stationed there.

313
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:41,160
Have any of us interviewed
any of these guys?

314
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:41,861
No.

315
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,337
I don't know, somebody who,
somebody who got discharged,

316
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:46,942
somebody who got into trouble
with the short patrol.

317
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:48,635
-Think about it!
-He's got a point.

318
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:50,943
Matt, you've got a point.

319
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:54,174
Okay, engine stopped,
we copy you down Eagle.

320
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:55,841
The eagle has landed.

321
00:35:57,954 --> 00:36:00,149
I guess that means they did it.

322
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,492
Come on, it's the moon.

323
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:08,190
...That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.

324
00:37:21,438 --> 00:37:23,133
Dear Editor,

325
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:27,209
this is the murderer of the two
teenagers last Christmas at Lake Helena

326
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:30,541
and the girl on the Fourth of July
near the golf course in Vallejo.

327
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:33,708
To prove I killed them
I shall state some facts

328
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,011
which only I and the police know.

329
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:40,714
Christmas. One, brand name
of ammo was Super X.

330
00:37:42,892 --> 00:37:44,985
Two, ten shots were fired.

331
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:49,630
Three, the boy was on his back
with feet to the car.

332
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:54,698
Four, the girl was on her right side,
feet to the west.

333
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,598
Fourth of July.

334
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:01,404
One, girl was wearing patterned slacks.

335
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:04,672
Two, the boy was also shot in the knee.

336
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:08,784
Brand name of ammo was Western.

337
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:10,910
Here is part of a cipher,

338
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:12,919
the other two parts of this cipher
are being mailed to

339
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:16,753
the editors of the San Francisco
Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner.

340
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:20,428
I want you to print the cipher
on the front page of your paper.

341
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:23,065
In the cipher is my identity.

342
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:28,562
If you do not print the cipher
by the afternoon of the first of August,

343
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:31,538
I will go on a kill
rampage Friday night.

344
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:36,304
I will cruise around all weekend
killing alone people in the night,

345
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:38,141
then move along to kill again

346
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:41,773
until I am done with a dozen people
over the weekend.

347
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:49,751
Fucking Shit!

348
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:54,420
Who the hell does this guy think he is?

349
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:56,795
What'd the lab say?

350
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,265
He used a blue tip pen,
nothing unique about it.

351
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:01,700
Could probably pick one up
at any drug store in the country.

352
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:03,097
Same goes for the paper.

353
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:06,106
Umm, he was probably wearing gloves
when he handled the letter.

354
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:06,867
Wearing gloves?

355
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,500
Print analysis
won't be back for at least,

356
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:11,409
what, a couple hours
but it doesn't look good.

357
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:13,209
Oh, according to the NSA guys,

358
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,614
he's right handed but could
have been writing with his left.

359
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:18,778
You see the way that
the k's and the t's slant.

360
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:20,446
Yeah, he's just trying to fool us.

361
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,855
what about all the misspelling?
Tell us anything about his background?

362
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:25,927
I...I don't know.

363
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:27,552
You got any word on cipher?

364
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:31,098
Well, it's a fairly elaborate
cryptogram or code,

365
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:35,364
similar to those used by military
intelligence in World War Two and Korea.

366
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:37,698
He wrote them in three parts.

367
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:39,702
If you put the three parts together,

368
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:44,972
there's a message but it's gonna
take a lot of time to decipher.

369
00:39:45,115 --> 00:39:46,343
We don't have any time,

370
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:48,678
it says here he's gonna start
killing people tonight.

371
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:52,515
Yeah? Perkins here.

372
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:55,715
What about these symbols?
You recognize any of them?

373
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,087
No, random as far as I can tell.

374
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:58,194
This is bullshit, that's what...

375
00:39:58,328 --> 00:39:59,556
Did the feds say how long
they thought it would take?

376
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:01,129
Yeah, they said it'd take about a week.

377
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:02,629
...Well? Why the hell not?

378
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:04,097
Twisted fuck.

379
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:07,498
God damn it! Well, they're gonna run it.

380
00:40:07,937 --> 00:40:09,529
It's gonna hit
the stands tomorrow morning.

381
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:11,702
A killing rampage!

382
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:14,540
I mean this town is already
on the verge of panic.

383
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:15,807
What are these people going to think

384
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:18,379
when they find out that some guy wants
to kill twelve more of them?

385
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:24,783
I got an idea.

386
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:41,300
Your hair looks nice.

387
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:44,265
Hey why don't you relax,
move a little closer.

388
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:47,774
Maybe put your head on my shoulder.

389
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:50,572
What?

390
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:16,668
Here we go, here we go.

391
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:42,961
Freeze! Get your hands up!
Aww! What are you doing?

392
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:44,930
Do you guys know
what's going on right now?

393
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:46,558
Do you have any idea
what's going on right now?

394
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:47,431
Get outta here!

395
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,832
-I didn't touch her.
-Shut up!

396
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:49,734
Get outta here!

397
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:53,604
Be a gentleman and you take her home
right now and you stay home.

398
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,978
Get sticky at home, go!

399
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,402
We have no comment at this time!

400
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,899
Why do you think he hates
the police so much?

401
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,836
What about the cryptogram,
have you figured that out yet?

402
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:35,911
No! No we have not and as soon as we do,
we will get to you guys, okay?

403
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:37,410
Detective, come on, you've gotta
give us a comment about something.

404
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:40,243
Dale, give me a break! What?

405
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:15,440
Can I help you?

406
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:18,706
Yes, ma'am.
Uhh, could I have a word with you?

407
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:20,773
Sure I guess.

408
00:45:27,957 --> 00:45:31,393
She always had a lot of boyfriends but,
but none of them are serious...

409
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:38,125
And Gail's husband, Randall,
he was okay with this?

410
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:40,292
Sure, it wasn't a big deal, alright?

411
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,927
She usually brought
the guys home to meet Randall.

412
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:45,301
She didn't want to hide anything
from anyone.

413
00:45:45,608 --> 00:45:47,940
I know we've asked you this before Patsy,

414
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:53,606
but, can you think of anyone
that might have wanted to hurt Gail.

415
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,151
No, Gail would have told me.

416
00:46:03,392 --> 00:46:05,826
Did she ever date anyone
from Mare Island?

417
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:08,287
No, sailor boys aren't her type.

418
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,465
There was this one guy, Sammy,

419
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:18,302
I think he worked at Mare Island
for a little while.

420
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:21,171
He had a couple of screws loose
so she finally told him to get lost.

421
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,368
That was months ago.

422
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:23,911
You got a last name?

423
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:30,345
Caruso I think or Carasko.

424
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:35,322
He was a mechanic, he um,
drove an old blue pickup.

425
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:41,230
Patsy,

426
00:46:42,331 --> 00:46:44,322
did he look anything like that?

427
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,297
I don't know, I never met him.

428
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,172
Well, the special attention he's given
to the female victims

429
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:58,645
shows a pattern of sorts indicating
some sort of sexual disfunction.

430
00:46:58,781 --> 00:47:02,808
He's obviously intimidated by the male
victime as he attacks them first,

431
00:47:02,952 --> 00:47:05,386
facing and conquering
the immediate threat.

432
00:47:05,855 --> 00:47:06,651
Why teenagers?

433
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:08,381
Well not just teenage victims,

434
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:09,616
but victims engaging in

435
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:14,321
intimate situations of
a potentially sexual nature.

436
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:18,432
Again, he's attacking what
I see as his own fears.

437
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:23,301
Most likely a victim himself.
Childhood abuse or trauma.

438
00:47:23,873 --> 00:47:28,333
I suppose his anger towards women stems
from his relationship with his mother.

439
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:34,307
So uh, why the letters
and the phone calls?

440
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:39,682
This is a very disturbed individual.
I believe he wants to be caught.

441
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:42,522
He wants help and until he gets it,

442
00:47:42,658 --> 00:47:45,718
his violent tendencies
will only become stronger.

443
00:47:49,198 --> 00:47:54,033
Say you will hunt with me. Hunt men?
Say you will hunt with me!

444
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:58,469
No!

445
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:00,303
What do you think I am?

446
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:35,108
Thank you for coming.

447
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:41,111
After extensive study
by expert criminal investigators,

448
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,981
we have concluded that the author
of the letter and cryptogram

449
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,749
may not be the killer
that we are seeking.

450
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:53,787
If he really did kill Mary Boucher,

451
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,057
Michael Newman,

452
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:58,223
and Gale Lewinson

453
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:02,701
then he must provide
the police with more definite proof.

454
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:05,568
That's your new strategy
to become pen pals with the killer?

455
00:49:06,008 --> 00:49:06,975
That's it.

456
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:17,883
This is the Zodiac speaking.

457
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:21,949
In answer to your asking
for more details about the good times

458
00:49:22,091 --> 00:49:23,558
I have had in Vallejo,

459
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:26,091
I shall be very happy
to supply even more material.

460
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:28,958
By the way, have the police been having
a good time with the code?

461
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:32,966
If not, tell them to cheer up;
when they do crack it they will have me.

462
00:49:33,536 --> 00:49:36,505
On the Fourth of July,
I did not open my car door.

463
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,039
The windows was rolled down already.

464
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:42,642
The boy was originally sitting
in the front seat when I began firing.

465
00:49:43,612 --> 00:49:45,204
When I fired the first shot at his head,

466
00:49:45,348 --> 00:49:48,784
he leapt backward at the same time,
thus spoiling my aim.

467
00:49:50,953 --> 00:49:52,716
That's how I shot him in the knee.

468
00:49:54,223 --> 00:49:58,660
The man who told the police my car
was brown was a negro about 40 or 45,

469
00:49:58,794 --> 00:50:00,091
rather shabbily dressed.

470
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,593
I was in this phone booth having some
fun with the cops when he was walking by

471
00:50:12,274 --> 00:50:14,105
Last Christmas, in that episode,

472
00:50:14,243 --> 00:50:17,610
police were wondering as to how I could
shoot my victims in the dark.

473
00:50:17,747 --> 00:50:21,239
What I did was tape a small pencil
flashlight to the barrel of my gun.

474
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:23,511
If you notice in the center
of the beam of light

475
00:50:23,652 --> 00:50:26,780
if you aim it at a wall or ceiling
you will see a black, dark spot

476
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:30,949
in the center of the circle of
light about three to six inches across.

477
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,955
Taped to a gun barrel,

478
00:50:33,095 --> 00:50:37,498
the bullet will strike right in the
center of the black dot in the light.

479
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,004
All I had to do was spray them.

480
00:50:45,641 --> 00:50:47,871
All I had to do was spray them.

481
00:51:09,298 --> 00:51:10,890
Should I leave dad's place?

482
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:13,895
No.

483
00:51:48,971 --> 00:51:50,029
What are you doing?

484
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,566
What's a aphelion?

485
00:51:55,177 --> 00:52:01,844
Aphelion? Aphelion, it's when the earth,

486
00:52:01,984 --> 00:52:05,442
the moon and the sun
are perfectly aligned. Why?

487
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:09,047
Well it says here that there was a um...

488
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:09,987
Aphelion?

489
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,492
Aphelion on July Fourth.

490
00:52:13,562 --> 00:52:14,859
Here look at this.

491
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:20,263
You know what, honey it's late.
You should go to bed.

492
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,962
No. Give me a kiss.

493
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:27,074
Good night.

494
00:52:45,027 --> 00:52:45,823
Parish.

495
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:46,586
Honey,

496
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:50,054
listen Johnny was going
through some of my old astrology books,

497
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:52,997
now it just...
I think he may be on to something.

498
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:56,195
According to this, the first attack was
on the night of the winter solatice

499
00:52:56,338 --> 00:52:57,896
and the second attack was
on the night of...

500
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,100
I don't have time for this right now,
I have, I've gotta get back to work.

501
00:53:01,243 --> 00:53:01,971
We'll talk about it when we get home.

502
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:04,944
Matt, the guy is obviously calling
himself the Zodiac for a reason.

503
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,708
What reason would that be, babe?

504
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:10,448
Listen,
I just have a feeling about this.

505
00:53:10,586 --> 00:53:17,219
Laura, there is no god damned
astrological pattern to this guy, okay?

506
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,327
He's just trying to scare people,
that's all.

507
00:53:19,461 --> 00:53:20,655
Well, it's working.

508
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:22,787
We'll talk about this when I get home.
Okay?

509
00:53:22,932 --> 00:53:26,561
Fine, by the way, happy birthday.

510
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:21,128
What's the PD doing up this way?

511
00:57:23,238 --> 00:57:24,296
Name's Parish.

512
00:57:25,507 --> 00:57:26,531
Gray.

513
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:30,440
I'm looking for Sammy Karzoso,
he works here, doesn't he?

514
00:57:30,946 --> 00:57:31,640
Not anymore,

515
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,146
he quit about two weeks ago
and I haven't seen him since.

516
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:36,410
Could you give me
a physical description on him?

517
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:38,480
Yeah, um...

518
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:40,712
Height?

519
00:57:40,856 --> 00:57:47,091
Five-nine maybe, good sized belly,
brownish hair.

520
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:50,560
Did he look like that?

521
00:57:56,171 --> 00:58:03,168
Yeah, something like that.
Hair might be a wee bit longer now.

522
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:06,540
Do you think you could give me anything
he might have written on?

523
00:58:06,682 --> 00:58:08,274
A job application?

524
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,441
Sure, step into my office.

525
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:15,421
Always knew there was something wrong
with that SOB.

526
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,587
That's a nice Corvair, who's is it?

527
00:58:19,728 --> 00:58:21,855
That little darling's mine,
you interested?

528
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:23,328
No, thank you.

529
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:26,158
Yeah, here it is.

530
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:27,495
Was he working July fourth?

531
00:58:27,636 --> 00:58:29,763
I'm not sure, I went fishing that week.

532
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:31,438
You mind if I keep this?

533
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:33,700
Nah, go ahead. I hope you catch him.

534
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:36,174
He took some
of my tools when he cut out.

535
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:42,607
Thank you, buddy.

536
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:46,683
If you hear anything or see anything,
give me a call, okay?

537
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:47,789
You bet.

538
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:13,906
Great stuff isn't it? The Zodiac?
The Zodiac. The Zodiac. Ahem.

539
00:59:14,049 --> 00:59:17,143
The Zodiac.
Much better than the cipher slayer.

540
00:59:17,419 --> 00:59:21,014
It's got that like creepy magic feel.
Excuse me.

541
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,018
People can't get enough of it.

542
00:59:23,158 --> 00:59:24,853
We're ready whenever you
are Mr. Coverling.

543
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:26,756
Alright, this is what I'd like.

544
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:29,261
I want a wide shot with as much
of the building as possible.

545
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:31,730
Get as much of me as you can, you know.

546
00:59:33,168 --> 00:59:36,660
Get the uh, get the whole outfit.
How do I look?

547
01:00:20,649 --> 01:00:21,843
Hey Johnny!

548
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:23,344
Bye!

549
01:00:23,952 --> 01:00:25,010
Where you going?

550
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:27,955
Nowhere. What about you?

551
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:29,887
Nowhere. You want to walk home?

552
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,366
Film star, Sharon Tate,

553
01:00:46,508 --> 01:00:49,375
another woman and three men
were found slain yesterday.

554
01:00:49,511 --> 01:00:52,105
Their bodies scattered
around a Benedict Canyon estate

555
01:00:52,247 --> 01:00:55,580
in what police say resembled
a ritualistic mass murder.

556
01:00:55,717 --> 01:00:59,118
The victims were shot,
stabbed or throttled.

557
01:00:59,254 --> 01:01:02,690
On the front door of the home written
in blood was one word.

558
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,192
Oh my god.

559
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,960
Isn't it weird,

560
01:01:46,101 --> 01:01:48,797
seeing your dad's picture
in the paper all the time?

561
01:01:50,172 --> 01:01:51,298
Yeah, I guess.

562
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:55,569
Well, The Zodiac's reading
those papers too.

563
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:59,005
He can probably find out
where you guys live.

564
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:19,065
I never saw him much.
He mostly kept to himself.

565
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:23,037
Come out to get his mail,
but that's about it.

566
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:28,466
It's right here.

567
01:02:55,137 --> 01:02:57,298
I've got the forwarding
address downstairs.

568
01:02:57,439 --> 01:03:01,239
I think it's somewhere on Sonoma street.

569
01:03:44,553 --> 01:03:46,282
He has no reason to hide.

570
01:03:46,655 --> 01:03:49,453
He can just go wherever he wants,
no one will notice.

571
01:03:51,726 --> 01:03:55,787
He's not crazy,
nobody seems to get that.

572
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,831
It's like he has this plan
and he's following every detail.

573
01:04:03,038 --> 01:04:07,634
Out of all the places in the world,
why did he come here?

574
01:04:07,776 --> 01:04:12,907
Maybe he didn't come here,
maybe he grew up here.

575
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:12,537
Hello, this is the police.

576
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:53,875
No, no, I wasn't after you.

577
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:56,042
Shit!

578
01:06:25,413 --> 01:06:26,744
Do you want to talk about it?

579
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:44,327
Landlord said she'd only lived there
a few months

580
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:46,866
and she'd never heard
of that Karzoso guy either.

581
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:49,263
It's a dead fucking end.

582
01:06:51,306 --> 01:06:53,137
What the hell was she running for?

583
01:06:53,274 --> 01:06:54,536
Who knows.

584
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:58,968
Evading a warrant,
possession of narcotics,

585
01:06:59,114 --> 01:07:00,945
drug trafficking among other things.

586
01:07:01,082 --> 01:07:05,576
Sad part about it is the girl's
probably never heard of the Zodiac.

587
01:07:06,988 --> 01:07:08,182
Maybe the feds will find something.

588
01:07:08,323 --> 01:07:11,315
The feds only have what we've given em
and we haven't given em shit!

589
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:16,330
The guy is a fuckin ghost.

590
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:21,700
Detective, this is compliments
of the gentleman at the end of the bar.

591
01:07:22,837 --> 01:07:23,929
What?

592
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,365
To my friends in law enforcement.

593
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:33,412
Matt, let it go.

594
01:07:34,315 --> 01:07:35,509
-Let it go.
-Yeah, yeah.

595
01:08:06,848 --> 01:08:10,011
Jesus, god you scared me.

596
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:16,512
What's the door locked for?

597
01:08:16,658 --> 01:08:17,750
Have you been drinking?

598
01:08:19,427 --> 01:08:20,291
What's the door locked for, Laura?

599
01:08:20,428 --> 01:08:21,452
What do you think?

600
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,126
He's still out there.

601
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:26,825
What's that supposed to mean, still?
Still.

602
01:08:30,505 --> 01:08:33,235
Where's Johnny? Johnny?

603
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:36,072
Suddenly you want to talk to him?
You care?

604
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,542
I don't know, honey.

605
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,742
We're scared, okay?

606
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:47,082
I see you're scared,
you're scared John...

607
01:08:47,222 --> 01:08:48,484
Are you even listening
to what I'm saying?

608
01:08:48,623 --> 01:08:50,921
You know why you're scared?
You know why you make him scared?

609
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:53,323
Because you read these fucking papers!

610
01:08:53,461 --> 01:08:55,292
You read all this fucking crap
in the papers,

611
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:58,422
all this gossip,
all these fucking rumors!

612
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:00,328
There's a guy out there
who probably knows where we live

613
01:09:00,468 --> 01:09:03,437
and you want me to leave the door open
and wait for him?

614
01:09:03,571 --> 01:09:06,096
Leave the fucking door unlocked!

615
01:09:06,508 --> 01:09:07,372
How can you say that
when you're never here?

616
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:10,342
You stay put, you stop reading this shit
and nothing is going to happen!

617
01:09:10,478 --> 01:09:11,342
I will take care of this!

618
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:13,344
How can you say that
when you're never home?

619
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:14,607
You're never home anymore!

620
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:16,148
I'm out there doing my job!

621
01:09:16,284 --> 01:09:18,775
No, you're out there
getting fucking drunk!

622
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,946
-Do you fucking understand that?
-Stop it! Stop it!

623
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:28,653
Do you understand me?
Leave it unlocked!

624
01:09:34,936 --> 01:09:36,062
Fuck!

625
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:59,589
This is Dale Coverling reporting live.

626
01:09:59,727 --> 01:10:00,716
I'm here in the town of Salinas,

627
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:05,026
75 miles south of San Francisco outside
the home of two amateur detectives

628
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,498
who broke the code
of the Zodiac's cryptogram,

629
01:10:08,736 --> 01:10:09,760
Fred and Sheila Morris.

630
01:10:09,904 --> 01:10:13,533
They succeeded where the police and
the naval intelligence center failed.

631
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:17,705
The bizarre content of the Zodiac's
message proves beyond a doubt

632
01:10:17,845 --> 01:10:20,973
that a cold blooded monster
is stocking the foothills of Vallejo.

633
01:10:36,798 --> 01:10:39,266
The decoded message reads, and I quote,

634
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,664
''I like killing people because
it is so much fun,

635
01:10:41,803 --> 01:10:44,271
it is more fun than killing wild game
in the forest.

636
01:10:44,405 --> 01:10:47,033
Man is the most dangerous animal
of all to kill,

637
01:10:47,175 --> 01:10:49,541
something that gives me
the most thrilling experience.

638
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:52,737
It is even better than getting
your rocks off with a girl.

639
01:10:54,015 --> 01:10:56,540
I will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down

640
01:10:56,684 --> 01:10:59,881
or stop my collection of slaves.

641
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:39,419
It's so beautifuI here.

642
01:11:40,094 --> 01:11:44,121
Yeah, it wouIdn't be haIf
as beautifuI without you.

643
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:47,294
I wish you weren't going.

644
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:50,329
It's gonna be okay.

645
01:11:51,906 --> 01:11:53,601
I mean, we're stiII gonna
see each other, right?

646
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:57,144
I know.

647
01:11:58,513 --> 01:12:00,947
Hey, we're not aIone.

648
01:12:04,852 --> 01:12:05,784
I don't see anybody.

649
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,911
There was a guy. He's right over there.

650
01:12:09,223 --> 01:12:10,315
You think we shouId move?

651
01:12:10,692 --> 01:12:11,784
I don't know.

652
01:12:12,093 --> 01:12:12,957
Uh uh.

653
01:12:28,242 --> 01:12:29,436
-Oh my god.
-It's cool,

654
01:12:29,877 --> 01:12:31,640
what do you want my wallet
or something?

655
01:12:33,114 --> 01:12:35,412
I don't understand,
what does he want Paul?

656
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:37,848
I don't know. Oh my god.

657
01:12:45,393 --> 01:12:46,758
I'm sorry.

658
01:12:46,894 --> 01:12:49,488
Shh. It's fine sweetheart,
just do what he says.

659
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:56,031
Oh god, please! No!

660
01:12:56,604 --> 01:13:01,166
He will do it!...

661
01:13:05,046 --> 01:13:07,640
Please! Please...

662
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:41,474
Hello, Napa Police Department.

663
01:13:41,616 --> 01:13:43,015
I want to report a murder.

664
01:13:43,151 --> 01:13:45,051
-Sir, where are you...
-No, a double murder.

665
01:13:45,753 --> 01:13:48,688
They are two miles north
of park headquarters.

666
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:49,721
Okay, sir...

667
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:52,087
They are in a white
Volkswagen Karmann Ghia.

668
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,920
What part of area did you say? Sir?

669
01:13:55,062 --> 01:13:57,690
Sir? Can you tell me
where you're calling from please?

670
01:13:57,832 --> 01:13:58,958
I'm the one that did it.

671
01:14:17,785 --> 01:14:18,615
Hey, Matt.

672
01:14:20,655 --> 01:14:21,917
Didn't take them long to print it.

673
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:23,457
I didn't think it would.

674
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:27,384
Here's some old hospital records
on that Cordoza guy,

675
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:28,827
thought you'd want to see it.

676
01:14:28,963 --> 01:14:29,622
Any photos?

677
01:14:29,764 --> 01:14:31,959
No, but we found a current address.

678
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:37,504
2323 Sangragorio.

679
01:14:37,638 --> 01:14:39,401
It's on the far east side of town,
right?

680
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,633
Yeah, it's out past Lake Helena.

681
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,440
What is it?

682
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:52,142
The profile matches perfectly,
we just need the go ahead.

683
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,344
Where did he get the car?

684
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:54,477
He had access to a Corvair.

685
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:56,522
I don't see a photograph.

686
01:14:56,657 --> 01:14:57,351
No, not yet.

687
01:14:57,492 --> 01:14:59,323
How about the handwriting analysis?

688
01:15:02,163 --> 01:15:03,562
We've gotta do this now.

689
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:04,629
Listen, son,

690
01:15:04,765 --> 01:15:09,134
I want this guy as bad as
you do but we have to play by the rules.

691
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:12,296
This is the guy, if we stop him now,
the whole thing is over.

692
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,931
Not without a positive ID.

693
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:20,111
What did he say?

694
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:22,479
Let's go.

695
01:15:24,852 --> 01:15:27,184
The recent attack by the Zodiac killer
demonstrates that

696
01:15:27,321 --> 01:15:29,050
this deranged murder is also willing

697
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:31,488
to seek victims outside
the Vallejo area.

698
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:34,951
Most shocking of all is
the bizarre costume the Zodiac wore

699
01:15:35,096 --> 01:15:37,724
when he attacked
Gina Chambers and Paul Carmichael.

700
01:15:38,266 --> 01:15:40,632
Miraculously, Carmichael survived
the attack

701
01:15:40,768 --> 01:15:43,566
despite receiving seven
vicious knife wounds.

702
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:45,930
Gina Chambers was not so fortunate.

703
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:49,574
She was stabbed a total of thirteen
times and died almost immediately.

704
01:15:50,378 --> 01:15:53,370
The police seem helpless to stop
the Zodiac from killing at will.

705
01:15:53,514 --> 01:15:55,982
More on this story after
these commercial announcements.

706
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:19,901
Did you pack your bags yet?

707
01:16:20,274 --> 01:16:21,104
I'm not going!

708
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:22,675
We're going, okay?

709
01:16:23,878 --> 01:16:25,072
I don't wanna go.

710
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,472
Johnny, we're leaving.

711
01:16:33,955 --> 01:16:35,081
Johnny?

712
01:18:34,742 --> 01:18:36,539
Hands in the air! Don't move!

713
01:18:40,314 --> 01:18:41,679
Man I didn't do anything!

714
01:18:41,816 --> 01:18:47,083
Sammy Karzoso, you fucking say it!
You fucking say it!

715
01:18:48,789 --> 01:18:50,984
I didn't do anything, I swear!

716
01:18:51,559 --> 01:18:54,255
Yeah, I'm Sammy Karzoso
but I didn't do anything, man.

717
01:18:54,395 --> 01:18:58,195
It's not him, Matt! It's not him!

718
01:19:00,701 --> 01:19:02,032
I swear!

719
01:19:02,436 --> 01:19:03,562
It's not him.

720
01:19:04,572 --> 01:19:05,903
Take it easy.

721
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:08,300
Matt.

722
01:19:33,601 --> 01:19:34,625
Your free?

723
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:35,758
Depends, where you going?

724
01:19:36,036 --> 01:19:37,230
Washington and Maple.

725
01:19:37,538 --> 01:19:38,505
In Presidio Heights?

726
01:19:38,639 --> 01:19:39,731
Yes.

727
01:19:40,241 --> 01:19:42,675
It's your lucky day,
I'm heading over there anyway. Climb in.

728
01:19:58,192 --> 01:20:00,456
...You've embarrassed the department,
you've embarrassed yourself,

729
01:20:00,594 --> 01:20:01,822
you've embarrassed your family.

730
01:20:01,962 --> 01:20:03,657
I don't want to see
your fucking face anymore!

731
01:20:03,798 --> 01:20:06,665
Get the hell out of here
and take the fucking files with you!

732
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:44,927
So here we are.

733
01:20:45,339 --> 01:20:46,704
Go up to those steps.

734
01:20:49,743 --> 01:20:50,801
Alright.

735
01:21:11,232 --> 01:21:15,464
Alright, so you owe me four...
Ahhh, ugh!

736
01:22:56,403 --> 01:22:57,529
Excuse me.

737
01:22:59,173 --> 01:23:00,231
Excuse me.

738
01:23:02,176 --> 01:23:05,009
Did you see anybody walking away
from that taxicab?

739
01:23:07,047 --> 01:23:07,979
What?

740
01:23:09,583 --> 01:23:13,349
Have you seen an adult negro male
in the past few minutes?

741
01:23:13,687 --> 01:23:16,850
Uhh, yes. I did.

742
01:23:17,925 --> 01:23:19,256
He went that way.

743
01:23:20,728 --> 01:23:22,559
Thanks, go home.

744
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:28,967
That way. That way.

745
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:50,744
This is the Zodiac speaking.

746
01:24:52,886 --> 01:24:54,547
I'm the murderer of the taxi driver

747
01:24:54,688 --> 01:24:57,248
over by Washington
and Maple street last night.

748
01:24:59,093 --> 01:25:02,028
To prove this, here is a blood stained
piece of his shirt.

749
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:06,524
I'm the same man who did in the people
in the North Bay area.

750
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:15,601
School children make nice targets.

751
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:19,774
I think I shall wipe out
a school bus some morning.

752
01:25:21,048 --> 01:25:22,447
Just shoot out the front tire

753
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:24,608
and pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out.

754
01:25:24,751 --> 01:25:26,548
School children make nice targets.

755
01:25:26,687 --> 01:25:28,951
I think I shall wipe out
a school bus some morning.

756
01:25:29,089 --> 01:25:30,386
Just shoot out the front tire

757
01:25:30,524 --> 01:25:33,493
and then pick off the kddies
as they come bouncing out.

758
01:25:33,627 --> 01:25:34,753
That was the word of the Zodiac...

759
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:36,624
...in a scene that's being played out
in neighborhoods all over the Bay Area,

760
01:25:36,763 --> 01:25:38,958
anxious parents are wondering
whether their children

761
01:25:39,099 --> 01:25:41,499
will be safe from attack by the Zodiac.

762
01:25:41,635 --> 01:25:46,698
In his newest letter which specifically
threatens to target school buses...

763
01:27:35,582 --> 01:27:37,777
I'm waiting for a good movie about me.

764
01:27:38,685 --> 01:27:45,750
Who will play me,
I am now in control of all things.
