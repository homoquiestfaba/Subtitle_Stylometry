00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,583
13th of July, 4:50 pm.

6
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,405
I’m sorry...

7
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,885
I know that means
little at this point,

8
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:11,271
but I am.

9
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,024
I tried,

10
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:17,532
I think you would all
agree that I tried.

11
00:01:18,773 --> 00:01:20,573
To be true,

12
00:01:21,137 --> 00:01:22,937
to be strong,

13
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,567
to be kind, to love,

14
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:29,604
to be right.

15
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,987
But I wasn’t.

16
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:35,366
And I know you knew this.
In each of your ways.

17
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:38,468
And I am sorry.

18
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,704
All is lost here...

19
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,227
except for soul and body...
that is, what’s left of them.

20
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:52,944
And a halfday’s ration.

21
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:56,734
It’s inexcusable
really, I know that now.

22
00:01:58,293 --> 00:02:02,238
How it could have taken this long to
admit that I’m not sure...

23
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:04,163
but it did.

24
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,252
I fought ‘til the end,

25
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:09,683
I’m not sure what that is worth,

26
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:12,917
but know that I did.

27
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,374
I have always hoped
for more for you all...

28
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:20,445
I will miss you.

29
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:25,439
I’m sorry.

CELESTIAL NAVIGATION FOR YACHTSMEN

32
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,641
This is the Virginia Jean
with an S.O.S. call, over?

33
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,480
This is the Virginia Jean
with an S.O.S. call, over?

34
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:09,305
This is the Virginia Jean
with an S.O.S. call, over?

35
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,021
This is the Virginia Jean
with an S.O.S. call, over?

36
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:21,009
This...

37
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:28,904
Fuck!

38
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,402
Come on. Come on.

39
01:16:58,235 --> 01:17:00,875
Hey!

40
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,507
Help!

41
01:17:09,508 --> 01:17:13,626
I'm here! Help! Here! There!

42
01:17:14,918 --> 01:17:18,280
Help! Help!

43
01:17:19,996 --> 01:17:21,796
Help!

44
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:27,858
Help! Help!

45
01:17:28,885 --> 01:17:31,851
You! Here! There!
