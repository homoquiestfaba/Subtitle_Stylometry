1
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:09,435
Hey streamers, how's it going?

2
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:11,102
It's Ethan here.

3
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:13,893
I am finally doing it.

4
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:16,268
I'm moving to Los
Angeles, I am on my way.

5
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:21,475
I am about to catch a bus
and I packed all my things.

6
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:22,726
I'm leaving.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,643
I'm gonna become a famous actor.

8
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,976
I just know it, I can feel
it for myself, you know.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,268
I'm gonna be a hundred
percent honest with you guys.

10
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:33,060
My mom kind of gave me like
the ultimatum of ultimatums

11
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:38,475
where she told me that if
I don't stop being gay,

12
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:42,518
then I can't live there anymore.

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,768
So as you know,

14
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:48,459
you can't stop being
something that you are.

15
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:51,227
So I'm off.

16
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:55,475
Everyone, I made it iconic
Hollywood and Vine sign.

17
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,851
I can't believe I
made it this far.

18
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,726
All right, I'll check you later.

19
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:42,376
Hey, is this apartment one?

20
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,475
No, it's actually over there.

21
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,518
Oh.

22
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:50,185
Oh my gosh, you must
be Al's new roommate.

23
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:50,851
Ah, yeah.

24
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,475
I'm your neighbor, I
live right back there.

25
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,685
I'm just out here
taking my medicine.

26
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,475
Cool, cool.

27
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:59,976
Do you want the last hit
before you knock on the door?

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,768
Sure, why not?

29
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:12,475
Oh my God, are you okay?

30
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:17,143
Yeah, it's much stronger than
the stuff I have at home.

31
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,893
My name's Ethan, by the way.

32
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:19,643
What's your name?

33
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,475
My name is Ricardo
Manuel Diego de la Mon,

34
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:23,810
but most people
just call me Ricky.

35
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, thanks for the weed,
but I should probably...

36
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:34,435
Hey, before you
knock on the door.

37
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:35,185
Did you say something?

38
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,851
Yeah. I just wanted to
give you a heads up.

39
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,475
Al seems like a really nice guy,

40
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:42,475
but he's been going through
a lot of roommates lately.

41
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:44,310
I don't know what that's about.

42
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,227
I just wanted to let you know.

43
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:47,976
Okay.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,268
Thank you, nice to meet you.

45
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,292
I'm a hugger, new roomy.

46
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,851
Let me show you your room.

47
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,167
Great.

48
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:15,499
It's right back this way.

49
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:22,352
I left it pretty empty

50
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:25,227
so you can do whatever
you want with it.

51
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:27,227
Great.

52
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:29,475
Well, I'll leave you to it.

53
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:30,810
I know you must be exhausted.

54
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:35,394
Perfect, I really
don't need much.

55
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,352
Thank you.

56
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,060
Sure.

57
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,499
See you later.

58
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,102
Welcome to sunny
Southern California.

59
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:06,475
Okay, my new behind the wheel
dilettante named Imani.

60
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:07,475
Your pronouns are she/her.

61
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:09,518
My name is Raymond, my
pronouns are he/him.

62
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,935
I'm the head of the LGBT
transportation department.

63
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,060
I maintain order through
safety while this department

64
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:19,435
is under my magnificent
and watchful eye.

65
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:23,518
Okay, got a busy day
so let's get started.

66
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:24,185
Okay.

67
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:27,559
T-minus 300 seconds to
debrief you on your orientation.

68
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,352
And then we will begin
the first of your many

69
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:33,685
transportation training days.

70
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,542
Glad you're with us.

71
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:41,102
It's raining cats
and dogs out here.

72
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:43,625
Let's get started.

73
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:05,768
Ethan, I'm not really
sure where you are,

74
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:06,685
but with the Lord's help,

75
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:11,209
you can receive his
forgiveness and love.

76
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,834
Fuck you.

77
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,475
Thank you for calling Greyhound.

78
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:24,643
You can say check
schedules, book a trip,

79
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,018
find a bus stop, track my bus,

80
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:31,376
or say help me with
something else.

81
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:47,352
Pancakes, bacon, hash browns.

82
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,060
Sound good?

83
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:50,475
Yeah.

84
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:53,685
You know, I forgot if
you were keto or vegan

85
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:58,435
or something like
that, but anyway,

86
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:02,459
sit down and pour
yourself some OJ.

87
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,251
You okay?

88
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,851
Fine, yeah.

89
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,167
Yeah.

90
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,292
What's all this?

91
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:30,000
I've been saving for this move,

92
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:35,475
working fast food,
smelling like old grease,

93
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:36,518
you know, just trying to get out

94
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:40,583
of my family's religious claws.

95
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,851
I just lost all the
money that I saved.

96
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:52,143
It was stolen or something
on the bus and you know,

97
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,518
I called Greyhound, but
it's not like anybody

98
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:59,834
is gonna turn in $4,000
in cash, you know?

99
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:03,917
Oh, wow.

100
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:08,251
I'm so sorry.

101
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,834
There's plenty of
fast food places here.

102
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:20,499
Hey, you're paid up until
the end of the month.

103
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:25,418
I'm sure you'll be
able to find a job.

104
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:31,435
I'm living on kind of a tight
budget, so if you don't...

105
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:36,435
Yeah, I understand.

106
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,917
I do, yeah.

107
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:50,475
These pancakes look amazing.

108
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,750
Thanks.

109
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,435
You know, I've got some
contacts in the industry,

110
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,475
casting directors, agents,
producers to mention a few.

111
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:07,518
What if I reached out
to some of them for you?

112
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,227
Maybe I can have one 'em over
for a drink or something.

113
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:11,143
Maybe one of them can help you.

114
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:16,583
I mean, that would
be outrageous.

115
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,499
That's great, I'll reach out.

116
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:24,310
Man, I'm gonna have to
find a job or something

117
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,583
real quick now.

118
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,559
Good morning, streamers.

119
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,227
Ethan here.

120
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:38,475
Already, my new roomie
is gonna set me up

121
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,476
with some nice
connections in Hollywood.

122
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,893
So be ready to see
me on screen real quick.

123
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,185
I can't believe it.

124
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:49,685
It's been raining for days now.

125
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,726
Who says it never rains in LA?

126
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,601
I want introduce you to
this beautiful work of art.

127
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,685
The van!

128
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,227
The LGBT Center's newest asset.

129
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:04,893
Or new to the LGBT Center.

130
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,475
She's top of the line,

131
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:11,709
the transportation that
takes us to our higher power.

132
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,726
Smell that Imani?

133
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,000
It's the smell of
hope and freedom.

134
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,475
Soon you will be assigned

135
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,851
a transportation department
vehicle of your own

136
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,935
and complete a noble
and inspiring deed

137
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,893
every time you do.

138
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:30,143
In the end, you'll know
everything there is to know

139
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:34,268
about transporting homeless
youth to the center

140
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:36,475
and all the information
you'll need to navigate

141
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:43,709
the treacherous and unforgiving
waters of the streets of LA.

142
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,834
You think you can handle it?

143
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,352
I think I...

144
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:57,376
Good, I'm glad to hear your
sweet reply of approval.

145
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,476
Mm.

146
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,352
Okay.

147
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:04,499
On to our first
pickup of the day.

148
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,726
All right streamers,
check it out.

149
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,625
Look, we are at the world
renowned Chinese Theater.

150
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:01,475
Look at it.

151
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:04,935
So many parties, award
ceremonies and movie premieres

152
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,667
all happen right here.

153
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,475
Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:17,167
I'll hold, I'll hold.

155
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,726
Hey, how you doing?

156
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,601
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,060
I was calling about
my schedule next week.

158
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:32,935
I was hoping if
there was any chance

159
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,227
I could get any more hours?

160
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:37,185
Uh, I think at this moment,

161
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,060
this is all we could do for you.

162
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:40,601
I'll work anytime.

163
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,976
I'll come really early.

164
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,310
I'll even learn how
to make the bagels,

165
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,435
like I'll even wipe the floors.

166
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,185
I'll do anything,
just let me know.

167
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,185
I understand, I understand.

168
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,475
Just at the moment...

169
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:54,475
Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

170
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:55,935
We have all the staff

171
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,394
that we basically
need for full-time.

172
00:14:58,418 --> 00:15:01,102
See, I'm only working
12 hours next week

173
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:04,060
and I was really hoping
for a full-time position.

174
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:06,851
And you did promise
that at least that...

175
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,018
But right now we can't do that.

176
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:10,976
Yeah, yep.

177
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,768
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but we...

178
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,875
Yeah, I understand.

179
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:16,768
Thank you.

180
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:17,685
See you in the morning.

181
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,475
Yeah, I'll see you first
thing tomorrow morning.

182
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,875
Bye.

183
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,209
Morning.

184
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,310
How's the new job?

185
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:52,893
It's okay.

186
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,559
I now know 24 different
kinds of smears

187
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,643
and 11 different
kinds of bagels.

188
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,102
I don't know if you noticed
the bag on the counter,

189
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:04,227
but figured out at least
help with some day-old bagels.

190
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:07,476
Great! Coffee?

191
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,102
I'm gonna have to
get another job.

192
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:12,476
They promised me
full time, but I...

193
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,475
Well, I've got some good news.

194
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,475
I have this casting
director friend, Tommy,

195
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,518
who said he'd be
happy to meet you.

196
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,475
I know some of the
basics, head shots,

197
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:23,518
getting into an acting
class, getting an agent,

198
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,394
but I'm sure he can point
you in the right direction.

199
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,685
It's all who you know.

200
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:31,060
That's fucking amazing.

201
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:32,976
Thank you.

202
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,559
You're welcome, I'm
glad I can help.

203
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,042
Thank you

204
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,352
You are a very good looking kid.

205
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:52,499
Got the blonde hair, blue
eye, whole thing going.

206
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:56,394
So why do you wanna be an actor?

207
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:58,268
That's a great question.

208
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,500
Actually...

209
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,394
Something within me,
always just the ham

210
00:17:03,418 --> 00:17:06,018
and just wanting to get
in front of people...

211
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,475
- Okay.
- At a young age.

212
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:08,475
And you know, I'm good.

213
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:13,475
I know it, and I just really
want to follow that dream.

214
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:13,976
Hmm.

215
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,726
I've really got nothing to lose.

216
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,475
Nope, nothing to lose.

217
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:18,935
Nothing.

218
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,685
So you're willing to
do pretty much anything

219
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,476
to reach that dream?

220
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,625
He was brought up very
religious, like crazy.

221
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,476
Yeah.

222
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,251
Yeah, I think I'd do
just about anything.

223
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:46,851
You know, there's something
so incredibly commercial

224
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,643
about you.

225
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,475
I have six...

226
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:54,352
I have at least seven projects
I could put you on right now.

227
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:55,726
I admire your tenacity.

228
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,893
Come out to California,
Hollywood with nothing,

229
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:02,893
just the shirt on your back.

230
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:07,310
It would be nice if there
was someone on the inside

231
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:10,352
who was helping you out, right?

232
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:10,810
Yeah.

233
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:13,475
I could do that,
I would do that.

234
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:15,268
I mean, you have no
idea how thankful I'd be

235
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,935
if you did that for me.

236
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,976
It's insane out there.

237
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,394
So many young men like yourself
come here almost daily.

238
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:25,185
They never have
anybody like Tommy here

239
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,810
to step in and help them.

240
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,042
It's fine.

241
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:55,376
See, you're a natural.

242
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:04,685
It's so good, you're
staying in shape I see.

243
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:08,792
Strong, working out.

244
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:10,601
Got your hair cut short.

245
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,475
That looks good.

246
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:14,475
All kinds of looks.

247
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:17,268
You got a great look.

248
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:18,476
What kind of stuff do you watch?

249
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,475
What are we gonna
send you out for?

250
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:25,500
Streaming, movies?

251
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:28,475
Ethan, I had a dream from God

252
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:32,726
that you will one day
know his love and grace.

253
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:40,000
He can either hate the one
and love the other or else

254
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:44,459
hold the one and
despise the other.

255
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:50,209
You cannot love
both God and money.

256
00:20:57,499 --> 00:21:00,227
Hey, this is
Jim at the bagel shop.

257
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:04,209
And where are you?

258
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:11,126
We just can't have
people coming in...

259
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,102
Good morning, sleepy head.

260
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:00,475
Al, what the fuck
happened last night?

261
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:07,959
Oh, well, it looks like you
and Tommy really hit it off.

262
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:11,143
I don't remember it.

263
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:14,976
It's all blurry and fucked up.

264
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,418
I think we had sex.

265
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:25,334
Was that your first time?

266
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:37,935
I lost my job.

267
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,768
I was supposed to come in
really early this morning

268
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:45,334
and I didn't wake up till
a couple minutes ago.

269
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:48,601
Oh, I'm sorry.

270
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,475
I didn't know.

271
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:52,499
If I knew, I would've
woken you up.

272
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,475
Well, I have some good news.

273
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:01,060
Tommy called and said he
had an audition for you.

274
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:02,018
It's really easy.

275
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:05,935
All you need to do is do a
self audition and send it off.

276
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:06,726
I'll help.

277
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,435
Tommy already
emailed me the sides.

278
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,475
I think he wants to
see you this weekend.

279
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:17,310
Al, I'm a little
freaked out by Tommy.

280
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:21,435
Well, Tommy can really
do a lot for you.

281
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:24,435
I kind of have a boyfriend.

282
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:26,750
He lives here?

283
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:28,518
I've never met him in person

284
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,475
and he hasn't responded
to any of my texts,

285
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:36,102
so I don't really know what's
happening with that, but.

286
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:37,185
Well, Tommy mentioned he might

287
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,227
also have some
other work for you.

288
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,518
Work, what kind?

289
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:41,893
Well, I don't know.

290
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:44,227
You'll have to ask him.

291
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:45,810
He really likes you.

292
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:49,976
I guess I'm a little bit
of a lightweight, huh?

293
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,475
Hi, I'm Ethan Bates
and I'm auditioning

294
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,518
for the role of Kevin.

295
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,643
Thanks.

296
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,475
I don't know what to say.

297
00:23:58,499 --> 00:23:59,475
I just wanted to speak to you

298
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,976
ever since the
first day of school.

299
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,935
You're amazing and I wonder

300
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:05,102
if you might just want
to go out with me?

301
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:06,476
I know it's weird and all,

302
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,185
but really, could
you just say yes?

303
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:12,499
I mean, what do
you have to lose?

304
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:16,475
Is that okay?

305
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:17,726
Great.

306
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,810
Shall I make us some eggs?

307
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,060
Check it out, streamers.

308
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:32,102
I made it all the way
to the Hollywood sign.

309
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:32,685
I'll chat later.

310
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,394
I gotta head out
and keep exploring.

311
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:36,976
I can't believe I
made it this far.

312
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:26,475
I'm at Capitol Records
everyone, look at it.

313
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:29,268
Why is it shaped like that, huh?

314
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:30,394
Is it a record?

315
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:33,643
I don't know, it's
pretty sick though.

316
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:37,000
I can't believe it.

317
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,334
Sick.

318
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:43,227
Does this look good or what?

319
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,475
It's party time.

320
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:46,310
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

321
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:48,893
Just gotta make sure I don't
get as wiped out as last time.

322
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,643
That was really embarrassing.

323
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:52,227
I wouldn't worry about it.

324
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:56,352
Did I tell you how he's bringing
this friend, a director?

325
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:59,102
No, Al.

326
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:02,476
God, now I'm even
more freaked out.

327
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:13,893
Hey, you two.

328
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:14,643
It's good to see you.

329
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,268
Al, good to see
you. Thanks for having us.

330
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,475
I've had a crazy
week. I'm happy to be here.

331
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:21,499
I need a cocktail.

332
00:26:23,418 --> 00:26:25,518
Hey, beautiful.

333
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,352
You killed that self tape.

334
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:30,268
You didn't get a call back,

335
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:32,601
but there's so much more
where that came from.

336
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,643
You're just so natural.

337
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,685
Your instincts are great.

338
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:38,475
You're a talented man.

339
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:40,851
And speaking of talent,
this is Jonathan,

340
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:41,935
an amazing film director.

341
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:48,143
He's up and coming and always
looking for new talents, comme ça.

342
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,475
Hey Ethan, nice to meet you.

343
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:52,875
Nice to meet you too.

344
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,310
He's really good looking, right?

345
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:57,475
Yes, yes very.

346
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:59,476
So what can I get you two?

347
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,310
Ah, whatever you're having.

348
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:05,401
I'll have some vodka.

349
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:06,643
Perfect, perfect.

350
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,726
Actually, let's
go do some shots.

351
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,726
We're doing shots tonight.

352
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,185
Hey, so where you from, man?

353
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:12,601
I better not.

354
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,475
I don't want to get as
fucked up as last time.

355
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,976
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

356
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,935
This is a celebration.

357
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:22,601
You are going to be a
big star, all right,

358
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,475
with my help and
Jonathan's help.

359
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:27,376
You really think so?

360
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:31,102
I know so.

361
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:33,685
With a face like
that, of course.

362
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,475
So where are you from?

363
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:36,310
Michigan.

364
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:37,685
How long you been here?

365
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,102
Just a few weeks.

366
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:40,475
Having fun?

367
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:41,475
- Yeah.
- Good.

368
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:42,143
Got family here?

369
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,643
I don't really talk
to my family all that much.

370
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,143
So you need some
friends here, right?

371
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,143
It's good, it's good.

372
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,475
We can be your friends.

373
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:52,475
Okay guys, here we go, shots.

374
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:55,060
All right, shots,
shots, shots, shots.

375
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:56,810
That's not for you.

376
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,768
That is for you.

377
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:01,268
Here we go.

378
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,060
To Ethan.

379
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:04,018
To Ethan.

380
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,334
Ethan.

381
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:09,394
That's some good stuff.

382
00:28:09,418 --> 00:28:10,851
Woo.

383
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:15,768
So I have a perfect job
for you and it's so easy.

384
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,394
I've got these industry friends,

385
00:28:17,418 --> 00:28:18,475
directors and things like that.

386
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,102
There are these
parties coming along

387
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:22,601
and they like handsome
young men by their side.

388
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,060
Emmy's are coming up, Oscars...

389
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:25,726
SAG awards.

390
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,268
Perfect, SAG awards.

391
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,518
Just smile and be polite.

392
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,810
It's a perfect
opportunity for you.

393
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,060
It's a great opportunity.

394
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:34,643
You'd be with these
big name stars.

395
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,559
Get you nice suits.

396
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,394
A nice haircut.

397
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:40,060
You're hanging with
industry professionals.

398
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:42,499
You like that?

399
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:43,475
Yeah.

400
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:44,935
- Yes you do.
- Yeah.

401
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:48,227
- You like that.
- Are you okay?

402
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:50,851
He's fine, he'll be good.
You'll be good, right?

403
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,334
You're good.

404
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,601
He should take a nap.

405
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,726
All right?

406
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,499
Ricky.

407
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,685
Ricky.

408
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:18,209
I'm impressed how you're
handling yourself.

409
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,768
Thank you.

410
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,935
How long have you
been doing this?

411
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,542
Over a decade.

412
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:34,476
Drugs, abuse, no education,

413
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,102
no resources or
employment opportunities.

414
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:41,018
It's horrific what
some of these kids

415
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:43,475
have to go through.

416
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:48,475
Something have learning or
developmental disabilities

417
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:49,394
or physical problems.

418
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:53,475
One time I found this new
intake in a parking lot

419
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:59,685
behind a 7-Eleven pushing him
himself around with a large stick.

420
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:02,376
That's terrible.

421
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,352
That's why I'm here.

422
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,768
This is so important to me.

423
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:11,500
I've been so close to
being where these kids are.

424
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:15,418
Me too.

425
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:23,227
I was fortunate when I
was thrown out of my house

426
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:28,810
by my father, I had an
auntie that took me in.

427
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,376
She was amazing.

428
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:36,499
That's good.

429
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:40,499
I wasn't so lucky.

430
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,625
As you know, most
homeless youth or LGBTQ

431
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:47,518
are thrown out of their families

432
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:50,792
just for being who they are,

433
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,475
or they run away 'cos they know

434
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:59,583
they'd be rejected or killed.

435
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:03,018
So they come to
Hollywood with a dream

436
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:10,459
and end up on the streets
doing drugs or forced on 'em,

437
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:14,500
sometimes even prostitution.

438
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,475
Is that something
you went through?

439
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:27,625
Sometimes you just
do what you gotta do.

440
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:33,976
Eat up.

441
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,499
You've only got 15 minutes.

442
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:56,976
From Pastor Robinson,

443
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,976
Jesus is with us in
our darkest hour.

444
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:22,209
Hey.

445
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:26,459
I saw you on your phone.

446
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,126
Hey, I can...

447
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:37,917
If you want...

448
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:43,768
It's so pure, you won't
care about anything.

449
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:46,500
So fucking good.

450
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:49,875
You'll forget you're hungry.

451
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:12,875
Hello, Mom?

452
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,726
It's me, it's me.

453
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,518
Yeah.

454
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,726
No, I'm okay.

455
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,643
Everything's going great here.

456
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:25,875
I've got a couple
auditions and you know,

457
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,499
I think things are
working out here.

458
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:34,976
Yeah, yeah I know Dad
doesn't give a shit.

459
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,459
I understand.

460
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:42,917
No, a friend let
me use his phone.

461
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:45,851
All right, Mom.

462
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,518
Well, I gotta go.

463
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:49,976
All right?

464
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,126
I love you and I'll talk to
you when I can, all right?

465
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:07,418
Thank you.

466
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,475
I don't feel anything.

467
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:08,042
Just wait, just wait.

468
00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:11,185
Hang with me.

469
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:14,475
I'll show you how to
survive out here.

470
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:16,292
How many transports do
we have left to do today?

471
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,851
Just one more intake.

472
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,726
What's the deets on it?

473
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:30,475
Well, let's get there
early and have a coffee.

474
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:33,102
It's a 19 year old
female named Sarah

475
00:42:33,126 --> 00:42:38,102
and will be waiting outside
at the 7-Eleven in Hollywood.

476
00:42:38,126 --> 00:42:40,893
Dispatch indicated
she should have ID,

477
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:42,935
so I'll check on that.

478
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:45,376
Copy that.

479
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:49,209
Coffee's on you rookie.

480
00:42:50,376 --> 00:42:51,394
Don't worry.

481
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:56,334
7-Eleven coffee, surprisingly good.

482
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:02,475
Woo!

483
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:04,518
Let's go!

484
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:19,500
That's 40.

485
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:25,499
Fuck you, fuck you pervert.

486
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:49,976
Ethan, the devil comes
like a thief in the night

487
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,476
seeking who he may devour.

488
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,310
Be careful, son.

489
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:58,084
Don't let the devil entice you.

490
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:15,000
I don't understand.

491
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:20,499
I'm a good person.

492
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:25,268
What the fuck?

493
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:26,394
I'm so stupid.

494
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:29,102
I just, I trust people.

495
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:31,875
I believe them.

496
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:41,352
I believe people and all
these fucking guys just want

497
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:45,126
is to just fuck me.

498
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:54,601
My life has been so fucked up.

499
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:25,102
A fucking fucked up religion.

500
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:26,935
I just...

501
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:57,209
All is not well.

502
00:45:59,459 --> 00:46:03,476
I've got no money.

503
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,959
Nowhere to go.

504
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:14,352
You know, I thought I'd
hit rock bottom when...

505
00:46:14,376 --> 00:46:18,499
I thought I hit rock bottom.

506
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:24,418
I didn't.

507
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:28,542
I didn't.

508
00:48:57,084 --> 00:49:01,352
Hi, I was just wondering
if you were busy.

509
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:03,851
Sorry, I don't know
what I'm doing.

510
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,060
It's 40.

511
00:49:05,084 --> 00:49:08,394
Okay.

512
00:49:08,418 --> 00:49:09,768
Are you okay?

513
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:11,726
I mean, you look...

514
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,292
I'm fine.

515
00:49:14,499 --> 00:49:17,376
What happened to you?

516
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:22,251
Someone stole my bags.

517
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:27,518
I came here to be an actor.

518
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:31,060
I was staying with
this guy for a while.

519
00:49:31,084 --> 00:49:35,499
I had to leave in a hurry.
It was really messed up.

520
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:42,000
You hungry?

521
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,209
Okay, here you go.

522
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:20,542
So are you you clean? No.

523
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,475
No drugs.

524
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:24,060
No, sir.

525
00:50:24,084 --> 00:50:25,475
I mean, yeah.

526
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:26,893
Yes, I'm clean.

527
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:29,227
Good, good.

528
00:50:29,251 --> 00:50:31,499
Go ahead.

529
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:53,750
I'll get you cleaned up, okay?

530
00:50:54,209 --> 00:50:55,893
That would be nice.

531
00:50:55,917 --> 00:51:00,167
I haven't had a
shower in a while.

532
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,000
No, no!

533
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,475
Stop!

534
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:22,475
You can't have my phone,
no, no, no, no, no!

535
00:54:42,499 --> 00:54:45,475
I haven't heard
from you in weeks.

536
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:50,000
I am so scared of what
might be happening.

537
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:52,227
Ethan, please.

538
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:56,251
Please just tell me
that you're all right.

539
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:09,499
It's all been a lie
since I got here.

540
00:55:11,292 --> 00:55:15,499
I haven't been
posting the truth.

541
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:21,042
I have nothing.

542
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:24,810
I have fucking nothing.

543
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:37,792
Andy, Andy?

544
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:40,475
It's so good to see you.

545
00:57:24,499 --> 00:57:25,227
Oh my God.

546
00:57:25,251 --> 00:57:28,499
Ethan, is that you?

547
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:32,935
What the fuck happened to you?

548
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:40,499
What the fuck happened?

549
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,643
Oh my God.

550
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,475
I'm gonna help you, I promise.

551
00:57:44,499 --> 00:57:47,475
I'm gonna help you.

552
00:57:47,499 --> 00:57:49,625
Shit.

553
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:52,227
It's gonna be okay.

554
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:54,917
It's gonna be okay.

555
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:57,268
Morning.

556
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:57,851
Running already?

557
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:00,060
Imani, we are code
red this morning.

558
00:58:00,084 --> 00:58:06,643
We were notified that the new
intake has no identification,

559
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:10,060
but he'll be with an
old program graduate,

560
00:58:10,084 --> 00:58:13,893
actually my first
intake with my trainer.

561
00:58:13,917 --> 00:58:14,685
Oh.

562
00:58:14,709 --> 00:58:16,143
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

563
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:18,893
A real success story.

564
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:21,476
Makes like mega bucks
as a competitive gamer,

565
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,935
whatever that is.

566
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,185
Always the first
to help another.

567
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:37,601
Dear heavenly father,
I know that he is lost.

568
00:58:37,725 --> 00:58:40,285
But there is no "lost",
in your loving arms.

569
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:43,310
Take him back, dear Lord,
take him into your loving arms.

570
00:58:43,334 --> 00:58:47,750
Let him know, that
you are his savior.

571
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,774
Bring him back to you.

572
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:14,834
Ricky, an old friend.

573
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:19,227
Your name is Ethan Bates.

574
00:59:19,251 --> 00:59:22,084
Is that correct?

575
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:27,018
Ethan Bates, my name is Raymond.

576
00:59:27,042 --> 00:59:28,475
This is Imani.

577
00:59:28,499 --> 00:59:31,667
We're here to help you.

578
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:35,875
You understand?

579
00:59:36,499 --> 00:59:39,601
Did Ricky fill you
in on what we do?

580
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:41,768
Basically.

581
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:44,475
The only way to find him
is through you, dear God.

582
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:46,643
Dear God, bring
my son back to me.

583
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:47,559
Take him back into your arms.

584
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:54,102
Let him know that you are
the source of all things.

585
00:59:54,126 --> 00:59:56,475
That you are love, that
you are forgiveness.

586
00:59:56,499 --> 01:00:02,476
Cast out the devil with
his hands on my son.

587
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,935
Cast him out.

588
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:06,475
Dear Lord, I beg you.

589
01:00:06,499 --> 01:00:08,143
I beg you.

590
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:11,792
Give me my boy back, dear Lord.

591
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:15,435
I am your humble
and loving servant.

592
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:18,643
But dear Lord, I
am a mother too.

593
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:24,559
Let me know the
touch, the fellowship

594
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,476
of your child of God.

595
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:32,018
Dear lord, dear God,
dear lord, dear lord.

596
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:35,394
Take him, hold him.

597
01:00:35,418 --> 01:00:37,475
Dear lord, I trust you.

598
01:00:37,499 --> 01:00:40,435
I love you, I am yours.

599
01:00:40,459 --> 01:00:41,475
Amen.

600
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:10,976
When I was young,

601
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,435
jacked meant that primarily
adults who drank tea or coffee

602
01:01:17,459 --> 01:01:18,476
would still practice
in the church

603
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,976
and they would be
called Jack Mormons,

604
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,768
but it evolved and it changed.

605
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:26,601
And suddenly it
didn't just mean that.

606
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:30,475
It meant that anybody
who didn't go to church

607
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:36,475
or identified as
gay or different,

608
01:01:36,499 --> 01:01:37,476
that they were Jacked Mormons

609
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:42,084
and that there was
something wrong with them.

610
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:47,167
I thought I had
something wrong with me.

611
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:52,851
But I know that I didn't.

612
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:59,268
I had something special and
I wasn't a Jacked Mormon

613
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:01,935
because I knew how
to ask for help.

614
01:02:01,959 --> 01:02:03,643
And I'm proud I did.

615
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:08,499
The only thing that we can
do sometimes is ask for help.

616
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,102
There's nothing wrong with that.

617
01:02:12,126 --> 01:02:14,601
If anything, it's your strength

618
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:15,893
because there are
a lot of people

619
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:17,643
who don't know how
to ask for help.

620
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,685
And there's a lot of
people who go through life

621
01:02:20,709 --> 01:02:25,394
thinking that they don't have
to, or they don't need to,

622
01:02:25,418 --> 01:02:28,643
or they can't, and that's wrong.

623
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:31,185
Everybody should be
able to ask for help

624
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:33,768
and get to the help
that they need.

625
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:37,227
Everybody should be loved.

626
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:39,601
My name is Nathaniel
David Bates,

627
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:43,185
and that was based
off of my story.
