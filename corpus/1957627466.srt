1
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:23,064
Hear me, Odin.

2
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:25,784
The Old Father of the gods.

3
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:29,556
Summon the shadows of ages past.

4
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:35,190
When the thread-spinning
Norns ruled the fates of men.

5
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:42,138
Hear of a prince's vengeance
quenched at the fiery Gates of Hel.

6
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:45,857
A prince destined for Valhalla.

7
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,893
Hear me.

8
00:00:52,652 --> 00:01:00,092
<i>The North Atlantic</i>

9
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:17,116
<i>895 A.D.</i>

10
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,972
He's here!

11
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:45,046
He's here!

12
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:48,448
Mother! Father is here!

13
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:53,200
Never enter my
chambres without invitation!

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,469
The king, my lady! The king!

15
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:02,399
Come!

16
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,764
Odin brought him home.

17
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,800
Hail, Raven King!

18
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:35,627
Hail, war ravens!

19
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:39,813
Hail, my Lord!

20
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:44,910
War ravens, hail!

21
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,763
Hail, ring holders!

22
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,271
On my brother!

23
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:24,495
Come on!

24
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:43,082
Hail, King Aurvandill
War-Raven! Hail!

25
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:52,272
Like a battle dog
returning to his master.

26
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:56,191
I've come to be fettered
by my Queen's fair locks.

27
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:59,423
Ever I will be proud, my Lord.

28
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:03,659
Prince Amleth.

29
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:08,336
You have grown too old
to be greeted as a child.

30
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:15,227
Hail, Lord King!

31
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,735
But...

32
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:24,060
a father never grows too
old for a good smothering.

33
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:26,465
How I've missed you, my son!

34
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:32,798
Will your brother not
grace us with his presence?

35
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:36,563
Think none of Fjölnir.
He'll soon be with us.

36
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:08,744
This was worn around a
princess's neck when I found it.

37
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:13,012
But it was destined
for this prince.

38
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,834
Wear it always with my love.

39
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,801
Thank you, father!

40
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,474
My King!

41
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:25,803
- Fjölnir.
- Fjölnir is back.

42
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:30,240
The rough man is back.

43
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,810
Hail, Lord King!

44
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:49,724
Furnish this fierce heart and slayer of men
with some drink. And I might drink to him.

45
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:53,656
Accept my cup, kinsman!

46
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,212
Lady!

47
00:05:57,206 --> 00:06:02,769
Look how the Queen's cup grows
wet for more men than her king.

48
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,787
What metal might
buy a fragrant sip?

49
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:09,539
Sweet silver? Or hot iron?

50
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,244
Silence, dog!

51
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:16,312
By Freyr, you slander
your Lord and mistress...

52
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:20,765
Please, you brother!
'Tis but a jest! A jest!

53
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:26,654
Heimir keeps a foul tone, yet I
keep him as a deep, sworn friend.

54
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:29,554
Come, brother!

55
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:33,739
This one's more in need of
your safekeeping than myself.

56
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:37,204
Thorir.

57
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:43,911
Thorir! My son!

58
00:06:44,477 --> 00:06:49,448
- To my brother, the War-Raven!
- To the Kingdom of Hrafnsey!

59
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:52,091
- Skol!
- Skol!

60
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:41,620
The enemy has
a taste of my liver.

61
00:07:44,993 --> 00:07:46,291
Are you hurt?

62
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:51,491
Almost enough. Fjölnir
must not be my successor.

63
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,615
I watched his innocence tonight.

64
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:59,197
He must be awoken
to what awaits him.

65
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:01,057
He is a puppy.

66
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:04,650
Yes, the same age as my
grandfather when he took the throne.

67
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,490
That was different.

68
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,568
He had to kill his uncle first.

69
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:16,160
You have not seen
your Queen in a season.

70
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,398
Come.

71
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,417
Let me take you to our bed.

72
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,749
No.

73
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:37,218
Pray my luck-spirits send me to
many warfields after I defeat this wound.

74
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:43,623
I refuse to die in sickness nor live
the long life of a shameful greybeard.

75
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:46,950
I must die by the sword.

76
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:50,814
I will die in honour.

77
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:55,261
Fret not!

78
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:01,361
You will die in battle, my Lord!

79
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,708
The Gates of Valhalla
await you, I know it.

80
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:20,812
This is the same path I walked
with my father. And he with his.

81
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:25,283
Now, it is a hard path to walk.

82
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:55,271
Be not afraid, Amleth!

83
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,415
Do as I do.

84
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:20,420
Who barks?

85
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:24,193
Is it the wolves
of the High One?

86
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:30,333
Or is it the barking
of the village dogs?

87
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:34,644
Barking to me,
you two little dogs!

88
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:38,504
You two are in deep
need of knowledge.

89
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:43,101
To learn what it is to
live and die in honour.

90
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:49,673
To be in battle, slain. And in death,
rewarded by the Valkyries in graves.

91
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:55,146
The war you make will carry
you to the secret Gates of Valhalla.

92
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:01,514
You are dogs that
wish to become men.

93
00:12:04,046 --> 00:12:07,342
Prove you are not a dog!

94
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:16,541
Not only are you a
man, you dine like a king.

95
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:28,924
And you little cub.

96
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:30,963
What are you?

97
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:37,570
I smell a class of people.

98
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:47,047
And every passage, one should turn
his eye around. One should fly around.

99
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:50,287
For the foe might be
crouched with evil on the floor.

100
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:55,893
Why do you think that they should teach
you how to be wise enough? To be unfooled.

101
00:12:55,893 --> 00:13:01,626
- Wise enough to be unfooled.
- Tell me. How did Odin lose his eye?

102
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,828
To learn the secret
magic of women.

103
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:07,922
Never seek the secrets of
women, but they're helpless.

104
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:11,309
It is that women may
know the mysteries of men.

105
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:15,705
The Norns! They spin and
weave. And they're aware of Fate.

106
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,868
- Live in honour.
- Live in honour.

107
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:23,003
- Safeguard your family blood.
- Safeguard your family blood.

108
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,492
Do you know what that means,
Amleth, son of Aurvandill?

109
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:34,088
Should I fall by the enemy's sword, you
must avenge me or forever live in shame!

110
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:35,933
I will, father! I will!

111
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,205
My blade will not rest until the
time it drinks blood from his neck!

112
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:41,688
And live always without fear!

113
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:45,714
For your fate is set and
you cannot escape it.

114
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:47,736
Swear to it!

115
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:50,416
I swear!

116
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:36,385
This is the last tear you
will shed in weakness.

117
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:40,657
It will be given back
when most you need it.

118
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:46,739
Now, behold as a man!

119
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,043
Approach, Amleth!

120
00:14:56,067 --> 00:15:02,528
And in our blood,
behold the trees of kings.

121
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:50,007
Father!

122
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,071
Run! Run!

123
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:03,793
Run for where you
cowardice belongs!

124
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:01,624
You behold your brother's
gaze in amazement.

125
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:05,488
I knew well you would.

126
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,052
Pity you never paid a
bastard's-eyes heed before.

127
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:19,935
Now, behold how swiftly
your brother swings his sword!

128
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,596
Strike, brother!

129
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,794
Strike!

130
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:32,642
But know that bearing a stolen
ring makes no half-breed a king.

131
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:41,092
Soaked in my blood, which will soon
be sliding off your arm like a serpent.

132
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:46,459
Your kingdom will not last.

133
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:55,239
Let this misdeed
haunt your living nights.

134
00:18:55,589 --> 00:19:00,073
Till a flaming vengeance
scorches on your death.

135
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:04,805
Strike!

136
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:07,940
Strike!

137
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:10,671
To Valhalla!

138
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,405
King Aurvandill is dead!

139
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:30,193
- Long live King Fjölnir!
- Long live King Fjölnir!

140
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:34,248
Hail, Lord King!
Hail, Lord King!

141
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:41,066
Bring me the boy's head!

142
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:53,272
Disperse!

143
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:56,320
Go right!

144
00:19:56,932 --> 00:20:00,246
- I'm on it!
- Over there!

145
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,803
Cut it off!

146
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:26,131
I'll make it slow.

147
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:05,114
Hail, Fjölnir the Brotherless!

148
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:09,232
- Hail, King Fjölnir!
- Hail, King Fjölnir!

149
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:15,801
Hail, King Fjölnir!

150
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:20,171
King Fjölnir has
found himself a queen.

151
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:26,327
Fjölnir! Fjölnir! My Lord!

152
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:28,740
The boy...

153
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:31,280
The boy...

154
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:35,016
The boy is dead.

155
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,627
Dead in the sea.

156
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:41,516
Sank like a stone.

157
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:55,176
I will avenge you, father! I will
save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir!

158
00:21:55,176 --> 00:22:00,408
I will avenge you, father! I will
save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir!

159
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:06,145
I will avenge you, father! I will
save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir!

160
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:12,786
I will avenge you, father! I will
save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir!

161
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:28,686
<i>The Land of the Rus</i>

162
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:33,644
<i>Years Later</i>

163
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:35,059
The Father of War commands
you! Transform your skin, brothers!

164
00:25:35,772 --> 00:25:41,920
Slaughter-wolves,
Berserkers, become your fury!

165
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,116
To Valhalla!

166
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:37,816
What are you doing?
Come on! Come on!

167
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,316
Come on!

168
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,812
Get in there, you old...

169
00:28:57,531 --> 00:29:01,536
These savages make
for a fine chaplain.

170
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,411
And you Björnúlfur,
you did good.

171
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:08,007
Never better.

172
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:13,875
When we found you as a cub...

173
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:18,738
I knew then that you
have a heart of cold iron.

174
00:29:18,738 --> 00:29:20,554
Oh, weak!

175
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:24,453
I am the strong
one! The great one!

176
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:37,531
Mother!

177
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:41,883
Mother!

178
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:45,478
Mother!

179
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,808
Mother!

180
00:29:48,832 --> 00:29:51,488
Mother!

181
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:01,232
Mother!

182
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:05,081
Mother!

183
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:47,955
Play, you idiot! Play!

184
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:38,128
Crawl in shadows,
slayer of my people!

185
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:41,097
Hide!

186
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:45,809
Even though your
brother stole my eyes...

187
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:49,659
I see you.

188
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,933
I am no one's brother.

189
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:57,860
It is not enough to be
the man that never cries.

190
00:32:57,932 --> 00:33:00,348
Prince Amleth!

191
00:33:01,978 --> 00:33:06,560
The prince that
ran from his fate.

192
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:10,778
A beast that cares for no one.

193
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:15,453
A beast that runs tears
from eyes of men.

194
00:33:16,992 --> 00:33:22,911
Now, remember for whom
you shed your last teardrop.

195
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,482
Remember the oath
to right the wrong.

196
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:29,726
Remember the Raven King.

197
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:31,823
Remember.

198
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:34,000
Remember.

199
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,217
It contains the salty
ocean you must be upon.

200
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,601
To the edge of the World.

201
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:44,868
It feeds the freezing river
of hate that runs in my veins.

202
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:48,707
It will take you to an
island in the North.

203
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:52,984
Where will spring
a burning lake.

204
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:56,139
Bursting from a
black mountain's peak.

205
00:33:56,139 --> 00:34:00,462
There, I will drown
my father's killer!

206
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:05,331
Follow the vixen's tail to the
dwelling of the Ancient One.

207
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:10,578
To seek the fated sword
that matches your cruel rage.

208
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:14,544
Why are you giving
me fortunes, witch?

209
00:34:14,544 --> 00:34:18,441
Where your ashes end...

210
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:22,926
another will begin her journey.

211
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:26,032
A maiden king.

212
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:27,515
Release me.

213
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:31,253
You cannot escape from
Fate the Norns have spun.

214
00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:34,721
Now, be gone!

215
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:42,418
These slaves will go to Uppsala.

216
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:46,817
Those to the market in Kiev.

217
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,870
Those, send them
to Constantinople.

218
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,914
And these strong ones...

219
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:59,759
will make it all the way
to Fjölnir's post in Iceland.

220
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:03,417
Who is this Fjölnir?

221
00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:05,108
Fjölnir the Brotherless.

222
00:35:05,108 --> 00:35:11,752
He's so called after he killed his brother.
The disgraced King Aurvandill War-Raven.

223
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:14,027
I know of him.

224
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:18,852
Why are these slaves bound
for Iceland? Fjölnir rules Hrafnsey.

225
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:23,265
He fled to the backwater
frontier with his wife and son.

226
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:27,562
After King Harald of
Norway took his kingdom.

227
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:31,861
Fjölnir killed his brother for
nothing. Now he's a sheep farmer.

228
00:35:45,692 --> 00:35:48,172
Father!

229
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,840
Worry not.

230
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:17,108
When I meet your owner, I will
thank him for the warmth you gave me.

231
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:40,457
Bring those two ropes.

232
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:05,300
Your sheeps' clothing does
not disguise you, Northman.

233
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:08,253
What sent you, spell speaker?

234
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:11,467
Who wants to be a slave?

235
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,949
Hide your cunning.

236
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,618
Show the shepherd
you are a sheep.

237
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:20,632
I will show the
shepherd his death.

238
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,209
Hold on!

239
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:32,726
Come here!

240
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:37,497
Stay still!

241
00:38:37,497 --> 00:38:39,890
Hold onto my hand!

242
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:42,606
I hold you!

243
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:29,401
<i>Draugr</i>

244
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:50,472
I will avenge you, father! I will
save you, mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir!

245
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:07,445
<i>Iceland</i>

246
00:40:15,315 --> 00:40:17,800
To the shore!

247
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,031
Get up and try to bend.

248
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:25,674
There!

249
00:40:32,486 --> 00:40:33,776
Move!

250
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:47,239
Let him rot!

251
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,667
The seagulls will eat
him. They are hungry.

252
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,188
Move, slave!

253
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:31,370
Why would you stow away
to such a hellish place?

254
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,138
This ground harbours evil.

255
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,718
My fate has brought me here.

256
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,640
To find what was stolen from me.

257
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,663
And what is that?

258
00:41:42,181 --> 00:41:46,478
A mother. A father. A kingdom.

259
00:41:47,977 --> 00:41:49,914
This is your kingdom?

260
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:55,214
The traitor who stole my kingdom fled
here when another king took it from him.

261
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:58,048
I will leave when I
am done with him.

262
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:02,411
I am Olga of the Birch Forest.

263
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,017
Tonight, I vow to
escape this island.

264
00:42:06,017 --> 00:42:08,645
Then you must face many foes.

265
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:11,251
As do you.

266
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:14,705
But you'll face them alone.

267
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:19,397
Your strength
breaks men's bones.

268
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:22,462
I have the cunning
to break their minds.

269
00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:24,945
You two, hold your traps!

270
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:27,361
Walk off!

271
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,000
- Why are we doing this?
- What?

272
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,002
- This.
- What?

273
00:42:57,002 --> 00:42:59,365
It is slave work.

274
00:42:59,365 --> 00:43:01,071
You are the chieftain.

275
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:05,436
It is your temple, and I'm
the heir to this holy chiefdom.

276
00:43:05,436 --> 00:43:11,420
No man knows if he will set a place that
makes you turn as a king or as a slave.

277
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,930
Best to be prepared for both.

278
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:20,369
And to stave off the latter, the least you can do
is show your slaves you're as strong as they are.

279
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:24,916
But... no one is watching us.

280
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,934
Go fetch you some
weed. Think on what I said.

281
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:32,062
Keep the shield off that man!

282
00:43:32,062 --> 00:43:36,336
- Hold on!
- We will see.

283
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:41,572
No! No!

284
00:43:45,161 --> 00:43:47,498
Fjölnir, my Lord!

285
00:43:49,955 --> 00:43:52,772
Your shipment is here.

286
00:43:54,144 --> 00:43:56,636
Come on! Show me!

287
00:43:57,124 --> 00:44:00,765
- Where is the rest of them?
- Get on your feet!

288
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:03,262
On your feet, slaves!

289
00:44:03,262 --> 00:44:05,656
Now off, bastards!

290
00:44:08,635 --> 00:44:10,454
Pity those.

291
00:44:10,454 --> 00:44:12,873
They can't stand.

292
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:19,593
They won't last for winter.

293
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:23,416
Sell all of them.

294
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,779
Let me see this one.

295
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:53,746
We've kept you to us.

296
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:07,199
I'm not impressed.

297
00:45:08,345 --> 00:45:10,688
His stench.

298
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:17,530
Never look me in the eye, slave!

299
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:24,024
Well, I wonder what they call a
beast like you in the Land of Rus.

300
00:45:26,597 --> 00:45:31,603
I am Björnúlfur.

301
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:36,881
By name alone, you can
tell he's as strong as a bear.

302
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:45,825
But if you are as untrustworthy as a
wolf, I swear I'll put you down myself.

303
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,167
We'll keep this one.

304
00:45:52,018 --> 00:45:54,470
The rest can go.

305
00:45:56,168 --> 00:46:00,013
But mother needs two in the
kitchen and one for the laundry.

306
00:46:00,013 --> 00:46:01,092
Move!

307
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,867
- And two males for the harvest.
- Well.

308
00:46:03,867 --> 00:46:07,358
These two for the kitchen.
And that for laundry.

309
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:10,558
And choose two males for fields.

310
00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:14,337
And her too.

311
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,197
Make her arms white.

312
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:21,858
And her hair long.

313
00:46:42,328 --> 00:46:46,212
Land climb-out, huh? Bear-Wolf!

314
00:46:46,707 --> 00:46:53,733
Even if you did escape this farm, you'll only
be a target for the blue foxes in so case.

315
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:57,858
This island is a barren waste.

316
00:46:57,957 --> 00:47:00,451
You best bring
yourselves on to sleep.

317
00:47:48,915 --> 00:47:52,389
Cut! Cut! Cut!

318
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,031
Thieving demon witch!

319
00:48:10,509 --> 00:48:12,960
Away! Away!

320
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:17,715
Away with you!

321
00:48:18,714 --> 00:48:21,094
Away! Be gone!

322
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:27,111
Be gone!

323
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,512
I will avenge you, father!

324
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,758
I will save you, mother!

325
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:38,256
I will kill you, Fjölnir!

326
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:46,761
Pull! Go!

327
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,580
Go take a pee!

328
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:32,383
There!

329
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:48,138
Stop there!

330
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:10,156
You! Get on with it!
On with you, now!

331
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,983
Out of your wits?

332
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,370
Turn around!

333
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,348
Shut the door!

334
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,301
Did you find it?

335
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:04,694
What you lost.

336
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:07,933
In the house the
day you were there.

337
00:51:09,492 --> 00:51:11,696
That.

338
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:14,187
And more.

339
00:51:20,683 --> 00:51:23,073
It's a nightmare.

340
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:27,893
Then you must wake up.

341
00:51:28,675 --> 00:51:31,134
Their nightmare.

342
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:34,005
You!

343
00:51:34,005 --> 00:51:37,336
You! Move now! You come with us!

344
00:51:38,246 --> 00:51:40,670
You don't belong here.

345
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:42,857
Fjölnir wants you close.

346
00:51:42,997 --> 00:51:46,622
If you lose me, will you
come look for me too?

347
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:49,652
- Will you?
- You!

348
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,956
Sit, Amleth! Son of Aurvandill.

349
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:50,181
Did your haunting
friend tell you of me?

350
00:53:52,077 --> 00:53:54,254
No.

351
00:53:56,305 --> 00:53:59,175
One was more talkative.

352
00:54:02,248 --> 00:54:04,651
Your old fool.

353
00:54:06,478 --> 00:54:09,048
Heimir.

354
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,988
He speaks of days past.

355
00:54:12,738 --> 00:54:15,245
And days yet to come.

356
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:21,069
Fjölnir cut out his tongue,

357
00:54:21,795 --> 00:54:24,193
plucked out his eyes,

358
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:26,641
before killing him.

359
00:54:28,383 --> 00:54:31,565
But I made him once anew.

360
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:36,504
Kind friend.

361
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:38,563
Now, they will avenge you too.

362
00:54:38,563 --> 00:54:41,805
I fear you must address me.

363
00:54:41,805 --> 00:54:45,647
Alas, I made him no new ears.

364
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:49,285
They also met
with Fjölnir's blade.

365
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,620
Enough!

366
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,431
You know why I've come.

367
00:54:52,431 --> 00:54:56,720
You are still a beast
cloaked in man flesh.

368
00:54:56,744 --> 00:55:00,554
- Speak, witch!
- So be it, slave!

369
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:21,994
The Wandering Prophet!

370
00:55:27,767 --> 00:55:30,290
Wake now...

371
00:55:31,735 --> 00:55:34,452
from your murder!

372
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,725
Hear me!

373
00:55:54,725 --> 00:55:56,506
Heimir!

374
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:59,019
He's come!

375
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:05,917
Hello, puppy!

376
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:11,392
I seek the weapon the Norns
of Fate chose for my revenge.

377
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:14,659
Hear me.

378
00:56:14,749 --> 00:56:22,991
Forged by the deadliest wasps ever
did crawl from under a worm's belly.

379
00:56:23,438 --> 00:56:29,664
A sword of the
most secret rare iron.

380
00:56:30,177 --> 00:56:36,215
Wound with bones with a locking
handle; weightless in its owner's hand.

381
00:56:36,215 --> 00:56:43,865
It's like a dragon's fang. Its bite can
never be dulled. Never broken or bent.

382
00:56:43,865 --> 00:56:47,908
Its blade could only be
pointed in human blood.

383
00:56:49,855 --> 00:56:54,127
It is in a battlefield
like no other.

384
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:56,247
Its name...

385
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,708
Draugr.

386
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:01,229
No longer is dead.

387
00:57:05,186 --> 00:57:07,606
It is fated.

388
00:57:20,672 --> 00:57:25,215
Yet difficult is the
sword's nature.

389
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,176
For it can only be
unsheathed in the dark of night.

390
00:57:30,226 --> 00:57:32,669
Or else at Hel's Black Gates.

391
00:57:32,669 --> 00:57:37,346
For Gates of Hel, there
will my sword be just.

392
00:57:38,005 --> 00:57:41,875
I will enjoy feeding Draugr
to an everlasting night.

393
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,669
And shall you also enjoy the
moment when you must choose

394
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:50,383
between kindness for your
kin, or hate for your enemies.

395
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,773
It is nothing.

396
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:55,867
My heart knows only revenge.

397
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,571
Show it to me.

398
00:57:59,571 --> 00:58:05,091
You must make a visitation to
Draugr's owner; the Mount Dweller.

399
00:58:11,662 --> 00:58:15,835
Mark well the full moon's light.

400
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:20,267
For shadows are
not hospitable hosts.

401
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:07,828
Mark well the full moon's light!

402
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:16,709
Thorir will choose
the strongest.

403
01:03:16,738 --> 01:03:21,624
The more it will prove that Hákon
Ironbeard's men are born of mud and water.

404
01:03:21,624 --> 01:03:23,600
Yeah.

405
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,382
Mud will be all that
remains of them.

406
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:30,202
Rakki!

407
01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:45,103
Rakki!

408
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,416
Rakki.

409
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:00,085
Take Rakki home.

410
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:03,545
And you two, it's nearly
dawn, go to your beds.

411
01:04:03,545 --> 01:04:06,540
- Yes, my Lord.
- Rakki!

412
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:18,267
Wake! You!

413
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:21,770
Fetch her. You know the one.

414
01:04:24,213 --> 01:04:27,989
Wake up, Olga! Wake
up. Get on your feet.

415
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:38,124
The hair of a Valkyrie.

416
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:42,409
My sumptuous Slav bitch.

417
01:04:51,422 --> 01:04:53,636
Don't clean a whore!

418
01:04:57,851 --> 01:05:02,448
You'll take care of her. Or
you'll both be dead in the ground.

419
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:22,097
Thank the Norns that the
woman tied is the only blood

420
01:05:22,097 --> 01:05:26,735
that runs in your
house tonight, coward!

421
01:05:28,749 --> 01:05:31,217
I am a fool.

422
01:05:31,217 --> 01:05:36,300
It was foretold that I would slay
my father's killer in a burning lake.

423
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,555
Until that day comes...

424
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:43,007
I will torment the man
who made my life hell.

425
01:05:44,433 --> 01:05:47,506
Now sleep well, night blades!

426
01:05:47,814 --> 01:05:51,646
Yes. We thirst for vengeance.

427
01:05:52,455 --> 01:05:55,724
But we cannot escape our fates.

428
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:10,175
Put them in line! Come on!

429
01:06:13,813 --> 01:06:16,343
- Wait!
- Don't cover it up!

430
01:06:19,253 --> 01:06:21,359
Where are they taking us?

431
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,518
Something about
the chieftain's feast.

432
01:06:24,518 --> 01:06:27,856
Last night, I saw him with you.

433
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:36,781
Then you know a Fjölnir's touch won't
linger on me when I leave this island.

434
01:06:36,781 --> 01:06:39,483
You marked him well.

435
01:06:39,483 --> 01:06:43,519
I have found the cold iron
that will stand him down.

436
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,558
- When will you do it?
- When I must.

437
01:06:48,558 --> 01:06:53,748
For now, I will haunt this farm like a
hungry corpse that's run from the grave.

438
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:59,342
- Fjölnir thinks Amleth is long dead.
- Yes, but what of your mother?

439
01:06:59,342 --> 01:07:02,477
She will revel in
Fjölnir's anguish.

440
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:05,558
She only feigns her
love to protect the child.

441
01:07:05,558 --> 01:07:10,447
- Won't she...
- When I free her, I will bring the boy if I must.

442
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:14,643
- They'll move me back into the kitchen.
- Our plan's worth the wait.

443
01:07:14,643 --> 01:07:18,112
- Go.
- Björnúlfur, move!

444
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:26,008
- You! To the back!
- Hurry!

445
01:07:30,285 --> 01:07:34,108
Thorir, my Lord,
we're missing one man.

446
01:07:35,602 --> 01:07:38,120
This is for a Sunday party.

447
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,570
I'm not a child,
my hair is my own.

448
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:45,371
I know grown men who need
a woman to tame their hair.

449
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:46,868
Put them in line!

450
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:51,515
You can celebrate after the
game, slave. Move right away!

451
01:07:52,845 --> 01:07:55,405
My Lord!

452
01:07:56,568 --> 01:07:59,005
Thorir, my Lord!

453
01:08:04,703 --> 01:08:07,628
Can you fight, slave?

454
01:08:08,408 --> 01:08:11,245
Look me in the eye, slave.

455
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,060
I asked: do you
know how to fight?

456
01:08:39,576 --> 01:08:41,944
What's this noise?

457
01:08:42,362 --> 01:08:46,089
Never seen a "knattra" before?

458
01:08:47,992 --> 01:08:51,039
By nightfall, you'll
have seen enough of it.

459
01:09:09,059 --> 01:09:11,576
Play to blood!

460
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:07,471
Throw it here!

461
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,857
Shame on you, foolish man!

462
01:10:30,857 --> 01:10:33,801
We need more men!

463
01:10:48,939 --> 01:10:51,600
No! No!

464
01:11:21,022 --> 01:11:23,333
- Gunnar!
- No!

465
01:11:23,759 --> 01:11:25,592
Halt the game! Halt it now!

466
01:11:25,592 --> 01:11:27,655
Don't touch him!

467
01:11:27,655 --> 01:11:29,969
- Gunnar!
- Halt the game!

468
01:11:29,969 --> 01:11:32,135
- Step back, man!
- Gunnar!

469
01:11:32,135 --> 01:11:34,776
- Goodbye, child!
- No!

470
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:53,760
Fjölnir, call him!

471
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,547
- Gunnar! Gunnar!
- Wake up!

472
01:11:56,547 --> 01:12:00,065
Stupid child! Wake up!

473
01:12:00,365 --> 01:12:02,852
- Gunnar! Gunnar!
- Gunnar!

474
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:06,427
Wake up! Wake up,
Gunnar! Wake up!

475
01:12:06,427 --> 01:12:08,942
Gunnar! Gunnar!

476
01:12:08,942 --> 01:12:12,639
Wake up! Wake up!

477
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:17,549
Wake up!

478
01:12:20,487 --> 01:12:23,037
Did we win?

479
01:12:24,197 --> 01:12:27,983
Spoken like a
true chieftain's son!

480
01:12:29,134 --> 01:12:33,056
- Brave boy!
- You're brave, Gunnar!

481
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,565
You!

482
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,180
This way.

483
01:13:56,614 --> 01:14:00,767
You showed yourself
brave and loyal.

484
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:05,992
When we return to the farm, certain
privileges will be granted to you.

485
01:14:05,992 --> 01:14:11,571
Your work will be less burdensome.
You will command others' burden.

486
01:14:11,571 --> 01:14:13,747
And Björnúlfur...

487
01:14:14,923 --> 01:14:19,093
As a reward for winning us the game,
I'll let you choose a woman for yourself.

488
01:14:19,093 --> 01:14:22,425
Even that Slav bitch
I've seen you eye.

489
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:25,717
Father's fond of her too.

490
01:14:25,785 --> 01:14:28,279
Unyielding.

491
01:14:35,528 --> 01:14:39,915
But know that we will
never make you a free man.

492
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:44,856
The stench of a low-point
slave cannot escape him.

493
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,953
Yes.

494
01:14:48,953 --> 01:14:51,440
Thank you.

495
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:59,568
We'll miss you
cleaning the shithouse.

496
01:15:00,971 --> 01:15:03,624
To my son, Gunnar!

497
01:15:03,992 --> 01:15:07,636
- Skol!
- Skol!

498
01:15:38,348 --> 01:15:40,726
Olga!

499
01:15:49,919 --> 01:15:52,495
You've found me.

500
01:15:54,798 --> 01:15:57,196
Were you lost?

501
01:15:58,474 --> 01:16:01,246
Only if you were
searching for me.

502
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:21,585
Mother Soil, hear
your daughter's prayer.

503
01:16:21,585 --> 01:16:27,319
Show me the way to
destroy our enslavers.

504
01:16:27,319 --> 01:16:33,043
And free my love from
his fire and sorrow.

505
01:16:33,043 --> 01:16:35,820
What did you do?

506
01:16:37,962 --> 01:16:42,361
Here, where the threads
of Fate bound us together.

507
01:16:42,877 --> 01:16:47,579
Embraced beneath the trees.
Here, I speak with the Earth.

508
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,857
What did she tell you?

509
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:00,202
Help to reach your mother.

510
01:17:00,978 --> 01:17:05,869
My Earth magic will stoke
the flames of your sword.

511
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:21,441
Tomorrow night, you and I...

512
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:25,442
will begin this nightmare.

513
01:17:26,216 --> 01:17:30,359
And bring Fjölnir's life to chaos.

514
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:38,069
<i>The Night Blade Feeds</i>

515
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:40,647
You finished.

516
01:17:43,507 --> 01:17:45,625
Back to the stables.

517
01:17:54,828 --> 01:17:56,917
You!

518
01:18:12,103 --> 01:18:14,765
The servants of Freyr.

519
01:18:15,026 --> 01:18:18,245
Lay them before our Lord's seat.

520
01:19:01,719 --> 01:19:04,134
You swan!

521
01:19:18,076 --> 01:19:23,665
- Fear not! You're the first of many!
- Please!

522
01:19:27,091 --> 01:19:30,202
Oh, I will find who did this!

523
01:19:30,202 --> 01:19:34,566
I will find them and I
will tear out their eyes!

524
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:37,220
And I will tear
out their tongues!

525
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:41,762
They will all sob in Hell!

526
01:19:43,354 --> 01:19:48,376
Look, father! Look what's
been done to my brave friends!

527
01:19:48,376 --> 01:19:52,157
Christian monsters! Monsters!

528
01:19:52,838 --> 01:19:54,282
Monsters!

529
01:19:54,282 --> 01:19:57,073
You bear! Did you do this?

530
01:19:57,073 --> 01:19:59,725
Answer me! Answer me!

531
01:20:00,702 --> 01:20:03,303
- Stop this!
- Son!

532
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:07,534
Regain your calm!

533
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,623
They were good boys.

534
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:19,889
By Freyr, we will avenge them.

535
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:23,257
Take him away.

536
01:20:25,912 --> 01:20:28,043
Is Thorir right?

537
01:20:28,043 --> 01:20:31,135
Could it be the
Christian swines?

538
01:20:31,949 --> 01:20:35,997
Their god is a corpse
nailed to a tree.

539
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:38,665
For what?

540
01:20:39,336 --> 01:20:41,804
These boys never touched them.

541
01:20:41,804 --> 01:20:44,397
And how might they
find the weapons?

542
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,063
No.

543
01:21:06,063 --> 01:21:09,732
These wounds
are not of our world.

544
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:19,174
This distempered
spirit will ride again.

545
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:23,160
It wheels a hungry blade.

546
01:21:25,243 --> 01:21:28,878
Go! I will prepare a sacrifice.

547
01:21:31,948 --> 01:21:34,491
On with you!

548
01:21:34,491 --> 01:21:37,627
Bloodthirsty Christians!

549
01:21:37,886 --> 01:21:40,037
Do as you are told!

550
01:21:41,386 --> 01:21:43,772
Go!

551
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,226
The mushrooms, I got them.

552
01:21:47,226 --> 01:21:51,152
Not tonight. The spirits will
invade, there's still more blood.

553
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:26,281
Black spirit, abate!

554
01:22:26,635 --> 01:22:30,129
Bear this offering
to your mistress!

555
01:22:30,129 --> 01:22:34,106
And she's your rageful corpse.

556
01:22:52,235 --> 01:22:54,091
- Rakki!
- Rakki!

557
01:22:54,091 --> 01:22:56,849
- What is it, Rakki?
- Rakki!

558
01:22:56,849 --> 01:23:00,120
Sit down, Rakki! Rakki!

559
01:23:04,962 --> 01:23:06,530
Rakki!

560
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:07,918
Rakki!

561
01:23:47,768 --> 01:23:50,258
Free him.

562
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:05,267
Freyr, he seemed he's chosen for himself.
He was deemed to fit for sacrifice.

563
01:24:05,923 --> 01:24:09,650
- Blinded by his blood.
- Let's hope his hunger has subsided.

564
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:12,746
This is not the work of my God.

565
01:24:14,491 --> 01:24:17,449
This is truly sorcery.

566
01:24:19,526 --> 01:24:27,011
Tonight, you will be armed to defend
the farm, for this is also your home.

567
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:29,544
How can we trust
them to protect us?

568
01:24:29,544 --> 01:24:30,641
There, you dog!

569
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:35,681
Your father does not want an uprising by
emboldened slaves. Do not doubt his wisdom!

570
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:38,273
Go!

571
01:24:55,576 --> 01:24:58,170
Black dreams, rise!

572
01:25:00,706 --> 01:25:04,937
Aye, slaves! Hold
onto your sticks!

573
01:25:06,522 --> 01:25:11,547
You're not fending off
the demon with that thing.

574
01:25:14,467 --> 01:25:16,846
Here!

575
01:25:29,272 --> 01:25:30,766
Hungry?

576
01:25:33,275 --> 01:25:36,891
Tonight, you are the food!

577
01:25:51,937 --> 01:25:54,050
Go get some air.

578
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:56,606
I'll finish here.

579
01:25:57,354 --> 01:25:59,757
Go on!

580
01:27:19,841 --> 01:27:23,832
Don't touch them!
Don't look in their eyes!

581
01:27:24,058 --> 01:27:29,948
The night spirits have entered
their skulls and are riding their minds!

582
01:27:30,755 --> 01:27:34,274
Thorir, here! I see it!

583
01:27:35,071 --> 01:27:37,608
Be gone!

584
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:42,165
Tonight before dawn.

585
01:28:34,452 --> 01:28:36,734
Father.

586
01:28:45,727 --> 01:28:48,104
Leave me.

587
01:29:25,698 --> 01:29:27,617
Your sword is long!

588
01:29:27,617 --> 01:29:29,908
Stop your jest.

589
01:29:35,474 --> 01:29:37,784
I am your son.

590
01:29:40,702 --> 01:29:43,285
Amleth?

591
01:29:47,869 --> 01:29:50,942
You live still?

592
01:29:51,337 --> 01:29:53,780
A life of death.

593
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:59,361
It is sworn to survive
to this moment.

594
01:29:59,361 --> 01:30:02,796
Tomorrow, I shall finish
my deeds and honour.

595
01:30:03,543 --> 01:30:07,221
Only then when I discover
whether living is to my like.

596
01:30:07,429 --> 01:30:11,094
- You're your mother's son.
- And my father's.

597
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:15,320
I've come to avenge
King Aurvandill.

598
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,856
And choke my traitorous
uncle in his death blood.

599
01:30:19,856 --> 01:30:22,140
And free you.

600
01:30:24,345 --> 01:30:28,222
I see you have inherited
your father's simpleness.

601
01:30:30,451 --> 01:30:32,104
What say you?

602
01:30:32,104 --> 01:30:35,006
I never mourned him.

603
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:37,867
You were his Queen.

604
01:30:38,644 --> 01:30:42,702
Your father beat me.

605
01:30:43,726 --> 01:30:46,131
Because I bore him a son.

606
01:30:47,137 --> 01:30:48,556
No.

607
01:30:48,556 --> 01:30:52,687
His affections were only for
silver and rutting his whores.

608
01:30:52,687 --> 01:30:56,050
I know not if he had
heart enough to love you.

609
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,697
- Silence!
- He was a coward feigning to be a king.

610
01:30:59,697 --> 01:31:03,512
He was nothing. He was just
another proud lusting slave.

611
01:31:03,512 --> 01:31:05,799
Hold your tongue!

612
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:09,111
You spit in the face
of your dead husband!

613
01:31:09,111 --> 01:31:11,679
He had this brother!

614
01:31:11,703 --> 01:31:14,700
His fine brother!

615
01:31:17,635 --> 01:31:22,043
The bastard has no shame
of himself. Nor his trade.

616
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:25,669
Your uncle loved me.
He knew well my past.

617
01:31:30,262 --> 01:31:32,854
Amleth.

618
01:31:33,723 --> 01:31:37,643
Even now, you believe the
fairy tale I told you was true?

619
01:31:37,643 --> 01:31:42,541
"A noble bride hailing
from the Land of Brittany."

620
01:31:43,327 --> 01:31:47,160
I never began as his bride.

621
01:31:50,531 --> 01:31:57,329
How easily we all become princesses again
when the beasts take us for their wives!

622
01:31:59,954 --> 01:32:01,674
Yes.

623
01:32:01,674 --> 01:32:04,468
You were forced
upon your mother.

624
01:32:04,468 --> 01:32:08,399
Gunnar was received
freely with love.

625
01:32:08,854 --> 01:32:10,865
No.

626
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:13,558
And now hear this.

627
01:32:13,558 --> 01:32:21,329
It was I who begged on my knees
for Fjölnir to kill King Aurvandill.

628
01:32:21,355 --> 01:32:27,384
I pressed my lips on
his strong sweet hand.

629
01:32:28,207 --> 01:32:30,680
And kissed it.

630
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,505
And I begged.

631
01:32:35,404 --> 01:32:38,430
So that this day
would never come.

632
01:32:38,756 --> 01:32:44,057
Fjölnir ordered your death along
with your own mother's blessing.

633
01:32:47,204 --> 01:32:49,809
But I saw it.

634
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:54,019
I saw Fjölnir carrying you away.

635
01:32:54,411 --> 01:32:57,480
- Screaming.
- Screaming?

636
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:00,988
- I was laughing.
- Lies!

637
01:33:03,191 --> 01:33:06,122
Now that you're
here, what will you do?

638
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:10,024
I should kill you and
all that is dear to you.

639
01:33:10,024 --> 01:33:16,372
But you love me. A son loves his
mother and a mother loves her son.

640
01:33:18,228 --> 01:33:21,950
And you saved your
brother's life. You...

641
01:33:23,018 --> 01:33:26,201
You... love!

642
01:33:28,495 --> 01:33:30,904
You...

643
01:33:30,904 --> 01:33:33,461
love!

644
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:37,728
None but me knows who you are.

645
01:33:38,885 --> 01:33:41,510
And you're so up for revenge.

646
01:33:42,344 --> 01:33:46,130
Child born for savagery.

647
01:33:47,017 --> 01:33:49,488
If you kill Fjölnir.

648
01:33:49,488 --> 01:33:52,480
If you kill Thorir.

649
01:33:53,043 --> 01:33:58,678
And if you're so untamed
just to kill my Gunnar.

650
01:34:01,505 --> 01:34:05,126
You will be my new king.

651
01:34:05,126 --> 01:34:07,799
And together...

652
01:34:07,799 --> 01:34:10,336
we can rule.

653
01:34:20,934 --> 01:34:22,091
Bitch!

654
01:34:22,091 --> 01:34:25,990
Your taste and your
mind reek of your father!

655
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:29,396
- You should have joined him in death!
- Your words are poison!

656
01:34:29,396 --> 01:34:31,873
I am your death!

657
01:35:08,486 --> 01:35:11,075
Where is your mother?

658
01:35:11,234 --> 01:35:13,303
Tell me.

659
01:35:13,303 --> 01:35:15,778
Where?

660
01:35:15,844 --> 01:35:18,357
She is as evil as Fjölnir!

661
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:22,305
I will destroy him
and all that she loves!

662
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:25,791
I will be an ice storm
of iron and steel!

663
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:28,463
I will have my vengeance!

664
01:35:28,713 --> 01:35:31,061
And more!

665
01:35:31,331 --> 01:35:33,993
But what must we do now?

666
01:35:38,263 --> 01:35:40,613
I must head to the hills.

667
01:35:40,613 --> 01:35:43,905
My mother discovered who
I am. And soon everyone.

668
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:46,394
- I'll go with you.
- No.

669
01:35:46,573 --> 01:35:50,691
They don't know you're part of
this. Tomorrow, they will hunt for me.

670
01:35:50,691 --> 01:35:53,094
Why?

671
01:35:55,901 --> 01:35:58,209
Have you killed her?

672
01:35:58,209 --> 01:36:02,019
I will not kill a
woman. Not even her.

673
01:36:02,738 --> 01:36:05,418
Thorir medicined my mad fury.

674
01:36:05,732 --> 01:36:08,018
Good riddance.

675
01:36:08,595 --> 01:36:12,313
Tomorrow night, you
will return to kill Fjölnir?

676
01:36:12,313 --> 01:36:15,217
If the Norns of Fate allow it.

677
01:36:15,217 --> 01:36:19,311
Whatever happens
tomorrow, be ready to run.

678
01:37:00,627 --> 01:37:02,500
His heart...

679
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,900
His...

680
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:08,246
His heart... He's taken his heart!

681
01:37:11,476 --> 01:37:14,061
What demon is this?

682
01:37:15,796 --> 01:37:22,141
What demon eats the
hearts of brave young men?

683
01:37:23,419 --> 01:37:26,794
Freyr, do you hear me?

684
01:37:26,794 --> 01:37:31,235
Behave! Be a man in
front of your inferiors!

685
01:37:31,235 --> 01:37:34,149
There's no evil spirit here!

686
01:37:34,756 --> 01:37:38,125
I told you! I told you!

687
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:41,154
It is my cursed son Amleth!

688
01:37:41,853 --> 01:37:44,493
But we lost him as a boy.

689
01:37:44,493 --> 01:37:47,802
You must believe me! He's here!

690
01:37:48,315 --> 01:37:51,085
The prodigy of Aurvandill lives still!

691
01:37:51,085 --> 01:37:56,732
I fear he was led here by the
raven spirit... of your dead brother.

692
01:37:56,767 --> 01:37:59,404
- It's impossible.
- Think!

693
01:37:59,404 --> 01:38:03,902
He's killed your men! He's
murdered your eldest son!

694
01:38:03,902 --> 01:38:10,235
And he will not rest till you crawl on the
ground and our Gunnar is slain beside you.

695
01:38:10,235 --> 01:38:12,696
It is Amleth!

696
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:18,524
No god can help
you with this task!

697
01:38:18,524 --> 01:38:23,004
You must discover my son
and kill him with your own hands!

698
01:38:23,528 --> 01:38:28,319
Let my words be the
whetstone for your biting rage!

699
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:32,099
For the mischief of last night
was not the work of one man.

700
01:38:32,099 --> 01:38:35,803
Find the slaves
who allied with him.

701
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:39,251
Find them!

702
01:38:40,203 --> 01:38:41,759
On your knees!

703
01:38:41,759 --> 01:38:43,826
Down, will you!

704
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,511
Down, will you!

705
01:38:54,033 --> 01:39:00,561
I know not or care not if a
slave aided in the death of my son.

706
01:39:01,832 --> 01:39:07,948
But this is the end you will all
meet if you speak not what you knew.

707
01:39:08,257 --> 01:39:10,841
No?

708
01:39:16,101 --> 01:39:19,677
I see you are no longer
afraid of a woman's blood!

709
01:39:19,677 --> 01:39:23,051
You! Of course, it is you!

710
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,326
Fjölnir!

711
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:27,338
Leave her alone!

712
01:39:27,338 --> 01:39:32,165
I offer you your son's heart
in exchange for her life!

713
01:39:38,862 --> 01:39:41,626
I am Amleth the Bear-Wolf!

714
01:39:41,626 --> 01:39:45,130
Son of King
Aurvandill War-Raven!

715
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:50,143
And I am his vengeance!

716
01:39:50,143 --> 01:39:51,665
Kill him!

717
01:39:51,665 --> 01:39:55,645
- Bring him to me!
- Kill him!

718
01:39:55,645 --> 01:39:57,385
He's mine!

719
01:41:16,223 --> 01:41:18,694
In the end...

720
01:41:19,204 --> 01:41:22,052
you're just like your father.

721
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:27,228
Evil begets evil.

722
01:41:30,944 --> 01:41:34,807
How do you know
it's your son's heart?

723
01:41:35,566 --> 01:41:40,188
And not the heart of a rabid
dog you killed two nights ago?

724
01:41:44,603 --> 01:41:47,134
Where is it?

725
01:41:52,017 --> 01:41:54,602
You can't... can't kill me.

726
01:41:55,859 --> 01:41:58,861
Even if you were to
strike me with your sword.

727
01:41:59,315 --> 01:42:01,744
It is not the point.

728
01:42:02,852 --> 01:42:05,285
It is not my time.

729
01:42:05,725 --> 01:42:08,203
I will die in battle.

730
01:42:09,003 --> 01:42:11,619
Where's my son's heart?

731
01:42:17,714 --> 01:42:23,906
Odin the Old Father will
vanquish your god of erections.

732
01:42:24,648 --> 01:42:27,138
- Fear him!
- Silence!

733
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:31,295
I will come back for your heart.

734
01:42:32,008 --> 01:42:35,138
And your mother
and I will eat it.

735
01:43:45,409 --> 01:43:54,040
Odin, let a Valkyrie, your warrior
maiden follow me to your shining gates.

736
01:44:02,173 --> 01:44:05,634
I see my father and mother!

737
01:44:08,407 --> 01:44:11,658
I see my dead kindred!

738
01:44:14,698 --> 01:44:18,517
I see my master in Freyr's Hall!

739
01:44:18,517 --> 01:44:21,126
He calls me to him!

740
01:45:33,488 --> 01:45:37,657
Tonight, I'm mourning
for Thorir's end.

741
01:45:52,128 --> 01:46:01,491
With an end of this swift steel, it's sent to the
highest tree of the battle with my first brother.

742
01:46:31,352 --> 01:46:35,022
You now remain our only heir!

743
01:46:36,404 --> 01:46:42,923
My hour of grief has passed.

744
01:46:43,681 --> 01:46:51,440
The time of revenge is upon us!

745
01:48:36,801 --> 01:48:39,235
This is not Valhalla.

746
01:48:39,235 --> 01:48:42,361
I did not carry you that far.

747
01:48:45,024 --> 01:48:47,606
I am no Valkyrie.

748
01:48:47,608 --> 01:48:51,251
The dreams of your
afterlife must wait.

749
01:48:52,102 --> 01:48:54,049
Besides...

750
01:48:54,049 --> 01:48:57,753
I'm not done with you yet.

751
01:49:15,838 --> 01:49:21,491
My fate brought me to Iceland to
carry out my pledge of vengeance.

752
01:49:22,051 --> 01:49:24,599
But my fate...

753
01:49:25,927 --> 01:49:29,391
did not ready me
for finding you.

754
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:35,057
I thought they must always
feel my heart in stone.

755
01:49:35,057 --> 01:49:39,219
I could not think I would
open it for a last time.

756
01:49:40,789 --> 01:49:44,737
You sacrificed yourself
while you could flee.

757
01:49:44,737 --> 01:49:47,430
And you came back for me.

758
01:49:55,755 --> 01:49:59,062
I have never felt close
to another person.

759
01:50:02,194 --> 01:50:04,895
Not since I was a child.

760
01:50:05,847 --> 01:50:08,899
I'll curse your mother's evil.

761
01:50:10,778 --> 01:50:14,141
She murdered my past.

762
01:50:14,576 --> 01:50:20,258
Could it not be that the Norns of Fate
have spun another thread for you to follow?

763
01:50:22,508 --> 01:50:25,707
What have your gods told you?

764
01:50:26,708 --> 01:50:30,977
That wherever I go, I
must take you with me.

765
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:39,162
I have kinsmen in Orkney.

766
01:50:39,162 --> 01:50:43,380
We can find... we can
find safe passage there.

767
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:45,730
Together.

768
01:50:48,081 --> 01:50:53,226
I cannot truly believe that you may
extinguish your fire for vengeance.

769
01:50:55,647 --> 01:50:58,922
Hate is all I've ever known.

770
01:51:00,079 --> 01:51:02,537
But I wish I
could be free of it.

771
01:51:02,778 --> 01:51:05,385
It is for you to choose.

772
01:51:07,228 --> 01:51:10,513
Let us find our future.

773
01:51:39,342 --> 01:51:41,731
Welcome, seafarers.

774
01:51:41,731 --> 01:51:47,068
The deck of this wooden boat will
only be near ground after 21 days.

775
01:51:47,068 --> 01:51:50,767
If our luck-spirits
smile upon us.

776
01:51:52,549 --> 01:51:56,112
I was expecting
more of Fjölnir's men.

777
01:51:56,112 --> 01:51:58,891
His son was to join us.

778
01:51:59,103 --> 01:52:01,096
Thorir departed early...

779
01:52:01,096 --> 01:52:03,906
on his own ship.

780
01:52:10,885 --> 01:52:14,997
Anchor up! Sail down!

781
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:21,072
- Ropes up!
- Up!

782
01:52:23,104 --> 01:52:27,293
- After the wind, helmsman!
- I will!

783
01:52:27,787 --> 01:52:30,371
Your wounds.

784
01:52:31,533 --> 01:52:34,695
It is nothing to what
happened to you.

785
01:52:34,695 --> 01:52:37,091
I've forgotten already.

786
01:53:07,128 --> 01:53:09,515
My family's blood!

787
01:53:11,777 --> 01:53:15,004
My own blood is inside you!

788
01:53:16,779 --> 01:53:20,274
You are the well our
dynasty will spring from.

789
01:53:20,274 --> 01:53:25,734
I did not wish you to know until I
could trust that the child would be safe.

790
01:53:30,046 --> 01:53:33,343
Well, if Fjölnir lives, our
children will never be safe.

791
01:53:35,174 --> 01:53:40,715
If he knew of this, he will hunt
you with all the fire of the gods.

792
01:53:40,715 --> 01:53:43,704
- It cannot wait!
- Stop this!

793
01:53:43,728 --> 01:53:47,180
There's now a living
thread that binds us.

794
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,593
I was a fool.

795
01:53:51,282 --> 01:53:54,035
I wish to flee with
you from my fate.

796
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:11,244
My vision shows
me you will have two.

797
01:54:12,588 --> 01:54:15,497
My sword, it will save them.

798
01:54:23,365 --> 01:54:26,925
But you have to come
with us. You must!

799
01:54:27,966 --> 01:54:31,438
It was prophesied
that I must choose...

800
01:54:31,438 --> 01:54:36,150
between kindness for my
kin, and hate for my enemies.

801
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:40,158
And see what hope
we have before us.

802
01:54:47,905 --> 01:54:50,399
I choose both.

803
01:54:57,674 --> 01:54:59,171
Take her to Orkney.

804
01:54:59,171 --> 01:55:02,387
In return for this ring, my kinsmen
will give you ninefold its worth.

805
01:55:02,387 --> 01:55:05,183
No! No! Amleth!

806
01:55:09,521 --> 01:55:12,263
You will be a mother to a king!

807
01:55:12,728 --> 01:55:14,749
You cannot escape our fates!

808
01:55:14,749 --> 01:55:16,621
No!

809
01:55:17,025 --> 01:55:19,639
Amleth!

810
01:55:31,865 --> 01:55:35,612
Ride with me, daughters
of the North wind!

811
01:55:35,947 --> 01:55:40,557
Carry me and mine to the
shores of my children's forbears!

812
01:55:40,777 --> 01:55:44,480
There I'll show
you a forest of birch!

813
01:55:44,874 --> 01:55:48,774
Fathomless branches to
dance your tempest with!

814
01:55:48,774 --> 01:55:52,026
Raptured by your
most righteous breath!

815
01:56:59,808 --> 01:57:03,123
It's over there! Follow Fjölnir!

816
01:57:04,538 --> 01:57:06,748
It is him!

817
01:57:10,876 --> 01:57:13,516
Close the hut!

818
01:57:28,533 --> 01:57:31,806
The puppy you once
hunted ate off your nose.

819
01:57:31,806 --> 01:57:34,401
Now the wolf has grown...

820
01:57:34,898 --> 01:57:37,288
youngest for the rest.

821
01:57:43,781 --> 01:57:48,046
Whatever you hear,
you must stay here.

822
01:57:50,426 --> 01:57:53,021
Keep him safe.

823
01:57:53,729 --> 01:57:57,542
- And keep both of you safe.
- I will.

824
01:58:25,965 --> 01:58:28,452
Take your freedom!

825
01:58:28,915 --> 01:58:31,772
And do with it what you will!

826
01:58:42,443 --> 01:58:45,027
Fjölnir!

827
01:58:56,658 --> 01:58:59,147
Never!

828
01:59:11,327 --> 01:59:13,873
In the heart.

829
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:19,291
Thank you.

830
01:59:26,962 --> 01:59:29,274
Mother!

831
02:00:47,195 --> 02:00:50,830
I will meet you at
the Gates of Hel.

832
02:00:52,277 --> 02:00:54,965
At the Gates of Hel...

833
02:00:55,096 --> 02:00:57,283
you will find me.

834
02:00:57,957 --> 02:01:00,420
And there you will die!

835
02:01:01,345 --> 02:01:05,046
By the hand that
killed your father.

836
02:01:47,811 --> 02:01:55,363
<i>The Gates of Hel</i>

837
02:03:13,541 --> 02:03:15,974
Slain by iron.

838
02:03:16,462 --> 02:03:20,587
We should all meet again at
the strong wall of the Old Father.

839
02:04:08,387 --> 02:04:10,500
I will avenge you!

840
02:04:11,634 --> 02:04:14,687
I will honour our blood!

841
02:04:14,973 --> 02:04:17,658
I will cut the thread of Fate!

842
02:04:17,736 --> 02:04:19,763
I will avenge you!

843
02:04:20,410 --> 02:04:22,926
I will honour our blood!

844
02:04:23,397 --> 02:04:25,821
I will cut the thread of Fate!

845
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:28,583
I will avenge you!

846
02:04:29,446 --> 02:04:32,332
I will honour our blood!

847
02:04:32,332 --> 02:04:34,495
I will cut the thread of Fate!

848
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:37,383
I will avenge you!

849
02:04:37,836 --> 02:04:40,114
My blood will be on!

850
02:04:40,224 --> 02:04:43,107
Valhalla waits!

851
02:08:20,269 --> 02:08:25,109
The thread that binds
us can never break.

852
02:08:29,852 --> 02:08:32,352
We are safe.

853
02:08:39,752 --> 02:08:42,837
Now make your passage.

854
02:09:21,691 --> 02:09:29,218
{ The Northman }
