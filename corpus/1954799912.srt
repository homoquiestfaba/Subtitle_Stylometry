2
00:00:02,392 --> 00:00:03,565
I get to buy anything.

3
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:06,275
You're in severe pain!

4
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:07,717
You should be resting!

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,087
-Come on,
-Almost there!

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,070
Bicycling down life's endless highways...

7
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:17,826
I had time to think about
what I'd do differently.

8
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:22,776
Perhaps it's best for both of us
if we aren't together.

9
00:00:23,486 --> 00:00:25,474
Do you believe we're really married?

10
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:26,130
Are we?

11
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:30,316
Even if it was real for just a day,
was it worth it?

12
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:34,054
The government of the United States
doesn't recognize gays getting married.

13
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:35,306
You're a dad

14
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:37,267
Have you picked on a name?

15
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:41,672
Contingent on the approval of all
three parties, Jenny Rebecca.

16
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:42,634
We have the green light.

17
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:43,428
That's awesome!

18
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:45,611
It's going to be tough going back
to Pittsburgh after this...

19
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:46,844
You're really going?

20
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,290
Stay here,

21
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,451
work at the movies.

22
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:50,503
Donc tu pars vraiment?

23
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:51,947
It's what we both agreed to....

24
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,454
For the times that you're not around,
I wouldn't particuraly mind it if you were.

25
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:58,815
I want you to move back in.

Do you know what amazes me?

40
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,160
What, dear?

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,320
Outside a child is born, a man dies, a couple gets marries...

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,570
The ever changing kaleidoscope of life.

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,750
In here... nothing changes.

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,170
Everything's the same. Same hot guys, same thumpa-thumpa...

45
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,970
same shaved chest...

46
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,050
And what a comfort it is to know.

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,570
But it's all a lie, an illusion, just...

48
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,250
...cheap theatrics.

49
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,420
Nevertheless... let's keep dancing.

50
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,560
I promised Ben I'd be home by midnight.

51
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Aah, pathetic!

52
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,310
Well be sure and thank your husband for me for

53
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,610
allowing you to come out and play with your poor lonely friend.

54
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,960
I noticed you left out "old".

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,610
Well you'd be a lot less lonely when you're reunited with your beloved.

56
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,350
Hey, you'd better not say anything!

57
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,320
When have I ever...

58
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,330
Fine. Nevermind.

59
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,380
I give you my word.

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,190
Swear to it. On the memory of Marylin Monroe.

61
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,870
I swear on the memory of Marylin Monroe that I will not tell Justin

62
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,610
that you're flying to L.A this weekend to surprise him, and that you love him,

63
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,800
and you miss him more than words can express.

64
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,790
Who said anything about that?

65
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,200
Look, you don't fool me, Mr. I am a rock, I am an island.

66
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,150
I know how hard it's been for you.

67
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,180
You have no idea, Mikey.

68
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,340
How odd.

69
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,120
Hey, Todd!

70
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,410
How's it going?

71
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,360
Fine...

72
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,690
Hey dickhead! Turn off your fucking cell phone!

73
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,510
What's up?

74
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,700
Just lying here, eating a bag of Dorritos, reading the Brothers Karamazov.

75
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,230
What about you?

76
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,400
Anna Karinina, and Pringles.

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,970
I always said it was our love of Russian literature and snacks high in saturated fat

78
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,970
that brought us together.

79
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,120
So how's work?

80
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,420
Up to my ass in storyboards.

81
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,020
But Brett is thrilled. He says he never could have envisioned the project without me.

82
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,020
He's even talking about a sequel.

83
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,390
My superhero.

84
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,160
The only trouble is, pre-production is slower than we expected.

85
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
So I might have to stay longer than I thought.

86
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,200
How much longer?

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,040
Another three months, maybe four.

88
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,730
The studio is screaming but Brett says not to worry, that happens all the time.

89
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,150
You're not pissed, are you?

90
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,280
Why the fuck would I be pissed?

91
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,800
I told you before you went out there, the only reason I'd be pissed is if you didn't go.

92
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,460
So when are you coming out here?

93
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,460
You'd fucking love it.

94
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,290
You never know when I just might drop in.

95
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, you'd better hurry...

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,020
...the way things are going, I'll be doing "Son of Rage".

97
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,430
I miss you.

98
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,120
Hey you take care of yourself, you hear?

99
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,750
Do the best work you can, and have the best time you can.

100
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,750
It's all that matters.

101
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,330
She has your big button eyes...

102
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,330
and your dimples...

103
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,950
and your adorable nose!

104
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,300
Well, she's got one thing of Mel's that I don't have.

105
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,310
Oh, she's so young, it's hard to tell who she looks like.

106
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,460
At this point, she's just a sleep, eat and poop machine.

107
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,740
Oh yeah, but she is our little sleep, eat and poop machine.

108
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,880
Sweet dreams, honeybun.

109
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,880
Honeybun?

110
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
It's just what my mother used to call me.

111
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,760
Which reminds me, she said to tell you she's coming by tomorrow to see the baby.

112
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,980
Would you have her call first?

113
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,730
She's not pestering you, is she? If she is, just tell me. I hate when she pesters.

114
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,770
Are you sure you guys don't need any groceries? Got diapers, what about talcum powder...

115
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,280
We've got everything under control.

116
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,220
Of course they do, after all these years they're like a fine tuned machine.

117
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,950
I can't wait to be an old married couple.

118
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,250
Don't rush it, it's nice to be newlyweds too.

119
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,040
How many years has it been? - Two hundred.

120
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,430
Ten. This week, actually.

121
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,270
Ten's a biggie, are you planning on anything special?

122
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,610
We're taking a pass this year.

123
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,440
Too tired, too busy.

124
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,770
Just remember, if there's anything you need...

125
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,970
When your tits start lactating, call me.

126
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,940
Bye! Bye...!

127
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,710
You're good.

128
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,280
So are you.

129
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,220
Practice makes perfect.

130
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,770
We're gonna have to tell them eventually.

131
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,770
They'll have to know I'm not living here.

132
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,770
Of course they need to know...

133
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,030
and they will.

134
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,510
Eventually.

135
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,790
I just wanna grab some pantyhose and my lasagna pan.

136
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,820
I don't think I can help you with the pantyhose, but...

137
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,160
don't they have enough pans at my house?

138
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,810
What, that old collection of TV dinner tins?

139
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,700
Speaking of collection, I gotta remember bringing my glass crowns.

140
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,430
Wait...

141
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,190
You just brought over all those owls with all those...

142
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,480
eyes.

143
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,680
With all that stuff you've been hauling over, we might as well be living here.

144
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,340
Carl...

145
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,880
What?

146
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,180
Shit. I don't know how to say this...

147
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,920
You? Not know how to say something?

148
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,820
It's about your place.

149
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,100
What's the matter with my place?

150
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,160
Nothing! No, nothing's the matter with your place.

151
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,040
It's just...

152
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,530
It's not this place.

153
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,050
We've had endless discussions about where we were gonna live,

154
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,050
you said you didn't want to be here.

155
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,500
Too many sad memories.

156
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,120
It's true, and at the time all that I could think about was losing Vic.

157
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,210
But since I've been gone...

158
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,890
all the happy memories are starting to come back, and they've even beaten up the sad ones.

159
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,760
I've lived in this house almost thirty years.

160
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,130
That's practically all of Michael's life...

161
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,120
There were days where we could barely muster up the mortgage, and...

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,430
and days where we parties all night long, that didn't even cound birthdays and holidays.

163
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,280
This house is a part of me.

164
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,330
And I've never been away from it until now.

165
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,360
There's nothing, nothing wrong with your place, sweetheart, I love being there with you.

166
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,550
But I want to come home.

167
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,870
Honey...

168
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,160
It's like I said from the start.

169
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,620
It's up to you.

170
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,450
Wherever you are is home to me.

171
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,450
Really?

172
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,420
Thank you!

173
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,670
Thank you.

174
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,840
Oh yeah!

175
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,590
Fuck me like you mean it, come on!

176
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,350
Welcome home.

177
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,100
You know, every time you see a stuffed animal, you don't have to buy it.

178
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,540
I can't help it, I want my girl to have everything.

179
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,250
Ex-cuse us...

180
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,030
What are they giving me a look for? This isn't a fucking back room!

181
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,630
The party has been going on since last night.

182
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,230
Michael!

183
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,050
I'm just curious.

184
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,420
Packed to the rafters, one of them looks just like...

185
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,160
Hey dudes, you're home.

186
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,260
Why aren't you?

187
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,680
Jason and Troy asked me if we had the new Christina Aguilera CD. So I loaned them ours.

188
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,610
That'll be the last we see of that, thank you very much!

189
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,510
You don't belong over there with guys who've been partying all night!

190
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,750
I was just trying to be neighbourly...

191
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,280
And maybe cop a little weed.

192
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,390
You should be studying for your midterm! - Crack those books, pal.

193
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,920
Give me the ice cream, I'll put it in the freezer.

194
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,900
They seem kind of cranky to you?

195
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,930
Who?

196
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,950
Mel and Linds.

197
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,950
No more than usual.

198
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,340
I mean, yeah, they both are probably exhausted.

199
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,660
They must be, not to want to celebrate your tenth anniversary.

200
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,340
With breastfeeding and changing diapers, I'm sure planning a celebration is the last thought on their minds.

201
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,960
Maybe we should think of it for them.

202
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,040
I hope on our tenth anniversary we're not too tired to celebrate.

203
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,870
I seriously doubt that would ever happen.

204
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,390
Hey!

205
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,320
I thought when you got married you'd fuck less.

206
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,560
Counting down the hours, Bri?

207
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,630
I'd be too, you lucky bastard.

208
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,140
Zooming off to Los Angeles for a little sunshine...

209
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,250
Well, before you fly away,

210
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,800
we need to go over some figures.

211
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,510
How many bear claws you've consumed this morning?

212
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,490
I'm writing down a number.

213
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,570
Oh, I get it, I'm supposed to guess what it is?

214
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,000
Then what, we'd become the new Siegfried and Roy?

215
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,410
That's how much Kinnetic made last quarter.

216
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,610
It's not too shabby.

217
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,250
Not too shabby?! For being in business a year, it's over the fucking moon!

218
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,270
So what do you plan to do with it?

219
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,200
It all yours.

220
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I meant the profits.

221
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,680
Of course, you could always pump it back into the business but...

222
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,720
I caution you against expanding too quickly.

223
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,790
I might say the same thing to you.

224
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,960
As far as stocks and bonds...

225
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,550
to get a good rate you'd have to go out to the middle of the 24th century.

226
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,550
So what do you suggest?

227
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,020
The best investment there is...

228
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,080
Yourself!

229
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,730
Spend it on you! You've worked like a sonofabitch, you went through hell and back with your...

230
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,550
But, thank god, you're okay, so...

231
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,020
treat yourself to something special! Go buy a new toy!

232
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
I've got dildoes up the ass.

233
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,030
I mean that little extravagance you thought you could never afford.

234
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,550
Like...

235
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,550
a shiny red Ferrari...

236
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,500
or perhaps a Warhol to hang in the loft.

237
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,980
Or... how about something for Justin?

238
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,750
Like his own personal Lear jet so he can wing back and forth from the coast to visit you.

239
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,940
I'm sure you'll come up with something you feel like yourself with.

240
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,160
He's so cute!

241
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,150
I'm Devon's biological father.

242
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,210
And Monty's is own Dean's bio-dad.

243
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,600
Same mom however, it's important
to us that they'd be related.

244
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,760
Finally got the kids down, I had
to sing "Under the Sea" six times.

245
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,990
You do perform it brilliantly.

246
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,080
Your kids are so adorable.

247
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,140
Thanks...

248
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,480
Ilay tells me you've just had one of your own.

249
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,970
Jenny Rebecca, um, but we call her J.R.

250
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,600
I love that!

251
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,210
But we're not parenting like you.

252
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,450
Melanie and Lindsey are our lesbian
friends and the primary parents.

253
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,080
Well, if you ever do decide to raise one of your
own, this is the perfect neighbourhood to do it.

254
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,660
We have a huge back yard.

255
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,720
Jimboree down the block.

256
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,770
And they're even putting in a Baby Gap.

257
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,590
It's funny, when I was a kid we weren't even allowed
to come over here, it's too dangerous.

258
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,530
Now the only danger is if they run out
of Wasabi peas at Whole Foods.

259
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,040
Leave it to the queers to turn grass into gold.

260
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,660
That's no fairy tale!

261
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,800
Ever since the gays moved in, started fixing things up, real estate prices have soared.

262
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,840
You guys ever think about moving?

263
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,740
Like a different world, isn't it?

264
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,070
Between here and where Ilay and Monty live.

265
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,130
You wanna stop in for a drink?

266
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,130
I got a lecture to prepare.

267
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,020
So...

268
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,520
how did you like their house?

269
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,320
They did a great job.

270
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,460
It's amazing how much that neighbourhood has changed.

271
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,980
I wish this one would.

272
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,420
It's a used condom or two.

273
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,000
Besides the apartment is too small for the three of us, and that building is like a gay dorm.

274
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,980
It's not that bad!

275
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,250
Not if you're 24 and want to fuck everything that moves... or Brian.

276
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,870
We're past all that, aren't we?

277
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,580
Sure...

278
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,710
So...

279
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,040
What do you think about getting a place of our own?

280
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,470
I don't really want to move.

281
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,150
Why, I bet between the two of us we can afford it.

282
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,110
Maybe so, but this is where we live, where I've lived my whole life...

283
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,090
I don't know if I want to pick up and leave, just like that.

284
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,900
Just a thought.

285
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,580
Charming spacious apartment to share, own bedroom, private bath, no pets...

286
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,340
bottoms only need apply.

287
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,310
Perfect.

288
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,860
So who asked you to leave, Debra or Horbath?

289
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,130
Neither. They didn't have to.

290
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,310
The look on their faces must've been priceless when they found you entertaining.

291
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,080
Deb wanted to watch and have a Q&A afterwards.

292
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,130
No doubt! What about Horbath?

293
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,860
Ever see the blob?

294
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,870
Remember the look on the old farmer's face just before it devoured him?

295
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,100
So I've decided to save everyone the discomfort of going through another embarrassing scene,

296
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,410
kindly fold my tent, and...

297
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,590
Teddy? How many of those power bars have you had?

298
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,840
Who's counting?

299
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
I am. And that's your fourth.

300
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,220
Do you know the number of carbs in those things, not to mention the calories?

301
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,440
So I'll burn them off.

302
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,580
Honey, you'd have to go up in flames.

303
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,760
Look, I know you don't wanna hear this,

304
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,960
so please, please promise me
you won't take it the wrong way...

305
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,290
but as your friend I feel it's my obligation
to tell you. You're getting a little...

306
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,000
A little what?

307
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,140
A little... hardy.

308
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,530
I mean... robust.

309
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,530
I mean... - Fat.

310
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,760
Fat? I've become fat?

311
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,430
Well let's put it this way. If you start singing, it's all over.

312
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,230
I'll have you know, I'm not fat. I'm just...

313
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,230
I'm bulking up.

314
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,720
I was a shadow of my former self when I was on crystal, and I shed quite a few pounds during the Liberty Ride.

315
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,300
And I happen to think I look pretty damn good.

316
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,880
And obviously, so does he.

317
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,250
Who knew you could catch twinkies by stuffing them in your mouth?

318
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,980
Alright! I'm off to find new digs. Taa!

319
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,830
Hey...

320
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,610
Shall we take a peek in the steam room and see what's lurking in the mist?

321
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,350
Can't. Brett's calling from L.A., he wants my input
on a couple of story points for the screenplay.

322
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,490
You know, stuff Rage might say.

323
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,640
Zowie, Zephyr! Check out that... super cock?

324
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,020
Something like that.

325
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,550
Besides I thought you had a plane to catch.

326
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,720
Justin's going to be so excited when you show up.

327
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,090
I'm not going. The trip's cancelled.

328
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,960
But I thought you had all these plans to surprise him.

329
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,270
Guess the surprise is... there's not going to be one.

330
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,340
<i>Reverend Swineheart, Rage's nemesis and
sworn enemy of queers everythere,</i>

331
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,190
<i>preaches his message of hate from his pulpit,</i>

332
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,400
<i>while deep in the catacombs of the church,</i>

333
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,340
<i>Rage hangs suspended above the flames.</i>

334
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,200
<i>his hands bound in really hot leather restraints.</i>

335
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,590
<i>Meanwhile, J.T. races to the rescue...</i>

336
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,970
Mr. Keller says they need the storyboard for
the catacomb sequence now, now, now.

337
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,100
Tell him I'm hurrying as fast as I can, can can.

338
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,550
Pray my hand holds out.

339
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,830
You look all out of breath.

340
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,120
I'm just trying to finish these
storyboards for a certain demanding tyrant.

341
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,700
Forget it, I've got incredible news.

342
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,940
And other than a legion of studio executives, agents,
publicists, managers and both trade papers,

343
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,520
you are the very first to hear it.

344
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,590
We just signed someone to play rage.

345
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,190
Who? Who?!

346
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,360
This is the movies! Instead of telling you, I'll show you.

347
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,100
Conner.

348
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,500
Hey, man.

349
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,750
Where have you been? He's just back from doing a Kabuki version of "Much Ado" off, off, off,

350
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,160
off Broadway.

351
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,180
What a change from working with those Hollywood hacks, I was fired for nothing more than mediocrety.

352
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,580
Still you don't have any problem picking up that paycheck, do you.

353
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,850
Get ready to do some serious acting...

354
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,850
We start flying lessons on Monday.

355
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,060
I thought you turned down the part.

356
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,970
The director convinced me it'd be good for my career.

357
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,860
Show everyone I'm a straight guy who has no problems playing gay for pay.

358
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,420
Right! Stuffed eggplant, Caprisi salad, hummus, and...

359
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,040
the piece the resistance, fried chicken, which is not really fried but baked to taste like fried,

360
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,290
so nobody feels guilty.

361
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,220
Mel and Linds are going to go out of their minds when we show up. I can't thank you enough for all of this, Em.

362
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,790
My pleasure, sweetie.

363
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,420
What's this?

364
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,430
Casserole I made to take along. Millet, leeks and soy cheese.

365
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,630
Are you sure you're not a lesbian?

366
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,190
Kitchen's so tiny you can barely turn around.

367
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,010
Care to dance?

368
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,740
Which isn't too much of a stretch, considering baby Babylon blasting across the hallway.

369
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,740
Tell me about it.

370
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,860
Why are his firm, manly tits in a twist?

371
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,200
He thinks the building's turning into a
den of inequity. Sex, drugs, cruising...

372
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
Okay, so, those are the advantages.
What are the liabilities?

373
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,970
That basically we've outgrown this place.

374
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,280
Let's face it honey, you're a Sadie Sadie Married Lady,

375
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,120
with a hubby and piglets to prove it.

376
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,730
I, on the other hand, remain wantonly single.

377
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,730
So if you're moving out, maybe I should move back in.

378
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,370
We're not moving.

379
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,700
Would you look at this? It's like homo central.

380
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,820
Down! They're just young and having fun, we were once that age, remember?

381
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,130
That's exactly the point, we're not that age anymore.

382
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,720
It's time to move to a house on a street like Ilay and Monty.

383
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,400
Buying a house isn't like buying a CD or a sweater!

384
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,770
Even if we did decide to do it, first we'd have to review our finances, check out the numbers, right Em?

385
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,340
Oh, I'd say checking out the numbers is essential.

386
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:07,750
Trying to dispose of a large sum of expendible income is more exhausting than one might think.

387
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,560
Who ever said the world is fair? Next time you'll think twice before becoming a success.

388
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,260
You're not doing so bad yourself.

389
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,420
Ben wants us to buy a house in that new area where all the gay couples are moving.

390
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,020
Oh, and become Stepford fags?

391
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,160
Maybe you should get a new place. House in the country?

392
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,980
I hate the fucking country.

393
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,410
A yacht?

394
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,700
Right. Pittsburgh: the new St. Tropez.

395
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,300
Ride on the space shuttle?

396
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,990
I'm a tad shy of twenty mil.

397
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,310
How about a bottle of wine for Mel and Linds's anniversary bash?

398
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,860
Who says I'll be there?

399
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,950
I figured since you cancelled your trip...

400
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,010
It doesn't mean I'm going to be raising a glass to their marathon muff-a-thon.

401
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,930
That...

402
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,050
is a distinct possibility.

403
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,540
Do you imagine eating pussy, the same pussy,

404
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,290
for ten years?

405
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,620
No, but I don't suppose they get fed of sucking the same cock.

406
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,060
That makes three of us.

407
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Unless it's Justin's.

408
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,290
It's a shame you couldn't go to L.A.

409
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,950
I'm busy. And he's busy.

410
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,960
We're all busy.

411
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
I just hope he gets back soon so we
could finish the next issue of Rage.

412
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,780
He's not coming back.

413
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,540
What do you mean, he's not coming back?

414
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,560
Did he tell you that? He didn't have to.

415
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,770
When I spoke to him all he said was that he
was going to have to be there longer than he...

416
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,770
Listen, Mikey...

417
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,460
are you listening?

418
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,060
Yes! Christ sake, I'm listening.

419
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,200
Just figure it out for yourself! I mean,
first it's three months. Then it's six months.

420
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,610
One project turns to another, and another.

421
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,290
Before you know it...

422
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,060
He's there a year. Five years.

423
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,090
It's the way it goes.

424
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,630
I don't blame him.

425
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,610
He's having the time of his life, he's working the movies.

426
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,510
He's fucking movie stars.

427
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,500
That doesn't mean he's never coming home.

428
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,210
Who the hell would come back to Pittsburgh after L.A.?

429
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,170
I mean if that was me, I'd never come back.

430
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,610
He's not you.

431
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,480
It's time he got on with his life. It's time I got on with mine.

432
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,040
I can't believe how someone so little
could have so much poop in them.

433
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,080
You might just grow up to be a lawyer.

434
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,700
Hey Mel...

435
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,360
Hey, Michael...

436
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,520
Who chipped you?

437
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,670
Changing you-know-who's you-know-what, for the billionth time today.

438
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,070
Is that's how you're going to spend your tenth anniversary?

439
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,570
You've got a better idea?

440
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,070
As a matter of fact...

441
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,110
Surprise!

442
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,430
Surprise!

443
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,390
How's my grand daughter...

444
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,580
I haven't seen you for ever!

445
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
Not since this morning.

446
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,150
Wipe the dyke in the headlights look off your face, you're having a surprise party courtesy of auntie Em's special occasions.

447
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,850
And you don't have to lift a finger, everything has been taken care of.

448
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,350
Food in the dining room, please!

449
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,870
Where's Linds?

450
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,660
She went to the grocery store. With Gus.

451
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,310
We want to surprise her too.

452
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,830
She'll be surprised.

453
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,970
Would you excuse me for a second?

454
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,240
Hello?

455
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,800
Hi, it's me.

456
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,550
Is something wrong?

457
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,250
Yeah, fucking right something's wrong.

458
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,670
No, it's not with the baby, it's just... get your ass over here, quick.

459
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,360
Why?

460
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,880
They're giving us a fucking surprise party.

461
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,420
Well, Emmett's done it again.

462
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,520
This food is great.

463
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,230
She must really be stocking up.

464
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,120
You know, double coupons.

465
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,000
Is Teddy getting tubby?

466
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,740
Considering me a Darwinist with his new bow, I'd say fat is the new thin.

467
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,370
So where have you been keeping yourself? I barely see you since I moved back.

468
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,180
Um, actually, I've been out looking for a place.

469
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,780
A place? For what?

470
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,800
To live.

471
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,260
Why the hell would you do that?

472
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,560
It's not cause we walked in on you fucking some guy... is it?

473
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,640
Well...

474
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,720
That was just a case of bad timing, that's all. I mean,

475
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,350
it's kind of funny actually, when you think about it.

476
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,320
I'm not sure that Carl found it to be that laugh riot that you did.

477
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,330
Don't worry about Carl, he'll get used to it.

478
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,720
He shouldn't have to.

479
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,450
The house should be the two of yours, Deb. Not the three of ours.

480
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,380
But, he'll never be Blanche when I'm playing Baby Jane, he doesn't have the shoulders or the eyebrows.

481
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,570
Come on, do you think he's going to take
me to sing along Wizard of Oz, or get dishy
with me during the award shows, or...

482
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,020
pull my face back and tell me how much work I need?

483
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
And other words?

484
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,310
You're irreplaceable.

485
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,390
We both have to face it, Deb.

486
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,390
Life with your detective does not include me.

487
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,550
What the hell took you so long?

488
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,640
I had to wake up Gus and get him dressed.

489
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,520
Here she is.

490
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,130
Surprise!

491
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,450
Isn't that great? Our friends are throwing us a surprise party for our anniversary.

492
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,850
Where are the groceries?

493
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,120
The groceries?

494
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Ooh, they're being delivered, tomorrow.

495
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,060
Does everyone have champagne?

496
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,720
You can't toast without a glass.

497
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,540
We know how exhausted you two are, but we couldn't let this landmark go by without a little celebration.

498
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,330
Ten years is quite an achievement.

499
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,140
I'll say!

500
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,020
Now more than ever it's important people know that a gay couple can be just as committed as any straight couple.

501
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,590
To Mel and Linds.

502
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,180
To Mel and Linds!
- Speech from the old married couple, come on.

503
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,520
There is something we'd like to say.

504
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
No, there isn't.

505
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,820
Now is not the right time.

506
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,530
When is the right time?

507
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,570
The right time for what?

508
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,640
I think you all should know... how much we appreciate this.

509
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,350
Would you stop?

510
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,030
We can't hide it anymore, it isn't fair.

511
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,480
Thank you for all your good wishes.

512
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,700
But you see, Melanie and I are having some problems.

513
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,450
I wasn't having any problems, I was trying to have a baby.

514
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,850
Alright, I'm the one responsible for all the problems.

515
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,880
Damn right you are!

516
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,410
For which I have apologized endlessly!

517
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,750
You still refuse to accept the fact...

518
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,630
That fucking Sam Aurbach had nothing to do with sex?

519
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,990
It was all about art, all the humping was all about form and function?

520
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,020
The truth is, we haven't been living together since our daughter was born.

521
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,270
Who turned on the lights?

522
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,320
What the fuck's going on?!

523
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,510
Turn them off!

524
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,880
Turn the fucking lights back off!

525
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,300
Jesus Christ!

526
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,360
Gentlemen!

527
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,380
May I have your attention!

528
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,590
This club is officially closed.

529
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,240
Pull up your pants and go home.

530
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,840
Come on! Let's go, everybody.

531
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,930
The party's over.

532
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,510
That includes you!

533
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,160
Just wait a sec...

534
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,850
Thanks, officer...

535
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,750
I'd do the same for you one say.

536
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,050
I come here every day to be with the baby.

537
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,370
So I can be with Gus.

538
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,840
Then Gus and I go back to the apartment.

539
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,930
You have an apartment?

540
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,550
A small one bedroom I've been renting.

541
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,610
We've... been renting.

542
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,610
Although we can barely afford this place.

543
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,680
Well, Gus and I have to live somewhere, or would you rather we sleep on the street?

544
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,730
Did I say that?

545
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,110
We're just a little thrown back, I've gotta admit.

546
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,900
It's a shock.

547
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,530
I wanted it all out in the open.

548
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,280
Well, I didn't.

549
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,510
I'm the one who had the baby.

550
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,510
I'd enough to deal with without having to explain to everyone.

551
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,100
Look, you've been having personal problems, we understand.

552
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,500
No, we do not understand!

553
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,820
How could you not say a word all this time?

554
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,410
So when were you going to tell me, after she grew up and went to college, and got married and had children of her own?

555
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,330
I have seen you practically every day since Jenny was born, and it's...

556
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,950
You've always been so sweet, so adorable, two doting mothers, well,

557
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,830
who would've guessed it was a big fucking lie!

558
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,140
We made a wrong decision by not telling you.

559
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,310
For which we are truely sorry.

560
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,750
But we've been under a lot of stress...

561
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,150
Ain't that the truth.

562
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,440
You have no idea how deceit can raise your blood pressure.

563
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,580
When I agreed to be the baby's father it was because I knew

564
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,490
she would be raised in a loving home.

565
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:28,810
With two loving parents, not in some sort of a time sharing arrangement with complimentary sniping!

566
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,560
Now you can make all the excuses you want, but if this is how you're planning on raising our daughter, we should never have had her in the first place!

567
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,960
God, I love this part.

568
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,530
Frankly, I've never been to keen about the grope-the-old-man movies.

569
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,530
I love the classics.

570
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,380
Here, have another.

571
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,380
No, no, no, I couldn't.

572
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:11,740
Come on!

573
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,740
No, six is my upper limit.

574
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,610
Come on!

575
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,060
No!

576
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,140
At this rate,

577
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:30,440
I'm going to turn into that guy I saw on TV. He was so fat they had to remove a wall to get him out of the house.

578
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Fine by me.

579
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,150
There is something about the scent of an old guy...

580
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,860
...makes me so hot.

581
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,760
Lovely grey flecks,

582
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
turning into white...

583
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:57,520
The baby bottom pink scalp, peeking through the little hairs on the top.

584
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,110
Like wild grass on the beach.

585
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,180
And to grab on to those love handles...

586
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,390
...while I'm shooting all over that big, full belly...

587
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,110
Come on, lover...

588
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,460
Eat.

589
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,340
Sean, honey, I told you to stay in my room.

590
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,470
I'm not Sean, honey.

591
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,220
Oops... clearly.

592
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,600
Hand me the cranberry juice.

593
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,300
I've been meaning for us to have a...

594
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,330
powwow.

595
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,180
Although I never imagined it to be...

596
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,180
All that thrill?

597
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,150
You have nothing to worry about.

598
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,360
My lust bunny is locked away in my room.

599
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,680
I even put a gag in his mouth.

600
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,920
Of course, it was leather, and...

601
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,920
he begged me to do it.

602
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,720
Anyway, it's a...

603
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,450
Starting Sunday...

604
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,080
you and Deb will have this place all to yourselves.

605
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,840
Um, buffalo wing?

606
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,000
Deb is very upset you're leaving.

607
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,040
You know how to stop her from buying everything on QVC.

608
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,770
Truth is, I'm a little sorry to see you go myself.

609
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,650
You are?

610
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,420
Is that such a surprise?

611
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,590
Franky, yes.

612
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,450
Well, straight men take one look at me and run for the hills.

613
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,870
Even my father ran me out on a rail.

614
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,270
Well, that's his loss. You're a good man.

615
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,590
In fact, considering...

616
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,970
the number of hours I work, sometimes all night...

617
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,710
I'd be a hell of a lot happier if I knew Deb wasn't in the house alone.

618
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,960
Cop Horbath...

619
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,340
are you asking me to stay?

620
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,150
It doesn't take a detective to figure that out.

621
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,480
But...

622
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,740
it's up to you.

623
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,120
What about my sex... my...

624
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
love... life?

625
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,920
I bought a sound machine.

626
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,780
All I hear now is...

627
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,810
raindrops falling, rivers flowing, birds chirping.

628
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:42,750
Maybe I should get one of those, pretend I'm fucking in a rain forest.

629
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,840
Well, I'd better get back to...

630
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Sean honey.

631
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,960
You know, if, um...

632
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,310
if you were gay, you'd make one hell of a bear.

633
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,900
I told Melanie, who's sitting right over there,

634
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,450
I said, doesn't matter what's going on between you and Lindsey, your first responsibility is that baby.

635
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,240
Deb, could I get a piece of the Key Lime?

636
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,180
You finish your meat loaf. But did they listen?

637
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,520
Obviously not!

638
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,710
Instead they go and destroy a family.

639
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,800
Turn a happy home into a broken one.

640
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Without even telling us.

641
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,310
Coffee to go, Deb.

642
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,010
How could you eat after what happened last night?

643
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,850
You're telling me? Steam is still coming out of my ears.

644
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,540
If I hear that fucking thing one more time, you're going to be hearing bells.

645
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,880
My heart's broken. My soul...

646
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,630
crushed.

647
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,030
How do you think I feel? The insensitivity!

648
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,630
You know, it's immoral. That's what it is.

649
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,140
You're telling me.

650
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,440
How could they do this.

651
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,580
You were right, never trust munchers!

652
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,840
Munchers?

653
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,190
Mel and Linds.

654
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,660
What the hell have they got to do with it?

655
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,850
Who do you think is responsible?

656
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,550
For closing Babylon?

657
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,980
Is that all you care about?

658
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,290
Who gives a shit if the cops closed down Babylon?

659
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:10,900
I, for one, give a very big shit if that cum stain, Sapperstein was defrauding the internal revenue service

660
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,370
by hiding thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of dollars up in his office in pillowcases.

661
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:20,090
Which, knowing him, you can be sure were not of the highest thread count.

662
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,440
And now, because of his illegal activities, Babylon is gone.

663
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,690
Kaput. Finito.

664
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,510
And that concerns you more than the fact that Mel and Linds were lying to us.

665
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,780
How my daughter and your son are the products of a broken home.

666
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,190
Christ... the three of you!

667
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,460
Never saw such... drama queens.

668
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,030
First Lindsey was wailing to me on the phone the night she and Melanie split, and now you.

669
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,990
Wait a minute! You're telling me you knew about this and you didn't tell me?!

670
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,930
She asked me not to.

671
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,160
So your loyalty to her, was more important than our friendship.

672
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,280
Don't make this about is, Michael.

673
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,280
Because it's not.

674
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,890
The ever changing kaleidoscope of life.

675
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,100
<i>J.T. float, lost among the stars...</i>

676
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,370
<i>wondering if he'll ever see Rage again.</i>

677
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,640
I promised I'd come for you, J.T.

678
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,190
Even if I had to go to the end of the universe.

679
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,410
I just did a test in front of the green screen.

680
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,850
So?

681
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,930
What do you think?

682
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:47,570
It's hot. And itchy.

683
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,140
Check out this package.

684
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,980
That's gonna win an Oscar of special effects.

685
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,110
Didn't hear you complaining.

686
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,290
Okay, super hero...

687
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,580
turn in your tights. Benjamin just pulled the plug.

688
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,510
What? He can't do that.

689
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,250
He can and he did. Green my ass...

690
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,640
and not like in scene 32 where Rage gives J.T. the rimming of a lifetime.

691
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,410
The picture's over budgeted, over scheduled...

692
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,060
You said they say that about every picture.

693
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,740
They do.

694
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,300
Then what's the real reason?

695
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,690
He's afraid. The times, the political climate.

696
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,080
Well he's wrong!

697
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,950
Tell him there are millions of queers out there with billions of dollars.

698
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,610
He's more concerned about alienating the family audience.

699
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,610
Pissing off the parent coorporation.

700
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,610
Displeasing someone in Washington who

701
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,540
makes that tax break very hard to come by.

702
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,540
So it's over?

703
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,390
Just like that?

704
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,650
He's greenlighting "The Passion of Moses".

705
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,910
Gay's out. God's in.

706
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,730
Oh sweetie, do you have a cold?

707
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,730
I think he caught one last night.

708
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,370
I'm not surprised.

709
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,610
Dragging him over here so we could play one big happy family.

710
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,290
I didn't drag him.

711
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,610
And you're the one who called, who insisted we keep us this ridiculous charade.

712
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,530
And you saw why I did, didn't you?

713
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,450
Now I have to deal with all their shit, as well as our own.

714
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,860
Speaking of shit.

715
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,460
Did you bring his medication?

716
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,200
Delicious cherry flavor your kids will love?

717
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,150
He hates it.

718
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,230
Why don't you let me?

719
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,180
Cause I can do it! Would you just go to work already?

720
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,260
It had to be done.

721
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,520
We had to tell them.

722
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,400
It's just that...

723
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,060
What?

724
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,520
Telling them...

725
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,390
Seeing their faces...

726
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,100
Knowing they know...

727
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,220
Somehow makes it real.

728
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,700
Yeah?

729
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,250
We're having some of the neighbours over Sunday for a barbecue.

730
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,200
Have us a couple of members of our illustrious English department

731
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,970
Kelly and Braverman...

732
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,970
Why don't you guys come too?

733
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,930
Sounds great.

734
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,140
And be sure to bring Hunter.

735
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,610
Hey...

736
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,310
How's it going?

737
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,810
They just moved in across the street.

738
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,350
They got twins.

739
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,190
Seems like everybody around here has got kids.

740
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,870
It won't be long before you'll be out, strolling with your own bambino too.

741
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,580
This one just went on the market.

742
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,950
Nice yard, but it could use a makeover.

743
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,190
Couldn't we all.

744
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,070
Wonder what they're asking.

745
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,700
In that condition, it's probably a bargain.

746
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,630
Sure you guys aren't interested?

747
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,220
Oh, we've talked it over and decided

748
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,230
that we stay put for now.

749
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,030
How soon could we see it?

750
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,720
Like you said, we're on top of each other in the apartment, Hunter needs his own space,

751
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,100
Jenny Rebecca is going to need her own room.

752
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,920
A yard, to play in...

753
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,180
We'll write down the realtor's number and you can give him a call.

754
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,810
I thought you wanted to stay in Liberty Avenue.

755
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,320
Maybe it's time for a change.

756
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,160
Brian!

757
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,170
So why the urgent message, meet me at Babylon now?

758
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,410
I found that little something you told me to treat myself to.

759
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,520
What?

760
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,440
You're standing in it.

761
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,370
Babylon?!

762
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,290
A said a toy, not a playroom!

763
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,010
I want it!

764
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,400
Oh you want it.

765
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,750
What for?

766
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,150
I got to keep the boys off the street at night.

767
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,500
I'm going to provide them with a warm and friendly environment

768
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,880
in which to use illegal substances and have promiscuous sex. Safely, of course.

769
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,740
A noble sentiment, but investment wise, not very practical.

770
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,310
And what would be practical, Theodore?

771
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,610
To get married?

772
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,660
And move to the suburbs?

773
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,220
Become a home loving, child raising, God fearing

774
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,790
imitation heterosexual?

775
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,480
And for what?

776
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,100
So that I can become another dead soul, going to the mall, and dropping my kids off at school.

777
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,070
And having barbecues in the back yard.

778
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,590
That's their death.

779
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,940
Not mine.

780
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,000
I'm a cock sucker!

781
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,710
I'm queer!

782
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,370
And to anyone who takes pity, or offense...

783
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,420
I say, judge yourself.

784
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,460
This is where I live.

785
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,590
This is who I am.

786
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:51,520
<i>And as Rage stands at the precepice of a new world...</i>

787
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:47,130
It all seems to be coming together. No glitches that I can forsee.

788
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,000
Everything looks good. The lease had been signed,

789
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,590
the liquor license had been transferred into the name of Kinnetic Corp.,

790
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:56,620
you've got enough insurance that if someone so much as sneezes, you're protected...

791
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,640
In short, the joint's all yours.

792
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,010
Theodore, you are a marvel.

793
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,950
Although when I said go buy yourself a new toy, this isn't exactly the toy I had in mind.

794
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:10,980
It says in the box "appropriate for boys from ages 19 to 40", so stop fretting, mother,

795
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,980
I can afford it.

796
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,290
Are you sure we can afford it?

797
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:20,770
We did the math a dozen times, even without the movie we each have enough income.

798
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,060
Plus, the money we've saved...

799
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,840
I just need some reassurance.

800
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:29,960
How's that?

801
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,030
I'm already thinking color schemes.

802
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:39,030
All the back room needs is a fresh coat of black paint, and a condom dispenser.

803
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:44,340
What about pink walls with a sky blue ceiling and white fluffy clouds for the baby's room?

804
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:49,630
That's amazing how with a few simple touches you can turn a tired old room into a fresh and inviting space.

805
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:54,420
Or we could wallpaper, remember how Monty and Ilay had their kid's room wallpapered with Disney characters?

806
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,600
And get a cleaning crew in here to jackhammer the dried cum off the floor.

807
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,810
Yeah, but it's probably yours.

808
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,670
With all this space, at least we won't be on top of each other.

809
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,990
That's unless we choose to be.

810
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,510
I want to reopen by Friday,

811
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,410
Friday? This Friday? But that's impossible.

812
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,690
You said that every day that we're closed, we're losing money.

813
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:19,660
Yeah, but we still need to line up bartenders, go-go boys, a new manager...

814
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,840
Well then, you better line them up.

815
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,440
There's so much to do!

816
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,720
They say it took 500 years to complete Notre Dam.

817
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,020
Is that supposed to be encouraging?

818
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:36,120
We're making a home, together. Who cares how long it takes?

819
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,720
Well, if there's a problem we'll just change the table cloths.

820
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,730
And the napkins.

821
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,250
And the flowers.

822
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,670
And the menu.

823
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,280
Let me know if you wanna change the groom...

824
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,690
Okay...

825
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,740
What was that?

826
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,160
The wedding of Alien and Predator.

827
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,990
The groom's the producer of the channel 5 six o'clock news.

828
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,730
It will be big news if I survive.

829
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:08,350
Bride's a twice-divorced drama queen, Panzer division, who's convinced there is going to be a disaster,

830
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:12,650
and believe me, if she doesn't get off my ass, which are words you rarely hear me say,

831
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:13,510
there will be.

832
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,700
Well it can't be any worse than Mel and Lindsey's anniversary surprise.

833
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,850
No shit. - Now honey, I can't let yourself get all worked up.

834
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:26,250
Of course, I realize that may be genetically impossible.

835
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,100
Hey boys. Bacon cheese burger for Michael, pot pie for Em,

836
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,910
and a BLT for Teddy,

837
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,730
hold the bacon, lettuce, bread, mayo and fries.

838
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,930
Trying to keep yourself in shape for your new boyfriend?

839
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,100
He's adorable. - Yeah.

840
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,050
He's history.

841
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,750
Jacks off to photos of Ted Kennedy.

842
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:52,740
Actually thought Marlon Brando needed to gain a few pounds.

843
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,620
That's why he was in love with me. Fat and old turn him on.

844
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,330
Teddy, you're not fat.

845
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,820
Well, not hugely grossly.

846
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,820
And you're certainly not old.

847
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,220
Excuse me, sir.

848
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,390
Sir?

849
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,820
Babylon reopens Friday night.

850
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,700
Here you go, guys.

851
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,350
He called me "sir".

852
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,880
He spoke loudly, so I could hear.

853
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,470
I thought Babylon went belly-up.

854
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:27,270
You mean you didn't know? Tell him, Teddy.

855
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,070
I resuscitated it.

856
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:31,890
Put my mouth on it, and blew.

857
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:35,140
So that's how you spend your disposable income?

858
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,300
You should've bought a house.

859
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,010
Some of us queers prefer dancing and fucking, to kiddies and picket fences.

860
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,400
Word on the street is that Poppers is the new hotspot.

861
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,820
Friday night Poppers goes back to being the piss hole it always was.

862
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:00,410
Hi J.R.! Your daddies love you.

863
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:02,600
There's this new place in the mall.

864
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,670
You design the bears yourself and pick out their outfits, record their voices...

865
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,300
It's adorable! - Precious.

866
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,770
You'll have to forgive Melanie, she's been up all night with J.R.

867
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,360
She has colic, cried for four hours straight.

868
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,460
Look, I wanted to apologize for getting so heated the other night.

869
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:26,880
It was a shock, that's all. I wasn't expecting... - We know.

870
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,000
No one was.

871
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,280
Although, now that I remember,

872
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:37,170
Every time I would stop by, one of you was always out, or at work, or taking a nap...

873
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,820
Anyway, I'm sorry. - You said that.

874
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,410
I mean that after all this time, you two couldn't work things out that it had to come to this...

875
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:49,390
Thank you very much, we're sorry too. Now if you don't mind can we not discuss our marital problems?

876
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:53,390
The important thing is, we need to decide how we're going to take care of our child.

877
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,310
Our child?

878
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,050
How much time she'll spend with you and with Linds, and with Ben and me...

879
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,050
we're buying a new house.

880
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,580
I'll tell you how much time she's gonna spend with you. None!

881
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,580
Melanie, please, would you lower your voice?

882
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,540
I'm sure we could handle this without screaming.

883
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,540
Who's screaming, I'm making a point.

884
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,280
Tell that to her.

885
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:17,810
We had an agreement that I'd be a part of our daughter's life!

886
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:20,850
Yeah, which at no time included physical custody. That was never discussed.

887
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,880
Because when we made it, you two were together! A couple, a family!

888
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,100
Now all that changed, now you're not!

889
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,250
Why, I'm still her mother. - So am I.

890
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,290
And I'm her father. - No one is denying that.

891
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:35,070
She is! She's saying I have no rights! - No, I'm saying you may be her father,

892
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:39,930
her biological father, but Lindsey and me are still her parents. That hasn't changed.

893
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,300
Now, if you will excuse me,

894
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,770
my daughter needs to be fed.

895
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:57,740
Right! Upon arrival, the guests will be offered a glass of Chateauneuf du Pape 1991.

896
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,170
Make that 1990.

897
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,170
1990.

898
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,490
A string quartet plays a medeley of your favorite Elton John songs...

899
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,100
I've decided to go with "Eine kleine Nachtmusic".

900
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,770
Well, scratch "Rocket Man".

901
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:15,070
Now, when the wedding march begins... we are keeping the wedding march?

902
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:18,920
Oh, of course... you'll enter from over there, um,

903
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,700
Why not from over here? - You'll enter from over here,

904
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,370
holding a spray of lillies. - I'm thinking of white roses and baby's breath.

905
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:30,080
Baby's breath, okay, you'll then proceed to the bower, um,

906
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,470
at which point... - What if it rains?

907
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,060
I already asked Johnny. No rain.

908
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:39,730
Your weather man couldn't predict a hurricane if it was blowing down Market street.

909
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:44,060
I've gotta get back to the station, I've got a remote coming in from Iraq.

910
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,280
Iraq?

911
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,430
Screw Iraq!

912
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,510
We're having a wedding! - Now now, don't you worry...

913
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:56,760
I am going to have a little talk with God, and there's no way he's going to let anything rain on your...

914
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,460
parade.

915
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:03,630
The ladies room. We haven't decided the color of the toilet tissue.

916
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,470
Lavender. No, mint! No, buttercup!

917
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:11,450
I wish you could see Lila under less stressful conditions.

918
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,450
She'll still drive you nuts, but...

919
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:17,910
I love her. - Well, of course you do. That's what this is all about.

920
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,750
You know, I gotta hand it to you. I don't know how you do it.

921
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:28,260
One of the reasons we queer guys are around... help you straight people straighten up.

922
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:35,170
Just make sure you pack my swimsuits and t-shirts soon, it's summer in Australia. - Yes sir.

923
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,470
Anyways, they fired him. Three days into production.

924
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,160
First time director, huge production... he couldn't handle it.

925
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,620
Also I hear he and Orlando Bloom did not get along.

926
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:49,100
Blair? I want that trainer in my hotel every morning at 5 am, uh?

927
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:53,260
Well, call the producer and fucking demand it!

928
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,370
How long will you be gone?

929
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:58,210
Well, it's a six month shoot, provided I can do post here, we're still negotiating.

930
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,080
Where the hell is my Ambien.

931
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,470
On an 18 hour flight, this is the only way to fly. - I'm sure.

932
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:07,410
Listen, I don't mean to throw you out or anything, but I just figured

933
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,520
while I was gone would be a good time to do some work on the house, you know, redecorate.

934
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,040
But... - Please feel free to stay for a couple of days until you line up with something else.

935
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,490
Thanks.

936
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,190
Even though I'm on the other side of the world, I haven't lost my passion for Rage.

937
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,550
My development people are going to shop it around,

938
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:31,150
the gay crusader is too powerful to be defeated by some asshole who can't see beyond the box office.

939
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,480
Right?

940
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,530
Blair?

941
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,580
I'm not happy with the time we've arranged for the car...

942
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,570
I can't believe the way she talked to me. - You're the father.

943
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:47,670
But I'm not the parent, at least not as far as Melanie is concerned.

944
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:51,800
Oh, that's bullshit. You're every bit as much her parent as she is. - You should've heard her.

945
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,340
Screaming so loud, she woke up the baby.

946
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,530
While they are carrying on...

947
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:01,510
I know we can provide a more stable home life for J.R. than they can.

948
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:06,790
I'm sure you're right. But the one thing we mustn't do is overreact. We've gotta stay calm,

949
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:09,850
and rational. - Everybody keeps telling me that!

950
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,830
Alright. I'll be calm. And rational.

951
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:21,100
There's no way I'm giving up my kid.

952
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:25,880
Finish up with those lights, we're about to open the doors!

953
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,690
Could you move those cartons behind the bar? - Yes sir.

954
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:30,450
And don't call me "sir"!

955
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,380
Break a leg, baby!

956
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:37,430
Just don't do it while we're shaking our booties. - I didn't think I'd see you here.

957
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,200
Thought you'd be too busy with the wedding plans.

958
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,640
I'm never to busy to sit ring-side on opening night.

959
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,640
Ready in two minutes.

960
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,640
And what have we here?

961
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,540
This is Alonzo, this is Emmett.

962
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,080
Already picturing a moonlit beach, caressed by a carribean breeze,

963
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,990
the palms sway gently to a latin guitar.

964
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,150
We didn't have too many palm trees in Trenton.

965
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,190
Alonzo is the new club manager.

966
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:04,600
And may I say, a vast improvement over the former one.

967
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:09,960
I haven't have this much fun with a toy since my erector set.

968
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,360
My parent's couldn't afford an erector set. So I decided to play with the one God gave me.

969
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:18,120
Okay boys! Take your places!

970
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,500
Let's bring the lights down...

971
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:23,160
and the strobes up.

972
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,940
And we're back in business. - Not quite.

973
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:32,970
Ain't Babylon without that thumpa-thumpa!

974
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,880
Okay boys and boys, what time is it?

975
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,050
It's showtime!

976
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,500
What - the - fuck?

977
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:24,410
Don't worry, it's still... it's early.

978
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:35,710
Where is everybody? - It's "Shorts and Shots" night at Poppers,

979
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:38,070
all the hot guys are over there.

980
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:42,020
Think I'll go, um, check it out.

981
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:05,720
Todd.

982
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,220
Hey...

983
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:11,100
Didn't think you're still in town.

984
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,500
This is Justin, and so is this.

985
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,490
Seems there's no shortage of us in Hollywood.

986
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:19,490
You get me another Ghetto, hun.

987
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:26,960
He's cute, if you like the type.

988
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:31,480
Really sucks about Rage, doesn't it? - Yeah.

989
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,360
Really sucks. I swear there's not an ounce of artistic integrity in this fucking town.

990
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,670
Why don't you go back to New York? To the theater.

991
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:43,130
I would in a heartbeat if I didn't have a 3-picture deal with Bruckheimer.

992
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:48,160
So where's our genious director? - He left yesterday for Australia.

993
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:51,450
I heard he's taking over that remake of Mothra?

994
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:56,690
Well, it isn't a Brett Keller film unless something flys. - He still plans on doing Rage, though.

995
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:01,230
His people are out shopping it to other studios, now that it's in turnabout.

996
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:04,480
That's turn-around. - Right.

997
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,030
He swore he's going to get it made.

998
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:11,490
Well, that's out Brettsky. Fighting the evil empire single handed. But,

999
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:18,110
in this business, the only thing that rises from the dead is Dracula. And then only if Brad Pitt is playing.

1000
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:21,820
When something's over, it's over.

1001
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,920
You look like you gave an orgy and nobody came.

1002
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,100
I love how you can take a stale cliche and make it fresh.

1003
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,630
Could you do the same for this muffin?

1004
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,150
What the fuck's with you?

1005
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:03,720
Guess how many homos showed up last night for the reopening of Babylon.

1006
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,480
Is this one of those lightbulb jokes?

1007
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:10,630
Twelve. Counted'em. Twelve.

1008
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,630
Eight fucking grand, down the crapper.

1009
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:18,780
If I don't do something quick, it's going to be another eight fucking grand tonight,

1010
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,460
and tomorrow night, and the next night.

1011
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,970
Sounds like one hell of an expensive blowjob.

1012
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,970
I wouldn't have mind it, even that.

1013
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:30,860
But not one of them was even remotely fuckable. - I don't get it, where did they all go?

1014
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:34,170
The music was fucking awesome, and only a buck a shooter.

1015
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:37,010
Where you boys have been all night? - Poppers.

1016
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:40,540
Poppers?! That dump's older than I am.

1017
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:44,020
The only thing that is...

1018
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,780
There you have it.

1019
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:53,920
You of all people should know. There's no one more fickle than a fag.

1020
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,110
Hey. - Sorry I'm late.

1021
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,350
The woman in front of me had a stack of coupons.

1022
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,990
Hey, sweetie! - Hi Mommy.

1023
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:11,150
Did you have fun with mama?

1024
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,220
Here's the mail. - Thanks.

1025
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:21,280
Okay big boy... gather up your toys, it's time to go.

1026
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,050
Mama, I don't want to go.

1027
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,090
Are we gonna go through this every time?

1028
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,730
It's okay, sweetie. I'll see you tomorrow when Mommy goes to work, okay?

1029
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:38,030
How's J.R.? - Up all night, screaming.

1030
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:41,900
Why don't you let me take her? - You can't be up all night, and look after Gus, and work all day.

1031
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,970
You're exhausted. - Don't worry about me, okay? I can handle it.

1032
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:49,040
No one said you couldn't. - Then don't start. - I'm not starting anything.

1033
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,400
I just wish there was some way we could just... - Make up?

1034
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,400
Get along.

1035
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:57,800
Shit. - What is it?

1036
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,890
That little fucker hired a lawyer.

1037
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,890
Her name is Bobby Bennett.

1038
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:05,080
I thought she was married to Hugh Heffner.

1039
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,490
That's Barbie Benton. This is a tough gay lawyer.

1040
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:13,170
She took the first gay adoption case in Pennsylvania to the state's supreme court, and won. - Yeah.

1041
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:16,790
She said as J.R.'s biological father I have rights, and I should fight for them.

1042
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,790
No! No, I don't like it there.

1043
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:24,900
So, she has agreed to take our case. - Glad to see you stand up for yourself.

1044
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,370
I'm sorry it had to come to this. - Well they didn't leave me any choice!

1045
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:31,570
Is this where you want it, Deb?

1046
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:34,520
Where I want it is in the garbage. But...

1047
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,320
it's Carl's favorite chair, so...

1048
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:50,380
Hey, that's better, huh? - Oh yeah, much better.

1049
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:54,860
Well, I'm not going to let my daughter be raised by a couple of single mothers.

1050
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,510
When there's a loving, stable home with two fathers.

1051
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,580
Single mothers?

1052
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,450
You just said, "single mothers".

1053
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,440
You mean like me?

1054
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:10,510
I wasn't talking about you, I wasn't even thinking about you. - Yeah, so what else is new.

1055
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:13,660
But I was a single mother. And guess what,

1056
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:17,640
even without a father, you still had enough sense to come in out of the rain.

1057
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,350
Sometimes. - That's not what I was talking about.

1058
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:23,590
Christ sakes, mom, could you stop misinterpreting? - Who's misinterpreting?

1059
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,780
All we're saying... - I know what you're saying, I speak the language,

1060
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:32,200
thank you very much! You think there's two of you, that you're better equipped to raise a kid.

1061
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,960
Let me tell you two experts something.

1062
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:40,140
Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a partner and enough money to stay home and raise their kids.

1063
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,700
Some of us had to work. Night and day!

1064
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,970
Sometimes till two in the fucking morning.

1065
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:49,360
So that our kids could have sneakers and jeans, and

1066
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,040
walkmans and go to the movies, just like all their friends.

1067
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:56,850
And while we were out there working, we were just hoping, and praying to God,

1068
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:59,760
they didn't get sick, or get in trouble.

1069
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,540
But we had no choice.

1070
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:06,370
We made whatever sacrifice we could for out kids' happiness.

1071
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,370
So, you two think you could do it better?

1072
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,450
All I gotta say is...

1073
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,050
good for you.

1074
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:28,900
I almost didn't recognize you since you gained all that weight!

1075
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:33,210
It's not that much. - I wish that I could gain weight like that.

1076
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:39,930
I try and I try and I eat, and I eat but no matter what I do, I just can't keep it on.

1077
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,940
Pity. - Chocolate? - I'm on a diet.

1078
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,750
Your hair is getting thinner.

1079
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:50,550
Look, whatever else is going on, I've always had a healthy head of hair.

1080
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:53,650
Well, I hate to contradict Mrs. Brawling,

1081
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:58,310
But the mirror only has one face and... you're looking at it.

1082
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,310
Shit!

1083
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,910
I'm getting bald!

1084
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:05,790
What do I do?!

1085
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,020
Convert to Judaism and wear a yarmulka?

1086
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,030
There's no use fighting it, sweatheart.

1087
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:17,610
I'm afraid age is the last trick any of us picks up.

1088
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:22,680
The problem is, after it fucks us, it doesn't leave.

1089
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:29,060
So if I were you, I'd stop singing the title song from "poor me" and accept it.

1090
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,060
Then what? Die?

1091
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,190
Or move to Palm Springs.

1092
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:36,630
Pour yourself a Martini and ogle the...

1093
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:39,610
Mexican boys.

1094
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:45,800
Now... what shall we do with this?

1095
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:49,980
Same old, same old?

1096
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:55,330
It doesn't matter how many of these weddings I do, I always get a lump in my throat and a tear in my eyes.

1097
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:57,880
Maybe it's allergies. What if everybody starts sneezing?

1098
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,530
You see, I told you, we should've had it indoors! - The only stifles today will be stifles of joy,

1099
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:05,400
from how lovely the bride looks. - I still think I should've left my hair down,

1100
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,630
my face looks too round, doesn't it? - It's the perfect frame for the perfect picture.

1101
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:12,610
You hear that, honey? - It's all an illusion, I'm a mess.

1102
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:15,630
Are those rain clouds? - I think that it's time to cue the wedding march.

1103
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,910
You need to relax.

1104
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,980
To my beautiful bride...

1105
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:30,110
From now on, you're my morning news, my evening news, and my special bulletin.

1106
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,990
Don, what a beautiful sentiment!

1107
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,320
Oh my God. Oh my God!

1108
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,460
Alright, places, everyb...

1109
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,370
I told you something would go wrong? Didn't I tell you there'll be a disaster?!

1110
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:45,830
My blouse! Look at me! How can I go out there? I can't. It's ruined!

1111
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,940
Everything is ruined!

1112
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:49,840
Take it off.

1113
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,470
Take it off. Take your blouse off, come on, be quick about it!

1114
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:55,470
Chop chop! - Okay...

1115
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,400
Oh my God.

1116
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:02,210
Go, go go go. - Going!

1117
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:11,360
I need a soup pot and two bottles of Bourgandy, please! Vits, vits!

1118
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,620
As fast as we can, people!

1119
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:16,210
You want a chicken too?!

1120
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:20,170
That's a hell of a time to make cocque au vin, two minutes before our wedding!

1121
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,000
Alright... - What the fuck are you doing?!

1122
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:29,150
Just because I didn't carry her doesn't mean I'm not her mother too.

1123
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:32,710
See the choo-choo go around the tracks, sonny boy? See it?

1124
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,060
Sure is fun.

1125
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:38,770
But after a while it gets monotonous and predictable,

1126
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:43,180
and that's when we throw off the shackles of convention and relinquish control,

1127
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:48,520
and cause senseless, tragic, disaster!

1128
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,760
Oh my... did you see that?

1129
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,650
Brian, what are you doing?

1130
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:57,580
I'm just teaching my son how to have fun. Well I wish you'd listen to what I'm saying.

1131
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:01,030
Just because I didn't carry her doesn't mean I'm not her mother too?

1132
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:06,310
I was there every step of the way. Impregnating her, coaching her, taking care of her...

1133
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:09,620
I even helped with the delivery. - So who says you're not?

1134
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,650
Michael.

1135
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,330
He's petitioning for joint custody. And 50 percent physical custody.

1136
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,300
Who the hell does he think he is, the father?

1137
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:22,750
The agreement was that he would always be a part of the baby's life,

1138
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,270
but Mel and I would raise her. - Together.

1139
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:28,930
Doesn't make any difference, we're still the same people. We're still Jenny Rebecca's parents.

1140
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:31,260
Well, he seems to feel differently.

1141
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:35,010
If only Melanie had been reasonable.

1142
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,610
Melanie?

1143
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:37,950
Our little Melanie?

1144
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,430
Reasonable? - Instead of trying to force him out.

1145
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,790
Now if he goes through with this, I'll be the one who's forced out.

1146
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,820
The court will say I am the one with no legal rights.

1147
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:53,740
It looks like your mommy is in quite a predicament. - Goddamn right she is.

1148
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,230
I can't believe what I mess my life has become.

1149
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,040
We've money.

1150
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:07,070
What I need is for you to talk to him.

1151
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,340
You're his best friend.

1152
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,850
Hey Gus!

1153
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:14,600
But it's okay, sonny boy.

1154
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:17,590
We will get it back on track.

1155
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:19,590
Wait, wait, wait...

1156
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,190
Here, flip the switch.

1157
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,060
That's should just about do it.

1158
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,560
Just take that please, thank you, thank you, and we're here...

1159
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:34,100
Perfect, here we go, and one...

1160
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,800
and two... there!

1161
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,400
It even matches your bouquet!

1162
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:43,790
Thank you, thank you... let's go, let's go! - You're a genious.

1163
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:47,870
I'm not a genious... aunt Lulu's the genious.

1164
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:53,570
See, I'm back at Hazlehurst when I was a boy, my Momma worked and scraped to buy me good white pants for church,

1165
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:58,870
Well, before we got there, I stole some boysenberry cobblers and, imagine the rest...

1166
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:02,250
Momma was just about to whoop me, but aunt Lulu saved the day.

1167
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,400
She picked a mass of boysenberries, made some boysenberry juice,

1168
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,860
and next Sunday I had the most fabulous purple pants for the church.

1169
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,960
Which I of course accessorized with a yellow sweater and a pink scarf.

1170
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,650
That's a hell of a story.

1171
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:18,340
When I got my fairy wings, I learned how to turn a diaster into something beautiful.

1172
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:22,630
Now you two walk down that aisle, and live happily ever after.

1173
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,210
Come on honey, there's no back room here, so I guess it's off to my place!

1174
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,430
Last time I looked, there was a back room at Babylon.

1175
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:11,330
Brian, hey... we were planning to stop by later.

1176
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:14,260
Why not now? Avoid the crowds.

1177
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:20,620
Look, it's not my fault the herd's moved on. All the hot guys come here now.

1178
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,290
Look at that one... just look at him!

1179
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:28,850
Tired old queen, desperately trying to hold on to...

1180
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:39,560
Teddy?

1181
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,880
Had to, Theodore?

1182
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,990
Brian, what are you doing here?

1183
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:04,260
Checking out the competition.

1184
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,260
Me too.

1185
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,660
Is that why you're in disguise?

1186
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,140
My new look.

1187
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,680
I was going for something newer, hipper.

1188
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:19,600
I'm trying to bring them back to Babylon, not scare them away.

1189
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:26,240
Well, you'd better do it fast or you're gonna lose your pants.

1190
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,240
Might as well start now.

1191
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,050
Like that? - Oh yeah.

1192
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:25,870
How was your flight?

1193
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:41,840
Okay. Let's try this again.

1194
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:52,720
Christ! What's going on in here, you can hear her crying halfway around the block!

1195
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,260
Colic. She's been up all night.

1196
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,390
Oh. She got that from Michael.

1197
01:16:57,390 --> 01:17:02,260
I knew he'd turn out gay, he was a screamer from the day he arrived. Come here honeybun...

1198
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,660
Honeybun is what I used to call Michael.

1199
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:13,800
Look, you really shouldn't be here. Considering he plans to sue me for custody.

1200
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:16,520
You still haven't learned, have you.

1201
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:20,190
We have a child here, with a problem.

1202
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,820
You got a hot water bottle?

1203
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,780
In the kitchen, I think.

1204
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,050
Fill it.

1205
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,040
With warm water!

1206
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:36,160
Grandma is going to make it alright, yes she is...

1207
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:42,470
I know it hurts, I know it hurts honey.

1208
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:44,360
Where's Mommy?

1209
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,480
Debbie... I know you want to see your granddaughter,

1210
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:02,090
and I appreciate your help, but... - But? What?

1211
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:06,800
Until this thing's settled... - As far as I'm concerned, it already is.

1212
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:11,360
The three of you carrying on, each of you wanting a piece of this poor child, that's shameful.

1213
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,910
It's worse than that king.

1214
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,360
You know the one, Solomon.

1215
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,400
But the bottom line...

1216
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:25,110
I say a baby belongs with its mother.

1217
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,210
You do.

1218
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:31,260
Maybe it's because I'm a mother.

1219
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:33,570
A single mother.

1220
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:40,760
And anyone who isn't and never has been, doesn't have a clue how tough that is, and that includes my son.

1221
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,880
So whatever I can to do help, I'm here.

1222
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:49,660
Thank you for being on my side.

1223
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:51,660
Now, hear this.

1224
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:57,030
The only one whose side I'm on is my granddaughter's.

1225
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,910
Isn't that right, honeybun?

1226
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,040
So tiny.

1227
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,170
I hated it out there.

1228
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:13,260
The weather never changes! All anybody talks about it the business.

1229
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:15,400
If you don't have a go project, you're invisible.

1230
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,380
Yeah yeah, as they say in the movies, cut to the chase. The guys are hot!

1231
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,980
Yeah, except after a while they all start to look the same.

1232
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:25,300
Perfect hair. Perfect teeth. Perfect body. - Sounds perfectly aweful.

1233
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:29,100
And you can not trust anyone or believe anything anybody ever says.

1234
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,120
Everybody's just looking out for themselves and their careers.

1235
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,870
Yeah, sounds exactly like what you always hear about L.A...

1236
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:39,350
a lot of shallow superficial assholes, desperately trying to be what they're not.

1237
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:42,340
Hey Deb...

1238
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:43,980
Can I get a soup spoon?

1239
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:46,650
Sure can, honey, they're all by the counter. Help yourself.

1240
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:49,270
You're lucky you got out of there in one piece, baby.

1241
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,290
So much for Rage, the movie.

1242
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:53,290
So much for Rage, the money!

1243
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:57,300
It's okay, we'll be find. You know it's just as well that they didn't make it.

1244
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:01,240
And you were right, by the time they'd have finished it, Rage would have wound up straight.

1245
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,170
At least we still have the comic.

1246
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:05,930
Our comic.

1247
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:08,390
And most important, you're back with us, where you belong.

1248
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:10,440
Yeah, what are you going to do now, really?

1249
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,960
Never had much chance to think about it.

1250
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,890
Don't you worry, baby. Your old job is still here waiting for you,

1251
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:19,530
you can start busting tables any time you want.

1252
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:28,300
So... would you like to slit your throat now, or after we have coffee?

1253
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:37,340
Emmett! Welcome to channel 5 news.

1254
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:41,640
Everyone is still raving about the wedding. Lila's friends want to know where she got that blouse,

1255
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,320
said they never saw such a beautiful color.

1256
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,690
Well, I'm just relieved everything worked out alright.

1257
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:49,820
If there's anything I can do for you... your next wedding... - Actually, there is.

1258
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:54,150
I watched you day after day through this entire event.

1259
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,400
You did?

1260
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:58,990
And I have a little proposition to make.

1261
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,790
You do.

1262
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:03,130
I want you, Emmett.

1263
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,310
What is it with me and straight men...

1264
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:12,700
Mr. McGruder, I'm very flattered... but you're a married man now.

1265
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,740
What the hell are you... you don't think I...

1266
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,290
Please, no....

1267
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,210
Well you did say you wanted me. - For the news team.

1268
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,120
As what? Sports commentator? Weather girl?

1269
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,700
Either way I think you'd be terribly disappointed.

1270
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:34,920
Listen, I don't have to tell you, queer is very hot right now. Everybody wants the gay perspective.

1271
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,090
What do the gays think about fashion, cooking, decorating?

1272
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:41,610
Like you said, that little fairy magic that gives us straights a little twist.

1273
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:44,580
And you want me to... - To do a new segment.

1274
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:47,240
Offer us the gay point of view.

1275
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,890
Give us some tips, do some makeovers.

1276
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:54,050
I.. I've never... - After that magic act you performed at our wedding, you can do anything.

1277
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:58,020
That include being channel 5's queer guy.

1278
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:09,570
Without the lights and the music and the hot guys, it's just a room, isn't it.

1279
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:11,060
It's all an illusion.

1280
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:14,320
Nothing but cheap theatrics.

1281
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,620
Sorry about your baby.

1282
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:17,380
Jenny?

1283
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,990
Rage. - Oh, that.

1284
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,550
Right now I got more important things to think about.

1285
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:26,860
So why the urgent message on my cell?

1286
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,670
I want you to leave Melanie and Lindsey alone.

1287
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:38,240
They have enough shit to work out right now without you sticking your bulldog, or should I say, bulldyke laywer on them.

1288
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:41,690
What the fuck business is it of yours if I want to hire a lawyer?

1289
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:45,390
Who the fuck are you to... - Gus's father, that's who the fuck I am.

1290
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:48,380
You had to lose a ball before you even knew he was alive!

1291
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,880
I'm sorry, that was a...

1292
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,430
uncalled for remark. It's just that...

1293
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:02,620
because they're your son's parents too, I thought you'd understand.

1294
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:07,550
What I understand, is that if you go through with this, Lindsey's going to be the one that's left out.

1295
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:09,340
She's going to be the one that gets fucked over.

1296
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:13,070
Well, she should've thought of that before she cheated on Mel and lied to me!

1297
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:16,980
Christ, would you give it a rest already? We all know the story.

1298
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:21,340
Why don't you stop defending her for a change and try defending me, your best friend?

1299
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:26,220
Right now, the best thing for Jenny Rebecca is to be with Ben and me,

1300
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:30,170
in a stable home, not being passed back and forth between two battling lesbians.

1301
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,290
When did you change?

1302
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:36,260
What?

1303
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:40,620
When did you become this pious, sanctimonious, judgemental twit?

1304
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:44,420
The point is not...

1305
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,920
when did I change.

1306
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,910
The point is, why haven't you.

1307
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,380
When are you going to stop being some...

1308
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,970
over the hill club boy, and grow up?

1309
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:56,340
So now I'm the object of your disapproval too.

1310
01:23:58,230 --> 01:24:00,250
You and the nutty professor get married,

1311
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:02,580
in fucking Canada,

1312
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,190
you move to Stepford Avenue with all the...

1313
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:07,270
other ersatz heterosexuals.

1314
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:11,650
And suddently that gives you the right to make pronouncements on everybody else's life?

1315
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:17,260
Upside of your perfect marriage, Mikey... it's called gay divorce.

1316
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:22,110
Fags and dykes can fuck up their lives just like the rest of the world.

1317
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,310
I'm just trying to do what's best for my daughter.

1318
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:28,310
And protect my rights.

1319
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,260
I'm sorry you can't see that.

1320
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,770
Just call me...

1321
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:08,980
the queer guy.

1322
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:12,280
Wouldn't that be like calling the pope "the catholic guy"?

1323
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:16,920
Don McGruder, the producer of the channel 5 news I've just did his wedding,

1324
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,150
wants me to join the news team. I am returning to the cameras.

1325
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:25,850
This time, with my clothes on. I'm going to be channel 5's queer guy.

1326
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:29,660
Sharing tips, making quips, and generally showing Pittsburgh how to be fabulous.

1327
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:31,660
You can start by showing me.

1328
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:36,630
My hair, my gut, my face...

1329
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:40,730
God, I look like a Sharpei. - There is nothing wrong with the way you look.

1330
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:44,740
Would you stop being a friend and be honest? - I am being honest!

1331
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:46,390
Come here. Come here!

1332
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:51,930
Look at yourself. Your true self.

1333
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:54,690
The self that kicked crystal.

1334
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:59,330
That completed the Liberty Ride, that got a great job. You turned your life around, Teddy.

1335
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:03,100
And that is something to be very, very proud of. You're practically a hero.

1336
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:08,030
Okay so who cares if you put on a few pounds, or have a few character lines.

1337
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:12,190
Stop looking at the shell... and see the pearl.

1338
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,310
You're right, Em.

1339
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,100
You're so right.

1340
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:25,820
It did sound good, didn't it. Maybe I can use it on my segment.

1341
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:27,380
Well,

1342
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:32,410
this queer guy's gotta get to the gym and then get some beauty rest.

1343
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:37,340
Camera's merciless, you know. Shows every line and immediately adds ten pounds.

1344
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,770
I'll see you baby!

1345
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:40,210
Thanks Em...

1346
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:44,100
Hey, you're going to make a great queer guy. You already are.

1347
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,490
Can't help it!

1348
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:09,820
Hi, yes, my name is Ted Schmidt,

1349
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:13,130
and I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor.

1350
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,090
Be right with you.

1351
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:25,930
My attorney advised me not to talk to you.

1352
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:30,330
Well, I'm an attorney too, and I'd say she's being overly cautious.

1353
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,060
After all, we're friends.

1354
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,060
Family.

1355
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,060
Are we?

1356
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:40,170
I'm sure we can work this out.

1357
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:44,640
Save ourselves a lot of grief, and legal expenses. Which if I know anything about lawyers,

1358
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,080
this is why she doesn't want us communicating.

1359
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,180
Look. I admit. I overreacted.

1360
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:57,360
I was just being protective, the way any mother would. You can understand that.

1361
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:05,290
There's no question you're part of Jenny Rebecca's life!

1362
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,710
It's just that she's still young.

1363
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:09,710
She's still breastfeeding.

1364
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:15,380
I was thinking that maybe later on down the road, maybe when she's four or five,

1365
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:19,210
she could spend some time with you and Ben, I think that's perfectly reasonable.

1366
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:20,920
Don't you?

1367
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:26,470
How dumb do you think I am?

1368
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:30,650
No. Don't answer that, I can imagine.

1369
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:35,610
First you tell me I have no rights, which isn't true. I have as much rights as you.

1370
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:39,830
Now you try to get me to agree not to take her until she's four or five?

1371
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:44,950
I'm sorry Mel, I'm not backing off.

1372
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:47,120
I can't believe you're doing this!

1373
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,880
After we stood right here in your store and agreed that you could be the father,

1374
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,570
instead of just a sperm donor. - Then why won't you let me have her?

1375
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,910
Cause you don't know shit about raising a baby! Even your own mother agrees.

1376
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:59,550
My mother? - Yes, she thinks you're behaving like an asshole.

1377
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,030
Oh really?

1378
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:05,520
You know what? I don't give a flying fuck what my mother thinks.

1379
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:09,010
Jenny Rebecca is my daughter too, and I'm going to have joint custody.

1380
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,630
Then you go ahead and try.

1381
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:16,390
But let me tell you, you're not only up against one angry mother,

1382
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:20,610
and lesbian. You're up against one pissed off lawyer.

1383
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,040
So...

1384
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,660
was it all you remembered?

1385
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,390
And more.

1386
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:21,120
What about you?

1387
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:25,990
It was... okay.

1388
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:28,970
Just okay.

1389
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:30,970
It was great.

1390
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:35,730
Say it was great. Say it was great! Say it!

1391
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:39,520
It was great, it was great, it was great.

1392
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,450
It was great.

1393
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:45,070
It was. It was great.

1394
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:51,580
I thought you're never coming back.

1395
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:55,110
I figured.

1396
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:59,010
Why would you?

1397
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,160
Can't imagine.

1398
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:36,090
What's this?

1399
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,450
It's one of my storyboards from the movie.

1400
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,450
It's good.

1401
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,070
Thanks.

1402
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:57,190
What?

1403
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:58,360
Nothing.

1404
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:06,690
I told everyone how shitty it was out there.

1405
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,330
How stupid everyone was.

1406
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,190
Truth is, I loved it.

1407
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:16,700
I know...

1408
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:21,950
It was hot. It was fun, it was exciting.

1409
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,550
We were going to change the world. The world's first gay superhero.

1410
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,590
Well, it's over.

1411
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,690
Now you're back.

1412
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:53,100
Must be quite a let down after all that.

1413
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:00,770
There's still one thing Pittsburgh has that Hollywood doesn't.

1414
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:12,990
That is, if the offer still stands.

1415
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:23,990
