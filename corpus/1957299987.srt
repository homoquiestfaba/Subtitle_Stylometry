00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,742
[Woman] Hello?

4
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,514
Hello?

5
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,416
[Man] Hey.

6
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,820
[woman screaming] - Stay away
from me! Stay away from me!

7
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,764
[Man] How many
of you can hear me?

8
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,369
Why is everyone quiet
all of a sudden?

9
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,970
How many of you are there?

10
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,672
[Woman] I'm here.

11
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,806
I'm here.

12
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,844
[Man] Look, I'm not
here to hurt anyone, okay?

13
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,879
Okay, I just woke up here.

14
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,281
I don't know what's going on.

15
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,783
I'm just trying to
figure this out, okay?

16
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,219
[Woman] Okay.

17
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,854
I don't know where I am either.

18
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,492
[Man] What's the last
thing you remember?

19
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,127
I don't know.

20
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,761
My head hurts.

21
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,099
Me too, just try to remember.

22
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,137
[Woman] I was home.

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,076
Then the last thing I remember.

24
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,412
I'm freezing.

25
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,117
[Man] It's okay.

26
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,355
I'm wearing a jacket.

27
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,489
I'll give it to you.

28
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,325
Follow the sound
of my voice, okay?

29
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,128
[Woman] Okay.

30
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,231
[Man] Can you walk?

31
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:45,732
I'm coming toward you.

32
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:46,766
I can't see

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,701
Okay, I'm coming to you.

34
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,473
[woman screaming]

35
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,375
Sorry.

36
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,543
[Woman] That's my hand.

37
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,244
[Man] Sorry.

38
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,147
At least I found you.
There's two of us.

39
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,152
I'm giving you my
jacket, put it on.

40
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,127
I heard at least two
other voices before.

41
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,894
Where are you?

42
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,865
- Hello?
- Please don't leave me.

43
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,701
[Man] Where are
you, say something.

44
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,936
Anyone remember anything?

45
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,971
Anyone see a light or anything?

46
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,975
I just woke up here in darkness.

47
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,910
Just keep talking
so I can find you.

48
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:31,945
[Woman] Don't leave me.

49
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,113
I'm scared, please.

50
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,240
- [man screaming]
- What the hell?

51
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,991
[ominous music]

52
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,079
Where are we?

53
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:45,085
[dial clicking]

54
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,323
Hey! [pounding on door]

55
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,025
Can anyone hear me?

56
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,163
Whoa.

57
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,387
Hey, give me that.

58
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,592
And why would I
want to do that?

59
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,297
Fine, take it.

60
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,152
[shouting]

61
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,487
What's wrong with him?

62
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,890
I don't know, maybe
something they drugged us with.

63
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,634
You're okay.

64
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,604
What?

65
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,107
[Man] Just calm down.

66
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,141
We all just woke up here too.

67
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,609
We're not gonna hurt you.

68
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,448
[axe dragging on ground]

69
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,084
- Stay back.
- Just take it easy, man.

70
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,200
- [slam]
- Hey!

71
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,436
[door knocking]

72
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,238
Let me out of here!

73
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,383
Hey, are you okay?

74
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,456
Are you pregnant?

75
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,525
Yeah.

76
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,701
I already tried that.

77
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,404
Hey, she's fucking pregnant.

78
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,142
Someone give her their weapon.

79
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,713
Give her your machete.

80
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,382
Wait a minute.

81
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,419
Give that pregnant
lady your machete.

82
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:34,721
Why?

83
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,726
Because a girl with
a gun told you to.

84
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:45,032
Give it to her, I'm not
going to say it again.

85
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,100
Okay, okay.

86
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,671
I'm not the enemy here.

87
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:54,441
Thank you.

88
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:59,480
Just everybody watch where
they point those things.

89
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,449
Come on.

90
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:06,253
[slam] Hey, somebody
let me out of here!

91
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,825
Please, please stop, please.

92
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,461
Hey man, knock it off!

93
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,367
Just calm down.

94
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,141
Hey!

95
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,411
Man, knock it off! Why
don't you come over here?

96
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,179
[slam]

97
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,082
[loud noise blaring]

98
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,493
[ominous music]

99
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,434
[static buzzing]

100
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,137
I see.

101
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,407
You found the tools.

102
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,575
Good.

103
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,745
But tools are nothing

104
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,214
until you learn how to use them.

105
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,181
Where are we?

106
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,516
Why are we here?

107
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,652
To find out who we
really are, Sean.

108
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,121
Wait, how do you know my name?

109
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,323
I know a lot about you.

110
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:20,327
And I want to know
more about all of you.

111
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,331
Oh god, this is
too fucking crazy.

112
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,401
I gotta get out of here,
gotta get fucking out of here.

113
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,203
Somebody let me out of here!

114
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,806
Richard, pay attention.

115
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,842
I am going to tell you
how you can get out.

116
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,845
Okay, I'm listening.

117
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,082
My name is Dr. Kasuma,

118
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,785
and this is my experiment.

119
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,423
On this screen, you will
see a person who is trapped.

120
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,526
You can free that person
very easily and yourself.

121
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,631
All you have to do is
kill someone in this room.

122
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,767
That's crazy.

123
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,871
Tracey, what is your maternal
instinct telling you to do?

124
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:07,307
My instinct is telling
me that you're sick

125
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,643
and I don't want to
play your little game.

126
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,611
That's fine.

127
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:17,117
But I guarantee someone
else will play eventually.

128
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,891
None of us are gonna decide
to kill someone in this room.

129
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,226
No?

130
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,662
You are all strangers.

131
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,966
But this woman, she
is someone one of you

132
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:36,470
will miss very, very much.

133
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,907
Sarah, Sarah.

134
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,345
She is safe for now,
but not for long.

135
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,848
Are you willing to do what
it takes to free your wife

136
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,616
and yourself, Richard?

137
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,187
Olivia, you have
tools in your hand.

138
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:58,525
You can free yourself and you
can leave anytime you want.

139
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,030
Please, I don't want to
be here anymore, please!

140
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:06,566
No, no, no, no, Olivia,
begging does you no good.

141
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,837
First person to kill
someone here leaves.

142
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:14,042
By killing first, you'll
save your own life

143
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,942
and that of someone else.

144
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,646
You can walk right out the door

145
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:23,017
but you have to
earn that privilege.

146
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:28,655
Alice, I see you found
a very powerful tool.

147
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,460
I hope you use it wisely.

148
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,201
You have until the
timer goes off to

149
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:46,673
decide if this woman lives or
dies, save her and yourself.

150
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,547
Sarah, talk to
me, where are you?

151
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,549
Can you hear my voice?

152
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,984
Kill someone and we live.

153
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,419
Why?

154
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,888
I mean, how can we
even believe her?

155
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,356
You will believe me, L,

156
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,859
because you have
no other choice.

157
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,962
When the timer runs out

158
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:12,365
the lights will go out
and one of you must die.

159
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,283
Just calm down, man.

160
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,651
You're not making any sense.

161
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,887
Just relax and calm down
while we try to think.

162
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,090
You just want me
to fucking relax?

163
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:37,491
You want me to relax?

164
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,259
They have my wife's
somewhere in a cell,

165
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,428
and you want me to relax?

166
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,634
Oh God, Sarah.

167
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,374
Your wife is okay, Richard.

168
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:55,942
My wife is okay.

169
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:57,744
Oh, is she?

170
00:12:58,979 --> 00:12:59,913
She's okay?

171
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,249
All good.

172
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,150
Good, that's good.

173
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,283
That's good.

174
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,417
You think she's okay?

175
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:05,585
Fuck you!

176
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,463
Do you recognize that
woman in the screen?

177
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,531
I've never seen that woman.

178
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,999
I think she's trying to say is

179
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,535
are you in on this whole thing?

180
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,903
What do you know?

181
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:24,638
Are you part of that
lady's experiment?

182
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:27,541
I've never seen that woman.

183
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,976
Look, you two look
an awful lot alike.

184
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:33,380
Am I suppose to think that's
a fucking coincidence?

185
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,283
It's not that much
of a coincidence.

186
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,716
there is a whole fucking,

187
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,451
That's too much of
a coincidence for me!

188
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,520
Look, Olivia is in here
with all of us, okay?

189
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,589
How could she be in on it?

190
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,858
Something's not right
about her being here.

191
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,861
Nothing is right
about any of this.

192
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,531
We have to try to get out of
here any way that we can, okay?

193
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,202
Let's try prying the door
open with your hatchet.

194
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,369
Richard, we could use your ax.

195
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:59,040
Richard, please, come on.

196
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,841
Stay the fuck away from me.

197
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,418
[grunting]

198
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,594
You should cover your
ears in there little one.

199
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,395
I'm gonna get you out of here.

200
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,734
Can you hear me, anything?

201
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,577
Gimme that gun, we
gotta shoot the lock off!

202
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,247
No way, this gun is mine.

203
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,914
Get your own.

204
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:44,651
I'm not playing, give
me that fucking gun.

205
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,154
Fuck you.

206
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:49,689
What part of gun beats knife

207
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,893
and every other weapon in this
room don't you understand?

208
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:54,728
Come on, you don't have
to take the gun from her.

209
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,397
She can shoot the
lock off herself.

210
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,632
Alice, right?

211
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,967
Look, I'm unarmed.

212
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:05,273
If we can get this door open,
we can all get out alive.

213
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,875
Why do you keep acting
like you know everything?

214
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:13,647
We have no idea what's on
the other side of that door.

215
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,916
The only thing I know
for certain right now is

216
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,887
if I keep this gun,
I'm going to live.

217
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,492
I'm tired of your shit.

218
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,795
Do not make me take
that gun from you.

219
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:29,963
Go ahead.

220
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,465
You'll take a bullet
to the face too.

221
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,645
We don't have much time left.

222
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,646
What are you gonna do?

223
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,481
What is he going to do?

224
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:52,585
I'm not gonna do anything.

225
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,088
I'm not..

226
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,922
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

227
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,927
I bet you'd think different
if you had the gun.

228
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:04,698
Gun, ax, hatchet, I'm
not a fucking killer.

229
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,766
None of us deserve
to die right now

230
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,236
this is all just ridiculous.

231
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,938
Even to save her life?

232
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:13,207
Fucking pussy.

233
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,944
[whispering] You
don't fucking know me.

234
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:22,582
Stay back!

235
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,187
You don't know me.

236
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,554
None of you fucking know me.

237
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,789
None of you know me!

238
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,959
[Richard screaming]

239
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:46,240
So you'd rather kill any
of us? Murder is that easy?

240
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:49,176
Hey, this is all still
just hypothetical, right?

241
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,644
Till the timer runs out
and the lights go out...

242
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,750
This all could
be a game, right?

243
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,819
I mean, she keeps calling
this an experiment

244
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,789
like it's a psychological test.

245
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,226
I mean, there's no way that
she expects any one of us

246
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,460
to kill somebody in this room.

247
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,827
This is real.

248
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,131
There's nothing
hypothetical about it.

249
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:15,769
[sobbing]

250
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,040
Hey, are you okay?

251
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:22,309
Yeah, please just
stay away from me.

252
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,090
What do you expect
me to do then, huh?

253
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,225
What do you want me to do?

254
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,960
Hack one of these
people to death

255
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,164
In order for my wife to live?

256
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,898
Is that what you want?

257
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,300
What do you want from me?

258
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,701
Let me talk to my wife.

259
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,471
Let me talk to my wife.

260
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,705
Let me talk to my wife!

261
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:58,878
Richard?

262
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:03,117
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,
can you hear me?

263
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,920
[Sarah crying]

264
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,092
Who's there with you?

265
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:12,059
Are you alone?

266
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:14,228
Are they feeding you?

267
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,097
[Sarah crying]

268
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,897
Where are you?

269
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,804
I'm real close.

270
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:29,809
I know things haven't
been good in a long time

271
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,913
and I'm sorry, I know
I pushed you away,

272
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:38,085
and I just, if you
can get me out of here

273
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,224
I'll be so much better,
I'm sorry for everything.

274
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,092
I'm so sorry.

275
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:48,529
Just don't worry,
okay, just relax.

276
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,629
We're gonna get you out of there

277
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,798
and then we're gonna go home.

278
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,101
Okay, I can't wait.

279
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:55,668
[Sarah crying]

280
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,706
Oh God, Richard, I love you.

281
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:06,980
[ominous music]

282
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:11,718
Let me talk to my wife.

283
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,720
Let me fucking talk to my wife!

284
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,157
Let me talk to my wife!

285
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,760
If my wife dies, I'm not a
killer, I didn't do this,

286
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,397
I'm not, this isn't
me, I didn't kill her.

287
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:26,133
It's that fucked up woman
on TV, she's the killer.

288
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:27,934
She's the one that's
doing this, not me.

289
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:30,471
I didn't do this.

290
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:31,938
Somebody do something.

291
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:34,275
Stop the fucking ticking!

292
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:39,679
Somebody let me out
of here, please!

293
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,117
Somebody please
help me out of here!

294
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,351
No!

295
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:23,357
[tense music]
[heavy breathing]

296
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,195
[woman screaming]

297
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:41,741
Was that you screaming?

298
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,444
Are you alright?

299
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,380
Yeah, I didn't mean to scream.

300
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,083
I thought he was
coming toward me.

301
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:52,885
I didn't do it, are you happy?

302
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,488
Did you get your results?

303
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,391
Good, write them down.

304
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,994
Your experiment worked.

305
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,997
I'm not a killer, you got that?

306
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:06,367
Now open the door
and let us out.

307
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:11,171
Richard, you love your wife.

308
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,973
And she obviously loves
you very much too.

309
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:18,012
But you didn't love her
enough to save her, did you?

310
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:20,847
You know the
consequences of inaction.

311
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,250
But seeing is believing.

312
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:29,156
Richard, Richard,
please help me.

313
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,923
[running]

314
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:33,993
No, no, no, Sarah,
Sarah, Sarah, no.

315
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,262
What is that?

316
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:37,964
Richard, please help me!

317
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:39,667
Richard, where are you, help me!

318
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:44,004
[sobbing]

319
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:48,742
Richard, I can't breathe.

320
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,411
Sarah, focus.

321
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:52,146
Sarah, focus, there's gotta
be a way out of there, okay?

322
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,781
There's gotta be a
way out of there,

323
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,050
just look around, look around,
pound the walls, scream.

324
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,585
Is there a window, a door?

325
00:21:58,719 --> 00:21:59,787
Look over there.

326
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,854
Look, look, look, behind you.

327
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:05,858
Hello, Richard, help me.

328
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,500
Oh God, Sarah, I'm sorry.

329
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:16,704
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

330
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,039
[tense music]

331
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:17,030
I'm sorry, Richard,

332
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:20,267
but I don't like the
results of this experiment.

333
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:24,338
But tell me, why didn't you
do anything to save your wife?

334
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:32,312
I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

335
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:39,052
They say you don't know
what you have until it's gone.

336
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:40,788
Do you know what you
had now, Richard?

337
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,723
Okay, that's enough.

338
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,458
Richard, your wife isn't dead.

339
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,294
This is just another
part of their experiment.

340
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:49,630
And they just gassed her
the same way they did us

341
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,064
when they brought us here

342
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:53,300
Your wife is fine.

343
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:57,337
No Sean, his wife
is indeed dead.

344
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:01,175
I can provide more graphic
proof if you don't believe me.

345
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:03,644
That's enough, stop torturing
us and let us out of here.

346
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,680
This isn't torture,
this is a test.

347
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:09,683
Would you like me to show
you the difference, L?

348
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:10,784
This isn't a test.

349
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:13,187
This is sadism, you freak.

350
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,090
Please, please, just
let us go, please.

351
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:20,227
There's one way out
of here for you.

352
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,397
Follow the rules
of the experiment.

353
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,712
Crazy bitch has my sister!

354
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:42,249
Whoa, whoa, calm down, watch
where you point that thing.

355
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:45,185
Why, I might kill someone?

356
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,389
Have you fuckers been
paying attention?

357
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:54,328
They're going to kill my sister
if I don't kill one of you.

358
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:59,366
The only question now is which
one of you deserves to die?

359
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,567
You?

360
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,369
Don't you point that
fucking thing at me.

361
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:03,470
You?

362
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:05,606
You?

363
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,477
Or him?

364
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:14,715
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

365
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,551
We don't know if anybody
is actually dead yet.

366
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,385
You're right.

367
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,287
That's actually possible.

368
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,857
The gas, maybe they just knocked
her out for a little while

369
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:25,592
the same way they did us.

370
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:29,496
No, she's gone.

371
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:32,366
She's gone.

372
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,570
I saw her face.

373
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,040
Oh, it's my fault.

374
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:42,242
No, it's not your fault.

375
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,178
She knew that you loved her

376
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,282
and you were there
for her when she died.

377
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:49,750
What does it matter?

378
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,686
We're not growing old together.

379
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,321
We're not having a family.

380
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,093
She's dead. Period.

381
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,062
The end.

382
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:03,530
That's it.

383
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:10,304
You stay away from me.

384
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:12,706
Just leave me alone, okay?

385
00:26:15,043 --> 00:26:18,145
Just put it away, there
has to be another solution.

386
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:19,780
Look at him.

387
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:23,383
Ask him and his wife if
there's another solution.

388
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:25,886
Alice, put the gun
down, you're not a killer.

389
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,021
I'm not.

390
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:28,455
No! You're not a killer!

391
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,358
Fuck you, you don't
know anything about me

392
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,795
and I don't know
anything about you.

393
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:37,130
Why would I choose
any of your lives

394
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,766
over the life of my sister?

395
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,702
Just hold on a second, okay?

396
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:44,338
Look, you've got a gun and
there's still time left.

397
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,707
Let's just take a second
and talk things out, okay?

398
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,575
Fine, talk!

399
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,644
Just stay back.

400
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,316
Okay, so what?

401
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,120
What, I'm supposed to
have all the answers?

402
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:03,624
I just want us to talk before
things get out of control.

403
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:06,994
Things are already
out of control.

404
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,564
Alright, so what do we know?

405
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:13,266
That lady can see
us and hear us.

406
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,571
So any escape attempt
that we might try to do.

407
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:22,010
Look, there's no
way they could get us

408
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,543
in this room by themself.

409
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:26,780
There's gotta be more
people outside that door.

410
00:27:30,051 --> 00:27:33,487
[pounding on door]

411
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,156
I can't hear anything.

412
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,328
I can't hear anyone out here.

413
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:49,636
She knows.

414
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,506
Me?

415
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:56,643
Tell us, how many of your
friends are out there?

416
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,179
I already told you,

417
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:00,914
I was forced into
this room same as you,

418
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,382
I have nothing to do with this.

419
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:03,717
Maybe you do, maybe you don't,

420
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,653
I know the fastest
way to find out.

421
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:09,023
Stop it, alright,

422
00:28:09,157 --> 00:28:12,292
we have to work together if
we want to get out of here.

423
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:17,631
Wait, wait, if they had his
wife and they have your sister

424
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:20,168
it makes sense that
they have someone

425
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,735
that each of us cares about.

426
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:24,538
Tracey's right.

427
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:26,907
They got us and our loved ones.

428
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:34,548
So, so where, where are
they keeping them, huh?

429
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:35,882
Here?

430
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:37,918
In the same building
or somewhere else?

431
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:40,154
Just no way of knowing.

432
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:42,156
We don't even know
where we are right now.

433
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,824
What does it all mean?

434
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:45,926
I mean, what does that doctor
lady, what does she want?

435
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,360
You know what she wants,

436
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:49,296
she wants me to kill
someone in this room!

437
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,465
And if this is an experiment,

438
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:54,367
there has to be
a way to beat it.

439
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:57,004
They tell us that they
want us to kill someone

440
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,438
but that can't be the answer.

441
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:00,373
They must be looking
for something.

442
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:01,942
What are they trying to find?

443
00:29:02,076 --> 00:29:03,710
They want to see
us act like animals!

444
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:08,281
They're using people we
love to manipulate us.

445
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:15,555
If I kill one person, I
get out of here alive.

446
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:17,491
My sister gets out too,

447
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:19,693
now that sounds like a
way better deal to me

448
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,996
than dying in here with
a bunch of strangers.

449
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:25,565
Hey, just wait a minute.

450
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:27,601
This isn't about love.

451
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:31,139
That doctor lady, she's
playing us like rats.

452
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,607
She wants to see us fight.

453
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,812
Yeah, and I'm about
to end this game.

454
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:43,517
[ominous music]

455
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:50,590
Should have killed one of you,

456
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:52,793
I could've been
with her right now.

457
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:55,495
You couldn't kill for your wife.

458
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:59,233
That doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

459
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:01,635
No, it just means I'm weak.

460
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:06,973
Come on, go ahead, go
ahead, shoot me, come on.

461
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:19,253
- Stay back.
- Go on, shoot me.

462
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:23,390
- Come on, come on, do it.
- Stay back.

463
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:26,359
Shoot me, I'm volunteering.

464
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,361
Save your sister.

465
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,570
Save your sister, save yourself.

466
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:38,438
Get out of here and end this.

467
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:40,740
Richard, you don't
mean that, don't do it.

468
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:49,649
You don't have to do this.

469
00:30:54,055 --> 00:30:56,723
Do you want to see her
dead in front of you?

470
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:59,826
- Just do it.
- Don't do it.

471
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,063
- Do it.
- Don't do it.

472
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:03,797
Hurry!

473
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,032
Do it.

474
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,567
- Let him go, Alice.
- Stop!

475
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:11,172
Just do it, shoot,
shoot, come on.

476
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:13,274
Do it, come on, do it, I'm
volunteering, just shoot me.

477
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:18,778
Do it, come on, do it, I'm
volunteering, just shoot me.

478
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:25,986
Natalie?

479
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,866
Come on, pull the
fucking trigger.

480
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:50,610
Do it, do it now.

481
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:52,612
Come on, you can do it.

482
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:55,149
Pull the motherfucking trigger.

483
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,055
[gunshot]

484
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:11,898
[gunshot]

485
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:24,345
[gunshot]

486
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:27,714
[screaming]

487
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:30,251
Are you fucking kidding me?!

488
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:34,788
[crying]

489
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:38,658
[gun drops]

490
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,832
[ominous music]

491
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:50,737
Look at you now.

492
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,740
You don't have shit,
just like the rest of us.

493
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,077
You're stuck here.

494
00:32:58,012 --> 00:32:59,946
And your sister's gonna die.

495
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,929
Fucking die!

496
00:33:31,145 --> 00:33:33,813
[screaming]

497
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:40,154
No, no, help me, help me!

498
00:33:42,922 --> 00:33:45,592
I don't wanna die,
please help me!

499
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:47,261
Please help me.

500
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,304
You stabbed her!

501
00:33:57,438 --> 00:34:00,940
No, no, I just took the
machete, I needed a weapon!

502
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,210
You did this.

503
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:06,447
I didn't do it, he did it.

504
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:08,182
I didn't touch her!

505
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:10,850
Then why are you bleeding?

506
00:34:10,984 --> 00:34:12,319
You tell me, I wasn't
the one that touched her.

507
00:34:12,453 --> 00:34:15,955
[shouting]

508
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:21,594
Come on guys, help her!

509
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,265
Alice, please, you
have to save her.

510
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,033
You have to save my baby.

511
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:28,536
Please help me.

512
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:31,038
Alice, you better
fucking help her.

513
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:34,774
Please, anybody help me.

514
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:38,312
We can't, it's either
her or my sister,

515
00:34:38,446 --> 00:34:40,747
I can't, she's gotta die.

516
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,416
Get away from her!

517
00:34:43,384 --> 00:34:46,387
Alice, I know
you're a good person

518
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,854
and I don't blame you for this.

519
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:50,690
I don't blame you, but your
sister's gonna be fine.

520
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:51,891
But my baby.

521
00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:54,562
Tracey, your baby is dead!

522
00:34:54,694 --> 00:34:57,164
No, no, no, not yet.

523
00:34:57,298 --> 00:34:59,400
No, just help me.

524
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:02,236
Please just help me!

525
00:35:03,404 --> 00:35:06,806
Please, she needs a doctor,
she's fucking pregnant!

526
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,176
Come on, have some decency!

527
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:14,781
Alice, I trust you, I trust you.

528
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:17,684
I need you to save her.

529
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:20,287
[mumbling]

530
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,891
What's her name?

531
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:27,061
I don't know, we were waiting

532
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:29,996
until she was born to name her.

533
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:31,698
But, um

534
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:33,967
um maybe Rose.

535
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:47,047
Help her.

536
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:51,818
Alice, Alice, you
can't let her die.

537
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:57,757
You can do anything
what you want.

538
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:02,062
Wait

539
00:36:03,763 --> 00:36:06,733
Okay, okay, what can I do?

540
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:12,139
You need the smallest,
sharpest weapon in here.

541
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,378
Where's the knife, where's
the knife, give it to me.

542
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,513
[L] Shit, you just had it.

543
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:23,617
- Then do it for her!
- Give her your knife.

544
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,153
Just give it to her, man.

545
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:31,691
Give her your fucking knife!

546
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,168
Now what?

547
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:47,141
Okay, okay, you're going to
have to listen to me because

548
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:50,843
once you start, I'm not
going be able to help you.

549
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:55,416
You're going to have
to cut horizontally

550
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:57,917
across my pelvis and then

551
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:00,120
you're gonna to have
to pull her out.

552
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:04,458
How will I know where to cut?

553
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:10,231
I have a scar from my son.

554
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,070
- I'm gonna do it, okay?
- Okay, okay.

555
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:28,282
[Tracey screaming]

556
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,817
I'll take care of her, okay?

557
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,386
I'm gonna make sure she's okay!

558
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,288
No one's gonna touch her.

559
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,090
Okay, I trust
you, I trust you.

560
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:39,226
I'm gonna reach in to
get the baby out, okay?

561
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:44,231
Is she okay?

562
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,367
She's fine.

563
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:52,239
Hold your baby girl.

564
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:04,251
[crying]

565
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:30,644
So we fix our eyes
not on what is seen,

566
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:33,846
but on what is unseen,

567
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,251
for what is seen is temporary,

568
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:41,155
but what is unseen is eternal

569
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,109
[Dr. K] That was a
nice effort, Alice.

570
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:05,145
Too bad, you couldn't
save Tracey's baby

571
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:07,548
or your poor sister.

572
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:08,515
What?

573
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,320
The kill needs to happen
before the lights come on.

574
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:16,056
I didn't do this,
but she's dead.

575
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,558
That's not right.

576
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:20,927
This is all an experiment.

577
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:23,263
There's no right or
wrong here, Alice.

578
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:26,400
I only want to learn
from the best result.

579
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:28,135
Alice, can you hear me?

580
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:30,170
Please, I'm scared.

581
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:40,114
Alice, come and get
me out of here, Alice.

582
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,485
You're still gonna kill
her sister after all this?

583
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:47,054
By failing to
follow instructions,

584
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,323
all of you killed her sister.

585
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:51,358
You're a monster.

586
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:57,631
You are the monster,
Sean. Don't you see?

587
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:58,931
You all are.

588
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:02,236
My experiment is
only proving that.

589
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:04,204
And the result from
this experiment

590
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:07,241
will change the way we
all think about humanity,

591
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:12,579
morality, life, love
and of course, death.

592
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:16,983
You can't turn me
into a murderer.

593
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:22,723
She's dead, please, she's gone.

594
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:24,258
Please just spare my sister.

595
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:26,993
You gave me fucking blanks.

596
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:28,896
I'm trying to kill!

597
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:33,534
[shouting]
[coughing]

598
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:37,538
Your excuses are
unacceptable, Alice.

599
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,343
Natalie, can you hear me?

600
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:47,080
[coughing]

601
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:50,184
I can't help you.

602
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:52,519
I can't help either of us.

603
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:54,021
I'm so sorry.

604
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,990
You know me, I can't
do anything right.

605
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:04,031
It's okay, Allie,
I know you're good.

606
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:06,433
I know you've been
looking out for me.

607
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:09,536
You've always been so
much stronger than me.

608
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:17,444
I'm not strong, I was selfish.

609
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:20,714
I've always been selfish.

610
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,251
I'm sorry I wasn't a
better sister to you.

611
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:28,689
I'm sorry I stole
everything from you.

612
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:34,294
I stole your boyfriends,
your money, everything.

613
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,098
I tried to save you.

614
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:40,701
I really did.

615
00:41:45,305 --> 00:41:46,707
I'm just tired.

616
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,477
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

617
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:53,747
No, Natalie, don't go to sleep.

618
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:56,650
Natalie, can you hear me?

619
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:10,631
You evil bitch!

620
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:13,700
You're going to kill
all of us, aren't you?

621
00:42:17,304 --> 00:42:20,507
I'm not the one making
the choices here, you are.

622
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,811
[powers down]

623
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,922
Do you think it stopped?

624
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:37,758
[Sean] Do you think that
means that she's seen enough?

625
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:41,295
A person like that
never sees enough.

626
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:45,098
Maybe she wants to
see what happens next.

627
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:49,303
How we deal with this trauma.

628
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:55,342
There's no way we're all
getting out of here alive.

629
00:42:55,475 --> 00:42:57,544
This is an experiment, right?

630
00:42:58,512 --> 00:43:00,447
Maybe she got the
results she wanted.

631
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:04,751
I mean, they saw
Richard not do anything.

632
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:08,722
They made Alice attempt to
kill and Tracey getting hurt.

633
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:11,358
It was just an accident.

634
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,765
She knows I didn't do anything.

635
00:43:19,866 --> 00:43:22,402
She just wanted to
see my wife die.

636
00:43:26,406 --> 00:43:29,676
She would do
anything for anybody.

637
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,447
I can still see her face
just coming towards me.

638
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,583
It's just happening over
and over and over again.

639
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:40,420
It's like I'm fucking
living in hell.

640
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:44,291
I was ready to shoot that
poor man in the face.

641
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:48,128
Come on, let us out,
haven't you seen enough!

642
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:51,365
The doors aren't opening,
nothing's happening.

643
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:56,104
That door isn't going to open.

644
00:43:56,236 --> 00:43:58,238
Then what's this waiting for?

645
00:43:58,372 --> 00:43:59,706
The bitch is crazy.

646
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,409
Maybe she just wants to
see us all kill each other.

647
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,311
Look the TV's off.

648
00:44:05,278 --> 00:44:06,480
There's no ticking.

649
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:09,683
Maybe she's thinking it over.

650
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:13,787
You think she's
planning on letting us go?

651
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,889
We should come up
with a plan too.

652
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,127
Hey, stay back we're
not out of anything!

653
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:21,194
Okay, okay, no problem.

654
00:44:24,197 --> 00:44:27,634
Please, open the door!

655
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:31,872
The door, open it?

656
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:35,509
You think they're
gonna open that door?

657
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:37,978
They're never gonna
open that door.

658
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:41,248
They are never
opening that door,

659
00:44:41,381 --> 00:44:43,316
we're all gonna die in here.

660
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,486
We're all gonna die
and rot in this room.

661
00:44:51,758 --> 00:44:53,393
[screaming]

662
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:55,362
Open the door!

663
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:58,665
I don't wanna die
in here, please!

664
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:01,468
I just wanna go back home alive.

665
00:45:01,601 --> 00:45:03,171
We just wanna go back home.

666
00:45:03,303 --> 00:45:05,039
We don't care what you want.

667
00:45:05,173 --> 00:45:06,440
We don't care!

668
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:08,709
Please let us go
back home alive!

669
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:10,178
Come on!

670
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,411
Let us out!

671
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,919
The experiment isn't over yet.

672
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:22,689
It is absolutely essential
that you continue.

673
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:28,295
[tense music]

674
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:32,200
Who is that?

675
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:33,400
Who knows her?

676
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,137
I know her.

677
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:38,572
She's my girlfriend.

678
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,775
Ana, can you hear me?

679
00:45:43,144 --> 00:45:43,977
Ana?

680
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:51,618
Ana, Ana, hey, hey,
can you hear me?

681
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:55,022
Look, look, I'm
here, I'm here, Ana.

682
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:58,792
Hurry, help, I love you.

683
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:06,134
I don't know how
I got here, baby.

684
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,834
I don't know what's happening.

685
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:12,206
Baby, just be patient,
okay, just be patient.

686
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:16,710
I will get you out, okay, I
promise, I promise to you, okay?

687
00:46:16,843 --> 00:46:18,012
I love you.

688
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:23,017
I love you too.

689
00:47:54,275 --> 00:47:56,776
I don't want to have
to kill you, Richard.

690
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:00,114
But I'm going to have to.

691
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:03,483
I know, I know, I know.

692
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:06,853
I understand.

693
00:48:07,821 --> 00:48:09,890
I'm done, done playing.

694
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:12,559
Just do it.

695
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:16,030
I think you have to
make it easy for me.

696
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:24,671
I think you should
kill yourself.

697
00:48:27,974 --> 00:48:29,442
You allowed your wife to die

698
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:31,711
because you couldn't
kill for her.

699
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,614
Now it's time.

700
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:42,422
This is really sharp.

701
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,497
You can slit your wrist
with it very easily.

702
00:48:56,137 --> 00:48:57,671
Let me show you.

703
00:49:01,342 --> 00:49:05,845
Slice your wrist down
your arm like this.

704
00:49:05,979 --> 00:49:06,913
Not across.

705
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:10,483
You will bleed out
really quickly.

706
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:14,155
It will barely hurt.

707
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:21,962
Seriously, you're
gonna let this happen?

708
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:23,463
Shut up!

709
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:25,066
I can't watch this.

710
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,601
This is my fucking
business, okay?

711
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:34,607
Richard, you don't
have to do this.

712
00:49:34,741 --> 00:49:37,510
Hey, it's his call, man.

713
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:39,413
Make her do it,
she should do it.

714
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:40,714
Shut up!

715
00:49:43,184 --> 00:49:44,251
I can do this.

716
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:49,956
I can do this, let me do this.

717
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,761
She should be here.

718
00:49:54,894 --> 00:49:56,163
She shouldn't be dead.

719
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:03,803
- She shouldn't be dead.
- No.

720
00:50:03,937 --> 00:50:08,242
But she is now, join her.

721
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,744
- Yes.
- Yeah.

722
00:50:10,877 --> 00:50:13,280
- You can kiss her.
- Yeah.

723
00:50:13,414 --> 00:50:14,981
Yeah, so do it.

724
00:50:19,487 --> 00:50:21,921
[groaning]

725
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,126
Oh.

726
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:28,995
Shh.

727
00:50:31,232 --> 00:50:32,932
Oh fuck.

728
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:38,005
Now look at me, look at me.

729
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,308
You'll be with her soon.

730
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:47,281
Go to sleep.

731
00:50:47,415 --> 00:50:49,316
Sleep, Richard.

732
00:51:11,005 --> 00:51:13,007
Thank you, Richard.

733
00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:35,196
[screaming]

734
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:07,794
This is fucked up.

735
00:52:09,096 --> 00:52:11,731
This is all so fucked.

736
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:17,138
I tried to kill
him just like her.

737
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,076
She's gonna kill us
all anyway, isn't she?

738
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,445
No, she isn't.

739
00:52:24,578 --> 00:52:26,113
We just have to figure it out.

740
00:52:28,848 --> 00:52:31,352
- Hey L?
- Yeah.

741
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,923
Back there with Tracey,
what were you saying?

742
00:52:38,025 --> 00:52:39,126
What do you mean?

743
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:40,894
Sounded like scripture.

744
00:52:41,028 --> 00:52:43,230
How did you know all that?

745
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:47,800
Oh, that's, my Mom used to
take me to church every Sunday.

746
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,237
Do you still go?

747
00:52:51,238 --> 00:52:53,440
No, I stopped
going when I was 12.

748
00:52:55,009 --> 00:53:00,147
It's weird though, I
still remember, you know.

749
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:07,188
What does it all mean?

750
00:53:07,321 --> 00:53:12,725
I think it just means
whatever you go through in life.

751
00:53:14,028 --> 00:53:15,262
It's all just temporary.

752
00:53:15,995 --> 00:53:17,264
It'll all pass.

753
00:53:34,948 --> 00:53:37,451
[tense music]

754
00:53:43,157 --> 00:53:46,726
Sorry, Olivia, suicide
isn't the same as murder.

755
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:48,329
You're doing well though,

756
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:51,298
learning the darker
side of human nature.

757
00:53:51,432 --> 00:53:55,802
You're almost there, but
if you want to escape

758
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:58,871
you can't just let a
person take their life.

759
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:00,341
You must take it from them.

760
00:54:01,475 --> 00:54:04,211
[clock ticking]

761
00:54:16,223 --> 00:54:18,225
[crying]

762
00:54:24,098 --> 00:54:27,167
When do you think that she's
going to make her move?

763
00:54:30,004 --> 00:54:31,971
She'll probably
wait till it's dark.

764
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:36,076
Someone's going to die
when the lights go off.

765
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,245
She's the one that
stabbed Tracey.

766
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:42,249
Yeah, I think so too.

767
00:55:02,202 --> 00:55:06,273
I can hear everything
you're saying, you know.

768
00:55:09,043 --> 00:55:12,146
This room is not very large.

769
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,814
You should know that by now.

770
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:20,853
And you're right,
I killed her.

771
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:22,423
I thought she was you, Alice.

772
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:26,959
Someone is going to die
when the lights go out.

773
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:31,365
But right now I'm still alive.

774
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,302
And so is the only
woman that I ever loved,

775
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,605
and I intend to do
whatever I have to do

776
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:43,043
to make sure that she
isn't going to die.

777
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:45,012
Olivia, it's not worth it.

778
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:54,521
Give yourself up to me, Sean.

779
00:55:59,226 --> 00:56:01,528
I'm willing to have
sex with you first

780
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:03,330
if that's what you want.

781
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:11,938
I will be gentle
afterwards, I promise.

782
00:56:12,072 --> 00:56:14,941
Olivia, you're not
thinking clearly.

783
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:16,343
Yes, I am.

784
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:18,312
Everything is very
clear right now.

785
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:21,348
Clearer than it has
ever been, really.

786
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,184
Olivia, we should all talk.

787
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:26,286
I'm tired of talking, Sean.

788
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:29,256
Come on, there has to be
another way out of here.

789
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:32,192
Look, we can use your
hatchet and my ax

790
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:33,360
and we can chop
through the wall.

791
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:35,062
We can still get out of here.

792
00:56:35,195 --> 00:56:36,996
And go where, Sean?

793
00:56:37,664 --> 00:56:39,133
Go where?

794
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:41,702
You don't know what's
on the other side.

795
00:56:41,835 --> 00:56:44,971
There's no way out of
here except one way.

796
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:46,939
No.

797
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,346
You're not a killer, Sean.

798
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,380
Look at you.

799
00:56:54,782 --> 00:56:56,583
Holding that ax.

800
00:56:57,718 --> 00:57:00,020
Olivia, just stop.

801
00:57:00,154 --> 00:57:01,388
I'm not gonna fight you.

802
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:06,393
Good, surrender to me.

803
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:10,264
Olivia, please, don't do it.

804
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:13,033
Look, I'm gonna drop my weapon.

805
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:17,504
You have said too much.

806
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:21,775
You will never be the same.

807
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:22,942
Olivia!

808
00:58:03,884 --> 00:58:06,420
[screaming]

809
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:13,427
I'm sorry I had to be
the one to push you

810
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,729
into becoming who
you really are.

811
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:26,173
If any of us is
pushed far enough

812
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:29,309
there's no telling what
we will do to survive,

813
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:31,178
so don't feel guilty.

814
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:33,447
This is all my fault.

815
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:35,649
I don't feel guilty.

816
00:58:35,782 --> 00:58:40,020
I just know I did everything
I could to stay alive

817
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:42,055
and you did everything you could

818
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:44,491
to drive that poor girl crazy.

819
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:49,696
And yet, Sean, you
surprised me today.

820
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,064
I thought you would give in

821
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:53,267
to such a beautiful
girl like Olivia.

822
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:58,105
I'm surprised you could
resist such a beautiful woman.

823
00:58:58,238 --> 00:59:00,040
What are you saying?

824
00:59:01,174 --> 00:59:04,012
I know everything
about you, Sean.

825
00:59:04,144 --> 00:59:05,546
I know how you
brought another woman

826
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:08,482
into your bed when
your wife was away.

827
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:13,153
Where is my wife?

828
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:14,688
Do you have my wife?

829
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:18,158
Of course not.

830
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:20,761
Why would I take your wife

831
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:23,163
when clearly you don't care much

832
00:59:23,297 --> 00:59:25,365
about whether she's hurt or not?

833
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:33,307
But, I have a person
that you really love.

834
00:59:34,308 --> 00:59:36,543
Jacob, oh my God, Jacob.

835
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:40,480
Jacob, are you okay?

836
00:59:42,382 --> 00:59:43,817
Where's my boy?

837
00:59:44,785 --> 00:59:46,153
Where's my boy?

838
00:59:47,387 --> 00:59:51,458
And L, you are not so
innocent either, are you?

839
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:53,760
The difference between
you and Sean is

840
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:56,430
you hurt the person
you love the most.

841
00:59:57,431 --> 01:00:01,134
Remember, when you ran away
and you broke her heart?

842
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:02,736
What are you talking about?

843
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:10,844
Mom?

844
01:00:14,082 --> 01:00:15,115
Leonard?

845
01:00:16,817 --> 01:00:18,585
Mom, where are you?

846
01:00:19,853 --> 01:00:21,788
Don't worry about me.

847
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:25,525
Are you hurt?

848
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,298
You know your Mama,
nothing can really hurt me.

849
01:00:32,432 --> 01:00:34,868
Mama, I was gonna
come back home.

850
01:00:37,038 --> 01:00:39,139
I'm gonna come get you.

851
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,808
I'm still gonna come back.

852
01:00:44,012 --> 01:00:49,383
Final test, decide who
lives and who dies.

853
01:00:55,689 --> 01:00:58,525
[clock ticking]

854
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:06,500
This is fucked up.

855
01:01:08,136 --> 01:01:09,870
This is so fucked up.

856
01:01:16,843 --> 01:01:20,781
We're all just gonna
end up dead like them.

857
01:01:20,914 --> 01:01:24,484
I mean, for all we
know they're forcing us

858
01:01:24,618 --> 01:01:28,555
to kill each other but
my sister could be alive.

859
01:01:31,925 --> 01:01:34,494
I'm sorry, Alice, but
your sister's dead.

860
01:01:34,628 --> 01:01:36,596
I'm not gonna let
her kill my son.

861
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:38,799
Even if my sister's dead

862
01:01:38,932 --> 01:01:40,934
killing each other
isn't worth it.

863
01:01:41,069 --> 01:01:44,871
We're all acting like animals
slaughtering each other.

864
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:48,675
She's right.

865
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,678
The doctor's not
even in here, man.

866
01:01:52,913 --> 01:01:55,449
We're the ones getting
our hands dirty.

867
01:01:55,582 --> 01:01:57,484
She hasn't laid a
finger on anyone.

868
01:02:07,594 --> 01:02:11,965
Fucking Tracey,
she was pregnant.

869
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,403
She would have done
anything for her baby.

870
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:21,142
Sean, I know you would have
done anything for your child.

871
01:02:21,274 --> 01:02:26,013
And L, I know your Mom
would do anything for you.

872
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:30,517
That doesn't mean that
we should keep playing.

873
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:33,520
When the timer goes off,
the lights are gonna go out

874
01:02:33,653 --> 01:02:36,690
and she's going to want
for us to kill each other.

875
01:02:39,026 --> 01:02:41,394
We're not going anywhere.

876
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:43,930
Might as well just stop.

877
01:03:01,581 --> 01:03:02,783
Richard was right.

878
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:07,320
Richard was the only
one who was right.

879
01:03:09,257 --> 01:03:10,991
He died with dignity.

880
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,361
He didn't kill anyone.

881
01:03:14,494 --> 01:03:15,896
Didn't even try.

882
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:20,834
You know she's right, Sean.

883
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:22,602
I'm not gonna kill you.

884
01:03:22,736 --> 01:03:25,372
That's not what my Mom
would want anyways.

885
01:03:25,505 --> 01:03:27,808
It's a dark road and I'm
not going down it, man.

886
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:29,576
I don't want to
kill you either,

887
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:32,979
but my son, they got my son.

888
01:03:33,114 --> 01:03:35,149
And I can't let him die.

889
01:03:35,283 --> 01:03:37,517
My son is eight.

890
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:40,154
He hasn't had a
chance at life yet.

891
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:45,126
I'm sorry, but I
gotta take you down.

892
01:03:45,259 --> 01:03:49,696
If there's even a chance of
saving him, I need to win.

893
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:52,732
I'll get you.

894
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:56,670
You walk around smiling,
acting all in charge,

895
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:57,971
acting like you're a good guy

896
01:03:58,105 --> 01:03:59,539
till nobody's looking, man.

897
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:03,577
Yeah, I'm not that
great of a guy, okay.

898
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,314
But that little
boy there, he is.

899
01:04:06,446 --> 01:04:08,682
He got cancer when he was six.

900
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:10,984
We were told that he
only had six months.

901
01:04:11,118 --> 01:04:13,820
His mother and I,
we fought for him.

902
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:17,724
But you know what?

903
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:20,660
Our relationship got to
the point where she left

904
01:04:21,828 --> 01:04:25,333
and I met someone to
help me take my mind away

905
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:27,534
if just for a moment.

906
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:31,404
I made a mistake and
I'm still sorry for it.

907
01:04:31,538 --> 01:04:32,839
Well, congratulations.

908
01:04:34,075 --> 01:04:36,077
I'm a fuck up, okay?

909
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:41,615
I admit it, but my son,
he's better than I am.

910
01:04:42,782 --> 01:04:44,718
I'm not going to let
some crazy lady kill him.

911
01:04:44,851 --> 01:04:47,255
You all may not think
that I'm a survivor

912
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:49,123
but you know what, my son is.

913
01:04:49,257 --> 01:04:51,558
And I'm not gonna let him die.

914
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,494
Yeah, we'll see when
the lights go off.

915
01:04:58,132 --> 01:04:59,599
What about me, Sean?

916
01:05:00,834 --> 01:05:03,637
If you kill L, does that mean
you're going to kill me too?

917
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:05,039
You lost your sister.

918
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:08,508
You should do what Richard did

919
01:05:08,642 --> 01:05:10,577
and take yourself out of this.

920
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:11,912
You know what I said before

921
01:05:12,046 --> 01:05:14,315
about how we shouldn't
play anymore?

922
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:16,850
- I've changed my mind.
- What?

923
01:05:16,983 --> 01:05:20,288
I've changed my mind.
I want to kill you, Sean,

924
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,555
if it's the last thing I do.

925
01:05:22,689 --> 01:05:24,524
Watch it, Alice.

926
01:05:24,658 --> 01:05:26,660
Watch it, you stay out of this.

927
01:05:26,793 --> 01:05:29,263
No, I'm in this
more now than ever

928
01:05:29,397 --> 01:05:31,032
and I'm ready for you, Sean.

929
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:32,666
You don't get it, man.

930
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:34,534
You know how much anger it takes

931
01:05:34,668 --> 01:05:36,037
for people like us to survive?

932
01:05:37,804 --> 01:05:39,606
Man, you think 'cause
you killed some girl

933
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:41,175
that was chasing after
you with an ax first,

934
01:05:41,309 --> 01:05:43,910
you can understand what
it takes to survive, man?

935
01:05:44,678 --> 01:05:45,879
You don't know shit!

936
01:05:46,913 --> 01:05:48,748
Every day of my life has
been about survival for me

937
01:05:48,882 --> 01:05:51,185
and the people that I love.

938
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:52,353
Today isn't any different for me

939
01:05:52,485 --> 01:05:54,221
just because I'm
stuck here, man.

940
01:05:54,355 --> 01:05:55,655
Today's just another day,

941
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:56,790
just another day
where I don't know

942
01:05:56,923 --> 01:05:58,392
if me or anybody
else that I love

943
01:05:58,558 --> 01:05:59,759
is gonna make it
through tomorrow.

944
01:05:59,893 --> 01:06:01,162
So welcome to my world, Sean.

945
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:03,663
This is what's always
like for me, man.

946
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:10,071
You really think that you
can beat me with that knife?

947
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:16,943
Hey L, Sean's right about me.

948
01:06:19,713 --> 01:06:22,183
I've got nothing
left to live for,

949
01:06:23,483 --> 01:06:24,951
but I'm still angry.

950
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,921
That's still there.

951
01:06:29,023 --> 01:06:31,758
And I don't want to
see you win, Sean,

952
01:06:31,891 --> 01:06:34,195
even if it means I die.

953
01:06:35,396 --> 01:06:36,896
You want to know why?

954
01:06:38,932 --> 01:06:40,834
I just don't like you.

955
01:06:44,804 --> 01:06:48,575
[Sean] That's not fair,
Alice, that's not fucking fair.

956
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:51,845
Shut up, people
like you always win.

957
01:06:51,978 --> 01:06:54,714
It's not fair, that's
not fucking fair.

It ain't Alice you
gotta worry about, Sean.

Come on, L.

960
01:07:01,755 --> 01:07:03,523
Okay, I'm not a killer.

961
01:07:03,656 --> 01:07:04,758
I'm just a dad, okay?

962
01:07:04,891 --> 01:07:06,526
I just want to save my kid.

963
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:08,962
Please, just let me win.

964
01:07:10,997 --> 01:07:12,632
Where are you going, Sean?

965
01:07:12,766 --> 01:07:14,934
- Kill him, L!
- I will.

966
01:07:15,069 --> 01:07:16,002
Come on!

967
01:07:34,355 --> 01:07:35,722
No, no I can't!

968
01:07:38,092 --> 01:07:39,659
No, no!

969
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:45,332
Get off me!

970
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,635
Alice!

971
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:55,575
Thank you for helping me, Alice.

972
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:58,611
No Sean, don't do this.

973
01:08:04,951 --> 01:08:06,153
You tried to kill me.

974
01:08:06,287 --> 01:08:07,555
I didn't touch you.

975
01:08:07,687 --> 01:08:11,225
Yeah, but you gave him a
machete so he could kill me.

976
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,627
No! Seriously,
stop Sean, please.

977
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,130
We're past that, Alice.

978
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:18,765
I'm not gonna debate
this with you.

979
01:08:18,898 --> 01:08:20,101
What about your son?

980
01:08:20,234 --> 01:08:22,203
What kind of example
are you setting?

981
01:08:22,336 --> 01:08:23,736
My son is dead!

982
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:28,509
Choked, lifeless,
but you know what?

983
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:30,377
We're all survivors, right?

984
01:08:30,511 --> 01:08:31,678
Is that right, huh?

985
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:32,912
All of us!

986

You, L, Richard, Olivia, Tracey,

we're all survivors!

988

You know what, it's
just that some of us

989
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:47,128
are better at it than others.

990
01:08:47,261 --> 01:08:48,895
Yeah, but you don't
have to kill me,

991
01:08:49,029 --> 01:08:50,663
you don't have to do this.

992
