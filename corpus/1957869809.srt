1
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,091
[car passing]

2
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,122
- Hey, Jim.
- [Jim] Good morning.

3
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,086
- Thanks.
- [Jim] Thank you.

4
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,590
[sighs]
That all you're traveling with, honey?

5
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,926
I'm Sharon.

6
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,696
You wear a medium?

7
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,659
[sighs] Okay, uh… [clicks tongue]

8
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,956
Cell phone is prepaid. Somewhere on here,
it tells you the number.

9
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,460
I was trying to think
what else to get you.

10
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,544
It's always different with each person.

11
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,924
Eye drops, hair spray, whatever…

12
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,260
[chuckles] Last guy, he liked to use
conditioner instead of shaving cream.

13
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,429
You just let me know what you need.

14
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,939
Do you need me to go slower?

15
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,839
[patient breathing heavily]

16
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,341
Let me help you.

17
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,807
There you go. Good.

18
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,232
Well, I'm sure
you're more of an adventurer.

19
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,695
[chuckles] I can't stand planes.
Don't like being up in the air

20
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,364
and all the people
breathing down your neck.

21
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,576
Good job, honey.

22
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,164
[grunts] All right.

23
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:31,920
Now, let's stand up slowly.

24
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:38,635
[grunting] Bathrooms can be dangerous.

25
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,679
[tap running]

26
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,348
Oh. Here, let me help you.

27
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,671
[Sharon]
Frank liked naproxen better than Advil.

28
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,716
He had bursitis in his shoulder.

29
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,053
He worked in the plant,
packing TV dinners.

30
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:26,558
I wouldn't eat 'em. All that ammonium,
probably what got him sick.

31
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,770
H-How long ago was that?

32
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,355
Nine years.

33
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,443
I got so good at taking care of him, I
thought, why can't I do that for a living?

34
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,820
So I went back to school and got licensed.

35
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,781
What a miserable life.

36
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,123
I'm so sorry.

37
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,586
It's okay.
People say things they don't mean.

38
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,216
Sometimes they can't remember words.
It'll get easier.

39
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,847
- [doctors, patients chattering]
- [elevator bell dings]

40
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,729
Do you remember this man's name?

41
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,819
John Jones.

42
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,785
Mary Black?

43
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,625
[sighs]

44
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,253
I have no idea.

45
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,092
- Okay. And now with the other hand?
- [doctors, patients chattering]

46
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,975
[physiotherapist] You got it.

47
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,605
Good job. It's all right. Going back.

48
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,582
[exhales sharply, inhales]

49
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:22,299
[grunting]

50
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,350
[groaning, panting]

51
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,525
Sharon!

52
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,111
[breathing shakily] Sharon!

53
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,823
[breathing shakily]

54
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,451
[Sharon] You're okay. You're okay, honey.

55
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:54,998
Aw, it's okay. It's okay. Just breathe.

56
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,750
Listen to me.

57
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:02,548
Aw. Shh, it's okay. You're okay.

58
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,677
That's it. Just breathe. Just breathe.

59
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,597
In… [inhales sharply] …and out.

60
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,352
In and out.

61
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:21,149
[retches, coughing]

62
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,862
- [breathing shakily]
- [Sharon] One more. One more.

63
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,448
You're doing great.

64
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,496
Good. This is a big one.
They won't be like this later.

65
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,841
Are you with me?

66
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,283
[panting]

67
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,211
Thank you.

68
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,187
[sighs] You wanna go for a drive
before it gets dark?

69
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,491
Let's take this right into town.

70
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,212
Look at you.

71
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,757
- [chattering on radio]
- [both chuckle]

72
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,342
You're ready to go.

73
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:23,939
[inhales deeply]

74
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:31,989
Pull over. You need to pull over
just to the side of the road. Right here.

75
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,834
[sighs] I'm sorry.

76
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,335
- [sniffling]
- [Sharon] It's okay.

77
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,881
I know this is hard.

78
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:54,595
This isn't hard. [sniffles]
Driving a car shouldn't be a victory.

79
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,767
[clicks tongue] I mean leaving.
Transition can be hard.

80
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,856
If you're not feeling ready,
we can look into extending your stay.

81
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,483
I can't pay for that.

82
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,904
I should be getting back anyway.

83
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,697
Back home.

84
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,367
No, back to work. Redeploy.

85
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,287
[inhales deeply]

86
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:26,502
You've made a lot of progress, but you're
not ready to go back to work. Not nearly.

87
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,964
Then what the hell was the point
in all of this?

88
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,222
[inhales deeply]

89
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,525
Don't forget what we talked about, okay?

90
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,613
Organize yourself. Prep for memory gaps.

91
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,326
Make lists. Keep your lists.
Put like with like.

92
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,579
Find two of something,
put them together like we worked on.

93
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,789
I'm not gonna forget.

94
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:08,043
[Sharon] People do.
They can get a little ahead of themselves.

95
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,257
Well, what's your plan for getting home
from the bus? We can write it down.

96
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,178
My mom is gonna pick me up
from the bus station.

97
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,222
Anyone else gonna be around?

98
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,432
Your brother?

99
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:30,315
Um, I haven't really been home in a while,
and it's not like I'm staying for long.

100
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,985
- So…
- It can help to be with people.

101
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,153
I'm good on my own.

102
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:45,622
Ativan, Depakote, Cymbalta, Vicodin.

103
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,457
The rehab's not over.

104
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,462
You're gonna have to work hard every day
to do all the things you used to do.

105
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,631
Yep.

106
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:57,968
I'm gonna be fine.

107
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,777
[passengers chattering]

108
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,995
[passengers chattering]

109
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,568
[parent chuckles]
You think you're so funny, don't you?

110
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,112
- I think it's in here. Hold on. [chuckles]
- [guest speaks indistinctly]

111
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,699
- Okay. I'll be right there. Hold on.
- [door opens]

112
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:32,534
Lynsey?

113
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,498
Lynsey, I thought you said
you were coming on Friday.

114
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,542
[Lynsey] Mom?

115
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,006
You okay?

116
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,092
I'm fine.

117
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,183
I asked Debbie to get off work
early Friday.

118
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,395
I was gonna get groceries,
clean out the truck for you,

119
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,483
get a cake, pick you up.
It was gonna be a homecoming on Friday.

120
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,694
It's okay.

121
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,364
- [ambient music playing]
- [crockery clattering]

122
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,740
Hey, you wanna meet Ted?

123
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,367
No. I... I need to sleep.

124
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,703
We'll keep it down.

125
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,832
I gotta go to work early,
but you sleep in.

126
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,464
Hey, Lyns.

127
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,093
I was worried about you.

128
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,224
You look like you.

129
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,487
[door closes]

130
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,951
[refrigerator door opens]

131
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,163
[music playing faintly]

132
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:43,749
Can I help you?

133
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,877
I was wondering if you're still hiring.

134
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:49,963
- To clean pools?
- Yeah.

135
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,300
[employee]
You home for the summer? You in college?

136
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,387
- I just got back from Afghanistan.
- [employee] Oh.

137
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:01,683
Thank you for your service.
My father was in the Navy. Korean.

138
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,895
But why do you wanna clean pools?

139
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,438
[employees, customers chattering]

140
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,942
I like the water.
I used to clean the pools over at Newman.

141
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,612
I guess there's not
a lot of swimming pools in Afghanistan.

142
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,781
Not where I was. No. [chuckles]

143
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,075
- [employee] Can you drive?
- Yeah.

144
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,744
[employee] Great. Start tomorrow?

145
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,454
Sure.

146
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:30,838
[engine rattling, revving]

147
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,968
[breathes heavily]

148
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,937
- [horns honking]
- [breathing shakily]

149
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:52,651
- [driver] Hey! Get the fuck off the road!
- [breathing heavily]

150
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:02,244
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! [breathes heavily]

151
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,747
[mouthing] Fuck. [breathing heavily]

152
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,505
[music playing faintly]

153
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,025
[breathes deeply]

154
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:37,738
[exhales deeply]

155
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,122
Ooh, yeah.

156
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,501
What's this, '85 Scottsdale?

157
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,047
Old, old body style right here.
Got you a nice truck.

158
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,049
Yeah. Not anymore.

159
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,301
How long it been doing this?

160
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,304
Uh, just now. I... I don't know.
It's not mine.

161
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,890
When the last time
you changed the oil in it?

162
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,726
I don't know.

163
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,480
All right. It's all right.

164
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:13,899
Hey, Santiago.

165
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,527
- [tools clink]
- Uh, you can wait inside.

166
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,611
We got air in there.

167
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:20,697
Yeah.

168
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,868
[mechanic] Yesterday, I said
it was the exhaust valve, and I was right.

169
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:28,914
[mechanic, Santiago speaking indistinctly]

170
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,291
[both laugh]

171
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,973
So, uh...
Well, probably just the carburetor.

172
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,058
And if it is,
I can just get that part on eBay.

173
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,687
It ain't that hard to find. It may
take a while to get here. You in a hurry?

174
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,981
I don't know how long I'll be here.

175
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,486
- How much is it gonna cost?
- Maybe about, uh, 350, 400, plus labor.

176
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,656
Maybe more if we get in there
and find it needs some more work.

177
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:06,118
I don't know if I wanna fix it.
It's not... It's not even mine. It's...

178
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:10,497
Oh, no, now that… [chuckles]
…I mean, that's... that's a nice truck.

179
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,458
So…

180
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,089
Okay, how about you just, um,
leave it here with us?

181
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,800
And when I get the part,
I'll call you for an estimate. Yeah?

182
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:24,553
I don't know my number.

183
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:26,930
I mean, it's just business.

184
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,893
No. I... I really don't know my number.

185
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:39,985
Um, how about you, uh... How about this?
How about, uh, you call me,

186
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,237
and your number will show up. Okay?

187
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,781
Can I... Can I see your phone?

188
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,618
So what I'ma do is I'ma call me, right?

189
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:51,580
And that way, my number will show up,
all right? Simple as that.

190
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,749
It's Aucoin.

191
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,584
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:05,511
- [rap-rock playing]
- [people on street chattering]

193
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,316
[rap-rock fades]

194
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,489
[panting]

195
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:35,290
Hey, '85 Scottsdale, you okay?

196
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:37,918
I'm fine.

197
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,046
I mean, it's real hot out.
You want a ride?

198
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:44,383
Where you headed?

199
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,218
Just down near Tchoup and Bordeaux.

200
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,556
- Gonna get a sno-ball?
- [chuckles] No.

201
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,477
- Shit, maybe.
- [both chuckle]

202
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,359
Hey, you wanna play some music?

203
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,112
You can pick whatever CD you like.

204
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,703
[rhythm and blues song playing]

205
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,664
[chuckles] My grandma
used to play this record. She...

206
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,292
Ooh, man, she loved her some Ernie.

207
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,795
[scoffs] He's making a joke
out of the blues though.

208
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,883
- You grew up here?
- Yeah, born and raised. You?

209
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,218
Same.

210
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,596
- Where you go to high school?
- Newman.

211
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:35,642
- Ooh. [chuckles]
- [laughs] I had a scholarship. [chuckles]

212
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,895
I went to De La Salle.

213
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:40,772
Aucoin, right?

214
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,692
You know, most people,
they just call me James.

215
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,862
I knew a Jess Aucoin
that went to De La Salle.

216
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,031
That would be my sister.

217
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:52,284
I played against her in basketball.
She was tough.

218
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:04,922
The weirdest thing about this song

219
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,299
is that he actually got buried
with his mother-in-law.

220
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,384
- [both chuckle]
- Down on Claiborne. [chuckles]

221
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:10,469
That's ironic.

222
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,013
- [CD skipping]
- Oh.

223
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:14,890
[James] Shoot.

224
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,184
I guess that's why
people don't buy CDs anymore.

225
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,895
Know what?
Uh… [sighs] …I'm old-school, so…

226
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:23,357
- [funk song playing]
- Yeah. [hums]

227
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:29,655
You know this one, right?

228
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,368
- "Here Come the Girls"?
- [chuckles] That's it. That's it.

229
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,411
Okay, Newman.

230
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:06,650
All right.

231
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:10,946
First you scrub,
then you use your skimmer.

232
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,240
Get all your flowers and leaves
off the surface.

233
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,367
Then you get your leaf rake.
That's the heavy net.

234
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,995
You get all your rocks, twigs, acorns.

235
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,581
Stuff that'll clog your main drain
and damage your pump.

236
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,792
Hey, you... you okay?
Can you handle all of that?

237
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,752
Yeah. Uh, main drain…

238
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:29,423
All right, good.
So then you're gonna empty the drains.

239
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,843
And the drains are serious.

240
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,096
- [gate opens]
- You don't know what's in those drains.

241
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,350
You can tell a lot about a person
'cause of what's in their pool drains.

242
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:46,064
[groans, sighs]
You really gotta give it some more muscle.

243
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:50,402
There you go.

244
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,072
People treat their pools like shit.
[groans]

245
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:57,492
Out of chlorine.
Grabbing some from the truck.

246
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:02,789
[sighs]

247
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,045
You think you can handle this on your own?

248
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:09,505
Yes, sir.

249
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,840
[employee] Great. Then you can start
with Octavia Street tomorrow.

250
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,396
[Lynsey's mom]
Just come over after then. Yes, baby.

251
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,358
[Lynsey's mom scoffs]
Okay. I'll see you later.

252
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,988
Oh, you're in here.
[inhales deeply] I didn't see the truck.

253
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:37,074
It's at the shop.

254
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:40,035
What's wrong with it?
What's it gonna cost?

255
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,412
Don't worry about it.
I'll... I'll pay for it.

256
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,331
That's not what I meant.

257
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,126
Um, how you feeling?

258
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,797
Good. Okay. I'm good.

259
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:56,134
Come sit with me awhile?
I could use a drink.

260
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:58,887
[sighs]

261
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,225
You tired?

262
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,435
Yeah.

263
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:08,438
Right.

264
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,846
[cell phone vibrates]

265
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,773
[James] Hello? Anybody home?

266
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,775
[Lynsey] I'm back here, James.

267
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,699
Damn, this place is nice.

268
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,494
- I ain't gonna get shot, am I?
- [chuckles] Not today.

269
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,747
- Owners are out of town.
- Ah.

270
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,584
- Thanks.
- Mmm, you're welcome.

271
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,089
- Do you wanna sit down?
- Yeah.

272
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:26,975
Do you swim?

273
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,316
[groans] Not exactly, no.

274
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:38,445
- I saw it in your walk.
- Mm-hmm, I get around okay.

275
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:40,989
Did you serve?

276
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,410
No. [exhales heavily] I take it you did?

277
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,914
Something like that. I just got back.

278
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:51,250
How's it going?

279
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,672
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- Yeah.

280
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,093
[doctor] And look straight up.

281
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:08,433
And now the left.

282
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,272
Very good.

283
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:21,989
So, Ativan, Cymbalta, Depakote, Vicodin
and a brain injury.

284
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:26,410
From which you appear to be recovering
extremely well.

285
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,873
With brain injuries,
there are never any guarantees.

286
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:34,418
I'm feeling pretty good.
In fact, I'd like to know

287
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:38,630
what would happen
if I stopped taking the medication?

288
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:43,260
You'd be a high risk of seizure, anxiety,
withdrawal and depression.

289
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:44,344
I feel fine.

290
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:48,599
Is it possible you feel fine
because of the Cymbalta?

291
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:54,313
Could you explain to me
what caused the brain injury?

292
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:56,982
Doesn't it say in there?

293
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:00,235
Uh, it says, "Cerebral hemorrhage
acquired in Afghanistan

294
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,571
from an explosion
while traveling in a vehicle."

295
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,907
That's what caused it.

296
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:08,619
But I want to hear
your account of what happened.

297
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:14,791
I'm just asking to come off these meds.
I've never been medicated before,

298
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,711
and I don't intend to be
for the rest of my life.

299
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,671
Lynsey,
if you're looking for a neurologist

300
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:23,300
who will give and take prescriptions
like candies, I'm not the guy.

301
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:32,893
I work for the Army Corps of Engineers.

302
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:36,647
I specialize in water systems.
I'd been deployed to work on a dam.

303
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:41,902
Dam is a 20-minute drive from base.
Three-vehicle convoy.

304
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:45,989
Ten minutes from base,
the lead vehicle explodes.

305
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:51,286
I see it from the front window.
And then my vehicle explodes.

306
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:55,958
At first I don't really know
what happened,

307
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:01,755
um, but the guy next to me,
a sergeant, is on fire.

308
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:07,427
Flames up his legs and on his chest,
and he's beating them.

309
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,812
[smacks lips]
I can't see. I can't breathe.

310
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:23,527
Eventually,
someone gets the rear door open,

311
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,864
and some guys start getting out.

312
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:31,493
I see the sunlight,
so I try to move towards it.

313
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:36,874
But there's gunshots everywhere, and the
guys who are getting out are getting shot.

314
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:43,297
They're just getting out, falling over.
Um, so I can't get out.

315
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:50,679
[inhales deeply] But I need to get out
because the guy next to me is on fire.

316
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,686
Then I black out,
and I wake up in the hospital.

317
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:02,191
And they told me that the detonation
caused my brain to start bleeding.

318
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:08,864
Does that help your diagnosis?

319
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:12,409
[doctor]
It does. Thank you for your candor.

320
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,166
Tell me, how are you sleeping?

321
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:24,796
Not great.

322
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,018
Hi.

323
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:40,896
Hi.

324
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:47,945
[Lynsey] You got food.

325
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,328
Do you know how many times
I've refinanced this place?

326
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:57,412
[Lynsey] Three.

327
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:01,542
[tap running]

328
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:06,421
I talked to Debbie. [exhales heavily]
They need someone in the office upstairs.

329
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:10,634
We could take breaks together.
That might be nice.

330
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,679
I have a job. I'm... I... I got a job.

331
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,348
You did? Doing what?

332
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,808
Cleaning pools.

333
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:21,311
[scoffs] What are you doing?

334
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:25,148
[clicks tongue] Pools. I'm cleaning them.

335
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:28,068
You'd rather work in 109-degree heat

336
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,987
than in an air-conditioned office
in a department store?

337
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,406
I told Debbie you'd meet with her.

338
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,033
I told her all about you.
How smart you are. How beautiful.

339
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,453
I can't work in an office right now.

340
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:41,956
Of course you can.
It's a good job. Has insurance.

341
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,629
I can't stare at a screen all day.

342
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:49,882
[Lynsey's mom] Just try it.
I know it's not your dream job,

343
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,884
but you don't wanna clean pools
forever either.

344
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,052
It's just temporary until I can go back.

345
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,304
[Lynsey's mom] What do you mean "back"?

346
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,811
Are you kidding me?

347
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:08,150
When were you gonna tell me that?
Wait, will they even take you back?

348
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,029
- [clicks tongue] I'm gonna try.
- In the shape you're in?

349
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:15,449
It's not your problem.

350
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:18,118
It is my problem when I get a call
in the middle of the night

351
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:21,538
from some doctor in Germany
telling me my kid got blown up.

352
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,540
I'm fine. I'll... I'll be fine.

353
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,167
Okay, Lynsey.

354
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,089
You're here for a visit, so visit.
How are you?

355
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:37,471
I'm not feeling very well.
[breathing heavily]

356
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:48,482
[retching, coughing]

357
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:56,198
[breathing shakily]

358
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,282
[music playing faintly]

359
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,034
[Lynsey's mom, Ted speaking indistinctly]

360
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,702
[Lynsey's mom]
I told you that in confidence.

361
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,080
[Ted laughs]

362
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,542
- [Lynsey's mom laughs]
- [Ted speaks indistinctly]

363
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,208
{\an8}- Careful of that corner. Mm-hmm.
- [Lynsey] Thanks.

364
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:51,044
{\an8}[James] All right. [grunts]

365
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:56,884
- Now this way.
- [James panting, grunting]

366
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:05,350
- Yeah.
- [breathlessly] Yeah. Okay.

367
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,396
Hey, how much you pay for this thing?

368
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,981
Fifty bucks.

369
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:15,485
It's brutal, but I have to pass a test
to get back to work.

370
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:17,404
You got to pass a test to clean pools?

371
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:20,908
- [chuckles] No. My... My old job.
- Oh.

372
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:23,744
[Lynsey] You ever use one?

373
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,498
Went to PT a couple times.
I ain't been to the gym in a while though.

374
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:29,583
Me either.

375
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:33,670
- Hey, what's going on with my truck?
- What truck?

376
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:35,672
[both chuckle]

377
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:37,758
Nah, things just get busy.

378
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,928
I got this white lady. She keep calling me

379
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,722
to help her move gym equipment
all the time. You know what I'm saying?

380
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:45,557
Weird.

381
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,268
What about you? Hmm?
How the pool business going?

382
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:50,562
It's cutthroat.

383
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:54,316
- Really?
- [chuckles] No.

384
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:57,236
Funny.

385
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:03,033
- Just putting it right here, right?
- [Lynsey] Yeah. [grunts] That's fine.

386
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:04,451
- All right.
- [Lynsey sighs]

387
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:07,621
Okay. Don't get all Navy SEAL
and overdo it, all right? It's hot.

388
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:10,999
- [Lynsey scoffs] I can handle the heat.
- [scoffs] All right.

389
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,210
- [Lynsey sighs] Thank you.
- [sighs] Anytime.

390
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:19,007
Yeah. All right.

391
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:24,096
Hey, you wanna get a burger or something?

392
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:28,141
Absolutely. I was gonna say the s... same
thing. I just didn't wanna suggest that.

393
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,019
I didn't want to be weird or anything.
So, your treat, right?

394
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,272
- I wasn't thinking that…
- All right.

395
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,898
- I mean, I did just move…
- [Lynsey chuckles]

396
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,442
…a rowing machine for you. [chuckles]

397
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,736
- [music playing]
- [bar patrons chattering]

398
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,405
[James] Hey, you tell him I said hey?

399
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:44,658
[bartender chuckling]
Yeah. You know I will.

400
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,119
- [bottle clanks]
- That's on me, James.

401
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:48,996
What you talking about, sugar?
It's always on you.

402
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,248
- [laughs]
- Not always. [laughs]

403
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:52,541
[James laughs]

404
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,086
- Thanks.
- Yeah. She went to school with my mama.

405
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,214
- Oh.
- [chuckles, swallows]

406
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:03,218
- So you really don't drink at all?
- Huh?

407
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,470
You really don't drink at all?

408
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:07,347
I haven't tried.

409
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:09,224
You ain't never tried a beer?

410
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:13,020
No. Not since I've been back.
I'm... I'm kind of on a lot of medication.

411
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:16,899
Hmm. [smacks lips]
What kind of medication?

412
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,861
Like, "don't-shoot-yourself-in-the-head"
kind of medication.

413
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:22,738
Okay.

414
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:27,826
You mean like, uh, pain pills?
Crazy pills? Happy pills?

415
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:30,662
- So far, just pain and crazy.
- Oh.

416
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,998
- [bro] Hey, can I buy you a beer?
- What?

417
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:35,584
[bro] You are really beautiful.
Can I buy you a beer?

418
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,378
- I'm okay. Thank you.
- [bro] Come on. Have a beer with me.

419
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:40,589
You're in a bar drinking root beer.
We're in New Orleans.

420
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,090
I think she said no, bro.

421
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:45,469
Hey, I'll buy you a beer too, bro.

422
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,012
Deaf and blind.

423
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:49,681
Uh, no, because, uh, I already got a beer.

424
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:53,477
And, uh, you know, my girl said no.

425
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,605
I'm... I'm not picking up that vibe.
[stammers] Are you his girl?

426
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,941
I'm really sorry. I have a boyfriend.

427
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,069
[chuckles] Wait, wait. So she's your girl,
and she has a boyfriend?

428
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:06,281
Yeah, that's exactly right. She my girl,
and she got a boyfriend.

429
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,825
That okay with you, bro?

430
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:13,121
- [groans] Don't shoot me for trying.
- Hey, you have a good night.

431
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:15,541
[scoffs] Stupid.

432
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,127
Look, I know you're not my girl.

433
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:21,463
- Do you know what I mean? I mean, I...
- It's fine.

434
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,674
- [sighs] All right.
- [chuckles]

435
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,469
[smacks lips]
Uh, I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

436
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,471
Oh, I don't have a boyfriend.

437
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,432
- [James] Hmm.
- Are you with anybody?

438
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:39,523
Nah. Uh… I was engaged. Once.

439
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,234
What happened?

440
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,529
[smacks lips] Lost my leg.

441
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,081
Can I try a sip of your beer?

442
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,752
- You sure?
- Yeah.

443
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,770
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Last one.

444
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:29,364
[exhales heavily]

445
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:33,702
- Um, I wanted to say…
- [sighs]

446
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,455
…that thing
about me not having a boyfriend...

447
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:39,583
- Hey. Look. Nah, I... I just, uh...
- No. Well, let me just...

448
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:45,339
Um, I don't have boyfriends.
I have girlfriends.

449
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:51,136
I mean, not right now,
but when I do, that's what I have.

450
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:55,557
- Okay. Uh, I wasn't, uh...
- No, I know... I know what you were doing,

451
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,017
and I really appreciate it.

452
00:41:57,518 --> 00:42:02,523
I'm just telling you that
because now you know that about me.

453
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:12,032
Okay. Well… Okay. It's cool.

454
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:20,290
- Thank you? [chuckles]
- [chuckles] You're welcome. [chuckles]

455
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:22,960
It's all good. It's all good.

456
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:27,130
[hip hop music playing]

457
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,056
You know, I've never actually tried weed.

458
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:37,975
Are you serious?

459
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:40,978
I mean, my brother did enough drugs
for the both of us.

460
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:42,479
Ah, yeah?

461
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:47,651
Crack, meth, household detergent.

462
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,236
[snorts, chuckles]

463
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:53,198
Some alchemy he read online.
Didn't work. Burned his lung.

464
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:54,950
Damn.

465
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,624
- What happened to your leg?
- [chuckles] Sheesh.

466
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:06,211
- I really didn't see that coming.
- [chuckles] Well, what happened to it?

467
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,594
[sighs] I was in a car accident.

468
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:20,559
I got in a car accident with... with Jess…

469
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:26,398
[clicks tongue]
…and her son, my nephew, Antoine.

470
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:28,442
On the Causeway.

471
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,574
I remember… [clicks tongue]
…looking in my rearview mirror,

472
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:38,493
and I could see Jess's face.

473
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:43,081
I just remember looking in her eyes.
[groans]

474
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,503
It was like she was saying bye.

475
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:49,463
Like,

476
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:52,341
"See you later."

477
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:57,471
And then, um, I kind of wake up.

478
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,806
And I just feel this pressing into me,

479
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,018
like this really hard, hard pressing.
Really hard.

480
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:06,522
And, uh, it turns out
the car was bent out of shape.

481
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:08,899
And I'm bent with it.

482
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:12,236
And this leg… [clicks tongue]

483
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:18,534
…this leg is so fucked up
that I could look down

484
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:21,245
and the sole of my shoe
is looking right back at me.

485
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:25,249
And then there's these people
screaming outside the car.

486
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,003
Not inside.

487
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:33,924
Did Jess die?

488
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:38,303
Nah.

489
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:42,599
Nah, not Jess.

490
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:46,895
I'm so sorry.

491
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:53,110
[blowing] Yep.

492
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,274
Hey, you good?

493
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:36,403
[breathes deeply]

494
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:44,119
Hey, look, if it get dark,
now, you just... you just ride it. Okay?

495
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:45,954
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

496
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,000
- How do I do that?
- [chuckles]

497
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:55,380
That's... All right.
Uh… [sucks teeth] …what's dark?

498
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:57,466
- [James clears throat]
- Being back here.

499
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:00,552
So you don't got love for this city?

500
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,221
It's not the city.

501
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:03,514
Then what is it?

502
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:07,184
It's that house.

503
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:11,021
So many nights
sitting at that kitchen table,

504
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,814
and my brother would be nodding off.

505
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:18,445
And my mom would say,
"Oh, poor thing. He's so tired."

506
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:20,989
I miss him.

507
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,620
He and I were both trapped in that house.

508
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,541
But I'm the only one that made it out.

509
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,003
[sighs]

510
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:37,798
Anyway. And then I just... I just
never thought I would come back here.

511
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:40,634
But then I got blown up.

512
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:42,719
You got... What? You got blown up?

513
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:44,596
IED.

514
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:00,529
[music playing faintly]

515
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,543
- [horn honks]
- [gasps]

516
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:16,962
[tires squeal]

517
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:53,540
- Oh, shit! [chuckles]
- Oh. [chuckling]

518
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:54,625
Thank you.

519
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:59,046
[door closes]

520
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,383
[tap running]

521
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:07,262
[Lynsey] Okay. Well…

522
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:08,347
[water stops running]

523
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,557
[James breathes heavily]

524
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:11,642
What's the rush?

525
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:14,937
[James chuckles]

526
00:48:16,522 --> 00:48:17,898
[James sighs]

527
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:20,526
You in a rush?

528
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:22,277
[Lynsey] No.

529
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,030
Me neither. [chuckles]

530
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:26,532
- [Lynsey] Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

531
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:29,743
[sniffles, sighs]

532
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:35,791
[James yawns]

533
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,800
[James grunting, sighing]

534
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,228
[Lynsey] It's a nice house.

535
00:48:57,646 --> 00:48:58,647
Big.

536
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:02,401
Yeah. It's too big for me. You think?

537
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,071
I got nothing against big houses.

538
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:10,701
[clicks tongue]
Yeah. It was the family home.

539
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:12,452
You grew up here?

540
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:14,037
No, no, no.

541
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:18,208
Me and Jess bought it… [sucks teeth]
…after my mama died.

542
00:49:19,877 --> 00:49:22,379
Just… [sighs] …living here together.

543
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:29,636
Three years of me, her, Antoine.
[chuckles]

544
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:33,557
It was, uh…

545
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:49,114
Good.

546
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:55,412
You stayed?

547
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,081
Jess moved out, and I...

548
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:02,336
Yeah, I did. I stayed.

549
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,637
My mom stayed in the house we all shared.

550
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:14,515
She's the only one left.

551
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:16,475
I don't know what you're talking about.

552
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:22,481
I don't think it's healthy. Staying.

553
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:26,944
For her? Or for me?

554
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:32,449
Actually, me. [chuckles]

555
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:37,037
[chuckles] Hmm.

556
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:46,421
Uh, you know you don't... [sighs]
You don't have to live with your mother.

557
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,385
Mm-mmm. Could move in here.

558
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:52,678
- [chuckles]
- What?

559
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,930
[James] Yeah, move in.

560
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:57,558
You got your own room. [grunts]

561
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:00,769
You know how many rooms I got?
I wouldn't even know you was here.

562
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:05,732
I don't think that's...

563
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:08,819
I'm not... not h-hitting on you
or nothing. I'm just...

564
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:12,865
I know. But you're drunk.

565
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:16,451
- That's true. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

566
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:20,414
[breathes deeply]

567
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:23,000
It would just be nice
to have someone around.

568
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:25,419
Hmm.

569
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:29,047
Have coffee together in the morning.

570
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,466
You know, smoke in the evening.

571
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,220
Cook together sometimes.

572
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:41,018
It's what we used to do.

573
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:51,904
[James sighs]

574
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:55,866
Hey.

575
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,703
It's... It's whatever. Hmm.

576
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,626
Hmm. Thank you for the ride.

577
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,252
Sure.

578
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:31,610
[slow-tempo pop music playing]

579
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:43,539
Please don't judge me.

580
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:45,457
I'm not judging you.

581
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:49,545
Where you been?

582
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:51,046
Out with a friend.

583
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:52,881
Have you been drinking?

584
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:55,634
A little, maybe.

585
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,261
Lynsey.

586
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,055
I thought you were the responsible one.

587
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:01,932
I am the responsible one.

588
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:04,935
Just don't turn into your aunt Leslie.
[chuckles]

589
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:07,646
Or anyone from my family.

590
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:10,023
Or your father's side.

591
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,359
Okay, Mom.

592
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:14,278
[Lynsey's mom] You hungry?

593
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,113
I just had a burger.

594
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:17,364
"I just had a burger."

595
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:25,455
You used to be the funniest little kid,
then you became so serious.

596
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:33,255
Ah, you're probably tired.

597
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,051
You got work tomorrow?

598
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:42,890
This is luxury.

599
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:45,058
[Lynsey chuckles]

600
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:47,603
[laughs]

601
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:56,778
So, what are your doctors saying?

602
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:59,072
My next appointment's on the 22nd.

603
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,618
I'll drive you.

604
00:54:03,452 --> 00:54:04,828
Oh, you don't have to do that.

605
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:08,165
No, I wanna. They treat you better
if you have someone with you.

606
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:11,335
They know somebody cares about you,
so you must not be too awful.

607
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:16,089
- You sure?
- Yes! Is it that unbelievable?

608
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:17,174
Sorry.

609
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:19,510
Thank you.

610
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:23,388
Aren't your tits sweating?
Get your ass in this pool.

611
00:54:23,472 --> 00:54:24,473
[chuckles]

612
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:26,725
It's good for you. It'll relax you.

613
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:35,651
- Ah, geez, don't get in all at once.
- [Lynsey chuckles]

614
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:37,361
[Lynsey's mom laughs]

615
00:54:38,987 --> 00:54:41,031
Oh. [chuckles]

616
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:50,958
Ah! [laughing]

617
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,381
[Lynsey's mom sighs]

618
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:10,352
What?

619
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:13,856
Why did you go so far away?

620
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,235
I don't know. I wanted to.

621
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:22,489
But why? Why'd you wanna?

622
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,368
A lot of reasons.

623
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:30,664
Any you want to share?

624
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:33,834
No.

625
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:41,049
You just couldn't stand it here?

626
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:47,639
You can tell me the truth.

627
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:52,186
No, I couldn't.

628
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:03,071
When I was your age,
I couldn't stay in one place either.

629
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:06,366
I get you.

630
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:12,247
I really do.

631
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:25,260
[phone ringing]

632
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:35,896
Time for a refill. [chuckling]

633
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:42,778
[Lynsey chuckles]

634
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:45,822
[phone continues ringing]

635
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:57,042
[Lynsey's mom] Hello? Oh, hello, Ted.

636
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,379
Well, that's my voice.
That's what it sounds like.

637
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:07,094
No. No. [chuckles] I'm busy.
I'm having a night with my daughter.

638
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:08,595
How was your night?

639
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:14,810
[scoffs] Don't be cute. [sighs]

640
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:18,856
Well, you're an idiot
'cause I don't want to see you.

641
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:23,527
Oh, really?

642
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,573
Hold on a minute.
Let me move to the bedroom.

643
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:30,576
No, I'm not doing anything.

644
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:55,410
[gasping]

645
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,834
[breathing heavily]

646
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:50,591
Hey. Thank you. I'm so sorry.

647
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:52,092
Don't be sorry. It's cool.

648
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:55,220
[sighs]
Stupid to think I could depend on her.

649
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:56,972
She let you down a lot?

650
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:00,100
Yeah. Somehow it still surprises me.

651
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:01,602
[James chuckles]

652
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:05,272
It's all good. Come on, we got time.

653
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:08,734
Probably even got time to get you
that sno-ball you ain't get the other day.

654
01:00:08,817 --> 01:00:09,985
You think?

655
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:11,320
It's on me.

656
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:22,831
{\an8}Mmm, good.

657
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,543
{\an8}- Ah. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

658
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:27,711
{\an8}You're welcome.

659
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,589
{\an8}- Is that vanilla?
- Oh, yeah.

660
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:31,840
[Lynsey chuckles]

661
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:33,425
What? Something wrong with vanilla?

662
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:36,595
I just didn't even know they made vanilla.

663
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:38,847
[chuckles] Well, you got
a whole rainbow in your cup.

664
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,432
Yeah, that's the point.

665
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:44,811
Hey, it's all right.
I'll get you another one.

666
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:46,313
- No, I don't want...
- I got enough...

667
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:49,816
No, I don't want another sno-ball.
I wanna not fucking drop shit.

668
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:54,446
[sighs] Sorry.

669
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:57,908
So, you drop shit. What's that about?

670
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:00,869
I still have a few glitches
from the accident.

671
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:04,081
So that's what the doctor for?
Fixing that?

672
01:01:04,164 --> 01:01:06,124
No. I mean, I'm fixed.

673
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:10,754
[Lynsey chuckles]

674
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:18,679
Okay. [clears throat, sighs]

675
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:26,520
Say it.

676
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:29,439
- It's good.
- [chuckles]

677
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:33,277
So, this doctor you going to,
you just going for fun?

678
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:37,531
No, I need him to clear me,
so I can go back.

679
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:41,326
You got blown up over there,
and you wanna go back?

680
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:44,079
I just have to get out of here.

681
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:46,206
[James scoffs]

682
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:49,793
And all I need is this guy
to sign a piece of paper.

683
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:04,975
We'll get you another sno-ball.

684
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:08,020
I see you eyeing mine
and I ain't sharing it no more.

685
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:12,232
Look, I got enough cash
to cover you for two more.

686
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:14,234
After that, you on your own.

687
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:19,656
[James] How y'all doing? Aight. That good.

688
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:21,783
- [doctor] Headache?
- No.

689
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:23,952
- [doctor] Sleeping?
- Great.

690
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:26,330
Mood?

691
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:31,001
Fine. Yeah. I'm good.

692
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:39,301
I was actually thinking,
it's time for me to go back.

693
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:41,678
To the military?

694
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:43,680
Redeploy. Yes.

695
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:47,476
You honestly feel
you have a clean bill of health?

696
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,771
Yes. I have my post-deployment screening,

697
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:55,692
my hearing test, my vision test,
my scans from Nebraska.

698
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,361
What's left?

699
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:01,031
Possible risk of reinjury,
compounding the TBI,

700
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:03,242
and, above all, your mental health.

701
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:08,247
Well, that's my risk to take,
and I told you, I feel fine.

702
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:12,125
Lynsey, smoking is linked to lung cancer.

703
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:15,212
Extreme trauma is linked to PTSD
and depression.

704
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:16,964
In fact, the link is stronger.

705
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:19,758
I'm not ready to sign a waiver.

706
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:22,469
I'm the one that has to be ready.

707
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,138
[Dr. Lucas] It's both of us.

708
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:29,351
[music playing faintly inside car]

709
01:03:35,232 --> 01:03:36,567
- [engine stops]
- [music stops]

710
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,113
I really appreciate today.

711
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:43,615
[James] Sure.

712
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:48,245
I'm not working tomorrow.
Do you wanna come by in the afternoon?

713
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:51,623
Tomorrow afternoon?

714
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:53,125
[Lynsey] You working?

715
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:55,961
I make the schedule, so… [chuckles]

716
01:03:57,254 --> 01:04:01,175
Well, we could go to that pool on Octavia.
The owners are still out of town.

717
01:04:01,258 --> 01:04:06,180
Well, I'm not much of a swimmer, so…

718
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:09,016
We could just get high.

719
01:04:10,893 --> 01:04:11,894
Yeah, that could work.

720
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:13,729
[both chuckle]

721
01:04:14,563 --> 01:04:15,731
It's on me.

722
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:16,982
Oh, okay.

723
01:04:53,477 --> 01:04:55,479
[music playing faintly]

724
01:05:06,365 --> 01:05:07,366
[Lynsey] Okay.

725
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:11,453
We're gonna get in this pool now.

726
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:15,791
Nah. I'm still cool.

727
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:19,002
Come on. We gotta go swimming.

728
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,506
Owners are back next week.

729
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:26,635
[sighs]

730
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,723
[both chuckle]

731
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:41,775
Feels so good.

732
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:43,026
Mm-mmm.

733
01:05:43,527 --> 01:05:44,528
Come on.

734
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:48,365
[chuckles]

735
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:50,659
Yes.

736
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:56,331
- [chuckles]
- [James groans]

737
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:59,877
[James grunts, sighs]

738
01:06:12,472 --> 01:06:13,974
[James sighing]

739
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:31,158
[James sighs]

740
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:38,540
[James chuckles]

741
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,377
[James sighs]

742
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:45,339
[James yelps]

743
01:06:45,923 --> 01:06:47,257
[Lynsey chuckles]

744
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:49,510
Whoa!

745
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:53,138
[laughs] I can't believe
you actually got in.

746
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:54,223
[whimpers] Yeah.

747
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:57,434
[James laughs]

748
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:09,988
[Lynsey inhales deeply, exhales sharply]

749
01:07:10,072 --> 01:07:13,200
- Damn. How long was that?
- [exhales sharply]

750
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:15,244
I used to practice holding my breath
as a kid.

751
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,038
What's the longest you've ever held it?

752
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:20,207
Twenty-six years.

753
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:23,252
- Ah, I got you beat by four years.
- [Lynsey chuckles]

754
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:27,714
- Challenge me to a race? [chuckles]
- You sure about that?

755
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:28,882
You count it off.

756
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:31,218
- Three, two, one.
- Two, one.

757
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:32,928
[James] Oh, what the fuck? [yelps]

758
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:35,764
[James chuckling]

759
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:38,559
[James] Oh, shit.

760
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:41,979
- Michael Phelps! Whoo!
- [Lynsey] Oh.

761
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:43,480
[Lynsey] You didn't even try.

762
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:46,275
[James] Well, it ain't like I got
a propeller on this thing. Hmm?

763
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:08,672
[James] I feel like I lied to you.

764
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:11,675
When?

765
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:15,262
When I told you about the accident.

766
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:21,185
- [Lynsey] Lied how?
- Well, not lied. [groans]

767
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:24,563
I left something out. [sighs]

768
01:08:25,354 --> 01:08:28,649
I wasn't really clear,
and it's the same thing.

769
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:31,987
'Cause you didn't say
that you were driving?

770
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,741
Yeah.

771
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:40,787
You said you saw Jess
in the rearview mirror,

772
01:08:40,871 --> 01:08:42,581
so I kind of figured.

773
01:08:50,671 --> 01:08:51,715
Antoine...

774
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:56,178
He was sitting next to me.

775
01:08:58,388 --> 01:09:00,098
He was in the passenger seat.

776
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:04,937
Kept saying he wanted to sit next to me
in the front seat, so…

777
01:09:07,648 --> 01:09:09,149
And Jess said no,

778
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:14,696
that he was too small and that he
needed to be in the child seat.

779
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:19,451
And I said yes.

780
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,374
[clicks tongue] I said yes. [sighs]

781
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,171
I thought I was supposed to say yes
to shit like that.

782
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:38,095
Give him what he asks for.

783
01:09:39,304 --> 01:09:43,725
Hmm. [inhales deeply] Spoil him.
[exhales deeply]

784
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:45,935
- You see... Uh...
- I do.

785
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:49,606
- [James] No, I...
- No, you don't need to s-say anything.

786
01:09:51,692 --> 01:09:54,862
[James crying, breathing heavily]

787
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:19,720
[James moaning]

788
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:25,934
[kisses]

789
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:29,396
[sighs]
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

790
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:33,483
[sighs] Why'd you do it then?

791
01:10:36,278 --> 01:10:38,864
- I just felt so bad for you.
- [James sighs]

792
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:42,659
[James sighs]

793
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:49,583
No. James. James, come back.

794
01:10:50,584 --> 01:10:54,087
[James breathing heavily, groaning]

795
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:03,388
James. James. Don't go.

796
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:08,143
You felt bad for me?

797
01:11:08,852 --> 01:11:12,606
- I'm sorry. I didn't...
- I got enough people feeling bad for me.

798
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:14,650
[Lynsey sighs]

799
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,611
That's not how I meant it.

800
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:18,946
Then what'd you mean?

801
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:23,784
Ah, yeah, you don't know. What is this?

802
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:26,453
What is what?

803
01:11:26,537 --> 01:11:31,208
What are we doing here? Huh? [scoffs]

804
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:37,214
I pick you up, I drop you off,
and I buy you sno-balls, huh?

805
01:11:37,714 --> 01:11:41,009
Tell you something,
you want a driver, call a fucking taxi.

806
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:42,177
What you want from me?

807
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:45,055
So I don't want to fuck you,
now you don't want to be friends?

808
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:46,390
Oh, okay, I want to fuck you.

809
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:48,100
I want to fuck you,
but you just kissed me.

810
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:50,811
You really need to figure your shit out.
I don't even understand you.

811
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:53,647
Actually, I don't know shit about you,
but I tell you what I do know. Facts.

812
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,859
Uh, you blew up in Afghanistan
or Iraq or wherever the fuck it was.

813
01:11:56,942 --> 01:11:59,319
You... You played basketball
with my sister. Yeah.

814
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:02,489
- And, uh, you got a dead brother…
- I don't have a dead brother.

815
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:03,991
What'd you say?

816
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:05,784
When did I say I have a dead brother?

817
01:12:06,368 --> 01:12:11,123
He was. You miss him. You had.
Past tense. He always past tense.

818
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:12,833
- He's in prison.
- What?

819
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,835
He's a junkie and a dealer.

820
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,796
- You made me think he was dead.
- No.

821
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,008
Yeah, you did. 'Cause you only
talk about him like he dead.

822
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,179
Maybe that's how it feels.
Why does it fucking matter to you?

823
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:26,471
That is bullshit.

824
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:30,184
Oh, you want people to think he gone so
they don't know you left his ass for dead.

825
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:32,060
You don't know shit about it or about me.

826
01:12:32,144 --> 01:12:32,978
Oh, okay.

827
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:35,564
Did you just assume we were the same,
broken people wallowing in it?

828
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:37,107
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

829
01:12:38,734 --> 01:12:40,861
You think I lied about my brother?
What about you?

830
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:44,448
You let your nephew ride in the front seat
that night. What else did you leave out?

831
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:47,242
Were you drinking?

832
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:50,579
Were you drinking?

833
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:06,678
I'd had two beers.

834
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:13,352
What's your excuse though?

835
01:13:16,355 --> 01:13:19,942
How you treat your friends, your family...

836
01:13:20,859 --> 01:13:24,404
Everybody there, just to be escaped from.
Just to be left behind.

837
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,533
Like they let you down
instead of the other way around.

838
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:41,755
[gate slams]

839
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:03,652
[Lynsey grunts]

840
01:14:21,962 --> 01:14:23,964
[breathing heavily]

841
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:42,524
[breathing shakily]

842
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,960
[breathing shakily]

843
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:27,486
[breathes deeply]

844
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:36,662
[Dr. Lucas] And the other.

845
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:39,665
[Lynsey sighs]

846
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:48,090
I would like to go back.

847
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:52,177
It's a very hard judgment call.

848
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:55,347
I understand why you would think that.

849
01:15:55,848 --> 01:16:00,018
Do I still have any trace of my injury?
I'm sure.

850
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:05,524
But am I going to be a risk to anybody,
unable to carry out my duties? No.

851
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,901
I want to go where I'm useful.

852
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:11,238
Can you go back? Yes.

853
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:16,243
Should you go back?
It's a different question.

854
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:19,580
You said the link between trauma
and depression is stronger

855
01:16:19,663 --> 01:16:21,707
than the link between smoking and cancer.

856
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,125
[Dr. Lucas] Much stronger.

857
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:27,254
What if Afghanistan
wasn't the only trauma?

858
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:30,549
What then?

859
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:34,178
[inhales sharply, sighs]

860
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:42,227
[Dr. Lucas] Okay, Lynsey.
I'll sign the waiver.

861
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:48,317
[bottles clinking]

862
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,561
[engine starts]

863
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:37,491
[line ringing]

864
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:39,993
[recorded greeting]
<i>It's James. Leave a message.</i>

865
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:50,045
[Lynsey sighs]

866
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:05,018
You're all set. Bring it back
if it gives you any problems.

867
01:18:05,102 --> 01:18:07,354
Thanks. Uh, is James in?

868
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:09,815
Not today. No.

869
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:14,695
All right.
Well, how much do I owe you guys?

870
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:16,780
Didn't James tell you? It's free.

871
01:18:17,322 --> 01:18:18,323
What?

872
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:21,076
Yeah, he said you were in the Army
or something.

873
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:33,046
[Lynsey sighs]

874
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:35,692
It's you.

875
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:37,361
You're alive.

876
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:38,445
[Lynsey chuckles]

877
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:40,822
Yeah I'm alive.

878
01:19:40,906 --> 01:19:42,157
[prisoner breathes deeply]

879
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:44,451
It's been a long time.

880
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:49,790
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

881
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:56,547
Don't worry. Mom hasn't come
to see me since sentencing.

882
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:58,006
Really?

883
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,675
Yeah.

884
01:20:00,384 --> 01:20:01,468
Is she okay?

885
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:04,012
She's fine.

886
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:08,141
I worry about her.

887
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:10,644
She wrote me a letter.

888
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:14,481
Seems like she's having a hard time.

889
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:20,821
Mom can take care of herself.

890
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:23,907
How are you?

891
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:27,035
I'm good.

892
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:30,873
You know. I'm comfortable.

893
01:20:32,249 --> 01:20:34,251
Are you healthy?

894
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:41,341
Am I healthy?

895
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:44,595
I've been trying to gain some weight.

896
01:20:45,262 --> 01:20:47,764
I've got some friends in here.

897
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:51,643
There's not much to do.

898
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:54,521
So I've been trying to go to the gym.

899
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,481
[prisoner chuckles]

900
01:21:01,862 --> 01:21:03,572
Honestly…

901
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:08,160
I'm better off in here.

902
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:11,330
[prisoner sighs]

903
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:13,582
[prisoner chuckles]

904
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:20,339
I'm safe here.

905
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:24,635
Out there, I don't trust myself.

906
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:35,020
Enough about me.

907
01:21:35,854 --> 01:21:38,106
How are you?

908
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:43,904
I'm good.

909
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:47,950
I got hurt.

910
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:54,122
But…

911
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:56,834
[Lynsey whimpers]

912
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:59,378
…I'm okay.

913
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:08,595
I'm really sorry.

914
01:22:13,016 --> 01:22:17,020
I'm not sad for me.

915
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:25,487
I'm just sorry too.

916
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:31,118
[prisoner breathes deeply]

917
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:40,210
I miss you.

918
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:42,379
I miss you.

919
01:22:43,589 --> 01:22:44,882
[prisoner chuckles]

920
01:23:00,189 --> 01:23:01,190
[prisoner sniffles]

921
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:22,461
[people chattering]

922
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,334
[James exhales heavily]

923
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:45,419
What's going on?

924
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:48,964
I know that truck ain't break down.

925
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:54,970
Truck's fine. Thanks for that.
You didn't have to do that.

926
01:24:57,055 --> 01:24:58,265
So, what you doing here?

927
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:01,518
Um…

928
01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:10,569
You asked me if I wanted to move in,
remember?

929
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:14,072
No.

930
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,579
[sighs] I remember.

931
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:39,932
Would you wanna make the offer again?

932
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:43,268
[scoffs]

933
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:49,608
It would be good to have someone around.

934
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:54,530
Have coffee with in the morning.
Smoke in the evening.

935
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:57,241
Cook dinner sometimes.

936
01:26:00,619 --> 01:26:02,037
And what's that supposed to mean?

937
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:05,707
They're all things you said.

938
01:26:08,252 --> 01:26:09,545
[James chuckles]

939
01:26:10,587 --> 01:26:12,923
[clicks tongue] So… [sighs]

940
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:17,678
…you're not leaving?

941
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:23,267
I don't think so. Not now, at least.

942
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:37,322
And…

943
01:26:39,157 --> 01:26:40,617
I'm trying to make a friend.
