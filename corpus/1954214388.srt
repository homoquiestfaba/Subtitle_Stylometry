1
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,722
Here is your legacy, Damian.

2
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,835
Here is your inheritance.

3
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,870
The League of Assassins.

4
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,201
Yes, Grandfather.

5
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,842
They will be yours to command.

6
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,036
To make certain the Earth abides
in natural contentment...

7
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,942
without the abuse of man.

8
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:16,952
It is good to see our revered father
so devoted to his grandson.

9
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,220
Yes. brother, it is.

10
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,767
We have been breached.
They are already inside. Take the boy.

11
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,068
Who would dare?

12
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,774
Stay here, Damian.

13
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,172
Hold your" fire.

14
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,603
He's mine.

15
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,642
Confused, old man'?

16
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,640
<i>'Slade .</i>

17
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,647
What is the meaning of this outrage?

18
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,843
I call it a hostile takeover.

19
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:13,283
Your arrogance embarrasses me
and shames you.

20
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,619
You still have some spring in your step.

21
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,558
Let's see how you do
against a real swordsman.

22
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,688
Come and get some.

23
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,993
After you, boy.

24
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,509
How could you have pushed me out?

25
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,111
I was your right hand.

26
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,474
Your actions decided for you.

27
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,674
He's in positron.

28
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,683
Let's move.

29
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,793
After 500 years. the world's had
quite enough of you, old man

30
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,663
The Lazarus Pit
will not bring you back this time.

31
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,834
Grandfather.

32
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,485
So you're Talia's little bastard.

33
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,061
Not bad for a child.

34
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,129
But new, we end it.

35
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,839
Now your heart. Unh!

36
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,947
I'll make you suffer for this, boy.

37
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,145
Next time.

38
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,356
Ubu.

39
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,293
Come back and finish it, traitors.

40
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,677
Grandfather.

41
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,848
Grandfather?

42
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,286
Grandfather? Grandfather.

43
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,998
Damian.

44
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,695
Damian. wait.

45
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,407
Damian.

46
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,411
No.

47
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,881
Unh! We have to get him
into the Lazarus Pit.

48
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,562
<i>SKIP-.</i>

49
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,563
We have to try. We can't just leave him.

50
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,757
He's dead.

51
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,067
The Pit can restore a body
this damaged.

52
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,543
He's beyond healing.

53
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,643
You did your best.

54
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,482
I failed.

55
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,656
We can't think about that now.
We have to move. Come.

56
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,931
Damian. now.

57
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:27,665
Where are we going?

58
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,431
Gotham City.

59
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,600
It's time to meet your father.

60
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,834
Waylon Jones, aka. Killer Croc.

61
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,499
Stealing drugs isn't your usual MO.

62
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,349
You.

63
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,387
When half the biotech firms in town get hit,
I get curious.

64
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,826
You look like
you've been working out, Croc.

65
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,561
The tail's new.

66
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,929
Yeah, got an upgrade.

67
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,048
That's right, run.

68
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,450
What's your hurry. Croc?

69
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,350
I'm not done with you.

70
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,150
You know, Bats...

71
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:05,387
...the problem with steroids is
I get the munchies.

72
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,434
Hello, my love.
You should have warned your play date.

73
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,941
I'm the only one who can bite you.

74
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,985
Would you like a drink?

75
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,026
Last time, that didn't go so well.

76
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,355
Oh, you're right.

77
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:42,227
If I remember correctly,
I put a little something in your beverage.

78
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,959
Same way I remember it.

79
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,900
- It made you romantic.
-It made me do what you wanted.

80
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,605
Was xi all bad, beloved'?

81
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,910
No, it wasn't all bad.

82
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,642
Then you remember
our shared moonlight'?

83
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:01,877
Some of it.

84
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,550
The best parts'?

85
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,625
Talia, what do you want?

86
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,225
My father, he's dead.

87
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:17,163
- Ra's?
- How many fathers do I have?

88
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,701
Sorry. He always seemed--

89
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,738
Like you? Indestructible?

90
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,172
Huh. You haven't seen my x-rays.

91
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,277
Maybe you can show them to me
sometime.

92
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,213
You don't seem all that broken up
about Ra's' death.

93
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,383
There is no time for mourning.

94
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,580
Assassins planned to take over
Ra's' organization.

95
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,057
They are led by a man who Father believed
could be his successor.

96
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,254
Until my father became aware of you.

97
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,262
Now this man wants to kill us.

98
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,864
- Us?
- Not you.

99
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,035
Me...

100
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,504
...and your son.

101
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,268
Son?

102
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,108
You expect me to believe this?

103
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,986
I assure you, he's yours.

104
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,322
Don't look so stunned, Father.

105
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,625
I thought you'd be taller.

106
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,432
You didn't know about me'?

107
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,872
No.

108
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,640
So Mother has made me
your responsibility?

109
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,305
Something like that.

110
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,645
This isn't necessary. I do fine by myself.

111
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,412
So do I.

112
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,453
But things have changed.

113
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,081
She thinks you'll be better off with me,
for now.

114
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,621
What do you think?

115
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,264
Better than with
the League of Assassins.

116
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,762
They taught me how to fight.

117
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,966
And I take it not much else.

118
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,499
- I'll drive.
- No'

119
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,201
- I know how.
- No.

120
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,310
- /-Alfred'?
- Yes, sir.

121
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,754
- We're going to have company.
ALFRED <i>A</i> sleepover?

122
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,517
<i>Oh. goody.</i>

123
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,998
[GASPS

124
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,876
Hmm.

125
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,846
So close.

126
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,416
Morn said leave your test tubes
and come now. She has dinner.

127
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,213
In a minute. I'm close to a breakthrough.

128
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,091
You're always close to a breakthrough.

129
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:31,058
Rebecca, I'm doing it for us.

130
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,357
Oh, making something turn blue in a tube,
that's for us?

131
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,757
Do what you like.

132
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,067
Perhaps I could use a bite.

133
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,676
I'm starting to see double here.

134
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,402
Wait up.

135
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,767
Welcome back, sir.

136
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,171
I presume this is the young man
of whom you spoke'?

137
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,074
Hello, Pennyworth. I've heard of you.

138
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,738
At your service, Master Damian.

139
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,752
Where are the rest of the servants?

140
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,653
I am the sum total.

141
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,587
You have only one servant'?

142
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,751
He's not a servant. He's a friend.

143
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,126
So this is the fabled Batcave.

144
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,496
Grandfather told me all about it.

145
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,173
Smaller than I imagined.

146
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,611
Very efficient, though.

147
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,951
He is the spitting image
of you at that age.

148
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,788
It's a bit chilling.

149
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,523
Tell me about it.
Look, you're gonna have to get him settled.

150
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:19,158
I'm not sure how long he'll be here,
but for the time being, this will be his home.

151
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,303
Looks rather effeminate, don't you think?

152
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,175
Master Dick was a boy
when he wore that.

153
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,211
Where is he new?

154
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,875
Moved on. And so shall we.

155
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,251
Would you like to see
where you" be sleeping?

156
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,820
I hope this isn't too cramped for you.

157
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,866
That door heads to your bath.

158
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,129
The other, to a game room.

159
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,901
And you also have this
far your amusement.

160
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,579
Naturally, you have the run
of the mansion.

161
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,147
Of course. I know that.

162
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,845
Prepare some tea, Pennyworth.

163
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,516
Brown sugar instead of white,
fresh-cut lemon. a china cup.

164
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,690
Perhaps master would like
some warm mixed nuts...

165
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,732
...and a moist hand towel.

166
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:28,304
Watch yourself, Pennyworth. I'm not
so young that I don't understand sarcasm.

167
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:32,603
While I am much too old to care.

168
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,451
I have been released by Master Damian.

169
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,588
I miss him already.

170
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,052
How is he?

171
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,957
Facing the shock of downsizing, sir.

172
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,563
Nothing on cable?

173
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:00,295
An old video of Ra's being revived
by the Lazarus Pit.

174
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,734
He's cheated death so many times...

175
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:07,241
...it's hard to accept
that he failed to escape this time.

176
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,208
My son's role model.

177
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:33,096
- Francine.
-Kirk? What have you done?

178
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,795
Who are these people?

179
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,434
Please, let her go.
This is some kind of misunderstanding.

180
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,099
I am doing my part.

181
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,770
Your family is all right, for now.

182
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,942
Nice meal. Vegan.

183
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:50,485
They say eating meat
can make a person savage.

184
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,951
I didn't know, Daddy.

185
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,390
True, we arrived in her absence.

186
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,618
We are a stealthy lot.

187
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,722
Rebecca, Francine, it's okay.

188
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,400
Everything is gonna be all right.

189
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,860
You sound so certain.

190
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,335
Why are you here?

191
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,704
I'm proceeding according to plan.

192
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,972
Ah, you seem to think
I'm part of the old agreement.

193
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,979
I am not.

194
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,948
Find to make that perfectly clear,
from this point on...

195
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,520
...I will be arranging
separate accommodations for your family.

196
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,282
[GASPS

197
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,121
Rebecca!

198
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,728
Please, don't harm them.

199
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,558
Of course not.

200
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,204
Unless you disappoint me.

201
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,837
[GASPS

202
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,735
You wouldn't want to disappoint me.

203
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,171
Who are you?

204
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,170
Let me put <i>n</i> this way, doctor.

205
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:51,679
Ra's al emu has been retired.

206
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,783
I am his successor.

207
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,783
My name is Slade Wilson.

208
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,417
You will call me...

209
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,083
...Deathstroke.

210
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,104
I've gotta get down to the office.
How's Damian?

211
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,441
See for yourself.

212
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,941
He's been at it since 5:00 this morning.

213
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,020
I hope you don't mind, sir,
the sword is your grandfather's.

214
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,656
The one on the wall plaque'?

215
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,838
I think we might be able
to skip the gardener this month.

216
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,040
Well, he was trained
by the League of Assassins.

217
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,209
L, myself, am rooting for the shrubbery.

218
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,922
He has talent.

219
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:27,338
Don't worry, baby, it'll be okay.

220
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,603
Will it?

221
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,769
We have to have faith in your father.

222
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,644
Isn't he the reason we're here?

223
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,449
What's the holdup, doctor'?

224
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,956
<i>The mutagen is unstable
when added to my original formula...</i>

225
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,459
<i>...but I'm very close
to solving the problem.</i>

226
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,688
<i>RN be better and more powerful
than ever.</i>

227
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,129
Perhaps you need more persuasion.

228
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,862
I know your family is very anxious for you
to complete your work.

229
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,529
<i>And F will, soon.</i>

230
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,039
Make it happen, Dr. Langstrom.

231
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:02,873
It will be best for everyone if you do.

232
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,715
- When can we talk about the Carlin account?
- Soon.

233
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,221
This afternoon is free for all--

234
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,825
- Uh, here.
- Not that soon.

235
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,552
- I heard LexCorp's ready to pounce if--
- Where'd you hear that?

236
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,993
It's on the street.
Carlin was m Metropolis last week.

237
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,527
Son of a-
We have a confidentiality agreement.

238
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,294
Read him the riot act.

239
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,029
- WOMAN Bruce, you gotta call him.
- Lay down the law.

240
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,501
What the hell?

241
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,402
Your profit margin is down in Argentina.

242
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,410
Someone is skimming revenue.

243
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,713
Argentina? That's my division.

244
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,715
- Bruce.
-It's okay. It's all right.

245
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,876
I'll deal with this.

246
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,514
- What are you doing?
-Reviewing my birthright.

247
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,625
This will be mine someday.

248
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:53,559
- How did you get in here?
-A bird's nest has better security.

249
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,954
We need to talk.

250
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:00,333
Deathstroke has a contact stationed here.
- In Gotham?

251
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,229
We find him. we find Deathstroke.

252
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,931
We could take Deathstroke out...

253
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,043
...permanently.

254
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:10,510
- We don't kill.
- I was taught you destroy your enemy.

255
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:13,412
- That makes you like them.
- It makes me better than them.

256
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,815
Deathstroke killed my grandfather.
He has to pay.

257
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,283
Ra's was a madman.

258
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:22,415
He was a hero. He died a hero.

259
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,923
Ubu's Deathstroke's right-hand man.
He used to work for my grandfather.

260
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:33,400
He stays in Gotham City between missions
to indulge his vices...

261
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,937
...according to Mother.
I looked up the rest.

262
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,438
This is classified mater--

263
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,543
You downloaded this from the computer
in the Batcave, didn't you'?

264
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,839
I hacked into NORAD when I was 6.

265
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,242
It was easy.

266
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,022
Alfred is to take you directly home.
No stops.

267
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:03,689
You will not go off on your own
you will stay away from the computer...

268
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:06,837
...and you will stay out of sight.
Do you understand?

269
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,831
I owe my grandfather a death.

270
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,041
Deathstroke is mine.

271
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,529
Poor Talia.

272
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:49,728
Ra's would be so disappointed.

273
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,941
No.

274
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,775
I want her alive.

275
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,625
Croc's coming dawn
from whatever juice he was on.

276
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,854
The drugs he was stealing
were mutagens.

277
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,795
I think we have a pretty good idea
for whom.

278
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,798
He's too far gone to interrogate.

279
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:56,099
- And if he wasn't, Fm not sure he'd talk.
- Let's find out.

280
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,180
You're falling apart, Croc.

281
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,613
You're even shedding your scams.

282
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,580
It's over. You got the last fix
you're gonna get from Langstrom.

283
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,847
Where is he?

284
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,853
Screw you.

285
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,999
They're afraid to medicate you, Croc.

286
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,798
They don't wanna get too close.

287
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,034
But Fm not afraid.

288
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:34,666
You help me, I'll help you.

289
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,814
Bar's to your right.

290
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,711
Make yourself at home.

291
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,017
Heh, hope there's no cameras in here.

292
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,520
And you're gonna have
to keep this window shut-..

293
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,318
...If you want me to take my things off.
Ha, ha.

294
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,559
Here.

295
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:43,825
Hey.

296
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,442
I'm going to give you
to the count of three. One...

297
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,606
Leave, harlots.

298
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,369
- Right. Get out here. Hurry; up.
-I'm not paid enough for this.

299
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,042
Where is Deathstroke?

300
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,119
Did you think it would be that easy'?

301
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,050
Just ask and I would talk'?

302
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:15,080
I don't want it to be easy.

303
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,586
Huh?

304
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,378
Ha!

305
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,899
You'll get nothing from me.

306
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,407
Either I get answers
or you get the sword.

307
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,506
Do your worst.

308
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,263
The psychos just keep getting younger.

309
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,937
- Talk.
- Missing something?

310
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,733
<i>Not in the mood for games.</i>

311
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,375
I have a kid here.

312
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,306
Says he's your son.

313
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,574
I'll be right there.

314
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:34,853
Really ticks me off alter all those lectures
he gave me about using protection.

315
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,293
Indeed.

316
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,429
Are you all right, Master Dick?

317
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,197
I took the cut, I can take the stitch.

318
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,136
Maybe you need more anesthetic.

319
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,798
- And maybe you need to go f--
- Master Dick.

320
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:50,037
Maybe you should remember
who the blood son is.

321
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:53,145
"Bloodthirsty" is more like it.

322
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,630
- This was you rs?
-Still is.

323
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,233
Keep your hands off it, kid.

324
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,471
Is this what you wore in training?

325
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,634
It's what I wore when I went on patrol.

326
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,111
The only thing it's missing
is lace trim and a sun hat.

327
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,846
You don't fool me.

328
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:30,145
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking you could be Robin.

329
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,946
Well, you can't.

330
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,387
I don't need some insipid costume
and a bird name.

331
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,187
I'm way beyond
your kind of simplistic training.

332
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,090
As you saw tonight.

333
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:44,331
Don't forget, you lost that fight.

334
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,160
How's Ubu?

335
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:52,099
<i>He's got more monitors connected to him
than Arkham has Lunatics.</i>

336
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,367
Can he talk?

337
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,539
Talk?

338
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,976
It's a wonder he can breathe.

339
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,109
<i>H! stay in touch.</i>

340
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,484
He doesn't deserve to breathe.

341
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,861
Uh-oh.

342
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,829
Do you know what you were tonight'?
You weren't a warrior, you weren't a soldier.

343
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,366
- You were a child.
-If it hadn't been for him, I--

344
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,300
If it hadn't been for Dick,
you'd have gone too far.

345
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,506
It's easier my way.

346
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,903
It has nothing to do with easy.

347
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:31,036
It's about doing what's right because
it's right, that's the only reason you need.

348
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,442
Seemed right to me.

349
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:33,844
That's the problem.

350
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,180
Heads up.

351
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,255
Good reﬂexes.

352
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,223
What if I had missed?

353
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,055
It would have hurt.

354
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,758
- ifs a League of Assassins star.
- Found it in a warehouse...

355
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:55,734
...belonging to a man named Langstrom.
Ring a Dell'?

356
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,765
- No.
-It appears there's a connection...

357
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,410
...to Ra's and Deathstroke.

358
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,477
Then we need to find out what it is.

359
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:04,773
I need to find out.

360
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:09,282
- I wanna help. like he used to.
- Bad enough you've given yourself away...

361
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,183
...and let them know we're onto them,
but you're letting vengeance guide you.

362
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,119
You've never felt vengeful'?

363
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,652
Every day.

364
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,352
You have to keep your center, Damian.

365
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:23,898
You can't fight crime
by becoming a criminal.

366
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:28,399
From now on, stay close. That's an order.

367
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,430
I can do that.

368
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,938
Wait a minute.

369
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,969
I'm not gonna like this. am W

370
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,903
Nope.

371
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,431
Jim.

372
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,137
Is there any way you could show up
without raising my blood pressure?

373
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,792
Another one?
- I'll explain later.

374
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,359
How's Ubu doing?

375
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,894
He's in ICU, still under sedation.

376
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,259
We searched his place,
nothing much there.

377
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,431
But <i>we</i> did find one interesting item.

378
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,896
Hey.

379
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,501
Whose number is it?

380
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,802
It's a phone se--

381
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:45,309
Uh, a phone chat line.

382
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,282
But that's not the interesting part,
it's what's written on the other side.

383
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,911
Dad used to bring me here
for ball games.

384
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:25,577
Sometimes afterward,
we'd go to the amusement park.

385
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,020
Find now history repeats itself.

386
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,523
Let's go.

387
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:38,565
We made a deal.
You're backup and this <i>is</i> no game.

388
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,101
Think before you act.

389
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,871
Surveillance cameras.

390
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,715
Somebody is watching.

391
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,776
Very well. You lead.

392
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,592
How did you know this was here?

393
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,128
I make it my business to know.

394
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:16,636
We can jump them.

395
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,569
We need to find Langstrom.

396
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,731
Quietly.

397
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,214
Down there.

398
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,160
Dr. Langstrom.

399
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:47,101
- You?
- You have to come with us.

400
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:49,465
No. No; no. I can't.

401
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,774
Deathstroke has my family.

402
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:58,141
He says he'll kill them
if I don't do what he wants.

403
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,576
Where is Deathstroke?

404
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,310
I don't know. You have to believe me.

405
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,181
- I'll make you talk.
- Robin, no.

406
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:20,125
- No swords.
- Fine.

407
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:42,181
Ha, ha. That was fun.

408
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,450
Which way'?

409
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,554
- Time to retreat.
- I'm no coward.

410
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,698
Don't be stupid.

411
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,394
Come on.

412
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,240
Listen.

413
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,088
Man-Bats.

414
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,808
Okay, now what'?

415
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,162
Ah, stupid kid.

416
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:42,176
[GASPS

417
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:49,782
Robin.

418
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,184
Huh. Lucky.

419
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,029
- Where am I?
- Just start talking.

420
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,034
Ra's wanted me to splice
animal DNA to human...

421
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:11,139
...using advanced mutagens.

422
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,674
He would provide volunteers
for me to work on.

423
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,335
Obviously, you took him up on it.

424
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,347
I knew it would mean prison if anyone
discovered I was up to my old experiments.

425
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:25,185
But how do you say no to Ra's al Ghul'?

426
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,620
He wanted you to make
the ultimate warriors.

427
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,554
Yes.

428
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,485
Ra's called it Operation Air Strike.

429
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:38,259
No military could withstand an army
of flying super-powered ninjas...

430
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,493
...using sonar in the dead of night.

431
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:42,194
But Deathstroke took over.

432
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,271
The formula was my ace in the hole.

433
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:48,205
I kept working on it,
making improvements.

434
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:51,347
If I completely finished it,
I didn't know what he might do.

435
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:52,674
wheres your" family?

436
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:56,649
I don't know.
He let me speak to them once, briefly.

437
00:47:56,807 --> 00:48:00,277
My daughter mentioned something
about snow.

438
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,084
Uh, two mountain peaks
that she said looked like cat ears.

439
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,591
Interlaken, Grandfather's compound.

440
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:09,061
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

441
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:12,264
Can you make an antidote
to the Man-Bat formula?

442
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,492
With the right materials,
the right equipment?

443
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:17,496
It's possible, but what about my family?

444
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,197
Leave them to us.

445
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:48,798
I know where you took the boy.

446
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,234
He fights like an assassin.

447
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,104
Like you.

448
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,406
Your romance with the Dark Knight
wasn't merely rumor.

449
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:01,277
Who is he? Who is Batman?

450
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,747
Do what you must.

451
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,653
I won't talk.

452
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,082
I believe you.

453
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,553
Besides. you won't need
to look for them.

454
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,193
They'll find you first.

455
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,625
Works for me.

456
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,993
- I hope you're right about this.
- I know these mountains well.

457
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,196
Pare been climbing them since I was 4-.

458
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,931
It was a part of my training.

459
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,098
That's some training for a 4-year-old.

460
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:31,041
First time I climbed, [fell.
Broke my wrist.

461
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,977
I made it to the top anyway.

462
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:34,946
It was expected.

463
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,381
I was Ra's al Ghul's grandson.

464
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,950
Was it all like that, Damian'?

465
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,057
I was being groomed to lead humanity,
like my grandfather.

466
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:45,353
We were going to create
a whole new world.

467
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:47,689
- By killing.
If that's what it took.

468
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:51,322
How do you hope to lead humanity
when you've never been a pan of it?

469
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:56,465
What about you'? From what I heard,
your childhood wasn't a lot of fun either.

470
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:59,836
I had my traumas,
but I also had people around me to help.

471
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,001
Alfred, Dick, others. I had friends.

472
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,477
As far as I can tell,
all you've had are trainers.

473
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:08,947
There's a difference, Damian.

474
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,481
There's the stronghold.

475
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,953
Beyond those peaks.

476
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,902
Nothing.

477
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:41,908
Why are we wasting time
when it's obvious they've abandoned it?

478
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:45,019
Wait. Listen.

479
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:51,450
A false wall.

480
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:10,840
Please, don't hurt us.

481
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:12,843
Please.

482
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,384
We're not here to hurt you.

483
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,680
Oh, Batman. Thank heavens.

484
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,490
- Where's Kirk?
- Safe.

485
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,957
We've been so afraid.

486
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,685
You're all right now.

487
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,232
Robin, you saved us.

488
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,925
This is totally unnecessary.

489
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,770
Deathstroke said he would spare us
if I gave this to "you.

490
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:43,876
Don't tell Batman. Please.

491
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,657
There's a landing pad
on the other side of this stronghold.

492
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:59,886
I'll call Interpol to send a helicopter.

493
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,996
Shouldn't take long.

494
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,605
<i>I have your mother, Damian.</i>

495
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,301
<i>This is her location.</i>

496
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:15,640
<i>Perhaps you've been there.</i>

497
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,677
<i>This is between you and me.</i>

498
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:21,373
<i>Leave the sperm donor out of it.</i>

499
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:29,385
<i>H! give you 48 hours
before I end her suffering.</i>

500
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,987
<i>Be worthy of your heritage, boy.</i>

501
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,756
<i>Make your mother proud.</i>

502
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,311
<i>Why are you staying in London?</i>

503
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,386
Interpol. I'm bringing them in on it.

504
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,053
<i>Hows the lime prince?</i>

505
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,657
Sends his love.

506
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:05,589
He just ordered room service.

507
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,054
<i>Maybe he's human after all.</i>

508
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,788
What about Langstrom?

509
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:13,332
<i>Ever since I told him his family's safe
he's been</i> a <i>scientist on fire.</i>

510
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,561
Once actually on fire.

511
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:18,969
Something exploded, I had to put him out.
Minor burns.

512
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,870
<i>But he is producing the antidote?</i>

513
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,374
<i>Hundreds of doses.</i>

514
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,841
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

515
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,077
Deathstroke has Talia.

516
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,342
Langstrom's wife said
there was another prisoner.

517
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,546
A woman.

518
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:34,686
I think Talia attacked the stronghold
and got captured.

519
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:37,451
I saw signs of torture in one of the cells.

520
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,355
<i>But no idea where she is now?</i>

521
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,226
None.

522
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:43,464
Have you found anything?

523
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:47,826
Maybe. 1% dormant oil rig
belonging to Ra's, part of a shell company-..

524
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:51,097
...went active a few weeks back.
I thought that was interesting.

525
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,037
That is interesting. Hold on.

526
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,101
Damian?

527
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:02,473
<i>- Where's the oil rig?
- Close to you.</i>

528
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,915
- How close?
- Scotland.

529
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,749
Off the Outer Hebrides. What's wrong?

530
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,621
Damn it' He's gone'
And took his uniform.

531
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,728
Bruce, chill.

532
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:17,855
<i>The rig is 50 mikes off the coast.
What's he gonna do? Swim there?</i>

533
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:26,333
Stay on alert.

534
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,664
If so much as a seagull
tries to land on this rig.-.

535
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,670
...shoot it.

536
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,987
It's a Kid. Get him!

537
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:15,441
I wouldn't make any threatening moves.

538
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,474
They'll stay put as long as I tell them to.

539
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:21,138
A Lazarus Pit.

540
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:22,579
That's right, boy.

541
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:26,653
The only thing this rig pumps
is life everlasting.

542
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,051
To the highest bidder.

543
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,526
Looks like your mother could use a dip.

544
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,596
Let her go, monster, now!

545
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,867
Now, this is what they call a standoff.

546
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:44,062
Not even the Pit can bring back Mommy
if her head's blown off.

547
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,673
Your may, Damian.

548
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,416
I should congratulate you
for getting this far...

549
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:05,425
...but that would be like applauding
a suicide.

550
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,955
You are such an arrogant little brat.

551
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:11,031
So entitled, so bloodthirsty-..

552
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:13,259
...so easy to manipulate.

553
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:18,902
to kill you-.

554
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:21,508
- Goodbye, boy.
- Run, Damian.

555
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,399
We are done.

556
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,580
Kill them.

557
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,437
Mother!

558
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,543
I've got her.

559
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,448
Damian'
- I'll end him. I swear.

560
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:21,149
Eat it, you damn dirty bastards.

561
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:11,371
Ra's trained me to take his place.

562
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:16,876
Talia would have been mine as well,
until your father came along.

563
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,446
And created something special. Me.

564
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,326
Now your luck ends.

565
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:19,456
You call it luck, I call it skill.

566
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,058
Ah!

567
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:30,068
I knew you would save us.

568
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:32,037
I haven't yet.

569
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:41,887
- Beloved.
-The- whole place is collapsing.

570
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:56,825
Go ahead.

571
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,624
Finish me.

572
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,894
You were trained to kill your enemies,
weren't you?

573
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,636
It's what you want.

574
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,569
It's what I would do.

575
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:09,369
It's what your grandfather would do.

576
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,679
Well, do it!

577
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:18,013
No. I'm my father's son too.

578
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,979
I'm Robin.

579
01:06:30,854 --> 01:06:31,924
Mother.

580
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,458
Come.

581
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,068
Gel in.

582
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:55,272
I thank you for my life
and the life of my son.

583
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,212
Our son.

584
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:03,152
I need to rebuild the League.
Make it stronger, better.

585
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,422
Come with me.

586
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:10,430
You and I, together with Damian,
would be invincible.

587
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:14,029
The best way to fix the League
is to disband it.

588
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,072
If only it were that easy.

589
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,503
Damian should stay with me.

590
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,339
He will want to be with his mother.

591
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:30,874
He's Robin now.
He stays with the Batman.

592
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,589
Damian, are you ready to come?

593
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:40,092
If that's your wish, Mother.

594
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:56,608
Learn from your father, Damian,
for he is very Wise...

595
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,179
...and you are the future.

596
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,759
I will come back for him.

597
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,089
Make him great.

598
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,027
I will.

599
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,184
Let's go home, Damian.

600
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:44,889
- I'll drive.
- No.

601
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:47,324
- I know how.
- No.
