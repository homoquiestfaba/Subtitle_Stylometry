it's only one side.

You know, they say when you see someone's true colours, you're really seeing them.

653

And to see someone's true colours, means to see the truth.

Oh my God, my bags.

728
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:17,274
Hey, hey. Rachini Garabini.

729
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:19,013
We've gotta stop meeting like this.

730
00:44:19,013 --> 00:44:21,375
Where are my presents?

731
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,565
Sorry, I didn't get you anything this year.

732
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:28,710
RICHARD: Wait!

733
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:37,712
Billy I need a ride.

734
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:39,102
Thousand bucks.

735
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:41,917
Or, a trick.

736
00:44:42,995 --> 00:44:45,289
(BOTH GRUNTING)

737
00:44:48,973 --> 00:44:50,571
(SCREAMS)

738
00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:52,240
Ow.

739
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:54,082
That's a hell of a fall, Richard.

740
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:55,438
Wow.

741
00:44:56,272 --> 00:44:58,044
How are you? Are you okay?

742
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,389
I am in a circle of hell...

743
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:04,961
(SHOUTS) that Dante never even dreamed of.

744
00:45:06,525 --> 00:45:07,672
Be that as it may,

745
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:10,279
Uh, my aunt and uncle are coming over for dinner.

746
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:12,051
-Yes. -They have a car.

747
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:13,998
Yes, they have a car.

748
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:15,770
Let's go inside and take care of you.

749
00:45:15,805 --> 00:45:18,169
-Warm clothes? Warm clothes? -Get you warm.

750
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:19,524
FRED: No, it looks good.

751
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:21,401
Apparently it belonged to Liberace.

752
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:24,772
Besides, it's either that or you'll have to wear Dennis clothes.

753
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,649
Fine, fine.

754
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:29,291
So, how long will it take for my suit to dry?

755
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:33,392
Would a suit be "delicate", "permanent press" or "normal dry"?

756
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:35,512
Normal, I guess.

757
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:38,780
So as soon as your uncle gets here,

758
00:45:38,814 --> 00:45:41,213
-you can give me a ride straight into town, right? -(DRYER BEEPING)

759
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:44,062
I have a confession to make.

760
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:47,260
I arranged with the MC that you would lose the contest.

761
00:45:47,295 --> 00:45:49,624
After you knew I needed the money?

762
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:52,195
Well, I need your help to lift the curse.

763
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,629
"Curse?"

764
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:55,985
The curse of the...

765
00:45:57,618 --> 00:45:58,487
wild turkey.

766
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,920
"The curse of the wild turkey?"

767
00:46:00,954 --> 00:46:04,743
As long as the turkey is around our house, we, we can't leave.

768
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:07,593
In fact, we have to be back by midnight.

769
00:46:08,462 --> 00:46:10,443
My nana put this curse on my dad.

770
00:46:10,443 --> 00:46:11,973
They didn't get along.

771
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:15,101
But, my dad believes in magic.

772
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:16,422
Real magic.

773
00:46:16,456 --> 00:46:19,167
And I thought you could convince him that you have powers,

774
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:21,948
then he'd believe that you can lift the curse.

775
00:46:22,017 --> 00:46:23,338
You're serious?

776
00:46:23,372 --> 00:46:25,389
I was thinking a magic show.

777
00:46:25,423 --> 00:46:27,822
Something small, just to get him interested,

778
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:30,984
and then tell him that you'll lift the curse.

779
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:34,842
Look, Fred, I, I, I'm sorry about this family curse and all,

780
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:36,755
but, I've really gotta be getting back.

781
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:41,168
I, I, I've got Japanese executives coming over to discuss a possible merger.

782
00:46:41,203 --> 00:46:42,698
I am announcing my engagement.

783
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:45,235
I am giving my father-in-law a cappuccino machine.

784
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,459
You can't exactly leave.

785
00:46:47,494 --> 00:46:49,893
What do you mean, "Can't exactly leave"?

786
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:54,411
The curse is on anyone who stays in the house past midnight.

787
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:58,477
I can't even believe I am having this conversation.

788
00:46:58,512 --> 00:47:00,250
Well, why do you think Susan can't leave?

789
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:05,185
She stayed over one night with Dennis, that was six months ago.

790
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:07,445
Now come on, it's worth a try.

791
00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:10,121
For Celia's sake.

792
00:47:10,156 --> 00:47:11,754
And what's she got to do with it?

793
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,041
She likes you.

794
00:47:13,075 --> 00:47:14,292
She does?

795
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:17,281
What am I saying?

796
00:47:17,316 --> 00:47:19,540
This is ridiculous. I don't even believe in curses.

797
00:47:19,574 --> 00:47:21,938
You're still here, aren't you?

798
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,446
When's dinner, Mom. I'm starved.

799
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,025
As soon as Uncle Henrick and Aunt Bonnie arrive.

800
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:35,772
(MUMBLES)

801
00:47:35,806 --> 00:47:37,892
He's not a Nazi.

802
00:47:37,962 --> 00:47:41,611
I, er, think I'm gonna try to use that phone again.

803
00:47:41,646 --> 00:47:44,287
Oh, lines are still down. That happens when it...

804
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:46,929
Storms. I know. I know.

805
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:54,124
Celia, I think it's time for the tree.

806
00:47:54,158 --> 00:47:56,522
Fred, why don't you help your sister?

807
00:47:57,703 --> 00:47:59,476
Maybe Richard can help me.

808
00:48:05,906 --> 00:48:07,226
Uh, okay.

809
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:12,405
You let me know the minute that your

810
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:13,657
BOTH: uncle arrives.

811
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:16,855
Oh, maybe you'd better give him Dennis hat and coat.

812
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:20,017
RICHARD: Does everyone in the family believe in this curse?

813
00:48:20,052 --> 00:48:22,311
We believe in the curse because my dad believes.

814
00:48:23,841 --> 00:48:25,265
I love this sound.

815
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:30,236
It's like rain on a tin roof. It's soothing.

816
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,487
It soothes.

817
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:33,294
Love it.

818
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,839
You live in the city, right?

819
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,335
-Yeah. -Yes.

820
00:48:40,941 --> 00:48:42,297
I love cities.

821
00:48:44,695 --> 00:48:46,259
Lots of buildings.

822
00:48:47,683 --> 00:48:49,213
Lots of people.

823
00:48:51,264 --> 00:48:53,384
And lots of hair.

824
00:48:53,418 --> 00:48:57,172
Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to the world's greatest hair stylist.

825
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:58,389
-Really? -Yes.

826
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:01,726
I wanted to be the world's greatest magician once.

827
00:49:01,726 --> 00:49:03,394
Well, you still can be.

828
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:04,402
I don't think so.

829
00:49:05,758 --> 00:49:08,016
How'd you and Sara meet?

830
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:12,014
Was it full of romance and mystery and...

831
00:49:13,265 --> 00:49:14,725
No.

832
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:18,756
Uh, actually we met through George, er, Mr. Billings.

833
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:21,154
Her father, he's my boss.

834
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,267
Oh. Okay.

835
00:49:25,951 --> 00:49:28,210
Does your family like her?

836
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:33,111
I, er, my parents were divorced when I was little.

837
00:49:33,111 --> 00:49:34,849
Haven't seen my father in a long time.

838
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:35,961
I don't know where he is.

839
00:49:35,996 --> 00:49:37,352
Really?

840
00:49:37,386 --> 00:49:39,680
Mother died ten years ago.

841
00:49:40,966 --> 00:49:42,913
This was supposed to be the first Christmas

842
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:46,284
I was gonna spend with the family in a long time.

843
00:49:47,258 --> 00:49:49,760
I'm sorry you're in this mess with us.

844
00:49:49,795 --> 00:49:52,158
Oh, no. Actually, I, I, I don't mind.

845
00:49:52,193 --> 00:49:55,738
I, I always wanted to cut down the old Christmas tree.

846
00:49:55,808 --> 00:49:57,268
Really?

847
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:58,832
Then you know what, Richard?

848
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:00,882
Here's your chance.

849
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:19,963
Do you always decorate the tree before you chop it down?

850
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:23,057
Well, you wouldn't buy a pair of shoes without trying them on, would you?

851
00:50:23,127 --> 00:50:25,559
(CHUCKLING)

852
00:50:25,629 --> 00:50:27,158
I'll let you do the honours.

853
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:29,556
On one condition.

854
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:31,086
Name it.

855
00:50:31,503 --> 00:50:33,033
Teach me magic.

856
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:35,431
Well, you can't really learn magic quickly.

857
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:38,002
Oh, please, I have to try.

858
00:50:38,767 --> 00:50:40,505
Just something simple.

859
00:50:41,096 --> 00:50:42,451
For my father.

860
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:48,638
Okay, I'll show you one. But, just one, though.

861
00:50:48,638 --> 00:50:52,044
Yes, yes!

862
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:18,355
Like it?

863
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,468
This is great.

864
00:51:19,502 --> 00:51:20,614
Isn't it?

865
00:51:20,649 --> 00:51:22,283
I fixed it up myself.

866
00:51:29,582 --> 00:51:32,397
Does Paris have some special meaning?

867
00:51:32,432 --> 00:51:34,587
It has the world's greatest hair stylists.

868
00:51:37,089 --> 00:51:38,896
Even have my ticket.

869
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:40,739
Ready to fly, I guess.

870
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:42,546
Soon as the curse is lifted,

871
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:45,292
I'll be on my way.

872
00:52:03,227 --> 00:52:04,374
Boy.

873
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:06,876
I really look stupid, don't I?

874
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:08,649
Depends on how you look at it.

875
00:52:10,977 --> 00:52:12,716
Would you like me to work on it?

876
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,627
I, I don't think we have the time.

877
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:16,052
Well, I'm fast.

878
00:52:16,087 --> 00:52:17,616
And I'll throw in a shave.

879
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:21,856
(BAND MUSIC PLAYING)

880
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:24,245
(MUSIC ENDS)

881
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:29,459
How was that?

882
00:53:29,493 --> 00:53:33,213
That was great.

883
00:53:35,263 --> 00:53:36,792
It was good for me, too.

884
00:53:38,669 --> 00:53:39,712
Okay.

885
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:41,971
My turn.

886
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:44,683
Show me the magic.

887
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:47,462
This is all you need.

888
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:52,537
(SOFTLY) Watch closely.

889
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:05,884
You're gonna teach me that?

890
00:54:06,753 --> 00:54:08,212
It's easier than it looks.

891
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:10,750
It's the simplest things that fool us most, isn't it?

892
00:54:10,785 --> 00:54:14,817
I used to spend hours in front of the mirror practising.

893
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,554
Then we have something in common.

894
00:54:17,145 --> 00:54:19,439
Yeah. I guess we do.

895
00:54:29,588 --> 00:54:32,369
You do it over and over again in front of the mirror

896
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:34,315
until you can't detect the magic.

897
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,531
The mirror never lies.

898
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:36,991
Oh, there's one more thing.

899
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:38,242
Before I show you how it's done,

900
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:39,876
I need you to take the magician's oath.

901
00:54:39,911 --> 00:54:42,274
Oh, I know. Never reveal the secret.

902
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:44,256
-Never tell anyone. -Right.

903
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,577
But, you're telling me.

904
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,558
Don't tell anyone.

905
00:54:47,627 --> 00:54:48,669
Okay.

906
00:54:51,763 --> 00:54:52,806

01:30:27,858 --> 01:30:29,109
UNCLE HENRICK: Goodbye.

1448
01:30:30,603 --> 01:30:31,716
Take care.

1449
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:36,721
RICHARD AND GUS: # Four calling cards Three French hens

1450
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:38,355
# Two turtle gloves

1451
01:30:38,389 --> 01:30:44,228
# And a cartilage in my left knee #

1452
01:30:44,263 --> 01:30:48,503
Oh, oh, boy. Am I glad you guys came along.

1453
01:30:49,754 --> 01:30:51,249
I'm stuck.

1454
01:30:51,249 --> 01:30:52,291
I need a lift.

1455
01:30:53,751 --> 01:30:59,834
Gee, I think I saw a call box about ten miles down the road.

1456
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:04,144
Look, Richie, I liked your damn tricks, okay?

1457
01:31:04,178 --> 01:31:06,055
Dogs do tricks, Billy.

1458
01:31:06,959 --> 01:31:08,766
I do magic.

1459
01:31:19,263 --> 01:31:21,870
RICHARD AND GUS: (CONTINUE SINGING)

1460
01:31:26,562 --> 01:31:31,706
# ...Gathering winter fuel #

1461
01:31:36,433 --> 01:31:38,658
-Thanks, Gus. -Merry Christmas.

1462
01:31:38,727 --> 01:31:40,013
Same to you.

1463
01:31:42,064 --> 01:31:43,801
What are you doing back?

1464
01:31:43,837 --> 01:31:45,296
Where's Celia?

1465
01:31:46,026 --> 01:31:47,486
Ah.

1466
01:31:47,486 --> 01:31:50,440
She went into town to catch the last bus to the city.

1467
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:52,317
She's on her way to Paris, Richard.

1468
01:31:52,317 --> 01:31:53,568
What?

1469
01:31:55,862 --> 01:31:57,252
I have to stop her.

1470
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,563
I have an idea.

1471
01:32:03,995 --> 01:32:05,734
(MUMBLES)

1472
01:32:36,979 --> 01:32:39,656
-Bye, Mikey. -Goodbye, Celia.

1473
01:33:39,299 --> 01:33:43,887
Celia!

1474
01:33:44,687 --> 01:33:45,938
Stop the bus.

1475
01:33:57,268 --> 01:33:58,763

1476
01:34:01,787 --> 01:34:03,316
