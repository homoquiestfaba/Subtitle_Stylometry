1
00:00:00,268 --> 00:00:03,601
(cheerful upbeat music)

2
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:20,393
- I guess they came in through the screen

3
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:23,663
and somehow the alarm didn't work and

4
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:26,933
um, I don't know, they
told me, but I don't know.

5
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:29,075
- There we go.

6
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:33,313
(door squeaks)

7
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:36,803
- Somebody very strong next
to her was leading her.

8
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:40,873
Something tells me that
Allie was not the ringleader

9
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:42,403
of something like that.

10
00:00:42,403 --> 00:00:43,763
I just, I just don't,

11
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:45,476
I think that someone must
have put her up to it.

12
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:47,693
I don't think she thinks that way.

13
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:48,526
Although--

14
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:51,836
- To be honest with you, I wasn't shocked.

15
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,873
- No, I wasn't shocked either, I mean--

16
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:57,313
- Michelle was an accident
waiting to happen.

17
00:00:57,313 --> 00:01:02,313
She's just so full of anger and angst.

18
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,463
- I found out about these events.

19
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:14,053
I was vacationing in Acapulco
at Las Brisas with my friend

20
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:19,053
and um, I got this hysterical call

21
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:21,630
and I answered the phone and uh,

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,763
and they told me that my son, my sweet boy

23
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:28,973
had been accosted and tied
up and hit on the head

24
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:31,723
and I was hysterical,
I truly was hysterical.

25
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:33,713
I mean, I came back immediately.

26
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:37,262
I even took economy to get back here.

27
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:40,595
(upbeat cheerful music)

28
00:02:01,783 --> 00:02:03,763
- [Michelle] What doesn't
kill you makes you stronger.

29
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:05,423
That is so true.

30
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:07,133
It's always those lowest moments,

31
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,930
those worst experiences that
you look back and you say,

32
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,100
"Yeah, if that hadn't happened,
where would I be now?"

33
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,803
(cheerful upbeat music)

34
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,653
- [Detective] Diamond
necklace, gold watch,

35
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:30,653
um, a hairdryer, a cosmetics,
I think, Revlon nail polish,

36
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:34,473
um, some perfume--

37
00:02:34,473 --> 00:02:36,743
- [Michelle] My name is
Michelle Halliburton,

38
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:39,023
ex Malibu housewife, cat burglar,

39
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:40,953
kidnapper and about to be felon,

40
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,883
convicted of robbery.

41
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:45,223
Also, kidnapping, false imprisonment,

42
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:48,933
nine counts of burglary,
possession of stolen property.

43
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:52,413
- Gold bracelet, emerald
ring and bracelet and um--

44
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:55,163
- [Michelle] This is
Detective Frank Richards

45
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:58,183
and that is Detective Simon Burke.

46
00:02:58,183 --> 00:02:59,296
Kinda cute, isn't he?

47
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,856
Don't worry, I've had it with men.

48
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,196
- [Burke] Diamond brooch, cosmetics, um--

49
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,293
- Diamond bracelet.

50
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:10,533
- [Burke] Diamond
bracelet, diamond bracelet.

51
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,786
- All right, Michelle,

52
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:15,643
according to this financial statement,

53
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:18,913
got your Jag, husband's got a Mercedes,

54
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:20,756
you've got a home here in Malibu.

55
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:23,343
What, you have all this money,

56
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,563
why are you causing these burglaries?

57
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:26,396
Why are you?

58
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:29,846
- Revenge.

59
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:31,773
- [Richards] You've been saying that,

60
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:34,113
revenge, revenge, revenge from what?

61
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,233
- It's actually very
metaphorical and symbolic

62
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,210
of who she is about her
abandonment issues and,

63
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,873
and her, um, almost like

64
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:47,053
the kidnapping and the torturing
was like a part of herself.

65
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:49,153
Do you follow what I'm saying?

66
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:50,243
Don't you agree with that?

67
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:52,543
- Well it's a very important
point that it's symbolic.

68
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:55,863
It's symbolic, I think of,
because I know her pretty well.

69
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,553
I was married to her for four years

70
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:59,586
and I know her intimately and uh,

71
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:01,873
I think it's symbolic of

72
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:05,593
a very early narcissistic
injury that she had

73
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:08,023
probably in the first, oh--

74
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:10,113
- They say these things
happen in the first,

75
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:11,693
anywhere, like first six months of--

76
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:14,113
- Yeah, the first months of her life.

77
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:16,733
Probably what happened, I mean, uh,

78
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,994
I never met her mother, but
she talked about her mother--

79
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:19,827
- Oh, I heard terrible, terrible stories--

80
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:22,003
- Yeah, and I think
that her mother was also

81
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:23,353
very narcissistic and I think

82
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,713
probably abandoned her at some point.

83
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:26,983
- [Detective] All right Allie,
we went over with Michelle

84
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:30,350
the string of robberies that
you two were involved with.

85
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,973
Now Detective Burke here
is gonna run them by you.

86
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,363
See if this makes sense to you.

87
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:35,983
Go ahead, first one there.

88
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,936
- Okay Allie, uh, Carol Schweiker,

89
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,813
um, you two broke into her house,

90
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,293
took cosmetics and jewelry.

91
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:45,266
Anna Stewart, same.

92
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:49,120
Nicole Weizmann, uh her gold bracelet,

93
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,993
her emerald ring and some
things from her bathroom.

94
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:56,993
Rose Paledgy, Grace Lumpock
and finally, Camille Alexander.

95
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:05,266
- You realize what happened,
what was done here, right?

96
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,736
Why did you steal?

97
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:14,293
- Allie, do you know why you're here?

98
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,226
Do know that you're in a lot of trouble?

99
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,646
- I'm slow, I'm not stupid.

100
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:24,258
- [Burke] I know, Allie.

101
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,537
- [Christine] Allie.

102
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:27,255
- This is so beautiful, honey.

103
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:28,845
- Can I have you for a minute, honey?

104
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:31,097
(woman chatting quietly)

105
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,439
- Honey, I need you to
get Karen a smock, okay?

106
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,399
- [Allie] Okay.

107
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,453
- No no no, Allie, Allie, that's okay,

108
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:38,503
let go for a minute sweetheart.

109
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:39,993
Take this, okay?

110
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:41,003
To the back room and then

111
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:43,803
when you come back from the
back room, bring a smock.

112
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:44,636
Thank you.

113
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,469
Poppy.

114
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:46,913
- [Michelle] This is
my best and only friend

115
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,583
and partner in crime, Allie.

116
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,503
Allie works at Brown's
Salon which is owned

117
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:53,456
and operated by Christine Brown.

118
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,432
(whispering quietly)

119
00:05:58,432 --> 00:05:59,265
- (whispering) You know that.

120
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:02,593
You have to be a very
gentle, like you are, okay?

121
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:04,833
Just be like you are,
very gentle, very easy.

122
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,693
- Okay Christine.
- Thank you.

123
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:10,573
- Uh, many of my patrons
are very wealthy people

124
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,283
so they're involved
with a lot of charities

125
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:14,853
and I went with one of
my friends one weekend

126
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:15,843
to this community center

127
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:19,313
where they had developmentally
impaired people present

128
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,913
and that's where I met Allie.

129
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,443
And it was, you know, like when you meet,

130
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:24,803
it's like that man, woman
thing, that connection

131
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:27,863
or that woman, woman thing
and I just adored her

132
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:29,463
and it was an immediate lock-in.

133
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:34,193
And she wanted to work
and she was so eager

134
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,963
and so I said, "Well come to the salon."

135
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,046
And she did and she was great.

136
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,863
- Do you like it?

137
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:40,696
- [Woman] No.

138
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:41,593
(laughing)

139
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:42,883
- She used to fold the towels

140
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:45,083
and she used to wipe the lady's hair

141
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,493
and uh, she said she
had always had a dream

142
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:49,773
about being a manicurist
and I wanted to help her

143
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:50,773
make those dreams come true.

144
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:53,023
So, that's how it started and I must say,

145
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:56,416
it progressed really
very well for a while.

146
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,575
- 45.

147
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:02,412
- No you're not, like maybe you're 20.

148
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:03,245
You look beautiful.

149
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:04,577
- Actually have it chopped to the ears.

150
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:06,336
- No I don't think so, I don't
think that's gonna help you.

151
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:07,816
- It's a sign of maturity.

152
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,153
- No.

153
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:10,953
- Oh thank you, you are the,

154
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:13,406
you are terrific, it's there, thank you.

155
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:15,133
- [Man] Leave it, trust me.

156
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,003
- [Michelle] Everyone
goes to Brown's salon.

157
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,183
Everyone with too much money

158
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:20,233
and nothing better to do that is.

159
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,593
They sit around and gossip and hang out

160
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:24,413
and they talk about which vacation spot

161
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,143
they'll be going to that month.

162
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:28,303
All Allie has to do is listen.

163
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:30,493
- Well yeah, but just not the full head

164
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,283
because I have to get to the airport.

165
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:33,959
- That's, where are you going?

166
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,183
- [Woman] I'm going up to
the new house in Park City.

167
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:37,873
- [Stylist] Ah, fabulous,
isn't that great.

168
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:40,223
- Yeah, it's great, it's like the country.

169
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:41,573
It's two hours, door to door.

170
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:42,406
- Is that all?

171
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:48,033
- I was not aware that
Allie was using Christine.

172
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,243
I was not aware of any of this.

173
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:53,473
I just thought she was such
a simple minded creature,

174
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,356
I didn't think she was
capable of anything like this.

175
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,513
- [Michelle] So, Allie gets the addresses

176
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,393
and Christine, being the smart
business woman that she is,

177
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:06,143
always includes everyone's birthday.

178
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,143
Then she calls, gives them to me

179
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,583
so she won't make a mistake or forget

180
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,153
and the rest is easy.

181
00:08:12,153 --> 00:08:13,303
- Hello, this is Allie.

182
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,096
The appointment for 5:30.

183
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:24,453
The address is 225 and an eighth.

184
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:25,286
- [Michelle] An eighth?

185
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:27,926
There's no eighth in any
mansion I've ever seen, Allie.

186
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:28,876
Read it again.

187
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,183
- [Allie] 225 and a half.

188
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:32,033
- Great.

189
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,143
Okay, Allie, I'm gonna be there
to pick you up in a minute,

190
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:37,443
but just--
(Allie talking quietly)

191
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:38,983
Don't hang up, Allie.

192
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:40,823
Allie, don't hang up.

193
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:43,573
(phone clatters)

194
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:48,983
- (laughing) Did you see
the look on his face?

195
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:56,859
I can't, I cannot, no. (laughing)

196
00:08:57,673 --> 00:08:59,783
Oh you always do that to me.

197
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,103
Would you hold on just a minute.

198
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,193
Can I help you, sir?
- Yeah.

199
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:05,163
- [Christine] Oh my goodness,
is this is a real one?

200
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:06,193
- Uh, yes ma'am.

201
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:07,693
- [Christine] Are you real?

202
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:08,526
- Yes ma'am.

203
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:10,503
- This is, I've gotta,
I've gotta policeman here.

204
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,273
I can't.

205
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:13,593
Yeah, no I can't.

206
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:14,853
Goodbye.

207
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:15,833
Hello, I'm sorry.

208
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,025
- I'm Lieutenant
Richards, Detective Burke.

209
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:19,858
- [Christine] Hello.

210
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:20,691
- Hi.
- Detective Burke,

211
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,283
how are you?
- And your name is?

212
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:24,163
- Christine--
- Christine.

213
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,173
Yeah, there's been some uh,
robberies in your neighborhood

214
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:31,676
and some of the patrons that come in here

215
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,033
are some of the people
who have been victimized

216
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,743
by these robberies.

217
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:36,120
- Right.
- So we wanna come in here,

218
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,943
we wanna do a little
question, standard procedures,

219
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:40,924
maybe talk to some of your personnel,

220
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:42,452
get some background--
- Sh sh sh,

221
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:43,573
could you just hold your voice down.

222
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:46,303
People spend a lot of money here.

223
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:48,333
They come here once, maybe twice,

224
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,143
maybe three times a week to get rest,

225
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:51,973
relaxation away from home.

226
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:53,183
I have to provide them that.

227
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:55,423
I can't allow anybody to come
in and ask them questions.

228
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:57,913
You can ask me all the questions you want.

229
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,353
- Well we either question 'em here

230
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:01,093
or we take 'em down to the police station.

231
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:02,143
You want me to do that?

232
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,123
- Gentlemen, this is my business.

233
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:07,413
I started this before it
was a hole in the wall.

234
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:09,963
You just can't come in
here with a badge and--

235
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:10,796
- [Burke] You wanna see,

236
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:12,493
you wanna see 'em down at the station?

237
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:14,109
- I'm gonna, I'm gonna--
- You own this place?

238
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:15,516
- [Christine] I'm not
gonna do this anymore now.

239
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,730
I want you outta here.
- Well what are you gonna do--

240
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,396
- [Christine] I want you out.
- We're investigating--

241
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:20,405
- [Christine] I want you outta here.

242
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:23,923
(arguing over each other)

243
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:24,756
- We're fine, we're fine.

244
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:27,178
- [Christine] Listen, listen
to the ruckus you're making.

245
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,543
- And that's the last thing we wanna do.

246
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,038
- We coulda just walked in here

247
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:30,871
and it would have been quietly
and gotten out of here.

248
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,036
- Would it be possible for us to speak

249
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:34,223
to a few of your people,
separate from everyone else?

250
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:35,345
We won't cause a stink--

251
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:37,063
- You mean the staff?
- Yes, please.

252
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:38,370
- A,

253
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,625
L,
- L.

254
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,763
- L,
- L.

255
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:42,350
- I,
- I.

256
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,983
- E.
- E, Allie.

257
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:46,653
And Allie, what's your last name please?

258
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,123
- D,

259
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:49,003
- [Burke] D.

260
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:49,836
- A,
- A.

261
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:51,605
- [Allie] D,

262
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:52,812
- D.

263
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:54,410
- [Allie] A,

264
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,522
- A.

265
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,522
- [Allie] D,

266
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,780
- D.

267
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,690
- [Allie] A.

268
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,717
- A.

269
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:01,694
- [Allie] D.

270
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,527
- D.

271
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:04,356
Dadadad.

272
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:07,061
- Dadadad.

273
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:09,955
Allie Dadadad.

274
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:10,788
- Dadadad.

275
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:11,621
- [Allie] Greek.

276
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:13,677
- Yes, may I call you Allie?

277
00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:14,973
- Yes.
- Okay.

278
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,423
Uh, have you heard anything
about any break-ins

279
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,956
in this part of town around the salon?

280
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:22,376
- No.

281
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:25,753
- [Burke] No, so none of
your customers or coworkers,

282
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,586
anyone has said anything about them?

283
00:11:29,753 --> 00:11:31,050
- That would be no.

284
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,883
- No?
- No.

285
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,646
- Can you absolutely say
that no one like that--

286
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:35,523
- Absolutely no.

287
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:36,503
May I?

288
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:37,336
- [Burke] Please.

289
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:38,169
- My boss loves something

290
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,113
and I'd just like to show it to you.

291
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:41,753
It's a way to release tension.

292
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:43,690
It's something I practiced in school.

293
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,403
You see how I'm turning your wrist?

294
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:46,236
- [Burke] Yes, I do.

295
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:49,013
- And a roll and if you
get into a roll like this,

296
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:51,008
plus, let me show you this.

297
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:52,366
Taking out the tension,
take out the tension.

298
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:55,300
Is that hurting you?

299
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,133
- Yeah well just a little bit--

300
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,213
- I'm sorry, it shouldn't hurt you.

301
00:11:58,213 --> 00:12:00,713
(jazzy music)

302
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:26,406
(engine humming)
(jazzy music)

303
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,663
But the other thing is,
can you relax your head?

304
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:33,496
You're a little tense.

305
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:35,063
Maybe your job and the questions,

306
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:36,203
just relax it, let it go.

307
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:38,463
- Yeah, I really do need
to ask you a few questions,

308
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:39,533
if you don't mind, I mean--

309
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:40,637
- Simon you're not relaxing.

310
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:42,800
Questions will get answers
better if you relax.

311
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,743
- Hey, what the hell's going on here?

312
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,063
Simon, what the hell are you doing?

313
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:48,153
- [Burke] Just actually
asking some questions.

314
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:49,323
- What do you think this is, a game,

315
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:50,573
party's here for Christ sakes?

316
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:52,343
Come on, get outside and
do some work out there

317
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:53,735
for Christ sakes.

318
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:54,996
You're starting to lose
it, Simon, you know that?

319
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:56,273
Just get outside, will you?

320
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:57,863
You're getting on my
nerves for Christ sakes.

321
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:58,696
- Excuse me, sir?

322
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,343
I don't--
- You're getting soft!

323
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:01,273
- I don't think you should yell at him--

324
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:02,821
- Get over there.

325
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:04,363
We got an investigation going on here now.

326
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,333
Just sit down there,
will you please, Allie?

327
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,603
Whatever the heck your name is?

328
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:09,340
- [Allie] Don't be so grumpy.

329
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,823
- You know, I'm not, you know what?

330
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,410
Talking to you is like
talking into a tunnel.

331
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,523
Now I'm starting to hear my own echo.

332
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:16,283
- I wish you would just
have a better attitude.

333
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:17,313
You got love troubles?

334
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:19,183
- I'm trying to, I don't
have love troubles.

335
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:20,443
I'm just trying to get the answers

336
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:22,223
to a couple of questions here, now if we--

337
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:24,293
- Why don't you let me give
you a little finger massage.

338
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:25,143
You're too tense.

339
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:32,613
(Burke sighs)

340
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,316
- [Michelle] You look a little upset.

341
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:36,556
- What?

342
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:38,772
I'm sorry.

343
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:41,546
- [Michelle] You look a little upset.

344
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:44,603
- [Burke] Long day.

345
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:48,145
- It's a beautiful day, though.

346
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:52,833
- Yeah, just kind of
killing time, are you?

347
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,176
- Well I'm picking someone up.

348
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:56,009
- Oh.

349
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,593
I'm a cop and you're in a no parking zone.

350
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:08,590
- Oh, I'm--

351
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,743
- Simon Burke.

352
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:12,576
- [Michelle] Nice to meet you,

353
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,743
I'm just waiting for my
girlfriend here and uh--

354
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:17,976
- Oh no no no no no,
please, take your time.

355
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:20,413
- [Michelle] You sure about that?

356
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:21,433
- Positive, positive.

357
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:23,603
- [Michelle] Okay, well she
should be out any minute now.

358
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:25,103
Um, Allie!

359
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:26,863
(honks horn)
- Allie is your friend?

360
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:28,887
- [Michelle] Uh, yeah.

361
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:29,873
- Oh.

362
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:31,032
- [Michelle] You know Allie?

363
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:33,084
- [Allie] Wow. (laughs)

364
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:34,656
Oh hi.
- We're gonna be late, Allie.

365
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,835
- I saw you before.
- Let's go, Allie.

366
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,043
- He's gonna come and have
spaghetti at our house.

367
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,126
- Oh great.

368
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,045
Come on--
- Don't forget,

369
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,922
spaghetti at our house on Tuesday.

370
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,755
- I don't, I don't,
- Bye.

371
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:43,974
- [Burke] What was your name?

372
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,243
- Spaghetti at our house,
Michelle and Allie.

373
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:46,090
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye Allie.

374
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,360
- [Allie] You ought to consider Simon.

375
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,383
- [Michelle] Forget Simon.

376
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:49,703
- [Allie] Why should I forget Simon?

377
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,476
- [Michelle] I will not
be going out with a cop.

378
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:52,406
I don't care about that.

379
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:53,693
- [Allie] Well I don't believe that.

380
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,633
- Are you ready?

381
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:55,466
- [Allie] Yes.

382
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:58,860
- If the door's open, we
have 30 seconds, okay?

383
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,893
- [Allie] All right, I'll start counting,

384
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:00,966
I'll start counting.
- Start counting.

385
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,545
Yes, go!

386
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:10,545
(alarm beeping)
(energetic music)

387
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:20,483
- I knew that most rich people

388
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:21,803
don't lock their sliding doors

389
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:24,513
because either they forget
or their kids need to get in

390
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:26,003
or they don't trust their servants not to

391
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,763
go and make copies of the keys.

392
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:30,363
They figure they have an
alarm, so what's the point?

393
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,683
They're also usually busy and preoccupied

394
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,986
and they just use their
birthdays for the code.

395
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:39,339
This is nice.

396
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:42,882
Here we go.

397
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:46,893
Allie, what are you doing in there?

398
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:47,726
- Nothing.

399
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:49,976
- [Michelle] Hurry up.

400
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:52,011
- Okay.

401
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:55,613
(cheerful music)

402
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:01,263
- They didn't take the TV.

403
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:05,083
They didn't take big items.

404
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,363
They didn't take the stocks,
anything like that or art

405
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:11,193
and I had just come back from Paris

406
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:13,293
and they took all the cosmetics,

407
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:15,403
all my cosmetics that I had just bought

408
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:18,646
and hair, old curling
irons, you know from,

409
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,573
it was very odd.

410
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:24,793
- Well they had some
things to say about you,

411
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:27,270
Dustin and Miss Nanski, um--

412
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,443
- [Michelle] I'm sure they have.

413
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:31,856
- Kleptomaniac, needed
therapy, but refused it.

414
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:36,646
- Well, I'm not a kleptomaniac.

415
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:40,533
- [Burke] But uh, unstable and--

416
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,896
- Well I don't find myself to be unstable.

417
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,686
- But why would they say
these things about you?

418
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,603
- Well I thought it was
a good relationship,

419
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,143
but obviously it wasn't.

420
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:56,826
Think I was a little naive.

421
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:01,133
(sighs)

422
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,543
I married Dustin Halliburton,
who I thought loved me.

423
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:07,283
I devoted myself to his every whim.

424
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:09,463
When he said I looked
fat, I went on a diet.

425
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:10,963
When he said I was uptight in bed,

426
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,433
I took sexual freedom classes.

427
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,513
In the end, nothing I could
do would ever please him.

428
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:19,616
(door slams)

429
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:22,116
(door creaks)

430
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:24,961
Dustin?

431
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,249
Dustin?

432
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:36,129
Dustin.

433
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:51,638
(moaning)
(sexy music)

434
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:53,436
- Oh hi honey.

435
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,723
Um, boy you're home awful early.

436
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,337
- Oh yeah.

437
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:01,170
- Weren't you supposed to be having lunch

438
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,883
with what's her name, the--

439
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,343
- I was stood up, yeah.

440
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:09,803
- Oh uh, Mr. Tanaka called
from the nursery and uh,

441
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:10,743
he wanted to know if it would be all right

442
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:13,036
to deliver the Ficus tomorrow.

443
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,453
- Oh.

444
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:21,776
- Angela um,

445
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:24,731
she came over um--

446
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:29,003
- (crying) I've had a really shitty day.

447
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:30,533
- She's had a really, really bad day.

448
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:34,344
Um, because uh, she um--

449
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,177
- I um,

450
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:37,983
I ran over Lily.

451
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,823
- Lily, her dog, she ran over her dog.

452
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:42,333
Just flat as a pancake and uh,

453
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,343
well he's dead.

454
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,896
- [Michelle] He's dead?

455
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:46,729
- Yeah.
- He's dead. (crying)

456
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:47,562
- [Michelle] Oh no.

457
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:49,343
- You know how close
she was to Willy and uh,

458
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:53,960
well, we were just uh, we
were talking and um, and uh--

459
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,583
- Uh, Angela Nanski and um,

460
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,786
Michelle is a very close friend of mine.

461
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:07,313
- Uh, Dustin Halliburton
and Michelle is my wife.

462
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,843
We're actually, we're in the
middle of a divorce right now,

463
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:12,743
but um, technically, we're still married.

464
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:15,941
We were married for uh, four years.

465
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:16,863
- Mm mm.

466
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,696
- We were married for four years,

467
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:18,875
but I knew her for a
couple years before that.

468
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,963
- Okay, yeah that's right.

469
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:21,173
- You introduced us, didn't you?

470
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,315
- Yes, I did.

471
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:23,723
- What year was that?

472
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:25,556
- Oh boy, what uh,

473
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:28,166
'88.

474
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,443
- Like seven years ago?
- Seven,

475
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:32,593
seven and a half years.
- Time flies, woo.

476
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,359
(feet clomping)
(chaotic chattering)

477
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,876
- Michelle, he made me do it, Michelle.

478
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:40,021
- [Dustin] What do you
mean I made you do it?

479
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,881
- I have no idea.
- What are you talking about?

480
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,547
I didn't make you do anything. Michelle!

481
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:44,393
She's overreacting.

482
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:48,696
Michelle.

483
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:52,873
Hey hey hey hey, come
on, sweetheart, listen.

484
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:54,323
Listen to me, that was nothing, really.

485
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:56,703
I don't want you to overreact
to this, I'm serious.

486
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:57,847
- [Michelle] Oh you're serious.

487
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:02,550
(chaotic chattering)
(engine hums)

488
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,626
- Angie, shut up!

489
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,916
- [Angela] Why are you yelling at me?

490
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,524
Why are you yelling at me?

491
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:10,755
- Angie, listen, she's my wife, all right?

492
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,908
I don't want her to get the
wrong impression about this.

493
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:15,575
(Angela crying)

494
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:20,643
- [Michelle] Well I
didn't know that things

495
00:20:20,643 --> 00:20:23,163
were about to go from bad to worse.

496
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:24,743
I called my so called friends.

497
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:26,693
They all knew about Angela and Dustin

498
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,773
and not one of them
was willing to help me.

499
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:30,823
It was like it was my fault.

500
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:33,303
Dustin had been unhappy for a long time.

501
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:35,003
Angela had been crying every night

502
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:37,566
for months about it, months.

503
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:39,933
That bitch, I was so humiliated.

504
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,213
My whole life was
unraveling in front of me.

505
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:45,856
I panicked, I fumed, I screamed,
but nothing seemed to help.

506
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,281
- She wouldn't go to
therapy, she just wouldn't--

507
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,473
- Wouldn't, wouldn't even touch it.

508
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:52,563
- Yeah--
- I mean, we'd bring it up,

509
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,173
it was like, you know--
- We'd both been in therapy--

510
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:55,916
- Out the door--
- How many years?

511
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,933
- (sighs) Let me see, uh, 15?

512
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:02,173
- 15 years, 15 years.

513
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,553
Oh, she has many more than I do,

514
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,313
but still, it's a really
important thing to do--

515
00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:06,326
- Wait a minute.

516
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:07,996
I'm sorry.

517
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:10,733
- What?

518
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:12,043
- Many more? (laughs)

519
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:13,133
- Well--
- 15, what do you--

520
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:15,242
- Well that's a long
time to be in therapy.

521
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:16,833
(unamused laughing)

522
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,483
(playful music)
(muttering)

523
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:21,893
- [Michelle] As I drove, I thought about

524
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:24,703
what a farce my life has been so far.

525
00:21:24,703 --> 00:21:27,653
I was so upset I forgot
that I was already on empty

526
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,053
and my warning light wasn't working

527
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:30,476
on the fuel gauge, as usual.

528
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:37,749
(dog barking)
(playful music)

529
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:42,603
In a way, breaking down that night

530
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,463
was the best thing that
ever happened to me

531
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:45,713
because if I hadn't broken down,

532
00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:47,683
I would have never met Allie.

533
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:51,163
She was so sweet and caring
and just wanted to help me,

534
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:52,403
but at the same time,

535
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:54,633
she knew who she was and what she wanted.

536
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:57,163
She was entitled in a way
that for everything I had,

537
00:21:57,163 --> 00:21:58,623
I never was.

538
00:21:58,623 --> 00:22:01,583
That's something that never
ceases to amaze me about her.

539
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,556
- Excuse me, are you okay?

540
00:22:04,513 --> 00:22:06,073
- Yeah. (crying)

541
00:22:06,073 --> 00:22:09,696
Yes, I think, no, can I borrow $5.00?

542
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:12,382
- Lady?

543
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:13,779
- What?

544
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:14,713
Okay--
- come on up.

545
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:18,272
- [Michelle] Oh thank
you, thank you. (crying)

546
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:19,573
I ran out of gas.

547
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:21,253
- [Allie] You know, you've got to breath,

548
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:23,256
try to breath.
- Okay.

549
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:25,115
(labored breathing)

550
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:26,206
Okay, thank you.

551
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:28,873
- You know, you broke your nail.

552
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:29,706
- [Michelle] I did?

553
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:30,539
- Yeah.

554
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,603
Wait a second, let me open up, okay?

555
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:35,663
Breath, keep breathing.

556
00:22:35,663 --> 00:22:36,793
You ran out of gas?

557
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:38,959
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.

558
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:40,032
- Okay.
- Come on in.

559
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:41,949
- [Michelle] Thank you.

560
00:22:42,823 --> 00:22:44,453
- I can't give you $5.00.

561
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:45,643
- [Michelle] What?

562
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:46,893
- I can't give you $5.00.

563
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:50,573
I'm on a tight budget money management.

564
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:53,996
- But I'm, I'll give it right back to you.

565
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:57,449
- I can't give it to you.

566
00:22:57,449 --> 00:22:58,530
- What do you mean you
can't give it to me?

567
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,046
- Can I make a suggestion?

568
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:02,872
- What?
- Breath.

569
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:05,645
(breathing)

570
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,312
- I just need $5.00!

571
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:10,253
That's all I need is $5.00,
you don't have $5.00?

572
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:12,443
- I'll tell you what--
- What?

573
00:23:12,443 --> 00:23:13,873
- I'll walk you to the gas station--

574
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:14,706
- Great.

575
00:23:16,383 --> 00:23:18,553
- I'll pay the gas man--
- Okay.

576
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:19,433
- We'll walk back.

577
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:20,713
- [Michelle] Okay.

578
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:25,543
- But then, I have to go
with you to get your wallet

579
00:23:25,543 --> 00:23:26,813
to pay me back the $5.00--

580
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:27,777
- Thank you.

581
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:31,624
- And you have to drive
me back. (engine humming)

582
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:35,663
- You wait here.

583
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:36,496
- [Allie] Okay.

584
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:38,043
- I will be right back.

585
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:48,833
- Look, you haven't exactly been there

586
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,343
for me emotionally or physically.

587
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:52,023
I mean, if you think about--
- I haven't?

588
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:52,856
- Last Saturday night?

589
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:53,689
- [Michelle] Yeah?

590
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:54,522
- Okay, last Saturday night,

591
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:55,863
what happened last Saturday night?

592
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:57,583
I wanted to jump all over
you, what did you do?

593
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:58,416
- Sorry!

594
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,563
- Well now come on, now listen.

595
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:02,583
It comes down to this,
it's a psychological thing.

596
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,073
I had a narcissistic injury
when I was about four years old.

597
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:07,013
Okay, I remember this very clearly.

598
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,743
Well the thing is that Angela,

599
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,893
what she brings out in me,
she brings out my inner child.

600
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:11,726
- Oh really?

601
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:12,763
- This is so important.

602
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:14,573
See, you've never really
listened to me about this stuff,

603
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:16,013
but it's really important.

604
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:18,463
See, my inner child is
fighting to get out.

605
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:20,633
And Angela, her inner
child has already come out

606
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,890
so the two of us--
- Perfect!

607
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,483
- No no no, I mean, I'm telling you,

608
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,403
it's all a psychological--

609
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:27,543
- [Allie] Michelle, do you need my help?

610
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:29,273
- Yes, please put that in there.

611
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,613
- [Allie] Okay.

612
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:31,883
- Who's this?

613
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,443
- This is Allie.

614
00:24:33,443 --> 00:24:34,653
- [Allie] Who are you?

615
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:36,303
- I own this house.

616
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:37,233
Who are you?

617
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,483
I've never seen this person in my life.

618
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:40,193
What is she doing here?

619
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:43,233
- She is the only person
that's helped me all day.

620
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,403
Thank you.

621
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:46,853
- Wait a minute, Michelle,
what are you doing?

622
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:47,856
- We're leaving.

623
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:50,253
- Listen, Michelle, please--

624
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:51,840
- It's over, forget it.

625
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,330
- Who are you anyway?

626
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,163
- [Michelle] Allie, come on.

627
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:54,996
- Who is this person?

628
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,053
- And I said, "Why don't you stay?"

629
00:24:58,053 --> 00:25:03,053
And so she stayed and then
together we would do things,

630
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:06,566
eat dinner, go for a walk, watch TV.

631
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:17,092
Michelle.

632
00:25:17,923 --> 00:25:18,756
Michelle.

633
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:26,663
It's time to get up and go out.

634
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:27,966
- I don't wanna get up.

635
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:32,573
- [Allie] You can't stay in
bed all the time, Michelle.

636
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,406
- Why?

637
00:25:34,543 --> 00:25:36,343
I don't have anything to get up for.

638
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:40,484
- Well how about a manicure?

639
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,035
Have you thought about the
job that you might get?

640
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:46,326
- [Michelle] I don't have any skills.

641
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:50,083
- [Allie] Michelle, you
can do a lot of things.

642
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,423
- [Michelle] Oh no I can't.

643
00:25:51,423 --> 00:25:53,596
- [Allie] Yes you can, look at your hands.

644
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:57,803
I can tell everything by somebody's hands.

645
00:25:57,803 --> 00:26:02,803
You're clean and you're
organized and you're careful.

646
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:07,936
- So I'll be a nice maid.

647
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,383
You are good at this though, Allie.

648
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:13,303
Where do you work?

649
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:15,983
- [Allie] Brown's Salon.

650
00:26:17,064 --> 00:26:20,097
- (clears throat) Brown's Salon?

651
00:26:20,097 --> 00:26:21,753
- Mmhmm.

652
00:26:21,753 --> 00:26:24,363
- [Michelle] That's where
Carol Schweiker goes.

653
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:26,483
- Yes, Mrs. Schweiker.

654
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:29,421
Very rich big haired lady?

655
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,254
- [Michelle] Mmhmm.

656
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:33,303
- Always goes away every weekend
with different relatives.

657
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:37,023
I guess her husband has a girlfriend.

658
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:38,076
- Really?
- Oh yeah.

659
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,563
- (laughs) Well you know, she
borrowed a few things of mine

660
00:26:43,563 --> 00:26:44,766
and hasn't returned 'em.

661
00:26:46,193 --> 00:26:48,613
Carol Schweiker was one
of my so called friends

662
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:50,863
who wasn't there for me when I needed her.

663
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:52,253
She didn't have any of my stuff,

664
00:26:52,253 --> 00:26:54,313
but I wanted to get back at her

665
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,143
and I needed the money.

666
00:26:57,143 --> 00:26:59,283
- Do you want me to ask her for them?

667
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:00,633
- Oh, she's not a very nice person.

668
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:03,083
I don't think she's gonna
return 'em that easily.

669
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:05,570
- Want me to go get 'em?

670
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,023
- How about if I go with you?

671
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:13,413
That first burglary was done in anger.

672
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:15,133
It was my way of lashing out

673
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,963
at the people who'd abandoned me.

674
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:20,383
They failed to show the love
and support I felt I deserved,

675
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:23,336
but the next one was definitely for fun.

676
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:27,173
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

677
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:28,443
Just looking in that Rolodex

678
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:32,063
and grabbing a few
addresses nobody'll miss.

679
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:32,916
No biggie, huh?

680
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:34,786
- Uh huh.

681
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:37,383
- Well, I was just thinking,

682
00:27:38,703 --> 00:27:40,603
you want that manicuring salon, right?

683
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:42,666
- [Allie] Yeah.

684
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,636
- And you deserve it.

685
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:45,756
- [Allie] Yeah.

686
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:48,373
- You know how long
it'll take you to save up

687
00:27:48,373 --> 00:27:50,496
to get your manicuring salon, Allie?

688
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:52,186
- How long?

689
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:58,354
- About 100 years.

690
00:27:58,761 --> 00:27:59,938
- 100 years?

691
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:01,521
- [Michelle] mmhmm.

692
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:03,503
- That's too long.

693
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:06,313
- That's what I'm saying.

694
00:28:06,313 --> 00:28:07,326
So I was thinking,

695
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:11,463
we might want to go to some other houses

696
00:28:11,463 --> 00:28:12,460
and help you out.

697
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:17,946
No what?

698
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:23,476
No you don't want your manicuring salon?

699
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:28,626
- No, I don't wanna steal.

700
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:32,133
- Well you know, they have insurance,

701
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,753
it's not really a big deal.

702
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,463
They'll never miss it.

703
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,646
But you, it'll help.

704
00:28:40,823 --> 00:28:44,643
Okay okay okay, so, I
did have my own motives,

705
00:28:44,643 --> 00:28:47,183
but I did wanna help Allie.

706
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,823
Really I did, especially
after what that little jerk,

707
00:28:49,823 --> 00:28:51,743
Rodney, did to her.

708
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:52,576
- [Richards] Michelle,

709
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:54,923
this brings us to the more serious charge,

710
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:59,083
Rodney Alexander claims
that you kidnapped him,

711
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:03,153
assaulted him, you deprived him of food.

712
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:04,733
We'll read some of the
stuff that he's got here.

713
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:05,596
- Well the uh,

714
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:09,223
uh, the official report
is kidnapping, assault,

715
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:13,276
attempted rape, um, but
he specifically said

716
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:15,503
that he was tied up with
duct tape for five days,

717
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,763
wasn't allowed to eat or drink anything,

718
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:23,633
almost a ritualistic sexual
abuse, um and torture.

719
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:25,873
Um, he was beaten, he was beaten

720
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:29,173
with whatever he said, with um--

721
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:30,873
- Brooms--
- A broom, a hand,

722
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:33,756
and a um--
- He's got bruises, Michelle.

723
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,683
- It was my hand--
- He didn't get these

724
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:37,583
from being tied up.

725
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,636
- It was my hand.

726
00:29:39,823 --> 00:29:41,893
- And the reason you did all
this is because he's a bad guy,

727
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:43,963
but you're not telling
us why he's a bad guy.

728
00:29:43,963 --> 00:29:45,613
What did he do to you personally?

729
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:52,973
What did he do to you?
- He didn't do anything to me,

730
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:56,053
but Allie's my only friend and

731
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:00,268
he's not a nice guy.

732
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:05,873
Rodney was spoiled, selfish, narcissistic,

733
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:09,743
arrogant and self-absorbed,
your typical male specimen.

734
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:11,673
He also happened to be an alcoholic,

735
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:13,726
pill popping, chain smoking loser.

736
00:30:14,623 --> 00:30:17,388
- [Woman] You look beautiful, look at you.

737
00:30:17,388 --> 00:30:19,191
- (laughs) Thanks.

738
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:20,024
- [Woman] You've been drinking.

739
00:30:20,024 --> 00:30:21,873
- No, I had this Irish Cream coffee,

740
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:23,363
we've gotta go, mom, come on.

741
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,323
- [Woman] Oh, I'll be about 20 minutes.

742
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,156
- We don't have 20 minutes.

743
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,001
- [Woman] What do you
mean we don't have 20--

744
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:28,667
- We don't have 20 minutes--
- [Woman] I have 20--

745
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,623
- Top of the hour--
- relax.

746
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:32,156
I want you to relax.

747
00:30:32,156 --> 00:30:33,373
Will you lower your voice?

748
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,883
Just lower your voice, relax
and just take a little breath

749
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:39,423
because I'm not in any hurry.

750
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:42,128
- Rodney, you want a
cold drink or something?

751
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:43,820
- No no, I'm okay, thanks.

752
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,653
- [Woman] If I don't make this plane,

753
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:45,613
I'll make the next plane.

754
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:47,413
- All right fine, you
wanna wait two hours?

755
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:48,333
- [Woman] What do you mean wait two hours?

756
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:49,166
- It's gonna be a two hour layover.

757
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,188
- [Woman] No, it's a direct plane.

758
00:30:50,188 --> 00:30:52,115
- That's okay, I'll book
another flight, all right?

759
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,493
- Oh, I'm sorry!

760
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:56,386
Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

761
00:30:57,307 --> 00:31:02,307
(chaotic yelling)
(chattering)

762
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,313
- [Christine] Allie,
go relax for a minute.

763
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:06,983
- [Woman] Just wash it off.

764
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:08,933
Honey, you have to be more careful.

765
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:09,766
- I was careful.

766
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:11,710
- I can't believe this, man.

767
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,905
(sighs)

768
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:19,686
- Mr. Alexander?

769
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:20,962
- [Mr. Alexander] Whoa, excuse me, oh,

770
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,893
I'm in the bathroom right now.

771
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:25,250
- Well I just came in to
give you this neutralizer

772
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,422
so I could fix your pants.

773
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:28,462
- That's okay, it's all right,
I I I'd just like to be--

774
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:31,445
(talking over each other)

775
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:32,574
- [Allie] I'm not looking, Mr. Alexander,

776
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:33,880
I'm not looking at you, see?

777
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,553
I'm just fixing your pants.

778
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:36,386
- Thank you.

779
00:31:36,386 --> 00:31:38,913
I uh, can I have my pants back, thank you.

780
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:41,753
Thank you very much, I just
would like to get changed.

781
00:31:41,753 --> 00:31:42,586
Is that all right?

782
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:43,933
- [Allie] All right Mr.
Alexander, I'm not looking.

783
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:46,096
- Okay thank you.
- I'm sorry this happened.

784
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:48,620
- It's all right, thank you very much.

785
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,627
- [Allie] I'm sorry.

786
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:51,939
- [Christine] It was just um--

787
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,153
- Thank you.
- Mr. Alexander--

788
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:57,436
- You know um, there were
a couple of accidents um,

789
00:31:58,563 --> 00:32:03,563
she um, she got bleach on
this guy's whatsis and um

790
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:10,603
well she spilled bleach on this man's um,

791
00:32:10,603 --> 00:32:14,656
she impaired this man's testicles.

792
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:16,456
Um,

793
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:22,976
he hasn't been the same since.

794
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:27,212
(cheerful music)

795
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:29,466
- Mr. Alexander?

796
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:30,503
- Oh my God!

797
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:33,483
- Uh, could I just ask
one thing, Mr. Alexander?

798
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:35,433
- Would you just excuse me for a moment

799
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,073
while I'm trying to get changed?

800
00:32:37,073 --> 00:32:39,123
- I just wanna ask you
as a way of apologizing

801
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,613
if you'd like to have dinner with me

802
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:42,823
at 5:30 tonight, early
bird supper at my home?

803
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:44,528
- That would be fine, that would be fine,

804
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:45,723
thank you and you know what?

805
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:46,753
I would love that.

806
00:32:46,753 --> 00:32:49,833
Perfect, why don't you
give me one of your cards

807
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:52,723
and I will give you a
call as soon as I am done

808
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:54,293
dropping my mother off at the airport.

809
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:55,553
- I'm Allie--
- Is it on your card?

810
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:56,683
Allie, I'm Rodney.

811
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,903
- Hi Rodney.
- Nice to meet you.

812
00:32:57,903 --> 00:32:58,963
- Tonight dinner?
- Tonight.

813
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:00,463
- 5:30.
- 5:30.

814
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:02,213
- Early bird supper--
- Thank you.

815
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:07,083
(Rodney sighs)

816
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,563
- [Michelle] That means you
asked him out on the date, huh?

817
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:12,806
- Yeah, that's okay though,
I'm a new age woman.

818
00:33:13,863 --> 00:33:14,696
He didn't mind.

819
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:18,063
He took my phone number
and address and he said--

820
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:18,990
- Oh, that's great.

821
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,869
- You're gonna call me
for dinner, aren't you?

822
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:23,258
- Yeah, thanks.

823
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:25,187
- [Allie] Don't forget
to call me though Rodney.

824
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:26,020
Don't forget.

825
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,583
- Whoa whoa whoa, what
happened, look at you.

826
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,559
- I know, I know, what can I say?

827
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:33,392
(chattering over one another)

828
00:33:55,443 --> 00:33:56,276
- Allie.

829
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:58,723
Allie?

830
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:00,073
- What do you mean by that?

831
00:34:01,864 --> 00:34:03,903
- Oh, I don't mean anything by that.

832
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:05,973
- You just said you're having a hard time

833
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:07,193
believing that somebody from the salon

834
00:34:07,193 --> 00:34:08,543
would ask me out on a date.

835
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:10,700
- Well you know--

836
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:13,943
- What, I'm not pretty?

837
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:15,313
What, I'm not smart?

838
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:16,153
- No.
- What?

839
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:17,493
I don't make a lot of money?
- No.

840
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:19,503
- What, I don't look like you?

841
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:23,033
Let me tell you something,
Rodney likes me.

842
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:27,143
He's taking me, well he's
coming for dinner here.

843
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:28,293
- That's not what meant, Allie.

844
00:34:28,293 --> 00:34:30,863
- I'll tell you what I mean,
leave me alone, Michelle,

845
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,063
I'm gonna prepare myself by fixing my hair

846
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:34,673
and I don't want any
interference from you.

847
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,343
- Allie--
- Nope.

848
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:37,343
I had the last word.

849
00:34:38,673 --> 00:34:40,093
I'm getting my hair fixed.

850
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:40,926
- Allie--
- No.

851
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:41,759
- That's not at all what I meant.

852
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,563
- [Allie] I'm sorry, I'm not available.

853
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:45,883
- Allie, come back here!

854
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,116
Allie!
- Shoo!

855
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:52,706
(sighs) Allie, I'm sorry.

856
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:55,498
Jesus.

857
00:34:57,436 --> 00:35:00,103
(door rattling)

858
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:07,577
(door squeaks)

859
00:35:19,594 --> 00:35:22,261
What have you done to your hair?

860
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:25,459
- I fried it.

861
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:26,292
- Oh my,

862
00:35:27,604 --> 00:35:28,937
oh, don't panic.

863
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:33,027
Allie, um,

864
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:38,669
it's okay, it's okay, don't panic.

865
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:41,981
I think I can do something with it.

866
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:44,966
You happy?

867
00:35:46,453 --> 00:35:47,286
- I'm happy.

868
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:53,543
When are you gonna leave?

869
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,713
- As soon as he gets here,
I'm out of here, okay?

870
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:57,803
I promise.

871
00:35:57,803 --> 00:35:58,636
- Good.

872
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,353
- [Michelle] I felt bad about
hurting Allie's feelings,

873
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:05,723
but I was only trying to protect her,

874
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:07,923
but that's when I realized
that here was someone

875
00:36:07,923 --> 00:36:09,333
who really needed me,

876
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,483
that I could do something
for someone else.

877
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:18,543
- When are you going?

878
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:21,946
- Are you sure you want me to go?

879
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:25,666
- No.

880
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:29,996
Maybe he got hit by a bus.

881
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:34,126
Maybe he lost my address
and my phone number?

882
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:38,626
Or maybe he's busy.

883
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:43,176
- Yeah, maybe he's busy.

884
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:56,489
I don't think he's coming, Allie.

885
00:36:58,339 --> 00:36:59,639
- I don't think so either.

886
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,423
(sighs)

887
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:04,273
Why don't we eat?

888
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:16,306
- Allie, how do you feel about markets?

889
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:18,886
Do you like markets?

890
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:22,783
- I like to go shopping.
- Do you like to shop?

891
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,333
You know when you go into markets

892
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:27,023
and those plastic bags
that you can pull down?

893
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:28,893
You know that sound they make?

894
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:30,483
- Crack.
- That's right, the crackle

895
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:34,376
and the brown bags, they go (exhales)

896
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:35,230
and they put the air into 'em

897
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,463
and they all fill up and
sometimes you blow 'em

898
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,203
and put a rubber band and (claps)

899
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:44,203
I was thinking that maybe
a place like a market

900
00:37:45,503 --> 00:37:48,326
would be a really good
place for you to work.

901
00:37:49,793 --> 00:37:51,504
- I wanna work here.

902
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:53,053
I gonna be a manicurist.

903
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:54,703
I wanna have my own beauty salon.

904
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:57,553
I'm not gonna work in a supermarket.

905
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:02,843
I like 'em, but I don't wanna work in one.

906
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,463
- But think about the ice cream counters

907
00:38:06,463 --> 00:38:09,893
and the cookie counters
and potato chip counters

908
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:11,473
and all those really neat--
- Christine?

909
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:12,676
If you let me stay,

910
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:17,813
if you let me stay, I won't take any money

911
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:20,143
and I'll work my way back up

912
00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:23,209
and you'll see how good I do.

913
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:26,126
(crying) You have to give me
this one more little chance.

914
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:29,203
I didn't make mistakes every time.

915
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:30,823
I've been here a long time, Christine

916
00:38:30,823 --> 00:38:33,273
and I've done some really
good things, haven't I?

917
00:38:33,273 --> 00:38:35,663
- You wanna hear something really crazy?

918
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:38,433
You even look pretty to
me with your orange hair.

919
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:40,416
See, 'cause in my heart,

920
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,983
I think you're pretty
and I love you, I do.

921
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:45,768
- Please don't make me go away,

922
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:46,601
please--
- Listen to me, Allie,

923
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,473
I was just, I've got this feeling

924
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:50,603
and I just have to, I, you know,

925
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:53,163
you learn things as you
go through life, you learn

926
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:58,483
and Allie, do you know
that Mrs. Alexander's son

927
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:00,983
is gonna sue me for what
happened to his whatsis?

928
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:02,003
- Rodney wouldn't do that.

929
00:39:02,003 --> 00:39:03,343
He's my friend, he likes me.

930
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:04,473
- He's suing us.

931
00:39:04,473 --> 00:39:06,243
- Well he likes me and I can talk to him.

932
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,893
- But I like you too.

933
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:09,683
It has nothing to do with it.

934
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,243
- Please please (crying)
don't do this to me.

935
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:13,076
- Allie--
- Let me tell you

936
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:14,493
what I'll do--
- Allie--

937
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:15,633
- I'll prove it to you, (crying)

938
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:17,646
I'll give you a manicure right now.

939
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:21,263
- There were just things
that happened like that.

940
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:23,433
I mean, she cut patron's fingers

941
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:26,506
when she'd manicure them and um,

942
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,453
she's a precious girl, but I
don't think she'd hurt anyone

943
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,753
or ever do anything wrong.

944
00:39:34,223 --> 00:39:36,303
- Well I'm gonna get a manicuring salon

945
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:38,196
after I get my manicuring license.

946
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:42,296
- (sighs) How are you gonna do that?

947
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:48,873
- Rodney's mother's out of town.

948
00:39:48,873 --> 00:39:49,706
- So?

949
00:39:50,843 --> 00:39:51,846
- She's in Mexico.

950
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:53,776
- So?

951
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,063
- We could go over there.

952
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:05,735
- Let's go.

953
00:40:09,713 --> 00:40:11,353
I know that you're probably surprised

954
00:40:11,353 --> 00:40:12,963
that this was all Allie's idea,

955
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:15,653
but Allie enjoyed the
game as much as I did.

956
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:18,963
We weren't just two losers,
broke, unemployed and single,

957
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:22,503
we were cat burglars, glamorous, powerful

958
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,106
and in charge of our destiny.

959
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:27,843
(playful music)

960
00:40:31,703 --> 00:40:34,163
I read this pamphlet on alarm systems

961
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:36,443
and the stupid thing
is, is that most of them

962
00:40:36,443 --> 00:40:38,443
are hooked up to security
monitoring companies

963
00:40:38,443 --> 00:40:40,103
through a regular phone line.

964
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:42,853
All you have to do is
disconnect the outside line

965
00:40:42,853 --> 00:40:45,323
and there's no way for
the alarm to go off.

966
00:40:45,323 --> 00:40:47,073
As it turns out, I didn't
even need to worry,

967
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:48,563
the house was all open

968
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:50,556
like a present waiting to be unwrapped.

969
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:58,783
Wow, looks like somebody
had a party here last night.

970
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:01,423
Oh Allie, the door is open.

971
00:41:01,423 --> 00:41:03,586
Are you sure uh, two weeks, huh?

972
00:41:04,953 --> 00:41:06,533
- Yeah, she's in Acapulco.

973
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:07,366
- Okay.

974
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:10,296
Take it easy.

975
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,386
Look at this.

976
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:22,352
Whoa looks like there was
a party here last night.

977
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:24,852
(jazzy music)

978
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:00,069
Nice view.

979
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:02,569
(jazzy music)

980
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:15,552
- Terrible housekeeping.

981
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,300
- Whoa, we're here to rob your house.

982
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,129
- Yeah, you heard her!

983
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:24,730
We're here to rob your house.

984
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,147
We're robbing it.

985
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:29,845
- All right, let's go
check out the merchandise.

986
00:42:29,845 --> 00:42:31,037
- Ow.

987
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:33,963
Yeah, let's check out the stuff.

988
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:35,066
Ow.

989
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:37,566
(jazzy music)

990
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:49,858
(Michelle whistling)

991
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:53,282
- Ah, here we are.

992
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,513
Allie no, get out of the
bathroom now, come on.

993
00:43:07,444 --> 00:43:08,993
We have plenty of beauty supplies, Allie,

994
00:43:08,993 --> 00:43:10,673
come on, let's go.

995
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:14,079
- I need these beauty
supplies, Michelle, I need 'em.

996
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:14,912
Woo.

997
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:18,898
Ah!
(man grunting)

998
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:20,138
(Allie screaming)

999
00:43:20,138 --> 00:43:22,058
- Man, Jesus Christ--
- Oh my God!

1000
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:25,946
Oh my God.
(Rodney coughing)

1001
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:27,191
- What the hell are you doing?

1002
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:28,363
What are you doing here?

1003
00:43:28,363 --> 00:43:30,317
- Rodney--
- What?

1004
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:32,113
I know you, what are you
doing in my mother's bed?

1005
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:32,946
- What's going on?

1006
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:33,779
Come on, let's go!

1007
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:38,112
(everyone talking over one another)

1008
00:43:43,427 --> 00:43:44,867
(Rodney grunts)

1009
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:45,867
- Oh my God.

1010
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:52,388
(Rodney groans)
(Allie whimpers)

1011
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,852
You killed him.

1012
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:02,307
- No.

1013
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,650
Oh no, he's not dead.

1014
00:44:09,782 --> 00:44:10,861
Oh shit.

1015
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:12,158
- Well what, what, what is it?

1016
00:44:12,158 --> 00:44:13,691
- Shit!
- What what?

1017
00:44:13,691 --> 00:44:15,333
(Michelle sighs)
Michelle, what is it?

1018
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,733
- We can't leave.

1019
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:18,063
- Why?

1020
00:44:18,063 --> 00:44:19,650
- He saw us.

1021
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,743
- Oh.
- Oh God.

1022
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:22,709
- He saw us.

1023
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:25,063
What are we gonna do?

1024
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:26,213
- Well we'll have to--
- Go,

1025
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:28,666
we've got to go back, go, go on.

1026
00:44:30,313 --> 00:44:33,230
(Michelle mutters)

1027
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:38,406
You get him in a chair,

1028
00:44:38,406 --> 00:44:40,313
I'm gonna go get something
to tie him up with.

1029
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:41,146
- Okay.

1030
00:44:44,744 --> 00:44:46,457
Excuse me, Rodney.

1031
00:44:46,457 --> 00:44:48,957
(jazzy music)

1032
00:44:57,685 --> 00:45:00,435
(Allie grunting)

1033
00:45:05,058 --> 00:45:05,891
Gee.

1034
00:45:07,213 --> 00:45:09,963
(Allie grunting)

1035
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:22,652
Ow.

1036
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:25,152
(jazzy music)

1037
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:29,251
- Want that, yes.

1038
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:32,116
(drawer slams)

1039
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:33,878
(Allie grunting)

1040
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:35,603
Allie, quit screwing around.

1041
00:45:35,603 --> 00:45:38,999
Come on.
(Allie grunting)

1042
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:41,283
- Oh my God, Michelle, he's on my arm.

1043
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:42,116
- Oh come on.

1044
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:43,083
- What do you mean?

1045
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:44,911
Get him off of that side.

1046
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:47,123
I'm under his, (pained yelling)

1047
00:45:47,123 --> 00:45:48,513
oh my God.

1048
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:49,346
- Come on.

1049
00:45:51,663 --> 00:45:56,663
(engine humming)
(jazzy music)

1050
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,889
(door humming)

1051
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:29,549
(Rodney groans)

1052
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:40,232
(Rodney gasping)

1053
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:49,534
- (laughing) What the fuck is this man?

1054
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:57,228
This is very funny. (grunting)

1055
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:04,160
Hey, okay, I'm sober, man!

1056
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:08,823
Come on, you can untie me, all right?

1057
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:14,063
Oh fuck, I'm gonna kill you!

1058
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:17,060
Hey hey, (yelling incoherently)
come and untie me, okay?

1059
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:22,143
- He's screaming.

1060
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:23,223
- [Rodney] Jesus Christ!

1061
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:24,343
- Oh my God, he's screaming.

1062
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:27,853
- This is fucking illegal!

1063
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:29,881
This is kidnapping!

1064
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:31,619
God dammit!

1065
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:35,826
Oh my God, oh my God,
I'm gonna fucking panic.

1066
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:37,621
Untie me, untie me right now.

1067
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,647
- Rodney, all right.
- Untie me,

1068
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,652
untie me right now!
- Calm down, breath!

1069
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:42,683
- Untie me right now, don't tell me to sh,

1070
00:47:42,683 --> 00:47:44,500
just untie me, okay--
- Rodney,

1071
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,354
I'll until you--
- Okay.

1072
00:47:46,354 --> 00:47:47,743
- Shh, shh--
- Okay, all right man.

1073
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:50,443
- Don't wake anybody
else up like Michelle.

1074
00:47:50,443 --> 00:47:51,446
- [Michelle] Rodney, would you shut up?

1075
00:47:51,446 --> 00:47:54,043
- Don't tell me to shut up, untie me.

1076
00:47:54,043 --> 00:47:55,543
- Calm down, Rodney.

1077
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:56,843
Think beautiful thoughts, Rodney,

1078
00:47:56,843 --> 00:47:57,943
think beautiful thoughts.

1079
00:47:57,943 --> 00:47:59,823
- Just untie me!
- Michelle,

1080
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:01,347
- Okay, this is like kidnapping.

1081
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:03,429
- Shut up!
- Untie me.

1082
00:48:03,429 --> 00:48:05,019
(muffled protesting)
- Oh my God,

1083
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:06,161
Jesus, goodnight.

1084
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:07,078
- Untie me!

1085
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:09,979
I'm Rodney Alexander!

1086
00:48:11,507 --> 00:48:14,590
(muffled protesting)

1087
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:16,822
Untie me!
(Allie yelps)

1088
00:48:16,822 --> 00:48:17,893
Untie me!

1089
00:48:17,893 --> 00:48:19,740
- I'm sorry, Rodney.
- Untie me.

1090
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:21,466
- I'm sorry.

1091
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:24,753
- No please, no no, please,
please, please come here.

1092
00:48:24,753 --> 00:48:26,393
- Just try to relax.

1093
00:48:26,393 --> 00:48:29,036
Breath, Rodney, good thoughts.

1094
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:31,294
Think good thoughts, Rodney.

1095
00:48:31,294 --> 00:48:32,281
- Come here.

1096
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:33,781
- [Allie] I can't.

1097
00:48:35,438 --> 00:48:38,970
- (crying) I am fucking pissed!

1098
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:40,873
(birds chirping)

1099
00:48:40,873 --> 00:48:43,573
- [Burke] Okay, so this
was just another burglary

1100
00:48:43,573 --> 00:48:45,997
and he happened to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time?

1101
00:48:45,997 --> 00:48:47,333
- Mmhmm.

1102
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,273
- [Burke] I have a
question is why wouldn't,

1103
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,169
I mean five days,

1104
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:52,893
that doesn't make sense to me,

1105
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:54,143
keeping him bound for five days

1106
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:58,463
when you're usually in and
out of your victim's home.

1107
00:48:58,463 --> 00:49:01,370
- Well, that's how long
we decided to stay there.

1108
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:04,203
(cassette clicks)

1109
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,100

Simon could never understand.

1130
00:50:44,923 --> 00:50:46,753
He's a cop, after all.

1131
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:49,303
We stayed because it was a nice house.

1132
00:50:49,303 --> 00:50:51,293
There was a pool and a refrigerator

1133
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:53,953
full of smoked salmon and caviar.

1134
00:50:53,953 --> 00:50:56,443
Egyptian cotton sheets, a good stereo

1135
00:50:56,443 --> 00:50:59,113
and plenty of margaritas.

1136
00:50:59,113 --> 00:51:02,106
I knew that it wouldn't last
forever, but I didn't care.

1137
00:51:02,106 --> 00:51:05,433
For those few days, we
were living for the moment.

1138
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:09,023
I still think of those days as
some of the best of my life.

1139
00:51:09,023 --> 00:51:13,586
Of course, there was one major
dark cloud on our horizon.

1140
00:51:15,026 --> 00:51:16,052
(Rodney gasps)

1141
00:51:16,052 --> 00:51:17,111
- Oh my God.

1142
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:18,773
You're gonna kill me like that, man.

1143
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:21,403
I got allergies, I can't
breath through my left nostril,

1144
00:51:21,403 --> 00:51:22,893
okay, I got a deviated septum

1145
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:25,003
and this is like a wool carpet, okay?

1146
00:51:25,003 --> 00:51:26,233
I'm allergic to wool.

1147
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,283
Please just don't put
that on my mouth again.

1148
00:51:28,283 --> 00:51:29,833
- All right, I'm sorry, Rodney.

1149
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:33,366
- (sighs) Who are you?

1150
00:51:34,903 --> 00:51:35,736
Huh?

1151
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:38,423
- [Allie] Allie.

1152
00:51:38,423 --> 00:51:41,403
- Allie, what do you want from me, Allie?

1153
00:51:41,403 --> 00:51:42,423
- You gotta keep up your strength.

1154
00:51:42,423 --> 00:51:43,723
Let me give you some food.

1155
00:51:45,383 --> 00:51:47,906
- No, I don't want any food, thank you.

1156
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,660
- Rodney, you need to eat.

1157
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,166
Go ahead, some nice
orange juice, vitamin C.

1158
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:57,887
Good, huh?

1159
00:51:57,887 --> 00:51:58,898
- Yes.

1160
00:51:58,898 --> 00:52:00,236
- [Allie] Okay and here's some eggs.

1161
00:52:00,236 --> 00:52:01,633
- I don't want any food, I'm not hungry.

1162
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:03,743
- Oh come on Rodney--
- Allie.

1163
00:52:03,743 --> 00:52:05,043
- It's good--
- I don't want any

1164
00:52:05,043 --> 00:52:06,513
fuckin' room service, okay?

1165
00:52:06,513 --> 00:52:07,785
Just get that offa me, all right?

1166
00:52:07,785 --> 00:52:08,793
- [Allie] Rodney, Rodney be nice.

1167
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:12,829
- Okay, look, what do you want from me?

1168
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:13,679
What do you need?

1169
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:16,303
- I'm the girl that you had a date with,

1170
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:18,773
an early bird supper
and you didn't show up

1171
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:22,043
and I fried my hair and it
turned into red and I got fired.

1172
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:23,145
That's who I am, Rodney.

1173
00:52:23,145 --> 00:52:24,353
- We had a date?

1174
00:52:24,353 --> 00:52:25,553
- I had a date with you.

1175
00:52:26,572 --> 00:52:29,283
- (laughs) This is about a date?

1176
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:30,116
- [Allie] This is about
you hurting my feelings--

1177
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:34,363
- You've got me tied up 'cause
I stood you up on a date?

1178
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:36,052
What, are you mad?

1179
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,702
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1180
00:52:38,603 --> 00:52:41,363
Do you know, you could go up on charges

1181
00:52:41,363 --> 00:52:45,503
for burglary, for assault,
for a hostage situation,

1182
00:52:45,503 --> 00:52:46,953
for kidnapping, I mean--
- Don't say those things.

1183
00:52:46,953 --> 00:52:48,513
- We're talking about seven or eight years

1184
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:50,433
in the California State Penitentiary, man.

1185
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:51,283
Do you wanna--
- Don't say those things,

1186
00:52:51,283 --> 00:52:52,503
Rodney.
- It's the truth.

1187
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,463
- No, Rodney--
- It's the truth.

1188
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:55,733
If you untie me, I swear to God,

1189
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:57,743
I'll have you absolved of all char,

1190
00:52:57,743 --> 00:52:59,086
is that my mother's shirt?

1191
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,066
- I just borrowed it.

1192
00:53:02,066 --> 00:53:03,243
- Is that my mother's shirt?

1193
00:53:03,243 --> 00:53:04,076
- Rodney!

1194
00:53:04,913 --> 00:53:07,743
- Oh man, what are you wearing
my mother's clothes for?

1195
00:53:07,743 --> 00:53:09,436
- [Allie] I thought it looked nice on me.

1196
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,106
- (exhales) Oh, this is so weird.

1197
00:53:14,223 --> 00:53:15,423
This is so fuckin' weird.

1198
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:16,543
- [Allie] Can I give
you some advice, Rodney?

1199
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:19,853
- Oh yeah, please, please do.

1200
00:53:19,853 --> 00:53:21,493
- You'd better start being nice!

1201
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:22,633
- What do you mean nice?

1202
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:23,763
- Nice to me!

1203
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:25,154
- You fucking untie me!

1204
00:53:25,154 --> 00:53:28,654
(yelling over each other)

1205
00:53:29,616 --> 00:53:30,573
If you don't untie me right now,

1206
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:32,154
I swear to God, when I break free of this,

1207
00:53:32,154 --> 00:53:35,046
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'll kill you!

1208
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:37,243
All right?
- All right Rodney--

1209
00:53:37,243 --> 00:53:38,653
- I take that back--
- You went too far.

1210
00:53:38,653 --> 00:53:39,890
- I won't kill ya.
- I will not

1211
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:40,723
be talking to you again--
- All right,

1212
00:53:40,723 --> 00:53:41,663
just untie me, I'm sorry--
- Not today!

1213
00:53:41,663 --> 00:53:42,540
- I'm sorry, I went over the line.

1214
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,133
- And I'm speaking to
Michelle about all this.

1215
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:45,049
- I went over the line, I'm sorry.

1216
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:46,386
- That's it.
- Don't don't leave me.

1217
00:53:46,386 --> 00:53:47,873
Don't leave me, come back here.

1218
00:53:47,873 --> 00:53:49,343
Come back here, I'm sorry.

1219
00:53:49,343 --> 00:53:50,743
I was just joking, okay?

1220
00:53:50,743 --> 00:53:52,313
I'm not gonna kill ya.

1221
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:53,646
All right, I'll cooperate.

1222
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,463
(gentle piano music)

1223
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:04,316
- Allie?

1224
00:54:08,898 --> 00:54:10,398
What's the matter?

1225
00:54:13,822 --> 00:54:15,415
What's wrong?

1226
00:54:15,415 --> 00:54:18,498
(gentle piano music)

1227
00:54:23,242 --> 00:54:24,553
What did he do?

1228
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:25,386
What did he say?

1229
00:54:26,803 --> 00:54:27,636
Tell me.

1230
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:32,277
- He doesn't like me.

1231
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,036
- [Michelle] He doesn't like you?

1232
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:39,793
- [Allie] It's not him, Michelle, it's me.

1233
00:54:39,793 --> 00:54:41,442
- No it's not, it's not you.

1234
00:54:41,442 --> 00:54:42,623
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

1235
00:54:42,623 --> 00:54:45,193
He's not a nice person in
case you haven't noticed.

1236
00:54:45,193 --> 00:54:46,770
- I'm not pretty.
- No.

1237
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:47,826
- I'm not smart.

1238
00:54:50,853 --> 00:54:53,893
- [Michelle] Allie, you're
beautiful and you're smart

1239
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:55,593
and it has nothing to do with you.

1240
00:54:56,765 --> 00:55:00,196
(Allie crying)
Did you hear me?

1241
00:55:01,143 --> 00:55:02,679
Do you understand?

1242
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:07,679
(gentle piano music)
(Allie crying)

1243
00:55:11,123 --> 00:55:13,706
(Rodney sighs)

1244
00:55:16,263 --> 00:55:18,373
What'd you say to her?
- What?

1245
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:19,343
- What'd you say to her?

1246
00:55:19,343 --> 00:55:20,553
- What do you mean, what'd I say to her?

1247
00:55:20,553 --> 00:55:21,913
I told her untie me.

1248
00:55:21,913 --> 00:55:23,453
- [Michelle] You've upset her now.

1249
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:25,023
- I've upset her?

1250
00:55:25,023 --> 00:55:26,203
This joke has gone far enough.

1251
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:27,036
You wanna know something--
- I don't think

1252
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:28,983
you're in the position to
argue with me right now.

1253
00:55:28,983 --> 00:55:30,413
I want you to be nice to Allie.

1254
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:32,633
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

1255
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:33,883
You've got me tied to a chair!

1256
00:55:33,883 --> 00:55:36,013
- [Michelle] I suggest you
just relax and be nice to her.

1257
00:55:36,013 --> 00:55:37,583
- I can't relax, I'm tied to a chair.

1258
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:38,433
What do you want?

1259
00:55:38,433 --> 00:55:39,383
You tell me what you want.

1260
00:55:39,383 --> 00:55:40,466
Whatever you want, you
name it, you got it.

1261
00:55:40,466 --> 00:55:41,586
- Are you through?

1262
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:45,693
- Untie me!

1263
00:55:45,693 --> 00:55:46,886
- You know what, I'll be back
when your attitude's better.

1264
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,676
- [Rodney] No, you untie me now!

1265
00:55:49,643 --> 00:55:50,953
Get back here!

1266
00:55:50,953 --> 00:55:52,076
You get back here!

1267
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:57,740
Michelle!

1268
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,490
(cheerful music)

1269
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:11,083
Can I talk to you a minute?

1270
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,503
- [Allie] I'd better go.

1271
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:15,446
I gotta--
- Oh come on, I'll do it.

1272
00:56:17,001 --> 00:56:18,101
- Okay Michelle, look,

1273
00:56:18,953 --> 00:56:23,183
you're right, I'm willing
to negotiate here,

1274
00:56:23,183 --> 00:56:24,916
I'm willing to compromise.

1275
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:28,283
Can I speak to you for a moment please?

1276
00:56:28,283 --> 00:56:29,567
- You called?

1277
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:31,303
- (sighs) Thank you, yes.

1278
00:56:31,303 --> 00:56:32,926
Uh, all right,

1279
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,703
(sighs) I'm just a product
of my environment, okay?

1280
00:56:38,703 --> 00:56:41,873
And I don't know what I did
in the karmic circle of life

1281
00:56:41,873 --> 00:56:45,243
to sort of deserve this
particular situation,

1282
00:56:45,243 --> 00:56:49,433
but whatever it is, I'm sure
it's justified in your eyes

1283
00:56:49,433 --> 00:56:53,603
and I'm willing to
apologize and to acquiesce

1284
00:56:53,603 --> 00:56:55,913
to whatever it is that you need.

1285
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,323
What do you need me to do?

1286
00:56:57,323 --> 00:56:58,973
- I need you to be nice to Allie.

1287
00:56:58,973 --> 00:57:00,673
I need you to be real nice to her.

1288
00:57:01,523 --> 00:57:03,143
I need you to make her feel special--

1289
00:57:03,143 --> 00:57:04,553
- You need me to be nice to Allie?

1290
00:57:04,553 --> 00:57:05,813
I know, you keep saying that.

1291
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:08,983
I don't think I really
understood the full capacity

1292
00:57:08,983 --> 00:57:10,013
of that statement before,

1293
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:12,713
but it's starting to
gain some weight with me.

1294
00:57:12,713 --> 00:57:14,363
I understand what you need.

1295
00:57:14,363 --> 00:57:16,853
It's not in my nature
to be nice to people,

1296
00:57:16,853 --> 00:57:20,033
but I'm starting to catch that momentum.

1297
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:24,373
You need a real genuine, sincere, nice,

1298
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:26,028
nice--
- you think you can do that?

1299
00:57:26,028 --> 00:57:27,783
- I think I can.

1300
00:57:27,783 --> 00:57:29,483
- How do I know I can believe you?

1301
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:35,111
- Hey look, if I slighted
her in any other way,

1302
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:36,803
I'm not aware of it.

1303
00:57:36,803 --> 00:57:39,463
I mean, it's just, it's part of my nature.

1304
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:41,853
- [Michelle] All right, that's enough.

1305
00:57:41,853 --> 00:57:43,443
I'll give you one chance.

1306
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:44,276
- All right.

1307
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:46,904
- [Allie] What did he say?

1308
00:57:46,904 --> 00:57:48,404
- He said he wants to see you.

1309
00:57:50,745 --> 00:57:51,578
- [Allie] For what?

1310
00:57:51,578 --> 00:57:53,673
- I don't know, why don't you go find out?

1311
00:57:58,053 --> 00:57:58,886
Go on.

1312
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,156
Go see what he wants.

1313
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:07,442
- [Allie] Is he gonna be nice?

1314
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,204
- I don't know, I have a feeling.

1315
00:58:09,204 --> 00:58:11,871
(Allie giggles)

1316
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:17,736
- Allie, hey.

1317
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:21,126
Oh, come in, come on in, please.

1318
00:58:22,303 --> 00:58:23,136
Oh thanks.

1319
00:58:24,711 --> 00:58:25,803
(sighs)

1320
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:27,463
- Michelle said you wanted to speak to me?

1321
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:30,143
- [Rodney] And she's
absolutely right, I did.

1322
00:58:30,143 --> 00:58:30,976
How are you?

1323
00:58:33,283 --> 00:58:35,293
- I'm okay, how are you?

1324
00:58:35,293 --> 00:58:37,623
- I'm okay, I'm (sighs)

1325
00:58:39,443 --> 00:58:40,559
I just want to tell ya,

1326
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,066
I'm really sorry we
got off to a bad start.

1327
00:58:47,433 --> 00:58:48,276
I just uh,

1328
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:52,286
I don't know, it just sort
of took my by surprise and

1329
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:54,513
I realize you're--
- That's okay.

1330
00:58:54,513 --> 00:58:56,363
- Is it okay?
- I understand.

1331
00:58:56,363 --> 00:58:58,063
- You do?
- Uh huh.

1332
00:58:58,063 --> 00:58:58,896
- Wow.

1333
00:59:00,399 --> 00:59:01,599
You're so understanding.

1334
00:59:02,853 --> 00:59:04,636
I really like that about you.

1335
00:59:06,272 --> 00:59:08,986
(sighs) I just uh,

1336
00:59:11,493 --> 00:59:15,086
I just uh, I don't know, I'm sorry.

1337
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,386
I'm just really sorry.

1338
00:59:18,403 --> 00:59:20,283
- You're really sweet.

1339
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:21,116
- I'm sweet?

1340
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:24,526
- [Allie] You're sweet.

1341
00:59:24,526 --> 00:59:25,363
- I don't think anybody's

1342
00:59:25,363 --> 00:59:27,823
ever called me sweet my whole life.

1343
00:59:27,823 --> 00:59:31,436
I think, I think you bring that out in me.

1344
00:59:33,224 --> 00:59:35,891
(Rodney grunts)

1345
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:45,206
(Rodney sighs)
- Oh.

1346
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:48,713
- Wow, wow.

1347
00:59:50,303 --> 00:59:51,136
You okay?

1348
00:59:52,647 --> 00:59:54,080
You all right?

1349
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,593
You okay, hey, you know what, uh,

1350
00:59:57,593 --> 00:59:59,043
don't panic, here, come back.

1351
01:00:00,053 --> 01:00:02,074
You know what I could really use?

1352
01:00:02,074 --> 01:00:02,907
- What?

1353
01:00:02,907 --> 01:00:05,210
- [Rodney] I could use a hug right now.

1354
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,877
(Rodney grunts)

1355
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:11,776
Thanks.

1356
01:00:16,648 --> 01:00:17,481
You know what,

1357
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:22,481
I would really love to put
my arms around you right now.

1358
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:24,074
- [Allie] You would?

1359
01:00:24,074 --> 01:00:25,598
- Yeah.

1360
01:00:25,598 --> 01:00:26,816
That'd make me so happy.

1361
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:34,346
- Michelle?

1362
01:00:36,643 --> 01:00:38,293
He kissed me.

1363
01:00:38,293 --> 01:00:39,126
- He did?

1364
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,236
- He kissed me.

1365
01:00:43,413 --> 01:00:44,246
- Great.

1366
01:00:45,153 --> 01:00:47,613
- He gave me a kiss.

1367
01:00:47,613 --> 01:00:48,907
- That's excellent.

1368
01:00:48,907 --> 01:00:52,043
(woman giggling)

1369
01:00:52,043 --> 01:00:53,293
- Now he wants to hug me.

1370
01:00:54,163 --> 01:00:55,295
- He does?
- Yeah.

1371
01:00:55,295 --> 01:00:57,493
I just have to untie his hands.

1372
01:00:57,493 --> 01:00:58,326
- Ow, what are you doing?

1373
01:00:58,326 --> 01:00:59,159
What the hell's gotten into you?

1374
01:00:59,159 --> 01:00:59,992
- [Michelle] Shut up!

1375
01:00:59,992 --> 01:01:01,510
- What the hell, what's wrong with you?

1376
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,443
- [Michelle] We are not stupid, Rodney!

1377
01:01:03,443 --> 01:01:05,016
- I didn't say you were stupid.

1378
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:09,166
Great ass though.

1379
01:01:10,383 --> 01:01:14,186
Oh, I was just kidding. (screams in pain)

1380
01:01:16,002 --> 01:01:18,752
(birds chirping)

1381
01:01:22,037 --> 01:01:22,870
- Hi hon,

1382
01:01:26,533 --> 01:01:27,783
you having fun?

1383
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,575
- What did you say to Rodney?

1384
01:01:32,947 --> 01:01:35,047
- (sighs) I didn't say anything to Rodney.

1385
01:01:37,175 --> 01:01:38,686
You know, I was thinking though,

1386
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,933
you can do a lot better
than Rodney, Allie.

1387
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:45,173
- No I can't, Michelle.

1388
01:01:45,173 --> 01:01:46,006
- Yes, you can.

1389
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:53,013
- I'm not leaving Rodney, Michelle.

1390
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,046
- Allie, God.

1391
01:01:56,942 --> 01:01:58,796
(sighs) How do I explain this to you?

1392
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:01,263
- I understand him.

1393
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:02,096
- We'll never see each other again--

1394
01:02:02,096 --> 01:02:03,333
- I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

1395
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:04,773
- Allie--
- I'm not leaving Rodney!

1396
01:02:04,773 --> 01:02:06,033
- Allie!
- I'm not leaving Rodney--

1397
01:02:06,033 --> 01:02:08,328
- Allie!
- I don't wanna talk about it!

1398
01:02:08,328 --> 01:02:10,713
(Michelle sighs)

1399
01:02:10,713 --> 01:02:12,463
- Fine then we'll be in jail,

1400
01:02:12,463 --> 01:02:14,043
we'll never see each other again,

1401
01:02:14,043 --> 01:02:16,883
you'll never get your manicuring
license and that's it,

1402
01:02:16,883 --> 01:02:18,233
that's the end of our life.

1403
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,475
- Would you leave me alone?

1404
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:28,113
(Michelle exhales)

1405
01:02:28,113 --> 01:02:29,663
I'd like to be alone right now.

1406
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,517
(thumps ball)
(water splashes)

1407
01:02:36,517 --> 01:02:39,267

1408
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:44,469

(Michelle laughs)

1432
01:04:37,593 --> 01:04:39,243
- You gotta understand, Michelle,

1433
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:42,726
there are some things between two people

1434
01:04:42,726 --> 01:04:44,226
that you don't understand.

1435
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:48,126
Don't do that, don't
treat me like I'm stupid.

1436
01:04:49,183 --> 01:04:52,226
- Fine, marry him, whatever.

1437
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:55,356
Have kids together.

1438
01:05:07,473 --> 01:05:08,306
- I will.

1439
01:05:12,003 --> 01:05:13,283
- Good.

1440
01:05:13,283 --> 01:05:15,863
I began to realize we had a problem.

1441
01:05:15,863 --> 01:05:19,143
Rodney being nice to Allie
wasn't gonna be enough for her.

1442
01:05:19,143 --> 01:05:21,913
She had tasted love and she wanted more.

1443
01:05:21,913 --> 01:05:24,373
I'd been trying to make her
feel good about herself,

1444
01:05:24,373 --> 01:05:26,863
but I realize now that
there was the potential

1445
01:05:26,863 --> 01:05:28,850
for a serious fall.

1446
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:32,267
(gentle strumming music)

1447
01:05:37,989 --> 01:05:40,228
- Good morning, Rodney.

1448
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,733
- [Rodney] Good morning, Allie.

1449
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:43,833
- Are you comfortable?

1450
01:05:45,585 --> 01:05:47,396
- (sighs) Comfortable,

1451
01:05:49,143 --> 01:05:53,133
I've never felt so
comfortable in all my life.

1452
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:56,375
I've never felt so well
looked after my whole life.

1453
01:05:56,375 --> 01:06:00,143
I never had anybody
cook for me and clean me

1454
01:06:00,143 --> 01:06:04,493
and comb my hair, not even my own mother.

1455
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,063
- Do you really mean that, Rodney?

1456
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:08,023
- [Rodney] I really do, Allie.

1457
01:06:08,023 --> 01:06:10,343
I mean I've spent years in therapy.

1458
01:06:10,343 --> 01:06:12,423
I was on Ritalin as a kid.

1459
01:06:12,423 --> 01:06:16,133
I mean, I, at 16, they put me on Prozac

1460
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:19,193
and I've taken pills and booze

1461
01:06:19,193 --> 01:06:21,713
and cigarettes and these five days,

1462
01:06:21,713 --> 01:06:24,373
I think you've even
helped me quit smoking.

1463
01:06:24,373 --> 01:06:25,676
I really wanna thank you.

1464
01:06:27,677 --> 01:06:30,344
(Rodney grunts)

1465
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:35,003
Wow.

1466
01:06:35,003 --> 01:06:35,853
- [Allie] Rodney,

1467
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:43,386
what would you do if I untied you?

1468
01:06:46,597 --> 01:06:49,347
- (laughs) I uh,

1469
01:06:54,173 --> 01:06:57,036
I might ask you, I might ask you not to.

1470
01:06:57,983 --> 01:06:58,816
- Why?

1471
01:07:00,553 --> 01:07:02,496
- I don't know, I just feel so,

1472
01:07:03,893 --> 01:07:05,516
I feel so connected with you.

1473
01:07:09,884 --> 01:07:12,726
Have you ever made love to a man before?

1474
01:07:16,903 --> 01:07:17,813
Never?

1475
01:07:17,813 --> 01:07:19,370
You've never gone all the way?

1476
01:07:22,603 --> 01:07:23,436
- Have you ever made love

1477
01:07:23,436 --> 01:07:25,856
to a developmentally
challenged girl before?

1478
01:07:27,983 --> 01:07:30,566
- No, I never have.

1479
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:32,756
- This is great.

1480
01:07:34,623 --> 01:07:36,826
This is both gonna be our first time.

1481
01:07:36,826 --> 01:07:39,826
(scissors clipping)

1482
01:07:40,843 --> 01:07:41,830
- [Richards] Simon,
we've been driving around

1483
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:43,036
for like two hours here.

1484
01:07:45,105 --> 01:07:47,163
There's no sidewalks in this place.

1485
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:49,326
- [Burke] Hey, nobody walks around here.

1486
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,633
(Richards sighs)

1487
01:07:52,633 --> 01:07:54,343
- [Richards] I wanna walk
right now to a restaurant,

1488
01:07:54,343 --> 01:07:55,784
that's where I wanna walk.

1489
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:57,683
- All right, all right--
- We're going to the game,

1490
01:07:57,683 --> 01:08:00,043
I wanna see the Dodgers and that's it.

1491
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:01,173
This is ruining my whole day.

1492
01:08:01,173 --> 01:08:02,373
There's nothing up here.

1493
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,037
My stomach's growling.

1494
01:08:05,037 --> 01:08:05,924
Can you hear it?

1495
01:08:05,924 --> 01:08:07,860
- [Burke] (laughs) No,
I didn't hear it, Frank.

1496
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:10,306
Lot of stuff going on
around here it looks like.

1497
01:08:10,306 --> 01:08:12,639
- Well God, what's going on?

1498
01:08:14,527 --> 01:08:18,826
Eh, (sighs) all right,
that's it, there's nothing.

1499
01:08:22,293 --> 01:08:23,888
- [Burke] See that, what is that?

1500
01:08:23,888 --> 01:08:24,721
- [Richards] What?

1501
01:08:24,721 --> 01:08:26,856
- [Burke] 7206, what's the book on 7206?

1502
01:08:29,178 --> 01:08:30,583
- [Richards] Oh, that's Alexander,

1503
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:32,643
that's the one that we talked today.

1504
01:08:32,643 --> 01:08:34,243
- Okay, I don't--
- Beauty parlor,

1505
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:35,591
what's her name?

1506
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:38,163
- [Burke] I think we
should take a look at that.

1507
01:08:38,163 --> 01:08:39,141
- [Richards] Oh come on, will ya?

1508
01:08:39,141 --> 01:08:43,323
This is, you're grasping at straws here,

1509
01:08:43,323 --> 01:08:44,156
you know what I mean?
- Well, I mean,

1510
01:08:44,156 --> 01:08:45,483
we're here and--
- I mean, the thing

1511
01:08:45,483 --> 01:08:47,010
on the ground (muttering)
- Well see

1512
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,245
and we'll just take a quick look--

1513
01:08:48,245 --> 01:08:50,248
- [Richards] All right,
this, I'm staying in the car.

1514
01:08:50,248 --> 01:08:51,303
You go in--
- All right, stay in the car.

1515
01:08:51,303 --> 01:08:52,253
I'll be right back.

1516
01:08:54,227 --> 01:08:57,427
(keys clink)

1517
01:08:57,427 --> 01:09:00,293
(zipper buzzes)

1518
01:09:00,293 --> 01:09:02,023
- [Michelle] I was faced with a dilemma.

1519
01:09:02,023 --> 01:09:03,673
I knew that Rodney
didn't care about Allie,

1520
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:06,183
but I also knew how
stubborn Allie could be.

1521
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,543
As I got ready to load the car,

1522
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,193
I racked my brain for ways
to get Allie out of there,

1523
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:14,536
but as things turned out,
I never got the chance.

1524
01:09:15,802 --> 01:09:18,552
(doorbell rings)

1525
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,492
(door squeaks)

1526
01:09:27,492 --> 01:09:29,540
(Michelle laughs)
- Hi, Michelle.

1527
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,692
- [Michelle] Hi, yeah.

1528
01:09:30,692 --> 01:09:32,189
- Yeah, we met at the, the other day.

1529
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:34,533
- Parking ticket.
- Right, right.

1530
01:09:34,533 --> 01:09:35,533
- Hi.
- You live here?

1531
01:09:35,533 --> 01:09:37,896
- Uh no, I'm house sitting, yeah.

1532
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,383
What are you doing here?

1533
01:09:40,383 --> 01:09:41,826
- Well we were, I was
driving by and I noticed

1534
01:09:41,826 --> 01:09:43,296
that your gate was open.

1535
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:47,100
- [Rodney] I want you
to go to the bathroom

1536
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,716
and put on your best perfume.

1537
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:53,120
- Perfume?

1538
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:54,903
Here's the scissors.

1539
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:56,273
- Oh.
- You do the rest.

1540
01:09:56,273 --> 01:09:58,016
- [Rodney] Okay, all right.

1541
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,936
(grunts) Oh.

1542
01:10:03,323 --> 01:10:04,453
- [Allie] I'll be in the bathroom.

1543
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:05,286
- Okay.

1544
01:10:05,286 --> 01:10:06,576
- [Allie] I'll be right back.

1545
01:10:06,576 --> 01:10:08,126
- All right, you go freshen up.

1546
01:10:09,211 --> 01:10:10,044
Okay.

1547
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:17,103
(gasping) Oh.

1548
01:10:17,103 --> 01:10:18,687
Thank you. (exhales)

1549
01:10:18,687 --> 01:10:23,104
(gasping)
(grunting)

1550
01:10:31,162 --> 01:10:33,133
(body thumps loudly)

1551
01:10:33,133 --> 01:10:34,944
- [Burke] No, it's just precaution.

1552
01:10:34,944 --> 01:10:36,103
I don't mean to scare you.

1553
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:37,653
- Oh good.

1554
01:10:37,653 --> 01:10:40,363
Um well, I was getting ready to go out,

1555
01:10:40,363 --> 01:10:41,433
but thanks for coming by.

1556
01:10:41,433 --> 01:10:42,456
- Oh sure.

1557
01:10:43,933 --> 01:10:45,373
Okay.

1558
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:47,223
It's good seeing you.

1559
01:10:47,223 --> 01:10:48,056
- You too.

1560
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,498
(Michelle exhales)

1561
01:10:57,873 --> 01:11:00,123
(knocking)

1562
01:11:09,085 --> 01:11:10,133
Hello again.

1563
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:11,236
Twice in one day, huh?

1564
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,663
- I don't wanna be too forward,

1565
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,763
but would you like to have dinner with me?

1566
01:11:20,433 --> 01:11:21,426
- Um,

1567
01:11:23,357 --> 01:11:26,326
(laughs) how about if I call you, yeah?

1568
01:11:26,326 --> 01:11:29,853
- Yeah um, yeah, call me
at the police station.

1569
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:30,686
- Okay I will.
- And that way,

1570
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,263
you can call me if anything's going on

1571
01:11:32,263 --> 01:11:33,933
or if you just wanna talk
or, or we can get together.

1572
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:35,036
- Okay.
- Okay.

1573
01:11:36,048 --> 01:11:37,305
I don't have a card.

1574
01:11:37,305 --> 01:11:38,138
Um,

1575
01:11:41,133 --> 01:11:43,796
(laughing)

1576
01:11:43,796 --> 01:11:44,696
do you have a pen?

1577
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:46,733
I don't have a pen.

1578
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:50,993
- Um, sure, hold on
just don't go anywhere.

1579
01:11:50,993 --> 01:11:52,816
I'll be right back, okay?

1580
01:12:06,472 --> 01:12:09,959
(Richards sighs)

1581
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:12,626
(water hissing)

1582
01:12:14,178 --> 01:12:16,678
(Allie spits)

1583
01:12:19,896 --> 01:12:24,896
(sassy jazzy music)
(Rodney breathing hard)

1584
01:12:38,818 --> 01:12:40,353
- Hey,

1585
01:12:40,353 --> 01:12:41,357
Michelle?

1586
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,060
- [Rodney] Who the fuck are you?

1587
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,250
- I'm Detective Burke, hold on, Michelle?

1588
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:47,076
- Sh sh, just hold your voice down, man,

1589
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:49,376
hold your voice down,
all right, listen to me.

1590
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:53,043
I'm Rodney Alexander, okay?

1591
01:12:53,043 --> 01:12:54,413
This is my house.

1592
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:55,246
I've been tied up,

1593
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,343
I've been held as a
hostage here for five days,

1594
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,498
tied to a chair with duct tape--

1595
01:12:58,498 --> 01:12:59,331
- Are you hurt?

1596
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:00,466
- [Rodney] Am I hurt?

1597
01:13:00,466 --> 01:13:01,863
Do I look like I'm all right?

1598
01:13:01,863 --> 01:13:03,712
- All right, sh sh sh.

1599
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,545
Michelle!

1600
01:13:04,545 --> 01:13:05,513
Michelle.
- Sh, sh,

1601
01:13:05,513 --> 01:13:07,993
would you just be quiet
for a second, all right?

1602
01:13:07,993 --> 01:13:09,173
There's one of 'em still in the bedroom.

1603
01:13:09,173 --> 01:13:11,903
- Excuse me sir, relax--
- Oh my God.

1604
01:13:11,903 --> 01:13:13,014
- [Michelle] He needs to get back to bed.

1605
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:16,514
(talking over each other)

1606
01:13:22,193 --> 01:13:23,558
- Wait, this man is obviously hurt.

1607
01:13:23,558 --> 01:13:25,483
Hold on one second

1608
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:26,973
and I'd like to know
what's going on, please.

1609
01:13:26,973 --> 01:13:28,706
- Okay, this man--

1610
01:13:28,706 --> 01:13:30,663
- Oh yeah, I'd like to
hear, what is going on?

1611
01:13:30,663 --> 01:13:34,173
- Drug situation and he's
in a detox program right now

1612
01:13:34,173 --> 01:13:35,361
that we are trying to help him--

1613
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:36,703
(Rodney applauding)
- In spite of that.

1614
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:38,643
- [Rodney] Beautiful, that was
great, that's her turn, okay?

1615
01:13:38,643 --> 01:13:40,093
My turn, thank you.

1616
01:13:40,093 --> 01:13:41,333
I'm Rodney Alexander.

1617
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,166
I live here.

1618
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,733
This is my house, I live here.

1619
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:45,013
My mother lives here.

1620
01:13:45,013 --> 01:13:46,533
Camille Alexander--
- Hold on one second,

1621
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:48,683
do you have any I.D.?
- Do I look like I have I.D.?

1622
01:13:48,683 --> 01:13:49,703
I'm wearing pajamas.

1623
01:13:49,703 --> 01:13:50,613
I can't even move.

1624
01:13:50,613 --> 01:13:51,903
Do you see that fire mantle?

1625
01:13:51,903 --> 01:13:53,113
That's got all of my pictures

1626
01:13:53,113 --> 01:13:54,863
ever since I've been a baby, isn't it?

1627
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,413
Do I look familiar, look.

1628
01:13:56,413 --> 01:13:58,746
And that's my mother.
- All right, so he lives here.

1629
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:03,376
- Rodney.

1630
01:14:07,106 --> 01:14:10,163
- The man is obviously,
as you can see, a little--

1631
01:14:10,163 --> 01:14:11,463
- Okay, in spite of that,

1632
01:14:11,463 --> 01:14:12,843
it's obvious that he's not in good shape

1633
01:14:12,843 --> 01:14:14,003
and I think we should call the hospital

1634
01:14:14,003 --> 01:14:15,669
and take care of him.
- [Rodney] Is it my turn?

1635
01:14:15,669 --> 01:14:16,818
Is it my turn, Detective Simon?

1636
01:14:16,818 --> 01:14:18,266
- Allie, Allie--
- Is it my turn?

1637
01:14:18,266 --> 01:14:19,099
- You have no clothes on--

1638
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:23,349
(everyone talking over each other)

1639
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:42,743
- Rodney and I are
boyfriend and girlfriend.

1640
01:14:43,843 --> 01:14:46,500
He kissed me, he wanted to be with me,

1641
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:51,500
make love to me and what
happened was that um,

1642
01:14:53,983 --> 01:14:55,586
everything got very confused.

1643
01:14:57,883 --> 01:15:01,726
It was a mixed up thing,
but he's my boyfriend

1644
01:15:01,726 --> 01:15:04,956
and he kissed me and we
were gonna make love.

1645
01:15:07,401 --> 01:15:09,636
- If he was your boyfriend,
why'd you tie him up?

1646
01:15:10,603 --> 01:15:12,873
- [Burke] Well he claims
that Michelle beat him

1647
01:15:12,873 --> 01:15:14,826
and then you attacked him sexually.

1648
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,326
- He's nervous.

1649
01:15:18,483 --> 01:15:21,033
- [Richards] He said
you girls kidnapped him.

1650
01:15:21,033 --> 01:15:22,083
- It's not like that.

1651
01:15:23,313 --> 01:15:25,356
- When we walked in, he
was crawling away from you.

1652
01:15:25,356 --> 01:15:27,306
That doesn't sound like you're in love.

1653
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:30,610
- That's because you both came.

1654
01:15:38,154 --> 01:15:40,963
(Richards sighs)

1655
01:15:40,963 --> 01:15:42,483
- [Burke] I wanna know
what brought you here,

1656
01:15:42,483 --> 01:15:45,073
I wanna know why this happened.

1657
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,943
- It doesn't matter, Simon.

1658
01:15:46,943 --> 01:15:47,843
- [Burke] It does matter.

1659
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:48,676
- Why?

1660
01:15:51,103 --> 01:15:52,633
- [Burke] Because that's
the difference between

1661
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:54,653
you spending a long
time in a prison or not.

1662
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:55,843
- But I don't care.

1663
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,713
- [Burke] How can you not care?

1664
01:15:57,713 --> 01:15:58,786
- I just don't care.

1665
01:16:00,913 --> 01:16:02,355
- I mean you have people
saying terrible things--

1666
01:16:02,355 --> 01:16:03,893
- [Michelle] It's a personal
feeling of yours, Simon,

1667
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,260
it doesn't have anything to do with--

1668
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,593
- No, it's not a personal
feeling, it's a matter of,

1669
01:16:07,593 --> 01:16:09,383
I'm frustrated that you
won't help yourself.

1670
01:16:09,383 --> 01:16:10,773
I'm frustrated that
you're allowing yourself

1671
01:16:10,773 --> 01:16:13,083
to go to prison, that you would,

1672
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:14,173
I mean, you're not defending yourself.

1673
01:16:14,173 --> 01:16:17,093
You're not helping me at all.
- Simon, I don't care.

1674
01:16:17,093 --> 01:16:19,826
I'm going to jail, I'm guilty, that's it.

1675
01:16:35,985 --> 01:16:36,985
- All right.

1676
01:16:42,748 --> 01:16:44,213
- Okay.

1677
01:16:44,213 --> 01:16:46,796
(upbeat music)

1678
01:17:12,235 --> 01:17:14,818
(door squeaks)

1679
01:17:17,961 --> 01:17:20,878
(quiet chattering)

1680
01:17:22,644 --> 01:17:24,697
- Rodney!
- Hey!

1681
01:17:24,697 --> 01:17:25,663
- Rodney--
- Hey, fuck you,

1682
01:17:25,663 --> 01:17:27,253
get away from me, just
back off, all right?

1683
01:17:27,253 --> 01:17:29,863
All right, give her some
Prozac or something.

1684
01:17:29,863 --> 01:17:31,033
What's the matter with
you, you're my attorney,

1685
01:17:31,033 --> 01:17:31,904
you're supposed to protect me.

1686
01:17:31,904 --> 01:17:33,463
- Rodney?
- The woman's five feet tall,

1687
01:17:33,463 --> 01:17:34,296
can't you keep her off me?

1688
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:37,883
- Rodney, will you come visit,
I'll be waiting for you!

1689
01:17:37,883 --> 01:17:39,669
- [Rodney] Sure will.

1690
01:17:39,669 --> 01:17:41,843
- I'll be waiting!

1691
01:17:41,843 --> 01:17:46,843
- I've known Mrs. Alexander
for about 13 years.

1692
01:17:47,073 --> 01:17:49,233
I knew her son from the
time he was a little boy,

1693
01:17:49,233 --> 01:17:51,123
she used to bring him in when, you know,

1694
01:17:51,123 --> 01:17:52,633
he was, I think about, I don't know,

1695
01:17:52,633 --> 01:17:57,413
maybe 15, 16 years old and
he was a good looking boy,

1696
01:17:57,413 --> 01:18:01,236
but he's you know, he
was damaged in the shop.

1697
01:18:02,363 --> 01:18:04,313
- The house is okay.

1698
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,903
I mean, it needs some repairs and

1699
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,883
I don't know, I'm just not,

1700
01:18:09,883 --> 01:18:11,987
I'm very nervous to tell you the truth.

1701
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,523
I just wanna move.

1702
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:15,533
I wanna go somewhere, I
don't know where I wanna go,

1703
01:18:15,533 --> 01:18:16,366
maybe to an island.

1704
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:19,763
Maybe I'll go back to Las Brisas. (laughs)

1705
01:18:21,191 --> 01:18:22,893
- Well--
- Well. (laughs)

1706
01:18:22,893 --> 01:18:23,926
Should we tell 'em?

1707
01:18:23,926 --> 01:18:26,033
(laughing)

1708
01:18:26,033 --> 01:18:26,973
- Oh.

1709
01:18:26,973 --> 01:18:29,203
- Well, we are really compatible.

1710
01:18:29,203 --> 01:18:30,036
- We are.
- And um--

1711
01:18:30,036 --> 01:18:31,463
- You know, I introduced them,

1712
01:18:31,463 --> 01:18:35,539
but I knew, I knew, if I hadn't
been involved at the time,

1713
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:37,623
it would have been us,
it would have been us.

1714
01:18:37,623 --> 01:18:39,423
- We share so many things in common.

1715
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,043
We love to do a lot of things together.

1716
01:18:41,043 --> 01:18:42,813
We love to do a lot of
the same things too.

1717
01:18:42,813 --> 01:18:45,353
For example, this tomato here,

1718
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:47,113
we grew this in our garden.

1719
01:18:47,113 --> 01:18:47,946
- Yeah.
- We both like

1720
01:18:47,946 --> 01:18:49,363
organic gardening and uh,

1721
01:18:49,363 --> 01:18:52,163
and for me to find out that
she liked to grow tomatoes too

1722
01:18:52,163 --> 01:18:53,593
was an extraordinary--
- cucumbers.

1723
01:18:53,593 --> 01:18:54,426
You should see our refrigerator,

1724
01:18:54,426 --> 01:18:56,303
just full of these cucumbers,

1725
01:18:56,303 --> 01:18:57,433
like--
- If you want a salad

1726
01:18:57,433 --> 01:19:00,849
or anything, we can make
one up for you. (laughing)

1727
01:19:03,063 --> 01:19:06,876
- I can tell that you are calm
because you're not a biter.

1728
01:19:07,933 --> 01:19:09,823
I can tell that you're neat

1729
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,866
because your cuticle is nice and round.

1730
01:19:13,413 --> 01:19:16,358
I can tell that you are soft

1731
01:19:16,358 --> 01:19:18,833
because you let your skin be smooth

1732
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,785
and I can tell when I
do the wrist rotation

1733
01:19:21,785 --> 01:19:22,618
if you're relaxed or not.

1734
01:19:22,618 --> 01:19:25,083
- [Michelle] So you see,
everything worked out just fine.

1735
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:27,273
Allie got her manicuring salon

1736
01:19:27,273 --> 01:19:30,063
and I'm just happy hanging
out and taking her bookings.

1737
01:19:30,063 --> 01:19:32,573
We got quite a business going here.

1738
01:19:32,573 --> 01:19:35,283
Allie still writes to Rodney,
but he never writes back.

1739
01:19:35,283 --> 01:19:36,763
Surprise.

1740
01:19:36,763 --> 01:19:37,803
