1
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,595
We're under attack!
Light the signal!

2
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,190
Now all of China
knows you're here.

3
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,915
Perfect.

4
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,431
Your Majesty, the Huns
have crossed our northern border.

5
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,030
Impossible. No one
can get through the Great Wall.

6
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,116
Shan-Yu is leading them.

7
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,553
We'll set up defences
around your palace immediately.

8
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,468
No. Send your troops
to protect my people.

9
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,431
- Chi Fu.
- Yes, Your Highness?

10
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,711
Deliver conscription notices
throughout all the provinces.

11
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,150
Call up reserves and
as many new recruits as possible.

12
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,193
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but I believe my troops can stop him.

13
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,515
I won't take
any chances, General.

14
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,313
A single grain of rice
can tip the scale.

15
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,319
One man may be the difference
between victory and defeat.

16
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,039
"Quiet and demure.

17
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,836
"Graceful. Polite. Delicate.

18
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,758
"Refilned. Poised.

19
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,153
Punctual."

20
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,395
Ai-yah!
Little Brother!

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,877
Little Brother. Lit...

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,912
Ah! There you are.

23
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,589
Who's the smartest doggy in
the world? Come on, smart boy.

24
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,756
Can you help me
with my chores today?

25
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,118
Honourable ancestors...

26
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,358
please help Mulan
impress the Matchmaker today.

27
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,716
Please.

28
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,718
Please help her.

29
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,268
- Father, I brought your... Whoa!
- Mulan.

30
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,628
- I brought a spare.
- Mulan...

31
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,910
Remember, the doctor said
three cups of tea in the morning...

32
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,712
- Mulan.
- and three at night.

33
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,833
Mulan, you should already be in town.
We are counting on you to...

34
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,474
To uphold the family honour.

35
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,797
Don't worry, Father.
I won't let you down.

36
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,559
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

37
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,469
I'm going to
pray some more.

38
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,875
Fa Li, is your daughter
here yet?

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,072
The Matchmaker
is not a patient woman.

40
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,796
Of all days to be late... I should
have prayed to the ancestors for luck.

41
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,912
How lucky can they be?
They're dead.

42
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,794
Besides, I've got
all the luck we'll need.

43
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,480
This is your chance
to prove yourself.

44
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,316
Grandma, no!

45
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,437
Yep, this cricket's
a lucky one!

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,830
I'm here.

47
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,394
What? But, Mama,
I had to...

48
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,195
None of your excuses.
Now, let's get you cleaned up.

49
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,476
This is what you give me
to work with

50
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,672
Well, honey
I've seen worse

51
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,031
We're gonna turn
this sow's ear

52
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,958
- Into a silk purse
- It's freezing.

53
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,390
It would have been warm
if you were here on time.

54
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,114
We'll have you
washed and dried

55
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,708
Primped and polished
till you glow with pride

56
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,434
Trust my recipe
for instant bride

57
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,994
You'll bring honour
to us all

58
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,032
- Mulan, what's this?
- Uh, notes...

59
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,957
in case
I forget something.

60
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,152
Hold this. We'll need
more luck than I thought.

61
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,192
Wait and see
when we're through

62
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,880
Boys will gladly
go to war for you

63
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,639
- With good fortune
- And a great hairdo

64
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,594
You'll bring honour
to us all

65
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,950
A girl can bring
her family

66
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,878
Great honour in one way

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,673
By striking
a good match

68
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,758
And this could be
the day

69
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,997
- Men want girls with good taste
- Calm.

70
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,111
- Obedient.
- Who work fast-paced

71
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,993
- With good breeding
- And a tiny waist

72
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,908
You'll bring honour
to us all

73
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,429
We all must serve
our emperor

74
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,199
Who guards us
from the Huns

75
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,959
A man by bearing arms

76
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,038
A girl by bearing sons

77
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,754
- When we're through you can't fail
- When we're through

78
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,519
- Like a lotus blossom, soft and pale
- You can't fail, like a lotus blossom
- When we're through, you can't fail

79
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,313
- How could any fellow say no sale
- Soft and pale, how could any fellow
- Like a lotus blossom, soft and pale

80
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,635
- You'll bring honour to us all
- Say no sale, you'll bring honour
- How could any fellow say no sale

81
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,356
- To us all
- You'll bring honour to us all

82
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,277
There. You're ready.

83
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,870
Not yet.
An apple for serenity.

84
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,434
A pendant for balance.

85
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,994
Beads ofjade

86
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,634
For beauty

87
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,433
You must proudly

88
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,790
Show it

89
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,957
Now add a cricket

90
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,389
just for luck

91
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,512
And even you can't blow it

92
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,154
Ancestors, hear my plea

93
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,999
Help me not to make a fool of me

94
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,714
And to not uproot my family tree

95
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,799
Keep my father standing tall

96
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,639
Scarier than the undertaker

97
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,354
We are meeting our Matchmaker

98
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,074
Destiny
Guard our girls

99
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,873
And our future
as it fast unfurls

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,594
Please look kindly
on these cultured pearls

101
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,599
Each a perfect
porcelain doll

102
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,393
- Please bring honour to us
- Please bring honour to us

103
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,159
- Please bring honour to us
- Please bring honour to us

104
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,116
Please bring honour
to us all

105
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,680
- "Fa Mulan."
- Present!

106
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,870
Speaking without permission.

107
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,039
- Oops.
- Who spit in her bean curd?

108
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,070
Mmm. Too skinny.

109
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,318
Hmph! Not good
for bearing sons.

110
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,594
Recite the filnal admonition.

111
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,632
Well?

112
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,629
Fulfill your duties
calmly and respectfully.

113
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,196
Um, reflect before you snack...

114
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,914
Act! This shall bring you
honour and glory.

115
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,474
Hmm. This way.

116
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,552
Now, pour the tea.

117
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,911
To please
your future in-laws...

118
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,715
you must demonstrate
a sense of dignity...

119
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,479
and refilnement.

120
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,989
You must also be poised.

121
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,911
- Um, pardon me.
- And silent!

122
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,879
Could I just
take that back for a moment?

123
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,916
Why, you clumsy...

124
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,910
I think it's going well,
don't you?

125
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,191
Put it out! Put it out!
Put it out!

126
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,750
You are a disgrace!

127
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,757
You may look like a bride...

128
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,510
but you will never
bring your family honour!

129
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,796
Look at me

130
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,229
I will never pass

131
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,113
For a perfect bride

132
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,595
Or a perfect daughter

133
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,836
Can it be

134
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,988
I'm not meant
to play this part

135
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,350
Now I see

136
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,508
That if I were truly
to be myself

137
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,952
I would break
my family's heart

138
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,434
Who is that girl I see

139
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,835
Staring straight

140
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,155
Back at me

141
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,034
Why is my reflection

142
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,152
Someone I

143
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,556
Don't know

144
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,879
Somehow I cannot hide

145
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,877
Who I am

146
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,434
Though I've tried

147
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,429
When will
my reflection show

148
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,710
Who I am

149
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,118
Inside

150
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,112
When will
my reflection show

151
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,073
Who I am

152
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,636
Inside

153
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,509
My, my.

154
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,350
What beautiful blossoms
we have this year.

155
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,870
But, look,
this one's late.

156
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,197
But I'll bet that
when it blooms...

157
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,472
it will be
the most beautiful of all.

158
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,989
What is it?

159
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,077
Mulan, stay inside.

160
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,234
Citizens, I bring
a proclamation...

161
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,351
from the lmperial City.

162
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,517
The Huns have invaded China.

163
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,676
By order of the emperor...

164
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,316
one man from every family
must serve in the lmperial Army.

165
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,989
The Hsiao family.

166
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,156
The Yi family.

167
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,272
I will serve the emperor
in my father's place.

168
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,392
- The Fa family.
- No!

169
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,071
I am ready to serve
the emperor.

170
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,031
- Father, you can't go.
- Mulan!

171
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,515
Please, sir, my father
has already fought bravely...

172
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,437
Silence!
You would do well...

173
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,997
to teach your daughter to hold
her tongue in a man's presence.

174
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,918
Mulan, you dishonour me.

175
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,231
Report tomorrow
to the Wu Zhong camp.

176
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,430
Yes, sir.

177
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,955
The Chu family!

178
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,469
The Wen family!

179
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,469
The Chang family!

180
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,151
- You shouldn't have to go!
- Mulan...

181
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,350
There are plenty of young men
to filght for China.

182
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,393
It is an honour to protect
my country and my family.

183
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,317
So, you'll die for honour.

184
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,034
- I will die doing what's right.
- But if you...

185
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,948
I know my place!
It is time you learned yours.

186
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,590
- Mulan is gone!
- What?

187
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,150
It can't be.

188
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,350
Mulan!

189
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,991
No.

190
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,396
You must go after her.
She could be killed.

191
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,909
If I reveal her...

192
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,270
she will be.

193
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,430
Ancestors, hear our prayer.

194
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,834
Watch over Mulan.

195
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,754
Mushu, awaken.

196
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,996
I live!

197
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,112
So tell me what mortal needs
my protection, Great Ancestor.

198
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,196
- You just say the word and I'm there.
- Mushu...

199
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,550
And let me say somethin'.
Anybody who's foolish enough...

200
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,877
to threaten our family,
vengeance will be mine!

201
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,359
Mushu!
These are the family guardians.

202
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,870
- They...
- Protect the family.

203
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,037
And you, O Demoted One?

204
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,232
I ring the gong.

205
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,514
That's right.
Now, wake up the ancestors.

206
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,313
One family reunion
comin' right up.

207
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,590
Okay, people, people, look alive.
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

208
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,918
Let's move it. Rise and shine. Y'all way
past the beauty sleep thing, trust me.

209
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,592
I knew it. I knew it. That Mulan
was a troublemaker from the start!

210
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,188
Don't look at me. She gets it
from your side of the family.

211
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,470
She's just trying
to help her father.

212
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,989
But if she's discovered,
Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.

213
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,430
Dishonour will come to the family.
Traditional values will disintegrate.

214
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,198
Not to mention,
they'll lose the farm.

215
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,949
My children never caused such trouble.
They all became acupuncturists.

216
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,833
- Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.
- No!

217
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,032
Your great-granddaughter
had to be a cross-dresser!

218
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,075
- Let a guardian bring her back.
- Yes, awaken the most cunning.

219
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,997
No. The swiftest.

220
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,839
- No. Send the wisest.
- Silence!

221
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,999
We must send
the most powerful of all.

222
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,908
Okay, okay, I get
the drift. I'll go.

223
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,995
Oh, y'all don't think
I can do it. Watch this here.

224
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,395
Aha! Jump back.
I'm pretty hot, huh?

225
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,431
Don't make me have to singe
nobody to prove no point.

226
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,074
You had your chance
to protect the Fa family.

227
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,760
Your misguidance led
Fa Deng to disaster.

228
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,599
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- And your point is?

229
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,349
The point is we will be
sending a real dragon...

230
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,391
to retrieve Mulan.

231
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,238
What... What...
I'm a real dragon!

232
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,878
You are not worthy of this spot.
Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon.

233
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,152
So you'll get back to me
on the job thing?

234
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,115
Just one chance,
is that too much to ask?

235
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,913
I mean, it's not like
it'll kill ya.

236
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,873
Yo, Rocky, wake up!
Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!

237
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,759
Come on, boy!
Go get her! Go on!

238
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,677
Come on.

239
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,276
Hello? Hello!

240
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,231
Hello!

241
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,470
Uh, Stony?

242
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,353
Stony? Oh, man,
they're gonna kill me.

243
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,914
Great Stone Dragon...

244
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,112
have you awakened?

245
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,800
Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Yes, I just woke up.

246
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,277
I'm... I'm the Great Stone Dragon.
Good morning.

247
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,960
I will go forth
and fetch Mulan.

248
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,514
Did... Did I mention that
I was the Great Stone Dragon?

249
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,598
Go! The fate
of the Fa family...

250
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,995
rests in your claws.

251
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,476
Don't even worry about it.
I will not lose face.

252
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,110
Oh, my elbow. Oh, oh.
I know I twisted something.

253
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,038
That's just great.
Now what? I'm doomed!

254
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,073
And all 'cause Miss Man decides to take
her little drag show on the road.

255
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,308
Go get her?
What's the matter with you?

256
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,237
After this Great Stone
Humpty-Dumpty mess...

257
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,830
I'd have to bring her home
with a medal to get back in the temple.

258
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,394
Wait a minute. That's it!
I make Mulan a war hero...

259
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,476
and they'll be begging me
to come back to work.

260
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,398
That's the master plan.
Aw, you done it now, man.

261
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,157
Hey, what makes you
think you're comin'?

262
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,271
You're lucky?

263
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,630
Do I look like a sucker to you?

264
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,514
What you mean, a loser? How 'bout
if I pop one of your antennas off,
and throw it across the yard?

265
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,631
Then who's the loser,
me or you?

266
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,919
Imperial scouts.

267
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,914
Shan-Yu.

268
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,273
Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun Army.

269
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,596
The emperor will stop you.

270
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,030
Stop me? He invited me.

271
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,435
By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.

272
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,630
Well, I'm here
to play his game.

273
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,315
Go! Tell your emperor
to send his strongest armies.

274
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,590
I'm ready.

275
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,074
How many men does it take
to deliver a message?

276
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,428
One.

277
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,795
Okay, okay,
how about this?

278
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,071
Excuse me.
Where do I sign in?

279
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,909
Ha, I see you have a sword.
I have one too.

280
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,349
They're very manly
and tough.

281
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,031
I'm working on it!

282
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,357
Oh, who am I fooling?

283
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,074
It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.

284
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,873
Did I hear someone ask
for a miracle?

285
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,309
- Let me hear you say "aaah"!
- Aaah!

286
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,510
- That's close enough.
- A ghost.

287
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,712
Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand!

288
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,752
For I have been sent
by your ancestors...

289
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,474
to guide you through
your masquerade.

290
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,556
Come on. If you're gonna stay,
you're gonna work.

291
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,798
So heed my word! 'Cause if the army
filnds out you're a girl...

292
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,071
the penalty is death!

293
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,079
- Who are you?
- Who am I? Who am I?

294
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,953
I am the guardian
of lost souls.

295
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,992
I am the powerful,
the pleasurable...

296
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,429
the indestructible Mushu.

297
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,715
Oh. Ha, ha.
Pretty hot, huh?

298
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,993
Uh, my ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?

299
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,112
Hey, dragon, dragon,
not lizard.

300
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,357
I don't do that tongue thing.

301
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,550
- You're, um...
- Intimidating?

302
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,750
- Awe-inspiring?
- Tiny.

303
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,110
Of course. I'm travel-size
for your convenience.

304
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,949
If I was my real size,
your cow here would die of fright.

305
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,993
Down, Bessie. My powers are beyond
your mortal imagination.

306
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,432
For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armour. Oooh!

307
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,112
All right, that's it! Dishonour!
Dishonour on your whole family.

308
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,994
Make a note of this. Dishonour on you,
dishonour on your cow, dis...

309
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,032
Stop. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

310
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,435
I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.

311
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,836
Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't you slap me no more.

312
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,155
We clear on that?
All right.

313
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,192
Okey-dokey. Let's get this show
on the road! Cri-Kee, get the bags.

314
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,993
Let's move it, heifer.

315
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,880
Okay, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.

316
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,516
Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.

317
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,428
Two, three... Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!

318
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,508
- Beautiful, isn't he?
- They're disgusting.

319
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,474
No, they're men. Now, you gonna have
to act just like them, so pay attention.

320
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,354
Look. This tattoo
will protect me from harm.

321
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,390
I hope you can
get your money back.

322
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,317
I don't think
I can do this.

323
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,159
It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.

324
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,873
- What are you lookin' at?
- Punch him. It's how men say hello.

325
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,709
Oh, Yao,
you've made a friend.

326
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,115
Good. Now slap him on the behind.
They like that.

327
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,354
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

328
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,597
Yao, relax
and chant with me.

329
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,598
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

330
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,837
Ahh, you ain't
worth my time, chicken boy.

331
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,077
Chicken boy? Say that
to my face, ya limp noodle!

332
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,350
Oh. Sorry, Ling.

333
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,710
Hey!

334
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,115
Whoa! You're dead!

335
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,391
Oh, there he goes!

336
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,397
Hey, guys.

337
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,830
The Huns have struck here,
here and here.

338
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,428
I will take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass...

339
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,075
and stop Shan-Yu
before he destroys this village.

340
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,509
Excellent strategy, sir.

341
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,553
I do love surprises.

342
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,274
You will stay and train
the new recruits.

343
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,391
When Chi Fu believes
you're ready...

344
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,318
you will join us, Captain.

345
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,032
Captain?

346
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,993
This is an enormous
responsibility, General.

347
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,236
Uh, perhaps a soldier
with more experience...

348
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,672
Number one in his class, extensive
knowledge of training techniques...

349
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,360
an impressive
military lineage.

350
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,550
I believe Li Shang
will do an excellent job.

351
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,470
Oh, I will. I won't let you down.
This is... I mean...

352
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,670
- Yes, sir.
- Very good, then.

353
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,395
We'll toast China's victory
at the lmperial City.

354
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,717
I'll expect a full report
in three weeks.

355
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,832
And I won't leave
anything out.

356
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,156
Captain Li Shang.

357
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,873
Leader of China's
filnest troops.

358
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,356
No. The greatest troops
of all time.

359
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,230
Most impressive.

360
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,790
Good luck, Captain. Hyah!

361
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,759
Good luck, Father.

362
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,314
Day one.

363
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,352
Soldiers!

364
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,516
He started it!

365
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,994
I don't need anyone
causing trouble in my camp.

366
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,156
Sorry. Uh...

367
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,034
I mean, uh, sorry you had to see that,
but you know how it is...

368
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,109
when you get those manly urges
and you just gotta kill somethin'...

369
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,708
filx things, cook outdoors...

370
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,230
- What's your name?
- Uh... l, l, uh...

371
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,955
Your commanding offilcer
just asked you a question.

372
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,710
Uh, I've got a name.
Ha! And it's a boy's name too.

373
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,910
- Ling. How 'bout Ling?
- His name is Ling.

374
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,838
I didn't ask for his name.
I asked for yours!

375
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,554
- Try, uh, uh, ah, Chu.
- Ah Chu.

376
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,036
- Ah Chu?
- Gesundheit. Ha, ha. I kill myself.

377
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,559
- Mushu.
- Mushu?

378
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,159
- No.
- Then what is it?

379
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,999
- Ping was my best friend growin' up.
- It's Ping.

380
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,271
- Ping?
- Of course, Ping did steal my...

381
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,550
Yes, my name is Ping.

382
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,797
Let me see your
conscription notice.

383
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,879
- Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?
- I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

384
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,356
Um, he-he doesn't talk
about me much.

385
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,389
I can see why.
The boy's an absolute lunatic.

386
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,717
Okay, gentlemen,
thanks to your new friend, Ping...

387
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,118
you'll spend tonight picking up
every single grain of rice.

388
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,437
And tomorrow,
the real work begins.

389
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,354
You know, we have to work
on your people skills.

390
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,676
All right! Rise and shine,
Sleeping Beauty.

391
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,916
Come on. Hup, hup, hup.

392
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,791
Get your clothes on. Get ready.
Got breakfast for ya.

393
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,277
Look, you get porridge,
and it's happy to see you.

394
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,868
Hey, get outta there!
You gonna make people sick.

395
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,797
- Am I late?
- No time to talk. Now remember, it's...

396
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,514
your filrst day of trainin', so listen
to your teacher and no filghtin'...

397
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,437
play nice with the other kids, unless,
of course, one of the other kids...

398
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,676
wanna filght, then you have to
kick the other kid's butt.

399
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,870
But I don't wanna kick
the other kid's butt.

400
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,788
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Now let's see your war face.

401
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,115
Oh, I think my bunny slippers
just ran for cover.

402
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,754
Come on! Scare me, girl.

403
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,838
Yeah, that's my tough-lookin' warrior.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

404
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,474
Now, get out there
and make me proud.

405
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,236
- What do you mean, the troops just left?
- They what?

406
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,035
Wait!
You forgot your sword.

407
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,713
My little baby,
off to destroy people.

408
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,390
Order. People, order.

409
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,398
- I'd like a pan-fried noodle.
- Oh, oh! Sweet and pungent shrimp.

410
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,988
- Moo goo gai pan.
- That's not funny.

411
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,278
Looks like our new friend
slept in this morning.

412
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,676
Hello, Ping.
Are ya hungry?

413
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,157
Yeah, 'cause I owe you
a knuckle sandwich.

414
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,113
Soldiers!

415
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,910
You will assemble swiftly
and silently every morning.

416
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,552
Anyone who acts otherwise
will answer to me.

417
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,478
Ooh. Tough guy.

418
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,591
Yao.

419
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,436
Thank you for volunteering.
Retrieve the arrow.

420
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,479
I'll get that arrow,
pretty boy...

421
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,717
and I'll do it
with my shirt on.

422
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,271
One moment. You seem
to be missing something.

423
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,034
This represents discipline...

424
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,751
and this represents strength.

425
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,155
You need both to reach the arrow.

426
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,989
We've got a long way to go.

427
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,990
Let's get down to business

428
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,432
To defeat the Huns

429
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,916
Did they send me daughters

430
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,828
When I asked for sons

431
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,794
You're the saddest bunch
I ever met

432
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,708
But you can bet
before we're through

433
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,549
Mister, I'll make a man

434
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,274
Out of you

435
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,117
Tranquil as a forest

436
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,870
But on fire within

437
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,151
Once you find your centre

438
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,398
You are sure to win

439
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,229
You're a spineless
pale, pathetic lot

440
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,830
And you haven't got a clue

441
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,112
Somehow I'll make a man

442
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,879
Out of you

443
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,989
- I'm never gonna catch my breath
- Say goodbye to those who knew me

444
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,272
Boy, was I a fool
in school for cutting gym

445
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,197
This guy's got 'em
scared to death

446
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,117
Hope he doesn't see
right through me

447
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,152
Now I really wish
that I knew how to swim

448
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,353
- Be a man
- You must be swift as a coursing river

449
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,473
- Be a man
- With all the force of a great typhoon

450
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,276
- Be a man
- With all the strength of a raging fire

451
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,949
Mysterious as the dark side of

452
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,676
The moon

453
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,076
Time is racing toward us

454
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,830
Till the Huns arrive

455
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,157
Heed my every order

456
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,193
And you might survive

457
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,199
You're unsuited for
the rage of war

458
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,108
So pack up, go home
You're through

459
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,835
How could I make a man

460
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,159
- Out of you
- Be a man

461
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,273
- You must be swift as a coursing river
- Be a man

462
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,279
- With all the force of a great typhoon
- Be a man

463
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,676
With all the strength
of a raging fire

464
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,475
Mysterious as
the dark side of

465
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,310
- The moon
- Be a man

466
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,433
- We must be swift as a coursing river
- Be a man

467
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,553
- With all the force of a great typhoon
- Be a man

468
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,036
With all the strength
of a raging fire

469
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,869
Mysterious as
the dark side of

470
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,991
The moon

471
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,714
What do you see?

472
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,310
Black pine,
from the high mountains.

473
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,791
White horse hair.
Imperial stallions.

474
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,150
Sulphur, from cannons.

475
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,829
This doll came from a village
in the Tung Shao Pass...

476
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,155
where the lmperial Army
is waiting for us.

477
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,272
We can avoid them easily.

478
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,473
No. The quickest way
to the emperor is through that pass.

479
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,676
And besides, the little girl
will be missing her doll.

480
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,870
We should return it to her.

481
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,675
Hey, no, this is not a good idea.
What if somebody sees you?

482
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,837
Just because I look like a man
doesn't mean I have to smell like one.

483
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,999
So a couple of guys don't rinse out
their socks. Picky, picky, picky.

484
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,839
Well, myself, I kind of
like that corn chip smell.

485
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,070
Okay, all right, all right.
That's enough. Now, come on, get out
before you get all pruny and stuff.

486
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,590
Mushu, if you're so worried,
go stand watch.

487
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,676
Yeah, yeah.
"Stand watch, Mushu...

488
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,553
while I blow our secret
with my stupid girlie habits."

489
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,672
Pfft! Hygiene!

490
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,837
- Me filrst! Me filrst!
- Oh!

491
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,838
We're doomed! There are a couple of
things I know they're bound to notice!

492
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,476
Hey, Ping!

493
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,990
Oh, hi, guys.
I didn't know you were here.

494
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,918
I was just washing. So now I'm clean,
and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.

495
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,874
Come back here.
I know we were jerks to you before...

496
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,230
so let's start over.

497
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,272
Hi. I'm Ling.

498
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,710
- And I'm Chien-Po.
- Hello, Chien-Po.

499
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,912
And I am Yao!

500
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,837
King of the rock!

501
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,157
And there's nothin'
you girls can do about it.

502
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,636
Oh, yeah? Well, I think
Ping and I can take you.

503
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,957
- I really don't wanna take him anywhere.
- Ping, we have to filght!

504
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,958
No, we don't.
Uh, we, uh, could just...

505
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,719
close our eyes and swim around.

506
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,637
Come on.
Don't be such a gir...

507
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,718
Ouch! Something bit me!

508
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,956
- What a nasty flavour.
- Snake!

509
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,875
- Snake! Ooh, ooh!
- Ah, poison!

510
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,594
Oooh, snake! Snake!

511
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,952
- Snake! Snake!
- Help! Help!

512
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,117
Some king of the rock.
Aaah!

513
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,279
- Boy, that was close.
- No, that was vile.

514
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,233
You owe me big.

515
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,272
I never want to see
a naked man again.

516
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,390
Hey, don't look at me.
I ain't bitin' no more butts.

517
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,909
You think your troops
are ready to filght?

518
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,589
Ha! They would not
last a minute against the Huns!

519
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,678
- They completed their training.
- Those boys...

520
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,475
are no more filt to be soldiers
than you are to be captain.

521
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,989
Once the general
reads my report...

522
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,634
your troops
will never see battle.

523
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,389
Oh, no, you don't! I've worked
too hard to get Mulan into this war.

524
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,715
This guy's messin'
with my plan.

525
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,559
- We're not filnished!
- Be careful, Captain.

526
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,196
The general may be your father,
but I am the emperor's counsel.

527
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,950
And, oh, by the way,
I got that job on my own.

528
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,674
You're dismissed.

529
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,590
Hey. I'll hold him
and you punch.

530
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,393
Or not.

531
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,069
For what it's worth,
I think you're a great captain.

532
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,310
- I saw that.
- What?

533
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,228
- You like him, don't you?
- No! l...

534
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,920
Yeah, all right. Yeah, sure.
Go to your tent!

535
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,513
I think it's time we took
this war into our own hands.

536
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,637
Okay, let me see what you got.
"From General Li.

537
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,557
"Dear Son, we're
waiting for Huns at the pass.

538
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,910
It would mean a lot
if you'd come and back us up."

539
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,998
Hmm. That's great, except you forgot,
"And since we're out of potpourri...

540
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,917
perhaps you wouldn't mind
bringing up some."

541
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,191
Hello! This is the army!
Make it sound more urgent, please!

542
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,276
You know what
I'm talkin' about?

543
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,552
That's better.
Much better. Let's go.

544
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,672
Khanny, baby.
Hey, we need a ride.

545
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,474
Insubordinate ruffilans!

546
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,070
You men owe me
a new pair of slippers!

547
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,273
And I do not squeal
like a girl.

548
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,789
Urgent news
from the general.

549
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,393
What's the matter? You've never
seen a black-and-white before?

550
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,796
Who are you?

551
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,310
Excuse me? I think
the question is, who are you?

552
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,432
We're in a war, man! There's
no time for stupid questions!

553
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,677
I should have your hat for that.
Snatch it right off your head.

554
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,792
But I'm feeling gracious today,
so carry on before I report you.

555
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,955
Captain, urgent news from the general!
We're needed at the front.

556
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,556
Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.
We're movin' out.

557
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,275
For a long time
we've been marching off to battle

558
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:51,319
In our thundering herd
we feel a lot like cattle

559
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,000
Like a pounding beat
our aching feet

560
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,509
Aren't easy to ignore

561
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,437
Hey!
Think of instead

562
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,599
A girl worth fighting for

563
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,676
- Huh?
- That's what I said.

564
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,633
A girl worth fighting for

565
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,718
I want her paler
than the moon

566
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,070
With eyes that shine
like stars

567
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,953
My girl will marvel
at my strength

568
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,594
Adore my battle scars

569
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,510
I couldn't care less what she'll wear
or what she looks like

570
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,438
It all depends on
what she cooks like

571
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,757
Beef, pork, chicken
Mmm

572
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,794
Bet the local girls
thought you were quite the charmer

573
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,870
And I'll bet the ladies
love a man in armour

574
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,833
You can guess what
we have missed the most

575
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,269
Since we went off to war

576
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,632
- What do we want
- A girl worth fighting for

577
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,718
My girl will think
I have no faults

578
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,308
That I'm a major find

579
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,228
Uh, how 'bout a girl
who's got a brain

580
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,069
- Who always speaks her mind
- Nah!

581
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,634
My manly ways
and turn of phrase

582
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,228
Are sure to thrill her

583
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,591
He thinks he's
such a lady-killer

584
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,354
I've a girl back home
who's unlike any other

585
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,870
Yeah, the only girl
who'd love him is his mother

586
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,068
But when we come home
in victory

587
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,953
They'll line up at the door

588
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,949
- What do we want
- A girl worth fighting for

589
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,039
- Wish that I had
- A girl worth fighting for

590
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,437
A girl worth fighting

591
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,755
Search for survivors.

592
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,997
I don't understand.
My father should've been here.

593
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,588
Captain!

594
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,637
The general.

595
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,037
I'm sorry.

596
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,717
The Huns
are moving quickly.

597
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,833
We'll make better time to the lmperial
City through the Tung Shao Pass.

598
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,155
We're the only hope
for the emperor now.

599
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,157
Move out!

600
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,479
- What happened?
- Um...

601
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,636
You just gave away
our position! Now we're...

602
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,597
Get out of range!

603
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,230
- Save the cannons!
- Come on!

604
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,477
Empty it! Empty it!

605
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,797
Hey!

606
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,798
Oh, sure.
Save the horse.

607
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,036
Fire!

608
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,232
Fire!

609
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,788
Hold the last cannon.

610
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,555
Prepare to filght.
If we die, we die with honour.

611
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,508
Yao, aim the cannon
at Shan-Yu.

612
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,036
- Hey!
- Ping! Come back!

613
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,230
Ping!

614
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,191
Stop!

615
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,435
All right. You might want
to light that right about now.

616
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,869
Quickly. Quickly!

617
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,311
Come on!
We gotta help!

618
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,357
You missed!
How could you miss?

619
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,358
He was three feet
in front of you!

620
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,311
Mulan!

621
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,717
Mulan!

622
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,637
Mulan?

623
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,557
No.

624
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,035
Mulan!

625
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,152
Man, you are
one lucky bug.

626
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,551
Shang!

627
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,996
- Do you see them?
- Yes.

628
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,033
Perfect. Now we'll
pull them to safety.

629
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,193
Hey, Mulan!
I found the lucky cricket!

630
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,231
We need help.

631
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,756
Ooh, nice. Very nice.
You can sit by me.

632
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,718
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
We are defilnitely gonna die.

633
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,274
No way we survive this.
Death is coming!

634
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,512
I let them slip
through my filngers.

635
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,877
Pull!

636
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,831
Whoa!

637
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,912
Oh, I knew we could do it.
You the man!

638
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,837
Well, sort of.

639
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,553
Step back, guys.
Give him some air.

640
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,716
Ping?

641
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,638
You are the craziest man
I've ever met.

642
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,514
And for that,
I owe you my life.

643
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,791
From now on,
you have my trust.

644
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,390
Let's hear it for Ping!
The bravest of us all!

645
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,956
- You're king of the mountain!
- Yes, yes, yes!

646
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,476
Ping! What's wrong?

647
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,558
He's wounded! Get help!

648
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,593
Ping, hold on.

649
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,517
Hold on.

650
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,475
I can explain.

651
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,477
So it's true!

652
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,068
Shang!

653
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,078
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

654
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,794
A woman!

655
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,195
Treacherous snake!

656
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,754
My name is Mulan.

657
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,871
I did it
to save my father.

658
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,719
- High treason!
- I didn't mean for it to go this far.

659
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,637
Ultimate dishonour!

660
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,629
It was the only way.
Please believe me.

661
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,796
Captain?

662
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,635
Restrain him!

663
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,673
- No!
- You know the law.

664
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,039
A life for a life.
My debt is repaid.

665
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,196
- Move out!
- Uh, uh... But you can't just...

666
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,118
I said, "Move out."

667
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,357
I was this close.

668
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,392
This close
to impressin' the ancestors...

669
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,159
gettin' the top shelf,
an entourage.

670
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,750
Man. All my filne work.
Pfft.

671
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,194
- Hi.
- I should never have left home.

672
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,437
Hey, come on. You went
to save your father's life.

673
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,915
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him
and disgracing your ancestors...

674
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,634
and losin' all your friends?

675
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,877
You know, you just gotta...
You gotta learn to let these things go.

676
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,912
Maybe I didn't go
for my father.

677
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:14,160
Maybe what I really wanted was
to prove I could do things right...

678
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,794
so when I looked
in the mirror...

679
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,354
I'd see someone worthwhile.

680
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,874
But I was wrong.

681
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,877
I see nothing.

682
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,357
Now, that's just 'cause this needs
a little spit, that's all.

683
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,869
Let me shine this up for ya.

684
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,912
I can see you. Look at you.
You look so pretty.

685
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,231
The truth is,
we're both frauds.

686
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,193
Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.

687
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,550
I mean, you risked your life
to help people you love.

688
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,830
l-I risked your life
to help myself.

689
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,679
At least
you had good intentions.

690
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,916
What? What do you mean
you're not lucky?

691
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,669
You lied to me?

692
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,713
And what are you, a sheep?

693
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,277
I'll have to face my father
sooner or later.

694
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,834
- Let's go home.
- Yeah.

695
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,791
This ain't gonna be pretty.

696
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,629
But don't you worry, okay?
Things will work out.

697
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,548
We started this thing together,
and that's how we'll filnish it.

698
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,995
I promise.

699
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,391
Uh, home is that way.

700
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,592
- I have to do something.
- Did you see those Huns?

701
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,156
They popped out of the snow
like daisies!

702
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,555
Are we in this together
or not?

703
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,316
Well, let's go kick
some Hunny buns!

704
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,190
Make way for
the heroes of China.

705
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,392
- Shang!
- Mulan?

706
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,795
The Huns are alive!
They're in the city!

707
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,434
You don't belong here,
Mulan. Go home.

708
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,914
Shang, I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.

709
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,429
Why should I?

710
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,796
Why else would I come back?

711
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:17,072
You said you'd trust Ping.
Why is Mulan any different?

712
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,592
Keep your eyes open.
I know they're here. Yah!

713
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,109
- Now, where are you going?
- To filnd someone who will believe me.

714
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,392
My children,
heaven smiles down...

715
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,080
upon the Middle Kingdom.

716
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,078
China will sleep
safely tonight...

717
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,998
thanks to
our brave warriors.

718
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,235
Sir, the emperor's in danger.

719
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,396
But the Huns are here.

720
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,193
Please, you have to help.

721
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,429
- No one will listen.
- Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

722
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,357
- Did you say something?
- Mushu.

723
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,199
Hey, you're a girl again,
remember?

724
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,151
Your Majesty...

725
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,955
I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

726
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:51,470
I know what this means
to you, Captain Li.

727
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,478
Your father would have been
very proud.

728
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,274
- No!
- Come on!

729
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,714
They'll never reach
the emperor in time.

730
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,632
Hey, guys!
I've got an idea.

731
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,028
Be a man

732
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:09,153
- We must be swift as a coursing river
- Be a man

733
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,114
- With all the force of a great typhoon
- Be a man

734
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,676
With all the strength
of a raging fire

735
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,315
Mysterious as
the dark side of

736
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,637
The moon

737
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,197
Boo.

738
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,635
Guard the door.

739
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,234
Your walls and armies
have fallen...

740
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,920
and now it's your turn.

741
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,395
Bow to me.

742
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,109
- Okay. Any questions?
- Does this dress make me look fat?

743
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,271
Who's there?

744
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,631
- Concubines.
- Ugly concubines.

745
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,115
Oh, he's so cute!

746
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,635
Now, that's what I call
Mongolian barbecue.

747
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,076
Shang, go!

748
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,510
I tire of your arrogance,
old man. Bow to me!

749
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,870
No matter how the wind howls...

750
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,310
the mountain cannot bow to it.

751
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,273
Then you will kneel in pieces!

752
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,436
Chien-Po, get the emperor!

753
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,074
Sorry, Your Majesty.

754
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,149
No!

755
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,799
Come on!

756
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,432
No.

757
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,877
You!

758
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,394
- You took away my victory!
- No!

759
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,317
I did.

760
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,674
The soldier from the mountains.

761
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,433
- So what's the plan?
- Um...

762
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,475
- You don't have a plan?
- Hey, I'm making this up as I go.

763
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,750
- Mushu!
- Way ahead of you, sister.

764
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,711
Come on, Cri-Kee.

765
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,436
- Citizens, I need filrepower.
- Who are you?

766
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,790
Your worst nightmare.

767
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,069
- On the roof!
- Look!

768
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,632
It looks like
you're out of ideas.

769
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,916
Not quite. Ready, Mushu?

770
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,476
I am ready, baby!
Light me.

771
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,512
Get off the roof,
get off the roof, get off the roof.

772
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,754
You are a lucky bug.

773
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,948
That was a deliberate
attempt on my life!

774
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,548
Where is she?
Now she's done it.

775
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,910
What a mess!
Stand aside!

776
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,793
That creature's
not worth protecting.

777
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,751
- She's a hero.
- 'Tis a woman.

778
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,917
- She'll never be worth anything.
- Listen, you pompous...

779
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,270
That is enough.

780
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,556
Your Majesty, I can explain.

781
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,597
I've heard a great deal
about you, Fa Mulan.

782
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:00,959
You stole your father's armour,
ran away from home...

783
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,514
impersonated a soldier...

784
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,471
deceived
your commanding offilcer...

785
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,639
dishonoured the Chinese Army,
destroyed my palace...

786
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,830
and...

787
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,474
you have saved us all.

788
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,595
My little baby is all grown up
and... and savin' China.

789
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,711
You have a tissue?

790
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,150
- Chi Fu?
- Your Excellency?

791
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,317
See to it that this woman
is made a member of my council.

792
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,477
Uh, a member... What?
Uh... But...

793
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,593
There are no council positions
open, Your Majesty.

794
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,280
Very well.
You can have his job.

795
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,278
What? l... Oh.

796
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,079
With all due respect,
Your Excellency...

797
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,873
I think I've been away
from home long enough.

798
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,912
Then take this...

799
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,589
so your family will know
what you have done for me.

800
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,676
And this...

801
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,954
so the world will know
what you have done for China.

802
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,992
Is she allowed to do that?

803
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,277
Um... You...

804
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,834
You filght good.

805
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,758
Oh. Thank you.

806
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,479
Khan, let's go home.

807
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:23,637
The flower that blooms
in adversity...

808
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,150
is the most rare
and beautiful of all.

809
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,636
- Sir?
- You don't meet a girl like that...

810
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,069
every dynasty.

811
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,952
- Mulan!
- Father.

812
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,311
I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

813
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,000
And the crest
of the emperor.

814
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,790
They're gifts
to honour the Fa family.

815
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,474
The greatest gift and honour...

816
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,434
is having you for a daughter.

817
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,471
I've missed you so.

818
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,875
I've missed you too, Baba.

819
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,228
Great.
She brings home a sword.

820
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,157
If you ask me,
she should've brought home a man.

821
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,477
Excuse me.
Does Fa Mulan live here?

822
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,471
- Thank you.
- Whoo! Sign me up for the next war.

823
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,676
Honourable Fa Zhou, l...
Mulan!

824
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,712
Uh, you forgot your helmet.

825
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:08,119
Uh, w-w-well, actually, it's, uh,
your helmet, isn't it? I mean...

826
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,037
Would you like to stay
for dinner?

827
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,277
Would you like
to stay forever?

828
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,231
Dinner would be great.

829
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,954
Come on.
Who did a good job?

830
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,230
Come on. Tell me.
Who did a good job?

831
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,797
Oh, all right!
You can be a guardian again.

832
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,755
Take it, Cri-Kee!

833
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,954
You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.

834
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,469
Call out for egg rolls!

835
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,160
Guardians.

836
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,193
- Oh.
- Thanks, Mushu.

837
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,639
Mushu!

838
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,038
Whenever you feel your world
is crashin'down on you

839
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,948
Whenever you don't know
where to turn or what to do

840
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,469
Don't look too far

841
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,397
You've got the guide

842
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,397
To find your way

843
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,080
Let your heart decide

844
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,829
Be true to your heart
You must be true to your heart

845
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,871
That's when the heavens will part

846
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,798
And show the world
what you believe in

847
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,469
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies

848
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,636
And when you're true to your heart

849
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,514
- Then you've got all you need
to make it through
- Be true

850
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,755
To your heart

851
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,074
Ah, someone you know
is on your side

852
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,316
Can set you free

853
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,319
I can do that for you
if you believe in me

854
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,795
Why second guess

855
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,797
What feels so right

856
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,717
just trust your heart

857
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,559
And you'll see the light

858
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,911
Be true to your heart
You must be true to your heart

859
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,270
That's when
the heavens will part

860
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,233
And show the world
what you believe in

861
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,750
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies

862
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,950
And when you're true
to your heart

863
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:24,073
Then you've got all you need
to make it through

864
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,753
- You know it's true
- It'll see you through

865
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,235
- Yeah, yeah
- You've got to be true

866
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,237
Baby

867
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,191
To your heart

868
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,836
Be true to your heart
You must be true to your heart

869
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,030
That's when the heavens will part

870
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,958
And show the world
what you believe in

871
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:52,595
Open your eyes
Your heart will tell you no lies

872
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,711
And when you're true
to your heart

873
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:00,437
- Then you've got all you need
to make it through
- You've got to be true

874
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,795
To your heart

875
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,753
Sing the chorus, boys.

876
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,950
When things are gettin'crazy

877
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,150
And you don't know
where to start

878
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,236
Keep on believin', baby

879
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,510
just be true to your heart

880
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,631
- When all the world around you
- Yeah

881
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,796
It seems to fall apart

882
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,911
Keep on believin', baby

883
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,110
- just be true to your heart
- True to your heart

884
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,595
You've got to be true

885
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,711
To your heart

886
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,877
Got to be true

887
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,275
Be true
True, true, true, true

888
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,310
To your heart

889
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,189
Look at me

890
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:54,075
You may think you see
who I really am

891
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,555
But you'll never know me

892
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,796
Every day

893
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,789
It's as if I play a part

894
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,911
Now I see

895
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:10,875
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world

896
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,313
But I cannot fool my heart

897
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:23,074
Who is that girl I see

898
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,716
Staring straight back at me

899
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:33,233
When will my reflection show

900
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:38,593
Who I am inside

901
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,870
I am now

902
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,869
In a world where
I have to hide my heart

903
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,355
And what I believe in

904
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,436
But somehow

905
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,915
I will show the world

906
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,429
What's inside my heart

907
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,712
And be loved for who I am

908
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,755
Who is that girl I see

909
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:13,351
Staring straight back at me

910
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:17,155
Why is my reflection

911
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:22,798
Someone I don't know

912
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:27,994
Must I pretend that I'm

913
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:32,511
Someone else for all time

914
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:37,509
When will my reflection show

915
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,517
Who I am

916
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:42,552
Inside, there's a heart

917
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:45,911
That must be free

918
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,759
To fly

919
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,871
And I burn

920
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,753
With a need to know

921
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:59,079
The reason why

922
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:04,035
Why must we all conceal

923
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:08,312
What we think
How we feel

924
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:12,911
Must there be a secret me

925
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:17,750
I'm forced to hide

926
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:23,034
I won't pretend that I'm

927
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:27,597
Someone else for all time

928
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:32,669
When will my reflection show

929
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,954
Who I am inside

930
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:45,278
When will my reflection show

931
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:49,234
Who I am inside

932
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,673
Oh, hey, yeah
