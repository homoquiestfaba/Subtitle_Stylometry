1
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm voting for Dukakis.

2
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,080
Hm...

3
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,040
Well...

4
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,360
Maybe when you have children
who need braces

5
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,560
and half of your husband's pay cheque
goes to the government, you'll regret that.

6
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,840
My husband's pay cheque?

7
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm not squeezing one out till I'm 30.

8
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,040
Will you still be at the Yarn Barn?
That's a great place to raise children.

9
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,240
- That's really funny.
- I think a year of partying's enough.

10
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,880
- She's going to Harvard next fall.
- I haven't gotten in yet.

11
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,040
You think Dukakis will provide for America
till you squeeze one out?

12
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,840
Yeah, I do.

13
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,720
- When can I squeeze one out?
- Eighth grade.

14
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,880
Excuse me.

15
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Donnie, you're such a dick.

16
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,600
Whoa, Elizabeth! A little hostile there.

17
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,560
Maybe YOU should be in therapy,

18
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,920
then Mom and Dad can pay someone to listen
to YOUR thoughts so we don't have to.

19
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,360
OK. Tell us why
you stopped taking your medication.

20
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,520
You're such a fuck-ass!

21
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,040
- Please.
- Did you just call me a fuck-ass?

22
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,920
- That's enough.
- Go suck a fuck!

23
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,480
- How does one suck a fuck?
- Shall I tell you?

24
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
- Please.
- Not at the dinner table.

25
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,800
- Stop.
- Fuck...

26
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,200
What's a fuck-ass?

27
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,640
I took a year off to be with you.

28
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,360
- What?
- How did you know?

29
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,160
- I didn't know it was a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

30
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,600
I'm reading. Get out.

31
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,920
Where do you go at night?

32
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,400
- Just get out.
- Did you toilet-paper the Johnsons' house?

33
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,240
- Is that why you're here?
- No.

34
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,960
- I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade.
- Where's my son? I don't recognise you.

35
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,280
Then you take the goddamn pills.

36
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Bitch.

37
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,520
Our son just called me a bitch.

38
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,160
You're not a bitch.

39
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,400
You're bitchin', but you're not a bitch.

40
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,640
<i>I want to be a president who makes sure</i>

41
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,600
<i>that we never again do business
with a drug-running Panamanian dictator</i>

42
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,840
<i>or funnel aid to the Contras
through drug dealers.</i>

43
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,640

44
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,880
Dukakis... Son of a bitch.

45
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,760
<i>Those are the values I want to bring
to the presidency and to the White House.</i>

46
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,840
- "Panama is a friendly country. "
- Tell him, George.

47
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,480
<i>I talked to the president of Panama
about their money laundering.</i>

48
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,280

49
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,160

50
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,760

51
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,640

52
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,880
<i>Come closer.</i>

53
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,960

54
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,960

60
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,440
Son? Donnie Darko?

61
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,040
Donnie Darko?
What the heck's going on here?

62
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,000
- Who is it?
- It's Eddie Darko's kid.

63
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,800
He's just a neighbourhood kid.

64
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,680
Guess he was sleep-golfing?

65
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Watch out for that drool spot!

66
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,720
Are you all right, son?

67
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,840
So let's stay off the links at night, OK?

68
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,360
I'm sorry, Dr Fisher.
It... It won't happen again.

69
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
- Kids...
- Let's golf.

70
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,560
- No one's allowed.
- This is my house.

71
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,920
- I said...
- This is my house!

72
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,320
Wait a minute.

73
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,320
- Here's your brother.
- It fell in your room.

74
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,040
Ms Darko? I'm Bob Garland. I'm with the FAA.

75
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,800
- The what?
- I'm with the FAA. May we speak privately?

76
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,520
- In private?
- Please.

77
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,000
- And here...
- OK.

78
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,520
All right, we have arranged a hotel.
Get some sleep and we'll take care of this.

79
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,680
- Great.
- Thank you.

80
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,520
Kids, come on. We're going to a hotel.

81
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,120
They don't know where it came from.

82
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,120
- "Where's Pop?"
- "He's still at work. "

83
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,160
If it fell from the plane...
what happened to the plane?

84
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,720
They don't know, Samantha.

85
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,720
Can't we make money from this?
Can't we sue the airline?

86
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,480
Shut up, Sam.

87
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,240
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie?
He stinks.

88
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,440
When you fall asleep tonight,

89
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,440
- I'm gonna fart in your face.
- I'm telling Mom!

90
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,880
Samantha, don't go over there.

91
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,520
Frankie Feedler.

92
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,480
You remember. From high school.

93
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,160
Hm... Mm-hm.

94
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,800
He died. Remember?

95
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,920
Mm-hm.

96
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,080
On his way to the prom.

97
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,880
They said he was doomed.

98
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,760
Jesus.

99
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,800
They could be saying
the same thing about Donnie.

100
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,640
Our Donnie.

101
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,760
- But he dodged it.
- Hm...

102
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,720
He dodged his photograph.

103
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,120
Hm...

104
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,480
Hm.

105
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,560
Somebody was watching over him.

106
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,200
Mrs Farmer will bring you home
after practice. Bye, honey.

107
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,600
Donnie... good luck.

108
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,000
- Oh, my God! Tell me everything.
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.

109
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,800
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, Cherita.

110
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,520
- Shut up!
- Darko cheats death! Huh?

111
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,240
You're a celebrity! I called you
a jillion times. Where you been?

112
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,760
- At a hotel.
- Dad saw you at the golf course.

113
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,280
- You sleepwalking again, buddy?
- I don't want to talk about it.

114
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,000
Now that you're famous, have a smoke.

115
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,320
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad, Sam?

116
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,120
- You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
- Goddamn right, I will.

117
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,240
- So grody.
- Hey, Cherita, you want a cigarette?

118
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,920
- Shut up!
- "Shut up!"

119
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,080
Go back to China, bitch!

120
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,240
Just leave her alone.

121
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,320

you can give us your opinion.

They say it when they flood the house,
when they tear it to shreds,

158

that destruction is a form of creation,
so burning the money is ironic.

when they tear the world apart.

on the shingle match.

171
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,480
- They still don't know?
- Know what?

172
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,760
- Where it came from?
- Oh, no. They can't tell us.

173
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,520
Something about a matching serial number
that got burned.

174
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,880
I had to sign a form
saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

175
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,960
So we can't tell anyone what nobody knows?

176
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,120
Yeah. But you tell...
What's your doctor's name?

177
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,280
- Dr Thurman, Dad.
- Yes. Tell Dr Thurman whatever you want.

178
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,320
- Dad.
- What?

179
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,040
- Dad!
- Oh...!

180
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,640
What's that woman doing
in the middle of the damn road?!

181
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,920
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.

182
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,560
What did she say to you?

183
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,680
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?

184
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,360
- Imaginary.
- Would you like to talk about this friend?

185
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,520
- Frank.
- Frank.

186
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,880
- What did he say?
- He said to follow him.

187
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,120
- Follow him? Where?
- Into the future.

188
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,520
And then what happens?

189
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,280
And then he said... then he said
that the world was coming to an end.

190
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,320
Do you think the world is coming to an end?

191
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,640
No.

192
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,040
That's stupid.

193
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,160
<i>For my entire life,
I was a victim of my own fear.</i>

194
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,120
<i>Love.</i>

195
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,000
<i>I was feeding fear with food.</i>

196
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,560
<i>Fear.</i>

197
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,200
<i>Finally, I looked in the mirror.</i>

198
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,560
<i>Not just in the mirror.
I looked THROUGH the mirror.</i>

199
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,800
<i>In that image, I saw my ego reflection.</i>

200
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,600
<i>For two years, I thought it was normal
for a 10-year-old to wet the bed...</i>

201
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,240
Shh! Quiet!

202
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,200
<i>But the solution was there all the time.</i>

203
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,200
<i>I'm not afraid any more!</i>

204
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,000
<i>All over America,
people have come together to join hands.</i>

205
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,720
<i>People who believe that human life
is absolutely too important,</i>

206
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,480
<i>too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear.</i>

207
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,880
<i>Pay close attention.
You could miss something.</i>

208
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,880
<i>Hello. My name is Jim Cunningham.
And welcome to "Controlling Fear".</i>

209
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,640
".. and the prince was led into a world
of strange and beautiful magic. "

210
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,120
Wow.

211
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,640
"The Last Unicorn" by Samantha Darko.

212
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,920
- Give it back!
- "There was once a unicorn named Ariel... "

213
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,840
- You wrinkled it.
- It's not wrinkled, Sam.

214
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,600
It's 7.45. The bus should've been here
20 minutes ago.

215
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,520
Maybe Martha finally went nuts
and hijacked it.

216
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,360
There's this rule -
at 7.45, we get to go home.

217
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,440
There's no rule.

218
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,360
Cherita, you should... go home.

219
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,360
Yeah, if you're here
when the bus comes, we'll get in trouble.

220
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
- Shut up!
- "Shut up!"

221
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,280
Hey, Porky Pig... I hope you get molested.

222
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,440
Hey! Hey! I can't believe this!

223
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,520
School's closed today because it's flooded.

224
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,840
- No way!
- Yeah.

225
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,640
Holy shit! That's the best news ever!

226
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
My God, is this ever going to stop?

227
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,040
Eventually, yes. But right now,
I got 12 classrooms full of water.

228
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,040
All coming from a busted water main.

229
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,560
- What else?
- What else?

230
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,120
Principal Cole, I'll show you what else.

231
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,120
That's unbelievable.
That's solid bronze, isn't it?

232
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,280
- Yep.
- How did this happen?

233
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,400
I heard a cat burglar trashed everything
and the Mongrel got his head cut off.

234
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,560
- Hah!
- True!

235
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,800
Beth's mom said the boys' locker room flooded
and they found faeces everywhere.

236
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,520
- What are faeces?
- Baby mice.

237
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,600
Hey.

238
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,000
Has anyone ever told you that you're sexy?

239
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,160
I like your boobs.

240
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,960
Hey.

241
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,760
Hey.

242
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,560
School's cancelled.

243
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,960
Do you want to walk me home?

244
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,120
Sure.

245
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,400
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

246
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,200
Check your backpack. Those guys steal shit.

247
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,920
Fuck 'em!

248
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,360
- So, why'd you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.

249
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,240
My mom got a restraining order against
my stepdad. He has emotional problems.

250
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,960
I have those, too. What kind does he have?

251
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,520
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.

252
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,280
Oh. Did he go to jail?

253
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,520
No, he fled. They still can't find him.

254
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,160
Mom and I had to change our names.
I thought Gretchen Ross was pretty cool.

255
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,360
I was in jail once. I mean...
I burned down this house.

256
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,720
It was abandoned, but I got held back
in school and I can't drive till I'm 21.

257
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,160
But I'm over all of that.

258
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,280
I'm... painting and stuff.

259
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Writing. I want to be a writer.
Maybe a painter. Maybe both...

260
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,880
I'll write a book and draw the pictures.

261
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,040
Then maybe people will understand me.
I don't know, change things.

262
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,880
Donnie Darko - what the hell kind of name
is that? It's like a superhero or something.

263
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,040
What makes you think I'm not?

264
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,040
I should go. For physics,
Montinoff is having me write this essay -

265
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,880
the greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind.

266
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,160
It's Monnitoff.
But that's easy. Antiseptics.

267
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,880
Like, the whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.

268
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,960
Before antiseptics, there was no sanitation,
especially in medicine.

269
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,120
You mean soap?

270
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,080
Well, I'm really glad
school was flooded today.

271
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,600
Why is that?

272
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,760
We'd never have had this conversation.

273
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,000
You're weird.

274
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,120
Sorry.

275
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,680
No, that was a compliment.

276
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,960
Well, look, uh...

277
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,800
You want to go with me?

278
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,280
- Where do you want to go?
- No, I mean, like, "go" with me.

279
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,080
- You know, like "going together".
- Sure.

280
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,960
OK. Where are you going?

281
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,320
I'm going home.

282
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,880
Stupid...
"Where are you going?"

283
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,240
I'd like to try something new.

284
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,760
Have you ever been hypnotised?

285
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,240
No.

286
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,360
When I clap twice, you will wake up.
Do you understand?

287
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,840
- Yes.
- So, tell me about your week.

288
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,160
I met a girl.

289
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,400
What is her name?

290
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,560
Gretchen.

291
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,120
We're going together now.

292
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,880
Do you still think about girls a lot?

293
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,880
Yeah.

294
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,000
- How are things going at school?
- I think about girls a lot.

295
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,600
I asked you about school, Donnie.

296
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,240
I think about fucking a lot during school.

297
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,400
- What else do you think about during school?
- "Married With Children".

298
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,320
- You think about your family?
- I just turn down the volume

299
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,960
and think about fucking Christina Applegate.

300
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,840
I asked you about your family.

301
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,440
No.

302
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,960
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.

303
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,160
I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.

304
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,480
Sam Bylan.

305
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,720
Cherita Chen.

306
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,120
Donald Darko.

307
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,160
Daye Dennis.

308
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,840
Hey, you fuck!

309
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,960
Did you say I flooded the school?

310
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,840
- I didn't say shit.
- Yeah, well, they think I did it.

311
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,920
If you're innocent,
then you have nothing to worry about, right?

312
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,280
Fuck you! You know what I think?

313
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,320
I think you did it.

314
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,960
Beer and pussy - that's all I need.

315
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,960
- We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
- Smurfette?

316
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,160
Mm-hm.
Not some tight-ass Middlesex chick.

317
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,600
Like, this cute little blonde that'll
get down with the guys like Smurfette does.

318
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,080
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

319
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,640
That's bullshit.
Why do you think Papa Smurf made her?

320
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,680
Because the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

321
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,480
- Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.
- Then she fucks them while Vanity watches.

322
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,680
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get some action?

323
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,080
What he does, he films the gang-bang.
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

324
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,840
First of all, Papa Smurf
didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did.

325
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,160
She was sent as Gargamel's evil spy
to destroy the Smurf village,

326
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,320
but the overwhelming goodness
of the Smurfs transformed her.

327
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,920
And as for the whole gang-bang scenario,
it just couldn't happen!

328
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:18,680
Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have
reproductive organs under those little pants.

329
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,760
That's what's so illogical
about being a Smurf.

330
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,960
What's the point of living
if you don't have a dick?

331
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,280
Donnie, why you gotta get smart on us?

332
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,480
Grandma Death.

333
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,800
Excuse me! Excuse me!

334
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,600
Please stay off the road, Miss Sparrow,
or I will call Social Services.

335
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,200
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch!

336
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,280
Yeah.

337
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,800
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

338
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,680
She does the same thing every day.

339
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,480
Just walks back and forth
and back and forth to the mailbox.

340
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,080
Nothing ever in there.

341
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,360
Oh, wait, wait, wait...

342
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,080
She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.

343
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,640
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

344
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,880
This could be it. Oh...?

345
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,320
- Oh, no dice, Grandma. Sorry.
- Someone ought to write that bitch.

346
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,640
<i>Authorities continued their search</i>

347
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,080
<i>for a suspect
in the Middlesex Ridge School vandalism.</i>

348
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,480
<i>The private school has asked
for donations to restore its beloved mascot,</i>

349
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,880
<i>known only as the Mongrel...</i>

350
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,320
It's very helpful.
There's a good turnout tonight.

351
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,360
What are you trying to accomplish here?

352
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,040
There was urine and faeces
flooded in my office.

353
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,320
Whatever fits.

354
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,240
"Whatever fits"?

355
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,920
In cooperation with the county police,

356
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,160
we have begun an active investigation
into the cause of the flooding.

357
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,960
And our suspects
include several of our own students...

358
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,920
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

359
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,200
Kitty, I would appreciate if you would wait...

360
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,000
Dr Cole, not only am I a teacher,
but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child.

361
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,520
Therefore I am the only person here
who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

362
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,520
<i>Don't worry. You got away with it.</i>

363
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,960
I have in my hand Graham Greene's
"The Destructors".

364
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,040
This short story is part
of my daughter's English assignment.

365
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:11,040
In this story, several children destroy
an elderly man's house from inside out.

366
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,400
How can you do that?

367
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:39,280
And how do they do this? They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

368
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,040
<i>I can do anything I want.</i>

369
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,560
<i>And so can you.</i>

370
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,080
And I think
that this garbage should be removed!

371
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,760
Excuse me. What is the real issue here?
The PTA doesn't ban books.

372
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,760
The PTA must acknowledge that pornography
is being taught in our curriculum!

373
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,280
- It's meant to be ironic.
- Excuse me. Go back to grad school.

374
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,360
Why did you make me flood the school?

375
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
<i>They are in great danger.</i>

376
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,000
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?

377
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,000
I think we have all seen "Bonanza".

378
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,240
Well, um... while we are on other topics...

379
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,800
Where do you come from?

380
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,080
<i>Do you believe in time travel?</i>

381
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,240
Who are you talking to?

382
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,720
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

383
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,880
A storm is coming, Frank says.

384
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,000
A storm that will swallow the children,

385
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,520
And I will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain.

386
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,680
I'll deliver them back to their doorsteps,
send the monsters back to the underground.

387
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,800
I'll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them.

388
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,160
Except for me.

389
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,000
Because I am Donnie Darko.

390
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,360
Who is Frank?

391
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,360
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

392
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,120
<i>In these modern times, our attitude
and beliefs are so delicate, so fragile.</i>

393
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:02,400
<i>I have had a Cunning Vision.
This vision has released me.</i>

394
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,640
<i>It's important that our lifeline be
rejuvenated, so that we can breathe again.</i>

395
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,800
<i>It's time to breathe.</i>

396
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,920
<i>It is time to breathe.</i>

397
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,440
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

398
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,000
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

399
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,080
<i>So now let us begin Lifeline Exercise
Number One. Please press stop now.</i>

400
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,480
As you can see, the lifeline
is divided into two polar extremes.

401
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,640
Fear and love.

402
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,080
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum.

403
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,280
- Love is in the positive energy spectrum.
- No, duh

404
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,040
Excuse me?
"No, duh" is a product of fear.

405
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,960
Now, on each card is a character dilemma
which applies to the lifeline.

406
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,320
Please... Take this. Thank you.

407
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,720
Please read each character dilemma aloud

408
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,920
and place an "X" on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

409
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,600
Cherita?

410
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,080
"Juanita has an important math test today.

411
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,720
"She's known about the test
for several weeks, but has not studied.

412
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:39,400
"In order to keep from failing,
Juanita decides to cheat on the math test. "

413
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,760
Good. Good. Very good.

414
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,760
Mr Darko.

415
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,040
"Ling Ling finds a wallet filled with money.

416
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,720
"She takes it to the address
on the driver's licence but keeps the money. "

417
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,520
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer. I don't get this.

418
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,520
Just place an "X" in the appropriate place.

419
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,880
I know what to do, but you can't lump things
into two categories.

420
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,520
The lifeline is divided that way.

421
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,200
Well, life isn't that simple. I mean...

422
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,600
Who cares if Ling Ling keeps the money?
It has nothing to do with fear or love.

423
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,440
- They are the deepest human emotions.
- OK. But you're not listening to me.

424
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,480
There are other things to take into account,
the whole spectrum of human emotion.

425
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,920
You can't just lump everything
into two categories and deny everything else!

426
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,120
If you don't complete the assignment,
you'll get a zero.

427
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,160
Donald, let me preface this by saying

428
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,840
that your Iowa Test scores are... intimidating.

429
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,480
So...

430
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,680
Let's go over this again.
What exactly did you say to Miss Farmer?

431
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,680
I'll tell you. He asked me to forcibly insert
the lifeline exercise card into my anus!

432
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,880
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

433
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,840
Kitty... Excuse us, please.

434
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,640
They've suspended him
from after-school activities for six months.

435
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,960
Since this jet engine fiasco,
I don't know what's gotten into...

436
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,200
I'll say this because our daughters are
on the dance team together and I respect you,

437
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,600
but after witnessing your son's behaviour,
I have significant doubts about your...

438
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:19,120
Our paths through life must be righteous.
Go home and look in the mirror

439
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,920
and pray that your son doesn't succumb
to the path of fear.

440
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Do you remember
that weird gym teacher, Mrs Farmer?

441
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,200
Yeah. OK, well, my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today.

442
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,200
And then my parents
just bought him all this new shit.

443
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah, I know.
I wish a jet engine would fall on my room.

444
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,520
- Dr Monnitoff.
- Donnie.

445
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,040
Um...

446
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:14,640
I know this is gonna sound kind of weird,
but do you know anything about... time travel?

447
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,840
A wormhole
with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

448
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,400
which is theoretically
a wormhole in space controlled by man.

449
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,280
So, according to Hawking,
a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut

450
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,240
for jumping
between two distant regions of space-time.

451
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,480
So to travel back in time, you have to have
a spaceship faster than the speed of light.

452
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,600
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.

453
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,360
The basic principles of time travel are there.

454
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,200
Your vessel and portal.
Your vessel can be anything.

455
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,400
- Like a DeLorean?
- Metal craft of any kind.

456
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:02,280
You know, I love that movie.
It's so... like, futuristic, you know?

457
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,520
Listen, um...
don't tell anybody that I gave you this.

458
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,920
Woman who wrote this used to teach here.
She was a nun long before that.

459
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,800
Then overnight
she became this entirely different person.

460
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,240
She up and left the church,
wrote this book...

461
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,600
She started teaching science,
right here at Middlesex.

462
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,840
"The Philosophy Of Time Travel".

463
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,520
Roberta Sparrow?

464
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,480
That's right.

465
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,600
Roberta Sparrow?

466
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,400
Roberta Sparrow.

467
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,800
Grandma Death.

468
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,360
It's called "The Philosophy Of Time Travel".

469
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,960
- What does philosophy have to do with it?
- Guess who wrote it.

470
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,440
Who?

471
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,600
Roberta Sparrow. Huh! She wrote a book.

472
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,480
- Grandma Death wrote a book.
- That's a terrible nickname.

473
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,680
We almost ran her down the other day.

474
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,680
She lives in that piece of crap house,
and you know she's loaded.

475
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,440
- You're right.
- She was known for her gem collection.

476
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,120
Kids used to go up there all the time
and try to steal stuff from her.

477
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,360
She became a total recluse.

478
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,800
Huh! I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down.

479
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,880
<i>She was just standing in the road, frozen.</i>

480
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,080
<i>I walked over to see if she was OK.</i>

481
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,600
And she whispered in my ear.

482
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,400
- What did she say?
- I think Frank wants me to talk to her.

483
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,240
He asked if I knew about time travel.

484
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,880
She wrote a book about it,
so that can't be a coincidence, right?

485
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,040
What did she say to you?

486
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,280
She said that every living creature
on earth dies alone.

487
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,320
How did that make you feel?

488
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,440
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

489
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,920
She died when I was eight
and she crawled underneath the... the porch.

490
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,480
To die.

491
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,000
To be alone.

492
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,400
Do you feel alone right now?

493
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,080
I don't know...

494
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,640
I'd like to believe I'm not, but I just...

495
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:34,040
I've just never seen any proof,
so I just don't debate it any more.

496
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,440
I could spend my whole life debating it
over and over and still wouldn't have proof,

497
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,000
so I just don't debate it any more.

498
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,160
It's absurd.

499
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,760
The search for God is absurd?

500
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,480
It is if everyone dies alone.

501
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,680
Does that scare you?

502
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,520
I don't want to be alone.

503
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,000
And his tapes have made me realise

504
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,680
that for the last 39 years,
I have been a prisoner of my own fear.

505
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,800
Fear.

506
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,840
You have got to meet this Jim Cunningham.

507
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,520
I can't believe he's single.

508
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,320
<i>It has been a disappointing
night for these Super Bowl champions.</i>

509
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,800
<i>You're right, Dan.
Coach Joe Gibbs is on the sidelines.</i>

510
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,600
<i>He's gotta be thinking, "What happened?
What went wrong tonight?"</i>

511
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,440
- "And here's the kick."
- Oh!

512
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,560
<i>It's no good...</i>

513
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,720
- Shit, we need a quarterback.
- We need a miracle.

514
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,000
- We need to go for a safety.
- "What the future holds for this MVP,"

515
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,760
<i>we'll have to wait and see.</i>

516
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,840
You guys want anything?

517
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:19,120
<i>This week on "Who's The Boss?"
Samantha borrows Tony's van</i>

518
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,400
<i>and gets caught without a licence.</i>

519
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,960
<i>Better make sure
we don't miss that one.</i>

520
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,920
<i>Here we are again. Fourth down now...</i>

521
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,000
Tomorrow, we meet our partners

522
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,640
for the Young Inventors' Fair.

523
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,640
What if you could go back in time
and take those hours of pain

524
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,240
and replace them with something better?

525
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,720
- Like images?
- Yeah, a Hawaiian sunset

526
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,680
or the Grand Canyon.

527
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,280
- Things that remind you how beautiful...
- We've been going together for two weeks.

528
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,040
Yeah?

529
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,200
Well, I er... I...

530
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,120
You want to kiss me?

531
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,240
- I'm sorry, I...
- Look, Donnie, wait. I just...

532
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,960
- Well, I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be at a time when... it...

533
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,080
- When what?
- When it reminds me just...

534
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,120
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?

535
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,800
Yeah.

536
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,480
And there's some fat guy staring at us.

537
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:56,160
I don't think telling any woman
to forcibly insert an object up her anus

538
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,040
is something
that should go without consequence.

539
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,000
I think we should buy him a moped.

540
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,600
I think we should get a divorce.

541
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,200
- You won't tell Mom, will you?
- Why would I?

542
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,400
- You tell Mom everything.
- No, I don't.

543
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,280
- Let me see it.
- No, it's not finished. It's...

544
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,240
OK. It's cool.

545
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,200
That's scary.

546
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,880
You think?

547
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,040
Thank you for seeing us at such late notice.

548
00:59:54,240 --> 01:00:00,600
- We both felt we should come and discuss...
- What I think is going on with your son.

549
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,440
Yes.

550
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,520
Um... Well, he's er...

551
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,640
You know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

552
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,800
for insulting his gym teacher.

553
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:18,320
I'm not sure that's a good example.
I think he had just cause.

554
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,440
Rose, let me lay out
what I believe is happening here.

555
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:32,920
Donnie's aggressive behaviour...
his increased detachment from reality,

556
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:38,200
seem to stem from his inability
to cope with the forces in the world

557
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,560
that he perceives to be threatening.

558
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,160
Has he ever told you about Frank?

559
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,840
Frank?

560
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,800
Yes, the giant bunny rabbit.

561
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,440
The what?

562
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,680
I don't recall
him ever having mentioned a rabbit.

563
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,280
Donnie is experiencing what is
commonly called a daylight hallucination.

564
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,760
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

565
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:38,280
- What can we do?
- I would like to do more hypnotherapy...

566
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,600
.. and increase his medication.

567
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:54,560
Whatever will help him, really, is...
That's why we're here.

568
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,960
We just would like him
to experience some relief.

569
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,000
So if you think
that more medication will do that,

570
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,680
then I think we should give it a try.

571
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,600
It's complicated.

572
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,440
Yeah?

573
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,680
There's like a force in your brain
that just sends you someplace.

574
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,120
Do you go someplace familiar?

575
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:32,720
No, but each time I keep waking up
farther from my house.

576
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,400
Scary.

577
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,400
Donnie Darko.

578
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,520
I know.

579
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,160
- Good morning, you mongrels!
- Good morning.

580
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,200
Is that all you can muster? Good morning!

581
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,880
- Good morning!
- Now, that's a tiny, tiny bit better.

582
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:19,160
But I still sense some students
who are actually afraid to say "good morning".

583
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,000
Good morning!

584
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,160
Yeah, that's what I like to hear!
Too many young men and women today

585
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,920
are completely paralysed by their fears.

586
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:34,160
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

587
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,680
of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.

588
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,880
Now, I'm going to tell you a little story today.

589
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,600
It's a heartbreakingly sad story
about a young man

590
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:50,240
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear,

591
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,480
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.
