Then I showed them how she can open, and inside there’s another, and another, and another and another.

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,900
So, did everyone at school like Sofia?

5
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,920
What’s not to like?

6
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,240
Well, Of course.

7
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,200
Hey, You pick this time.

8
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,160
Huh.

9
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,100
Are you sure?

10
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,900
Daffodils are my favorites, too.

11
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,220
Okay.

12
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,060
I changed my mind.

13
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,620
We don’t need flowers.

14
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,080
Well, I was thinking we’d have ravioli tonight.

15
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,980
I want sushi.

16
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,820
Well, Tough luck, I want pasta.

17
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,200
But you can pick the dessert.

18
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,960
C’mon!

19
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,220
I would like a nice wedge of Asagio and two boxes of spinach ravioli.

20
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,220
Sure!

21
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,040
My pleasure.

22
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,600
Now, why don’t you go find us some chocolate.

23
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,660
C'mon!

24
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,800

What are you looking at!?

27
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,080
It’s okay.

28
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,140
It’s just an accident.

29
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,700
Paul, They need you in the back.

30
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,560
Now!

31
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,340
I’m so sorry, Mrs. Weiss.

32
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,080
It’s okay.

33
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,160
Anyone can have an off day.

34
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,620
Uh, Everyday is an off day for Paul.

35
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,400
Oh, Don’t say that.

36
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,060
He’s a good man.

37
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,880
Thank you so much.

38
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,240
We’ll see you next week.

39
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,060
Okay.

40
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,340
What the hell is wrong with you?

41
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,520
C'mon

42
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,180
C’mon sweetie. Don’t stare.

43
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,260
Let them have their own private business.

44
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,440
I didn’t get the chocolate.

45
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,860
That’s okay.

46
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,700
I’ve got a secret stash of brownies in the freezer.

47
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,240
But you can’t tell daddy.

48
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,220
Why do you think he’s good?

49
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,640
Daddy?

50
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,280
No, the Deli man.

51
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,180
Because I think all people are good.

52
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,620
C’mon!

53

What did you get?

73
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,920
Nothing good.

74
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,260
There’s no milk.

75
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,740
There will be milk tomorrow.

I can drop you off, but I can’t pick you up.

83
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,100

You’re so funny Michelle.

Don’t forget to say my name in your prayers tonight.

Okay.

You know better than that.

226
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,940
I’m sorry.

227

You’re sorry?

228
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,100
You’re sorry.

229
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,740
I’m sorry too baby.

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,880
What happened to your mom?

She died.

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,340
I guess she didn’t love you enough then.

245
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,100
Yes, She did!

246
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,760
What about your dad?

Yeah.

I don’t know.

252
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,220
Everyone loves my dad.

253
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,080
He gets to be in the parade and everything.

254
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,500
And his students bring us cookies and stuff.

255
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,140

He doesn’t love me, though.

260
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,960
Worms are so cool.

261
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,540
If you cut a worm in half, it can still live.

262
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,340
Worms are good to fish with.

263
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,660
Sometimes, worms get dried up on the sidewalks and die.

264
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,900

Good luck, Rachel.

271
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,500
Butterflies begin their lives as caterpillars.

272
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,900
A butterfly lays her eggs on a tree leaf.

273
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,380
When the egg hatches, a larva emerges.

274
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,380
This larva turns into a caterpillar.

275
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,120
The caterpillar will spin a cocoon of silk.

276
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,740
Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar turns into a pupa, waiting to be reborn as something new.

277
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,880
After a few weeks, the pupa emerges from the cocoon as a butterfly.

278
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,440
This is called metamorphosis.

My sister, Miranda, died before I was born.

284
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,120
She had a disease called leukemia.

285
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,260
Leukemia is cancer in your blood.

286
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,800
It makes your cells go crazy and you have to have chemotherapy.

287
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,260
It hurts.

288
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,140

Sometimes I pretend I’m inside them.

You don’t believe me.

377
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,020
Come here!

378
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,560
Come here.

379
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,520
Hey,

380
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,420
I promise to keep you safe.

381

Okay?

I don’t want to go there again... ever.

You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.

Rachel, Welcome back.

385
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,160
Come see the eggs.

386
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,040
How will they come out?

387
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,160
Well... All they need is a little bit of heat, and a little bit of love and before you know it, they’re gonna hatch.

388
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,040
So, what I want all of you to do is to think really warm thoughts.

Okay, Back to your desks.

Kacy, would you please pass out a piece of paper to everyone?

392

I saved your homework. The Math was really hard. It’s…

393
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,420
Hey! Uhm…Come over at my house after school.

394
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,560
I can’t.

395
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,020
Why not?

396
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,920
I just can’t.

397
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,920
Hope you’re feeling better.

398
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,520
You know if there’s ever anything you need to talk about.

399
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,620
All you have to do is ask.

400
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,960
All right?

401
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,120
All right.

402
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,160
Good!

403
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,520
Hi.

404
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,560
You said I could come talk to you.

405
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,620
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. C’mon in.

406
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,320
Why do you have this picture?

407
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,800
He’s my brother.

408
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,080
What happened to him?

409
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,000
He disappeared. When I was a teenager.

410
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,780
Did he die?

411
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,680
I don’t know.

412
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,800
We never found anything.

413
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,480
Sorry.

414
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,920
Are you sure you like tea?

415
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,380
I’m sure.

Are you going to unpack your boxes?

417

I don’t know, maybe.

418
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,000
Can I look inside?

I know what that is.

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,520
You do.

424
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,440
I saw a psychologist at my old school.

425
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,696
He talked a lot.

426
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,200
He smelled like milk.

427
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,480
What exactly does milk smell like?

428
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,120
I don’t know. Milk.

Are you a psychologist?

No,

431
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,860
well, I studied in college but I’m a teacher now.

432
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,500
Is this really your house?

433
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,780
It was my grandmother’s.

434
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,720
But she left it to me when she died.

435
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,980
What do you think happens to people when they die?

436

I don’t know.

437
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,320
Do you think there’s a difference between good people and bad people?

438
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,060
When they die, I mean?

439
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,560
I’m not sure if I can answer that.

440
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:49,980
Oh.

441
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,600
Have you ever asked your father these questions?

442
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,800
He doesn’t really listen.

He’s a lawyer.

444
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,140
I should get home.

Oh, you’re welcome.

448

Maybe you could come to our house for dinner one night.

Some kids get their tongues cut in half from razor blades in their Halloween candy.

561
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,220
No, they don’t.

562
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,180
Yes, they do.

563
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,860
They choke in their own blood.

564
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,780
Sometimes they swallow them and slice up their stomachs.

565
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,480
I’m not lying.

566
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,580
What’s wrong with you?

567
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,520
Whew, whew, whew, whew, whew...

568
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,200
What’s wrong? Are you okay?

569
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,840
Yeah.

570
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,180
Are you sure?

571
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,140
Are you with Michelle?

572
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,460
Yeah.

573
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,460
I thought the two of you weren’t friends anymore?

574
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,900
I changed my mind. We’re friends.

575
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,660
I have to go.

576
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,780
We have so much candy...

577
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,980
Here, you can have it,

578
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,340
Sit down, Angel.

579
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,500
Michelle will share her candy with you.

580
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,140
No, I won't.

581
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,300
Yes, You will.

582
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,680
I’ll share mine.

583
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,640
Thank you.

584
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,080
you’re welcome.

585
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,700
Michelle.

586
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,960
Lord, thank you for blessing us with this meal and this home.

587
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,660
Help us all to lead a virtuous life.

588
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,280
Forgive my girls their sins

589
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,240
and help protect them from themselves.

590
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:35,880
Amen.

591
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,000
[Everyone says Amen except Michelle]

592
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,600
Pass the cheese.

593
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,760
Oh! God.

594
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,080
I’ll take that, go, play.

595
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,020
She’s bad.

596
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,660
Michelle is a bad girl. Stay away from her.

597
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,080
See what she did?

598
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,840
She cut me and she’ll cut you, too.

599
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,320
Deborah! Get away from her.

600
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
What did she tell you?

601
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,480
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

602
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,780
She said you cut her.

603
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,660
She’s a big fat liar.

604
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,100
Then what happened to her?

605
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,280
She did it to herself.

606
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,080
People do that, you know.

607
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,320
They hurt themselves and blame other people.

608
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,200
Why would she do that?

609
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,580
Because she’s stupid.

610
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,620
She got dropped on her head when she was a baby.

611
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,060
Can’t you tell?

612
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,300
Rachel! Your dad’s here.

613
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,820
Okay everyone I need to make an announcement.

614
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,840
There was an accident.

615
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,820
Saturday night after the carnival,

616
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,720
Hazel Marie cut her mouth

617
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,200
really badly when she bit into a candy bar that

618
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,480
someone had put a razor blade in.

619
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,740
So I need you guys to take this home,

620
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,880
show to your parents and have them

621
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,500
either check out all your candies or throw all away.

622
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:23,840
Yes Michelle.

623
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,260
What kind of candy bar was it?

624
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,480
I don’t know…

625
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,580
Is she dead?

626
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,180
No, no! Of course not.

627
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,340
Does she still have a tongue?

628
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,120
Michelle!

629
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,900
That’s not even funny.

630
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,980
I told you.

631
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,640
That’s Hazel Marie’s ball.

632
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,400
It’s mine now.

633
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,300
Did you hurt her? Did you give her that candy?

634
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,860
Why would I do that?

635
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,920
I’ll come home with you after school, okay?

636
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,180
I told my mom I was eating at your house tonight.

637
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,740
You can't. I haven’t asked my dad.

638
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,960
He won’t mind.

639
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,420
Why do you care so much from your friend?

640
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,340
Why can’t you find someone else.

641
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,860
Don’t forget about the lipstick.

642
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,160
Rachel, do you mind staying after class for a little bit?

643
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,500
Teacher’s pet, teacher’s pet.

644
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,160
Maybe she knows.

645
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,420
Thanks.

646
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,560
You know why I want to talk to you?

647
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,120
I’m kinda worried about you, Rachel.

648
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,740
I mean, you seem nervous and tired.

649
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,560
Oh.

650
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,460
Is there something bothering you?

651
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,720
You know, something I can help with?

652
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,840
No.

653
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,640
Are you sure?

654
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,140
'Coz I’ll listen to anything.

655
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:06,680
I mean anything.

656
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:17,840
Okay.

657
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,200
It’s okay.

658
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,620
I have something for you.

659
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,740
It’s a mood ring;

660
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,840
I know kind of a silly name huh?

661
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,920
It’s in a shape of butterfly and I know how you love butterflies.

662
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,100
So how it works is,

663
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,520
if it turns black,

664
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,300
that means you’re tense or worried.

665
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,280
But if it turns blue,

666
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,620
that means that you’re peaceful and calm.

667
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,880
Well, you’re gonna have to try real hard to turn it blue.

668
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,840
You take a lot of deep breaths.

669
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,820
Just try not to worry so much okay?

670
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,460
Okay.

671
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,480
Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow.

672
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,380
Thanks!

673
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,560
What did she want?

674
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,780
Nothing.

675
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,400
Can I have that?

676
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:14,520
No!

677
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,360
It’s boring here.

678
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,200
And your house is ugly.

679
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,220
In Los Angeles, we lived in a nice apartment.

680
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,320
With wooden floors and arches in the ceiling.

681
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,180
There was a fountain in the courtyard.

682
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,000
Apartments are for poor people.

683
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,200
Ooh!

684
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,300
What’s in there?

685
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,060
I’m not supposed to go in there.

686
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,440
Michelle, stop! We can’t go in there.

687
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,560
This is a good hide out.

688
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,840
Yuck! Gas.

689
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,360
Want to sip?

690
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:18,860
Don’t!

691
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,320
This could scratch really good.

692
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,440
Don’t you think?

693
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,240
Okay. Let’s go.

694
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,900
Don’t be such a baby.

695
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,080
I’m not a baby.

696
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,000
See yah.

697
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,700
Michelle!!

698
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,460
Michelle!! Let me out, Let me out!!

699
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,560
Let me out, Let me out!! Let me out!!

700
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,580
Michelle.

701
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,560
You are a big baby.

702
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,800
Hey, Allison.

703
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,140
What?

704
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,680
I like your necklace.

705
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,800
My sister gave it to me.

706
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,200
Can I have it?

707
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,300
What?

708
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,260
No!

709
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,080
I want it.

710
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,260
Who cares?

711
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,760
Let’s play a prank on them.

712
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,240
Hold this side.

713
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:49,980
No.

714
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,440
Hold it or I’ll tell.

715
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,040
Why did you do that?

716
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,040
Don’t leave!

717
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,480
- If you leave, I’ll tell.
- I don’t care!

718
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,020
If you leave, something bad will happen.

719
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,598
Something awful,

720
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,440
something bad could happen and it will be all your fault.

721
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,260
Please don’t call the police.

722
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,020
I don’t want to go to jail.

723
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,000
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to steal. I’ve lost mine.

724
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,480
Shhh!! Just calm down.

725
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,620
I’m sorry. Don’t hate me.

726
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,460
Oh! God, no.

727
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:04,720
It’s okay.

728
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,860
Lipstick?

729
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,920
Why would she steal your lipstick?

730
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,880
She hasn’t stolen anything before.

731
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,660
She misses her mom.

732
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,260
I miss her mom too.

733
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:54,940
I know.

734
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,980
I’m just saying that it’s not about the lipstick.

735
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,540
I thought coming here

736
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,220
would help her, you know,

737
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,380
At least help her forget.

738
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,820
She’s not gonna forget.

739
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,040
But it’s safer here. It’s better.

740
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,660
Better for who?

741
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,120
I don’t know what to do.

742
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,140
She thinks you don’t listen to her.

743
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,340
I listen.

744
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,500
She’s unhappy.

745
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,840
She’s scared.

746
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,940
She just really needs her dad to listen to her.

747
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,960
Even if he doesn’t like what he’s hearing.

748
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,180
Thank you!

749
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,120
Sure!

750
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,900
I shouldn’t have kept your things packed up so long, huh.

751
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,620
I told her.

752
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,360
She’s gone.

753
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,120
Allison is gone.

754
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,920
She never got home last night.

755
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,440
No one can find her.

756
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,660
Don’t ever accept any rides

757
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,980
or gifts from strangers.

758
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,080
Don’t walk home alone.

759
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,740
And if you see anyone

760
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,660
that you don’t recognize,

761
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,620
please tell an adult you trust.

762
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,600
Did Allison run away?

763
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,100
Or is she kidnapped?

764
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:34,700
Michelle.

765
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,840
Did she die?

766
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,100
Michelle, That’s enough!

767
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,660
I’m here for my daughter. She has a dentist appointment.

768
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,040
No, I don’t!

769
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,320
Michelle, I’m not gonna tell you twice.

770
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,940
We have something right now.

771
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,000
- Let go!
- I have to go to the bathroom.

772
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,660
No! No! Class! YoBack to your seats.

773
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,260
Dad! Let go! You’re hurting me.

774
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,220
Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!

775
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,980
- Let go!
- Stop biting me. Go!

776
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,740
Let go!

777
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,120
Do you have something to tell me?

778
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,060
Do you have something to tell me??

779
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,880
I want my old things back.

780
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,540
Do you know what happened to that little girl?

781
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,240
Do you know what happened to her?

782
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,320
This is all your fault.

783
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,640
You hate me.

784
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,220
Get in. Get in.

785
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,900
No blue yet, huh?

786
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,640
What if they don’t find her?

787
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,620
They’re gonna find her.

788
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,640
Everything’s gonna be fine.

789
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,760
She’s probably went somewhere with her dad.

790
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,840
Maybe he took her on a trip and forgot to tell anybody.

791
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,480
Yeah. Maybe.

792
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,140
Something bad happened to her.

793
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,760
No. No. No.

794
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,480
Everything’s gonna be fine.

795
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,700
You already said that.

796
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,480
Bug, Let’s talk about something else, okay?

797
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,320
He’s trying to kill me.

798
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,260
He’s trying to kill me. Please help me.

799
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,160
Who did this, Michelle?

800
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,660
He wants me dead.

801
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,020
He’s always wanted me dead.

802
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,220
Who?

803
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,460
Daddy.

804
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,780
He did this to you?

805
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,000
You don’t believe me?

806
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,440
Of course, we believe you.

807
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,660
Then why aren’t you calling the police?

808
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,740
I know how he died.

809
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,400
What are you talking about?

810
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,760
Your brother, Dennis.

811
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,100
I saw him do it.

812
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,500
I saw daddy put the box in the ground.

813
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,060
That is not funny, Michelle.

814
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:58,480
Oh my God!

815
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,900
Where did you get this?

816
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,220
I’ll show you where he is.

817
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,640
No, stay here.

818
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,020
- No!
- Stay here.

819
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,940
[On the phone] I think so. I’m not...

820
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,000
Daddy, daddy. We gotta go!

821
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,280
[On the phone] I’m sorry, I got to go.

822
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:22,940
Up here.

823
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:38,820
It’s under here.

824
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:44,000
Abby, stop!

825
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,020
Poor little baby.

826
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,760
Oh my God!

827
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,640
Oh my God!

828
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,260
Poor little boy!

829
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,440
- Are they done yet?
- Yeah.

830
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,800
I always knew that this day would come.

831
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,380
I just didn’t think it would feel so meaningless, you know?

832
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,340
He was so close,

833
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,240
here all along.

834
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,340
It’s over now.

835
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,140
No!

836
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,000
No. It’s not over.

837
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,020
I want Steven Lowe to pay for what he did.

838
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:07,640
Abby,

839
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,080
You don’t know if he did it or not.

840
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:14,400
But Michelle said, she saw him put Dennis into the ground.

841
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,320
You know, she couldn’t have seen anything.

842
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,000
She wasn’t even born yet.

843
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,040
I want you to be my best friend again.

844
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,880
On the outside, they’re pretty ugly.

845
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:47,100
- But on the inside…
- They hurt themselves and blame other people.

846
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,060
Sometimes I feel like time is frozen and I can’t move.

847
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:52,140
- That’s Hazel Marie’s ball. It’s mine now.
- I like your necklace. Can I have it?

848
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,260
Please say “Yes”

849
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,140
Allison?

850
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,860
Don’t worry. You’ll be okay. Everything will be okay.

851
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,840
I can save you, I can save you.

852
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,840
Let us out, Let us out! Daddy, daddy!

853
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,560
Let us out! Daddy Daddy!!

854
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,320
[Music playing]

855
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,240
Daddy! Let us out! Daddy!! Daddy!

856
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:35,100
[Music playing]
- Daddy Help!

857
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,880
Help me please!

858
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,040
Daddy!

859
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,340
Daddy!

860
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:42,780
Rachel!

861
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,060
- Daddy!
- Rachel!

862
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,780
- Let us out!
- Can you hear me?

863
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,460
Help! Daddy! Daddy!

864
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,760
C'mon! Goddammit!

865
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,140
Let us out! Daddy!

866
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,580
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Rachel!

867
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,180
Hold on. Just hold on.

868
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,040
Are you okay?

869
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,060
C'mon,

870
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,240
Rachel?

871
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,140
C'mon, baby.

872
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,960
C’mon bug.

873
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,220
Rachel?

874
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,760
C’mon bug.

875
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,160
Rachel!

876
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,240
C'mon baby!

877
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:28,140
Mom?

878
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,740
Hi! It’s me.

879
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,680
Where’s daddy?

880
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,940
Oh, He went to get a cup of coffee. He’ll be back in a couple of minutes.

881
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,520
What happened to Allison?

882
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,640
Oh! She’s gonna be fine.

883
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,020
But how are you feeling?

884
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,100
Did she catch her?

885
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,140
Who?

886
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,300
Michelle.

887
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:46,880
You saw her?

888
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,620
She is a bad person inside of her.

889
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,600
Just lie back for a bit longer and close your eyes, okay?

890
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,620
There are bad people in this world.

891
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,440
I see them.

892
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,620
They live inside other people but I see them.

893
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,540
Honey, That’s just your imagination playing tricks on you.

894
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,960
No. I see Miranda inside of her.

895
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:10,500
Miranda Lowe is dead.

896
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,020
When good people die,

897
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,840
They go back to the place where they came from,

898
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:23,800
Back to the grass and trees and sky,

899
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:25,960
like mom.

900
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:27,840
She’s not here.

901
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,820
She’s not coming back.

902
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,760
But bad people stay.

903
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:37,780
I’m gonna get the nurse.

904
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:38,820
Abby.

905
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:41,520
What?

906
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,760
Miranda killed your brother, not Mr. Lowe.

907
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,080
Guess what, bug?

908
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:50,940
You can go home now.

909
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:52,660
They said you’re okay.

910
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,940
Do I have to talk to the sheriff?

911
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:56,580
Not today.

912
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,580
Lets get outta here, okay?

913
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:03,060
Please don’t let her come back for me.

914
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:04,840
You’re safe.

915
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,980
Nothing is gonna happen to you, I promise.

916
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,200
There are people who never really leave.

917
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,900
They just find somewhere else to go.

918
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,180
Hi.

919
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:46,760
How is she?

920
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,680
She still won’t open her eyes.

921
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,940
So, she hasn’t said anything yet?

922
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:58,480
Doctor says it’s some sort of a coping mechanism.

923
01:12:59,060 --> 01:12:59,680
I don’t know.

924
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,000
But she’s gonna be alright.

925
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,520
She lost some blood, not much.

926
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,920
Her cuts are infected.

927
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,800
Like little criss-crosses.

928
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,960
Like somebody was trying to scratch her.

929
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,740
I mean, who would do something like that?

930
01:13:59,080 --> 01:13:59,880
Mrs. Lowe?

931
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,640
Mrs. Lowe.

932
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,000
Mr. Lowe?

933
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,960
You think I killed him, don’t you?

934
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,740
- I thought you were…
- ... in jail?

935
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:44,820
Miranda

936
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,560
was the most perfect baby.

937
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,880
Do you remember her?

938
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,980
So beautiful.

939
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,240
Little ray of sunlight

940
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,800
before she got sick.

941
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:08,780
She...

942
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,120
suffered

943
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:12,480
so much,

944
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,260
like it was our fault

945
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,700
when she started acting out.

946
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,940
She started doing these terrible things.

947
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,900
We found her fish dead;

948
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,520
She killed the pets, hamster.

949
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,520
These weren’t accidents; she did it to be cruel.

950
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:44,840
She destroyed everything. Toys, pets, clothes,

951
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,040
she hurt other children.

952
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:53,960
But I wouldn’t let her be punished. She suffered enough.

953
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:11,960
Miranda?

954
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:13,740
Miranda!

955
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,080
Miranda, I told you to stay in the house,

956
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,420
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

957
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:26,880
No!!!

958
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,260
What did you do?

959
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,040
He was gone when I found him.

960
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,360
All I could think about was my little girl.

961
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,080
I had to protect her so

962
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,500
I put him in a box and I buried him.

963
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:00,680
Maybe I wanted someone to find him someday.
I don’t know…

964
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:06,420
I thought I could help her.

965
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:13,000
Nothing changed. I could see it in her eyes.

966
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,380
So full of hate.

967
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,840
One night, she got to Deborah, my angel.

968
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,100
Noooo!!!

969
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:32,500
I got you, I got you!

970
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,140
- No!
- I got you, I got you.

971
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,520
It’s okay. It’s okay. Are you all right? I got you. I got you...

972
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,840
Oh, God! Miranda? Sweetheart? Sweetie?

973
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,800
Nooo…Noooo...Nooo…

974
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,860
It was a mistake.

975
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,220
It was a horrible mistake…

976
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,580
And no one knew?

977
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,880
She been sick so long; it wasn’t hard to arrange.

978
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,660
And now, it’s happening again.

979
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,780
God is punishing us.

980
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:19,860
How are you feeling bug?

981
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:21,960
Are you all right?

982
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,540
What’s going to happen to Michelle?

983
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,300
She’ll be fine. Don’t worry.

984
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,540
Is she going to jail?

985
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,520
No. No, of course not.

986
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,260
Maybe she should.

987
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,880
Rachel! That’s not a very nice thing to say.

988
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,200
I could have helped them.

989
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:37,980
Who?

990
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,160
Mom and Hazel and Allison.

991
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,760
I see the people inside. They want to do bad things.

992
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,080
- I see Miranda inside of Michelle.
- Rachel.

993
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:54,140
Listen, We are gonna find some help, okay?

994
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,080
Whatever these thoughts are, we’re gonna make them go away.

995
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,740
You can’t make them go away!

996
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,280
Where is Michelle?

997
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:08,100
When she was little, she’d say the craziest things.

998
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,860
I want my room back, I want my things.

999
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:16,060
She played piano without ever taking a lesson. I mean, she knew things.

1000
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:17,160
Where is Michelle?

1001
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,540
She’s gone. Bernice took her.

1002
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:22,700
Where?

1003
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,460
I... I don’t know. Away.

1004
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,460
She thinks she can protect her.

1005
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,340
She thinks she can save her.

1006
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,260
From you?

1007
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:33,700
From everyone.

1008
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,000
From herself.

1009
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:45,260
It’s okay. It’s okay.

1010
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,160
Boo!

1011
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,300
It won’t hurt if you don’t move.

1012
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,780
This is mine now. Okay.

1013
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,180
We got into a car accident.

1014
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:45,140
My mom ran off the road.

1015
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,620
I think she might be dead like your mom.

1016
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,980
Are you afraid?

1017
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,540
You should be!

1018
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,040
Rachel!

1019
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:07,620
Michelle!

1020
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,120
Stop!

1021
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:19,920
Michelle, I said stop it.

1022
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,840
Michelle stop it.

1023
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,740
Just give me the knife.

1024
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,140
I do terrible things. Why?

1025
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:36,960
I don’t know.

1026
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,180
What am I?

1027
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:43,280
You’re a little girl.

1028
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,280
You’re a very good little girl.

1029
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:51,660
Oh, Michelle.

1030
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:10,700
What are you looking at?

1031
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,400
What do you see?

1032
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,240
Tell me what you see,

1033
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,380
Tell me what you see!

1034
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,500
I see what’s inside of you,

1035
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,480
I can see her.

1036
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:29,800
What’s wrong with me?

1037
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,240
You’re bad inside.

1038
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:34,560
But it’s not your fault.

1039
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,780
You don’t have to do this.

1040
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:38,560
You can fight her.

1041
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,140
Miranda’s bad, not you.

1042
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:43,520
I know it.

1043
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,440
You’re good Michelle.

1044
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,500
See, Miranda’s leaving.

1045
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,180
She's gone.

1046
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,900
- No! Don’t!
- Gaah...

1047
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,140
Oh, God!

1048
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,400
No…

1049
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:02,900
Rachel?

1050
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:04,460
Oh noh...

1051
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,540
Are you okay?

1052
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:09,160
Abby?

1053
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:10,780
Abby?

1054
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,260
- Wake up... wake up...
- Sweetie...

1055
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:16,780
Abby,

1056
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,800
Abby, hang in there.

1057
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:20,960
Just hang in there, okay?

1058
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,680
I’m sorry.

1059
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,620
Please forgive me.

1060
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:33,940
I’m sorry.

1061
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,680
Thank you so much.

1062
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,280
It’s okay bug.

1063
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:53,540
Rachel,

1064
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:56,660
do you want to tell me anything else about Michelle?

1065
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,200
Did she die?

1066
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,340
Daddy won’t tell me.

1067
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:04,620
She did.

1068
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,880
I could have helped them.

1069
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,080
None of these was your fault, Rachel.

1070
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,260
I didn’t say it was my fault.

1071
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:18,080
I just know what I see now.

1072
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,600
What’s that?

1073
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:22,540
Evil.

1074
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,140
Tell me about that.

1075
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,020
You can’t stop it by hurting other people.

1076
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,800
You can only stop it by knowing what’s inside.

1077
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,600
I could have helped her.

1078
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,200
I could have made her understand.

1079
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,780
Understand what?

1080
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:49,400
I want to be a doctor, like you.

1081
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,140
How do I do that?

1082
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:06,520
This was his favorite place to play.

1083
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,120
Are you gonna bury him here?

1084
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,100
No, He’ll be at the cemetery with mom and dad... and Gran.

1085
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,140
Daffodils are my favorite.

1086
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,000
They’re mine too.

1087
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:24,620
Hey, bug.

1088
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:27,820
Make a wish?

1089
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,800
Be careful. Make sure the wind doesn't...

1090
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,500
What’s wrong bug?

1091
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:12,840
Nothing.
