1
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:50,658
Being a policeman
is not what you see on TV.

2
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:54,098
I've never had to pick between
the red and blue wires.

3
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:59,469
Never seen a police car flip and cause
other cars to burst into flames.

4
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:04,773
Never had to jump across rooftops.
I investigate crimes, track leads...

5
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:10,715
...and sit in court. It's difficult,
tedious work, and you won't get rich.

6
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,855
But I've done it for 28 years.

7
00:01:14,057 --> 00:01:18,494
I'm a detective. That's what I do.
If you break the law...

8
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:22,791
...I'll do all I can to hunt you down
and put you behind bars.

9
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:27,198
I won't say that I succeed every time.

10
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:31,567
But I try to make sure that
if you do the crime, you'll do time.

11
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:33,265
Any questions?

12
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:42,314
Well, Detective Preston,
why don't you tell us about...

13
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,953
...the lighter side of police work?

14
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:48,287
You know. The fun days.

15
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,391
I chased him over three roofs.
You can't do this!

16
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:56,497
It's from the mayor.
You're a loose cannon.

17
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,566
-You destroyed a city block!
-He fired first.

18
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:01,134
I should read him his rights?

19
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:07,674
-You should've called for backup.
-My only backup is in a hospital bed!

20
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:16,016
His doctor called five minutes ago.
Jimmy didn't make it.

21
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,543
Oh, God.

22
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:25,851
Oh, God, no.

23
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,623
No!

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,226
-He was talking about getting out.
-It's hard.

25
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:36,802
He was like a brother to me, captain.

26
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:40,840
Since we was kids, we was partners.
We used to hang out...

27
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:44,605
...and dream about
being on the force together.

28
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:48,011
That was the dream.
Just two little Irish boys...

29
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:52,120
...fighting, scrapping,
thinking about making a difference.

30
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,381
God, I'm gonna miss him!

31
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:00,558
I'll need your gun
and your shield, Pete.

32
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:11,537
I may be off the force,
but I am not off this case!

33
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:16,772
-That's not in the script.
-I just threw that in at the end.

34
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,212
-I thought I should get the last line.
-Nailed it!

35
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:24,876
Trey, it was great. Very believable.

36
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:28,649
-But I'm not married to it.
-You can't fix perfect.

37
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,553
We have imaginations.

38
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,623
Thanks. We'll call you.

39
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,161
-You got my number.
-Right here.

40
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,697
-Moved to tears. Bye-bye.
-Take care.

41
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,926
-You too.
-Restroom on the left.

42
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:43,639
-Don't give up the day job.
-Unless it's acting.

43
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:51,379
1L 43, clear from code 7.

44
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,210
Roger, 1L 43.
Hope you had a nice lunch.

45
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:51,400
Getting ready to break my old score.

46
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,217
Gonna break my old record!

47
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:09,955
Now I get my grades in kills.

48
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:16,659
Just broke it!
I got the top 10 spots now!

49
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:22,327
-Anybody want to take on the Ice Trey?
-Way to lay down the law, Top Cop.

50
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:09,240
-How you doing?
-What's up?

51
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:16,483
-Mitchie Mitch! How's it going, man?
-This is a friend of mine. Rich guy.

52
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:20,423
-How you doing?
-I'm all right.

53
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:33,399
Requesting assistance, possible 211 at
the TV repair shop on 1st and Santee.

54
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,473
Maxis Network Channel 3 chopper.

55
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:42,174
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Something going down at 1st and Santee.

56
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,921
This is Maxis Mobile One.
We're on our way.

57
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,086
A quick left, quick right.

58
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,122
All day.

59
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,462
-We got a couple of big spenders.
-Don't get up for us.

60
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,413
You all want to do something?

61
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:17,177
Yeah, we were wondering
if maybe you'd throw in a free set.

62
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:20,321
Two free sets.
One for him, one for me.

63
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:28,186
What's in the bag?

64
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,995
-Let's do it.
-All right.

65
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:56,481
It's all here.

66
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,353
-All good?
-Good to go.

67
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:01,254
Good. So you show us yours.

68
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,298
Don't look, now.

69
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,063
Touchdown.

70
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,844
-Check the metal detector's batteries.
-How about that, Re?

71
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:45,367
Thirsty?

72
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:47,907
A lifesaver.

73
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:52,643
That's some pretty high-quality shit.

74
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:55,681
All right. So we're on, right?

75
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:04,049
What the hell is this?

76
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,792
-What the hell is going on?
-Wait. Hold on.

77
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:10,659
-This some police shit?
-What?

78
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:15,997
-You brought the police back here?
-Take it easy!

79
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:20,039
-Don't tell me to take it easy!
-Don't tell me to shut up.

80
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:23,235
You better calm your punk ass down!

81
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,710
Stop pointing that shit at me!

82
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,014
-Put that away.
-You think it's a game?

83
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,646
Put the gun away.

84
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:37,624
See, it's gone.
It's all over. Let's go. Come on.

85
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:46,162
Let's wrap it up.
I don't want them coming back.

86
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,597
All right.

87
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,471
What the hell is going on?

88
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:58,477
-Shit, we on Channel 5!
-I'm gonna blast these fools!

89
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,838
-What was that, a bazooka?
-You shot the wrong brother.

90
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,346
-I'll find the guy with the cannon.
-Hands behind your back.

91
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:39,386
I'm calling Johnnie Cochran.
I got his number. You're going down.

92
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:42,254
Okay, showtime.

93
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:46,822
Stop, police!

94
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:02,172
Okay, round two, baby.

95
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,874
-Freeze! L.A.P.D.!
-Undercover narcotics!

96
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,574
-Drop it!
-We got an officer-involved shooting!

97
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:15,382
Put your weapon down, right now!
Right now! Down!

98
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,390
Good job, officer!

99
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:34,476
-Smile for the camera, Ice Trey.
-Get back here! You're under arrest!

100
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,541
Turn that shit off!
Turn that shit off!

101
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:53,123
Out of my way! Police officer!

102
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,493
Look out!

103
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,476
Get that camera out of here!

104
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,415
-Are you okay?
-It went through my vest.

105
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,615
-We need an R.A. unit. Get away!
-I'm staying.

106
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:28,092
-Get the goddamn camera out of here.
-I'm just doing my job.

107
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,723
What are you doing?

108
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,795
Get a real job.

109
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:40,537
Talk to us.
Give us some information, something.

110
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,877
-Have a statement?
-Don't break the police tape.

111
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,380
-We have a right--
-To keep on the other side.

112
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:54,249
Aren't you the cop who got busted
with his own cuffs?

113
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:57,051
Think an officer doing his job
is funny?

114
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:01,525
Let's see how funny it is
when I move this tape back 20 feet.

115
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,597
-He'll be a Bloopers classic.
-Get B-roll.

116
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,794
Come over the tape, you'll get B-roll
of me kicking your ass down to Sunset.

117
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,074
-Detective Preston!
-Detective Preston!

118
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:19,974
-Why did you shoot the camera?
-Are you a loose cannon?

119
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,246
What happened?.

120
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:32,489
-Give me all you got.
-Brad?

121
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,128
Hi, Chase. Go.

122
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,323
I have the show to pull your
network from the ratings toilet.

123
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,867
-You can do public executions?
-Meet Mitch Preston.

124
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:47,033
-You know I don't read.
-Look at the pictures. Annie.

125
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,076
Get that f***ing thing out of here!

126
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,439
What was that?

127
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,874
"Detective Preston
destroys Maxis TV camera."

128
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,076
-That's ours.
-"Rogue cop guns down camera."

129
00:13:58,287 --> 00:13:59,720
-We can sue.
-Exactly.

130
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,287
He's Dirty Harry, he's real
and we've got him by the balls.

131
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,259
I see where you're going with this.
A reality show.

132
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,566
-How is it different than Cops?
-Did you see?

133
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,667
He's a modern-day cowboy.

134
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:18,101
He's sexy, volatile. He's a bad boy,
and women love bad boys.

135
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:21,299
-He could frisk me.
-You like getting frisked?

136
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,168
Brad, focus. Want to see it again
in slow motion?

137
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,679
-I get the point. Shit!
-What?

138
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:32,217
-I was outbid for an A-Team lunch box.
-Okay, Brad.

139
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:37,687
-So we've got this Mitch Preston?
-We're with him 24 hours a day.

140
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:42,762
Because he's gonna blow again,
and when he does, we'll be there.

141
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:45,896
If he makes a lot of arrests,
he gets a prize?

142
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,535
-Who gets the prize?
-This isn't a game show.

143
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:53,698
This is one man, on his own,
kicking ass and taking names.

144
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:59,105
-Can we give him a partner?
-That's a good idea.

145
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:04,576
-We'll give him a funny-minority type.
-That'll get the NAACP off my back.

146
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:07,915
-Or is it the NCAA?
-Do we have a deal?

147
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,489
-Fine, go make a pilot.
-No, Brad.

148
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:13,787
This guy isn't a pilot, he's a series.

149
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,261
Trust me.
I'll stake my entire reputation on it.

150
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,329
What reputation? You still get shit
for faking the flammable pajama story.

151
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,303
You can't tell me that wasn't good TV.

152
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:31,172
Are you in or out? I'm pitching
this at Fox in half an hour.

153
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,938
-I'll give a six-episode commitment.
-Yes!

154
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,349
But if it's all pit stops at Krispy
Kreme, I'm pulling the plug...

155
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:44,185
-...and you're out of a job.
-We'll all be out of a job.

156
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:48,193
What do they teach you in China?
Let's go. Bring it on.

157
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:51,359
-You rocked!
-We're screwed.

158
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:55,799
-We know nothing about these shows.
-There are rules.

159
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:59,839
Call L.A.P.D. and get clearances.
And find a cameraman.

160
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,409
-Is Julio out of traction?
-I'll call the hospital.

161
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:09,050
-What if our Dirty Harry says no?
-Everybody wants to be on TV.

162
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:20,861
10-36. It looks like the stolen cuffs
were an inside job.

163
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,497
That's very funny, guys.

164
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,892
Very funny. Very well-written.

165
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:36,672
What are you reading,
the Jenny Craig newsletter?

166
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,872
FYI, my friend,
a lot of this is muscle.

167
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:44,882
It's a flyer for some new
reality-TV cop show.

168
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:55,523
-I got to be part of this.
-Thought you wanted to be a detective.

169
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:58,632
I'm a cop
and I'm a professional actor.

170
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:03,897
Your career consists of a few lines
on an episode of Diagnosis Murder.

171
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,366
All I need is the right part
and I'll get my big break.

172
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:12,604
Know how old Sam Jackson was
when he got his break? He was 42.

173
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:17,377
Okay, but he's got, gosh,
what's that thing called? Talent.

174
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:21,784
I'm talented. I ain't no Sam Jackson,
but I'm talented.

175
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,427
Your partner will be Mitch Preston.
We know who'd wear the cuffs there.

176
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,560
He nailed the other lead?

177
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:32,393
He's front-page news.
Everybody's talking about him.

178
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:35,968
I'd blow his old ass off the screen
every night.

179
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,401
You crazy? Mitch Preston, please!

180
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:42,065
I said, "Do you wanna take your feet
off the desk?"

181
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:46,604
Get your feet off the desk.
Where's Lazy Boy?

182
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,512
My client's taking the Fifth.
He's the victim here.

183
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:56,047
Got yourself a pricey lawyer.
Had to sell a lot of TVs for that.

184
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:59,694
-Who's paying?
-That's privileged information.

185
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,989
The captain needs to see you
when you're done.

186
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:07,225
He's done. Come on, ReRun.
This interview is over.

187
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:11,463
-We don't talk, we walk.
-For now.

188
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:18,308
-Do you want me to start filming?
-Yeah, everything you see. Perfect.

189
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,113
Oh, my God.

190
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,951
This place is so depressing.
It looks like a tomb.

191
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,145
Well, you wanted reality.

192
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,553
We need a reality change.
This is hideous.

193
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:36,295
I'm not doing it.
Let them follow somebody else.

194
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:40,298
They don't want anyone else.
You the man of the hour.

195
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:44,939
-All I did was shoot a video camera.
-You made us look like savages.

196
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,234
-The network is suing for $10 million.
-What?

197
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:52,174
They said you could have killed
their cameraman.

198
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,576
Maybe I should have killed him.

199
00:18:55,284 --> 00:19:00,551
The chief already cut the deal.
Do the show, and they drop the suit.

200
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:03,815
What?
That's extortion! They can't do that.

201
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:08,429
We need good PR.
Community relations are in the toilet.

202
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,363
-You the best detective we got.
-So, what about this big gun?

203
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:18,529
Am I supposed to let them follow me
around while I track down the weapon?

204
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:23,210
-Look, I did an episode of Cops once.
-You did an episode of Cops?

205
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,404
You forget the camera is even there.

206
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:31,712
-This is real work. I'm not an actor.
-No one is saying you can't work.

207
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:37,520
But you screwed up. And now
you've got to play ball. End of story.

208
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:43,625
You'll be reporting
to the show's producer, Chase Renzi.

209
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:46,767
Chase Renzi? Is that a real name?

210
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:51,003
I won't take orders from some
coked-out Hollywood dickhead.

211
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:53,902
Not in a million years.
That I won't do.

212
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:57,543
That's good,
because she doesn't have a dick.

213
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:03,080
Check her out for yourself.
She's outside, waiting for you.

214
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,291
Well. Better looking than I thought.

215
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:17,759
We gotta bring in color, some light.
Do you think these windows move?

216
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:20,766
Detective Preston, hi.

217
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,029
I can see you're busy.
We'll talk tomorrow.

218
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:26,036
He's not very friendly.

219
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:29,574
Find out where he eats.
Make a reservation for two.

220
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:44,058
-Here you go, cover boy.
-Thanks.

221
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,356
Detective Preston, Chase Renzi.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

222
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:53,193
-How you doing?
-Good. I see you've already ordered.

223
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:57,361
-Make it quick, I have work to do.
-What can I get you?

224
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:01,598
Same as him. A cheeseburger, rare,
fries and a Coke.

225
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,844
-Diet?
-Regular.

226
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:09,608
So, Detective Preston....
Can I call you Mitch?

227
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:14,881
Why don't I just launch
into a few basic questions...

228
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,686
-...and find out what makes you tick.
-I don't tick.

229
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:23,526
-Sure you do. Everybody ticks.
-Not me.

230
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,292
Tell me about yourself.
You have a girlfriend, a wife?

231
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:30,903
-Ex-wife.
-Ex-wife.

232
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,336
Was it a painful divorce?

233
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:38,345
I only ask because I was divorced,
and I know it can be difficult.

234
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,242
I mean, did you drink?

235
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:45,113
Lady, I'm here because my captain
made me. I had no choice.

236
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,915
I have no interest in you,
your questions or your show.

237
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:53,422
Not only do I understand
your resistance, I appreciate it.

238
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,524
You do, huh? Good.

239
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:01,135
I'm not into making the same bullshit
cop show we've seen a million times.

240
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:05,966
That's why I believe if we're honest
and open with each other...

241
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:09,109
...we could do something
very special here.

242
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:12,640
I don't know
what you're talking about.

243
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:16,443
-I'm talking about reality, Mitch.
-There you go.

244
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:19,879
Letting the world find out
who you really are.

245
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:24,656
You're looking for loose cannon,
cop-on-the-edge Serpico bullshit.

246
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,795
I'm telling you,
you're wasting your time.

247
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:31,591
See that anger, Mitch?

248
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,094
It's working for you.

249
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:37,635
The audience will connect
with that in a major way.

250
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,770
I'm out of here.

251
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:43,578
I'll call you later
to discuss your new partner.

252
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:47,713
Want that in a doggy bag?

253
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:52,915
No.
Thanks, though. It was delicious.

254
00:22:57,192 --> 00:23:01,026
-How did it go? Is he intense?
-I need cherry Tums, quick.

255
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:05,757
-Is he psyched about the show?
-It may be harder than I thought.

256
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,967
-Hey!
-You son of a bitch!

257
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:16,502
Freeze! L.A.P.D.!

258
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,018
Wait! Wait!

259
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,736
Bad idea. I only got two things
bigger than my mouth.

260
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:50,468
One of them is pointed at your head.

261
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,147
-You want to do this the hard way?
-I'll stick you, pig!

262
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:13,098
-Okay, officer. You nice with yours.
-You damn right.

263
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:18,466
If your boys want to know who put the
smack down on you, my badge is 38723.

264
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,369
I go by the name of Trey Sellars,
patrolman.

265
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:37,053
-I believe this belongs to you, ma'am.
-Chase Renzi. That was incredible.

266
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:41,690
Just doing my job, like the badge
says, protecting and serving.

267
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,526
-Get this psycho off me!
-What's with the Superfly shit?

268
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,226
-I got the situation in hand.
-Top Cop, how you doing?

269
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:50,961
This is my collar.

270
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:54,006
Never leave a suspect
who's not cuffed.

271
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:57,007
-He could've had a gun.
-Nobody got no gun.

272
00:24:57,212 --> 00:25:01,205
Trey, I think you broke a rib.
Tell him to get the cuffs off.

273
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:04,145
I told you I can't do handcuffs.

274
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:07,219
Quiet!
You have the right to remain silent!

275
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:09,547
-You know each other?
-No.

276
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,727
Never seen him before.
Just another criminal.

277
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:17,126
Bullshit. We took a stage combat class
together last fall.

278
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:18,629
Nice try, pal.

279
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:22,428
He's just trying to weasel
his way out of the crime.

280
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:26,198
-That's what he's doing.
-He looks like a real menace.

281
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:27,807
Who wants to explain?

282
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:32,343
Trey said he'd give me $50 if I
snatched the lady's purse and ran.

283
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:35,607
He'd pull up in his police car,
jump out...

284
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:38,980
...chase me up a fence,
beat me down, kick me--

285
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:41,121
All right, all right. Okay.

286
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,125
I set the whole thing up.
It was a big setup.

287
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:50,357
I set it up to make it look
like I was....

288
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:54,194
-I was auditioning to get this part.
-What part?

289
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:56,962
Your partner.
We've been interviewing.

290
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:59,037
It won't be this moron.

291
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:02,074
I should report you
for impersonating a cop.

292
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:07,876
Put a lock on that "moron" shit.
Why you take everything so seriously?

293
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,052
You should be protecting,
not staging crimes.

294
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:13,653
-Someone could've got hurt.
-Like me.

295
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:17,120
I'm learning from a guy
who shot a news camera?

296
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:21,318
You got the part already.
I'm just trying to spruce it up.

297
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:25,795
-That's what you normally do at work.
-Better watch your mouth.

298
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,528
What are you gonna do,
wrap me up in caution tape?

299
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,240
No, I ain't gonna wrap you up
in caution tape.

300
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:40,347
But I'll tell you, punk, I might whip
your ass up and down the parking lot.

301
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:44,849
Work on your Starsky and Hutch
routine on your own time.

302
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:48,511
You better walk off.
I was getting ready to slap you.

303
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:51,248
-He's a disgrace.
-You'd work with him?

304
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,256
Never in a million years.

305
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,729
-I think we have good chemistry.
-Riveting.

306
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:03,403
-Amazing.
-Really?

307
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:06,398
Thank you. All right.

308
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,474
The guy's a joke.
There's no way I'll work with him.

309
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,876
I don't want to hear it.
Shit, come on.

310
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,373
Thanks.

311
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,754
You're doing this. That's an order.

312
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:26,886
Trapped in the jaws, he struggled.

313
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:32,222
You'll never see no brothers
messing with no sharks.

314
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:33,423
Never.

315
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,730
Hello?

316
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:46,209
I saw you on TV,
shooting up the neighborhood.

317
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,517
What's going on, Vargas?
I was trying to call you, dog.

318
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,779
Oh, yeah?

319
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:58,618
I got cell phones, call waiting,
e-mail, voice mail...

320
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:01,762
...and I haven't heard una chingada
from you.

321
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,658
It ain't like that, dog.

322
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:07,631
I laying low till everything
dies down. It got crazy.

323
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:10,270
And did I say you could use my gun?

324
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,737
You know, Lazy Boy, I trusted you.

325
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,175
And you let me down.

326
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:20,178
And now you put
my entire shipment at risk.

327
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,482
You used that gun
without my permission.

328
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:30,783
We don't want that getting
into the wrong hands, do we now?

329
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:38,622
No, I was just borrowing it.
Just testing it out, you know?

330
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:45,195
-And how did it work?
-Real good. I got it right here.

331
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:51,636
So we cool, right?

332
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:57,617
-Yeah. We cool.
-I'm sorry about--

333
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:02,448
Don't worry. We cool, Lazy Boy. Okay?

334
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,351
-We're cool.
-All right.

335
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:08,289
You two have a nice night. Okay?

336
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,986
All right.

337
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:21,034
What the hell was that all about?

338
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:26,771
What the hell?

339
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:34,985
-What's that?
-Stop playing this shit, man.

340
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:37,880
Get down!

341
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:28,272
Freeze! L.A.P.D.

342
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:33,609
What do I do?

343
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,840
Cut, cut, cut, cut. Cut.

344
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,719
Let's do it again.

345
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:40,612
Freeze! L.A.P.D.

346
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,089
That how he's doing it?

347
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,523
I'm laying my shit out.
Freeze! L.A.P.D. That shit is right.

348
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,754
Ready?

349
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,623
Patrolling your area at Friday....

350
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,458
Friday night at 8. Eight.

351
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,997
Patrolling every Friday at 8.

352
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,640
Yeah, good, and be happy.

353
00:31:00,842 --> 00:31:02,935
Why should I? I'm patrolling.

354
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:06,477
You're happy because
you're patrolling.

355
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:08,205
Keeping it safe, Mitch.

356
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:10,883
Patrolling every Friday at night.

357
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:13,210
Every Friday night at 8.

358
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:21,055
This guy is the worst actor
I have ever seen.

359
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:26,462
-Get out.
-Wait a minute, hold it, cut, cut.

360
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:30,365
Mitch, you can't just
toss a cameraman aside.

361
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:35,566
Give me a pad, I'll show you
how a TV cop comes through the door.

362
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,370
The doors fly open.

363
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,107
They fly open. You burst in.
You scan the room.

364
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:46,811
You do the turn, toss yourself around.
And now! You're set and--

365
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:50,013
But don't turn your head
too far from camera.

366
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:55,025
That little lady is your lover. Don't
respect her, she won't respect you.

367
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:58,426
-Always know where she is.
-She's in my way.

368
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:01,727
What's wrong?
You're getting tips from T.J. Hooker.

369
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:05,337
Which is the most underrated show
in history.

370
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,237
-Nobody came through a door like you.
-Thank you.

371
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:12,971
-This guy is no detective.
-I'm playing a detective.

372
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,843
-I'm playing detective.
-All right, guys.

373
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,177
-I'm playing a detective.
-Okay.

374
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:21,380
Let's go do some hood-jumping.

375
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,012
What's that?

376
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:27,217
-What do you think? We jump over hoods.
-Something you'd know.

377
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:28,985
Freeze!

378
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:34,992
That was great, Trey.
Beautiful. That was really great.

379
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:40,368
-Okay, Mitch. Come here.
-I'm not going on the hood of a car.

380
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,600
-What do you mean?
-Forget it.

381
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:47,144
I entertained viewers everywhere
in the '80s, jumping on car hoods.

382
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:50,806
One of a TV cop's greatest weapons.
I'll show you.

383
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:56,981
You gotta stop them, see? Halt!
And you throw your body. Halt!

384
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,692
You okay, T.J.?

385
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:08,991
Moving on.

386
00:33:09,303 --> 00:33:10,861
Who stole the money?

387
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,471
Deep in thought.

388
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:16,474
Now the eyebrows arch,
ever so slightly.

389
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:19,408
And Hooker solves another case.

390
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:23,641
Okay? All right, Trey, you try it.
Go ahead. Ready?

391
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:26,678
-Get loose now. Loosen up. Ready?
-Yeah.

392
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,581
Trey, who stole the money?

393
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:35,128
Good. You nailed it, first take.
Give me five. That was good!

394
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:39,026
Okay, Mitch.
Come on, show me some magic.

395
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,758
Mitch, who stole the money?

396
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:46,203
Look at that, Trey. Look.

397
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:49,535
Look at the anger in his eyes.
Look at that.

398
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:53,907
See that slight squint says,
"Hey, I'm Mitch. I'm the man.

399
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,440
Don't mess with me."

400
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,419
Okay. Let's taste some drugs.

401
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:04,183
Hooker's got a bag
of white powder in his hand.

402
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:07,293
Spears it open with a pocketknife.

403
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:10,628
Takes his little pinkie...

404
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,823
...in the powder.

405
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:17,404
And he touches it,
gently, on his tongue.

406
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:20,631
Watch the eyebrows.

407
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:23,304
Hooker knows it's cocaine.

408
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:25,512
What if it's cyanide?

409
00:34:29,784 --> 00:34:34,312
Hello? Hold on. There's a reason
real cops don't taste drugs, Bill.

410
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:36,785
It's never cyanide.

411
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,426
Show me the thing with your eyebrow.

412
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:41,925
-Okay, I'm on my way.
-It's tricky.

413
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:46,529
-Where are you going?
-I gotta wash this shit out of my hair.

414
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:50,329
We have some action?
We have some action, finally.

415
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:04,047
-Beep, beep!
-Hey, Mitch.

416
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:07,381
-What'd you do to my car?
-We added micro cameras.

417
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:12,049
In the wheel, the glove compartment
and a crook-cam in the back.

418
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:14,922
-Pretend they're not there.
-Pretend.

419
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:19,931
-See? You're catching on already.
-We'll be right behind you in the van.

420
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:22,625
You'll be right behind me?

421
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:32,140
What are you doing?

422
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:36,249
I'm on the case. I'm your partner.
We're together.

423
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,516
Unbelievable.

424
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,182
What's the mean face for?

425
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,582
Listen. Don't speak, listen.

426
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:48,024
There's a few things
I need to tell you.

427
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,662
First of all, you gotta know
that I got your back covered...

428
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:55,563
...and I gotta know
you got mine covered.

429
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,896
No doubt.

430
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:02,270
When we're on the job you're
the only person I can depend on.

431
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:05,640
Not friends, family,
not anybody, just you.

432
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:06,802
You got that?

433
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:10,007
That's important.
There's no other way.

434
00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:12,652
And it's gotta start right now.

435
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:19,521
You know, ever since I was 8,
I wanted to be a cop.

436
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:23,058
I wanted to be on the force
like Uncle Reggie.

437
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,995
He was the first in the family
on the force. Big muscles.

438
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:28,293
Uncle Reggie.

439
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,303
He used to let me ride
in the squad car with him.

440
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:35,465
Once he let me play with the siren.
From then on...

441
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:38,009
...I knew I was gonna be a cop.

442
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:39,770
Uncle Reggie.

443
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,114
Yeah.

444
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,481
My uncle--

445
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:50,088
Uncle Reggie passed away
two years ago.

446
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:53,091
He got caught in the line
of some fire.

447
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:58,120
Didn't slow me down.
I remember how he set me on my way.

448
00:36:58,332 --> 00:37:02,428
He's looking down on me
from a big precinct in the sky.

449
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:08,075
He's thinking, "You've done all right,
Trey. You've done right by me."

450
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:14,045
What does that
got to do with anything?

451
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:18,275
-You got a speech, so I get a speech.
-That wasn't a speech.

452
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,148
That "I'm your partner."
That was a speech.

453
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,016
You burned up 90 seconds of air.
That was a speech.

454
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:29,356
When we get to the crime scene,
stay out of my way.

455
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,328
This isn't studio shit.
This is real.

456
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,041
-Get your camera out of here.
-Hey, watch it.

457
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:44,803
Julio has to shoot. That's the show.

458
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:47,470
He's done Jerry Springer.

459
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,708
That's right. Whatever you need,
I'm there.

460
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:56,084
If I get shot, stabbed, it's cool.
Whatever. I'm getting good footage.

461
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,851
Just remember three words:
Go to Trey.

462
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,153
-I'm Trey.
-Julio.

463
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,525
-You worked on Springer?
-Springer, Girls Gone Wild.

464
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:07,724
Get that camera out of here.
Who's in the bag?

465
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:09,197
We don't know yet.

466
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:12,531
Whoever shot him didn't care
for open caskets.

467
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,698
Thinking what I'm thinking?

468
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,706
I seriously doubt it.

469
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:20,845
I'm thinking there's dirty
cops on the streets...

470
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,540
...cleaning the streets up
on they own terms, partner.

471
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:27,983
This is payback for a drug deal
gone sour.

472
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:30,889
Whoever this guy worked for
got pissed.

473
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:34,822
Even better. This is a bad guy
retribution scenario.

474
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:37,998
Good thinking, partner.
Good thinking.

475
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:43,394
I think I can identify
one of the victims.

476
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,703
Those are 12-gauge, armor-piercing
uranium shells.

477
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:51,435
-Charlie.
-Hey, Mitchell.

478
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:55,343
I found explosive and incendiary
rounds scattered around.

479
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,950
The same gun that put holes
in your TV repair shop.

480
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,750
It appears to be hand-held, automatic,
with interchangeable magazines.

481
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,688
Technically, this gun doesn't exist.

482
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,761
-What do you mean?
-This gun is like the 50-foot shark.

483
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,364
Speak English.

484
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:15,535
It's out there,
but nobody's ever seen it.

485
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,265
Any idea who made it?

486
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:23,868
It's a custom job. My guess is,
it's out of Eastern Europe.

487
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,770
-Thanks, Charlie. Keep your eyes open.
-You bet.

488
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,250
-What are you doing?
-Take it easy.

489
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:40,393
-You're not supposed to touch.
-I didn't. I turned it over.

490
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:43,359
-Let me know when you touch--
-I don't have to--

491
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:47,125
-What's going on?
-He's contaminating my crime scene.

492
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:50,132
I'm doing a sweep of the area.

493
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:54,967
You never know where a crucial
bit of evidence may be hiding.

494
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:57,510
Like this, for instance.

495
00:39:57,711 --> 00:40:02,239
Did anybody think to pull some prints
off this water bottle?

496
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,845
Can I get an evidence bag?

497
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:08,544
Put down my water.
I'm not finished drinking it.

498
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,288
That's an honest mistake.

499
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:17,692
You got your water amongst potential
evidence so I thought it was....

500
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:21,197
Hey, T.J., go solve the case
somewhere else.

501
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:23,526
Don't give me orders,
I'm your partner!

502
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:26,103
No, you're not,
I partner with real cops.

503
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,670
-Get me a copy of that report.
-All right, Mitch.

504
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,302
Well, I am your partner,
so you better accept that.

505
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:34,946
I am your partner!

506
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:42,713
He won't open up. You know how hard
it is to work with somebody like that?

507
00:40:42,923 --> 00:40:48,156
I know. Mitch has been a lot
more resistant than I'd hoped for.

508
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,854
I think that you and Mitch
need some bonding time.

509
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:54,026
You're right. We do.

510
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:59,366
We need some QT time together.
Two guys hanging out, have some beers.

511
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,566
I'll call to see
if he wants to hang out.

512
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,608
Let's not call him.
Let's just go over.

513
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,345
-Just show up?
-Surprise him.

514
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:13,577
What are you doing?

515
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:17,584
How hard is it to say,
"Hi, Trey, nice to see you"?

516
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:20,055
Hi, Trey. What are you doing here?

517
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:23,355
We got off on the wrong foot.
I got some food.

518
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,533
We can eat the food and bond a bit.

519
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:29,069
-Bond?
-Yeah.

520
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,431
How'd you get my address?

521
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:34,831
-Hi, Mitch.
-Oh, shit.

522
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,770
-Yeah.
-I gave it to him.

523
00:41:36,977 --> 00:41:40,276
-Will you invite us in? Don't be rude.
-Do I have to?

524
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:44,140
You got us out in the hall
like a Jehovah's Witness.

525
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:47,115
I gotta see where my star cop lives.

526
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:48,949
Come on, Mitch.

527
00:41:50,457 --> 00:41:53,392
-Oh, my God.
-Mitch...!

528
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,662
Nice.

529
00:41:57,865 --> 00:42:01,961
Got a little smell to it.
Not a stinky smell, an odd one.

530
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:03,431
What is that smell?

531
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,198
Is this here your actual living area?

532
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:12,039
This is my Batcave. A tunnel
in the garage leads to my mansion.

533
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,112
What's the problem?

534
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:21,084
Research tells us buddy cops
live in visually distinctive places.

535
00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:26,955
Like a trailer on the beach or
a loft downtown. That kind of thing.

536
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,654
Your research shows that, huh?
Where does he live?

537
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:34,134
I rent a guesthouse from a producer.

538
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,168
-Kind of gives off a Magnum vibe.
-Totally.

539
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:41,398
It's unique. You know what, Mitch?
We can make this work.

540
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:44,108
Did a crackhead make this cup?

541
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:49,241
-It's not visually exciting enough?
-No. It's just--

542
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,915
The point is to let the audience
in on all aspects of your life.

543
00:42:55,122 --> 00:43:00,059
They want to spend time in a place
that speaks to your personality.

544
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:03,025
This does speak to my personality.

545
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:07,594
Mitch, I think you need some time
away from the job.

546
00:43:07,968 --> 00:43:10,698
I just found the crackhead's shop.

547
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:12,933
Hey, don't go in there.

548
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:16,076
This is what you smell
all over the place.

549
00:43:16,277 --> 00:43:19,508
Wow, a pottery studio!

550
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:23,205
You're full of surprises.
How long you been doing this?

551
00:43:23,384 --> 00:43:27,582
-Six years, give or take.
-You really got a knack for it.

552
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:30,689
This room's off-limits.
It's not for show.

553
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:33,189
Okay, Mitch.

554
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:36,454
We haven't done any bonding
at all yet.

555
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,526
Bond with yourself, I got work to do.

556
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,138
Hey!

557
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:48,595
Check this out.

558
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,704
Must be some Hollywood dickhead.

559
00:45:44,558 --> 00:45:48,517
-Not bad, huh?
-A cop never slides across the hood.

560
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:53,928
-Why? It's not police procedure?
-Your holster scratches the paint.

561
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,470
Nice.

562
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,641
They can buff that shit out.

563
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:08,972
-I'm trying for detective.
-You take the exam?

564
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:12,175
-Twice.
-And you think you won't fail again?

565
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,547
Now I'm working with Mitch Preston.

566
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:19,624
Give me some tips, and I'll tip you
on how to look better on camera.

567
00:46:19,827 --> 00:46:24,594
-Tips like what?
-You wear plaids, like fishermen.

568
00:46:24,798 --> 00:46:28,894
That's ugly shit. Wear solids.
You look slimmer on camera.

569
00:46:29,336 --> 00:46:32,328
-I'll keep that in mind.
-Got any tips for me?

570
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:36,067
Yeah, stay out of my way
and I won't shoot you.

571
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:40,213
What the hell's going on?

572
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:45,249
Welcome to America's window
on your world.

573
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:47,275
What is this?

574
00:46:47,454 --> 00:46:51,481
-We made your workspace camera-ready.
-My work space?

575
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:56,095
I think it captures the reality
of an inner-city precinct.

576
00:46:56,296 --> 00:46:58,662
Is this where you do the makeup?

577
00:46:58,832 --> 00:47:03,531
No. This is good. You have to see it.
Mitch, you have to see this.

578
00:47:04,104 --> 00:47:08,063
-Look at your desk. It's so beautiful.
-Is this my desk?

579
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:12,712
That's your desk. And that's yours,
Mitch. We didn't change it.

580
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,416
But this is a confessional. All right?

581
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,710
Talk about anything you want.

582
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,683
You can talk about the job,
each other...

583
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:26,383
...your sex lives. I mean,
only if you want to. Direct to camera.

584
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:30,723
-No, thanks.
-You could put a pottery wheel there.

585
00:47:30,964 --> 00:47:34,365
Look, Mitch, this is an integral
part of the show.

586
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:38,197
You're obligated to spend
five minutes a day in here.

587
00:47:38,405 --> 00:47:42,705
We've provided a chair.
All you have to do is sit and share.

588
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:45,936
-Share?
-Learn how to turn on your heart light.

589
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:47,807
-Exactly.
-Chase!

590
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:50,609
Brad loves the promo footage.

591
00:47:50,817 --> 00:47:55,481
-But they need a catch phrase.
-I got one. "I wish I was dead."

592
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,257
You need a catch phrase? I got it.

593
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:03,789
-When I'm about to make a bust--
-When did you ever make a bust?

594
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,689
Don't tell me.

595
00:48:05,866 --> 00:48:09,859
When I'm about to make a bust,
to get in the moment...

596
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:15,906
...I take three deep breaths and say to
myself, "Okay, Trey, it's showtime!"

597
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:18,407
-You say that?
-That's stupid.

598
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:20,705
-What's stupid about it?
-Know what?

599
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:23,042
Don't say it, please.

600
00:48:23,216 --> 00:48:26,947
No, I have to say it, Mitch.
"Showtime." It's amazing.

601
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:32,956
-That could be the name of our show!
-See? It's not stupid. It's perfect.

602
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:35,620
Say it again for the camera.

603
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:40,596
Do it again with the breathing.
My God, you're a natural.

604
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:43,191
It's showtime!

605
00:48:58,118 --> 00:49:03,556
This is Harley Barley taking calls
from fans of the new series Showtime.

606
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:07,716
Let's go to Pete from Idaho.
You're on the air.

607
00:49:07,928 --> 00:49:11,091
I wanted to say to Mitch,
I know how you feel.

608
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:15,064
I mean, I got a lot of anger
inside me too.

609
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:18,566
I want to take my gun
and blow everybody away!

610
00:49:18,772 --> 00:49:22,572
Thank you, Pete.
You sure you're not calling from Waco?

611
00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:25,678
Let's go to line three.
Mandy, you're on.

612
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:31,715
I just love me some Showtime.
I'm your biggest fan. Trey is so fine.

613
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:33,909
-I could ride that.
-What?

614
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:35,782
Thank you, Mandy.

615
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:39,618
I'm on Showtime. What's up?

616
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:48,058
Trey! Marry me, Trey!

617
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,499
Marry me, Trey!

618
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:55,072
I'm gonna be honest, you know.

619
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:59,075
It's natural, when you're in
a situation that's shitty...

620
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:05,045
...to think about what it might be
like to have a different partner.

621
00:50:08,455 --> 00:50:11,447
Like somebody that was
closer to your age.

622
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:14,559
Charismatic, with a little flair
and shit.

623
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,457
You kicking it with him,
have some fun.

624
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:24,202
Me and a Wesley Snipes type.
I know you won't get Wesley.

625
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:27,305
I see Wesley Snipes types
all the time.

626
00:50:27,507 --> 00:50:30,601
Me and a Wesley Snipes type?

627
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:32,870
Can you imagine?

628
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,277
Wesley Snipes type?

629
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:44,886
Do you feel lucky, punk?
Huh? Do you?

630
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:50,424
Basically, I'm saying the whole show
is slowed down just a half a beat...

631
00:50:50,764 --> 00:50:55,292
-I'm too old for this shit.
-...so Mitch can keep up.

632
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:58,938
Because I'm working out.
I do free-weights.

633
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:00,630
Go ahead. Make my day.

634
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:03,739
I'm taking care of mine. Mitch is not.

635
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:09,441
That's it. I'm taking care of mine
and Mitch is not.

636
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,914
Trey, look at this. It's all for you.

637
00:51:34,074 --> 00:51:37,703
-Trey, I'm right here.
-Yo, Trey.

638
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:50,349
Five minutes up yet?

639
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,332
It's showtime!

640
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,858
What are you looking at that for,
Magnum?

641
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:33,720
-How come we're not talking to him?
-Because he's sitting in county.

642
00:52:33,923 --> 00:52:37,154
A jailhouse.
That could be the next episode.

643
00:52:37,393 --> 00:52:39,827
Forget it. I put him there.

644
00:52:40,096 --> 00:52:42,792
He's the one who knows
about this gun.

645
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:46,230
He won't talk to me. I already tried.

646
00:52:47,437 --> 00:52:48,597
He'll talk to me.

647
00:52:48,905 --> 00:52:51,499
What makes you think
he'll talk to you?

648
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:54,438
I won't go in like a bulldog like you.

649
00:52:54,611 --> 00:52:58,240
-I'll talk. I'll be in character.
-In character!

650
00:52:58,915 --> 00:53:02,112
That's great.
You mean, like undercover?

651
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:07,756
A little finesse, catch him off guard,
have him think I'm someone else.

652
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:11,758
Character. What kind of a character?

653
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:13,726
I don't know.

654
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:22,364
ReRun! How you doing, my man? I'm Trey
Sellars from the Justice Channel.

655
00:53:22,572 --> 00:53:26,599
-Have a seat, please. You being strong?
-Yeah.

656
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:31,746
-Thanks for coming. You okay?
-I ain't heard of no Justice Channel.

657
00:53:31,948 --> 00:53:36,578
That's because we got started
while you was rotting away in here.

658
00:53:36,886 --> 00:53:41,619
The Justice Channel is devoted to
shining the light on victims like you.

659
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:46,228
-He's got talent, Mitch, come on.
-We're wasting our time.

660
00:53:46,796 --> 00:53:49,026
Is that a new shirt?

661
00:53:49,232 --> 00:53:51,860
It looks good. I like you in solids.

662
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:55,231
What's this shit about you
getting me out?

663
00:53:55,405 --> 00:54:00,741
Not me, brother, the TV show.
I'm hosting a show called Framed.

664
00:54:01,077 --> 00:54:04,604
Let me tell you about the show.
We spotlight you.

665
00:54:04,814 --> 00:54:08,910
Put a light on your situation.
Let the people see you.

666
00:54:09,118 --> 00:54:13,612
Hopefully, we get a grassroot
campaign started and get you out.

667
00:54:13,823 --> 00:54:16,917
I got three people out.
You can be number four.

668
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:21,121
-Like Mandela.
-Similar. You ain't as noble.

669
00:54:21,297 --> 00:54:24,562
You ain't no Nelson. You're ReRun.

670
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,327
You your own man. We want ReRun out.

671
00:54:27,503 --> 00:54:29,903
Mandela's shit stink too.

672
00:54:30,106 --> 00:54:32,267
Trey, I'll talk you through this.

673
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:34,239
-Not so loud.
-Say what?

674
00:54:34,577 --> 00:54:36,841
I wasn't that loud.

675
00:54:37,013 --> 00:54:40,073
You don't have to talk too loud.

676
00:54:40,283 --> 00:54:42,478
Shouldn't my lawyer be here?

677
00:54:42,685 --> 00:54:46,815
That's the wrong thing you can do.
Let me explain something.

678
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:50,447
Research has shown people
don't want to hear lawyers.

679
00:54:50,626 --> 00:54:53,823
They want to hear it
straight from your mouth.

680
00:54:53,996 --> 00:54:56,965
I got Johnnie Cochran.
No offense, bro.

681
00:54:57,166 --> 00:55:00,567
Cochran will get a response
I'm not trying to get.

682
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:03,797
I'm trying to get people
to connect with you.

683
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:06,941
If they see Johnnie Cochran
in a $1000 suit...

684
00:55:07,143 --> 00:55:10,340
...they ain't going to get you
out of prison.

685
00:55:10,546 --> 00:55:14,505
Ain't no cops here.
Just me and you. Brother to brother.

686
00:55:14,717 --> 00:55:16,014
I'm your brother.

687
00:55:16,185 --> 00:55:20,349
Take it slow. Nice and easy.
He's still on the fence.

688
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:25,490
All right! You and Lazy Boy
got this gun from somebody!

689
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:29,119
You work for the same person!
Who you working for?

690
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:32,665
What the hell?
What kind of reporter are you?

691
00:55:32,835 --> 00:55:35,998
-I don't tiptoe around the truth!
-Back off.

692
00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:40,733
And I will not back off
until I find out the truth!

693
00:55:41,577 --> 00:55:46,014
Brother, look at me. They selling
your black ass down the river.

694
00:55:46,249 --> 00:55:47,716
You say "ass" on TV?

695
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:50,977
This is cable.
I can say whatever I want to.

696
00:55:51,154 --> 00:55:53,315
Did they tell you plea-bargain?

697
00:55:53,523 --> 00:55:55,320
Take the hit, do the time?

698
00:55:55,525 --> 00:55:57,789
That's what was said, isn't it?

699
00:55:59,595 --> 00:56:00,687
Yeah.

700
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:04,161
See if you can get a name.

701
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:05,857
It's time, ReRun.

702
00:56:06,035 --> 00:56:09,562
It is time to shine the light
on who's behind this.

703
00:56:09,772 --> 00:56:12,263
Who's the puppet master?

704
00:56:12,575 --> 00:56:15,100
Whose time are you doing?

705
00:56:15,278 --> 00:56:18,247
While you're in here
he's smelling freedom.

706
00:56:18,447 --> 00:56:20,608
-And tasting it.
-What you smell?

707
00:56:20,783 --> 00:56:24,844
-Ass.
-Ass and feet, and tension and stress.

708
00:56:25,054 --> 00:56:29,582
Hey, brother, that ain't for you.
Look in that camera right now.

709
00:56:29,759 --> 00:56:32,728
Make a connection.
Look right into the lens.

710
00:56:32,895 --> 00:56:36,888
Say who it is that's supposed to be
in here instead of you.

711
00:56:37,066 --> 00:56:40,229
Look in the camera and say it.
I'm with you.

712
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,694
I'm right here with you.

713
00:56:43,906 --> 00:56:47,171
All the people out there in TV land...

714
00:56:47,343 --> 00:56:49,937
...and Mama, I'm coming home soon....

715
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:54,139
-Your baby be home soon, Mama.
-Yes.

716
00:56:54,317 --> 00:56:55,579
The culprit...

717
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:57,412
You'll see Mama soon.

718
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:01,989
...that put me on the streets
to do his dirty work...

719
00:57:02,158 --> 00:57:04,718
...that's shitting on my freedom...

720
00:57:04,861 --> 00:57:06,260
Tell them.

721
00:57:06,462 --> 00:57:08,623
...is none other...

722
00:57:09,065 --> 00:57:11,363
This is an emotional moment.

723
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:16,300
I get caught up when I know a brother
is ready to leave. I love it.

724
00:57:21,177 --> 00:57:23,145
...than Vargas!

725
00:57:24,647 --> 00:57:26,114
Caesar Vargas!

726
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:27,840
He said it!

727
00:57:29,085 --> 00:57:31,315
Hope you're watching, bitch.

728
00:57:31,487 --> 00:57:34,149
-Shit.
-You did the right thing, brother.

729
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:35,790
Find out where he is.

730
00:57:35,992 --> 00:57:37,823
You going down, baby.

731
00:57:38,027 --> 00:57:39,824
You made a connection.

732
00:57:39,996 --> 00:57:44,160
When the people see this,
they'll get rallied up. I can tell.

733
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:47,734
Now, where would a guy
like Vargas kick it?

734
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:51,863
-You trying to get a brother killed--
-Not at all.

735
00:57:52,074 --> 00:57:55,441
I do this for the viewers.
We don't point fingers.

736
00:57:55,645 --> 00:58:00,708
We'll say, "If you don't want to run
into Vargas don't go to this place."

737
00:58:00,917 --> 00:58:07,186
Hanging out with him, you wind up
in this place. That's how you got here.

738
00:58:07,356 --> 00:58:09,517
Look to the camera.

739
00:58:09,725 --> 00:58:14,492
Think about the babies, the children.
Save the babies, brother.

740
00:58:15,298 --> 00:58:16,993
People...

741
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,693
...and children in TV land and all
the little kids around the world...

742
00:58:21,871 --> 00:58:23,805
...don't be like me.

743
00:58:24,006 --> 00:58:27,339
And if you want to stay
out of harm's way...

744
00:58:30,379 --> 00:58:34,042
...don't go to Club Cuba Loca
on Figueroa.

745
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,741
It's a bad place. Don't go.

746
00:58:38,087 --> 00:58:39,213
He's just lucky.

747
00:58:39,422 --> 00:58:43,415
Brother, you did the right thing.
Don't you feel good?

748
00:58:44,126 --> 00:58:46,924
-We connected.
-A weight off my shoulders.

749
00:58:47,096 --> 00:58:50,031
You going down, bitch.
I got backup now.

750
00:58:50,566 --> 00:58:52,431
Hey, that's a wrap.

751
00:58:53,102 --> 00:58:55,366
Yeah! Come on, Mitch.

752
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:58,938
Now it's time for us
to get down to my story.

753
00:58:59,108 --> 00:59:03,101
I was born in a corn field,
Grandma was a stripper--

754
00:59:03,312 --> 00:59:07,248
Save all that for when you do
The Oprah Winfrey Show.

755
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,680
Yo, we going to the club tonight.

756
00:59:29,772 --> 00:59:31,467
Now what?

757
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,641
Watch me.

758
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:44,745
Is the mike on?
Can you turn the mike up?

759
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,586
Sorry to bother everybody.
Is Mr. Vargas here?

760
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:59,830
Anybody know where Mr. Vargas is?
Mr. Vargas?

761
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:02,436
There he is.
See how easy that was?

762
01:00:02,605 --> 01:00:04,971
Don't get up, we'll come to you.

763
01:00:05,341 --> 01:00:07,138
Sorry. Go on back...

764
01:00:07,343 --> 01:00:09,903
...to living la vida loca.

765
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:15,274
Sorry, I always wanted to do that.
Be right with you, Mr. Vargas.

766
01:00:20,423 --> 01:00:21,981
Interesting approach.

767
01:00:22,158 --> 01:00:25,389
Just doing my part.
He's over this way.

768
01:00:36,705 --> 01:00:40,197
-That button-cam was a good idea.
-Yeah, I told you.

769
01:00:49,652 --> 01:00:51,483
-Mr. Vargas?
-Yes.

770
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:56,522
I'm Detective Preston, L.A.P.D.
I'd like to ask you some questions.

771
01:00:56,725 --> 01:00:59,250
I am in the middle of dinner.

772
01:00:59,929 --> 01:01:04,559
-Hope this doesn't ruin your appetite.
-I got a strong stomach.

773
01:01:05,868 --> 01:01:10,100
-Who's he?
-One of your employees. You know that.

774
01:01:10,573 --> 01:01:14,339
A lot of people work for me.
I don't know this guy.

775
01:01:14,944 --> 01:01:17,242
And what about this guy?

776
01:01:20,316 --> 01:01:22,307
What's his name?

777
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,050
He's big...

778
01:01:29,525 --> 01:01:34,189
...probably big enough to go through
those bulletproof vests you wear.

779
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:37,225
Am I right?

780
01:01:40,002 --> 01:01:42,800
Bulletproof vest, huh?

781
01:01:43,172 --> 01:01:44,332
And you are...?

782
01:01:44,673 --> 01:01:48,973
You can't miss me. I'm across
the street on the billboard.

783
01:01:50,746 --> 01:01:52,407
You are the TV cops.

784
01:01:52,948 --> 01:01:55,007
Right.

785
01:01:55,284 --> 01:01:57,115
What's your line again?

786
01:01:57,319 --> 01:01:58,786
"It's showtime!"

787
01:01:59,455 --> 01:02:01,889
It's showtime!

788
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:04,921
I told you it was good.

789
01:02:05,127 --> 01:02:07,618
See how funny this is
once we arrest you.

790
01:02:07,997 --> 01:02:09,191
And then what?

791
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:12,695
What'll you do?
Try me in The People's Court?

792
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:16,804
We're gonna be watching
your punk ass 24-7, slick.

793
01:02:19,108 --> 01:02:21,576
Are you going to arrest me?

794
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:27,145
Because if you're not, get out.
Or I have to call the real cops.

795
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:30,376
-Hey, we are the real cops.
-Sure you are.

796
01:02:30,553 --> 01:02:34,319
-You don't think we're real cops?
-I think you're a joke.

797
01:02:36,192 --> 01:02:38,820
It's all right. He cannot touch me.

798
01:02:39,028 --> 01:02:44,466
Not this time, but next time
I'll drag you out of here in cuffs.

799
01:02:45,834 --> 01:02:47,802
You see, I told you.

800
01:02:48,003 --> 01:02:50,301
They are a joke.

801
01:02:50,773 --> 01:02:51,762
Right?

802
01:03:02,017 --> 01:03:05,145
-It's a joke. It's a Showtime joke.
-Showtime.

803
01:03:14,863 --> 01:03:16,490
That's great TV!

804
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:31,036
We can take this car and meet girls
who wouldn't normally look at us.

805
01:03:31,247 --> 01:03:32,976
Yeah, I'll pass.

806
01:03:33,182 --> 01:03:36,015
You gotta go whip up
some dinner plates?

807
01:03:36,218 --> 01:03:40,951
-Why don't you stop the car?
-All right, I'll leave you alone.

808
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:52,194
-What's this, your picture and rsum?
-Those are my 8-by-10s.

809
01:03:52,468 --> 01:03:53,867
I just want to look.

810
01:03:54,403 --> 01:03:57,634
All these special skills
must come in handy, huh?

811
01:03:57,806 --> 01:03:59,171
I've never...

812
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:01,366
...never met a...

813
01:04:01,577 --> 01:04:04,102
...mime. Is that it? Mime?

814
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,248
Yeah, I'm a mime. I mime.

815
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:10,478
I'm curious about these movies:
Beach Party Bonzo?

816
01:04:10,686 --> 01:04:15,885
Yes, it's a semi-independent film.
Very low-budget, semi-independent.

817
01:04:16,091 --> 01:04:19,527
Planet Gorthon, 31 A.D.?

818
01:04:20,296 --> 01:04:24,357
Kind of light porn,
but I don't even want to go into it.

819
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:28,030
You try out for the Village People?

820
01:04:28,804 --> 01:04:32,900
-I'm adding pottery to that list.
-Don't knock pottery.

821
01:04:33,275 --> 01:04:37,905
Of all the things a man can do,
why would somebody throw a pot?

822
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:42,378
-lf I tell you, will you drop it?
-Please tell me.

823
01:04:42,551 --> 01:04:47,682
My marriage counselor. My ex and I were
on the rocks. She said get a hobby.

824
01:04:47,923 --> 01:04:49,857
-And that's it?
-That's it.

825
01:04:50,259 --> 01:04:52,523
Why are you so crappy at it?

826
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:56,220
It's like you and work.
I never took it seriously.

827
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:59,632
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

828
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:02,396
Why'd you become a cop, anyway?

829
01:05:02,705 --> 01:05:07,472
-Because I was a shitty waiter.
-You mean you were a better mime?

830
01:05:07,643 --> 01:05:13,172
I was an excellent mime. Still am.
Would you like to see my skills?

831
01:05:13,549 --> 01:05:15,449
I got the car. Don't worry.

832
01:05:16,452 --> 01:05:19,717
See? Now my face
is against the glass.

833
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:23,515
You can mime words too. Watch.

834
01:05:23,726 --> 01:05:26,422
-Fuck you.
-Okay.

835
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:28,990
I'm impressed.

836
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:32,297
There's a glass wall here.

837
01:05:40,242 --> 01:05:41,607
Thanks for the ride.

838
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:46,509
-We got to bond, don't you think?
-No. Not really.

839
01:05:47,316 --> 01:05:48,613
Uh-oh.

840
01:05:49,184 --> 01:05:52,153
-What?
-I never leave my lights on.

841
01:05:59,695 --> 01:06:01,128
Surprise!

842
01:06:01,296 --> 01:06:02,695
What did you do?

843
01:06:02,865 --> 01:06:05,299
-You don't like it?
-No, I don't.

844
01:06:06,402 --> 01:06:09,496
Tell Don Johnson
we found his apartment.

845
01:06:09,705 --> 01:06:13,698
I don't know what you were thinking.
I want it back. Now!

846
01:06:13,909 --> 01:06:16,139
Okay, Mitch. Just relax, okay?

847
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:20,281
We didn't touch the pottery.
We're giving you sex appeal.

848
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:23,384
It looks like a gay porno star
lives here.

849
01:06:23,585 --> 01:06:25,678
And here they are, right here.

850
01:06:25,921 --> 01:06:27,149
Just stop.

851
01:06:27,356 --> 01:06:30,792
You can't change the place
without my permission.

852
01:06:30,993 --> 01:06:34,292
You don't have the right.
Get this dog out.

853
01:06:35,063 --> 01:06:36,621
Powder's yours.

854
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:39,632
Mine? I don't want some dog.
What is this?

855
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:42,894
He used to be a drug sniffer
in the K-9 unit.

856
01:06:43,105 --> 01:06:44,732
He looks like an addict.

857
01:06:44,907 --> 01:06:49,844
-He makes you look sympathetic.
-A kennel won't make him sympathetic.

858
01:06:50,045 --> 01:06:53,014
Want me to be sympathetic?
Put my stuff back.

859
01:06:53,182 --> 01:06:56,413
I'll be sympathetic.
Until then, I won't be.

860
01:06:57,453 --> 01:07:00,650
How can you say no to that face,
Mitch?

861
01:07:02,157 --> 01:07:05,126
I can say no very easily.
No, Powder. Get out.

862
01:07:05,327 --> 01:07:06,954
Don't be like that.

863
01:07:07,162 --> 01:07:08,527
It's just a dog, man.

864
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,324
Come here, Powder.
You're a good boy.

865
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:14,895
Shit!

866
01:07:15,103 --> 01:07:17,833
Maybe Mitch is right.
Get rid of the dog.

867
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,372
I don't know.
I like his instincts.

868
01:07:20,843 --> 01:07:22,572
Watch your ass, Powder.

869
01:07:44,867 --> 01:07:46,528
Okay. Move it.

870
01:07:56,011 --> 01:07:58,571
Dispatch, this is Armor 323--

871
01:08:07,523 --> 01:08:08,615
Go! Go!

872
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:29,134
Go.

873
01:08:56,805 --> 01:08:59,706
This is Showtime One.
We're on it.

874
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:15,284
Okay.

875
01:09:15,524 --> 01:09:18,516
Annie, get the dish up.
Julio, go!

876
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,904
That's definitely our gun.

877
01:09:31,406 --> 01:09:33,374
Watch it!

878
01:10:13,048 --> 01:10:14,208
Hey! Hey!

879
01:10:17,352 --> 01:10:20,116
-Let's go!
-Move it!

880
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:36,525
Damn! We lost picture!

881
01:11:46,341 --> 01:11:47,808
Slow down!

882
01:12:25,747 --> 01:12:26,975
There he is!

883
01:12:27,182 --> 01:12:28,410
I got him!

884
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:38,251
-Incoming!
-Watch it!

885
01:12:49,437 --> 01:12:51,598
-You getting this?
-Yeah!

886
01:12:55,744 --> 01:12:57,177
Jump!

887
01:12:57,379 --> 01:12:58,710
Jump! Jump!

888
01:12:59,548 --> 01:13:01,743
You gotta jump! Now!

889
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:03,611
-Come on, Mitch!
-Do it!

890
01:13:22,804 --> 01:13:25,364
Now that was some good hood-jumping!

891
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:27,570
You all right?

892
01:13:27,776 --> 01:13:29,209
You okay?

893
01:13:29,411 --> 01:13:31,777
I think two drops of pee came out.

894
01:13:37,185 --> 01:13:40,985
You're off the show, Sellars.
You're busted to patrol.

895
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,631
Showtime is over.

896
01:13:53,835 --> 01:13:56,065
And we're screwed.

897
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:59,998
See you back on the tape, Top Cop.

898
01:14:03,778 --> 01:14:07,236
Being a police officer is not
what you see on TV!

899
01:14:07,449 --> 01:14:10,384
I've never seen you do
anything like this!

900
01:14:10,585 --> 01:14:13,486
Your showboating
put this city at risk.

901
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:16,020
I expect that of Trey, not you.

902
01:14:16,224 --> 01:14:18,419
It just escalated.

903
01:14:18,627 --> 01:14:23,428
Mitch, it's over. It's over.
Chief is pulling the plug on the show.

904
01:14:23,632 --> 01:14:28,535
-Good. Now I can get back to work.
-No, you can't. You're off the case.

905
01:14:28,837 --> 01:14:31,567
-What?
-PR is having a heart attack.

906
01:14:31,773 --> 01:14:34,640
This is worse than
when you shot the camera.

907
01:14:34,843 --> 01:14:38,506
If Vargas gets more guns,
we'll be even worse off.

908
01:14:38,713 --> 01:14:43,343
You blew it. I'm relieving you of
duty, pending an investigation.

909
01:14:43,919 --> 01:14:48,754
What, do you want me to turn in
my gun and my badge? Ben, come on.

910
01:14:48,957 --> 01:14:52,757
I just want you to go home
till this shitstorm settles.

911
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:55,293
What am I supposed to do at home?

912
01:14:55,497 --> 01:14:58,762
I don't know. Read a book.
Watch some TV.

913
01:14:58,967 --> 01:15:01,595
Do your pottery projects.

914
01:15:06,241 --> 01:15:07,572
What?

915
01:15:08,843 --> 01:15:10,140
What?

916
01:15:11,313 --> 01:15:13,577
He's touching the pecker-cam.

917
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,984
There's a lens in those eyes.

918
01:15:17,185 --> 01:15:18,209
My woodpecker?

919
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,888
-Don't break it.
-I said no cameras.

920
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:25,459
I hope you got all of this.
You hear me?

921
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,150
I hope you got it all.

922
01:15:29,064 --> 01:15:31,294
He broke it.

923
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:35,198
I'll get you another one.

924
01:15:35,403 --> 01:15:38,930
Talk to him. He's got issues.
He hates cameras.

925
01:15:57,792 --> 01:16:00,761
-We're here to take the dog.
-The dog stays.

926
01:16:00,929 --> 01:16:01,918
We have orders.

927
01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:06,432
He's a police officer.
Touch him and I'll shoot you.

928
01:16:11,773 --> 01:16:13,206
Go, go, go.

929
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:16,472
Good boy, Powder. Good boy.

930
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:19,876
Nobody will take you away.

931
01:16:20,081 --> 01:16:24,142
Trey, forget Showtime.
We'll do our own buddy cop show.

932
01:16:24,352 --> 01:16:28,049
I got a treatment worked out
in my head. Check it.

933
01:16:28,256 --> 01:16:30,747
You're Nick Load, and I'm John Lock.

934
01:16:30,959 --> 01:16:33,257
-Nick who?
-Nick Load.

935
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:37,898
You're Nick Load. I'm John Lock.
Together, we're Lock and Load.

936
01:16:38,099 --> 01:16:41,626
We are the baddest bicycle cops
on Venice Beach.

937
01:16:41,836 --> 01:16:44,100
Is that hot shit, or what?

938
01:16:44,372 --> 01:16:47,535
Listen, George Clooney
had 18 shows fail...

939
01:16:47,742 --> 01:16:51,007
...before he hit big with ER.
So you see?

940
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:55,775
I don't wanna be the guy
putting up the caution tape.

941
01:16:55,984 --> 01:16:58,248
I was feeling this detective thing.

942
01:16:58,453 --> 01:17:02,253
Listen, you have heat
on your acting career right now.

943
01:17:02,457 --> 01:17:06,791
If you don't strike while the iron
is hot, it'll pass you by.

944
01:17:07,796 --> 01:17:12,756
Whatever. I'm gonna go see
this last episode of Showtime.

945
01:17:21,109 --> 01:17:23,600
You had your food. None for you.

946
01:17:24,946 --> 01:17:28,780
You're off the show, Sellars.
You're busted to patrol.

947
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:32,180
-What happens to Mitch?
-He's relieved of duty.

948
01:17:32,387 --> 01:17:36,517
Mitch is my partner.
He's the only person I can depend on.

949
01:17:36,724 --> 01:17:39,852
Not my family, not my friends.
Just him.

950
01:17:40,061 --> 01:17:43,792
That's beautiful, Sellars.
What do you want me to do?

951
01:17:43,998 --> 01:17:49,163
-lf he's relieved, I should be.
-lf you want it, you're relieved too.

952
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:50,701
Okay.

953
01:17:51,873 --> 01:17:54,603
-I'm relieved, then.
-Okay.

954
01:17:54,809 --> 01:17:58,006
-Want my gun and badge?
-Get out of here.

955
01:17:58,213 --> 01:17:59,737
All right.

956
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,462
-Who is this?
-It's me, Mitch.

957
01:18:16,664 --> 01:18:18,256
What do you want?

958
01:18:18,466 --> 01:18:23,301
-Are you watching the show?
-No, I'm not. It's ancient history.

959
01:18:23,705 --> 01:18:27,266
-New day, new way.
-Me too. I'm eating a TV dinner.

960
01:18:27,475 --> 01:18:32,845
-So, what's up?
-I just, you know....

961
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:35,515
I wanted to tell you that...

962
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:39,582
...what you did was a pretty
standup thing and...

963
01:18:40,955 --> 01:18:44,755
...if you take that detective exam,
I'm there for you.

964
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:47,291
Whatever questions, I'll be around.

965
01:18:47,495 --> 01:18:51,454
-I'd make a great detective?
-You'd make an okay detective.

966
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,597
-Let me get that on my machine.
-I'm hanging up.

967
01:18:55,803 --> 01:18:57,100
No. Quick question.

968
01:18:57,305 --> 01:19:01,708
Could you make me a pair of those
shitty-ass mugs that you make?

969
01:19:02,577 --> 01:19:06,013
-You gotta be kidding.
-Relax. I'm just joking, man.

970
01:19:06,214 --> 01:19:08,182
No, something on the show.

971
01:19:08,383 --> 01:19:11,079
-So you are watching the show.
-Yeah.

972
01:19:11,286 --> 01:19:15,746
-Me too. What did you see?
-Charlie Hertz, works for ballistics.

973
01:19:15,957 --> 01:19:20,758
-That guy outside Lazy Boy's.
-Yeah, but I gotta see it again.

974
01:19:20,962 --> 01:19:24,261
Don't worry, I'm recording it.
I record them all.

975
01:19:24,465 --> 01:19:28,026
-Why am I not surprised?
-Let me rewind this thing.

976
01:19:32,373 --> 01:19:34,466
-It is Charlie Hertz.
-It is?

977
01:19:34,676 --> 01:19:38,009
-It's definitely him.
-What's he doing with Vargas?

978
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:04,565
Where are the lights?

979
01:20:09,711 --> 01:20:12,544
We definitely found our gunmaker.

980
01:20:13,414 --> 01:20:15,678
This is definitely his workshop.

981
01:20:16,451 --> 01:20:18,214
Look at all this shit.

982
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,879
What happened to the days
when people just grew pot?

983
01:20:23,091 --> 01:20:25,423
How about we star-69 his last call?

984
01:20:26,794 --> 01:20:29,058
King Rental Trucks,
may I help you?

985
01:20:29,364 --> 01:20:31,855
This is Detective Mitch Preston--

986
01:20:32,066 --> 01:20:35,297
You mean the Mitch Preston?
The one on Showtime?

987
01:20:35,503 --> 01:20:37,767
-That's me.
-Oh, my God!

988
01:20:38,206 --> 01:20:42,870
Calm down, we just need some
information about a truck.

989
01:20:43,077 --> 01:20:47,446
-Did you rent one to a Charles Hertz?
-I'll just check, honey.

990
01:20:47,649 --> 01:20:50,413
Mr. Hertz picked one up this morning.

991
01:20:50,618 --> 01:20:54,884
-Was there a tracking device on it?
-Yes, Mitch, there was.

992
01:20:55,857 --> 01:20:58,291
Is Trey with you?
Can I speak to him?

993
01:20:58,493 --> 01:20:59,983
Sure, here.

994
01:21:00,194 --> 01:21:02,685
-Trey? This Trey?
-Yeah.

995
01:21:02,897 --> 01:21:05,161
I love you, baby!
Say, "showtime. "

996
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:07,732
It's showtime!
This bitch is crazy.

997
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:12,167
Okay, all right. Bye-bye.
See how popular I am?

998
01:21:15,476 --> 01:21:16,670
All right, thanks.

999
01:21:16,878 --> 01:21:19,711
We got a hit on the truck
at the Bonaventure.

1000
01:21:19,914 --> 01:21:21,905
-What's going on?
-Gun show.

1001
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,525
Nice guns.

1002
01:21:41,736 --> 01:21:43,067
Come on back.

1003
01:21:44,472 --> 01:21:45,803
It's okay.

1004
01:22:11,499 --> 01:22:13,990
-Thanks for the call.
-Find that footage?

1005
01:22:14,202 --> 01:22:16,568
Here are the printouts.
Good luck.

1006
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:18,261
You went out on a limb.

1007
01:22:18,473 --> 01:22:22,102
I want to help. Plus I need
an ending for the finale.

1008
01:22:30,585 --> 01:22:32,075
Excuse me.

1009
01:22:32,787 --> 01:22:34,118
Hello, gun lovers.

1010
01:22:34,322 --> 01:22:39,089
My name is Chase Renzi
from the hit series Showtime.

1011
01:22:41,062 --> 01:22:43,826
That's sweet. Very sweet, very sweet.

1012
01:22:44,031 --> 01:22:46,693
I'm here because we need your help.

1013
01:22:46,901 --> 01:22:50,200
We believe these two men
are in the building.

1014
01:22:50,405 --> 01:22:54,068
They are armed
and extremely dangerous.

1015
01:22:54,575 --> 01:22:56,008
What the hell?

1016
01:22:56,778 --> 01:22:58,336
There they are!

1017
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,114
Vargas!

1018
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:24,794
Don't move.

1019
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:33,811
Oh, shit!

1020
01:23:39,053 --> 01:23:40,247
Mitch!

1021
01:23:50,965 --> 01:23:52,125
Guys, wait up!

1022
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:56,861
-Roger that.
-Ghost 3, Bonaventure Hotel.

1023
01:23:57,872 --> 01:24:01,171
Why don't I go up and
make a nice list of demands?

1024
01:24:01,509 --> 01:24:02,999
I can help you here.

1025
01:24:22,196 --> 01:24:26,895
-Get in!
-Just take it easy, all right? Easy!

1026
01:24:34,141 --> 01:24:36,132
Vargas? There's no way out.

1027
01:24:36,344 --> 01:24:37,971
I've got a list of demands.

1028
01:24:38,145 --> 01:24:40,705
Let us in and tell us what they are.

1029
01:24:40,915 --> 01:24:44,214
All right. But first, slide your
weapons in here.

1030
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:47,444
-What did you say?
-I don't know. What?

1031
01:24:47,655 --> 01:24:49,384
Slide your weapons in here.

1032
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:51,717
-What?
-What'd you say?

1033
01:24:51,926 --> 01:24:54,190
You don't understand English?

1034
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:56,119
Slide in your weapons.

1035
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:59,356
Slide the weapons.
It's okay. I got a backup.

1036
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:02,331
Hold on. I gotta change the tape.

1037
01:25:06,007 --> 01:25:09,101
-You thinking what I'm thinking?
-Yeah, I am.

1038
01:25:11,812 --> 01:25:14,804
-What are you doing?
-Shut up.

1039
01:25:15,016 --> 01:25:16,074
Mitch, no.

1040
01:25:16,284 --> 01:25:18,878
-Did you hear me?
-Hold on.

1041
01:25:19,086 --> 01:25:21,077
Don't do that. Man!

1042
01:25:22,323 --> 01:25:23,688
I've got demands.

1043
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:27,759
See those news choppers out there?
We're hooked in live.

1044
01:25:27,962 --> 01:25:32,592
We have a cameraman out here so
you can tell the world what you want.

1045
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:37,270
Okay. Throw in your weapons.

1046
01:25:37,471 --> 01:25:39,496
Here they come.

1047
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:51,473
Ready?

1048
01:25:55,623 --> 01:25:57,250
There are the guns.

1049
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:59,119
-Stay there.
-Easy.

1050
01:25:59,427 --> 01:26:01,952
-Stay there.
-Okay. Just take it easy.

1051
01:26:02,163 --> 01:26:04,893
-Where's the cameraman?
-He's afraid.

1052
01:26:05,099 --> 01:26:08,967
We don't want to put him in danger,
so he'll do the shooting.

1053
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:10,296
I'll do it.

1054
01:26:10,504 --> 01:26:13,098
You ever been on TV before?

1055
01:26:13,774 --> 01:26:17,210
It's very simple.
Look at the red light.

1056
01:26:17,411 --> 01:26:20,312
Tell the people what's on your mind.

1057
01:26:21,482 --> 01:26:23,473
You got him all lined up?

1058
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:27,017
Yeah. Let's shoot.

1059
01:26:27,555 --> 01:26:31,184
Okay. All right.
It's showtime.

1060
01:27:03,324 --> 01:27:04,814
You okay?

1061
01:27:12,867 --> 01:27:14,494
Mitch?

1062
01:27:33,621 --> 01:27:36,146
-Trey! Where are you?
-Over here!

1063
01:27:40,161 --> 01:27:42,721
-What are you doing?
-Hold on!

1064
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:49,666
Oh, God!

1065
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:07,144
Now it's your turn to smile
for the cameras.

1066
01:28:11,392 --> 01:28:15,658
-Get that camera out of here!
-Keep that camera where it is!

1067
01:28:32,713 --> 01:28:35,978
Annie, you deal with it, girl.

1068
01:28:36,884 --> 01:28:40,251
What's going on
with your new recruits?

1069
01:28:40,454 --> 01:28:43,617
I'm tired of your voice.
You're on my last nerve.

1070
01:28:43,824 --> 01:28:47,521
-They're not bonding.
-They don't have our chemistry.

1071
01:28:47,728 --> 01:28:52,461
Which is why you ought
to guest star in the next episode.

1072
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:54,998
-Not in a million years.
-That's a yes.

1073
01:28:55,202 --> 01:28:58,069
I know, and believe me,
I'm working on him.

1074
01:29:00,574 --> 01:29:02,132
See you at 8, Mitch.

1075
01:29:02,343 --> 01:29:06,677
Look at what you get. What do I get?
Nothing. I'm going to work.

1076
01:29:08,883 --> 01:29:12,683
I made you something.
For passing the detective exam.

1077
01:29:12,887 --> 01:29:15,185
That is nice of you to do that.

1078
01:29:18,926 --> 01:29:21,394
Mitch, that's nice.

1079
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:24,325
What is that?

1080
01:29:24,632 --> 01:29:29,831
-What is it? It's a loose change dish.
-Of course it's a loose change dish.

1081
01:29:30,037 --> 01:29:33,996
I haven't seen this level of
craftsmanship since kindergarten.

1082
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,142
It's appreciated, partner.

1083
01:29:36,343 --> 01:29:40,677
-Detectives, your suspect's waiting.
-Be right with you.

1084
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:44,180
"Detective Sellars."
It has a nice ring to it.

1085
01:29:44,385 --> 01:29:46,979
Come on, Top Cop, it's showtime.

1086
01:29:48,422 --> 01:29:50,788
Hi. I'm Detective Mitch Preston.

1087
01:29:51,525 --> 01:29:52,685
No!

1088
01:29:53,894 --> 01:29:55,759
I'm sorry, I can't....

1089
01:29:56,931 --> 01:29:58,228
Book 'em, Danno.

1090
01:29:58,933 --> 01:30:02,391
You're under arrest!
You under arrest, mother****er!

1091
01:30:02,603 --> 01:30:04,230
I'm sorry.

1092
01:30:05,272 --> 01:30:08,537
This Preston character
needs to come to life.

1093
01:30:08,742 --> 01:30:10,903
He doesn't have any balls.

1094
01:30:11,111 --> 01:30:12,703
Well, he has balls.

1095
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:15,746
They gotta come out.
Bada-bing, bada-boom balls.

1096
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:18,282
Do you feel lucky, punk?

1097
01:30:19,286 --> 01:30:20,548
Who said that?

1098
01:30:22,323 --> 01:30:25,417
I know you know, Mitch.
You're gonna see this--

1099
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,485
Get that camera out of here!

1100
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:31,923
Could you come a little closer?

1101
01:30:32,867 --> 01:30:35,131
I'm sorry, I did the wrong thing.

1102
01:30:42,943 --> 01:30:47,676
Wrap me up in caution tape,
wrap me up in caution tape, Cop Top?

1103
01:30:48,449 --> 01:30:51,577
-You don't think we're--
-Say that in Ebonic!

1104
01:30:51,752 --> 01:30:52,810
I'm tired.

1105
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:55,079
-Who are you?
-I'm Annie.

1106
01:30:55,289 --> 01:30:58,053
You need a daddy?
Yes or no?

1107
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,952
"Oh, Bill." That's what I get now.

1108
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:06,224
It used to be "Oh, yeah,"
now it's "Oh, Bill."

1109
01:31:06,433 --> 01:31:08,560
It's showtime!

1110
01:31:08,769 --> 01:31:10,236
It's showtime.

1111
01:31:10,437 --> 01:31:12,905
Get that camera out of here!
