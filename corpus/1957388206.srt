19
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:48,132
Mrs. Stiles, as I have
told you many times this year

20
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,132
to check the progression
of your illness

21
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:52,132
we need to see inside you.

22
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:55,132
Look, Dr. Peters, what’s
going on inside of me

23
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:58,132
looks a lot like
what’s going on outside of me.

24
00:01:58,132 --> 00:01:59,132
Grace...

25
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:00,132
Listen, young lady,

26
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:02,131
if god wanted you
to look in my body

27
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,131
he’d have given me a window.

28
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,131
Now, just take me back
to my penthouse.

29
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,131
But, grace...
Now!

30
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:07,131
Please listen
to me.

31
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:08,131
You hear?

32
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,131
Yes, ma’am.

33
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:10,131
Roy.

34
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,131
Hello, Mr. Dudley.

35
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:15,131
You know, Mr. Anders is
beginning to lose Patience.

36
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:17,131
There are bulldozers
already on the property

37
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,131
based on
your say-so.

38
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,131
I know, Mr. Dudley.

39
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:21,131
Honestly, I do.

40
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,131
This is the contract
Mr. Anders’ company

41
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:26,131
has prepared for the purchase
of your grandmother’s farm.

42
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:29,130
You may want
to have your own
lawyer go over it.

43
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,130
My grandma don’t put
much stock in lawyers.

44
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,130
You’ve been in banking
for a long time now.

45
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,130
If you say
it’s a good deal

46
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,130
we’ll take
your word for it.

47
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,130
Then all we need

48
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,130
is your grandmother’s
signature.

54
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,129
I can’t believe
the difference in the garden

55
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,129
since you came here.

56
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,129
Yeah, well, that’s
the only reason

57
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:09,129
I let my grandson put me in here
when I broke my hip.

58
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:10,129
Your garden looked worse
than me.

59
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,129
It does look pretty good,
don’t it?

60
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,129
Mm-hmm.

61
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,129
Would you look at that?

62
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,129
Would you...

63
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,129
Bernice!

64
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,128
Bernice!

65
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,128
You interrupted
my ball scores.

66
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:27,128
Help me up, dear.

67
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:28,128
There you go.

68
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,128
Bernice...

69
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,128
Thank you.

70
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:36,128
You said that
my hymn-singing

71
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:39,128
wouldn’t make the peppers
get any bigger.

72
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:40,128
Take a look at that.

73
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:43,128
All your hymn-singing does
is set my teeth on edge.

74
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:47,128
In my prayers every morning,
I ask god why he would send me

75
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:48,128
an honorary old heathen

76
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,127
like you for
a roommate.

77
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:52,127
I’ve told you
a hundred times, grace.

78
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:53,127
There is no god.

79
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:55,127
Only fools

80
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:56,127
believe otherwise.

81
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:58,127
Well, if that’s true,
I am proud to be

82
00:03:58,127 --> 00:03:59,127
the biggest fool
in creation.

83
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:01,127
Ladies, please.

84
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,127
Thank you.

85
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:11,127
I would kill for some lox
on a sesame bagel.

86
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,127
Really?

87
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,127
Lox?

88
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:15,127
Yeah.

89
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,126
We have lox here.

90
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:17,126
Seriously? Lox?

91
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,126
They do. Yeah.

92
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,126
Look.
Over here

93
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,126
near the door hinges
and doorknobs.

94
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,126
You see we got locks,
we got padlocks

95
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:24,126
we got front locks...

96
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:26,126
David, I am starting
to worry about you.

97
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:28,126
Even your sense of humor
is turning country.

98
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,126
Yeah, but you
still love me.

99
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,126
You guys need help?

100
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:32,126
Um, yeah. We do.

101
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:34,126
Actually, we do.
We’re looking for a, uh...

102
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:35,126
Steamer.

103
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,126
Steamer.
To take about

104
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,126
ten layers of paper

105
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:38,126
off the bedroom wall.

106
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:40,126
Try valley rent-all
down on south main.

107
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:41,126
They’ll fix you right up.

108
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:43,125
You’re the new lawyer,
aren’t you?

109
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,125
New to this
state, anyway.

110
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,125
Hi.
David greenwood.

111
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,125
Lou Edwards.

112
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,125
Your new partner’s
my brother-in-law.

113
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,125
You must be Gloria.

114
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,125
Small... world.

115
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,125
You guys miss New York?

116
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,125
A little.

117
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,125
Well, if you ever
need anything...

118
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,125
imported cheese, olives,

119
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,125
smoked salmon... you let me know.

120
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,125
I’ll have it shipped in for you
overnight.

121
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,125
Thanks, Lou.
Appreciate that.

122
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,125
You see?

123
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,125
Things are looking up
a little bit, right?

124
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,125
Yeah.
Yeah?

125
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:11,124
I don’t say often enough

126
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:13,124
how much I appreciate
you doing this.

127
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:15,124
I’ve always dreamed
of living the country life.

128
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:17,124
Mm-hmm.

129
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:18,124
I know it’s
an adjustment

130
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:20,124
but I think once
you get a job...

131
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:21,124
I have a job
and I like it.

132
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:23,124
You’re volunteering.

133
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,124
Let’s just
go get the steamer...

134
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,124
Whoa!

135
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:30,124
I’m so sorry.

136
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:31,124
Oh, no.

137
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:32,124
Oh, look at you.

138
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,124
Are you okay?

139
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,124
Are you all right?
Huh?

140
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:35,124
I’m fine, ma’am.

141
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:36,124
No problem, really.

142
00:05:36,124 --> 00:05:37,123
Yeah. Okay.

143
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:39,123
Honey, the
boy’s okay.

144
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:40,123
Honey...

145
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:41,123
Honey, let him go.

146
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,123
Sweetheart.
He’s okay.

147
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:44,123
Honey,
come on.

148
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:45,123
Yeah.

149
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:47,123
He’s fine now.
Let him go.

150
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:48,123
All right.

151
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,123
Here you
go, pal.

152
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:50,123
Sorry about that.

153
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:51,123
Bye-bye.

154
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:53,123
Bye.

155
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,123
Okay?

156
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,123
Mm-hmm.

157
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:02,123
All right?

158
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:03,123
All right.

159
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:04,122
Yeah.

160
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:05,122
You know what?

161
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:06,122
I’m going
to drive.

162
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:07,122
Yeah. You drive.

163
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:08,122
Okay.

164
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,122
Oh, I must look a fright.

165
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:16,122
I saw the doctors today

166
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:19,122
and they just stuffed me
so full of holes.

167
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:22,122
It’s a wonder
I’m not leaking
all over the place.

168
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,122
( Coughing )

169
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:33,121
Okay?

170
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:37,121
Excuse me.

171
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:41,121
Arthur Gilford came by.

172
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,121
Got the furniture
from the big house.

173
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:46,121
He said some of the pieces
are heirloom quality.

174
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:47,121
Really?

175
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:49,121
Mr. Pitt from
the auction barn came

176
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:51,121
and got most
everything else.

177
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:57,121
I hate your having to do this
by yourself, Roy.

178
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:59,120
Charlene helps some.

179
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
That’s good.

180
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Well, I told you that, uh

181
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,120
that I saw the
doctor earlier

182
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
and, honey,
I don’t expect

183
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,120
that I have too
much more time.

184
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Dr. Peters called me.

185
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,120
She also said that you’re
not taking your medicine.

186
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,119
That medicine...

187
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,119
It’s painkillers.

188
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,119
I don’t know why everybody’s
so fired up around here

189
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:31,119
to fill me up with painkillers.

190
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,119
None of their business.

191
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,119
Grandma...

192
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,119
About the farm...

193
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:43,119
This land developer,
Mr. Anders...

194
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,119
he’s offering us
a real good price

195
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,119
but he is not going
to wait forever

196
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:53,118
and if we have to wait
until you’re, you know...

197
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:55,118
Gone...

198
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:56,118
Yeah.

199
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:58,118
Then, uh, then
we’re going to have

200
00:07:58,118 --> 00:07:59,118
all sorts
of legal hassles

201
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:00,118
which no one wants.

202
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:02,118
Oh, no more than me, honey.

203
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:03,118
Listen, grandma...

204
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:06,118
If it’s your things
that you’re worried about

205
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,118
Mr. Anders said we can store it
all down in the granny cottage.

206
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:12,118
We can keep it there
all winter if necessary.

207
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,118
And, that way, if you
need something up here...

208
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,118
Roy... Roy...

209
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:18,118
You’re right.

210
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:19,117
It’s time.

211
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,117
It’s time to sell.

212
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:26,117
You’ll sign the contract?

213
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:29,117
They won’t touch my orchards.

214
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:31,117
Why would they
touch your orchard?

215
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:34,117
The whole shebang
is named for it.

216
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,117
"Apple glade resort."

217
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:37,117
That’s what they’re calling it.

218
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,117
Fancy.

219
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,117
You should see.

220
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:41,117
They got a big old sign
on the hill

221
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,117
where grandpa
used to have
his still.

222
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:46,116
Honey, your grandpa
never had a still.

223
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:47,116
Yes, ma’am.

224
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,116
Now, uncle Enis,
grandpa’s brother

225
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:51,116
he did have a still

226
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:54,116
and grandpa sometimes
tended it for him

227
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,116
but it... it was
just to help out.

228
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,116
Write your name
right there.

229
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:01,116
Right.

230
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:34,115
There. That’s done, then.

231
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,114
But, Roy,

232
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:45,114
what’s going to happen
to the money?

233
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:49,114
If your grandma’s really
going to die...

234
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,114
bless her soul...

235
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:53,114
well, what’s going
to happen to the money?

236
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,114
Well, I haven’t asked her,
Charlene.

237
00:09:55,114 --> 00:09:58,114
I think it’s all going
to pay the medical bills.

238
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:00,114
Well, you got to ask her, Roy.

239
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:03,114
You’re her only kin
in these parts.

240
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:06,113
You help out
night and day
with everything

241
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:07,113
under the sun.

242
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:09,113
Your daddy, bless his soul

243
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:10,113
was her favorite.

244
00:10:10,113 --> 00:10:13,113
Why shouldn’t you
get the money?

245
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,113
I don’t like asking her,
Charlene

246
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:16,113
and that’s all.

247
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:18,113
Now let it be!

248
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:21,113
Grace:
I’ve been thinking

249
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:23,113
about luanne.

250
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:25,113
You know, my grandniece...

251
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:28,113
the one that’s been
writing me all those letters.

252
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:30,113
All these years, she’s written.

253
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:33,112
I think she’s
kind of fascinated with me

254
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:36,112
because I’m her oldest
living relative.

255
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:40,112
Anyway, she was going
to come see me this spring

256
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:41,112
and don’t you know

257
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:45,112
three days before she was due,
I fell down.

258
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:49,112
Roy had to call her
and tell her not to come.

259
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:51,112
She was so sad.

260
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:55,112
She really did want
to see my apple orchard.

261
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,112
So, I got thinking about it

262
00:10:58,112 --> 00:11:00,111
and... then I got a notion

263
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:06,111
and I got a way that might
show her my orchard.

264
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,111
It’s not finished,
but I want to let you see it

265
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:13,111
because I think you’ll get
a good idea.

266
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:16,111
There.

267
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:24,111
Look at that.

268
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:26,111
What do you think?

269
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,110
Bernice?

270
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,110
Bernice?

271
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,110
Oh...

272
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:04,109
I know you’d yell at me
for saying this

273
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:10,109
but... I bet anything
you believe in god now.

274
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,109
You don’t understand.

275
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:20,109
She has to stay here.

276
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:22,108
We can’t keep her
against her will, Roy.

277
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,108
And she’ll be
more comfortable at home.

278
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:26,108
Don’t worry.

279
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:29,108
Someone from hospice
will visit the farm today.

280
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:31,108
I told you. She
sold the farm.

281
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:33,108
If your grandmother avails
herself of their services.

282
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:37,108
Thank you.

283
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,108
Here I am.

284
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:40,108
Pharmacy had it
all ready.

285
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:43,108
Now, I showed you
how to use the drops for pain.

286
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:46,108
Any other questions,
there’s a leaflet inside

287
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:47,108
for you to read.

288
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:49,107
I... I don’t want it.

289
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:51,107
It’s just a waste.

290
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:52,107
You’re going
to need it, grace.

291
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:54,107
One more thing.

292
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,107
Keep it.

293
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:01,107
Bernice would have
wanted you to have it.

294
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:03,107
Oh, well, thank you.

295
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:06,107
Call us. Let us know
if there’s anything you need.

296
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:07,107
Sure.

297
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:11,107
Thank you.

298
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:15,106
She’s got the medicine.

299
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,106
Make sure
she uses it.

300
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:17,106
I’ll try.

301
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,106
You know my grandma.

302
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:21,106
You know how stubborn she is
about taking her medicine.

303
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:23,106
Yeah. I know.

304
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:28,106
I’d take you home
with me, but you’ve
seen our place.

305
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:32,106
Oh, honey, I don’t
want to live with you.

306
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:35,106
Well, then, you
should have stayed
at the nursing home.

307
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,106
Roy, I don’t want to die

308
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:41,106
in a cold, dreary room
like Bernice.

309
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:44,105
I want to die at home.

310
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:11,104
Man:
Now, get two other guys
to hold that up.

311
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:15,104
Man #2:
Get them over here right away.

312
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:19,104
Man #3:
Right here.

313
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:24,104
What are you
doing here?

314
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,104
Oh, praise heaven.

315
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:37,103
I thought my bones
was going to come out

316
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:39,103
right through my skin.

317
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,103
Hold on. Hold on.

318
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:41,103
Wait a second.

319
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:43,103
Let me help you there.

320
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,103
Oh... oh, dear.

321
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:46,103
Just... help me there.

322
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:47,103
Oh, that’s it.

323
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:51,103
Oh, thank you.

324
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,103
Thank you.

325
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:55,103
( Sighing )

326
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,103
Careful. Just lean on me.

327
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:01,103
Well, I’m glad
to be here.

328
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:05,102
I understand, grandma, but this
farm isn’t yours anymore.

329
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:08,102
Your Mr. Anders said I could
put my personal belongings

330
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:11,102
in the granny cottage.

331
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:15,102
And this body of mine is the
most personal belonging I got.

332
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,102
This old place...

333
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:32,101
Goodness.

334
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,101
You sit there.

335
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:40,101
Okay.

336
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:41,101
Okay?

337
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:42,101
Yeah.

338
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:43,101
I’ll get the bed made.

339
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:47,101
Want some fresh air?

340
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,101
Yeah.

341
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:50,101
Don’t you have
to go to work, honey?

342
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:52,101
Oh, I called Ernie.
He’s cool.

343
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,100
I’ll put some towels
in the bathroom.

344
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
You need an extra quilt?

345
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
No. No. Huh-uh.

346
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Okay, listen.

347
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
I, uh, I got to go
to the bank

348
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
to see Mr. Dudley, pay
off everything we owe.

349
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,099
On the way, I’ll
stop and I’ll get
some groceries.

350
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:28,099
You be okay here
for a few hours?

351
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:30,099
I’ll be just fine.

352
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:33,099
Let me help you into bed.

353
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,099
Okay.

354
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,099
Oops.

355
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:40,099
I got you.

356
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,099
I got you.

357
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:43,099
I got it.

358
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:46,099
There we go.
(Sighs)

359
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:54,098
Are you sure there’s
nothing else that you need?

360
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:55,098
No.

361
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,098
No. Just my knitting

362
00:16:57,098 --> 00:16:59,098
and, uh, that little,
uh, you know,

363
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:02,098
that little black
walk-a-thon thing.

364
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:05,098
Yeah. Okay.

365
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:06,098
Thank you.

366
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:12,098
I see your Mr. Saunders died
peacefully in his sleep.

367
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,098
It was his time.

368
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,098
He was 96.

369
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:19,097
Although the day
before he died...

370
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:21,097
He proposed to me.

371
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:24,097
And now I’m hoping
that my turning him down

372
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:25,097
isn’t what killed him.

373
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:29,097
You’ve done beautifully

374
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:31,097
with your first two
assignments, Gloria.

375
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:32,097
Thanks.

376
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:35,097
So, where to next?

377
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,097
Next?

378
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,097
You just lost
a patient.

379
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:39,097
Don’t you want
to take a break?

380
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:40,097
I told you,
Winnie

381
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:42,097
I like to keep busy.

382
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,097
I come from the corporate world
of 14-hour work days.

383
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,096
Looks like we
got a lively one.

384
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:47,096
A Mrs. Grace stiles.

385
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:48,096
When she went home

386
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:50,096
from the nursing
home today

387
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:52,096
she stashed
her pain medication

388
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:53,096
in the planter
by the front door.

389
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:56,096
Winnie:
Gloria, this is
Rosemary Allbright.

390
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:59,096
She’s been a hospice
volunteer for six years.

391
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:00,096
They don’t come
any better.

392
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:01,096
I pay her to say that.

393
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:04,096
Winnie:
How would you two
like to take on

394
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,096
Mrs. Grace stiles?

395
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:09,096
Rosemary:
It says in
her paperwork

396
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:12,095
she lives in
the cottage.

397
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,095
What in the world
is going on?

398
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:15,095
Gloria:
I have no idea.

399
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,095
But a terminally ill woman

400
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:19,095
shouldn’t have
to put up with this.

401
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:21,095
Try around to the left.

402
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:22,095
That looks
like a cottage.

403
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:29,095
Grace:

Mrs. Stiles?

410
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:48,094
Mrs. Stiles?

00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,094

416
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:05,094
Gloria:
You left your
door unlocked

417
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:07,093
so we’re letting
ourselves in.

418
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:09,093
Mrs. Stiles?

419
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:11,093
Mrs. Stiles.

420
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:12,093
Hello?
( Gasps )

421
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:15,093
Sorry. Didn’t mean
to startle you.

422
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:16,093
I’m Gloria greenwood

423
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:18,093
and this is
Rosemary Allbright.

424
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:19,093
We’re from hospice.

425
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,093
How we doing,
Mrs. Stiles?

426
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,093
Everything
all right?

427
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,093
Ladies, I can tell
by your lips moving

428
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:25,093
that you’re talking

429
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:27,093
but I can’t hear
a blessed word your saying.

430
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:29,093
And it’s not
’cause I’m deaf

431
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:31,093
if that’s what
you’re thinking.

432
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:33,092
It’s this Walkman,
handy long thing.

433
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:35,092
I just thought that me

434
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,092
and the, you know,
good news quartet

435
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,092
maybe we could drown
out some of that
racket out there.

436
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:44,092
Is there anyone
here with you,
Mrs. Stiles?

437
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:47,092
Well, I do
believe you are.

438
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:49,092
I’m sure I read
that your grandson...

439
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:51,092
Roy.

440
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:53,092
Roy... he’s looking
after you?

441
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,092
That’s right. He had
some things to do.

442
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:57,092
And he left you
here alone?

443
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:59,092
He’ll be back later.

444
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:01,091
But you need someone
here with you.

445
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:02,091
What for?

446
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:03,091
To care for you.

447
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:06,091
Rosemary:
I’m going
to call hospice.

448
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:08,091
Winnie Bradley should
know about this.

449
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:09,091
May I use your phone?

450
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:11,091
Yes. Around the corner.

451
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:15,091
It don’t work, though.

452
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,091
It hasn’t
been connected

453
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,091
up here in the cottage
since Gabriella stiles

454
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:20,091
you know

455
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:22,091
she passed on.

456
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:23,091
Gloria...

457
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,090
I should go back
and report this.

458
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,090
Not only is the
poor woman unattended

459
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,090
but she’s stranded
in the middle

460
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,090
of a construction site
without even a phone.

461
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,090
I’ll go over
the hospice agreement with her

462
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,090
while you’re gone.

463
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,090
Are you going
to be all right
until I get back?

464
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,090
Yes, we’ll be fine.

465
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,090
Where’s she going?

466
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,090
Is she going
after Roy?

467
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,090
No, we came to talk with you,
Mrs. Stiles, not Roy.

468
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,090
When you left
the nursing home
this morning

469
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,090
you forgot your
medication.

470
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,090
I didn’t forget it.

471
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,089
I told them
I didn’t want it.

472
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,089
I told them so.
Didn’t they
tell you that?

473
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,089
Yes, but...

474
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,089
Then what are you driving
out here pestering me for?

475
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,089
Mrs. Stiles,
may I sit down?

476
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:05,089
Listen, you people
have to learn something.

477
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,089
May I please
sit down?
You can’t always...

478
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,089
Honey, I’m not
the queen of England.

479
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,089
If you want to sit, sit.

480
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,089
Thank you.

481
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:18,089
Rosemary and I
are volunteers

482
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:20,089
from an organization
called hospice.

483
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:23,088
Didn’t your doctor
tell you about us?

484
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:24,088
Well, she might’ve.

485
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:27,088
But she’s one of them
medical women.

486
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:30,088
Talks a whole lot faster
than I can listen.

487
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,088
I see.

488
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:34,088
Have you had
any lunch?

489
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:36,088
Listen, dear, whatever
you’re selling

490
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:38,088
I know I’m way past
needing it.

491
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,088
The nurse told me
you didn’t touch

492
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:42,088
your breakfast
this morning.

493
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:45,088
So I packed a thermos
of chicken soup.

494
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:53,087
You know, one
of the services
hospice provid...

495
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:54,087
What is it,
Mrs. Stiles?

496
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:58,087
Do you need to go
to the bathroom?

497
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:02,087
Well, yes, I do,
if you must know.

498
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,087
I’ve been sitting
here all day

499
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:05,087
just trying to get up
enough strength.

500
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:08,087
You haven’t been
to the bathroom
since this morning?

501
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:09,087
It’s the middle
of the afternoon.

502
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,087
Believe me, I know.

503
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:13,087
I was doing fine, too

504
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:17,086
until that good news quartet
got me all revved up.

505
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,086
I don’t know...

506
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:22,086
I don’t think
I can...

507
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:23,086
You can do it.

508
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:25,086
All right.

509
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:28,086
Oh, no, I’m too dizzy.

510
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:31,086
No, it hurts too much.

511
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:32,086
I got to lie down.

512
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:34,086
Okay.

513
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,086
I’m going to get
your pain medication.

514
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:39,086
No drugs.

515
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:42,085
How many times do I have
to tell you people.

516
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:44,085
This ain’t pain anyway.

517
00:22:46,085 --> 00:22:47,085
You ever been in labor?

518
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:49,085
Yes, I have.

519
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:53,085
Well, then you know
what real pain is.

520
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:55,085
Up at the big
house up there

521
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:57,085
I had four babies.

522
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,085
Four boys.

523
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,085
The first one
come out feet first

524
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:04,085
hung onto my ribs
for 20 hours.

525
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,085
What are we going
to do about this?

526
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:08,085
Well, I’m just going to
have to hold it, I guess.

527
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:11,084
You can’t hold it.

528
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:14,084
Oh, honey, I was
the youngest

529
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,084
of 13 children.

530
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:17,084
We had one outhouse.

531
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:21,084
Believe me, I got
so I could hold
my water a week

532
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:23,084
standing in front
of Ruby falls.

533
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:26,084
I don’t suppose
you have a bedpan.

534
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:28,084
Why didn’t I think
to bring one?

535
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:33,084
Well, it’s not the kind
of thing you usually take

536
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:34,084
calling on a person.

537
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,083
How about this?

538
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,083
That’s a soup tureen.

539
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,083
That belonged to
Gabriella stiles...

540
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,083
my husband’s mother.

541
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,083
Sentimental value?

542
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,083
Well, let’s put it this way...

543
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:53,083
Gabriella, she lived with us
19 years.

544
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,083
19 of the slowest years
of my life.

545
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,083
It does have
the right shape.

546
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,082
Well, it does, doesn’t it?

547
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:08,082
No, no.

548
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:10,082
No, we just can’t
be thinking it.

549
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:13,082
Mrs. Stiles, I probably
shouldn’t even say this

550
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:16,082
but if I had
the opportunity

551
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:18,082
to do it in my
mother-in-law’s

552
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,082
soup tureen...

553
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:22,082
( Both laughing )

554
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:25,082
That’s a... that’s
a very nice suggestion

555
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:28,082
but you got to realize
I’m going to meet

556
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:30,081
Gabriella stiles
very soon.

557
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:33,081
Can you imagine spending
all eternity

558
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,081
with her following me around

559
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:37,081
crabbing about
her soup tureen?

560
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:42,081
Well, then we’re just going
to have to get you up.

561
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,081
I... I...

562
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:47,081
Just lean on me.

563
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:49,081
Here.

564
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:50,081
There you go.

565
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:52,081
All right.

566
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:53,081
Be slow now.

567
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:56,081
Mm-hmm. Got you.

568
00:24:56,081 --> 00:24:58,080
All right,
here we go.

569
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Your feet
are on the floor.

570
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Yeah.

571
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Do you mind...

572
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Do you mind telling me

573
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
what you’re
doing here again?

574
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Well, I’m just here
to help, that’s all.

575
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Help me what, die?

576
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,080
In a way, yes.

577
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Well, that’s a first.

578
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,079
Never had a stranger
just come to my door, and...

579
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,079
And try to help me die.

580
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,079
You done this before?

581
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,079
I’ve assisted
on two other hospice cases.

582
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,079
You... you do this
for a living?

583
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,079
I told you,
I’m a volunteer.

584
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,079
Oh. Oh, I see.

585
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,079
You, uh...
You volunteer

586
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,079
to help perfect
strangers die.

587
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,078
Is this... is this
some kind of custom?

588
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:54,078
You know, something I
just haven’t heard about?

589
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:56,078
Oh, well.

590
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:03,078
You happen to be
a perfect example

591
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,078
of what hospice
is about.

592
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:08,078
Your grandson picks you up
from the nursing home

593
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:10,078
and just dumps you here,
all alone

594
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:11,078
with no one to turn to.

595
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:17,078
Uh-huh. And where was
the good lord today

596
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:20,077
when you needed help
getting to the bathroom?

597
00:26:25,077 --> 00:26:26,077
( Toilet flushing )

598
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:28,077
Until we get everything
straightened out

599
00:26:28,077 --> 00:26:30,077
with your grandson,

600
00:26:30,077 --> 00:26:32,077
is there somebody who can
stay here with you?

601
00:26:32,077 --> 00:26:34,077
Maybe somebody
from your church?

602
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:46,076
Here, I’ll help you back.

603
00:26:46,076 --> 00:26:48,076
Better?

604
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:50,076
Yeah.

605
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,076
You know, I just
can’t believe

606
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:54,076
that I even thought
about doing that

607
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:56,076
in the family China.

608
00:26:56,076 --> 00:26:58,076
Talk about being sinful.

609
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:01,076
Well, relax,
it’s not so sinful

610
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:05,076
to put the wrong thing
in the wrong China.

611
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:07,076
Here.

612
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:09,076
Unless you’re
keeping kosher.

613
00:27:09,076 --> 00:27:10,076
Unless I’m what?

614
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:12,075
Oh, nothing,
a little joke.

615
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:15,075
Okay, now I’m going
to fix up

616
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:16,075
that soup I promised.

617
00:27:16,075 --> 00:27:18,075
Hope you’re hungry.

618
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:19,075
I am a little.

619
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:22,075
I’m just going
to find something
to put it in.

620
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,075
Okay.

621
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,075
Oh, honey,
I’ve got an idea.

622
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:33,075
I’m worried about her, Gloria.

623
00:27:33,075 --> 00:27:35,075
Didn’t touch her supper.

624
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:37,075
Said she might eat
an egg in the morning.

625
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:40,074
I left at 6:00 and her grandson
still hadn’t come back.

626
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:41,074
But she says he works late.

627
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:42,074
( Sighs )

628
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:44,074
Winnie called.

629
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:45,074
We can’t go back there
after tomorrow

630
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:48,074
if she keeps refusing to sign
this hospice agreement.

631
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:50,074
I went over it with her
a dozen different ways.

632
00:27:50,074 --> 00:27:53,074
"I’m not signing nothing"
is all she kept saying.

633
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,074
Let me take the morning shift.

634
00:27:58,074 --> 00:27:59,074
See what I can do.

635
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:13,073
( Chickens clucking )

636
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:15,073
Shoo!

637
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,073
Shoo!

638
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:19,073
Mrs. Stiles?

639
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,073
Shoo!

640
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,073
Mrs. Stiles, it’s Gloria.

641
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:26,073
Great.

642
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:28,073
It’s Gloria,
Mrs. Stiles.

643
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,073
Can I come in?

644
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:31,073
( Squawks )

645
00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:33,072
I’m coming in.

646
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:34,072
Hi.

647
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:36,072
Good morning.

648
00:28:36,072 --> 00:28:37,072
How are you?

649
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:39,072
Good morning.

650
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:42,072
There are chickens
all over your front porch.

651
00:28:42,072 --> 00:28:44,072
Yeah. I usually
feed them

652
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:45,072
this time of morning.

653
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:47,072
Roy’s been doing it for me.

654
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:49,072
Uh-huh, huh. There.

655
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:54,072
May I ask just what it is
you’re doing here?

656
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:55,072
Oh. Well, you told Rosemary

657
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:57,072
that you might eat an egg
this morning

658
00:28:57,072 --> 00:28:59,072
so I dropped by
to fix it for you.

659
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:03,071
Oh, sure. You drove 20 miles
up the mountain to drop by?

660
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:06,071
Mrs. Stiles, it’s damp in here.

661
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:08,071
What can we do to warm you up?

662
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:10,071
Do you have
a thermostat?

663
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:12,071
No. I just use the stove.

664
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:14,071
Stove?

665
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:16,071
Oh, the stove.

666
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:17,071
( Chuckles )

667
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:18,071
Look at this.

668
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:20,071
Huh. Where is Roy?

669
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:24,071
You told Rosemary he was going
to stay with you last night?

670
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:26,071
Roy was here.

671
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:29,070
He was here till 8:00 or later.

672
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,070
That’s when I closed my eyes,
I pretended to go to sleep.

673
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,070
You pretended to go to sleep?

674
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,070
So he would go home.

675
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,070
Roy has better things to do
than baby-sit a sick old woman.

676
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,070
Oh.

677
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,070
Now, listen, honey.

678
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,070
I feel much stronger today.

679
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,070
I’ve been up already
and I don’t need any help.

680
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,069
I think you should just,
you know, go on

681
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:57,069
and just get on
with your day.

682
00:29:57,069 --> 00:30:00,069
I will...
as soon as I get you fed.

683
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:03,069
I suppose
you cook on this thing.

684
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:06,069
Listen, I don’t know how
to say this much plainer.

685
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:09,069
Not to worry, Mrs. Stiles.
I’m no novice

686
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:10,069
at building fires.

687
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:12,069
The fire goes in here, right?

688
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:15,069
That’s the oven, child.

689
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:19,069
Shoo! Shoo!

690
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,069
Shoo.

691
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:23,068
Mrs. Stiles...

692
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:25,068
Are you sure you don’t
have something here

693
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:27,068
we could just plug in?

694
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,068
Don’t like my food
cooked with electricity.

695
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:31,068
It tastes funny.

696
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:33,068
Good god, we’re just going
to have a boiled egg.

697
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:35,068
I don’t see
what difference it makes

698
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,068
how you get the water to boil.

699
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:40,068
Glorie, you have acquired
a very unpleasant habit

700
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:42,068
of using
the lord’s name in vain.

701
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:45,068
Oh, you mean "good god"?

702
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:48,067
It’s just as easy to say "good
heavens" or... "Good gravy.

703
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,067
"Good gravy."

704
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:53,067
I will try to remember that.

705
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:56,067
And... my name is "Gloria."

706
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:59,067
Glori-a.

707
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:02,067
All right, I’ll try
to remember that.

708
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:13,067
How you
doing, boss?

709
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,066
( Match scratching stovetop )

710
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:26,066
( Chickens clucking )

711
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:27,066
( Groans )

712
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:29,066
All right,
I can do this.

713
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:35,066
Are you sure
this thing is safe?

714
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:38,066
Yeah. Just put the lid
back on top.

715
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:39,066
I knew that.

716
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:41,065
And close
the front door.

717
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,065
The chickens

718
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:44,065
are coming in.

719
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:46,065
Chickens...

720
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:47,065
Come on.

721
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:49,065
Come on!
Okay, out!

722
00:31:49,065 --> 00:31:51,065
Ah.

723
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:52,065
Out you go.

724
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:54,065
Phew-shoo!

725
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:57,065
I have black all over my hands.

726
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,065
How does this thing work?

727
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:01,065
It’s got a handle
and a spout.

728
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:03,065
How do you think it works?

729
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:05,065
Well, humor me, Mrs. Stiles.

730
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:07,065
I’m not a morning person.

731
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:09,064
Oh, honey!

732
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,064
Honey, the stove.

733
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,064
( Gasps )
The stove!

734
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:16,064
I thought you said
this thing was safe.

735
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:18,064
It is. It’s just the damper.

736
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:19,064
Wha... I can’t...

737
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,064
I can’t even use the phone
to call anybody.

738
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,064
It doesn’t work.

739
00:32:23,064 --> 00:32:25,064
And by the time I pump
enough water by hand...

740
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:27,064
I’m going to get you
out of here.

741
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:29,064
What are you doing?

742
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:30,064
Open the damper.

743
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:31,064
We’re going outside.

744
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:32,064
Get away from me.

745
00:32:32,064 --> 00:32:34,064
Stop that.
We’re going out.

746
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:36,063
Go over there
and open that damper!

747
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:38,063
Look, look, you see
that metal thing

748
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:40,063
sticking out of that pipe
right above the stove?

749
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:42,063
Go turn it.
Why?

750
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:43,063
Because we’re
going to...

751
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:46,063
Choke to death
on-on the smoke.

752
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:47,063
( Groans )

753
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:48,063
Here goes.

754
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:50,063
( Loud hiss and rattle )

755
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:51,063
Oh! Aah!

756
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:53,063
Well!

757
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,063
I’m sorry, Mrs. Stiles.

758
00:32:54,063 --> 00:32:58,063
Sometimes, good gravy
just doesn’t cut it.

759
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,063
Open the window.

760
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:03,062
Good heavens,
I don’t think

761
00:33:03,062 --> 00:33:07,062
I ever met anybody
quite as-as...

762
00:33:07,062 --> 00:33:09,062
Civilized?

763
00:33:09,062 --> 00:33:12,062
That isn’t the word
I was reaching for

764
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:15,062
but it-it’ll have to do.

765
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:16,062
( Clanking )

766
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:25,062
All right.

767
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:27,062
Put a lid on that; The water

768
00:33:27,062 --> 00:33:28,062
will boil faster.

769
00:33:28,062 --> 00:33:30,061
Now I know
why you country people

770
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:32,061
eat such hearty breakfasts.

771
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,061
It’s a day’s work
just to boil an egg.

772
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:39,061
Well, don’t just stand there

773
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,061
watching it.

774
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,061
Why not?

775
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,061
A watched pot never boils.

776
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:45,061
Since when?

777
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:46,061
Just take
my word for it.

778
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:48,061
You want to
get the eggs?

779
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:49,061
They’re on
the counter

780
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,061
over there
by the window.

781
00:33:51,061 --> 00:33:53,061
Roy gathered them
last night.

782
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,060
Oh, yuck!

783
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,060
Mrs. Stiles,
these eggs...

784
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,060
They’re covered in...

785
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,060
Bird... stuff.

786
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,060
Well, then, wash them off.

787
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
What’s that smoke?

788
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
Man:
God, look
at that!

789
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,059
Man: Let’s go.
Check it out.
Let’s go.

790
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:25,059
You know, I think this would
be a whole lot easier

791
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,059
if you got in bed and I got up

792
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:29,059
and made you breakfast.
( Banging )

793
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:31,059
( Gasps )
What’s going on?

794
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:33,059
What are you two
doing here?

795
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:34,059
What are you doing here?

796
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:36,059
Mr. Anders, sir...

797
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:37,059
That place’s on fire.

798
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:38,059
No, no, it’s not.

799
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:40,059
It’s probably
just the stove.

800
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:41,059
Who’s this?

801
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:42,059
I’m Roy stiles.

802
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:44,059
This is my wife
Charlene.

803
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:46,059
This was
my grandma’s farm.

804
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,059
False alarm,
Mr. Anders.

805
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,059
There’s no fire.

806
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,058
A couple ladies
in there trying

807
00:34:50,058 --> 00:34:51,058
to boil an egg.

808
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:52,058
What?!

809
00:34:52,058 --> 00:34:54,058
Gloria:
Wait a minute.

810
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:57,058
I want to talk with
whoever’s in charge out here.

811
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:58,058
Would that be you?

812
00:34:58,058 --> 00:35:00,058
Lady, I don’t know who you are

813
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,058
but you are trespassing
on private property.

814
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,058
If you and whoever else

815
00:35:03,058 --> 00:35:05,058
you got inside there
don’t get going

816
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:07,058
in one minute,
I’m calling the sheriff.

817
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:09,058
I’m Gloria greenwood,
a hospice volunteer

818
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:11,058
caring for an elderly woman
inside

819
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:13,058
who happens
to be terminally ill.

820
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:15,058
I’m trying
to tell you,
Mr. Anders

821
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:17,057
my grandma, she’s moved
back into the cottage.

822
00:35:17,057 --> 00:35:18,057
She can’t do that!

823
00:35:18,057 --> 00:35:19,057
Well, she has!

824
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:21,057
So if you and your neanderthals

825
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:24,057
don’t get away from this cottage
in less than a minute

826
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:25,057
I’m going to call the sheriff.

827
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:28,057
Don’t you touch my orchard!

828
00:35:28,057 --> 00:35:30,057
Don’t you get too comfortable

829
00:35:30,057 --> 00:35:32,057
in there,
Mrs. Stiles!

830
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:34,057
You’re not staying long.

831
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:37,057
Well, it boiled.

832
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:39,057
One of the lord’s
little miracles.

833
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:40,057
I can do that.

834
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:42,057
Oh. Uh,
two minutes?

835
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,056
Well, better
make it three.

836
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:46,056
Three.

837
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:49,056
Oh, uh, glori-a...

838
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:51,056
Uh, meet Charlene.

839
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:52,056
This is
Roy’s wife.

840
00:35:52,056 --> 00:35:54,056
You’re not from
around here, are you?

841
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:56,056
I’m from New York.

842
00:35:56,056 --> 00:35:58,056
Uh, but I live
here now.

843
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,056
Hmm.

844
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:02,056
Well, Roy would
just have loved

845
00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:05,056
to see New York,
wouldn’t you, honey?

846
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:07,056
I mean, he just got an itch
in his britches.

847
00:36:07,056 --> 00:36:08,056
Just wants to travel

848
00:36:08,056 --> 00:36:09,056
around the world.

849
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:11,055
Grandma.

850
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:13,055
Honey, I surely wanted

851
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:15,055
to leave you this land,

852
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:19,055
and I would’ve
if your daddy and me

853
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:21,055
just could have died easy.

854
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:24,055
Charlene:
But since you’ve
just sold the farm

855
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:25,055
surely there must have
been some profit.

856
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:27,055
No, Charlene,
there wasn’t!

857
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:28,055
Okay? Not a penny...

858
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:30,055
By the time
I got finished

859
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,055
paying off the back taxes

860
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:33,055
the rest
of the farm’s debt

861
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:35,055
the mountain
of medical bills

862
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:37,055
from my dad
and now my grandma’s bills

863
00:36:37,055 --> 00:36:38,054
on top of that.

864
00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:41,054
But we aren’t
leaving any debts, Roy.

865
00:36:41,054 --> 00:36:44,054
Not many farmers
can say that.

866
00:36:44,054 --> 00:36:47,054
I’ll be waiting in the car, Roy.

867
00:36:52,054 --> 00:36:53,054
Hmm...

868
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:55,054
( Clears throat )

869
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:57,054
I’m curious about
this Anders guy.

870
00:36:57,054 --> 00:37:00,054
I wonder if I could talk
with the lawyer

871
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:02,054
you used to, uh,
sell the property.

872
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,054
I didn’t have one.

873
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:07,053
You didn’t have a lawyer?

874
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:09,053
No. The fella down at the bank,
he took care

875
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:10,053
of everything.

876
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:12,053
Oh, what about
your contract?

877
00:37:12,053 --> 00:37:14,053
The one you signed?

878
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:17,053
You did read it, didn’t you?

879
00:37:20,053 --> 00:37:23,053
What is it, Mrs. Stiles?

880
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:27,053
You can read, can’t you?

881
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:35,052
My not being able to read’s got
nothing to do with anything.

882
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:38,052
And I’m not ignorant,
if that’s what you think.

883
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:41,052
I ran this farm
after my husband died

884
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:43,052
and my being able to read

885
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,052
or not able to read

886
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:46,052
never mattered none.

887
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:47,052
( Softly ):
Okay.

888
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:48,052
Mrs. Greenwood,
our personal lives

889
00:37:48,052 --> 00:37:50,052
are really none
of your business.

890
00:37:50,052 --> 00:37:53,052
Now, the farm is gone
and that’s that.

891
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:56,052
Now, I came here today
to try and talk my grandma

892
00:37:56,052 --> 00:37:58,052
into going back
to the nursing home.

893
00:37:58,052 --> 00:38:01,051
No, Roy, I can’t do it.

894
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:02,051
Grandma, would you look
out there?

895
00:38:02,051 --> 00:38:04,051
It is like a war zone.

896
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,051
This Anders,
he’s going to come here

897
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:07,051
with the sheriff
and the state police

898
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:10,051
and he’s going
to drag you
out of here.

899
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:12,051
It doesn’t have
to be that way, Roy.

900
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:14,051
We can stop him.

901
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:16,051
Roy:
I don’t want
to stop him!

902
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:18,051
Can’t you get that
through your head?!

903
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,050
Honey, the fridge we ordered
won’t fit

904
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,050
so we either have to exchange it
for a smaller one

905
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,050
or move the
kitchen wall.

906
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,050
She sold
a 250-acre farm

907
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,050
and didn’t even have
an attorney

908
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,050
to look at the contract.

909
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,050
What’s it
going to be?

910
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,050
The wall or
the fridge?

911
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,050
Poor woman
can’t even read.

912
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,050
Smaller fridge. Okay.

913
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,050
You’re not listening
to me.

914
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,050
No, honey. You see,
you’re not listening to me.

915
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,050
I’m supposed to be
in court right now

916
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,050
helping Philn
in the Hillborough case

917
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,049
but our contractor here
has 50 urgent questions

918
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:54,049
and you can’t be found.

919
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:55,049
I’ve been out

920
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:56,049
with Mrs. Stiles.
You know that.

921
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:59,049
Mrs. Stiles is not your problem.

922
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:01,049
This is your problem.

923
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,049
She happens to be my patient.

924
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,049
Not according
to Winnie Bradley, who left

925
00:39:05,049 --> 00:39:07,049
two rather
terse messages
on the machine.

926
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:09,049
Something about
some unsigned
hospice forms?

927
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:12,049
There are bulldozers crawling
all over her property.

928
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,049
The fumes,
the filth, the noise...

929
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:16,049
Mrs. Stiles hasn’t been able
to sleep, to eat.

930
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:19,049
What they’re doing out there
can’t be legal.

931
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:20,048
What you are
doing out there

932
00:39:20,048 --> 00:39:22,048
is definitely
not legal.

933
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:25,048
( Sighing ):
Honey...

934
00:39:25,048 --> 00:39:27,048
David... wait.

935
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:28,048
I’m asking you for help.

936
00:39:28,048 --> 00:39:30,048
How often does
that happen?

937
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,048
Look, just please look
into it for me, all right?

938
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:36,048
Make sure the
contract’s good.

939
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:37,048
Please?

940
00:39:40,048 --> 00:39:41,048
Please?

941
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:44,048
There is a standard
legal paragraph

942
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,047
in cases like this
which entitles the seller

943
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:49,047
to quiet possession
and peaceful enjoyment

944
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:51,047
for a reasonable period.

945
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:53,047
Mm-ah! I knew I
could count on you.

946
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,047
I’m going to call
that contractor

947
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:56,047
right away.

948
00:39:56,047 --> 00:40:00,047
Oh, uh, about the kitchen...
move the wall.

949
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:02,047
Move the wall.

950
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,047
Oh, and you won’t forget

951
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:06,047
about this
evening, right?

952
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:08,047
This evening?

953
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:09,047
My reception?

954
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:11,047
Country club?

955
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:13,047
Being sworn in
as a member

956
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:14,046
of the state bar?

957
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:17,046
Country club. Of course
I’ll be there, but

958
00:40:17,046 --> 00:40:18,046
we won’t stay

959
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:20,046
too late, will we?

960
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:22,046
I have to get up early
in the morning.

961
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:23,046
Gloria?

962
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,046
Yeah?

963
00:40:27,046 --> 00:40:33,046
Honey, you haven’t even tried
to make any friends at the club.

964
00:40:33,046 --> 00:40:34,046
Honey, I told you those people

965
00:40:34,046 --> 00:40:36,046
just don’t interest me
right now.

966
00:40:36,046 --> 00:40:37,046
And why is that?

967
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:39,046
Because they don’t have

968
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:40,046
one foot in
the grave?

969
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:47,045
Hey... come here.

970
00:40:52,045 --> 00:40:53,045
Look...

971
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:57,045
Ever since last year

972
00:40:57,045 --> 00:41:00,045
nothing seems
to interest you

973
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:04,045
but death... not me,
not our marriage...

974
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,045
Our lives.

975
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:25,044
Hi.

976
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:26,044
Hi.

977
00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:28,044
( Sighing )

978
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:29,044
You been here all morning?

979
00:41:29,044 --> 00:41:32,044
Yes. Gloria, we need
to talk about this.

980
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:34,044
Oh, I know. I spoke
to Winnie on the way out here.

981
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:37,043
She will not sign
the hospice agreement.

982
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:38,043
We can’t stay here.

983
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:39,043
What are we supposed to do?

984
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:40,043
Abandon her?

985
00:41:40,043 --> 00:41:42,043
We have no choice.

986
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:46,043
Mrs. Stiles, why did
you tell Rosemary

987
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:49,043
you don’t want a
hospice team here?

988
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,043
Because I don’t.

989
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:52,043
Well, then I’m going
to have to leave, too.

990
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:55,043
Well, that’s up to you, I guess.

991
00:41:55,043 --> 00:41:56,043
Don’t worry.

992
00:41:56,043 --> 00:41:59,043
The doctor said I would have
good days and bad days.

993
00:41:59,043 --> 00:42:01,043
I’ll be just fine.

994
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:03,042
Look, this is a telephone.

995
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:04,042
No.

996
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:05,042
Please. If you
want any help

997
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:07,042
or you just want to
talk about anything

998
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,042
please, push
the green button

999
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,042
and you’ll reach
me, all right?

1000
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:12,042
I don’t think that
will be necessary.

1001
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:14,042
It’ll make me feel
much better. Please.

1002
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:16,042
Are you sure I can’t make you

1003
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,042
something to eat
before I go?

1004
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:19,042
Don’t want nothing.

1005
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:22,042
But, you know,
while you’re feeling

1006
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:24,042
so helpful
and all

1007
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,042
it would be awful nice if...

1008
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:29,041
If you could take me
down to the church.

1009
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:31,041
The church you stopped
going to 40 years ago?

1010
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:35,041
There’s somebody down there
I’d like to see.

1011
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,041
J.P. Conklin.

1012
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:40,041
He come in when our
old pastor got sick.

1013
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:43,041
Boy, was he good-looking.

1014
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,041
Really?

1015
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:48,041
Made me feel like a lump
of lard on a hot skillet.

1016
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:50,041
Only man in my whole life

1017
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:53,041
ever said out loud
I was pretty.

1018
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:56,040
Mrs. Stiles,
that is so sweet.

1019
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,040
Nothing sweet about it.

1020
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,040
Turn left right up there.

1021
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,040
You could come in
if you wanted to.

1022
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
I’ll wait
out here for you.

1023
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
Don’t you think, uh...?

1024
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
Well, maybe you
should get on home.

1025
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,039
You know, you’ve
done enough already.

1026
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:26,039
And, uh, I know
you must have family

1027
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,039
that needs taking care of
or... a job.

1028
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,039
I had a job...
in New York.

1029
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,039
I was with a national
consulting firm.

1030
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:36,039
We fixed businesses.

1031
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:40,039
You know, big corporations
who get fiscally sick...

1032
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:43,039
and we’d go in
and revive them.

1033
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,039
Revive them?

1034
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,039
Mm-hmm. We’d save them.

1035
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,039
Oh... so you’ve got a...

1036
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:50,038
You’ve got a history
of saving things.

1037
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:52,038
What I want to say is,

1038
00:43:52,038 --> 00:43:55,038
in addition to
the hospice work,

1039
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:59,038
I could help you
get your legal
affairs in order.

1040
00:43:59,038 --> 00:44:02,038
Glorie, there’s something

1041
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:08,038
I haven’t quite figured out
about you...

1042
00:44:08,038 --> 00:44:09,038
But I will.

1043
00:44:23,037 --> 00:44:25,037
Man 1:
...I’m sure you’ll
be good at that.

1044
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:28,037
Man 2:
We appreciate your
good advice, reverend.

1045
00:44:28,037 --> 00:44:29,037
Woman:
Yes.

1046
00:44:29,037 --> 00:44:30,037
Good idea.

1047
00:44:30,037 --> 00:44:31,037
Congratulations.

1048
00:44:31,037 --> 00:44:33,037
See you next Sunday.

1049
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,037
Woman:
Next Sunday.

1050
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:55,036
Grace?

1051
00:44:57,036 --> 00:44:58,036
Grace stiles?

1052
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:02,036
As I live and breathe.

1053
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:05,036
I wasn’t sure you’d
recognize me, John Patrick.

1054
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,036
Of course
I recognize you...

1055
00:45:07,036 --> 00:45:11,035
But I’m flabbergasted
you’re actually here.

1056
00:45:11,035 --> 00:45:14,035
Well, it wasn’t anything
I planned, believe me.

1057
00:45:14,035 --> 00:45:16,035
I haven’t thought about
you in a million years.

1058
00:45:25,035 --> 00:45:27,035
I’m very glad to see you.

1059
00:45:27,035 --> 00:45:31,035
Me, too.

1060
00:45:33,035 --> 00:45:34,035
How have
you been, grace?

1061
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:37,035
Just fine.

1062
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,034
The guidelines
in the hospice handbook

1063
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:41,034
clearly state that...

1064
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:42,034
I understand

1065
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:43,034
every detail
of the handbook

1066
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:46,034
and it all worked fine
for patients like

1067
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,034
Mr. Saunders
and Mr. Barnes

1068
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:50,034
but grace stiles isn’t
dying by the book.

1069
00:45:50,034 --> 00:45:52,034
No one does, Gloria.

1070
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:55,034
And no matter what, we try
to train our volunteers

1071
00:45:55,034 --> 00:45:57,034
not to become
emotionally involved.

1072
00:45:57,034 --> 00:45:59,034
I couldn’t help it.

1073
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:01,034
I love that woman.

1074
00:46:01,034 --> 00:46:04,034
And if her faith is giving her
the strength she needs

1075
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:06,033
to get through this
without painkillers

1076
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:08,033
who am I to tell her
differently?

1077
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:11,033
I understand
that my going out there

1078
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:13,033
is putting hospice in jeopardy.

1079
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:16,033
That’s why I thought
it best to resign.

1080
00:46:16,033 --> 00:46:19,033
( Sighs )

1081
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:21,033
We need you too much.

1082
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:24,033
Grace does, too.

1083
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,033
Go and do what you must.

1084
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:31,033
We’ll, uh... we’ll find
a way to support you.

1085
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:35,032
Oh... thank you.

1086
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:39,032
Look here. I got
the sleeves done.

1087
00:46:39,032 --> 00:46:41,032
Now all I have to do
is the top.

1088
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:44,032
This is beautiful.

1089
00:46:44,032 --> 00:46:46,032
It’s a work of art.

1090
00:46:46,032 --> 00:46:48,032
Well, it looks
just like the...

1091
00:46:48,032 --> 00:46:49,032
The orchard.

1092
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:51,032
Yeah, I thought it’d be nice

1093
00:46:51,032 --> 00:46:53,032
if luanne could just see
what it looks like.

1094
00:46:53,032 --> 00:46:54,032
Who’s luanne?

1095
00:46:54,032 --> 00:46:55,032
Luanne, my great niece.

1096
00:46:55,032 --> 00:46:57,032
That’s her picture right there.

1097
00:46:57,032 --> 00:47:00,031
She and Roy
are the only ones of my kin

1098
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:01,031
that still bother with me.

1099
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:04,031
She’s my youngest
older brother’s

1100
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:08,031
middle son’s first daughter’s
third child.

1101
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,031
By her second marriage.

1102
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:11,031
Oh. Well...

1103
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:13,031
Who can compete
with that?

1104
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,031
( Laughing )

1105
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,031
Oh, look
in the wicker basket there.

1106
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:19,031
Right at the foot
of the bed.

1107
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:24,031
Well, somebody likes
to write letters.

1108
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:29,030
Me and luanne, we have
a real close connection.

1109
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,030
She’s going
to be 13 this month.

1110
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,030
I thought I’d put
this in a box

1111
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,030
and have Roy
mail it to her.

1112
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,030
You don’t think
he’ll forget, do you?

1113
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:41,030
Men are... men are careless

1114
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,030
about such things.

1115
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,030
I’ll mail it for you.

1116
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,030
Would you?

1117
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,030
I’ll have Roy give you
the address and...

1118
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,030
And money for the postage...

1119
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:56,029
And... I thank you.

1120
00:47:58,029 --> 00:48:00,029
( Sighing )

1121
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:04,029
( Humming "the church
in the Wildwood" )

1122
00:48:10,029 --> 00:48:12,029
You want me to find you
something to do? Hmm?

1123
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:15,029
Oh, I’m fine.

1124
00:48:15,029 --> 00:48:17,029
But you’re just standing there.

1125
00:48:17,029 --> 00:48:18,029
I’m thinking.

1126
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:21,028
Yeah, well,
thinking isn’t doing.

1127
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:24,028
"Thinking" is just a fancy word
for idleness

1128
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:28,028
and we all know that idleness
is the devil’s workshop.

1129
00:48:28,028 --> 00:48:29,028
Mrs. Stiles

1130
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:31,028
I don’t believe in the devil.

1131
00:48:31,028 --> 00:48:32,028
( Laughing )

1132
00:48:32,028 --> 00:48:35,028
You think he cares about that?

1133
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:38,028
And what’s that picking
at your fingers you’re doing?

1134
00:48:38,028 --> 00:48:40,028
Well, because,
in the last few days

1135
00:48:40,028 --> 00:48:44,028
I have managed to tear up
every one of my nails.

1136
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:45,028
Every one.

1137
00:48:45,028 --> 00:48:53,027
Oh. Well, you just go on home
and sit in your fancy bathtub

1138
00:48:53,027 --> 00:48:56,027
and let your fingernails
grow back.

1139
00:48:56,027 --> 00:48:58,027
I’m going to find
something to do.

1140
00:48:58,027 --> 00:49:00,027
There’s a bag in there
under the table

1141
00:49:00,027 --> 00:49:02,027
with scraps of fabric.

1142
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:03,027
I don’t know
how to sew.

1143
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:05,027
Nobody said sewing.

1144
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:08,027
It’s, uh... it’s quilting.

1145
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:09,027
Here, I’ll show you.

1146
00:49:09,027 --> 00:49:11,027
I’ll bring it
in to you.

1147
00:49:11,027 --> 00:49:13,027
No. No. I’m having a...
Real good day.

1148
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:15,026
You’re supposed
to keep moving.

1149
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:18,026
Ask me, you think too much.

1150
00:49:18,026 --> 00:49:20,026
No garden in this world
ever got planted

1151
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:23,026
by thinking about it.

1152
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,026
Yes, Mrs. Stiles.

1153
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:26,026
And you don’t use
that tone with me.

1154
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:28,026
I’m not your mother.

1155
00:49:28,026 --> 00:49:30,026
All right. Now, you take
this piece of cardboard.

1156
00:49:30,026 --> 00:49:32,026
Just put it
on top of your fabric

1157
00:49:32,026 --> 00:49:34,026
and cut around it.

1158
00:49:34,026 --> 00:49:35,026
Okay?

1159
00:49:35,026 --> 00:49:37,026
All right.

1160
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:45,025
How’s that?

1161
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:47,025
Work o’ art.

1162
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,025
Do another one, glorie.

1163
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:52,025
Mrs. Stiles,
my name isn’t glorie.

1164
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:54,025
It’s... it’s Gloria.

1165
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:58,025
Well, my name isn’t
Mrs. Stiles, either.

1166
00:49:58,025 --> 00:49:59,025
It’s grace.

1167
00:50:00,025 --> 00:50:02,025
Come on.

1168
00:50:02,025 --> 00:50:03,025
I want to show you something.

1169
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:14,024
That picture there...
that’s Mr. Stiles, my husband.

1170
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:16,024
Them others,
that’s my kids.

1171
00:50:19,024 --> 00:50:21,024
That’s right.

1172
00:50:21,024 --> 00:50:23,024
You have four children.

1173
00:50:23,024 --> 00:50:25,024
Where are they now?

1174
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:31,024
I’m sorry. Was that
a personal question?

1175
00:50:31,024 --> 00:50:32,024
No. That’s all right.

1176
00:50:34,024 --> 00:50:38,023
I’ll... I’ll show you
where they are.

1177
00:50:42,023 --> 00:50:43,023
That’s my husband.

1178
00:50:43,023 --> 00:50:47,023
Those are my kids
down there.

1179
00:50:49,023 --> 00:50:51,023
You lost all four
of your children?

1180
00:50:51,023 --> 00:50:53,023
Yep.

1181
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:54,023
Ronnie...

1182
00:50:54,023 --> 00:50:56,023
he was the baby.

1183
00:50:56,023 --> 00:50:59,023
I went in to him
one morning.

1184
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:01,023
He wasn’t breathing.

1185
00:51:01,023 --> 00:51:02,022
Doctor come.

1186
00:51:02,022 --> 00:51:06,022
He said these things
just happen.

1187
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:12,022
Duane... he was hunting
with his daddy.

1188
00:51:12,022 --> 00:51:15,022
Stumbled over
some barbed wire in the snow.

1189
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:17,022
Gun went off.

1190
00:51:17,022 --> 00:51:18,022
Colin?

1191
00:51:18,022 --> 00:51:20,022
Vietnamese war.

1192
00:51:23,022 --> 00:51:26,022
Really the only one that
had a chance to grow up

1193
00:51:26,022 --> 00:51:29,021
was Roger Lee.

1194
00:51:29,021 --> 00:51:30,021
He’s Roy’s daddy.

1195
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:34,021
How did you deal with that?

1196
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:37,021
Losing them, I mean.

1197
00:51:40,021 --> 00:51:41,021
I grieved.

1198
00:51:43,021 --> 00:51:45,021
I still do.

1199
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:48,021
But it was the
good lord’s will.

1200
00:51:50,021 --> 00:51:52,021
You didn’t question that?

1201
00:51:52,021 --> 00:51:55,021
The good lord’s will?

1202
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,020
Gloria, what
happened to you?

1203
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,020
Tell me about
your children.

1204
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,020
Pardon me?

1205
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,020
You said you was in labor.

1206
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,020
We had a son.

1207
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,020
His name was Billy.

1208
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:19,020
He was, uh, killed
in an automobile accident

1209
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,020
over a year ago.

1210
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:26,019
( Sighing )

1211
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:28,019
You poor thing.

1212
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:33,019
Why do young people think

1213
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:36,019
they have to drive so
fast nowadays anyway?

1214
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,019
He was eight years old, grace.

1215
00:52:38,019 --> 00:52:40,019
He wasn’t driving.

1216
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:43,019
I was.

1217
00:52:50,018 --> 00:52:52,018
How’s your hip?

1218
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:53,018
Oh!

1219
00:52:53,018 --> 00:52:54,018
Feel all right?

1220
00:52:54,018 --> 00:52:56,018
Yeah, hip’s wonderful.

1221
00:52:56,018 --> 00:52:57,018
You tell me why...

1222
00:52:57,018 --> 00:53:00,018
Why part of my body’s
getting better

1223
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:01,018
and the other part’s
dying.

1224
00:53:03,018 --> 00:53:05,018
Weeds.

1225
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:09,018
You know, when they
plant me here,

1226
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:11,018
I’m going to work on them

1227
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:13,018
from underneath.

1228
00:53:13,018 --> 00:53:16,017
Just going
to pull them down.

1229
00:53:16,017 --> 00:53:17,017
It’s getting cold.

1230
00:53:17,017 --> 00:53:18,017
( Groaning )

1231
00:53:18,017 --> 00:53:21,017
Oh, grace. Grace...

1232
00:53:21,017 --> 00:53:23,017
You hurt so much.

1233
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:28,017
Shh. Don’t move, don’t move.

1234
00:53:28,017 --> 00:53:30,017
Just let me hold you.

1235
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:42,017
( Gasping )

1236
00:53:49,016 --> 00:53:52,016
Will you look at those trees?

1237
00:53:54,016 --> 00:53:57,016
Hasn’t been an artist born

1238
00:53:57,016 --> 00:54:00,016
paint a pretty picture as that.

1239
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:11,015
( Rooster crowing )

1240
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:13,015
Listen.

1241
00:54:13,015 --> 00:54:14,015
I don’t hear
anything.

1242
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,015
Yeah, and that’s
the first day this week

1243
00:54:17,015 --> 00:54:19,015
that them fool machines
have been quiet.

1244
00:54:19,015 --> 00:54:21,015
I sure would
like to know

1245
00:54:21,015 --> 00:54:23,015
how you
got them to stop.

1246
00:54:23,015 --> 00:54:25,015
Well, Gloria asked me
to find a judge

1247
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:27,015
that would agree
that a sick woman

1248
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:29,015
shouldn’t be subjected
to bulldozers

1249
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,015
and chainsaws
and dynamite, so...

1250
00:54:31,015 --> 00:54:33,015
I did.

1251
00:54:33,015 --> 00:54:36,015
Well, you-you lawyers
are something.

1252
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:38,014
Look just like
regular people, too.

1253
00:54:38,014 --> 00:54:40,014
David, quit
stuffing your face

1254
00:54:40,014 --> 00:54:43,014
for one minute and
tell us what happened
at the meeting.

1255
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:45,014
How did it go?

1256
00:54:45,014 --> 00:54:46,014
I think Mr. Anders’
blood pressure

1257
00:54:46,014 --> 00:54:48,014
went up about
a hundred points.
Good.

1258
00:54:48,014 --> 00:54:51,014
That’s not all we’ll do
to that swindler.

1259
00:54:51,014 --> 00:54:53,014
What Anders did
was technically legal.

1260
00:54:53,014 --> 00:54:54,014
It may not have been

1261
00:54:54,014 --> 00:54:56,014
the most benevolent
thing in the world.

1262
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:58,014
Benevolent? He used
a 1978 tax appraisal

1263
00:54:58,014 --> 00:55:00,014
to value grace’s
property today.

1264
00:55:00,014 --> 00:55:01,014
Which is technically legal.

1265
00:55:01,014 --> 00:55:03,014
But it’s not right.

1266
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:04,013
Grace had to ask
for an updated assessment.

1267
00:55:04,013 --> 00:55:07,013
How was she
to even know
about that?

1268
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,013
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1269
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,013
You two always snap
at each other like this?

1270
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:14,013
Not always.

1271
00:55:14,013 --> 00:55:18,013
Anyway, I told Anders
we’d sue if necessary.

1272
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:20,013
Grace:
To sue?

1273
00:55:20,013 --> 00:55:21,013
Oh, now, just a minute.

1274
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:24,013
I didn’t want to die
in that nursing home

1275
00:55:24,013 --> 00:55:27,013
and I for sure don’t want
to die in no courtroom.

1276
00:55:27,013 --> 00:55:29,013
Nobody’s going
to court, grace.

1277
00:55:29,013 --> 00:55:30,013
Don’t worry.

1278
00:55:30,013 --> 00:55:32,012
He’ll come around
to a nice quiet settlement.

1279
00:55:32,012 --> 00:55:34,012
What’s that supposed
to mean?

1280
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:35,012
It means
the difference

1281
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:37,012
of what this land was worth

1282
00:55:37,012 --> 00:55:38,012
and what you sold it for.

1283
00:55:38,012 --> 00:55:40,012
With current land values,
we got to be talking...

1284
00:55:40,012 --> 00:55:42,012
$160,000... minimum.

1285
00:55:42,012 --> 00:55:45,012
$160,000?

1286
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,012
That’s the upside.

1287
00:55:51,012 --> 00:55:53,012
There is a downside.

1288
00:55:53,012 --> 00:55:55,012
This could take a while.

1289
00:55:55,012 --> 00:55:58,011
Grace, you’re going
to need a will.

1290
00:55:58,011 --> 00:56:01,011
And here is a standard
legal form.

1291
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:03,011
Okay, all
we have to do

1292
00:56:03,011 --> 00:56:04,011
is fill in a few
of these blanks.

1293
00:56:06,011 --> 00:56:08,011
What am I going to do
with all that money?

1294
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:09,011
Leave it to anyone
you want.

1295
00:56:09,011 --> 00:56:10,011
Roy?

1296
00:56:10,011 --> 00:56:12,011
Roy? He’d just get in trouble.

1297
00:56:12,011 --> 00:56:14,011
There’s luanne.

1298
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:16,011
Grace has a favorite niece
in Providence.

1299
00:56:16,011 --> 00:56:18,011
Let’s start a trust
to pay for her college.

1300
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:21,011
A trust.
David, that’s a great idea.

1301
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,011
Do you know what the Bible
says about money?

1302
00:56:23,011 --> 00:56:25,010
It’s the root of all evil.

1303
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,010
I don’t want that
on my conscience.

1304
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,010
Let’s just forget about this.

1305
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,010
Grace...

1306
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,010
No! No! No!

1307
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,010
No wills,
no lawsuits

1308
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,010
no nothing.

1309
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,010
I got to go.

1310
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,010
I have a client meeting.

1311
00:56:59,009 --> 00:57:01,009
I don’t like what’s
happening to me.

1312
00:57:01,009 --> 00:57:04,009
I’m so confused.

1313
00:57:04,009 --> 00:57:06,009
I’m sorry. We’re putting you
through too much.

1314
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:10,009
No, I’m an old lady
and I’m set in my ways.

1315
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,009
I know that.

1316
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:14,009
But I just can’t stand
surprises.

1317
00:57:14,009 --> 00:57:16,009
That’s why I got upset.

1318
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:19,008
But I surely didn’t mean
to hurt your feelings.

1319
00:57:19,008 --> 00:57:20,008
It’s fine.

1320
00:57:20,008 --> 00:57:22,008
Let’s just forget it.

1321
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:26,008
Here, I’ll help
you wash those.

1322
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:28,008
I’m fine.

1323
00:57:28,008 --> 00:57:30,008
Well, all right,
then you wash
and I’ll dry.

1324
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:32,008
Okay.

1325
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:35,008
Are you sure you won’t
eat something?

1326
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:37,008
Well, I was looking
out the window

1327
00:57:37,008 --> 00:57:39,008
at my orchard
up there.

1328
00:57:39,008 --> 00:57:40,008
And I was thinking

1329
00:57:40,008 --> 00:57:42,008
I would love
to have a bite

1330
00:57:42,008 --> 00:57:44,008
out of one
of them apples.

1331
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:45,008
You would?
Yeah.

1332
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:47,007
Well, then what
are we waiting for?

1333
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,007
Let’s go.

1334
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:49,007
Would you show me

1335
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,007
the big house, too?

1336
00:57:50,007 --> 00:57:52,007
Grace:
All right.

1337
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:56,007
I haven’t been there myself
since the hospital.

1338
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:58,007
Gloria:
Watch your step.

1339
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,007
There we go.

1340
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:01,007
Grace:
Okay, okay, fine.

1341
00:58:03,007 --> 00:58:04,007
Oh!

1342
00:58:08,007 --> 00:58:10,007
( Chuckles )

1343
00:58:10,007 --> 00:58:12,007
Well, I never did
like it much anyway.

1344
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:15,006
You should have
seen it before.

1345
00:58:15,006 --> 00:58:17,006
It always had
a lot of fishing gear

1346
00:58:17,006 --> 00:58:19,006
and guns.

1347
00:58:19,006 --> 00:58:21,006
You know, men’s stuff.

1348
00:58:21,006 --> 00:58:23,006
Nothing of mine.

1349
00:58:23,006 --> 00:58:27,006
The orchard, though,
that was different.

1350
00:58:27,006 --> 00:58:30,006
I used to go out there
every day.

1351
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,006
I’d take a blanket
in the afternoon

1352
00:58:33,006 --> 00:58:36,006
and I’d lie down on my back

1353
00:58:36,006 --> 00:58:38,006
when my work was done.

1354
00:58:38,006 --> 00:58:41,005
That’s where
I’d dream my dreams.

1355
00:58:43,005 --> 00:58:45,005
Oh, look there.

1356
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:47,005
That’s a gala.

1357
00:58:47,005 --> 00:58:49,005
That’s one of my favorites.

1358
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:54,005
That’s the first morsel
I’ve seen you eat in days.

1359
00:58:54,005 --> 00:58:56,005
Mm.

1360
00:58:56,005 --> 00:58:58,005
Hmm?

1361
00:58:58,005 --> 00:58:59,005
Don’t want any more.

1362
00:58:59,005 --> 00:59:01,005
You only had
one bite.

1363
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:04,005
I know. You finish it.

1364
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:06,005
Can you see the steeple

1365
00:59:06,005 --> 00:59:08,004
of your little church
from here?

1366
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:10,004
That is not my church.

1367
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:14,004
Gloria:
That’s right.
You mentioned that.

1368
00:59:14,004 --> 00:59:17,004
Could you tell me
about the reverend?

1369
00:59:17,004 --> 00:59:19,004
He was just a young man.

1370
00:59:19,004 --> 00:59:22,004
You know, young preacher.

1371
00:59:22,004 --> 00:59:24,004
John Patrick Conklin.

1372
00:59:24,004 --> 00:59:27,004
I was married, of course.

1373
00:59:27,004 --> 00:59:30,004
One day in Sunday school,
he asked me to stand up

1374
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:33,004
and read something
out of the Bible.

1375
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:34,003
Everybody laughed.

1376
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,003
They knew I couldn’t read.

1377
00:59:36,003 --> 00:59:40,003
But later, he said
I shouldn’t feel bad...

1378
00:59:40,003 --> 00:59:42,003
that he’d teach me how.

1379
00:59:42,003 --> 00:59:45,003
That poor thing.

1380
00:59:45,003 --> 00:59:46,003
I’d go down there

1381
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:49,003
on Sunday afternoons
with my book.

1382
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:51,003
I couldn’t concentrate.

1383
00:59:51,003 --> 00:59:54,003
I just liked
watching his eyes.

1384
00:59:54,003 --> 00:59:58,003
The way he’d get
his brows all worried

1385
00:59:58,003 --> 00:59:59,003
when I messed up.

1386
00:59:59,003 --> 01:00:04,002
And I liked listening
to him laugh, you know.

1387
01:00:04,002 --> 01:00:07,002
Then the people
from the church...

1388
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:09,002
my mother-in-law especially

1389
01:00:09,002 --> 01:00:11,002
started cackling like
a bunch of old hens.

1390
01:00:11,002 --> 01:00:13,002
My husband heard about it

1391
01:00:13,002 --> 01:00:16,002
and he stormed down there
and cussed him out.

1392
01:00:16,002 --> 01:00:19,002
Why?

1393
01:00:19,002 --> 01:00:20,002
Did anything happen?

1394
01:00:20,002 --> 01:00:23,002
Course nothing happened.

1395
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:25,002
I was so mad

1396
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:28,001
I just never
went back there.

1397
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:31,001
Took me a long time
to get over

1398
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:34,001
being angry with god.

1399
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:39,001
But then, through the years,
I came to realize

1400
01:00:39,001 --> 01:00:44,001
that Mr. Stiles really
did love me in his way.

1401
01:00:46,001 --> 01:00:49,001
He stood by me
through a heap of trouble.

1402
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:55,000
My husband...

1403
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
He stood by me
through a heap
of trouble, too.

1404
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
( Sighs )

1405
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
New York...

1406
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
that was my orchard.

1407
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Especially
the last few years.

1408
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I had just
gotten promoted.

1409
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I was the head of
an entire division.

1410
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I finally...

1411
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,999
Achieved, as
a woman, respect.

1412
01:01:25,999 --> 01:01:28,999
Even more than the power
or the money, you know?

1413
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:34,999
And then your
little boy died.

1414
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:36,999
What was his name?

1415
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:38,999
Billy?

1416
01:01:38,999 --> 01:01:40,999
Yeah.

1417
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:44,999
I’ll bet he was smart.

1418
01:01:48,998 --> 01:01:51,998
And talented.

1419
01:01:51,998 --> 01:01:54,998
He, uh... he liked
to draw pictures.

1420
01:01:54,998 --> 01:01:57,998
That’s all right, honey.

1421
01:01:57,998 --> 01:01:59,998
That’s all right.

1422
01:01:59,998 --> 01:02:02,998
Just let it all out.

1423
01:02:02,998 --> 01:02:05,998
You got to make room
inside yourself again

1424
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:06,998
for happiness.

1425
01:02:08,998 --> 01:02:13,998
Oh, grace...
I loved him so.

1426
01:02:13,998 --> 01:02:15,997
Of course
you did, honey.

1427
01:02:18,997 --> 01:02:19,997
Of course you did.

1428
01:02:21,997 --> 01:02:23,997
( Knocking )

1429
01:02:23,997 --> 01:02:25,997
Hi, Roy.

1430
01:02:25,997 --> 01:02:26,997
Glad to see you.

1431
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:29,997
Hey, grandma.

1432
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:30,997
Hello, Roy.

1433
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,997
Where you been?

1434
01:02:32,997 --> 01:02:34,997
Oh, you know, busy.

1435
01:02:40,997 --> 01:02:41,997
Well, I just
stopped by

1436
01:02:41,997 --> 01:02:43,996
’cause the mailman’s

1437
01:02:43,996 --> 01:02:46,996
been dropping your stuff
off at the gas station

1438
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,996
and, uh... you got
another letter

1439
01:02:49,996 --> 01:02:50,996
from luanne.

1440
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:52,996
Well, don’t just
stand there.

1441
01:02:52,996 --> 01:02:54,996
You sit down
and read it to me.

1442
01:02:58,996 --> 01:03:01,996
( Clearing throat )

1443
01:03:03,996 --> 01:03:05,996
Um, I’ll be outside.

1444
01:03:11,995 --> 01:03:12,995
"Dear auntie grace

1445
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:15,995
"I was real sad
when mom told me today

1446
01:03:15,995 --> 01:03:17,995
"that you are very sick.

1447
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,995
"So I thought maybe
I could cheer you up

1448
01:03:19,995 --> 01:03:23,995
"and myself, too,
by writing you a happy letter.

1449
01:03:23,995 --> 01:03:24,995
"Whenever I’m
feeling bad

1450
01:03:24,995 --> 01:03:26,995
"I play with
my dog Dooley.

1451
01:03:26,995 --> 01:03:27,995
"Dooley’s just a mutt

1452
01:03:27,995 --> 01:03:30,995
"but he’s always ready
to play or snuggle when I hurt.

1453
01:03:30,995 --> 01:03:32,995
"I wish people could be
more like Dooley.

1454
01:03:32,995 --> 01:03:35,995
That’s all I can think
of right now, auntie grace."

1455
01:03:42,994 --> 01:03:44,994
Roy...

1456
01:03:44,994 --> 01:03:47,994
Roy, I want
to thank you.

1457
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:52,994
Yeah, sure.

1458
01:03:54,994 --> 01:03:57,994
I can feel
this hostility

1459
01:03:57,994 --> 01:03:58,994
coming from you.

1460
01:03:58,994 --> 01:04:00,994
If you feel like I’m getting

1461
01:04:00,994 --> 01:04:01,994
between you and your grandmother

1462
01:04:01,994 --> 01:04:03,993
you can say so.

1463
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:04,993
It makes you feel
like you’re doing

1464
01:04:04,993 --> 01:04:06,993
something good
coming up here, doesn’t it?

1465
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:09,993
Probably think you care
about her more than me.

1466
01:04:09,993 --> 01:04:11,993
What? No.

1467
01:04:11,993 --> 01:04:14,993
I don’t feel that way at all.

1468
01:04:14,993 --> 01:04:16,993
You want to know why
I don’t come?

1469
01:04:18,993 --> 01:04:20,993
Because all I think about
when I’m up here

1470
01:04:20,993 --> 01:04:23,993
is my dad working like a mule

1471
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,993
every day of his life.

1472
01:04:25,993 --> 01:04:27,993
For what?

1473
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:30,992
Every year the farm would
just sink deeper into the hole.

1474
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,992
But dad, he would just
push himself harder and harder.

1475
01:04:36,992 --> 01:04:39,992
You love your grandmother,
don’t you, Roy?

1476
01:04:42,992 --> 01:04:43,992
What a question.

1477
01:04:43,992 --> 01:04:47,992
She showed me

1478
01:04:47,992 --> 01:04:49,992
how to toss a horseshoe...

1479
01:04:49,992 --> 01:04:50,992
Pitch a ball.

1480
01:04:50,992 --> 01:04:53,992
Dad was always

1481
01:04:53,992 --> 01:04:54,992
working the farm.

1482
01:04:57,991 --> 01:04:59,991
Grandma was, too...

1483
01:04:59,991 --> 01:05:03,991
But somehow she found the time.

1484
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:08,991
Well, you should...

1485
01:05:08,991 --> 01:05:11,991
You should come back, Roy.

1486
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,991
Show her that you appreciate
all she’s done.

1487
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:17,991
Bring Charlene.

1488
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:30,990
( Engine starting )

1489
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:41,990
Glorie?

1490
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,990
What are you doing here?

1491
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,990
I’m getting
into this.

1492
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:49,990
I’m getting
a lot done.

1493
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:51,989
What time is it?

1494
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:55,989
I don’t know. 2:30?

1495
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:56,989
In the morning?

1496
01:05:56,989 --> 01:05:58,989
Yeah.

1497
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:00,989
Why aren’t you home
with your husband

1498
01:06:00,989 --> 01:06:02,989
where you belong?

1499
01:06:02,989 --> 01:06:03,989
Oh, David’s probably
not home himself.

1500
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:04,989
It’s Friday night.

1501
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:06,989
He’s probably out with the boys.

1502
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:09,989
I still want you to go home.

1503
01:06:09,989 --> 01:06:11,989
And your husband...

1504
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:14,989
He’s not out with the boys
and you know it.

1505
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:17,989
I’ve seen him looking at you,
just aching for you.

1506
01:06:17,989 --> 01:06:19,988
Now, you just take
your things

1507
01:06:19,988 --> 01:06:21,988
and you go on home.

1508
01:06:21,988 --> 01:06:24,988
It’s not right, a young woman
messing with death like this.

1509
01:06:24,988 --> 01:06:25,988
I want to know about death.

1510
01:06:25,988 --> 01:06:27,988
You know about death.

1511
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:30,988
You just don’t accept it yet.

1512
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:31,988
Your boy died

1513
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,988
and it’s like the doctor said.

1514
01:06:33,988 --> 01:06:35,988
"These things happen"?

1515
01:06:35,988 --> 01:06:36,988
Yes.

1516
01:06:36,988 --> 01:06:38,988
Just happen?
No rhyme or reason?

1517
01:06:38,988 --> 01:06:40,988
How should I know
what the reason is?

1518
01:06:40,988 --> 01:06:42,988
You just take each day
as it’s given you.

1519
01:06:42,988 --> 01:06:43,988
You don’t question.

1520
01:06:43,988 --> 01:06:44,988
No questions?

1521
01:06:44,988 --> 01:06:45,987
No.

1522
01:06:45,987 --> 01:06:48,987
What shall I do then, huh?

1523
01:06:48,987 --> 01:06:51,987
Just keep busy
for the next 50 years?!

1524
01:06:51,987 --> 01:06:54,987
Something happens like this,
you start over.

1525
01:06:54,987 --> 01:06:55,987
Oh, yeah,
start over.

1526
01:06:55,987 --> 01:06:57,987
Move to a new town...

1527
01:06:57,987 --> 01:06:59,987
that was David’s answer.

1528
01:07:00,987 --> 01:07:02,987
Have another baby.

1529
01:07:02,987 --> 01:07:04,987
Look how many children
you buried.

1530
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:08,987
Are you telling me that
I can go through this again?

1531
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:11,987
Listen, child, you either
do a thing or you don’t.

1532
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:13,986
What other choices
do we have?

1533
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:16,986
Oh, I’ve got choices.

1534
01:07:16,986 --> 01:07:17,986
Like what?

1535
01:07:21,986 --> 01:07:23,986
Oh.

1536
01:07:28,986 --> 01:07:29,986
That’s what this is about.

1537
01:07:32,986 --> 01:07:35,986
You’re here trying on death
for size

1538
01:07:35,986 --> 01:07:38,986
before you go out
and kill yourself.

1539
01:07:38,986 --> 01:07:41,985
That’s it, isn’t it?

1540
01:07:41,985 --> 01:07:43,985
Isn’t it?

1541
01:07:43,985 --> 01:07:47,985
It shouldn’t have happened!

1542
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:50,985
He was a perfect,
innocent boy

1543
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:53,985
with his whole life
in front of him!

1544
01:07:53,985 --> 01:07:55,985
I mean, grace, you are the one
with the faith here

1545
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:57,985
so you tell me...

1546
01:07:57,985 --> 01:08:00,985
what heavenly purpose
was served

1547
01:08:00,985 --> 01:08:02,985
by crushing his beautiful body

1548
01:08:02,985 --> 01:08:05,985
and leaving it
on my lap to die?!

1549
01:08:05,985 --> 01:08:07,984
I just want an answer,
you know?

1550
01:08:07,984 --> 01:08:09,984
Just one lousy reason!

1551
01:08:20,984 --> 01:08:22,984
Glorie.

1552
01:08:22,984 --> 01:08:25,984
Glorie, would you do me a favor?

1553
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:30,984
Would you let me go first?

1554
01:08:50,983 --> 01:08:52,983
Well, I wasn’t sure
I’d ever see you back.

1555
01:08:52,983 --> 01:08:54,983
Grace, about last night.

1556
01:08:54,983 --> 01:08:56,983
I’m sorry, I...

1557
01:08:56,983 --> 01:08:59,983
I get freaky
when I get too tired

1558
01:08:59,983 --> 01:09:01,982
and I, I shouldn’t have

1559
01:09:01,982 --> 01:09:02,982
and I apologize.

1560
01:09:04,982 --> 01:09:06,982
I brought us something.

1561
01:09:15,982 --> 01:09:16,982
If you’re feeling up to it,

1562
01:09:16,982 --> 01:09:19,982
I thought maybe we could...

1563
01:09:19,982 --> 01:09:22,982
Where’s a good place we can go
to just laze out?

1564
01:09:22,982 --> 01:09:23,982
"Laze out"?

1565
01:09:23,982 --> 01:09:27,981
Heh. I don’t think
I ever done that before.

1566
01:09:27,981 --> 01:09:28,981
What’d you go
buy food for?

1567
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:31,981
If there’s one thing I’ve
got plenty of, it’s food.

1568
01:09:31,981 --> 01:09:33,981
Well, I know
it’s a stretch,

1569
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:35,981
but I thought
something exotic

1570
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:36,981
might tempt you to eat,

1571
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:39,981
so everything I brought
today is imported.

1572
01:09:40,981 --> 01:09:43,981
All right.

1573
01:09:43,981 --> 01:09:44,981
Now, I want you

1574
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:45,981
to try this.

1575
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:46,981
What is it?

1576
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:47,981
It’s prosciutto

1577
01:09:47,981 --> 01:09:50,981
on a sliver
of raisin pumpernickel.

1578
01:09:50,981 --> 01:09:52,981
Pro what?

1579
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:54,980
Prosciutto.
It’s a kind of ham.

1580
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,980
What kind of ham?

1581
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:57,980
It’s Italian.

1582
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,980
You bought eye-talian ham?

1583
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,980
Well, it’s meat.

1584
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:02,980
Try it.

1585
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,980
Meat? Why didn’t
you tell me?

1586
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:05,980
We could have gone

1587
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,980
and killed us one
of them chickens.

1588
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,980
Grace, please.

1589
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,980
You don’t eat chicken?

1590
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:14,980
Well, not ones
I’ve made eye contact with.

1591
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,980
Um...

1592
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,980
Here, you’re going
to like this.

1593
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:20,980
It’s cheese.

1594
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,979
I got a three-pound
carton of cheese

1595
01:10:22,979 --> 01:10:23,979
in my frigerator.

1596
01:10:23,979 --> 01:10:25,979
Not like this.

1597
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:27,979
This is special.

1598
01:10:27,979 --> 01:10:30,979
It’s called brie.

1599
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:32,979
Smell it.

1600
01:10:35,979 --> 01:10:36,979
Isn’t that heaven?

1601
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:38,979
Phew.

1602
01:10:38,979 --> 01:10:39,979
I sure hope not.

1603
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:47,979
Okay.

1604
01:10:47,979 --> 01:10:49,978
( Humming )

1605
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:51,978
What’s that?

1606
01:10:51,978 --> 01:10:52,978
I’m not telling.

1607
01:10:52,978 --> 01:10:55,978
I’m just going to eat it.

1608
01:10:55,978 --> 01:10:56,978
( Humming )

1609
01:10:56,978 --> 01:10:59,978
Mmm. Mmm!

1610
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:01,978
This is delicious.

1611
01:11:01,978 --> 01:11:03,978
It’s lobster salad.

1612
01:11:03,978 --> 01:11:06,978
Oh, I seen pictures
of lobsters.

1613
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:07,978
Mm-hmm.

1614
01:11:07,978 --> 01:11:08,978
With all them legs

1615
01:11:08,978 --> 01:11:09,978
and them beady little eyes.

1616
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:10,978
Don’t, grace.

1617
01:11:10,978 --> 01:11:11,978
They look just like
please...

1618
01:11:11,978 --> 01:11:14,978
Great big bugs.

1619
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:18,977
( Suppressed laugh )

1620
01:11:23,977 --> 01:11:25,977
Okay.

1621
01:11:28,977 --> 01:11:31,977
So, we done lazing out?

1622
01:11:31,977 --> 01:11:33,977
Mm-hmm.

1623
01:11:33,977 --> 01:11:34,977
There it is.

1624
01:11:34,977 --> 01:11:36,977
Got it all done.

1625
01:11:36,977 --> 01:11:37,977
Grace, it is
breathtaking.

1626
01:11:37,977 --> 01:11:41,977
I sure wish I
could show luanne
how I did it.

1627
01:11:41,977 --> 01:11:42,976
Well, you can.

1628
01:11:42,976 --> 01:11:43,976
Look.

1629
01:11:45,976 --> 01:11:47,976
I brought this
with me today

1630
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:48,976
and I’ve been
meaning to ask you

1631
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:50,976
I want to videotape you.

1632
01:11:50,976 --> 01:11:51,976
For luanne.

1633
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:52,976
This is perfect.

1634
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:54,976
While she’s trying on
the sweater

1635
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:56,976
you could be there
explaining about the orchard.

1636
01:11:56,976 --> 01:11:58,976
I don’t think so, no.
Why not?

1637
01:11:58,976 --> 01:12:00,976
She’ll Cherish it
the rest of her life.

1638
01:12:00,976 --> 01:12:02,976
She’ll finally get to see
this amazing aunt

1639
01:12:02,976 --> 01:12:03,976
she’s written
all these letters to.

1640
01:12:03,976 --> 01:12:05,976
Yeah. You want luanne to see me?

1641
01:12:05,976 --> 01:12:06,976
The way I look?

1642
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:09,975
Grace, you are beautiful.

1643
01:12:09,975 --> 01:12:10,975
Beautiful?

1644
01:12:10,975 --> 01:12:12,975
I look like something that y-you

1645
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:14,975
find out on the highway.

1646
01:12:14,975 --> 01:12:16,975
What’s that Roy calls it?

1647
01:12:16,975 --> 01:12:17,975
Roadkill.

1648
01:12:17,975 --> 01:12:20,975
We’ll make you feel pretty.

1649
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:21,975
We’ll doll you up.

1650
01:12:21,975 --> 01:12:23,975
Put on a little makeup
and make your hair look nice.

1651
01:12:23,975 --> 01:12:25,975
You want luanne
to see a painted woman?

1652
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,975
Makeup is about accenting
and highlighting

1653
01:12:27,975 --> 01:12:29,975
the beauty
that is already there.

1654
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:36,974
You wearing makeup now?

1655
01:12:36,974 --> 01:12:37,974
See, you can’t even tell.

1656
01:12:37,974 --> 01:12:39,974
Well...

1657
01:12:39,974 --> 01:12:43,974
I mean, if by some miracle
you could make me look...

1658
01:12:43,974 --> 01:12:45,974
Just halfway presentable.

1659
01:12:45,974 --> 01:12:47,974
What’d I say then?

1660
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:49,974
Well, you’d start out
by wishing her a happy birthday.

1661
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:51,974
Well, I can do that with a card.

1662
01:12:53,974 --> 01:12:54,974
( Men shouting )

1663
01:12:54,974 --> 01:12:56,974
Oh, they’re starting
them machines again.

1664
01:12:56,974 --> 01:12:58,974
But they can’t.
There’s a court order.

1665
01:12:58,974 --> 01:12:59,974
They’re doing
it, though.

1666
01:12:59,974 --> 01:13:01,974
Yeah, they’re moving.

1667
01:13:01,974 --> 01:13:03,973
They’re moving right out.
They...

1668
01:13:08,973 --> 01:13:09,973
Where they going?

1669
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:14,973
No!

1670
01:13:17,973 --> 01:13:19,973
No!

1671
01:13:19,973 --> 01:13:20,973
The orchard?

1672
01:13:20,973 --> 01:13:22,973
Grace.

1673
01:13:22,973 --> 01:13:23,973
No! Stop!

1674
01:13:23,973 --> 01:13:25,973
Grace, please.

1675
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:26,973
Stop!

1676
01:13:26,973 --> 01:13:27,973
Let’s go back inside.

1677
01:13:27,973 --> 01:13:28,973
This won’t help.

1678
01:13:28,973 --> 01:13:30,972
No!

1679
01:13:30,972 --> 01:13:33,972
No! Please, stop! Please.

1680
01:13:33,972 --> 01:13:35,972
Please.

1681
01:13:35,972 --> 01:13:39,972
Don’t do this.

1682
01:13:39,972 --> 01:13:40,972
No!

1683
01:13:41,972 --> 01:13:42,972
No!

1684
01:13:42,972 --> 01:13:45,972
Grace, let’s go back in.

1685
01:13:45,972 --> 01:13:46,972
Come on.

1686
01:13:47,972 --> 01:13:50,972
Grace.

1687
01:13:50,972 --> 01:13:51,972
Grace.

1688
01:13:51,972 --> 01:13:53,972
They’re killing my trees.

1689
01:13:58,971 --> 01:14:00,971
Stop.

1690
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:02,971
I wish I could.

1691
01:14:06,971 --> 01:14:08,971
Oh, grace.

1692
01:14:19,971 --> 01:14:21,971
I rinsed everything out.

1693
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:22,971
I don’t think
the stains will set.

1694
01:14:22,971 --> 01:14:25,970
( Wheezing )

1695
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,970
I’m calling Dr. Peters.

1696
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:32,970
Don’t do anything.

1697
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:33,970
Grace.

1698
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,970
You were throwing up blood.

1699
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:39,970
Honey, you didn’t come here

1700
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:40,970
to help me pull through this.

1701
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,970
You came to help me die.

1702
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:52,969
You think I’m a fool, don’t you?

1703
01:14:52,969 --> 01:14:55,969
Carrying on
about a bunch of trees.

1704
01:14:55,969 --> 01:14:56,969
No, of course not.

1705
01:14:56,969 --> 01:14:57,969
I-I understand they had

1706
01:14:57,969 --> 01:15:00,969
sentimental value.

1707
01:15:00,969 --> 01:15:04,969
They’re just old,
majestic trees.

1708
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:09,969
That developer,
he was sending us a message.

1709
01:15:09,969 --> 01:15:10,969
You know it.

1710
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:12,969
I just hope
you don’t let him

1711
01:15:12,969 --> 01:15:14,969
get away with this.

1712
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:17,968
Now we’re back
to lawsuits again.

1713
01:15:17,968 --> 01:15:21,968
You deserved a fair price
for this farm.

1714
01:15:21,968 --> 01:15:25,968
It’s not just
the money, grace.

1715
01:15:25,968 --> 01:15:28,968
It’s what the money
can buy you.

1716
01:15:28,968 --> 01:15:30,968
You’ve got a chance here

1717
01:15:30,968 --> 01:15:33,968
to give luanne
what you never had.

1718
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:35,968
Opportunities.

1719
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:37,968
Education.

1720
01:15:37,968 --> 01:15:40,968
Freedom, grace.

1721
01:15:40,968 --> 01:15:44,967
Freedom to grow
and blossom as she pleases.

1722
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:47,967
All you have to do
is sign the will.

1723
01:15:47,967 --> 01:15:49,967
Stop helping me, honey.

1724
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:52,967
I really don’t
feel very good.

1725
01:15:52,967 --> 01:15:53,967
Okay.

1726
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:59,967
( Coughing )

1727
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:03,967
Glorie?

1728
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,967
Glorie!

1729
01:16:06,967 --> 01:16:08,967
Oh.

1730
01:16:08,967 --> 01:16:11,966
Oh! Okay, let’s do it.

1731
01:16:13,966 --> 01:16:14,966
You paint me.

1732
01:16:16,966 --> 01:16:18,966
Where do you
want me to go?

1733
01:16:18,966 --> 01:16:20,966
Over there
by that table, or...?

1734
01:16:20,966 --> 01:16:23,966
Maybe... maybe’d be better
by the windows.

1735
01:16:23,966 --> 01:16:24,966
There’s more light.

1736
01:16:24,966 --> 01:16:26,966
What are you
talking about?

1737
01:16:26,966 --> 01:16:29,966
Well, y-you, you said you
was going to doll me up

1738
01:16:29,966 --> 01:16:31,966
so I could talk to luanne.

1739
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:32,966
Okay.

1740
01:16:32,966 --> 01:16:33,966
All right.

1741
01:16:33,966 --> 01:16:34,966
What’s the matter
with you?

1742
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:36,966
Nothing.

1743
01:16:36,966 --> 01:16:38,965
Grace, you’ve been asleep
for the last 18 hours.

1744
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:44,965
Really?

1745
01:16:47,965 --> 01:16:48,965
What you doing now?

1746
01:16:48,965 --> 01:16:52,965
I’m softening
your cheekbones.

1747
01:16:52,965 --> 01:16:55,965
See if you
can fix my nose.

1748
01:17:01,965 --> 01:17:04,965
Okay, look over my
shoulder. Right here

1749
01:17:04,965 --> 01:17:06,964
and don’t blink.

1750
01:17:06,964 --> 01:17:08,964
How am I supposed
to do that?

1751
01:17:08,964 --> 01:17:11,964
Well, concentrate.
Concentrate.

1752
01:17:11,964 --> 01:17:12,964
I’m concentrating.

1753
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:15,964
Okay.

1754
01:17:26,964 --> 01:17:28,964
There.

1755
01:17:28,964 --> 01:17:31,964
All right. What shall
we do with your hair?

1756
01:17:31,964 --> 01:17:34,963
Well...

1757
01:17:34,963 --> 01:17:37,963
I guess we could throw
one of them quilts over it.

1758
01:17:39,963 --> 01:17:41,963
What’s that?

1759
01:17:41,963 --> 01:17:44,963
Thought we’d do
something different.

1760
01:17:44,963 --> 01:17:48,963
Looks like... like egg whites
all whipped up.

1761
01:17:48,963 --> 01:17:50,963
I think that’s
what this is.

1762
01:17:53,963 --> 01:17:55,963
Well, that’s different,
all right.

1763
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:56,963
I could live to be a hundred

1764
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:58,963
and never think
of wearing a meringue.

1765
01:17:58,963 --> 01:18:00,962
No peeking.

1766
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:04,962
All right.

1767
01:18:07,962 --> 01:18:09,962
Okay.

1768
01:18:09,962 --> 01:18:10,962
You can open
your eyes.

1769
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:17,962
Well, that preacher was right.

1770
01:18:17,962 --> 01:18:19,962
I was good-looking.

1771
01:18:22,962 --> 01:18:23,962
You still are, grace.

1772
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:25,962
You ready to talk
to luanne now?

1773
01:18:25,962 --> 01:18:29,961
What? I’m just looking
in the mirror here.

1774
01:18:32,961 --> 01:18:34,961
( Groans )

1775
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:35,961
Oh, grace.

1776
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,961
You want to lay
down, huh?

1777
01:18:37,961 --> 01:18:39,961
No, it-it’ll go away
in just a minute.

1778
01:18:39,961 --> 01:18:42,961
You sure you want
to do this today?

1779
01:18:42,961 --> 01:18:43,961
We don’t have to.

1780
01:18:43,961 --> 01:18:45,961
Yeah. I’m fine now.

1781
01:18:48,961 --> 01:18:50,961
Yeah, if you...

1782
01:18:50,961 --> 01:18:55,960
If you think I’m going through
the mascara and meringue again

1783
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,960
you’ve got another think coming.

1784
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,960
All right, I got you.

1785
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:02,960
Come on.

1786
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,960
Okay, all you have to do
is relax...

1787
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,960
Think about what
you want to say.

1788
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,960
Look at the camera.

1789
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,960
Pretend the camera’s luanne.

1790
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,960
I can’t pretend
a machine’s a person.

1791
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:15,960
Okay, uh...

1792
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,960
Pretend I’m luanne.

1793
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:19,960
All right.

1794
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:20,959
Okay.

1795
01:19:20,959 --> 01:19:22,959
Relax.

1796
01:19:24,959 --> 01:19:25,959
Hello, luanne.

1797
01:19:25,959 --> 01:19:29,959
This is your great-aunt...

1798
01:19:29,959 --> 01:19:31,959
Just regular.

1799
01:19:32,959 --> 01:19:33,959
I can’t do this.

1800
01:19:33,959 --> 01:19:37,959
I just can’t think
of anything to say.

1801
01:19:37,959 --> 01:19:39,959
I’m sorry. I just...

1802
01:19:39,959 --> 01:19:41,959
Let’s wish her a happy birthday

1803
01:19:41,959 --> 01:19:44,959
and, uh... let’s
show her the sweater.

1804
01:19:44,959 --> 01:19:45,959
She can see this, too?

1805
01:19:45,959 --> 01:19:48,958
Sure.

1806
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:49,958
All right.

1807
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:52,958
Okay. I’m going to start over.

1808
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:53,958
Just relax.

1809
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,958
That’s it.

1810
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:57,958
Hello, luanne.

1811
01:19:57,958 --> 01:19:59,958
This is your great-aunt grace

1812
01:19:59,958 --> 01:20:03,958
and I-I just wanted to wish you
a happy birthday

1813
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,958
and I wanted to tell you, too

1814
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,958
how much those letters
that you wrote me

1815
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:09,958
you know, meant to me.

1816
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:13,958
And the pictures...
I really did love the pictures.

1817
01:20:15,957 --> 01:20:18,957
I’m just glad
you’re thinking of me.

1818
01:20:18,957 --> 01:20:20,957
I’ve been thinking
of you, too

1819
01:20:20,957 --> 01:20:22,957
especially when I
was knitting this.

1820
01:20:22,957 --> 01:20:24,957
Can you see that?

1821
01:20:24,957 --> 01:20:27,957
That’s the orchard
that used to be here.

1822
01:20:27,957 --> 01:20:29,957
I thought you might like
to see a picture of it.

1823
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:34,957
I sure would
like to see you.

1824
01:20:34,957 --> 01:20:38,957
I’d just... give you a hug.

1825
01:20:38,957 --> 01:20:40,957
I hope you’re not
too big for hugs.

1826
01:20:42,956 --> 01:20:44,956
Roy stiles.

1827
01:20:44,956 --> 01:20:47,956
Where have you been?

1828
01:20:47,956 --> 01:20:48,956
Oh, my...

1829
01:20:48,956 --> 01:20:50,956
Is this who I think it is?

1830
01:20:50,956 --> 01:20:51,956
Luanne?

1831
01:20:51,956 --> 01:20:53,956
I bet this
is Dooley.

1832
01:20:53,956 --> 01:20:55,956
Hi.

1833
01:20:55,956 --> 01:20:57,956
Wow. Where did she come from?

1834
01:20:57,956 --> 01:21:00,956
I drove down to Providence
and got her.

1835
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,956
Come on.

1836
01:21:03,956 --> 01:21:07,956
I-I know I should be
giving you some advice

1837
01:21:07,956 --> 01:21:11,955
because that’s what-what people
expect old people to do

1838
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:13,955
is to offer some advice

1839
01:21:13,955 --> 01:21:16,955
but, honestly, you
young women today

1840
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,955
are-are so bright
an-and independent

1841
01:21:18,955 --> 01:21:21,955
I just, I just don’t
know what to tell you.

1842
01:21:21,955 --> 01:21:24,955
I don’t even know
what I know.

1843
01:21:24,955 --> 01:21:26,955
( Laughing )

1844
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:34,955
Merciful heaven.

1845
01:21:36,954 --> 01:21:40,954
Are my eyes
playing tricks on me?

1846
01:21:40,954 --> 01:21:42,954
Hello, aunt grace.

1847
01:21:45,954 --> 01:21:48,954
What’s going on here?

1848
01:21:48,954 --> 01:21:50,954
Why, this is a miracle.

1849
01:21:50,954 --> 01:21:52,954
This is a positive miracle.

1850
01:21:52,954 --> 01:21:54,954
Well, Roy is
the miracle worker.

1851
01:21:54,954 --> 01:21:56,954
He went all the way
to Providence to get her.

1852
01:21:57,954 --> 01:21:58,954
Oh, Roy.

1853
01:21:58,954 --> 01:22:00,954
You are something else.

1854
01:22:01,954 --> 01:22:04,953
Let’s take a look
at you, honey.

1855
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:06,953
Oh, you are so big.

1856
01:22:06,953 --> 01:22:08,953
Beautiful and so...

1857
01:22:09,953 --> 01:22:13,953
Good gravy, I forgot I
had on these red lips.

1858
01:22:13,953 --> 01:22:15,953
I don’t usually wear all this
stuff all over my face.

1859
01:22:15,953 --> 01:22:17,953
You-you you tell her, glorie.

1860
01:22:17,953 --> 01:22:19,953
Don’t believe a word she says.

1861
01:22:19,953 --> 01:22:20,953
She’s the local Cleopatra.

1862
01:22:20,953 --> 01:22:21,953
Oh.

1863
01:22:21,953 --> 01:22:22,953
Oh.

1864
01:22:22,953 --> 01:22:23,953
Gosh, honey...

1865
01:22:23,953 --> 01:22:25,953
I’m just so happy
to see you.

1866
01:22:25,953 --> 01:22:26,953
That I just...

1867
01:22:26,953 --> 01:22:28,953
I don’t even know
how to express it.

1868
01:22:29,952 --> 01:22:31,952
Roy.

1869
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,952
Thank you, honey.

1870
01:22:39,952 --> 01:22:41,952
Thank you.

1871
01:22:41,952 --> 01:22:44,952
Here I am,
just crying like a fool.

1872
01:22:44,952 --> 01:22:46,952
Thank you
for giving me luanne

1873
01:22:46,952 --> 01:22:49,952
and, luanne, I have
something for you.

1874
01:22:49,952 --> 01:22:52,952
I made this and...

1875
01:22:52,952 --> 01:22:53,952
And this is my orchard

1876
01:22:53,952 --> 01:22:56,951
you know,
before they knocked it down.

1877
01:22:56,951 --> 01:22:58,951
I wish you
could have seen it

1878
01:22:58,951 --> 01:23:00,951
but, anyway, here it is.

1879
01:23:00,951 --> 01:23:01,951
That’s for you.

1880
01:23:01,951 --> 01:23:03,951
Thank you.

1881
01:23:03,951 --> 01:23:05,951
You know, Roy,
glorie said

1882
01:23:05,951 --> 01:23:08,951
that she didn’t think
that-that the developer

1883
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:12,951
had paid us
a rightful price for our farm.

1884
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:15,951
So, she’s going to get
some more money from him.

1885
01:23:15,951 --> 01:23:17,951
Gloria:
Have you given any thought

1886
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:20,951
to how you’d like
the money used, grace?

1887
01:23:20,951 --> 01:23:22,951
Yes, I have.

1888
01:23:22,951 --> 01:23:26,950
I’ve thought about it
and I’ve prayed about it

1889
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:29,950
and, Roy, you should
have half

1890
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:33,950
and, luanne, you have
the other half.

1891
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,950
Oh, thank you,
aunt grace.

1892
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:38,950
You’re welcome,
honey.

1893
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,950
It’s for your
college education.

1894
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:42,950
It’s so you can-can... oh.

1895
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:43,950
How did you say that?

1896
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:45,950
Grow and blossom.

1897
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:49,950
Yeah, grow and blossom
as you wish.

1898
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:50,949
( Dog barks )

1899
01:23:50,949 --> 01:23:52,949
Oh, merciful heavens.

1900
01:23:52,949 --> 01:23:54,949
Is that who I think it is?

1901
01:23:54,949 --> 01:23:55,949
Come on in.

1902
01:23:55,949 --> 01:23:57,949
Come on, Dooley.

1903
01:23:57,949 --> 01:23:58,949
Oh, yeah.

1904
01:24:00,949 --> 01:24:02,949
Well, Mr. Attorney?

1905
01:24:02,949 --> 01:24:06,949
Is that as legal
as a written will?

1906
01:24:06,949 --> 01:24:08,949
That should hold up
in any court in the land.

1907
01:24:10,949 --> 01:24:12,949
( Knocking )

1908
01:24:12,949 --> 01:24:14,949
Hi.
Hi.

1909
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:17,948
You started the
slumber party
without me?

1910
01:24:17,948 --> 01:24:20,948
Look, aunt grace
hand-embroidered
this nightshirt.

1911
01:24:20,948 --> 01:24:22,948
Isn’t it so pretty?

1912
01:24:22,948 --> 01:24:23,948
You did?

1913
01:24:23,948 --> 01:24:25,948
Where do you get
the time?

1914
01:24:25,948 --> 01:24:27,948
Music.
( Country music playing )

1915
01:24:27,948 --> 01:24:29,948
I did a nightshirt
for you, too.

1916
01:24:29,948 --> 01:24:30,948
It’s right there.

1917
01:24:30,948 --> 01:24:32,948
For me?

1918
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:34,948

Okay.

1923
01:24:49,947 --> 01:24:52,947
This... belonged
to your son?

1924
01:24:52,947 --> 01:24:53,947
Mm-hmm.

1925
01:24:53,947 --> 01:24:55,947
Hold it up to

Wow...

01:24:59,947 --> 01:25:03,947
It’s... beautiful.

1929

Yes.

1930
01:25:05,947 --> 01:25:07,947
Billy would gaze into that
for the longest time

1931
01:25:07,947 --> 01:25:09,947
and then he’d draw
what he saw with
his colored pencils.

1932
01:25:13,946 --> 01:25:14,946
Night.

1933
01:25:14,946 --> 01:25:15,946
Good night,
sweetheart.

1934
01:25:15,946 --> 01:25:16,946
I love you.

1935
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:17,946

( Yawning )

1937
01:25:23,946 --> 01:25:25,946
Time for you
to go to sleep, too.

1938
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:27,946
Glorie, would you
feel my legs?

1939
01:25:30,946 --> 01:25:31,946
Do they feel
cold to you?

1940
01:25:31,946 --> 01:25:33,946
No.

So, you don’t...

You don’t think
I’m dying just yet?

1943
01:25:37,946 --> 01:25:39,945
No, you’re not dying
just yet.

1944
01:25:42,945 --> 01:25:44,945
You think if I go to sleep
I’ll wake up?

1945
01:25:47,945 --> 01:25:48,945
You’d better.

1946
01:25:48,945 --> 01:25:51,945
Otherwise, I’m going
to have to clean up

1947
01:25:51,945 --> 01:25:53,945
this mess we made
all by myself.

1948
01:25:53,945 --> 01:25:54,945
( Both chuckle )

1949
01:25:55,945 --> 01:25:56,945
Good night, honey.

1950
01:26:05,944 --> 01:26:07,944
Oh, you’re not
going to sleep

1951
01:26:07,944 --> 01:26:10,944
in that uncomfortable
old chair again tonight.

1952

01:26:11,944 --> 01:26:13,944
You-you come on over.

1954
01:26:13,944 --> 01:26:14,944
Come get in with me.

1955
01:26:18,944 --> 01:26:20,944
I can’t sleep
in your bed, grace.

1956
01:26:20,944 --> 01:26:22,944
Well, it’s a
slumber party.

1957
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:24,944
That’s what girls do.

1958
01:26:24,944 --> 01:26:25,944
Come on.

01:26:42,943 --> 01:26:43,943
This is nice.

1963
01:26:46,943 --> 01:26:48,943
The way you gave
luanne that toy

1964
01:26:48,943 --> 01:26:51,943
that belonged to
your little boy

1965
01:26:51,943 --> 01:26:52,943
that was nice, too.

1966
01:26:55,943 --> 01:26:57,943
I’ve saved a lot
of billy’s things.

1967
01:26:57,943 --> 01:27:00,942
It’s a shame for them
to go to waste.

1968
01:27:02,942 --> 01:27:04,942
You know what I think?

1969
01:27:08,942 --> 01:27:11,942
I think that
you’re ready to...

1970
01:27:11,942 --> 01:27:12,942
Talk about it...

1971
01:27:15,942 --> 01:27:18,942
About what happened
to your little boy.

1972
01:27:24,942 --> 01:27:25,942
It was...

1973
01:27:25,942 --> 01:27:28,941
Billy’s first day
at the new school...

1974
01:27:30,941 --> 01:27:31,941
And it was raining.

1975
01:27:34,941 --> 01:27:37,941
So, I decided to drive over
and pick him up.

1976
01:27:37,941 --> 01:27:40,941
We were headed back across town.

1977
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:44,941
I don’t know
where it came from...

1978
01:27:44,941 --> 01:27:46,941
This truck.

1979
01:27:46,941 --> 01:27:47,941
( Sighs )

1980
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:51,941
When it hit us

1981
01:27:51,941 --> 01:27:57,940
it crumpled billy’s side
of the car like a paper bag.

1982
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,940
( Sighing moan )

1983
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:05,940
We were pinned inside the wreck
for more than an hour...

1984
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:09,940
Just squeezed
into this tiny sliver of space.

1985
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:11,940
Billy was on my lap...

1986
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:17,940
And as I held him

1987
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:22,939
I could feel his life
just slipping away...

1988
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:28,939
And there was nothing
I could do...

1989
01:28:28,939 --> 01:28:29,939
But scream.

1990
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:35,939
So, we buried him...

1991
01:28:35,939 --> 01:28:39,939
This gentle, sweet boy.

1992
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:41,939
( Sobbing sigh )

1993
01:28:45,939 --> 01:28:46,939
After that...

1994
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:50,938
I don’t know,
I just shut down, you know?

1995
01:28:50,938 --> 01:28:52,938
I wouldn’t go to work.

1996
01:28:52,938 --> 01:28:54,938
I wouldn’t go outside.

1997
01:28:55,938 --> 01:28:56,938
What for?

1998
01:28:56,938 --> 01:28:57,938
There was no point.

1999
01:29:00,938 --> 01:29:01,938
David, he...

2000
01:29:01,938 --> 01:29:04,938
He dragged me
from one doctor to the next.

2001
01:29:04,938 --> 01:29:09,938
We ended up with a shrink
who suggested a change

2002
01:29:09,938 --> 01:29:11,938
somewhere far from the city.

2003
01:29:14,937 --> 01:29:17,937
David’s done just about
everything he can for me.

2004
01:29:20,937 --> 01:29:24,937
I don’t know.
I’m so lost.

2005
01:29:24,937 --> 01:29:27,937
I don’t know what I feel...

2006
01:29:27,937 --> 01:29:28,937
Even about him.

2007
01:29:31,937 --> 01:29:32,937
( Sighs )

2008
01:29:36,937 --> 01:29:38,937
It’s a terrible thing
to lose a child, honey...

2009
01:29:41,936 --> 01:29:45,936
But don’t lose a man
who loves you, too.

2010
01:29:54,936 --> 01:29:56,936
Luanne:
Hey, aunt grace?

2011
01:29:56,936 --> 01:29:57,936
Grace:
Hmm?

2012
01:29:57,936 --> 01:29:59,936
Think I’ll ever
be able

2013
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,936
to make a sweater
as beautiful as this one?

2014
01:30:01,936 --> 01:30:02,936
Oh, yes.

2015
01:30:02,936 --> 01:30:04,936
You’ll just, you know,
make your own style.

2016
01:30:04,936 --> 01:30:07,936
I’ll bet you put Dooley
in one of them.

2017
01:30:09,935 --> 01:30:10,935
Good gravy.

2018
01:30:10,935 --> 01:30:12,935
Well, good morning.

2019
01:30:12,935 --> 01:30:15,935
I don’t think
I ever slept so hard.

2020
01:30:15,935 --> 01:30:17,935
Look, aunt grace is
teaching me to knit.

2021
01:30:17,935 --> 01:30:18,935
Hmm?

2022
01:30:18,935 --> 01:30:20,935
Well, she is the best.

2023
01:30:20,935 --> 01:30:21,935
Yeah.

2024
01:30:21,935 --> 01:30:24,935
( Chickens clucking )

2025
01:30:27,935 --> 01:30:31,935
Such a shame
to dig up this place.

2026
01:30:31,935 --> 01:30:33,935
Such a pretty farm.

2027
01:30:35,934 --> 01:30:36,934
Yes.

2028
01:30:36,934 --> 01:30:39,934
It’s been my
whole world...

2029
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:42,934
From the animals
to the...

2030
01:30:42,934 --> 01:30:44,934
Trees, flowers...

2031
01:30:44,934 --> 01:30:47,934
Right down to the bugs.

2032
01:30:47,934 --> 01:30:48,934
( Chuckles )

2033
01:30:50,934 --> 01:30:51,934
You know what, sweetie?

2034
01:30:51,934 --> 01:30:53,934
I’ve been...
I’ve been trying

2035
01:30:53,934 --> 01:30:56,934
to think of something
that I might tell you

2036
01:30:56,934 --> 01:30:59,934
and I think maybe...

2037
01:30:59,934 --> 01:31:01,934
Maybe it’s...

2038
01:31:01,934 --> 01:31:03,933
Look-look out
at the world out there.

2039
01:31:03,933 --> 01:31:05,933
Just look how...

2040
01:31:05,933 --> 01:31:08,933
Everything’s connected
to everything else.

2041
01:31:08,933 --> 01:31:10,933
Like our sweater here.

2042
01:31:10,933 --> 01:31:13,933
Like the stitches
in the sweater.

2043
01:31:13,933 --> 01:31:14,933
Now... you don’t just...

2044
01:31:14,933 --> 01:31:16,933
One or two stitches,
they don’t...

2045
01:31:16,933 --> 01:31:19,933
They don’t mean much

2046
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:22,933
but... if you...
Cut or break

2047
01:31:22,933 --> 01:31:26,933
even one of the stitches,
the whole sweater falls apart.

2048
01:31:29,932 --> 01:31:31,932
Now, I don’t know...

2049
01:31:31,932 --> 01:31:34,932
What my life is for, luanne.

2050
01:31:34,932 --> 01:31:38,932
But I do know that god
put me here for a reason

2051
01:31:38,932 --> 01:31:43,932
and if only it’s like a stitch
in the middle of a sweater

2052
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:47,932
you know, so one hand
is holding onto the stitch

2053
01:31:47,932 --> 01:31:48,932
that came before me

2054
01:31:48,932 --> 01:31:52,932
and the other hand’s
holding onto the stitch

2055
01:31:52,932 --> 01:31:53,932
that came after me...

2056
01:31:53,932 --> 01:31:55,932
You know, if that’s all

2057
01:31:55,932 --> 01:31:57,931
it’s still...
It’s still important.

2058
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:00,931
( Dog barking )

2059
01:32:00,931 --> 01:32:02,931
( Chickens clucking )

2060
01:32:02,931 --> 01:32:04,931
Luanne:
Here, Dooley!

2061
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:05,931
Dooley...

2062
01:32:05,931 --> 01:32:07,931
Dooley.

2063
01:32:07,931 --> 01:32:09,931
Don’t you scare
those chickens.

2064
01:32:09,931 --> 01:32:11,931
( Dog barking )

2065
01:32:11,931 --> 01:32:13,931
( Sighing ):
Look at her.

2066
01:32:13,931 --> 01:32:15,931
Isn’t she beautiful?

2067
01:32:15,931 --> 01:32:17,931
Whoa!
( Delighted screaming )

2068
01:32:17,931 --> 01:32:20,931
I wish she could
have seen the orchard.

2069
01:32:22,931 --> 01:32:23,930
Oh... honey...

2070
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:28,930
She is the orchard.

2071
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:29,930
Dooley,
come here.

2072
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,930
( Grace coughing )

2073
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:46,930
( Grace hoarsely ):
Glorie.

2074
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:47,930
I’m here.

2075
01:32:51,929 --> 01:32:52,929
I’m here.

2076
01:32:57,929 --> 01:32:59,929
Can I ask you something?

2077
01:32:59,929 --> 01:33:00,929
Hmm?

2078
01:33:00,929 --> 01:33:03,929
Why do you like
calling me glorie?

2079
01:33:03,929 --> 01:33:05,929
Oh, I can’t help it.

2080
01:33:05,929 --> 01:33:12,929
When I was a little girl,
my mother’s favorite hymn was...

2081
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:15,929
"He will give me
grace and glory

2082
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:18,928
and go with me
all the way."

2083
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:22,928
My mama used to laugh...

2084
01:33:22,928 --> 01:33:25,928
Said, "well, we got
our little grace.

2085
01:33:25,928 --> 01:33:28,928
Now, we just got to wait
for our little glory."

2086
01:33:32,928 --> 01:33:33,928
She never did
get her...

2087
01:33:36,928 --> 01:33:38,928
But I guess I did,
didn’t I?

2088
01:33:40,928 --> 01:33:42,928
You know, glorie...

2089
01:33:42,928 --> 01:33:46,927
You’re the best friend
I ever had.

2090
01:33:46,927 --> 01:33:48,927
( Stifled crying sigh )

2091
01:33:53,927 --> 01:33:55,927
Oh...

2092
01:33:55,927 --> 01:33:57,927
You’re mourning me
already?

2093
01:33:57,927 --> 01:33:58,927
Mm-hmm.

2094
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:05,927
Them other two people
you helped die...

2095
01:34:05,927 --> 01:34:07,927
Did you mourn them, too?

2096
01:34:07,927 --> 01:34:08,927
I guess so.

2097
01:34:13,926 --> 01:34:18,926
That’s what all this messing
with death means.

2098
01:34:18,926 --> 01:34:21,926
You’re afraid
if you stop grieving

2099
01:34:21,926 --> 01:34:25,926
that you’re finally going
to have to let go

2100
01:34:25,926 --> 01:34:27,926
of your little boy.

2101
01:34:27,926 --> 01:34:30,926
I loved him so.

2102
01:34:30,926 --> 01:34:32,926
Of course you did...

2103
01:34:34,926 --> 01:34:38,925
But you know, honey...

2104
01:34:38,925 --> 01:34:42,925
It wasn’t death
tied you two together.

2105
01:34:44,925 --> 01:34:46,925
It was life.

2106
01:34:55,925 --> 01:34:58,925
We’ll have breakfast
in a little while.

2107
01:34:58,925 --> 01:35:00,925
Luanne’s out gathering
the eggs.

2108
01:35:00,925 --> 01:35:01,925
Here.

2109
01:35:01,925 --> 01:35:03,925
In the meantime,
have an apple.

2110
01:35:03,925 --> 01:35:04,925
( Chickens clucking )

2111
01:35:30,924 --> 01:35:33,923
How do you feel?

2112
01:35:33,923 --> 01:35:34,923
Any pain?

2113
01:35:40,923 --> 01:35:42,923
I was just...

2114
01:35:42,923 --> 01:35:44,923
Thinking about my will.

2115
01:35:47,923 --> 01:35:50,923
I wanted to put something
in it for you.

2116
01:35:50,923 --> 01:35:51,923
Oh...

2117
01:35:51,923 --> 01:35:53,923
Don’t be silly.

2118
01:35:56,923 --> 01:35:58,923
You got some things to do.

2119
01:35:58,923 --> 01:35:59,922
Oh, yes.

2120
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:02,922
I’ve got something to do, grace.

2121
01:36:09,922 --> 01:36:11,922
I know what I’ll give you.

2122
01:36:15,922 --> 01:36:19,922
I want you to have
Gabriella’s soup tureen.

2123
01:36:19,922 --> 01:36:21,922
What do you say to that?

2124
01:36:21,922 --> 01:36:23,922
Oh...

2125
01:36:23,922 --> 01:36:26,921
I would be honored.

2126
01:36:26,921 --> 01:36:28,921
Really?

2127
01:36:28,921 --> 01:36:30,921
I’m glad.

2128
01:36:32,921 --> 01:36:35,921
This way, you’ll remember
the rest of your life

2129
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:38,921
what an ornery old pea pod
I was.

2130
01:36:38,921 --> 01:36:39,921
( Weak chuckle )

2131
01:36:45,921 --> 01:36:47,921
( Soft long sigh )

2132
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,920
