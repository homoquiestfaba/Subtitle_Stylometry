187
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:38,733
So it's not as if you
were in love with her.

188
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,869
Sorry, man, listen,
I know you liked her,

189
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,403
but you weren't
together that long.

190
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:45,339
Listen, I've been
there a few times.

191
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,842
Dude, there's plenty
of fish out there, Tom,

192
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,844
you know what I mean?

193
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,680
Here.

194
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,581
Look, she's a
bad actress anyway.

195
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,519
Did you drink some of this?

196
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:00,488
No -- okay,
yes, yes I did.

197
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,524
Oh whatever.
You know...

198
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:07,261
Perhaps a chink
in my armour

199
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,330
makes me more
attractive to another.

200
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,000
What is that, is that--

201
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,085
a Swahili accent?

202
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,936
Is that Australian?

203
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:17,938
You know,
it's like a Nick.

204
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,574
You know you
get hit with a sword...

205
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,742
Get out of here.

206
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,077
Chink...

207
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,545

208
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:46,384
You know, you guys can
stop staring at him, okay?

209

210
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,923
Well Ben, I've never
met a deaf-mute before.

211
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,457
He can see
my lips moving,

212
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,193
but can't understand
a word I'm saying.

213
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,727

me feel bad.

214
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,396
So your girlfriend
had a brother

215
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,914
and you had no idea.

216
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:02,350
That's pretty
wrong, sir.

217
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,385
I don't know,
I mean it's not like

218
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:05,954
we're completely
honest with each other.

219
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,256
It's not like she knows
I covet other women.

220
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:09,758

it for what it is, man,

222
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,428

224
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,432

garlic chickens

225
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:20,201

226
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,138
three drafts,
and the boy?

227
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,540
Uh, add a garlic
chicken and a coke.

228
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:27,976
Thank you.

229
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,311
It will be out shortly.

230
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,679

231
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,267
So uh...
What the hell

232
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,086
was he doing in
New York anyway?

233
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:39,454
Cindy said
he participated

234
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:41,722
in some kind of
intensive clinical trial,

235
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,358
and was too drugged
up to travel, so...

236
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,660
And she didn't tell
you he was retarded?

237
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,530
He's not retarded,
all right?

238
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,865
He looks retarded.

239
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,434
He's in a severe
catatonic state.

240
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:54,902
Apparently it's
a side effect

241
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:56,770
of the drugs they
tested on him.

242
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,474
Drugs, does he
have any in his bag?

243
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:00,508
You know, can--

244
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,909
please change
the subject, please.

245

staring at me?

246

other a long time.

247

you're a good writer,

understand people,

252
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,830

the core of them.

a little, seriously.

266
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,526

opportunity, you know.

268
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,295
she's doing a movie
with Matt Damon.

269
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:55,696
Matt Damon is a hack.

270
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,331
No he's not.
Yes he is.

see school ties?

an older reference?

00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:02,870
A good movie.

275

He's a hack.

276

Was this under
a heat lamp?

277
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,480
Because that was
extremely fast.

I talk now?

901
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,542
but I'm not a pot dealer
and I'm not a thief, so...

902
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,678
We get someone else to sell,

903
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,546
and we, you know,
keep the cash.

904
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:09,235
Whoa-whoa, Tom.

905
00:38:09,304 --> 00:38:10,770
I mean you
can't possibly think

906
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:12,138
that's a good idea, right?

907
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,173
Dude, I think
you can get a way

908
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:16,743
to pull this off, man,
you just scammed a studio

909
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:18,978
into casting you
opposite Sean Connery.

910
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,212
Guys, please, get real.

911
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:21,947
We're busted,
we go to prison.

912
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:23,816
Don't want to end
up somebody's wife.

913
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,685
It's a bad idea,
q, forget it.

914
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:26,886
It's stupid.

915
00:38:26,954 --> 00:38:28,655
I really want to
make that movie.

916
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,190
So do I, but I'm not
risking going to jail

917
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:33,092
to do it, no way.

918
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:36,529
Impossible dreams
call for impossible plans.

919
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,302
It's the accessory
quote, man.

920
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,604
You should work for
them, get money that way.

921
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:46,071
I--

922
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:48,341
oh, Carly's here.

923
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:52,945
Hey, guys,
this is Julie.

924
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:53,879
Hi.

925
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:55,648
She just moved
here from back home,

926
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:57,082
so be nice.

927
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,653
First order
of business...

928
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:02,154
Cocktails!

929
00:39:02,691 --> 00:39:03,989
Brb.

930
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:05,925
Brb, what?

931
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:07,727
Be right
back, silly.

932
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,196
[Laughing]

933
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,030
I'm Tom,

934
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,164
nice to
meet you.

935
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:13,232
This is Ben.

936
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:14,367
Nice to meet you.

937
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,368
Quebert.

938
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,370
Like the video game.

939
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,971
The very one.

940
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,606
Isn't that like,
20 years old?

941
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:21,974
In some countries.

942
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:26,412
Here, please,
sit down.

943
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:27,747
Yeah, by
all means.

944
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:30,115
Very nice,
thank you.

945
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:34,086
So, I'm sure you've been
asked this a dozen times,

946
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,823
what are you doing
in Los Angeles?

947
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:40,493
Um, I'd like to be
a porno actress.

948
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:41,961
And I say actress

949
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:44,296
because I want to
bring the craft...

950
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:46,532
Back to
pornographic films.

951
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:49,301
Really?
The passion.

952
00:39:49,371 --> 00:39:50,803
Really?

953
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:52,739
No, I want to
be a director.

954
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:58,611
Listen, you don't have
to lie just to kick in.

955
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,446
Listen, i'm
going to go.

956
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,200
Careful out there.

957
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,734
Don't mind him,
he's uh...

958
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,703
So, Ben,

959
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,072
I have some ideas

960
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,874
about my part
in your movie.

961
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,642
Well my movie

962
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,511
is just a script
right now, but--

963
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,180
I'd be super-mysterious.

964
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,348
Cut to me,

965
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,050
nude in the
grocery store.

966
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,619
Stalking this bag boy
who's supposed to love me.

967
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,188
Suddenly he
tries to kill me

968
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,555
in the frozen
food section.

969
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,389
[Gasps]

970
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,757
But I tie him up.

971
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,194
With what, I haven't
figured out yet.

972
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,996
But then...
Then we make love

973
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,265
on top of
frozen sirloin.

974
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,634
[Laughing]

975
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:39,936
Carly, that--

976
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,038
oh, peas, I
meant to say peas.

977
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,240
Oh, okay, we'll
see what we

978
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,042
can work out
when we get there.

979
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,210
Peas is good.

980
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,212
Julie, mind
if I go mingle?

981
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,080
No, go ahead.
Please.

982
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,116
Holy shit.

983
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,752
So choking,
biting, spanking,

984
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,855
these are
things I'm into.

985
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,622
Yourself?

986
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,590
No?

987
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,059
Come on.

988
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,362
Excuse me,

989
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,965
I'm a producer,
and you are?

990
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,100
It's okay,
I'm Billy.

991
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:15,004
I just moved here,
my daddy never loved me.

992
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:18,241
I'm Arnie, and
I want to comfort you.

993
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,742
Is this your friend?

994
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,010
Bobby, this
is Arnie.

995
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,246
Hi.

996
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,048
You're both
named after men.

997
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:29,085
Yeah, our daddy was
hoping we would be boys.

998
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,786
But we weren't.

999
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,855
Hmm... sisters.

1000
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:36,458
Oh... can I buy
you ladies a drink?

1001
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,960
Sure.

1002
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,795
I'm going to use
the powder room.

1003
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,197
Please, okay.

1004
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:51,007
So obviously because
you're ignoring me,

1005
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,442
the golden shower is
out of the question?

1006
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,944
You don't
want to kiss?

1007
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,946
Come on, just
give me a chance.

1008
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,347
I've got an 8 inch.

1009
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,149
We should make
out right now.

1010
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,683
I love Roman
face masks.

1011
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,953
Are you into
69 -- ever?

1012
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,988
I know we don't
know each other well,

1013
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,024
but can I get your
number at least?

1014
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,658
So I'm originally
from Montana,

1015
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,194
and I just graduated
from nyu film school,

1016
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,298
and I thought, make
the move, time to go.

1017
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:19,835
I'm sorry, i'm
talking too much.

1018
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:20,836
No, no.

1019
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,604
I do that when
I get nervous.

1020
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,940
It's very
impressive.

1021
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,942
Um...

1022
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,644
Do you want to take
this back to the crib?

1023
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,979
Yeah, cool.

1024
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,847
Do you want to join US?

1025
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,749
Carly is definitely
going to be there.

1026
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:35,818
Yo, q,
let's go, homes.
Okay.

1027
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,420
Yeah?

1028
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,728
Oh my g--

1029
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,631
you were so good in
prom night massacre.

1030
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,435
Excuse me, do
you matter to me?

1031
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:54,570
Guess not.

1032
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:55,904
No, probably not.

1033
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:58,040
Then step off.

1034
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,343
It's all right,
Julie, I'll--

1035
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,444
in a second.

1036
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,846
Small world.

1037
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,449
Been a while, huh?

1038
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,518
Oh yes, all
of three days.

1039
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,688
Hmm, so I hear
you got the bond gig.

1040
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,023
That's great.

1041
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,358
You'll be like,

1042
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,926
the new low rent
Matt Damon in no time.

1043
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:19,628
[Laughter]

1044
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,065
Kind of like that

1045
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,666
pimp you're with.

1046
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,137
Excuse me?

1047
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,939
Were uh...

1048
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,841
You just
referring to me?

1049
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:37,646
No, I mean
seriously, I just--

1050
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,049
she's my uh, ex,

1051
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,084
and I just got
a little mouthy.

1052
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,685
I don't--
I really didn't--

1053
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,221
I start a movie
really soon,

1054
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,755
and it's a
really big part.

1055
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,124
And i--
I just really,

1056
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,692
please, I
didn't mean it.

1057
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,595
Hm...

1058
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,032
I didn't think so.

1059
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,633
Thank you.

1060
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,469
He's a producer.

1061
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:02,004
And you might
want to be

1062
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,372
a little nicer to me

1063
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,641
if you want me
to be in your movie.

1064
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,808
I don't.

1065
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,777
Forget about him.

1066
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,015
What was it you were
producing again?

1067
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,216
Everything, babe.

1068
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,218
Oh.

1069
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,222
[Indistinct conversation]

1070
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:25,528
Get the drinks, baby,

1071
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,663
I've got to go
check on Wendell.

1072
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,133
Oh, that's my hand.

1073
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:32,668
Wendell!

1074
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,904
Wendell's not in my
room, where is he?

1075
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,873
Relax, man, don't
freak, you'll find him.

1076
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:39,175
Wendell!

1077
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,543
He can't hear you, Ben.

1078
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:41,910
Wendell!

1079
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:45,013
Wendell,
