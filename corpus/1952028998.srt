00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:19,411
Retirement can be a tough transition.

182
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:20,475
All right?

183
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:33,564
Okay. Oh, yeah. Hey, listen.

184
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,601
Don't mix those sleeping pills with alcohol

185
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,659
unless you want to kill yourself.

Saved? [snickers] Shit.

332
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:51,242
I don't remember shit from Watergate

333

to when the space shuttle blew up.

334
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:54,072
Hmm. Money I saved.

335
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,671
Okay, what about the royalties?
I used to get

336
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,511
over $30,000 a year off that shit.

337
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,347
I lost my royalties in a poker game.
All right?

338
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,649
- Poker?
- Listen here, man.

339
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,883
If you serious about un-assing me

340
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:06,925
from my lavish surroundings here,

341
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,893
man, you gonna have to be
a little more flexible

342
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:12,055
in your thinking. Say, oh...

343
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:13,155
60/40.

344
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,325
Man, you must be higher
than a motherfucker.

345
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,835
We always split shit
straight down the middle.

346

over to my nephew.

Don't have to worry

535
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:13,338
- 'Cause I'm here
- Yeah.

536
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,539
No need to summon me there

'Cause I'm here

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:18,209
Yea-ah

Ladies and gentlemen,
please forgive us

568
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,202
for this technical difficulty.

Aah!

571
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:24,946
Fucking eye, man!

572
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:27,042
I'm sorry, man.
I got on these tight slacks!

573
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,848
Well, then, I'll sue your fat ass!

574
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:29,888
You sue these nuts.

575
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,718
- Go on, get on outta here.
- Jesus!

576
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,950
Take it from the top.

577
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:34,424
How are we gonna
take it from the top?

578
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:35,858
- I'm rewed up to go, man,
- You can't hardly breathe.

579
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:37,122
- You may need a chest X-ray.
- I'm good!

580
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,390
Is there a doctor in the house?

581
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:40,364
I love you, Debbie.

582
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,593
- Get off me, Ernest T!
- [Thud]

583
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:44,397
Lou. Lou. Lou. Calm down, man.

584
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,097
Ain't but 12 motherfuckers out here, man.

585
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:47,695
It's still a audience!

586
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:49,934
I don't care if it's two or three.
It's a audience.

587
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:51,100
That's what I'm talking about.

588
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:52,575
Your attitude is fd up.

589
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:54,908
Same thing that messed us up
back in the day.

590
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,107
No. You know what fucked our shit up
back in the day?

591
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:58,114
No. I don't know.

592
00:23:58,183 --> 00:23:59,548
Oh, you know goddamn well

593
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:00,880
what fucked our shit up back in the day.

594
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,614
- Oh, I do, huh?
- Yes, you do!

595
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,553
What fucked our shit up
back in the day

596
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:08,320
was you sticking your johnson
in my woman!

597
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:10,122

Ladies and gentlemen,

600
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:24,937
I'm Floyd Henderson.

601
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,637
This fool is Louis Hinds.

602
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,306
We are The Real Deal,
and that's for real.

603
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:33,750
I want to thank you for being
a super audience here tonight.

604
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,684
[Softly]
Motherfucker.

605
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,984
I'm sorry I hit you, Debbie. Come back.

606
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:40,581
Shut the fuck up,
or I'll knock your dick in the dirt.

607
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,991
- Drunk son of a bitch.

00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:44,221

610
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:49,800
<i>Happy</i>

611
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,768
Hey, Louis, are we gonna talk
about last night,

612
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,327
or we just gonna let it fester?

613
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,773
All right. Well, I was
a little rusty, okay?

614
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:00,436
That's a insult to rust, ain't it?

615
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:02,104
Well, what about you,
motherfucker?

616
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,911
Last night, look like you were
stuck in cement.

617
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,177
I had a hip replacement, Louis.

618
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:07,878
Well, you should've paid
a hundred more dollars

619
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:09,978
and got the deluxe model
with some rhythm in it.

620
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:11,886
'Cause that motherfucker you got,

621
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:14,050
- it ain't working.
- Oh, that's fine, man.

622
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:15,184
But that's not what we talking about.

623
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,818
I'm talking about Odetta.

624
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,888
Oh.

625
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:20,158
Louis, if I thought there was still

626
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:21,699
- gonna be a problem between us...
- You went

627
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,667
where you shouldn't have gone,

628
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,134
period!

629
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:26,330
Now, there's some shit

630
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,236
that's just etched in stone.

631
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,207
First and foremost is

632
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:34,678
thou shall not dig for diamonds
in another brother's mine!

633
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:37,476
Bullshit, man. You gotta take
some responsibility here.

634
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:38,641
You think she didn't know, man,

635
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:39,843
about all of your smoking

636
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,146
and drinking and drugs

637
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,687
and other women? She knew.

638
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:44,745
She came running to me
telling, "My man

639
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:47,815
Louis did this. Louis did that.
Hold me, Floyd."

640
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:49,224
All right, well, getting the pussy
is one thing.

641
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:50,727
- You ain't had to marry her.
- What?

642
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:52,195
You'd have to be a zip-down fool

643
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:53,925
to let her slide
through your fingers, man.

644
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,728
All right, well, if I'm a fool,
then you are, too.

645
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:58,565
You think I don't know that?
She hurt my heart, too.

646
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:02,198
Good!
That's a poor motherfucking comfort.

647
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:05,539
But it's comfort, nonetheless.

648
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:06,839

00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:08,436

653
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:26,387
Well, how many times did you say
you was married after Odetta?

654
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,894
[Sighs] Four.

655
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,026
Ohh!

656
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:34,038
I married this girl named Estelle
to get over Odetta.

657
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:35,573
Then I married Henrietta.

658
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,836
She wasn't no good for me.

659
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,207
Then I married Josephine.

660
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,247
She definitely wasn't no good for me
because she met Carl.

661
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,305
All right. That's three.

662
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:46,078
Who was lucky number four?

663
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:47,982
Her name was Consuelo.

664
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:48,985
[Louis grunts]

665
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:50,681
She left me and went back to Cuba.

666
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:53,748
Ha ha ha!
People actually go back to Cuba?

667
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:55,918
She said she'd rather
spend the rest of her life

668
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:58,326
under that dictatorship
than spend another night with me.

669
00:26:58,397 --> 00:26:59,625
[Grunts]

670
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,993
How 'bout you?
How come you never got married?

671
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,901
I almost hooked up
with this girl down in the Philippines,

672
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:06,960
in Manila.

673
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:11,171
- Wow.
- But, uh, I couldn't learn to speak

674
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:13,336
Tagalog, and only English she knew

675
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:15,403
was, "Me love you
long time for two dollar."

676
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,607
[Both chuckle]

677
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:20,675
Yeah, I wasn't no good
at relationships after Odetta.

678
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:22,049
You ever hear from her?

679
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,348
Who, Mai Mai?

680
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:24,354
No. Odetta.

681
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:26,414
Oh. No, man.

682
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:28,886
I heard from her, man.

683
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,428
It was sometime around Christmas.

684
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:33,362
You know, in that place
she was living in Tulsa. You know?

685
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:34,660
[Muttering]

686
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:36,667

What you doing?

688
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,166
- I saw a coyote.
- Whyn't you put that thing up

689
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:41,535
before somebody get hurt, man?

690
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:42,971
How come you think
I don't know how to handle

691
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,406
- no damn piece, man?
- Think?

692
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:46,968
I know.

693
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:49,013
Yeah? [chuckles]

Yeah, come fuck with me now, Louis.

696
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:56,010
Yeah. [chuckles]
I'll bust one in your ass.

Floyd, you keep fucking around,

698
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,587
I'm gonna stick that gun
so far up your ass,

699
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,489
you gonna taste gunpowder
every time you talk.

Louis, that was a accident. I swear.

Oh. Look!

890
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:49,732
Oh, shoot, I'm leaking, girl.

891
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,393
Tonight I ain't got no
control like that no more.

892
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:55,200
Now, I hope you don't
mind a little hair.

893
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:59,004
Baby, I found
my sexual awakening in the '60s.

894
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:02,604
Nothing I like better
than a big old fluffy...

895
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:06,043
Damn, girl.

896
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:08,051
That's a whole bunch of hair
you got down there.

897
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,087
Yeah, I call it the natural look.

898
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:12,453
You sick?

899
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:14,321
I know it's big.

900
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:15,984
You need a pick.

901
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,357
You want me to shave it?

902
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,592
We ain't got the time or
apparatus for that type of job.

903
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,394
- Okay, disregard.

906
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:27,428
Look who's coming to dinner.

907
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,336
Right on time, ain't it?

908
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:30,840
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

909
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,570
Oh.

910
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:33,702
You know what I'm
gonna do for you?

911
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:35,177
What you fixing to do?

912
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:37,111
You ever had a velveteen rub?

913
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:39,548
A velveteen rub.

914
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:42,017
Ain't... Ain't no cheese involved, is there?

915
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:43,986
Because I'm lactose intolerant.

916
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:46,546
[Laughing]

917
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,389

Ugh.

925
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:21,759
That's quite a show you got going

926
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:23,794
under the big top there, Sparky.

927
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:25,329
I had to take another
one of them damn pills

928
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:26,624
in the middle of the night, man.

929

Huh?

Mmm-hmm.

944

Mmm. You need a little air
on this thing.

You little whore.

You're one to talk.

Oh, did you take out
your teeth for him?

957
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:16,637
You watch how you talk to your mama.

958
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:18,306
Please, you can't
talk to me like that.

959
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:19,441
You're not my daddy.

960
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:20,541

<i>If we don't get no money,</i>

I'm not sure what the procedure
for that would be.

1000
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:42,024
I mean, there's just
a lot of red tape here.

00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:18,352
I know who you are.

1066
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:20,083
Guess you didn't hear
about the funeral.

1067
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:22,922
Funeral? Odetta...

1068
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:24,086
When did she pass?

1069
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:26,289
Well, she got sick right after Christmas.

1070
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:29,299
After that, it went pretty fast.

1071
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,460
So why'd you come to see her?

1072
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:32,696
What, she owe you
money or something?

1073
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,000
- Oh, no.
- We just in the neighborhood.

1074
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:37,540
[Man]
Cleo, I can't find the bologna!

1075
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:39,371
I'll be there in a minute!

1076
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:41,172
Hurry up!
[Sigh]

1077
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:45,705
Well, if my mama wasn't dead,
I'd tell her you stopped by.

1078
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:47,045
[Man]
Cleo!

1079
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:50,144
- Just hold on a second.
- C-L-E-O!

1080
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:51,245
- What the hell you want?
- I'm sorry...

1081
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:52,584
I told you this was
a bad idea to come here.

1082
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:53,954
Come on, man. Don't go there.

1083
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:55,049
Let's just go, okay?

1084
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:56,150
How old you think she is?

1085
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:57,626
27, 28?

1086
00:41:57,695 --> 00:41:59,526
I don't know how old she is,
and I don't care. Let's go.

1087
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:00,757
[Floyd]
Chillax, let me see something.

1088
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:02,197
[Louis]
What are you doing?

1089
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,461
Floyd, what the hell
are you looking for?

1090
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:05,661
Damn it.

1091
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,033
I'm just confirming a suspicion.

1092
00:42:07,104 --> 00:42:08,662
That's all I'm doing.

1093
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:11,867
September 14, 1981. Bingo.

1094
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:14,173
It kind of works itself out, don't it?

1095
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:15,439
[Louis]
Put it back.

1096
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:18,308
Listen.

1097
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:19,781
Odetta left me, man,

1098
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:22,479
Thanksgiving Day, man, 1980.

1099
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:24,544
- So?
- So you do the math, motherfucker.

1100
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:27,182
Do the math? Nigga, please...

1101
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:28,691
- <i>[bass line]</i>
- Oh, shit. You hear that?

1102
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:29,953
Hear what?

1103
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:32,689
Listen, that bass line, right there.

1104
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:34,924
Hmm?

1105
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,728
[Laughing]
Son of a bitch.

1106
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:40,165
Oh, my name is Lester,
the Court Jester

1107
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:42,206
All you other rap niggas
done messed up

1108
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:43,763
I take you to school a semester

1109
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:45,331
Take you to court and sequester

1110
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:47,343
- Yeah!
- I'm judge and the jury

1111
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:49,106
- Bruce Lee, <i>Fists of Fury.</i>
- <i>[gunshot]</i>

1112
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,375
You want to whip me,
the L-E-S-T-E-R

1113
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:53,110
<i>[gunshot]</i>

1114
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:54,082
Grab my girl by the waist

1115
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:55,448
Slap my girl in the face

1116
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:57,714
When my mama died,
I moved inside her crib

1117
00:42:57,788 --> 00:43:00,586
Hey, hey. Les, Les.

1118
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:02,558
Hey, man, what you doing in here?

1119
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:04,788
- [Record scratches]
- We're here trying to make some music.

1120
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:07,353
That what y'all doing?

1121
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:08,625
I don't see no musicians.

1122
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,065
[Floyd]
Listen, you know who played the base line

1123
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:13,797
on that stuff you got running
under those so-called lyrics?

1124
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:16,499
My man, right there.

1125
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:17,905
[Laughing]

1126
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:19,272
Yeah, right, man.

1127
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:22,870
He ain't no damn instrumentator.

1128
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:24,574
Hey, yo, Big L, check it out, man.
It's them, man.

1129
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:25,843
They ain't bullshitting.

1130
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,179
Let me see this here.

1131
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:29,549
[Lester]
The Real Deal, huh?

1132
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,316
Hey, I mean, so what if we
jacked your shit, man? Huh?

1133
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,824
Good artists borrow,

1134
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:36,723
great artists steal, man.

1135
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:39,262
- You know who said that?
- Pablo Picasso.

1136
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,458
But literary scholars sometimes
like to attribute it to T.S. Eliot.

1137
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:45,934
Hell, no. It wasn't no damn
Missy Elliot, man.

1138
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:48,233
No, man, it was Bay Bay and them.

1139
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:49,432
Bay Bay, yup.

1140
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:51,805
That was Bay Bay,
for sure, hey, Bay Bay.

1141
00:43:51,876 --> 00:43:52,900
Look, man.

1142
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:54,638
You know what? I'm sorry.

1143
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:56,771
I shouldn't have sampled
your music without permission.

1144
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:59,111
Why don't we all do a song together?

1145
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:01,651
A song called "Fuck You
and Your Bass Line."

1146
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,482
That's what I feel about it.

1147
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,488
Here what I think
about your damn bassline.

1148
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:08,150
Henderson and Hinds!

1149
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:09,249
Take that shit with you.

1150
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:10,919
Gold-faced motherfucker.

1151
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:12,121
I made that shit gangster,
that's what I did.

1152
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:13,595
Let me tell you something,
man, you...

1153
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:15,791

Hey! Stop it!

1154

[All yelling]

1155
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:19,664
Stop it!

1156
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:21,432
Hey! This is my house.
You hear me?

1157
00:44:21,505 --> 00:44:22,870
I don't need this shit right now.

1158
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,999
You gonna talk to me crazy
in front of my boys?

1159
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:27,306
Why you still talking?
Shut the fuck up!

1160
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:29,778
Pay-Pay and Zig-Zig,

1161
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:31,872
let's dip, man.

1162
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:35,749
Bye, old niggers.

1163
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,312
Feel free to utilize
my facilities while you're here

1164
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,687
to make yourself another hit.

1165
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:44,194
I know you ain't had a hit
since lke hit Tina.

1166
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:45,228
Get out of here.

1167
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:48,356
Get the fuck

1168
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:50,696

My name is Lester the Court Jester.

1171
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:58,874
What a disrespectful son of a bitch.

1172
00:44:58,943 --> 00:45:01,343
- Just lay off.
- Just lay off?

1173
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,039
I know your mama taught you better.

1174
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:04,581
Odetta would've
whooped his damn ass.

1175
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:06,980
The fuck you know about
what my mama would've done.

1176
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:09,383
Were you here when she was
dying of that cancer?

1177
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:11,887
I don't think so. I think Lester was.
The hell you know.

1178
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:13,218
You're right. I don't know nothing.

1179
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,689
That's right, he don't know shit.

1180
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:16,522
No, he don't.

1181
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:19,392
Now I'm going to go change
and get dinner started

1182
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:21,055
because you guys
are staying, right?

1183
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:22,258
Oh, no. We need to hit the road.

1184
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,392
Yes, ma'am. We are staying.

1185
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,732
Okay, then.

1186
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:31,371
Hell, it's what Mama would've wanted.

1187
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:34,536
Oh, yeah. That's Odetta's
child, all right.

1188
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:45,385
Okay, I put some sheets on the bed
in the guest room for you guys.

1189
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:47,686
Thank you.

1190
00:45:47,758 --> 00:45:49,885
That's Carla Thomas, right?

1191
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,554
Sure is. Your mother's favorite.

1192
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:57,325
So how come you guys only
put out that one album?

1193
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:01,270
Well, when we wasn't
fighting over your mother,

1194
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:02,600
we had a problem
in our record sales.

1195
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:04,641
Yeah, as in we didn't sell any.

1196
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:05,868
Okay.

1197
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:07,535
[Men's voices]

1198
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:10,808
[Cleo]
Well, you'd never know it wasn't a hit,

1199
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:12,906
as much as Mama played it.

1200
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:14,974
[Chatter]

1201
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:20,821
About 100 degrees, and you
got a leather jacket on.

1202
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:22,153
Appreciate it, Sam.

1203
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:23,659
[Laughing]

1204
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:25,888
She said,

1205
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:27,624
being on the road with y'all

1206
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:30,963
was some of the best times of her life.

1207
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:34,664
Oh, good days. Good days.

1208
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:37,332
I wish I could've seen that.

1209
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:41,640
Say, why don't you
come to Memphis with us?

1210
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:43,839
- Memphis?
- Yeah.

1211
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:45,848
- What?
- We got a gig.

1212
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:47,008
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Floyd, Floyd.

1213
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:48,176
The girl got a life.

1214
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:49,344
She ain't got time to be ripping,

1215
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,853
running up and down the road
with two old niggers.

1216
00:46:50,921 --> 00:46:52,388
Why not?

1217
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,016
Memphis is fun.
We always have fun in Memphis.

1218
00:46:55,092 --> 00:46:56,184
You'll enjoy it. Trust me.

1219
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,889
Fun? Look like I got time for fun?

1220
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:02,225
Nah.

1221
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:11,975
Hey, Louis.

1222
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:15,102
You know, Cleo was telling me

1223
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:17,204
that Odetta never told her nothing
about her father,

1224
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:19,545
not even his name.

1225
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:21,380
But she did say
he was a musician.

1226
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:22,976
You ain't said nothing stupid
to the girl, have you?

1227
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:24,145
Like what?

1228
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:27,019
Oh, like, uh,

1229
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:28,319
Cleo, you know, I'm your daddy.

1230
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:31,054
Well, I'm still
feeling out the situation.

1231
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:32,390
What the fuck was that

1232
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:34,090
that "You ought to come
to Memphis with us" shit?

1233
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:37,498
Now that, right there,
that's a recipe for disaster.

1234
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:40,833
Louis, Louis, I know

00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:18,124
Thank you.

1409
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:23,427
What's up?

1410
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,230
Phillip, tonight we're
playing at the House of Soul.

1411
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:27,634
Make sure you be there, baby.

1412
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,639
Right on.

1413
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:33,403
Hello. Welcome to the Peabody.
How can I help you?

1414
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:35,911
You can help me by giving me

1415
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:37,640
three of your best
doggone suites, baby.

1416
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:40,649
Well, it'll be my pleasure
to assist you today.

1417
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:41,843
May I see some identification, please?

1418
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:43,078
Okay.

1419
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:44,586
Right there.

1420
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,145
- [Laughing]
- Go to hell, Louis.

1421
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:49,192
Mr. Henderson?

1422
00:55:49,259 --> 00:55:50,726
It is I.

1423
00:55:51,762 --> 00:55:53,821
[Alarm beeping]

1424
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,093
Will you excuse me
for just a minute, please?

1425
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:00,329
Okay.

1426
00:56:01,672 --> 00:56:03,765
[Woman]
Henderson.

1427
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,003
Ahh, I-I'm sorry,
Mr. Henderson, Henderson.

1428
00:56:07,077 --> 00:56:08,874
We're unable to accommodate you.

1429
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:10,970
Perhaps we could
recommend another hotel.

1430
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:12,640
For what, man? I'm in Memphis.

1431
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:14,047
I want to stay at the Peabody.

1432
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:16,677
Yes, sir, I understand
you've stayed with us before,

1433
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,152
and apparently,
that's the problem.

1434
00:56:18,221 --> 00:56:20,485
It seems that the last time
you stayed here...

1435
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:23,720
March 12, 1978, to be exact...

1436
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:26,763
you hosted a party,
during which the room

1437
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,695
and several other areas of the hotel

1438
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:31,097
- sustained extensive damage.
- Uh-oh.

1439
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:33,329
I don't recollect nothing like that.

1440
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,268
I think that's the night
Sly and Bootsy

1441
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:36,896
came by with the fire-eater.

1442
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:39,305
Is that the one with the snake?

1443
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:41,310
- That's the one.
- Hmm.

1444
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:45,041
Perhaps you could put those rooms
in the name of Louis Hinds.

1445
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:46,377
Yeah, perhaps.

1446
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,475
Louis Hinds, we'll try that.

1447
00:56:51,154 --> 00:56:53,520
[Alarm beeping]

1448
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:57,893
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Linda.

1449
00:56:57,961 --> 00:56:59,690
What's on there?
Let me see that shit.

1450
00:56:59,763 --> 00:57:01,890
I want to see what's on there.

1451
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:04,763
I need four rooms, Don.

1452
00:57:04,835 --> 00:57:06,769
Your best available.

1453
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:10,238

1456
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:24,343
Oh, hey, guys.

1457
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,514
Your tailor gave me
several choices for tonight.

1458
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,558
He said he's going
to stop by around 7:30.

1459
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:29,683
What the fuck?

1460
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,455
Did you catch the sale
over at the Build-A-Pimp?

1461
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:33,689
You like that? It's fly, huh?

1462
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:36,392
It's a get-down, get-down.
It's live. It's funky.

1463
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:38,058
And I think I'm going
to get some poonanny.

1464
00:57:38,135 --> 00:57:39,625
To be honest with you,

1465
00:57:39,703 --> 00:57:42,069
I haven't been laid
since <i>Friends</i> was on television.

1466
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:43,401
So this is my night.

1467
00:57:43,473 --> 00:57:46,033
You sure that ain't
one of your children?

1469
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:50,074
[Floyd]
You gonna sing real nice tonight.

1470
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:51,307
[Louis]
Who's the girl singer?

1471
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:53,611
[Floyd laughing]

1472
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:58,243
Oh, my goodness!
Look at here! Oh, man.

1473
00:57:58,321 --> 00:57:59,447
Hello, Louis. Good to see you.

1474
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:00,615
You good, man?

[Man]
Hey, good-looking.

1476
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,456
Claudette.
How you doing, girl?

1477
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:13,093
I know you still ain't upset

1478
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:14,467
about what happened
in Baltimore that...

1479
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:16,563
Oh! What's wrong
with you, woman?

1480
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,040
You going straight to hell, Floyd Henderson.

1481

What you laughing at?

1482
00:58:21,912 --> 00:58:24,779
- You want some, too?
- No.

Fuck you.

Eee.

Fuck you, fuck you

1486
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:30,913
Now we have no girl singer.

1487
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:32,921
We just got to find
a replacement, that's all.

1488
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:34,149
It's too late.

1489
00:58:35,192 --> 00:58:36,454
Cleo.

1490
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:38,323
You know all our songs, right?

1491
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:41,296
Ho ho ho. No offense, man,

1492
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:43,025
but I'm not playing
with no rank amateur.

1493
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:45,431
Come on, Wolfman,
this ain't no rank amateur, man.

1494
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:47,163
This Odetta Whitfield's daughter, man.

1495
00:58:47,237 --> 00:58:48,363
Ain't got to recognize.

1496

If music makes you move

1505
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:21,635

You know Isaac wants
to put me in his studio?

- I'll bet you could.
- [Laughing]

1586
01:03:22,112 --> 01:03:23,272
Let me get you a drink.

1587
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:24,472
Yeah, I'll take one.

1588
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:25,809
But hold on, before you do that,

1589
01:03:25,882 --> 01:03:27,474
there's something
I want to say to you.

1590
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,450
It's been a blast connecting with you.

1591
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:30,781
I want you to know that.

1592
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:32,287
That's sweet of you.

1593
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:33,617
And if you need anything,

1594
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:34,884
like money or something like that,

1595
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,722
don't you hesitate to call me now.

1596
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:39,853
Not that money gonna make up
for the lost time between us

1597
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:41,396
or nothing like that.

1598
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:42,726
Lost time?

1599
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:43,823
You have to understand,

1600
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,994
Odetta never told me
nothing about you.

1601
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,833
Had I known about you
from the beginning,

1602
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:50,167
- I'd have been here from the start.
- Whoa, whoa.

1603
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,502
- Floyd...
- She never said nothing to me about you.

1604
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:52,836
You're not my father, Floyd.

1605
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:54,342
You're not listening.

1606
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,002
See, the thing you...
what's that? Say what?

1607
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,637
You're not my father.

1608
01:03:57,714 --> 01:03:59,443
I-I'm not?

1609
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:00,813
No.

1610
01:04:00,884 --> 01:04:02,476
How do you know?

1611
01:04:02,552 --> 01:04:04,850
Because he knows who I am

1612
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:06,411
Or he did.

1613
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:07,751
I mean, for all I know,

1614
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:09,052
he could be dead.

1615
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:13,462
I get a little money from him
every once in a while.

1616
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:16,260
It's a blind trust he set up years ago.

1617
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:18,459
Something to do
with his music royalties.

1618
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:21,265
Music royalties?

1619
01:04:22,272 --> 01:04:24,172
[Banging]

1620
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,037
Oh!

1621
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:28,009
You knocked up my wife, motherfucker.

1622
01:04:28,077 --> 01:04:31,205
Ooh. You stole her from me first.

1623
01:04:31,281 --> 01:04:33,146
What is wrong with you?

1624
01:04:33,216 --> 01:04:34,740
Whoo!

1625
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:36,148
You lost your...

1626
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:37,652
You didn't tell Cleo, did you?

1627
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,153
No, I didn't tell her.

1628
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:40,553
I should've told her, though.

1629
01:04:40,623 --> 01:04:42,887
I'll bet you laughing
your ass off, wasn't you?

1630
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:44,426
Going around, talking
about I'm the girl's daddy

1631
01:04:44,494 --> 01:04:47,327
and big round circle of life,
all that bullshit.

1632
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:48,830
Giggle, giggle, motherfucker.

1633
01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:50,559
Well, just a little bit.

1634

[Grunting]

1635
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:53,833
Floyd...

1636
01:04:53,903 --> 01:04:55,666
Look, Floyd...

1637
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:56,932
Floyd, put it down. Put it down!

1638
01:04:57,006 --> 01:04:59,600
Dawg, come on!

1639
01:04:59,676 --> 01:05:01,268
You need to quit before you get hurt.

1640
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:04,336
Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh!

1641
01:05:04,414 --> 01:05:05,438
- Ugh!
- [Clatter]

1642
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:06,948
Look, Floyd,

1643
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:08,950
I didn't mean for it
to happen, all right?

1644
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:10,315
You know how she was.

1645
01:05:10,386 --> 01:05:11,444
Come here.

1646
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:13,716
Come here.

1647
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,348
Come on, man. Stop acting a fool.

[Grunting]

1649
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:17,817
You all right?

1650
01:05:17,894 --> 01:05:19,828
Aw, shit. Quit acting a fool!

[Whimpering]

1659
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:50,956
Time out.

1660
01:05:51,027 --> 01:05:53,257
Time out.

1661
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,923
Oh.
[Inhaler discharges]

1662
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:59,465
Still got a little pop
in your punch there, partner.

1663
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:01,662
Pop this, motherfucker!

You dirty motherfucker,

1668
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:10,211
hitting me in the nuts.

1669
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,578
Ooh! Shit.

1670
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:16,517
Louis, you just can't
keep whooping on my ass.

1671
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:18,679
I'm a motherfucking man, baby.

01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:20,279
I'm a motherfucking man.

[Both whimpering]

1674
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:26,487
Louis, how come you won't
see your own daughter?

1675
01:06:26,562 --> 01:06:28,553
Oh, motherfucker,
I wanted to see her,

1676
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:31,122
but, you know...

1677
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,101
It's time... After a while,

1678
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:37,196
you know, it's just...
it's just too much.

1679
01:06:37,273 --> 01:06:39,036
Why didn't O tell her?

1680
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:40,700
Why didn't Odetta tell her, man?

1681
01:06:40,777 --> 01:06:42,711
What was she going to tell her, huh?

1682
01:06:42,779 --> 01:06:46,476
That her daddy was
a alcoholic dopehead convict

1683
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:48,881
that fucked up everything
he touched, hmm?

1684
01:06:48,951 --> 01:06:50,043
No, no.

1685
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:51,950
She was better off without me.

1686

Oh, shit.

1687
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:54,614
Anyhow, it's too late now.

Uh-uh.

1689
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:58,283
It was a mistake
getting to know her.

1690
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:00,022
- Lou...
- What?

1691
01:07:00,096 --> 01:07:01,461

You having a seizure?

01:09:39,589 --> 01:09:41,318
This filthy-ass motherfucking place,

1764
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,948
man, got me itching.

1765
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,592
Yo, turnkey!

1766
01:09:46,662 --> 01:09:48,357
Come on and let me out
of this motherfucker!

1767
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:50,695
You might want to wrap
your mind around the fact

1768
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:51,892
that we're gonna miss that show.

1769
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:53,697
Fuck you talking about, man?

1770
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:56,397
We gotta be in New York
tomorrow night.

1771
01:09:56,472 --> 01:09:58,235
Uh-uh. Not me.

1772
01:09:58,307 --> 01:09:59,535
I've had enough. I'm done.

1773
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:01,634
What, you're walking
out on me, Louis?

1774
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:04,009
Look, Floyd,
I was doing just fine

1775
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,377
before you showed up at my door.

1776
01:10:05,448 --> 01:10:06,745
That's the thanks I get

1777
01:10:06,816 --> 01:10:08,283
for pulling you out
of that fucking rat hole.

1778
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:09,613
You was just sitting up in there,

1779
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:10,879
just sitting there waiting to die.

1780
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:12,079
Negro, please.

1781
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:13,746
You ain't no different from me,

1782
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:16,451
Especially since your nephew
put your senile ass out to pasture

1783
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:17,686
and stole your business.

1784
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,591
Fuck you, Louis.

1785
01:10:19,662 --> 01:10:22,722
Crawl back under that damn rock
you've been living.

1786
01:10:22,798 --> 01:10:24,322
I don't need you.

1787
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,425
I'll do this shit by my damn self.

1788
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:29,994
Yo! Turnkey!

1789
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:31,835
Come on and let me
out of this motherfucker.

1790
01:10:31,908 --> 01:10:33,671
I've had enough, man.
I want my lawyer.

1791
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:34,767
Relax, relax.

1792
01:10:34,844 --> 01:10:36,778
You ain't gonna need no lawyer.

1793
01:10:36,846 --> 01:10:38,973
Witnesses say
your story checks out,

1794
01:10:39,048 --> 01:10:41,778
so you, sir, are good to go.

1795
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:45,252
- Yeah.
- [Groaning]

1796
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:47,789
Whoa. Hold on there, Chuck Berry.

1797
01:10:47,857 --> 01:10:50,087
You're gonna need a lawyer.

1798
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:53,890
Seems crossing state lines
is in violation of his parole,

1799
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:55,931
Not to mention
possession of firearms

1800
01:10:55,998 --> 01:10:57,295
and driving without a license.

1801
01:10:57,366 --> 01:10:58,424
No license?

1802
01:10:59,669 --> 01:11:00,931
Step back for a minute.

1803
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:05,105
I hope your ass rot up in here,

1804
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:07,142
you criminal-bound
motherfucker, you.

1805
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:12,374
As Lao-Tzu says,
"Let things flow forward as they may."

1806
01:11:12,448 --> 01:11:14,780
And I'm gonna let it flow, too, baby.

1807
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:19,048
And I got some Blackanese
philosophical shit for your ass, pal.

1808
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:21,612
You get by, Lou,
but you don't get away.

1809
01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:23,955
You sit in shit,
you start to smell like it,

1810
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:25,584
so check the crack of your ass.

1811
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:27,822
Here's something else for you.

1812
01:11:27,897 --> 01:11:30,024
Here go her number.

1813
01:11:31,067 --> 01:11:33,592
Call her... Daddy.

1814
01:11:35,271 --> 01:11:36,499
Fuck him, man!

1815
01:11:36,572 --> 01:11:38,335
Let's get on
out of this motherfucker.

1816
01:11:38,407 --> 01:11:40,739
He ain't worth
two damn flies smashed.

1817
01:11:43,045 --> 01:11:44,137
Nigger.

1818
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:52,679
Hmph!

1819
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,130
Hey. Yo!

1820
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:07,902
Can I make a phone call?

1821
01:12:23,653 --> 01:12:25,848
<i>You walking out on me, Louis?</i>

1822
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:27,286
<i>I've had enough. I'm done.</i>

1823
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:28,823
<i>You all right, man?</i>

1824
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:30,381
<i>Um, yeah, yeah. I'm all right.</i>

1825
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:32,017
<i>You're not all right.</i>
<i>You can't hardly breathe.</i>

1826
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:33,994
<i>You need a chest X-ray.</i>

1827
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:36,258
<i>I ain't trying to make no comeback.</i>

1828
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:37,924
<i>I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.</i>

1829
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,297
<i>That's the thanks I get</i>

1830
01:12:39,368 --> 01:12:40,630
<i>for pulling you out of that rat hole,</i>

1831
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,829
<i>just sitting there waiting to die...</i>

1832
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:43,496
<i>sitting there waiting to die...</i>

1833
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:45,130
- <i>die, die...</i>
- <i>It's too late.</i>

1834
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:46,868
<i>Is there a doctor in the house?</i>

1835
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:51,244
- Keep it short.
- <i>[ringing]</i>

1836
01:12:51,313 --> 01:12:52,746
- <i>[answering machine] Hey...</i>
- <i>Hello.</i>

1837
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:55,545
<i>It's Cleo. Please leave a message.</i>

1838
01:12:57,453 --> 01:12:58,613
[Beep]

1839
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:03,022
Cleo... um, this is, uh, Louis.

1840
01:13:03,092 --> 01:13:04,992
Louis Hinds.

1841
01:13:05,061 --> 01:13:06,426
Your father.

1842
01:13:06,495 --> 01:13:07,621
[Chuckle]

1843
01:13:07,697 --> 01:13:10,564
Wow, um,
feels funny saying that.

1844
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,794
I've, um, I've never said it before.

1845
01:13:12,868 --> 01:13:14,597
Um...

1846
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,137
Listen.

1847
01:13:16,205 --> 01:13:18,105
[Sigh]

1848
01:13:18,174 --> 01:13:20,369
I didn't mean what I said.

1849
01:13:20,443 --> 01:13:21,808
I was...

1850
01:13:24,814 --> 01:13:28,250
Odetta was the love of my life.

1851
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:30,114
The worst thing
that ever happened to me

1852
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:33,917
was losing her and you.

1853
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:35,320
But you turned out great.

1854
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:38,656
She did a wonderful job with you.

1855
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:41,492
You know your mother
was an amazing woman.

1856
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:43,088
And I just want you to know

1857
01:13:43,165 --> 01:13:48,228
I'm really, really glad I met you.

1858
01:13:48,304 --> 01:13:49,396
And I wish l...

1859
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:50,564
[beep]

1860
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:56,037
Yo.

1861
01:13:59,582 --> 01:14:00,981
All right.

1862
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:02,984
[Whistling]

1863
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:09,424
[Muttered chatter]

1864
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:12,222
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

1865
01:14:12,294 --> 01:14:13,226
- [Gun clicks]
- Hmm?

1866
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:14,785
Busting your ass out of jail.

1867
01:14:14,864 --> 01:14:17,094
What the fuck does it
look like I'm doing?

1868
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:18,497
Back up, Red. Get your keys out.

1869
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:19,556
Open that cell, okay?

1870
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:20,761
Deputy, don't listen to him.

1871
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:23,202
He will not shoot you.
Not on purpose anyway.

1872
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:25,740
Don't let him get you fucked up, Red.

1873
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:27,241
I'll kill you disco-dead.

1874
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:29,539
Now open that doggone cell, man.

1875
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:31,842
Stop shaking. If you shake,
I'm gonna start shaking.

1876
01:14:31,914 --> 01:14:33,211
Next thing you know, kapow!

1877
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:34,510
Go on in.

1878
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:35,641
Now hand him the keys.

1879
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:37,413
Hand them to him.

1880
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:38,919
- Okay?
- Floyd.

1881
01:14:38,988 --> 01:14:40,649
You sure you want to do this?

1882
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:43,191
Does everything gotta be
a fucking argument with you?

1883
01:14:43,259 --> 01:14:44,624
God damn! Come on out of there!

1884
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:46,593
Close the door, Lou. Lock it up.

1885
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:48,994
I'm a hostage.

1886
01:14:49,064 --> 01:14:50,463
You're gonna be a dead hostage

1887
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:51,659
if you don't shut the fuck up.

1888
01:14:51,734 --> 01:14:53,099
[Keys clatter on floor]

1889
01:14:53,169 --> 01:14:54,830
Now look here, Red.

1890
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:56,462
I like you, almost.

1891
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:59,440
You call anybody outside
your mama, kapow.

1892
01:14:59,508 --> 01:15:00,998
Okay?

1893
01:15:01,844 --> 01:15:03,175
Let's get out of here.

1894
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:07,046
[Floyd]
Anybody following us, man?

1895
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:08,174
Not yet.

1896
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,684
But you can bet your ass they will be.

1897
01:15:10,753 --> 01:15:11,947
Lou, we gotta dump
the Mothership, man.

1898
01:15:12,021 --> 01:15:13,181
We gotta dump it.

1899
01:15:13,255 --> 01:15:14,722
You'd abandon the Mothership?

1900
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,155
We're fugitives from the law.

1901
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:18,159
We gotta start thinking like it.

1902
01:15:18,227 --> 01:15:20,525
We're not fugitives, O.J.

1903
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:22,860
You're a fugitive. I'm a hostage.

1904
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:24,729
That's my story,
and I'm sticking to it.

1905
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,700
[Laughing]

1906
01:15:29,572 --> 01:15:30,630
Wait, wait, wait.

1907
01:15:30,706 --> 01:15:32,230
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

1908
01:15:32,308 --> 01:15:34,333
Look at that right there, man.

1909
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:36,674
Ain't that Lester's car?

1910
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,679
Motherfuckers.

1911
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:47,416
We're hungry, man. Come up with some
baked chicken or something.

1912
01:15:53,395 --> 01:15:54,362
They're at it again.

1913
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,990
[No audible dialogue]

1914
01:15:57,066 --> 01:15:58,533
[Honk honk]

1915
01:15:58,601 --> 01:16:01,092
Oh, shit! Lester's car!

1916
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:11,075
[Knocking]

1917
01:16:11,146 --> 01:16:13,046
- You hear that?
- What?

1918
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:14,673
[Knocking]

1919
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,342
That.

1920
01:16:16,418 --> 01:16:20,582
Oh, my God!
Oh, God, no! Oh, God...

1921
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,951
Mr. Hinds. Mr. Henderson.

1922
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:25,186
It's so good to see you.

1923
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:26,728
Oh, my God.

1924
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:30,231
Oh, it was so hot in there.
You have no idea.

1925
01:16:30,299 --> 01:16:32,290
If there's anything
I can get you,

1926
01:16:32,368 --> 01:16:34,427
like a latte, I'm here for you guys.

1927
01:16:34,503 --> 01:16:35,834
But first I really have to pee,

1928
01:16:35,905 --> 01:16:37,270
so I'm just gonna hop on out.

1929
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:39,239
If you could give me
a hand out of here.

1930
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:40,468
I've been locked in there,

1931
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:42,339
and they've had the woofers going all day.

1932
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:43,969
Oh, my God.

1933
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:46,412
I just have to pee real bad,
so if you don't mind.

1934
01:16:46,482 --> 01:16:47,540
It's so good to see you.

1935
01:16:47,616 --> 01:16:49,447
Oh, Mr. Hinds...

1936
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,991
Ahh...

Uh, that's my other line.

1960
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,592
I'll call you back. This is Danny.

1961
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:41,761
Hello, Mr. Epstein.

1962
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:44,499
<i>Phillip Newman.</i>
<i>I broke your stapler last week.</i>

1963
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:45,972
- Are you kidding me?
- <i>Hello?</i>

1964
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,269
Where the hell are you?

1965
01:17:47,343 --> 01:17:49,140
Listen, I called
because I just wanted to let you know

1966
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,679
that everything's cool,

1967

We?

1968
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:54,709
You're with Henderson and Hinds?

01:17:54,783 --> 01:17:55,807
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1970
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:57,374
They say "motherfucker" a lot,

1971

but they're really good guys.

1972
01:17:58,787 --> 01:18:00,277
All right, well, good.

1973
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:01,687
You can give them this message.

1974
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:03,486
The network just called,
and they're off the show.

1975
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:05,186
But they can't do that!

1976
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,989
Oh, really? It's VH1.

1977
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:08,495
Have you seen <i>Flava of Love?</i>

They can pretty much do
whatever they want.

1979
01:18:10,532 --> 01:18:12,727
And another thing, you're fired.

1980

Motherfucker! What the fuck?

1981
01:18:24,513 --> 01:18:25,343

1982
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:29,512
Uh, he said I'm fired,

1984

Are... Are you serious, man?

1985
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,725

You know, uh,
according to the map,

1990
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:35,911
that road leads to the turnpike.

1991
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:37,611
I think we've still got time to make it.

1992
01:19:37,686 --> 01:19:40,246
Make what, Louis?

1993
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:42,187
You heard what the motherfucker said!

1994
01:19:42,257 --> 01:19:43,315
It's over!

1995
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:44,825
Fuck that.

1996
01:19:48,964 --> 01:19:53,264
This shit ain't over till we
say it's over, all right?

1997
01:19:55,537 --> 01:19:56,936
Things have changed,

1998
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:01,066
and I have achieved
a state of mental clarity.

1999
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:02,371
Ain't that a bitch?

2000
01:20:02,444 --> 01:20:03,672
You hear what this motherfucker said?

2001
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:06,543
Ever since I knocked
on your door, man,

2002
01:20:06,615 --> 01:20:08,810
you've been beating my balls
at every fucking turn.

2003
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:12,547
Now all of a sudden, you've
got a state of clarity.

2004
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:14,350
Where was your clarity in L.A., Lou?

2005
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:15,913
You can't just dial that shit up

2006
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:18,255
like you calling for a pizza, motherfucker.

2007
01:20:18,327 --> 01:20:21,160
You got to go inside, do the work.

2008
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:23,824
Consequently,
I have a confession.

2009
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:29,601
Floyd, you were right about me.

2010
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:33,664
I have given up on a lot
of things in my life.

2011
01:20:33,742 --> 01:20:36,210
But I ain't giving up on this. All right?

2012
01:20:36,278 --> 01:20:40,078
Come on, man, we've been through
enough shit the last few days.

2013
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:41,548
We can do this.

2014
01:20:41,617 --> 01:20:44,347
And I dare anybody
to try to stop us.

2015
01:20:44,419 --> 01:20:46,387

Look at that.
That's nice and subtle.

2034
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:41,001

Okay. Thanks.

I thought I fired you.

I'm not alone.

Yeah, this is never going to happen.

Everybody knows, man.

2111
01:24:57,205 --> 01:24:59,537
My aunt was taking the same
doggone pills, man.

2112
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:02,270
Took her about a week
before she wasted away to nothing,

2113
01:25:02,344 --> 01:25:03,538
just kicking and screaming.

2114
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:04,977
I don't know what killed her ass,

2115
01:25:05,046 --> 01:25:08,345
but if she was taking those,
she had a bladder infection.

2116
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:09,543
Say what?

2117
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:12,781
Look, Doctor Dumbshit,
I got a kidney stone.

2118
01:25:12,854 --> 01:25:14,344
Hurts like a motherfucker
when I pee,

2119
01:25:14,423 --> 01:25:15,685
but it ain't gonna kill me.

2120
01:25:15,757 --> 01:25:16,951
So you're not dying?

2121
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:20,392
From the first slap and cry,
we all start to die.

2122
01:25:20,462 --> 01:25:23,124
But I ain't on no accelerated program,
hell, no.

2123
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:25,393
Ain't that about a bitch?

2124
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:28,334
All that damn hard work,
busting your ass out of jail,

2125
01:25:28,403 --> 01:25:29,563
and you ain't even dying.

2126
01:25:29,638 --> 01:25:31,003
I was kinda looking forward
to seeing you go.

2127
01:25:31,072 --> 01:25:33,267
Excuse me, Danny.
They're on in two.

2128
01:25:33,341 --> 01:25:34,933
All right. Where we at, guys?

2129
01:25:36,144 --> 01:25:37,839
Okay, I'm good.

2130
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,308
The Apollo, the mecca.

2131
01:25:43,385 --> 01:25:44,784
This brings back memories, man.

2132
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:46,480
How many times you think
we've performed here?

2133
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:47,749
Ooh, uh...

2134
01:25:47,823 --> 01:25:49,120
ooh, five-oh.

2135
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,158
50, really?

2136
01:25:50,225 --> 01:25:51,590
- Five-oh.
- Oh!

2137
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,820
Come on. Move, move.

2138
01:25:52,894 --> 01:25:54,657
That's them! Hold it! Hold it!

2139
01:25:54,729 --> 01:25:56,993
<i>[Police radio]</i>
<i>All units report, all units report.</i>

2140
01:25:57,065 --> 01:25:58,464
<i>Suspects have been spotted.</i>

2141
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:01,502
<i>All units, apprehend them quietly</i>
<i>and by the book.</i>

2142
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:04,839
Hey, Lou, do you think
they're gone, man?

2143
01:26:04,906 --> 01:26:06,430
I don't have X-ray vision, motherfucker!

2144
01:26:06,508 --> 01:26:07,532
How would I know?

2145
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:09,839
Lower your voice, Lou.
Doggone it, man.

2146
01:26:09,911 --> 01:26:11,742
It's so dark in here you can't see shit.

2147
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:13,041
Hold up.

2148
01:26:13,114 --> 01:26:14,547
Let me see if I can reach my lighter.

2149
01:26:14,616 --> 01:26:15,742
Don't light no lighter
up in here, man.

2150
01:26:15,817 --> 01:26:17,307
We'll blow up like a barbecue.

2151
01:26:17,385 --> 01:26:18,977
Hold on one minute.

2152
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:20,749
Shit.

2153
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:24,425
[Chuckle]

2154
01:26:24,493 --> 01:26:27,519
Marcus motherfucking Hooks.

2155
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:29,996
Long way from Linwood Street, huh,
motherfucker?

2156
01:26:30,065 --> 01:26:32,397
Fuck Linwood Street and him.

2157
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:34,401
He used both of us, and you know it.

2158
01:26:34,469 --> 01:26:37,063
Come on, man. He just thought
he'd be a bigger star going solo.

2159
01:26:37,138 --> 01:26:38,127
He was right.

2160
01:26:38,206 --> 01:26:39,468
No he wasn't.

2161
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:41,202
He didn't want to split
the money three ways.

2162
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:42,402
Just look at him, sitting there

2163
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:44,536
with that old shit-eating
grin on his face.

2164
01:26:44,613 --> 01:26:47,104
You think you're all that, motherfucker,
don't you?

2165
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:49,013
I have to admit, every time
I think about you,

2166
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:51,348
I could just choke the shit out of you!

2167
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:52,545
Stop it, stop it!

2168
01:26:52,621 --> 01:26:54,452
Floyd, he ain't
thinking shit. He's dead.

2169
01:26:57,092 --> 01:27:00,152
Say, ain't that my watch?

2170
01:27:00,228 --> 01:27:02,219
See? You thought
I stole that mother...

2171
01:27:02,297 --> 01:27:04,322
I told you this motherfucker
was a klepto!

2172
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:05,764
Shit, look at that.

2173
01:27:05,834 --> 01:27:07,199
That's nice.

2174
01:27:07,269 --> 01:27:08,361
Probably stole that, too.

2175
01:27:08,436 --> 01:27:10,700
Motherfucker always had
good taste, though.

2176
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:12,103
I'm gonna keep this.

2177
01:27:16,745 --> 01:27:18,576
Hey, Louis.

2178
01:27:18,647 --> 01:27:20,842
You think if, you know...

2179
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,884
if he wouldn't have, you know, died,

2180
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:24,248
you think we would have
got back together?

2181
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:25,911
Oh, hell, no.

2182
01:27:25,987 --> 01:27:27,818
But you know what?

2183
01:27:27,889 --> 01:27:28,947
We are together,

2184
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:31,083
and I've been thinking
about our little arrangement.

2185
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:32,148
I'm gonna go ahead

2186
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:35,355
and break you off 50/50, all right?

2187
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:37,022
Wow, Lou, that's...

2188
01:27:37,098 --> 01:27:39,760
that's real black of you, man.

2189
01:27:39,834 --> 01:27:41,461
Because there ain't no money.

2190
01:27:41,536 --> 01:27:42,560
Say what?

2191
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:44,605
Well, you said it yourself.

2192
01:27:44,673 --> 01:27:45,662
It's a funeral.

2193
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,900
Nobody pays you to sing, man.

2194
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:48,374
You lied about the money?

2195
01:27:48,443 --> 01:27:50,377
- Yeah.
- You motherfucker.

2196
01:27:50,445 --> 01:27:52,310
Hey, you can't say
it wasn't worth it.

2197
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,245
Well, I could say it.

2198
01:27:56,117 --> 01:27:57,914
But I'd be lying.

2199
01:27:57,986 --> 01:27:59,647
[Laughing]
I love you, Lou.

2200
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:01,814
My nigger.

2201
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:03,915
But this motherfucker,
you know, I can't help it.

2202
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:06,085
Every time,
I could just kill this motherfucker!

2203
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:08,129
That's why he left, because
you was always picking on him.

2204
01:28:08,196 --> 01:28:09,254
Stop fucking with him.

2205
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:11,231
He fucked with my happiness.

2206
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:14,234
[Applause]

2207
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:21,870
Ladies and gentlemen,

2208
01:28:21,943 --> 01:28:24,411
I'm Isaac Hayes.

2209
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:26,174
[Cheering, applause]

2210
01:28:26,247 --> 01:28:28,238
Where the fuck are they, Danny?

2211
01:28:28,316 --> 01:28:31,342
[Lsaac Hayes]
My good friends, please join me

2212
01:28:31,419 --> 01:28:35,185
in saying farewell
to brother Marcus Hooks.

2213
01:28:37,792 --> 01:28:39,817
[Audience gasps]

2214
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:42,561
[Woman]
It's Louis and Floyd!

2215
01:28:42,631 --> 01:28:43,757
It's the Real Deal!

2216
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:46,824
Oh!

2217
01:28:46,901 --> 01:28:49,699
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal,

2218
01:28:49,771 --> 01:28:51,500
back together again.

2219
01:28:51,573 --> 01:28:52,733
Give them a hand.

2220
01:28:52,807 --> 01:28:54,502
Give them a hand.

2221
01:28:54,576 --> 01:28:57,477
Reunited, y'all.

2222
01:28:57,545 --> 01:28:58,944
They got their shit together.

2223
01:28:59,014 --> 01:29:01,847
Yes! Let's go!

2224
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:03,747
Stand by.
Move in on my command.

2225
01:29:03,818 --> 01:29:05,285
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2226
01:29:05,353 --> 01:29:07,014
Come on, Officer
detective person.

2227
01:29:07,088 --> 01:29:08,350
Please, just, you know, come on.

2228
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:10,288
Let them sing one song.
One little song.

2229
01:29:10,358 --> 01:29:12,019
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

2230
01:29:12,093 --> 01:29:13,720
[Hayes]
The Real Deal!

2231
01:29:15,997 --> 01:29:19,057
All right. One song.

2232
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:21,034
But it better be good.

2233
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:25,062
One song. The good one.

2234
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:30,804
How's that hip?

2235
01:29:30,879 --> 01:29:31,971
Locked and loaded, baby.

2236
01:29:32,047 --> 01:29:33,309
Let's do this.

2237
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:36,444
Band!

2238
01:29:36,518 --> 01:29:38,509
Let's take a walk in the park.

2239
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:40,884
1, 2, 3, 4!

2240
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:54,595
Oh, yeah

2241
01:29:54,669 --> 01:29:57,035
When the river gets to rollin'

2242
01:29:57,105 --> 01:30:00,734
And then you add
a bowlful of soul in

2243
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:04,074
And then I tried
to let it all go then

2244
01:30:04,145 --> 01:30:05,806
Oh, yeah

2245
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,007
Oh, it's easy to me

2246
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:11,450
You see, the way
I ride the rhythm

2247
01:30:11,519 --> 01:30:15,080
You see, the truth
is all I can give 'em

2248
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:17,852
And the lyrics can
come from livin'

2249
01:30:17,926 --> 01:30:21,623
Oh, yeah, oh, it's easy to me

2250
01:30:21,696 --> 01:30:23,391
Oh, yeah

2251
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:27,424
Music comes out of my heart

2252
01:30:27,502 --> 01:30:31,461
Something like a walking the park

2253
01:30:31,539 --> 01:30:34,599
It's just a walk in the park

2254
01:30:34,676 --> 01:30:36,473
Oh, yeah

2255
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:39,274
And no one else in here, I heard it

2256
01:30:39,347 --> 01:30:42,976
I don't know what I've
done to deserve it

2257
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:46,646
You don't question it
while you serve it

2258
01:30:46,721 --> 01:30:47,983
Oh, yeah

2259
01:30:48,056 --> 01:30:50,047
Oh, it was given to me

2260
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:53,652
I got something you inherit

2261
01:30:53,728 --> 01:30:56,754
I don't know that you
was born to share it

2262
01:30:56,831 --> 01:31:00,767
And if you shoot,
be sure you wear it

2263
01:31:00,835 --> 01:31:02,769
Oh, yeah

2264
01:31:02,837 --> 01:31:04,168
Oh, it comes naturally to me

2265
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:06,469
Uh-huh-uh

2266
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,634
Music comes out of my heart

2267
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:10,177
Yeah

2268
01:31:10,245 --> 01:31:13,840
Something like a walk in the park

2269
01:31:13,915 --> 01:31:15,906
It's just a walk in the park

2270
01:31:15,984 --> 01:31:16,951
Oh, yeah

2271
01:31:17,018 --> 01:31:18,849
Oh, yeah

2272
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,650
Oh, yeah!

2273
01:31:21,723 --> 01:31:23,782
Y'all having a good time
out here tonight?

2274
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:25,883
This is what I'm talking about!

2275
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:28,121
You know about that
walk in the park, man?

2276
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:29,686
Sure I know about
that walk in the park.

2277
01:31:29,764 --> 01:31:31,254
You do? I'll tell you what.

2278
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:33,095
- Show them.
- Got to get down.

2279
01:31:34,803 --> 01:31:37,397
[Audience cheering]

2280
01:31:40,909 --> 01:31:42,103
Ladies and gentlemen,

2281
01:31:42,177 --> 01:31:44,168
let's give a big Apollo welcome

2282
01:31:44,245 --> 01:31:46,145
to the stage for the first time,

2283
01:31:46,214 --> 01:31:50,344
my daughter, Miss Cleo Whitfield!

2284
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:54,013
To make something out of nothin'

2285
01:31:54,088 --> 01:31:57,524
That's what we all
got in common

2286
01:31:57,592 --> 01:32:01,119
So just hold on tight, I'm comin'

2287
01:32:01,196 --> 01:32:03,130
Oh, yeah, yeah

2288
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:04,631
Said to me

2289
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:07,862
I'll give you something
you can believe in

2290
01:32:07,936 --> 01:32:11,702
And then enjoy yourself
this evenin'

2291
01:32:11,773 --> 01:32:15,004
And don't you dare
think about leavin'

2292
01:32:15,076 --> 01:32:16,873
Oh, yeah

2293
01:32:16,945 --> 01:32:20,779
Sing along with me

2294
01:32:20,849 --> 01:32:24,376
Music comes out of my heart

2295
01:32:24,452 --> 01:32:26,852
Something like a walk
in the park

2296
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:28,081
It's just a walk in the park

2297
01:32:28,156 --> 01:32:30,181
It's just a walk in the park

2298
01:32:30,258 --> 01:32:31,850
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

2299
01:32:31,926 --> 01:32:33,518
Oh, yeah

2300
01:32:35,029 --> 01:32:37,862
Music comes out of my heart

2301
01:32:37,932 --> 01:32:42,301
Something like a walk
in the park

2302
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:45,168
It's just a walk in the park

2303
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,504
Oh, yeah

2304
01:32:49,277 --> 01:32:51,973
Music comes out of my heart

2305
01:32:52,046 --> 01:32:53,479
One song.

2306
01:32:53,548 --> 01:32:55,641
Something like a walk in the park

2307
01:32:55,717 --> 01:32:57,014
A walk in the park

2308
01:32:57,085 --> 01:32:59,053
It's just a walk in the park

2309
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,382
A walk in the park

2310
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:02,423
Oh, yeah

2311
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:05,015
Music comes out of my heart

2312
01:33:05,093 --> 01:33:07,152
I'm their manager!

2313
01:33:07,228 --> 01:33:09,321
Something like a walk in the park

2314
01:33:09,397 --> 01:33:11,160
Walk in the park

2315
01:33:11,232 --> 01:33:12,426
It's just a walk in the park

2316
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:18,564
Just like a walk in the park

2317
01:33:20,808 --> 01:33:24,039
Oh, yeah

2318
01:33:38,459 --> 01:33:39,721
Whoo!

2319
01:33:39,794 --> 01:33:41,694
[Sobbing]

2320
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,403
<i>Yeah, ooh, yeah</i>

2321
01:33:55,476 --> 01:33:57,706
<i>[Motown]</i>

2322
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,128
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo

2323
01:34:14,195 --> 01:34:15,253
Haah

2324
01:34:15,330 --> 01:34:17,025
You're gonna sing real nice tonight.

2325
01:34:19,133 --> 01:34:20,191
<i>All right, y'all.</i>

2326
01:34:20,268 --> 01:34:22,964
<i>Got that funky time</i>

2327
01:34:23,037 --> 01:34:26,097
<i>I can feel it</i>

2328
01:34:26,174 --> 01:34:29,701
<i>I can feel it</i>

2329
01:34:29,777 --> 01:34:31,642
<i>I can feel it</i>

2330
01:34:33,281 --> 01:34:35,647
Any time the camera
or the mic comes on,

2331
01:34:35,717 --> 01:34:37,150
I don't cheat myself.

2332
01:34:37,218 --> 01:34:39,618
That was rule number 1
I was taught as a kid.

2333
01:34:39,687 --> 01:34:41,484
And I definitely can't
cheat the audience.

2334
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:43,353
So I give 150%% %

2335
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:46,518
every single time that I do anything.

2336
01:34:46,594 --> 01:34:48,357
Even the way I live my life.

2337
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:51,296
I just cherish
each doggone moment.

2338
01:34:51,366 --> 01:34:53,891
A black preacher's
something else, ain't it?

2339
01:34:53,968 --> 01:34:56,994
You can't pay your rent
after you come from church.

2340
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,974
And if you ask the preacher
for the $5.00,

2341
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:04,034
he'll be like, "Fuck you
in the name of Jesus."

2342
01:35:04,112 --> 01:35:06,876
My comedy is not fictitious.

2343
01:35:06,948 --> 01:35:10,213
My comedy has
to come from my heart.

2344
01:35:10,284 --> 01:35:12,844
[Clapping in rhythm]

2345
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:15,616
- Charlie Chan was a hell of a man.
- All right, let's rehearse.

2346
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:18,215
He went through China
with his shit in his hand.

2347
01:35:18,292 --> 01:35:20,783
Had five women against the wall.

2348
01:35:20,862 --> 01:35:23,592
I betcha five dollars
that he fucked them all.

2349
01:35:23,664 --> 01:35:24,961
He fucked them hard.

2350
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:26,159
He fucked them long.

2351
01:35:26,234 --> 01:35:28,794
He fucked them till his shit got sore.

2352
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:31,338
He went to the doctor,
and the doctor said,

2353
01:35:31,406 --> 01:35:33,738
"Sorry, Charlie, your dick is dead."

2354
01:35:33,808 --> 01:35:36,641
He said, "Doctor, Doctor,
that can't be true."

2355
01:35:36,711 --> 01:35:39,339
"Yes, sir, Charlie,
your balls are too!"

2356
01:35:41,182 --> 01:35:42,945
I've been performing all my life.

2357
01:35:43,017 --> 01:35:44,678
So being in front of an audience

2358
01:35:44,752 --> 01:35:46,379
has never been a problem for me.

2359
01:35:46,454 --> 01:35:48,285
It's time to go?

2360
01:35:49,223 --> 01:35:50,588
Well, go on, then.

2361
01:35:50,658 --> 01:35:53,422
[Laughter, applause]

2362
01:35:53,494 --> 01:35:56,258
You want to leave a lasting impression
on your audience.

2363
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,890
You know, and that's something
I was taught, too,

2364
01:35:58,966 --> 01:36:00,263
when I first started.

2365
01:36:00,334 --> 01:36:01,562
Always make them remember you,

2366
01:36:01,636 --> 01:36:04,434
or remember something
about you and the film.

2367
01:36:04,505 --> 01:36:08,134
I'm going back to my
$600-a-night hotel room,

2368
01:36:08,209 --> 01:36:13,146
have me a nice-ass, uh,
piece of pussy and shit.

2369
01:36:13,214 --> 01:36:14,272
Okay?

2370
01:36:14,348 --> 01:36:16,407
Cut it.

2371
01:36:16,484 --> 01:36:18,111
[Screaming]

2372
01:36:18,186 --> 01:36:19,278
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.

2373
01:36:19,353 --> 01:36:21,378
I'm not even in yet.

2374
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:23,549
I got to boogie for you

2375
01:36:23,624 --> 01:36:25,592
I got to boogie for you

2376
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:27,924
I got nothin' but boogie

2377
01:36:27,995 --> 01:36:30,293
Nothin' but boogie for you

2378
01:36:30,364 --> 01:36:32,264
I got nothin' but boogie

2379
01:36:32,333 --> 01:36:33,960
Nothin' but boogie for you

2380
01:36:34,035 --> 01:36:35,764
Boogie, boogie

2387
01:36:44,745 --> 01:36:47,475
I want to say thanks to you all

2388
01:36:47,548 --> 01:36:51,279
because you all made me... yeah.

2389
01:36:55,456 --> 01:36:58,254
I wouldn't have
no TV show or movies.

2390
01:36:58,326 --> 01:37:00,191
You all was coming to see me,

2391
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:01,922
and you all made me...

2392
01:37:01,996 --> 01:37:04,931
Chattanooga, Louisiana, Mississippi.

2393

[Cheering]

2394
01:37:06,134 --> 01:37:08,125
So thank you.

2395
01:37:08,202 --> 01:37:10,762
I think if I had a few free passes

2396
01:37:10,838 --> 01:37:12,135
like a lot of people,

2397
01:37:12,206 --> 01:37:14,697
I don't think I would be
as successful as I have.

2398
01:37:14,775 --> 01:37:16,436
My task here on Earth

2399
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:19,639
is I have to work harder
than the average bear.

2400
01:37:19,714 --> 01:37:20,646
It look easy, don't it?

2401
01:37:20,715 --> 01:37:23,513

But it's not.

2402
01:37:23,584 --> 01:37:26,109
