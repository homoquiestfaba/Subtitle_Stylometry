00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,746
Welcome back, KLDA listeners.

15
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:52,117
I'm Emily Harris and you're
listening to "Ask Emily."

16
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,952
Oh, it looks like we have time

17
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:57,723
for one more sad Christmas
caller who needs my help.

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,426
Hi, you're on the line
with Emily.

19
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,895
What's your name,
and what's your problem?

20
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,530
<i>Uh, hi.</i>

21
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,199
<i>My name is Greg and I have
sort of an awkward question.</i>

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,567
Awkward.

23
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,036
Mm, that's my specialty.
Lay it on me.

26
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,576
<i>Do I correct them?
</i>- Yes, you correct them!

27
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,412
Also, real quick,
if the holidays isn't the time

28
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,880
to get a little
passive-aggressive,

29
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,982
then I don't know when is.

30
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,051
Greg, here's what
you're gonna do.

31
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,486
You're going to go out
and get yourself

32
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,756
a custom Christmas sweater
with your actual name,

33
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,392

00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,528
Can I write,

36
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,863

37
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,998

38
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,901

00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,104
- Uh... one, test, test.
- Who's this?

41
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,140
Uh, that's the new intern,

42
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,675

00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,943

Yeah, whatever.

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,335
for your favorite Christmas
tradition, "Dear Santa."

55
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,203
I mean, it's my last week.

56
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,205
Okay?
I can do what I want.

57
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,309
Ugh, only four more days
of this song.

58
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,479
Well, there'll be
no avoiding tonight,

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,882
because tonight's the big night.

60
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,283
Yeah.

61
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,385
Em, you know
Ken is deciding tonight

62
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,487
on who's taking over his slot,
okay?

63
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,989
You got to strap
on your boss pants

64
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,725
and pitch him "Ask Emily"
tonight at the Christmas party.

65
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,693
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

66
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,894
He's never gonna know that you

67
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:42,862
want to be a DJ
unless you tell him.

68
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,062
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

69
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,465
Okay.
So what's your plan?

70
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, I was hoping you would ask.

71
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,603
So my plan is to keep
all my wishes to myself,

72
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,306
so I'm never embarrassed
or disappointed.

73
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,574
See you tonight, coward.

74
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,975
And don't forget
to wear your sparkly dress.

75
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,479
I would never forget
to wear my sparkly dress.

76
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,062
No.

77
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,194
You gave the kid
a LEGO Tokyo Skyline.

78
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,495
Uh, yeah.

79
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,064
He asked for a scooter!

80
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,033
Okay, I did that kid a favor,
all right?

81
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,569
And if he had any taste,
he would know that.

82
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,171
Do you know
how many complaint letters

83
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,006
we've gotten about you?

84
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,842
You know how the big man
feels about being selfish.

85
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,646
He is not happy,
so here's what we're gonna do.

86
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,481
We are assigning you
to the Lost Souls Department.

87
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,483
No! Lost Souls?

88
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,518
Nah, nah, nah, I'm not good
with talking with people.

89
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,886
Mm, you don't say.

90
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,388
No, I don't like
people like that, okay?

91
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,489
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- I can't... I can't do it.

92
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,024
So here's what you're gonna do.

93
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,959
You are going to work with,
listen to,

94
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,128
and actually help
your assigned human,

95
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,731
and learn not to be so selfish.

96
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,034
Or you are getting reassigned
to work for...

97
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,841

00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,763
I had a dry cleaning emergency.

wearing that crown?

00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,877
Why is that, Janice?

170
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:29,748
Because you're the queen
of kissing Ken's ass?

171
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,951
It's obvious Ken's gonna
name me his replacement.

Okay, we all know how
you got your job, Janice.

Oh, good one.

175
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:46,731

I get everything I want, okay?

176
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,400

00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,402
I like the zipper.
It's cute.

178
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,470
Ugh.

179
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,805
No, I know, I know, I know.

180
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,473
I'm gonna ask Ken.
I will.

181
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,108
I'm gonna ask him, but, like...

182
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,810
Look, for now let's just
concentrate on getting

183
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,078
really drunk, really fast.

184
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,379
Yes, oh, yes.
Right here.

185
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,414
- Focus on that.
- Hi.

186
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,616
Hey, hi.

187
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,485
- Ah!
- And to boobs.

188
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,791
Both: Ugh!

189
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,659
It's in the throat,
you know what I mean?

190
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,895
Just like, mm.

191
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:17,830
OMG.

192
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,164
It's the hot IT guy.

193
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,899
He's standing there
at the buffet.

194
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,467
Alone.

195
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,602
Hey!

196
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,004
Not for long.
Hold this.

197
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,844
Hey.

198
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,013
Emily!
Fun party.

199
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,816
Thank you, you look...
Oh, you didn't say...

200
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,685
- What?
- Nice sweater.

201
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,587
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

202
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:46,057
I... uh-oh, mistletoe.

203
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,325
Hmm.

204
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,662
You know, maybe we should...

205
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,898
Uh, do you... you don't
have a cat, right?

206
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,701
Because cats are allergic
to mistletoe, so...

207
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,803
Stay alert, stay alive.

208
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,806
Bye!
Bye.

209
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,791
Come on, Emily, spit it out.
Just say it.

210
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,461
You say something?

211
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,998
Ken, I was, um...

212
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,968
It's just that I know that...

213
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,004
Ken, what I want you to...

214
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,874
I've had to pee all night,
you know?

215
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,311
Good to know.

216
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,718
- Hey, what happened?
- I don't know.

217
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,053
I don't know what happened.

218
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,989
I just... like,
how do people do this?

219
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,692
Like, I know I'm supposed
to ask Ken for the on air job,

220
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,093
and I choked.

221
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,195
And I know I'm supposed
to try to make out

222
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,730
with the hottie
under the mistletoe,

223
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,298
and I choked at that too.

224
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,033
And it just feels like
all of my words get stuck

225
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,836
in my throat, and I can't...

226
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,404
Like, what do you do...
How do you do...

227
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,006
How does anyone do any of this?

228
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,975
I just feel like every single
thing I do is so wrong.

229
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,944
Hey, um, can I have
a nogtini, please?

230
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,647
Sorry.
That guy got the last of them.

231
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,516
Love nogtinis.

232
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,786
Gosh.
Cheers.

233
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:27,592
That butt-kissing Janice
got my nogtini?

234
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,728
She ain't getting my job.
Not at all.

235
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,062
I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna...

236
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,731
I'm gonna demand it, and I'm...

237
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,266
I'm... here I go.

238
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,071
Emily, you're
still standing here.

239
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,439
My feet.

240
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,807
All right, let's do this.

241
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,876
Okay everyone, hey, come on.

242
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,145
Gather round, gather round.
Listen up.

243
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,382
So I was gonna do this
after the holiday,

244
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,417
but hell, it's Christmas.

245
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,787
Anyway, we figured out
who's gonna replace me.

246
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,188
It's gonna be Janice.

247
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,857
As you can imagine,
the choice was clear.

248
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,859
So get ready

249
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,695
for "The Dish with Janice"!

250
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,863
There you go!

251
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,164
Let's dance.

252
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,466
Here we go.

253
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,602
- Boo!
- Boo.

254
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,671
I already hate your show.

255
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,040
You're the only one not dancing.

256
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,708
Where's your Christmas spirit?

257
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,643
Santa, mind your business, okay?

258
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,613
Also, you have never brought me
anything I've ever asked for.

259
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,282
Well, why don't you put it
in a letter then, drunky?

260
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,586
Oh, you gonna go with him.

261
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,088
Real supportive.

262
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,557
Hey, can you, um...
Can you give me something

263
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,527
to make me forget tonight?

264
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,828
Try that.

265
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,563
Thank you, but keep them coming.

266
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,832
- You got it.
- Mm, mm.

267
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,033
Yeah.

268
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,937
- Pure elf's blood.
- Oh, mm.

269
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,673
Nah, you acting shy.

270
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,543
One and two, and, and...

271
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,013
And do the step.

272
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:59,117
Look at the babies.

273
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,952
Hi!

274
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,688
Merry Christmas!

275
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,090
What are you doing?

276
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,624
You guys writing your letters?

277
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,427
About your hopes,
and your dreams,

278
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,529
and your Christmas wishes, and...

279
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,599
Ooh, Santa's gonna
deliver my Christmas wishes.

280
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,568
Lies, children!

281
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,236
Ma'am, please.

282
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,238
Lies!
They need to know.

283
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,207
Santa doesn't
grant you anything.

284
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,476
He didn't grant me my job,
and I want to... look at her!

285
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,344
She got my job.

286
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,313
How'd they get that up so quick?

287
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,650
And I didn't even get
to make out with the IT guy!

288
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,186
When's the last time
you make out with somebody, hm?

289
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,688
You can't be here without kids.

290
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,356
Oh!

291
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,692
All of a sudden,
I ain't got a kid.

292
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,193
I can't have a baby?

293
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,662
I have a child, and his name...

294
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,297
It's Timothy.

295
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,166
- You're drunk.
- You're drunk!

296
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,002
And his name is Thomas,
and he would

297
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,404
really appreciate...
So I'm gonna go ahead

298
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,173
and I'm gonna get...
Excuse me?

299
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,610
Sis, I will not.
That way!

300
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,446
Ma'am, no, ma'am!

301
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,882
Excuse me!

302
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,216
Rude.

303
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,986
Okay, you got your letter.

304
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,054
Thank you.

305
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,924
Merry Christmas.

306
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:18,063
For Timmy!
For Timmy!

307
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,375
Okay, Santa.

308
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,212
Let's see how magical
this mofo really is.

309
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,047
Dear

310
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:40,552
ugly asshole.

311
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,788
JK, JK.

312
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:47,892
Dear Santa Claus,

313
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,495
I know it's been a while
since we spoke

314
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,098
because I don't believe in you
because I'm an adult.

315
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:59,737
However, um,
you still be granting wishes?

316
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,172
<i>'Cause here are mine.</i>

317
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,807
All right,
come on, it's for kids.

318
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,110
Let's go, let's go.

319
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,984
Santa needs to grant me wishes!

320
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,953
Ma'am, no.

321
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,856
Ma'am, no!
It's for Timmy!

322
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,046
Hey, boss.
I got a good one for you.

323
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,882
Okay.

324
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,851
Let's see.

325
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,420
Oh, nogtinis, yes.

326
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,423
Oh!
This is a toughie.

327
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,527
Her Christmas spirit
is in the basement.

328
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,896
I think I know
just the right elf

329
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,598
for this assignment.

330
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,904
This is the guy.

331
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,876
Boris, I did it.

332
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,246
I did it.

333
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,517
Okay.

334
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,019
All right.

335
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,688
Goodnight, Boris.

336
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:28,159
Maybe this Christmas
won't be so bad after all.

337
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,263
Get off of me.

338
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,146
Second best?

339
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:52,216
Hm, Oprah?

340
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,119
You are enough?

341
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,622
<i>Emily, breakfast!</i>

342
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,590
<i>Get a move on.
We have a lot to talk about.</i>

343
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,259
Is that my mom?

344
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,197
<i>Wish number one, I want to be
actually close to my mom.</i>

345
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,870
<i>♪ Hark,
the herald angels... ♪</i>

346
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,672
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, handsome.

347
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,713
<i>♪ Peace on Earth
and mercy mild ♪</i>

348
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:25,016
<i>♪ God and sinners

349
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,719
<i>♪ Joyful all ye nations rise ♪</i>

350
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,887
Mom?

351
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,890
Dad?
Why am I here?

352
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,093
Oh!
Good afternoon.

353
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,062
I see someone overslept again.

354
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,897
Um...

355
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,232
How fast can you eat?

356
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,067
Because we have
a million things to do.

357
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,536
And what are you wearing?
Oh, ugh!

358
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,872
You're gonna go up
and change, right?

359
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,907
Okay, I'm sorry, when did...

360
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,411
In an hour, I told you!

361
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,484
The annual tree
decorating contest?

362
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,753
Big parties?

363
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,388
In three days?

364
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,057
We have to go and get
the fireplace garland!

365
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,494
Oh, oh!
Honestly, Emily!

366
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,797
Okay, I just meant,
when did I get here?

367
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,700
I didn't... did I
drive here last night?

368
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,235
Oh, I am going to jail.

369
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,137
I don't understand
your sense of humor.

370
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,572
Here, here.
Drink your nogtini, okay?

371
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,942
<i>Wish number two, I want
all the nogtinis ever.</i>

372
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:29,313
Go up, change into
something flattering, please!

373
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,149
And then let's scoot!

374
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,584
Oh, all right.

375
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,952
I don't know
what's happening here,

376
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,388
but I need to get back
to my show... oh, my God,

377
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,556
do I still have that job?

378
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,625
Show?
What is she talking about?

379
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,360
I have no idea.

380
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,861
The Rockettes or something?

381
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,029
Rockettes?

382
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,964
Oh, God, finally.

383
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,066
You know, he is so late.

384
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,835
He is 12 minutes late!

385
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,069
The liquor for the party!

386
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,405
Okay, what is happening here?

387
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,707
Hi, ma'am.
Where would you like these?

388
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,943
- You're late.
- I'm sorry about that.

389
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,411
We're a little backed up.

390
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,079
Christmas parties and all that.
Fine, over there.

391
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,116
Okay.

392
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,224
- Hi.
- Hi.

393
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,760
I don't live here.

394
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,596
Cool, I don't either.

395
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,066
Yep, here we go.
Ah!

396
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,802
Careful!
Those are my snowmen!

397
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,003
All right.

398
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,338
They're heirlooms!

399
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,173
Thank you for your business,

400
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,376
and sorry again for the delay.

401
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,615
Merry Christmas.

402
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,520
Okay.

403
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,721
Men!

404
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:47,391
Never trust a man
with a winning smile.

405
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,627
Your daddy ain't got one.

406
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,096
Zoom, zoom.

407
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,331
Don't you start.

408
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,765
Oh, no, no, no, no.

409
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,435
Absolutely not.
I'm not dealing with this.

410
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,669
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm not going to look

411
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,638
at any fireplace garland
or anything.

412
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,473
I'm just gonna...

413
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,075
Merry Christmas, y'all.

414
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,943
- Emily.
- See you.

415
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,412
What?
She... oh!

416
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,248
How could she?

417
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,285
<i>♪ Hark, the herald sing ♪</i>

418
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,241
That's what I thought.

419
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:47,377
What's up?

420
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:48,612
No, because you've
been following me.

421
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:50,147
What's up?
What you want?

422
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,349
I'm trying to sort out
how much of a pain in my ass

423
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,218
you're gonna be.

424
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:56,520
I'm sorry, who are you?

425
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:58,488
I'm an elf.
Wolf.

426
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,057
You're a wolf?
You're an elf?

427
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:01,491
What is this?
What are you talking about?

428
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,859
No, no... oh.
I'm an elf.

429
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,761
My name is Wolf.

430
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,263
Cool, Wolf elf.

431
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:07,831
Here's what I'm gonna do.

432
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,901
I'm going to mind my business
back to the city by myself.

433
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:13,003
I suggest you stay here.
Okay, but look.

434
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,164
Your apartment's not gonna
be there when you get there.

435
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:22,946
You're still drunk.

436
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:25,449
I'm still drunk.
I get what's happening here.

437
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,350
But still, your apartment's
not gon' be there, okay?

438
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,518
Because this isn't your life.

439
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,554
I mean, technically it is.

440
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:32,723
But... this part is
always hard to explain.

441
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:35,226
Okay, look, you know that
letter you wrote to Santa?

442
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:39,196
All your wishes are coming true.

443
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,665
Okay.
You're a crazy person.

444
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,102
That's clear.
There's a... hello?

445
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:47,771
Help?

446
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,606
Damn it, nobody here no more?

447
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:52,109
Elf guy talking to me.
You know what, go ahead.

448
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,543
See for yourself, all right?

449
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,612
But don't be surprised
by all the magical crap.

450
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:57,214
Go on.
Okay.

451
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,316
I want some help
for you, brother.

452
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:01,418
Let me get in here.

453
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,653
Don't... you stay there.
Okay.

454
00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:05,590
Okay.

455
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:21,738
"Woman crushed to death

456
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,208
in freak reindeer
leaping accident."

457
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:30,413
Wish number three, I wish Janice

458
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:35,652
would take a flying leap.

459
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:39,523
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

460
00:21:39,524 --> 00:21:41,925
Can I have this for free?
She's my best friend.

461
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,362
Thank you.
No.

462
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,932
Okay.

463
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:55,338
That's it.
That's it.

464
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:56,673
Oh, come on.

465
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:58,975
This is not happening.
This is not happening.

466
00:21:58,976 --> 00:22:00,143
Come on!

467
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,545
Yo!

468
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:03,648
You got the wrong
apartment, lady.

469
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:06,249
Is this 5C?

470
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,418
- Yeah.
- And you live here?

471
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,253
Yeah.
Can I help you?

472
00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:12,756
Cool, cool, no.
Don't panic.

473
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:15,625
Hey, um, is there a cat in here?

474
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,862
His name is Boris,
and he's insightful and fluffy.

475
00:22:18,863 --> 00:22:20,831
- I'm vegan.
- Oh, but we don't eat him.

476
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:23,768
He's for loving.
Boris? Okay.

477
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:28,605
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

478
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:29,973
What is happening?

479
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,508
This can't be real.
It's not real.

480
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:33,176
Is it? Is it?

481
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,478
Wait, am I crazy?

482
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,048
Oh, God, did I kill someone?

483
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:41,585
Oh, no, do I have to spend
Christmas with my mom?

484
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,221
<i>Did you say kill?</i>

485
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:49,759
You wanna tell me what
the hell is going on here?

486
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,595
It's what I was
trying to tell you, okay?

487
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:54,264
You remember wandering
up in here last night?

488
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,099
Dear Santa Claus.

489
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,401
Job stealing bitch!

490
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:00,303
Lies, children!

491
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:03,039
There's nothing
in this but lies!

492
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,374
Ma'am.

493
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,611
I'm... I'm going, sir!

494
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:12,716
Yes.
Okay?

495
00:23:12,717 --> 00:23:14,951
Well, your wish came true, okay?

496
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:16,319
You got your wish.

497
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,754
Santa is into lessons this year.

498
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:19,956
I know.
It's super annoying.

499
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:22,125
You know how you want to be
close to your mom, right?

500
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:23,493
Okay.

501
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:25,829
Okay, well, now y'all
are close physically.

502
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,633
- That's not what I meant!
- I know.

503
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:31,568
Santa is a literal
son of a bitch.

504
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:33,670
Actually, is this your boy here?

505
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:35,505
Tell your boy to take it back.

506
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:36,973
I'm out.
Okay, okay, okay.

507
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:38,608
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen, listen, listen, okay?

508
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:40,577
It's not that easy, all right?

509
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:43,780
You got until 12:00 midnight
Christmas Eve.

510
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,650
And you got to prove
to Santa that you've changed,

511
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:48,184
that you've learned your lesson,

512
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:49,920
that you got
your Christmas spirit back.

513
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:51,354
And you're gonna
have to write him

514
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:56,059
an amended letter about
your true Christmas wish.

515
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,328
Then you'll get
your old life back,

516
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:00,864
and no one will remember
any of this except you.

517
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:02,365
No.

518
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:04,334
Fight me.
What if I don't do it?

519
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:05,602
- No?
- Yeah, no.

520
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:07,137
Okay, well, if you don't do it,

521
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:09,806
then you're gonna be in this
alternate universe forever.

522
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:13,910
And your last wish
is gonna come true forever.

523
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,812
My last wish.
Oh, God.

524
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,681
I don't even want to know.
What is it?

525
00:24:17,682 --> 00:24:20,550
Oh, okay, okay.
Let's see what it is.

526
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:22,752
You wished that the entire world

527
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,087
would turn into fruitcake.

528
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,656
I would never ask for that.
Not once.

529
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:28,058
You right.
Yeah, okay.

530
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,459
You didn't ask for that exactly.

531
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,660
This is what you said.

532
00:24:30,661 --> 00:24:33,096
You said, "Oh, I'm so hungry.

533
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,799
"Oh, I could eat anything.
Oh, you know what?

534
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,368
"Deliver me all the fruitcake
in the world

535
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:41,538
since you such
a magical mofo."

536
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:44,207
- Damn.
- That's what you said.

537
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,675
That sounds just like me.

538
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:47,310
And I guess
I'm here to help you.

539
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:51,681
I just... good God, I truly
am the queen of bad decisions.

542
00:24:57,888 --> 00:25:00,924
Okay, well,
apparently you wished

543
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:03,526
to be the queen
of a dance circle,

544
00:25:03,527 --> 00:25:05,528

the secret word.

545
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:07,897
What... no, no, no, no.

546
00:25:07,898 --> 00:25:10,300
You can go.
How do I get them to go?

547
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,902
You can go.
They're not gonna stop, okay?

548
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:15,405
You gon' have to dance, okay?

549
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:16,806
Or this gonna go on forever.

550
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,541
Look at her.
That's gonna happen.

551
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:19,776
That right there
with the ribbon.

552
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:21,411

Okay, okay.

556
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,623
I can't do this.

557
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:50,141
Mm.

558
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:57,848
Mm-hmm, how do I
still have that?

559
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,959
Well, KLDA Nation,

560
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,829
looks like
we officially have a Christmas

561
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,633
of all I didn't want.

562
00:26:23,574 --> 00:26:27,343
Mm.
Ah.

563
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:29,813
<i>Emily, breakfast!</i>

564
00:26:29,814 --> 00:26:32,149
Okay.

565
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:37,320
Ice sculptures, which you
and your dad can pick up.

566
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:38,655
Okay.

567
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:41,491
And also, of course,
our hair appointments.

568
00:26:41,492 --> 00:26:46,696
And we have to find you
a date for the party.

569
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:50,301
No, I really don't think we do.

570
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,938
Listen, it's only two days.

571
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:59,008
Don't be nervous.
I know that we can do this.

572
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:02,879
Which brings us to Goldie,

573
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,784
Silversmith, and Platinum.

574
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:09,686
I'll handle her alone.

575
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:13,356
Oh, she is going
to win that cover for us.

576
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:16,593
It's her year.
I know she can do it.

577
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,995
If we find her the right tools,

578
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:21,865
she can do anything she wants.

579
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:24,300
Right, the tree can
do whatever she wants.

580
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:25,969
Me, not so much.

581
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,671
Hey, how do I look?

582
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:31,141
Like you are
avoiding helping me.

583
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:33,076
Oh, oh, oh, Em.

584
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:34,577
There was
this sort of love letter

585
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:36,079
waiting for you at the door.

586
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,348
Okay.
Well, ladies, have fun.

587
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:40,183
Fellas are waiting.
I got to go.

588
00:27:40,184 --> 00:27:43,086
I love you, baby.
Get out of here!

589
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:45,355
He's always running off.
Oh!

590
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,590
It's from Chet Charles.
No frigging way.

591
00:27:47,591 --> 00:27:51,494
- Chet Charles.
- Oh.

592
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,663
Okay.

593
00:27:53,664 --> 00:27:55,965
"Please go out with me.

594
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,569
"Until then,
here's a lock of my hair

595
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,704
"to keep my essence near.

596
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:03,640
Love you forever."

597
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,409
Oh, my God.
This is so gross.

598
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,744
<i>Wish number five,</i>

599
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:09,646
<i>I want the hottest guy
I can think of</i>

600
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:12,048
<i>to be completely crazed-balls
obsessed with me.</i>

601
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:14,317
<i>High school god Chet Charles.</i>

602
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:18,188
Oh, Chet Charles.
He's a sweetheart.

603
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:21,057
Didn't you have a big crush
on him in high school?

604
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:22,892
Mom, that was
like a million years ago.

605
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:24,928
But it looks like
he's a serial killer now.

606
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:27,463
No, no.
You should know he's a dentist.

607
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:31,234
I mean, he has
his posters all over town.

608
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:35,438
I am just so surprised
that he sent this to you.

609
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:39,976
Now you can cross off
finding a date as one

610
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:41,945
of the tasks on your list.

611
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:43,213
You know something?

612
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:45,348
You have been moving
like molasses.

613
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,984
You act like you want
to be late for work.

614
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:49,986
- Work?
- Work!

615
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:52,255
Come on, let's get out of here.

616
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:54,023
I didn't realize
I had a job here.

617
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,259
Well, you do.

618
00:28:57,678 --> 00:28:59,045
Come on, hurry up.
Oh!

619
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:01,281
The ice angels
are back in stock again.

620
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,451
Now, remember to pick up the
frozen pigs in a blanket, okay?

621
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,620
After you get off of work.
And brush your hair.

622
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,155
Ah!

623
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:10,257
Look, your boyfriend,
Chet the dentist!

624
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:12,325
Oh, I gotta go.

625
00:29:12,326 --> 00:29:13,627
I gotta get those angels.

626
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,729
Oh, come on, they're over there.

627
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,032
That's not my man.

628
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:22,068
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?

629
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:24,638
Okay, well,
this is where you work.

630
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,072
Boss Ass Bitchmas?

631
00:29:26,073 --> 00:29:29,843
<i>Wish number six,
I want to be a boss ass bitch!</i>

632
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:30,877
- Mm-hmm.
- Ornament?

633
00:29:30,878 --> 00:29:32,679
I... oh, no!

634
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,880
- Huh, what?
- Hide me!

635
00:29:33,881 --> 00:29:35,081
Okay, look.

636
00:29:35,082 --> 00:29:36,449
I don't really do hugs,
you know.

637
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,118
This feel weird, so...

638
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,120
No, no, no, no, no.

639
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:42,722
You see that girl over there
with the blonde hair

640
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:44,758
and the angry eyes?

641
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,593
Ginger George.

642
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:49,329
She used to be my best friend,
up until freshman year,

643
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,665
when she decided to ruin my life

644
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,466
at the Glen Ridge Christmas Fair

645
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:55,970
in front of everybody.
What happened?

646
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,811
I actually can't
go there right now.

647
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:07,314
I can't.
It's... I can't.

648
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:09,349
In a nutshell,

649
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,519
she bullied me straight through
high school graduation.

650
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,721
It was awful.

651
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:16,890
I mean,
I went from having friends

652
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:19,192
to all of a sudden
being a social pariah.

653
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,627
Like, you should
have heard the things

654
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:22,028
that the kids said about me.

655
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,764
And to my face!

656
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:26,299
Oh, no, no, no.
Ahh!

657
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,601
BFF!

658
00:30:27,602 --> 00:30:30,170
<i>Wish number seven, I want a BFF.</i>

659
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:32,038
You crazy biznatch!

660
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,007
Why were you doing
that little hidey-hidey thing?

661
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:36,543
And um... oh, my God, who is this?

662
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,645
Is it your boyfriend?

663
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:40,780
No, this is my elf.

664
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:42,549
Okay.

665
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,018
Why you being so weird,
you weirdo?

666
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:46,553
Oh, my God.

667
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,888
So I finished the
Bitches Love Santa ornaments,

668
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,893
and I designed
this super cute new one.

669
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:58,431
"Don't be silent
tonight, bae."

670
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:00,100
It's even cuter
when other people say it.

671
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:04,070
So are you ready to get to work?

672
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,672
No, I need a minute.

673
00:31:05,673 --> 00:31:09,309
Okay, BRB then because
I'm going to grab coffee,

674
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,147
unless maybe I could
grab something else?

675
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,685
Okay.

676
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:20,887
Excuse me, what was that?

677
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:22,656
Yeah, I figured
this would happen.

678
00:31:22,657 --> 00:31:24,224
It's my elfmones.

679
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:27,260
Yeah, elf pheromones
are like catnip to humans.

680
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,828
Sad.

681
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,864
Huh?

682
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:32,799
Can I get you something, Daddy?

683
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,769
No, no!
Focus.

684
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,638
Okay, what I'm getting here

685
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:42,609
is that I work here

686
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,448
with my bully, who is my BFF?

687
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,486
I'm gonna leave
in a huff so huffy.

688
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:55,456
- Okay.
- Get ready for it.

689
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,994
I'm writing Santa now!

690
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:06,599
Dear Santa,
my true wish is to go back

691
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,470
to my real life.

692
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,940
- That's not gonna work.
- There, yeah.

693
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:22,148
No, oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

694
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,418
Santa, you got me.
You will not beat me!

695
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:27,954
I think the real problem was
that I wasn't specific enough,

696
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:29,956
and I totally under...
I apologize.

697
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:34,160
Dear Santa, sorry
I wasn't specific enough.

698
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:38,998
I would like
to live at 5C again.

699
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,369
- No, it's...
- Chill, I got this.

700
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,638
- Okay, okay.
- 5C.

701
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,975
Pass the tofu nuggets, roomie.

702
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:50,977
Tofu?

703
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:52,645
- Hey, welcome back!
- I got it.

704
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:54,481
I figured it out.
You smell like tofurkey.

705
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:55,782
I know, I know.

706
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:57,584
I just need
to be real specific with him,

707
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:59,052
or I need to... I got it.

708
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:03,723
Dear Santa, I want everyone

709
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:06,526
at my job to see the real me.

710
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:07,961
Real you... no!

711
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:10,063
- I have to beat Santa's ass.
- Santa is literal!

712
00:33:10,064 --> 00:33:11,064
- I will beat...
- Santa is literal!

713
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:12,633
Can Santa whoop my ass?

714
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:18,238
Why are you naked,
you crazy bitch?

715
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:22,475
- Lookin' good, Emily!
- Is this casual Friday?

716
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:24,411
Okay.

717
00:33:24,412 --> 00:33:27,847
Dear Santa,
you think this is a game?

718
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:29,716
Huh, Santa?
Okay.

719
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:32,519
- Erase everything...
- No, don't write that!

720
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,287
And start... shh!

721
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:35,422
- Don't write it.
- Huh? Huh?

722
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:37,624
- Don't do that.
- Huh! Huh!

723
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:42,195
Erase everything
and start over, ha!

724
00:33:42,196 --> 00:33:43,930
Ooh!
You don't wanna say start over.

725
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:47,101
No, we gon' start...
♪ Over ♪

726
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,244
Wolf?

727
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:02,082
Wolf?

728
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:07,655
Oh, my God, fruitcake feet.

729
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,893
Oh, no, no, no!

730
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:18,298
Lost Souls Department,
Emergency Services.

731
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:19,899
Uh, yeah, man,
I'ma need a reset.

732
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,067
She reached Snowpocalypse.

733
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:23,169
Yikes, Tooth Fairy.

734
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,771
Sure you wanna reset now?

735
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,307
I mean, how bad
can the Tooth Fairy be?

736
00:34:27,308 --> 00:34:31,177
You seen her teeth, man?
Ugh.

737
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:34,648
Ah! Ah, help me!

738
00:34:40,154 --> 00:34:43,056
Wolf!
Yo, hey.

739
00:34:43,057 --> 00:34:45,058
Are you done?
Ah!

740
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:46,759
I'm done.
Okay.

741
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,264
Well, now what,
oh, magical elfin guide?

742
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:54,634
Okay, well, maybe neither
is your best life, okay?

743
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:56,769
Not the old one
and not the new one.

744
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,505
Are you trying
to say something helpful?

745
00:34:58,506 --> 00:35:00,673
Be careful.
Okay, okay, look.

746
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:02,108
I'm sorry you got stuck
with a shitty guide.

747
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:03,510
- I did.
- All right.

748
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:05,478
This is not my area
of expertise.

749
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,114
But maybe it's time
we lean into this whole thing.

750
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:10,149
Okay?
For the both of us.

751
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,818
Because I know you don't care.
I don't.

752
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,286
But if this doesn't
work out for you,

753
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:15,255
I'ma have to work
for the Tooth Fairy.

754
00:35:15,256 --> 00:35:17,223
Okay, cool.

755
00:35:17,224 --> 00:35:19,325
So now the Tooth Fairy is real.

756
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,227
Look, assuming
that I believe you,

757
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:23,263
that doesn't even
sound that bad.

758
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,998
Not that bad?
Okay.

759
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,299
All right.
You know what?

760
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,736
Look at this.

761
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:34,574
Oh, we need to figure
this out together.

762
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:36,577
One sec.

763
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:43,750
Not you dressed
like you in Silk Sonic.

764
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:46,453
How you do that?
I'm a magical elf, bitch!

765
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,489
All right, well,
now I look like garbage,

766
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,823
so I'm finna go change.

767
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:53,394
Do not look
at my yearbooks, okay?

768
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,264
Hmm, what's a yearbook?

769
00:36:02,102 --> 00:36:04,470
The disrespect.

770
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:06,639
Okay, you were not kidding
about those pheromones, huh?

771
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,741
Yeah.
That's why we don't do karaoke.

772
00:36:08,742 --> 00:36:11,244
It's too risky.
Yeah, say less.

773
00:36:11,245 --> 00:36:12,845
That'd be too dangerous for you.

774
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:14,147
Hey!

775
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:15,281
It's the gal
from the party house

776
00:36:15,282 --> 00:36:17,717
with the punctual mom.

777
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:20,653
It's the late delivery guy
with the booze.

778
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:21,721
Yeah.

779
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:26,025
Wyatt Snowmyn.
Wyatt Snowman?

780
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:27,760
No, close, "myn."

781
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:29,662
- Are you serious right now?
- Snowmyn.

782
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:31,331
Oh, I understand
what's happening.

783
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:33,099
This is... it's very clear.

784
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,134
You're a snowman
who's temporarily been

785
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:36,436
turned into a human being.

786
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:38,771
This is really hilarious.
This is very clever.

787
00:36:38,772 --> 00:36:41,240
This is why he was so cute
and smiley the other day.

788
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,209
You think...
You thought I was cute?

789
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,277
Actually, I'm sorry.

790
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:45,812
I don't have time for questions.

791
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:47,313
We're actually in the middle
of something right now, so...

792
00:36:47,314 --> 00:36:49,349
Can I just learn whatever
the lesson is tomorrow?

793
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,217
- I'm sorry, what?
- Babe!

794
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:53,720
I'm very busy.

795
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:56,522
Please just go find your magic
hat or whatever, you know.

796
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:58,057
I'll catch up with you
tomorrow, all right?

797
00:36:58,058 --> 00:36:59,292
- Okay, I'm...
- Get!

798
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:01,260
- Get?
- Snowmyn.

799
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,429
Y'all ain't on a schedule?

800
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,199
He's not one of ours.

801
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,669
Oh, sh... hey, Snowmyn!

802
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,738
Sh...
Maybe he melted.

803
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:12,739
Shut up!

804
00:37:15,126 --> 00:37:17,661
Okay, a little corn dog truck.

805
00:37:17,662 --> 00:37:21,264
Mm-hmm, that's how
we do it in the 'burbs!

806
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:22,933
Where do you hang out?

807
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:25,502
Oh, reindeer stalls.

808
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:26,870
All right, so let's lean in!

809
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:30,307
Okay, let's start here.
So, uh, lover boy.

810
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:32,042
Tell me about him.
Oh, come on.

811
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,476
That's so embarrassing.

812
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:35,412
Chet Charles was like
the high school heartthrob.

813
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:36,713
If I knew that this was real,

814
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:38,415
I would have chosen
someone else.

815
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:39,983
Let's go a little
bit deeper, okay?

816
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:43,353
Let's start at the beginning.
Let's see.

817
00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:45,288
Tell me about this.

818
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:47,357
Yeah, that's me and Mom in front

819
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,126
of her three
precious Christmas trees.

820
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:53,096
She was always more proud
of them than she was of me.

821
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:54,864
Yeah.
Okay.

822
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:56,934
Are you ready
to tell me about Ginger?

823
00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:01,238
Okay.

824
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,711
Ginger and I were best friends.
We were inseparable, honestly.

825
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:12,082
And when I started getting
a little chubby,

826
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:16,987
I also got really insecure
because kids are assholes.

827
00:38:16,988 --> 00:38:20,624
And Ginger always had my back,
you know,

828
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:24,828
until the Christmas she decided
to make my body a thing.

829
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:28,498
I hate her already.
Continue.

830
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:30,500
So we were rehearsing

831
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,569
for the Christmas talent show
for weeks,

832
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,840
and we were just
about to go on stage, and...

833
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:39,542
Hey, Ginger!
Are you ready?

834
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:41,544
I'm pretty nervous.

835
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:44,047
So they don't think

836
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,249
you should perform with us.

837
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,084
What?

838
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,953
But why?

839
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,724
Isn't it obvious, Gummy Tummy?

840
00:38:55,192 --> 00:38:56,960
Rude.

841
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,463
I hate Christmas.

842
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:03,600
Then she just dropped me.

843
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:05,068
And you really
never danced again?

844
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:09,373
No, not at school,
or really anywhere else.

845
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:12,842
Yeah, when
your best friend dumps you

846
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:15,111
real publicly like that,
you sort of learn

847
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:20,183
that life is a little better
out of the limelight.

848
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:22,519
Man, that makes me mad.

849
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,388
I just want to punch Dasher
right in his face.

850
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:28,124
And I like Dasher.
He's my guy.

851
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:31,361
Thank you so much
for your emotional outburst.

852
00:39:31,362 --> 00:39:34,130
Also, you know, I uh...

853
00:39:34,131 --> 00:39:36,566
Even though I still don't know
how to get out of this mess,

854
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:40,170
I actually do feel a lot better

855
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,172
unloading all of that.

856
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:44,408
So thank you.

857
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,611
Look at you being
surprisingly helpful.

858
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:50,747
Hey, I'm pretty wise.

859
00:39:50,748 --> 00:39:53,450
Great, I need that.
So what do I do now?

860
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:56,019
Ooh, fudge if I know.

861
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,423
Why are we opening these books?

862
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:04,094
You really think Linda's
trying to sabotage you?

863
00:40:04,095 --> 00:40:05,895
Well, I don't know anymore.

864
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:08,798
But I did see her peeping
through our window last night.

865
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:10,934
And if you don't call
that sabotage,

866
00:40:10,935 --> 00:40:12,902
then I don't know.

867
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:17,107
Um, I think you should
just talk to her.

868
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:19,142
You like all the same stuff.

869
00:40:19,143 --> 00:40:21,478
Decorating, holidays,

870
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:25,115
glitter, dressing nice,

871
00:40:25,116 --> 00:40:28,418
holidays, looking pretty.

872
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:31,321
- You think she's pretty?
- Oh, heavens no.

873
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:34,557
♪ I think
you're pretty, baby ♪

874
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,326
♪ Sure look good to me ♪
Oh.

875
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:38,361
Mm-hmm.

876
00:40:38,362 --> 00:40:40,697
Well, she never invites me

877
00:40:40,698 --> 00:40:44,534
to her ladies' nights, you know?

878
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:48,004
Of course I wouldn't go,
but I mean,

879
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:52,009
I think it still would
be nice to be asked, you know?

880
00:40:53,844 --> 00:40:55,378
I'm fun.

881
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:57,480
Right, Stan?

882
00:40:57,481 --> 00:40:59,115
Of course you are.

883
00:40:59,116 --> 00:41:02,318
You are very... yeah.

884
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,021
Sure you are, baby.

885
00:41:05,022 --> 00:41:08,324
I think there's one spot
over by your right armpit

886
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:11,461
that is empty still.

887
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:13,897
No, no, your right armpit.
The right.

888
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:15,532
Baby, this is my right armpit.

889
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:17,100
No more nogtinis for you.

890
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:19,769
Okay.

891
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:24,874
I just don't think we have
the right feature piece.

892
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:28,178
We need a unique
conversation piece,

893
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:29,546
you know, a showstopper.

894
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,848
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

895
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:34,450
Maybe I can find one
after the hair salon.

896
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:36,653
Hey, you ready?

897
00:41:36,654 --> 00:41:38,888
Oh, hey, baby.
You ready to go?

898
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:41,025
Okay, chop chop.
Let's do it.

899
00:41:50,067 --> 00:41:51,935
So, Sally.

900
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:55,572
Thank you for squeezing us in
for this trial run.

901
00:41:55,573 --> 00:42:00,510
So tell me,
how high can you get our hair?

902
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:02,378
All the way up, baby.

903
00:42:02,379 --> 00:42:05,515
Oh, you gave me a chill.

904
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:08,852
You know, my daughter, Emily,
she's gonna be bringing

905
00:42:08,853 --> 00:42:11,354
a dentist to the party.

906
00:42:11,355 --> 00:42:13,389
- No.
- Oh, a dentist?

907
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,958
- Yes!
- No, no, no, no, I'm not.

908
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:17,727
I'm not gonna bring
the dentist to the party.

909
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:21,364
Actually, that drinks
delivery guy was really cute,

910
00:42:21,365 --> 00:42:24,834
don't you think?
Uh...

911
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:27,604
Mom, are you listening to me?

912
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:35,111
So how is Linda
wearing her hair to the party?

913
00:42:35,112 --> 00:42:36,646
I'm not sure yet.

914
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:38,882
She's gonna tell me
at rummy tonight.

915
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:40,283
Oh.

916
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:43,721
So you still playing rummy
with that basic bitch?

917
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:47,023
Just a few of us.

918
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:51,461
I don't even like rummy,
honestly, hm.

919
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:54,164
Mm-hmm.

920
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:59,702
Uh, we look like
giant Christmas gnomes.

921
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:03,439
Did you... I mean,
you really like it this way?

922
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,677
The holiday look in Paris.

923
00:43:07,678 --> 00:43:11,447
We must do it.

924
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:14,284
Mom, are you gonna be okay
if you don't win this thing?

925
00:43:14,285 --> 00:43:16,886
I just love this look.

926
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:19,222
Huh?
You say something?

927
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:20,957
I said you're gorgeous,

928
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,759
and I'm so glad I look like you.

929
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,662
No, you look like your dad.

930
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:31,668
Yeah, well, now the hair's
coming all the way down, baby.

931
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:34,238
Much better.

932
00:43:36,006 --> 00:43:38,574
Dear KLDA listeners,
Emily Harris here,

933
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:40,977
reporting live from
the nightmare before Christmas.

934
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:44,314
Do I have what it takes
to find my Christmas spirit

935
00:43:44,315 --> 00:43:45,782
while working for my bully

936
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:48,217
and also wearing
the world's worst hairstyle?

937
00:43:48,218 --> 00:43:49,987
Stay tuned!

938
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:53,824
Let me just do that.

939
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:58,062
Was that always a fruitcake?

940
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:05,301
No, it used to be a bush.

941
00:44:05,302 --> 00:44:10,207
Ginger, I'm reporting
for work or whatever.

942
00:44:11,742 --> 00:44:15,511
Ugh, a note.
Okay.

943
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:18,448
<i>Hey, bitch!
Sorry, had to close today.</i>

944
00:44:18,449 --> 00:44:20,817
<i>Sexmergency.</i>

945
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:23,052
<i>Blame your spicy little friend</i>

946
00:44:23,053 --> 00:44:24,954
<i>and his spicy cologne.</i>

947
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:27,256
Oh, girl, I'm pretty sure
elves are asexual.

948
00:44:27,257 --> 00:44:29,292
<i>I'm not
with your friend, B-T-dubs.</i>

949
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:31,995
<i>Not yet.
</i>- Gross, come on, girl.

950
00:44:31,996 --> 00:44:33,730
<i>Anyways, uh, take the day off.</i>

951
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:36,099
<i>It's Xmas Eve Eve.</i>

952
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,634
<i>See you at darts tonight, bitch.</i>

953
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,204
Christmas Eve Eve already?

954
00:44:41,205 --> 00:44:43,206
God!

955
00:44:46,877 --> 00:44:50,813
"I wanna roast your chestnuts
this Christmas."

956
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:54,150
I hate that that's so funny,
but it is.

957
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:56,185
Ooh.

958
00:44:56,186 --> 00:44:58,388
Hey, handsome.

959
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:01,057
Talk about a showstopper.

960
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:06,062
<i>♪ And no guy in the world

961
00:45:06,063 --> 00:45:09,165

962
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:11,334

00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:14,037
Just gonna...

964
00:45:14,038 --> 00:45:16,305

968
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:30,020
He's got the mouth.

969
00:45:32,682 --> 00:45:34,450
You playing rummy tonight too?

970
00:45:37,086 --> 00:45:38,520
No problem.

971
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:40,255
Oh, I have plenty that I can do.

972
00:45:40,256 --> 00:45:43,325
Listen, I'll just see you
tomorrow at the party, okay?

973
00:45:43,326 --> 00:45:44,860
Okay.

974
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:47,796
Oh!
I can't stand her.

975
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:50,932
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh, Emily.

976
00:45:50,933 --> 00:45:52,467
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

977
00:45:52,468 --> 00:45:55,771
I want you to help me
apply that gold leaf

978
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:57,372
to the nutcracker dolls.

979
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:58,874
Yeah, I got you.

980
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,910
But actually, I wanted
to show you something.

981
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:03,845
So I went down to the shop,

982
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:07,115
and I got you a bunch of,
you know, really cute

983
00:46:07,116 --> 00:46:09,317
but traditional ornaments.

984
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:11,787
But I think we both know
that what you really need

985
00:46:11,788 --> 00:46:14,056
is a showstopper.
Mmhmm.

986
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:18,627
So I found something that
your girl Platinum over here

987
00:46:18,628 --> 00:46:20,062
would really appreciate.

988
00:46:20,063 --> 00:46:21,830
And I want to warn you,

989
00:46:21,831 --> 00:46:23,799
it can be seen as a little edgy,

990
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,401
but edgy is in right now.

991
00:46:26,402 --> 00:46:29,604
Trust me, so...

992
00:46:29,605 --> 00:46:31,306
Bam!
Isn't he cute?

993
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:33,408
He's a little merman!
Yeah.

994
00:46:33,409 --> 00:46:35,577
I was thinking
that he would go great

995
00:46:35,578 --> 00:46:36,912
right in that middle space,

996
00:46:36,913 --> 00:46:39,415
right in the center of the tree.

997
00:46:42,418 --> 00:46:45,687
Why don't you put all of these

998
00:46:45,688 --> 00:46:48,458
on the tree
in your daddy's office?

999
00:46:50,193 --> 00:46:52,929
Right, of course,
the tree no one's gonna see.

1000
00:46:55,765 --> 00:46:59,601
Mom, do you think maybe
you want to try the ornament?

1001
00:46:59,602 --> 00:47:00,969
It's really, really important.

1002
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:05,373
Baby, it's a bit edgy
for the judges.

1003
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:07,876
Okay, but I'm asking you to try.

1004
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:11,346
I'm trying.
I'm try... Santa!

1005
00:47:11,347 --> 00:47:13,582
If your magical ears
can hear me,

1006
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:15,083
it's not working, so now what?

1007
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:16,885
What?
What about Santa?

1008
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:18,286
Nothing!

1009
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:21,289
Did you ask that nice dentist
to the party?

1010
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,492
Mom, I told you
I don't want to go with him.

1011
00:47:23,493 --> 00:47:26,561
He sent me a lock of his hair.
It's gross.

1012
00:47:26,562 --> 00:47:29,564
- Romantic.
- Seriously?

1013
00:47:29,565 --> 00:47:31,566
Baby, he's handsome.

1014
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:34,136
He likes you.
He's successful.

1015
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:37,038
You really don't care
what I want, do you?

1016
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,342
I don't want
to see you to end up alone.

1017
00:47:40,343 --> 00:47:42,779
Now, why would I end up alone?

1018
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:45,847
Because I'm not perfect?

1019
00:47:45,848 --> 00:47:48,250
Because I'm not you?

1020
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:50,852
Is it how I act or how I look?

1021
00:47:50,853 --> 00:47:52,187
No, I don't know.

1022
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:53,755
Oh, you don't want
to talk about it,

1023
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:55,624
but I'm just supposed to settle
for someone I don't like

1024
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,659
because girls that act
like me and look like me

1025
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,662
are supposed to settle?
No, not necessarily.

1026
00:48:00,663 --> 00:48:03,064
Jesus, Mom, you...

1027
00:48:03,065 --> 00:48:06,535
Baby, I love you.

1028
00:48:06,536 --> 00:48:08,003
I love you.

1029
00:48:08,004 --> 00:48:09,604
Just, the world is...

1030
00:48:09,605 --> 00:48:12,707
Mom, I know how the world is,
but you could be on my side.

1031
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:14,075
I am on your side!

1032
00:48:14,076 --> 00:48:15,377
You think you're on my side

1033
00:48:15,378 --> 00:48:18,147
when you won't even
hang up an ornament?

1034
00:48:19,782 --> 00:48:21,783
This is exactly
why I don't talk to you.

1035
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:25,620
It is... there's no point.

1036
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:28,657
By the way, you probably
wouldn't be alone all the time

1037
00:48:28,658 --> 00:48:31,593
if you didn't expect everybody
and everything around you

1038
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:33,028
to be perfect all the time!

1039
00:48:33,029 --> 00:48:35,096
Whatever it is
that you think is perfect.

1040
00:48:35,097 --> 00:48:37,732
Oh, young lady,
you watch your tone!

1041
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:39,701

1054
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:27,716
Oh, he is cute.
You like him?

1055
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,150
You should go chat him up.

1056
00:49:29,151 --> 00:49:33,255
Maybe, um, nibble his carrots
if you know what I mean.

1057
00:49:33,256 --> 00:49:35,257
I don't.
Can you explain it in detail?

1058
00:49:35,258 --> 00:49:37,025
- You know, like his...
- Bullseye Candy?

1059
00:49:37,026 --> 00:49:38,860
Bullseye Candy?

1060
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:41,029
Yeah.

1061
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,498
Bullseye Candy.
That's us.

1062
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:45,700
Yo, we got this.

1063
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:47,636
Boom!

1064
00:49:47,637 --> 00:49:49,271
Both: ♪ Bullseye Candy ♪

1065
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:51,239
♪ Bullseye Candy ♪

1066
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,009
♪ Bullseye Candy,
get out of the way ♪

1067
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,777
Excuse us!

1068
00:49:55,778 --> 00:49:58,480
Excuse us!
Move out of the way.

1069
00:49:58,481 --> 00:49:59,448
Okay.

1070
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:01,050
One, two, three.

1071
00:50:02,985 --> 00:50:05,086
Oh, well.

1072
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:07,289
We'll get 'em next year.

1073
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,024
I'm sorry,
that was embarrassing.

1074
00:50:09,025 --> 00:50:11,159
I'm a little rusty.

1075
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,560
Yeah, that was weird.

1076
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:14,329
Normally, you're like
a total bullseye bitch.

1077
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,364
- I am?
- Yeah!

1078
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:17,866
Cool.

1079
00:50:17,867 --> 00:50:19,134
I think I'm gonna go for it

1080
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:22,103
with your, uh, cinnamon friend.

1081
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:24,506
If you don't mind.
No, no, no, no.

1082
00:50:24,507 --> 00:50:26,007
I definitely don't mind.

1083
00:50:26,008 --> 00:50:28,810
Um, full disclosure,
he might not be into you.

1084
00:50:28,811 --> 00:50:30,145
But you know.

1085
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:31,446
Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

1086
00:50:31,447 --> 00:50:33,081
Yeah, I'm definitely
gonna make my move then.

1087
00:50:33,082 --> 00:50:35,450
- You're not scared?
- No!

1088
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,620
I mean, I've made a fool
of myself like a million times.

1089
00:50:38,621 --> 00:50:39,821
I mean, you know.

1090
00:50:39,822 --> 00:50:42,624
You've always
been really ballsy.

1091
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:44,326
I've always envied
that about you.

1092
00:50:44,327 --> 00:50:45,593
Thank you very much.

1093
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:48,063
I mean, I'd rather just know.
You know?

1094
00:50:48,064 --> 00:50:49,931
You got to go after
what you want.

1095
00:50:49,932 --> 00:50:51,599
Be bold.

1096
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,369
Like, uh...

1097
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:03,611
Look, it's crazy snowman girl.

1098
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:05,413
Oh.

1099
00:51:05,414 --> 00:51:07,582
You remember that.
Mmhmm.

1100
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,084
Hi.

1101
00:51:09,085 --> 00:51:11,419
I'm sorry about that.

1102
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,455
I thought you were someone else,

1103
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:15,824
but I was wrong.

1104
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:17,693
So who are you?

1105
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:20,695
I'm Wyatt Snowmyn.

1106
00:51:20,696 --> 00:51:25,266
Age 31, Scorpio,
Leo moon rising, obviously.

1107
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:27,902
Originally of Glen Ridge,
New Jersey.

1108
00:51:27,903 --> 00:51:30,538
Go Panthers.

1109
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:32,273
Currently residing in Manhattan.

1110
00:51:32,274 --> 00:51:35,276
Part owner of a few bars,
including this little gem

1111
00:51:35,277 --> 00:51:36,845
in the old hometown.

1112
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:39,681
Okay, so I stopped listening
after you said Scorpio

1113
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:41,783
because I know
that Scorpios are kinky.

1114
00:51:41,784 --> 00:51:43,385
- Oh, yeah?
- And uh...

1115
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:44,953
Sting.

1116
00:51:44,954 --> 00:51:46,554
I'm kidding.

1117
00:51:46,555 --> 00:51:49,124
I'm... it's nice
to meet you, Wyatt.

1118
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:50,959
I'm Emily.

1119
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,495
I don't think
I gave you my name.

1120
00:51:53,496 --> 00:51:56,698
No, you were definitely
too busy yelling at me.

1121
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:00,201
- Oh, you didn't like that?
- Oh, well, eh.

1122
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:02,705
Hmm.
Because you're welcome.

1123
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:05,974
Scorpios love that.

1124
00:52:05,975 --> 00:52:07,041
Yeah, I can take a little abuse.

1125
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:08,243
Yeah.

1126
00:52:08,244 --> 00:52:11,346
Okay, you know what?
Here.

1127
00:52:11,347 --> 00:52:15,684
Emily, for you and your friend.

1128
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:18,920
Boom.
Okay.

1129
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:20,789
- Yeah.
- For free?

1130
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:21,757
- Yes.
- Okay.

1131
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:23,425
No charge.

1132
00:52:23,426 --> 00:52:26,494
Your tip is that you get
to watch me walk away.

1133
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,996
Oof!

1134
00:52:27,997 --> 00:52:30,165
This is better than 20%.

1135
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:32,367
Whew!
Check this out.

1136
00:52:32,368 --> 00:52:33,702
Mm, thank you.

1137
00:52:36,872 --> 00:52:38,340
Okay, so I'll get a glass
of this Sancerre to start.

1138
00:52:38,341 --> 00:52:40,942
Very good.
Will anyone be joining you?

1139
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:43,645
Nope!
Just a little me time.

1140
00:52:43,646 --> 00:52:46,448
You know, I don't
get a lot of me time.

1141
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:49,551
So this is extremely exciting.

1142
00:52:49,552 --> 00:52:51,486
Oh, very good.

1143
00:52:51,487 --> 00:52:53,488
Yeah.
You been working here long?

1144
00:52:53,489 --> 00:52:54,990
- Two years.
- Two years!

1145
00:52:54,991 --> 00:52:56,625
Oh, very nice.

1146
00:52:56,626 --> 00:52:58,193
So...
I'll bring you that Sancerre.

1147
00:52:58,194 --> 00:53:02,063
But... oh, okay.

1148
00:53:02,064 --> 00:53:04,432
- Sancerre.
- Yes.

1149
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:06,801
- It's my favorite.
- Good taste.

1150
00:53:06,802 --> 00:53:08,103
You too.

1151
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:11,072
It might sound crazy,
but be my guest.

1152
00:53:11,073 --> 00:53:12,540
You know what?

1153
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:14,743
I was hoping that you would
say something like that.

1154
00:53:14,744 --> 00:53:16,244
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1155
00:53:16,245 --> 00:53:18,147
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1156
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:25,020
Yeah!
Entertaining nonetheless.

1157
00:53:25,021 --> 00:53:26,955
Oh, my God, that is disgusting.

1158
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:28,356
It's getting mintier, I swear.

1159
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:30,025
So creamy.
Let's get another one.

1160
00:53:30,026 --> 00:53:32,193
Okay, I'm in charge of the...

1161
00:53:32,194 --> 00:53:33,395
I'll get the...

1162
00:53:33,396 --> 00:53:36,197
Yes you are!
He totally likes you.

1163
00:53:36,198 --> 00:53:38,667
- No!
- Yes!

1164
00:53:38,668 --> 00:53:40,135
No, no, he doesn't.

1165
00:53:40,136 --> 00:53:41,603
He's, uh... no.

1166
00:53:41,604 --> 00:53:44,105
He's been comping
your drinks all night.

1167
00:53:44,106 --> 00:53:45,306
It's like,
why would he be into me?

1168
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:46,841
Why wouldn't he be into you?

1169
00:53:46,842 --> 00:53:48,476
Well, because he
looks like he's from,

1170
00:53:48,477 --> 00:53:51,112
like, a J.Crew, like, ar... oh.

1171
00:53:51,113 --> 00:53:53,481
Oh, my God, Chet Charles?

1172
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:55,984
- What are you...
- What are you doing?

1173
00:53:55,985 --> 00:53:58,386
♪ I really can't stay ♪

1174
00:53:58,387 --> 00:54:01,556
♪ Baby, it's cold outside ♪

1175
00:54:01,557 --> 00:54:07,462
♪ I gotta get away 'cause,
baby, it's cold outside ♪

1176
00:54:07,463 --> 00:54:09,297
All right, it's done, so...

1177
00:54:09,298 --> 00:54:11,499
Your mom told me that you
wanted me to be your date

1178
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,934
for the Christmas Eve party.

1179
00:54:12,935 --> 00:54:14,102
Okay, but I didn't actually...

1180
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:15,570
And I have never
been more honored

1181
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:17,839
by anything in my entire life.

1182
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,741
So I obviously accept.

1183
00:54:19,742 --> 00:54:22,243
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm not... I didn't...

1184
00:54:22,244 --> 00:54:23,912
I got you something.

1185
00:54:23,913 --> 00:54:25,547
This is a misunder...
This is a Christmas adventure,

1186
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:29,017
and I wrote a...
It's a San... uh, mm.

1187
00:54:29,018 --> 00:54:31,086
Okay, okay.

1188
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:33,088
I'll see you tomorrow.

1189
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:35,223
Probably not.

1190
00:54:35,224 --> 00:54:39,160
Don't show up
because I don't... oh.

1191
00:54:39,161 --> 00:54:42,831
Oh, no, is that chair fruitcake?

1192
00:54:42,832 --> 00:54:45,133
Oh, my God.

1193
00:54:45,134 --> 00:54:49,471
You sneaky little hussy!

1194
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:52,507
Are you
and Chet Charles a thing?

1195
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:54,375
No, we are not...
No, no, no, no, no.

1196
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:55,844
We're not a thing, me and Chet.

1197
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:57,011
No, no, we're not.

1198
00:54:57,012 --> 00:54:58,680
Stop, stop,
stop scissoring yourself.

1199
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:03,785
Actually, um, I think
that my mom is more interested

1200
00:55:03,786 --> 00:55:06,321
like, actually interested
in him for me,

1201
00:55:06,322 --> 00:55:08,790
but I'm definitely
not interested in him.

1202
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:11,092
That's not the guy for me
or anything like that.

1203
00:55:11,093 --> 00:55:12,794
Okay, Em, you're, like,

1204
00:55:12,795 --> 00:55:15,430
really yelling this
out loud right now.

1205
00:55:15,431 --> 00:55:19,567
I just wanted to make sure
everybody gets the point

1206
00:55:19,568 --> 00:55:22,738
about my personal feeling.

1207
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:26,341
That's funny.
That's funny.

1208
00:55:26,342 --> 00:55:28,510
Look, look.

1209
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,412
Lorraine,
can I be honest with you?

1210
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:33,815
Yes, if you let me wear the hat.

1211
00:55:33,816 --> 00:55:35,150
Oh, okay!

1212
00:55:35,151 --> 00:55:39,320
Here you go.
Ooh!

1213
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:41,256
Oh!
I like.

1214
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:42,724
I like!
Looks nice on you.

1215
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:44,859
You like it?

1216
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,862
Okay, but don't take
this the wrong way,

1217
00:55:47,863 --> 00:55:51,166
but you're not really
a good listener.

1218
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:52,867
Mm-hmm.

1219
00:55:52,868 --> 00:55:57,572
But what if I know better
for the people than they do?

1220
00:55:57,573 --> 00:55:59,440
What if I know
what's better for them?

1221
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:00,975
Look, put your hands out.
Come here.

1222
00:56:00,976 --> 00:56:02,477
- I put my hands out?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
00:56:02,478 --> 00:56:03,878
Like this.
Oh, okay.

1224
00:56:03,879 --> 00:56:05,180
Hold mine, okay.

1225
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:07,482
Repeat after me.

1226
00:56:07,483 --> 00:56:10,318
Sometimes,
my opinions are wrong.

1227
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,288
Mm.

1228
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:15,723
Sometimes,
my opinions are wrong.

1229
00:56:15,724 --> 00:56:20,528
And sometimes, I hurt people
and myself when I judge them.

1230
00:56:20,529 --> 00:56:23,898
Sometimes, I hurt people
and myself when I judge them.

1231
00:56:23,899 --> 00:56:25,300
Mm-hmm.

1232
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:26,968
Okay.

1233
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:29,137
Yeah, and I need
to be a better listener,

1234
00:56:29,138 --> 00:56:33,341
and I need to be more
supportive of my daughter.

1235
00:56:33,342 --> 00:56:35,243
You got a daughter?

1236
00:56:35,244 --> 00:56:39,113
No, that one was for you.

1237
00:56:39,114 --> 00:56:41,583
- Oh.
- See what I'm saying?

1238
00:56:41,584 --> 00:56:43,685
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

1239
00:56:43,686 --> 00:56:44,953
I see you.

1240
00:56:44,954 --> 00:56:46,955
Did you get
what I was saying, though?

1241
00:56:46,956 --> 00:56:48,656
You understood?

1242
00:56:48,657 --> 00:56:52,927
I'm... my daughter...

1243
00:56:52,928 --> 00:56:55,496
Whew!
She's just like her father.

1244
00:56:55,497 --> 00:56:57,098
- Okay.
- You know what I'm saying?

1245
00:56:57,099 --> 00:56:58,600
Right.

1246
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:00,435
That's all I got
to say about it.

1247
00:57:00,436 --> 00:57:02,770
And I was...

1248
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:05,940
I need to be more supportive
and listen.

1249
00:57:05,941 --> 00:57:07,408
Mm-hmm.

1250
00:57:07,409 --> 00:57:09,143
- I can do that.
- You can do that?

1251
00:57:09,144 --> 00:57:10,545
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay!

1252
00:57:10,546 --> 00:57:12,513
All right.
Yes, I can.

1253
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:14,582
Cool!
You enjoying that Sancerre?

1254
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:17,051
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1255
00:57:17,052 --> 00:57:20,121
It's good, ain't it?

1256
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:22,924
It's that bubbly.

1257
00:57:22,925 --> 00:57:24,859
It is good!

1258
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,594
Do you remember when we were...

1259
00:57:26,595 --> 00:57:27,829
We had to do the Christmas show?

1260
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:28,997
Mm-hmm.

1261
00:57:28,998 --> 00:57:31,099
And you, like,
dumped me as a friend,

1262
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,534
and then you started saying
really mean things about me

1263
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:34,936
to like, the whole school.

1264
00:57:34,937 --> 00:57:36,237
Do you remember that?

1265
00:57:36,238 --> 00:57:38,640
I didn't... no, no!

1266
00:57:38,641 --> 00:57:41,877
I don't remember... but wait.
Yo, where are those shots?

1267
00:57:43,712 --> 00:57:46,481
No, yeah, why would you... okay.

1268
00:57:46,482 --> 00:57:48,416
So I do remember, though.
Yeah.

1269
00:57:48,417 --> 00:57:51,686
And it was like a nightmare
for me, honestly.

1270
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:54,122
And it just was
really weird for me,

1271
00:57:54,123 --> 00:57:56,691
because you went from,
like, being my best friend

1272
00:57:56,692 --> 00:57:59,060
in the whole world to, like,
then being my bully.

1273
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:02,864
And it really... it, like,
messed me up, honestly, then,

1274
00:58:02,865 --> 00:58:05,199
and I kind of feel like
it still messes me up now.

1275
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,068
Yeah, dude,
but what are you talking about?

1276
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:08,369
We were kids.

1277
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,671
It's like a bajillion years ago.

1278
00:58:09,672 --> 00:58:12,206
Come on!
Come on, we're past that.

1279
00:58:12,207 --> 00:58:13,775
- Yeah?
- We're good.

1280
00:58:13,776 --> 00:58:15,009
Like, I'm already
really embarrassed,

1281
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:16,411
and I feel like
the queen of idiots...

1282

God, you told me
so much about you,

1295
00:58:59,788 --> 00:59:02,690
but you did not tell me how
great you were at miming.

1296
00:59:02,691 --> 00:59:05,560
Oh, it is one
of my finest skills, milady.

1297
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:08,497
Well, that's very clear.

1298
00:59:10,132 --> 00:59:14,902
Oh, you might know
the answer to this.

1299
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:16,604
Like, okay.

1300
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:19,507
What is the mime for,

1301
00:59:19,508 --> 00:59:22,711
"I want to kiss you"?

1302
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:27,015
Wow, uh.

1303
00:59:27,016 --> 00:59:28,616
Okay, well, I uh...

1304
00:59:28,617 --> 00:59:30,451
I think it's just,

1305
00:59:30,452 --> 00:59:32,153
lean in

1306
00:59:32,154 --> 00:59:35,490
and purse your lips,

1307
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:37,593
and you close your eyes.

1308
00:59:45,234 --> 00:59:47,235
Good to know.
Thank you.

1309
00:59:47,236 --> 00:59:48,236
Thanks for telling me.

1310
00:59:48,237 --> 00:59:50,938
That's, uh, maybe I'll...

1311
00:59:50,939 --> 00:59:53,441
I'm gonna... I should get her
home because she's drunk.

1312
00:59:53,442 --> 00:59:55,276
- Totally cool, yeah.
- Yeah, hey!

1313
00:59:55,277 --> 00:59:58,179
Ginger, get...
What?

1314
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,849
All right, stop dancing!

1315
01:00:06,555 --> 01:00:11,125
Well, KLDA Nation,
I choked again.

1316
01:00:11,126 --> 01:00:15,563
I have no idea what I'm
writing to Santa tomorrow,

1317
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:17,832
and I'm gonna be stuck here

1318
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:21,470
in a world
made entirely of fruitcake.

1319
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,648
"I think this one looks nice
here after all."

1320
01:00:35,184 --> 01:00:38,053
Aw, Mom.

1321
01:00:41,557 --> 01:00:44,860
That's so nice.

1322
01:00:56,038 --> 01:00:57,572
Good morning.

1323
01:00:57,573 --> 01:01:01,275
Is it?
But I am glad you're up.

1324
01:01:01,276 --> 01:01:02,610
Thank you.

1325
01:01:02,611 --> 01:01:04,278
I was really glad to get
your note last night.

1326
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:05,847
That ornament is super cute.

1327
01:01:05,848 --> 01:01:09,317
You know, I have been
thinking about that.

1328
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:10,751
It should go in the back

1329
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:14,522
because it does not fit
my vision.

1330
01:01:14,523 --> 01:01:16,424
Okay.
Well, it's no use.

1331
01:01:16,425 --> 01:01:17,892
How can I be helpful?

1332
01:01:17,893 --> 01:01:20,628
Well, I have to spray paint
the banister gold,

1333
01:01:20,629 --> 01:01:22,597
then I have to go
and set up a meeting

1334
01:01:22,598 --> 01:01:25,399
with that incompetent bartender
about what

1335
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,335
our signature cocktail...
Oh, I'll settle that.

1336
01:01:27,336 --> 01:01:29,538
Is going to be, and... Emily?

1337
01:01:34,977 --> 01:01:37,411
Way to grab the reindeer
by the antlers.

1338
01:01:37,412 --> 01:01:40,448
I might have a shot at this.

1339
01:01:40,449 --> 01:01:42,417
Six hours to midnight?

1340
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:48,189
Okay, people.

1341
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,826
The judges will be here
at 7:00 sharp,

1342
01:01:51,827 --> 01:01:55,263
and I want everyone
to be whistling Christmas

1343
01:01:55,264 --> 01:01:58,266
out of their buttholes
when they get here.

1344
01:01:58,267 --> 01:01:59,834
Excuse my French.

1345
01:01:59,835 --> 01:02:02,336
Uh, who is this woman?

1346
01:02:02,337 --> 01:02:04,539
That's the competition.

1347
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:05,940
You can let her in the house,

1348
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:08,543
you can serve her
cocktails and canapés,

1349
01:02:08,544 --> 01:02:11,679
but do not let her
touch my trees.

1350
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,781
If she comes within

1351
01:02:13,782 --> 01:02:19,020
a 3-foot radius of my trees...

1352
01:02:19,021 --> 01:02:21,856
Then you have my permission
to use force.

1353
01:02:21,857 --> 01:02:23,624
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.

1354
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,560
Uh, look.
You need to talk to your mama.

1355
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:26,894
You are running out of time.

1356
01:02:26,895 --> 01:02:28,596
Does she look like someone
who's capable

1357
01:02:28,597 --> 01:02:30,097
of being talked to?

1358
01:02:30,098 --> 01:02:33,301
She's not gonna change, okay?
She's who she is.

1359
01:02:33,302 --> 01:02:35,636
I have a few questions
about Wyatt, though.

1360
01:02:35,637 --> 01:02:37,138
Uh, look.

1361
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:39,040
She might be more ready
to change than you think.

1362
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:41,776
Mm, absolutely not.
Impossible.

1363
01:02:41,777 --> 01:02:43,244
Here's my question, though.
Okay.

1364
01:02:43,245 --> 01:02:45,379
Like, let's say I do
write this letter to Santa

1365
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,948
tomorrow, right?

1366
01:02:46,949 --> 01:02:48,783
Okay, so like, then what
happens back in the real world?

1367
01:02:48,784 --> 01:02:49,917
Like, does my mom become normal?

1368
01:02:49,918 --> 01:02:51,786
Do I stand up to Ginger?

1369
01:02:51,787 --> 01:02:54,789
Does, like...
Will I be able to find Wyatt?

1370
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,858
Like, what exactly is the black
magic we're working with here?

1371
01:02:57,859 --> 01:02:59,227
Okay, okay, look, look.

1372
01:02:59,228 --> 01:03:01,362
You found him before,
you can find him again.

1373
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:03,064
And Ginger might surprise you.

1374
01:03:03,065 --> 01:03:04,699
And your mom, for that matter.

1375
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,367
All right, you're just saying
that to save your own ass.

1376
01:03:06,368 --> 01:03:07,835
No, no, no.

1377
01:03:07,836 --> 01:03:09,170
I'm saying it because I care
about you, all right?

1378
01:03:09,171 --> 01:03:11,539
And I'm pretty sure
that lady's hair

1379
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,608
was not made out of fruitcake.

1380
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:16,110
- Oh, damn, it's spreading.
- Yeah.

1381
01:03:16,111 --> 01:03:17,812
Look, I got to go
finish getting ready.

1382
01:03:17,813 --> 01:03:19,413
Lorraine is gonna blow a gasket

1383
01:03:19,414 --> 01:03:21,616
if I'm not "picture-perfect by
the time the judges get here."

1384
01:03:21,617 --> 01:03:23,784
I just don't think any
of this makes any sense to do.

1385
01:03:23,785 --> 01:03:25,486
It's not worth it.
Damn it!

1386
01:03:25,487 --> 01:03:27,622
Thought I was getting
through to these people.

1387
01:03:27,623 --> 01:03:29,725
Oh, humans!

1388
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,778
Enough.

1389
01:03:54,483 --> 01:03:58,719
<i>♪ Joy to the world,

01:04:16,138 --> 01:04:18,806
You remember my successful,

1396
01:04:18,807 --> 01:04:21,742
high SAT scoring daughter,
Emily?

1397
01:04:21,743 --> 01:04:23,911
Of course.
Nice to see you, Emily.

1398
01:04:23,912 --> 01:04:25,480
I love your dress.

1399
01:04:25,481 --> 01:04:28,549
Thank you so much!
It's actually my favorite.

1400
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,518
Oh.

1401
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:32,887
Unfortunately,
my daughter couldn't make it.

1402
01:04:32,888 --> 01:04:36,424
She's on duty again
in the Congo.

1403
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:38,726
Doctors Without Borders.

1404
01:04:38,727 --> 01:04:40,695
Such noble work.

1405
01:04:40,696 --> 01:04:43,264
Yes, she's a doctor.
Thank the Lord.

1406
01:04:43,265 --> 01:04:45,766
My daughter is dating a dentist.

1407
01:04:45,767 --> 01:04:47,301
Wow.

1408
01:04:47,302 --> 01:04:50,938
Mom, I'm actually not gonna
do this with you tonight.

1409
01:04:50,939 --> 01:04:53,909
Linda, good luck tonight.

1410
01:04:55,777 --> 01:04:57,946
My baby has jokes.

1411
01:04:59,548 --> 01:05:01,883
Oh, oh!

1412
01:05:01,884 --> 01:05:04,452
Oh, you must be
so proud of your mom.

1413
01:05:04,453 --> 01:05:06,053
What a perfect family.

1414
01:05:06,054 --> 01:05:07,688
We're announcing
the winner tomorrow,

1415
01:05:07,689 --> 01:05:09,290
and I'm sure you'll be pleased.

1416
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,225
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1417
01:05:11,226 --> 01:05:12,593
Have a good day.

1418
01:05:12,594 --> 01:05:15,396
Honey, why don't you take
a picture with Santa?

1419
01:05:15,397 --> 01:05:17,098
All right.

1420
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:19,634
What are you asking
Santa for, little missy?

1421
01:05:19,635 --> 01:05:21,035
I don't know.
I don't know.

1422
01:05:21,036 --> 01:05:22,403
Just take... can you take...
Okay, baby.

1423
01:05:22,404 --> 01:05:24,572
Here we go.
Thank you, darling.

1424
01:05:24,573 --> 01:05:26,073
It's so perfect.

1425
01:05:26,074 --> 01:05:29,410
Okay, all right,
all right, all right.

1426
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:31,012
Why you touch my girl like that?

1427
01:05:31,013 --> 01:05:32,580
I didn't touch her.

1428
01:05:32,581 --> 01:05:34,315
I just leaned a little bit,
and you took a picture.

1429
01:05:34,316 --> 01:05:36,117
I took a... I took a picture.

1430
01:05:36,118 --> 01:05:37,451
Get your ass in there,
go to work.

1431
01:05:37,452 --> 01:05:38,853
What's the matter with you?
Took a picture.

1432
01:05:38,854 --> 01:05:39,987
If you touch another
woman here today,

1433
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:41,957
I'ma kick your ass.

1434
01:05:46,662 --> 01:05:49,397
Emily.

1435
01:05:49,398 --> 01:05:52,166
Try to leave some canapés
for the guests.

1436
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:54,702
It's not like you have much room

1437
01:05:54,703 --> 01:05:57,204
to breathe in that dress.

1438
01:05:57,205 --> 01:05:59,540
Heaven forbid
you listen to me once.

1439
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:01,542
Did you even try the red one?

1440
01:06:01,543 --> 01:06:03,511
I'm so sorry, I have...

1441
01:06:03,512 --> 01:06:05,847
- Ugh!
- Thank you!

1442
01:06:12,621 --> 01:06:15,222
Hello, my love.

1443
01:06:15,223 --> 01:06:17,458
Oh, you must be kidding me.

1444
01:06:17,459 --> 01:06:20,494
Oh, I would never joke about
something as pure and natural

1445
01:06:20,495 --> 01:06:21,996
as my devotion for you.

1446
01:06:21,997 --> 01:06:23,931
I brought you this.

1447
01:06:23,932 --> 01:06:26,033
May I feed it to you
like the goddess you are?

1448
01:06:26,034 --> 01:06:29,470
Don't worry about it
because you're about to go!

1449
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:31,772
I said goodbye!

1450
01:06:31,773 --> 01:06:35,143
I said... what if I... good day!

1451
01:06:36,612 --> 01:06:38,412
Thank you.
Thanks for this.

1452
01:06:38,413 --> 01:06:39,513
That's sweet.

1453
01:06:39,514 --> 01:06:41,683
Portrait time!

1454
01:06:44,886 --> 01:06:46,588
Portrait time!

1455
01:06:48,223 --> 01:06:49,791
Come on.

1456
01:06:52,794 --> 01:06:54,795
Okay.

1457
01:06:54,796 --> 01:06:57,331
You ready?

1458
01:06:57,332 --> 01:06:59,700
Yeah.
Something is not right.

1459
01:06:59,701 --> 01:07:02,069
It's the dress isn't it?

1460
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:04,071
Baby, why don't you
just go up and change?

1461
01:07:04,072 --> 01:07:06,741
Do I just disgust you,
or is there anything

1462
01:07:06,742 --> 01:07:08,876
you actually like about me?

1463
01:07:08,877 --> 01:07:11,145
No, no nogtinis!

1464
01:07:11,146 --> 01:07:12,880
Lower your voice.
Everyone's watching.

1465
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:15,116
No, Lorraine!
You need to answer me.

1466
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:18,185
You're my daughter.
I love you.

1467
01:07:18,186 --> 01:07:20,354
But do you like me?

1468
01:07:20,355 --> 01:07:23,624
My dress is too tight.
I make too many jokes.

1469
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:24,992
I eat too many canapés.

1470
01:07:24,993 --> 01:07:26,560
What do you actually
like about me?

1471
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:29,363
Now is not the time
or the place, young lady.

1472
01:07:29,364 --> 01:07:31,766
I have actually just wasted
so much time

1473
01:07:31,767 --> 01:07:34,335
letting everyone
walk all over me.

1474
01:07:34,336 --> 01:07:36,737
My friends, my mom,
the radio station.

1475
01:07:36,738 --> 01:07:37,972
But enough!

1476
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:39,640
Have you ever once
thought about what

1477
01:07:39,641 --> 01:07:43,210
it was like for me to be
your daughter, Mrs. Perfect?

1478
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:46,881
What it's like for me to exist
while everyone around me

1479
01:07:46,882 --> 01:07:49,316
makes me feel like I don't
even deserve to love myself

1480
01:07:49,317 --> 01:07:50,918
because of the ass-backwards way

1481
01:07:50,919 --> 01:07:53,154
that this world judges women?

1482
01:07:53,155 --> 01:07:56,490
And every comment you make
just brings me right back

1483
01:07:56,491 --> 01:07:59,694
to being that shy
and insecure little girl

1484
01:07:59,695 --> 01:08:01,595
from freshman year.

1485
01:08:01,596 --> 01:08:04,865
She's always with me,

1486
01:08:04,866 --> 01:08:07,802
always telling me
to be small and quiet,

1487
01:08:07,803 --> 01:08:11,205
and telling me not to be honest
about how I'm feeling.

1488
01:08:11,206 --> 01:08:13,941
And I am exhausted!

1489
01:08:13,942 --> 01:08:16,377
That's why I don't
come back here!

1490
01:08:16,378 --> 01:08:19,146
I have only been
making suggestions.

1491
01:08:19,147 --> 01:08:22,783
Baby, it's time to listen.

1492
01:08:22,784 --> 01:08:26,153
Mom, you have spent a lifetime

1493
01:08:26,154 --> 01:08:28,989
suggesting everything
that was wrong with me,

1494
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:31,425
validating every single bully
I have ever had,

1495
01:08:31,426 --> 01:08:34,195
and all I wanted you to do
was just look at me one time

1496
01:08:34,196 --> 01:08:36,531
and suggest
what was right about me!

1497
01:08:39,134 --> 01:08:41,402
Why didn't you say anything?

1498
01:08:41,403 --> 01:08:43,838
Because as much as I
want to be close to you

1499
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,673
and tell you all of this stuff,

1500
01:08:45,674 --> 01:08:48,109
you are not
the easiest person to talk to.

1501
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:51,278
Oh, well, I wouldn't say that.

1502
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,547
Look, I learned
this week that talking

1503
01:08:53,548 --> 01:08:56,217
about your feelings is actually
really, really important,

1504
01:08:56,218 --> 01:08:57,985
and so is standing up
for yourself

1505
01:08:57,986 --> 01:09:00,054
and asking for what you want.

1506
01:09:00,055 --> 01:09:01,489
That's my girl.

1507
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:04,492
So there will be no more
of me doubting myself

1508
01:09:04,493 --> 01:09:07,194
and no more of me
not asking for what I want.

1509
01:09:07,195 --> 01:09:09,063
That is not who I am anymore.

1510
01:09:09,064 --> 01:09:12,600
Yes, partner!
Preach!

1511
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:16,103
Oh, bitch,
I know you not talking.

1512
01:09:16,104 --> 01:09:18,172
Ginger, you were my bully.

1513
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:20,207
Do you get that?

1514
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:22,877
And no, we are not over it.

1515
01:09:22,878 --> 01:09:25,179
I'm not over anything.

1516
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,014
And the messed up part
is I actually like you,

1517
01:09:27,015 --> 01:09:29,216
and we're friends now,
but being friends

1518
01:09:29,217 --> 01:09:30,618
means being honest.

1519
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:32,653
And you honestly need
to acknowledge

1520
01:09:32,654 --> 01:09:33,954
what you did to me.

1521
01:09:33,955 --> 01:09:35,756
And you need to apologize.

1522
01:09:35,757 --> 01:09:38,593
Maybe then we can be good.

1523
01:09:40,228 --> 01:09:42,229
No, no.
Let me tell you something.

1524
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:43,798
We are not in love.

1525
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:47,434
Go on somewhere and find
your happiness outside of me!

1526
01:09:47,435 --> 01:09:48,803
And you!

1527
01:09:48,804 --> 01:09:50,204
Wyatt!

1528
01:09:50,205 --> 01:09:51,739
How dare you!

1529
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:55,209
Why would you show up
in this insane Santa reality?

1530
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:57,645
Huh?
And the thing is, I like you.

1531
01:09:57,646 --> 01:09:59,013
So do me a favor, okay?

1532
01:09:59,014 --> 01:10:00,614
This isn't gonna make any sense,

1533
01:10:00,615 --> 01:10:03,450
but in a few days
when a really cute,

1534
01:10:03,451 --> 01:10:05,553
a little bit plump with a booty,

1535
01:10:05,554 --> 01:10:08,022
self-assured girl
comes up to you

1536
01:10:08,023 --> 01:10:10,024
and shoots her shot,
just say yes.

1537
01:10:10,025 --> 01:10:11,425
Huh?
Just say yes.

1538
01:10:11,426 --> 01:10:12,760
Because I
can flip my tongue over,

1539
01:10:12,761 --> 01:10:14,895
and only one in 10,000 people
can do that.

1540
01:10:14,896 --> 01:10:16,363
You're gonna miss out on that.

1541
01:10:16,364 --> 01:10:21,101
And I know that I sound angry,
but I am not mad at you!

1542
01:10:21,102 --> 01:10:22,970
And this tree!

1543
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:25,173
Move!

1544
01:10:28,577 --> 01:10:31,145
How dare you!
You stole my mom!

1545
01:10:31,146 --> 01:10:33,080
Okay, get it out.
Get it out.

1546
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:34,982
Yeah.

1547
01:10:34,983 --> 01:10:37,751
No, not my tree!
Not Goldy!

1548
01:10:37,752 --> 01:10:39,821
Not Goldy!

1549
01:10:41,756 --> 01:10:46,527
No, no, no!
Oh, that's not right.

1550
01:10:46,528 --> 01:10:49,064
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it!

1551
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,970
Ahh!

1552
01:10:55,971 --> 01:10:57,972
No.

1553
01:10:57,973 --> 01:11:00,040
<i>♪ Oh, I'm so happy ♪</i>

1554
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:02,109

1555
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:04,345
Peace out, kings and queens!

1556
01:11:04,346 --> 01:11:07,882
<i>♪ It's a celebration ♪</i>

01:11:07,883 --> 01:11:13,053
Oh, yeah, they definitely win

1558
01:11:13,054 --> 01:11:15,155
Oh!

1559
01:11:15,156 --> 01:11:18,559
- Oh, don't you say it.
- Say what?

1560
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,594
That you were right
about everything.

1561
01:11:20,595 --> 01:11:22,162
Okay, as much
as I like being right,

1562
01:11:22,163 --> 01:11:24,398
this is not bringing
me Christmas joy.

1563
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:26,200
You still got some time.
You think so?

1564
01:11:26,201 --> 01:11:27,868
- Yeah, go talk to her.
- Talk to her.

1565
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:30,037
Emily, oh!

1566
01:11:30,038 --> 01:11:32,539
Are we gonna?

1567
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,241
No, I'm gonna... yeah.

1568
01:11:34,242 --> 01:11:36,644
Make it right.

1569
01:11:38,246 --> 01:11:41,148
Okay!
Come on, DJ!

1570
01:11:41,149 --> 01:11:42,583
DJ!

1571
01:11:42,584 --> 01:11:45,619
All right!
Y'all better come on.

1572
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,755
Come on, uh, uh!

1573
01:11:47,756 --> 01:11:48,956
Come on.

1574
01:11:48,957 --> 01:11:50,591
Michael.
Michael.

1575
01:11:50,592 --> 01:11:52,660
Come on, you get in there.
Let me see what you got.

1576
01:11:52,661 --> 01:11:54,696
Hey, hey!

1577
01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:01,469
Oh, my God.

1578
01:12:05,373 --> 01:12:08,375
KLDA listeners, it's me, Emily,

1579
01:12:08,376 --> 01:12:10,010
and I'm finally

1580
01:12:10,011 --> 01:12:13,882
a boss-ass bitch.

1581
01:12:26,728 --> 01:12:29,096
I've said everything
I needed to say.

1582
01:12:29,097 --> 01:12:30,898
You're right.

1583
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:34,101
And I'm so glad that you had
a chance to say everything

1584
01:12:34,102 --> 01:12:38,205
you needed to say because I
have a few things to say too

1585
01:12:38,206 --> 01:12:40,241
if that's okay with you.

1586
01:12:40,242 --> 01:12:42,477
Go ahead.

1587
01:12:46,948 --> 01:12:48,616
You were right.

1588
01:12:48,617 --> 01:12:51,051
I tried to control everything,

1589
01:12:51,052 --> 01:12:54,321
to make everything perfect,

1590
01:12:54,322 --> 01:12:57,291
and that makes me
a terrible listener,

1591
01:12:57,292 --> 01:12:59,260
a terrible mother.

1592
01:12:59,261 --> 01:13:01,195
But let me say this,
you have to know

1593
01:13:01,196 --> 01:13:03,597
that I like you.

1594
01:13:03,598 --> 01:13:06,333
You're funny.
You're smart.

1595
01:13:06,334 --> 01:13:08,636
Oh, you're so funny sometimes,

1596
01:13:08,637 --> 01:13:10,771
the jokes you make
I don't even understand.

1597
01:13:10,772 --> 01:13:13,040
But that's not your fault.
That's my fault.

1598
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:15,776
Because I'm not funny.

1599
01:13:15,777 --> 01:13:19,280
You know, I thought
that if I could just

1600
01:13:19,281 --> 01:13:23,484
make everything perfect,
make myself perfect,

1601
01:13:23,485 --> 01:13:28,389
just push harder, you guys would

1602
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:32,326
be proud of me.

1603
01:13:32,327 --> 01:13:36,330
Because I could
take care of you.

1604
01:13:36,331 --> 01:13:39,800
But you're already perfect
because you're you.

1605
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:44,205
And I should have been
telling you that all the time.

1606
01:13:44,206 --> 01:13:49,143
I just wonder now,

1607
01:13:49,144 --> 01:13:50,745
is it too late?

1608
01:13:52,747 --> 01:13:54,348
No.

1609
01:13:54,349 --> 01:13:55,916
Of course it's not too late.

1610
01:13:55,917 --> 01:13:57,918
It's Christmas,
for Christ's sakes.

1611
01:13:57,919 --> 01:14:00,321
It's never too late.

1612
01:14:00,322 --> 01:14:02,691
Okay, okay.

1613
01:14:04,759 --> 01:14:06,460
Geez.

1614
01:14:06,461 --> 01:14:11,165
Right,
that's a tough act to follow.

1615
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:14,201
But you're right, Em.

1616
01:14:14,202 --> 01:14:18,873
You're... you are
so totally beyond right.

1617
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,215
I know I bullied you.

1618
01:14:28,216 --> 01:14:31,619
God, I was so mean.

1619
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,487
It's really hard for me
to think about sometimes,

1620
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:37,825
but I've been talking
about it in therapy, so...

1621
01:14:37,826 --> 01:14:39,760
I was an insecure piece of crap,

1622
01:14:39,761 --> 01:14:42,896
and I took it out on you,
and you didn't deserve that.

1623
01:14:42,897 --> 01:14:45,232
You're so beautiful.

1624
01:14:45,233 --> 01:14:47,402
I'm so sorry if I
ever made you doubt that.

1625
01:14:49,437 --> 01:14:51,538
You're my best bitch, bitch!

1626
01:14:51,539 --> 01:14:54,476
Oh, my God, come here.

1627
01:15:00,115 --> 01:15:01,816
Get it, girl.

1628
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:04,351
- Hey.
- Hey.

1629
01:15:04,352 --> 01:15:06,320
Hey.
Enjoying the party?

1630
01:15:06,321 --> 01:15:08,088
Oh, yeah,
I'm having a good time.

1631
01:15:08,089 --> 01:15:10,557
Someone assaulted a tree.

1632
01:15:10,558 --> 01:15:12,059
I know.
I saw that.

1633
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,227
She's crazy.
Yeah.

1634
01:15:13,228 --> 01:15:14,528
She's unhinged.

1635
01:15:14,529 --> 01:15:16,096
I wouldn't let
that person go to a forest

1636
01:15:16,097 --> 01:15:18,632
because then that... you're
in the tree's territory, so...

1637
01:15:18,633 --> 01:15:22,102
- She gon' get jumped.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1638
01:15:22,103 --> 01:15:23,537
I just...

1639
01:15:23,538 --> 01:15:25,806
I just want to say
I loved how you stood up

1640
01:15:25,807 --> 01:15:28,275
to everyone in there, and I...

1641
01:15:28,276 --> 01:15:29,943
I think you're incredible.

1642
01:15:29,944 --> 01:15:32,246
And I'm not really sure
what you meant when you asked

1643
01:15:32,247 --> 01:15:34,715
about this mystery person
who might ask me a question,

1644
01:15:34,716 --> 01:15:36,950
but I will definitely say yes.

1645
01:15:36,951 --> 01:15:39,853
And if I'm being honest,
it kind of sounds like

1646
01:15:39,854 --> 01:15:42,256
an invitation to an orgy,
which I've never done.

1647
01:15:42,257 --> 01:15:44,591
Not to say I'm not,
you know, I can't be a freak.

1648
01:15:44,592 --> 01:15:47,695
I'm a freak.
I get freaky.

1649
01:15:47,696 --> 01:15:50,230
Not like freaky, ugh.
Like freaky, hmm.

1650
01:15:50,231 --> 01:15:52,533
But rated on a scale?

1651
01:15:52,534 --> 01:15:54,368
A moderate six.

1652
01:15:54,369 --> 01:15:56,136
You know.
I could work with that.

1653
01:15:56,137 --> 01:15:57,705
Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:15:57,706 --> 01:16:01,909
Well, good, because whenever
you meet an Emily, you know,

1655
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:03,911
you kind of want
to hang on to them.

1656
01:16:03,912 --> 01:16:08,449
So you know,
I might push it to a seven.

1657
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:09,850
We'll get you to eight.

1658
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:11,919
Ooh!

1659
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,222
Oh.

1660
01:16:22,664 --> 01:16:25,265
Emily, you want
to go back into the party

1661
01:16:25,266 --> 01:16:28,168
and have a good time?

1662
01:16:28,169 --> 01:16:30,437
Yes.
Um, yeah.

1663
01:16:30,438 --> 01:16:32,039
Yep.

1664
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,440
But I'm gonna be in
in a little bit.

1665
01:16:33,441 --> 01:16:34,875
I have to go...

1666
01:16:34,876 --> 01:16:36,176
I actually have
to go do something.

1667
01:16:36,177 --> 01:16:38,145
- I got a job to do.
- Yeah, totally, totally.

1668
01:16:38,146 --> 01:16:39,713
I'll meet you in there, though.

1669
01:16:39,714 --> 01:16:42,583
- All right.
- We'll get you at a nine.

1670
01:16:42,584 --> 01:16:45,020
Okay.

1671
01:16:47,422 --> 01:16:50,324
It really is a lovely tree.

1672
01:16:50,325 --> 01:16:52,292
You okay?

1673
01:16:52,293 --> 01:16:54,396
I think I will be.

1674
01:16:56,331 --> 01:16:59,800
You know, we've had
an opening at the rummy table

1675
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:01,702
if that doesn't sound too awful.

1676
01:17:01,703 --> 01:17:03,737
Oh, I'd love that!

1677
01:17:03,738 --> 01:17:06,774
Oh, if you don't mind
messy pajamas

1678
01:17:06,775 --> 01:17:08,709
and too many Sancerres.

1679
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:12,312
Oh, I love Sancerres,
and the messier the better.

1680
01:17:12,313 --> 01:17:17,184
I am just exhausted
with all this perfection stuff.

1681
01:17:17,185 --> 01:17:19,052
Could you help me with this?

1682
01:17:19,053 --> 01:17:21,121
Sure, hold these.

1683
01:17:21,122 --> 01:17:24,024
Okay, I got it.

1684
01:17:24,025 --> 01:17:26,360
There you go.
Oh, I think it's right.

1685
01:17:26,361 --> 01:17:27,595
It's perfect.

1686
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:36,062
What, what, what, what, what.

1687
01:17:36,063 --> 01:17:38,665
Oh.

1688
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,801
You ready to do this?

1689
01:17:41,802 --> 01:17:44,872
Yes, did you leave the rest
of B2K at the party?

1690
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:49,208
You know,
Omarion didn't show up.

1691
01:17:49,209 --> 01:17:51,277
- Didn't he?
- Yeah, yeah.

1692
01:17:51,278 --> 01:17:53,413
All right, here you go.

1693
01:17:53,414 --> 01:17:55,982
- You already know.
- Let's do this.

1694
01:17:55,983 --> 01:17:58,017
Let's do it.

1695
01:18:01,822 --> 01:18:04,357
Okay.

1696
01:18:04,358 --> 01:18:07,693
<i>Dear Santa, wow, what a ride,</i>

1697
01:18:07,694 --> 01:18:10,229
<i>you mischievous SOB, you.</i>

1698
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:14,667
<i>Anyway, what I really wanted
to say was, thank you.</i>

1699
01:18:14,668 --> 01:18:16,235
<i>I found my voice.</i>

1700
01:18:16,236 --> 01:18:19,038
<i>Ironic for someone
who wants to be a DJ.</i>

1701
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:22,842
<i>Thing is,
it was in me the whole time.</i>

1702
01:18:22,843 --> 01:18:25,611
<i>I just let the world
tell me it wasn't.</i>

1703
01:18:25,612 --> 01:18:30,249
<i>PS, Wolf did a stellar job.</i>

1704
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,985
<i>Thanks for reminding me
that I'm a queen.</i>

1705
01:18:32,986 --> 01:18:36,823
<i>B-T-dubs, if you want to keep
that dance circle thing,</i>

1706
01:18:36,824 --> 01:18:39,058
<i>I'm cool with that.</i>

1707
01:18:39,059 --> 01:18:41,127
Here goes everything.

1708
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:45,164
There's one more thing
we need to do.

1709
01:18:45,165 --> 01:18:47,533
Okay.

1710
01:18:47,534 --> 01:18:49,502
Ready?

1711
01:18:49,503 --> 01:18:52,406
Let's do it together.
One, two, three.

1712
01:18:53,874 --> 01:18:55,508
<i>♪ It's a celebration ♪</i>

1713
01:18:55,509 --> 01:18:57,810
Out of my way.

1714
01:18:57,811 --> 01:19:00,813
<i>♪ Get ready
for the holidays ♪</i>

1715
01:19:00,814 --> 01:19:04,717
<i>♪ Yeah it's a celebration ♪</i>

1716
01:19:08,388 --> 01:19:11,691
<i>♪ It's what we make it ♪</i>

1717
01:19:11,692 --> 01:19:16,596
Yeah!

1718
01:19:16,597 --> 01:19:20,066
I am a boss-ass bitch!

1719
01:19:20,067 --> 01:19:21,767
Boss-ass bitch!

1720
01:19:21,768 --> 01:19:23,769
All: Boss-ass bitch!

1721
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:27,107
Boss-ass bitch!
Whoo!

1722
01:19:29,443 --> 01:19:32,812
Emily, breakfast!

1723
01:19:32,813 --> 01:19:36,782
Oh, damn, it didn't work.

1724
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:38,251
Emily.

1725
01:19:38,252 --> 01:19:41,621
Oh, no, the Tooth Fairy!

1726
01:19:41,622 --> 01:19:43,656
Am I gonna turn into fruitcake?

1727
01:19:43,657 --> 01:19:45,758
Oh, my God, that is
a terrible way to die.

1728
01:19:45,759 --> 01:19:47,426
Why would I write that?

1729
01:19:47,427 --> 01:19:49,362
Emily, it worked!

1730
01:19:49,363 --> 01:19:51,497
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!

1731
01:19:51,498 --> 01:19:53,633
I mean, I like to think
that I could take a little bit

1732
01:19:53,634 --> 01:19:56,102
of the credit, but you did it.

1733
01:19:56,103 --> 01:19:57,904
Oh, wow, okay.

1734
01:19:57,905 --> 01:20:01,340
Yeah, like... look,
your job, the apartment,

1735
01:20:01,341 --> 01:20:05,378
your cat, it's all back,
and no one's the wiser.

1736
01:20:05,379 --> 01:20:09,415
Yeah, and now you just know
how to ask for what you need.

1737
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:14,220
And maybe, just maybe, you hate
Christmas just a little less.

1738
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:16,289
Aww.

1739
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:18,691
But, uh, yeah.

1740
01:20:18,692 --> 01:20:20,928
This is me saying goodbye.

1741
01:20:23,463 --> 01:20:25,431
I just, uh...

1742
01:20:25,432 --> 01:20:27,134
I just don't know how.

1743
01:20:31,204 --> 01:20:34,441
I'm really, really
gonna miss you too.

1744
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:38,511
Hey, if you ever want
to write Santa, just...

1745
01:20:38,512 --> 01:20:40,079
Oh, absolutely not.

1746
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,616
I am completely done
writing to Santa.

1747
01:20:43,617 --> 01:20:46,586
But I'm gonna go in,
and I'm gonna ask

1748
01:20:46,587 --> 01:20:47,954
for my show today.

1749
01:20:47,955 --> 01:20:49,689
And I want you
to come on as a guest

1750
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:54,393
because you are really, really
incredible at giving advice.

1751
01:20:54,394 --> 01:20:56,662
You know what?

1752
01:20:56,663 --> 01:20:59,332
You weren't a pain
in my ass after all.

1753
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:02,134
Yeah.
Thank you.

1754
01:21:02,135 --> 01:21:04,204
Mm-hmm.

1755
01:21:12,212 --> 01:21:18,150

1756
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:20,019
Whoa.

1757
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:24,123
It smells and looks delicious
down here, but I can't stay.

1758
01:21:24,124 --> 01:21:27,159
I gotta run to work.
Right, your show.

1759
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,761
Yeah.

1760
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:31,163
But I'm gonna come right back
and celebrate with you after.

1761
01:21:31,164 --> 01:21:32,765
Really?

1762
01:21:32,766 --> 01:21:34,834
But you always work
on Christmas.

1763
01:21:34,835 --> 01:21:37,003
I know,
but sometimes, things change.

1764
01:21:37,004 --> 01:21:38,170
Yeah.

1765
01:21:38,171 --> 01:21:40,106
Wait, where'd you get that hat?

1766
01:21:40,107 --> 01:21:44,010
From a very special friend
who wants me

1767
01:21:44,011 --> 01:21:45,978
to remember him by it

1768
01:21:45,979 --> 01:21:49,649
and all the things
that have happened this week.

1769
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:52,451
When you come home this evening,

1770
01:21:52,452 --> 01:21:54,987
can we talk more?

1771
01:21:54,988 --> 01:21:59,359
Well, actually, can you
talk more and I listen more?

1772
01:22:01,595 --> 01:22:04,397
Yeah.
Yeah, I would love that.

1773
01:22:04,398 --> 01:22:06,198
I would really love that.

1774
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:07,833
Aw, merry Christmas, sweetie.

1775
01:22:07,834 --> 01:22:09,902
Merry Christmas, Mom.

1776
01:22:09,903 --> 01:22:13,139
This is Ken Spicer saying,
it's been a blast.

01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:23,816
Hey, you got a second?

1780
01:22:23,817 --> 01:22:25,918
Can it wait?

1781
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:27,520
I'm trying
to catch a plane to Cabo,

1782
01:22:27,521 --> 01:22:29,355
if you know what I mean.

1783
01:22:29,356 --> 01:22:31,791
Actually, it can't.

1784
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:33,993
Also, if that's
a sexual innuendo,

1785
01:22:33,994 --> 01:22:37,129
you keep that to yourself.

1786
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:39,632
Um...

1787
01:22:43,136 --> 01:22:46,172
So I...

1788
01:22:46,173 --> 01:22:49,375
So I know that you
gave your show to Janice,

1789
01:22:49,376 --> 01:22:55,681
and congratulations to her,
but you still own the station,

1790
01:22:55,682 --> 01:23:00,720
and you and I both know that
there is one more slot left

1791
01:23:00,721 --> 01:23:03,723
for an hour-long show,

1792
01:23:03,724 --> 01:23:07,728
and I'm asking you
for that show.

1793
01:23:10,497 --> 01:23:14,066
Being your producer
has been really great,

1794
01:23:14,067 --> 01:23:18,003
but I'm better than that.

1795
01:23:18,004 --> 01:23:20,139
The meter spikes
every time I chime in

1796
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:22,374
on your show because I'm...

1797
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:25,077
I'm funny and I'm smart.

1798
01:23:25,078 --> 01:23:28,714
And we'll call it "Ask Emily."

1799
01:23:28,715 --> 01:23:31,418
What do you say?

1800
01:23:34,254 --> 01:23:37,623
Nice to have you
in the game, Emily.

1801
01:23:37,624 --> 01:23:40,826
Glad you finally showed up.

1802
01:23:40,827 --> 01:23:42,195
Here I am.

1803
01:23:44,064 --> 01:23:46,465
So I can take that as a yes?

1804
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:47,967
Yes.

1805
01:23:47,968 --> 01:23:49,969

- Hi.

1812
01:24:23,036 --> 01:24:25,604
You know, my last name
is actually Snowmyn?

1813
01:24:25,605 --> 01:24:27,306
No kidding.

1814
01:24:27,307 --> 01:24:29,909
I swear to God,
Wyatt Snowmyn, at your service.

1815
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:31,710
What a coincidence.

1816
01:24:31,711 --> 01:24:33,279
- And you, uh...
- Oh.

1817
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:37,016
- Your name?
- Emily Harris.

1818
01:24:37,017 --> 01:24:39,718
I'm a Sagittarius.
I just turned 31.

1819
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:42,021
I'm a big fan of miming

1820
01:24:42,022 --> 01:24:44,557
and Christmas themed
craft cocktails

1821
01:24:44,558 --> 01:24:47,927
with terrible names.

1822
01:24:47,928 --> 01:24:51,330
Well then, you're going to...

1823
01:24:51,331 --> 01:24:53,599
Ah, heart?

1824
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,000
A little drink I call

1825
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:58,470
the Santa Clausmopolitan.

1826
01:24:58,471 --> 01:25:01,074
Do you want to go out with me?

1827
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:05,945
I don't know why,
but I have a strong feeling

1828
01:25:05,946 --> 01:25:07,947
I should say yes.

1829
01:25:07,948 --> 01:25:10,282
Mm, I don't know why either,

1830
01:25:10,283 --> 01:25:13,385
but you should
follow that maybe.

1831
01:25:13,386 --> 01:25:15,087
Yes.

1832
01:25:15,088 --> 01:25:17,423
Absolutely yes.

1833
01:25:23,797 --> 01:25:27,833
Well, I bet you were anxious
to get back to kids' gifts.

1834
01:25:27,834 --> 01:25:30,502
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

1835
01:25:30,503 --> 01:25:32,471
You might think
I'm pulling your chain,

1836
01:25:32,472 --> 01:25:34,974
but I think I want
to continue doing

1837
01:25:34,975 --> 01:25:36,942
this whole helping people job.

1838
01:25:36,943 --> 01:25:39,278
And why is that?

1839
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:42,448
Well, you were right, okay?

1840
01:25:42,449 --> 01:25:44,984
I was selfish,
and I was really dismissing

1841
01:25:44,985 --> 01:25:47,052
the virtue of kindness.

1842
01:25:47,053 --> 01:25:49,388
I really like helping people.
Ah!

1843
01:25:49,389 --> 01:25:52,424
Oh, Wolfie!
Yes you do!

1844
01:25:52,425 --> 01:25:54,326
Wolfie, I knew it.
I knew it!

1845
01:25:54,327 --> 01:25:56,263
I didn't know it.
I was hoping, though.

1846
01:25:57,731 --> 01:25:59,365
Yeah, whoo!
Whoo!

1847
01:25:59,366 --> 01:26:02,135
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Wolfie.

1848
01:26:06,506 --> 01:26:08,140

1849
01:26:16,883 --> 01:26:17,984
Oh.

01:26:22,155 --> 01:26:25,557

KLDA Nation,
did you get everything

1867
01:27:11,771 --> 01:27:12,972
you asked for this year?

1868
01:27:12,973 --> 01:27:14,239
I know I did.

1869
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,308
And great news,

1870
01:27:16,309 --> 01:27:19,745
tonight and every night,
I'm gonna be coming at you

1871
01:27:19,746 --> 01:27:22,214
with my own show, "Ask Emily."

1872
01:27:22,215 --> 01:27:24,216
We'll spend
an entire hour together

1873
01:27:24,217 --> 01:27:25,851
talking and listening.

1874
01:27:25,852 --> 01:27:29,254
You can tell me your worries,
tell me your wishes,

1875
01:27:29,255 --> 01:27:31,557
and you can ask
for what you want.

1876
01:27:31,558 --> 01:27:33,659
And I'm gonna ask you
to bear with me

1877
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:36,895
because I'm about to get real
vulnerable up in this piece.

1878
01:27:36,896 --> 01:27:40,266
So let's start it off right
with our first caller.

1879
01:27:42,102 --> 01:27:44,169
Hi, you're on the air
with Emily.

1880
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:46,505
What's your name,
and what's your problem?

1881
01:27:46,506 --> 01:27:49,475
<i>Linda, and I have
a game night emergency.</i>

1882
01:27:49,476 --> 01:27:53,979
<i>But also,
I'm so proud of you, honey.</i>

1883
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:56,983
Hi, Mom.
What's your question?
