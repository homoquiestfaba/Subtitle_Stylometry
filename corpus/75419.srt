00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:31,621
(man) Words are cheap.

3
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:34,455
Words come and go.

4
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:43,129
All I wanted from her was a gesture.

5
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:52,936
Now, 5 million dollars withdrawn from
Miss CEO's account...

6
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:55,311
that's a gesture.

7
00:00:55,515 --> 00:01:00,475
See, now, that's...
that's a grand gesture. I like that.

8
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:07,485
I'm here. Now what?

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,152
The door's open.

10
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:31,679
(woman) In our developing story,
search continues for Linda Delacroix,

11
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:34,515
president and CEO of the
Big Top Burger chain.

12
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:36,680
She was abducted from her
home three days ago,

13
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:39,987
and the suspect is believed to be a
former employee of Big Top Industries.

14
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,027
Sources say former...

15
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:42,527
Show me.

16
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:45,530

the Delacroix house...

17
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,363
Show me the money.

00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:55,541
If I had known it would be this easy,

20
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,701
I would have lost my mind a long time ago.

21
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:59,412
Confirm the exact amount.

22
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:00,504
$5,088...

23
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,878
No, no, no. Write it. Write it down.

24
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,641
Here, put it in writing.

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,456
How does it feel to hold a
person's life in your hand?

27
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:18,895
So where is she?

Hello?

00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:26,567
(Harry) Say hello to your knight
in shining armor, Linda.

32
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,571
(Linda)
Please help me.

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,905
(Linda) Why are you doing this to me?
(Harry) Linda, stop whining.

34
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:38,748
(Linda) Please whatever you want. Help me.
(Harry) I am the butterfly, and you, Linda,
are the desperate moth

35
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:41,582
circling the... the flame.

00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,246
[dial tone]

37
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:45,917
Put the money in the barbecue.

38
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:48,822
Go ahead.

39
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:51,090
(man)
Team, move into position.

40
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:53,758
(Harry)
Just put it all in.

41
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,425
It's just money.

42
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:57,595
(Harry)
All of it.

43
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:04,610
Now, what's in that number?

44
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:12,106
Two years' missed salary,
profit participation, bonuses, hmm...

45
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,776
and got to pay for the power lunches.

46
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,856
So what's in a number?
What's in a number?

47
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,791
You know what?
Maybe nothing is in a number.

48
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,761
Maybe a number is just a number.

49
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,798
I don't get it.
Why are you burning it all?

50
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:28,299
(Harry) You know, anyone who says
that you can't take it with you...

51
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:29,464
(man)
FBI! FBI!

52
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:30,298
Drop the weapon!

53
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:30,961
Put it down!

54
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:33,969

Get back! Get back!

Bang goes Harry. Bang goes Linda.

56
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,441
Put it down!

57
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,809
Get back! We haven't got her yet!

You better hurry.

Time and tide wait for no man.

61
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:57,161
If you're gonna do it,
don't take her with you.

62
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,722
All I wanted was a gesture.

John, get Curt back in here.

Hello?

70
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,188
Miss Delacroix, where are you?

71
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:27,351
I'm in the trunk of his car.

72
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:28,189
You're gonna be okay.

73
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,024
(Linda)
You have to help me, please.

74
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,366
We got her cell phone
signal triangulated.

00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,527

77
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:54,549
(Linda)
I hear water.

78
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:55,679
What do you mean, you hear water?

79
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,053
I hear it under me.

80
00:04:58,124 --> 00:04:59,716
(Linda)
It's moving the car.

81
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,228
(man)
Pull over to the side of the road.

00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:15,233
So much water is coming in.

85
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:16,070
(Driver)
She's in the water.

86
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:18,076
She's by the water.
What time is high tide?

87
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:19,236
High tide is now.

88
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:20,574
Linda, think back.

89
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,740
Did you hear, feel,
sense anything else?

90
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,747
(Linda)
I can't remember.

91
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:25,408
(Driver)
Linda, you have to try.

92
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:29,744
(Linda) I can remember feeling metal
underneath me like a bridge or something.

93
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,257
(Driver)
Guys, bridges.

94
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:32,484
(man)
Bridges, bridges.

95
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:34,253
There's two of them,
but they're a few miles apart.

96
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:36,090
We'll take the north.
You take the south.

97
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:39,094
(police) I've got a possible stolen
vehicle heading eastbound.

98
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:00,247
Oh no!

99
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,459
(Linda) Water's coming in.

00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:17,129
[tires screeching]

101
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:24,708
Have you guys got a reading?

102
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,745
The signals just merged.
You should be right there.

103
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:27,472
Linda.

104
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,815
You have to hurry.

105
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:31,483
Trust me.

106
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,779
[boat horn blowing]

107
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:33,819
We're very close.

[tires squealing]

109
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,761
Linda, can you hear this?

110
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:52,532
[boat horn blowing]

111
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,232
Can you hear the boat horn?

112
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:56,605
Linda!

113
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:37,883
Will he pull through?

114
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,078
It's unlikely he'll
make it through another day.

115
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,740
It was just sex.

116
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:06,745
You should have let it go at that.

117
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,411
I was always the butterfly,
and you were always the moth.

118
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:17,085
And now it's time to embrace the flame.
