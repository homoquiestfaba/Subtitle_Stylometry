1
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:10,818
Can I have a beer, please?

2
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:18,425
Okay. Uh... <i>Cerveza.</i>

3
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:23,430
<i>Grande. Por favor.</i>
Big one.

4
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:34,742
<i>Cerveza.</i>

5
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:37,078
<i>Grande.</i>

6
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:45,520
Oh, yeah.

7
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,968
One more.

8
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:03,838
<i>No hablo inglés, gringo.</i>

9
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,041
<i>Uno mas.</i>

10
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:13,981
And I'm not a gringo.
Gringos are American.

11
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:15,716
<i>No inglés.</i>

12
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,384
No, I don't speak Spanish.

13
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,057
I don't know
what you're saying, mate.

14
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,077
No, thanks. I don't--
I don't-- I don't drink.

15
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,745
<i>Esto está en el casa.</i>

16
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,615
I don't drink.
No, thank you.

17
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,116
Tequila.
I know what it is.

18
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,219
I just... No. <i>Gracias.</i>

19
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,054
<i>Irrespetuoso.</i>

20
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,962
You know what?
Fuck it.

21
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,898
Why not?
I'm already dead anyway.

22
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,999
<i>Uno tequila.</i>

23
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,334
<i>Órale!</i>

24
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,368
Oh, that you understand.

25
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,574
<i>Salud.</i>

26
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,009
Cheers, big ears.

27
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,347
Whoo!

28
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:11,098
All right, uh...

29
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,615
<i>Hola.</i>
Come on. Keep going.

30
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,284
You speak English?

31
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,685
<i>Poquito.</i>

32
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,148
<i>Háganse a un lado, muchachos.</i>

33
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,520
<i>Hasta la vista.</i>

34
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,273
Sorry.

35
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,939
I don't speak Spanish.

36
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,875
Troublemaker.

37
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,456
<i>If any of</i>
<i>your kangaroo bullshit</i>

38
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:33,294
<i>comes back to bite you</i>
<i>and my daughter is involved...</i>

39
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:37,464
<i>well, I think we both know</i>
<i>how that one ends, yeah?</i>

40
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,617
Hey, gringo!
You're here.

41
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:04,485
I work here.
Questionable.

42
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:07,756
All right. Where
do you want me?
In the back of my limo.

43
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,423
You're a cheeky fuck,
you know that?

44
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:10,791
Watch the door, <i>el gringo.</i>

45
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,761
Gringos are American, Javi.

46
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:13,861
So?

47
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,462
So where am I from?

48
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:16,698
Austria?

49
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,332
England?

50
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:22,002
Australia. I'm only kidding.
I'm only kidding. Relax.

51
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:23,971
You just gonna
take up space

52
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:27,542
or actually uh, you know,
security guard?

53
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:28,976
All depends.
On?

54
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,945
On when Javi gets me a beer.

55
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,948
Nice precedent to set here.

56
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:37,519
Gotta keep
the employees happy.

57
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,588
Oh, yeah,
you're a poster boy for happy.

58
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:41,723
Yeah.

59
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:46,260
Señor Happy, looks like
you're on the clock.

60
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,195
What'd you say?
You want some?

61
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,264
Little shit.

62
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,932
Okay.

63
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,469
Chill. Relax.

64
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:58,439
Do not spit in this.

65
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,742
- Hey!
- Mommy!

66
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,511
Okay.

67
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,148
Here we go again.

68
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,018
I know, but I love it
when he does this.

69
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,623
Damn it, Hector!

70
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,343
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

71
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:44,218
Okay, everybody,
here's the skinny.

72
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,321
In a couple of seconds,
Hector here is gonna wake up

73
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:50,124
and he's gonna realize he has
a gun pointed to his head.

74
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,226
That's when I will
stand him up at gunpoint,

75
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,395
grab the backpack
that I came here for,

76
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,499
and slowly, him and I
will walk towards the door.
<i>Bien?</i>

77
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,743
Hey.
Morning, sunshine.

78
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:11,345
Okay. Up we go. Up we go.

79
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,148
All right. Grab the bag.

80
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,418
There. Thank you.

81
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:20,588
Now you all seem to understand
English pretty fucking well,

82
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,289
so I don't think
I need to spell out

83
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,793
what happens
if there are any sudden moves.

84
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:29,263
Bag, please.

85
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,468
Okay. Go, go, go, go!
Whoo!

86
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:54,689
Jackpot, baby! Look.
How much?

87
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,558
All of it.

88
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,793
<i>Bebe estás sangrando.</i>

89
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:01,128
Huh?
You're bleeding.

90
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:08,937
Babe, I-- I don't understand
what you're saying.

91
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,079
Sorry.

92
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:34,394
My head, bro!

93
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,130
What the fuck
was that for?

94
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,066
You boys are making
the tequila sick.

95
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,168
What's the point
of coming to Mexico?

96
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,403
Culture. Beautiful sights.

97
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,072
Yeah?
Yeah.

98
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:48,710
Boo.

99
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:53,480
Yeah, fuck you.
Eat shit!

100
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,002
See you around like a donut...

101
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,670
See ya round
like a donut, fellas!

102
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,975
Baby. Baby, wake up.

103
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,810
Wake up. Baby!

104
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,648
Baby?

105
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,487
Wake up.

106
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:34,856
Baby, wake up!

107
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:37,324
We gotta run! Now!

108
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,960
Now!

109
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,494
We gotta move!

110
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:47,902
Faster, baby.

111
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:52,406
Babe, stay down.

112
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:55,743
Great.

113
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:57,344
Don't move.

114
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,532
You're alive.

115
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,273
Oh, my head.

116
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:28,375
Yeah, that hurt.

117
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:33,347
It's dead in here, <i>papi.</i>
We need some <i>música.</i>

118
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,228
Can you, um-- Can you
change the song, please?

119
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,831
Oh, come on.
She's one of yours.

120
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,231
Javi.

121
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,834
Relax.

122
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:57,237
Better?
Yeah.

123
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:00,207
Yo, how'd we do?

124
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,110
Not bad for a Tuesday.

125
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,310
And how'd I do?

126
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,279
Oh. Do bouncers get tipped?

127
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,883
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
How much
do they get tipped?

128
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:15,990
Beer money.

129
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:17,190
<i>Gracias.</i>

130
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,826
You keep kicking out
these frat boys

131
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,293
before they drunk enough
to tip, <i>papi.</i>

132
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,195
That's exactly why I'm here.

133
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,666
Who the hell
put this shit on?

134
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,835
Not me.
Mmm.

135
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,873
Oh, no.
Don't put it on me.

136
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,376
<i>The point of you being here</i>
<i>is to prevent any trouble.</i>

137
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,980
<i>That's what I do.</i>
<i>I prevent trouble.</i>

138
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,916
<i>Fine line,</i> cabrón.
<i>Not drunk enough, and they take</i>

139
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,952
<i>their big, green, beautiful</i>
<i>dollars down the street.</i>
<i>And if they're too drunk--</i>

140
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:46,754
<i>Are you paying attention?</i>
<i>This is about you.</i>

141
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,488
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>They fuck up my bar</i>

142
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:50,558
<i>by you using them</i>
<i>to mop the floor.</i>

143
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:54,562
<i>So a bouncer,</i>
<i>and a cleaner.</i>

144
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,831
<i>How can you go wrong?</i>

145
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,368
<i>You're so hard-core, bitch.</i>

146
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,871
<i>It's my bar, bitch.</i>

147
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:07,407
<i>One for you.</i>

148
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,242
<i>And one for me.</i>

149
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:11,244
One for you.

150
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:13,114
To us.

151
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:18,519
There he is.
<i>Cabrón.</i>
Ah!

152
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:35,937
<i>Uy, uy, uy.</i>

153
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:42,810
Esteban?

154
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,882
See you tomorrow.

155
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:51,652
Not-- Not if I see you.

156
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:54,055
Not if I see you what?
Mm-hmm.

157
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,791
First. Not if I see...

158
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,027
Never mind.

159
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:01,629
Good night, <i>papi.</i>

160
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:48,843
You sound
sort of funny for a gringo.

161
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,245
That's because
I'm not a gringo.

162
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,281
I told you that already,
Mom.

163
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,117
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

164
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,521
You traveled a very far way
to Mexico. Why? Why Mexico?

165
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:03,157
I-- Yeah.
I know why Mexico.

166
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,425
But why stay here,
besides my daughter?

167
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:09,997
I feel like America
would suit you better.

168
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:13,034
The land of hopes and dreams.

169
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,102
That's why you came there
in the first place, no?

170
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:18,072
That's where everybody goes
when they're running
from something.

171
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:19,607
And you?

172
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:23,978
You seem like the type of gringo
that's always running
from something.

173
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,881
I don't know what, though.

174
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,816
Again, not a gringo.

175
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,619
That's not really the point,
<i>blanco.</i>

176
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:35,990
You left Australia because
you were running away.

177
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:37,357
Broken family?

178
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,727
Maybe, but no,
that's not it.

179
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,799
Mmm. Oh.

180
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:49,136
To find yourself, or maybe
to run away from yourself.

181
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:54,575
Ay, but wherever you go,
there you are.

182
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,778
That's a bit cliché.
Mm-hmm.

183
00:22:57,912 --> 00:23:00,681
<i>Donde quiera que vaya,</i>
<i>ahí estás.</i>

184
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:03,483
It sounds better
in Spanish, <i>verdad?</i>

185
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:05,052
Everything sounds better
in Spanish.

186
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:10,791
Mmm. You moved to America
to find the American dream.

187
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:15,096
And yet, you end up
working as a drug mule

188
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,031
for a Mexican drug cartel.

189
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,667
And poof, there you are,

190
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,138
standing in front
of yourself again.

191
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,606
But...

192
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:29,777
you literally dodged
my bullets.

193
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:33,648
And any man
who can survive my bullets...

194
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:37,385
can take care of my daughter.

195
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:41,289
Well, with all due respect,
your daughter takes care of me.

196
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,358
Oh.

197
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:45,492
That's sweet.
<i>Sí.</i>

198
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:47,061
<i>Ay, ya.</i>

199
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,933
That being said,

200
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:55,670
any of your kangaroo bullshit
comes back to bite you

201
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:57,738
and my daughter is involved...

202
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:01,609
well, I think we both know
how that one ends. Yeah?

203
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:44,445
All right.

204
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:45,846
Just let me be.

205
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,682
Yeah.
All right. Stop. Stop.

206
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:50,818
Do you give up?
Yes, I give up. I give up.

207
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:04,065
Hey, Marco.

208
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,735
Good to see you too, man.

209
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:10,571
You good?
I'm good. You good?

210
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:12,306
Yeah.
All right.

211
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:32,460
Hair of the dog, huh?
Ah. It's the only cure, mate.

212
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:33,994
Mmm.
The only cure.

213
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,197
Cheers.

214
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:47,374
So, last time I saw you,
you were hired to kill me.

215
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:49,578
No.
Yeah.

216
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,312
You were hired to kill me.

217
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,281
Oh, yeah.
I knew it was something.

218
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:56,150
Ah, it was something.

219
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:01,889
You've looked better.

220
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:05,092
Javi calls it...
homeless chic.

221
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:10,064
Wasting away again
in Margaritaville.

222
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:12,233
I'm not wasting
anything, pal.
Mmm.

223
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,936
I finally found a place
I feel like I can be happy in.

224
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,205
Oh... yeah.

225
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,673
Yeah.
Yeah.

226
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,842
Reminds me
of something I lost.

227
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,181
It's my way of staying close.

228
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,853
So how'd you find me, Marco?

229
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,728
There's a storm coming.

230
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:43,864
Okay, Batman.

231
00:27:43,998 --> 00:27:46,066
I've known where you are
for a minute.

232
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,870
Problem is,
now everyone knows.

233
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:52,039
'Cause you got a big mouth.

234
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:54,275
That's not my style, brother.
You know me. Mm-mmm.

235
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:55,442
Yeah, I know you.

236
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,415
She's alive.

237
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:07,922
What?
Valentina.

238
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:10,090
Don't do that.
Valentina is alive.

239
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:11,959
Marco.
She's alive.
I've seen her.

240
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:14,895
Marco, you're
fucking with me.
Come here.

241
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:17,464
No. How? How?

242
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,034
You left too early.

243
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,041
I've seen her.

244
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:29,143
Her-- Her mother is keeping
her on the compound

245
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:32,913
like a fucking damsel
surrounded by a dragon.

246
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,182
I'm gonna take you to her.

247
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,117
You back
working for Victoria?

248
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:39,920
Bitch wants me
just as dead as you.

249
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:43,757
Well, maybe not
as much as you.

250
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,159
And I have friends.

251
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:47,995
Had friends.

252
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:49,964
You said you've seen her.

253
00:29:19,594 --> 00:29:21,262
Okay. What's in it for you?

254
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:25,165
My honor. My loyalty.
My respect.

255
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:26,200
And?

256
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:28,503
Seventy-five grand.

257
00:29:28,637 --> 00:29:30,070
There he is.
Here I am.

258
00:29:30,204 --> 00:29:32,607
Now, do I look like
I have 75 grand?

259
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:34,208
No.
No?

260
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:35,442
No, you don't.

261
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:38,946
But you do.

262
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,782
You stole from Victoria
and got away.

263
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:44,918
How could you spend
that kind of money down here
without getting noticed?

264
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,154
Times are tough, brother.

265
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:49,724
As soon as
Romeo finds his Julieta,

266
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:51,526
I'm getting out of Dodge.

267
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:55,429
And we're square. Deal?

268
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,902
I hope you're ready to dig.

269
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,338
What?

270
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:23,658
Please.
I don't understand
what you're saying.

271
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:27,394
I said you have
too many cavities, gringo.

272
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:29,363
Consider this a free
dental appointment.

273
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:33,601
Hey, isn't this
sort of how we met?

274
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:03,864
Please.
 I would be a lot less scared if you speak in English.

275
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:04,932
Please, please.

276
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,676
Please. Ple--

277
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:20,347
You're just
gonna leave me here?

278
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:25,219
Walk until
you can no longer walk.

279
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:26,487
Please!

280
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:30,725
Please, no. No! No! No!

281
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:37,097
No, no, no, no.

282
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,634
Please! No, no, no.

283
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:42,035
No! No, no, no, no.

284
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:44,104
No!

285
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:19,641
You read Spanish?

286
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:21,676
Let me try.

287
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,679
<i>Saciar La Sed.</i>

288
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:27,582
Do you understand it?

289
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:29,584
No.

290
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,222
So the next time
I take her out,

291
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:38,025
we're starting to
get more comfortable
with each other.

292
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:40,260
I decide I want to take
her to a horror movie.

293
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,730
Start breaking down
some physical walls.
You know what I mean.

294
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:47,201
If there's a spooky part,
she reaches over,
grabs my arm,

295
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,969
rests her head
on my shoulder.

296
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:50,872
By scare three or four,
that armrest is up,

297
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:53,140
my arm is over her shoulder.

298
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,543
You know what happens next.

299
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:58,646
But she tells me
she doesn't do horror movies.

300
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:03,050
Or, like, she hasn't
since she peed her pants
when she was a kid.

301
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:05,152
She doesn't like 'em.
Perfect.

302
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:07,354
I can be the hero.

303
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:11,124
"Don't worry.
You're safe with me.
I got you, babe."

304
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:13,994
Sonny and Cher.

305
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:19,099
Ugh. She likes me.
She feels comfortable
with me. She trusts me.

306
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:21,970
So we go.
The joke's on me.

307
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:25,607
By the first scare,
she digs her nails into
my arm so badly I bleed.

308
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,810
Scare two,
she bit my shoulder
with her mouth.

309
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:33,413
Last scare, my arm is
finally around her shoulder.

310
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:36,383
She gets
so fucking freaked out,
back of her head bops up

311
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:38,018
and hits me right in the jaw.

312
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:39,554
My tooth is still loose.

313
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:42,690
What's funny?

314
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:45,827
I think
the girl's an easy mark.

315
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,494
What do you mean?

316
00:33:48,897 --> 00:33:50,899
Like putting spiders
in her bed

317
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:54,602
or putting limbs in places
like her drawers or something.

318
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:59,106
Leave her cryptic texts
that say,
"Are your doors unlocked?"

319
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:01,509
And then don't respond
for, like, days.

320
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:05,479
She'll be so scared
that she'll fall
right into your arms.

321
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:08,282
The hero, just amplified.

322
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:10,618
Why didn't I think of that?

323
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:14,054
<i>Bienvenidos,</i> gringos.
What can I get for you?

324
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:17,457
<i>Dos cervezas, por favor.</i>

325
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:19,861
See that?
Even in your native tongue.

326
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:21,495
Two beers. You got it.

327
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:22,597
And keep it open.

328
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,999
Oh, man.
We don't really do that.

329
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:29,537
Oh. I'm really thirsty.

330
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,409
Open. You got it.
No problem.

331
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:42,349
Sis.
<i>Qué pasó, mija?</i>

332
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,819
You know your rule,
"If you see something,
say something"?

333
00:34:44,953 --> 00:34:46,186
Uh-huh.

334
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,622
See something.

335
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:51,124
Like ghosts?

336
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,660
No.

337
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,666
Those <i>gringitos?</i>

338
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,301
What are you doing?

339
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:03,004
Click, click. Bang, bang.

340
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:04,639
They got guns, bitch.

341
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:06,373
Why are you telling me?
We have security.

342
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:08,408
Yes, I know that.
But he's not here.

343
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:17,250
Yeah,
just a little bit deeper.

344
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:20,287
Little more.
Nice.

345
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:26,193
Hello?
Hi. You busy?

346
00:35:26,326 --> 00:35:28,896
No. I can talk. What's up?

347
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,964
Can you come in early?

348
00:35:30,098 --> 00:35:32,734
No, I'm... busy.

349
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,068
Fuck do you do?

350
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,504
You need something, Javi?
It's just...

351
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:39,073
you're so good at your job
as a security guy.

352
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:44,078
You're the best security guy.
I only feel safe
when you're here.

353
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:45,412
Javi, what's going on?

354
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:48,950
Okay. Don't panic,
but two guys.

355
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,385
Both armed with guns.

356
00:35:52,419 --> 00:35:54,187
At the bar?
Yeah.

357
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,758
<i>Are they robbing it?</i>
No, they just opened a tab.

358
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,291
Do we do that?

359
00:35:58,425 --> 00:35:59,927
No, but when I saw
<i>la pistola,</i>

360
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,963
I stopped paying attention.

361
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:05,332
Okay, Javi.
I need you to listen to me
very carefully. Okay?

362
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:07,035
Are you parked out back?
Always.

363
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,870
Are you with Jackie?
<i>Claro, papi.</i>

364
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,438
The two of you
need to go out
and get in the car.

365
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:13,541
The limo.
The limo.

366
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:16,544
Go out and get in the limo
and come and get me. Okay?

367
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:18,478
Well, who's gonna
watch the bar?
Now, Javi!

368
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:20,280
Are we in trouble?
<i>I'll explain later.</i>

369
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:23,117
<i>Just get here.</i>
<i>Don't draw too much attention.</i>

370
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,485
"Don't draw
too much attention."

371
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:29,857
Let me get that.

372
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,325
What the-- Hey!

373
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:34,461
We gotta go.
Why do we have to go?

374
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:37,899
I'm going. I'm going.

375
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,140
Hey, what are you doing?

376
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:47,675
I'm digging.
Why?

377
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:50,044
For the money.
It's right here.

378
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:51,946
Yeah, it was in the closet.

379
00:36:54,148 --> 00:36:55,415
Why the fuck
am I digging then?

380
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,018
Because it's fun
to watch you sweat, Marco.

381
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:59,153
What an asshole!
No time to argue.
We gotta go.

382
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:01,522
"No time to argue."
We gotta go now.

383
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:03,457
Digging holes
that we don't need.

384
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:08,495
What is this?

385
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:52,907
I think
we've been stood up.

386
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:55,710
Yeah, because
no one likes you.

387
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:23,237
They're dust.
Yeah. I see that,
you stupid fuck.

388
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,072
What did I do?
You let them get away.

389
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:26,473
You left
the fucking tab open.

390
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:27,675
What does that have to do
with anything?

391
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,744
Get in the fucking car,
Duncan.

392
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,081
Are you fucking kidding me?

393
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:47,962
Someone want to tell me
what's going on?

394
00:38:48,095 --> 00:38:50,131
Hi, I'm Marco.

395
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:52,600
Hi, I'm Jackie.

396
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:55,603
Nice grip.

397
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:57,205
Now, can someone
please tell me

398
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:59,207
what the fuck is going on?

399
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,473
Those guys at the bar.

400
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,010
With guns.
They're looking for me.

401
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:05,746
And anyone around me isn't safe
until I figure this out.

402
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,781
Figure what out?

403
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:08,549
The less you know,
the better.

404
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:10,051
This is starting to sound like

405
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,452
some real dark
underworld-type shit, <i>papi.</i>

406
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:18,659
Wait a second. Is this
some real dark underworld--

407
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:21,494
Am I gonna die?
Am I the driver?

408
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:23,363
Javi--
Wait, wait. Those guys.

409
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:25,032
The gingers.
The what?

410
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,301
The white boys at my bar
that Javi said had guns.

411
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,769
Wait a sec.
They were gringos?

412
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,538
Not tough-looking ones either.

413
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:32,874
Javi, you know
what gringos are, right?

414
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:34,775
<i>Papi,</i> white boys
from America.

415
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:37,144
And that's what they were?
Freckles and everything.

416
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:39,580
What the fuck is going on,
Marco?

417
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:41,916
I don't know.
Maybe the old lady
wants to diversify.

418
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,556
We need to make a stop.

419
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:24,986
Anything else, gringo?
Yeah.

420
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,922
You can take your hand
off that shotgun

421
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,092
and give me a thousand pesos'
worth of gas.

422
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,028
Oh, and a pack of Durry's.

423
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,168
On the house.

424
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,106
<i>Cabrón!</i>

425
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,607
Sorry, <i>Tío.</i>
Again?

426
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:49,243
Mop that shit up.

427
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:52,046
Before I come at you like
a candle burning on both ends.

428
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:54,615
Miguel!

429
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:56,150
Yeah, <i>Tío.</i>

430
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:58,319
Take the gas cans with you.

431
00:41:58,452 --> 00:41:59,820
I'm sorry, <i>Tío.</i>

432
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:08,529
Useless.

433
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,731
Sorry about the shotgun.

434
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:12,833
I don't remember
if we were cool or not.

435
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:14,101
You never know with us.

436
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:15,703
I think three years
is long enough.

437
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,304
I heard you were dead.
Hmm.

438
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:19,607
But then I heard you weren't,
but you could be.

439
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,942
I'm glad you're still kicking,
<i>mano.</i>

440
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:25,479
Yeah, you know me.
I kick until my legs don't work.

441
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:29,216
Then I realized with you
and you-know-who's history--

442
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,284
I've been away.

443
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:32,053
And now?
I'm back.

444
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:34,021
You know what happens to me
if I help you?

445
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:35,790
I do.

446
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:38,993
I'm done with all that.
I'm clean. I run a business.

447
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:41,228
I have a family. I'm happy.

448
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:42,663
I know the feeling.

449
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:46,934
But then,
I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for you.

450
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:52,606
I'm gonna help you.

451
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:56,877
But the minute your taillights
are out of my sight...

452
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:01,916
I'm gonna give you 30 minutes
before I call it in.

453
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:06,053
Valentina's alive, Ramon.

454
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:13,794
Follow me.

455
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:32,880
It's safer for you
if you learn
how to speak Spanish.

456
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,849
I already know
how to speak Spanish.

457
00:43:34,982 --> 00:43:37,586
Mmm.
No, I don't think so. No.
I do.

458
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:47,361
That's a number.

459
00:43:47,495 --> 00:43:48,996
What?

460
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:52,601
Uh...

461
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,270
That's a bad word.

462
00:43:57,738 --> 00:43:59,440
You say it all the time.

463
00:43:59,574 --> 00:44:01,041
I know, but...

464
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:04,245
Try again.
Okay.

465
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:10,718
Stop it.
No, no, no, no, no.

466
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:13,287
Stop it. You're like--
Say it with me.

467
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,488
Okay.
Repeat with me.

468
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:15,923
Okay. Go.

469
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:18,527
Valentina...
Valentina...

470
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,131
See?

471
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:26,934
That sounds good.

472
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,275
Mmm.

473
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:38,812
I'm halfway
through <i>Rosetta Stone.</i>

474
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:40,881
Who is Rosita Stone?

475
00:44:41,015 --> 00:44:42,216
What?
Who is she?

476
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:44,485
Why are you laughing?

477
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,387
Who is she?

478
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:48,422
It's a book.
It's a book.

479
00:44:48,557 --> 00:44:51,125
Book.
Yeah. I learn Spanish.

480
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:55,496
Well, I'm not
that far through it.

481
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,400
I said you just need
to hang out with more Mexicans.

482
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:02,571
Hmm.

483
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:10,244
You're such a white boy.
You know that.

484
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:14,815
But I'll teach you.

485
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,250
Yeah?
Yeah.

486
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,134
Huh?

487
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:39,039
Retired, huh?

488
00:45:39,173 --> 00:45:42,510
Insurance policy.
This is everything.

489
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:45,980
Hasn't been touched
in three years.

490
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,150
She better be worth it.

491
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:52,786
She's everything.

492
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:59,326
Come out
with your hands up!

493
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,729
We have you surrounded!

494
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:03,197
Don't look at me.
I was with you.

495
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,402
Okay,
what the fuck?

496
00:46:08,536 --> 00:46:09,903
Ah, lookee here.

497
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:12,406
Surrounded?

498
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,141
Yeah, man. Why the fuck
did you say surrounded?

499
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:15,543
It's what
you're supposed to say.

500
00:46:15,677 --> 00:46:17,244
What who's supposed to say,
the bomb squad?

501
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:19,413
It doesn't fucking matter.
Both of you shut up!

502
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:22,016
Damn Mexican standoff
in my own gas station.

503
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:24,418
Sir, we don't
mean to intrude.

504
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:26,820
If you'll just be a doll
and drop your gun,

505
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,822
we'll take these three
and be on our way.

506
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:31,792
Three?
Why are you taking him?

507
00:46:31,925 --> 00:46:34,995
Marco Antonio Benitez
is wanted in four
different countries.

508
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:36,765
No, dumbass. Him!

509
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:40,434
This man's now wanted
for helping two fugitives
avoid arrest.

510
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:44,171
Miguel?
He can't even mop
the fucking floor.

511
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:46,206
Wait, who?
Marvin, who the fuck is that?

512
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,743
Who's who?
The guy you're pointing
the fucking gun at.

513
00:46:48,876 --> 00:46:49,910
This is Javi.

514
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:51,780
That's not Javi,
you idiot.

515
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:53,280
I'm Miguel.

516
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:56,283
<i>Hola. Me llamó Javi.</i>

517
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:57,251
Fuck!

518
00:46:57,384 --> 00:46:59,853
You guys
are really bad at this.

519
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:01,790
What the fuck
do we do now, man?

520
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:03,924
I don't know.
What are we supposed to do--

521
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:28,215
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

522
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:29,751
Everybody okay?
Are you okay?

523
00:47:29,883 --> 00:47:31,285
Yeah.
You guys gotta jet.

524
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:41,328
You guys go!

525
00:47:41,462 --> 00:47:43,163
What about you?
Don't worry about me.

526
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:44,632
You're no good to her dead.

527
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,004
Cover us.
<i>Vámonos, vámonos!</i>

528
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:56,377
Get in! Get in!

529
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:59,146
Go, go, go, go!

530
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:21,736
<i>Tío.</i>
It's okay.

531
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,571
It's okay. It's okay.

532
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:39,086
<i>Tío.</i>

533
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:23,598
Okay. Nuh-uh.
I'm gonna take a break.
I'm gonna take a break.

534
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:24,933
You're such a pussy.

535
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:27,669
How fucking dare you.

536
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:31,873
Fuck you.
This shit is different.

537
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:33,675
It hurts.

538
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:34,876
Just hurry up.

539
00:49:36,578 --> 00:49:38,580
This shit,
it's gonna be on you forever.

540
00:49:38,713 --> 00:49:41,381
You already have tattoos.
Yeah, but I was drunk
every time.

541
00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:43,350
You want a beer?

542
00:49:43,484 --> 00:49:44,485
Yes.

543
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:47,321
Too bad.
I'm already done, <i>güey.</i>

544
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:50,257
It looks pretty good.
It does, actually. Yes.

545
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:55,597
Well... I think
we are forever now.

546
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,764
Yeah.

547
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:58,800
Looks like
you're stuck with me.

548
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:00,167
Mmm.

549
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:07,341
...you still have to prove
to me you're worth it.

550
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:09,711
Oh, is that right?
Mm-hmm.

551
00:50:10,645 --> 00:50:12,680
You know something,
you're worth it.

552
00:50:20,922 --> 00:50:22,289
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

553
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:24,692
A fucking ambush.
Someone tipped her off.

554
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:26,661
Ramon's a lot of things,
but he's not a rat.

555
00:50:26,794 --> 00:50:28,462
Who the fuck is her?

556
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:30,999
Victoria Ventura
De La Cruz-Santana.

557
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:32,901
What?
I take it
you've heard of her.

558
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,201
Yeah.
Everybody's heard of her.

559
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:36,136
How do you know her?
I just know her.

560
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,172
How?
Like I fucking
know her, Javi!

561
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,281
I'm sorry.

562
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:51,251
Look, I didn't mean
for any of this.

563
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:54,254
Man, I did good
back there though, no?

564
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:00,127
Yeah, mate. You did good.

565
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,730
What! You don't fuck
with Javier Manuel!

566
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:04,097
Okay.

567
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:06,801
Should I drive?
No.

568
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:10,572
Are you sure?
I... Okay.

569
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:57,986
What is this?
Where are we?

570
00:51:58,118 --> 00:51:59,621
My <i>abuelito's</i> old cow farm.

571
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:01,923
It's off the grid.
No one's finding us here.

572
00:52:02,056 --> 00:52:04,424
Mmm. Where's <i>Abuelito?</i>

573
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,493
Heaven.
I'm sorry, man.

574
00:52:06,628 --> 00:52:08,796
Nah. He was
a mean old man anyway.

575
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,330
Oh, fuck him then.

576
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:14,669
Wow.

577
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:16,169
Power?

578
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:18,205
It's a generator situation.

579
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:22,309
Are you turning it on?

580
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:24,411
One sec, man.
I just got in.

581
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:26,114
Can I put my shit down?

582
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:30,618
My shit's down.
It's in the shed out back.

583
00:52:35,023 --> 00:52:37,925
I know you don't think
I'm going out there
in these shoes.

584
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:41,395
I'll go with you.

585
00:52:46,868 --> 00:52:47,902
<i>Jean-Pierre.</i>

586
00:52:50,538 --> 00:52:54,809
I stepped in a pile
of my own dog's shit today.

587
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:57,111
Now I know my little Pepito
would never shit

588
00:52:57,244 --> 00:52:59,147
where I was walking
on purpose.

589
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:03,518
So why am I stepping in shit?
Don't we have someone for this?

590
00:53:04,152 --> 00:53:05,787
He's not doing his job, boss.

591
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,156
No, he's not
doing his job at all.

592
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:09,624
Kill him.

593
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:14,128
My little Pepito.
I miss his face.

594
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,930
He's a cute puppy, eh, boss?

595
00:53:16,064 --> 00:53:17,765
The cutest.

596
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:29,443
I heard you stepped in shit.

597
00:53:29,577 --> 00:53:31,913
Barefoot.
Ooh. The worst.

598
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:33,715
You have something for me?

599
00:53:35,348 --> 00:53:37,719
You don't need to count.
I know.

600
00:53:39,687 --> 00:53:41,354
Do you remember
when we first met?

601
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:42,724
Yeah, of course.

602
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:51,398
It's a shame.
She was pretty.

603
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:54,367
Very pretty, boss.

604
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:10,918
I wanted no survivors.
And yet here you are.

605
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,756
I made a call to a bar,
my bar,

606
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:17,390
right outside the border
to intercept you...

607
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,264
That's a rough bar.

608
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:26,000
I'm lucky
Valentina was there.

609
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:33,741
She interfered
with my business.

610
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,643
She knows better.
She's your daughter.

611
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:37,879
The only reason
she's still alive.

612
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:40,882
Was it a coincidence
that she was there?

613
00:54:41,749 --> 00:54:43,985
Maybe,
but I don't think so.

614
00:54:44,118 --> 00:54:45,987
When it comes to you,

615
00:54:46,788 --> 00:54:49,356
I don't think
there are coincidences.

616
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,592
You got stabbed tonight.

617
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:58,298
Fuck!

618
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:01,702
It's nothing.

619
00:55:01,836 --> 00:55:05,006
Well, I bet that nothing only
missed a vital organ by what?

620
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:06,741
Mere centimeters.

621
00:55:06,874 --> 00:55:08,943
Anyone else would have
probably bled out,

622
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:11,311
but not you. No.

623
00:55:11,444 --> 00:55:12,747
<i>You can shoot the boy.</i>

624
00:55:14,749 --> 00:55:17,718
<i>You can blow this boy up.</i>

625
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:22,190
Whew. Fuck.

626
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:24,826
But he just won't die.

627
00:55:26,426 --> 00:55:28,029
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

628
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:29,630
Mmm.

629
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:34,535
You're gonna break
your daughter's heart.

630
00:55:34,669 --> 00:55:39,040
This gun left
my daughter fatherless.

631
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:42,577
Do you think that I can't kill
some pretty-boy drug mule

632
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,112
who has been nothing
but a thorn in my fucking side?

633
00:55:45,246 --> 00:55:46,681
I'm not a drug mule anymore.

634
00:55:46,814 --> 00:55:47,849
Why do you think that is?

635
00:55:47,982 --> 00:55:50,718
Because
I'm difficult to kill.

636
00:55:50,852 --> 00:55:52,220
And you would lose
your best guy,

637
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:53,955
which means
you would lose your money.

638
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:55,122
Your best quality.

639
00:55:58,092 --> 00:56:00,261
I feel like
you're getting a little cocky.

640
00:56:00,393 --> 00:56:03,798
And I feel like you're using
my daughter as a shield.

641
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:06,499
What do you think
your life would be like

642
00:56:06,634 --> 00:56:10,638
if I decided to separate
the two of you?

643
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:17,912
I am going to marry Valentina,
even if it kills me.

644
00:56:19,113 --> 00:56:21,616
I'd prefer to do it
with your blessing.

645
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:25,920
I've showed you my loyalty
and I have proved to you

646
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:29,123
that I will do anything
for your daughter.

647
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:32,260
We only have one more deal
left on our agreement.

648
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,929
And I hope that deal
still stands.

649
00:56:36,564 --> 00:56:37,965
For all of our sakes.

650
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:42,169
A threat?
Ooh, no.

651
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:46,107
Please.
I would never threaten you.

652
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:49,977
We're family, after all.

653
00:57:02,556 --> 00:57:04,491
That's a lot of guns.

654
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:06,227
Gonna need 'em.

655
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,095
Must've made
a lot of mistakes.

656
00:57:17,939 --> 00:57:20,107
I only ever made
one mistake.

657
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:27,915
I fell in love
with the daughter
of a very dangerous person.

658
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:30,217
Falling in love,
that doesn't
sound like a mistake.

659
00:57:30,351 --> 00:57:31,819
That wasn't the mistake.

660
00:57:35,523 --> 00:57:37,391
The mistake was
believing her mother.

661
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:38,659
Victoria?

662
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:40,928
She took everything from me.

663
00:57:50,905 --> 00:57:53,107
I'll head out with Marco
in the morning.

664
00:57:54,008 --> 00:57:56,677
You and Jackie stay here
and lay low for a while.

665
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:00,548
I'm on the journey now, coz.

666
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:03,483
Yeah.

667
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:07,788
Any other day,
I would just be at the bar,

668
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:10,624
slinging beers for people
I don't want to know,

669
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:12,026
who don't want to know me.

670
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:16,130
But today, I'm on the run
with my friend.

671
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:18,899
For my friend.

672
00:58:19,633 --> 00:58:21,869
To rescue
the love of his life.

673
00:58:22,937 --> 00:58:24,739
It's fucking--
It's romantic, man.

674
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:26,674
Javi, this isn't--

675
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:29,010
And I'm the getaway driver!

676
00:58:30,945 --> 00:58:33,748
<i>Papi,</i> I get to be that guy.

677
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,285
I never get to be that guy.

678
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:43,858
So you're stuck with me.

679
00:58:45,426 --> 00:58:47,294
And I get the big one.

680
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:51,265
We have to leave tonight.

681
00:58:51,399 --> 00:58:52,967
It's already set.

682
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,536
You think
this is your last one?

683
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:58,839
How many guns are you bringing?

684
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,274
Going out with a bang.

685
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:06,781
She has an army.
Why are you going alone?

686
00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:08,816
Because she's testing me.
And if you fail?

687
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,619
I'm tired of running,
Valentina.

688
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,089
If we run,
she's just gonna find us.

689
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:17,258
And if she doesn't,
we'll still just be running.

690
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:18,692
She won't let me go.

691
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:21,128
A deal's a deal.
And my mother is a liar.

692
00:59:23,964 --> 00:59:26,867
I will do anything
to keep us together.

693
00:59:28,537 --> 00:59:29,937
Valentina, we don't--

694
00:59:30,805 --> 00:59:32,807
we don't have
any other options here.

695
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:37,978
And if this works...

696
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:42,116
she said she'd walk you
down the aisle herself.

697
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:44,151
If it doesn't work?

698
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:55,496
It's like a chainsaw.
Just pull harder.

699
00:59:55,629 --> 00:59:59,333
Oh, no, I know. I've-- I've--
I've used those for...

700
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:02,169
other things.

701
01:00:02,803 --> 01:00:04,271
I'm not a lumberjack.

702
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:06,173
Maybe the gas is old.

703
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:08,042
What?

704
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:10,211
You seem to know a lot
about generators.

705
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:12,913
I own a shitty bar
in a small town.

706
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:14,682
Power's always out.

707
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:18,686
All right.

708
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:24,658
Oh, fuck!

709
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:31,732
So... who was that woman
at the gas station?

710
01:00:33,267 --> 01:00:34,635
I have no idea.

711
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:39,574
So how long
you two known each other?

712
01:00:39,707 --> 01:00:43,744
Him? Oh, uh,
we used to work together.

713
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,380
Doing what?
This and that.

714
01:00:47,148 --> 01:00:48,182
Mostly that?

715
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:50,784
Mostly that.

716
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:55,956
So... what happened?

717
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:57,825
Our boss--
Victoria.

718
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:01,295
Victoria. Yeah. She hated him.

719
01:01:01,428 --> 01:01:04,765
I mean, she hated everyone
who worked for her,
to be honest.

720
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,569
Would punish us
for stupid things.

721
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:09,103
Make us clean up
her dog's shit.

722
01:01:09,236 --> 01:01:10,671
Things like that.

723
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:13,073
But not him.
Oh, no.

724
01:01:13,207 --> 01:01:16,043
He was the fuckin' best.
A beast.

725
01:01:17,512 --> 01:01:21,815
Also... impossible to kill.
Like a fucking roach.

726
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:23,585
And she hated that about him.

727
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:24,985
She wanted him dead?

728
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,288
Oh, since the moment
she laid eyes on him. Yeah.

729
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:29,190
So why didn't she do it?

730
01:01:33,794 --> 01:01:35,329
Someone was protecting him.

731
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:39,400
Her daughter. Valentina.

732
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:42,836
She loved him.
And he loves her.

733
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,639
"Loved"?

734
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:46,307
Well, she doesn't know
he's alive.

735
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:50,211
And he didn't know she was alive
until I showed up.

736
01:01:52,313 --> 01:01:53,380
So...

737
01:01:55,316 --> 01:01:56,717
why did you show up?

738
01:01:59,621 --> 01:02:00,655
I owe him.

739
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:04,458
I said it was for the money,
but I owe him.

740
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,762
You know the dog shit duty?

741
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:11,600
It was my turn one day,
and I said, "No, fuck it.

742
01:02:11,732 --> 01:02:13,133
I'm not a fucking lackey.

743
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:16,403
I'm a goddamn
professional assassin."

744
01:02:16,538 --> 01:02:19,039
As you can imagine,
that didn't sit well with her.

745
01:02:19,173 --> 01:02:20,407
Who did she send after me?

746
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:23,310
The one person who could
actually pull it off.

747
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,049
Thing is, he didn't show.

748
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:33,622
He took the money,
took her daughter and they ran.

749
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:38,593
And the fucked-up thing
is that I would have done it.

750
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:42,963
I would have taken the money
and put a bullet in his head
if she asked me to.

751
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:48,369
That's why I showed up.

752
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:53,374
I am alive
because he has honor.

753
01:02:54,842 --> 01:02:57,378
And honor is something
you show up for.

754
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:07,656
You wanna try the genny
one more time?

755
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:09,557
Yes, I think I will.

756
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:13,260
Did I do it?

757
01:03:13,394 --> 01:03:16,230
That wasn't the genny.

758
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,735
Shit.
How did they find us?

759
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:22,369
We gotta go! We gotta go.

760
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,206
What the fuck?

761
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:29,410
Fuck.

762
01:03:30,878 --> 01:03:33,247
She found us.

763
01:04:25,834 --> 01:04:27,334
Marco!

764
01:04:35,008 --> 01:04:36,210
Javi!

765
01:04:39,781 --> 01:04:43,083
Did you think I would miss
my daughter's wedding?

766
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:46,253
Valentina.

767
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:50,692
There's only one target
that I have never hit.

768
01:04:50,825 --> 01:04:53,628
I'm begging you.

769
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:57,599
I love him.

770
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:07,207
No, Mama.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

771
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:08,375
Valentina!

772
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,022
You ready to be
the guy, Javi?
Yeah.

773
01:08:42,056 --> 01:08:44,124
Who the fuck are you?

774
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:24,932
Oh, fuck.

775
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,176
<i>Papi?</i>

776
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:40,815
<i>Papi?</i>

777
01:09:46,154 --> 01:09:47,622
Javi.

778
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,729
No, no, no.
You're all right.

779
01:10:00,568 --> 01:10:03,004
<i>Papi.</i>
Shh. You're okay.
You're okay.

780
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:05,940
You're okay. You're okay, buddy.
You're okay.

781
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:08,208
Yeah, you're okay.

782
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:11,211
I got to be that guy.

783
01:10:15,983 --> 01:10:17,685
I got to be that guy.

784
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:24,357
You, uh-- You are that guy.

785
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:25,927
Yeah.

786
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:28,328
You're that guy.

787
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:30,932
I'm that guy.

788
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:33,601
I'm that guy.

789
01:10:40,942 --> 01:10:43,010
No. No, no.

790
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:45,813
No.

791
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:03,558
No! Stop! No!

792
01:12:24,278 --> 01:12:27,414
No, no, no, no.

793
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,150
No.

794
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:20,034
I didn't know.

795
01:13:57,872 --> 01:13:58,940
No.

796
01:14:07,048 --> 01:14:08,115
<i>Bueno.</i>

797
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:10,851
<i>Sí.</i>

798
01:14:12,753 --> 01:14:14,789
I'll check
if he's still available.

799
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:32,640
<i>Oh, you don't wanna talk?</i>

800
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:34,542
<i>I get it. That's okay.</i>

801
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:37,812
<i>Maybe you just listen then.</i>

802
01:14:37,945 --> 01:14:39,981
Did you really think that
you could get back to her?

803
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:42,950
<i>Did you really think</i>
<i>I would let that happen?</i>

804
01:14:43,918 --> 01:14:47,088
<i>You were my big fish.</i>
<i>And anyone who knows me knows</i>

805
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:50,291
I always catch my fish.

806
01:14:50,424 --> 01:14:52,259
But you refuse to die.

807
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,930
And so my fish
falls off the hook.

808
01:14:56,731 --> 01:15:00,201
And who catches my fish?
My only daughter.

809
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:05,573
<i>The only person</i>
<i>I love in this world</i>
<i>besides myself.</i>

810
01:15:05,706 --> 01:15:09,477
You can imagine the moral
conundrum this puts me in.

811
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:13,114
There are many things
in this world
that you can't control.

812
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:17,018
Life. Death. And love.

813
01:15:17,151 --> 01:15:18,853
You fell in love
with the wrong person.

814
01:15:18,986 --> 01:15:22,056
That is--
That is not your fault.

815
01:15:22,623 --> 01:15:25,359
<i>No. What is your fault</i>

816
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:29,630
is that
you were supposed to die
the day that I found you.

817
01:15:29,764 --> 01:15:32,533
<i>But you cheated. You ran.</i>

818
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:37,271
And because you cheated,
my daughter was placed
in the line of fire.

819
01:15:38,507 --> 01:15:39,940
Holy shit.

820
01:15:41,142 --> 01:15:44,011
This is like
Romeo and Juliet.

821
01:15:44,779 --> 01:15:47,415
And we both know
how that ends.

822
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:49,884
I wanted to kill you
for a long time.

823
01:15:50,017 --> 01:15:55,556
But what would my daughter
think if I did that?

824
01:15:57,892 --> 01:16:01,796
I did make the order
that got my daughter killed.

825
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:05,900
But miracles, they happen.

826
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:09,904
<i>Some people get second chances</i>
<i>and I'm getting mine.</i>

827
01:16:10,037 --> 01:16:13,107
<i>And I'm going to make sure</i>
<i>that you never get yours.</i>

828
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:18,345
You will never hold her
in your arms again.

829
01:16:19,548 --> 01:16:20,948
Or your son.

830
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:26,620
My...

831
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:30,324
My what?
<i>Oh.</i>

832
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:32,359
You didn't know.

833
01:16:35,763 --> 01:16:38,365
Why couldn't you
just let us go?

834
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:42,269
We were so close
to a new life.

835
01:16:42,403 --> 01:16:44,071
A new life?

836
01:16:44,205 --> 01:16:48,075
My daughter's life was perfect
before you came into it.

837
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:50,311
<i>She never needed</i>
<i>anything from you</i>

838
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:54,248
<i>and she never will again,</i>
<i>and neither will my grandson.</i>

839
01:16:56,383 --> 01:17:00,988
Everyone around you dies,
except you.

840
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:08,896
And I think it is time
for everyone around you
to go into remission.

841
01:17:23,277 --> 01:17:24,945
No.

842
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:32,720
You told me
I just had to watch him.

843
01:17:34,288 --> 01:17:35,356
Please.

844
01:18:07,721 --> 01:18:09,156
I don't want to do this.

845
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:13,961
But I owe her.
I owe her a lot.

846
01:18:14,094 --> 01:18:17,231
You know what it's like
to owe her.

847
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:23,137
And maybe one day,
I'll be laying where you are,
but not today.

848
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:28,976
I'm sorry.

849
01:18:57,438 --> 01:18:58,939
I love it here.

850
01:19:01,643 --> 01:19:03,410
It's where I feel happiest.

851
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:07,481
Sitting here next to you.

852
01:19:14,822 --> 01:19:16,056
What is it?

853
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:19,393
I don't know
what's going to happen.

854
01:19:20,861 --> 01:19:23,197
We never know
what's gonna happen.

855
01:19:30,504 --> 01:19:33,140
Two worlds that collided.

856
01:19:35,309 --> 01:19:36,377
For a reason.

857
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:39,013
And what's the reason?

858
01:19:39,146 --> 01:19:41,415
So that we could
build a new world.

859
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:44,385
A better one.

860
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:46,353
And if it doesn't work?

861
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,059
If we want it to, it will.

862
01:19:54,261 --> 01:19:55,429
I want it.

863
01:19:57,699 --> 01:19:59,133
Me too.

864
01:20:01,736 --> 01:20:03,103
What happens next?

865
01:20:05,674 --> 01:20:07,341
Now I take care of you.

866
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,468
<i>If any</i>
<i>of your kangaroo bullshit</i>

867
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:38,339
<i>comes back to bite you</i>
<i>and my daughter is involved...</i>

868
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:42,142
<i>well, I think we both know</i>
<i>how that one ends, yeah?</i>
