Master Brodess,

84
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,200
could I get a word?

85
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,365
Master Brodess, uh,

86
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,632
I think you know
Minty's husband John.

87
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:40,632
He work with me
over at Thompson Mill.

88
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:42,365
Course I know him.

89
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,231
I let him marry her.

90
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,500
What's your point?

91
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,365
Me and Minty...

92
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:58,498
uh, we thinking
about having a family.

93
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,100
And...

94
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:05,265
...we want our babies
born free.

95
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,332
So we hired a lawyer

96
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:08,765
- that made it clear that...

98

Ben, what the hell
is this nigger talking about?

99
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,532
Uh, well, sir, well,

100
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:17,932
what we're talking about
is the last wishes

101
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:20,632
of your great-granddaddy
Atthow Pattison.

102
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:24,632
He gave my wife Rit
to your mama as a child,

103
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,665
but she's supposed
to be freed at 45.

104
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,699
She 57 now.

105
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:31,699
Well, you got this will?

106
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:34,532
Got a letter
from the lawyer, sir.

107
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,765
- H-He say it clear.
- Hmm.

108
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,632
HARRIET:
My mama was 46

109
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:41,365
when you sold my sisters.

110
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,432
Lawyer say that illegal.

111
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:46,365
We all supposed to be free
when she turn 45.

112
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,465
My sisters is lost to us,
but John and me... we...

113
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:52,400
we want our babies born free
like they supposed to be.

114
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:59,367
(continues ripping paper)

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,765
Now you listen here, girl.

116
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:07,599
Your daddy may be free
and your husband, too,

117
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:11,665
but you and your mama

118
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,265
and your brothers and sister...

119
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:17,498
they belong to me... for life.

120
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,765
And your babies will belong
to me

121
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:23,632
and their babies
will belong to me.

122
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,632
Do you understand me?

123
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,565

You're the devil!

124
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:31,465
You're the devil,
Edward Brodess!

125
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:33,465
You sold my daughters south

126
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:35,665
where nobody know their name!

127
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,932
- BEN: Come on now. Come on.
- (sobbing)

128
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:38,999

- RIT: My babies.

129
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:42,532
EDWARD: You and Ben ain't
welcome here no more.

130
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,500
You stay away from my slaves.

131
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:48,231
Now get the hell
off my damn porch.

132
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,167
(Rit sobs)

133
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:55,432

BEN:
Come on now.

135

Come on.

136
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,667
Weren't for you, I would have
sold that girl a long time ago.

137
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,599
(crying)

138
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,233
My master an evil man, Lord!

139
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,267
You know he evil.

140
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:23,532
If you can't change his soul,
take him!

141
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,300
Take him, Lord!

142
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,133
Strike my master down!

143
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,674
Lord don't listen
to niggers, Minty.

144
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:05,709
Now, I've been telling you that
since we were kids.

145
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:09,573
Since the time
I had typhoid as a boy

146
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:12,273
and Mama had you sittin' me.

147
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:14,640
The first thing I saw
when I opened my eyes

148
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:18,440
was your little black face
praying.

149
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:20,542
Scared the fever
right out of me.

150
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,840
Now, I got used to your face...

151
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:29,473
but that praying...

152
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,575
always made my skin crawl.

153
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:38,407
What the hell were you
thinking, hiring a lawyer?

154
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,674
(sighs)

155
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:43,507
You think Daddy would just
let you all go free...

156
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:47,275
damn near half his property...
just like that?

157
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:52,409
He warned me.

158
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:58,774
"Boy, having a favorite slave
is like having a favorite pig.

159
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:01,407
"You can feed it,

160
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:04,306
you can play with it,
give it a name..."

161
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:05,306
(grunts)

162
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:06,442
(groans softly)

163
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:12,440
"One day...

164
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:15,607
"you might have
to eat it or sell it.

165
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:20,340
"You know it
and the pig knows it.

166
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:22,440
"And if you have to sell it,
there's no more guilt

167
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:25,707
"than separating piglets.

168
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:28,742
And if you have to eat it,
you'll forget its name."

169
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:33,375
I hope one day I forget yours.

170
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,776

00:38:01,842 --> 00:38:04,208
worse than the hole in my head.

547
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,607
Hole in my head just...

548
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:11,609
made God's voice more clear.

549
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:17,709
(pen scratching on paper)

550
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:31,740
Morning.

551
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,609
Almost there.

552
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:36,306
Morning.

553
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:38,242
(indistinct chatter)

554
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:51,776
(footfalls approaching)

555
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:55,573
(gasps)
Mr. Still.

556
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:57,273
Good afternoon.

557
00:38:57,275 --> 00:38:59,473
Miss Buchanon, good afternoon.

558
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:00,707
Allow me to introduce you

559
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:02,507
to Miss Harriet Tubman,
a new arrival.

560
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:04,306
Harriet,
this is Marie Buchanon.

561
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,848
She's a friend and the owner
of this establishment.

562
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,781
Pleasure to meet you,
Harriet.

563
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:10,050
Ma'am.

564
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,215
Well, I will leave her

565
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:17,315
in your very capable hands,
Marie.

566
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:20,781
Ladies, good afternoon.

567
00:39:20,783 --> 00:39:22,048
(door opens)

568
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,282
Come on in.

569
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:25,151
- Come on.
- (door closes)

570
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:30,482
The public rooms
are on this floor.

571
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:33,115
- This is the game room.
- (indistinct chatter nearby)

572
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:34,948
Say hello.

573
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,915
- Hello.
- MAN: Hello.

574
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,915
And this is the parlor.

575
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:41,950
You are welcome here any time.

576
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,982
Yes, I'm a woman,
yes, I'm Negro,

577
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,915
and yes, I own this place.

578
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:51,715
My mama was freed
after her master died.

579
00:39:51,717 --> 00:39:52,915
She was pregnant with me

580
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:55,048
and I was born
and raised free,

581
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,848
right here in Philadelphia.

582
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,082
You can take the last room
upstairs on the left.

583
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:02,182
And supper has already
been served,

584
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:03,915
but I'll make you a plate.

585
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:07,115
But first
you've got to take a bath.

586
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:10,149
You're stinking like
an old barnyard animal.

587
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:12,948
(chuckles) There's a washtub
in the kitchen.

588
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,282
I'll put some water on for you.

589
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:16,882
HARRIET:
You was born free?

590
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:18,282
Yes.

591
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:22,149
Guess you never had
the stink of fear.

592
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:24,982
Of running for your life.

593
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:27,781
I have not, Harriet.

594
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:30,117
I apologize.

595
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,151
<i>(water pouring)</i>

596
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,781
Gonna go warm your stew.

597
00:40:39,783 --> 00:40:42,783
If you need anything,
just let me know.

598
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,683
♪ ♪

599
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:19,082
So, you got a man?

600
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:22,282
My husband John.

601
00:41:22,284 --> 00:41:25,249
He free like you.

602
00:41:25,251 --> 00:41:29,482
He was gonna run with me,
but... I was scared

603
00:41:29,484 --> 00:41:33,750
if we get caught,
they'd take his freedom.

604
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,848
(sighs)

605
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,182
So I left him.

606
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:42,048
But I wish he was here
with me now.

607
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,249
Must've been hard on him
when he,

608
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,848
when he found me gone.

609
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,815
The boatmen, they call them
the black jacks,

610
00:41:49,817 --> 00:41:51,182
they travel up and down
the Delaware

611
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:52,915
and Chesapeake Bay.

612
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:55,850
Maybe they can get word to him
that you made it.

613
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:59,182
Thank you, ma'am.

614
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,215
Call me Marie.

615
00:42:01,217 --> 00:42:04,249
You wash up good
'cause tomorrow

616
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:08,084
we're gonna get you
a paying job.

617
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:15,182
JESSE:
Slow down, Harriet.

618
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:17,884
They don't pay us
by the bushel.

619
00:42:36,884 --> 00:42:38,817
- (seabirds calling)
- (indistinct chatter)

620
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:43,715
- Hello, Miss Harriet.
- Jasper.

621
00:42:43,717 --> 00:42:46,182
- Any word from my family?
- Yes, ma'am.

622
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:49,149
Brought some lumber
from the Eastern Shore.

623
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:52,082
Your husband
and family know you're safe.

624
00:42:52,084 --> 00:42:53,748
My husband.

625
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,048
He send word back?

626
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,315
No, ma'am.

627
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:58,115
No word.

628
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,717
Thank you.

629
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:04,848
WILLIAM:
<i>It's not bad.</i>

630
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,915
I know Mr. Beechem
over on Pine.

631
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,282
I want you to take this around
to him this afternoon.

632
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:11,115
Harriet, how are you?

633
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:13,683
I need your angels to help me
get my husband and family.

634
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:21,149
Well, Harriet, that's-that's
not how this works.

635
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:23,815
My angels are part of
a sophisticated network,

636
00:43:23,817 --> 00:43:25,182
not for your personal use.

637
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:26,982
Now, trust we're doing
what we can

638
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:29,182
- for who we can.
- But I feel something wrong, William.

639
00:43:29,184 --> 00:43:31,182
I can't sleep.
Please help me.

640
00:43:31,184 --> 00:43:34,048
Listen, Harriet, uh...

641
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:37,115
Our work has gotten
a lot more dangerous.

642
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,282
Slave owners
are getting frustrated

643
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,082
with the amount of runaways.

644
00:43:41,084 --> 00:43:42,848
Federal judges, marshals

645
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,282
and slave catchers
are working together.

646
00:43:44,284 --> 00:43:46,149
Even Congress is threatening

647
00:43:46,151 --> 00:43:48,082
to pass laws
to appease the South.

648
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,715
If you won't help me,
I'll go myself.

649
00:43:49,717 --> 00:43:50,815
Harriet, wait a second.

650
00:43:50,817 --> 00:43:52,884
Wait a second, wait a second.

651
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,815
Harriet, I can't have you
risking your life

652
00:43:58,817 --> 00:44:00,650
or this network
because you're lonely.

653
00:44:01,717 --> 00:44:04,715
Rescuing slaves requires skill

654
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:06,783
and careful planning.

655
00:44:08,217 --> 00:44:10,848
It requires reading, Harriet.

656
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:14,082
Can you read a sign or a map?
Can you read at all?

657
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,282
I put my attention on trying

658
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:16,982
to hear God's voice
more clearly.

659
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:18,748
Do you know what would happen
if you got caught?

660
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,115
They would torture you
until you pointed them

661
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:21,249
right to this office.

662
00:44:21,251 --> 00:44:24,182
You got lucky, Harriet.

663
00:44:24,184 --> 00:44:26,748
And there's nothing more
you can do.

664
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,884
Don't you tell me
what I can't do.

665
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,249
I made it this far on my own.

666
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:34,249
God was watching,
but my feet was my own.

667
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:36,815
Running, bleeding, climbing,

668
00:44:36,817 --> 00:44:39,048
nearly drowned, nothing
to eat for days and days,

669
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,815
but I made it.

670
00:44:41,817 --> 00:44:44,882
So don't you tell me
what I can't do.

671
00:44:44,884 --> 00:44:46,017
You don't know me.

672
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,882
I made up my mind...
I'm going back.

673
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:55,215
Without my husband
and my family,

674
00:44:55,217 --> 00:44:57,249
I'm just a stranger
in a strange land.

675
00:44:57,251 --> 00:45:00,915
If I'm free,
they should be, too.

676
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:02,948
I'm gonna go get 'em,

677
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,182
one by one,
starting with my husband.

678
00:45:05,184 --> 00:45:07,781
I... I need a suit for him
and a dress for me

679
00:45:07,783 --> 00:45:10,182
so I can look like a free lady.

680
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:12,182
Marie.

681
00:45:12,184 --> 00:45:14,151
Will you help me?

682
00:45:22,084 --> 00:45:23,950
How do you do?

683
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:31,048
How do you do?

684
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,182
Good.

685
00:45:32,184 --> 00:45:34,882
You were confident, composed,

686
00:45:34,884 --> 00:45:36,482
wise enough to know
not to look

687
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,815
a strange white man
in the eyes.

688
00:45:38,817 --> 00:45:40,850
You don't want no trouble.

689
00:45:47,984 --> 00:45:50,217
But if trouble comes...

690
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,817
...you'll be ready.

691
00:45:59,017 --> 00:46:01,182
Try it.

692
00:46:01,184 --> 00:46:02,882
Yeah.

693
00:46:02,884 --> 00:46:04,984
You'll be ready.

694
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,948
<i>I'll put you
in touch with a man</i>

695
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,815
<i>who will sell you free papers.</i>

696
00:46:10,817 --> 00:46:13,748
<i>They won't be yours,
they're someone else's.</i>

697
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,815
<i>May not match
your description exactly,</i>

698
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,482
<i>but they'll get
something right.</i>

699
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:18,948
CONDUCTOR:
Station is Dover, Delaware.

700
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,781
Dover, Delaware.

701
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:22,182
MARIE:
<i>Hopefully, they won't</i>

702
00:46:22,184 --> 00:46:23,315
<i>read 'em too close.</i>

703
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:26,715
<i>They're more worried
about Negroes heading north.</i>

704
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,282
<i>Runaways don't go south.</i>

705
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:31,217
(train bell clanging)

706
00:46:47,317 --> 00:46:50,048
Hello, sir.
How do you do?

707
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,817
Papers.

708
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,650
(men chatting indistinctly)

709
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,115
- Dessa Dixon?
- Yes, sir.

710
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:06,915
Where were you born, Dessa?

711
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:08,315
Philadelphia.

712
00:47:08,317 --> 00:47:12,050
July 18, 1824, of free issue.

713
00:47:16,151 --> 00:47:18,182
Says here you're
five and a half feet tall.

714
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:20,117
You ain't more than five feet.

715
00:47:24,184 --> 00:47:27,917
Must've worn my high boots
that day.

716
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:32,215
Says you got a birthmark
on your forehead.

717
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:33,717
That's correct, sir.

718
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,917
Thank you, sir.

719
00:47:58,184 --> 00:48:00,815
FOXX:
Come on, now!

720
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:03,748
Straighten those rows.

721
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,315
ELIZA:
<i>Dear Mr. Thompson.</i>

722
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:08,715
<i>No. Dear brother-in-law,</i>

723
00:48:08,717 --> 00:48:10,482
I hope you will accept

726

Please accept
the enclosed $7.50.

727
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,882
I hope to make
another payment next month.

728
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:27,781
Your neighbor
and sister-in-law,

729
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:29,618
Eliza Brodess.

730
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,249
We're gonna have to sell
some slaves, Mama.

731
00:48:34,251 --> 00:48:39,115
Our stature in this community
is measured in Negroes.

732
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:41,781
We can't live like paupers.

733
00:48:41,783 --> 00:48:42,882
Would you prefer
to keep the slaves

734
00:48:42,884 --> 00:48:44,050
and sell the farm?

735
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:52,915
We can sell the Ross brothers.

736
00:48:52,917 --> 00:48:56,182
I mean, Robert alone
is worth $600 or $700.

737
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:57,982
If we sell Junyah
and Henry, too,

738
00:48:57,984 --> 00:49:00,815
we can bring home maybe $1,600.

739
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:03,315
That will go a ways
to paying off Daddy's debts.

740
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:05,915
You won't have to beg.

741
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:08,048
We can go on as we have.

742
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,982
With you unmarried
and sleeping in brothels?

743
00:49:11,984 --> 00:49:14,149
We'll go on as we have.

744
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,815
The others will just have
to work harder

745
00:49:17,817 --> 00:49:19,917

So sorry to hear
about your sister.

1457
01:31:39,059 --> 01:31:41,824
I failed her, William.

1458
01:31:41,826 --> 01:31:43,759
We failed her.

1459
01:31:46,592 --> 01:31:49,857
Harriet, this is, uh,
Senator William Seward.

1460
01:31:49,859 --> 01:31:51,623
Miss Tubman.

1461
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:54,623
It's an honor to welcome you
to my home.

1462
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:57,290
My condolences.

1463
01:31:57,292 --> 01:31:59,325
How can I help?

SYDNEY HOWARD GAY:
<i>500 miles.</i>

1465

500 miles from the
Mason-Dixon Line to Canada.

1466
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,490
An unimaginable distance.

1467
01:32:13,492 --> 01:32:15,757
Slave catchers are monitoring
all northbound travel.

1468
01:32:15,759 --> 01:32:18,390
God help the man
without free papers.

1469
01:32:18,392 --> 01:32:20,490
How are we gonna get
our passengers

1470
01:32:20,492 --> 01:32:22,057
from the southern farms
and plantations

1471
01:32:22,059 --> 01:32:23,857
all the way to the border
of Canada?

1472
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:27,057
We can't keep trying to outrun
them; we have to fight.

1473
01:32:27,059 --> 01:32:28,724
The only way to make
the Fugitive Slave Law

1474
01:32:28,726 --> 01:32:29,824
a dead letter

1475
01:32:29,826 --> 01:32:32,423
is to make half a dozen
or more dead slave catchers.

1476
01:32:32,425 --> 01:32:34,057
That will cool their ardor.

1477
01:32:34,059 --> 01:32:36,623
He may be right.

1478
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:38,459
Civil war might be
our only hope.

1479
01:32:40,358 --> 01:32:43,559
We can't just give up
a-and wait for war.

1480
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:46,057
We need to get back to work

1481
01:32:46,059 --> 01:32:47,690
bringing slaves to freedom,

1482
01:32:47,692 --> 01:32:51,390
by train or carriage,
horseback,

1483
01:32:51,392 --> 01:32:52,490
on foot if necessary.

1484
01:32:52,492 --> 01:32:55,423
Harriet...

1485
01:32:55,425 --> 01:32:57,057
the journey from Maryland
to Canada

1486
01:32:57,059 --> 01:32:59,824
is 600 miles
from the Canadian border.

1487
01:32:59,826 --> 01:33:01,523
Your longest trip
was a hundred.

1488
01:33:01,525 --> 01:33:04,490
Now, that would take months,
not weeks. You can't...

1489
01:33:04,492 --> 01:33:06,623
I ain't giving up
rescuing slaves

1490
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:09,358
because it's far.

1491
01:33:11,425 --> 01:33:14,559
Many of you don't know
slavery firsthand.

1492
01:33:15,892 --> 01:33:18,390
You were born free.

1493
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:21,423
You been free so long,
you forget what it's like.

1494
01:33:21,425 --> 01:33:25,290
You've gotten comfortable

1495
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:27,225
a-and important.

1496
01:33:28,325 --> 01:33:31,423
You got beautiful homes,

1497
01:33:31,425 --> 01:33:33,492
beautiful wives.

1498
01:33:34,659 --> 01:33:36,692
But I remember.

1499
01:33:39,358 --> 01:33:41,557
Children beat for not working,

1500
01:33:41,559 --> 01:33:44,657
fore they understand
what work is.

1501
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:47,057
Girls raped fore
they first blood.

1502
01:33:47,059 --> 01:33:49,724
Brothers whipped
till they back in ribbons.

1503
01:33:49,726 --> 01:33:52,557
Sisters sold from they babies.

1504
01:33:52,559 --> 01:33:56,323
Trying not to think
of what they went through.

1505
01:33:56,325 --> 01:33:59,457
Those still enslaved
are going through right now.

1506
01:33:59,459 --> 01:34:00,623
But I...

1507
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:04,523
I've heard they groans
and they sighs.

1508
01:34:04,525 --> 01:34:06,356
I've seen they tears.

1509
01:34:06,358 --> 01:34:09,423
And I would give every last
drop of blood in my veins

1510
01:34:09,425 --> 01:34:10,690
to free 'em.

1511
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:12,757
(members murmuring)

1512
01:34:12,759 --> 01:34:15,258
So I ain't giving up.

1513
01:34:17,492 --> 01:34:19,724
I'm-a do what I got to do,

1514
01:34:19,726 --> 01:34:21,857
go wherever I got to go,

1515
01:34:21,859 --> 01:34:25,356
however I got to do it,

1516
01:34:25,358 --> 01:34:28,490
to free as many slaves
as possible...

1517
01:34:28,492 --> 01:34:30,523

1518
01:34:30,525 --> 01:34:35,356

this monster called slavery

1519
01:34:35,358 --> 01:34:36,623
is slain dead.

1520
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:38,490

Me?

1588
01:38:37,859 --> 01:38:41,490

01:38:54,759 --> 01:38:56,356
Ben.

1595
01:38:56,358 --> 01:38:57,623
Our Minty Moses.

1596

carrying on about.

1597

1598
01:39:01,459 --> 01:39:02,857
I'm gonna take you north
to see Robert,

1599
01:39:02,859 --> 01:39:03,690
Henry and Junyah.

1600
01:39:03,692 --> 01:39:05,523
But first I need you
and Daddy to go

1601
01:39:05,525 --> 01:39:06,757
to Reverend Green's church.

1602
01:39:06,759 --> 01:39:09,057
- You'll be safe there.
- BEN: Okay.

1603
01:39:09,059 --> 01:39:11,623
Hurry. Then meet me
at Brodess Farm.

1604
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:13,459
Yes, boss.

1605
01:39:20,625 --> 01:39:22,759
(labored breathing)

1606
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,290
No more. I don't want it.

1607
01:39:29,292 --> 01:39:30,890
It's for your nerves, Mama.

1608
01:39:30,892 --> 01:39:33,623
I don't want it!

1609
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:37,323
That girl is trying
to poison me.

1610
01:39:37,325 --> 01:39:39,659
She blames me for her mother.

1611
01:39:40,726 --> 01:39:42,824
Mama, you're just anxious.

1612
01:39:42,826 --> 01:39:45,726
I am suffocating in this place.

1613
01:39:47,392 --> 01:39:49,557
It's like being in prison,

1614
01:39:49,559 --> 01:39:52,356
awaiting my execution,

1615
01:39:52,358 --> 01:39:55,459
surrounded by hostile,
black-faced guards.

1616
01:39:57,425 --> 01:39:59,292

Gideon!

1617
01:40:00,592 --> 01:40:01,792

- Get him down here.
- We need restitution. - Absolutely.

1620
01:40:12,492 --> 01:40:15,724
Seeing as it's been discovered
that Moses is

1621
01:40:15,726 --> 01:40:18,757
a nigger girl from your farm,

1622
01:40:18,759 --> 01:40:20,623
we think it's only appropriate

1623
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:22,857
that you pay us restitutions

1624
01:40:22,859 --> 01:40:25,057

We're going through hard times,

1631

our fortune all but gone.

1798

if only you knew how to behave.

1799
01:51:34,659 --> 01:51:38,724
But you were unruly
and untamed.

1800
01:51:38,726 --> 01:51:41,358
I guess that's what
I liked about you.

1801
01:51:43,492 --> 01:51:46,523
And you liked me, too.

1802
01:51:46,525 --> 01:51:48,225
I know you did.

1803
01:51:50,292 --> 01:51:52,590
Praying for me when I was sick,

1804
01:51:52,592 --> 01:51:54,323
asking God to keep me well.

1805
01:51:54,325 --> 01:51:55,890
I asked God how
a sickly little boy

1806
01:51:55,892 --> 01:51:58,623
could think he owned me.

1807
01:51:58,625 --> 01:52:00,826
I do own you, Minty.

1808
01:52:02,059 --> 01:52:03,724
Even now, you're mine.

1809
01:52:03,726 --> 01:52:06,490
I was never yours, Gideon.

1810
01:52:06,492 --> 01:52:09,623
I was never nobody's property.

1811
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:11,623
Ever since your daddy
sold my sisters,

1812
01:52:11,625 --> 01:52:14,523
I prayed for God to make me
strong enough to fight.

1813
01:52:14,525 --> 01:52:17,590
And that's what I prayed for
ever since.

1814
01:52:17,592 --> 01:52:22,490
I reasoned that there was one
or two things I had a right to.

1815
01:52:22,492 --> 01:52:24,792
Liberty or death.

1816
01:52:26,592 --> 01:52:30,623
If I couldn't have one,
I'd have the other.

1817
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:32,557
You know what they're
gonna do to you

1818
01:52:32,559 --> 01:52:35,590
when they catch you?

1819
01:52:35,592 --> 01:52:38,356
They will tear you
limb from limb,

1820
01:52:38,358 --> 01:52:42,057
tar you, and burn you alive.

1821
01:52:42,059 --> 01:52:44,356

to watch it,
