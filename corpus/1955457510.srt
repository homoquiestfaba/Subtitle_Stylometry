Subs transcribed by johnnyrio, Enjoy! :)

2
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,270
I had a beautiful dream.

3
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:49,918
We had two old children.

4
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,019
Twins.

5
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,620
If we had children,
would you like it if they were twins?

6
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,721
Yeah. Twins...

7
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:06,322
Sure, why not?

8
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:10,223
One for each of us.

9
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,069
We have plenty of matches in our house.

10
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,270
We keep them on hand, always.

11
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:16,571
We have plenty of matches in our house.

12
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:21,172
Morning.

13
00:05:27,224 --> 00:05:28,624
Morning Donnely.

14
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:30,049
Ready to roll Paterson?

15
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:31,981
Yeah.

16
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:45,485
Yah but, you gotta know more.
Tell me.

17
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:51,245
Well, Hurricane Carter,
he was a famous boxer...

18
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:53,637
and he lived right back there,
Paterson baby.

19
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:58,038
He looked just like Denzel Washington too.

20
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:00,139
They locked him up.

21
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Why'd they lock him up?

22
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:07,041
They say... he shot some people up with a
shotgun in a bar and all that.

23
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:09,142
I know he didn't do it.

24
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,843
But then they finally let him out.
Right?

25
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:15,044
Yo, years later though!
But yeah...

26
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:17,645
You think before that, Hurricane Carter
ever shot somebody?

27
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:18,746
I don't know.

28
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:30,749
What are you gonna be for Halloween?

29
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,150
My mom found this picture on Instagram...

30
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:36,358
of these kids, they were shadows.

31
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:41,050
So they crept up next to the kids, other kids,
and they used to spook 'em out.

32
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,229
and looked like shadows.

33
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,589
One year I was actually a
Subway sandwich.

34
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,197
You can buy that one?

35
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,539
Um... no. I built it...

36
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:56,579
Dante Alighieri, the Italian.

37
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:48,129
Because of the bake sale this weekend...

38
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:53,031
I thought that if my cupcakes sell really well,
it might be kind of a sign.

39
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,520
A sign of what honey?

40
00:10:56,584 --> 00:11:00,766
My dream!
To have my own cupcake business of course.

41
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:02,648
Oh... that'd be nice.

42
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:10,059
Thank you for dinner.

43
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,301
You're welcome.

44
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,547
I made these myself.
What do you think?

45
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:16,006
Oh yah, that's really good.

46
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:18,543
I painted them.

47
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:20,634
I like how all the circles are different.

48
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:27,300
Was your sandwich for lunch okay?

49
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,649
Yah, it was a really great sandwich.

50
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:32,015
Good!

51
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:33,216
I'm glad.

52
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,572
Did you get a little writing done?

53
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:44,174
I did, yeah...

54
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:49,511
You know darling...

55
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:53,053
I really think you should do something
about those beautiful poems.

56
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:55,354
They should belong to the world,
you know?

57
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:56,606
The world...

58
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,077
Well now you're trying to scare me.

59
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,433
I am not.

60
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:02,603
I'm serious you big dumbell.

61
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:14,376
Do you think having such wonderful feet
helps you as a bus driver?

62
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:17,614
Driving that huge machine?

63
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:20,415
Hmm... yeah, maybe.

64
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,764
Does somebody need daddy to take
them for their nice little nightly walk?

65
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:31,788
Just remember...
What?

66
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,062
Cupcakes.
We could be rich from cupcakes.

67
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:35,725
Really?

68
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,052
Well I'm ready for that.

69
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:48,141
Stop.

70
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:11,502
Oh come on Marvin!

71
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:22,667
Stay.

72
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:24,865
Sit.

73
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:26,432
Stay.

74
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,207
Thank you.

75
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:53,115
Hey Paterson!
Right on time.

76
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:54,751
Hey Doc.

77
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:57,231
Look what the dog dragged in.

78
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:00,148
- How you doin' Paterson?
- Sam, good to see you.

79
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:01,021
Good to see you!

80
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:04,514
I don't think you ever met my brother before.
He lives in Philly.

81
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,328
- This is my brother Dave.
- Oh, wow!

82
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,881
- Hi, uh... nice to meet you.
- You too. You too.

83
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,700
So, uh... Sam and Dave...

84
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:17,875
Our folks were big soul music fanatics so...
that's that story.

85
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,774
I see.

86
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,150
Hey you know that Dave Prater from
the original Sam and Dave?

87
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,643
He used to live right here in Paterson.

88
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:23,686
Oh yeah, I know.

89
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,801
Got him right here baby!
On the wall of fame.

90
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:28,888
- Well it was nice to meet you!
- You too. You too.

91
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:34,411
Well Paterson...
my friend.

92
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:35,852
How's life doing?

93
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,237
Uh... yeah. No complaints.
You?

94
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:42,458
Yeah... same ol' same ol'.

95
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:43,694
Yeah.

96
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:47,205
Yo Doc!
The Rutger's game is on.

97
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,293
You never gonna get a damn
TV in here?

98
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,628
Hellll no!

99
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:52,463
Okay, okay!
I'm just askin'.

100
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:13,238
I'm gettin' my ass kicked today.

101
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:15,230
Who are you playin'?

102
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,930
Myself.

103
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,214
Cold.

104
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:31,936
You look beautiful.

105
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:39,074
I was dreaming that we
were in ancient Persia.

106
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:44,204
And you were riding on an elephant.

107
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:48,556
A big, silver elephant.

108
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:49,757
A silver elephant...

109
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:55,756
You looked so beautiful.

110
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:03,049
Did they have elephants in ancient Persia?

111
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,423
I don't think so.

112
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:08,682
Not silver ones anyway.

113
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:24,598
Morning Donny.

114
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,880
- Ready to roll Paterson?
- Yeah.

115
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:32,884
Everything okay?

116
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:36,252
Well, now that you ask...
no, not really.

117
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:38,597
My kid needs braces on her teeth.

118
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:42,132
My car needs a transmission job...
My wife wants me to take her to Florida...

119
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,333
but I'm behind on the mortage payments.

120
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:44,673
My uncle called from India...

121
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,074
and he needs money for my nieces wedding...

122
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:48,052
and I got this strange rash on my back.

123
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,035
You name it brother...
How 'bout you?

124
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:52,609
I'm okay.

125
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,610
Okay, well, have a nice day.

126
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,500
Okay. You too.

127
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:57,162
Yeah... I doubt it.

128
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,779
You know that cute little brunette
from the donut place?

129
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,342
- Yah, yah, she's pretty hot.
- Yah it turns out she lives in my neighborhood.

130
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:27,496
Yah, the other day I come home from work,
I'm tired, I'm havin' a beer, right?

131
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:30,224
I hear a knock at the door,
I open it, it's her.

132
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,271
- Really?
- She's all made up...

133
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:34,605
- lookin' like really good.
- So what happened?

134
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,184
So we just talked there at the door
for like... a while, you know?

135
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:43,173
And she was like laughing a lot...
She was, you know, making eye contact you know...

136
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:45,152
She wanted to hang out.

137
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:46,258
So, then what?

138
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:49,348
Well we just, you know
we had a really nice conversation...

139
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:53,918
and then, you know, I...
was really tired and everything...

140
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,628
and hadn't really showered or anything so...

141
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,519
she left.

142
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,794
She left?

143
00:20:57,795 --> 00:21:00,185
Yeah, well you know...

144
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:04,383
- I know what she wanted, right?
- Yeah. Yeah for sure Jimmy.

145
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:07,197
- These females are outta control.
- Right?

146
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:15,782
- Yeah, yup...
- They're outta control.

147
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:28,771
- Yeah, well? I had a similar thing happen last week man.
- Oh yeah?

148
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:31,973
Yeah, check this out...
I'm at Larry's barbecue party on Sunday, right?

149
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,849
- Larry had uh... barbecue?
- Yeah. The barbecue party...

150
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,430
and uh... I'm just standing out there
on the deck, right?

151
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,898
And I had already eaten a lot and
I'm just havin' a beer, right?

152
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,300
- Right.
- And you know that blonde friend of Larry's girlfriend?

153
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:47,122
- That um, Rita? I'm not sure you've met her.
- I dunno, Rita...

154
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:50,032
- Well she is like super hot, right?
- Oh yeah.

155
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:53,654
- And just like stacked too, just beautiful curves,
like an animal.

156
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:57,696
And you know, she comes over to me,
and she asks me what I'm doin' later...

157
00:21:57,697 --> 00:21:59,648
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, right?

158
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:05,543
So we talked for a little while and uh, she was
like really flirtacious too man, you know...

159
00:22:05,544 --> 00:22:12,895
Yeah, and finish my beer and... well man, you know, I had to
get up early for work the next morning and all that so...

160
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:13,896
- You split?
- Yeah. You know...

161
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,683
but it was cool though.
Um...

162
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:22,521
- I mean I knew exactly what she wanted, right?
- Right, yeah...

163
00:22:22,522 --> 00:22:24,731
I got her number too.
She gave me her number.

164
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:26,903
So did you call her?

165
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:30,586
Nah, not yet. No.

166
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:31,587
- Cause I figured I'd wait a couple of days.
- Right.

167
00:22:31,588 --> 00:22:35,278
- You know?
- Okay.

168
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,702
I should call her though.

169
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,464
- Yeah.
- I should.

170
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:46,052
You uh... you workin' late tonight?

171
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:49,925
- Yeah, I need the overtime.
- Yeah, me too.

172
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:45,402
Are you okay down here honey?

173
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:49,530
Uh... yeah.
Yeah I'm finished for now.

174
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:21,141
Now darling... you have two important things to talk
about before you and Marvin go out for your walk.

175
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:22,627
Oh... okay.

176
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,149
Two important things.

177
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,249
One's about you and one's about me.

178
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,062
Okay.

179
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:30,206
One's about your writing...

180
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:32,374
and you know what it is.

181
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:37,606
Please. Please make some copies.

182
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:41,031
You know that I know your poetry is really, really good.

183
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:44,995
And some day you might just decide
to let the world get to read it.

184
00:25:44,996 --> 00:25:46,148
-Well I really don't...

185
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:49,255
No. Look me in the eye for a second.

186
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,617
Look me in the eye.

187
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,941
You are a great poet.

188
00:25:55,903 --> 00:25:59,783
All your poems are still
in that one notebook.

189
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:03,117
- Your secret notebook.
- My secret notebook? Yeah.

190
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:08,000
So... will you finally just go to the
Xerox place or something?

191
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,277
Please! Just do it.

192
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:14,708
It would take about 10 minutes to make
a copy of your entire secret notebook.

193
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,634
I think it would take a little longer
than 10 minutes.

194
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:18,913
Okay, okay.
15 or 20 minutes.

195
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:24,299
I would even do it for you.
Baby, I've been asking for a year at least.

196
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,945
Yeah, you have.

197
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:30,500
Well maybe I could do it this weekend.

198
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:34,986
You promise?

199
00:26:37,945 --> 00:26:43,094
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you! I'll feel so much better.

200
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,350
What was the thing about you?

201
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:54,908
Well... it's not as important as that,
but...

202
00:26:56,774 --> 00:27:02,475
I've been thinking about music lately,
and then I saw this guitar on Youtube...

203
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:06,419
that Esteban demonstrates and
it's in black and white...

204
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,899
it's called a Harlequin.

205
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:13,178
And it's so fantastic that I really think
I need to learn to play the guitar.

206
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:17,906
And it comes with lessons, dvds, instructions so...

207
00:27:17,907 --> 00:27:21,713
in no time at all I could be playing
away and realizing my dream.

208
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,435
Uh... which dream is this?

209
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:27,525
Don't be silly!
To be a Country singer.

210
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:31,256
- Oh
- Maybe even a big star like one of the greats.

211
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:36,364
Like... Tammy Wynette or Patsy Cline...

212
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:42,253
and I can wear black and white and
have my own distinctive style.

213
00:27:42,254 --> 00:27:48,153
- I have a very strong visual style, as you know.
- Yes, yes you do.

214
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:51,607
Yeah, definitely.

215
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:55,220
Well... you really need this guitar?

216
00:27:55,221 --> 00:28:00,622
Oh yes, and they say it's so important to
learn new things as you get older...

217
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:05,305
and well music, you just don't know
where it could lead.

218
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:06,306
And...

219
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:10,698
it's only a few hundred dollars.

220
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,674
I know it's expensive but we
can pay a little each month.

221
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:16,616
And have free two day shipping.

222
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:22,761
- A few hundred dollars...
- It comes with lessons and instruction books...

223
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:28,425
and a tuner and extra strings and
hardcase and everything.

224
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:32,225
Well I think um... maybe...

225
00:28:36,021 --> 00:28:39,320
Maybe you could be a Country singer some day.

226
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:41,486
- Really?
- Yah, I mean I wouldn't put it past you.

227
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:47,482
Oh honey, thank you!
Thank you! I love you.

228
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,312
And I love you too handsome.

229
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,094
And I love you too handsome.

230
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:57,452
Hey, who's going out with daddy?

231
00:28:57,453 --> 00:29:00,622
Who's my good boy going out with daddy?

232
00:29:00,623 --> 00:29:03,399
Marvin's going out with daddy?
Yes.

233
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,327
Who's going out with daddy?
That's a good boy!

234
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,520
Good boy!

235
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:23,920
Aw, look at that!

236
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:25,239
Look at that right there.

237
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:30,116
- That's cute man.
- That's an actual creature.

238
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,648

Well it gives me somethin' to

Okay Marvin, don't get dog-jacked.

Paterson...

258
00:30:59,886 --> 00:31:02,420
I got somethin' weird,

259
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:03,419
Maybe.

260
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:04,834
What's this?

261
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:07,015
You know this cat?
Iggy Pop?

262
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,868
Oh yeah, Iggy and the Stooges.

263
00:31:09,178 --> 00:31:11,956
Paterson, New Jersey
Teen-age Girls' Club.

264
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:15,080
names singer Iggy Pop
World's Sexiest Man.

265
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:16,753
June, 1970.

266
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:17,659
Does it go up?

267
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,359
Yah, sure. Why not?
It's Paterson.

268
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,601
All right!

269
00:31:24,942 --> 00:31:27,320
Iggy Pop, on the wall.

270
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:33,968
Hey Doc, who's that right next to Uncle Floyd
holding the guitar?

271
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,837
I finally got ya?
Well that's new.

272
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,614
That's Uncle Floyd with Vito's
little brother, Jimmy.

273
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:41,181
He's a band leader on the
Conan O'Brien show.

274
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:43,381
Well that's a little past
my bedtime.

275
00:31:44,174 --> 00:31:46,883
Hey Marie, another Ginger Ale?

276
00:31:46,884 --> 00:31:50,125
- Thanks Doc.
- You know Paterson, right?

277
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:53,991
Uh... not really but we've seen each other.
Hey Paterson.

278
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:55,587
Hey. Hey Marie.

279
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,189
You drive the bus, right?

280
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,402
Yeah, I do.

281
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:01,846
Your name really Paterson or
they just nickname you that?

282
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:05,300
Uh... no. My real name is Paterson.

283
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:07,650
Well that's kinda crazy, right?

284
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:08,526
Yeah.

285
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:13,546
Aw shit...

286
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,082
- Everett's still not gettin' it.
- Not yet the numbskull.

287
00:32:19,242 --> 00:32:21,303
I've been breaking up with
him for two weeks now.

288
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:23,558
What am I gonna do?

289
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,154
- Marie, baby, I need to talk to you.
- No.

290
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:28,401
Please! Just talk to me
for a few minutes.

291
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:31,189
No Everett, we've talked enough.
More than enough.

292
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:32,279
Please?

293
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:42,414
- Hey Paterson.
- Hey Everett.

294
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,651
Thanks Doc.

295
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:04,489
Man, what would you do?

296
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:10,070
You love somebody...
more than anything...

297
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,688
in the whole damn world...

298
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:19,342
you... worship her.
You don't wanna be alive without her...

299
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:24,267
and she says she doesn't want you.

300
00:33:25,957 --> 00:33:31,292
You're just... dirt.

301
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,772
Damn brotha!

302
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,873
You should be an actor.

303
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:45,567
I am... an actor.

304
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:59,782
Aw yeah... that's real funny.

305
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:03,996
Man dyin' a heartbreak.
That, that's hilarious.

306
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:09,324
No.
We, are sympathetic.

307
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:12,127
Have another drink Everett.

308
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:14,056
On the house.

309
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:17,985
Thanks.

310
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:43,159
Morning.

311
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:55,955
You up?

312
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:35,365
Alright now. Hold her hand now.
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

313
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:38,686
Alright, we're looking both ways.

314
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:18,041
Hello darling!

315
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:19,328
Hello honey.

316
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,427
I'm painting.

317
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,874
Hello Marvin.

318
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,201
I see that.

319
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:31,520
What do you think?

320
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:36,162
Does it make everything more interesting?

321
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:40,108
Yeah, it's very interesting.

322
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:41,392
How was your day?

323
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,576
Oh, the usual.

324
00:39:46,244 --> 00:39:48,080
Get any writing done?

325
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:49,833
I did a little, yeah.

326
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:54,257
Working on a poem for you.

327
00:39:58,476 --> 00:39:59,550
A love poem?

328
00:40:01,106 --> 00:40:02,659
Yeah, I guess if it's
for you it's a love poem.

329
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:07,512
It's kind of inspired by our
Ohio Blue Tip matches.

330
00:40:07,986 --> 00:40:08,844
Really?

331
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:12,550
Does it mention the little
megaphone shape the letters make?

332
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:14,937
Yeah actually, it does.

333
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:17,437
How beautiful.

334
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,145
I can't wait to read it when it's done.

335
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,027
I also painted new shower curtains.

336
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:26,465
You should see them.

337
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,777
Oh, okay.

338
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:32,540
You know what else I did today?

339
00:40:33,044 --> 00:40:36,606
You uh... planted an unusual
vegetable garden in the backyard?

340
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:37,389
No, silly.

341
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,160
That you have to do in the spring.

342
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:42,807
- Oh...
- No, I ordered my present that's from you.

343
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,853
- Present that's from me? What?
- The guitar!

344
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:47,758
The Esteban Harlequin model.

345
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:50,401
- Ohhh...
- I'm so excited. It comes in two days...

346
00:40:50,402 --> 00:40:53,577
I didn't get to speak to
Esteban on the phone though.

347
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:55,802
Well, I'm sure he's really busy honey.

348
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:57,530
Don't make fun of me!

349
00:40:57,944 --> 00:41:01,991
Hey... look out though.
Cause Nashville? Here I come!

350
00:41:02,274 --> 00:41:03,233
Look out Nashville!

351
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:05,469
I'll get dinner ready.

352
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:07,379
We're having something new.

353
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:09,101
What is it?

354
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:10,363
Quinoa.

355
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:15,328
It's like a grain sort of?
Like Couscous but different.

356
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,698
I read that it came from
the ancient Incas...

357
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,444
and it's really good for you.

358
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:20,522
Oh!

359
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:26,840
We're having Quinoa Marvin.

360
00:41:36,964 --> 00:42:28,230
(freestyle rapping)

361
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:33,501
Hey Pugsley, what are you lookin' at?

362
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:40,885
Ah, I'm guessin' this is your human ball and chain,
right Pimpin'?

363
00:42:40,886 --> 00:42:44,968
Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I think it's
something really interesting that you are working on.

364
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,684
Well, I'm still workin' on it
you know.

365
00:42:46,685 --> 00:42:49,196
I'm trying to figure out, how...
how to spit it out.

366
00:42:49,405 --> 00:42:51,395
But thanks.
I really appreciate that.

367
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:53,412
Your laboratory?

368
00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:57,046
Wherever it hits me is where it's goin' be.

369
00:42:58,103 --> 00:42:59,069
Ah, well... good luck.

370
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:00,294
Thank you.

371
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:03,344
Yeah, thank you.
Appreciate ya!

372
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:05,471
Later Pimpin'!

373
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,241
Aight?

374
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:08,378
Peace!

375
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:33,326
All right, sit.

376
00:44:15,636 --> 00:44:39,838
(unintelligible joke involving
a bear and a bazooka)

377
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,807
I love how you smell when
you come home at night.

378
00:46:18,261 --> 00:46:20,269
What do I smell like?

379
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:28,815
You smell faintly of... of beer.

380
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:09,832
How do you say his name again?
It's like Gaitano Geh...

381
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,809
- It's Gaetano Bresci.
- Gaetano Bresci.

382
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,053
Yah, he um... he co-founded this anarchist
newspaper here in Paterson...

383
00:49:15,054 --> 00:49:19,130
but it was in Italian, called,
La Questione Sociale.

384
00:49:19,482 --> 00:49:21,045
La Questione Sociale.

385
00:49:21,353 --> 00:49:23,778
Yeah, he was born in Italy
but he lived here.

386
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:25,021
He was a weaver.

387
00:49:25,225 --> 00:49:26,397
An anarchist weaver.

388
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:31,722
This was in the 1890's... and at
that time in Italy people were starving.

389
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:37,232
When they demonstrated this Italian general had them
fire upon with like muskets and cannons which...

390
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:41,191
of course, resulted in a bloody massacre,
with like 100 people dead.

391
00:49:41,581 --> 00:49:42,952
Was Gaetano Bresci there?

392
00:49:42,953 --> 00:49:47,381
No, he was here in Paterson, but when he
heard the king of Italy...

393
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:52,971
King Umberto the first decorated this fucking
general for bravely defending his royal house...

394
00:49:52,972 --> 00:49:58,918
so Gaetano Bresci went over to Italy somehow and
he shot Umberto I, four times with a revolver.

395
00:49:59,024 --> 00:50:03,267
- Whoa! Did they kill Bresci?
- No. They captured him and put him on trial...

396
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:07,336
like famous anarchist's lawyer and everything,
but since there was no Capital Punishment in Italy...

397
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:12,134
at that time... like... 1900...
I mean... nor is there now...

398
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:15,383
You can't be a member of the European Union
if you practice Capital Punishment, of course.

399
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:16,874
They are not like here.

400
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:17,650
Yah.

401
00:50:18,052 --> 00:50:23,319
Anyway... they sent Gaetano Bresci to like this
prison island where they put all the other anarchists and...

402
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,269
after like a year he was found dead in his prison cell.

403
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:27,849
Murdered?

404
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:31,334
Well, yeah. Most likely by the guards,
but...

405
00:50:31,335 --> 00:50:33,476
there's a possibility he committed suicide.

406
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,607
Gaetano Bresci...

407
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:42,730
Do you think there are any other anarchists
still around in Paterson?

408
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:45,769
You mean besides us?
Not likely.

409
00:50:46,904 --> 00:50:47,921
What time is your first class?

410
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:50,092
- It's at 10:00.
- Wanna grab a coffee?

411
00:50:50,093 --> 00:50:51,026
Sure!

412
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:30,792
It's all warmed up for ya Donny.

413
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:32,541
All used up is more like it.

414
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:36,351
You okay?

415
00:53:36,352 --> 00:53:39,363
Well, since you asked... no,
not really.

416
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:43,119
My mother-in-law's moving in...
My cat got diagnosed with cat diabetes and,

417
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,931
the medicine you know... it's also expensive
and now my daughter started taking violin lessons...

418
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:51,464
and I'm losing my mind with the sound of that.
What can I say Paterson?

419
00:53:52,953 --> 00:53:54,359
Ya know, sorry.

420
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,131
Well, it's just my burden I guess,
my particular burden.

421
00:53:58,132 --> 00:53:58,989
K.

422
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,563
Well, see ya tomorrow.

423
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:37,000
Excuse me...

424
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:38,967
Are you okay here all alone?

425
00:54:39,373 --> 00:54:42,366
I'm fine. I'm just waiting here
for my mom and sister...

426
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:44,794
she's upstairs in that building over there.

427
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:47,408
Do you mind if I sit down until
your mom comes down?

428
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:49,962
Sure.

429
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:51,202
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

430
00:54:53,428 --> 00:54:55,164
- Are you a bus driver?
- Yeah.

431
00:54:55,788 --> 00:54:58,859
Do you ever drive one of those...
accordion buses?

432
00:54:59,498 --> 00:55:00,806
"Articulated"

433
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:02,288
Articulated.

434
00:55:03,931 --> 00:55:05,451
Well, accordion.

435
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:08,221
No, I just drive the regular one.

436
00:55:09,441 --> 00:55:10,746
Did you ever drive a fire truck?

437
00:55:10,747 --> 00:55:13,085
No. Just uh... buses and cars...

438
00:55:13,086 --> 00:55:15,449
and drove a big truck a few times.

439
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:19,017
But uh... that's it.

440
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:32,718
Are you... uh, interested in poetry?

441
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:34,276
Actually I am kind of.

442
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:35,376
- Really?
- Yeah.

443
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:36,786
I write poetry.

444
00:55:37,688 --> 00:55:39,168
I keep it all in this notebook.

445
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:42,888
Secret notebook.

446
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:44,134
Oh, you're a poet.

447
00:55:44,135 --> 00:55:46,842
- Yeah.
- That's great.

448
00:55:47,476 --> 00:55:48,523
Would you like to hear one?

449
00:55:48,524 --> 00:55:49,943
Sure, sure.

450
00:55:51,027 --> 00:55:53,278
It doesn't really rhyme though.

451
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:55,840
That's okay. I kinda like 'em
better when they don't.

452
00:55:56,112 --> 00:55:57,458
Yeah, me too.

453
00:55:57,662 --> 00:55:58,500
Okay...

454
00:55:59,402 --> 00:56:01,798
This one's called, "Water Falls"

455
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:03,146
Two words though.

456
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,011
"Water... Falls...", okay.

457
00:56:09,522 --> 00:56:10,913
Okay.

458
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,029
"Water Falls"

459
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,987
Water falls from the bright air.

460
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:17,867
It falls like hair.

461
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:21,270
Falling across a young girl's shoulders.

462
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:23,204
Water falls.

463
00:56:23,226 --> 00:56:25,981
Making pools in the asphalt.

464
00:56:26,307 --> 00:56:29,738
Dirty mirrors with clouds and buildings inside.

465
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:35,402
It falls on the roof of my house,
it falls on my mother, and on my hair.

466
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,829
Most people call it rain.

467
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:43,710
That's a beautiful poem.

468
00:56:44,288 --> 00:56:45,324
You really liked it.

469
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:47,563
Yeah, I really do. I think it's beautiful.

470
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:48,983
Water Falls...

471
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:50,278
Thank you.

472
00:56:51,635 --> 00:56:52,980
It doesn't rhyme exactly.

473
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:55,463
No, but the first two lines do.

474
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:59,471
In a nice way. And some nice
little internal rhymes too I think.

475
00:56:59,822 --> 00:57:00,834
Kinda rhymes.

476
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,922
Oh, my mom's done.

477
00:57:06,642 --> 00:57:08,662
That's my sister. We're twins.

478
00:57:11,551 --> 00:57:13,395
It was nice to meet you.

479
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:16,965
Nice to meet you too!
Nice to meet a... real poet!

480
00:57:22,461 --> 00:57:24,807
Do you like Emily Dickenson?

481
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:27,495
I do, yeah.
She's one of my favorites.

482
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,184
Awesome.

483
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:32,060
Bus driver that likes Emily Dickenson...

484
00:57:47,396 --> 00:57:49,991
Water falls, from the bright air.

485
00:57:55,761 --> 00:57:56,833
Falls like hair.

486
00:57:59,562 --> 00:58:01,793
Falling across a young girl's shoulders.

487
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:16,414
I'm so excited to see what you think.

488
00:58:20,573 --> 00:58:23,723
Some fresh Basil.
I grow it myself on the windowsill.

489
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:25,464
We're having pie for dinner?

490
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,311
Yeah, but a dinner pie.

491
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:29,933
Oh.

492
00:58:31,882 --> 00:58:33,029
What do you think
is inside?

493
00:58:33,939 --> 00:58:36,092
Uh... inside the secret pie?

494
00:58:37,377 --> 00:58:39,758
Uh, I dunno...
fish.

495
00:58:39,985 --> 00:58:41,615
No. Not fish silly.

496
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,238
Want me to tell you?

497
00:58:43,617 --> 00:58:45,470
- Uh... yes please.
- Okay.

498
00:58:46,669 --> 00:58:49,694
Cheddar cheese and Brussels sprouts.

499
00:58:51,575 --> 00:58:52,875
Seriously?

500
00:58:52,903 --> 00:58:55,322
Yeah! Baked into a pie.

501
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,381
Doesn't it sound delicious?

502
00:58:58,694 --> 00:59:01,509
You love Brussels sprouts and
you love Tuna cheese.

503
00:59:01,645 --> 00:59:04,533
I do, yeah.
No, it sounds very original.

504
00:59:07,563 --> 00:59:09,121
Is that a new recipe you found?

505
00:59:09,122 --> 00:59:10,650
No, I made it up.

506
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,330
A secret pie.

507
00:59:12,952 --> 00:59:17,011
I made a small one for Marvin.
He really seemed to like it.

508
00:59:31,052 --> 00:59:32,801
Mmm... hmm...

509
00:59:34,202 --> 00:59:35,581
Secret pie.

510
00:59:36,145 --> 00:59:37,745
Honey I'm glad you like it.

511
00:59:41,739 --> 00:59:46,441
Speaking of secret pie, I wanted to tell you
something about your secret notebook.

512
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:49,123
What?

513
00:59:49,124 --> 00:59:53,588
Did you ever hear of the old Italian poet,
Petrarch? Is that it?

514
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:55,906
Petrarch.
He perfected the sonet.

515
00:59:57,132 --> 01:00:01,433
I read online that one of his early books
of poems was called, "The Secret Book".

516
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:02,521
Just like yours.

517
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:04,331
I didn't know that.

518
01:00:04,577 --> 01:00:05,655
You read that?

519
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:08,159
You just happened 
upon it online?

520
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:16,118
And also that he wrote all his love poems
to a beautiful girl called, ta dah... Laura.

521
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:17,143
That's true.

522
01:00:17,144 --> 01:00:22,084
So you have many things in common with
other great and famous poets. You see?

523
01:00:24,475 --> 01:00:25,553
Do you not like it there?

524
01:00:25,554 --> 01:00:28,564
It's the waterfall.
It's your favorite place.

525
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:33,113
I'm not sure.

526
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,937
Oh yeah, it's nice there.

527
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:40,287
So remember you promised to finally
make copies of your poems this weekend.

528
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:42,852
I will, as soon as I have some free time.

529
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:45,551
You promised.
This weekend.

530
01:00:45,716 --> 01:00:47,456
I will. No.
I promised.

531
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:51,056
So why don't you recite me something...

532
01:00:51,257 --> 01:00:55,149
just a few of the lines maybe from a love poem.

533
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:59,462
Well, I... I can give you a
few lines that I didn't write.

534
01:01:00,485 --> 01:01:02,851
Are they by your hero,
Carlo William Carlos?

535
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:06,886
William Carlos Williams.

536
01:01:07,493 --> 01:01:09,151
I know darling, I was teasing.

537
01:01:12,786 --> 01:01:15,824
No, it's a poem by a girl I met.

538
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:18,426
A girl you met?

539
01:01:19,155 --> 01:01:22,312
Yeah, no. Like a little girl I met.
Like a 10 year old girl.

540
01:01:24,691 --> 01:01:25,734
She was on the bus?

541
01:01:26,362 --> 01:01:29,529
No. I met her on my way home
from work near the old factories.

542
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:33,766
She was waiting for her mom
and her sister...

543
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:38,391
and I noticed she had a notebook
of poems and she read one to me.

544
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:41,640
From her own secret notebook?

545
01:01:42,886 --> 01:01:44,402
Yeah, exactly.

546
01:01:45,042 --> 01:01:46,978
The picture of the falls
make me think of it.

547
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,187
Just remember how it started.

548
01:01:51,763 --> 01:01:53,785
Water falls from the bright air.

549
01:01:55,103 --> 01:01:56,728
Falls like hair

550
01:01:58,856 --> 01:02:01,272
Falling across a young girl's shoulders.

551
01:02:04,058 --> 01:02:05,020
Nice.

552
01:02:06,194 --> 01:02:07,748
Almost like one of yours.

553
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:11,632
Did she have long hair?

554
01:02:12,741 --> 01:02:14,078
No, she did. Yeah.

555
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,651
Laura, what's all that flour and stuff for?

556
01:02:23,137 --> 01:02:25,101
For my cupcakes, remember?

557
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,810
Saturday's my turn at the baking
booth in the farmer's market.

558
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:33,553
I remembered this morning but now
my god, it's the day after tomorrow.

559
01:02:36,102 --> 01:02:39,020
I have so many cupcakes to make.
Oh my.

560
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:43,576
You don't like your pie?

561
01:02:43,577 --> 01:02:44,968
No, I do.

562
01:03:18,747 --> 01:03:21,198
Our own Romeo and Juliet.

563
01:03:21,797 --> 01:03:24,127
Or maybe more like Anthony and Cleopatra.

564
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,890
Speaking of Romeo and Juliet...

565
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:29,265
Abbott and Costello.

566
01:03:30,448 --> 01:03:35,139
No, Lou Costello has got to be the most
famous person from Paterson.

567
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,504
Yeah, probably. I mean, yeah.
He...

568
01:03:37,705 --> 01:03:41,154
He's got that statue and he's got his own park.

569
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:44,564
Right. I mean Alexander Hamilton's 
got a statue. Others got statues.

570
01:03:44,565 --> 01:03:46,508
But not they own park.

571
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:48,953
Hell even (Phinney Whop?) don't have no park.

572
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,548
Yeah ol' Lou Costello.

573
01:03:57,413 --> 01:03:59,292
I wonder where Bud Abbott was born...

574
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:00,489
Ah, ???????

575
01:04:01,013 --> 01:04:02,473
Jersey also.

576
01:04:03,021 --> 01:04:05,766
Asbury Park.
Uh... 1895 maybe?

577
01:04:05,767 --> 01:04:06,504
You knew that.

578
01:04:06,505 --> 01:04:09,560
Well hell yeah man.
I know a lotta shit about a lotta shit.

579
01:04:10,569 --> 01:04:12,302
That Lou Costello.

580
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:13,929
Who's on first?

581
01:04:14,227 --> 01:04:16,860
Uh... Who's on first.
What's on second.

582
01:04:16,861 --> 01:04:18,068
I don't know who's on third.

583
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:19,333
Wait. Who's on first?

584
01:04:21,627 --> 01:04:22,724
Who's on first.

585
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:25,280
Who's on first.

586
01:04:26,274 --> 01:04:27,930
I'll tell ya who's on first.

587
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:32,213
And I'll tell ya what's on second too,
but you ain't gonna wanna know.

588
01:04:32,214 --> 01:04:33,640
I can explain sweetheart.

589
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:34,982
No, let me explain.

590
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:38,729
That is my cookie jar money.

591
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:44,585
That is money I've been savin' up
 so I could get my hair fixed...

592
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:47,503
That is MY money. MINE!

593
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,873
I promise. I will replace it!

594
01:04:49,874 --> 01:04:53,489
I will replace it after this
weekend's chess tournament.

595
01:04:54,097 --> 01:04:57,249
Chess tournament?
CHESS TOURNAMENT!?!?!?!

596
01:04:57,616 --> 01:05:03,217
Doc, you gonna need a chess 'tourniquet'
if you don't put that damn money back. 

597
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,474
You okay Doc?

598
01:05:34,604 --> 01:05:37,766
Paterson... you still don't
got a cell phone?

599
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,867
Uh... no, no.
I don't want one.

600
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:40,883
It would be a leash.

601
01:05:40,884 --> 01:05:42,779
What about the better half?
She got one?

602
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:46,590
She's got one, yeah. And a
laptop, and an iPad.

603
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:48,435
She doesn't want you to get one?

604
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,436
No.

605
01:05:52,484 --> 01:05:53,551
No, she's okay about it.

606
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:58,352
She understands me really well.

607
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:02,293
You're a lucky guy.

608
01:06:11,288 --> 01:06:14,579
The different shape can be
folded into something greater.

609
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:16,717
I'll tell you somethin' greater.

610
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,868
Hey Doc, what does Abbott and Costello
 have to do with Romeo and Juliet?

611
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,662
Please stay, please!

612
01:06:27,663 --> 01:06:31,428
Everett!
I would rather drop dead.

613
01:06:52,481 --> 01:06:54,093
Is there anything we can do?

614
01:06:55,163 --> 01:06:55,766
Nah.

615
01:06:55,767 --> 01:07:01,818
I always say... I'll try to change things
with ya, make 'em even worse.

616
01:07:44,132 --> 01:07:45,674
Good morning!

617
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:46,500
Mornin'.

618
01:07:54,448 --> 01:07:56,075
You're up late honey.

619
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:59,017
Your silent magic watch didn't wake you up.

620
01:07:59,018 --> 01:08:01,384
Yeah I was a little bit late today.

621
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,815
Well... some days something inside 
just doesn't wanna get up.

622
01:08:06,064 --> 01:08:06,952
Ever feel like that?

623
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:10,042
Today.

624
01:08:12,096 --> 01:08:14,835
Oh my.
I have so much to do.

625
01:08:16,272 --> 01:08:19,920
I know it's silly but I'm so excited
about the new farmer's market.

626
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:23,103
Becuase if my cupcakes are a big sensation...

627
01:08:23,104 --> 01:08:27,058
then I might be on my way 
to a very succesful business.

628
01:08:27,248 --> 01:08:30,231
That would be... amazing honey.

629
01:08:30,654 --> 01:08:31,501
And you know what else?

630
01:08:32,558 --> 01:08:34,325
My guitar should arrive today.

631
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,185
My Harlequin guitar direct from Esteban.

632
01:08:40,155 --> 01:08:42,263
Is Esteban going to deliver it personally?

633
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,346
Who knows?

634
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,282
Mmm. Smells good.

635
01:08:59,485 --> 01:09:00,951
I like your technique.

636
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:19,944
Morning Donny.

637
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,666
You okay?

638
01:10:22,025 --> 01:10:22,912
No, not really.

639
01:10:24,968 --> 01:10:27,359
You don't even wanna know.

640
01:13:03,997 --> 01:13:04,981
What's going on?

641
01:13:41,352 --> 01:13:44,884
I think it's probably best if we stand
as far away from the bus as we can.

642
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,207
It's not going to catch on 
fire or anything, is it?

643
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,718
It could explode into a fireball.

644
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,634
Well, no mam.
It's just an electrical problem.

645
01:13:53,212 --> 01:13:54,756
What's gonna happen to us now?

646
01:13:54,757 --> 01:13:59,005
Are we standed here?

647
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,524
No, no, no. Another bus will
come get us shortly.

648
01:13:59,895 --> 01:14:00,607
Dear God!

649
01:14:04,391 --> 01:14:07,069
Why is he going back in the bus
if he just told everyone to get out.

650
01:14:08,505 --> 01:14:10,118
I think we'll just get 'em off
over there if you don't mind.

651
01:14:10,119 --> 01:14:11,306
Thank you very much.

652
01:14:11,703 --> 01:14:14,191
Okay people, let's join the rest
of the passengers if we could.

653
01:14:14,192 --> 01:14:18,128
- Did we run out of gas?
- We got plenty of gas...

654
01:14:18,129 --> 01:14:20,132
this is just an electrical problem.

655
01:14:20,742 --> 01:14:22,081
Sabotage probably.

656
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:24,931
Okay... let's come over here.

657
01:14:26,447 --> 01:14:28,099
Another bus will come 
get us in a minute.

658
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:31,173
Okay everyone, I apologize again
for this inconvenience.

659
01:14:32,544 --> 01:14:35,529
I think it's best if we wait here
for a few minutes and uh...

660
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:38,126
I'll call now for a replacement bus.

661
01:14:43,401 --> 01:14:44,740
Don't you have a smart phone?

662
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:47,443
Uh, no, I don't. I don't.
Not with me.

663
01:14:47,963 --> 01:14:49,919
Would you like to use my phone
Mr. Bus Driver?

664
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,270
Oh, if you don't mind, thank you.

665
01:14:51,836 --> 01:14:53,809
So what's gonna happen to this bus?

666
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:58,794
Uh, well, a big truck is going to come
and tow it back to the depot.

667
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:00,534
- Awesome!
- Thank you very much.

668
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:03,513
K, I'll just be over here.
I apologize again.

669
01:15:18,534 --> 01:15:21,528
Hi, this is Paterson, bus #23,
I have a situation.

670
01:15:27,308 --> 01:15:29,134
Pluck all those strings together.

671
01:15:30,543 --> 01:15:31,593
There ya have your first chord.

672
01:17:22,143 --> 01:17:24,013
Surprise!

673
01:17:25,009 --> 01:17:28,049
Just sit down darling for a 
second and listen to this.

674
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:30,186
Okay.

675
01:17:42,169 --> 01:17:46,348
I've been workin' on the railroad...

676
01:17:46,349 --> 01:17:49,932
All the live long day.

677
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:54,625
I've been workin' on the railroad...

678
01:17:54,626 --> 01:18:03,424
Just to pass the time awaaaaaaaay.

679
01:18:04,564 --> 01:18:07,332
But it's pretty amazing right
for someone who never played before.

680
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:08,529
It's very amazing.

681
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:09,977
You just learned all that today?

682
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:12,765
Yeah, from these instructional DVDs.

683
01:18:13,613 --> 01:18:15,641
And I've been baking all day too.

684
01:18:16,494 --> 01:18:17,673
Well I'm very impressed.

685
01:18:17,674 --> 01:18:19,313
Isn't she beautiful?

686
01:18:19,627 --> 01:18:21,226
Yeah, you two were made for each other.

687
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,897
What's it called again, The Jester?

688
01:18:24,898 --> 01:18:27,247
- No, The Harlequin.
- Harlequin.

689
01:18:27,513 --> 01:18:29,026
And thank you my love.

690
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,953
You look a little drained.

691
01:18:34,906 --> 01:18:36,452
You're home a little late.

692
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,727
Was your day okay?

693
01:18:38,627 --> 01:18:40,775
Well it was until the bus broke down.

694
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,460
The bus broke down?
Was it dangerous?

695
01:18:43,461 --> 01:18:48,236
No, it just sputtered out.
It was an electrical problem.

696
01:18:48,237 --> 01:18:49,753
Electrical problem?

697
01:18:50,574 --> 01:18:53,892
Could it have exploded into a... fireball?

698
01:18:53,893 --> 01:18:57,085
No, no.
It's just an old bus.

699
01:18:57,324 --> 01:19:02,160
Well I think they should get their best driver
who is also a great poet a brand new bus...

700
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:03,481
it's the least they could do.

701
01:19:03,482 --> 01:19:04,573
City of Paterson?

702
01:19:05,817 --> 01:19:06,520
Not likely.

703
01:19:07,914 --> 01:19:09,960
Well honey I'm just glad you're okay.

704
01:19:13,533 --> 01:19:16,760
Maybe you should get a smart phone.
Just for emergencies.

705
01:19:16,761 --> 01:19:17,688
You know I don't want one.

706
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:21,237
The world worked fine before they even existed.

707
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:24,598
I know darling but sometimes
they make things easier.

708
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:31,322
Honey since the kitchen's a mess with all
my baking going on, couldn't we order out?

709
01:19:31,323 --> 01:19:32,661
Like, a pizza?

710
01:19:33,173 --> 01:19:34,977
Pizza's fine with me.

711
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:36,188
Great.

712
01:19:36,789 --> 01:19:39,490
And after dinner, while you
and Marvin go out...

713
01:19:39,491 --> 01:19:41,520
I could practice just a little more.

714
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:44,478
I wanna learn the rest of that song, at least.

715
01:20:06,123 --> 01:20:06,898
Harlequin.

716
01:20:23,516 --> 01:20:27,676
So what do they do, what, send a mechanic on
site, or tow the motherfucker, or what?

717
01:20:27,677 --> 01:20:31,768
Yah, yah. They come and tow it back to the depot,
and they send a replacement bus for the passengers.

718
01:20:32,556 --> 01:20:33,553
Man that coulda been a lot worse.

719
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:37,259
Damn thing could have exploded
into a fucking fireball!

720
01:20:43,728 --> 01:20:45,824
Hey, Doc, if you're not doing
anything tomorrow...

721
01:20:45,825 --> 01:20:48,303
they're having the new outdoors
farmer's market again.

722
01:20:48,942 --> 01:20:49,873
And I know for a fact...

723
01:20:49,874 --> 01:20:55,045
there's going to be some fantastic 
cupcakes for sale in the bakery booth.

724
01:20:55,837 --> 01:20:59,125
Oh, tomorrow's, uh... Saturday.

725
01:21:00,024 --> 01:21:03,230
I got that big chess tournament
going on over there in Camden?

726
01:21:03,231 --> 01:21:04,219
Right, right.

727
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,949
Okay. Well, good luck.

728
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:08,728
Yeah, thanks.

729
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:10,470
Hey fellas.

730
01:21:11,289 --> 01:21:12,778
- Hey Marie.
- Hey Shorty!

731
01:21:12,779 --> 01:21:15,106
How you and uh...
Romeo doin'?

732
01:21:15,107 --> 01:21:17,013
Please, Everett.

733
01:21:17,114 --> 01:21:19,016
And we're not doing.

734
01:21:19,017 --> 01:21:20,454
If anything he's acting worse.

735
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:23,402
I think the key word is acting.

736
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:27,583
Well, how well do you
really know him?

737
01:21:27,584 --> 01:21:28,812
We've known each other
since we were kids...

738
01:21:28,813 --> 01:21:31,252
and I really do care about him,
it's just...

739
01:21:31,755 --> 01:21:33,444
this whole girlfriend thing
was a big mistake.

740
01:21:33,658 --> 01:21:34,545
Obviously.

741
01:21:35,426 --> 01:21:37,994
It's cool.
He just needs to act out.

742
01:21:37,995 --> 01:21:40,854
He's always been that way.
He needs some kind of drama...

743
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:41,659
and then he gets over it.

744
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:43,782
Well he's not gonna do
anything crazy, is he?

745
01:21:44,272 --> 01:21:46,120
If you ask me, everything
he does is crazy.

746
01:21:48,706 --> 01:21:50,200
Speak of the devil.

747
01:21:51,259 --> 01:21:53,627
Baby, I need to talk to
you for a minute.

748
01:21:53,628 --> 01:21:55,324
Everett, why can't you 
just forget about me.

749
01:21:55,325 --> 01:21:56,879
Because I'm in love with you.

750
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,971
Well you can't have me.

751
01:22:04,872 --> 01:22:06,398
Okay.

752
01:22:10,287 --> 01:22:11,721
Okay...

753
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:20,167
Okay... then... NOBODY MOVE!

754
01:22:27,006 --> 01:22:30,227
If I can't have you then I
guess nobody can.

755
01:22:30,228 --> 01:22:31,028
Everett...

756
01:22:32,076 --> 01:22:33,423
stop acting crazy.

757
01:22:33,424 --> 01:22:33,974
Crazy?

758
01:22:33,975 --> 01:22:35,282
You wanna see crazy?

759
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,716
I'll show ya'll crazy!

760
01:22:43,049 --> 01:22:45,595
Smooth move Paterson.

761
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:53,308
Ya damn chucklehead.

762
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:55,920
Comin' in here, clearin'
out my place...

763
01:22:55,921 --> 01:22:58,353
I outta kick your black ass.

764
01:23:16,048 --> 01:23:18,817
Without love...

765
01:23:19,218 --> 01:23:21,628
What reason is there for anything?

766
01:23:33,802 --> 01:23:35,704
Thanks Paterson.

767
01:23:36,799 --> 01:23:38,725
That was very heroic.

768
01:23:39,468 --> 01:23:42,187
Yeah, wow, okay,
I dunno...

769
01:23:42,156 --> 01:23:43,628
If it wasn't for you...

770
01:23:43,629 --> 01:23:47,543
crazy motherfucker might have shot
himself to death with a piece of foam.

771
01:24:20,631 --> 01:24:22,130
Good morning.

772
01:24:24,743 --> 01:24:26,129
What time is it?

773
01:24:26,718 --> 01:24:28,327
It's Saturday morning baby.

774
01:24:28,477 --> 01:24:29,066
Oh.

775
01:24:31,002 --> 01:24:33,092
You were out a little late last night.

776
01:24:33,847 --> 01:24:35,236
Yeah.

777
01:24:35,983 --> 01:24:38,111
There was a...

778
01:24:38,922 --> 01:24:43,975
an... incident... at the... bar.

779
01:24:43,976 --> 01:24:45,634
Incident at the bar?

780
01:24:45,835 --> 01:24:46,899
What happened?

781
01:24:50,337 --> 01:24:51,906
- A guy had a gun.
- What?

782
01:24:51,941 --> 01:24:55,156
Well he had what I thought was a real gun
and he threatened this girl and...

783
01:24:55,157 --> 01:24:57,187
My God, he threatened a girl?

784
01:24:57,188 --> 01:24:58,438
He threatened to shoot himself...

785
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,494
Well because he's in love with her.

786
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:03,159
It's complicated, anyway,
and I tried to stop him...

787
01:25:03,424 --> 01:25:04,621
and I knocked the gun away and...

788
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,888
turns out it was a toy gun
that shoots little foam pellets.

789
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,472
It sure looked real though.

790
01:25:13,016 --> 01:25:14,471
Oh honey.

791
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:16,880
Oh that's so frightening.

792
01:25:18,274 --> 01:25:20,296
You acted so heroically.

793
01:25:24,754 --> 01:25:27,194
 I told you that place
could be dangerous.

794
01:25:27,195 --> 01:25:31,603
I mean anyone could just walk in there
 at any time with a shotgun or something.

795
01:25:32,121 --> 01:25:33,003
 Now you see what I mean?

796
01:25:34,019 --> 01:25:35,336
- Uh... yeah.
- Yeah.

797
01:25:35,337 --> 01:25:37,506
It was only a, only a toy gun.

798
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:40,383
Why are you up already?

799
01:25:41,099 --> 01:25:42,117
It's Saturday.

800
01:25:42,748 --> 01:25:45,802
I have to get my cupcakes,
go to the farmer's market.

801
01:25:45,737 --> 01:25:46,764
Remember?

802
01:25:46,765 --> 01:25:47,901
I do now.

803
01:25:51,013 --> 01:25:53,835
I smell cupcakes.

804
01:26:01,095 --> 01:26:04,624
I still smell a hint of beer.

805
01:26:20,685 --> 01:26:24,854
Wow! This looks
fantastic baby.

806
01:26:25,157 --> 01:26:26,462
Thank you.

807
01:26:26,463 --> 01:26:27,419
Thank you!

808
01:26:32,789 --> 01:26:34,392
Who's sitting in daddy's chair?

809
01:26:35,201 --> 01:26:37,007
Who's sitting in daddy's chair, huh?

810
01:26:40,144 --> 01:26:42,213
William Carlos Williams?

811
01:26:42,214 --> 01:26:44,750
Oh, no. Carlo William Carlos.

812
01:26:47,993 --> 01:26:50,074
Will you read me that
one I love so much?

813
01:26:50,075 --> 01:26:51,587
This is just the same.

814
01:26:51,588 --> 01:26:52,959
Comin' up...

815
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:02,670
This is just the same.

816
01:27:04,029 --> 01:27:06,913
"I have eaten the plums
that were in the ice box..."

817
01:27:08,426 --> 01:27:10,330
"and which you were probably
saving for breakfast"

818
01:27:11,677 --> 01:27:12,828
"forgive me"

819
01:27:12,829 --> 01:27:15,373
"they were delicious!"

820
01:27:16,604 --> 01:27:17,838
"so sweet..."

821
01:27:17,839 --> 01:27:20,183
"and so cold"

822
01:27:20,184 --> 01:27:22,416
Oh I love that poem.

823
01:27:22,417 --> 01:27:23,502
Yeah, that's a good one.

824
01:27:24,379 --> 01:27:26,072
And some of yours are just as good.

825
01:27:26,556 --> 01:27:27,172
Well...

826
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:32,473
Now remember your promised.

827
01:27:32,474 --> 01:27:33,900
I promised.

828
01:27:33,901 --> 01:27:35,746
I better get going.

829
01:27:35,747 --> 01:27:37,847
Could you put the rest
in the boxes?

830
01:27:38,843 --> 01:27:39,521
Sure.

831
01:28:02,016 --> 01:28:02,500
Okay.

832
01:28:03,433 --> 01:28:04,434
This is the last of 'em.

833
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:06,136
- Oh thank you.
- Oh wow.

834
01:28:06,137 --> 01:28:07,671
All together like this they look great.

835
01:28:08,343 --> 01:28:09,632
I'm so excited.

836
01:28:10,104 --> 01:28:11,057
Good.

837
01:28:11,058 --> 01:28:13,504
Okay they should be good
if you just drive slowly.

838
01:28:13,505 --> 01:28:15,031
Yah, yah. I will.

839
01:28:20,369 --> 01:28:22,095
You're not takin' him with you?

840
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:23,712
Oh honey, I can't.

841
01:28:24,404 --> 01:28:27,464
Maybe you could take him
for a walk later, huh?

842
01:28:28,868 --> 01:28:30,105
Love you!

843
01:28:30,771 --> 01:28:31,960
Yeah, I love you.

844
01:28:52,412 --> 01:28:53,183
Alright, come on Marvin.

845
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:15,897
Come on Marvin,
can't we stop here for a second?

846
01:30:20,864 --> 01:30:24,240
- Honey?
- Down here!

847
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:29,836
How'd it go?

848
01:30:29,837 --> 01:30:32,444
Oh, honey I'm so happy.

849
01:30:34,023 --> 01:30:38,699
You won't believe this but 
I made $286 dollars.

850
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,574
What? How?

851
01:30:39,575 --> 01:30:43,177
My cupcakes were a huge hit,
everyone's talking about them.

852
01:30:43,178 --> 01:30:44,427
That's fantastic!

853
01:30:45,675 --> 01:30:47,148
Marvin...

854
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:08,279
$286 dollars, cash money baby.

855
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,089
Wow!

856
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:10,852
I know it's no big deal...

857
01:31:10,853 --> 01:31:14,089
 it's just silly cupcakes but I'm
quite proud of myself.

858
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:15,508
Oh, yeah. You should be.

859
01:31:15,509 --> 01:31:17,126
Can we celebrate?

860
01:31:17,707 --> 01:31:18,127
Are you... yeah,
what should we do?

861
01:31:18,128 --> 01:31:21,342
First of all I'm gonna treat.

862
01:31:21,343 --> 01:31:22,392
Okay.

863
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:25,347
I'd like to go out to dinner,
and then go to the movies.

864
01:31:25,348 --> 01:31:27,410
We haven't gone to the movies in so long.

865
01:31:28,622 --> 01:31:31,224
Oh, no we haven't.
What should we see?

866
01:31:31,225 --> 01:31:35,957
You know that one theater at the mall now
shows old, scary movies on Saturday nights?

867
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:37,479
We can see an old, scary movie.

868
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,660
I'm gonna get changed and get ready.

869
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:41,126
I'm very proud of you.

870
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,418
And you my little man.

871
01:31:45,619 --> 01:31:49,345
You're gonna have to stay
here and guard the palace.

872
01:31:55,602 --> 01:31:56,933
Honey, should I change my shirt?

873
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,208
That'd be nice.

874
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:11,326
This is so much fun!

875
01:32:12,554 --> 01:32:15,703
It's like we're living
in the 20th century.

876
01:32:22,999 --> 01:32:25,753
- This is Mr. Parker, Lota.
- How do you do?

877
01:32:26,309 --> 01:32:27,303
Oh, don't be afraid.

878
01:32:28,726 --> 01:32:29,792
How... do you do?

879
01:32:30,153 --> 01:32:32,197
Mr. Parker has come to 
us from over the sea.

880
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:34,413
She's a pure Polynesian. 

881
01:32:35,092 --> 01:32:37,269
The only woman on the entire island.

882
01:32:38,236 --> 01:32:40,825
Well I'll leave you two
young people together.

883
01:32:41,293 --> 01:32:42,362
I've got work to do.

884
01:32:46,579 --> 01:32:48,546
Won't you sit down?

885
01:32:50,296 --> 01:32:52,876
You come from the sea?

886
01:32:53,378 --> 01:32:54,110
Well, rather...

887
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:57,031
3 days on an upturned lifeboat.

888
01:32:58,593 --> 01:33:00,393
You go away?

889
01:33:01,093 --> 01:33:02,211
Tomorrow morning.

890
01:33:04,114 --> 01:33:06,662
I wish you would not go away.

891
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:12,315
Well, that's very nice of you but...

892
01:33:13,222 --> 01:33:14,175
I must.

893
01:33:15,368 --> 01:33:17,300
You come back, again?

894
01:33:18,017 --> 01:33:20,545
Well I... I don't know.

895
01:33:23,167 --> 01:33:25,579
How does it happen that you're
the only woman on this island?

896
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:29,002
Did uh... Doctor Morreu bring you here?

897
01:33:30,591 --> 01:33:33,893
Pardon me if I seem to
be too inquisitive.

898
01:33:36,099 --> 01:33:37,368
Quickly, please!

899
01:33:39,809 --> 01:33:40,450
Get out!

900
01:33:47,514 --> 01:33:48,895
They're vivisecting a human being.

901
01:33:49,787 --> 01:33:51,331
They're cutting a living man to pieces.

902
01:33:53,006 --> 01:33:54,618
Now I know about his natives.

903
01:33:56,085 --> 01:33:57,253
They're his victims.

904
01:33:58,494 --> 01:34:01,403
I did love it, but it
was in black and white.

905
01:34:01,858 --> 01:34:06,392
Yeah, I haven't seen a black
and white movie in a long time.

906
01:34:08,425 --> 01:34:12,697
My favorite part was when the lead
guy kissed the wild panther girl.

907
01:34:14,082 --> 01:34:15,697
You look...
You look like her.

908
01:34:16,606 --> 01:34:18,222
You do. You guys
could be twins.

909
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:26,445
Well thank you for treating
me to dinner and a movie.

910
01:34:26,546 --> 01:34:28,181
I'm happy I could.

911
01:34:30,195 --> 01:34:31,190
We should do it every weekend.

912
01:34:31,731 --> 01:34:32,570
Yeah.

913
01:34:33,036 --> 01:34:35,125
Now that you're the
Cupcake Queen of Paterson.

914
01:34:36,342 --> 01:34:38,438
Cupcake Queen of Paterson.

915
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:40,244
Love it.

916
01:34:40,852 --> 01:34:41,870
Thank you.

917
01:34:54,447 --> 01:34:55,847
What is this?

918
01:34:57,496 --> 01:34:58,167
Marvin?

919
01:35:01,787 --> 01:35:04,865
Marvin...
Did you do this?

920
01:35:16,105 --> 01:35:17,450
Oh my god!

921
01:35:18,343 --> 01:35:21,311
It's your notebook.

922
01:35:24,471 --> 01:35:25,174
It's what?

923
01:35:26,993 --> 01:35:28,420
Your poems.

924
01:35:31,988 --> 01:35:34,103
Honey I'm so sorry.

925
01:35:40,646 --> 01:35:43,239
I don't know what to even say.

926
01:35:44,437 --> 01:35:49,928
You usually keep your notebook
down in the basement.

927
01:35:52,118 --> 01:35:56,261
I guess I...
left it up here on the sofa.

928
01:35:59,759 --> 01:36:01,337
That stupid dog.

929
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:05,956
He's gonna be put
out in the garage.

930
01:37:07,894 --> 01:37:10,423
Honey it's so early.

931
01:37:10,931 --> 01:37:11,871
It's Sunday.

932
01:37:14,005 --> 01:37:15,943
Please come back to sleep.

933
01:37:19,731 --> 01:37:20,543
Please baby.

934
01:37:21,192 --> 01:37:23,134
I will, I will baby.

935
01:37:24,174 --> 01:37:25,797
Go back to sleep.

936
01:38:49,721 --> 01:38:51,760
I don't like you Marvin.

937
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:05,250
Marvin, didn't I put
you in the garage?

938
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:07,624
No, it's okay. I let him
back in when I went outside.

939
01:39:08,086 --> 01:39:10,138
No, he's going back out there.

940
01:39:10,802 --> 01:39:11,782
Come on Marvin.

941
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,257
No. You're staying out there!

942
01:39:31,926 --> 01:39:35,177
I wish you would have read me
some of your most recent poems.

943
01:39:36,752 --> 01:39:38,721
Maybe I could have
remembered them.

944
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:39,985
It's okay.

945
01:39:42,366 --> 01:39:43,364
They were just words.

946
01:39:46,109 --> 01:39:47,716
Written on water.

947
01:39:49,367 --> 01:39:50,918
Baby I'm so sorry.

948
01:39:53,461 --> 01:39:56,081
I saved all the pieces.

949
01:39:57,274 --> 01:40:00,581
Maybe somehow they could
be puzzled back together...

950
01:40:01,318 --> 01:40:02,868
with a computer program or something.

951
01:40:10,128 --> 01:40:12,614
Is there anything I can
do to cheer you up?

952
01:40:14,746 --> 01:40:18,126
Should I play you the song
I've been learning on my guitar?

953
01:40:18,127 --> 01:40:19,689
Oh, no. That's okay.

954
01:40:20,615 --> 01:40:22,150
But I appreciate the offer...

955
01:40:22,151 --> 01:40:25,036
just maybe not right now.

956
01:40:25,037 --> 01:40:25,296
Okay?

957
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:31,892
Baby, you just wanna be left alone?

958
01:40:33,342 --> 01:40:34,984
Should I go out for a while?

959
01:40:34,985 --> 01:40:36,831
No, no, no, no.
It's okay.

960
01:40:44,009 --> 01:40:46,686
Maybe I'll go out.

961
01:40:47,552 --> 01:40:49,585
Take a little walk.

962
01:41:44,906 --> 01:41:45,882
Paterson.

963
01:41:46,505 --> 01:41:47,291
It's you.

964
01:41:47,492 --> 01:41:48,848
Hello Everett.

965
01:41:52,556 --> 01:41:56,121
I'm sorry... um...
about the other night.

966
01:41:56,122 --> 01:41:57,758
I kinda lost myself.

967
01:41:59,722 --> 01:42:00,458
Yeah.

968
01:42:02,792 --> 01:42:05,467
It's okay. Are you
doing better now?

969
01:42:08,396 --> 01:42:09,454
Yeah.

970
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:10,863
I guess so.

971
01:42:17,692 --> 01:42:18,388
You okay?

972
01:42:20,138 --> 01:42:21,449
You look a little low yourself.

973
01:42:21,973 --> 01:42:23,338
Yeah, you know...

974
01:42:26,574 --> 01:42:27,876
I'm okay.

975
01:42:29,323 --> 01:42:30,322
Well it's like they
always say...

976
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:34,263
"Sun still rises every mornin'
and sets every evenin'"

977
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:36,893
Always another day.
Right?

978
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:38,331
Yeah.

979
01:42:40,563 --> 01:42:42,474
So far.

980
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:44,922
So far? Yeah.

981
01:42:48,792 --> 01:42:53,312
So... I guess I'll...
see ya around then?

982
01:42:53,313 --> 01:42:54,313
Yeah, yeah. Take care.

983
01:42:54,314 --> 01:42:55,676
Yeah, you too.

984
01:43:59,662 --> 01:44:01,992
Excuse me please.

985
01:44:02,835 --> 01:44:03,396
Allowed to sit?

986
01:44:05,409 --> 01:44:06,163
Uh... yeah.

987
01:44:06,486 --> 01:44:07,206
Yeah, sure.

988
01:44:07,316 --> 01:44:07,955
Thank you.

989
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:52,459
Excuse me.

990
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,721
Maybe not ask is
to good behavior...

991
01:44:56,472 --> 01:44:58,037
but may I ask...

992
01:44:58,038 --> 01:45:00,896
you are from here in
Paterson, New Jersey?

993
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:02,741
Am I?

994
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:06,007
Uh... yeah.

995
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:07,630
Yes I am.
I was born here.

996
01:45:09,094 --> 01:45:10,017
Excuse me again...

997
01:45:10,643 --> 01:45:14,622
but are you knowing the great
poet, William Carlos Williams...

998
01:45:14,623 --> 01:45:17,157
here in Paterson, New Jersey?

999
01:45:19,739 --> 01:45:21,552
Well, I'm aware of his poems.

1000
01:45:23,223 --> 01:45:24,219
Excellent.

1001
01:45:30,581 --> 01:45:33,372
May I ask,
you too are a poet...

1002
01:45:34,482 --> 01:45:36,446
of Paterson, New Jersey?

1003
01:45:38,218 --> 01:45:41,416
Uh... no.

1004
01:45:43,764 --> 01:45:44,362
I see.

1005
01:45:51,549 --> 01:45:53,723
I'm a bus driver myself.

1006
01:45:54,679 --> 01:45:55,805
Just a bus driver.

1007
01:45:56,147 --> 01:45:58,758
A bus driver in Paterson?

1008
01:45:59,438 --> 01:46:00,798
Ahhh.

1009
01:46:03,664 --> 01:46:05,599
This is very poetic.

1010
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,248
Well I'm not sure about that.

1011
01:46:07,249 --> 01:46:09,054
Yes.

1012
01:46:09,055 --> 01:46:12,140
This could be a poem by
William Carlos Williams.

1013
01:46:15,576 --> 01:46:20,097
Did you know interesting French
artist, Jean Dubuffet?

1014
01:46:20,362 --> 01:46:25,258
He was meteorologist on top
Eiffel Tower, Paris in 1922.

1015
01:46:26,402 --> 01:46:27,806
Very poetic.

1016
01:46:29,376 --> 01:46:30,639
Yeah, Jean Dubuffet.

1017
01:46:32,424 --> 01:46:34,566
Yeah, he was a meteorologist.

1018
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:40,702
This I learned from your interesting poet...

1019
01:46:40,703 --> 01:46:42,904
Frank O'hara, New York City.

1020
01:46:42,905 --> 01:46:44,010
Yeah.

1021
01:46:44,889 --> 01:46:46,240
I read that too.

1022
01:46:46,241 --> 01:46:47,364
I like Frank O'hara.

1023
01:46:48,588 --> 01:46:52,880
The uh... New York School.

1024
01:46:53,777 --> 01:46:54,888
Uh huh.

1025
01:47:04,459 --> 01:47:06,247
I guess you really
like poetry then.

1026
01:47:07,610 --> 01:47:09,326
I breathe poetry.

1027
01:47:13,442 --> 01:47:14,800
So you write poetry?

1028
01:47:15,832 --> 01:47:16,910
Yes.

1029
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,333
My notebooks.

1030
01:47:23,313 --> 01:47:24,186
Oh, yeah.

1031
01:47:25,544 --> 01:47:28,643
My poetry only in Japanese.

1032
01:47:29,656 --> 01:47:30,569
No translation.

1033
01:47:32,242 --> 01:47:35,136
Poetry in translation is like...

1034
01:47:35,207 --> 01:47:37,858
taking a shower with raincoat on.

1035
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:42,150
I see what you mean.

1036
01:47:46,949 --> 01:47:48,981
I hope this isn't inappropriate behavior...

1037
01:47:48,982 --> 01:47:50,872
but may I ask what you are doing here in Paterson?

1038
01:47:52,776 --> 01:47:56,066
I come here to the city
of your interesting poet...

1039
01:47:56,067 --> 01:47:57,605
William Carlos Williams...

1040
01:47:57,606 --> 01:48:01,491
who lived and made his poems
here in Paterson, New Jersey.

1041
01:48:01,692 --> 01:48:03,987
- As you know.
- Yeah. He lived here.

1042
01:48:03,988 --> 01:48:04,749
He was a doctor.

1043
01:48:05,607 --> 01:48:06,784
Ah hah.

1044
01:48:09,391 --> 01:48:10,161
Ah hah what?

1045
01:48:11,706 --> 01:48:16,105
Also, Allen Ginsberg is
growing up here.

1046
01:48:16,968 --> 01:48:19,224
Also, Paterson, New Jersey.

1047
01:48:20,251 --> 01:48:21,342
Yeah, that's true.

1048
01:48:39,525 --> 01:48:41,149
I leave here tomorrow.

1049
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:42,697
Nice to meet you.

1050
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:47,684
Nice to meet you.
Are you going back to Tokyo?

1051
01:48:48,249 --> 01:48:49,349
No. Osaka.

1052
01:48:49,904 --> 01:48:50,457
Oh, Osaka.

1053
01:48:50,986 --> 01:48:52,486
Have a good trip.

1054
01:48:52,543 --> 01:48:53,295
Thank you.

1055
01:48:55,173 --> 01:48:56,042
I'm sorry.

1056
01:49:10,064 --> 01:49:11,553
A gift.

1057
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:12,580
A gift?

1058
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,841
Yes.

1059
01:49:15,753 --> 01:49:19,832
Sometimes empty page
