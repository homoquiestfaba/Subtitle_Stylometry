1
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I gotta lock up, son.

2
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You looking for faith,
forgiveness?

3
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm lookin' for the Bulls
to cover the spread.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Duffy's here.
You better have his money.

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I got it. I'm gonna have it.
What's the score?

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're into Duffy for at least five
grand. Who gave you an account?

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I laid six grand
with the Barber to get me even.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Chicago's down by four.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
- I got Chicago gettin' eight.
- Less than a minute to go.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hang on!
Just hang on.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Did you bet the Barber with
my money? You're not that stupid.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Shut up, Duffy. In 18 seconds,
you'll have your money.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, and he gets hammered,
and in it goes!

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Shit!

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, if he makes both,
it's eight. I push. I'm even.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Flagrant foul.
He shoots that first.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
- That's bullshit!
- You're screwed if he makes three.

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Grab him!

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Get off of me!

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm first, O'Neill!

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You always pay me first!

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You wanna kick my ass?

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No one can kick my ass
better than I can.

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey, Conor, it's Ticky!

25
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Did you bring money
for the summons?

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
- What's that?
- Did you bring money to get me out?

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
- Damn, you got "zactly's" breath.
- "Zactly's breath"?

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Your breath smells zactly like
your ass. Damn, that's nasty.

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Did you pay them?
They said it's 580.

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
- I need the tickets.
- Which ones?

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You got two pair on the floor
for the Bulls-Rockets.

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm gonna hawk those myself.
The game's not till 7:00.

33
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
- It's 5:00. Tell me where they are.
- What?

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
- Shit.
- Come on.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They're under the religious statue
on my dresser.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Wait, Ticky!
You gotta get 1,200.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
- You gotta pay to get me out!
- I already did.

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
- Yeah?
- It's Ticky. Let me in.

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Ticky. Thank God.

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I really need that money. How much
did you get for the tickets?

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Jesus!

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hey, O'Neill. Remember me?

43
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They grabbed me outside
the United Center.

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
- Yeah, you're the Barber's son.
- Yeah.

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Remember making that phone call
from Michael Pistone's wedding?

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
- Get off of me.
- You talked to me.

47
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You said, "This is O'Neill,
number 55. What's my limit?"

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So I check 55,
and I see you got six grand.

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So you put that six grand down
on Milwaukee, and they tank.

50
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So I ask my old man about O'Neill
on 55, and guess what he tells me.

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
- That guy died four months ago.
- Look, tell the Barber--

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You bet six grand on your
dead father's account.

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
- I need some money right now!
- I'll give you everything I got.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
All right. That's a start.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Relax.

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Forty-seven dollars.

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
All right, you owe 6,600.

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You pay me a grand a week
until I say stop.

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
- That's ridiculous. 500.
- 750. Bring it to the barber shop.

60
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You don't want me
to come back here.

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They grabbed me outside
the United Center!

62
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Excuse me. I'm Conor O'Neill.
I got an 11:30 with James Fleming.

63
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Can you lend me...

64
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
twelve grand?

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What-- do you need to
bury your father again?

66
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Did you dig the guy up
or something?

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
- What are you, freakin' sick?
- I'm sick?

69
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Four months ago
you come in here crying...

70
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
about how you need $5,000
to bury your old man.

71
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I talked to Mahoney
at Mikey's wedding.

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It seems he also gave you
5,000 to bury the guy.

73
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And I'm gonna pay Mahoney back.

74
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't give a shit
how much you owe Mahoney.

75
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Listen, Jimmy, I'm really up
against it right now with Duffy--

76
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I really don't give a shit
how much you owe the bookies.

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Come back in here.

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You know, this...

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
just might help you.

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
- Jimmy, this is only 500 bucks.
- I know.

81
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're going to coach
a kids' baseball team with me.

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Jimmy, I don't think you understand
how serious my situation is.

83
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm gonna pay you $500 a week
for the next ten weeks.

84
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's week one.

85
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
- Jimmy, I ain't no good with kids.
- You know, Conor...

86
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I do this to give something
back to the community.

87
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You don't want to do it,
give me the check back.

88
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So, I'll see you
at the field tomorrow.

89
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
- 3:30.
- Where is it?

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Right behind that Baptist church
where you used to buy reefer.

91
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The only thing behind that church
is those shitty housing projects.

92
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

93
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll whack this shit to the gate.
You ain't gonna mess with me.

94
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Shit.

95
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yo, check out Coach Jimmy's whip!
Oh, damn, this shit is pimped.

96
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Whoa, guys,
don't touch the car.

97
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yo, Coach Jimmy.
Here's my extra inhaler...

98
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and here's my Sugar Babies
for when my blood needs sugar.

99
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Mom says I do better
when my blood's got sugar in it.

100
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What's your name again?

101
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
- Jefferson Albert Tibbs. But--
- Everybody listen!

102
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That gentleman behind you
is Coach Conor.

103
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He'll be taking over
the day-to-day operations.

104
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
- What?
- That bum guy's our coach?

105
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Coach Conor just stopped by
to give you the equipment.

106
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Jimmy, I can't do this by myself.

107
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Here's your roster, schedule,
Sugar Babies, inhaler.

108
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I gotta be in New York three weeks.
Training seminar. Can't be avoided.

109
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
- Good luck.
- Hey, wait, Jimmy.

110
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
- Wait.
- What's wrong with that man?

111
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Wait, wait, wait!
How am I gonna get my money?

112
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Every Monday, Ellen will have
a check for you. Gotta go.

113
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
- Five hundred, right?
- Every Monday.

114
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
- Five hundred every Monday.
- You bet.

115
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll see ya.

116
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
- Andre Ray Peetes?
- 'Sup, my brother!

117
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
- What position do you play?
- Big Willie.

118
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Whatever, man--
back catcher or center field.

119
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I got mad power.
I pound the shit to the gate, yo!

120
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Damn right.

121
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Miles Pennfield II?

122
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
- This dude.
- Him.

123
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What position does he play?

124
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He says he can pitch, Coach Conor,
but I might pitch too.

125
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
- What's your name?
- Jefferson Albert Tibbs.

126
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Mom says I can play anywhere.

127
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
My asthma and all,
I should probably play first.

128
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I gotta keep my sugar up too.

129
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You know, Mom said that
some boys just plain big-boned.

130
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And some boys
just plain fat-assed.

131
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Hi. Matt Hyland,
head of the coaches' committee.

132
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
- You the Kekambas?
- What?

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
- Are you the Kekambas?
- Yeah, bitch, we the Kekambas.

134
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So, what's up?

135
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Where's James Fleming from
Smyth and Stevens Securities?

136
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He's out of town on business.
I'm assisting him.

137
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What do you got--
six or seven kids?

138
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If you can't field a team,
the league'll drop ya.

139
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll tell Coach Fleming--

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is Darryl Mackey.
He's the president of the league.

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Last year was a mess.

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We had to cancel games
because we'd show up...

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and the other team
would have five kids.

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Waste of everybody's time.

145
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We're just trying to save everyone
a whole lot of trouble, okay?

146
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If you can't field a nine-man team,
you and the Kekambas should go home.

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Talk to Jimmy Fleming at
Smyth and Stevens Securities...

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and submit a roster by Friday.

149
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
- Friday.
- All right?

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yo, Coach.
Kofi and Ray Ray want to play.

151
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is that Kofi Evans and...

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
- Raymont Bennet?
- Yeah, Coach.

153
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But Miss Wilkes
ain't gonna let them play.

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Wait, hey, hey!

155
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Who's Miss Wilkes?

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
She teaches Saint Malachy. She gets
on my damn nerves, I swear to God!

157
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
She is real mean, Coach.

158
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
She's an old nasty lady. She tell
your moms every little thing.

159
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Do you know she called my house
every night last year? Every night.

160
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
- She won't let these guys play?
- Hell, no!

161
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
She said they couldn't play ball
until they do these book reports.

162
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
- Kofi ain't doin' shit.
- Ray Ray neither. They're like...

163
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
"Bitch, quit that noise. "

164
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hey, can we cool it
with the "bitches"?

165
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Shit, man.

166
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Coach, it's gettin' kinda late.
We gotta go soon. We practicin'?

167
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Not today.

168
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Thursday, 4:00 here.

169
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Cool.

170
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Miles, wait up!

171
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
My mom's meetin' me at Southside
Pizza. I ain't walkin' by myself.

172
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I wanna go to Southside
with you.

173
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
- You wanna just cut up Ashland?
- Whatever, man.

174
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't wanna walk through
folks' loop. Damn Disciples.

175
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Glock, nine millimeter.

176
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hey, you know about
my karate right?

177
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
- Man, do you mean karate?
- Nah, it's karate.

178
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Learned it from my cousin
who was in Japan in the army.

179
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Lightning quick!

180
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is the tiger.

181
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No man can defend himself from
the fury of a karate tiger man.

182
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah, Dre-- a tiger.
Okay.

183
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I only use the tiger when I'm
fightin', like, a dozen guys.

184
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
More than that,
I use the bear.

185
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
- What's the bear again?
- I can't show you!

186
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Man, that's the secret code
of the karate honor.

187
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hey, wait up!

188
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
- Yes?
- Sister Wilkes?

189
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm Conor O'Neill.
I wanted to talk to you about--

190
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's okay.
It's just my head.

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Who are you here to see?

193
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
- Sister Wilkes.
- I'm Miss Wilkes.

194
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
- Do you teach here?
- Yes.

195
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just expecting...

196
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
an older woman.

197
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
- Well, I'm not a nun.
- Thank God!

198
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I mean, that's great.

199
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Is Kofi Evans and
Raymont Bennet in your class?

200
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Are they in my class.
Yes, they're in my class.

201
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I need them to play baseball
for the Kekambas.

202
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh, yeah. That's something you
should take up with their mothers.

203
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
- But the kids told me--
- Both mothers agreed...

204
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the boys would read one book before
they start baseball in the spring.

205
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Hey, I got
no problem with that.

206
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You know, I think reading's
real good for kids.

207
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You work for
Smyth and Stevens Securities?

208
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
- Yes.
- What deal did you blow?

209
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What?

210
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Well, I'm sure you're not
coaching this team by choice.

211
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
My associate, James Fleming,
is in New York for three weeks...

212
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
so I volunteered to help out.

213
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I would have loved
to have coached that team.

214
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I was away on business--
Canada--

215
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the day Mr. Smyth
and Mr. Stevens chose the team.

216
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Canada.
That must have been nice.

217
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Lovely.

218
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I was in the business part
the whole time though.

219
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's wonderful you're teaching
these boys to play baseball.

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's just a shame no one spends
any time helping them to read.

221
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Listen, I'm Conor.

222
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Elizabeth.

223
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm only helping out
with the team for two weeks...

224
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
but I'm willing to get together
with you and help the boys out.

225
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
- Why don't we exchange numbers?
- I have a better idea.

226
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll give you a copy of the book
the boys are supposed to be reading.

227
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You read it, and then you can
talk to them about their reports.

228
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
God.
That would be great.

229
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Conor O'Neill,
coach of the crack babies.

230
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can't coach that team.
I'm serious. I'm bailin' out.

231
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
- How'd it go with the nuns?
- God, she was beautiful.

232
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You picked up a nun?

233
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Shut up.

234
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You still want your half
of the Blackhawks seats I got?

235
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah. Where are they?

236
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm gettin' them tomorrow.

237
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Bring 'em to the baseball field
on Loomis...

238
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
tomorrow between 4:00 and 5:00.

239
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Loomis?
That's the friggin' projects!

240
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't screw me.
I'm not in the mood.

241
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
- I need that money.
- I'll be there at 5:00.

242
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
- Before 5:00.
- O'Neill.

243
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Easy, slugger, all right?

244
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Relax.

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You got some cabbage for me?

246
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Can we talk outside,
without the bat?

247
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Duffy, you knew my dad.

248
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I wouldn't be callin' in a favor
if I wasn't completely racked.

249
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
- You smashed up my bar.
- I'll pay you. I just need time.

250
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It ain't my money.
Now, I can't carry you anymore.

251
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll help with the book, take bets.
I'll bring in business.

252
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No, that's not gonna work.

253
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Listen, I gave them your name
because I couldn't carry you.

254
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What?

255
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Are you saying some jag-off goombah
is gonna come and break my thumbs?

256
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Duffy, I'm desperate.

257
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm coaching
a kids' baseball team...

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
in the projects for a guy
who's paying me 500 a week.

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But I'm paying the Barber off.
What should I do?

260
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Should I tell the Barber to back
off? Start paying you every week?

261
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Keep payin' the Barber...

262
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
but don't come around here
unless you got the money.

263
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm Pearla Evans, and this one's
Kofi. This is my youngest, Jarius.

264
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Everybody call me
G- Baby, so--

265
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is my sister's boy,
Raymont.

266
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Miss Wilkes said you're going to
help with their assignments...

267
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
- so they could play ball.
- Yeah, that was before I had this--

268
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Miss Wilkes said she had
a good feelin' about you.

269
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
- I figured I'd give it a try.
- Miss Wilkes said that?

270
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
No. She said she had a good feelin'
about them all playin' ball.

271
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
- But I'll tell you now, Mr. --
- O'Neill. Conor O'Neill.

272
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You don't help these boys,
they don't do this work...

273
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
hell will be paid
with your ass.

274
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I can reach you at Smyth and
Stevens to plan a tutoring session?

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
- Yes. Of course. Anytime.
- Good.

276
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
- Go on, boys.
- Yeah, come on!

277
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah, come on, man.
I'll beat you up, man.

278
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Come on now. Yeah.

279
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
- What?
- This ain't no giddyap show.

280
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, like this.
Like this.

281
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Come on, Ticky.
You're killin' me.

282
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
We usually quit at 5:30.

283
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Mom needs me home.

284
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
- We eat around 6:30.
- No, keep practicin'.

285
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm waiting for somebody.
We'll be done soon.

286
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
- I'll let you know, Albert.
- I'm Jefferson.

287
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Come on, man, pitch the ball!

288
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Shut up!

289
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
- You wanna hit me? Huh, bitch?
- Oh, shit.

290
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And if I did, what you gonna
do about it, you little punk?

291
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Hey, that's enough!
That's enough, all right?

292
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
- Shit, I wanna see some blood.
- Will you guys cool it?

293
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Practice Saturday, 1:00,
all right?

294
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
- What?
- Can I walk with you?

295
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No. I'm not goin' that way.
Sorry.

296
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But--

297
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yo, what's up, my B?

298
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What's up, shorty, man?
Hey, gimme that pizza, my man.

299
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
- What up, boy?
- Open the bag.

300
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Take it! Just let me go!

301
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
- Let go the bag, punk.
- You got it. Let's go!

302
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Thanks for the bag, fool!

303
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I think it makes you
look tough.

304
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
- Is he okay?
- Who are you?

305
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm the coach.
Conor O'Neill.

306
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Why did you
keep them so late?

307
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Fool, I called you
at Smyth and Stevens Securities...

308
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and at first, some little girl
didn't even know who you were.

309
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Then some man named Fleming
got on the phone...

310
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and told me you were
out of the office today.

311
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Please, take my home number.

312
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You can't keep them boys
out there after dark.

313
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Thank Jesus
for Jefferson's strength.

314
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That smell?

315
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That might be a lawsuit.

316
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Look at you. You don't even look
like you're holdin' it together.

317
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Jefferson, I'm sorry.

318
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I shoulda called practice,
you know, when it got dark.

319
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I just came by because...

320
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
as soon as you're ready
we expect you back, huh?

321
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And...

322
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I needed to know
what number uniform you wanted.

323
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You're never gonna stay
being our coach.

324
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Enjoy the game.

325
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Nice wheels, soccer mom.

326
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
- Up yours.
- What's with the wagon?

327
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Smyth and Stevens took shit when
a kid got beat up after practice...

328
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
so they lent me this car
to get 'em all home.

329
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Ah, man. Who got beat up?
Who needs tickets?

330
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
- Jefferson Tibbs.
- That's the fat kid, right?

331
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah--
How'd you know?

332
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You told me about
every kid on the team.

333
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Aw, shit. I hate it when people
mess with kids.

334
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Jesus. It's so wrong.
How can I help you fellas?

335
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Mister, you just sold us
tickets to last night's game.

336
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Don't make me shoot you! When a man
needs crack, a man needs crack!

337
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You're unbelievable, man.

338
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
- Need seats? Need two?
- How we doin' tonight?

339
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
"We"?

340
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We aren't doin' so good.
San Jose's not such a hot ticket.

341
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
- Did the Bulls cover last night?
- Yeah, they won by nine.

342
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Shit.
I couldn't get any action.

343
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I need to find someone
who'll take a big bet.

344
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Fink's minimum bet's two grand.

345
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
- The guy at the cement plant?
- Yeah, Fink the cement guy. Why?

346
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
- I wanna lay 12 G's.
- 12 grand? On what?

347
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Since Jordan left, the Bulls have
never covered at home against Miami.

348
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
- You serious about this?
- They play Miami on the 26th.

349
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
- You shouldn't do this.
- I don't have a choice.

350
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Take me to meet Fink.

351
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
- Come on.
- Programs here!

352
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Okay. Okay.
I'll take you to see Fink.

353
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Sell some tickets.

354
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
- Who need tickets, folks?
- Who needs tickets?

355
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
- Pay up, bitch!
- I'll kick your ass, bitch!

356
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Cool it! Cool it!
What's goin' on?

357
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
All right. Let me break it down
to you right quick.

358
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Andre say he can catch any
pop- up ball anybody can throw.

359
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Kofi say "That's bullshit.
You a busta."

360
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Andre say, "Roll up, bitch. "

361
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Kofi say, "I'll give you all
my gum if you catch this ball. "

362
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
He threw the ball. Andre caught it.
Andre say, "Pay me my money."

363
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Kofi say,
"You a cheatin' bitch. " No, wait.

364
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
- Kofi say, "You a motherf--"
- Okay, I got it. Thanks.

365
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay, I want everybody
to take a position. Let's go.

366
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's practice.

367
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Damn, man, you suck,
just like my girlfriend.

368
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Nice catch, Andre.

369
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You jackass.
Keep chasin', punk.

370
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Give me the ball.

371
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
- Damn!
- What happened?

372
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Kofi just jumped
out of the way like a baby!

373
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
- What's your problem?
- Why is everyone so quiet?

374
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
What's up, Kofi?
You scared of the ball?

375
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
New rule!

376
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
No one can say anything bad
to anyone else on the field! Got it?

377
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What?

378
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You can't talk shit
you got nothin' to say?

379
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Let's hear it.

380
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
- Got it.
- Got it.

381
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Way to use your head,
Jamal.

382
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's cool, Jamal, man.
Don't worry about it.

383
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
"Four Spanish men with hiking boots
had surrounded me close.

384
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I could tell they were banditos
because they had taco breath...

385
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and they called me 'hombre.'

386
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I spun around and hit the biggest
one. I punched him in the gut.

387
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And as he was falling,
he grabbed my backpack.

388
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I said, 'Stop, you banditos! I don't
want to have to hit anyone else. '

389
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But because they were Spanish,
they didn't understand me.

390
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Two more jumped me, and I hit one
of them in his--" Between his legs.

391
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
"My mouth banged on his head.

392
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And that was where
I got my fat lip. The end."

393
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
- So where'd you get your fat butt?
- Andre, that's enough.

394
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That was very nice, Jefferson.

395
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Excellent use
of the first-person narrative.

396
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I was scared of the banditos.

397
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It was good.
Okay, sit down.

398
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Mr. O'Neill.
Fresh from the office?

399
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Why don't you invite your pants down
to your shoes so they can party?

400
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Everyone,
this is Mr. O'Neill...

401
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
who coaches a baseball team
that some of our young men play on.

402
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
He's taken the time out of
his busy day to give us a hand.

403
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So give him your attention.

404
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
A Wrinkle in Time is
an important book...

405
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and I liked it very much.

406
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm just sayin'
it ain't like that.

407
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Fantasy ain't reality.
I like to read stuff that's real.

408
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
- Give me an example.
- Michael Jordan's book.

409
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
- Nice book, man.
- Excellent choice.

410
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
A strong piece of literature,
a great read.

411
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
- Yeah.
- That's a biography.

412
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
That's the real story of his life.

413
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
This is fiction.
The story's made up.

414
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's meant to entertain you
and make you think.

415
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Kofi, you haven't spoken up. All
you've said is you didn't like it.

416
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That's right.

417
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
If you can't say more, I'll assume
that you didn't really read it...

418
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and your mother's gonna
want me to call her.

419
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
- Did you read the book?
- Yeah.

420
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
- Tell me something about it.
- It was booty.

421
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Okay. I'm gonna
call your mom tonight.

422
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
That girl Meg is dumb.

423
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
She think her father
comin' back from wherever.

424
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
That's stupid to believe in.

425
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
That girl and her mom is
both trippin'.

426
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
'Cause where I'm from,
don't nobody's father come back.

427
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Come on, right here!

428
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yo, let's do this!
I'm ready to beat 'em!

429
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Come on! Hurry up!

430
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Maybe this year you could
turn a double play.

431
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Got the uniforms, Coach...

432
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and your check.

433
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
- I take it you're not staying.
- Sorry. Can't.

434
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Next time.
Good luck today.

435
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Thanks. Thanks for
giving back to the community...

436
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
dickhead.

437
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
- I want seven like last time.
- I want number four!

438
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Find a shirt that fits
and put it on, okay?

439
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
This shirt smells like
my grandma.

440
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Good to see you, Jefferson.

441
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
- Who's got number 11?
- Coach, I got it here.

442
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Thanks. Jefferson, this is
the biggest shirt we got, all right?

443
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Everyone, the shirts go up
in sizes from two to 11, okay?

444
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Coach, I need a shirt.

445
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Who's got number ten?

446
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
- I got it.
- Give it to Jamal.

447
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Where's my shirt?

448
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Hey, guys. Guys?

449
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Why don't you guys play catch
in the outfield, okay?

450
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Warm up. G, hang on.
Hang on. I wanna talk to you.

451
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
- How old are you?
- I'll be nine in October.

452
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You're supposed to be nine before
August to play in this league.

453
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But I wanna play.

454
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
There's only ten uniforms,
11 players.

455
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So I gotta give the guys
who are old enough first pick.

456
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
But I'm on the team, right?

457
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Hell, yeah!

458
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Play ball!

459
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Strike.

460
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
He's out!

461
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
- Strike!
- It's all right, Ray Ray.

462
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Strike!

463
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Strike!

464
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Strike!

465
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Strike! Out!

466
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
- Come on!
- Throw it!

467
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Damn!

468
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
- Come on! Get down! Get down now!
- Safe!

469
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh, my God, he caught it.
Throw it!

470
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
What the hell--
Damn it!

471
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
- Okay, I'm gonna break your ass!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

472
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Come on, baby,
you can do this.

473
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
- Keep goin', Kofi!
- Go! Come on, Kofi!

474
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Keep going!

475
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Safe!

476
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Good job.

477
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Strike! Out!

478
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That's all right. That's the way
to take your cuts. Good job.

479
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
- Yeah?
- Coach, I guess that's it.

480
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I mean, the league says we can't
start another inning after 6:30.

481
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

482
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's 6:37 now,
and we're up 16 to 1.

483
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
- That's cool. Thanks.
- Good luck the rest of the way.

484
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate? Kekambas!

485
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Damn, Miles, you don't even
know how to throw the ball!

486
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Shut up, Ray Ray. At least
he ran after it when it went by.

487
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Shit went through your legs
like five damn times.

488
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You a little punk, Dre.
Least you throw like one.

489
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm tired of your shit, bitch.

490
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
- Kick his ass!
- Hey, that's it! That's it!

491
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
- That's it. That's it!
- I'm gonna kill you!

492
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
- Kofi, you're close to being done.
- I quit!

493
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
- This team sucks, man!
- Oh, hell, no. Damn it!

494
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
- Shit! This is you, Dre.
- This is all your fault, Dre.

495
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Anybody hungry?
How 'bout pizza?

496
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm down with that shit,
my brother.

497
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You got three large pies,
11 pops.

498
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's 44.65.

499
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You like hockey?
Blackhawks fans?

500
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I take the wife and kids every year
to the Negro Hockey Hall of Fame.

501
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Man, the only thing black
at a Blackhawk game is the puck.

502
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'll give you two loge seats
for the Bulls/Mavericks on Sunday.

503
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
- For the pizza?
- For the pizza.

504
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Done deal.

505
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yo, Coach! If I get a home run next
game, you gotta buy me pizza again.

506
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Every run I score,
I get one slice.

507
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You bustas is trippin'.
Only me gettin' pizza every game.

508
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
MVP--
Most Valuable Pizza eater.

509
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yo, Coach,
I should be pitching.

510
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
- You wanna pitch, Miles?
- Yes, sir.

511
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
- Yeah. You can pitch on Wednesday.
- Yes!

512
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Coach, is there any chance
that we'll get trophies this year?

513
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Let's see.

514
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
There are eight teams
in the league...

515
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
play everyone twice--

516
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
We gotta win more games
than we lose.

517
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
- Yes!
- So we go to the 'ship, right?

518
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
- Yeah, we could.
- Man, we goin' to the 'ship.

519
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
We goin' to the 'ship, whoa.
We goin' to the 'ship.

520
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
All right, Andre.

521
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
This is it, right?

522
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Don't you wanna
see my house?

523
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Sure.

524
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
What?

525
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Everyone's sittin' on the floor.

526
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You stay below the window.

527
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
What?

528
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Bullets.

529
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
What do you do
around here for fun?

530
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Play baseball with you.

531
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
- See ya on Wednesday.
- Okay.

532
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Safe!

533
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You ready, Miles?

534
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Want me to hold
your Walkman?

535
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Come on, Miles.
You do your stuff now.

536
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
- Let's go, pitcher!
- Come on, Miles!

537
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
- Strike!
- Damn.

538
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Strike!

539
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
- Strike! Out!
- Shit.

540
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
- What's he listenin' to?
- Same song...

541
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
- over and over.
- What is it?

542
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
"Big Poppa" by Notorious B. I. G.

543
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Want one of his tapes?
He made five of 'em.

544
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
How's it go?

545
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I love it when you call me Big Poppa

546
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
He waves his hand in the air

547
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
if you a true player

548
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I see some ladies tonight

549
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
that should be havin' my baby, baby

550
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Strike!

551
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Strike! Out!

552
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Strike! Strike!

553
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Strike! Out!

554
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
We won our last game.

555
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Miles is an amazing pitcher.

556
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Oh, I heard.
Nine to three over the Gandas.

557
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm just helping out till
my colleague returns from New York.

558
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
- You're great to take the time out.
- Hey, listen...

559
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
why don't we have
dinner tonight?

560
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
What good is an expense account
if you don't pad it once in a while?

561
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I can't.
It's a school night.

562
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
- Maybe some other time.
- After the game on Saturday?

563
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
- Saturday.
- The boys would love you to come.

564
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

565
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You're not really tryin'
to get Miss Wilkes, are you?

566
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
- No. Why?
- Good.

567
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
'Cause I already tried,
and she ain't havin' it.

568
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Do it, Jamal!

569
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Kofi wanna come back...

570
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
but first I have to
"regotiate" his contract.

571
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
- Ball one!
- Okay.

572
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
- What are the terms?
- One, you tell Andre...

573
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
that Kofi's the best player.

574
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Two, only Kofi gets pizza
when he hits a home run.

575
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Three, if he whacks it over the
gate, he gets a pizza to take home.

576
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
One, when the season's over, the
team votes on who's the best player.

577
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Two, Kofi can have the same
pizza bonuses as everyone else.

578
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Three, if he hits it
over the fence...

579
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I'll buy him a pizza.

580
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Okay. Let me discuss
the regotiations with my client.

581
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Put your back into it,
Jefferson!

582
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Here! Light this sucker up!

583
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
- Go, baby!
- One more run!

584
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
What's up, Coach?

585
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Kofi Evans.

586
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
- I spoke to your agent.
- I can come back?

587
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
If it's cool with the team.
But you start shit with Andre...

588
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and you're done-- okay?

589
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
- Run!
- You're out!

590
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

591
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The Kintus! The Kintus!
Yea, Kintus!

592
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You're great with them.

593
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Thanks.
Are we on for tonight?

594
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
- Tonight? I don't know.
- It's not a school night.

595
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Come on--
just for dinner.

596
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Look, the place is well-lit.
People can hear your screams.

597
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm not sure. Where?

598
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It's on the corner
of Clark and Addison-- Slugger's.

599
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
How 'bout 9:00?

600
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
9:00. Clark and Addison.

601
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
- All right.
- All right?

602
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah.

603
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Did you miss a payment
with the Barber?

604
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah.
I shined him this week. Why?

605
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
That goofy dork Gino
came into Duffy's asking for you.

606
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Oh, Jesus.

607
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
- Ticky, this is Ed.
- Ed.

608
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
- How you doin'?
- Pleasure.

609
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
This is Conor O'Neill.
He wanted to meet you.

610
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
What do you do
for money?

611
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm a trader
at Smyth and Stevens.

612
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Bullshit. First lie.

613
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
You gonna beat me one time so you
can pay off whoever else you owe?

614
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
- I wanna make a big bet.
- How big?

615
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
- Twelve grand.
- And?

616
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And, if I win...

617
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I wanna get paid.

618
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
No bullshit to keep bettin' it.

619
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
This guy's too serious.

620
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I got a handful of clients,
they lay a hundred grand a week.

621
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
- They're not emotional about it.
- I can cover it.

622
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
You seem too emotional about
this 12 grand. Desperate.

623
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
What are you,
a psychiatrist or a bookie?

624
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Don't you want your number?

625
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
You gonna take my bet?

626
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
- Ed, what's the next number?
- 27.

627
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
You're account 27 when you call in.
And your handle is?

628
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Kekambas.

629
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
What? Kekambas?

630
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
- Kekambas.
- Ed, you got it?

631
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
- Got it.
- You're a strange kid, Kekambas.

632
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm interested to see
what happens with you.

633
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Gino, get him.

634
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Fuck this.

635
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Account 27. Kekambas.

636
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah. What's the line on Chicago
tomorrow night against Miami?

637
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Gimme Miami minus six.
Twelve grand.

638
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Wait. Wait.

639
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I'll take Chicago
and the six points.

640
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah. Twelve thousand.

641
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

642
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Why don't we sit?

643
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So, I wanted to talk to you.

644
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you too.

645
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

646
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
What's wrong?

647
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I come here all the time
with the guys I work with.

648
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Look, I know you don't work
at Smyth and Stevens.

649
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Look at you. I could tell
right away you weren't a broker.

650
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
What's that mean?

651
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Nothing. You just don't look like
you work at Smyth and Stevens.

652
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
You look like a freakin'
boring schoolteacher.

653
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Hey, why'd you come here?

654
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
To bust me in the lie
about where I work? You win.

655
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You coach my kids.
I thought we had a common interest.

656
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Elizabeth, I get paid under
the table to coach that team.

657
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And I only do that...

658
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
'cause I'm in a big hole with two
bookies who are lookin' to kill me.

659
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
- What?
- Nothing.

660
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You know all this.

661
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I spoke to Jimmy Fleming after
Jefferson got beat up. He told me.

662
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
- You just think I'm a big joke.
- No!

663
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You know, it's people like me
that make people like you...

664
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
feel better about your tiny life.

665
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
This is unbelievable. I can't
believe I came down here for this.

666
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Yeah? Then why did you come
if you know I'm a liar?

667
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Because those kids trust you.
And they don't trust anybody.

668
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
- I told you, I coach for money.
- Well, I teach for money.

669
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I've had the best fifth graders in
the world, but some don't make it.

670
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
There's nobody besides their mother
or me telling them what to do.

671
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So what?

672
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I'm done with all that.

673
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Well, I just came down here
to see what they see...

674
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
because they're never wrong.

675
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Take a good look.
See what they see.

676
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
- I came to talk to you about a job.
- Yeah?

677
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Well, unless it pays
12 grand an hour...

678
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I'm not interested.

679
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
- Did you play it?
- Yeah.

680
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
- Twelve grand? Yes!
- Twelve grand.

681
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
- Coach! Can we have a word?
- How many points you givin'?

682
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm getting six.

683
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You took Chicago?
Are you on crack?

684
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
- You laid 12 grand on those--
- I'm under a lot of pressure.

685
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
- I said now!
- Win or lose, I'm outta here.

686
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
- Darryl Mackey, league's president.
- We met.

687
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Coach, we're concerned about the age
of some of the boys on your team.

688
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Can you produce birth
certificates for your players?

689
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
All I got is what Coach Fleming
at Smyth and Stevens gave me.

690
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Here they are.

691
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
What are the names of those
two boys at second base?

692
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
- Andre and Jamal.
- Which one's Jamal?

693
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
The taller one.

694
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
This birth certificate's
been altered.

695
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
What?

696
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
The eight's been turned
into a nine.

697
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You have to be born
after September of '88.

698
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, the kid is out of the league,
and the Kekambas are on probation.

699
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Look, what are you guys--
the cops?

700
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
What's the point
of the league, Coach?

701
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
To teach kids it's okay to lie, as
long as they can get away with it?

702
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It should be about
these kids playing ball...

703
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
not the trophy
you bring to work.

704
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Look, the kid goes now.

705
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Okay?

706
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Jefferson bats seventh,
plays first base.

707
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Miles pitches and bats eighth,
and Clarence...

708
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
you play third and bat ninth.

709
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
- Cool.
- Okay, let's go.

710
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Why I not playin'?
You mad at me?

711
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Jamal, the other coach--

712
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
'Cause I'm sorry about pushing
Ray Ray. I just want to play.

713
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
They know you changed your birth
certificate. I can't let you play.

714
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
But my mom said it was okay.

715
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
She said that she would tell them
if they asked. She said it was okay.

716
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
- I just wanna play.
- There's nothin' I can do.

717
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Look, why don't you
just sit--

718
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Miles, do your stuff now.

719
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Strike.

720
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Strike! Out.

721
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Yeah, baby.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

722
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Time, Blue.

723
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I can't have this kid out here
with these things on.

724
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
- What now?
- We're just all in agreement.

725
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
The kid can't wear headphones
while he pitches.

726
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Matt makes a good point
about safety.

727
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You're kidding me, right?

728
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
What if he gets hurt because he
can't hear in a dangerous situation?

729
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
- There's liability issues.
- Bring it in, fellas.

730
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
- Come on, bring it in.
- What are you doing?

731
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I want you guys to explain
to them why they lost Jamal...

732
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
and why Miles can't
wear headphones...

733
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and why the Bua Was and the Waatas
have nice uniforms...

734
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
and we have shitty T-shirts.

735
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Easy, Coach.
You're already on a warning.

736
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
This is the president...

737
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
and that is the coach
of the goofiest team in the league.

738
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
They kicked Jamal out because
he was born two weeks early...

739
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and now they're makin' Miles
take his headphones off...

740
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
'cause he's pitchin' too good.

741
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It's a safety issue.

742
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Fellas, you understand everyone
has to follow the same rules.

743
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
That's some weak-ass bullshit,
you bitch-ass, mother-freakin' bustas.

744
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
What did you say?

745
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I believe he said,
"That is some weak-ass bullshit."

746
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
- Was that it, G-Baby?
- Yeah, that's it.

747
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
You are on thin ice, pal! I could
have you removed from this league.

748
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
This is my last game. I quit.

749
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
What?

750
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I'm out.

751
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I got business out of town.

752
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Kekambas, back on the field.

753
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Son, no headphones.

754
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Coaches, get back to the dugouts.

755
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Come on, let's go.
Get out there.

756
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Come on! Let's go!

757
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
What'd you expect? I was gonna
coach this team the whole year?

758
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Rally, rally,
the pitcher's name is Sally!

759
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
All right, Calvin.
Big stick now.

760
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
What have you got, son?

761
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Shit!

762
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Hang on. You guys suck.

763
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
- Whatever. I just quit.
- Finally.

764
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
- I'll see you at the game.
- Yeah.

765
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
- Slugger's.
- Yeah.

766
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Next practice
is Saturday, right?

767
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
01:00. Someone's gonna be here.
Right?

768
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'll make sure someone's here
on Saturday for practice.

769
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Coach, can't you at least
give us a ride? I mean--

770
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
- It's early. You can walk.
- Could you drop us off?

771
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Don't you think I might have
something more important to do...

772
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
than worry about you guys and
your stupid little baseball team?

773
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Can we please go in now?
I gotta take a piss.

774
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
- We're watching through the glass?
- I feel better out here.

775
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
All right.

776
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
He can't get in there.
Jones fires.

777
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Shit!

778
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
- Jones is ice cold!
- It's all right.

779
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Fourth quarter, we're up
by two points, you're getting six.

780
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.
- Come on. You're up right now.

781
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Ride it out.

782
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Nice play by Tillman.
He's got it.

783
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Here we go.

784
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Smith throws up a prayer.
It's good! Holy shit!

785
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
- Should I look?
- No, no!

786
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Not looking is working.
Keep not looking.

787
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Oh, God, Ticky.
Am I out of the woods?

788
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Here we go.
Miami inbounds.

789
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Don't foul!

790
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Shit! They fouled him!
Williams will shoot two!

791
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Oh, God, Ticky. Never again.

792
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
- Shit!
- What's happening?

793
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Talk to me!
What's happening?

794
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Williams at the line.

795
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
- Williams makes the first.
- Shit, shit!

796
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
- He makes the second, you're dead.
- Williams shoots 80%.

797
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Williams shoots. It's in.

798
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Shit.

799
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
- What am I gonna do?
- Miami by seven.

800
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Oh, my God, Ticky.

801
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I was down 11 grand
before I made this bet.

802
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Smith dribbles inside, half-court.

803
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Heaves a 30-footer!

804
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It's in!

805
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
- You covered! Yes, it's good!
- What's the final score?

806
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Miami by four! You covered!

807
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
- You covered 12 G's!
- I covered!

808
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I love it when you call me
Big Poppa

809
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Throw your hands in the air
if you's a true player

810
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I love it when you call me
Big Poppa

811
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place

812
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
What
'Cause I see some ladies tonight

813
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
- That should be havin' my baby
- Baby

814
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Hey! You take this party
somewhere else.

815
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Kiss our ass, Duffy.
He beat Fink tonight for 12 grand!

816
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
- You got my six grand?
- Tomorrow.

817
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Hey, no-neck, play this.
Make yourself useful, huh?

818
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
- So you took Fink for 12 large.
- Yeah.

819
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Now what?

820
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

821
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
We're rolling it on the Bulls
Saturday night.

822
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I'll take that action on Ticky's
number if you wanna play it.

823
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
We'll bet it with Fink.
We covered tonight.

824
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
We got Vancouver Saturday night.
We'll cover again. 24 grand.

825
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Yeah. 24 grand.

826
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Then what? Hey, you think
you just won the game of life?

827
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
- What next?
- I don't know.

828
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
If you win that, what
are you gonna do with your life?

829
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
You gonna coach baseball
for black kids?

830
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I don't know.

831
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I don't know, Duffy.

832
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Maybe I'm just a loser, right?
Not like you.

833
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Mr. Big Time, huh?

834
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
- I'm just a loser.
- All right, O'Neill.

835
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I want my money tomorrow.

836
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Night-night.
Time for beddy-bye, Coach.

837
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Don't talk down to me!

838
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
You don't know shit
about those kids!

839
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

840
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Chicago landers brace for
the long-awaited interleague...

841
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
crosstown matchup between the Sox
and the Cubbies tonight at Comiskey.

842
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
In a battle between two of the
game's brightest young hurlers...

843
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
21-year-old Jon Garland will face
off against the red-hot Kerry Wood--

844
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It's Ticky.

845
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I'm alone, I promise.

846
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I'll take off my underwear and stand
naked in your hallway to prove it.

847
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I'm naked now.
It's beautiful. Come on.

848
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'll slide my nuts under
your door till you let me in.

849
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
What's up?

850
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I paid Duffy.
We're square.

851
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Did you call Fink? Are we down
on the Bulls? How many points?

852
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Fink wants to see
that I've still got his money.

853
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Great. Let's go by there, flash him
a little cash and bet the 12 grand.

854
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
What's with you?
We're gonna do this, right?

855
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Yeah, okay. I just gotta
go by the baseball field.

856
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
- Jesus Christ. I thought you quit.
- I did quit!

857
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
- I gotta drop the equipment off.
- I don't know.

858
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
... matchup between the Sox
tonight at Comiskey.

859
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Sammy Sosa will attempt to go yard
for his fifth consecutive game...

860
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and the Big Hurt will attempt to
break his 11-game hitting slump.

861
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
We're just an hour
from game time.

862
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
We'll be back
to take your calls.

863
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
All right. See ya.
Hurry up, okay?

864
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
- You here to tell us you quit?
- That's old news.

865
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I left a message for Coach Jimmy
I would drop off the equipment.

866
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
He should be here
any minute.

867
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
- Yeah. Keep goin', sucker.
- We goin' to the 'ship alone.

868
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I can't bet the 12 grand.

869
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Fine. I understand.
We should just bet six grand...

870
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
and wait till we get
breathing room--

871
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
No, I can't.

872
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Get your bum ass outta here, 'cause
we a better team without you anyway.

873
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I'm not listening to any of you.

874
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I'm not listening to you
or any of you!

875
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
So good luck.
Good luck on your own.

876
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Call me when you get
to the 'ship without me.

877
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Cold.

878
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Good luck. I'm so glad
I'm done with this.

879
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Let's go. If Fink thinks we're
coming, we should at least stop by.

880
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
If we don't want to bet it,
we don't, you know, technically--

881
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
How many of you guys been to a big
league park for a baseball game?

882
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
That's what I thought.

883
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
You guys will never be a team until
you see it played right. Never!

884
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Gimme that.

885
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Listen, you're stressed out.
Let's grab a bite.

886
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
- We can call and lay the bet.
- I'm out!

887
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
You hear me? I'm out!
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!

888
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
- You're out.
- I'm done.

889
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I'm done with all that.

890
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Well, you gotta call Fink
for me.

891
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
You can't just dissolve
a partnership like that.

892
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I'm flapping
in the breeze here.

893
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Seriously. I got nothin' now.
I'm flappin' in the breeze here.

894
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Kekambas. Come on.
Let's go. Get in the car.

895
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Game starts in an hour.
Come on. Let's go.

896
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
What's this? What are we doing?
What is happening here?

897
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Hey, let's--
Let's bet three grand.

898
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Three grand will be fine.
I mean, what's goin' on?

899
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Where we-- What are we doing?
Come on, wait.

900
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Come on.
Now wait, wait!

901
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
This is against everything
that's right!

902
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs!

903
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
- Second row!
- Big league right now.

904
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
We got second row!

905
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Coach, thanks for the seats.
They hot, yo.

906
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Yo, check it out!
That's Sammy Sosa over there!

907
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
- Where?
- Right there!

908
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Man, that ain't
no Sammy Sosa.

909
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Shut up, man!

910
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Look, y'all, look!
There's Sammy Sosa right there!

911
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Look! Right there!

912
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Yes?

913
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Missed me.

914
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I wanted to apologize
for the other night.

915
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I have had better dates.

916
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Yeah. I'm sorry.

917
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I heard about the baseball game.
The boys loved it.

918
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Yeah. It worked. We've won
three in a row since then.

919
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Do you have any idea
how much that meant to them?

920
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I was thinking...

921
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
how the other night you knew that
I wasn't really a stock trader...

922
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
and that I had
a big gambling debt.

923
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And if you were there
to offer me a job...

924
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
it might still stand.

925
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
So you're not here
to ask me out.

926
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Am I supposed to be?

927
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
We need a physical activities
coordinator.

928
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
- You and me?
- The school.

929
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You know, someone to supervise
after-school recess...

930
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
organize games and sports.

931
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
- We'd like to get a guy because--
- I think you like me.

932
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
- What?
- I just got this gut feeling...

933
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
when you were looking at me...

934
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
that you like me.

935
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Are you interested?

936
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
In the job?
What are we talking about here?

937
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I'm interested.

938
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I'm interested in anything
I'm supposed to be interested in.

939
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Let's go, Bua Was!

940
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
What's everybody
lookin' at?

941
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Why we gotta play them damn boo-boos
again, man? They kicked our ass.

942
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
The best records in Division A
play to see who goes to the 'ship.

943
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
If we win,
we go to the 'ship.

944
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
If we win.

945
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Everybody sit down.

946
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Take a seat.
Come on, Dre.

947
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
No matter what happens today...

948
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
you guys should be really proud
of the season you've had...

949
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
'cause you played like a team.

950
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And because you played
like a team...

951
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I thought you should look
like a team.

952
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Jefferson Albert Tibbs...

953
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I believe this is yours.

954
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
- Man, that shit is tight!
- Look at that!

955
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Fellas.

956
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
- There's no more shirts in the box.
- Nope.

957
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
What is destiny?
Destiny is you're supposed to win.

958
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Since you're supposed to win,
since I expect you to win...

959
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
don't you celebrate when you strike
out one of these ridiculous--

960
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Hey, dogs, hats!

961
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
What are you doing? Sit down!

962
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Sit down and act like champions.

963
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Come on!

964
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Safe!

965
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
You're out!

966
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Safe!

967
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Bua Was! Bua Was!

968
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
- Blue.
- Time!

969
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
- Good job, Clarence.
- Thanks, Coach.

970
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Good job. Miles. Come on.

971
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Listen, we're tied two-two.
We just need to get one guy out.

972
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Coach, I can't pitch. These guys
are really gonna sweat me.

973
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
They're gonna yell,
and then I can't think.

974
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
This guy is one of the best
hitters in the league.

975
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
You're in charge out here.
Okay? Don't rush.

976
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Hey, you can hear "Big Poppa"
in your head, right?

977
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Yeah.
Just sometimes I lose the rhythm.

978
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Miles, you're great.

979
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I'm not worried.

980
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Rally, rally,
the pitcher's name is Sally!

981
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
If you's a true player
'Cause I see some ladies tonight

982
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
That should be havin'
my baby, baby

983
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I love it when you call me
Big Poppa

984
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Throw your hands in the air
if you's a true player

985
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
that should be havin' my baby

986
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Baby

987
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I love it
when you call me Big Poppa

988
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Throw your hands in the air
if you's a true player

989
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
'Cause I see some ladies tonight

990
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
That should be havin' my baby, baby

991
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Strike one.

992
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I love it when you call me
Big Poppa

993
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Throw your hands in the air
if you's a true player

994
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
'Cause I see some ladies tonight

995
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
- That should be havin' my baby
- Two!

996
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Strike three!

997
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Out!

998
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Good going, Miles.

999
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
All right.
We're tied two-two.

1000
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
- Yeah!
- This is it. Last licks.

1001
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
We pull this out,
we goin' to the 'ship.

1002
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Leading off, we've got Andre, we've
got Ray Ray, we've got Clarence.

1003
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
After that, it's you, Kofi,
and then we've got Jefferson.

1004
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Let's go to the 'ship.

1005
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
- Safe!
- Way to go, Dre!

1006
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Good job.

1007
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Strike one!

1008
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Two!

1009
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Strike three!

1010
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nice job, Ray Ray.

1011
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
- Damn!
- Let's go, Kofi!

1012
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Yeah, yeah.
Almost, Kofi. Almost.

1013
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Two down.
Jefferson, how're you doin'?

1014
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
You're up.

1015
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Time, Blue.

1016
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
We've got Jarius Evans
batting for Jefferson Tibbs.

1017
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
All right.
Wednesday night practice.

1018
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Thanks for the uniform,
Coach.

1019
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
- Thanks, Coach.
- See you guys later.

1020
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Hey, kid. You can't
come in there right now.

1021
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
- How long it's gonna be?
- Don't know.

1022
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Jamal, what's up?

1023
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Why can't we go in
right now?

1024
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
- They're gonna cap somebody inside.
- What're we gonna do?

1025
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Come on.

1026
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
- Shit! Come on.
- Move!

1027
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Come on, man!

1028
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
- Quiet. They'll pass by.
- Come here!

1029
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
What's up?

1030
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Shit!

1031
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
- Get outta here! Come on!
- It's all right. We're okay.

1032
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
G, we're okay.

1033
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
G, come on, get up.

1034
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
It's okay. We'll just wait
for somebody to come.

1035
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It'll be okay.

1036
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
What?

1037
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Oh, Jesus.

1038
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I must

1039
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Tell Jesus

1040
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Jesus

1041
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Can help

1042
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Me

1043
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Jesus

1044
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Alone

1045
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
We've heard testimony from those
very close to our community.

1046
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Praise Jesus.

1047
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I want to give a few more people the
opportunity to say something on--

1048
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
on Jarius's behalf.

1049
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Please, Mr. O'Neill.
Come on up.

1050
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Good morning.

1051
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Jarius was a player on the Kekambas
baseball team that I coach.

1052
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Honestly, he--

1053
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
he was too young to play.

1054
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
But he wanted to be a part
of the team so badly that...

1055
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I couldn't say no.

1056
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
G- Baby. You're up.

1057
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
He had a great smile too.

1058
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I know I'm not telling you
anything you don't know.

1059
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I've got Jarius Evans
batting for Jefferson Tibbs.

1060
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
He was a really tough guy.

1061
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Just a boy, really,
who...

1062
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
wanted to be
around his older brother.

1063
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Hang on, Coach. I don't have Jarius
Evans on this roster anywhere.

1064
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Oh, you know what?
There he is. He's okay.

1065
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
The other day...

1066
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
we played a really important game
against a good team.

1067
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,000
And, two outs
in the last inning...

1068
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I had no choice
but to let Jarius bat.

1069
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
You can swing if you want,
but you don't have to.

1070
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Okay? If you go down looking,
none of us care.

1071
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
But if you want to swing,
swing.

1072
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Get back in there.
Do what you feel.

1073
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
He was fearless
as he stepped to the plate.

1074
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I was terrified for him.

1075
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
With two strikes
and our hopes dwindling...

1076
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
he hit a shot
down the first baseline...

1077
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
and won the game.

1078
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
And watching him...

1079
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
raise his arms in triumph...

1080
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
as he ran to first base...

1081
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I swear...

1082
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I was lifted in that moment
to a better place.

1083
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I swear he--

1084
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000
he lifted the world
in that moment.

1085
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
He made me...

1086
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
a better person...

1087
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,000
even if just
for that moment.

1088
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I am...

1089
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
forever grateful to Jarius
for that.

1090
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
That was nice...

1091
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
what you said.

1092
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
His mother was very moved.

1093
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Thank you.

1094
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Wait.

1095
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
There's some people who want to talk
to you about the baseball team.

1096
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
The team is done.

1097
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
That's what they want
to talk to you about.

1098
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
They're in the auditorium.

1099
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
We know the league wants to cancel
the championship game.

1100
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Mom said it was all up to us
'cause of G-Baby.

1101
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Yeah. It's over.
You guys don't have to play.

1102
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
You guys had a great year.

1103
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000
You can keep the uniforms.

1104
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Wait. You're quitting again?

1105
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
What do you mean?

1106
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,000
We wanna play, bitch.

1107
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
- You guys wanna play?
- Hell, yeah!

1108
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,000
For G-Baby.

1109
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I'll see you tomorrow
at 11:00.

1110
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I came to make sure
you guys win.

1111
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I even made a bet
with your friend, Ticky.

1112
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Knowing Ticky bet against us
improves our chances.

1113
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Did you really fill out an
application to work at the school?

1114
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Good luck today.

1115
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Thank you.

1116
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
- Andre, Ray Ray.
- What's up, Coach?

1117
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Why don't you bring
everybody in?

1118
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
- Hey, y'all, bring it in!
- Let's go!

1119
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I want you guys to take a good look
at yourselves today and feel proud.

1120
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
We made it here.
We're here.

1121
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
What I've learned from you
is that...

1122
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
really, one of the most
important things in life...

1123
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
is showing up.

1124
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I'm blown away
by your ability to show up...

1125
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
through everything
that's gone on.

1126
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
The league never wanted you
to play this game...

1127
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
but you showed up.

1128
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
But we only have
eight players, so--

1129
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
- God.
- We can't play.

1130
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
He was my brother.

1131
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
He loved to watch us play.

1132
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
He's watching us right now.

1133
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
We gonna play today.

1134
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Here you go, Kofi.

1135
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,000
- Okay, this is for G-Baby.
- G-Baby.
