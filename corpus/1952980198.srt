1
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,217
It's not the time
to start playing it safe.

2
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,383
Son, you have to drop.

3
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,351
That's playing to lose.

4
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,653
You got to listen to me.

5
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:36,388
I've been listening
to you my whole life.

6
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,389
You've got to put
some pressure on.

7
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,166
How can a game

8
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,270
have such an effect
on man's soul?

9
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,272
The way I see it,

10
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,823
how can it not?

11
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:59,326
You don't choose the game.
It chooses you.

12
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:00,795
And when it does,

13
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:04,465
life and golf
become forever connected.

14
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:06,334
That's how it was
for a young man

15
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,820
named Luke Chisolm.

16
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,511
You've got to be kidding me.

17
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,944
Once you make one mistake
out of the water there,

18
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,146
you just continue
to make the same mistake.

19
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,280
Are you hurt, son?

20
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,902
I'll get over it.

21
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:06,821
Yeah.

22
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:10,958
You the guy I saw

23
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:13,128
putting the flagstick
in the field?

24
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:17,314
Yeah, and you the guy
that crashed through my fence?

25
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:22,219
Here. Let me help you.

26
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:24,939
Johnny Crawford's
the name.

27
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:26,858
Yeah.
Luke Chisolm.

28
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,359
Yeah, let me see that.

29
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:32,630
Yeah, look, put
a little pressure on there.

30
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:34,532
It'll stop the bleeding.

31
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:35,016
All right.

32
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,235
Yeah.
Thank you.

33
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,320
I need to get you
to my truck

34
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:41,956
to get you some
medical attention, all right?

35
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:45,359
So let's get
these clubs up here.

36
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:47,161
You feel all right?
You're not dizzy?

37
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,130
No, I'll be all right.

38
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:53,001
You're
a hell of a driver.

39
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:58,306
373 people?

40
00:05:58,374 --> 00:05:59,790
375.

41
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:01,593
Megan Monroe
had twins last week.

42
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,264
Yeah. Haven't taken
the sign down yet.

43
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:10,101
The evening service
is just letting out.

44
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:11,785
Hey, how you doing?

45
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:14,655
I went this morning,

46
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:16,624
in case
you was wondering.

47
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,183
Order up.

48
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,718
Let me guess.
Same as usual.

49
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,953
You got it.

50
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,289
So are you
all done there, darling?

51
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:34,492
How y'all doing here?
Need more coffee?

52
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,895
Sure.

53
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:39,480
Oh, Sarah, I could use
some more coffee.

54
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:42,066
Excuse me.

55
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:44,319
How you boys
doing here?

56
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,637
You gonna save
a dance for me tonight?

57
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:49,690
I'll think about it.

58
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,011
She's just playing
hard to get.

59
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,030
Of course she is.

60
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,654
Mama, it's Uncle Johnny.

61
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,006
Hi, everybody.

62
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:06,608
This here's Luke.

63
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:08,843
He's had
a small accident,

64
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,429
do we have
that aid kit back there?

65
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,247
I'll get it.

66
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:16,768
Johnny, what in the world
happened to this poor boy?

67
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,421
Don't worry.
He's gonna live.

68
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,756
Mercy. It looks like
you've been hit by a truck.

69
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:24,508
More like a cow.

70
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:25,893
You hit a cow?

71
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,547
No, I missed the cow,

72
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,415
but I did manage
to run through the fence.

73
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,952
Do you need a doctor?

74
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,272
No, ma'am.

75
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:38,739
I need a mechanic.

76
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:41,059
Here you go.

77
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,177
Sure.
Thank you.

78
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,929
We need some strong hands

79
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,148
to get the car
over to Brody's shop.

80
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,083
Jake, be a dear
and help Johnny.

81
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:50,568
What about
my burger?

82
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,203
The poor man's car
just got wrecked,

83
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,389
and you're worrying
about a burger?

84
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:56,057
Where are your manners?

85
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,608
Come on, Jake.
Let's go. Let's go.

86
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:58,692
Jake, come on.

87
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,628
Have fun.

88
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:02,213
Come on, smiley.
You, too.

89
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,599
Work some of that off.

90
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,101
Come on. Come on.

91
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,137
Let's go.

92
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,105
Hmm?
Sarah?

93
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,640
Drive Luke
to the inn.

94
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,376
I'd be much obliged.
Thank you.

95
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:16,794
Sure.

96
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,749
There you go.

97
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:24,752
Just let me know
whenever you're ready.

98
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:30,675
Mama, we'll be right back.

99
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:31,842
Thank you, ma'am.

100
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,878
Drive careful.

101
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,396
¶ Are you right? ¶

102
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:40,000
¶ will this end in tears? ¶

103
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:41,101
where you from?

104
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,503
Waco.

105
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,856
But I've been on the road
these past couple of years.

106
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,824
Yeah? Me, too.

107
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,125
Really?

108
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:49,126
Mm-hmm.

109
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:50,978
What for, school?

110
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:54,832
I'm training to be
a horse whisperer.

111
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,284
I always thought
horse whispering

112
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:57,969
was only in the movies.

113
00:08:58,036 --> 00:08:59,804
But it's for real, huh?

114
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,173
Yep.

115
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,491
Well, good luck with that.

116
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,277
Thank you.

117
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,296
So where you taking me,
anyway?

118
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:09,997
Oh, we're just going
to the River Inn.

119
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:11,899
That's Uncle Johnny's
place.

120
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,118
Are you two related?

121
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,304
No, he's just
a close family friend,

122
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,990
but I've always known
him as Uncle Johnny.

123
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,692
Here we are.

124
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,779
Well, thanks for the ride.

125
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:29,300
Sure. You have to get
that from the outside.

126
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:44,432
¶ Feeling it all
as the wind blows ¶

127
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:52,173
¶ feeling it all
as the time goes ¶

128
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:58,813
¶ do you feel my eyes
right there on you? ¶

129
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:04,635
hello?

130
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:10,157
Don't you even think

131
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,643
about coming in here
with those.

132
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,914
You must be the one
who ran off the road.

133
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:20,818
What'd you do, fall
asleep at the wheel?

134
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,103
Well, come on.

135
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,220
I don't have all day
to check you in.

136
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,323
Let's go.

137
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,343
And close that door
behind you.

138
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,331
You're not bad looking.

139
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,167
Blind as a bat, maybe.

140
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:37,468
You married?

141
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,770
The neighbor girl's
looking for a husband.

142
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,638
No, ma'am.
I'm not married.

143
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,040
Okay, now
don't lose this key.

144
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:43,407
It opens
the front door, too,

145
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:46,260
so you don't bother me
when you drag in late.

146
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:47,794
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:50,547
There's extra towels
in the cupboard there,

148
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,384
but it's okay to use
the same one twice.

149
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:55,052
Breakfast is at 8:00.

150
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,587
Don't be late.

151
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:22,530
Hi, there.
Thanks for teeing it up

152
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:24,115
with us here
on golf central.

153
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,649
I'm Todd Lewis,
sitting beside Frank Nobilo,

154
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:28,319
and, Frank, we begin with
that unbelievable story

155
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,988
happening at the Callaway
San Antonio open.

156
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,290
Well, that's right,
Todd.

157
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:33,490
Luke Chisolm is a name

158
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,491
that we've all had
on our radar screens

159
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,659
ever since he won

160
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,028
the Texas state
amateur championship.

161
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:39,297
Folks, if you have not seen
this highlight before,

162
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:40,765
sit back and enjoy.

163
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:42,666
It's something
you will not forget.

164
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,635
The winner of this tournament
earns an exemption

165
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,738
into the Valero Texas open
just a few weeks from now.

166
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,223
Luke Chisolm
had a one shot lead

167
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,208
on the final hole
over Joe Buckner,

168
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:52,760
father Martin on the bag,

169
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,228
and look who shows up
on the tee:

170
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,996
The number one player
on the planet

171
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:58,549
and the tournament's
lead sponsor, TKO.

172
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,117
What
an intimidating presence.

173
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:03,403
Well, that's enough to
rattle anybody's cage,

174
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,839
and in this situation,
Luke Chisolm,

175
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:08,208
he just blocks
his tee shot way right.

176
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:10,560
His dad Martin
wanted him...

177
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,129
3- iron.

178
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:14,248
Whoa.

179
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:16,567
It's not the time
to start playing it safe.

180
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,768
Yeah, but if I make par,

181
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,337
he's gotta make birdie
to tie me.

182
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:22,790
You're playing not to lose
instead of playing to win.

183
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,208
Here.

184
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,111
Remember who won
the masters last year?

185
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,313
That guy over there.

186
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,464
Yeah, that guy
over there.

187
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,149
Tko got his fourth
green jacket.

188
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:33,818
Remember who come in second?

189
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,272
Nobody remembers
the runner-up, Luke.

190
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,473
You can get
on the green in two

191
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,625
if you hit it
with the big stick.

192
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:20,564
That one hurt.

193
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:21,932
You wanna hit a few?

194
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,868
Your hand up to it?

195
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,077
Right into trouble.

196
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:35,630
Thread the needle
with a 3-iron.

197
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:37,598
You bump and run it
up on the green.

198
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,383
I think I should just
punch out right here.

199
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,734
You got to put
some pressure on.

200
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,070
Hit the 3.

201
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:47,507
Hit the 3, huh?

202
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:50,628
Hey, mama, there's
an easter egg hunt

203
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:51,979
at the church tomorrow.

204
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:53,981
Sounds like fun.

205
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:55,766
Can we go, dad?

206
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,168
You got some practicing
to do tomorrow.

207
00:13:58,236 --> 00:13:59,569
Martin,
it's easter Sunday.

208
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:01,839
Sundays are reserved
for golf.

209
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,492
Son, you have to drop.

210
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,510
That's playing to lose.

211
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:07,778
You gotta listen to me.

212
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:09,379
I've been listening
to you my whole life

213
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:10,981
and this is where
it's got me.

214
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:16,003
All right. Where
you gonna put it?

215
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:19,540
I hope he brought
a snorkel.

216
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,841
All right.
Let's see what you got.

217
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:23,310
You gotta pull yourself
together here, son.

218
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,311
Am I embarrassing you?

219
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:26,697
You hooked it.

220
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,949
You gotta watch
your right hand.

221
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,217
There you go.

222
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,735
Let it release.

223
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,839
Come on, now.
Let's get started here.

224
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:41,529
Don't flip it.
Come on, now.

225
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:43,981
Come on.
One more good one.

226
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,466
In the hole!

227
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:47,501
Oh!
Oh!

228
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:48,802
Give me another one.

229
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:59,346
You're playing not to lose
instead of playing to win.

230
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:03,100
Nobody remembers
the runner-up, Luke.

231
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,817
God!

232
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:05,703
You gotta put
some pressure on him.

233
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,221
Hit the 3.

234
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:17,815
He snaps his putter,
flings the shaft,

235
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,116
and then
the sad shot here,

236
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,502
his father Martin,
walking away from son

237
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,671
on the final hole.
Oh, my goodness.

238
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:28,108
He ends up shooting
an 80 on the day.

239
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:30,361
We're going to look
at the one that started

240
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,328
what I believe
was the meltdown

241
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:32,746
when he hit it
into the hazard

242
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:34,348
and going forth
from there, Frank.

243
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,616
What was going
through his mind?

244
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,733
Well, I think
he was still smarting,

245
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,402
tom, with the decision
he made off the tee,

246
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,720
whether to hit driver
or 3-wood.

247
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:41,571
That's obviously still
in the back of his mind.

248
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,407
And once you've made
one mistake out of-

249
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,176
I had a feeling
there was more going on

250
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,477
than meets the eye.

251
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:49,446
Wow.
He chilled good.

252
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:51,415
What could I have done
differently instead.

253
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:53,633
Just hitting never
gets you out of trouble.

254
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,119
The problem is-

255
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:58,321
what do I got to do to
get some food around here,

256
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,391
kill a cow myself?

257
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,642
So really,
this is farcical.

258
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:02,876
When you've got
no chance-

259
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,191
wow.

260
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,260
That's no greenskeeper.

261
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:51,058
"Pga of America
half century club. "

262
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,409
Hey, Luke,
I was hoping you'd be here.

263
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:10,711
You can tote these.

264
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,798
Well, close your mouth,
sugar. Let's go.

265
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,017
Well, where we going?

266
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:30,380
Hey, you're looking
a whole lot better.

267
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:31,832
I'm feeling better.

268
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
You're in good hands
with mabel.

269
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,301
I'll tell you what.

270
00:17:34,368 --> 00:17:36,553
I'll feed you right,
but it's my brother Johnny

271
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:37,888
that you're gonna get
the most from

272
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:39,423
if you're paying attention.

273
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,958
Now where is
my dance partner?

274
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,244
Sarah?

275
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:45,296
Sarah?

276
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,435
Maybe you could just
introduce Luke around.

277
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,570
Oh, sure.

278
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,254
Hey, you feeling
any better?

279
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:56,690
Oh, yeah. It's amazing
what a shower

280
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:59,176
and some clean clothes
will do.

281
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:08,452
You good with this,
Duane?

282
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,387
Yeah, go on.

283
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:15,976
Am I ever gonna get to
see you whisper to a horse?

284
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:20,130
I don't do that just
in front of anybody, you know.

285
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:21,916
What about dancing?

286
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:25,169
You do that
in front of anyone?

287
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,088
Hey, lookee here.
It's tour boy.

288
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:30,541
Jake rustin,
this is Luke Chisolm.

289
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:31,926
Yeah, we had
the pleasure

290
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:33,594
earlier today
at the diner.

291
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:34,911
Yeah, that was
right before

292
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,813
I helped drag your car
out of a cow Patty.

293
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,983
Wasn't too happy
about it at the time.

294
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,986
Then me and Sarah
saw you on tv, remember?

295
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,355
You're a regular celebrity.

296
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:46,523
Not every day I get to
help out a record holder.

297
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,591
Hey, Jake, be quiet.

298
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,745
Well, I had
quite the meltdown.

299
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,982
Oh, yeah. I especially
liked that mud bath.

300
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:57,668
The golf channel,
they don't miss a thing.

301
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,885
Jake.

302
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:00,420
It's okay.

303
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:01,922
Just let him talk.

304
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,607
I'm sure he could
have done a lot better.

305
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:06,309
You play golf?

306
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:08,212
I can hold my own.

307
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,930
Yeah? On what course?

308
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:12,032
The kind with windmills,
volcanoes?

309
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,784
Come on, guys.

310
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,986
All right,
can we be social?

311
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:17,621
Let's play nice.

312
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,909
I never shot 16
on one hole before.

313
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,428
Yeah, well,
it was a 14.

314
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,263
Sarah,
it was a pleasure.

315
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:30,450
You wanna dance?

316
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:38,475
¶ Leave it all behind ¶

317
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,850
I didn't see
where it went.

318
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,802
You hooked it.

319
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:50,287
You gotta watch
your right hand.

320
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:51,789
Let it release.

321
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,524
Don't flip it.

322
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:56,276
Dad, it's getting dark.

323
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:58,162
Well, I can see just fine.

324
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:00,897
Come on, now. Let's finish
what we started here.

325
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:07,287
One more good one.

326
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,394
Come on, now.

327
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,221
There you are.

328
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,839
Hey.

329
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:33,146
Tough day, eh?

330
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:35,516
Yeah, I've had better.

331
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:39,019
Yeah, well,
I saw you on tv.

332
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:43,474
I got to say
it was painful to watch.

333
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,092
Try living it.

334
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,544
Believe it or not,
I have.

335
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,196
I believe it.

336
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:52,232
I snooped around
in your study.

337
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,620
Yeah? Well, I chased
the tour for a while.

338
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,722
Had my ups and downs.

339
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,008
You want an observation?

340
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,179
You were playing
from back here, see?

341
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:07,347
Tournament golf has to
be played in front of you

342
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:09,916
where the target is.

343
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:12,586
That's a new one.

344
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:13,837
You have the mechanics.

345
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,005
You just don't know
what it means

346
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:19,359
to play the game
in front of the ball.

347
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:21,244
Well, I'm debating

348
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:23,647
on picking up a club
ever again.

349
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:27,851
Well, I have
a proposition for you.

350
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:31,488
Spend seven days
with me in utopia,

351
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,490
you'll find your game.

352
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,664
Seven days?
I don't know.

353
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:42,682
Well, it'll
take you that long

354
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,618
to get your car fixed,
you know?

355
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:48,338
So think about it,
all right?

356
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:53,376
I'll be at the driving range
9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.

357
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:54,812
Sarah.

358
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:56,413
Hey, Johnny.

359
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,432
I thought you could
use some company.

360
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,235
Gonna be
fireworks soon.

361
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:03,820
All right.

362
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:08,341
I also wanted to
apologize for Jake.

363
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,177
His dad
basically disowned him

364
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,445
after he chose the rodeo
over the family business.

365
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:15,649
He's got a warm heart,
that's for sure.

366
00:22:15,716 --> 00:22:17,417
I see.

367
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:19,787
You two together?

368
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:23,290
No. Everyone
expects us to be, but...

369
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:26,493
I don't know,
especially Jake.

370
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,214
So what about you?

371
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:32,632
Me.

372
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:38,271
Mom and I lost my dad
to cancer two years ago,

373
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,008
so I suppose
I'm just...

374
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:45,645
Taking each day
as they come.

375
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:50,367
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:57,907
"I suppose" means God
works in mysterious ways.

377
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:04,197
Johnny says he can
help me with my game.

378
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:07,467
Think I should
take him up on his offer?

379
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,142
Well, I think...

380
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,180
I think some time here
might do you good.

381
00:23:50,477 --> 00:23:54,514
"Donations appreciated.
God bless. "

382
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:56,300
Nice.

383
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,639
You got game, son.

384
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,894
You could have told me
you owned this place.

385
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,979
Well, you could
have told me

386
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:27,613
what really happened
to your putter.

387
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,903
What made you want to build
a golf course out here?

388
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,188
Well, originally
I moved here

389
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:36,323
to get away
from the game,

390
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:38,775
but easier said
than done, I guess.

391
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:41,010
So you quit the tour?

392
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:46,316
Well, the game just wasn't a
good fit for me anymore. Yeah.

393
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,235
Okay, listen,
let's get started.

394
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:49,870
I want to see you
hit some, all right?

395
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:51,722
I want to see you swing.

396
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,476
These are a little better.

397
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:57,644
Yep.

398
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,094
Why do you grip
the club that way?

399
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:16,546
Well, I don't know.

400
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:18,131
Just feels good.

401
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,616
Well, that's
the wrong answer.

402
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,753
Now, let start from
scratch, all right?

403
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,440
I need to know why you
do the things you do.

404
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:30,843
Like the foundation
for your swing,

405
00:25:30,911 --> 00:25:33,380
from the grip
to the follow through.

406
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:37,334
Now go think about it
and write it down.

407
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:40,954
The first step
in finding a good game

408
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:43,139
is to find
some conviction.

409
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,992
You got that?

410
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,844
Think about it.

411
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:53,683
How'd I end up here?

412
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:07,713
Unbelievable.

413
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:10,794
The toughest challenge
you'll face

414
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:11,728
isn't the golf course

415
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,196
or even your
competitor's score.

416
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,265
It's that casual comment

417
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,016
offered by someone,
anyone,

418
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:19,669
about how you should
be doing it.

419
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,087
If you don't have
conviction

420
00:27:21,155 --> 00:27:22,589
about where
your foundation is,

421
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:25,291
that off-handed comment will
take you out of your game

422
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,212
and erode
your confidence.

423
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,947
Now, you got that?

424
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,699
Yes, sir.

425
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:38,404
That's Ben hogan.

426
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:39,322
Yeah.

427
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,207
The one and only.

428
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,289
Place the club
in my left hand

429
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:58,791
with my thumb
down the shaft.

430
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:01,995
Place my right hand
over my left thumb

431
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:03,646
and my lifeline.

432
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,166
That helps me
cock my wrist

433
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,168
in my backswing.

434
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:10,920
That's good.

435
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:13,756
I do believe.

436
00:28:16,877 --> 00:28:19,228
You're not from here,
are you?

437
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:22,315
Well, not exactly.

438
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:24,734
I've lived
in a lot of places.

439
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:28,020
Been around here and there
with the military.

440
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:31,457
No, I'm not from here.

441
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:34,277
How'd you end up
in utopia?

442
00:28:37,431 --> 00:28:40,249
You ask a lot of questions,
young fella.

443
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:43,186
You really do.

444
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,405
I burned all my Bridges.

445
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:49,459
There was no place to turn
but here.

446
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,681
A tour player like you,

447
00:28:54,748 --> 00:28:58,084
the players
you played with,

448
00:28:58,151 --> 00:29:00,103
why here?

449
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,521
I'll tell you.

450
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:03,773
Paul Hawkins
was a student of mine

451
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:05,408
way back when,
that's Sarah's dad.

452
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:08,328
He was a good man-
a great man.

453
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:12,832
He let me stay with them
while I...

454
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,751
Got my act together.

455
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,823
Been here ever since.

456
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,381
Did you get
in some kind of trouble?

457
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:31,651
It's getting late.

458
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,571
I'm gonna see you tomorrow
down by the river.

459
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,407
Day break, all right?

460
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,025
What does the river
have to do with golf?

461
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:42,111
You'll see.

462
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:45,848
You will see.

463
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:04,884
Rhythm, balance, patience.

464
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:07,370
That's what you need
to stay in your game.

465
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:09,505
The same with fly fishing.

466
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:11,858
It takes a calm mindset

467
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:16,713
a focus on the feel,
rather than the outcome.

468
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,350
It takes emotional control.

469
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:47,894
Hey?

470
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,813
All right.

471
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,520
Tell me.

472
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:59,205
What was his downfall?

473
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:02,158
He took the bait.

474
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:03,342
Yeah, but why?

475
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,911
What made him
fall into that trap?

476
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,697
I'm not sure.

477
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,115
'Cause he was hungry?

478
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,883
No, he was mad.

479
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:13,703
I teased him
with a shadow casting,

480
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,806
never quite letting
the fly touch the water,

481
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:19,192
so I was able
to take that fish

482
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:20,910
out of his game today.

483
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:25,481
Now, you ready
to give it a try?

484
00:31:45,302 --> 00:31:46,653
All right, remember.

485
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,305
To stay in balance
in the skiff

486
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:51,924
or during your golf swing,

487
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:55,145
you have to control
your emotions.

488
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:56,145
Okay?

489
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:58,063
All right.

490
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:06,322
Breathe, Luke.

491
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:10,643
Rhythm, balance,
and patience.

492
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:31,180
Johnny, I got one.

493
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:36,619
Now catch it.
Keep the tip up.

494
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:39,572
Keep the tip up.
Take it as it comes.

495
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,956
All right?

496
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,733
Easy. Easy.

497
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:54,870
Oh!

498
00:32:57,474 --> 00:32:59,092
Never fails.

499
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:19,328
Got him, Johnny.

500
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:21,798
Hey, good job, son.

501
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:22,999
Whoo!

502
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,368
How comes you always seem
to do things the hard way?

503
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:29,956
Good. Hey!

504
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:42,135
Come here. I want
to show you something.

505
00:33:42,202 --> 00:33:44,286
30 years ago, this man
named Jack nicklaus

506
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:45,688
took me out of my game.

507
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:46,840
You know how?

508
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:48,691
By staying in his game.

509
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,778
The calmer he was,
the madder I got.

510
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:53,513
And I tried shots

511
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,299
I wouldn't
ordinarily take.

512
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,719
Now, this look familiar?

513
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,842
A little hiccup on 18.

514
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:12,431
Well, at least you got beat
by the golden bear.

515
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:14,517
Yeah, and so
would you have.

516
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,035
Ha ha ha.

517
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:20,306
Now tomorrow we actually
meet at the course.

518
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:22,858
Fifth fairway.

519
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,176
8 A.M.

520
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,097
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:47,099
It's not good
to be late in life, son.

522
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:50,603
Time is too precious
to waste.

523
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,971
I said I was sorry.

524
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:54,223
If this was a tournament,
you'd be disqualified.

525
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:55,724
Now, you wanna play
like a professional,

526
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:58,294
you have to act like one,
all right?

527
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:00,446
Now take a seat.

528
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,832
Take a seat.

529
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,088
Today...

530
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,141
We're gonna paint.

531
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:14,610
All right?

532
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:16,429
Paint?

533
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:18,197
All right.

534
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:21,967
All golf shots start
with a blank canvas.

535
00:35:22,035 --> 00:35:26,122
We paint the shot
with our eyes first

536
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,409
so our bodies can
reproduce it accurately.

537
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:35,064
Now...

538
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:39,268
What kind of shot could
you make from here?

539
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:49,311
Well, I think-

540
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:50,914
no, no, don't think.

541
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:52,949
See.

542
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,227
Okay.

543
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:06,996
I see a low punch
eight iron.

544
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:09,148
Playing the ball
back in my stance

545
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:11,583
with a slightly hooded
clubface.

546
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:14,337
I can see the ball
flying about 30 yards

547
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,688
with some hook-spin,

548
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,990
landing on the upslope
of that hill,

549
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:21,711
bouncing up
and going in the cup.

550
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,930
Okay.

551
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:27,132
Now go paint it.

552
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,026
Morning.

553
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:38,443
Morning.

554
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:43,098
Just paying a visit
to Paul.

555
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,099
Yeah.

556
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,368
Mama.

557
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,638
Hey, mama,
you gonna be all right?

558
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:49,672
Just give me a minute?

559
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,307
Right, honey.
You go have fun.

560
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,441
Take care.

561
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:54,526
Can't believe
it's been two years.

562
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:56,111
Yeah.

563
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:58,715
I miss Paul
most every day.

564
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:03,235
Yeah. Whoa-ho-ho.

565
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,756
Hi.

566
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,957
Hey.

567
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:09,759
You look nice.

568
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,544
Well, thank you.

569
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:13,262
So your Uncle Johnny,

570
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,681
he's a real
piece of work today.

571
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:18,334
Yeah, well, it's actually

572
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:21,337
kind of a rough day
for all of us.

573
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:24,907
It's the second anniversary
of dad's passing.

574
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:29,528
It's okay.

575
00:37:29,596 --> 00:37:32,732
Is there anything
I can do?

576
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:35,868
Well, I was gonna ask you...

577
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:37,870
My father and I
used to go up to obra maestra

578
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:39,205
on his birthday.

579
00:37:39,272 --> 00:37:41,874
I was thinking of going
out there later today,

580
00:37:41,942 --> 00:37:44,243
and I could
really use the company.

581
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:48,097
It'd be an honor.

582
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:51,950
Okay.

583
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:54,937
I see Uncle Johnny's
got you painting already.

584
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:58,140
Yeah, he does.
I wasn't expecting that.

585
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:58,217
Looks like we're gonna
have to add another shelf.

586
00:38:58,285 --> 00:39:01,971
Maybe one day there'll be
tour trophies on that shelf.

587
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:04,807
Ain't no maybes
in this world, Luke.

588
00:39:04,874 --> 00:39:08,394
You understand?

589
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:09,862
Yes, dad.

590
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,463
Good.

591
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:15,067
Now rephrase what
you just said to me.

592
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:20,322
One day there will be
tour trophies on this shelf.

593
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:24,993
I'm counting on it, son.

594
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:27,013
I'm proud of you.

595
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,801
You ready, cowboy?

596
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,878
<i>Obra maestra means
masterpiece in Spanish.</i>

597
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:52,965
I can see why.

598
00:40:53,032 --> 00:40:55,451
Sure is beautiful.

599
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,542
I might even go as far
as calling it utopia.

600
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:07,096
Yeah.

601
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,899
I suppose you might.

602
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:12,401
You ever think of living
somewhere else?

603
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:15,687
Everything I need's
right here.

604
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:17,656
I'm free to be myself.

605
00:41:17,723 --> 00:41:20,692
Free to do the things
I was born to do.

606
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:24,480
What is that?

607
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,134
Bring freedom to horses.

608
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:36,491
And the occasional stranger.

609
00:41:47,654 --> 00:41:49,721
Come on.

610
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:54,726
Hyah! Move!

611
00:41:54,794 --> 00:41:57,229
Jake.

612
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:00,332
Jake, you're coming
too close.

613
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,867
You're gonna scare
the horses.

614
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:03,752
Come on!

615
00:42:05,355 --> 00:42:06,439
Whoa.

616
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:08,607
What are you doing
out here with him?

617
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:09,759
I'm taking a ride.

618
00:42:09,826 --> 00:42:11,393
I didn't know
I needed your permission.

619
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:15,598
So tour boy, choke
on anything lately?

620
00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:20,219
Yeah, well, at least
I got a sport to choke on.

621
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,387
What do y'all play
out here, mutton busting?

622
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:24,507
You know what
us tour boys say

623
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,375
about Hicks
and sheep, don't you?

624
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,044
That's real funny.

625
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:29,995
I don't know who you
think you're talking to.

626
00:42:30,063 --> 00:42:31,747
Boys. Hey, quit it!

627
00:42:31,814 --> 00:42:32,931
Now, you're acting like
a couple of children.

628
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:34,099
Jake! Chuck, get him off!

629
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,718
You heard the lady.

630
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,686
Get off me!

631
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,723
How about you two hotheads

632
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:44,910
settle this over a friendly
little game of cowboy poker

633
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:46,595
after the rodeo tonight?

634
00:43:01,194 --> 00:43:02,410
Ladies and gentlemen,

635
00:43:02,478 --> 00:43:03,879
this is the final event
of the evening.

636
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:07,900
Hold on to your seats.
It's time for cowboy poker.

637
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:09,217
Introducing our players:

638
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,686
Duane Clint pickens

639
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,289
and Chuck baer,
the usual suspects.

640
00:43:14,357 --> 00:43:18,293
Four-time utopia
rodeo champion Jake rustin.

641
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:20,912
And our final player,
he's a first timer,

642
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,098
so let's give
a warm utopia welcome

643
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:26,485
for professional golfer
Luke Chisolm.

644
00:43:26,552 --> 00:43:28,070
All right, boys,
deal the cards

645
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,289
and let's get
this party started.

646
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:34,193
Time to put up or shut up.

647
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,695
All right.
What are we playing?

648
00:43:36,763 --> 00:43:37,946
Texas hold 'em.

649
00:43:38,014 --> 00:43:39,715
Yeah, but there's a catch.

650
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,368
You got to hold on
to your chair.

651
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:43,919
Why?

652
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:45,237
You'll see.

653
00:43:45,304 --> 00:43:46,889
The last man
still in their seat

654
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,040
wins 200 bucks!

655
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:02,521
Watch out.
He's got his sights set

656
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:03,906
on the usual suspects.

657
00:44:05,858 --> 00:44:07,426
Chuck's all in.

658
00:44:12,649 --> 00:44:14,817
Who's cannonball
gonna go for next?

659
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,635
Watch out, slim!

660
00:44:16,703 --> 00:44:18,270
Get your butt
in the chair.

661
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:26,311
It's you and me.

662
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:28,931
See what you got.

663
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,515
Boys.

664
00:44:33,953 --> 00:44:36,388
Whoa!

665
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:44,696
And the winner
is the rookie.

666
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:54,072
Dang it!

667
00:45:09,939 --> 00:45:11,956
Proud of you, son.

668
00:45:16,045 --> 00:45:18,513
Hey, Luke, Luke,
what's next for you?

669
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:19,782
Is it time
to go pro?

670
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:24,169
Well, this hasn't even
sunk in yet,

671
00:45:24,237 --> 00:45:28,374
so I'm just gonna try to
enjoy this feeling and, uh-

672
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:30,041
he's a humble kid.

673
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:32,478
What he means to say
is yes.

674
00:45:32,545 --> 00:45:33,612
He will be turning pro.

675
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,113
Of course
he'll be turning pro,

676
00:45:35,181 --> 00:45:36,682
and we'll begin to look

677
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,684
for a sponsor's
exemption immediately.

678
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:39,885
All right!

679
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,989
Good going, Luke.
Yeah!

680
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:58,603
I'm sorry.

681
00:45:58,671 --> 00:46:01,023
Yeah, I know.
Laugh it up.

682
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,207
Hey, speaking of manure,

683
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:04,093
where'd the rhinestone
cowboy go?

684
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,460
I was ready to gloat.

685
00:46:05,528 --> 00:46:08,313
Well, Jake
went off in a huff.

686
00:46:08,381 --> 00:46:10,465
He's doesn't like
to lose.

687
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:12,917
Well, that makes
two of us.

688
00:46:12,952 --> 00:46:16,254
Well, there's more to life
than winning, right?

689
00:46:16,322 --> 00:46:17,789
Like what?

690
00:46:19,408 --> 00:46:21,877
Family. Friendship.

691
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,145
Faith. Love.

692
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:26,398
Oh, yeah.

693
00:46:26,466 --> 00:46:29,351
I guess those, too.

694
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:35,874
Johnny's got the horses
hitched up.

695
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:37,776
It's time to go.

696
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:40,829
You know, cowboy?

697
00:46:40,897 --> 00:46:44,533
Sometimes I think you
might just be hopeless.

698
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:51,239
Luke.

699
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:53,358
Get in here, smelly.

700
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:56,078
Come on in here.

701
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,663
I hung up
your masterpiece.

702
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,381
You forgot to sign it.

703
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:07,906
What's this?

704
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:09,458
Oh, that?

705
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:11,443
That bottle's
my greatest trophy.

706
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:14,729
No, let me explain.

707
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:18,984
It's the last liquor
I ever drank.

708
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:30,345
Doesn't it tempt you?

709
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:32,497
No, just the opposite.

710
00:47:32,565 --> 00:47:35,500
Makes me remember
all the things I lost

711
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:39,304
because I drank too much.

712
00:47:39,372 --> 00:47:40,572
That's why
I put it there.

713
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:43,926
Is that why
you quit the tour?

714
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:48,463
Well, more or less, yes.

715
00:47:48,598 --> 00:47:51,516
More or less, yeah.

716
00:47:51,584 --> 00:47:54,803
Pretty hard
to drink and drive, eh?

717
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,475
Yeah.

718
00:48:01,944 --> 00:48:03,462
Well, I'm sorry
about this morning,

719
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:04,496
being late and all.

720
00:48:04,564 --> 00:48:06,097
No, no, I'm not.
I am not.

721
00:48:06,165 --> 00:48:07,750
Learn how
to paint your shot,

722
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:08,934
you learn
how to be on time.

723
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:11,036
A professional golfer
does both.

724
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:15,440
Now, sign your masterpiece,
Picasso.

725
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:30,205
Where we headed, anyway?

726
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:32,791
Going to work
on your putting.

727
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:35,043
Well, the golf course
is back that way.

728
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:37,980
Uh-huh. Yeah, it is.

729
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,805
I thought you said we was
going to work on some putting.

730
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:49,307
That's right.
That's right.

731
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:52,544
We are. Come on.

732
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:58,550
I hope you brought some of
your winnings from last night.

733
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,225
Well played, gentlemen.
Well played.

734
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:08,544
Hear, hear.
Keep practicing.

735
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:10,912
Well, look who he
dragged in here with him.

736
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,897
You a little stiff
this morning?

737
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:14,116
Still sore
I beat you last night.

738
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,266
You better watch it.

739
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:16,451
Enough of that, Jake,
knock it off.

740
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:17,269
Hey, Jake,
come on, come on.

741
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,554
Get the washers, all right?

742
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:21,440
Let's get the game
started here. Come on.

743
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:23,192
Same old Jake. Come on.

744
00:49:25,411 --> 00:49:27,579
Okay. Now,
the rules are simple.

745
00:49:27,647 --> 00:49:28,998
The man who's up

746
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:30,849
pitches from behind
the marker of his choice.

747
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:33,001
Yeah, but I don't see what
this has to do with golf.

748
00:49:33,069 --> 00:49:35,003
You just watch.
Just watch.

749
00:49:35,071 --> 00:49:36,738
Just watch. See?

750
00:49:37,823 --> 00:49:40,375
Ooh! You owe me
five bucks, boys.

751
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:42,510
You ready
to give it a try?

752
00:49:42,578 --> 00:49:43,745
Yeah, sure.

753
00:49:43,812 --> 00:49:46,231
Come on. Don't make me
look bad, now.

754
00:49:46,298 --> 00:49:48,867
All right, it's on, boys.

755
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:52,137
There's not a chance
he'll make this.

756
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:54,522
You gonna put your money
where your mouth is?

757
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,692
You're on.

758
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,380
Ho-ho!

759
00:50:02,448 --> 00:50:03,965
Beginner's luck.

760
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:07,118
Here. Let's see you
do that again.

761
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:09,838
All right.
I will.

762
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:14,042
¶ Everybody
needs a woman's love, now ¶

763
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,745
yes!

764
00:50:16,812 --> 00:50:18,663
I like this game.

765
00:50:20,132 --> 00:50:21,616
Crazy, cowboy.

766
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:24,019
Hey, knock it in, man.

767
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,687
Oh!

768
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:27,506
¶ I'm gonna move ¶

769
00:50:27,573 --> 00:50:29,240
¶ I got to work it on out ¶

770
00:50:29,308 --> 00:50:30,725
he's better than you!

771
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:32,727
¶ Early in the mornin' ¶

772
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:35,280
¶ I play it for you
more now ¶

773
00:50:35,347 --> 00:50:39,083
¶ bend it on out ¶

774
00:50:39,151 --> 00:50:40,319
whoo!

775
00:50:40,386 --> 00:50:42,237
Yeah! Yeah!

776
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:47,192
Come on.

777
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,443
Let's go.

778
00:50:49,662 --> 00:50:52,564
We're even.

779
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,116
Come on, slim!

780
00:50:54,183 --> 00:50:56,268
¶ I like it like that ¶
oh, come on!

781
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:01,305
Yeah!

782
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,809
I'm impressed.

783
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:08,596
Make me proud, son.

784
00:51:08,664 --> 00:51:09,298
You make me proud.

785
00:51:09,365 --> 00:51:11,766
Watch his form.

786
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:13,635
Right off the fingers.

787
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,553
I'm the rodeo king!

788
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:16,771
You know what I love
about the cowboy way?

789
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:19,290
Everything! Hey!

790
00:51:20,893 --> 00:51:22,877
Whoo!

791
00:51:22,945 --> 00:51:24,929
Okay, boys.
Let's go. Let's go.

792
00:51:24,997 --> 00:51:26,664
We're going
to the links now.

793
00:51:26,732 --> 00:51:28,249
We're gonna do
some putting. Let's go.

794
00:51:28,317 --> 00:51:29,717
Come on.

795
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,270
Come on.

796
00:51:33,706 --> 00:51:36,541
Pitching washers...

797
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:39,961
Give me an idea
for a putting technique.

798
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:41,246
You're kidding, right?

799
00:51:41,314 --> 00:51:42,114
No, no, sir.

800
00:51:42,181 --> 00:51:43,665
I have a respect
for tradition,

801
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:46,751
but I have a passion
for the truth, okay?

802
00:51:46,819 --> 00:51:50,238
Now, here. Jake?

803
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:51,406
Yes, sir.

804
00:51:51,473 --> 00:51:53,408
Use the face-on
putter.

805
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:55,660
You use
the traditional one.

806
00:51:55,728 --> 00:51:58,029
5 to 1 on Jake.

807
00:51:58,097 --> 00:52:00,549
Quiet in the peanut
gallery here.

808
00:52:00,616 --> 00:52:03,051
Come on, Jake.
Help me out.

809
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:07,455
Get in the hole.

810
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:09,124
Get in the hole!

811
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,758
Yes!

812
00:52:12,645 --> 00:52:15,280
It's gonna be
a good day for me.

813
00:52:16,332 --> 00:52:18,316
Good. Good.

814
00:52:18,384 --> 00:52:19,884
You try.

815
00:52:21,287 --> 00:52:23,137
Come on, rookie.
Make me some money.

816
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,595
Oh!
Oh!

817
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:32,197
Ooh.

818
00:52:48,547 --> 00:52:50,481
Miss it. Miss it.
No, no, no.

819
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:51,566
Yes!

820
00:52:52,935 --> 00:52:54,886
I'm impressed.

821
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:56,888
You ready to give
this one a try?

822
00:52:56,956 --> 00:52:58,389
Here you go.

823
00:52:58,457 --> 00:53:00,391
When in utopia, right?

824
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:03,445
Come on. Lets go.

825
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,514
More drinks for me
tonight. Let's go.

826
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:06,615
Ain't no way.

827
00:53:06,682 --> 00:53:08,733
Come on, now.

828
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:12,937
This look right?

829
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:17,693
No way. No way.

830
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,061
No-oh, yeah!

831
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:21,813
Let me ask you
something.

832
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:23,398
Would you
or could you

833
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,583
use this
in competition?

834
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:29,504
I'd probably get laughed
off the course,

835
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:31,172
but it definitely works.

836
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,824
Well, you keep it.

837
00:53:33,859 --> 00:53:36,286
'Cause when
the time comes,

838
00:53:36,321 --> 00:53:38,713
you'll know
when to use it.

839
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:39,981
Okay.

840
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:43,067
You have any kids?

841
00:53:43,135 --> 00:53:46,121
No, sir.

842
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:50,908
That's one of
my biggest regrets.

843
00:53:50,976 --> 00:53:53,061
I saw
your wedding photo.

844
00:53:53,128 --> 00:53:55,596
Oh, you snooping around
again, are you?

845
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:56,915
You snooping?

846
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,633
You're a super snooper.

847
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,719
I'm sorry.

848
00:54:00,786 --> 00:54:01,853
You're a real snooper.

849
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:05,574
Well, that's
a cool study room.

850
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:06,791
Pictures
of all those legends.

851
00:54:06,859 --> 00:54:11,012
No. Annie,
my Annie,

852
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,581
couldn't have kids.

853
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:15,783
She used to joke that
she didn't need any

854
00:54:15,851 --> 00:54:17,318
'cause she had me.

855
00:54:19,404 --> 00:54:20,238
Yeah.

856
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:25,643
Well, if you don't
mind me asking,

857
00:54:25,711 --> 00:54:27,195
what happened?

858
00:54:28,814 --> 00:54:31,499
Well, she's gone on.

859
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,919
Couldn't put up with
my drinking anymore.

860
00:54:34,987 --> 00:54:38,272
Can't say I blame her.

861
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:41,860
Sorry to hear that.

862
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:45,447
Yeah, well...

863
00:54:45,514 --> 00:54:50,285
Gone but not forgotten.

864
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,188
As they say...

865
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,940
All part of God's plan.

866
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:58,243
Yeah, I suppose.

867
00:54:59,862 --> 00:55:01,730
Good night.

868
00:55:01,797 --> 00:55:03,532
Night.

869
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:06,384
I'll see you
in the morning.

870
00:55:06,452 --> 00:55:08,070
You bet.

871
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,323
Let me guess.

872
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:13,691
This is where
you drop me off

873
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,010
in the middle
of nowhere.

874
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:16,795
And expect me
to get back home

875
00:55:16,862 --> 00:55:17,846
with the clothes on my back

876
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,230
and two golf tees
in my pocket.

877
00:55:19,298 --> 00:55:21,432
That'd be
way too easy.

878
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:38,650
That's it.
Wow.

879
00:55:38,717 --> 00:55:39,785
Is this yours?

880
00:55:39,852 --> 00:55:41,820
Yes, she is.

881
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:44,839
Um... you're not planning

882
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:47,074
on going up in this
thing though, are you?

883
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:48,242
Well, why not?

884
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,779
I mean, flying's
a lot like golf.

885
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:52,380
Eh?

886
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:56,050
You said fly fishing
was a lot like golf.

887
00:55:56,118 --> 00:55:57,351
Did I say that?

888
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,903
Yeah.

889
00:55:58,971 --> 00:56:00,922
Maybe I did.
You ready?

890
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,390
No way.

891
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:03,240
What?

892
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:05,460
I'm keeping my feet
on the ground today.

893
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,111
Oh, yeah?

894
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:08,863
Whoa. I don't know
about this, Johnny.

895
00:56:09,015 --> 00:56:10,064
Let's turn back.

896
00:56:10,132 --> 00:56:11,983
Your feet control direction
with the rudder.

897
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:14,936
The stick controls
the wind and pitch.

898
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,121
Now, to turn,
you press one foot

899
00:56:17,189 --> 00:56:19,123
and you turn the wheel
in that direction.

900
00:56:19,191 --> 00:56:21,392
And to go up or down,
push or pull.

901
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,393
Got it?

902
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:23,594
Okay.

903
00:56:23,662 --> 00:56:26,915
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

904
00:56:26,982 --> 00:56:28,983
Okay. No hands, see?
Like this.

905
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:30,368
You're doing good.

906
00:56:30,435 --> 00:56:31,953
All right. I'm getting it now.
I'm getting it.

907
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:32,987
I think I'm getting it.

908
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:34,088
It's like riding
a horse.

909
00:56:34,156 --> 00:56:35,473
Keep her steady.

910
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:37,859
Uh-oh. What's...

911
00:56:37,926 --> 00:56:39,410
What? Wait, wait, wait.

912
00:56:39,478 --> 00:56:41,346
What just happened?
What-Johnny?

913
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:42,697
Hold on. Hold on.

914
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:43,898
What happened?

915
00:56:43,966 --> 00:56:45,951
We have an emergency.
We have an emergency.

916
00:56:46,018 --> 00:56:47,118
Put the plane down.

917
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:48,419
Johnny, you take it.
You take it.

918
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:51,473
You take control
of this aircraft, son.

919
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,189
All right?

920
00:56:52,257 --> 00:56:53,441
I don't know what to do.

921
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:54,709
Keep the nose down
and level the wings.

922
00:56:54,776 --> 00:56:55,744
Okay.
All right?

923
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:56,995
All right.

924
00:56:57,063 --> 00:56:59,580
That's good. Good.

925
00:56:59,648 --> 00:57:01,232
How's that?
All right.

926
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,534
We should try to go back,
shouldn't we?

927
00:57:03,602 --> 00:57:04,619
No, we can't get back.

928
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:05,970
We'll have to find
a place around here.

929
00:57:06,238 --> 00:57:06,888
Come on. Come on.

930
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,289
There's a wheat field.

931
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:10,225
All right. Good.
You're doing great, son.

932
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:12,476
Keep your wits
about you, okay?

933
00:57:12,544 --> 00:57:14,712
Level your wings.
You got 500 feet to go.

934
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,130
How about that?

935
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:16,948
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're doing great.

936
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:19,384
Steady. Steady.

937
00:57:19,452 --> 00:57:22,453
Steady. Bring it in.
Bring it in. Steady.

938
00:57:22,521 --> 00:57:24,672
Keep the wings level.
Keep the wings level.

939
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,440
Okay.

940
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:26,858
Leveling my wings.

941
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:28,326
Is this good?
We good?

942
00:57:28,393 --> 00:57:29,560
Great.
You're doing great.

943
00:57:29,628 --> 00:57:31,313
Leveling. Leveling.

944
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,665
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

945
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:37,602
Coming in. Coming in.

946
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,953
Wait.

947
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:41,990
Wait. What
happened here?

948
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,741
Goodness me.

949
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:46,027
The engine turned off.

950
00:57:46,094 --> 00:57:47,245
Did you turn
the engine off?

951
00:57:47,313 --> 00:57:48,913
The engine turned off?

952
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:50,965
Is this your idea
of a sick joke?

953
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:52,901
Why are you laughing?

954
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:58,173
Confidence comes with
being prepared, my son.

955
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:01,409
As in golf or life
hand in hand.

956
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:05,229
I'm about
to throw up over here.

957
00:58:05,297 --> 00:58:06,497
You can't play
in a tournament

958
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:08,866
unless you're ready
for the unexpected

959
00:58:08,934 --> 00:58:10,251
on game day.

960
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,054
It smells delicious.

961
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:14,306
Mabel's trout's
famous around here.

962
00:58:14,373 --> 00:58:16,308
More famous
than her pies?

963
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:18,310
Couldn't be
more famous.

964
00:58:18,377 --> 00:58:19,911
As famous, maybe.

965
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:22,129
But more famous?

966
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:39,664
For food in a world
where many walk in hunger,

967
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:43,217
for faith in a world
where many walk in fear,

968
00:58:43,285 --> 00:58:48,906
for friends in a world
where many walk alone,

969
00:58:48,974 --> 00:58:51,642
we give you thanks,
o lord. Amen.

970
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:54,445
Amen.
Amen.

971
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:02,437
He definitely
puts the game first.

972
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,609
Reminds me of someone
else I used to know.

973
00:59:09,228 --> 00:59:11,162
That he does.

974
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,681
Hopefully he finds his way
quicker than me.

975
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:17,668
Hey, there, stranger.

976
00:59:17,736 --> 00:59:19,253
Hey.

977
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:21,856
So when's the last time
you caught a firefly?

978
00:59:21,924 --> 00:59:23,941
Well, I don't know.

979
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:26,144
Since I was
a little kid.

980
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:29,447
Well, that's too long.

981
00:59:29,515 --> 00:59:31,465
Come on.

982
00:59:34,436 --> 00:59:36,337
She has Paul's gift.

983
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:40,758
She always was
a daddy's girl.

984
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,455
It's okay.

985
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:56,107
Hey, Sarah.

986
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,575
What?

987
00:59:57,642 --> 01:00:00,044
These ones in here
quit making light.

988
01:00:00,112 --> 01:00:02,113
That's 'cause they know
they're trapped.

989
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,299
It makes
their lights go out.

990
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,437
Watch this.

991
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:19,814
Freedom's
a powerful force.

992
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:33,511
Not yet.

993
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,734
I'm sorry.

994
01:00:42,887 --> 01:00:44,455
No, I-

995
01:00:44,523 --> 01:00:46,657
it doesn't mean never.

996
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:22,460
It's gonna...
It's gonna rain.

997
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:24,012
Ready for today's lesson?

998
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,179
I can only imagine

999
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:27,114
what you got in store
for me today.

1000
01:01:27,182 --> 01:01:29,701
Yes, sir.
Today we play golf.

1001
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:33,821
Good. What should I hit,
a driver?

1002
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:35,239
No, no, no, no.

1003
01:01:35,307 --> 01:01:39,060
Today we visit
the history of the game

1004
01:01:39,127 --> 01:01:40,478
and its future.

1005
01:01:40,546 --> 01:01:42,447
You're gonna be playing
with hickory sticks

1006
01:01:42,515 --> 01:01:44,565
and a face-on putter.

1007
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:46,851
Ooh.

1008
01:01:46,918 --> 01:01:48,119
Not bad.

1009
01:01:48,187 --> 01:01:49,721
Perfect.

1010
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:51,689
S.F.T.

1011
01:01:51,756 --> 01:01:52,957
One for you.

1012
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,179
See it. Feel it.

1013
01:01:58,364 --> 01:01:59,330
Trust it.

1014
01:01:59,398 --> 01:02:01,682
Little butter cut
over that left tree.

1015
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:04,001
How far?

1016
01:02:04,069 --> 01:02:05,936
About 310.

1017
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:07,671
210.

1018
01:02:07,706 --> 01:02:09,557
What's
the course record?

1019
01:02:09,624 --> 01:02:12,844
Well, you ever shot a 59?

1020
01:02:12,912 --> 01:02:15,563
You keep playing this way,
you just might.

1021
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:17,899
Weather permitting,
of course.

1022
01:02:26,441 --> 01:02:28,158
Yes, sir.
Boom.

1023
01:02:28,226 --> 01:02:30,311
Not sure we can
get this round in.

1024
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,363
There ain't nothing
stopping me.

1025
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:34,365
I'm seeing it,
feeling it,

1026
01:02:34,433 --> 01:02:36,300
and trusting it.

1027
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:00,074
It's time
to wrap it up, son.

1028
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:02,059
It's not the time
to start playing it safe.

1029
01:03:02,127 --> 01:03:03,410
We got one more hole.

1030
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,230
No, no, no.
59 doesn't matter, Luke.

1031
01:03:06,298 --> 01:03:07,181
It's matters to me.

1032
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:08,365
That's not the lesson.

1033
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:09,283
That was never the lesson.

1034
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:10,835
You spent the whole week

1035
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:13,271
teaching me how to play
the best golf of my life.

1036
01:03:13,339 --> 01:03:15,356
Now I'm playing it.

1037
01:03:21,379 --> 01:03:24,231
All right. Well, you don't have
to prove anything to me, Luke,

1038
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:25,667
because I'm not your father.

1039
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:28,703
You don't know anything
about my dad, so back off.

1040
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,621
No, you can't spend
your life

1041
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:32,473
trying to validate yourself
with a golf score.

1042
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:33,825
Well, how
would you know?

1043
01:03:33,892 --> 01:03:35,393
It looks to me like
you quit on your dream,

1044
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:37,712
living out here on this
God forsaken goat ranch.

1045
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:39,297
And this
is your dream today?

1046
01:03:39,364 --> 01:03:40,681
This? This is your dream?

1047
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:50,908
You can lead
a horse to water,

1048
01:03:50,975 --> 01:03:53,077
but you can't make him drink.

1049
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:46,364
I'm sorry, Johnny.

1050
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:49,817
I forgive you, son.

1051
01:05:01,129 --> 01:05:03,047
Whose grave you digging?

1052
01:05:03,114 --> 01:05:06,234
You'll soon see.

1053
01:05:09,687 --> 01:05:11,722
What's yours gonna say?

1054
01:05:15,561 --> 01:05:16,877
Mine?

1055
01:05:16,945 --> 01:05:20,898
Yeah, your epitaph,
your headstone.

1056
01:05:20,965 --> 01:05:23,501
What do you want people
to say about you

1057
01:05:23,568 --> 01:05:27,455
when you're gone, huh?

1058
01:05:29,941 --> 01:05:33,844
Maybe it'll say
you shot a 59.

1059
01:05:36,014 --> 01:05:36,564
Huh?

1060
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:40,501
I never thought of it
like that.

1061
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:45,572
Maybe we'll just
leave it blank for now.

1062
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:52,896
No. I mean...

1063
01:05:52,964 --> 01:05:56,100
I'd want it to say...

1064
01:05:59,304 --> 01:06:00,738
Something.

1065
01:06:02,157 --> 01:06:06,060
It will.

1066
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:12,450
But I don't think
that your coming here...

1067
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:14,919
Was an accident.

1068
01:06:16,704 --> 01:06:17,755
But only you can decide

1069
01:06:17,823 --> 01:06:19,423
what to do
from here on out,

1070
01:06:19,491 --> 01:06:21,759
'cause, I mean,

1071
01:06:21,827 --> 01:06:26,214
there's nothing more
I can teach you, son.

1072
01:06:35,523 --> 01:06:37,608
Thank you, Johnny.

1073
01:06:37,676 --> 01:06:40,361
No, don't thank me.

1074
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,463
Thank him.

1075
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:45,199
'Cause God is all around us.

1076
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:50,020
Inside of each of us,
if you listen...

1077
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:53,123
There's a still small voice
of truth

1078
01:06:53,191 --> 01:06:54,809
leading us...

1079
01:06:56,761 --> 01:06:58,696
Talking to us,

1080
01:06:58,763 --> 01:07:00,448
and telling you

1081
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,650
that you...

1082
01:07:05,837 --> 01:07:07,938
Can see God's face...

1083
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:13,660
Feel his presence...

1084
01:07:13,728 --> 01:07:16,113
Trust his love.

1085
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:18,199
Yeah.

1086
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:20,901
S.F.T.

1087
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:23,020
Huh?

1088
01:07:25,524 --> 01:07:26,974
S.F.T.

1089
01:07:28,259 --> 01:07:30,294
God bless you.

1090
01:07:30,362 --> 01:07:31,912
Happy easter.

1091
01:08:03,111 --> 01:08:05,279
Luke, inside this box

1092
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:08,182
is a pencil
and two pieces of paper.

1093
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,635
One is for writing down
all the truths you learned

1094
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:14,321
during your time
here in utopia.

1095
01:08:14,389 --> 01:08:18,359
The truth that life is about
faith, relationships,

1096
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:20,678
character, and integrity.

1097
01:08:20,746 --> 01:08:23,614
That God has a purpose
and calling for you

1098
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:24,948
that is much deeper

1099
01:08:25,016 --> 01:08:27,785
than a little white ball
falling into the cup.

1100
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:31,188
These truths will become
your new heartbeat,

1101
01:08:31,256 --> 01:08:33,674
the foundation
of your new life.

1102
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:35,860
The other piece of paper

1103
01:08:35,928 --> 01:08:37,294
is for writing down
all the lies

1104
01:08:37,362 --> 01:08:39,897
you've been told
during your life.

1105
01:08:39,965 --> 01:08:41,298
Lies like your golf score

1106
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:44,385
being a reflection
of your true identity

1107
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,719
and self-worth,

1108
01:08:45,787 --> 01:08:47,388
or that failure in golf

1109
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,357
is failure in life.

1110
01:08:49,424 --> 01:08:51,242
Take the truths with you,

1111
01:08:51,309 --> 01:08:55,929
but bury the lies
right here, right now.

1112
01:08:55,997 --> 01:08:59,183
Once you have buried
your lies,

1113
01:08:59,251 --> 01:09:01,919
chisel your living epitaph.

1114
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:07,658
¶ Today I found myself ¶

1115
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:14,682
¶ after searching
all these years ¶

1116
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,134
¶ and the man that I saw ¶

1117
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:18,902
¶ he wasn't at all ¶

1118
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:23,273
¶ who I thought he'd be ¶

1119
01:09:23,341 --> 01:09:28,679
¶ I was lost
when you found me here ¶

1120
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:34,484
¶ I was broken
beyond repair ¶

1121
01:09:34,552 --> 01:09:37,487
¶ then you came along ¶

1122
01:09:37,555 --> 01:09:39,823
¶ and you sang your song ¶

1123
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:45,780
¶ over me ¶

1124
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:50,050
¶ it feels like
I'm born again ¶

1125
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:55,539
¶ it feels like
I'm living ¶

1126
01:09:55,606 --> 01:09:59,110
¶ for the very first time ¶

1127
01:09:59,177 --> 01:10:03,814
¶ I'm living
for the first time ¶

1128
01:10:03,882 --> 01:10:07,868
¶ it feels like
I'm born again ¶

1129
01:10:07,935 --> 01:10:12,956
¶ it feels like
I'm living ¶

1130
01:10:13,024 --> 01:10:21,649
¶ for the very first time ¶

1131
01:10:21,716 --> 01:10:26,370
¶ it feels like
I'm breathing ¶

1132
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:31,192
¶ it feels like
I'm moving ¶

1133
01:10:31,259 --> 01:10:34,328
¶ for the very first time ¶

1134
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:39,516
¶ in my life ¶

1135
01:10:59,738 --> 01:11:01,955
all ready to go,
are we?

1136
01:11:02,023 --> 01:11:04,641
Yeah, I think so.

1137
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:05,993
Don't think.

1138
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:09,179
See, feel, trust.

1139
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:12,082
Yeah.

1140
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:14,167
Now, before you leave,

1141
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:15,819
I have something
for you.

1142
01:11:15,887 --> 01:11:17,488
I have something here.

1143
01:11:17,556 --> 01:11:22,859
Well, you've given me more
than I can repay, sir.

1144
01:11:22,927 --> 01:11:25,079
Well, gifts aren't meant
to be repaid.

1145
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:27,614
They're meant
to be passed along.

1146
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,183
Look at this.

1147
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:33,721
That was
my last tournament.

1148
01:11:33,788 --> 01:11:34,871
You notice anything?

1149
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,223
Huh?

1150
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:39,827
Well, you're not on
the leaderboard.

1151
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:42,279
Yeah, that, but no.
Look again. Look again.

1152
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:43,447
Look.

1153
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:48,352
Oh, it's the Texas open.

1154
01:11:48,419 --> 01:11:49,186
Right.

1155
01:11:49,254 --> 01:11:50,387
That's this weekend.

1156
01:11:50,455 --> 01:11:52,890
Yeah. The tournament's
main sponsor

1157
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:54,058
is an old friend.

1158
01:11:54,075 --> 01:11:55,409
He says
as a personal favor

1159
01:11:55,477 --> 01:12:00,064
he'll offer you one
of his free exemptions.

1160
01:12:01,299 --> 01:12:03,633
All right?

1161
01:12:03,701 --> 01:12:06,486
Huh?

1162
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:08,471
Man.

1163
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:15,846
I don't...

1164
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:17,198
I don't know what to say.

1165
01:12:17,265 --> 01:12:19,116
Well, I think,
between you and me,

1166
01:12:19,184 --> 01:12:21,318
it's all about
the ratings.

1167
01:12:21,386 --> 01:12:23,537
He's probably hoping
you have another meltdown,

1168
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:26,757
and I'm hoping that
you can prove him wrong.

1169
01:12:26,825 --> 01:12:28,609
Yeah.

1170
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,377
Well, you can count on it.

1171
01:12:30,445 --> 01:12:31,612
Oh, yeah.

1172
01:12:37,218 --> 01:12:40,120
Now, don't go running over
any of them cows,

1173
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:42,439
because I don't want you
to ruin my pie.

1174
01:12:42,507 --> 01:12:43,690
Well, don't worry.

1175
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,242
I can see
a little better now.

1176
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:46,159
Yeah, you can.

1177
01:12:46,227 --> 01:12:49,630
Okay. God bless you, son.

1178
01:12:49,697 --> 01:12:51,215
God bless you.

1179
01:12:52,717 --> 01:12:54,835
Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

1180
01:12:54,902 --> 01:12:56,420
I'm gonna miss
y'all, too.

1181
01:12:56,487 --> 01:12:58,839
Thank you so much
for everything.

1182
01:12:58,906 --> 01:13:00,357
You bet.

1183
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:11,785
Got you a little gift.

1184
01:13:11,852 --> 01:13:13,854
Just keep the lid off it

1185
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,956
and you can come visit
whenever you want.

1186
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,558
Well...

1187
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:23,213
Till next time, then.

1188
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:24,665
Next time.

1189
01:13:39,831 --> 01:13:41,582
You need any more
putting lessons,

1190
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,133
you just let me know.

1191
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:47,955
Hey, tour boy.

1192
01:13:53,945 --> 01:13:55,278
Well, if you need
some lessons

1193
01:13:55,346 --> 01:13:57,114
on some cowboy poker,

1194
01:13:57,182 --> 01:14:01,518
well, you're just gonna have
to figure it out yourself.

1195
01:14:06,091 --> 01:14:07,357
Johnny.

1196
01:14:07,425 --> 01:14:08,842
Yeah.

1197
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:10,344
Thank you for everything.

1198
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:13,831
No, I wanna thank you
for everything.

1199
01:14:13,898 --> 01:14:15,632
I really do.

1200
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:18,719
Yeah.

1201
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:29,330
And, son, I do believe.

1202
01:14:29,397 --> 01:14:30,798
Okay?

1203
01:14:30,865 --> 01:14:31,799
Yes, sir.

1204
01:14:31,816 --> 01:14:34,501
God bless you.

1205
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:35,803
Thank you.

1206
01:15:27,722 --> 01:15:29,990
Let's get you
something to eat.

1207
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,558
Yes, mom.

1208
01:15:43,838 --> 01:15:46,173
Hey, bud.

1209
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:50,076
I got you
a little present.

1210
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:55,315
Callaway's latest
and greatest.

1211
01:16:00,588 --> 01:16:02,356
Thanks, dad.

1212
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:18,021
Luke, uh...

1213
01:16:18,089 --> 01:16:22,025
My actions last week...

1214
01:16:22,093 --> 01:16:25,529
Were wrong.

1215
01:16:25,596 --> 01:16:30,967
I pushed you your whole
life to succeed at golf,

1216
01:16:31,035 --> 01:16:32,969
and I never once asked

1217
01:16:33,037 --> 01:16:34,971
if that's what
you wanted.

1218
01:16:38,242 --> 01:16:39,827
I'm sorry for that.

1219
01:16:43,081 --> 01:16:45,231
Well, I forgive you.

1220
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:50,187
I only want
what's best for you.

1221
01:16:54,308 --> 01:16:55,776
I know.

1222
01:16:58,996 --> 01:17:01,831
I love you, dad.

1223
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:03,917
I love you, too, son.

1224
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,973
Well...

1225
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:14,878
Ain't looked at mine
in a while.

1226
01:17:16,314 --> 01:17:18,265
Might be overdue.

1227
01:17:22,036 --> 01:17:24,104
Good night, son.

1228
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:25,806
Welcome home.

1229
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:30,694
Hey, dad.

1230
01:17:30,762 --> 01:17:34,248
Yeah?

1231
01:17:34,315 --> 01:17:35,999
I almost forgot.

1232
01:17:38,636 --> 01:17:41,704
You wanna caddy for me
this week in the Texas open?

1233
01:17:57,805 --> 01:17:59,089
Welcome, everyone,

1234
01:17:59,157 --> 01:18:01,091
to the pride
of the lone star state,

1235
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:02,559
the Valero Texas open.

1236
01:18:02,626 --> 01:18:03,726
I'm Kelly Tilghman

1237
01:18:03,794 --> 01:18:06,263
with pga tour winner
Brandel Chamblee.

1238
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:08,248
A compelling story
this week, Brandel,

1239
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,150
was the sponsor invite,
Luke Chisolm.

1240
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:11,318
How does one go

1241
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:13,153
from oblivion
to center stage?

1242
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,754
This man knows, Kelly.

1243
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:16,556
In his first
pga tour event,

1244
01:18:16,624 --> 01:18:18,609
he has a chance
for redemption.

1245
01:18:18,676 --> 01:18:19,759
Now on the first tee,

1246
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:22,262
from waco, Texas,
Luke Chisolm.

1247
01:18:37,562 --> 01:18:38,729
Round two and three

1248
01:18:38,863 --> 01:18:40,364
saw heated action
atop the leaderboard.

1249
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:41,865
Some of golf's
biggest names

1250
01:18:41,932 --> 01:18:42,899
pining for the lead.

1251
01:18:42,967 --> 01:18:44,968
Rich beem, Stewart Cink,

1252
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:47,487
TKO, and Ricky Fowler.

1253
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:56,145
Come on, TKO!

1254
01:18:56,213 --> 01:18:57,497
This pressure-filled Sunday

1255
01:18:57,565 --> 01:18:58,598
at the Texas open

1256
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,501
offers an abundance
of characters.

1257
01:19:00,568 --> 01:19:04,404
Stewart Cink, four time
masters champ TKO,

1258
01:19:04,472 --> 01:19:07,123
and we have a local talent
with fresh wounds.

1259
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:08,625
The surprise performance

1260
01:19:08,693 --> 01:19:11,961
coming from Luke Chisolm,
just two weeks removed

1261
01:19:12,029 --> 01:19:13,547
from that
complete meltdown

1262
01:19:13,614 --> 01:19:15,632
at the lone star event
in San Antonio.

1263
01:19:15,699 --> 01:19:17,867
And now, he finds
himself chasing,

1264
01:19:17,935 --> 01:19:20,587
of all people, TKO,
atop the leaderboard.

1265
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:23,240
And, Kelly, you really
couldn't script it

1266
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:24,140
any better than this.

1267
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:25,492
No. No, you can't Brandel.

1268
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,444
We've seen
cinderella stories before,

1269
01:19:27,511 --> 01:19:28,761
but we've also seen

1270
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,413
what TKO has done
to those glass slippers.

1271
01:19:30,481 --> 01:19:31,731
He has crushed them.

1272
01:19:31,799 --> 01:19:32,982
And we pick up
with Luke Chisolm

1273
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,835
now on the 10th tee.

1274
01:19:37,255 --> 01:19:38,555
Let's hit 3-wood.

1275
01:19:38,623 --> 01:19:40,941
Fairway's
a little tight.

1276
01:19:42,627 --> 01:19:44,428
Chisolm
playing it safe here

1277
01:19:44,495 --> 01:19:47,631
with the 3-wood on
this very reachable par 5.

1278
01:20:01,595 --> 01:20:03,112
That's okay,
Luke.

1279
01:20:04,465 --> 01:20:06,483
And that shot
will very likely

1280
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,285
put some demons
in his head.

1281
01:20:08,352 --> 01:20:10,370
It was a shot almost
identical to that

1282
01:20:10,437 --> 01:20:13,106
that started
his monumental blowup

1283
01:20:13,174 --> 01:20:14,440
a few weeks ago.

1284
01:20:14,508 --> 01:20:16,509
Luke's gonna have
to conquer those demons

1285
01:20:16,577 --> 01:20:18,128
if he wants to win,

1286
01:20:18,195 --> 01:20:20,496
and that's one of the toughest
things to do in golf.

1287
01:20:20,564 --> 01:20:22,782
Well, what you want
to do, son?

1288
01:20:27,037 --> 01:20:29,506
Go back to the tee.

1289
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:35,529
Head up, Luke.

1290
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:42,402
Well, it's gonna be
one heck of a par, dad.

1291
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:43,820
Oh, you got it.

1292
01:20:45,406 --> 01:20:48,408
Having taken an unplayable
lie on his first drive,

1293
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:50,343
Chisolm is now back
on the tee

1294
01:20:50,411 --> 01:20:51,545
hitting his third shot.

1295
01:20:51,662 --> 01:20:52,729
Looks like he's going

1296
01:20:52,796 --> 01:20:53,763
with the driver
this time, Brandel.

1297
01:20:53,831 --> 01:20:55,031
And Kelly,
I don't know why

1298
01:20:55,099 --> 01:20:56,433
he didn't use driver
the first go around.

1299
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:58,635
He hasn't sniffed
missing a tee shot

1300
01:20:58,703 --> 01:21:01,838
all week long with that
callaway octane driver.

1301
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:44,347
Perfect!

1302
01:21:44,415 --> 01:21:46,883
Exactly as he has
all week long.

1303
01:21:46,918 --> 01:21:49,352
See you
in the clubhouse, boys.

1304
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,137
Y'all play well.

1305
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:54,674
A par after
taking an unplayable

1306
01:21:54,742 --> 01:21:58,128
could be a turning point
for Chisolm.

1307
01:22:02,683 --> 01:22:05,118
This Sunday has given us
a great leaderboard.

1308
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,403
Rich beem capable
of a big charge,

1309
01:22:07,438 --> 01:22:08,655
question marks
surrounding Luke Chisolm,

1310
01:22:08,722 --> 01:22:10,841
and TKO as intimidating
as ever.

1311
01:22:10,941 --> 01:22:13,427
But it looks like we're
winding down to just two.

1312
01:22:13,494 --> 01:22:15,778
A classic
David and Goliath story

1313
01:22:15,846 --> 01:22:17,730
between Chisolm and TKO.

1314
01:22:20,585 --> 01:22:23,603
Chisolm from 12 feet...

1315
01:22:23,671 --> 01:22:25,304
And he sinks it!

1316
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,607
Luke Chisolm
just one back of TKO.

1317
01:22:27,675 --> 01:22:29,442
You know he's licking
his chops right here,

1318
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:30,576
not only to make birdie,

1319
01:22:30,644 --> 01:22:32,312
but to put the pressure
on TKO

1320
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,781
to do the same
and avoid a playoff.

1321
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:37,467
Remember, TKO
eagled this hole yesterday.

1322
01:22:37,534 --> 01:22:39,669
And now Luke Chisolm
with his second shot

1323
01:22:39,737 --> 01:22:42,071
to this par 4 on the 18th hole.

1324
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:04,027
Yeah!

1325
01:23:16,974 --> 01:23:19,726
The pressure
is really on TKO now.

1326
01:23:19,793 --> 01:23:23,045
He has no choice
but to go for the green.

1327
01:23:25,216 --> 01:23:27,100
This one's looking good,
Brandel.

1328
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:31,087
It's on the green
with a chance at eagle.

1329
01:23:31,155 --> 01:23:33,957
He makes it look easy,
doesn't he, Kelly?

1330
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:41,714
What an answer
by the steely veteran TKO,

1331
01:23:41,782 --> 01:23:43,149
who drove the green.

1332
01:23:43,217 --> 01:23:46,620
If he makes this
eagle putt, he wins.

1333
01:23:58,633 --> 01:23:59,866
And how's this
for excitement?

1334
01:23:59,933 --> 01:24:02,953
Tko and Chisolm
are headed to a playoff,

1335
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,821
both men tied at 16 under.

1336
01:24:04,889 --> 01:24:06,656
And TKO has the
upper hand once again.

1337
01:24:06,724 --> 01:24:08,124
He's never been
defeated in a playoff

1338
01:24:08,191 --> 01:24:09,392
on the pga tour,

1339
01:24:09,459 --> 01:24:11,961
and Luke Chisolm, his
first taste in extra holes.

1340
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,879
They're going back
to the 18th tee,

1341
01:24:13,947 --> 01:24:15,781
where anything can happen.

1342
01:24:22,723 --> 01:24:25,625
Tko and Luke Chisolm
are about to tee off

1343
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:27,711
on one of the greatest
risk/reward holes

1344
01:24:27,778 --> 01:24:28,879
in all of golf.

1345
01:24:28,946 --> 01:24:30,897
And earlier,
Brandel had a chance

1346
01:24:30,964 --> 01:24:34,651
to take a closer look at this
tremendous finishing hole.

1347
01:24:34,686 --> 01:24:37,036
The finishing hole here
is a great one.

1348
01:24:37,104 --> 01:24:39,806
A drivable par 4
of 355 yards

1349
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,208
that plays downhill

1350
01:24:41,275 --> 01:24:42,958
and gives the players
a lot of choices.

1351
01:24:43,026 --> 01:24:45,328
But those choices
come with risks.

1352
01:24:45,396 --> 01:24:47,897
The green is protected
by a tree and a bunker

1353
01:24:47,965 --> 01:24:49,548
and a treacherous
water hazard.

1354
01:24:49,616 --> 01:24:52,902
The green itself
is very narrow and fast,

1355
01:24:52,969 --> 01:24:54,120
with a lot of slope in it.

1356
01:24:54,188 --> 01:24:55,304
And a two-putt
from above the hole

1357
01:24:55,372 --> 01:24:57,306
is highly unlikely.

1358
01:24:57,374 --> 01:24:58,992
But one of the worst places

1359
01:24:59,059 --> 01:25:00,560
that a player
could drive the ball

1360
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:02,229
would be long
and to the left

1361
01:25:02,296 --> 01:25:03,346
in that area there,

1362
01:25:03,414 --> 01:25:06,833
because an up and down
would be almost impossible.

1363
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,085
And his pitch shot

1364
01:25:09,152 --> 01:25:11,721
would most likely run off
the front of the green.

1365
01:25:11,789 --> 01:25:14,106
And there
you have it, folks.

1366
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:16,943
This hole provides
the perfect stage

1367
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,778
for the drama
that's about to unfold.

1368
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:25,902
Well, no surprise
here, folks,

1369
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:27,737
that TKO has taken
driver out.

1370
01:25:27,805 --> 01:25:29,072
Obviously trying
to make an eagle

1371
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,540
and win this thing
outright.

1372
01:25:30,607 --> 01:25:33,109
But in doing so, he brings
double bogey into play.

1373
01:25:33,177 --> 01:25:36,229
Tko lives
for moments like this.

1374
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:39,449
And TKO is one
of perhaps just 10 players

1375
01:25:39,516 --> 01:25:41,150
who can drive this green.

1376
01:25:41,218 --> 01:25:44,437
We saw him do it just
moments ago in regulation.

1377
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,096
Oh, it sounds like
he crushed that one.

1378
01:25:53,164 --> 01:25:54,380
Yeah, it's
a good looking swing.

1379
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:55,131
Always in balance.

1380
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,150
It took off
on the right line.

1381
01:25:57,217 --> 01:25:59,619
But there's more wind now
than there was earlier.

1382
01:25:59,686 --> 01:26:00,686
He's getting more help,

1383
01:26:00,754 --> 01:26:02,855
and with his
high ball flight,

1384
01:26:02,923 --> 01:26:04,840
carrying that creek
should not be a problem,

1385
01:26:04,908 --> 01:26:09,662
but holding this green
will be.

1386
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:10,946
Oh, look at this.

1387
01:26:11,014 --> 01:26:13,065
This could be
serious trouble.

1388
01:26:13,133 --> 01:26:16,352
That's the danger zone
Brandel was just describing.

1389
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,446
Luke Chisolm going with
the conservative play,

1390
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:27,413
iron off the tee.

1391
01:26:27,481 --> 01:26:29,081
No surprise
there, Kelly.

1392
01:26:29,149 --> 01:26:31,133
He's stuck to that
game plan all week,

1393
01:26:31,201 --> 01:26:32,702
and with
only one exception

1394
01:26:32,769 --> 01:26:34,004
has he strayed
from the fairway.

1395
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:35,238
He's looking
to put this ball

1396
01:26:35,306 --> 01:26:37,407
in a spot where he
gets the right number,

1397
01:26:37,475 --> 01:26:38,842
gets a wedge
in his hand,

1398
01:26:38,909 --> 01:26:42,078
and he can put
the pressure on TKO.

1399
01:27:09,022 --> 01:27:10,539
Luke seems relaxed.

1400
01:27:10,607 --> 01:27:12,708
Is this the same player
from two weeks ago?

1401
01:27:12,776 --> 01:27:13,960
No, it's not
the same player.

1402
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:15,161
He may have
the same swing,

1403
01:27:15,229 --> 01:27:17,497
but a completely
different outlook.

1404
01:27:17,564 --> 01:27:19,165
What do we got?

1405
01:27:19,233 --> 01:27:20,800
75 yards?

1406
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:22,468
Just like in regulation.

1407
01:27:22,536 --> 01:27:23,469
Yeah.

1408
01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:25,138
Lob wedge.

1409
01:27:25,205 --> 01:27:26,423
Thank you.

1410
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:27,774
This is the same shot

1411
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:29,526
he had
just a few moments ago,

1412
01:27:29,593 --> 01:27:32,095
however, the situation
is entirely different.

1413
01:27:32,162 --> 01:27:34,630
He knows
that given TKO's lie,

1414
01:27:34,698 --> 01:27:35,932
he could win
this tournament.

1415
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,333
Whereas
a few moments ago,

1416
01:27:37,401 --> 01:27:39,802
he was chasing.

1417
01:27:44,575 --> 01:27:47,326
See it.

1418
01:27:47,394 --> 01:27:49,712
Feel it.

1419
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:51,380
And trust.

1420
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,077
Not quite like
his holeout in regulation,

1421
01:28:05,145 --> 01:28:07,163
but under the circumstances,
a very solid shot.

1422
01:28:07,231 --> 01:28:08,982
If TKO was looking
for a gift

1423
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,767
from an
inexperienced Luke,

1424
01:28:10,834 --> 01:28:12,068
he didn't get it.

1425
01:28:12,136 --> 01:28:15,071
Tko has a nearly
impossible pitch.

1426
01:28:15,139 --> 01:28:16,405
He's looking
at a tight flag,

1427
01:28:16,473 --> 01:28:18,108
the green
is running away from him,

1428
01:28:18,175 --> 01:28:20,076
not to mention the water.

1429
01:28:20,144 --> 01:28:21,778
Anything short
of hitting that flagstick

1430
01:28:21,846 --> 01:28:23,062
and he's probably
going swimming.

1431
01:28:23,129 --> 01:28:24,314
Plain and simple
here, Kelly.

1432
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:25,648
He needs to play
away from the hole.

1433
01:28:25,715 --> 01:28:27,066
It's a pretty safe bet

1434
01:28:27,133 --> 01:28:28,968
that's going to have
a longer birdie putt

1435
01:28:29,035 --> 01:28:30,787
than Luke's 8 footer.

1436
01:28:30,855 --> 01:28:33,022
The ultimate test for TKO,

1437
01:28:33,089 --> 01:28:34,207
but I wouldn't
put it past him.

1438
01:28:34,274 --> 01:28:35,491
He's done it before.

1439
01:28:35,559 --> 01:28:37,443
Look at him
sizing this up.

1440
01:28:37,511 --> 01:28:39,162
It almost looks like-

1441
01:28:39,229 --> 01:28:40,096
and he is, I think,

1442
01:28:40,164 --> 01:28:41,430
gonna go
right at this hole.

1443
01:28:41,498 --> 01:28:43,183
This absolutely
makes no sense to me.

1444
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,951
If he doesn't hole this,

1445
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:46,202
it's very likely
that this ball's

1446
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:47,320
gonna run
off of the green.

1447
01:28:47,387 --> 01:28:48,955
This would really
be something.

1448
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:51,807
And he's got to aim
right for the flagstick.

1449
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:53,742
Anything short
of perfect here,

1450
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:55,678
he's looking
at bogie at best.

1451
01:28:55,746 --> 01:28:57,297
That's if he's lucky enough
to avoid the water.

1452
01:28:57,364 --> 01:28:59,849
The only way
to pull this shot off

1453
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:01,584
on that line
is with a lot of speed

1454
01:29:01,652 --> 01:29:02,452
a lot of spin,

1455
01:29:02,519 --> 01:29:04,119
and he has to
land it in an area

1456
01:29:04,187 --> 01:29:06,539
about as big
as a dinner plate.

1457
01:29:17,767 --> 01:29:19,652
And it looks good.

1458
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:24,507
It's got a chance.

1459
01:29:25,842 --> 01:29:27,860
Remarkable!

1460
01:29:27,928 --> 01:29:29,045
He's unlucky, Kelly,

1461
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:30,046
that that ball
didn't go in,

1462
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,831
but lucky that
it stayed on the green

1463
01:29:31,898 --> 01:29:34,851
and gave him about a
15-foot putt up the hill,

1464
01:29:34,918 --> 01:29:36,852
and maybe he can put
the pressure on Luke.

1465
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,822
And look at him.
He's not even phased.

1466
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:42,908
This is a makeable putt
for TKO.

1467
01:29:42,976 --> 01:29:44,727
Is this where
experience pays off?

1468
01:29:44,794 --> 01:29:46,095
Generally speaking,
first in

1469
01:29:46,163 --> 01:29:47,429
in a playoff wins.

1470
01:29:47,497 --> 01:29:49,498
And if he makes this,
I promise you,

1471
01:29:49,566 --> 01:29:52,202
that hole will look
a lot smaller to Luke.

1472
01:29:55,772 --> 01:30:00,176
How many times has TKO
been in this exact spot

1473
01:30:00,244 --> 01:30:01,844
and emerged victorious?

1474
01:30:01,912 --> 01:30:03,346
It's that mental edge

1475
01:30:03,413 --> 01:30:07,350
that makes him the great
player that he is.

1476
01:30:17,144 --> 01:30:18,594
He thought he had that one.

1477
01:30:18,662 --> 01:30:19,361
Tko's tee shot

1478
01:30:19,396 --> 01:30:21,113
left him
with a lot of stress.

1479
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:23,483
His second shot left him
with a lot of work.

1480
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:25,985
And now it's Luke
who has the work to do.

1481
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:27,837
And TKO no longer
has control

1482
01:30:27,988 --> 01:30:29,038
of his own fate.

1483
01:30:29,106 --> 01:30:31,758
That control lies
with Luke Chisolm.

1484
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:35,278
It was a great par

1485
01:30:35,345 --> 01:30:38,081
for TKO
just to stay in it.

1486
01:30:38,148 --> 01:30:39,581
But now
the door is open

1487
01:30:39,649 --> 01:30:42,585
for Luke Chisolm
to win the Texas open.

1488
01:30:42,653 --> 01:30:44,854
One can only imagine
what's going on

1489
01:30:45,005 --> 01:30:46,506
in the mind of
Luke Chisolm right now.

1490
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:49,008
Two weeks ago
his career was over,

1491
01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:51,010
and now
he is one putt away

1492
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:52,512
from taking
the Texas open

1493
01:30:52,579 --> 01:30:54,430
and beating
the best player in golf

1494
01:30:54,498 --> 01:30:56,448
in the process.

1495
01:31:26,597 --> 01:31:29,899
Luke knew this putt
was meaningless

1496
01:31:29,967 --> 01:31:31,167
in the big picture.

1497
01:31:31,234 --> 01:31:36,372
He was now answering
to a higher calling.

1498
01:31:36,439 --> 01:31:39,858
It was time to go to a place
beyond tradition,

1499
01:31:39,926 --> 01:31:42,178
to a place of buried lies

1500
01:31:42,246 --> 01:31:46,366
and unearthed truths.

1501
01:31:46,483 --> 01:31:50,036
A revolution had begun
within Luke's soul.

1502
01:31:50,103 --> 01:31:53,039
He had a purpose
and a calling

1503
01:31:53,106 --> 01:31:55,174
that went beyond
any scoreboard.

1504
01:32:54,984 --> 01:32:58,287
He saw, felt, trusted,

1505
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:01,641
and stroked
the putt of his life.

1506
01:33:11,801 --> 01:33:16,772
Utopia is defined as a place
of mythical perfection,

1507
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,108
but I knew differently.

1508
01:33:19,176 --> 01:33:22,045
Utopia is indeed real.

1509
01:33:22,112 --> 01:33:26,182
It's a place where
the voice of truth resides

1510
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:30,453
and eternal trophies
line the shelves.

1511
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:35,324
A place where
there are no accidents.

1512
01:33:35,392 --> 01:33:37,126
I guess
you're asking yourselves

1513
01:33:37,194 --> 01:33:39,962
whether or not
he made the putt.

1514
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:42,898
The better question is,

1515
01:33:42,966 --> 01:33:46,235
does it really matter?

1516
01:33:46,303 --> 01:33:50,306
How can a game
have such an effect

1517
01:33:50,374 --> 01:33:52,375
on a man's soul?
