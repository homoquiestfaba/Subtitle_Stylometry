1
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,107
Remi!

2
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:16,276
Remi, look!

3
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,579
I got you a surprise.

4
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,016
Wiener-Dog!

5
00:04:28,756 --> 00:04:31,258
Now who's gonna walk it?

6
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:33,260
I'll walk it.

7
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:34,828
And Remi will pitch in, too.

8
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,564
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

9
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,898
Damn right I don't have to.

10
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:39,533
But tell me
who's going to clean up

11
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,034
after it shits all over
the living room floor.

12
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:43,804
Remi understands.
He's not a little kid.

13
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:46,106
He's a fucking survivor!

14
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:52,813
His hair is all grown back.

15
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,482
The doctor said
it would be fine

16
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:57,050
as long as he keeps up
with the blood work.

17
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:59,720
And now he's got all summer
to learn how to housebreak it.

18
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:02,490
It's gonna be good for him.

19
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:04,525
Fucking asshole.

20
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:34,354
Shh.
It's okay.

21
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,089
It's okay, Wiener-Dog.

22
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,658
I'm here.

23
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,294
Shh.

24
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:45,198
Heel!
Heel!

25
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,401
Heel! Goddamn it!

26
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:50,638
Heel!

27
00:05:50,704 --> 00:05:52,072
Motherfucker! Heel.

28
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,742
Heel, motherfucker.
Heel, motherfucker.

29
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:08,689
Hey, Dad,
when do you think

30
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:11,725
we can let Wiener-Dog
out of her cage?

31
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:17,064
When she's housebroken.

32
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,568
Why do people
say "housebroken"?

33
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,402
Because...

34
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:26,006
Remi, you have to break a dog,

35
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:27,775
break their will,

36
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:31,244
so that they'll submit
to your will.

37
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:34,314
It's a kind of civilizing.

38
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,750
So they act like humans.

39
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:42,155
You mean so they go
to the bathroom outside

40
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:44,391
instead of inside?

41
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:46,193
Exactly.

42
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:52,966
But when you break a will,

43
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,935
well...

44
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:59,272
What is a will exactly, anyway?

45
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,809
It's character.

46
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,812
Force of character.

47
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:08,782
It's the thing
that makes you you.

48
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,374
Hey, Remi, it's time!

49
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:36,209
We have to go the vet!

50
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,157
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

51
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:52,159
What's "spaying" mean?

52
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:54,294
It just means, this way,
we don't have to worry

53
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:55,829
about the dog getting pregnant.

54
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,831
What do they do to her?

55
00:07:57,898 --> 00:08:00,701
Really, it's nothing.
She won't know any different.

56
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:02,002
Does it hurt?

57
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:03,737
No, really, it happens so fast,

58
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:05,839
she won't even
know what happened.

59
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,141
But what do they do to her?

60
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,044
You know, honey,
I'm really not sure.

61
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:14,547
I mean, all dogs get this done.

62
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:16,416
Really, it's like going
to the dentist

63
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:17,685
and having your teeth cleaned.

64
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:19,019
No big deal.

65
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:22,189
But what if Wiener-Dog
wants to have puppies.

66
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:25,092
She won't.
Believe me, that's a total myth.

67
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:27,761
But what
if Wiener-Dog's different?

68
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,496
Honey, she's not.

69
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,364
She's not like you and me.

70
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:32,966
She doesn't think this way.

71
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,268
She doesn't think.
I mean, she's just a dog.

72
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,337
But she has feelings.

73
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:41,208
Oh, sweetheart, I know,
and you're right.

74
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:44,311
But with a dog,
things are different.

75
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:46,046
A dog is not human.

76
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:47,715
It's an animal.

77
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:49,349
They look to us for guidance.

78
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,618
Without us,
they wouldn't even be here.

79
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,721
What do you mean?

80
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:55,588
Nature doesn't care about them.

81
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,557
It's sad but true.

82
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:01,094
We're dog's only friend.

83
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:02,529
Can I watch?

84
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:05,065
No, definitely not.

85
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:07,600
The doctor has to be able
to concentrate.

86
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:10,070
I won't say anything.

87
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm sorry, Remi,
but it's just not allowed.

88
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:15,242
But Wiener-Dog will be scared.

89
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:17,911
I know she'll want
to hold my hand.

90
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:20,513
Wiener-Dog will be fine.
Really.

91
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,550
But if you're there with her,
you'll bring in germs with you.

92
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:26,286
It would be just like
when during intensification,

93
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:28,255
remember, all the nausea

94
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:30,390
and then all sorts
of complications

95
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:33,761
could start up...
Serious complications.

96
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:36,129
Like what?

97
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:41,068
She could die.

98
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,379
All right, then.

99
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:04,224
Run!
Run, Wiener-Dog, run!

100
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,126
Run, run!

101
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,028
Oh!

102
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:09,797
Remi!

103
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:27,547
Oh!

104
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:30,417
Well, I don't think
there'll be any barking tonight.

105
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:35,789
Way to go.

106
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:53,640
Hi, honey.

107
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:55,442
Honey.

108
00:10:58,211 --> 00:10:59,847
Hi.

109
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,282
You know, when I was
a little girl in France,

110
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:05,485
we had a little dog also...
A poodle.

111
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:07,554
My mother
found her at the animal shelter,

112
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,156
and she decided to take her in

113
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:13,426
because she was so cute
and cuddly and sweet and funny.

114
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:14,928
We named her Croissant

115
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:17,497
because she loved croissants
so much.

116
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:20,400
But then, a few months
after she moved in,

117
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:23,003
she suddenly started getting
a little tired,

118
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,872
like she was depressed.

119
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,875
All her happy spirit
seemed to have vanished.

120
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:30,878
And that's when we found
out she was pregnant.

121
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:33,413
Who was the father?

122
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,884
Well, turns out...

123
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,451
she was raped.

124
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:41,889
What do you mean?

125
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,392
Well, it was a stray dog
in the woods.

126
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,395
He was called Muhammad.

127
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,663
Hair all matted
and scratched up,

128
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,199
all oily and ugly...

129
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:54,401
The kind of dog
that growled and snarled,

130
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:56,904
the kind of dog that has
rabies or ticks

131
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:59,272
or even worse.

132
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,074
Like what?

133
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:03,610
Like possibly...

134
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,745
a venereal disease.

135
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:08,148
You mean like...

136
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:09,983
AIDS?

137
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:15,422
Anyway, at the end,
Croissant became very sick.

138
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:19,159
All her hair
started falling out, her teeth.

139
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:22,029
Oh, it was too horrible.

140
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:25,032
And then when she gave birth,
she was in so much pain.

141
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:27,167
We gave her as many painkillers
as we could,

142
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:29,769
but she wouldn't
stop whimpering.

143
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,939
And then she died.

144
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:35,842
What about her puppies?

145
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:38,078
Stillborn.

146
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:41,148
If only she had been spayed.

147
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:44,251
- Poor Croissant.
- Yeah.

148
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:46,253
What happened to Muhammad?

149
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:49,189
- Oh, Remi.
- What?

150
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:52,792
Well, it went on raping...

151
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,494
raping.

152
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:58,798
Supposedly even squirrels
were victimized.

153
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,434
Until one day, it was shot dead.

154
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:06,039
They say it was skinned
and turned into a purse.

155
00:13:06,106 --> 00:13:08,475
Were the squirrels spayed?

156
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,380
Oh.

157
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:38,138
- Dina?!
- Coming.

158
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:41,008
I'll get the car.
We're gonna be late.

159
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:47,514
You sure you don't want
to come join us at yoga?

160
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,116
Yeah.

161
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:50,883
Would you rather we stay home?

162
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:52,419
No, it's okay. You go.

163
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,887
You need to do your body
maintenance.

164
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:57,024
Oh, honey, are you sure?

165
00:13:57,057 --> 00:14:00,027
I just want to stay
with Wiener-Dog.

166
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,861
I understand.

167
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,264
Do you have enough granola bars?

168
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:07,934
Okay.
We'll be back before lunch.

169
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:29,189
They're gone!

170
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,907
Wiener-Dog?

171
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:56,743
What's the matter?

172
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:02,315
Are you hungry?

173
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:10,056
Want my granola bar, hmm?

174
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,161
Okay.

175
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:52,064
Oh, God.
Fuck.

176
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,833
Oh!

177
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,968
You see this?
No!

178
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:58,305
No diarrhea!
No!

179
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:00,907
Christ!

180
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:03,210
What did you give her?!
What?!

181
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:05,312
Some granola bars.

182
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,914
Granola bars is not dog food.

183
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,384
It's food for humans,
and dogs are not human!

184
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:14,321
But I thought
granola was healthy.

185
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:17,224
Granola is poison!
Christ, the dog can't digest!

186
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,791
Oh, shit!

187
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:45,211
Oh, shit!

188
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,887
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

189
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:38,391
What's it like
to be put to sleep?

190
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,565
It feels good.
Like forgetting everything.

191
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:49,636
I'll never forget Wiener-Dog.

192
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:51,303
Maybe when you're older.

193
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:54,441
No.
Never.

194
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:58,445
Did Dad watch her die?

195
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,180
No.
They would never allow that.

196
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:03,049
So she was alone.

197
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:06,553
No, the vet was with her.

198
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:09,221
Where do you think
they buried her?

199
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:10,690
I don't know.

200
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:13,460
Actually,
she was probably cremated.

201
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:17,296
What's cremated?

202
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:20,166
Sort of like put in an oven.

203
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:41,253
Honey, death is a sad thing,

204
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,723
but it's a natural thing.

205
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,560
And sometimes it happens
without any reason at all.

206
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:54,133
Well, what about God?

207
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,735
We don't believe in God.

208
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:59,772
Well, what do we believe in?

209
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,677
Truth, compassion, love.

210
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:12,084
We're all going to die.

211
00:22:15,855 --> 00:22:18,525
That's why we have each other.

212
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,093
That's why we love each other.

213
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:29,401
Then death is...

214
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:31,137
a good thing?

215
00:22:54,694 --> 00:22:57,830
Yeah?
All right, hold on.

What are you doing here?

229
00:24:47,774 --> 00:24:49,676
Not much.
Passing through.

230
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,678
Huh.

231
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:57,149
You look pretty good.

232
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,384
Thanks.

233
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,252
You do, too.

234
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:05,992
- Weird.
- Yeah, I know.

235
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:12,431
I actually tried looking
you up on Facebook once.

236
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:14,934
Oh, yeah?
Why?

237
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:19,872
I don't know.
I was just surfing around and...

238
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:23,209
I don't know. Your name.

239
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:28,214
I mean, I've tried looking
up other people, too.

240
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,415
Like who?

241
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:33,619
Remember Ralphie?

242
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,822
Who?

243
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:38,124
He used to hang out with me
in, like, seventh grade.

244
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,093
Oh, is he like gay pride
or something?

245
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,729
Transgender.

246
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:44,897
Huh.

247
00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:49,035
- You used to pick on him a lot.
- Really?

248
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:52,104
- Yeah, like all the time.
- Hmm.

249
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:53,973
You even beat him up once.

250
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,376
You smashed his head
against the sidewalk.

251
00:25:57,443 --> 00:25:59,145
Remember?

252
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:02,749
It's funny how none
of that shit sticks.

253
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:04,751
Yeah.

254
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:09,055
- Well, um...
- Maybe, uh...

255
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:13,125
So, uh, do you want
to exchange e-mails or...

256
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:17,563
I don't know, maybe catch up?

257
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:19,999
We're kind of caught up now.

258
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:23,502
Yeah.

259
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:26,038
I'm sorry, but, like,
I'm really just passing through.

260
00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:28,074
That's okay.
Totally cool.

261
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:34,380
Well, take care.

262
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:35,982
Take care!

263
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:50,262
Hey. There you go.
There you go.

264
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:52,598
Good.
Yeah.

265
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:55,902
Hey there, little meaner.

266
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:59,638
Her name is Doo Dee.

267
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:03,042
You mean, like, shit?

268
00:27:05,812 --> 00:27:08,314
I got her a week or so ago.

269
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,584
She was sick,
but now she's much better.

270
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:14,053
She likes you.

271
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,222
Yeah, dogs like me.

272
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,392
She looks like you.

273
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:23,662
Thanks.

274
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,832
I'm going to Ohio tomorrow.

275
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:29,468
I leave early.

276
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:31,303
You want to come along?

277
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,642
What's in Ohio?

278
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:38,377
Crystal meth.

279
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:44,583
Okay.

280
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,853
- Joke.
- Yeah.

281
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:48,955
I-I-I know.

282
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:01,300
I miss nothing here.

297
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:41,187

kind of...

girls only, you know?

354
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:42,814
'Cause I wanted
us to get the chance

355
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:47,152
to bond and talk about things.

356
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:49,655
Tommy, Brandon.

357
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:53,659
The way sometimes he just
doesn't get me, you know?

358
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:58,464
And then his elusiveness
and intractability.

359
00:37:58,464 --> 00:38:00,165
Relationships.

360
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:04,235
Oh.

361
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:06,972
Why are you stopping, April?

362
00:38:07,038 --> 00:38:09,140
Can we go back inside?

363
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:11,176
Oh, already?

364
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:12,511
I want to go home.

365
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:15,481
Did I say something wrong?

366
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:25,090
Heads up, bitch.

367
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:26,692

00:38:26,758 --> 00:38:29,260

00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:30,696
Uh, okay.

370
00:38:30,762 --> 00:38:33,231
Okay, but let's take
a little break first.

371
00:38:33,298 --> 00:38:35,266
How long?

372
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:38,269
- 10 minutes.
- Five minutes.

373
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,905
Okay, five minutes.

374
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:42,307
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes.

375
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:45,877
- And then we play again.
- And then we'll play again.

376
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,513
Five minutes.

377
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:52,884
Uh, come on,
let's go outside.

378
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:54,820
Okay.

379
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,202
Tommy?

380
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:17,976
Yeah?

381
00:39:18,043 --> 00:39:20,445
You know how Dad
had a drinking problem?

382
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:22,447
Yeah. But he worked
real hard.

383
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:25,551
Now he doesn't drink anymore.

384
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:27,653
But then he started
drinking again.

385
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:32,157
- He did?
- Yeah.

386
00:39:32,223 --> 00:39:34,560
But he told me he stopped.

387
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,894
He stopped...

388
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:37,896
and then he started again.

389
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:42,267
Why?

390
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,770
He couldn't help himself.

391
00:39:44,836 --> 00:39:46,938
But he told me he stopped.

392
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,243
The drinking made Dad
very sick.

393
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,812
I know.

394
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,747
That's why he stopped.

395
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:01,219
He died, Tommy.

396
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:03,922
But...

397
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:07,859
I spoke to him last week.

398
00:40:07,926 --> 00:40:11,597
He spoke to you,
and then he died.

399
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:22,808
Why?

400
00:40:22,874 --> 00:40:25,844
He drank too much.

401
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:28,079
But he told me he stopped.

402
00:40:28,146 --> 00:40:29,414
He did.

403
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,449
And then he started again,

404
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,852
and he got sick and died.

405
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:36,154
But he told me he stopped.

406
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:41,459
I went looking
for Dad's family.

407
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:44,996
Tracked them down.
I thought we were his family.

408
00:40:45,063 --> 00:40:47,899
He has a brother and a sister.

409
00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:50,135
But we're his family.

410
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,906
You're right, we're his family.

411
00:40:54,973 --> 00:40:57,142
He has no brother and sister.

412
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:02,480
You're right, they were just...

413
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:03,682
names.

414
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:06,752
He had no brother and sister.

415
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:08,787
You're right.

416
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,095
So...

417
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:18,964
he died?

418
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:38,984
Did you stop doing drugs?

419
00:41:41,152 --> 00:41:43,454
Yes.

420
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:46,224
- Promise?
- Yes.

421
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,293
And you won't start
doing them again.

422
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:52,297
No.

423
00:41:52,363 --> 00:41:55,100
Promise?

424
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,502
Yes.

425
00:41:57,568 --> 00:41:59,137
No more drugs?

426
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:02,708
No more drugs.

427
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,776
Promise?

428
00:42:06,812 --> 00:42:09,815
Promise.

Wait.

433
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:39,277
She should stay here.

434
00:42:39,344 --> 00:42:41,046
She belongs here.

00:42:41,112 --> 00:42:42,881
Really?

436
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,755

Oh.

439
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:15,646
I was wondering...

440
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:20,051
what happens
if April gets pregnant?

441
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:22,353
Won't happen.
Tubes tied.

442
00:43:24,455 --> 00:43:26,224
Oh.

443
00:43:28,794 --> 00:43:31,129
And your brother?

He was taken care of also.

00:46:09,054 --> 00:46:11,556
and the Green Lantern
together in a movie.

475
00:46:11,622 --> 00:46:13,258
It's never been done.

476
00:46:13,324 --> 00:46:15,793
Yeah, it's too complicated
and expensive with the rights.

477
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,829
Marvel is extremely guarded
about its trademarks.

478
00:46:18,964 --> 00:46:20,565
So, instead,
I thought I'd come up

479
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:22,833
with my own
original superheroes,

480
00:46:22,968 --> 00:46:24,435
get the copyrighted,
and go to work.

481
00:46:24,502 --> 00:46:26,972
I mean, has a film student
ever done that for a short film?

482
00:46:27,038 --> 00:46:29,640
I don't think so.
And then...

483
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:32,010
I could create original
villains, as well.

484
00:46:32,077 --> 00:46:33,979
For instance, there's...

485
00:46:34,045 --> 00:46:36,047
There's Sticky Fingers.

486
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:37,682
I really like that name.

487
00:46:37,748 --> 00:46:41,319
And, remember, this is all
extremely confidential, please.

488
00:46:41,386 --> 00:46:43,521
So Sticky Fingers has this power

489
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:45,723
where anything he touches sticks
to his fingers.

490
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,225
It makes it really easy

491
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:49,027
for him to rob people
without their realizing it.

492
00:46:49,094 --> 00:46:52,163
Like there's a special type
of gum

493
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,431
at the end of each finger

494
00:46:53,498 --> 00:46:56,234
that can pick up
money or merchandise.

495
00:46:56,301 --> 00:46:58,503
Anyway, the police force
is at wit's end,

496
00:46:58,569 --> 00:46:59,804
the mayor of the city.

497
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,707
Sticky Fingers is on the front
page of every paper.

498
00:47:02,773 --> 00:47:04,642
But then um, uh...

499
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:06,077
Well,
this is where I have trouble.

500
00:47:06,144 --> 00:47:07,578
I mean, where do I go from here?

501
00:47:07,645 --> 00:47:09,247
I know how you're always
saying about the story,

502
00:47:09,314 --> 00:47:11,016
"what if," "then what?"

503
00:47:11,049 --> 00:47:13,584
But that's what I don't know
the answer to.

504
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:16,754
What do you think
Sticky Fingers should do?

505
00:47:26,064 --> 00:47:29,200
- Hey, Professor Schmerz.
- Have a great weekend!

506
00:47:53,058 --> 00:47:54,659
Trey Silver's office.

507
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:57,462
Hi. This is Dave Schmerz.

508
00:47:57,528 --> 00:48:00,398
I was just wondering
if you had any idea

509
00:48:00,465 --> 00:48:04,069
of when Trey might get around
to looking at the screenplay

510
00:48:04,135 --> 00:48:06,071
I sent back in November.

511
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:08,139
It was a new draft.

512
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:10,108
Oh, Dave, I'm so sorry.

513
00:48:10,175 --> 00:48:12,543
Did...
Did Trey not get back to you?

514
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,079
No, not yet.

515
00:48:14,112 --> 00:48:16,914
I sent him a bunch of e-mails,
but I haven't had any reply.

516
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:19,717
Well, he's been, like, crazy
busy these last few weeks.

517
00:48:19,784 --> 00:48:22,553
The whole agency's doing
this radical reshuffle.

518
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,190
Oh, wait, I think he's just
wrapping up his FaceTime.

519
00:48:25,256 --> 00:48:27,592
Let me see
if I can pull some magic.

520
00:48:29,427 --> 00:48:31,196
Oh. It looks like he just

521
00:48:31,262 --> 00:48:32,863
hopped on another
conference call.

522
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,900
What's the best number
I can have him reach you at?

523
00:48:35,966 --> 00:48:38,269
- My cell will be fine.
- Great.

524
00:48:38,336 --> 00:48:40,105
Then I'll let him know
you called as soon

525
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:41,806
as he gets off.

526
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:43,674
Thanks.

527
00:48:52,983 --> 00:48:55,120
Bear with me.

528
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,289
Okay, then.

529
00:48:58,356 --> 00:49:01,126
So...
how are you doing?

530
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:03,928
Great.
Great!

531
00:49:03,994 --> 00:49:05,963
Great.

532
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,965
Would you like something
to drink?

533
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:09,967
- Bottled water?
- Oh, thanks.

534
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:12,137
Thanks, I'm good.

535
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,704
Good.

536
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:15,206
So, tell us...

537
00:49:15,273 --> 00:49:17,242
why do you want
to be a filmmaker?

538
00:49:17,308 --> 00:49:20,245
Well, I've just always
wanted to be a filmmaker.

539
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:24,682
Ever since, really,
my whole life.

540
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:26,617
Well, that's great.

541
00:49:26,684 --> 00:49:29,187
Yes, but... why?

542
00:49:29,254 --> 00:49:32,923
Well, I just feel I have
so much to say.

543
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,292
Like what?

544
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:35,960
What do you have to say?

545
00:49:36,026 --> 00:49:37,695
Well, just everything.

546
00:49:37,762 --> 00:49:41,499
I mean, movies have always
been so inspiring to me.

547
00:49:41,566 --> 00:49:45,170
But tell me,
what movies have inspired you?

548
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,438
What movie or movies

549
00:49:47,505 --> 00:49:49,907
made you want
to become a filmmaker?

550
00:49:49,974 --> 00:49:51,276
Oh, gee.

551
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:53,278
Well, really,
there are just so many.

552
00:49:53,344 --> 00:49:54,879
I mean, you name it.

553
00:49:54,945 --> 00:49:57,382
Like, all... all kinds.

554
00:49:57,448 --> 00:50:00,251
- Name one, for example.
- Oh, God.

555
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:02,320
That is such a good question.

556
00:50:02,387 --> 00:50:03,888
And, I mean,
it's really hard, you know,

557
00:50:03,954 --> 00:50:06,591
because there are so many
that are just so great.

558
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:11,095
What movies have you seen
in the past few weeks

559
00:50:11,162 --> 00:50:12,597
or months?

560
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:16,267
Have you liked
any of them in particular?

561
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:19,670
The past few weeks?

562
00:50:19,737 --> 00:50:21,739
Hmm.

563
00:50:21,806 --> 00:50:24,342
Any movie
that you saw over the last year

564
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:26,877
and that you really liked.

565
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:29,514
Or made an impression.

566
00:50:33,384 --> 00:50:36,221
Yeah, I know this is
like a trick question, you know,

567
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:37,688
but there really are so many

568
00:50:37,755 --> 00:50:39,824
that I... I just
can't keep track.

569
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:42,860
Please, just name a movie.

570
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:44,929
Any movie.

571
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:49,300
Excuse me.

572
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:51,202
I have to take this.

573
00:51:01,946 --> 00:51:03,648
Hello, Schmerz here.

574
00:51:03,714 --> 00:51:06,584
I've got Trey Silver for you.

575
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:09,086
- How you doing?
- Great!

576
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:10,455
Great.

577
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:12,457
Listen, I have big news.

578
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:14,124
It's gonna sound
like bad news at first,

579
00:51:14,259 --> 00:51:17,762
but I promise you
it's good news in the end.

580
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:18,996
Uh-huh.

581
00:51:19,063 --> 00:51:20,598
I'm leaving the agency,

582
00:51:20,665 --> 00:51:22,533
and I'm moving over
to Universal

583
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,901
to be VP of production.

584
00:51:23,968 --> 00:51:26,003
I feel super sad
about leaving you,

585
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,939
but it's gonna be so much
better for you in the end

586
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:30,775
because I'll be in
a much stronger position

587
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:32,743
to help move
your projects forward.

588
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,679
Have you gotten
to read my script yet?

589
00:51:34,745 --> 00:51:37,047
No, but I wanted
to be totally focused

590
00:51:37,114 --> 00:51:40,050
on where I was first instead
of giving it a sloppy read

591
00:51:40,117 --> 00:51:42,453
while I'm in the middle
of a major job switch

592
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,355
and the phone
is ringing off the hook

593
00:51:44,422 --> 00:51:46,757
and I've got, like,
5,000 e-mails

594
00:51:46,824 --> 00:51:49,627
and Variety...
Yada, yada, yada.

595
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:51,929
So when do you think
you'll get around to reading it?

596
00:51:51,996 --> 00:51:55,165
First, I want to hand you
over to Carol Steinhardt.

597
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,369
She's super excited about
taking over as your agent,

598
00:51:58,436 --> 00:52:00,805
provided you feel
cool about that.

599
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:03,173
She's hot,
she's young, she's smart...

600
00:52:03,308 --> 00:52:04,375
Straight out of Harvard.

601
00:52:04,442 --> 00:52:06,311
She's a major up-and-comer.

602
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:07,945
You're gonna totally click.

603
00:52:08,012 --> 00:52:09,780
So Carol's gonna read it first?

604
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:13,651
Right now
I think that's your best move.

605
00:52:13,718 --> 00:52:16,621
Speaking off the record
as your friend.

606
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:18,188
I'm gonna tell her
to give you a call

607
00:52:18,323 --> 00:52:19,657
as soon as we hang up.

608
00:52:19,724 --> 00:52:21,392
Er, wait.
Kara?

609
00:52:21,459 --> 00:52:22,993
I'm here, yes.

610
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,630
See if you can get
Carol Steinhardt right now.

611
00:52:25,696 --> 00:52:26,997
Oh, okay.

612
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:28,366
Really this is the best thing

613
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:29,734
that could ever
have happened to you.

614
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,602
I'm, like, so happy for you.

615
00:52:31,669 --> 00:52:33,638
- She's on a conference call.
- Oh, okay, listen.

616
00:52:33,704 --> 00:52:35,205
It's all gonna work out great.

617
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,674
Promise.
Now I got to run.

618
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:39,344
But I'll talk to you soon,
my friend.

619
00:52:47,352 --> 00:52:48,953
You need to exercise.

620
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:54,925
I walk my dog.

621
00:52:57,094 --> 00:52:59,063
Exercise.

622
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:06,671
I can't.

623
00:53:08,506 --> 00:53:11,376
Work out.

624
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:13,378
Lose weight.

625
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,394
I can't.

626
00:53:29,394 --> 00:53:31,729
You're a ticking time bomb.

627
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:15,773
Hello?

628
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,676
- Hi, is this Dave Schmerz?
- Yes.

629
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:20,911
Please hold. I have
Carol Steinhardt for you.

630
00:54:20,978 --> 00:54:23,781
So nice to connect
with you at last, Dave.

631
00:54:23,848 --> 00:54:25,883
Things have been, like,
so crazy here at the agency.

632
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,352
But, tell me,
how are you doing?

633
00:54:28,453 --> 00:54:30,220
Well, I don't have cancer.

634
00:54:30,287 --> 00:54:33,157
Oh, gee!

635
00:54:33,223 --> 00:54:34,559
Trey warned me about you.

636
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:37,462
- So how are things going?
- Oh, my God.

637
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:39,229
You can't...
Okay, well, listen now.

638
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:40,798
Are you sitting down?

639
00:54:40,865 --> 00:54:42,266
Yeah.

640
00:54:42,332 --> 00:54:47,137
I slipped a copy of your
script over to DreamWorks.

641
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:48,606
Oh.

642
00:54:48,673 --> 00:54:50,775
So when do you think
they'll read it by?

643
00:54:50,841 --> 00:54:53,010
I should know by Monday.
I mean, really,

644
00:54:53,077 --> 00:54:55,646
they are desperate
for new material.

645
00:54:55,713 --> 00:54:58,248
- Uh, did you read it?
- Dave, are you kidding me?

646
00:54:58,315 --> 00:55:00,250
Oh, my God, it's genius!

647
00:55:00,317 --> 00:55:01,552
Hilarious!

648
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:02,920
I'm telling you, the script

649
00:55:02,987 --> 00:55:05,490
is going to be
a game changer for you.

650
00:55:05,523 --> 00:55:06,924
Oh, gee!

651
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:08,993
Because I was really worried
about the third act

652
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,629
where DooBee disguises himself
as his mother-in-law

653
00:55:11,696 --> 00:55:13,564
and the Mafia chases him
and then suddenly...

654
00:55:13,631 --> 00:55:15,032
List...
Oh, listen, Dave, honey,

655
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:16,934
that's DreamWorks
on the other line.

656
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:19,737
I'm gonna have to jump
onto that. Talk soon!

657
00:55:23,808 --> 00:55:25,175
Hey.

658
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:27,311
Dave.

659
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:29,079
Thanks for dropping by.

660
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:31,381
I got a message you wanted me
to come talk with you.

661
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:32,850
Come sit down.

662
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:36,587
Don't worry,
it's really nothing so serious.

663
00:55:36,654 --> 00:55:38,422
Can I get you something
to drink?

664
00:55:38,523 --> 00:55:40,858
Coffee?
No, I'm good.

665
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:42,827
Good.

666
00:55:42,893 --> 00:55:44,061
So...

667
00:55:44,128 --> 00:55:46,430
how are things
going with your screenplay?

668
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:48,533
Things are happening.

669
00:55:49,534 --> 00:55:51,135
Good.

670
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:52,169
Good!

671
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:56,006
Oh, I'm sorry

672
00:55:56,073 --> 00:55:59,009
that I had to drop
out of that interview

673
00:55:59,076 --> 00:56:00,444
last week, the student.

674
00:56:00,545 --> 00:56:02,547
Nah.
I understood.

675
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:04,682
Totally cool.

676
00:56:04,749 --> 00:56:06,383
Things are happening.

677
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,352
I get it.

678
00:56:08,418 --> 00:56:12,022
Listen... we have a surprise
director

679
00:56:12,089 --> 00:56:13,991
coming this evening
for the Director Series,

680
00:56:14,058 --> 00:56:17,562
and I know you're not required
to show up for these things,

681
00:56:17,562 --> 00:56:20,230
but I'd really like it
if you did,

682
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:21,899
as a favor.

683
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:25,235
I really need a good turnout.

684
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:27,605
Oh, I can show up.

685
00:56:27,672 --> 00:56:30,074
That's what you want?

686
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,241
Fill a seat?

687
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:35,079
Thanks, Dave.

688
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:43,253
Is that all?

689
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,089
Actually...

690
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:46,924
there is something else.

691
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:49,894
I've gotten a few reports,

692
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,898
e-mails from some faculty,
some students.

693
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:56,100
Who?

694
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:58,669
They're not happy
with your performance here.

695
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:01,906
What did I do wrong?

696
00:57:01,972 --> 00:57:04,208
You didn't do anything wrong.

697
00:57:04,274 --> 00:57:05,843
It's just...

698
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,646
the general consensus is...

699
00:57:08,713 --> 00:57:11,616
you're a little too negative.

700
00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:13,450
General consensus?

701
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:15,219
Well,
not everyone's complaining.

702
00:57:15,285 --> 00:57:16,453
It's...

703
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,624
just there are always a few...

704
00:57:19,657 --> 00:57:21,058
complainers.

705
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,260
So they're being negative
about me?

706
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:26,931
Look, Dave, I'm talking
to you as your friend.

707
00:57:26,997 --> 00:57:29,834
I know you're a great
teacher here.

708
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,369
I helped push
to keep you full time.

709
00:57:32,436 --> 00:57:35,372
"Celebrity Schmelebrity"
is a terrific script.

710
00:57:35,439 --> 00:57:36,841
It's a piece of shit.

711
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:44,682
I tried to do something good.

712
00:57:46,784 --> 00:57:49,119
It's... something...

713
00:57:57,662 --> 00:58:01,331
Get into my childhood.

714
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:04,534
Get into some...

715
00:58:04,669 --> 00:58:06,837
Something real.

716
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:14,544
Real stuff.

717
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:16,380
Pain.

718
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,886
Memories.

719
00:58:27,024 --> 00:58:28,693
Dreams.

720
00:58:31,696 --> 00:58:33,931
But I wanted it to be funny.

721
00:58:37,835 --> 00:58:39,737
I wanted people to like it.

722
00:58:41,706 --> 00:58:43,708
I wanted it to sell.

723
00:58:53,483 --> 00:58:58,522
So I threw in
the mixed-up identities...

724
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:03,360
I threw in the sex jokes.

725
00:59:03,427 --> 00:59:05,796
The Mafia.

726
00:59:10,835 --> 00:59:12,737
A little schtick.

727
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:18,743
Everyone loves a little schtick.

728
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:26,083
You're not tenured.

729
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,818
This is a new administration.

730
00:59:27,885 --> 00:59:29,887
Shapiro's out.

731
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:32,089
Brenner's gone.
Wienstein's gone.

732
00:59:32,156 --> 00:59:34,391
Horrowitz and Mandell, gone.

733
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:35,993
There's only so much

734
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,863
I can do if you don't put forth
a more positive attitude.

735
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:42,099
Show people
that you really care.

736
00:59:47,805 --> 00:59:49,774
Show people.

737
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,349
Thank you, thank you.

738
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:02,787
Thank you.
Oh.

739
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:04,554
The students and faculty

740
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:08,158
are all so delighted
to have you with us today.

741
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:09,960
As an alumnus,

742
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:12,596
you serve
as a real-life inspiration.

743
01:00:12,662 --> 01:00:14,965
You've shown how it is,
in fact,

744
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:19,236
possible to achieve success
after film school.

745
01:00:19,303 --> 01:00:20,337
Yes.

746
01:00:20,404 --> 01:00:23,373
But really
all I did was make a movie.

747
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,543
One movie.
Luck is such a big factor.

748
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:29,479
Yes, but talent doesn't hurt.

749
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:32,682
- Well...
- Tell me,

750
01:00:32,749 --> 01:00:36,353
how do you feel about
your film school experience?

751
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,521
I mean,

752
01:00:37,587 --> 01:00:40,357
how did it prepare you
for the real world?

753
01:00:40,424 --> 01:00:43,427
Nothing can prepare you
for the real world.

754
01:00:43,493 --> 01:00:46,931
Yes,
but what would you advise

755
01:00:46,997 --> 01:00:50,634
the students here
today who want to make movies,

756
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,469
be like you?

757
01:00:52,536 --> 01:00:53,838
My advice?

758
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:55,072
Drop out.

759
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:57,842
Drop out and make a movie.

760
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:00,544
You learn by doing.

761
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,847
Class time is a waste.

762
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:04,181
But, really,

763
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:06,917
are you saying
you learned nothing here?

764
01:01:06,984 --> 01:01:09,753
Maybe some storytelling
techniques,

765
01:01:09,854 --> 01:01:11,688
screenwriting approaches?

766
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:14,224
What if? Then what?

767
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:23,100
I mean, no offense, but...

768
01:01:24,334 --> 01:01:25,302
Shit.

769
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:27,771
Is Schmerz
still teaching here?

770
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,595
You have reached
the office of Carol Steinhardt.

771
01:01:51,661 --> 01:01:53,898
Our office hours are Monday
through Friday,

772
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:55,799
9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

773
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,303
Please leave a message telling
us your name, phone number,

774
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:02,372
and purpose for calling
at the sound of the beep.

775
01:02:02,439 --> 01:02:03,707
Thank you.

776
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,678
Carol...

777
01:02:08,745 --> 01:02:10,547
it's Dave Schmerz.

778
01:02:16,954 --> 01:02:19,223
I love you.

779
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:36,400
Go on, I'm listening.

780
01:03:36,466 --> 01:03:38,902
Well, the thing is
I just don't understand

781
01:03:39,003 --> 01:03:40,870
why I can't write
a script about identity.

782
01:03:41,005 --> 01:03:42,439
What about identity?

783
01:03:42,506 --> 01:03:44,441
I mean, identity
in terms of gender.

784
01:03:44,508 --> 01:03:46,076
Its fluidity.

785
01:03:46,143 --> 01:03:47,911
I've been wanting
to apply '90s queer theory

786
01:03:48,012 --> 01:03:49,379
from a race perspective,
as well,

787
01:03:49,446 --> 01:03:51,581
but after reading
"Epistemology of the Closet,"

788
01:03:51,648 --> 01:03:53,017
I'm just not sure

789
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:56,286
how to go about the problem
of cohesion and structure.

790
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,794
Look...

791
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:07,031
you know what I'm gonna say.

792
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:10,100
You got to have a "what if."

793
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:12,236
Simple as that.

794
01:04:12,302 --> 01:04:15,139
What if you got locked
out of your house?

795
01:04:15,205 --> 01:04:17,041
What if your girlfriend
cheated on you?

796
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:19,043
What if you won the lottery?

797
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:22,346
Then you would have a story.

798
01:04:22,412 --> 01:04:27,051
Then you would be in business.

799
01:04:27,084 --> 01:04:29,419
- I don't know.
- I know.

800
01:04:32,322 --> 01:04:35,225
Thanks for your time,
Professor Schmerz.

801
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:01,085
Hey, Zeno...

802
01:05:01,118 --> 01:05:03,587
how'd it go with Schmerz?

803
01:05:03,653 --> 01:05:06,556
I'm dropping out.

804
01:05:06,623 --> 01:05:08,925
What did he say?

805
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,260
What if.

806
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:12,562
Fuck that shit.
I mean, like,

807
01:05:12,629 --> 01:05:14,964
what if you taught
script writing at a film school

808
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:16,600
and had no fucking talent?

809
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,269
What if you wrote,
like, one movie 19 years ago

810
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:20,604
and it was a piece of shit?

811
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:22,939
What if you had
incurable halitosis?

812
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,608
At least he's got an agent.

813
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:26,643
Big fuck.
My ex-boyfriend's an agent.

814
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:28,712
The school
should get rid of him.

815
01:05:28,778 --> 01:05:32,616
It's just somehow everything
he suggests seems totally lame.

816
01:05:33,683 --> 01:05:35,452
Like, it's all shtick.

817
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:36,753
He's probably got, like,

818
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,123
the box set
to "Curb Your Enthusiasm."

819
01:05:39,189 --> 01:05:41,358
- Or "Seinfeld."
- Or Woody Allen.

820
01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:43,493
He's such a homophobe.

821
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,162
He's an idiot,
and he's old.

822
01:05:45,229 --> 01:05:47,197
He's a dinosaur.

823
01:05:58,808 --> 01:06:01,178
Look, I read your script.
It's good.

824
01:06:01,245 --> 01:06:04,214
It's transgressive.

825
01:06:04,281 --> 01:06:06,616
- Thanks.
- I want to start a petition.

826
01:06:06,683 --> 01:06:08,352
I already talked to Phillips
about it...

827
01:06:08,418 --> 01:06:10,220
My uncle's on the board.

828
01:06:10,287 --> 01:06:11,955
I'm just,
like, done with this shit.

829
01:06:12,021 --> 01:06:13,657
He's so out of here.

830
01:06:13,723 --> 01:06:16,693
- Yeah, but, like, what if...
- What if what?

831
01:06:25,802 --> 01:06:28,772
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

832
01:07:49,118 --> 01:07:51,255
I.D.?

833
01:08:18,147 --> 01:08:20,450
Are you David Schmerz?

834
01:08:23,287 --> 01:08:25,322
What if I am?

835
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,458
Then what?

836
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:05,094
You did what?

837
01:09:05,161 --> 01:09:06,496
Cheese!

838
01:09:33,357 --> 01:09:35,124
Hi, Nana, it's Zoe.

839
01:09:35,191 --> 01:09:37,927
Um, listen, I'm just
running a little bit late,

840
01:09:37,994 --> 01:09:40,697
but I should definitely
be there in, like, in 20...

841
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:42,632
20, 30 minutes tops, okay?

842
01:09:42,699 --> 01:09:45,369
And I'll...
I'll see you soon, okay?

843
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:47,404
Okay, I love you.

844
01:10:09,393 --> 01:10:11,728
This way. This way.

845
01:10:15,131 --> 01:10:17,200
Yvette! Hi!

846
01:10:17,266 --> 01:10:20,670
Hi.

847
01:10:20,737 --> 01:10:22,872
Nana!
I'm sorry I'm late.

848
01:10:22,939 --> 01:10:26,676
Just the traffic
and now with that new highway...

849
01:10:26,743 --> 01:10:28,912
Hi.

850
01:10:28,978 --> 01:10:31,681
Oh, let me introduce you.
This is Fantasy.

851
01:10:31,748 --> 01:10:32,882
Hey.

852
01:10:32,949 --> 01:10:34,784
That's his actual name.
He's, um...

853
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:37,220
He's got a sister called Dream.

854
01:10:37,286 --> 01:10:40,089
So...

855
01:10:40,156 --> 01:10:41,925
Yvette!

856
01:10:49,265 --> 01:10:51,067
Kaopectate.

857
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:05,849
You look really good.

858
01:11:05,915 --> 01:11:07,884
Huh?

859
01:11:07,951 --> 01:11:09,986
I said you're
looking really good.

860
01:11:10,053 --> 01:11:11,488
I heard you.

861
01:11:13,557 --> 01:11:16,460
Fantasy is an artist.

862
01:11:16,493 --> 01:11:17,694
Like Picasso.

863
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:19,463
He was just in this group show,

864
01:11:19,529 --> 01:11:21,998
and it got mentioned in
"Artforum" 30 Under 30.

865
01:11:22,065 --> 01:11:26,903
And he was a finalist
for a Guggenheim last year.

866
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,538
Oh, I got robbed.

867
01:11:28,605 --> 01:11:30,139
You know,
Nana used to do some painting

868
01:11:30,206 --> 01:11:31,808
when she was young.
Didn't you, Nana?

869
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:35,512
I posed nude
and spread my legs.

870
01:11:36,546 --> 01:11:38,047
That's cool.

871
01:11:39,483 --> 01:11:41,350
Yeah, Fantasy is actually, um,

872
01:11:41,485 --> 01:11:43,853
he's involved
in installation work.

873
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,923
Not... Not type specific,
but more like mixed media.

874
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:49,993
And, um, he actually
finds these dead animals,

875
01:11:50,059 --> 01:11:51,394
and he embalms them,

876
01:11:51,495 --> 01:11:52,996
and then he sort of
roboticizes them

877
01:11:53,062 --> 01:11:56,132
into these, like,
audio sculptural sort of...

878
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:59,368
- I'm interested in mortality.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

879
01:11:59,503 --> 01:12:00,804
I mean his work is...

880
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:03,039
very exploratory,
very controversial.

881
01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:04,841
And you might be thinking
that it's sort of

882
01:12:04,908 --> 01:12:06,710
like a Damien Hirst derivative,
but it's...

883
01:12:06,776 --> 01:12:09,378
Fuck that derivative shit!

884
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:13,182
But it... But it...
But his work is...

885
01:12:13,249 --> 01:12:16,720
Motherfuckers.

886
01:12:16,786 --> 01:12:20,023
His work is actually
very, um...

887
01:12:20,089 --> 01:12:24,528
you know, social welfare,
income gap, inequality oriented.

888
01:12:24,528 --> 01:12:26,229
Fuck Damien Hirst!

889
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:13,577
Thanks.

890
01:13:23,787 --> 01:13:26,623
I think it's really great
that you got a new dog,

891
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:28,124
and it's so cute!

892
01:13:28,191 --> 01:13:31,460
I mean, I think that everyone
should have a pet.

893
01:13:31,595 --> 01:13:33,496
What's its name?

894
01:13:33,597 --> 01:13:35,599
Cancer.

895
01:13:38,868 --> 01:13:42,038
Wait, wait, um...
Why would...

896
01:13:42,105 --> 01:13:44,207
you name it that?

897
01:13:44,273 --> 01:13:46,610
It felt right.

898
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:49,445
Wait...

899
01:13:49,512 --> 01:13:51,180
Nana, are y... are you?

900
01:13:51,247 --> 01:13:53,382
Everyone's dying.

901
01:13:53,449 --> 01:13:55,018
- I'm going outside.
- Here.

902
01:13:55,084 --> 01:13:58,187
Take Cancer with you.
She has to go.

903
01:14:11,901 --> 01:14:14,638
Um, there's all of
this traffic now,

904
01:14:14,638 --> 01:14:16,640
and it used to be so quiet here

905
01:14:16,673 --> 01:14:18,174
and peaceful and...

906
01:14:18,241 --> 01:14:20,777
sound of bird calls.

907
01:14:27,516 --> 01:14:29,986
Do you ever think about moving?

908
01:14:30,053 --> 01:14:31,454
No.

909
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,222
But the highway...

910
01:14:38,194 --> 01:14:39,663
Oh, um...

911
01:14:39,663 --> 01:14:42,065
I got you a little present.

912
01:14:44,133 --> 01:14:46,569
What for?

913
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:49,305
I just thought, you know...

914
01:14:49,372 --> 01:14:51,374
crazy, spur of the moment.

915
01:14:54,678 --> 01:14:56,112
Here, open it.

916
01:14:56,179 --> 01:14:59,115
You open it.

917
01:14:59,182 --> 01:15:00,984
Yeah, okay.

918
01:15:04,153 --> 01:15:05,588
It's, um...

919
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:07,691
It's an ostrich egg.

920
01:15:10,126 --> 01:15:11,394
It's... It's...

921
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,397
It's supposed to be
like a delicacy in South Africa.

922
01:15:14,463 --> 01:15:19,035
People worship it there,
and you can fry it or poach it

923
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:22,972
or scramble it or,
you know, pickle it or...

924
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:24,007
Yvette?

925
01:15:40,757 --> 01:15:42,625
Just be super careful
with it, Yvette.

926
01:15:42,726 --> 01:15:44,493
It's just really delicate.

927
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:12,455
I got a part in a movie.

928
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:13,757
It's a speaking part.

929
01:16:13,757 --> 01:16:16,993
Um, I play...

930
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:19,896
a crack whore,
but it's very emotional,

931
01:16:19,963 --> 01:16:21,430
super tender.

932
01:16:21,497 --> 01:16:23,266
Very tender.

933
01:16:23,332 --> 01:16:25,268
And it's two scenes.

934
01:16:32,675 --> 01:16:36,212
Nana, I know that I haven't been
to visit you in a while.

935
01:16:36,279 --> 01:16:39,182
When was the last time
you came by?

936
01:16:39,248 --> 01:16:42,518
I don't know.

937
01:16:42,585 --> 01:16:44,353
Three years.

938
01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:49,959
Four.

939
01:16:50,026 --> 01:16:52,228
How much do you need this time?

940
01:16:56,565 --> 01:16:58,334
10,000.

941
01:17:00,804 --> 01:17:02,972
But it's not 'cause of drugs.

942
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:05,174
It's just this could be such
a big deal for Fantasy.

943
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:08,711
You know, in this moment
of his career and he's...

944
01:17:08,812 --> 01:17:11,614
You know, he's worked so hard
and he's so sensitive inside.

945
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,917
And it's...
It's for a really,

946
01:17:13,983 --> 01:17:16,052
really good cause.

947
01:17:46,615 --> 01:17:49,252
How's your dad?

948
01:17:49,318 --> 01:17:50,920
He's in...

949
01:17:50,987 --> 01:17:53,556
California, I think.

950
01:17:55,859 --> 01:17:59,328
When was the last time
you saw him?

951
01:17:59,395 --> 01:18:00,997
We don't speak.

952
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:08,071
- When are you getting married?
- I don't know.

953
01:18:08,137 --> 01:18:10,039
Um...
You know,

954
01:18:10,106 --> 01:18:13,742
there's just so much stuff
going on right now, and...

955
01:18:13,877 --> 01:18:16,012
Fantasy and I are kind
of just taking things easy,

956
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:18,547
you know,
'cause there's no rush, like...

957
01:18:18,614 --> 01:18:20,516
I mean, I'm still young, so...

958
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:22,251
Don't kid yourself.

959
01:18:27,623 --> 01:18:28,992
Um, you just...

960
01:18:29,058 --> 01:18:31,594
You just forgot to fill out
the amount.

961
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:32,962
No, you fill it out.

962
01:18:33,029 --> 01:18:35,131
I'm no good with numbers.

963
01:18:45,942 --> 01:18:47,911
I'm worried that...

964
01:18:51,447 --> 01:18:55,952
I'm worried that Fantasy
isn't faithful to me.

965
01:19:06,362 --> 01:19:09,132
Yo, Zoe!

966
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:11,634
That's him.
I got to go.

967
01:19:17,006 --> 01:19:19,008
Bye, Nana!
We'll be back soon.

968
01:19:19,075 --> 01:19:21,277
Thank you!

969
01:20:16,732 --> 01:20:19,068
What happened to you?

970
01:20:20,836 --> 01:20:22,571
I got old.

971
01:20:22,638 --> 01:20:26,242
- I don't want to be old.
- Don't worry.

972
01:20:26,309 --> 01:20:29,512
It will happen so fast,
you won't even know it happened.

973
01:20:32,048 --> 01:20:35,985
Do I have to get wrinkles?

974
01:20:36,052 --> 01:20:37,886
They're not so bad.

975
01:20:37,953 --> 01:20:40,923
Yes, they are.

976
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:42,992
Well, you can always
have work done.

977
01:20:43,059 --> 01:20:46,629
You mean Botox?

978
01:20:51,767 --> 01:20:53,502
Who are all these children?

979
01:20:53,569 --> 01:20:55,104
You.

980
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:57,206
They're all you.

981
01:20:57,273 --> 01:20:59,375
All the different lives
you could have had

982
01:20:59,442 --> 01:21:02,078
if you hadn't chosen
the life you chose.

983
01:21:02,145 --> 01:21:03,779
But I didn't choose.

984
01:21:03,846 --> 01:21:08,151
That's you if you had
continued studying art.

985
01:21:08,217 --> 01:21:12,488
And that's you if you had
married your true love.

986
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:16,392
And that's you
if you had forgiven your mother.

987
01:21:16,459 --> 01:21:20,963
So many years
you never got to know.

988
01:21:21,064 --> 01:21:23,866
- Hello.
- Hello.

989
01:21:23,932 --> 01:21:26,502
- Hello.
- Hello.

990
01:21:26,569 --> 01:21:27,736
And that's you

991
01:21:27,803 --> 01:21:30,139
if you'd shown kindness
to your daughter.

992
01:21:30,206 --> 01:21:31,707
And that's you

993
01:21:31,774 --> 01:21:35,144
if you'd learned
to overlook others' flaws.

994
01:21:35,211 --> 01:21:39,648
And you if you hadn't
given up on life.

995
01:21:39,715 --> 01:21:40,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

996
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:44,853
- Hello.
- Hello. Hello.

997
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:48,591
And here's you if you'd ever
liked other people.

998
01:21:48,657 --> 01:21:52,295
And you
if you'd ever liked yourself.

999
01:21:52,361 --> 01:21:55,498
You if you left bigger tips.

1000
01:21:55,564 --> 01:21:57,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

1001
01:21:57,866 --> 01:21:59,535
- Hello.
- Hello.

1002
01:21:59,602 --> 01:22:03,172
And now it's time
to say good-bye.

1003
01:22:03,239 --> 01:22:05,608
- No.
- But you have to.

1004
01:22:05,674 --> 01:22:08,544
- You have to.
- You have to.

1005
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:09,978
No!

1006
01:22:10,113 --> 01:22:13,916
- Everything has a beginning.
- And everything has an end.

1007
01:22:13,982 --> 01:22:17,120
No! No!

1008
01:22:17,153 --> 01:22:19,488
No! N...

1009
01:22:34,437 --> 01:22:36,605
Cancer?

1010
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:39,408
Cancer?

1011
01:22:47,183 --> 01:22:48,517
Cancer?

1012
01:22:52,521 --> 01:22:53,856
