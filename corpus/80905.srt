1
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,771
Give me a hand over here!

2
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:36,607
All right.

3
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:58,163
Right!
load her up in the back!

4
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:16,408
Damn!

5
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:37,357
Hello, Doris.

6
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:42,437
Want to do me a favor?
Help me load the next order?

7
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,403
You're no lady, Doris.

8
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:49,410
Far from it.

9
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:58,540
Good morning, boys and girls.

10
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,913
Did we all remember to bring
our homework assignments today?

11
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,216
We didn't?

12
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,351
Well, we know what happens...

13
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,759
to little boys and girls
who don't do their homework.

14
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,620
Okay, class is over.

15
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,527
Did you hear me?
Class is over!

16
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,861
Okay.

17
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:55,335
I'm just gonna have to
make another example.

18
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:14,514
Surprise, surprise.

19
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,922
I know you're there, Warwick.

20
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:19,688
You know something? You just
saved me a trip to your office.

21
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:22,595
I may be desperate for work,
but I'm not desperate enough to--

22
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:41,002
Everything's set down here!

23
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:02,950
let her rip!

24
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:46,135
Goddamn!

25
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:50,036
Adios, motherfuckers!

26
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,818
Excuse us, please.

27
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:14,832
Thanks.

28
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:20,569
Wouldn't mind having his boots
resting under my bed.

29
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:23,607
One more pair of boots,
you're gonna have to open a boot shop.

30
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:26,235
Anyway, he's married.

31
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:33,480
Daisy May, more coffee.

32
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:43,156
Daisy May,
let's make us a baby doggie style.

33
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,992
They found him in pieces.
The rats--

34
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,233
The little cannibals were all over
him. It was really unbelievable.

35
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:01,975
What you got in the bag, pal?

36
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:06,212
Not very friendly,
is he, Stevenson?

37
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:22,794
I bet his mommy packs his lunch.

38
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:25,165
Peanut butter and jelly.

39
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:27,170
Without the crust.

40
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:30,332
looks like a Boy Scout to me.

41
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,342
Maybe a Girl Scout.

42
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:36,744
See ya around, Girl Scout.

43
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:39,044
You ought to see who
they're hiring for the new mill.

44
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:41,085
She is one cute little chick.

45
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:43,950
...<i>accidental death</i>
<i>at Bachman Textile</i>...

46
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:46,455
<i>has opened the restored mill</i>
<i>to a series of investigations</i>...

47
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:48,389
<i>and probable lawsuits</i>.

48
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,427
<i>Jason Reed had been working</i>
<i>the night shift</i>...

49
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:53,692
<i>when the mysterious</i>
<i>accidents occurred</i>.

50
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:04,134
- Good morning, Mr. Warwick.
- Hello.

51
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,184
Oh, God, this is bad.

52
00:12:25,263 --> 00:12:27,128
Extreme safety hazard.

53
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,558
Exterminator's working
around the clock.

54
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:34,833
He's tired.

55
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:38,034
- Needs more time.
- There's already been one accident.

56
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:41,636
This place has to be cleared before
another worker steps in this death trap.

57
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:44,279
Damn!

58
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,348
July 4th holiday.

59
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:59,186
I'll organize a cleanup.

60
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:03,528
I'll hold onto this till then.

61
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,403
I'll be back.

62
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:16,744
To be honest, I don't think
you'll find a crew that'd work it.

63
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:20,279
Not down here.

64
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,182
We'll see.

65
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:49,071
Come shower with me.
You can save water.

66
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:02,823
This'll work out just fine.

67
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:10,225
- See you later.
- Bye.

68
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:14,104
Morning.

69
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,670
Good morning.

70
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:21,974
Take coffee...

71
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:23,320
- Mr.--
- Hall. No, thanks. I'll pass.

72
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,379
- Mr.--
- Hall. No, thanks. I'll pass.

73
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,926
Me too.

74
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,021
Can't be more than
an instant enema by now.

75
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,599
You here by car or by thumb?

76
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,369
By Greyhound.

77
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:47,876
I see you got
a real problem staying put.

78
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,436
lots of movement
over the past five years.

79
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,448
Starts down in Florida.

80
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,952
Jumps all the way up the map.
Are you on the run, friend?

81
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,946
I'm here for a fresh start.

82
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,192
College boy.

83
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:07,560
No, that's not the problem.

84
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:11,067
With all due respect, what is?

85
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,200
Fair enough.

86
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:19,636
Putting it plainly, Mr. Hall,
you're a drifter.

87
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,736
And I get no guarantees
with a drifter.

88
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:25,441
You get no guarantees
with any man.

89
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:26,813
There's only instinct.

90
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,355
You spent some time
at Munson Textile.

91
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,288
- You ever run the picker?
- I know how.

92
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:40,728
Then you also know
it's a one-man operation.

93
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:43,892
This mill depends on that machine.

94
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,902
And what's left of Gates Falls
depends on this mill.

95
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:51,839
Now, we don't do better
than minimum to start.

96
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:56,401
Four weeks before the union
comes knocking at your door.

97
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:01,075
- You still interested?
- Sounds fair to start.

98
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:02,550
All right, then.

99
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:05,611
That's it, except for the hours.

100
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:08,715
Because of the heat, we only
run that sucker through the night.

101
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,518
1 1 :00 to 7:00.

102
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:15,696
The graveyard shift.

103
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,451
Spread the word, fucker.

104
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:42,186
Mice.

105
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,853
Damn, that's good shootin'.

106
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,451
Tucker Cleveland,
Martial Extermination.

107
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:04,832
John Hall.

108
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:09,065
looking like one of your buddies got
a little too close to the blower.

109
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:12,370
Shoot, I'd like to know how many
of them Beantown execs...

110
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,275
are wearing one of your
rat-lined overcoats.

111
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,644
No, thanks.

112
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:22,708
Gave that up with the wife.

113
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,084
Should miss her as much.

114
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:28,352
- You work late hours.
- I got no choice.

115
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:31,155
Yellow Pages--
thick with competitors.

116
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,330
Why, I don't mind telling you...

117
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:39,892
this place is infested.

118
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:43,232
That might be
the understatement of the year.

119
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,741
The schmuck you work for
don't want to hear that.

120
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,403
Afraid of what
it's gonna cost the mill.

121
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:52,107
Thinks a little tracking poison
will do the trick.

122
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,247
I've been dealing with these things
for more than 20 years...

123
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,416
and we ain't talking about
no candy-ass field mice.

124
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,325
These sons of bitches piss
on tracking poison.

125
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:08,387
They piss on it to warn
their little fucker friends.

126
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:10,756
Take it from me.

127
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:14,395
There's only one way
to deal with their kind.

128
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:24,842
On their own terms.

129
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:28,931
Yeah.

130
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:32,304
I first met up with them
back in...

131
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,502
Con Thien myself.

132
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,948
Big as puppies,
and they had no fear.

133
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:43,577
Not of death, nothing.
like the Cong.

134
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:47,885
And I ain't one of them
burnin' baby flashback fuckups...

135
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:50,289
you see Bruce Dern playing,
so quit your grinning.

136
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:53,888
Anyways...

137
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,399
the conditions, being what they were
back then, we had little choice.

138
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:04,803
We shared the land...

139
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:07,308
we shared our food
with the fuckers...

140
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:10,141
and they turn around,
stabbing us in the back...

141
00:21:10,213 --> 00:21:12,408
by going to work for the VC.

142
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,574
That's right.

143
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:17,745
'Cause the VC...

144
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:20,813
would reward them with a hot meal.

145
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:24,222
Now...

146
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:28,253
do you have any idea
what a VC rat eats?

147
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:37,104
Try raw American...

148
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:39,767
hold the mayo, thank you.

149
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,912
The Cong...

150
00:21:45,982 --> 00:21:50,214
had a way of serving up a meal...

151
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:52,948
real nice and fancy.

152
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:59,284
They'd stake one of our boys
to the ground...

153
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:02,456
through his hands,
through his feet.

154
00:22:02,532 --> 00:22:06,662
They'd stake him like Jesus.

155
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:09,862
And then...

156
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:15,936
they'd make a cut
just above the abdomen.

157
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:19,004
Now, this wasn't a fatal cut.

158
00:22:19,082 --> 00:22:21,983
This was merely an entry wound.

159
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:28,254
Then, they'd get a rat.

160
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:31,760
A real hungry rat.

161
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:34,854
One that hadn't been feeding
for about a week.

162
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,866
And they'd put it on the wound...

163
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:42,894
and they'd stick its nose
down inside.

164
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:46,772
And if the damn thing
wasn't starving enough...

165
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:49,710
they'd cover it
with a flaming rice bowl...

166
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,804
and let me tell you...

167
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:55,339
that gray-black son of a bitch...

168
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:59,115
would have nowhere else
to go but inside.

169
00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:02,647
And he'd start to tunnel
his way through...

170
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:06,217
looking to put an end
to that loud beating sound.

171
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:10,130
like a human artichoke.

172
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,727
So warm, so juicy.

173
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:19,673
Yeah.

174
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:23,268
So...

175
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:28,808
maybe I'm a little prejudiced.

176
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:37,556
Did anybody call break?

177
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:40,562
Ain't no laughing
on company hours.

178
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:46,226
looks like you just
bought yourself a shift...

179
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:48,236
scrubbing the latrines.

180
00:23:53,443 --> 00:23:55,934
Shit.
I should be downstairs...

181
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:58,674
humiliating the college boy
by now.

182
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:03,143
Bravo, Ippeston.
Bravo.

183
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:06,450
Now we can get you
that audition on <i>Star Search</i>.

184
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:08,649
Come here, boy.

185
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:18,325
We've got commitments to our
New York sales office on Wednesday.

186
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,374
Are we on schedule?

187
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:30,310
- Yes, Mr. Warwick.
- Fetch me your work order, boy.

188
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:49,229
- Evening.
- Evening.

189
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:51,597
How are you tonight, darling?

190
00:24:52,835 --> 00:24:54,598
We're on time.

191
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:58,366
In fact, we're slightly ahead.

192
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:04,038
No, I'm asking about you,Jane.
How are you?

193
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:08,583
Managing. Thanks.

194
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:11,553
Well, you look tired.

195
00:25:13,022 --> 00:25:16,753
like you're losing too much
of your beauty sleep or something.

196
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:19,056
The night shift will
do that to you.

197
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:28,603
No special deals.
I'm here, I'm doing a job.

198
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:30,969
You got a problem with that,
you can talk to the union.

199
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,304
Who said anything about a deal?

200
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:37,437
I'm talking about a promotion.

201
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:41,906
A cool office.
A desk.

202
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:50,415
This cleanup ain't gonna be
pretty, darling.

203
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:55,092
I got Stevenson down there now
stringing the lights.

204
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:57,758
He's pissing and moaning
about the heat.

205
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:01,295
- And it's gonna get hotter.
- I can handle it.

206
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:04,465
It's double pay.
So back off, man.

207
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,633
Why don't you wisen up,
for Christ sakes?

208
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:07,607
like Nardello?

209
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:14,610
I'm gonna see you
down in the basement.

210
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:51,653
There ain't no way they're gonna
get this place settled in a week.

211
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,019
Goddamn rats!

212
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:03,896
This is bullshit.
A whole bunch of bullshit.

213
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:09,237
Brogan?

214
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,768
Hey, you porker.
Is that you?

215
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:19,308
Shit.

216
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:20,849
Very funny!

217
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:23,112
I'm laughing my ass off!

218
00:27:24,487 --> 00:27:26,322
Hey, how about picking up a--

219
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:29,086
Oh, damn.

220
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,226
Brogan?

221
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:41,901
Brogan?

222
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,168
Brogan?

223
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:18,130
- What about Stevenson?
- Well, all I know is...

224
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:21,301
Stevenson left in the middle
of a job and didn't pick up his pay.

225
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:23,971
Well, looky who's here.

226
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:28,111
- Still alive.
- Now.

227
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,287
- How are you doing?
- All right.

228
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:35,721
- Want some coffee?
- Please. Coffee and toast.

229
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:42,095
We got you a little something
to nibble on.

230
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,526
Enjoy.

231
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:56,874
Special order for the commander
of the rat patrol.

232
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,692
Bastards.

233
00:29:35,718 --> 00:29:37,083
Do you need a lift?

234
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:05,471
Hi, sweetheart.

235
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:09,547
You don't want to be doing that
in broad daylight.

236
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,779
Then let's do it in the dark.

237
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,719
Mr. Warwick?

238
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,623
Who wants to know?

239
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:21,424
I'm Charlie Carmichael. I hear
you're looking for a few good men.

240
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:23,692
Yeah.

241
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:27,395
A few. Come this way.

242
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:30,795
I'll talk to you later
about that thing.

243
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,909
Nice meeting you, ma'am.

244
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:44,284
Those guys are assholes, man.

245
00:30:44,353 --> 00:30:45,718
Every town has 'em.

246
00:30:45,788 --> 00:30:48,188
That's a depressing thought.

247
00:30:48,257 --> 00:30:50,657
- What town are you from?
- Wheeling.

248
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:53,456
West Virginia?
That's nice.

249
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,296
How about you? Have you
lived here your whole life?

250
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:02,269
No way.
I'm from Castle Rock.

251
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:06,603
Castle Rock. That sounds
very Norman Rockwell.

252
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:09,439
No. It's just Castle Rock.

253
00:31:19,688 --> 00:31:22,919
So, I'll see you around.

254
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:24,959
You're on the basement
cleanup crew, no doubt.

255
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:28,427
- Not that I know of.
- Oh, you will be.

256
00:31:28,497 --> 00:31:32,263
If I know Warwick, and I know
Warwick, you're a prime candidate.

257
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:36,701
Bet your wife ain't too thrilled.

258
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:39,764
losing you through
the night and all.

259
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:42,242
We gotta do what we gotta do,
right?

260
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:47,206
- My wife's dead.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

261
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:52,648
Thank you for the ride.

262
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:54,245
Take care.

263
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:28,522
Keep the lights as high up
to the ceiling as possible.

264
00:32:31,393 --> 00:32:35,159
Get a water vac in here tomorrow,
mop this shit up.

265
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,527
Welcome aboard.

266
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:38,955
Bit jumpy, aren't you, kid?

267
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:45,064
Not to worry.
The rats don't bite.

268
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:53,102
- Mr. Warwick?
- Yeah?

269
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:55,302
What did happen to the fella
that started this job?

270
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:57,709
What happened?

271
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,337
He didn't work out.

272
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:21,331
He needs this typed right away.

273
00:34:21,403 --> 00:34:23,564
- What is it?
- Cleanup crew.

274
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,335
looks like you made the list,
Nardello.

275
00:34:35,423 --> 00:34:37,618
Basement cleanup?

276
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:41,553
Clean up this, Warwick!

277
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,458
What the fuck is she doing?

278
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:49,868
Where's Warwick?

279
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:51,565
He's right there.

280
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,632
He's gonna be wicked pissed.

281
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:14,695
How can you do this to me?

282
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,663
like it rough,
don't you, Nardello? Huh?

283
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:22,328
You can't put me down there.
You can't put anybody down there.

284
00:35:22,404 --> 00:35:23,632
I know things.

285
00:35:24,673 --> 00:35:27,301
What are you talking about?

286
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:30,510
Now, you better watch
what you're saying.

287
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,944
I don't think so.

288
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:35,244
I think from now on,
you better watch what you're saying.

289
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:55,269
Come on.
I'll take you home.

290
00:35:57,339 --> 00:35:59,034
All right.

291
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:02,634
Show's over.

292
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:13,019
Everybody go back to doing
what you were doing.

293
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:55,914
Sorry.
I thought you were a rat.

294
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:57,508
You're not the first.

295
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,784
Mr. Hall...

296
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:06,827
I wanted to drop in
and thank you.

297
00:39:06,895 --> 00:39:10,262
Sorry about that situation
with Nardello.

298
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:13,926
Tempers flared.

299
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:17,165
All it was, a big misunderstanding.
You know how it is.

300
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:25,139
Anyway,
as a show of gratitude...

301
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:28,205
I want to offer you the chance
to earn some extra cash.

302
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:34,114
Next week's
the July 4th holiday.

303
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:36,589
The mill's shut down.

304
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:39,126
That means vacation week
for most of our people...

305
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:41,992
thems with union.

306
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:44,531
layoff week for the rest.

307
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,836
But there is work available
for a select few.

308
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:54,768
We got that there cleanup thing
going on down in the basement.

309
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:59,007
Regular graveyard-shift hours,
and I'm hand-picking the crew.

310
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,339
Now...

311
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,919
to tell you the truth...

312
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:10,323
I've watched you work...

313
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:13,923
and I like your style.

314
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:18,697
Gonna be a mess,
no doubt about it.

315
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:23,726
That bastard ain't been touched
since Christ was a kid.

316
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:25,739
But it's for double pay.

317
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:31,870
Now, you tell me
if an educated guy like you...

318
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:34,312
can't use double pay.

319
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:51,898
Thank you, Mr. Warwick.

320
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,660
You're so welcome, Mr. Hall.

321
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:04,139
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

322
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,409
Hey, Commander.

323
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:10,417
Hey, rat man.

324
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:14,587
You must feel awful special.

325
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:17,181
You're gonna be down in the shit pit
with the rest of us.

326
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:20,056
Yeah.
I bet he likes your style.

327
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,427
Wait a minute.
He said he liked my style.

328
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:31,145
- What's going on?
- Guess who finally made cleanup crew?

329
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:36,411
Congratulations.

330
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:41,418
Want to get out of here?

331
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:45,225
Yeah.

332
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:55,268
Thanks.

333
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,587
- You were hungry.
- Yeah, for decent food.

334
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:18,553
It's been a while.

335
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:20,594
I worked a spell
as a short-order cook.

336
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:22,458
In Miami.

337
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,191
Mostly burgers.

338
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:28,394
So I want to hear
the rest of your story.

339
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:30,528
You got married...

340
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:33,096
left Castle Rock
against your father's advice.

341
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:36,610
Yeah.
Why are dads always right?

342
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:39,607
I don't know.

343
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:47,545
Anyway...

344
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,481
it wasn't too long
after my divorce...

345
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:53,459
Warwick came sniffing around.

346
00:42:54,996 --> 00:42:57,294
He said he wanted to help.
He felt bad.

347
00:42:57,365 --> 00:43:00,163
So he offered me a promotion
to office manager...

348
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:04,361
to ease my emotional
as well as financial burdens.

349
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:07,764
All I'd have to do in return
is perform a couple days a week...

350
00:43:07,842 --> 00:43:10,504
on the couch in his office.

351
00:43:10,578 --> 00:43:13,308
He even had 'em picked out.

352
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:17,715
Monday and Wednesday.
That son of a bitch.

353
00:43:18,586 --> 00:43:20,747
- Shoulda brought him up on charges.
- I tried...

354
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:23,619
and was advised by personnel
to see a therapist.

355
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:32,531
They couldn't get rid of me.

356
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:35,858
I was saved by the union and the
fact that Warwick would come out...

357
00:43:35,937 --> 00:43:38,064
looking like the basic
shitheel that he is.

358
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:43,804
So I'm still here.

359
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:46,005
On borrowed time, I guess.

360
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,222
Bet you hate him, too,
Mrs. Warwick.

361
00:45:02,723 --> 00:45:05,954
This'll teach you to fire me,
you son of a bitch.

362
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:10,821
Shit.

363
00:45:48,536 --> 00:45:50,766
- The best and the brightest.
- Pull!

364
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,139
Carmichael, you want to try it?

365
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,610
Go on.

366
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:10,347
Carmichael.

367
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:13,192
Ippeston.

368
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,490
leave the ghetto blaster
back in the ghetto.

369
00:46:15,563 --> 00:46:16,860
Yes, sir.

370
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:22,968
Don't want anybody being cute
with one of these.

371
00:46:23,037 --> 00:46:25,733
You end up spraying one of
your buddies back onto a slab.

372
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:29,202
Now...

373
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:32,541
the work area's listed over there,
just like we talked about.

374
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:36,949
Jobs split evenly
night by night.

375
00:46:37,017 --> 00:46:39,383
Tried to keep it interesting.

376
00:46:39,453 --> 00:46:40,852
Any questions?

377
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:45,616
Basically, we need to have
this basement in a workable state...

378
00:46:45,693 --> 00:46:47,456
by next Thursday.

379
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:49,894
We only got the chain hoist
for one night.

380
00:46:51,432 --> 00:46:55,300
Execute these orders, you'll get
through it without a snag.

381
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:59,066
And then what happens? Do we all,
like, get a gold watch or something?

382
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:12,444
Sure beats nailing 'em
with soda pop.

383
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,704
What are you doing?

384
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:14,507
Warwick says to list everything.

385
00:48:14,582 --> 00:48:18,746
Fifty-year-old files are crap.
list them as 50-year-old crap.

386
00:48:19,954 --> 00:48:21,751
It's not salvageable.

387
00:48:44,718 --> 00:48:45,912
Hey, check this out.

388
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:50,086
Come on.
Take a break.

389
00:48:50,157 --> 00:48:53,854
The longer it takes, the longer
we'll be down here doing it.

390
00:48:55,529 --> 00:48:58,020
This thing's in great shape.

391
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:30,961
Brogan!

392
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:48,346
Rats.

393
00:49:49,649 --> 00:49:51,583
No problem.

394
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:24,479
Where are you going, asshole?

395
00:50:57,551 --> 00:50:59,883
You goddamn ignoramus,
you almost killed me!

396
00:50:59,953 --> 00:51:02,148
What the hell is your problem,
Brogan?

397
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:07,021
I ain't got a problem.
You got a problem?

398
00:51:25,745 --> 00:51:28,441
look, guys, this is crazy.

399
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:32,217
We were hired as a cleanup crew,
not as exterminators.

400
00:51:34,187 --> 00:51:37,122
I mean, I need this money
as bad as the next guy.

401
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:40,159
But we are not damn exterminators!

402
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:42,422
What's your problem, boy?

403
00:51:44,831 --> 00:51:48,232
- We were hired to clean the basement.
- ""We?''

404
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:54,705
You speaking for everybody?

405
00:51:54,774 --> 00:51:56,207
Or just yourself?

406
00:52:17,564 --> 00:52:19,225
Just me, Mr. Warwick.

407
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:24,168
""Just me, Mr. Warwick.''
Yeah.

408
00:52:29,576 --> 00:52:33,706
You best be punching out
your time card...

409
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,214
permanently.

410
00:52:36,283 --> 00:52:38,251
Is that clear, boy?

411
00:52:52,732 --> 00:52:54,757
Somebody call break?

412
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:20,692
Control that sack of fleas,
Cleveland. Please.

413
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,354
Moxy, come on over here.

414
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:28,732
Moxy here is a real special breed.

415
00:53:28,802 --> 00:53:30,565
Rat terrier.

416
00:53:32,072 --> 00:53:35,872
He didn't waste his puppy years
down at the beach...

417
00:53:35,942 --> 00:53:39,207
playing Frisbee
with Frankie and Annette.

418
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,844
He was too busy training...

419
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:46,113
tracking rats through walls,
concrete.

420
00:53:46,186 --> 00:53:49,986
looks to me
like he don't always win.

421
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,085
Hey, Moxy, cut that out.

422
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:55,389
Cleveland...

423
00:53:55,462 --> 00:53:59,228
we got ourselves
a little problem, you and me.

424
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:01,859
Our sister mills along the river
don't take too kindly...

425
00:54:01,935 --> 00:54:04,995
having their backyards polluted
by rat stew.

426
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:11,071
But our own Mr. Bachman
has graciously agreed...

427
00:54:11,144 --> 00:54:15,877
to keep your name out of
any impending lawsuit.

428
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:19,112
You are legally responsible...

429
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:22,348
when it comes right down to it.

430
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:28,119
Ain't you a kick in the nuts?

431
00:54:29,295 --> 00:54:30,990
First off...

432
00:54:31,064 --> 00:54:33,760
I was called personally
by Bachman...

433
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:36,666
and told to pump
directly into the river...

434
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:40,672
because, just between you,
me and Moxy...

435
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,767
he was too cheap to spring
for the dumping charges hisself.

436
00:54:44,844 --> 00:54:46,971
Hope you got that in writing.

437
00:54:50,016 --> 00:54:50,948
Fuck you.

438
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:52,712
No, Cleveland, fuck you.

439
00:54:52,786 --> 00:54:56,779
Stunts like that can easily cost
an exterminator his license.

440
00:54:56,856 --> 00:54:59,450
But again...

441
00:54:59,526 --> 00:55:02,791
no one's naming names.

442
00:55:02,862 --> 00:55:07,026
We're only asking you to provide
one additional service.

443
00:55:08,768 --> 00:55:11,601
We got an idea of where
them things is nesting.

444
00:55:12,672 --> 00:55:15,470
Shouldn't take you
more than a night.

445
00:55:35,361 --> 00:55:37,290
What is it you got me doing?

446
00:55:40,793 --> 00:55:44,194
When's the last time
you've been to a graveyard?

447
00:55:55,641 --> 00:55:57,040
Come on, Moxy.

448
00:55:59,245 --> 00:56:03,204
Burn their little home
so we can get back to ours.

449
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:16,188
Go on, Moxy!
Get 'em!

450
00:56:16,262 --> 00:56:18,526
Eat 'em for breakfast!

451
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:56,330
Come on, Moxy.

452
00:56:56,402 --> 00:56:59,166
There just ain't no job
worth this.

453
00:57:05,545 --> 00:57:06,603
Moxy?

454
00:57:08,915 --> 00:57:09,939
Moxy?

455
00:57:14,854 --> 00:57:16,981
Ain't no dog worth it either.

456
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:14,704
Just a few more hours.

457
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,008
I know.

458
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:39,697
Break's over.

459
00:58:39,772 --> 00:58:42,434
Back to work.

460
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:45,272
The week's almost over.
I thought it would never end.

461
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:48,313
Place still looks like shit.
What are they looking to put here?

462
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:50,372
- A nightclub.
- Really?

463
00:58:51,851 --> 00:58:54,217
You must have been at the top
of your class, Brogan.

464
00:58:54,286 --> 00:58:57,449
Truth is, they're expanding
for office space.

465
00:58:57,523 --> 00:58:59,616
Who would have an office down here?

466
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:11,494
Hey, look at this.

467
00:59:15,074 --> 00:59:17,065
What you got, kids?

468
00:59:17,143 --> 00:59:19,634
Trap door.

469
00:59:19,712 --> 00:59:21,475
Well, ain't that interestin'.

470
00:59:21,547 --> 00:59:23,538
It certainly is.

471
00:59:23,616 --> 00:59:26,141
That's where your rats
are coming from.

472
00:59:26,218 --> 00:59:28,618
They're breeding underground.

473
00:59:28,688 --> 00:59:31,088
Now you know it all,
don't you, Hall?

474
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:34,251
Hey, boys.

475
00:59:34,326 --> 00:59:36,453
Come on over here.

476
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:42,766
Can't get it.

477
00:59:42,835 --> 00:59:45,099
Brogan, give me a hand.

478
00:59:52,845 --> 00:59:54,745
Wow!
I wonder what's down there.

479
00:59:55,848 --> 00:59:57,941
Brogan, fetch your lamp.

480
01:00:01,187 --> 01:00:04,020
- You're not thinking of going in?
- Me?

481
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:06,251
No. No, sir.

482
01:00:06,325 --> 01:00:08,691
Johnny is on hoses tonight.

483
01:00:08,761 --> 01:00:11,457
I trust his judgment,
him bein' a college boy and all.

484
01:00:12,865 --> 01:00:16,858
On one condition-- need an extra
body to help me carry the line.

485
01:00:16,936 --> 01:00:18,528
Name your body.

486
01:00:28,147 --> 01:00:29,876
You, Mr. Foreman.

487
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:36,214
The management should be represented
in this little venture...

488
01:00:36,288 --> 01:00:38,518
don't you think?

489
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:42,391
In case there is a treasure, I don't
want to be accused of stealing it.

490
01:00:44,396 --> 01:00:47,456
You first.
Be right after you.

491
01:00:50,035 --> 01:00:50,967
I'm going.

492
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,809
Danson. Carmichael.
Come on. Gear up.

493
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,745
Brogan, you too.

494
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:07,580
At Bachman, we're just
one big happy family.

495
01:01:11,557 --> 01:01:14,856
Yeah. The Manson family.

496
01:01:39,218 --> 01:01:40,810
You all right?

497
01:01:41,954 --> 01:01:44,115
We need to find someplace
to sit you down.

498
01:01:45,191 --> 01:01:47,455
There's a table in the corner.

499
01:01:47,526 --> 01:01:49,357
Come on. Come on.

500
01:01:49,428 --> 01:01:51,419
Brogan, watch your step.

501
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:02,505
What the hell we got here?

502
01:02:02,575 --> 01:02:06,067
A bygone power source--
water power.

503
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:08,238
looks like it hasn't
worked in years.

504
01:02:08,314 --> 01:02:12,444
Smells like stale piss down here.
I say we turn around right now.

505
01:02:12,518 --> 01:02:15,248
So much for your
breedin' ground, Hall.

506
01:02:15,988 --> 01:02:18,513
- Can you feel it? Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

507
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:34,168
Shit, Brogan.
You're a regular bug light.

508
01:02:57,069 --> 01:02:58,764
Shit!

509
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:22,192
I see him!

510
01:03:24,262 --> 01:03:25,490
Grab hold of the wood!

511
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,229
I'm comin' down.

512
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:40,337
- There's something down here!
- Hold on, Brogan!

513
01:03:40,412 --> 01:03:42,437
Hold on!

514
01:03:44,282 --> 01:03:46,580
- Oh,Jesus!
- There he is!

515
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:50,052
Please help me! Danson!

516
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:52,882
Come on.

517
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:10,839
He's dead!
Brogan's dead!

518
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:14,445
Shut up, Carmichael!

519
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:18,741
Give me that.

520
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,314
We can use these for weapons.

521
01:04:52,884 --> 01:04:56,285
Something our friend Hall
hasn't got.

522
01:04:56,354 --> 01:04:58,914
And I'll deal with her--
her and Hall.

523
01:04:59,758 --> 01:05:03,023
Fuck Hall, damn it. Forget about
Hall and start thinking about...

524
01:05:03,094 --> 01:05:05,654
whatever the hell is down here.

525
01:05:06,965 --> 01:05:09,229
He found the openin'.

526
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:13,398
He brought us down here.

527
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,539
We wouldn't be here
if it weren't for him.

528
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:24,909
So don't go telling me
my business.

529
01:05:25,984 --> 01:05:28,475
You're going out
of your mind, Warwick.

530
01:05:28,553 --> 01:05:31,249
You just stood there
and watched Brogan die.

531
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:35,891
You did.

532
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:45,102
All right, move.

533
01:05:57,782 --> 01:05:59,716
It's a dead end.

534
01:06:00,785 --> 01:06:02,980
There must be some other way
out of here.

535
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,383
Wait. listen.

536
01:06:10,228 --> 01:06:12,389
- Come on!
- Wait a second!

537
01:06:16,067 --> 01:06:18,592
John, this has gotta be
a way out.

538
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:35,951
Here. Grab ahold of this.

539
01:06:55,273 --> 01:06:57,332
Which way do we go?

540
01:07:01,913 --> 01:07:04,211
- Mr. Warwick.
- What you got there?

541
01:07:04,282 --> 01:07:06,079
Water. Pretty loud.

542
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:11,113
You hear it?

543
01:07:13,592 --> 01:07:15,685
Sounds like the river.

544
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,694
I knew it.
I knew this was the way out.

545
01:07:17,762 --> 01:07:21,254
It's your moment, Carmichael.
You go first.

546
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:25,597
Go on.
Be right in back of you.

547
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:37,940
There's a hole here.

548
01:07:44,856 --> 01:07:47,450
I think we can break through.

549
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:51,520
It's wet.

550
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:58,728
Something's got my arm!
Help me!

551
01:07:58,803 --> 01:08:01,101
Carmichael, what is it?

552
01:08:01,172 --> 01:08:03,436
Help me!
Something's got my arm!

553
01:08:07,445 --> 01:08:09,345
Danson, move! Move!

554
01:08:09,414 --> 01:08:11,541
Somebody help me!

555
01:08:14,285 --> 01:08:15,445
Move!

556
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:22,549
Please, somebody help me!

557
01:08:23,628 --> 01:08:25,391
- Please!
- It's blocked!

558
01:08:25,463 --> 01:08:28,694
- It's blocked!
- Wait. Wait!

559
01:08:43,748 --> 01:08:45,978
Hey, the river!

560
01:08:50,555 --> 01:08:53,456
Help me! Help me!

561
01:08:53,525 --> 01:08:55,356
Help!

562
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:57,361
Help me! Help me!

563
01:09:07,172 --> 01:09:08,764
All right now.

564
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:16,773
We're gonna take this
nice and slow.

565
01:09:17,849 --> 01:09:20,147
No more! No more! No more!

566
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:24,844
No, I'm not going!
No, I'm not going anymore! No more!

567
01:09:24,923 --> 01:09:26,447
You wanna die?

568
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:29,559
I'm not going anywhere!

569
01:09:32,197 --> 01:09:33,926
Ain't that bad.

570
01:09:49,574 --> 01:09:51,838
It's ice cold.

571
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:53,877
I'm very close.

572
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:02,479
We'll never get through that way.

573
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:04,817
At least not with that thing.

574
01:11:03,014 --> 01:11:04,538
Help me!

575
01:11:06,617 --> 01:11:08,209
Help me!

576
01:11:50,027 --> 01:11:52,018
We're gonna make it.

577
01:11:53,097 --> 01:11:54,689
I know.

578
01:11:56,767 --> 01:11:58,826
- You ready?
- Yeah.

579
01:12:25,696 --> 01:12:28,164
Must be where it lives.

580
01:12:40,945 --> 01:12:42,503
Come on. let's go.

581
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,353
Mr. Foreman.

582
01:12:58,429 --> 01:13:00,260
Come on.
let's lift him up.

583
01:13:05,403 --> 01:13:08,600
- It's really bad.
- We should let the bastard bleed.

584
01:13:08,673 --> 01:13:11,073
Here, hold that.
Hold it for a second.

585
01:15:52,269 --> 01:15:54,567
Yeah, yeah.

586
01:16:45,523 --> 01:16:47,115
We're goin'...

587
01:16:48,526 --> 01:16:49,823
to hell...

588
01:16:56,901 --> 01:16:58,801
together!

589
01:21:05,675 --> 01:21:08,940
There's only one way
to deal with these fuckers.

590
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:41,584
<i>The show's over</i>.

591
01:22:41,584 --> 01:22:43,074
<i>The show's over</i>.
