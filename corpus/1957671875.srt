1
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,716
All those years
have led to this.

2
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:31,030
All those torturous,
delinquent years,

3
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,068
when I was too high to remember
have led to this moment,

4
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:39,762
the most important,
lucrative night of my life.

5
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:42,214
Rabbit, look what you've done.

6
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:45,044
You've done good, buddy.

7
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,356
You finally moved up and
got a piece of the pie.

8
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:51,706
From living the high life
to living the high in life.

9
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:59,749
Rabbit's back, baby.

Geez, look at the time,

I'm gonna have customers.

36
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:09,991
I mean, fine dining patrons,

37
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,649
beating down the
door in minutes.

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
I'm sorry, ma'am,

39
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:25,283
miss, we're not open yet.

40
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:28,147
You'll have to wait out front

41
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,392
with the rest of the
customers in line.

42
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,050
There is a line up
front, isn't it?

43
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,020
Geez, I spend a fortune
on advertisement.

44
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,783
Oh, please.

45
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:45,406
Don't cry beautiful lady.

46
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:50,341
You certainly have
a full basket.

47
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:52,757
They catch the tears.

48
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:55,244
What's your name young hot lady?

49
00:02:56,762 --> 00:03:00,248
Thomasina Atkins,
people call me Tom.

50
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:01,559
I'm rabbit,

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,631
I'm the owner of
this establishment.

52
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:06,357
It's beautiful.

53
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:08,187
Thank you.

54
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,086
I spend a freaking
fortune on it.

55
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:11,914
I can tell.

56
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,090
Grand opening tonight.

57
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:17,196
Oh, it's your big night.

58
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,439
I'm so sorry to cause
you any distress.

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,616
Believe me, anybody
in this dress is

60
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,274
no problem at all.

61
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,035
What can I do for you?

62
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,486
I just lost my waitress
job down the street

63
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:34,109
and I'm on a really
tight budget,

64
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,526
and now I'm not gonna be
able to afford to pay rent,

65
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:39,873
or keep my bangy
thingies in check,

66
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:42,876
or get any frivolous
streaming services

67
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:45,638
or buy cowboy hats
from my lizard.

68
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,056
Oh, that's a hell of a pickle.

69
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:53,611
No, I don't want
sex from you, Mr.

70
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:57,823
Oh, why should you be
different than anyone else?

71
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,619
I got it.

72
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,414
The restaurant opens
in a couple of hours,

73
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,106
and I could use all
the help I can get.

74
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:14,529
Does it look like
these hands do dishes?

75
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,082
No.

76
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,153
And I do not understand
the mysteries of cooking.

77
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:20,431
Oh, we have people for that.

78
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:21,571
And I don't do that.

79
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,333
Be a server?

80
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:26,334
Heck no.

81
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,166
Well, what is it that you do?

82
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,205
You do that very well.

83
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:37,517
Totally.

84
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:38,726
I've got it.

85
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:45,250
I think I just found my
new double D.

86
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,323
Hostess.

87
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,534
What does, I'll take it.

88
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:55,742
Deal.

89
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,652
So, this is where
the magic happens.

90
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,378
Wouldn't that be the kitchen?

91
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,105
No, this is where they
make the food disappear.

92
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:16,901
A little restaurant humor.

93
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:18,041
Very little.

94
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:22,182
It's so elegant, unless
it cost you a fortune.

95
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,183
It did.

96
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:28,430
I inherited a small fortune
from a nephew who croaked.

97
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:29,983
He died?

98
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:32,641
Aw, he must have
loved you so much.

99
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:33,540
I never met him.

100
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,713
You never met him?

101
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:40,340
No, I was too busy getting
high over multiple dimensions.

102
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,032
It's a long story.

103
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,621
I'd love to share with
you over coffee one day.

104
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:48,208
That's okay.

105
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,590
Okay.

106
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:57,286
I'm not going back
to the old Rabbit.

107
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,116
I'm not going back
to the old Rabbit.

108
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:01,050
I'm not going back
to the old Rabbit.

109
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:03,741
Then don't.

110
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:07,643
So,

111
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,371
would you like to meet the
rest of the crew and...

112
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,441
Let's do it.

113
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:14,684
This way.

114
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:25,661
Girls, ladies, let
me introduce you

115
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:30,113
to our new,

116
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,911
a person at the front of
the house, Tom Atkins.

117
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:40,295
Girls,

118
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:44,092
are you texting each other?

119
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:46,301
You could just
talk to each other,

120
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:47,890
it's not that hard.

121
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:50,513
Okay, good.

122
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,826
Well, they're busy right now.

123
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:55,517
They're prepping
for the big opening.

124
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:57,001
Obviously.

125
00:06:57,002 --> 00:07:01,178
Let me show you to the
heart and soul, the kitchen.

126
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:03,318
You're gonna love our new chef.

127
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,664
Oh, is he well known?

128
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:08,497
She, and she is known
across space and time.

129
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,431
Wow, girl power, all right.

130
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,433
Yes.

131
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:23,995
Here it is.

132
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,824
A word with you, Rabbit.

133
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:26,928
In a moment.

134
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,447
First, I want you to meet Tom.

135
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,656
Tom, this is Sal,

136
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:34,868
the best cook who answered
my one ads, Sal Monella.

137
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:38,215
Your name is Sal Monella?

138
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:39,803
That is correct.

139
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:41,598
You have Sal Monella
in your kitchen.

140
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,047
I have spread myself

141
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:46,223
over every inch of every
surface of this establishment.

142
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,294
You got a problem or...

143
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:51,297
I just wouldn't
tell the diners that.

144
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:53,955
Pleased to make your
acquaintance.

145
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:54,957
Maybe later.

146
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,064
Your name is Tom, is it?

147
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:01,307
It is.

148
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:03,551
And yet you are
a woman, allegedly.

149
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:05,105
Definitely.

150
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:07,313
I'll be watching you.

151
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:08,557
Good to know.

152
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:17,496
Sal, you wanted a word with me?

153
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,980
Permission to speak commandant.

154
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:19,981
Granted.

155
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,742
This is union,

156
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:24,123
this chef is unacceptable.

157
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:27,126
If you're talking union,
you are like banging her,

158
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:30,025
yes, it's very unacceptable.

159
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:33,581
I am not stopping,
nor will I ever stop it.

160
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,790
Then what's the problem.

161
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:39,172
I am quite notorious
for my food, yeah?

162
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:40,002
Yeah.

163
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:40,830
Yeah.

164
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:42,072
Yeah.

165
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:42,970
My food, ridiculous
on this eyes, yeah?

166
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,799
Yeah.
Yeah, yes.

167
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,076
Like clockwork, yeah?

168
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:46,905
Yeah.

169
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:47,906
Yeah, yes.

170
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:50,563
Just like this time piece,

171
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,392
which has survived many of wars

172
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:54,513
and been handed down to me
throughout the generations.

173
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:58,433
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,

174
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:00,642
tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock...

175
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:02,093
What's the problem, Sal?

176
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,684
This is suicide.

177
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,548
I cannot work with that bitch.

178
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,860
But you've just met, Tom.

179
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:13,449
Not a confusingly named woman.

180
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:16,107
Her.

181
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,282
That's right, it's
me motherfuckers.

182
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,353
What's that sour eating bitch

183
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,597
complaining about now?

184
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:27,669
You lack the kitchen acumen
to which I am accustomed.

185
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,225
You slang slack at the
penitentiary, Pretzel Boy.

186
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:35,195
We Germans do not
look to the past,

187
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,336
it is full of strife
from darkness,

188
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:40,337
only to the future.

189
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:43,271
But yeah, yeah,

190
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:44,859
I trained and horned
my skills there.

191
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,033
Dropping the soap
is not a skill.

192
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:49,416
It's a choice.

193
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,901
Or I can slit your
tiny little throat.

194
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:56,664
Guys, guys, we gotta
learn to get along.

195
00:09:56,665 --> 00:10:00,322
At least just for tonight,
it's important to me.

196
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,773
So maybe it's just
first night jitters.

197
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:04,396
Sal does not jitter.

198
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:10,092
That's not what inmate
number 5727543 said.

199
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:14,095
I cannot work under
these conditions, Rabbit.

200
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:16,029
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.
- Everybody, please.

201
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:22,103
Not today, Satan.

202
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,346
Not today, Satan.

203
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:27,867
You got this, Rabbit,
you got this, Rabbit.

204
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,352
Don't go back to your old ways.

205
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:42,606
I almost had a moment.

206
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:45,436
So, how do we course correct?

207
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,473
Man, we just
gotta work together,

208
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,234
just for tonight, I beg of you.

209
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,617
You beg, Sal Monella?

210
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,653
Yes.

211
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,207
You need Sal Monella, no?

212
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,208
No, yes.

213
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,142
Fuck yes.

214
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:02,040
We're good.

215
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,662
We're good.

216
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,008
Want to hug it out?

217
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,388
The Germans do not hug.

218
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:07,527
You sure?

219
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,185
Never, never ever.

220
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:11,153
Then we're good.

221
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:12,636
Yeah, we're always good.

222
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,846
So why don't you whip
up something as a trial

223
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,469
or get the kinks worked out.

224
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:22,335
Such a treat for you.

225
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:24,476
You hang on, I'll be right back.

226
00:11:27,963 --> 00:11:30,343
Take it easier on
my guy, will you?

227
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:31,173
As if?

228
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:32,173
Please.

229
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,835
Okay, I'll lay off that
masturbate race motherfucker.

230
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:39,974
Thank you.

231
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:42,873
More time for me to plan
on taking over the world.

232
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:44,461
We're over that now.

233
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:45,635
This is a restaurant.

234
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:48,741
With a side of
cosmic domination.

235
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,330
We're legit now, remember?

236
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:53,539
Oh, you're no
fucking fun anymore.

237
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,129
Just stick to the
recipes we labored over.

238
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:59,027
I am, dickhead.

239
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:00,340
I'll be waiting outside.

240
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:09,521
Girls, you think you might
wanna try on your uniforms?

241
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:15,700
You are so screwed, aren't you?

242
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,978
I'm just circling the toilet
waiting for the big flush.

243
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,815
Or, you can pick yourself up
and go kick some ass tonight.

244
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,668
You're the only one
that's ever believed in me.

245
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:33,613
If you say so.

246
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:34,934
Do you really think I can do it?

247
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:39,550
Okay, dick,

248
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,104
let's put our differences aside

249
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:43,934
and do this for that
dumb motherfucker,

250
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:45,211
for the Rabbit.

251
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,730
You're down?

252
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:49,457
I'm down, for the Rabbit.

253
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,115
Good, let's start with
the French onion soup.

254
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,186
In French they call it zup.

255
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,567
Then we'll serve up a.

256
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,294
Next course will be a goddamn.

257
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,779
I like it.

258
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,332
And finish off

259
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,092
with a motherfucking
beef burger.

260
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:05,335
How do you like that shit?

261
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:07,924
My taste buds are good.

262
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:09,580
Then burst a move.

263
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,581
Yeah.

264
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:21,490
What's the fucking problem?

265
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,286
Yeah, they came.

266
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,462
What's the fucking problem?

267
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:31,085
The ingredients are.

268
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:32,741
Say what?

269
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:36,401
There are no ingredients,
except for this.

270
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,095
Fucking Rabbit.

271
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,337
We can't go on.

272
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,442
Baby, you tripping.

273
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:45,271
We must forfeit.

274
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:47,342
Well, we're going, all right?

275
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:49,897
You think you're some
posh motherfucking chef?

276
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:51,070
Well, then, prove it.

277
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,832
We are not serving
farty cowboys.

278
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,458
Somehow, some way, make
it happen crowd mouth.

279
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,048
Where did you go?

280
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,554
It's pretty fancy, huh?

281
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:27,555
It's nice as heck.

282
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,938
Now what?

283
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,422
Oh, I think we are supposed

284
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:34,839
to put it on the table, okay.

285
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,738
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

286
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:45,849
Oh, I can smell it.

287
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,920
It smells good, huh?

288
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,888
Almost.

289
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,305
Top off.

290
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:56,411
Vanessa.

291
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:58,725
Idiot, she means this.

292
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:10,218
What the hell is that?

293
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,427
It looks like
beanie weenie to me.

294
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:16,605
That's not a French
dish, I can't pronounce.

295
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:21,575
Sal, Sal...

296
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,136
What the hell
happened, fuck dude.

297
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:34,691
You will address me as
chef dude, I earned it.

298
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,728
You've earned a
boot of your nut sack,

299
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,558
is what you've earned.

300
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,800
You trusted in me.

301
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,319
You will, this is
no time for jokes.

302
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,943
I assure you this is
knock, knock, knock.

303
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,462
Ebee, please explain.

304
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:48,705
You didn't place

305
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:50,258
the motherfucking food
order motherfucker.

306
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:51,950
I thought you were gonna do it.

307
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,953
I was, but you said
you'd take care of it.

308
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,921
I assumed you'd know I'd
mess it up and do it anyway.

309
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:59,164
Well, I tried to give

310
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:01,511
your dumb ass the
benefit of the doubt.

311
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:02,444
So it's your fault.

312
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:04,272
Not me, scrotum face.

313
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:06,447
What are we gonna do?

314
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:08,622
We're opening soon, proto.

315
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:13,833
We don't have time to
hit the grocery store,

316
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,249
and there's no time to order in.

317
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,943
We can't close, all
the VIPs will be here.

318
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,015
Oh geez, Louise.

319
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:26,640
You know, maybe...

320
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Get your...

321
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:32,853
Oh just show me a sign that
everything's gonna be alright.

322
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:40,206
Oh don't show me a sign that
everything will be okay.

323
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:51,975
You have a plan?

324
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:55,116
We must make do with the
beans on the French.

325
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:57,360
Don't worry your old ass.

326
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,672
Ebee's got a motherfucking plan.

327
00:16:59,673 --> 00:17:01,122
I've heard that before.

328
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:03,849
Just run your show
and we'll run ours.

329
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,126
These will be the best beans

330
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:07,439
and tiny dick sausages
they've ever eaten.

331
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,406
My high standard indeed.

332
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:10,925
No, get out,

333
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:12,065
we've got work to do.

334
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:18,657
He helps this, he helps
this, he helps this.

335
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:21,177
Ebee, how are we
going to win this war?

336
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:23,558
White people don't
know how to eat anyhow,

337
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,181
and that's a fact jerk.

338
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:28,529
It's all about the picture,
or if it makes them happy.

339
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,670
Yeah, but we are still working
with beans on

340
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:34,017
or not even the German
quality, I might add.

341
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,537
I'm not happy.

342
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:40,127
Yeah, I got a secret ingredient.

343
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:42,370
It's a happy spice.

344
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:46,754
, sumac,.

345
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,412
Weed, motherfucker.

346
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,624
Lots and lots of exotic weed.

347
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:58,353
Cushy.

348
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,151
Phones down.

349
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,463
Phones down, please.

350
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:08,363
Come on, this is important.

351
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:12,055
Attention.

352
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:12,953
Oh I have ADDE.

353
00:18:12,954 --> 00:18:14,989
Oh, I have ADHD.

354
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,097
I mean, stand up
straight, arms to the side.

355
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,555
We must all adhere to the
exacting standards of the owner,

356
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,281
the master of the restaurant.

357
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:32,558
Isn't that you?

358
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,560
Sure, it is.

359
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:39,117
Our appearance must be as
meticulous as our food,

360
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,533
and that's gone down the tube.

361
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:43,155
So we have to look extra good.

362
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,156
Nails.

363
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:46,918
On point, smiles.

364
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,231
Outstanding.

365
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,751
Boobies.

366
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:54,374
No.

367
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,410
Worth the shot.

368
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:57,894
Where's Tom?

369
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,103
Coming.

370
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:05,591
- Wow.
- Oh, where'd you get that?

371
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:07,214
Just a little something
I threw together.

372
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,249
Do you like it?

373
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,250
Rabbit wanna grab it.

374
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:12,599
How about no.

375
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,052
As you all know, this
is a big night for me,

376
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:19,571
for all of us.

377
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,539
I need this to work
for so many reasons.

378
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,162
Beanie weenies.

379
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,784
Thanks for reminding me.

380
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:29,374
The deck is clearly stacked
against me, food-wise.

381
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,962
So it all comes down
to excellent service.

382
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,275
That's where we'll win.

383
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,968
Vanessa, Nicky.

384
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,418
Huh?

385
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,456
I'm screwed sideways
up the bean hole.

386
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:46,874
It's time.

387
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,116
What's wrong.

388
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:50,429
Mother hovered in
a barb wire thong.

389
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,466
What am I gonna do?

390
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,745
Here's what you're gonna do.

391
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,471
You're gonna pull up
your adult diapers,

392
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:59,335
and then you're
just gonna go do it.

393
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:00,302
And then what?

394
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:01,924
And then do it again.

395
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:03,685
And then what?

396
00:20:03,686 --> 00:20:05,099
Repeat as necessary.

397
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
A little kiss?

398
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,655
Oh but don't do that again.

399
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:11,279
Best pep dog never.

400
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:14,384
Rabbit's got this.

401
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,800
It's the moment of truth.

402
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,424
Little drum roll please.

403
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,913
And here we go.

404
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:32,196
Oh, I'm really not
good with word scrambles,

405
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:35,854
I don't get it.

406
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:37,374
Lelapin Haut.

407
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:39,720
It means a high rabbit.

408
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,308
Catchy.

409
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,449
Because we serve
high cuisine and such.

410
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,486
And shouldn't it be
called Rabbit's bean hole?

411
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:50,455
Nobody wants to eat that.

412
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:51,973
You said it.

413
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:54,770
Just open the
door, Major Double D.

414
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,220
Major D.

415
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:20,278
Wow, it's right across
the street from Gucci.

416
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,349
Isn't that so cute.

417
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:24,559
Hi.

418
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,491
- Oh, I love it.
- Hi.

419
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:27,733
Oh, get one, get one.

420
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:28,734
There you go.

421
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,738
Did you guys come
in here on purpose?

422
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:33,740
Yeah, of course.

423
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:36,950
Is someone chasing you?

424
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:38,226
Should I call the feds?

425
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:39,090
We heard this is
the new hot shot.

426
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:40,539
From who?

427
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,093
Can you get us in or not?

428
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,060
Lemme check.

429
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:46,718
As luck would have it,

430
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,858
I can squeeze you
in, but just barely.

431
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:50,411
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

432
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:51,861
Don't push that button.

433
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:53,241
Why?

434
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,346
We got some suckers.

435
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,348
I mean, diners.

436
00:21:57,592 --> 00:21:59,178
Look alive everybody.

437
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:00,835
Back to your stations.

438
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,631
We're in business bitches.

439
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,677
Your server will be
right with you guys.

440
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:15,678
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

441
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:19,027
It's so exciting.

442
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:24,134
I think I'll frame their
money from the bill,

443
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,239
first dollar from
the first customer.

444
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,654
They're dining dashers.

445
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:28,795
I know the type, I am one.

446
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:31,695
Where's Vanessa and Nikki?

447
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,146
Oh fuck, fuck, fuck.

448
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:38,978
That's okay, I'll do it.

449
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:42,187
I took the liberty of
making you some new menus.

450
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,569
Thank you very much.

451
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,229
Oh, no.

452
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:50,196
It's gonna be okay.

453
00:22:50,197 --> 00:22:51,436
Some shit gonna lit up seats.

454
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,337
I'm so fucking high.

455
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:57,167
Good evening ladies.

456
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:57,997
Who are you?

457
00:22:57,998 --> 00:22:59,618
My name is Rabbit.

458
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:01,896
This is my establishment.

459
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:05,141
Being you're our first customer,

460
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:07,281
I thought I would
wait on you myself

461
00:23:07,282 --> 00:23:09,041
for excellent tip top service.

462
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,147
Aww, yay.

463
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:13,426
Get it?

464
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:14,426
Tip top.

465
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:22,227
How did you get this job again?

466
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:23,470
Maybe you don't get it.

467
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:25,264
That's okay.

468
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:26,645
What can I get you, ma'am?

469
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,371
I'll have the weenies
and beans please.

470
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:30,615
Oh, excellent choice.

471
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:32,133
And for you young lady?

472
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:35,827
I think I'll have
the number one.

473
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:39,278
Oh, equally scrumptious choice.

474
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,351
I can't decide between the
number one or the number two.

475
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:46,078
I assure you the
number two is just

476
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,668
as excellent as the number one.

477
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:51,256
Okay, I'll get
the number two then.

478
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:53,120
Okay, excellent choice.

479
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:54,950
I couldn't have
chosen better myself.

480
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:58,090
Wait, you didn't
write any of this down.

481
00:23:58,091 --> 00:23:59,091
No need.

482
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:00,646
Ooh.

483
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:01,646
You're good.

484
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:03,994
You're pretty.

485
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:05,235
You're pretty.

486
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,685
I'm gonna share
my tips with you.

487
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:09,101
Okay, I probably won't
share mine with you.

488
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:10,102
Okay.

489
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:13,072
Let me just get
this to the kitchen.

490
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,947
We got some, we got some.

491
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:28,190
Well, lay it on us.

492
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:30,468
What?

493
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,055
The orders, what
are they getting?

494
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:33,056
I forget.

495
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:35,438
They only have the one thing.

496
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,509
It's not what they
got, it's how many?

497
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,510
1, 2, 3,

498
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:40,547
4, 5, 6.

499
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,792
6?

500
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:44,965
Well, that's a great start.

501
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,932
No, it's three.

502
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:48,762
I just saw you count to six.

503
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:52,662
I was counting
boobies, three girls,

504
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:56,390
six boobies as three girls
is three, three orders.

505
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:58,875
It must be that
new fucking meth.

506
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,706
Then order up
three of that shit.

507
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:09,023
Is it ready?

508
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,269
Yeah, we all go.

509
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:14,926
The hell we are.

510
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:17,031
I haven't even checked the
dishes yet motherfucker,

511
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:18,481
wink wink.

512
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:22,589
My plating standard is
above grade across the board.

513
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,695
I must approve all dishes, wink,

514
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:29,872
leaving this wink kitchen
motherfucker, wink, wink.

515
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:32,806
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I see.

516
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:35,187
Are we ready or not?

517
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:36,914
Turn around Rabbit.

518
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:46,096
Good to go.

519
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:49,858
Bon appetit, bitches.

520
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:53,654
You're acting very
sketchy for a legit business

521
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:56,001
that isn't based on weed.

522
00:25:56,002 --> 00:25:58,280
Ladies dinner is served.

523
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:02,180
Aren't you gonna taste it?

524
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:04,458
Oh, we don't actually eat food.

525
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:05,666
Well...

526
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:07,147
Yeah, no, we just
take photos of it.

527
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,601
What do you mean,
you have to eat.

528
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,672
We just live off
supplements and brain water.

529
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:14,469
I'm not sure if that's working.

530
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,405
Here, now, let's do the Rabbit.

531
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:21,993
Oh my God.

532
00:26:22,684 --> 00:26:23,684
Wow.

533
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:30,623
Really?

534
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:31,486
Mmh.

535
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:32,314
Lemme try.

536
00:26:32,315 --> 00:26:33,937
Yeah, it's so good.

537
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:38,423
So silly.

538
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:42,703
Oh my gosh, stop it.

539
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:44,744
There's no way, that's so
much better than vitamins.

540
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:50,055
I know.

541
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:52,851
Oh my gosh.

542
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,961
I think they like it.

543
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:00,134
Is it getting hot in here?

544
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:01,033
- Yeah.
- It is amazing.

545
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:02,448
It is amazing.

546
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,976
Yes, yes, my God.

547
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:17,324
Oh my God, anyone else

people we find in the alley.

It's got prizes in it.

672
00:33:31,216 --> 00:33:33,527
Usually wedding bands.

673
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:37,842
I ain't never got a time
piece before, I tell you what.

674
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:41,156
I tell you the time
that shoe fell out.

675
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:43,676
Tell you what,

Welcome to Lelapin.

680
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:11,082
Here you go.

681
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,221
It took you long enough.

682
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:13,223
I'm sorry.

683
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:16,468
Yeah, you are actually.

684
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:19,850
Is this a joke?

685
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:22,162
No, I don't think so.

686
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:23,646
You know what?

687
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:25,683
Don't get smart with me you
little bitch, all right?

688
00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:28,444
It's not my fault that
you make the minimum wage.

689
00:34:28,445 --> 00:34:30,516
You could at least
crack a smile.

690
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:34,623
I come here a lot, all right,

691
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,246
and I spend a lot of money here.

692
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:39,352
Oh, we've only been
open for an hour.

693
00:34:39,353 --> 00:34:40,871
Get your manager.

694
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:44,357
Are you the manager?

695
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:45,875
Oh no.

696
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:48,326
Now, stop fucking around
and go get your manager.

697
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:49,741
I'm not in trouble, am I?

698
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:51,986
I can't go back to
prison bath fights.

699
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:55,264
Geez.

700
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:57,060
What seems to be the
problem here, miss?

701
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:00,407
You're the manager?

702
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:02,616
Actually, I'm the owner.

703
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,930
Another smart ass, I see.

704
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,689
And what the hell's going on
with these whores over here?

705
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,453
Got their titties out.

706
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:12,558
They're French.

707
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,492
My kid doesn't need
to see that, okay?

708
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:17,493
Look at them.

709
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:20,807
Your kid?

710
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:23,430
Don't talk about
my family, okay?

711
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:25,950
What exactly is
it that you want?

712
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:27,434
Don't interrupt me again,

713
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:31,438
I'm the customer and I
pay your salary, okay?

714
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:33,406
Not if you don't order.

715
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:35,753
I'm trying to make
a point, all right?

716
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,444
Like the point on your head.

717
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:38,445
Then make it.

718
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:42,863
I'll just take the number
one, and make it quick, okay?

719
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:44,486
Because I have places to go,

720
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:46,833
people to see, and things to do.

721
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:47,834
Right away.

722
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,183
Why are you still
standing there?

723
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,322
Shell-shocked.

724
00:35:53,323 --> 00:35:54,875
Chop-chop, okay?

725
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:56,395
My husband is a lawyer.

726
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,158
Ass hole.

727
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:05,403
He be coming baby,
just like that.

728
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:07,440
Don't fuck that bread up.

729
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:10,306
I assure you, my knife
skills are second to none.

730
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,761
You don't have time for
no motherfucking break.

731
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,350
Get back to work
to chickenstein.

732
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:24,077
Are you on break really?

733
00:36:24,078 --> 00:36:26,184
Sorry, high fives
are for winners.

734
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,602
How does my hair look?

735
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:33,638
It's really good,
you look so cute.

736
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,640
Hey, we're here,
it's Barbie and Kendra.

737
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:36,881
Reservations for two, please.

738
00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:38,575
Yay.

739
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:40,093
This is like so exciting.

740
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:41,681
Oh look at that table cloth.

741
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,510
Oh, and she's so much
better than our couch.

742
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:46,548
Does the red clash
with my pink though?

743
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:47,377
No.

744
00:36:47,378 --> 00:36:48,653
Okay.

745
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:49,310
Definitely not,
you look so cute.

746
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:50,828
You too.

747
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:53,486
Your server will be with
you, maybe, eventually.

748
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:54,384
Thank you.

749
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:55,626
Thanks.

750
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:56,661
Oh my God, this is so exciting.

751
00:36:56,662 --> 00:36:57,938
I know.

752
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:59,181
Can you believe this
is really happening?

753
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:01,563
No, we haven't been
out since the pandemic.

754
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:03,496
Unless you count
deep space and...

755
00:37:03,497 --> 00:37:05,118
No, no, no, we
don't mention that.

756
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,431
I want that to be
like a distant memory.

757
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:08,811
Totally, totally, totally.

758
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:11,676
It's been like two years
since we got dressed up.

759
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:14,369
Yeah, but admit it,
we always look fab.

760
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,785
Okay, I admit it to the max.

761
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,236
And we didn't even put
on any pandemic weight.

762
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,444
I mean, look at this dress,

763
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:22,100
it fits me like it's a dream.

764
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:24,068
It's because all
we had to eat was

765
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:25,725
like gummy llamas and the water.

766
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:26,658
Oh true.

767
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:27,692
But I got my coca boobs.

768
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,073
Yeah, you did.

769
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:30,627
I just have my COVID socks.

770
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,181
Gotta keep a perky.

771
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:34,181
Good track.

772
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:44,157
So is this like the new normal?

773
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:46,711
What, looking cute in
chewing and doing?

774
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:48,404
It's always been our normal.

775
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:51,233
- Say high five.
- Say high five.

776
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:52,166
Wait,

777
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:54,271
can we do this in real life now?

778
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,411
I mean, I think so.

779
00:37:56,412 --> 00:37:58,275
But it'd like so weird.

780
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,346
Yeah, I haven't touched another
person in like two years.

781
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:01,485
Why your face?

782
00:38:01,486 --> 00:38:03,177
You were like totally
all over that.

783
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:06,662
Oh, that was not personal,

784
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,077
that was called essential work.

785
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:08,907
Okay.

786
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:09,907
Okay.

787
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:15,085
Get up, get up.

788
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:16,086
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

789
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,501
- High five.
- High five.

790
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:18,917
Kiss in them.

791
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,300
Oh my God, my
purse's on the floor.

792
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:26,682
Oh my God.

793
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:28,375
Oh my God.

794
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,237
WTF.

795
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:30,237
It's him, it's him.

796
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:33,311
It really is him.

797
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:37,797
Oh what, he's like so
much taller than on TV.

798
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:40,801
Yeah, that's because it
was only a 32-inch TV, duh.

799
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:45,322
He's like so much
hotter than on Zoom.

800
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,944
Oh so much way hotter.

801
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:48,326
Thanks.

802
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,430
Did he hear us?

803
00:38:50,431 --> 00:38:52,708
I don't know, are we live?

804
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:53,709
Our mics must be on.

805
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:55,608
Hey girls,

806
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:58,127
Barbie and Kendra, right?

807
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,026
What are you doing here?

808
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:02,269
I like totally dunno how to
navigate real life anymore.

809
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,340
No.

810
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,651
Do you mind if I sit down?

811
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:05,928
I can't seem to find my party.

812
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,483
Oh, we're your party now tiger.

813
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,349
Put the mute button for.

814
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,730
Yes, sit, sit, sit.

815
00:39:17,044 --> 00:39:19,494
I cannot believe
that you're here.

816
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:20,702
I'm here.

817
00:39:20,703 --> 00:39:22,187
It's so amazing.

818
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:25,154
Oh, hi, here's your food.

819
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,087
- Oh yeah.
- Thank you.

820
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:27,536
But we haven't ordered yet.

821
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:28,917
Yeah, but this is what
you would've ordered, right?

822
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:29,746
True.

823
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:30,678
I'm gonna get you.

824
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,541
So how've you been like?

825
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,405
Tell us everything.

826
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:34,681
Tell us everything.

827
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:36,082
Been great, just
babysitting cats.

828
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:37,891
Babysitting cats.

829
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:39,065
I still have that passion, yeah.

830
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:40,342
Wait, so did I hear that

831
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:44,070
you're like you like
drive and race cars?

832
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:46,003
I do, I have modified that.

833
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:47,211
I have to guy drive,

834
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:48,799
but I drive a race
car in a lower class,

835
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,214
yeah.
Oh wow.

836
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:51,353
And that's amazing.

837
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:52,492
Coolest thing ever.

838
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:53,425
- That's sexy.
- I've had

839
00:39:53,426 --> 00:39:54,908
that passion before cats.

840
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:56,116
I've actually been racing
for many, many years.

841
00:39:56,117 --> 00:39:56,946
Seriously?

842
00:39:56,946 --> 00:39:57,774
Yeah.

843
00:39:57,774 --> 00:39:58,603
Wow.

844
00:39:58,603 --> 00:39:59,535
Yeah.

845
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:00,467
How did you get into that?

846
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:02,019
Just had to stay alive.

847
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,159
You gotta find things for
habits to keep you alive,

848
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,609
and racing was it.

849
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,405
I was at a point in my life
where everything was depressing,

850
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,268
nothing worked,

851
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:11,200
I couldn't do nothing,

852
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,996
and bam, I found racing
and loved it ever since.

853
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,584
- Wow.
- So cool.

854
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:17,724
Yeah, some people can't
believe I can drive like this.

855
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:18,554
I do.

856
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:19,486
You're like amazing.

857
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:20,693
You're so amazing.

858
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:21,626
I don't know about that, but...

859
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:22,454
It's cool.

860
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:23,421
I never give up.

861
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,697
So how's Joey.

862
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:26,423
He's hanging in there.

863
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,908
He's had some issues, he's
been in solitary a lot,

864
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:31,876
but he's never seen the whole
version of tiger come in.

865
00:40:31,877 --> 00:40:33,153
- What?
- What?

866
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:34,638
Yeah, yeah, they
keep him locked up

867
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:37,019
in solitary quite a bit
'cause of popularity.

868
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,262
Oh my gosh,

869
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:39,574
but good thing he
looks good in orange.

870
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:40,575
Yeah.

871
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:42,542
So I have to ask this

872
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:44,095
and I'm sure everybody
asked you this,

873
00:40:44,096 --> 00:40:46,443
but what was up with the
fire, and who did it?

874
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,168
Oh my gosh, in the first episode

875
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:52,000
there's a producer on
there and his name's Kirk,

876
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:54,416
and we have video
footage of him going

877
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,935
in front of the office
at the same time

878
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:58,938
that the fire was at night,
like four in the morning.

879
00:40:58,939 --> 00:41:00,595
And he's walking in
front of the cameras.

880
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:01,872
What?

881
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:02,805
That seems like
proof right there.

882
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:03,977
No, he left the country.

883
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:05,703
There's a whole safe missing,

884
00:41:05,704 --> 00:41:07,584
with hard drives in it,
and he left the country.

885
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:10,467
He fled.

886
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,677
To a country where he can't
be extradited back so...

887
00:41:13,678 --> 00:41:14,954
Wait, there's a safe missing

888
00:41:14,955 --> 00:41:16,334
with stuff inside of it?
There's a whole safe

889
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:17,404
missing with footage.

890
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:18,854
And he did a documentary,

891
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:22,479
and some of that footage I
believe is on that documentary.

892
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,239
Scandalous.

893
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,897
So how about like,

894
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,519
do you wanna tell
me a story about

895
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,695
how Joey like banged
all those boys?

896
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:34,698
Oh yeah, we called them puppies.

897
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:35,906
Puppies?

898
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,839
- Puppies, like dogs.
- Yeah, like dogs.

899
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,392
Wooden dogs?

900
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:42,499
Wooden dogs, it was usually
18-year olds to 19-year olds.

901
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,672
Oh my gosh.

902
00:41:43,673 --> 00:41:44,949
And we call them puppies

903
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,226
'cause we bring one
in the front door

904
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:47,711
and then one would be
going out the back door.

905
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:48,953
So you gotta kind of sneak
them in and out so...

906
00:41:48,954 --> 00:41:50,092
Oh my God.

907
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:51,335
- What?
- So the other one

908
00:41:51,336 --> 00:41:52,578
don't know about
the other one, yeah.

909
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:53,441
Wait, he's going
out of his door?

910
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:54,580
No, the house door.

911
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:55,581
Okay.

912
00:41:55,582 --> 00:41:56,582
Maybe his door.

913
00:41:57,273 --> 00:41:58,101
Oh snap.

914
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:58,930
- Yeah.
- Wow.

915
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:00,137
TMI for me.

916
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:01,345
Yeah.

917
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:03,066
That sounds like your
room in high school.

918
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:06,246
TMI.

919
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,084
What the fuck are
you looking for?

920
00:42:16,085 --> 00:42:17,637
You're missing bones?

921
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:19,157
My lucky watch, it's gone.

922
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:22,918
You don't need
that motherfucker.

923
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:27,060
My hand is for
reserved, I cannot go on.

924
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:28,717
Would you just
chill the fuck out

925
00:42:28,718 --> 00:42:30,512
and relax for a
motherfucking minute?

926
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:32,341
It is impossible.

927
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:35,137
The magic was in you all along,

928
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,036
not some motherfucking clock.

929
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:38,727
You think so?

930
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:42,076
Oh I know so, just
relax and breathe.

931
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:50,498
Oh maybe the fuck nah.

932
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,858
Here you go.

933
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:10,207
You're shitting me, right?

934
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,898
What now?

935
00:43:11,899 --> 00:43:13,797
This doesn't look
like the picture.

936
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:15,902
We don't have pictures.

937
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:17,732
Then you changed it, okay?

938
00:43:17,733 --> 00:43:20,493
I've seen better
food at the zoo.

939
00:43:20,494 --> 00:43:22,738
From the hippo den, I presume.

940
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:24,602
What?

941
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,050
Get your manager.

942
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:27,845
I am the manager.

943
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:28,881
I know the owner.

944
00:43:28,882 --> 00:43:30,711
Boom, I'm the owner.

945
00:43:34,335 --> 00:43:36,198
I could have got this
cheaper down the street,

946
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:37,579
you kidding me?

947
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,961
Then why don't you do that?

948
00:43:40,238 --> 00:43:42,722
Look, lady, there it
is, if you like it,

949
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,379
and there it is, if you don't.

950
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,485
Well, I'll never, okay?

951
00:43:47,314 --> 00:43:49,004
That's obvious.

952
00:43:49,005 --> 00:43:51,041
Pay up, leave a nice tip

953
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,630
for the lady you
insulted or wear it.

954
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,286
I'm not paying for this.

955
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:57,393
Well, you've made your choice.

956
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,089
I am never coming here again.

957
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:09,957
That's the most reasonable
thing you've said all night.

958
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:14,236
Rabbit.

959
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,140
I've dealt with pissed
off bombs and sexy hell,

960
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:24,108
have been covered
in alien splooge,

961
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:27,664
but nothing could
prepare me for a Karen.

962
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,459
Yeah, Rabbit, push
that motherfucker.

963
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,910
Push it, push it real good,

964
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:35,085
then I'll be running
this restaurant

965
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:37,259
right into the
motherfucking ground.

966
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,571
You're right.

967
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:39,952
I can't do it.

968
00:44:39,953 --> 00:44:42,161
There's too much
right to go on this.

969
00:44:42,162 --> 00:44:43,610
Thank you, Ebee.

970
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:46,337
Fuck, did I just say
that shit out loud?

971
00:44:46,338 --> 00:44:48,167
I thought I was just
thinking that motherfucker.

972
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:50,031
I know you have
definitely projected that.

973
00:44:50,032 --> 00:44:54,588
Well, goddamn, we'll project
your on those beans weenie.

974
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:58,039
- Cheers.
- Yeah,

975
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,109
and we definitely
have to do it again.

976
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,350
- I know, it's so fun.
- Cheers.

977
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:03,695
Oh my gosh, I got my
fringe in your beans.

978
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:06,357
The fringy beans?

979
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:07,427
Is that the bill?

980
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:09,050
Yes it is, and it's no hurry.

981
00:45:09,051 --> 00:45:11,742
And I really appreciate
you supporting me today,

982
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:12,743
I really do.
Let me get that.

983
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:13,744
- Oh.
- Oh no.

984
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:14,780
It's on us.

985
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:15,988
Yeah, we totally got it.

986
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:18,576
Would this be
cash, ass or grass?

987
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:21,614
But no grass, I'm
legitimate now.

988
00:45:21,615 --> 00:45:25,204
Just lemme dig in my
purse and find my wallet,

989
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:26,620
right, Kendra, my wallet.

990
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,725
Oh yeah.

991
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,245
Okay, grab my hands.

992
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,976
What the hell was that?

993
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,807
Some kind of flashback?

994
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:53,611
Hey.

995
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:57,823
Hi, you have to excuse me.

996
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:59,894
It's not every day a fellow sees

997
00:45:59,895 --> 00:46:02,690
such a beautiful, sensuous
woman like yourself.

998
00:46:09,456 --> 00:46:11,284
Where's my manners?

999
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:12,699
I'm rabbit.

1000
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,151
I know, we've met.

1001
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:18,396
I'm still Rhonda Vu.

1002
00:46:19,742 --> 00:46:20,985
Oh Rhonda Vu,

1003
00:46:23,677 --> 00:46:25,022
how's it hanging?

1004
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,853
Low, and to the left.

1005
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:35,377
You and I never finished
what we started in Vegas.

1006
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:36,379
We didn't?

1007
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:39,210
Why is that?

1008
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:42,075
Because you ran off

1009
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,459
screaming like a little bitch.

1010
00:46:49,945 --> 00:46:50,945
I did?

1011
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:54,466
But we had a heck of
a conversation, right?

1012
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,814
Oh.

1013
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:05,338
Does this still bother you?

1014
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:07,686
Who cares, it's just skin.

1015
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,016
Enjoy.

1016
00:47:29,087 --> 00:47:30,087
Oh thanks.

1017
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,991
Oh dude, it looks
so yummilicious.

1018
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:39,373
Oh completely suckerlicious.

1019
00:47:41,444 --> 00:47:42,479
Let's dig in.

1020
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
I did that.

1021
00:47:51,316 --> 00:47:53,422
Oh I can almost taste it.

1022
00:47:54,941 --> 00:47:56,183
Yeah, almost.

1023
00:47:57,633 --> 00:47:59,462
It's like as close as
we're gonna get, bro.

1024
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,878
Hummer, dude.

1025
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,431
We're in gnarly.

1026
00:48:03,432 --> 00:48:06,021
Well, how about like a toast?

1027
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:08,954
Oh.

1028
00:48:12,165 --> 00:48:14,029
- Hi.
- You can call.

1029
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:22,726
I don't know about you,

1030
00:48:22,727 --> 00:48:24,729
but I'd let him possess
this pussy any day.

1031
00:48:26,973 --> 00:48:28,525
This totally sucks.

1032
00:48:28,526 --> 00:48:32,909
Being a ghost is just
like all one big suck.

1033
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,844
Bro, it was a total
ghostly toast as bros, bro.

1034
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:40,038
You took the words
right outta my mouth.

1035
00:48:42,264 --> 00:48:43,713
At least it still smells good.

1036
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:46,163
You can smell it?

1037
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:49,547
A ghost can dream.

1038
00:48:50,582 --> 00:48:51,411
Yeah.

1039
00:48:51,412 --> 00:48:52,481
A ghost can dream.

1040
00:49:07,427 --> 00:49:09,049
Somebody left their food.

1041
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:26,410
What the heck was that?

1042
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:28,896
Sexy hell, they must
have ordered to go.

1043
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:34,487
Sal.

1044
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:41,770
Ebee, we've been through a
lot of rough years together,

1045
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:44,394
but you really pulled
through for me tonight.

1046
00:49:44,395 --> 00:49:46,085
I wanna thank you.

1047
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:48,122
Well, about fucking time.

1048
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:52,264
Going legit was the
best decision I ever made.

1049
00:49:52,265 --> 00:49:55,784
Well, I can't believe I'm
saying this, but congrats.

1050
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:58,822
You deserve everything
you get, dick face.

1051
00:49:58,823 --> 00:50:01,376
I do deserve everything
I get, don't I?

1052
00:50:01,377 --> 00:50:03,655
Everything, motherfucker.

1053
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:07,555
I've been so busy, I'm a bit.

1054
00:50:07,556 --> 00:50:09,765
I haven't even
tasted the food, Sal?

1055
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,013
Oh.

1056
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:23,779
Weed, glory is weed.

1057
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,610
That's right.

1058
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:31,303
You thought you could make
it without me and my weed.

1059
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:33,995
You thought wrong, motherfucker.

1060
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:35,238
You're nothing without Ebee.

1061
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:36,515
How could you?

1062
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:38,344
This is my one chance.

1063
00:50:38,345 --> 00:50:41,659
And you won
motherfucker, be grateful.

1064
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:44,869
I'm just beside myself.

1065
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:48,286
Oh, yes.

1066
00:50:53,602 --> 00:50:55,845
I gotta say, you
really pulled it off.

1067
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:58,088
I did?

1068
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:00,298
There he is.

1069
00:51:00,299 --> 00:51:01,299
There's the jerk.

1070
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:05,716
Keep it still in the bathroom.

1071
00:51:05,717 --> 00:51:07,077
Oh my gosh, she's
gonna see this?

1072
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,720
What seems to be
the problem officers?

1073
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:12,171
This lady with nothing
else going on in her life

1074
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:14,415
has filed a report against
this establishment.

1075
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:16,555
I want him fired.

1076
00:51:16,556 --> 00:51:20,145
You can't fire me, I
own this establishment.

1077
00:51:20,146 --> 00:51:22,561
Sir, now that I
look around myself,

1078
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:24,391
there is some merit
to what she's told us.

1079
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:27,945
Are you running some kind
of house of ill repute?

1080
00:51:27,946 --> 00:51:30,156
Oh no, they're just high.

1081
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,780
Say it again, sir.

1082
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:35,781
No.

1083
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,233
Oh, here, try some
of our fine cuisine,

1084
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:40,234
I think you'll love it.

1085
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,241
That's my high
